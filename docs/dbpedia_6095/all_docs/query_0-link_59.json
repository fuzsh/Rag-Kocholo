        "text": "(JUMP TO PART TWO)\n\nPART ONE\n\nWhen a new trailer hits the Internet, at least 95% of viewers are absolutely certain they know the entire story based on two minutes of a two-hour film[1] [citation needed]. In fact, by the time they’ve finished watching the trailer, they have already judged whether the film is going to be good or bad.\n\nTo be fair, this assessment can be accurate on occasion. One look at the trailer for Gods of Egypt is enough to tell you that the film is most likely going to be a bore.\n\nBut most of the time, trailers aren’t very good predictors of a movie’s full potential and quality[3].\n\nJust as bad films can have great trailers (Spider-Man 3 and Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, for instance), good films can have terrible trailers (such as the trailers for the original Star Wars and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).\n\nThis is a perfect instance of learning not to judge a book by its cover[4].\n\nThat is why I have developed a different method of assessing whether a film will be of good standards or bad, one that avoids using the trailer as a basis of measurement.\n\nIt isn’t a failsafe technique- no metric ever is- but it is a great deal more accurate and reliable[5].\n\nThis involves a three-part measurement:\n\nFACTOR #1: The director\n\nSteven Spielberg took a cliché-ridden World War 2 script and turned it into a masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan.\n\nFor all its problems, it is Christopher Nolan’s assured direction that makes The Dark Knight Rises still entertaining enough to sit through.\n\nThen there’s Josh Trank and the rebooted Fantastic Four[6].\n\nA director can often mean the difference between a good film and bad. That is why some movies are marketed using the director’s brand value (“From director Christopher Nolan”; “From the director of The Social Network”). When you watch a movie and you know it is directed by someone such as Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorsese, there is always a very favourable chance that it is a very good movie.\n\nErgo, whenever a movie is announced, the first criterion to check is the director, or more accurately, their track record. This can play out in the following ways:\n\nIf they have made several films before: is their track record consistent or is it more hit-and-miss?\n\nThe Coen Brothers have made some great films including Fargo, The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men. Their latest film, Hail, Caesar!, is another great addition to their impressive resume. Therefore, the chances that their next film is mediocre are 1 in 5 [citation needed[7]].\n\nOn the other side, Ridley Scott has made some great films (Alien, Thelma & Louise and Black Hawk Down) but he’s also made some dreadful ones (Gladiator[8] & Robin Hood, for instance). It’s hard to believe that the same man who gave us The Martian last year also directed the terrible Exodus: Gods and Kings.\n\nCONCLUSION: In such an instance, the odds are high that such a director’s latest film will be good but there also exists the chance that it will be bad.\n\nIf it is the director’s second film feature- how was the director’s first film?\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nVery often, a director who finds success with a small film might follow up with a big-budgeted blockbuster. This can go either way:\n\n– Colin Treverrow went from Safety Not Guaranteed to Jurassic World.\n\n– Safety Not Guaranteed was a good film.\n\nRESULT: Jurassic World was a fun film.\n\n– Marc Webb first made (500) Days of Summer before directing the two Amazing Spider-Man films.\n\n– (500) Days of Summer was excellent.\n\n– The Amazing Spider-Man was good.\n\n– The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was terrible.\n\nRESULT: Marc Webb couldn’t maintain the momentum\n\n– Josh Trank made Chronicle, then followed it up with the rebooted Fantastic Four.\n\nRESULT: The reader can be the judge of that.\n\nCONCLUSION: In such a scenario, it’s always a fifty-fifty chance because the result can go either way[9].\n\nIf it is the director’s first film feature…\n\nIn such a scenario, the benefit of doubt should always be given because the director doesn’t have a filmography to judge their past work- short films aren’t great predictors, either. If he/she has directed episodes for television series, though, were these episodes good? Bad? Forgettable?\n\nA good example would be Dan Trachtenberg’s recent directorial debut, 10 Cloverfield Lane. His past work includes stints on short films, directorial work on a television series episodes, and mostly bits and bobs. 10 Cloverfield Lane, therefore, could have either been good or bad, it would be difficult to judge. Luckily, it seems to have fallen on the side of the former, based on a number of reviews[10].\n\nCONCLUSION: This is also a fifty-fifty chance because at this point, other factors MUST be taken into consideration[12].\n\nSo we come to…\n\nFACTOR #2: The Producer\n\nThe producer oversees finances and other managerial aspects of the project. Because the producer usually holds the cheque book, anybody with a big bank account can be a film producer- and that means, at the end of the day, it is ultimately THEIR film[13].\n\nIf a producer happens to be someone like David Heyman (Harry Potter, Paddington), Kathleen Kennedy (Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial) or Scott Rudin (The Social Network, The Grand Budapest Hotel), then there’s a reassuring chance that the film will be up to the mark. Once again, consistency in the past is a good predictor of the quality of their future films.\n\nOf course, the extent of a producer’s influence on the creative direction of the film is difficult to ascertain. For our purposes, we have to go with the belief that they had some influence. IMDB is a good place to search their credentials and past work to see if their record is good, scattershot or consists of mostly terrible films.\n\nBUT even a good director and producer would mean nothing if the 3rd metric is subpar and that is…\n\nFACTOR #3: The Screenwriter\n\nThe screenplay is the film’s blueprint[14]. A great director can occasionally churn out a good film from a mediocre script (e.g. Jurassic Park) but in most cases, a bad script can ruin a film. Therefore, a good scribe is often the reflection of a good film. Of course, you have to remember that even the best writer might occasionally produce something subpar[15].\n\nI cannot emphasise more on the maxim running throughout this post: always check for consistency. Remember that even the best writers[16 ] can have an off-day but the ratio of bad work to good- if they’ve been writing films for some time- is 1:3[17 ] [citation needed].\n\nI shall use The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as an example of this metric’s applicability. The best work of the writers, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, is the Star Trek reboot. Barring the first Transformers, their other films are… questionable, qualitatively-speaking[18]. So is it any surprise when the final outcome of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is yet another reboot[19]?\n\nSUMMING UP:\n\nThere are three factors to look at to determine whether a film will be good or bad without basing assumptions on the trailer:\n\nThe director\n\nThe producer(s)\n\nThe screenwriter(s).\n\nOf the afore-mentioned through, go through their past work and see if, on average, their work is consistently good or consistently bad. Any person’s early first outings might be bad but if their later work improves, then it is on this body of work that you should base your assessments on because this is evidence that they have learned and developed their skills. Consistency is tantamount because past efforts can be a good predictor of future work.\n\n~\n\n(JUMP TO PART ONE)\n\nPART TWO\n\nDear Reader,\n\nIf you have made it this far, thank you. One of the writer’s greatest fears (apart from dying in squalor for his/her craft) is whether people stop reading what they’ve written halfway because they’ve lost interest.\n\nI dedicated my time churning out this lengthy piece in the hopes that the readers would henceforth take a film’s trailer with a grain of salt and be more cautious to suspend judgement as the marketing is hardly an accurate reflection of a film’s worth and potential. After all, bad films can have great trailers and vice versa.\n\nBut if you sense scepticism and doubt creeping into your mind while reading this, then nothing could make me happier: because, as with a film’s trailer, you are hesitant to take what I’ve written at face-value.\n\nOn your part, you might argue that you have been right in the past before- perhaps a film’s lousy trailer did result in a lousy film. And you may be quite right. Sometimes, first impressions are accurate.\n\nFor my part, I have never claimed my metrics to be foolproof- sometimes, even the combined trio of a good director, producer and writer can result in a mediocre film. It happens- on paper, Spectre had everything going for it, but the final product was lacklustre. I will never claim to be certain all the time.\n\nWhen making assessments- of any sort- reservation must always be kept, that margin open in the eventuality that the opposite can happen: that a seemingly bad film can be good or a seemingly good film can end up rotten.\n\nSo perhaps it’s time I put my money where my mouth is and actually put my metrics to the test as proof, by applying these measurements for four films coming out later this year.\n\nMy test subjects are:\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\n\nGhostbusters\n\nThe Circle\n\n(NOTE: To be fair, we’ll have to wait till the films release over the course of 2016 to see whether my assessments have any accuracy or validity to them.)\n\n(NOTE PART II: All calculations and percentages that follow hereafter are derived from the writer’s rough approximations and should NOT to be taken or used as statistical facts).\n\na) Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\nRELEASE DATE: March 25th\n\nAt the time of writing this, we are less than two weeks away from the film’s release.\n\nTo recap: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (henceforth referred to as “BvS”) is a sequel to the divisive[20] Superman reboot, Man of Steel. It’s still directed by Zack Snyder, and Ben Affleck as Batman and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor haven’t exactly garnered the most enthusiastic response when they were cast.\n\nNot the most encouraging start, admittedly.\n\nSo let’s see:\n\n#1: The Director – Zack Snyder\n\nWhile Snyder has an undeniable eye for visuals, he tends to fall short on providing enough substance to complement his style[21]. With BvS, it isn’t the action sequences that have fans on edge- it’s whether the non-action moments between the fighting and smashing[22] will be good enough to sit through.\n\nODDS: 40% favourable\n\n#2: The Producers – Charles Roven and Deborah Snyder\n\nCharles Roven might not be a tour-de-force name like Harvey Weinstein or Scott Rudin but he has been involved with notable projects in the past, including Nolan’s Batman films, American Hustle, 12 Monkeys and Three Kings. On the flip side, he’s also produced the Scooby-Doo movies and Season of the Witch[23], so…\n\nAs for Deborah Snyder, she’s produced all of her husband’s films, starting with 300. Her track is basically on par with that of Zack Snyder’s, so…\n\nODDS: I’d estimate it at 40-50% favourable\n\n#3: The Screenwriter – Chris Terrio[24]\n\nHe hasn’t written that many films but Chris Terrio’s script for Argo did win him an Oscar. He was brought on board around the same time as Affleck (who directed Argo) to re-write David S. Goyer’s script (who wrote the screenplay for Man of Steel). Experience-wise, Goyer has far more credits but Terrio does have an Oscar, so that gets more of an edge[25].\n\nApart from his past win, interviews with Chris Terrio tell us that he is a writer who puts a lot of effort into his work, particularly when it comes to detail[26], so much so that Warner Brothers was so pleased they handed him scripting duties for Justice League-Part One, for which he did a surprising bit of research that one might not expect to do for a superhero film:\n\n“This has been the most rigorous intellectual exercise I’ve had in my writing life. For Batman v Superman, I wanted to really dig into everything from ideas about American power to the structure of revenge tragedies to the huge canon of DC Comics to Amazon mythology. For Justice League, I could be reading in the same day about red- and blueshifts in physics, Diodorus of Sicily and his account of the war between Amazons and Atlanteans, or deep-sea biology and what kind of life plausibly might be in the Mariana Trench.\n\nIf you told me the most rigorous dramaturgical and intellectual product of my life would be superhero movies, I would say you were crazy. But I do think fans deserve that. I felt I owed the fan base all of my body and soul for two years because anything less wouldn’t have been appreciating the opportunity I had.”\n\nAt the end of the day, while such research would most likely not even make a cameo reference, it shows a level of dedication to understanding these comic book characters beyond simply reading as many comic books as possible in preparation. In any case, Terrio has made it explicit that he takes his work very seriously- it is the type of work you’d expect from an author writing a novel requiring all that detail, and not a film.\n\nODDS: 70-80% favourable.\n\n(BONUS: The cast is a solid ensemble for a comic book film [3 Oscar-winners, 4 Oscar-nominees])\n\nCONSENSUS: If Chris Terrio can deliver on the script, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has a 60-80% chance of being a good film[27].\n\n2) Captain America: Civil War\n\nRELEASE DATE: May 6th, 2016\n\nMarvel dropped a new trailer for Captain America: Civil War less than a week ago (at the time of writing) and it’s already amassed as many views as the very first trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens[28].\n\nApart from Spider-Man stealing the trailer’s thunder[29], there’s a lot going on in Civil War[30]: it is a sequel to the Winter Soldier; it is based on a monumental comic book event; nearly every Avenger (except for Thor and Hulk) are showing up; and it kicks off Marvel’s Phase Three[31].\n\nBusy movie. But let’s pretend the trailers haven’t been released yet- on paper, what are the film’s chances?\n\n#1 The Directors – Anthony and Joe Russo\n\nThe Russo brothers did some excellent work on Community and Arrested Development. Interestingly, it was their directorial efforts on Community that landed them the Marvel gig[32]. Captain America: The Winter Solder was a surprisingly good movie- the biggest highlights being the action sequences, especially the opening sequence, Nick Fury getting attacked, the elevator fight and the highway battle between Steve and Bucky- in fact, the final battle paled in comparison to the earlier fights, and that’s saying a lot!\n\nAll in all, the Russo brothers seem to be assured in their next round. After all, it got them calling the shots on the two-part Infinity Wars that will be the culmination of everything Marvel has been building up to since Iron Man back in 2008.\n\nODDS: 70-80% favourable\n\n#2 The Producer – Kevin Feige\n\nThe architect of the MCU, Feige has been responsible for overseeing the movies since Iron Man. He clearly knows his business and it’s clear that he is a major fan of comics. And even if some of the Marvel films aren’t that great, they’re still good to a certain extent. So far, Feige has yet to deliver a truly bad film, and it’s quite unlikely that he will drop the ball with Civil War.\n\nODDS: 70-80% favourable\n\n#3 The Screenwriters – Christopher Markus & Stephen McFreely[33]\n\nChristopher Markus & Stephen McFreely are solid writers. Their past work includes the Narnia films, Thor: The Dark World, the last two Captain America films & Pain & Gain, amongst a few others. That said, the scripts for these films mentioned aren’t necessarily that great. They’re solid enough to get the job done.\n\nAnd as long as it’s entertaining enough, sometimes that’s what matters most.\n\nODDS: 60% favourable\n\n(BONUS: The cast are familiar to most audiences, and having the poster boy of the MCU, Robert Downey, Jr., as the second main actor, is a big draw.)\n\nCONSENSUS: Captain America: Civil War will be a busy film but the Russo brothers have a 65-87% favourable chance of pulling it off\n\n3) Ghostbusters\n\nRELEASE DATE: July 15th, 2016\n\nThis film is gaining more controversy than Batman v Superman, and the trailer has done little to assuage audiences.\n\nTo be fair, the fans’ unhappiness is justifiable: the first Ghostbusters is a classic, and I think- in their heart of hearts- many were holding out for a reunion with the original cast in Ghostbusters III but that decades-old hope permanently ended with Harold Ramis’ death.\n\nSo in a day and age where Hollywood is rebooting anything and everything from Robocop to Point Break with DISASTROUS results[34], you can’t exactly expect the warmest reception, can you?\n\nI still haven’t watched the trailer yet, so this makes for an excellent chance to apply the metrics here without a trailer to bias my views.\n\n#1 The Director – Paul Feig\n\nThis is a crucial factor. Paul Feig’s last three directorial efforts- Bridesmaids, The Heat and Spy– are quite good, and they share the distinction of featuring female leads, something that isn’t very common in Hollywood. Ghostbusters continues that trend, with an all-female crew and, in a hilarious piece of casting, Chris Hemsworth as their secretary.\n\nIf Feig can keep the momentum going for Ghostbusters, then he and the cast can have the last laugh, and all will be forgiven.\n\nODDS: 55-65% favourable\n\n#2 The Producers – Amy Pascal and Ivan Reitman\n\nAmy Pascal is a bit worrisome- after all, she definitely played some role in the Amazing Spider-Man films’ ultimate fiasco- but having Ivan Reitman onboard is a reassuring sign of approval for the reboot. To add to that vote of confidence, the original cast- Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts- will make an appearance in the reboot (though whether in their original roles remains to be seen). Listen, if the original team gave their blessing, it’s a good sign[35].\n\nODDS: 50-60% favourable\n\n#3 The Screenwriters – Paul Feig and Katie Dippold\n\nPersonally, I’ve always found to Feig be a stronger writer than director[36]. So his involvement with the screenplay reads as a good omen. Katie Dippold has worked with Feig on The Heat, and her past credits include writing episodes for Parks and Recreation. I can’t speak for The Heat (I haven’t watched it) but Parks and Recreation is excellent comedy.\n\nAs far as screenwriters go, the combination of Feig and Dippold- on paper- promises something memorable.\n\nODDS: 60-70% favourable\n\n(BONUS: A solid line-up including Feig’s muse, Melissa McCarthey, and Bridesmaids lead Kristen Wiig)\n\nCONSENSUS: Ghostbusters has a 60% favourable chance of being a worthy reboot.\n\n4) The Circle\n\nRELEASE DATE: TBA\n\nOf the four films selected, this might be the best candidate to apply this test because The Circle– at the time of writing- doesn’t even have a release date yet! There are no production stills, there’s no trailer- the only reason it gets more attention than most smaller-scale films is because The Circle has a stellar line-up including the likes of Emma Watson, Tom Hanks and John Boyega, to name a few.\n\nSo let’s see…\n\n#1 The Director – James Ponsoldt\n\nThe Circle might finally bring the mainstream attention to James Ponsoldt that has criminally eluded him despite the brilliance of his last three films- Smashed, The Spectacular Now and The End of the Tour[37]. At this point, it’s difficult (though not impossible) to imagine that he’ll stumble with The Circle.\n\nODDS: 80-90% favourable\n\n#2 The Producers – Anthony Bregman, Gary Goetzman, Tom Hanks, James Ponsoldt\n\nBarring Tom Hanks, none of the others are exactly big names. But a search on IMDB reveals that Anthony Bregman’s producing credits include Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Foxcatcher and Synecdoche, New York.\n\nGary Goetzman and Tom Hanks co-founded the production company, Playtone. His past credits include My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Where the Wild Things Are.\n\nThe common thread between them is that they are producers willing to back an unusual story that may be considered unconventional, taking a risky chance on unusual narratives that have paid off in the past. That bodes well for the film because The Circle features an unconventional premise- as a result, they may not compromise the integrity of the script to make it too appealing.\n\nODDS: 60-70% favourable\n\nAnd speaking of the script…\n\n#3 The Screenwriter – James Ponsoldt\n\nApart from writing his first feature film, Off the Black, James Ponsoldt’s last script credit was the original screenplay, Smashed. This time, however, he is adapting a novel written by Dave Eggers, a distinguished author.\n\nThe Circle is about a powerful Internet company[38] and what follows when a young woman, Mae Holland (played by Emma Watson), joins their ranks. The novel has shades of reputed dystopian novels such as 1984, and is a fascinating enthralling read. Ponsoldt has rich material to draw from and work with, and given his talent, he’s quite likely to succeed.\n\nODDS: 85% favourable\n\n(BONUS: An appealing cast that also includes Karen Gillian (Guardians of the Galaxy), Patton Oswalt (voice of Remy from Ratatouille), Ellar Coltrane (Boyhood), and Bill Paxton[39] (Apollo 13)).\n\nCONSENSUS: On paper, The Circle adaptation has an 85% favourable chance of turning out to be an enjoyable movie.\n\nAnd that… is that. I hope you’ve had as much fun reading this as I had writing it.\n\nNow that you’ve come to the end of this piece, there is the inevitable question: what are my credentials on this matter? I am not a film critic (though I would like to be) and I don’t work in Hollywood. I do have some knowledge about the industry based on what I’ve read, though. And since last year, I have been able to make- to a certain degree- a number of accurate predictions about box-office results for 2015; and at the Oscars this February, 15 of my 19 predictions came through. If I had placed bets on the results, I would have made a good deal of cash!\n\nThose are my credentials.\n\nI shall update this post throughout the year when the four afore-mentioned films are released, to see whether my calls have been hits or misses.\n\nMeanwhile, have a great year of movies ahead.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n1. ^ This writer tends to be guilty of this tendency, too; hence why he chooses to avoid watching trailers as much as he can[2]\n\n2. [return to top] In this writer’s defence, he manages to cobble together a rough outline of the film’s narrative by piecing released synopses, rumoured reports and any source material on which the film might be inspired/based on\n\n3. ^ Trailers are usually cut by somebody not even involved with the film- usually it’s Bob from marketing (damn it, Bob, you had one job!) (citation needed)\n\n4. ^ Or in this case, a film by its marketing\n\n5. ^ On the plus side, you get to avoid all the trailers and watch the movie without knowing much to spoil the experience\n\n6. ^ This writer makes no claim that Trank was solely responsible for the F4 debacle. But a director is always largely responsible for the final vision of a film, so…\n\n7. ^ The writer did not do well in statistic classes, so he likes to use convenient readily-available stats to prove a point or illustrate using allegories: if a film is represented as apples, and the Coen brothers have five apples, there exists a possibility that one of those five apples will be bad\n\n8. ^ The writer would like to maintain his stance that Gladiator is a terrible film that did not deserve to win Best Picture, and that Ridley Scott has made far finer films\n\n9. ^ There are a lot of other factors involved with the final outcome of a film apart from the director, which we’ll get to in a while\n\n10. ^ 10 Cloverfield Lane’s success isn’t solely due to the director- it had the benefit of having a script co-written by Whiplash director, Damien Chazelle[11 ], a crucial element to the film’s ultimate success.\n\n11. [return to top] Damien Chazelle dropped out of 10 Cloverfield Lane to direct Whiplash but his contributions no doubt were instrumental to the film’s final outcome\n\n12. ^ Told you we’d get there!\n\n13. ^ That’s why producers are nominated at the Oscars for Best Picture.\n\n14. ^ Screenwriters can get a raw deal. For more information and insight on the machine that is Hollywood, read Thomas Lennon’s and Robert Ben Garant’s Writing Movies for Fun and Profit: How We Made a Billion Dollars at the Box Office and You Can Too!\n\n15. ^ My favourite example is Melissa Rosenberg: her work on Dexter includes some of the series’ best episodes (such as the finales of season one and season four), and her recent duties on Netflix’s Jessica Jones have raised the benchmark for superhero adaptations. And then she was involved with the Twilight I’ll leave it to you to draw conclusions from that comparison.\n\n16. ^ Screenwriting credits are complicated. For more information, go to http://www.slashfilm.com/qa-credit-screenplay-ampersands-ands/\n\n17. ^ That ratio could similarly run the other way i.e. 1 good movie for every 2 bad movies\n\n18. ^ Other films of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci include Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Legend of Zorro and Star Trek into Darkness. Make of that what you will\n\n19. ^ The film did have Jeff Pinker as a third writer, whose past credits include work on Lost and Ally McBeal, but even that couldn’t prevent Spider-Man from having a terrible outing\n\n20. ^ Reviews and fans indicate that audiences were polarised in their opinions over Man of Steel\n\n21. ^ Except for Watchmen, I personally feel. Watchmen is Snyder’s best film to date (at the time of writing this)\n\n22. ^ You know: the stuff that makes up most of a film\n\n23. ^ They weren’t very good movies, were they?\n\n24. ^ Chris Terrio’s involvement is, personally, my only hope that BvS will be a good movie\n\n25. ^ Between the two, Terrio is better because, to put it bluntly, Goyer is not the best of writers\n\n26. ^ When writing Argo, Terrio did an entire background check to see if Gatorade was available during the time of the Iranian Revolution just so that he could use it in a line, as revealed in this interview:\n\n“As Scene 58 proceeds, top-floor officials from the CIA and State Department debate ideas for cover stories, each idea worse than the last, though no one in the room dares to point out that these Important Men thinking Important Thoughts are, in fact, delusional — no one except our hero, Tony Mendez. I knew that the crucial beat in the scene (and a major turning point in the film, both for its story and in its tone) would come when Mendez finally decided to speak up to his superiors…\n\nI settled on the idea that Mendez would throw a spitball into the self-serious conversation by making a joke about giving the bicycle escapees Gatorade. (Which meant I had to determine whether Gatorade was on the market and a commonly recognized brand in December of 1979. I celebrated when I found a Time Magazine from the year before featuring a dehydrated athlete with a Village People–style mustache: “Gatorade: When You’re Thirsty to Win.” So the Gatorade could stay.) Mendez would make his off-hand joke. The table would go silent. The attention of the room would shift to the court jester speaking truth to power.”\n\n27. ^ Personally, I’m hoping for a GREAT film\n\n28. ^ Not to take anything away from the fans but I’m pretty sure the high number of views has to do with Spider-Man’s appearance in the last two seconds more than anything else. It’s all everyone is talking about when they bring up the Civil War trailer\n\n29. ^ If Marvel puts out a third trailer prior to the film’s release, one without any footage of Spider-Man in it, I’m willing to bet that the number of views will be far less than that of trailer #2\n\n30. ^ Never have the words “civil” and “war” inspired so much fervour and excitement before\n\n31. ^ And, let’s not forget, they got Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe! That is such a big deal!\n\n32. ^ Specifically, the season two finale episodes, A Fistful of Paintballs and For A Few Paintballs More\n\n33. ^ In my perspective, they are the weak link\n\n34. ^ At the time of writing, the 11 Oscar-winning film, Ben-Hur, is getting a new film\n\n35. ^ A quote by Dan Akroyd in EW:\n\n“None of us lobbied to be in the third movie,” he says. “We all felt that this Paul Feig concept was so strong that we didn’t have to be in it. But he called me. And of course, I said, ‘I want to help in any way I can.’”\n\n36. ^ Freaks and Geeks is Paul Feig’s finest creation to date\n\n37. ^ The Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings for these films respectively are: Smashed (84%|71); The Spectacular Now (93%|82); The End of the Tour (91%|82)\n\n38. ^ In the novel, The Circle- the company, that is- has far surpassed Google and Facebook"
