        "text": "Just how bad a suffocating Greek mother is Nia Vardalos, on a scale of one to 10?\n\n\"Eleven,\" she says without hesitation, or shame, about her parenting of daughter Ilaria, aged 10.\n\n\"I know it's ridiculous,\" says the 53-year-old actress and writer, who gets up early every day to make all her daughter's food from scratch from organic goods.\n\n\"I love taking care of her so much that I often forget about taking care of myself, and my cousin Nikki let me know that. She was like, 'If you don't pluck those eyebrows, I'm going in'.\"\n\nThese tales are, of course, the kind of material that makes up the charms of 2002's My Big Fat Greek Wedding, a witty, warm-hearted, part Cinderella story, part satire of immigrant family life, and now its long-awaited sequel.\n\nIn the original, Vardalos introduced audiences to Toula Portokalos, a dowdy, single 30-year-old struggling to find her identity outside an overwhelming but well-meaning Greek immigrant family in Chicago, before finding a happy ending in marrying Ian (Sex and the City's John Corbett) and having a daughter.\n\nThe sleeper hit, made for $US5 million, pulled in an incredible worldwide box office of more than $US368 million and is astonishingly still the highest-earning romantic comedy ever – and earned Vardalos an Oscar nomination for best screenplay.\n\nIn the sequel, she's back as an exasperated Toula battling her dominant extended family. But there are different struggles, too, as Toula and Ian's now 17-year-old daughter struggles to find her own identity.\n\nAs with the original, it features a broad ensemble cast including veteran Lainie Kazan as Toula's larger-than-life mother, Andrea Martin as the hilariously inappropriate advice-giving aunt and Michael Constantine as Toula's Windex-wielding, diehard patriot father Gus.\n\nVardalos, who grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, has mined her world and family life to produce comic moments. She has a huge family – 27 cousins and an overall extended family of about 100 – and, like Toula, married a non-Greek, actor Ian Gomez, in 1993.\n\nThe popularity of the original has proved universal, however.\n\n\"When I got to go around the world with the [first] film, I found out an immigrating parent is [always] an immigrating parent, and that's why I think everyone sees their family in my family, whether they're Italian or Scottish or Irish or French,\" she says.\n\nAfter writing the original screenplay, Vardalos began performing it as a one-woman stage play in Los Angeles in the late 1990s, cleverly marketing it at local Greek Orthodox churches.\n\nIt was noticed by actress Rita Wilson, who grew up in a Greek-American family, and with her husband Tom Hanks and their producing partner Gary Goetzman, they took the film on under their Playtone production company.\n\nThe story behind the sequel though, is heart-wrenching and joyous.\n\nWhile filming the original, Vardalos and Gomez were privately struggling to have a child. Returning to the set of the family restaurant, Dancing Zorba's, while filming the sequel in Toronto last year, a scene where she picks up Toula's old signature frumpy glasses out of a drawer was \"very emotional\", she says.\n\n\"As I reached and found the glasses, it occurred to me in that moment that I'm a mum, and this is the whole reason we're here [back on set]. The first time I reached for those glasses, I was in the depths of despair of how many disappointments I'd gone through when were filming the first film in 2000.\"\n\nThe couple adopted their daughter at age three from foster care in 2008 with just 14 hours' notice (she wrote about the experience in her New York Times bestselling memoir Instant Mom in 2013).\n\nYears earlier, however, after the success of the original film, it was an obvious question that a sequel would be on the cards, but the time just wasn't right for Vardalos.\n\nHaving written in the original's ending that Toula and Ian had a six-year-old, she felt unable to tackle a sequel while her personal struggle went on. She felt she couldn't write a script about being a mother and \"emotions I don't know\", and do publicity tours and have her personal life scrutinised while in such a \"raw state\".\n\n\"I confided in Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson and Gary Goetzman at that time, because we had become such good friends,\" she says. \"I said, here's the deal, I'm going through something that I never asked for, this fame, this white-hot spotlight on my life. What it has done, while I'm grateful for [the fame], it's taken away my privacy.\"\n\n\"They were fantastic about it,\" she says of her producers. \"They understood and they were comforting. They said we'll do other projects, and we did.\"\n\nA short-lived TV series, My Big Fat Greek Life appeared, starring Vardalos, who also executive produced alongside Hanks and Wilson. Elsewhere, she appeared in My Life In Ruins, a comedy alongside Richard Dreyfuss, in 2009. She also co-wrote with Hanks the 2011 rom-com, Larry Crowne, where Hanks strikes up a romance with Julia Roberts.\n\nThen around 2011 and 2012, she began writing a sequel in earnest, once Ilaria had settled into kindergarten, and inspired by recognising traits in herself of an overbearing Greek mother.\n\nShe says she'd end up crying so hard at school events that other parents would make fun of her.\n\n\"You know, the holiday concert: the kids are singing Christmas carols, holding little pretend, lighted candles, and I'm flooding the gym with my tears,\" she says.\n\n\"The Anglo-Saxon parents just shift their chairs away: 'Ah, there goes ethnic mum again'.\"\n\nShe says her daughter only watched the first movie and bits of the sequel earlier this year.\n\nHaving reluctantly watched it with the request that \"I don't want to see any kissing\", Vardalos says her daughter still thinks of her as just '\"mum\".\n\nShe doesn't think what you do is cool?\n\n\"No,\" says Vardalos. \"She thinks dinosaurs are cool.\"\n\nVardalos says she's open to a third movie, but with a busy schedule this year working on a TV series and an Off-Broadway show, she may not immediately get to it.\n\nIn the meantime, what advice would she give to young Greek women on surviving family life?\n\n\"You know, I try so hard not to give advice, because I've had a lifetime of it. I've always got 19 opinions coming my way by somebody whose last name is Vardalos.\n\n\"I guess what I would say is you only have one life, and you have to form your own identity. I know the teen years are coming my way, when my daughter will do the natural and healthy thing and separate herself from me a little bit.\n\n\"I understand that one day she might go away to college. I don't want her to, but she has to do what's best for her.\"\n\nThe final touches for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 were completed just two days before Vardalos set off for the global press tour.\n\nShe says Hanks and Wilson were mocking her for not using her days off better.\n\n\"On both days, I volunteered at my daughter's school, and they were like, 'What are you doing?' and I said, 'What? I am Toula'.\"\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is out now."
