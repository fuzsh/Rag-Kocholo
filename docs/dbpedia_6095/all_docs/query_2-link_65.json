        "text": "Opinion\n\nHey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 24/06/2011 (4801 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nYou might say Nia Vardalos and Tom Hanks go back.\n\nThe Winnipeg-born Vardalos’s destiny famously entwined with the California-spawned box office king Hanks with when Hanks helped develop and produce My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the 2002 film written by and starring Vardalos.\n\nYou might also say that worked out well. The comedy still holds the title of the most profitable Hollywood movie ever made according to a recent survey by CNBC. With an inflation-adjusted budget of $6 million and gross revenue of $369 million, the film reportedly bestowed an impressive 6150% return on investment.\n\nIt was Hanks’ Greek-American wife Rita Wilson who may have compelled the actor to attend Vardalos’s one-woman theatrical production of Wedding in Los Angeles. (Wilson has producer credits on MBFGW and Vardalos’s subsequent movies Connie and Carla and My Life in Ruins.) But Hanks evidently recognized a kindred comedy spirit, which is why he signed her to help him write Larry Crowne, a romantic comedy in which Hanks stars as a downsized retail worker who goes to college and hooks up with a communications teacher, played by Julia Roberts.\n\nVardalos, on the phone from Los Angeles, says Hanks “wanted to write with somebody so that he wouldn’t just be focused on his character.\n\n“But what I was really moved by was how much he wanted to create a character with depths and flaws for Julia Roberts,” she says. “I thought that was really interesting and very ensemble-like of him to want to have something interesting for everyone to play.\n\n“The way that we wrote was very organic and egoless in that I would write a draft and we would bring it into Playtone (Hanks’ production company) and take it apart, and keep what we liked.”\n\nHanks may have also appreciated Vardalos’s impertinence towards him. Vardalos says she once sent Hanks a draft of the script “in a birthday box, with a card that said: ‘Here’s a little something to kick start your lame career.'”\n\nIn any case, the collaboration bore fruit for Vardalos, who went on set to watch Hanks direct his second feature since That Thing You Do in 1996.\n\n“That was like film school for me,” she says, adding it was Hanks who suggested Vardalos’s husband Ian Gomez appear in the movie. “He said: ‘So Ian’s going to play a part, right?”\n\nGomez has appeared in all of Vardalos’s movies and in a way, even if Vardalos is not actually onscreen, Larry Crowne feels very much like one of Vardalos’s movie in that it features a large ensemble of comic characters.\n\n“I love writing for lots and lots of people and that comes from my training at Second City,” Vardalos says, referring to her years in Chicago working for the legendary improv group.\n\n“At Second City, you’re only as good as the person you’re in the scene with,” she says.\n\n“I love telling many stories because I also think that the audience relates to different people in the piece.”\n\nShe acknowledges that does represent a change from when she took to the stage by herself for the solo performance that put her on the movie map.\n\n“But when I did my solo show of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I played all the parts so even the solo show was a schizophrenic journey.\n\n“I played, I think, 12 characters in it, and I really did it so I could keep my character work up, because after Second City, when I moved here (to Los Angeles), I didn’t get a chance to act … ever.\n\n“So I thought, if I do this onstage, I’ll get to do different accents and play the men and play the women.”\n\nThe ensemble aspect of Larry Crowne had its appeal, but Vardalos says she also appreciated that the movie also reflects contemporary hard times.\n\n“Tom wanted to stay real and we had such a responsibility when, globally, the economy started to shift,” she says. “I was very proud of him for accepting that responsibility and wanting to portray a real story that wasn’t a downer, but didn’t get wrapped up in a neat little bow.\n\n“It’s a romantic comedy, but everything is in the realm of possibility,” she says. “I love that.”\n\nLarry Crowne opens in theatres July 1.\n\nrandall.king@freepress.mb.ca"
