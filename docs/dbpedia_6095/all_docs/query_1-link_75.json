Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, and is forced to live underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic (who he's told was spread by a mysterious \"Army of the Twelve Monkeys\") and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert. 96\n\n12 Monkeys Twelve Monkeys An intense film about time travel, this sci-fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam, a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle. -- Michael Betzold\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nInspired by Chris Marker's benchmark 1962 short film La Jetee, director Terry Gilliam continues his examination of the real versus the surreal in this mind-bending piece of science fiction. In a vein typical of Gilliam's oeuvre, the film leaps through time almost at will, which produces uneven results. Obviously a play on genre conventions, 12 Monkeys succeeds at creating its various worlds (all with various degrees of grunge and gloom). However, the film spirals off in so many directions it's sometimes a trial to keep track -- but it's also this very quality that keeps it interesting and engaging. Very much a visceral film above all else, Gilliam extracts solid turns from his actors, including a nicely understated Bruce Willis and a cheerfully (and entertainingly) manic Brad Pitt, a surprise Oscar nominee for his supporting role. Almost ten years after the highly publicized director vs. studio debacle with the director's acclaimed 1985 film Brazil, Gilliam and Universal had obviously patched things up, as they distributed this film to great financial success and a place as one of the leading cult favorites of the 1990s. -- Jason Clark\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Costume Design (nom) - Julie Weiss - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Supporting Actor (nom) - Brad Pitt - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Supporting Actor (win) - Brad Pitt - 1995 Golden Globe 429\n\n15 Minutes English When Eastern European criminals Oleg and Emil come to New York City to pick up their share of a heist score, Oleg steals a video camera and starts filming their activities, both legal and illegal. When they learn how the American media circus can make a remorseless killer look like the victim and make them rich, they target media-savvy NYPD Homicide Detective Eddie Flemming and media-naive FDNY Fire Marshal Jordy Warsaw, the cops investigating their murder and torching of their former criminal partner, filming everything to sell to the local tabloid TV show \"Top Story.\" 256\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nA mind-bending sci-fi symphony, Stanley Kubrick's landmark 1968 epic pushed the limits of narrative and special effects toward a meditation on technology and humanity. Based on Arthur C. Clarke's story \"The Sentinel\", Kubrick's and Clarke's screenplay is structured in four movements. At the Dawn of Man, a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. To the strains of Strauss' \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\" a hominid discovers the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. As the hominid tosses the bone in the air, Kubrick cuts to a 21st- century space craft hovering over the earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development only to imply that man hasn't advanced very far at all psychologically. U.S. scientist Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moon's surface: a black monolith. As Floyd touches the mass, however, a piercing sound emitted by the object stops his fellow investigators in their path. Cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) head towards Jupiter on the space ship Discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made HAL 9000 computer running the entire ship. When the all-too-human HAL malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing Bowman to defend himself the only way he can. Free of HAL, and finally informed of the voyage's purpose by a recording from Floyd, Bowman journeys to \"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,\" through the psychedelic slit-scan Star-Gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monolith's evolutionary mission. With assistance from special effects expert Douglas Trumbull, Kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most \"realistic\" depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. Despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who \"didn't get it.\" Provocatively billed as \"the ultimate trip,\" 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative, i.e. chemically enhanced, viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free one's mind of the U.S. military-industrial-technological complex. -- Lucia Bozzola\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nStanley Kubrick rewrote the book on what a mainstream, major-studio motion picture could look, sound, and feel like with this groundbreaking work. At a time when science fiction on screen meant bug-eyed monsters menacing scantily clad women, 2001: A Space Odyssey was a visually dazzling and intellectually challenging experience. Kubrick abandoned narrative convention to tell four tangentially related stories about man's destiny, reflected in the conquest of space. Kubrick also insisted that a story set in outer space should look like it was taking place in outer space, and his special effects team (headed by Douglas Trumbull) created some of the most stunning visual effects to appear on screen before or since. Unlike the effects-laden films that followed in the wake of Star Wars, the imagery in 2001 doesn't slow the story but helps move it along, and it creates a genuine sense of wonder about the beautiful, dangerous vastness of space. Kubrick's embrace of avant-garde music and abstract visual textures brought experimental art to an audience that had no exposure to the works of such '60s avant-garde filmmakers as Stan Brakhage or Jordan Belson, and the film's resulting \"trippy\" atmosphere greatly increased its popularity (and revenue) as a late 1960s drug movie. Still as richly thought-provoking as ever, 2001: A Space Odyssey remains a watershed work in '60s cinema and lives up to its billing as \"the ultimate trip.\" -- Mark Deming\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Harry Lange - 1968 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Tony Masters - 1968 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Archer, Ernie - 1968 Academy\n\nBest Director (nom) - Stanley Kubrick - 1968 Academy\n\nBest Original Screenplay (nom) - Arthur C.

Michael Zane (Russell) and Thomas Murphy (Costner) are the leaders of a gang of ex-convict thieves using an Elvis Presley impersonator convention to pull off a daring heist in a Las Vegas casino. The gang also includes Gus (David Arquette), Hanson (Bokeem Woodbine), and Franklin (Christian Slater). Although they manage to retrieve the money, the crooks turn on each other in bloody fashion and Murphy (who believes he's actually the illegitimate son of Elvis) makes off with the illegal funds. In hot pursuit are the police and Michael, who's encumbered by his girlfriend Cybil (Courtney Cox-Arquette) and her young son Jesse James. Written and directed by music video creator Demian Lichtenstein, 3000 Miles to Graceland also stars Kevin Pollak, Ice-T, and Howie Long. -- Karl Williams\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nKevin Costner puts the finishing touches on a major career slump with this ultra-bad crime thriller that would have been passé (and just as ghastly) five years earlier. Positioned as a goofy, comic action flick, 3000 Miles to Graceland is in actuality a soulless, vile enterprise utterly devoid of human feeling or thought, chock full of pointless blood, mayhem, and carnage. The depiction of women is deplorable not just for its archaic reprehensibility but also for its sheer plot-bending senselessness. Example number one: A mother (Courtney Cox-Arquette), characterized throughout the film as loving and attentive, abandons her beloved son with a stone-cold killer for a long section of the narrative, apparently because she finds his taste for waving a gun in her face just ginchy. Example number two: In many a noir crime tale, the central anti-heroes are presented as likable simply by contrast to the sheer villainy and corruptibility of the so-called \"ordinary\" folks they encounter. In noir, everyone's on the make, a venerable conceit stretching back to Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade. The level of understanding that director Demian Lichtenstein brings to this hallowed device becomes clear in a sequence depicting Murphy (Costner) liberating a teen sex abuse victim from a loathsome gas station attendant. The teen nymphet character is speedily dropped -- in the most sexist, stomach-turning fashion imaginable -- and it becomes clear that Lichtenstein has used a narrative tradition in order to stage a really cool explosion that he can film from a variety of angles, sending the film's already jaw-dropping lack of credibility to new heights. Never has a film worked so hard to be dubbed \"Tarantino-esque,\" but unlike the films of Quentin Tarantino, which are seeped in character and dexterous plot confabulations, music video director Lichtenstein's debut feature is soaked in caricature, twisting like a dying carp all over the literal and figurative terrain of its genre, desperate to introduce some gratifying plot point while never delving deeper into any of its characters than an interstitial cartoon. Moments that are meant to play as sleek and cool, such as a stroll through a casino by Elvis-impersonating rip-off artists (in an umpteenth nod to a scene from 1983's The Right Stuff), fall hopelessly flat, making the film unintentionally hilarious and thereby entertaining in ways never planned by its creators. Virtually unwatchable, 3000 Miles to Graceland is one of the worst films of 2001 or any other year. -- Karl Williams 52\n\n8MM PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nTom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is a surveillance expert on the rise. He's living the American dream with a wife, Amy (Catherine Keener), infant daughter, and a house in the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After the completion of an assignment for a U.S. Senator, Welles is summoned to the house of a recently deceased captain of industry. His widow, in settling his estate, has discovered an 8MM film in her late husband's private safe. The silent short depicts the apparent murder of a young woman by a large, masked figure, what is known as a \"snuff\" film. Greatly disturbed by the film's contents, the widow hires Welles to find the identity of the woman and determine if she is still alive. Welles finds the girl's identity and follows her trail from the time she ran away from home to Hollywood. Once there, Welles meets adult bookstore clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) to act as Virgil to Welles' Dante. As the two begin their descent into the world of underground pornography, the detective grows more and more distant from his family, as if he cannot shake the taint of the world in which he now walks. Tom and Max eventually meet pornographers Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare) and Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini). By this time the detective finds he can no longer walk out of the inferno. -- Ron Wells\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nTo some critics, 8MM represented director Joel Schumacher hitting rock bottom after ruining the Batman franchise, with Nicolas Cage joylessly coming along for the ride. But unsavory subject matter alone is not enough to condemn this uncompromising look into the fetishistic underworld of hardcore pornography, which the viewer enters through a hardened family man and private investigator (Cage) investigating an apparent snuff film found in the private belongings of a dead billionaire. Film noir at its best, or maybe worst, 8MM gained notoriety for its perhaps unsurprising level of brutality, particularly in the frankness of the pornographic images that stretch its R rating. But Schumacher and Cage deserve some credit for the unflinching way they immerse themselves in the subject matter without apparent regard for the stain to their reputations. Furthermore, the film avoids some of the more nauseating clichés that often attend any film in which the hero's darling wife (an underused Catherine Keener) and infant daughter are among the first introduced. Its relentlessly unhappy outlook will turn off some viewers, and there are none of the stylistic advances that characterize the best in film noir. But the sheer audacity of this perverse yet fascinating topic may awaken the curiosity of those who can hold their meals down. -- Derek Armstrong 255\n\nA Clockwork Orange PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nStanley Kubrick dissects the nature of violence in this darkly ironic, near-future satire, adapted from Anthony Burgess's novel, complete with \"Nadsat\" slang. Classical music-loving proto-punk Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his \"Droogs\" spend their nights getting high at the Korova Milkbar before embarking on \"a little of the old ultraviolence,\" such as terrorizing a writer, Mr. Alexander (Patrick Magee), and raping his wife while jauntily warbling \"Singin' in the Rain.\" After he's jailed for bludgeoning the Cat Lady (Miriam Karlin) to death with one of her phallic sculptures, Alex submits to the Ludovico behavior modification technique to earn his freedom; he's conditioned to abhor violence through watching gory movies, and even his adored Beethoven is turned against him. Returned to the world defenseless, Alex becomes the victim of his prior victims, as Mr. Alexander using Beethoven's Ninth to inflict the greatest pain of all. When society sees what the state has done to Alex, however, the politically expedient move is made. Casting a coldly pessimistic view on the then-future of the late 1970s-early 1980s, Kubrick and production designer John Barry created a world of high-tech cultural decay, mixing old details like bowler hats with bizarrely alienating \"new\" environments like the Milkbar. Alex's violence is horrific, yet it is an aesthetically calculated fact of his existence; his charisma makes the icily clinical Ludovico treatment seem more negatively abusive than positively therapeutic. Alex may be a sadist, but the state's autocratic control is another violent act, rather than a solution. Released in late 1971 (within weeks of Sam Peckinpah's brutally violent Straw Dogs), the film sparked considerable controversy in the U.S. with its X-rated violence; after copycat crimes in England, Kubrick withdrew the film from British distribution until after his death. Opinion was divided on the meaning of Kubrick's detached view of this shocking future, but, whether the discord drew the curious or Kubrick's scathing diagnosis spoke to the chaotic cultural moment, A Clockwork Orange became a hit. On the heels of New York Film Critics Circle awards as Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, Kubrick received Oscar nominations in all three categories. -- Lucia Bozzola\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nAfter the visionary journey through space and time of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick offered a very different look at the future (which seemed uncomfortably close to the present) in A Clockwork Orange. But if one has to compare A Clockwork Orange to any of Kubrick's other films, it comes closest to Dr. Strangelove: for all its horrific violence and troubling moral ambiguity, it is ultimately a satire, and, like Dr. Strangelove, it wrings a shocking amount of humor from situations that few people would think of as funny. With the notable exception of Alex (Malcolm McDowell in the best performance of his career), most of the characters are little more than cartoons (with dialogue to match), while a great deal of the violence walks a fine line between \"Looney Tunes\" absurdity and crushingly vivid brutality. Kubrick's future state is often garish and ugly, veering between an amusingly hideous riot of color and texture gone wrong and the decaying remnants of a cinder-block nation (remarkably, Kubrick and production designer John Barry built only one set for the entire film, with everything else shot on existing locations that were dressed in \"futuristic\" style). And Kubrick throws in plenty of crude comic relief that suggests some degenerate variation on a Carry On film; from the overexcited school representative to the doctor and nurse enjoying recreational sex as Alex regains consciousness, Kubrick places his grim vision in an England where foolish absurdity is the order of the day. And while Alex seems one of the few characters capable of making a complex moral choice (never mind how sinister his choices happen to be), he also takes his choice more seriously than anyone else in the film. Alex has adopted violent hedonism not out of profit, politics, or pragmatism, but because he likes it, and, while this makes him difficult to admire, he's still the smartest and freest man in the film's moral universe. -- Mark Deming\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay (nom) - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 Academy\n\nBest Director (nom) - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 Academy\n\nBest Editing (nom) - Bill Butler - 1971 Academy\n\nBest Picture (nom) - 1971 Academy\n\nBest Director (nom) - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 Directors Guild of America\n\nBest Actor - Malcolm McDowell - 1971 New York Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Direction (win) - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 New York Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Film (win) - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 New York Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Screenwriting - Stanley Kubrick - 1971 New York Film Critics Circle\n\nBest Film - Stanley Kubrick - 1972 British Academy Awards\n\n100 Greatest American Movies (win) - 1998 American Film Institute 111\n\nA Man Called Hero Chungwa Yinghung PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nIn 1998, Andrew Lau's groundbreaking smash hit The Storm Riders came out of nowhere and resurrected the ailing Hong Kong film industry. Lau's follow-up, using much of the same cast and crew, is another martial arts epic set largely in New York's Chinatown. The film opens in the early 20th century with a young Hero Wah (Ekin Cheng) going to study under Master Pride (Anthony Wong). When he returns to his parents, he learns that they have been murdered by a band of evil Westerners. After impregnating his wife Jade (Kristy Yang), Hero Wah ventures to New York in search of his parents' killers. Sixteen years later, Hero's son Sword Wah (Nicholas Tse) along with family friend Sang (Jerry Lamb), arrive at Ellis Island in search of Hero's dad. Once the tearful reunion finally takes place, much of the rest of the story is related through flashbacks involving a fearsome fight with Japanese ninjas and the death of Jade at the hands of the ninja ring leader. The film climaxes a la Alfred Hitchcock or Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985) with a battle to the death against the ninja grand master at the Statue of Liberty. -- Jonathan Crow 296\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nA decade of wisecracking sequels have not diminished the power of this striking horror film from the director of Scream. Teenagers in a small town are dropping like flies, apparently in the grip of mass hysteria causing their suicides. A cop's daughter (Heather Langenkamp) traces the cause to child molester Fred Krueger (Robert Englund), who was burned alive by angry parents many years before. Krueger has now come back in the dreams of his killers' children, claiming their lives as his revenge. The teenaged leads are sympathetic and intelligent, unlike the dumb victims presented in most films of the period, and they are ably backed up by veterans like John Saxon and Ronee Blakley. Director Wes Craven creates moments of real dread by examining the line between nightmares and reality, as well as the \"sins of the parents\" theme, and although the film is quite gory, it never resorts to cheap bloodletting for its effect. A unique and disturbing experience, this film is highly recommended for horror buffs. -- Robert Firsching\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nBehold the horror epic that started the Krueger craze and the Elm Street franchise. This low-budget effort not only put frightmaster Wes Craven on the map, but it slashed new life into the dying horror genre. Nightmare on Elm Street is a surreal and artistic experiment in dark and bloody filmmaking, levitating above the senseless gorefests seen in Friday the 13th. Built upon a brilliant premise, Elm Street became known as a near-masterpiece of post-'70s terror that skillfully blurred the line between reality and fantasy. The character of Freddy Kreuger instantly joined the ranks of infamous modern horror villains. While Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers were steadfast and robotic, Freddy was a humorous sadist who refused to hide behind a mask. The dreamscape and surreal atmosphere that Craven creates is a key reason why A Nightmare on Elm Street remains so haunting to this day. Cinematographer Jacques Haitkin knows how to use shadow and light to his advantage, most notably in the trippy and eerie basement scenes and the moment in which a character is dragged across the ceiling. For a movie with a budget just over $1 million, Elm Street possesses a surprisingly stylish look; even the low-grade special effects manage to be effective. The film is tailor-made for those who like their gore coupled with smart and inventive ideas, a rarity in the horror genre. -- Adam Goldberg 124\n\nA Wind Named Amnesia Japanese A wind has swept the Earth taking all the memories from everyone.

PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nBased on the 1969 short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long by Brian Aldiss, this science fiction fantasy bears similarities to Pinocchio (1940) and originated as a long-gestating project of director Stanley Kubrick that passed to his friend Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death. Haley Joel Osment stars as David, a \"mecha\" or robot of the future, when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities, causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. The first mecha designed to experience love, David is the \"son\" of Henry (Sam Robards), an employee of the company that built the boy, and the grief-stricken Monica (Frances O'Connor). David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son, but when their natural child recovers, David is abandoned and sets out to become \"a real boy\" worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way, David is mentored by a pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a talking \"super toy\" bear named Teddy. His adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style \"Flesh Fair,\" where mechas are destroyed for the amusement of humans; Rouge City, where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and finally a submerged New York City, where David's creator William Hurt reveals the secrets of the boy's creation. Brendan Gleeson and narrator Ben Kingsley co-star in A.I., which was adapted from Kubrick's treatment by Spielberg, in his first crack at screenwriting since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). -- Karl Williams\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nA.I. is a heady, but surprisingly mournful blend of styles from two filmmakers whose disparate artistic points of view mix uncomfortably yet produce fascinating results. This highly anticipated science fiction fable is a somber meeting of Pinocchio (1940) and the dystopian visions of humankind's downfall that fueled such futuristic films as Soylent Green (1973), Logan's Run (1976), and Blade Runner (1982). Despite the obvious parallels with the Disney feature, this emotionally wrenching picaresque is a lot closer in cynical spirit to the latter films, the story's dim view of humanity's woes astonishing coming from director Steven Spielberg, whose tastes until recently ran to the sickly sentimental. Blame it on Stanley Kubrick, whose sardonic take on humankind might have made this long-simmering but aborted project even darker still, had he lived to complete it. His and Spielberg's worldviews are ill-suited bedfellows and the final result shows it: depressing but poignant, by turns silly and heartbreaking, with an ending that will either leave viewers giddy with awe or giggling with glee (or both). Still, while the film unfolds schizophrenically, it also benefits from this multiple personality aesthetic by creating a welcome, though never quite satisfied ache for the hero's woes to be assuaged. Spielberg sets viewers up for rousing psychological completion à la E.T. (1982), but channeling Kubrick, he heads for a slightly different destination. So it is that in an age when all films must, according to corporate dictates, end happily or in buckets of tears, the quiet dignity of the film's final curtain call is a stunner. Notice must be paid to young actor Haley Joel Osment, probably the best child actor since Jodie Foster and one of a miniscule handful ever to succeed on acting talent and not apple-cheeked, adorable precocity. A.I. is not the classic it should have been, but it's one of the most unusual, eccentrically enchanting films of either director's resume, and probably the biggest-budgeted experimental film ever made. -- Karl Williams\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Original Score (nom) - John Williams - 2001 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (nom) - Scott Farrar - 2001 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (nom) - Michael Lantieri - 2001 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (nom) - Dennis Muren - 2001 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (nom) - Stan Winston - 2001 Academy\n\nBest Cinematography (nom) - Janusz Kaminski - 2001 American Film Institute\n\nBest Digital Effects (nom) - Scott Farrar - 2001 American Film Institute\n\nBest Digital Effects (nom) - Dennis Muren - 2001 American Film Institute\n\nBest Production Design (nom) - Rick Carter - 2001 American Film Institute\n\nBest Supporting Actress (nom) - Frances O'Connor - 2001 American Film Institute\n\nBest Special Visual Effects (nom) - 2001 British Academy Awards\n\nBest Composer (nom) - John Williams - 2001 Broadcast Film Critics Association\n\nBest Young Actor/Actress (nom) - Haley Joel Osment - 2001 Broadcast Film Critics Association\n\nBest Director (nom) - Steven Spielberg - 2001 Golden Globes\n\nBest Original Score (nom) - John Williams - 2001 Golden Globes\n\nBest Supporting Actor (nom) - Jude Law - 2001 Golden Globes\n\n#8 Film of the Year (win) - 2001 National Board of Review 134\n\nAeon Flux English Aeon Flux is a mysterious and amoral secret agent from the country of Monica.

Chasing after the White Rabbit, who runs into view singing \"I'm Late! I'm Late!,\" Alice falls down the rabbit hole into the topsy-turvy alternate world of Wonderland. She grows and shrinks after following the instructions of a haughty caterpillar, attends a \"Very Merry Unbirthday\" party in the garden of the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, stands in awe as the Cheshire Cat spouts philosophy, listens in rapt attention as Tweedledum and Tweedledee relate the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter (a sequence usually cut when Alice is shown on TV), and closes out her day with a hectic croquet game at the home of the Red Queen. The music and production design of Alice in Wonderland is marvelous, but the film is too much of a good thing, much too frantic to do full honor to the whimsical Carroll original, and far too episodic to hang together as a unified feature film. One tactical error is having Alice weep at mid-point, declaring her wish to go home: This is Alice in Wonderland, Walt, not Wizard of Oz! Its storytelling shortcomings aside, Alice in Wonderland is superior family entertainment (never mind the efforts in the 1970s to palm off the picture as a psychedelic \"head\" film). -- Hal Erickson\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nNot fully appreciated upon its initial release by either critics or audiences, Alice in Wonderland has grown in stature over the years. Its primary failing is that its conventional approach (in both script and design) fails to capture the special dreamlike quality of the Lewis Carroll source material. However, on its own terms, the film is enormously entertaining. The animation is top-notch throughout, but especially so in the sequences involving the Cheshire Cat, the climactic card chase, Alice's many changes of size, and the wonderful Mad Hatter tea party. The actors providing the voices are extremely well cast and are responsible for a great deal of the film's success. Ed Wynn and Jerry Colonna capture the inspired lunacy of the Mad Hatter and the March Hare respectively, and Sterling Holloway is an appropriately disturbing Cheshire Cat. Kathryn Beaumont's Alice is charming, stubborn, bewildered, bossy, prissy, obedient, polite, and irritated by turns, and Beaumont makes the many swift changes believable. Also noteworthy is the score, most of which consists of very short and sometimes incomplete numbers, but still is quite beguiling. Pay special attention to the lovely \"In a World of My Own\" and the lush \"All in the Golden Afternoon.\" Although Alice in Wonderland may have been taken somewhat for granted originally, the next films for this directing triumvirate -- Peter Pan and Lady and the Tramp -- would be recognized immediately as animated classics. -- Craig Butler\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Score (nom) - Oliver Wallace - 1951 Academy\n\nCompeting Film - Hamilton Luske - 1951 Venice Film Festival\n\nCompeting Film - Clyde Geronimi - 1951 Venice Film Festival\n\nCompeting Film - Wilfred Jackson - 1951 Venice Film Festival 114\n\nAlien PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\n\"In space, no one can hear you scream.\" A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas (Tom Skerritt)'s rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company. -- Lucia Bozzola\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nCombining science fiction with horror, Swiss artist H.R. Giger's alien design and Carlo Rambaldi's visual effects creepily meld technology with corporeality, creating a claustrophobic environment that is coldly mechanical yet horribly anthropomorphized, like the metallic monster itself. Director Ridley Scott keeps the alien out of full view, hiding it in the dark or camouflaging it in the workings of the Nostromo. Signs of '70s cultural upheaval permeate Alien's future world, from the relationship between corporate capitalism and rapacious monstrosity, to the heterogeneous crew and Ripley's forceful horror heroine. The intense frights and gross-outs, however, are credited with making Alien one of the biggest hits of 1979 (it premiered on the two-year anniversary of Star Wars); Giger, Rambaldi et al. won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Alien went on to spawn three genre-bending sequels (and re-conditioned Ripleys) with exceptional '80s actioner Aliens (1986), dark prison drama Alien 3 (1992), and exotically grotesque Alien Resurrection (1997). With its atmospheric isolation, implacable monster, and whiff of social conscience, Alien stands as one of the more thoughtful yet utterly terrifying horror films of the 1970s. -- Lucia Bozzola\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Michael Seymour - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Ian Whittaker - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Roger Christian - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - Nick Allder - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - H.R.

Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last surviving crewmember of a corporate spaceship destroyed after an attack by a vicious, virtually unbeatable alien life form. Adrift in space for half a century, Ripley grapples with depression until she's informed by her company's representative, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet where her crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. Contact with the colony has suddenly been lost, and a detachment of Colonial Marines is being sent to investigate. Invited along as an advisor, Ripley predicts disaster, and sure enough, the aliens have infested the colony, leaving a sole survivor, the young girl Newt (Carrie Henn). With the soldiers picked off one by one, a final all-female showdown brews between the alien queen and Ripley, who's become a surrogate mother to Newt. Several future stars made early career appearances in Aliens (1986), including Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton and Reiser. -- Karl Williams\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nFor big-budget, high-octane showmanship, Aliens (the sequel to Alien, directed by Ridley Scott) is hard to beat. While not as deliberate or interesting as the first in the series, Aliens is a wide-open visual effect bonanza, with enough intensity and thrill for three standard action movies. Director James Cameron again proves himself more than capable when it comes to making the genre pay off. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley, but this time she's no mere survivor, she's ready to lay waste to those ultra-nasty creatures from the first movie. She's like Wonder Woman without the skimpy clothes. The female heroine in this series has always been fascinating because of her complete ignorance of her sexuality. This is given an interesting spin at the end of this film when Ripley's goal becomes to destroy the alien eggs in their nest. A slap in the face to traditional motherhood? Anyway, too much shouldn't be read into the proceedings here. The dialogue is often horrendous, and the characters other than Ripley are little more than fodder for some impressive scenes of carnage. But this remains one of the most enjoyable action movies of the mid-1980s. -- Brendon Hanley\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Actress (nom) - Sigourney Weaver - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Peter Lamont - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - Crispian Sallis - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Editing (nom) - Ray Lovejoy - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Score (nom) - James Horner - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Roy Charman - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Hartstone, Graham V. - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Carter, Michael A. - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - LeMessurier, Nicolas - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Sound Effects (win) - Sharpe, Don - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - Stan Winston - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - John Richardson - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - Bob Skotak - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Visual Effects (win) - Benson, Suzanne - 1986 Academy\n\nBest Production Design (nom) - Peter Lamont - 1986 British Academy Awards\n\nMakeup Award (nom) - Peter Robb-King - 1986 British Academy Awards\n\nSound Award (nom) - 1986 British Academy Awards\n\nVisual Effects Award (nom) - 1986 British Academy Awards\n\nBest Actress (Drama) (nom) - Sigourney Weaver - 1987 Golden Globe 431\n\nAlmost Famous English A 15 year old boy (Patrick Fugit) gets an opportunity to travel with a rock band, Stillwater (a fictional band not the actual band of the same name that was around in the late 70's) on a 1973 tour. As a younger boy, his sister (Zooey Deschanel) and his widowed mother (Frances McDormand) had fought about the mother's control over the family and her denial of rock music. The sister leaves home and leaves the young boy her record collection, which immediately seizes his attention. As a teen, he makes record reviews for an underground newspaper. He submits those to Creem magazine writer Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and gets his attention. The two become fast friends and Bangs acts as his mentor as Rolling Stone magazine comes calling. Slipping into an inner group connected with Stillwater, Rolling Stone agrees to bankroll him on a trip with the group. There he meets the \"Band Aids\", a group of girls that refuse to be called groupies because they are dedicated only to specific bands. \"Penny Lane\" (Kate Hudson), the Band Aid's leader is enamored with the group leader (Billy Crudup), but befriends the teen. He responds with complete infatuation with her, but he is equally enamored with the charismatic guitarist. While accepted by the band (other members are Jason Lee, John Fedevich and Mark Kozeleck), they nonetheless refer to him as \"the enemy - a rock critic\". This story is loosely based on writer-director Cameron Crowe's own teen rock critic adventures. Peter Frampton also acted as consultant on the film. 45\n\nAlong Came a Spider Morgan Freeman returns as forensic psychologist Dr. Alex Cross in this thriller based on the novel by James Patterson (whose work also formed the basis of the hit Kiss the Girls). Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) is a brilliant but remorseless psychopath who has landed a teaching position at an exclusive private school in Washington, D.C. Using his extensive knowledge of kidnapping (he's taught a class on Charles Lindberg), Soneji abducts one of his students - Megan (Mika Boorem), whose father Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty) is a United States senator. Ollie MacArthur (Dylan Baker), the detective investigating the case, has strong words for Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), the Secret Service agent who mistakenly let Megan slip through her fingers. But when the kidnapper contacts Dr. Cross, the psychologist is brought in on the case, and Cross seeks out Flannigan, who he believes might have a valuable insight into the case. Soon, Cross and Flannigan come to the terrible realization that this crime only represents the tip of the iceberg for the ruthless Soneji. Along Came a Spider also features Penelope Ann Miller, Jay O. Sanders, and Kim Hawthorne. -- Mark Deming\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nThe novel by best-selling author James Patterson becomes this thriller that, in the chronology of the writer's series of books featuring the character of Alex Cross, is actually a prequel to Kiss the Girls (1997). Morgan Freeman brings his usual intelligent gravity to FBI Special Agent-In-Charge role he's assayed once before, while Michael Wincott, always so memorable in villain roles, plays his genius kidnapper with a nervous, detached reserve that's a thoughtful contrast to the expected over-the-top histrionics of most cinematic antagonists. His motivations are never made clear or believable, but Wincott's Gary Soneji is sufficiently frightening in his off-kilter, wounded way. Jezzie Flannigan, as portrayed by Monica Potter, is more problematic. The actress plays the tough, smart, morally conflicted Secret Service agent as a wide-eyed runway model at best, an emotionless automaton at worst. It could be to throw the audience off in preparation for a third-act twist, but Potter lacks authenticity in a part that should have been played by a seasoned performer (such as Susan Sarandon) to provide a mature, full-bodied foil for the daunting presence of Freeman. As for the story itself, major changes from the source novel may leave Patterson fans enraged, but director Lee Tamahori provides his underrated, skillful service, keeping the pace brisk and the unanswered questions properly glossed-over. Not as artistically nutritious as The Silence of the Lambs or as good as its predecessor, Along Came a Spider is just good enough, never quite reaching the heights that everyone involved is capable of, existing instead as a proper, adequately entertaining example of its genre. -- Karl Williams 86\n\nAmadeus For this film adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Broadway hit, director Milos Forman returned to the city of Prague that he'd left behind during the Czech political crises of 1968, bringing along his usual cinematographer and fellow Czech expatriate, Miroslav Ondricek. Amadeus is an expansion of a Viennese \"urban legend\" concerning the death of 18th-century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the vantage point of an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart (Tom Hulce) first gained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young snipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieri--so disciplined, so devoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiors--not touched by God? Unable to match Mozart's talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstart's career. Disguising himself as a mysterious benefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking \"Requiem,\" which eventually costs Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the film's many pearls of dialogue, the best line goes to the Emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition on the grounds that it has \"too many notes.\" Amadeus won 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for F. Murray Abraham. -- Hal Erickson\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nAmadeus is a rarity: a dramatic film made by people who understood music as much as filmmaking. A celebration of music and genius, the film exults over Mozart's seemingly divine creations even as it refuses to canonize the man behind them. Instead, the decision to tell the story from Salieri's point of view provides a justly critical portrait of Mozart, and in so doing so it provides a commentary on genius that mines trenchant insight from resolute objectivity. That Mozart's music is beyond reproach is never called into doubt; likewise, that the man himself could be utterly reproachful is also beyond question. Paradox is at the film's core, both in the presentation of Mozart and his music, and in the character of Salieri, who managed to be both Mozart's greatest fan and most punishing detractor. In making this sort of paradox its central theme, Amadeus is one of the most illuminating pictures of genius ever committed to celluloid. Part of its brilliance lies in its principal performances: in Tom Hulce's Mozart, we see a man equally un-self-conscious about his genius and his vulgarity, and in F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning Salieri, we see the tragedy that results from the inability of talent to live up to desire. These performances are lavishly complemented by the music in question, a forceful character in its own right. Part of Forman's great acheivement as the film's director was bringing this music to millions who had never set foot inside of an opera house or theatre, with a passion and immediacy that could appeal to a much wider audience than just classical music enthusiasts. -- Rebecca Flint\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Actor (nom) - Tom Hulce - 1984 Academy\n\nBest Actor (win) - F.

We see her grow up in an original if slightly dysfunctional family. Now a waitress in central Paris, she interacts curiously with her neighbors and customers, as well as a mysterious Photomaton-image collector and one of his even more mysterious photo subjects. Little by little, Amelie realizes that the way to happiness (and yet more subtle humor) requires here to take her own initiative and reach out to others. 428\n\nAmerican Beauty English Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is suffering a mid-life crisis that affects the lives of his family which is made up of his super bitch of a wife Carolyn and rebelling daughter Jane who hates him. Carolyn is a real estate agent a little too wrapped up in her job who takes on an affair with business rival Buddy Kane. Meanwhile Jane seems to fall in love with Ricky Fitts, the strange boy next door who is a drug dealer/documentarian who lives under a roof governed by a very strict marine father and a speechless mother. Lester's mid-life crisis causes him to drastically change his life around when he quits his job and works at a fast food restaurant. He starts working out to gain the attention of Angela, a friend of Jane's who brags about her sexual exploits every weekend. Lives change and not for the best. 292\n\nAmerican History X PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nTony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private \"American History X\" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek. Director Tony Kaye, with a background in TV commercials and music videos, filmed in L.A. beach communities. Rated R \"for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality and nudity.\" -- Bhob Stewart\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nEdward Norton is absolutely riveting as the menacing skinhead at the center of American History X, in the controversial star-making performance that earned him his second Oscar nomination. Among many impressive feats the actor pulls off in the role of Derek Vinyard, Norton packs on so much bulk that he is virtually unrecognizable from his debut as the scrawny schizophrenic in Primal Fear two years earlier. Standing shirtless with his hands behind his ears, at police gunpoint, Norton radiates the righteous hatred of a monster in the body of a tattooed Adonis. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not equal to Norton's buff acting chops and searing presence. It ventures into shocking territory and presents violent images that can't be unseen, but it also resolves core issues in simplistic ways that are out of synch with its uncompromising intensity. The way the script handles Vinyard's unlikely prison mea culpa is especially scant, as though only the hatred were interesting enough to warrant serious treatment. Director Tony Kaye deserves credit for bringing a crisp look to the project, including the black-and-white flashback sequences that underscore Norton's talent and accentuate the rawness of the film's themes. But American History X could benefit from some subtlety in its handling of the complexity of bigotry, as well as its ultimate repudiation. A film clearly meant to make audiences reevaluate their prejudices, American History X is too extreme for viewers to meaningfully extrapolate its message to their own lives. -- Derek Armstrong\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Actor (nom) - Edward Norton - 1998 Academy 199\n\nAmerican History X English Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) returns from prison to find his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), caught in the same web of racism and hatred. After Derek and Danny's father is killed in the line of duty by a minority, Derek's view of mankind is altered. While in prison, Derek discovers that there is good and bad in every race. Now the task before him is to convince his brother of his new found enlightenment. 285\n\nAmerican Nightmare PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nFacing ones fears becomes a death warrant in this independent horror film. It's Halloween, and a group of friends who earlier spent some time discussing their favorite horror movies find themselves listening to an underground radio station, which is presenting a call-in show in which listeners are encouraged to discuss their deepest fears for the benefit of the audience. While the twenty-something bohemians call in with the hopes of being purged of their anxieties, a different fate awaits them -- an unbalanced former nurse (Debbie Rochon) is also listening to the show, and she sets out to track down each caller, and murder them in a manner that reflects their worst fear. American Nightmare also stars Chris Ryan, Brandy Little, and Johnny Sneed. -- Mark Deming 226\n\nAmerican Pie English At a high-school party, four friends (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) find that losing their collective virginity isn't as easy as they had thought. But they still believe that they need to do so before college. To motivate themselves, they enter a pact to try to be the first to \"score.\" And of course, the senior prom is their last best chance. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all? 263\n\nAmerican Pie 2 - Unrated English After their first year at college, the guys reunite for another summer of fun. Jim continues his quest for sexual independence by seeking the help of his old prom date, Michele, after an unexpected call from Nadia who plans to visit Jim. Meanwhile, Kev and Vicky find themselves in an awkward situation after having broken up for a year. Oz must deal with a long distance relationship when Heather heads off to France to study abroad. Old feuds die hard as the ever-so-horny Stifler harbors his hatred toward Finch, who is practicing the Japanese art of Tantra. 196\n\nAmerican Psycho English Patrick Bateman is a homicidal maniac working on the New York stock exchange. His reasons for killing are debatable, such as extreme envy of fellow co-workers, material obsession, pure hatred or simply no other reason than complete insanity. His lunacy escalates throughout the film, killing at least 20 people in the process, including models, homeless people, co-workers, friends, and anyone else who stands in his way, be it rage, jealousy, or something else. The only person who he seems to sympathise with is his secretary, Jean, who eventually he can't help but have a desire to murder her. Many times, Patrick can't tell whether these events are real, or simply part of a psychotic delusion brought on by his problems. 346\n\nAmerican Psycho 2 English Patrick's gone and a girl that survived him is now killing everyone so she can be a college professor's assistant. (view trailer) 169\n\nAngela's Ashes English Based on the best selling autobiography by Irish expat Frank McCourt, Angela's Ashes follows the experiences of young Frankie and his family as they try against all odds to escape the poverty endemic in the slums of pre-war Limerick. The film opens with the family in Brooklyn, but following the death of one of Frankie's siblings, they return home, only to find the situation there even worse. Prejudice against Frankie's Northern Irish father makes his search for employment in the Republic difficult despite his having fought for the IRA, and when he does find money, he spends the money on drink. 20\n\nAnimal Farm George Orwell's political fable about corruption and betrayal in post-revolutionary Russia gets a new look in this version that employs a cast of real animals alongside digitally manipulated critters and lifelike beasts crafted by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. At the Manor Farm, the alcoholic master Mr. Jones (Pete Postlethwaite) is cruel to his animals and has horribly mismanaged the property. One night, the wise but elderly pig Old Major (voice of Peter Ustinov) gathers the animals and speaks of a remarkable dream, in which the animals throw off their tyrannical human masters and learn to reap the fruits of their own labors. After Old Major's death, two other pigs, Snowball (voice of Kelsey Grammer) and Napoleon (voice of Patrick Stewart) lead a revolution that drives Jones from his land and leaves the animals in charge of their own destiny. After their revolt, Snowball and Napoleon rule side by side, but Napoleon soon becomes drunk with power and squeezes Snowball out of authority, eventually turning the other animals against him. With Boxer (voice of Paul Scofield), a simple-minded but loyal and physically powerful horse, as a role model, Napoleon leads the animals on a campaign of self-denial and hard work that will bring them security and freedom; however, it soon becomes obvious that Napoleon is growing fat while the other animals are starving, and he is quickly becoming the sort of creature he once waged war against. Animal Farm received its American premiere on the TNT cable TV network in October 1999; it opened as a theatrical release in several other countries shortly afterward. -- Mark Deming\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nIn this 1999 adaptation of George Orwell's Animal Farm, special effects coax farm animals to speak out against tyranny and reenact the 1917 Russian Revolution. Studio wizardry turns real and almost-real pigs, ducks, chickens, and sheep into lip-synching actors portraying political heroes, villains, and the easily led hoi polloi. However, the dramatis personae lack the sassy vibrancy of cartoon characters. Moreover, close-ups of Old Major, the Lenin figure personified by the voice of Peter Ustinov, and Napoleon, the Stalin figure personified by the voice of Patrick Stewart, reveal these two pigs as little more than slobbering machines. When the jaws of either pig move, the viewer wonders how much gadgetry Jim Henson's Creature Shop used to create the illusion. In the end, what the film gives the audience is artificial realism that deadens the characters and reduces them to high-tech puppets. Consequently, the characters cannot generate the kind of hyperbole and whimsy that animate cartoon characters and make fantasy fun. During the 90-minute running time of the film, director John Stephenson and producer Robert Halmi Sr. generally adhere to the plot of Orwell's 1947 novel satirizing the excesses of communism. But they do take liberties on occasion, most notably when they show the collapse of the Animal Farm wall to symbolize the fall of the Berlin Wall. The solemn, humorless atmosphere pervading the production tends to make viewers yearn for a Daffy Duck or a Pluto to enliven it. -- Mike Cummings 216\n\nApocalypse Now English Burnt out Captain Willard is sent into the jungle with orders to find and kill Colonel Kurtz who has set up his own army within the jungle. As he descends into the jungle he is slowly over taken by the jungles mesmerizing powers and the battles and insanity which surround him. His crew begins to succumbs to drugs and are slowly killed off one by one. As Willard continues his journey he begins to become more and more like the man he was sent to kill. 32\n\nApocalypse Now PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nOne of a cluster of late-1970s films about the Vietnam War, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now adapts the Joseph Conrad novella Heart of Darkness to depict the war as a descent into primal madness. Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), already on the edge, is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local, lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild, reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtz's compound, he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtz's insane dictum to \"Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all.\" Coppola himself was not certain either, and he tried several different endings between the film's early rough-cut screenings for the press, the Palme d'Or-winning \"work-in-progress\" shown at Cannes, and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches, which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself, have been superbly captured in the documentary, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. Despite the studio's fears and mixed reviews of the film's ending, Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Duvall's psychotic Kilgore, and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. This hallucinatory, Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made, and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era. -- Lucia Bozzola\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nFilmmaking masterpieces are often products of fate rather than design, and while Francis Ford Coppola's fierce ambition to create a great work of art is obvious in Apocalypse Now, the same ambition often threatens to crush the picture under its own weight. Apocalypse Now is an elaborate but often haphazard construction that starts to run out of gas at the three-quarter point without delivering a satisfying ending, and Marlon Brando's often lackadaisical performance as Col. Kurtz never lives up to the massive buildup the story gives it. And yet there are moments as powerful as anything Coppola (or anyone else) ever put on screen, and there are enough of them to make the film a flawed but unmistakable triumph. The air attack set to Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries and the Battle at Do Lung Bridge capture the terror and madness of war as few films have, and the further Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) and his men travel up the river, the deeper they are drawn into a surreal nightmare where right and wrong, danger and security, past and present, have begun to blur. Coppola also drew a superb performance from Martin Sheen as Willard; a fine but inconsistent actor, Sheen rarely had a role as good as Willard, and he rises to the occasion. There's also excellent supporting work from Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, G.D. Spradlin, and particularly Albert Hall, who, as Chief, has the burden of being the sole unambiguously disciplined and dedicated soldier in the film. Coppola was famously quoted as saying \"This isn't a film about Viet Nam, this film is Viet Nam.\" If, like that war, Apocalypse Now doesn't quite achieve its objective, it comes close enough to stand as Coppola's last great film. -- Mark Deming\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay (nom) - Francis Ford Coppola - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay (nom) - John Milius - 1979 Academy\n\nBest Art Direction (nom) - George R.

Drenched in director Michael Bay's signature orange hues and amber waves of grain, Armageddon bogs itself down in an unbelievably silly romantic subplot with wide-eyed lovers Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that is actually harder to stomach than its hackneyed and contrived space logic. Bruce Willis employs his trademark scowl here, but the movie has some expert components, namely Billy Bob Thornton's measured, intelligent turn as a NASA honcho and an amusing Owen Wilson as one of our unlikely heroes. The film contains a certain dumb charm, but that's hardly a reason to make it memorable. Interestingly, the film was a box-office smash in America and overseas, despite it being the oft-cited example of Hollywood soullessness by critics all over the nation, who deplore its quick-cutting, fast-food sensibilities. -- Jason Clark\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Original Song (nom) - Diane Warren - 1998 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Keith A.

Back on Earth, as mini-asteroids pelt Paris and Shanghai, humanity hopes and prays for a successful mission. -- Bhob Stewart\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nExactly what you'd expect from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of action extravaganzas, this gargantuan asteroid-hitting-Earth tale works on its own blockbuster terms, but offers nothing that countless other big-budget offerings haven't. Drenched in director Michael Bay's signature orange hues and amber waves of grain, Armageddon bogs itself down in an unbelievably silly romantic subplot with wide-eyed lovers Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that is actually harder to stomach than its hackneyed and contrived space logic. Bruce Willis employs his trademark scowl here, but the movie has some expert components, namely Billy Bob Thornton's measured, intelligent turn as a NASA honcho and an amusing Owen Wilson as one of our unlikely heroes. The film contains a certain dumb charm, but that's hardly a reason to make it memorable. Interestingly, the film was a box-office smash in America and overseas, despite it being the oft-cited example of Hollywood soullessness by critics all over the nation, who deplore its quick-cutting, fast-food sensibilities. -- Jason Clark\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Original Song (nom) - Diane Warren - 1998 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Keith A.

He is assigned a very unorthodox partner named Naomi Armitage, who seems to have links to the victims. To stir things up more, every victim is found to be an illegally made third-generation android, built to be almost perfect replications of humans. It becomes a race against time when the government attempts to cover up the existence of the 'Third Types', and eliminate the only ones with the evidence. And even more importantly, why are the Thirds created to be so similar to humans, even to the extent of being indistinguishable from them on every level, mentally and biologically? 325\n\nArmy of Darkness English In the third film of \"The Evil Dead\" series, our gun-totting, chainsaw-handed hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell), has been transported to England in the 13th century where he has been prophesized as the one who will find the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, and deliver the people from the terrors of the Deadites, who quest for the book, too. But he is mistaken as a spy from a rival kingdom and forced to fight two Deadites before the people find out what he is here for. He also falls for a woman named Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) before he searches for the book. But after finding it, he says the wrong words that will allow the wisemen to use the book to send him back and stop the Deadites and accidentally awakens the Army of the Dead, led by his clone, Evil Ash. Now, Ash must use his 20th century wits and skills to beat Evil Ash and his army of skeletons. 49\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nThe first Disney cartoon to be produced in the 70 mm format since The Black Cauldron (1985), this blend of traditional animation with computer-generated imagery is a straight adventure tale of the Jules Verne school, eschewing the studio's typical formula of cute critters mixed with song-and-dance routines. Michael J. Fox is the voice of Milo Thatch, a lowly museum employee and linguist in the early 20th century who's determined to continue his late grandfather's search for the lost, sunken empire of Atlantis. Bankrolled by eccentric millionaire Preston Whitmore (John Mahoney), Milo teams up with a diverse crew of mercenaries led by submarine commander Rourke (James Garner). After a sea battle with a giant denizen of the deep, the explorers locate the submerged civilization. Milo falls in love with Princess Kida (Cree Summer), the daughter of Atlantis' aged ruler (Leonard Nimoy), and must choose sides when it's revealed that some of his fellow expedition members intend to steal a mystical energy source from their hosts. Claudia Christian, Mark Hamill, David Ogden Stiers, Don Novello, and the late Jim Varney co-star. Although considered a shoo-in for a nomination in the debut year of the new Oscar category of Best Animated Feature, Atlantis: The Lost Empire faced stiff competition from other non-live-action entertainment in the summer of 2001, including Shrek, Final Fantasy, and Monsters Inc.. -- Karl Williams\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nFor years, mature audiences have longed for a Disney animated feature that didn't place furry critters singing pop songs front and center. While this long-anticipated effort to create just such a story for the PG-13 crowd is occasionally quite entertaining, it comes up a bit short. An attack sequence by an aquatic robot monster that resembles the offspring of a squid mated to a lobster is particularly effective, as is a climactic battle atop a hot air balloon rising from the bowels of a volcano. The problem is that too much time is wasted in the interim on introducing a populous supporting cast of characters who don't end up adding much to the proceedings. Comic relief players such as a French \"digger\" known as Mole (Corey Burton) and a rootin' tootin' cowboy cook named, imaginatively, Cookie (the late Jim Varney) become quickly irksome, leaving the film's female lead Kida (Cree Summer) almost a cameo role. The film's truncated running time, kept within the \"under 90 minutes,\" toddler-friendly dictum that has ruled the Disney roost for decades, doesn't do much service to the story either. It was a bold decision to let the characters take their time finding the lost city, but at that point the film's half over and what follows feels rushed and forced. Atlantis: The Lost Empire has all the makings of a classy sci-fi epic for animation fans, but like Titan A.E. (2000) before it, the studio's effort to be all things to all audience demographics results in a film that never quite coalesces into a story about which any one specific group of viewers can care. -- Karl Williams 37\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Austin Powers -- fashion photographer, denizen of Swingin' London, international espionage agent, and bane of dental hygienists everywhere -- returns in his second screen adventure. Powers (once again played by Mike Myers), a 1960s superspy stranded in the 1990s, discovers that his nemesis, criminal genius Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), has somehow stolen his \"mojo\" (the secret to his otherwise inexplicable sex appeal) and traveled back in time to the 1960s as part of his latest fiendish scheme. Powers must also travel back in time to retrieve it, but if Austin doesn't quite fit into 1998, he's been there just long enough not to fit in in 1968 anymore, either. Powers also discovers that Dr. Evil has new allies this time: Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a clone of Dr. Evil one-eighth his size but just as nasty; Fat Bastard (Myers yet again), whose name describes him just fine; and vixenish assassin Robin Swallows (Gia Carides). Powers' lack of mojo also proves troublesome when he's paired with his new partner, saucy CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Other characters returning from the first film include Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me also includes cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Woody Harrelson, and Burt Bacharach with his current songwriting partner, Elvis Costello. -- Mark Deming\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me may not have been half the unexpectedly enjoyable romp of the original, but it doubled the character's pop culture prominence and the vernacular use of the phrases \"Yeah, baby!\" and \"Do I make you horny?\" In fact, rarely has there been such a widely mimicked film icon as Austin Powers, even if the most inspired bits from these films concern the fey supervillain Dr. Evil, also played by Mike Myers. It's a testament to the blind affection accorded this franchise that the sequel's most celebrated character is Mini Me, played by the vertically challenged Verne Troyer, who turned into such a stature-defying popular curiosity that he became the shortest man since Tom Cruise to get so much work. Audiences were so giddy to plunk themselves back into that free-lovin' world of shagadelic goofiness, they didn't even notice that many of the jokes were essentially repeated, or that the improvisation level was shockingly high. All that mattered was Myers returning in both brilliant roles, plus a third (the sweaty Fat Bastard), and Heather Graham filling the eye-candy role vacated by Elizabeth Hurley. The movie hits its funniest strides when reveling in its anachronistic cultural references, such as Dr. Evil covering Will Smith's paternal ode \"Just the Two of Us,\" or aping Jerry Maguire by telling his miniature self, \"You complete me.\" Capable of enormous feats at the box office, as well as getting incredible mileage from kitsch, the Austin Powers series should be healthy for as long as Myers wants to continue coining catch phrases. -- Derek Armstrong\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Makeup (nom) - Mike Smithson - 1999 Academy\n\nBest Makeup (nom) - Michele Burke - 1999 Academy\n\nBest Original Song (nom) - Madonna - 1999 Golden Globe\n\nBest Original Song (nom) - William Orbit - 1999 Golden Globe 295\n\nBackyard Dogs PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nThe wild and colorful world of backyard wrestling provides the backdrop for this action comedy. Cole (Scott Hamm) and Lee (Walter Emanuel Jones) are two close friends who love professional wrestling and hope to make it onto the pro circuit themselves some day. Everybody has to start somewhere, and Cole and Lee soon become involved in the underground world of amateur backyard wrestling, in which grappling hopefuls do body slams and piledrivers next to the picnic table or the storage shed. Cole and Lee start making a name for themselves among backyard wrestling fans, and they soon begin working with aspiring manager Kristy (Bree Turner), a smart and sexy girl who soon makes Cole and Lee the talk of the Internet. But as Cole and Lee's star rises, they discover a lot more fighters are interested in taking them down a few notches, and the competition only gets tougher as they become more successful. -- Mark Deming 445\n\nBad Guy (Korean) Korean 155\n\nBarefoot Gen Japanese Gen and his family are living in Hiroshima as Japan nears the end of World War II. Gen's father has come to believe that the war is unwinnable, thus earning the wrath of the town officials and, in turn, discrimination from the rest of their neighbors. Shunned by the local merchants and tradesmen, food becomes scarce for Gen and his family. All these concerns soon pale, however, as the American military begins its final assault on Japan with the unleashing of its terrible new weapon. 100\n\nBASEketball PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nDavid Zucker directed this slapstick sports comedy starring South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Competing two-on-two against some basketball jocks, goofballs Joe Cooper (Parker) and Doug Remer (Stone) attempt to win by devising new rules while they play. Thus is born the bizarre game of \"BASEketball.\" Rules: Court position decides whether a sunk basket counts as a single, a home run, or whatever; the opposing team can retrieve missed shots. Verbal abuse is allowed. Ditto for gross-outs -- or anything to annoy the shooter. The game becomes popular in driveways, so sports promoter Ted Denslow (Ernest Borgnine) proposes a deal to form a pro league. Dallas Felons owner Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn), hopes to increase revenues with product placements and pro endorsements, but he needs the okay of team owners. Ted dies during the season finals, leaving Cain to deal with his widow Yvette (Jenny McCarthy). However, Ted willed the team to Cooper, who must win the upcoming season or ownership goes to Yvette. Cameos by Bob Costas and Al Michaels. -- Bhob Stewart\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nTV bad boys Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring their signature style of juvenile, naughty potty humor to this sports comedy that, except for a winning prologue, never reaches the absurd heights or withering satire of the duo's best work. In fact, BASEketball isn't really even as funny as director David Zucker's other films in the Naked Gun series. With his tale of two all-American mutts who invent the new national pastime, Zucker seems to have something critical he wants to say about the increasingly corporate nature of pro sports. Whatever it is, the message is lost in the midst of an overly busy plot wrought by a quartet of scribes (multiple writers are rarely a positive sign in feature filmmaking) and a crippling number of momentum-wrecking star cameos. Parker and Stone don't share too much in the culpability (the film isn't written by them), leaving fans to pine for the more observant, piercing, and wickedly offbeat project that could have been if only the duo had stronger involvement. Under their narrative guidance, BASEketball still wouldn't have been for everyone, but at least it would have been for someone. -- Karl Williams 301\n\nBasic Instinct English Former rock star and San Francisco nightclub owner Johnny Boz is found murdered in his bed. Detective Nick Curran is assigned to the case; he has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse although he is clean now. The prime suspect is Catherine Tramell, an attractive and manipulative novelist who had been seeing Boz for a while. Police psychiatrist Beth Gardner (who happens to be Nick's ex-girlfriend) is brought in on the case when it is discovered that Boz's murder was copied directly from one of Catherine's novels. Nick starts to get too involved and everyone seems to be a suspect. 67\n\nBatman Forever Director Joel Schumacher inherited the Batman franchise from Tim Burton and began steering it in the campier direction of the Sixties television show with this third installment. First-time Batman/Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer), in his only outing as the Caped Crusader, is effectively brooding as he ponders strange dreams about his parents' death and escapes his own near-demise at the hands of Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), a former district attorney driven insane and turned into a master criminal when a gangster throws acid in his face. Meanwhile, as sexy psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) tries to analyze and seduce both Bruce Wayne and Batman, Wayne Enterprises employee Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) reacts badly to getting fired, using his self-invented mind-energy device to transform into the super-intelligent Riddler. The Riddler teams up with Two-Face to bring down Batman and drain the minds of Gotham City residents with his device, while Batman gets some much-needed help in the form of circus performer Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), out for vengeance after being orphaned by Two-Face. -- Don Kaye\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nWhile it hadn't yet sunk into the mire of Batman and Robin, the Batman franchise was well on its way with this third installment, the first directed by Joel Schumacher. After two dark chapters that each explored new territory, arguably improving in quality and thematic juiciness with the feminist slant of Batman Returns, Batman Forever sorely misses the presence of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton, who jumped ship before the ideas dried up. It's much more a platform for Jim Carrey than the adequate but dull Val Kilmer, finally permitting Carrey to sink his teeth into the super-villain he was born to play, in turn granting him license to overact his heart out. But for all of Carrey's undeniable gusto, the performance doesn't come close to making the movie. Whether there should have been more of Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face is debatable, since he's not very interesting, but even with more screen time, he still would have contributed the least of any Batman villain to date. Batman Forever shows the strain of trying to do too much with too little inspiration, and the diminishing returns of scraping the bottom of the barrel for previously unused villains, whose powers are pretty fringe by this point. The film's goofy title, which sounds like an overconfident political slogan, is a hint that Schumacher wanted mindless fun to replace the psychological brooding of Burton's movies. But Batman is better when he's profoundly disturbed, when there's not so much window dressing to distract from his tortured heroism. -- Derek Armstrong\n\nAWARDS:\n\nBest Cinematography (nom) - Stephen Goldblatt - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Michael Herbick - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Mitchell, Donald O. - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Sound (nom) - Montano, Frank A. - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Sound Effects (nom) - Bruce Stambler - 1995 Academy\n\nBest Sound Effects (nom) - Leveque, John - 1995 Academy 239\n\nBeastie Boys Video Anthology.

As the film progresses the story of their lives unfolds, as well as we learn how the wrestling industry is not the plastic-weapons fake-slap sideshow that many have perceived it as. We are shown how moves, although not actually injuring anyone, are not fake, and extreme training is required to be able to perform the stunts without being harmed. We are also treated to interviews with the family of Mick Foley and what it is like for them to know their father literally puts his life on the line every week and how it feels to have other children call their father a \"fake\". Vince McMahon, owner of World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, also makes a few appearances, responding to criticism on various wrestling situations, including, once again, his real athletes very real orginization being called fake by sources such as USA Today and various news programs. 460\n\nBig Fat Liar English A take on the classic tale 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf', 'Big Fat Liar' is about a 14-year-old boy named Jason Shephard (Frankie Muniz) who lies for the fun of it.

The teen liar then has to match wits with Wolf, who also turns out to be a big liar. 265\n\nBig Hit, The English Melvin Smiley, a successful young hitman, is living a normal all-day life for his jewish fiancé Pam, but kills for money in Paris' organization.

Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire. -- Bhob Stewart\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nIt took a quarter-century, but the Marvel Comics vampire-slayer created by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan finally hit the big screen, and it was worth the wait. Wesley Snipes is terrific as the half-vampire Blade, fighting the undead legions with the aid of a high-tech arsenal manufactured by his crusty partner, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Stephen Dorff is equally memorable as the villainous half-breed Frost, planning to usurp the more genteel purebred vampires in order to destroy and enslave the human race. But he needs Blade's blood to call an ancient vampire-god first. The action scenes are dynamite, Greg Cannom's bloody special-effects are suitably outlandish to match the comic-book tone, and there are some nice bits by cult favorites Udo Kier and Traci Lords along the way. It's not a straight horror film, as its numerous fight scenes and hyperbolic mythologizing make clear, but -- despite its comic-book roots -- it is still another of 1998's releases to push the \"R\" rating to its limit with blood-soaked violence. Viewers with strong stomachs and a yen for a very dark take on the Mortal Kombat-style of filmmaking should, however, be extremely pleased. -- Robert Firsching 461\n\nBlade II English A rare mutation has occurred within the vampire community. The Reaper. A vampire so consumed with an insatiable bloodlust that they prey on vampires as well as humans, transforming victims who are unlucky enough to survive into Reapers themselves. Now their quickly expanding population threatens the existence of vampires, and soon there won't be enough humans in the world to satisfy their bloodlust. Blade, Whistler (Yes, he's back) and an armory expert named Scud are curiously summoned by the Shadow Council. The council reluctantly admits that they are in a dire situation and they require Blade's assistance. Blade then tenuously enters into an alliance with The Bloodpack, an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat. Blade's team and the Bloodpack are the only line of defense which can prevent the Reaper population from wiping out the vampire and human populations. 323\n\nBlood: The Last Vampire English Japan, 1966. Saya is part of a secret team destroying daemons. She is sent undercover as a student at the American air base in Yokota, just before Halloween. She discovers that two of her classmates are vampires in disguise just as they are preparing to attack the school nurse; meanwhile, her colleagues have discovered another vampire acting as a bartender in the local red-light district. A spectacular battle ensues. 212\n\nBoogie Nights English Eddie Adams would have been just another high school drop out had he not met the likes of adult film director, Rick Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set as taking place in the late 1970's and early 1980, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era. 102\n\nBoys Don't Cry PLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nBased on a true story, this drama was adapted from the life of Brandon Teena, born Teena Brandon, a woman who chose to live her life as a man and suffered tragic consequences as a result. In 1993, 20-year-old Brandon (Hilary Swank) leaves Lincoln, Nebraska for the nearby community of Falls City, where she sports a crew cut, favors jeans and boots, and is regarded as a man by most of the people in town. While Brandon's friend Lonny (Matt McGrath) warns her that sexual outsiders aren't looked upon kindly in Falls City, she develops a reputation for being something of a ladies' man, and is soon living with a single mother named Candace (Alicia Goranson). But when Brandon meets teenage Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the two become romantically involved almost immediately. Brandon makes friends with Lana's mother (Jeanetta Arnette) and a burly ex-con named John (Peter Sarsgaard). John and his buddy Tom (Brendan Sexton) run with a rough group of men who like to drink and carouse, and they accept Brandon as one of their own. However, when Brandon ends up in jail on a traffic violation, her secret comes out, and, while Lana stands by Brandon's side, John and Tom feel betrayed -- and their anger soon boils over into violence. A distinguished feature debut for director Kimberly Peirce, Boys Don't Cry was enthusiastically received in its showings at 1999 film festivals in Venice, Toronto, and New York. -- Mark Deming\n\nAMG REVIEW:\n\nWith what was possibly the most acclaimed independent debut film since Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, first-time director Kimberly Peirce paints an unforgettable portrait of small-town doldrums and gender identity crisis, using the harrowing tale of Teena Brandon, a young Nebraska girl who successfully passed herself off as a male, resulting in a violent attack on her life. Expertly realized by Peirce, the film is straightforward, uncompromised filmmaking, and smartly removes any traces of martyrdom or cheap sentiment in exploring its fascinating lead case study. More than any film about gender identity preceding it, Boys doesn't resort to needless exposition in order to translate the story to the uninitiated. This factor is best actualized by the film's sterling cast, including Hilary Swank in a mesmerizing, dexterous performanc"
