        "text": "@Woderwick Haha oh no offense taken I'm absolutely very close to the stereotypical obsessive Sonic fan. I have an unreasonably large and valuable collection of 32 years worth of Sonic related tat and its the #1 thing I'm likely to drop the masking and go on a fully autistic rant about. There are a handful of things I'm very passionate about but Sonic is the only thing others have described as being \"like your religion\" 😂 I was so trepidacious about the first Sonic movie that I cried in the cinema when I realised I actually thought it was quite good. I also cried when Amy was anounced as playable in Sonic Origins Plus. I'm aware this is very irrational behaviour for a guy in his 40s. But I just love these characters and worlds.\n\nMy birthday was last week and my mum asked what I wanted, I asked for a very specific cover variant of a one-shot Sonic comic book, and a physical copy of a Sonic game that I already own several times, because it has different regional artwork on the cover. On the day, my mother very patiently listened to me explaining excitedly exactly why each one was so cool and important, probably for a good 2 hours before I realised she was probably just being polite and there was no way she could possibly understand why this meant anything to me. 🤣\n\nOver the years I've written many articles, helped with many youtube videos, even tv shows about Sonic... I have an ongoing documentary project about Sonic history with many big names involved... I'm also making my own Sonic fangame collection of remakes and reimaginings of all the classic games with the features and characters that fans most request but Sega always leave out... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvTiAmOH8MM allegedly for the fans, but mostly because its something I really, really want to exist. 😅\n\nI say that I'm \"very close to\" the steroetypical fan, in that I'm at least rational and able to perfectly understand exactly why some people dislike Sonic, why certain games, shows and comics are \"bad\", how it became somewhat of a meme and some Sonic fans got a reputation as being a little... um... unusual? I don't blindly think everything Sonic is good, far from it. But I root for the brand and characters over all, and right now as a (somewhat long suffering) fan I'm very happy with the direction everything is going. I've not felt this confident in the overall quality of Sonic media since the 90s.\n\nAnd no I haven't played Superstars yet... I've edited what I wrote to try and make that clearer. I was just summarisied all the reviews. But for an experienced player familiar with the nuances of everything involved, I don't need to play it to know that the physics and controls are just right, and that I love the graphics and music, and level themes. So for me who just wants \"more classic Sonic\"... its an easy 9/10 unless anything unforseen ruins that. I don't care about the specific emerald powers or the co-op mode, they are just nice novelties tacked on to the game I actually want.\n\nI think co-op could be highly broken but a right laugh and great fun with mates and a few beers sat around the couch, or fun for families to play together. But there's no way in heck it will be a balanced experience, Sonics speed and branching paths don't allow that for the exact reasons you pointed out. The reason I've not mentioned my opinion on this before is firstly its a minor feature in the game to me, and this is also how I've felt about other games that other people absolutely love, so I thought maybe its just me?\n\nFor example back in the day, everyone raved about how great the MicroMachines games were in multiplayer - and I've never understood that. Constantly stopping and starting every time someone went off screen just seems madness to me for a top down racing game where there is no way all 4 cars will be at the same speed. It never made sense to me, and it plays really disjointedly. Yet I didn't care because I like the 1 player experience a lot and the creativity of the environments really sparked my imagination. I didn't enjoy the multiplayer aspect for the same reason I think that Sonic multiplayer on a single screen won't work... I think my issue is, for me, both Sonic and racing games are about speed and smoothness, so the stop start nature is jarring. But I've stayed quiet as I'm sure other people will enjoy it, just like seemingly everyone but me loved multiplayer MicroMachines. For me, the single player is what I'm focusing on, and it looks perfect for my taste 😀\n\n@Mgalens From what I've seen, the Switch version plays great, almost entirely 60fps in the capture footage I've analysed (yes I downloaded the videos and opened them in editing software to check for frame drops... I'm aware this is beyond nerdy) however that was all footage that was officially put out there by Sega so I'm sure if there are areas where it doesn't perform as well, they would strategically not include them. But basically, I'm confident it will mostly play smoothly. The graphics are noticably cut back but I still think they look really nice and I'm happy they prioritised framerate over some fancy shaders or particle effects.\n\nIf I'm 100% candid, bosses are always my least favourite part of any platform game. For me, its all about the speed or fluidity of movement, and exploring new environments. I find it hard to know when a Sonic boss is \"good\" or \"bad\" - I prefer them to be visually interesting, but easy and over soon so I can explore the next zone. I've not watched any full playthroughs of the game yet, I'm waiting to experience them myself. Before SAGE this year I played a lot of the best/most professional 2d Sonic fangames from recent times and for me, some of them were as good if not better than some official games, but the bosses were always the things that I felt held them back. Boss design is seemingly hard to get exactly in that sweet spot.\n\nIn my own big platform adventure, I've somewhat cheated in that there are mini bosses of more powerful characters that you meet along the way, but the handful of actual \"boss fights\" that stop you progressing further in the story play like big eventful turn based FF battles, so that if you find any particular boss too hard, you can go and grind and build your XP, or buy more potions, craft more spells etc. I'm aware this will be a matter of contention for some, but its my game I can make what I want! lol\n\n@BTB20 Those games were both near universally prasied by the gaming press at the time mostly because the previous Mario and RARE games were so universally loved, and the games were so anticipated. A bit like how music critics panned \"Whats the Story Morning Glory\" then realised the public loved it... so they universally praised \"Be Here Now\" because they thought fans would love it... only for it to be extremely divisive.\n\nMore modern critiques of Sunshine and DK64 are a lot more varied in their opinion. Some will absolutely tear them to shreds for the very same reasons that others will praise them. I would say both are an acquired taste, and whether you think they are excellent, or terrible, you are correct. Its uncommon to find people that fall inbetween, but I think I'm one of them. Both games are games I can play in short bursts and enjoy, obviously high quality products, but neither are games I've ever felt compelled to complete... they both get tiresome for me after a while, whereas Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie I can play start to finish over and over. But I understand how others could feel the exact opposite way.\n\n@samuelvictor\n\nChrist, you've just confirmed that I absolutely cannot let you and my son occupy the same physical space. It would undoubtedly generate the levels of pure fan-love that the laws of our physical universe cannot handle. I'm thinking either an outgassing of power that make the CERN dudes feel like you've just told them their cock doesn't work, or the final scene from Altered State.\n\nAnd I love you both for it.\n\nI also get the total fanboy thing. Don't get me started on how much I love John Carpenter*. Or Frank Herbert. Or Keanu Reeves. I just find it quietly amusing how Sonic fans love it despite the flaws. And for me, when it doesn't descend into ridiculous angry rants against anyone who doesn't share that love, I think it's a totally awesome thing. I can bore the pants off anyone with my theories about how Fight Club == Calvin & Hobbes all grown up, how and why post-apoc films only work on a low budget, or how Childs is The Thing (and don't get me started on how much I love Keith David). I think that for me, I tend to spread my love across so many different things that people find it hard to keep up when I, as you say 'let the mask slip' and go full-on neuro-divergent about the things I love because I hop and skip from thing to thing in some bewildering manner that makes total sense to me but to an outsider must sound like I'm pulling a Hans Zarkov and just repeating everything I've ever learned to stop Klytus pulling it out of my brain.\n\nAnd I'm not too proud to admit that there is some sort of envy for those like yourself and my son who can stay that focused. Myself, I'm a total flipping mess. A combination of all the stuff I've ever read/learned/enjoyed (I've got about a thousand books here and I'm quite happy to spend a couple of hours expounding on each one).\n\nAlso, your mum is a solid gold legend. Give her a kiss on the cheek and a warm hug from me next time you see her. People like us very much need people like her in our lives.\n\n*I was once lucky enough to meet Mr Carpenter himself at a gig of his in Tower Hamlets. I got a limited edition signed They Live poster, and also got him to sign my copy of a crappy miniature combat game I wrote and got printed and bound called Escape From Milton Keynes. I gave him a copy as well. The only two copies in existence. He probably binned his but fair play, he's my legend, I'm not his.\n\n@Ristar24 Nice, I always like hearing about Sonic fans that have been around since day one and ridden the differing waves of quality and reputation of the characters etc.\n\nFor me, Sonic 4 Episode 1 is probably the low point and thing that upset me the most... I probably wouldn't feel it was such a trevesty if it was just a mobiloe game and called something different. You're right that episode 2 was a significant improvement but still a long way off base. For me, Sonic Mania is the \"real\" Sonic 4 and I pretend that other game doesn't exist as its the only one that makes me irrationally angry or upset 😂 Maybe the GBA port of Sonic 1... but its a port so that doesn't count in my head, I can ignore it.\n\nFrontiers is far from perfect but its the best a new 3D Sonic game has been in decades and has real potential, and I've really admired how active Kishimioto has been in interacting with fans and even the modding community in going back and trying to improve the game, fix it, add requested features etc. The 2nd and 3rd free DLC really fixed a lot of my biggest issues with it, and they've confirmed that they are building on what they've learned with the next mainline game, rather than going back to the drawing board, so I'm more hopeful for 3D Sonic than I've been in a long time.\n\nMania, Origins and Superstars are all pretty great for 2d Sonic and I'm hopeful more classic Sonic games will continue to be made and they now at least understand how the physics, controls and level layouts should be, the improtance of the base set of characters, and have areally good team of people on the art, animation and music departments. (I wish we'd get a more colourful and cartoonish feeling 3d game with them all workign on it, but thats probably a long way off happening).\n\nSonic as a brand overall though is really on an upswing outside of the games. The two movies were far better than people expected them to be and the second really was given the freedom to be more of a \"like the games, for the fans\" thing than the first, I can only see that continuing with the third. The recent shows have been good, better than many previous attempts. The IDW comic series is absolutely killing it in my opinion. The marketing Team in America, Katie, Justin, Mike, Kenneth, Aaron, Jasmin and all are all very clearly lifelong fans with a real passion and knowledge for the history and clear vision for the future, and area actually listening to the fans and putting out quality products that are requested.\n\nWith all that in mind, I feel like Sonic as an overall brand is getting over its awkward mid 2000s \"joke brand\" era and theres whole new generations of kids just growing up loving it unironically, and it warms my heart to see parents enjoying sharing taht with them, just as I did with my own kids (who are now fully grown... jeez time goes by so fast as you get old).\n\n@Ristar24 I absolutely know Turbo the Tortoise... I have the C64, Spectrum and Amstrad versions! I have somewhat of a soft spot for any game trying to recreate the appeal of Sonic, but on the 8 or 16bit microcomputers. The C64 version is definitely the best, though the Spectrum one is impressively smooth for the hardware. The reason it never got a sequel is that it was the last game by Hi-Tec Software just as they were in the process of sadly going bust. Infact Codemasters stepped in to somewhat save the game and many copies have a Codemasters logo instead of Hi-Tec.\n\nAlso, you just really took me down memory lane with mention of Index. Perhaps it was because we had an \"Index Extra\" but I definitely felt that they were better for console games than Argos, always a bigger selection and older games at very reasonable prices as well as the latest titles. Several times I'd go into the store with £60 saved up intending to buy a game for my newly acquired SNES and instead walk out with 5-6 Master System games that I'd missed out on instead! some absolute bangers as well! Asterix, Lemmings, Marble Madness, PacMania... 😍\n\nSonic 1 on Megadrive was the game that made me fall in love with the series of course... I played it at a friends house in 1991 on release and it genuinely felt like my whole world changed. I loved EVERYTHING about the character and Green Hill Zone (the only zone I got to see). I find the uneven pacing between the levels to be frustrating for replays (Marble Zone is my least favourite, so havign it right after Green Hill dampens my enthusiam for playthroughs) so for me its the wekest of the Megadrive titles, but still one I love to bits. I actually feel the Master System Sonic 1 is a better gaem, as do many, but certainly not all people! haha. But that first Green Hill Zone just really did everything right and was just in your face with awesome characters, concepts, and easily the best graphics and music I'd ever heard from a game until that point. That single experience is teh spark of why I've been pretty much obsessed ever since, not only with teh games, but the characters, music, designs... reading every comic, watching every show, making my own fan projects since I was a kid. Literally in 1991 I made a Commodore version of Sonic 1 so that I could play it, when I knew my parents couldn't afford a Megadrive. Also that summer holidays drew an enormous 20+ page comic, learned piano to play Green Hill Zone theme...\n\nIf you only played that PS4 version of Frontiers at launch, I think you'll find the game has massively improved since then, though I can't vouch for if performance has changed. Its not just vast amounts of new content thats been added but the controls have almost completely changed and been refined (and allow you to customise to make them feel how you prefer).\n\n@Woderwick Ah, I love everything about what you wrote there! Funny that you say you look like an extra from a Guy Ritchie film, that was literally the look and image I was somewhat typecast in for many years, both from my notariety in the rap music world and from earning my dues in the film industry working on countless low budget cockney gangster and football hooligan films. I got tattoos, shaved my head, worked out a lot and fully leant into it... as a somewhat effeminant kid who was bullied I must admit to have enjoyed cosplaying for a while as a \"hard man\" and leaning into the uber masculine traits and have people accept me as that.\n\nAfter a while though I realised it wasn't all that fun and that some people were scared of me, or assumed I was sexist, racist, or violent... whereas I just thought I was being \"manly\" I was coming across as \"Neo Nazi\" after a while (only from appearance, not by IRL behaviour of course) ! Which is the absolute furthest from who I am. As soon as I started to get enough power to make my own projects, write my own scripts, get the parts I wanted etc I started purposefully going against that stereotype, getting parts in romances, comedies, growing my hair back (many colleages had assumed I was bald!) etc. I'm somewhat fascinated by societal gender constructs as none of them ever made much sense to me and as an autistic person I've just been feeling my ways around them all my life. Nowadays I'm at the point where I finally feel ok to just be unasahmedly me, and like what I like, act how I act etc. I think the world is a lot more accepting of that nowadays than it was when we were kids though.\n\nI also have a very strong urge to take the mick out of myself, or want to be taken down a peg or two if ever I get too self important or am in a position where people are looking up to me. I've written several films where I end up playing the lead role, and in all of them I end up makign the character a bit of an arse who thinks he's cooler than he is. Often they think they are a ladies man but end up getting slapped or taken advantage of rather than actually coming off as cool to the audience. Even in my short lived but occasionally briefly reappearing rap career I just can't in all seriousness have the necessary confidence and bravado without also putting a load of self depricating jokes in there. There is definitely a British reserve that stops me from going full \"aspirational figure / role model / sex symbol\" in any American media I work in.\n\n@Ristar24 Marble and Labyrinth aren't bad, per se. They are actually very nicely designed. Its just that it feels that they are from a completely different game, and it changes the flow very quickly. I recently saw a video about the history of the game's creation and the original designers explained quite succictly how each zone in Sonic 1 was purposefully designed to be a completely different gameplay experience in order to make what they hoped would be a well rounded game and show off the range of the character and the engine. I think they succeeded there, but for many people, Green Hill is so strong an impression that to immediately forcefully slow Sonic down feels jarring.\n\nForgot to mention it before but I'm impressed that you noticed the speed cap or lack there of. Theres a really difference between the momentum and speed differences between sonic 1, 2 and 3 and in my game engine for my fan game I've made sure to have toggleable options for players to choose which suits their prefered playstyle better.\n\n@Woderwick Haha that's funny that your boss had that double standard... yeah military tattoos were the one exception for older generations that I nearly mentioned also in my previous post but it was already gettting pretty long! lol. I'm glad perceptions have changed nowadays. I'm not always a fan of other people's tattoos, but surely thats the point - they are for them, not me. Its a very personal thing and a way of expressing or remembering something important to you.\n\nWhen we were talking before about how nice it is to hand write a letter, it made me think of the song \"Tweet\" by Alizée, but its in French so I didn't bother to mention it... essentially though the lyrics are about how in modern times romance is lost through just sending texts and likes, using hookup apps etc and not properly \"courting\" like our parents or grandparents generations did. Dancing, walking together, love letters.\n\nHowever, now there is even more context to also talk about her so I will get it out of my autistic brain to get some closure! Long story short about her she is a very well known celebrity in France, for many years, starting off as somewhat of a French equivalent of Britney Spears in the lolita-esque early marketing, but she has stuck around in popularity to this day through various different career ebbs and flows. I've met her a few times through both the music industry and Disney (where she voices some French dubs and sings french versions of the movie songs) and she's lovely. To people in the English speaking world, she is quite infamous within certain gaming circles and some of the nerdier sections of the internet, for an old performance of hers going viral, basically for her doing a somewhat provocative dance that became a meme / milkable gifs and then was integrated as an emote / taunt in various videogames, including being the dance that the night elves in World of Warcraft do.\n\nAnyway, this has lead to English speaking audiences mostly only really knowing her for that one performance ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6omsDyFNlk ), and idolising her beauty captured in that moment... but that was many years ago. Right after that performance, she got married, moved out of the limelight for a while to start a family, before coming back to release new albums later. She is still a very beautiful woman, but she's now 39, has had several kids and over the years has amassed quite a lot of tattoos. None of which should be remotely strange! Time passes, who'da thunk it?\n\nIt puzzles and saddens me to see how many knee-jerk appalled reactions there are to the fact that she \"ruined herself\" according to many random internet dwelling folk who somehow expect her to look exactly the same as she was when she was 19 in the video they obsess over, and how angry a few tattoos make them... especially as the majority of them are related to nerd friendly things like anime, videogames, fantasy, disney... I've talked to her about her tattoos and the stories behind some of them are very personal and quite moving but a lot of people are just \"pretty woman shouldn't have tattoos\" full stop. I don't understand why anyone would want to police what someone else does with their body...\n\nAs for me, no-one has told me not to get tattoos, and of course yes they can be covered for filming with makeup or even removed in post with CG. I've done that for my own projects. But I'm no-where near famous or important enough to be able to warrant taking any extra expense or time, as far as most casting directors are concerned! Easier and cheaper to find someone without! I'm easily replacable! 😂\n\n@Woderwick Yes Alan Moore is certainly somewhat of a prickly character and I definitely don't agree with everything he says or does, though he's someone I greatly admire. I've had the pleasure of attending a few talks by him and briefly spoke to him on one occasion, seemed a thoroughly decent chap. I agree on your assesment of Constantine too.\n\nAs for Harry Potter, you know, that was my opinion when the first book came out and everyone was going mad over it, adults included, and I just didn't get it and was quite snobbish about it. I thought the writing wasn't much special and the themes and settings were all thoroughly recycled and played out from a million other teenage witch/wizard school retreads (say the person making a game about a young witch. Oh well. Its a trope I'm fond of). I only paid much attention as my kids were the right age to enjoy the movies and each one improved over the years (I even worked on the last 2 in a tiny capacity).\n\nHowever, as the books went on and she became more bold with the political and social commentary that she felt she could get away with squeezing in there and I thought it became a lot more interesting. Some of it is quite ambiguous and clearly meant to make young people think of the grey areas of difficult subjects. One example would be Hermione wanting to free the elves from what she percieves as slavery, but actually they were quite happy with the arrangement and when they were free'ed, some of them couldn't handle a life with no purpose, especially when all they had ever experienced until that point was servitude. It can be read all kinds of ways, some of which are not very favourable to Rowling (certain races love to be oppressed! It makes them happy!) but others of which could be percieved as a commentary on the Western \"democracies\" going to war to \"free\" certain countries with very different regimes, but leaving them a splintered mess and causing terrorist groups and extremeism to flourish etc... the fact these conversations happen within universe and doesn't give clear direction or easy answers is pretty bold for a kids book. Things like the balacning of the personality traits of the 4 houses is very well done too - would have been very easy to just make Slytherin the bad guys but thats not the case at all, and actually is easy to read as a societal allegory for all different types of people with oposing views and ideologies having their place and being an important part in society regulating itself.\n\nUpcoming rant on Star Wars which I'll type in a separate reply!\n\n@Woderwick Now. Star Wars. I'm glad you brought that up. I realised the other day that you'd mentioned the Disney Star Wars stuff before and I'd replied, but for whatever reason my reply was lost. Which annoyed me as of course I'm rather tied to that brand in several ways over the last decade. First off, the reason Lucas sold to Disney is because he was sick and tired of the fanbase constantly harassing him because they didn't like the Prequel trilogy and felt he'd \"ruined their childhood\". Its only in recent years when kids who grew up with the prequels are now adults and very vocal online that people are reassessing them. It can't be overstated how much hate there was towards them and anything to do with them for many years. I was lucky enough to be invited to Celebration this year, and Hayden Christensen (who nearly took his life over the constant hatred) stepping on stage for the first time in over a decade and getting a standing ovation was an absolute moment. He could barely speak and it was so lovely seeing the fans old and young bandying together to make him realise he wasn't hated and it was actually nice to have him back.\n\nThe LARP hotel you mentioned was a great idea but excecuted terribly. It was like $5000 for 2 nights, and during that time you couldn't even experience Disney World else you'd have wasted your money. It was an underwhelming claustrophobic 100% indoors experience (not even windows) with a luxury price tag that meant only the richest of fat cats could afford it, and most of those people don't want to be part of \"dinner theatre\" style crowd interaction. If you weren't aware, it closed after only being open about 6 months.\n\nThat said, the Star Wars land ( Galaxy's Edge ) is great and you can full on larp til your heart's content, drinking at the cantina, pilotting the Millenium Falcon, building a droid, getting assigned a Kyber crystal and being given lightsabre training with your custom blade. Its pretty cool. Movie producer friends of mine got married there, it was a trip. If you don't fancy a flight to the States, they are building it in Paris next year - I'll be able to get you in free 😋\n\nYou mentioned before that you got a distaste for the Disney Star Wars after watching Episode VII / Force Awakens and didn't watch beyond that, and were somewhat annoyed with Rian Johnson for leaving his indie routes to make Last Jedi. I have many opinions on the Sequel trilogy. They are far from perfect, but I can see merit in all of them. The biggest problem is that they AREN'T a trilogy. They are 3 almost unrelated films. Each one has a miriad of issues, most of which come from trying to please the increasingly fractured fanbase. A single director with an arching vision for all three and the confidence to just make what they wanted to would have been far better. But Disney had so much money riding on it all, I think it was a safer bet in their minds to at least try and appease the fanbase, which meant each film was very different to the last to try and course correct what people complained about in the previous entry, and each time they went too far in the opposite direction.\n\nI'm biased because I know too many people both on camera and behind the scenes, and I know the passion and love that went into creating even the smallest details. I'd be hard pushed to say that I think they are all \"good\" films but each one has elements that are amazing and absolutely worth experiencing as a Star Wars fan, and they add real value to the canon. You just have to look past all the obvious cringe, mistakes and plot holes. Similar to the prequels, theres really good stuff hidden in there amongst the not so great stuff. I concentrate on the bits I like.\n\nOne point I should make is to somewhat stick up for Rian Johnson (even though their film is the one I like the least, by a long margin). Basically what Disney (and all other big studios) do with a franchise picture (ie ones that people will go and watch because of the brand) is look to the indie space to hire talented and well regarded people from lower budget movies and offer them a chance at a step up the ladder. The reason for this is they are much cheaper to hire than a big name director, and that big name (Speilberg or whatever) would have no impact on whether people would pay to see the movie. Every big franchise film will have people from the indie world picked to direct it. I myself am a fiercely independent \"starving artist\" type who is often head hunted for hollywood stuff nowadays and its very likely that I'll agree at some point if I'm lucky enough to be asked to direct something my inner child would have been excited by. I see nout wrong with it, its not selling out. Hollywood vs indie is often a \"one for me, one for them\" ethos. If you only make art, you'll fall out of favour and run out of money very quickly.\n\nI completely understand you not feeling like watching any of the sequel trilogy, or even the recent shows (most of which are quite well recieved, comparitively. Andor is especially good).\n\nHowever, the one that I was the most involved with, and the one I very briefly act in and mentioned that I actually wrote a line which went on to be very famous and a springboard for doing good in the world (and for which I recently went super viral accidentally when I did an AMA about for the official reddit) is Rogue One.\n\nEven without bias, I'd thoroughly recomend you watch Rogue One. Not for me, I'm barely in it. Blink and you miss me, almost all of what I did was chopped out. But instead because its by far and away the best thing Disney have done with Star Wars and the one thing almost all fans universally agree is actually really good.\n\nThe reason for this, is its not a \"Star Wars\" movie, as you'd traditionally expect one to be. And its not part of the new continuity. Its essentially \"Episode 3.5\" and the film that bridges Revenge of the Sith ( Ep 3 ) to A New Hope ( what we oldies used to call \"Star Wars\" ). Its a very cleverly written film that very satisfyingly fixes a few of the most egrigious plot holes in both those films, and helps make the continuity between the prequels and the original trilogy make sense.\n\nBut its also more than that. I say its \"not a Star Wars movie\" in that it doesn't start with an exposition crawl. There are no lightsabre battles. Barely any ships or dogfights (exception one super cool one thrown in there which many think is the best in the series). Its a human film, about the ethics of war, global politics, corruption, the fact that in life there are no \"good guys\" or \"bad guys\". It humanises the people fighting for the empire. It shows bad eggs in the Rebel alliance. And most importantly, it satisfyingly explains exactly why the Death Star was built with such an obvious flaw of a self destruct button thats just sat there, exposed for Luke to shoot, and how Leia even knew about it in the first fricken place! 😂\n\nBoth Gareth Edwards and Tony Gilroy (who essentially co-directed) are huge talented people. Again, Edwards (the named director) is someone who I came up with, him making super low budget indies and making visual effects freelance for the BBC before Hollywood scooped him up.\n\nI think out of everything Disney has done with Star Wars, for better or worse, Rogue One almost justifies everything. And Lucas was never going to make another film anyway. I think overall, its a net positive rather than just letting it die. And likely, just as the prequels are now reasessed as many kids grew up enjoying them, the same will happen with the sequels. They are films made for kids, after all. It just rankles for us adults when stuff doesn't live up to our childhood memories. But its nice that it continues and is contantly reimagined - if a certain incarnation isn't to my taste, another might be - much like the Ninja Turtles, Transformers, Spider-Man et al (and indeed Sonic! See, we're still on topic!) its a mixed mag, but always being refilled and taking another stab at it. And some of the attempts are pretty cool.\n\n@samuelvictor\n\nThat's an interesting read, and I did worry previously that I'd upset you with my previous comments. I also get the idea of indie directors 'stepping up' and being given a big project to work on, and it's not something I'm against in principal, I just see it failing so often because the director isn't a good fit for the project, or the project itself isn't that good but once they've signed on they either see it to the end or bow out and (I'd assume) pretty much burn all their bridges in the filthy town that is Hollywood. I don't recall the last time someone pulled an Alan Smithee although I know some people still do walk away from projects but the power imbalance between indie director and massive studio is so ridiculously one-sided that it's not an option for most people.\n\nAs to Lucas, I don't hate him at all, I don't even hate the prequel trilogy particularly, but I don't think they're very good films and I think that the more you delve into the Star Wars universe, the more you expose the flaws in its conception that David Brin exposed in his essay about it. What I loved about Star Wars as a child, without even consciously realising it at the time, and what set it apart from so many other similar films at the time (and this is speaking as a huge fan of Corman's work and Battle Beyond The Stars in particular) is that Star Wars felt like a massive universe into which we were seeing a tiny slice.\n\nThe more films they make, and the more the dwell on the same characters, planets and situations, the smaller that universe seems. It starts to become a morality play (with a fairly warped set of morals) around a single family and that's something I never felt it was about with the first trilogy simply because it 'felt' like there was a much larger universe outside of the Skywalkers playing their 'divine right of kings' game.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, my issue with Awakens was that it just felt like picking some iconic scenes from the first trilogy and cramming them into a new film with a lot of nudges towards the fanbase to get them to accept the new characters. They essentially took the ending of Jedi, moved it forwards 10 years and then reset it all back to the way it was at the start of A New Hope, so they could retread the same ground. Oh, and the Rebellion have had a rebrand, changed their colour scheme from red to blue, and then called themselves the Resistance. By definition 'Resistance' is less forceful than 'Rebellion'.\n\n@samuelvictor\n\nI hit the length limit on that one so here's the rest of it:\n\nYour mentioning of the TV stuff realised I was unintentionally dishonest earlier though. I did actually sit down with the missus and watch the first series of The Mandalorian and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Yes it uses a few too many elements from the original trilogy but I suppose they had to stick a Yoda and a Skywalker in to make it seem like it wasn't completely separate from the rest of the Star Wars universe.\n\nI liked the setting, I liked the direction, I loved some of the characters and it's the first time in years that I've watched something that actually felt like Star Wars. I also loved the way it was largely a spaghetti western take on Star Wards and the fact that it managed to make the Mandalorians themselves actually fit into the rest of the universe with a proper explanation for who they were that gelled with the original trilogy while not doing the same reductive crap that Awakens did.\n\nI haven't watched the Boba Fett series yet but I do plan on getting round to it. It's just that apart from the odd thing here and there I haven't watched TV for over 20 years now and it's not something I feel a great urge to do very often.\n\nI do stand by my complaints about Awakens though. It was Abrams at his CTRL+C>>CTRL+V worst. He's made a career out of knocking off Lucas and Spielberg and I know it's a very personal thing as to whether you consider something a loving homage or a pedestrian rip-off but I know which side of the fence I'm on when it comes to his films.\n\nIt's a shame because I think he's actually quite a talented director, and I don't have a problem with wearing your inspiration on you sleeve. But my personal opinion is that you need to take the things you love and that inspire you and put them together in a new way with your own creative spin on it. Not just jumble the same elements about a bit and wait for the audience to applaud.\n\nI'm trying (and struggling slightly) to think of a good rcent example what I mean. Musically it's easy for me to hold up Janelle Monae and sceam \"This! This is what I'm talking about!\" until I run out of oxygen. She's equal parts Bowie and Prince and Queen but it's clear those are inspirations, not blueprints and she adds her own incredibly magic to that.\n\nFilmwise, I suppose Mandy is a sort of good example. It's inspired by pulp 'mens adventure' novels and grindhouse trucker films mixed with those sort of weird old sci-fi/horror films like From Beyond and The Keep and it just works so well because it also has it's own feel and themes and remains logically consistent throughout.\n\nBut it's all very subjective and personal and I could see why others would look at Mandy and think it totally derivative. I suppose for me it's whether or not I can see that the creator has their own vision that comes through, or whether it just feels like they're doing it because somebody else did and it was popular. Not that I claim to know one way or the other, it's very much a 'feeling' thing, but I like to think I can tell when someone is being 'authentic', whatever that may mean.\n\n@Woderwick \"I don't recall the last time someone pulled an Alan Smithee although I know some people still do walk away from projects\". I have done exactly this several times. Was a shame to do as they were projects that would have looked great on my cv too. Though I walked off not because of creative differences (which you expect when working on a studio picture. Always \"too many cooks\"), but because of extreme ideological differences, or discovering something really awful about one or more of the people funding the projects, so those were bridges I didn't mind burning, and can happily justify if anyone ever questions me about it. As you said, Hollywood can be a \"filthy town\".\n\nAs I've mentioned elsewhere on this site, I did turn down a $30 million budget movie as the changes they wanted me to make to the script were unconscionable to me. That was not an easy thing to do. Perhaps it was foolish. What I do know is if I was offered to direct something that young me would have been excited by - Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Marvel, Muppets and a handful more franchises, I'd gleefully accept knowing full well that studio interferance would absolutely sabotage everything I tried to do and the finished result would probably not be what I wanted. But still, its an honour to be associated and a rite of passage to be chewed up and spat out by the evil corporate machine! lol.\n\nI'm too close to JJ to give any objective opinion on your critique (not that we are friends or anything, he probably wouldn't even remember my name! Might recognise me in person though) but I will say that he's a thoroughly decent bloke who has used his association with Star Wars to do an enormous amount of good. Force For Change was set up by him and I was one of the founder members, it raised many millions for unicef and I felt lucky to be involved with a lot of wonderful fundraising events that made a lot of kids happy, whilst doing genuine good in the world.\n\nYour criticisms of Force Awakens are the most common and are perfectly valid - it very much plays like a \"greatest hits\" of Star Wars moments. But thats exactly what he was tasked to do by Disney, its barely his fault to follow orders. You've got to remember how long it had been since a Star Wars movie. They knew Force Awakens would be many kids' (and even teens') first experience of Star Wars and they tasked him to make something to instantly show and explain why its cool to a new audience of attention defecit (I say that with love) kids. As a parent it was a moment for me to take my own kids to the cinema to experience their first Star Wars film on the big screen, and see how excited and immediately invested they were. Suddenly it was their favourite new thing, they wanted lightsabers, droids and X Wing / Millenium Falcon toys, and it gave a window for me to explain the older stuff to them, and also for us then to be able to enjoy the theme park stuff together as a family. Force Awakens was never going to be a satisfying \"Star Wars\" film for long term fans, but as a \"quick catch up\" establishing the universe and themes for a new audience, it nailed the landing. Its very much a film by commitee, but thats par for the course when Disney had just chucked literal billions into buying Lucasfilm. It had to be a safe bet for the long term - IE onboarding basically 2 generations of kids who had no concept of what a \"Star Wars\" even was.\n\nRians film was the follow up, and tried to do a knee jerk to the criticisms you laid out, and instead made an \"artsy, indie, subverts your expectations\" kind of film, which purposefully shat on a lot of what was set up in Force Awakens, and managed to (in my opinion) actively damage or even disrespect beloved characters, and broke long standing continuity by trying to retcon stuff that to many fans was sacred. It was brave, but felt like a film made by someone who didn't even like Star Wars and was somewhat sneering at the fanbase. Its beautifully shot and edited though! Great cinematography whilst ruining our childhoods!\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed Mandalorian. Boba Fett isn't up to the highs of that series, but I'd say Andor is actually better, and so far Ashoka is great, especially if you know the character already from Clone Wars / Rebels and can get invested in Prequel era lore. If anything, Disney's current Star Wars \"problem\" is not so much teh quality, but the quantity. There's so much, its hard to keep up, or for it all to feel \"special\" when there is such an abundance of it. But overall the TV series in both live action and animation are of a good quality, I just think they should slow down a little and pace them out.\n\nI feel even more certain that if you enjoyed Madalorian, then you'll find things to like about Rogue One. Its very similar, but obviously higher budget and adds to the films we grew up enjoying in the same way Mandalorean does.\n\n@samuelvictor\n\nI totally see what you're saying about Awakens needing to introduce a new generation to the series, but my take on that is that before I took my son to see it, I sat down with him and we watched the original trilogy together, and I kind of assumed most other people would have done the same. I also have great memories of my dad taking me along to watch all 3 in a back-to-back showing when I was probably around 6 or 7. He had no idea how long it was going to be, and this was before the days of mobile phones so mum went absolutely ballistic when we got back. She thought we'd been kidnapped or something.\n\nAnd it's very easy for me to be opinionated/obnoxious about this stuff because I'm very much an outsider with an educated interest (I did a degree in writing). In my defence, I'm equally passionate about stuff I love so I think it sort of balances out. Or possibly not. JJ may be a lovely bloke and have done a lot of cool things, but I'm not a big fan of most of his stuff. I liked Cloverfield (mostly because it was a fun monster movie and the meta-media stuff around it was really interesting and well done). I had no time for Lost, thought it was boring from the start and when they revealed that they just made stuff up and left it to work out what it all meant later it was like a textbook example of how not to set up a mystery. If you don't know where it's going when you start then why should I want to follow it along? There's no cohesion or internal logic to follow, it's just chucking weird stuff at a wall and then cobbling together a way to explain it after the fact.\n\nAs to Tarantino, I love some of his stuff, other bits I think are where he disappeared up his own arse a bit. He's incredibly talented, and very good at taking stuff he loves and putting his own spin on it. I also really like that most of his films are set in his own universe. I didn't enjoy the Grindhouse films particularly, because I felt it was a bit too self-indulgent and both he and Rodriguez were selling themselves short (I love Rodriguez too, I've a very well-thumbed copy of Rebel Without A Crew around here somewhere and if I ever do make a low-budget film it will very much act as my bible on how to work around your limitations).\n\nI didn't enjoy Inglorious Basterds at all. It felt too much like a bunch of charicatures and too little like it's own thing. Also, I'm not at all a fan of Eli Roth, either as a director or actor.\n\nWith Ritchie, I love Lock Stock and Snatch, even though they felt very much like he was doing an English Tarantino. I quite like Revolver despite its flaws because I can see what it was aiming for.\n\nThe Sherlock films were surprisingly good as well, and even though Wrath of Man felt fairly deriviative it was a decent enough flick. I didn't go a bundle on Rockanrolla because it felt like 2 or 3 ideas wedged together (although the Archie Slap is an absolute truism). I thought The Gentlemen was a return to form and I quite liked the Austin Fortune film because for me it felt like him doing his own version of a Matt Helm caper and I'm always up for a bit of campy 60's-inspired spy action.\n\nI think with Ritchie, I love a lot of what he does, but I'm weirdly a little bit surprised that I like them as much as I do. I think I keep waiting to be disappointed and yet he keeps pulling it out of the bag, even when he sort of doesn't.\n\n@Woderwick Great reply, really interesting, thanks! Yes sometimes its hard for me to be objective when I know people or am privvy to behind the scenes stuff, or are just more realistic about the business side over the art, because when billions are at stake you sometimes have to make those concessions. Its not just about making endless cynical money for \"the man\", of course each film is hundreds if not thousands of jobs for normal working class people.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint I don't love all of JJ's work, though I agree Cloverfield was brilliant. One of my favourites actually. 10 Cloverfield Lane was interesting too, although he only produced that one. Lost is a very interesting case, I actually felt it started very strongly. The real problem was that the writers' strike happened and the tv company insisted they carried on making the show without its writers and showrunners. Absolutely ruined it and killed all momentum or planned continuity. The same thing happened with Heroes. Lots of potential needlessly squandered with both those series and many others. Thankfully, seemingly this lesson was learned and the same didn't happen during this recent writers strike, everything just shut down production rather than arrogantly carrying on with no writers.\n\nBroadly, I agree with all you said about both Tarantino and Ritchie, though you are kinder to Ritchie's later work than I sometimes am. A lot of my friends worked on Rockanrolla and at the time I was dead jealous but I really didn't enjoy it when it came out. Something got lost in translation somewhere along that films journey I think.\n\nFunny you said Lock Stock and Snatch felt like he was doing a British Tarantino. The reason Ritchie trained with Dov is because Tarantino was very vocal about crediting him with his career. Ritchie literally did the course because he hoped to emulate Tarantino and of course the association as a sound bite would be useful when raising funds, or in interviews. And then I did exactly the same a few years later, studying with Dov because of the useful soundbite that I have the same film teacher as them both! 😂 He's genuinely a great teacher though. Spike Lee and Will Smith have subsequently gone to him for advise on various projects they've produced. He knows his stuff.\n\nRodriguez is someone I admire a lot and yeah of course Rebel without a Crew is a wonderful example of exactly the type of zero budget guerilla indie filmmaking that is the stuff I'm most passionate about. Him and Tarantino work well together, though I agree Grindhouse isn't their strongest work, though I get what they were going for and they got the aethetics mostly right - for me the fake trailers were the best bits though!\n\nEli Roth is a mixed bag for me but I really liked the first Hostel film, and thought the second one was very interesting in that it essentially entirely remade the first film, but gender swapped which gave and extra layer of interesting social commentary about stereotypes of how women and men are marketed to and manipulated by the media, on top of what was already an interesting piece of social commentary on how Ameraicans opinions of foreigners and otehr cultures are manipulated by the media. The third one was really weak sauce though. A friend of mine recently got cast as one of the leads in a project he's helming so I hope its one of the better ones!\n\nI agree that in an ideal world, parents would sit down and watch the original Star Wars trilogy with their kids before taking them to he cinema, but in Disney's eyes, thats still too big a risk. Many (most?) parents use Disney movies as proxy baby sitters and substitute parents, rather than sitting down and watching them with their children, and of course Disney were also hoping to get kids interested even if their parents weren't existing mega fans. Force Awakens was essentially what it had to be to justify that huge upfront cost to shareholders. Like I said, it was a film by commitee. Given that, I think the fact it was as entertaining, visually interesting and well made as it was (for example using actual practical sets, animatronics, droids etc rather than cheap quick CG, shooting on 35mm film to have better continuity with the look of the old films) its the best we could have realistically hoped for, despite its shortcomings.\n\nIts just a shame that Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker didn't continue the story beats it was so clearly trying to set up for the arc of the trilogy. The three new main actors were great and had good chemistry, only for all that to be somewhat squandered by 2 more films that were absolutely intent on keeping them apart and not playing to their strengths. Again, I'm somewhat biased as Boyega was someone I sort of knew and had worked with before, and liked a lot. But I think him, Ridley and Issac could have made a really nice modern replacement for the \"Luke, Leia, Han\" dynamic, had the films followed the original plan JJ was trying to set out.\n\n@samuelvictor\n\nI see what you're saying about Awakens being a film by committee, and maybe I'm being a little harsh on it, but it pretty much did exactly what I didn't want to see and I suppose I assumed that JJ had much more creative license because of who he is (and how it seemed to confirm a lot of my worst suspicions about his style of film-making).\n\nInteresting that you should mention Heroes as well, as that was one of the things that put the final nail in the coffin of my TV watching. I'm not sure how much of it was due to the strike, but I loved the first series and then it just seemed to lose its way. They forgot which powers Peter Petrelli had so he did stupid things (or it was just for plot reasons which is just as bad) and the whole thing seemed to get stuck in retreading what came before instead of moving forwards (which may indeed be due to the strike). I stopped watching after the episode where he escaped prison with a bunch of villains then watched one of them fry a guy to steal his car and just seemed to sort of shrug it off. Totally out of character for the way they'd built him and I just didn't go back.\n\nMore than that though, it was a bigger thing about US TV and how you can largely just watch the recap at the start of each episode and not miss much at all. It felt like storylines are too often padded out to fill the episode quota which dilutes the strength of the story and leads to hours of meaningless chaff. I understand that a lot of that is due to the demands of the networks and money-men but at the end of the day it's not what I'm interested in spending time on.\n\nShame about Heroes though, especially as it had Djimon Houson in it and I'll watch him in pretty much anything.\n\nThen again, I realise I'm a massive outlier when it comes to film and TV, and quite hard to please in a lot of ways, while at the same time being insanely forgiving in others. Which possibly explains why I give Ritchie so much time. His stuff is like comfort food for me, pulpy and silly but ultimately entertaining and it appeals to my sensibilities as English bloke who's bored of seeing US culture reguritated endlessly.\n\nI mean, I'm the guy who give you about an hour long monologue on why Vamp is such an amazing film, delving into theories that were probably never in the director's head. It's campy and crappy and yet at the same time I absoutely love every bloody second of it. And not just because many of those seconds feature Grace Jones.\n\n@Woderwick I too am a fan of high camp, and also ott b-movies and ultra low budget weird artsy fun experiemnts and will give any and all the above much more of the time of day than most super high budget bland but very polished blockbusters.\n\nHeroes was absolutely a casualty of the writers strikes and everything you said is correct. Its started off extremely strongly and after the first series everything very, very quickly fell apart and it never recovered, and the time invested in the first series seemed wasted. This is one of the reasons I don't watch most \"must see\" televsion until they finish their run. For example I avoided Game of Thrones thinking \"when its complete I'll binge it, if its actually worth it after the hype settles\" and SO many people who kept telling me to watch it got so angry with the last season that they now disavow ever even liking it in the first place.\n\nYou are astute to notice that about American shows and the filler / catch up nature. Its because their networks always used to order a very fixed amount of episodes, rather than British television companies which ask the writers how many episodes they think they need. So often arcs are stretched in American dramas, or filler plots are added. Its the same reason why American sitcoms and animated shows have \"bottle episodes\" or especially egrigiously those dreaded \"clip shows\". This is less of a thing with the high budget high concept dramas for streaming services like Netflix, Max etc which concentrate on quality and working with directors and writers to negotiate the most fitting amount of episodes, budget required etc, rather than first selling a show to advertisers then telling the writers how many episodes to make.\n\nIts mostly a holdover from literal live broadcast television channels, because they sold their advertising in blocks of fixed amount of weeks so needed to have a guarantee what show would be on for a fixed window, and that was easier if all shows had the same amount of epsiodes so the blocks all aligned. Same reason why episodes are an exact fixed length, rather than running as long as they need to to best tell the story like a streaming or on demand show can. Also back in those days, longer running shows would push to hit 100 episodes even if it meant tonnes of filler or the quality diving off a cliff, because the networks could then package and sell the show to syndication which is where the real easy revenue was in the longterm. Again, with streaming, no need for a fixed amount of episodes. [edit - forgive me if any or all of that is obvious and you already knew or intuited as much! I have a tendency to over explain stuff just incase]\n\nI honestly think with both Star Wars and Star Trek, JJ had little to no real creative control other than suggesting things and hoping the upper brass liked the ideas. In both cases he was just more lke a giddy fanboy who couldn't believe he was allowed to be associated with such properties and was willing to do whatever to make it work. Also to his credit he got a lot of work for others from the indie space on the films where he could. He really didn't have as much power or sway at that stage of his career that it sounds like you are assuming. He was essentially just another indie who got lucky and was offered to try something bigger. Back then, TV success did not matter a jot to movie execs, they were seen as completely unrelated and TV was a lowly unrespectable trash by comaprison in their minds. However he had written for some quite big movies, so Mission Impossible III was his \"lets see if this unknown indie guy can direct a franchise pic\" which because it did well lead to Star Trek, which then lead to Star Wars - each one a step up the ladder in budget and brand responsibility. Similarly, Gareth Edwards went from Monsters to Godzilla to Star Wars.\n\n@Samuelvictor\n\nWe really are very, very similar. I'm also very good at not watching things to avoid disappointment. For example, I've only ever watched the first Matrix film. Absolutely loved it, loved the cinematography and world-building, loved the way it fits gnostic theories and Plato's Cave into a really cool superhero origin story. I heard the sequel wasn't a patch on it and decided I wouldn't bother.\n\nGame of Thrones is interesting too. I've never watched it because I read the first book when it came out and really didn't enjoy it. I later heard some not at all nice things about Martin which totally put me off any of his work so I've never had any interest in watching the show.\n\nLikewise Star Trek. I heard enough bad things about the films to know I had zero interest in sitting through them so I've never bothered. I do totally understand that JJ wasn't in total control of it and I think he was handed a hack script to work from in the first place.\n\nI loved Monsters though. Totally not what I was expecting but such an entralling film. Godzilla looked terrible from the first trailer though so again, I skipped it.\n\nI'm the first to admit that my tastes are weird and insanely idiosyncratic so I know I'm not the target audience for most things. That's probably why I spend so much time reading rather than watching. It's much easier to do what you want when the budget is your imagination and the cost of getting it out there in front of the audience is miniscule compared to being handed millions to produce a film and knowing it has to make a decent return or it'll probably be your last job. Hence authors have a lot more leeway than directors, and the project involves fewer creative types so can be more focused on what the creator wants to say. I understand there are still editors and agents and publicists involved, but if I want to write a description of a room I don't have to worry about the lighting director and director of photography sticking their oars in and arguing they'd like to set it up the way Boorman would or that someone thinks the audio should be mixed in from an exterior location because it works for Soderbergh so well.\n\nI also think there are some big shifts in the film industry that mean the things I enjoyed when I was younger are unlikely to ever be made in the same way. You had the out-there stuff in the 60's that then fed it into the indie directors of the 90's who then got co-opted into the big studios when they realised people were raving about tiny films by tiny directors and who wouldn't want to be given a huge budget and access to incredible actors for their next project.\n\nAt the end of the day it's an industry and that means the industrialisation of creativity towards turning a profit. It's awesome if you can do stuff you're truly passionate about and have the luxury to do that but everyone has to put food on the table and the chance to do that while working at creating something/anything is an awesome opportunity. And even though I may complain about the bean counters and executives, you can't expect them to splurge millions on a film only 4 people will ever actually enjoy. While I may feel the industrialisation has gone way too far, they're not running a cinematic charity for tortured artists."
