I didn't understand or know any of the emotions of motherhood so I just said a very quiet, \"No,\" continued to do other projects with (producers) Playtone and then luckily became a mom.... On my daughter's first day of kindergarten I was wailing much louder than the other parents and I realized, \"Ugh, I have morphed into my own Greek mother.\"\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCP: How hard was it to get everyone back together?\n\nVardolos: I only made three calls ... The first phone call I made was John Corbett, it was his birthday. And then the next calls I made were to Michael Constantine who plays the dad, and Lainie Kazan who plays the mom. And then I never actually got to make any more phone calls after that because my phone started ringing! Everybody had called each other so everybody knew.\n\nCP: Just like their characters.\n\nVardalos: Yep. We really, really are like a family — everybody knows everything. We all stayed in the same hotel in Toronto, there was constant knocking on each other's doors, hanging out, just drinking wine, laughing, talking, it's really wonderful. These are people that if I wasn't working with them, I wish I was related to them.\n\nCP: Did you approach things any differently, knowing how big of a hit the first film was?\n\nVardalos: I mentor writers ... and I'm always saying to them: Please don't go look at what the marketplace is buying or what movie is successful, because a studio executive will come to you and say, \"Can Kevin Hart be Red Riding Hood?\" So you must always push everything aside. I have a little writing office where I don't even have Internet access, I just keep my head down and write what I want.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCP: Tell me about some of those other projects over the years that haven't been able to take root.\n\nVardalos: I definitely lost control and then gained it and lost it. It is a process and getting a film made is difficult, period. Hollywood is still the most archaic place. It is the one place where a review can talk about a woman's looks and you can not get a job simply because you're female. It's outdated and we have to push through.\n\nCP: Can you describe some of these scripts you've been asked to rework?\n\nVardalos: It will say about the female: \"Late 20s. Beautiful but doesn't know it. Kittenish, sexy.\" (And then) it'll say: \"Guy, 40s. A sense of being that far exceeds his years.\" You know, there's no reference to being handsome ... It'll never say: \"Chiselled jaw line, pecs to die for.\" Can you imagine reading that in a screenplay? It wouldn't be written and people would laugh out loud. But it's certainly written about the women. And we just call them on it, we just laugh.\n\nWe've had symposiums at the Writers Guild with men and women there talking about how when it comes to a place where we have to incite peril for a woman during sweeps' week the writers will pitch, 'OK, so let's get her raped'. And it's rough. It's really, really bad. We're creating a rape culture. And we're trying to pull back from it and that's what these meetings do where we have to call each other on what we're doing wrong. And try to get things out there.\n\nIt's really, really hard to get a family comedy made, especially a PG-13 one.... If this movie doesn't do well there will be another 15 years where we wait for another one. And that's a bummer.\n\n— This interview has been edited and condensed\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
