        "text": "Title: GREECE: Hollywood movie given rare opportunity to film at Parthenon\n\nSummary: ATHENS, GREECE (OCTOBER 12 2007) (REUTERS-ACCESS ALL) (SOUDNBITE) (English) ACTOR RICHARD DREYFUSS SAYING: \"It is no small thing that we are actors, actors are artists who are afraid to call themselves artists, and that art was born here, it makes sense here only from its origin, and this film is more about anyone thinks it is, its about magic.\" VARIOUS OF CAST OF THE FILM POSING TOGETHER\n\nEmbargoed: 2nd November 2007 12:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: Greece\n\nCountry: Greece\n\nReuters ID: LVA1X5CJFL178TT7S89NDP3029TH\n\nStory Text: Film actress Nia Vardalos of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" fame is shooting a new movie in Greece, and the Hollywood production was given permission to film on the Acropolis for the first time in 18 years.\n\nActress Nia Vardalos from \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" fame travels to Greece to film a new movie among the ancient ruins with Richard Dreyfuss, gaining rare permission to shoot among the country's archaeological sites.\n\n\"My Life in Ruins\" follows a tour guide who has lost her spirit, played by Vardalos, through Greece's ancient sites, experiencing a series of comic situations with a group of tourists, including Richard Dreyfuss, and finds love.\n\nThe film also stars Rita Wilson, Rachel Dratch, Harland Williams, Ian Ogilvy, Caroline Goodall, British comedian Alistair McGowan and Greek actor Alexis Georgoulis.\n\nIt is executive produced by Tom Hanks, whose production company, Playtone, produced \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\", also starring Vardalos, and was a huge success at the box office.\n\nThe screenplay was written by \"The Simpsons\" writer Mike Reiss with collaboration from Vardalos.\n\nThe film has been shooting at Delphi, Ancient Olympia on the Peloponnese peninsula- site of the first ancient Olympic games - and on the Acropolis in Athens, a rare opportunity archaeologists have given to very few filmakers.\n\nThe only other Hollywood film to shoot on the Acropolis was a segment of the movie \"New York Stories\" directed by Francis Ford Coppola called \"Life Without Zoe,\" in 1989.\n\nThe 1981 James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\" was one of the films that was denied permission to shoot in front of the Parthenon temple on the Acropolis.\n\nVardalos said it is the first time archaeologists have given permission to a Hollywood film production to shoot at several archaeological sites.\n\nArchaeologists are concerned over damage to the ruins, but Greek officials agreed to the filming as an effort to boost tourism and the country's image.\n\nGreek-born Vardalos, a Canadian, said it was a thrill for her to be given the chance to film a movie in the country of her roots.\n\n\"The thing about these spots is that they are very spiritual you can feel an energy that is very unique to being somewhere where there is so much ancient history, and then on top of it to get to make this movie is an extra layer of unconscious energy and awareness. I just feel I am having an out of body experience, its very strange, I feel like you are all in my dream.\"\n\nDonald Petrie, director of recent comedies such as \"How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days\" and \"Miss Congeniality\" said the only restrictions by archaeologists to film in the sites was that all the authentic remains were used without fake props and the crew did not touch the antiquities, and that the sites remained open to tourists. Archaeologists also assisted in the correct names and uses of locations in the dialogue.\n\nThe director said the ancient ruins were so overwhelming he felt he couldn't capture them on camera.\n\n\"These sites, these amazing places, Olympia and Delphi, and the Acropolis they are almost too big to capture on film. If I had one frustration it is I havent been able to capture more than already exists.\" he said.\n\nActor Richard Dreyfuss said he had always wanted to film a movie in Greece as the birthplace of theatre and acting.\n\n\"It is no small thing that we are actors, actors are artists who are afraid to call themselves artists, and that art was born here, it makes sense here only from its origin, and this film is more about anyone thinks it is, its about magic.\"\n\nScenes from the film were also shot in studios in Spain. Filming in Greece wraps up on October 19, and the film's release is expected in 2008. 26 Films and Playtone are producing, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks are executive producing, and Spanish studio Kanzaman are co-producers.\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2011.
