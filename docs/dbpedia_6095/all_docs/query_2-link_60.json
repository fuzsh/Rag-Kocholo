        "text": "Is it too late to say we still miss summer? These are 8 movies that will transport you to Greece from the comfort of your living room!\n\nMany know that Greece represents images of white-washed islands scattered along the Mediterranean sea’s crystal-clear waters, luxuriating in nonstop sunshine and inviting tourists from around the world every summer. However, Greece is now evolving into a haven for filmmakers, not just tourists, with Hollywood and numerous foreign production companies scouting its rich and varied landscape for film sets while also taking advantage of the generous tax incentives that were recently reformed. Our list consists of older and newer films that were shot in Greece over the years, putting the country and the stories around it on the global map.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nProbably one of the most anticipated releases to reach our TVs this winter, Glass Onion, the sequel to the mystery-packed commercial success Knives Out, is currently in theaters and coming to Netflix on December 23rd! The film follows Miles Bron, a billionaire in the tech industry, who invites his friends to vacation on his private Greek island to solve his “murder” as a interactive birthday party. However, detective Benoit Blanc is tasked with a real life investigation after an actual murder takes place.\n\nBoy On A Dolphin\n\nOne of the oldies but definitely goodies, this 1957 film starring the legendary Sophia Loren tells the story of a sunken ship containing artifacts, including a priceless ancient gold statue of a boy riding a dolphin, found by a sponge diver on a Greek island. She and her boyfriend seek the assistance of an American archaeologist, but her boyfriend cannot pay the requested fee and ultimately turns to an art collector for additional help. You can watch this film on Apple TV.\n\nMy Life In Ruins\n\nIn this hilarious romantic comedy, travel agent Georgia (Nia Vardalos) believes her life has no purpose. Her “Kefi,” or mojo, is lost, but she starts to have a different perspective on the world as she guides a group of tourists through her native Greece. In the process of introducing the group to the beauty of a far-off land, Georgia rediscovers her “Kefi” and her lust for life!\n\nWatch this film on HBO Max.\n\nMamma Mia\n\nOne of the most well-known movies to make our list, Mamma Mia (2008), was shot on the beautiful islands of Skopelos and Skiathos, located in the Northern Sporades Island Group. With the help of two old friends, Donna (Meryl Streep), an independent hotelier in the Greek islands, is getting ready for her daughter’s wedding but the adventurous bride Sophie has a plan in the meantime. In an effort to meet her real father and have him walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, she secretly invites three men from her mother’s past. Watch this film on Hulu.\n\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin\n\nThis 2001 war/romance film is set on the beautiful island of Cephalonia and stars the talented Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz. During the Italian occupation of Greece during World War II, an epic tale about the enduring hope of love and the devastating brutality of war is told. After falling in love with the village doctor’s daughter, an officer starts to doubt his motivation for fighting. The two are compelled to decide between their love for one another and their country as the war draws nearer. Watch this film on Apple TV.\n\nThe Big Blue\n\nThe breathtaking action sequences and imaginative visual style of director Luc Besson create an ultimate immersive experience. The Big Blue features stunning underwater cinematography and breathtaking location shooting on the Greek island of Amorgos, Peru, and the French Antibes. The emotional intensity of the film and its mystical themes have made this movie a cult phenomenon.\n\nThe Lost Daughter\n\nFilmed on the beautiful island of Spetses, this film follows Leda (Olivia Colman) on a seaside vacation by herself when she becomes caught up with a young mother and daughter she sees on the beach. Leda is overtaken by her own memories of the terror, confusion, and intensity of early motherhood as she is irritated by their compelling relationship. Unexpected decisions Leda made as a young mother, and their effects are brought to light when an impulsive act throws her into a strange and unsettling spiral. Watch this film on Netflix.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding: 3\n\nThis one is still in the works and something that we look forward to! While the plot for My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is still mostly unknown, Vardalos revealed on Instagram during the summer of 2022 that it was filming in Greece and that it would follow the events of Toula and Ian’s daughter Paris’ wedding, presumably to Bennet. The Portokalos and Millers appear to be returning to their culture’s Mecca, back to the roots, to celebrate a third generation’s big, fat, and even more Greek wedding! A release date is not yet known for this film.\n\nYou can now visit Greece from the comfort of your own living room with any of the above picks! OPA!"
