        "text": "Elizabeth \"Bitsie\" Tulloch is an American actress. She is known for her role as Juliette Silverton/Eve in the NBC television series Grimm.\n\nTulloch was born in San Diego, California, but grew up in Spain, Uruguay, and Argentina. \"Bitsie\" is not a contraction of Tulloch's given name, Elizabeth, but an homage to her oddly-nicknamed grandfather, a World War II bomber pilot. Her ancestry is English, Scottish, Irish, and one quarter Spanish/Mexican. Tulloch has stated her first language was Spanish although she no longer considers herself completely fluent anymore. Annually, her mother's family meets in Southern California for Day of the Dead. Her paternal grandmother's family is from Renfrewshire and her grandfather's family originated from the area around Kirkwall. In an interview with BBC News, she reported that \"we think the first Tulloch came to the US around 1880 and the Kerrs came in the early 1900s. After returning to the U.S., she went to middle and high school in Bedford, New York. Tulloch graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a double major in English and American Literature and Visual and Environmental Studies.\n\nTulloch's first acting credit was as R2-D2's \"girlfriend\" in R2-D2: Beneath the Dome, a mockumentary produced by George Lucas telling the life story of the fictional robot R2-D2 from the Star Wars film series. She starred as \"Sally\" in the premiere of Sam Forman's play, Quarterlife, which opened at the Pico Playhouse in March 2006. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Superbly performed...the scene at the end of the play, between Sally (Bitsie Tulloch) and Jack (Clark Freeman), was heartbreaking and beautiful... The lead actress, Bitsie Tulloch, [was] absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nHer first film role was in Lakeview Terrace directed by Neil LaBute, opposite Samuel L. Jackson, Kerry Washington, and Patrick Wilson, and worked with Barbara Hershey on a film called Uncross the Stars. In the fall of 2009 she filmed the romantic comedy Losing Control. Tulloch voiced one of the characters, a wolf called Sweets, in Alpha and Omega, a 3-D computer animated film, which was released in September 2010.\n\nTulloch played the small role of Norma, an actress in the 1920s starring in a silent movie with a veteran actor, in the award-winning movie The Artist with Jean Dujardin, John Goodman and James Cromwell, which was released by The Weinstein Company in November 2011, and won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Picture. She was nominated for a Critics' Choice Award for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\nIn 2012 she starred as one of the titular roles in independent film Caroline and Jackie opposite Marguerite Moreau, which she also co-produced. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2012, and was released theatrically in May 2013.\n\nTulloch played Marilyn Sitzman, a witness to the Kennedy assassination, in the star-studded 2013 film Parkland, opposite Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, Marcia Gay Harden, Jacki Weaver, Jackie Earle Haley, and Zac Efron. The film was produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman of Playtone, and was released in 2013, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination.\n\nTulloch has appeared on television shows House, Cold Case, The West Wing, Moonlight, and Outlaw. In 2007 she filmed a role as a Dharma initiative scientist for the ABC series Lost, but her role was re-cast due to scheduling conflicts with quarter-life.\n\nTulloch played the lead role in Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz's drama quarter-life, which premiered on NBC in early 2008. While the series was quickly pulled and moved to Bravo, Tulloch was hailed for her performance. The Los Angeles Times wrote: \"She's the best realized of the bunch... Tulloch, who plays her, seems destined to be better known.\" She was often compared to the 'next' Claire Danes: \"Will this be the first online show to create a real star? It looks likely: The gorgeous 26-year-old Tulloch clearly possesses Danes-like smarts and magnetism.\"\n\nIn 2009, Tulloch shot one of the 3 leads in HBO's buzzed-about comedy pilot Washingtonienne based on the book by Jessica Cutler. The pilot was produced by HBO and Sarah Jessica Parker. In early 2010 she filmed Most Likely to Succeed, a 1/2 hour comedy pilot for Imagine Entertainment through the FOX network, and a recurring role on NBC's Outlaw.\n\nShe was a series regular on the NBC series Grimm (2011-2017), a fantasy police procedural drama set in a world where characters inspired by Grimms' Fairy Tales exist. Tulloch's heritage and fluency with the Spanish language were written into the role.\n\nIn September 2018, Tulloch was confirmed to play Lois Lane in The CW crossover event \"Elseworlds\" in the series Supergirl and The Flash. The executive producers described the character as \"dogged, determined and brave.\" Tulloch reprised her role as Lois Lane in the television series Superman & Lois in 2021.\n\nIn December 2014, Tulloch confirmed she was in a relationship with her Grimm co-star David Giuntoli. In July 2016, she and Giuntoli revealed they became engaged in April 2016. They married in June 2017, and confirmed their pregnancy with their first child in October 2018. During her time living and working in Portland (where her drama Grimm was filmed), Tulloch became a fan of the Portland Trail Blazers and was often seen attending games with her co-stars.\n\nTulloch and Giuntoli maintained two residences, including a 1920s remodeled Dutch colonial in Portland, Oregon and a 1920s Spanish house in Hollywood Hills. Their first child, a daughter named Vivian, was born in February 2019. The family moved to the state of Washington at the beginning of 2020.\n\nIn early 2012, Tulloch was nominated by the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, commonly called the Critics' Choice Awards, for Best Ensemble Cast for The Artist.\n\nTulloch was nominated for a 28th Annual LA Weekly Theater Award for her performance in Sam Forman's play, Quarterlife (March 2007). Quarterlife was an experimental sequence of 20+ episodes which were originally intended to be released only on the internet, but its success led it to being picked up by NBC.\n\nAs a child, Bree spent her time traveling the country with her family and her pro-football player father. During her teens, Turner's parents settled in Northern California where Bree first discovered a love for dance. In high school, she honed her talents in everything from ballet to jazz. When she moved to Los Angeles to study dance at UCLA, she was discovered by a dance agent and immediately landed roles as a dancer in countless high profile films such as Die Hochzeit meines besten Freundes (1997), Eine wie keine (1999) and The Big Lebowski (1998), among others. She danced her way into high profile nationally televised award shows and commercials, as well as major music videos with everyone from Brian Setzer to Sugar Ray. She appeared in spots for Hyundai, Gap, Dr. Pepper and the 2003 Budweiser spot \"Top 10 of All-Time\", which aired during the Super Bowl. Before she knew it, her passion had turned into a full fledged dancing career.\n\nThis career exposed her to countless hours on television and movie sets, where she truly felt right at home. She caught the acting bug and decided to turn her focus to this newfound passion. Turner credits her dancing for the focus she put forth towards acting. She immersed herself in the new art, studying theater at King's College in London and enrolling in a series of acting classes with some of the best teachers in the business.\n\nShe immediately made her mark in Hollywood as Rob Schneider's love interest, \"Allison the Fish Girl\", in the ever popular movie Rent a Man - Ein Mann für gewisse Sekunden (1999), and as the snobby bouffant haired Tri-Pi \"Tiffany\" in Das sexte Semester (2002). She opened the mega-hit Wedding Planner - verliebt, verlobt, verplant (2001) as a nervous bride, alongside Jennifer Lopez and captivated audiences as head cheerleader \"Tina Hammersmith\" in the hit film Girls United Again (2004). In addition, she starred in the critically acclaimed Carsey/Werner Oxygen Network comedy Good Girls Don't... (2004) as \"Marjorie\".\n\nBree has also made her mark within the independent film world including the Sundance award-winning piece The Quest for Length (2002), a critically acclaimed mockumentary in which Bree played the supportive girlfriend of a man who was on a comical quest to enlarge his penis. Not only do critics love her performance on the big screen, but they praise her for the work she does on stage as well.\n\nRecently, Bree wrapped the indie comedy Das Jahr, in dem wir uns kennenlernten (2008), starring Jimmy Fallon and The TV Set (2006), starring Sigourney Weaver. She can be seen in Rexx, der Feuerwehrhund (2007), a story that follows \"Rexxx\", Hollywood's most in-demand canine star. Turner plays \"Liz Knowles\", a Hollywood film producer who is the force behind the famous celebrity dog. Also, you can catch her in Zum Glück geküsst (2006), a comedy starring Lindsay Lohan about the luckiest girl in the world who somehow loses it. Bree plays Lohan's best friend \"Dana\" who helps her troubled friend try and reclaim the luck she once had through a whirlwind of events. Bree also starred opposite Ethan Embry in an episode of Showtime's Masters of Horror (2005), an anthology series directed and co-written by famed filmmaker Don Coscarelli.\n\nWhen she is not working on a film or a television show, Bree spends her time honing her craft as an actress, working with charities and spending time with her family and friends.\n\nChristian Marie Serratos (born September 21, 1990) is an American actress who plays Rosita Espinosa in AMC's The Walking Dead TV series, based on the comic book of the same name. She is also known for playing Suzie Crabgrass in the Nickelodeon series Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide and Angela Weber in The Twilight Saga series.\n\nSerratos was born in Pasadena, California and raised in Burbank, California. Her mother is a jewelry designer, and public relations and marketing agent at ACSPR and is of Mexican descent. Her father is a set construction worker of Italian descent. She began figure skating when she was 3 and continued competitively, saying, \"My coaches were talking about the Olympics and it was really crazy. Now, I just do it for fun.\" At the age of 7, she signed with the Ford Modeling Agency.\n\nSerratos played Suzie Crabgrass in the Nickelodeon series Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, which debuted in 2004 and ended in 2007 after three seasons.\n\nSerratos' role as Angela Weber in Twilight won her the \"Young Supporting Actress\" award in the Best Performance in a Feature Film category at the 30th Young Artist Awards. Serratos reprized the role in Twilight's sequels The Twilight Saga: New Moon and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. In 2011, she appeared in The Black Keys video for their song \"Howlin' for You\".\n\nShe played the recurring character of Rosita Espinosa in the fourth season of AMC's series The Walking Dead, making her first appearance at the end of the tenth episode, \"Inmates\". For her character Rosita, she was upped to series regular in the fifth season, and was added to the series' main credits in the seventh season.\n\nShe ranked at No. 65 on Maxim's \"Hot 100\" list for 2010. In the March 2015 issue of Playboy magazine, Serratos was featured in the \"After Hours\" section.\n\nSerratos is an animal activist. She has posed for a number of PETA campaigns promoting a vegan lifestyle. In March 2017, Serratos revealed that she is expecting her first child with her longtime boyfriend, New Politics singer David Boyd. On Mother's Day 2017, Serratos announced that she'd welcomed her first child, a baby girl, whose name she later revealed to be Wolfgang Serratos Boyd.\n\nSonequa Martin-Green (born March 21, 1985) is an American actress and producer. She is best known for her television role as Sasha Williams on The Walking Dead, a role she played from 2012 to 2017. Before that, she had starred in several independent films before gaining her first recurring role as Courtney Wells on The Good Wife. Later, she had recurring roles as Tamara in Once Upon a Time and Rhonda in New Girl. She plays the lead role as Michael Burnham in the television series Star Trek: Discovery.\n\nMartin-Green was born in Russellville, Alabama. She has one sister and three older half-sisters. She had initially planned to become a psychologist before deciding to pursue a career in acting when she was in the tenth grade. On her decision to become an actor, she said, \"I didn't know I was going to be an actor until I was 16. I thought I was going to be a psychologist, which is interesting because it's very similar to acting. I was fascinated with human behaviour and why people do what they do. I was in the middle of rehearsal in 10th grade when I had this epiphany. And so I got my theatre degree from the University of Alabama.\"\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Alabama in 2007 with a degree in theatre, she relocated to New York City where she and her husband, Kenric, lived for five years before moving to California.\n\nWhile known primarily for her television roles, Sonequa Martin-Green made her debut in film with various film roles since 2005. In 2009, she played the lead role of Tosha Spinner in Toe to Toe opposite Louisa Krause, the fiercely determined scholarship student who seeks to build a brighter future outside of Anacostia and away from one of Washington's poorest neighborhoods. The film focuses on her friendship and rivalry with Jessie (Louisa Krause), a privileged girl from Bethesda whose promiscuous tendencies threaten to become her undoing. They both strive to gain a better understanding of one another's plight as society threatens to drive them ever farther apart. The film received generally positive reviews, with Martin-Green's performance receiving critical acclaim, even from the film's detractors.\n\nMartin-Green has had various guest and recurring roles in TV shows. She made her television debut in 2008, appearing on NBC's Law & Order: Criminal Intent as Kiana Richmond. She then gained her first recurring role on Army Wives as Kanessa Jones the following year. In 2009, she received the role of Courtney Wells on The Good Wife, her first recurring role playing an adult character as opposed to playing a teenager with her previous roles in both film and television. She appeared on the show for two years before making two more appearances in Gossip Girl and NYC 22 in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Sonequa Martin-Green was cast in a recurring role on The Walking Dead as Sasha, the sister of Tyreese (Chad Coleman), an original character, exclusive to the television series. Martin-Green auditioned for the role of Michonne albeit with a pseudonym due to the secrecy of the auditioning process. When Danai Gurira, whom Martin-Green said was \"the perfect choice\", was cast, former showrunner Glen Mazzara still wanted Martin-Green to be a part of the show and decided to create a role specifically for her instead. Martin-Green explained: \"[Sasha] was supposed to be a recurring character and as we kept going forward, they picked up my option to be a regular. It's very rare and I'm still quite dumbfounded about it but Glen and I hit it off and I still appreciate him. He wanted to work with me and wrote Sasha for me.\" She was promoted to a series regular for season 4 with Emily Kinney and Coleman.\n\nAfter auditioning for the role of Michonne, she read the first three volumes of the graphic novels in preparation for the television series. Knowing they were different, she chose not to continue reading the comic book series to avoid being aware of future storylines that may occur on the television series. Martin-Green's performance as Sasha, particularly in the fifth season and seventh season, has received favorable reviews.\n\nAfter filming for the third season of The Walking Dead ended, Martin-Green was cast in the second season of Once Upon a Time playing the recurring role of Tamara, a woman determined to rid the world of magic. She returned briefly in the third season before returning to her regular role as Sasha on The Walking Dead. As of the first episode of sixth season, Martin-Green's name appears in the opening credits.\n\nIn December 2016, her role as the lead actor of Star Trek: Discovery as a lieutenant commander of the USS Discovery was made public. She debuted as First Officer Michael Burnham in \"The Vulcan Hello\" on September 24, 2017.\n\nMartin-Green has been married to fellow actor Kenric Green since December 4, 2010. They met while acting together in the play, Fetch Clay, Make Man, at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2015, in Los Angeles, Martin-Green gave birth to a boy named Kenric Justin Green II after his father. Martin-Green was pregnant during filming of the fifth season of The Walking Dead, which she covered up using thick layers and using larger guns. She and her husband are vegans.\n\nSince April 2016, she has been an ambassador for Stand Up to Cancer, encouraging clinical trials, having a three-time cancer surviving mother and a sister with breast cancer.\n\nVera Farmiga is an American actress who has received an Academy Award nomination for her role in Up in the Air (2009) and Primetime Emmy Award nominations for her roles in Bates Motel (2013) and When They See Us (2019).\n\nShe was born Vera Ann Farmiga, the second of seven children, on August 6, 1973, in Clifton, New Jersey, USA, to Ukrainian parents. She did not speak English until the age of six, and was raised in the Ukrainian Catholic home of her mother, Luba (Spas), a schoolteacher, and her father, Michael Farmiga, a computer systems analyst.

Farmiga initially dreamed of becoming an optometrist, but she later changed her mind and studied acting at Syracuse University's School of Performing Arts, graduating in 1995. The following year, she began her professional acting career, making her Broadway debut as an understudy in the play \"Taking Sides\". Her stage credits included performances in \"The Tempest\", \"Good\", \"The Seagull\", and in a well-reviewed off-Broadway production of \"Second-Hand Smoke\" (1997). That same year, she made her television debut as the female lead, opposite a then-unknown Heath Ledger, in Fox's adventure series Conor, der Kelte (1997).\n\nIn 1998, Farmiga made her big screen debut in the drama Für das Leben eines Freundes (1998), then played the daughters of Christopher Walken in Sein letzter Coup (1999) and Richard Gere in Es begann im September (2000).

Farmiga's acting talent shone in a range of characters, from her role as a senator's daughter in Der Manchurian Kandidat (2004), the wife of a mobster in Running Scared (2006), a humorous prostitute in Breaking & Entering - Einbruch und Diebstahl (2006), and a police psychiatrist in Departed: Unter Feinden (2006).\n\nIn 2010, Farmiga received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in Up in the Air (2009). In 2011, she made her directorial debut with the drama Higher Ground - Der Ruf nach Gott (2011), in which she also appeared in the leading role.
