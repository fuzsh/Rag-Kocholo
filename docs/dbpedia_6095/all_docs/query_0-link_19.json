        "text": "I take notes like some people take drugs.\n\nThere is an eight-foot stretch of shelves in my house containing nothing but full notebooks.\n\nSome would call this hypergraphia (Dostoevsky was a member of this club), but I trust the weakest pen more than the strongest memory, and note taking is—in my experience—one of the most important skills for converting excessive information into precise action and follow-up.\n\nSimple but effective note taking enables me to:\n\n-Review book highlights in less than 10 minutes\n\n-Connect scattered notes on a single theme in 10 minutes that would otherwise require dozens of hours\n\n-Contact and connect mentors with relevant questions and help I can offer\n\n-Impose structure on information for increased retention and recall\n\nI fashion myself a note-taking geek of the first class. How dare I self-appoint myself into this priesthood? Relax, script kiddies. I’m using a much broader definition of “geek,” this one borrowed from “Understanding Geeks” in the current issue of Inc. Magazine (that said, I was recently on Geekbrief.tv, birthplace of the ubercool iYule.tv):\n\n“Someone with an intense curiosity about a specific subject. Not limited to tech–there are also gaming geeks, music geeks, etc.”\n\nHere are a few recommendations from inside the world of a compulsive note taker, including both the macro (books and notepad principles) and micro (page features and formatting):\n\n1. Create an indexing system:\n\nIndexing AJ Jacobs’ latest book (click to enlarge all thumbnails)\n\nInformation is useful only to the extent that you can find it when you need it. Most of us have the experience of note proliferation—notes on the backs of envelopes, billing statements, hotel paper, etc.–that somehow never gets consolidated. Consolidate and create an index.\n\nMy favorite notepads (covered below) generally don’t have page numbers off the shelf. Here’s how you progress with a non-paginated pad:\n\nA. Put page numbers on the upper-right of each right-hand page but not on the left (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). I do about 30 pages at a time, as needed.\n\nB. Whenever you complete a page, put the page number in an index on the inside cover (front or back) and a few words to describe the content.\n\nIf it’s on the left-hand page, just take the prior page and add “.5” to it. Thus, if you flip over page 10, for example, and write on the back, that second page is “10.5” in the index.\n\nBrainstorming blog post topics and paginating on the right-hand pages\n\nThe page numbers in the index do NOT need to be in order, as you’ll be scanning for content, then referring to the page. If you write on the same topic again, simply put that page number next to the previous index entry.\n\nCreating an index like this for non-fiction books I read allows me to refer back and review key concepts in 5-10 minutes without rereading the entire book and searching for underlined sections.\n\nNotes from “The Biology of Sleep” at Stanford University (Notice the bottom-right square allocated to follow-up questions, which is standard)\n\n2. Choose the Proper Pad for the Job:\n\nMy current repetoire of active notepads.\n\nNot all notepads are created equal.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that one is better for all things, just that you should match the form factor and durability of a notepad to the content.\n\nBelow is a photo of several different notepads I use:\n\n-I use the big notebook, which contains graph paper, for larger projects such as future books, TV programs, feature-length articles, LitLiberation, conference panel notes, etc. I don’t want to turn 10 pages to get an overview of all the pieces of a single topic/event. Cons: terrible for traveling and intimidating for interview subjects. The larger the pad, the more reserved interviewees will be.\n\nNotes from my first SXSW (Notice the bottom-right follow-up, in this case, people to contact)\n\nSXSW panel titled “Blog to Book”; Notice the bottom panel and how I number the participants so I can just label comments/notes with each respective number. No spacial guessing required.\n\n-I use the hard-backed red rectangular notebook, bought in Milan, as a default notepad. It is the perfect fits-in-ass-pocket checkbook size. Telephone interview notes, lists (dreamlining, asset assessment, cash-flow projections), projects requiring less than 3 hours to complete, random observations about emotional state or internal problem solving, random silliness like songs (think Adam Sandler), etc. Here is one beauty, written at 4am during an airport layover after a sleepless red eye:\n\nTriple Threat\n\nThe fattest midget I ever met\n\nSome called him the triple threat\n\nUgly, dirty, and smelly yet\n\nThe fattest midget I ever met.\n\nHey… if you’re bound to have rare flashes of insight/stupidity, you might as well capture them on paper.\n\n-The flexible softcover moleskine is excellent for interviews, especially if you are in motion or in the field. I’ve found, however, that if that is the only notebook I carry, I put in material I would prefer to preserve for months or years, and the soft moleskine gets ripped to pieces in backpacks, luggage, and pockets over just a few weeks. There are hardback versions, but they tend to be square-ish and fit poorly in pockets. I limit this format to interviews, contact info when on the run, and temporary to-do/not-to-do lists.\n\nI don’t use digital notetaking tools. Call me old-fashioned, but I’ve noticed that some of the most innovative techies in Silicon Valley do the same, whether with day-planner calendars, memo pads, or just simple notecards with a binder clip. It’s a personal choice, and I like paper. It can be lost, but it can’t be deleted, and I find it faster.\n\n###\n\nOdds and Ends: My $2,600 Date and a Challenge\n\nThe $2,600 Date:\n\nSo, what happened after I auctioned myself off for literacy fundraising on eBay?\n\nQuite a few of you have asked, so here’s the scoop. The $2,600 date took place this past Saturday, and we had an AWESOME time. I promised I wouldn’t show pictures, but the smart young lass looks a lot like Natalie Portman, so the night immediately started off on a much-relieved foot. She’s a veeeery pretty girl.\n\nBig smiles all around.\n\nFestivities began at the famous Alfredo’s Steakhouse in SF, where Marco made the meal one to remember. The delicious medium-rare Chicago steaks were matched with wine I brought along, in this case, a particularly sentimental and special bottle: Rombauer Vineyards’ Proprietor Selection 2004 Zinfandel (think of it as this wine on steroids).\n\nBigger smiles all around.\n\nOnce full and well buzzed, we set off for the beginning of entertainment: seats 10 feet from the main platform at Cirque du Soleil’s Kooza. It was incredible, and as an acrobatics fetishist, it was in seventh heaven. Hard drumming, aerials, gainers, wheels of death… Here’s just a taste of what we feasted our eyes on:\n\nAfter Cirque du Soleil… well, I’ll leave the rest of the date to your overactive imaginations! It’s entirely possible nothing happened, but if it had, I wouldn’t be one to kiss and tell. Some things are more fun left unexplained 🙂\n\nThe Dream Date Challenge:\n\nWhat would your dream date look like?\n\nPick a city anywhere in the world, and for a budget of no more than $500, describe your dream date in 300 words or less (bullet points are fine). My favorite 5 will get at least 12 copies of the 1st printing (it’s now in the 25th) of The 4-Hour Workweek to give away as X-mas/Festivus presents.\n\nBe specific… but go nuts!\n\nRelated"
