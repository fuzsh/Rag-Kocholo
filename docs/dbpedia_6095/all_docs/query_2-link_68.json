        "text": "Not a shocking surprise that Corbett is a big MAGAT-the former Mrs Derek has been a big Republican supporter going way back to \"W\" Bush, and maybe even before.\n\nI wonder if it means that John Derek was a rabid Republican too? Obviously there are several well known couples who don't necessarily agree politically, but knowing how controlling John was, and how young and impressionable Bo was when they hooked up, it makes more sense that John's politics were also on the conservative side.\n\nAgain, I know it's wrong to assume Derek was Republican leaning, but if that indeed was the case, just another example of the \"family values\" party in action. Didn't he leave his first wife and children (including a disabled child) and screw around with Ursula Andress while still married? Not to mention screwing an underage Bo while still married to Linda Evans, and leaving the country with Bo so he wouldn't be charged with statutory rape? Yes the party of \"family values\" and the religious right doing what they do best: acting like dishonest, hypocritical , sanctimonious idiots.\n\nHas MAGAT Bo ever publicly stated her position on Abortion? Her party was successful in reversing Roe v Wade and is responsible for outlawing abortion in several Republican states. Don't tell me if Bo had gotten pregnant at 16 or whatever age she was when they hooked up, John wouldn't have insisted she have an abortion.\n\nSorry, I should have apologized earlier for this way off topic post.\n\nGetting back to the topic at hand, did \"My Big Fat Greek whatever the F\" Part II make a lot of money? I guess the studio was hoping that lightning will strike thrice.\n\nI'm assuming DL fave Lainie Kazan is in this shitfest? Hopefully she was paid enough to afford a week's groceries, and maybe a trip to McDonald's as a bonus. Seriously (I know, off topic again) WTF was that Lainie shoplifting groceries all about? Was she really that broke that she couldn't afford a week's groceries? Wasn't it Christmas Eve?\n\nI know she has a daughter. If Lainie was really that hard up, I would think her daughter would give her Mom some cash to tide her over, or at least offer to pay her grocery bill until she got back on her feet.\n\nWatched last night. Who the hell was the grey haired aunt? Looked her up and apparently she was in the first one but I have zero memory of her and I watched the original only a few weeks ago. She was terrible, unfunny and practically the star after Nia and Corbett. She had more lines than Lainie Kazan, Andrea Martin and Gia Carides combined. Maybe Lainie didn't want to travel but to have her character not only lose her husband but then have Dementia is not the fodder for a comedy.\n\nNia must have had a contracted running time and got into trouble in the editing, because it just ended, no goodbyes to the town that welcomed them, just cut to them all on the plane home sleeping. Just a really sloppy money grab."
