        "text": "Before Midnight, 2013\n\nRichard Linklater\n\nThe third and final film in Richard Linklater’s trilogy, Before Midnight finds Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reminiscing about their love and life together on holiday in Greece. They're on the Peloponnese peninsula, where they spend their evening together, watching the sun set the sky ablaze in orange before it dips into the dusky sea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nBoy on a Dolphin, 1957\n\nJean Negulesco\n\nThis was the first Hollywood film shot in Greece, and Italian actress Sophia Loren’s English-language debut as a dazzling sponge diver. Loren discovers a sunken ship off the coast of the Aegean Sea filled with priceless treasures, including an ancient gold statue of a boy on a dolphin. Archaeologist Alan Ladd and antiques dealer Clifton Webb vie for both her attention and the artifact. All this is set against the backdrop of the mystical island of Hydra.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nEleni 1985\n\nPeter Yates\n\nJohn Malkovich is a New York Times journalist sent to a post in Greece, where he takes the opportunity to investigate and exact revenge on the Communist guerrillas who killed his mother during the civil war 30 years prior. The plot is heavy but the remote village where the story unfolds is filled with centuries-old olive trees and traditional stone cottages.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nGreek author Theo Angelopoulos paints a picture of the ancient islands away from the tourist beaches, instead focusing on ailing poet Alexander (Bruno Ganz) musing on his life as he travels Greece in the company of an Albanian boy he’s taken under his wing.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMamma Mia, 2008\n\nPhyllida Lloyd\n\nLove it or hate it, this movie—based on the 1999 musical set to the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA—delivers some of the most alluring shots of Greece in film. Shot mostly on the island of Skopelos, the film features an all-star cast consisting of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Baranski, Stellan Skarsgård, Amanda Seyfried, and Dominic Cooper. As they synchronize swim in the “can’t believe it’s that blue” sea to the songs of ABBA, one can almost hear the call of the Sirens. For more, there’s Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again!, which premiered in 2018 and is a series of flashbacks of a young Donna (Meryl Streep) and her life in England before moving to Greece.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMediterraneo, 1991\n\nGabriele Salvatores\n\nAfter their ship is sunk by the Allies during WWII, a group of misfit Italian soldiers wash up on what they thought to be a deserted island—only to discover there are people. Soon, they forget they are in the middle of a war. They pass the hours playing soccer with the locals, bobbing about the sea in tiny fishing boats, and learning how to dance like the Greeks.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nMy Life in Ruins, 2009\n\nDonald Petrie\n\nNia Vardalos never actually gets to Greece in My Big Fat Greek Wedding but the film’s sequel finds her traversing Greece as a tour guide. She hits up all the obvious tourist destinations including the Parthenon and the Acropolis—the film marked the first time that an American film studio was allowed to shoot on location at the historic site.\n\nNever on Sunday, 1960\n\nJules Dassin\n\nIn this romantic comedy, Ilya is a free-spirited Greek prostitute living in the port of Piraeus. She’s out on the town—downing ooza and dancing the Sirtaki with a different gentleman friend—every day except for, as the title suggests, Sunday. Its star, Melina Mercouri, won best actress for playing Ilya at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nPhaedra, 1962\n\nJules Dassin\n\nPhaedra (Melina Mercouri), the wife of a shipping tycoon, wants for nothing—except for her husband’s son (Anthony Perkins) from his first marriage, who she instantly falls in love with. The two begin an affair, which has devastating results. It’s a bit of a Greek tragedy but there are magnificent moments of island life (Hydra) along the way.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nShirley Valentine, 1986\n\nJules Dassin\n\nIn this dry British comedy, bored English housewife Shirley Valentine impulsively joins her friend on a trip to Greece where she embarks on a holiday romance with a local taverna owner. She realizes her dreams of sipping wine by the sea and sunsets and skinny dips with her new lover named Costas—it’s a quintessential holiday film.\n\nSisterhood of the Traveling Pants, 2005\n\nKen Kwapis\n\nSpending their first summer apart, four teenage American best friends played by Blake Lively, Alexis Bledel, Amber Tamblyn, and America Ferrera promise to keep in touch by sharing a pair of blue jeans that inexplicably fits them all like a glove. Bledel visits her Greek grandparents in Santorini, Lively departs for soccer camp in Mexico, Tamblyn stays home in Maryland, and Ferrera visits her estranged father in South Carolina. Each find their own version of summertime bliss, but none more so than Lena (Alexis Bledel) who meets the tall, dark, and handsome fisherman Kostas Dounas amongst the whitewashed cubiform homes, rugged hillside, and crystal blue waters of the Aegean Sea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nSuntan, 2016\n\nArgyris Papadimitropoulos\n\nOn an unnamed Greek island, a local doctor spends a dreary winter. But come summer, the pleasure-seeking vacationers arrive. The doctor falls for a tourist who lures him into a hard-partying binge with late-night dance parties at the beach followed by lazy days spent recovering beneath the sun. She's just having fun but he's on the verge of complete obsession.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Greek Tycoon, 1978\n\nJ. Lee Thompson\n\nA film à clef starring Anthony Quinn as a Greek shipping heir—based on Aristotle Onassis—and his love affair with Jacqueline Bisset, based on First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Though the film bombed at the box office, the allure of the lavish jet-set characters and the scenes of labyrinthine streets leading to whitewashed villas are hard to deny.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Guns of Navarone, 1961\n\nJ. Lee Thompson\n\nInspired by the Battle of Leros during the Dodecanese Campaign of World War II, The Guns of Navarone stars Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and David Niven as Allied soldiers sent to destroy German weapons on the Greek island of Navarone. Yes, it’s technically a war film, but there are some beautiful vistas of Classical ruins and rocky beaches. Fun fact: In one scene, members of the Greek royal family appear in the background as extras.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nThe Trip to Greece, 2020\n\nMichael Winterbottom\n\nThe final installment of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon's riotous sojourns is The Trip to Greece. The pair of comedians are up to their old antics as they traveling from Troy to Ithaca in the mythical footsteps of Odysseus. There’s a particularly hilarious scene where the two vie for the best Arnold Schwarzenegger impression and almost forget how beautiful their seaside luncheon is.\n\nThe Two Faces of January, 2014\n\nHossein Amini\n\nA twisty tale of extortion and murder, this is the story of a holiday gone wrong. But before all that, the vacationers, played by Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst, are enjoying Athens, touring the Acropolis and taking meals alfresco. Plus, given that the film is set in 1962, there's some great fashion for Dunst's character.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nZorba the Greek, 1964\n\nMichael Cacoyannis\n\nAnthony Quinn will forever be associated with his role as Zorba the Greek, immortalized in the iconic Sirtaki dancing scene, filmed on the beach in Crete. The epic film showcases rural Greek life including mining and logging communities in Crete, to the coastal town of Chania. Though black-and-white, it’s easy to imagine the deep blue of the sea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nA Touch of Spice, 2003\n\nTassos Boulmetis\n\nA young boy stays connected to his childhood city of Istanbul through cooking his grandfather’s recipes after his family is deported to Athens, Greece—a result of the anti-Greek activities undertaken by the Turkish government in the late 1950s. Scenes of a bustling Istanbul and Athens create the backdrop for this foodie film.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nWhen you buy something through our retail links, we earn an affiliate commission."
