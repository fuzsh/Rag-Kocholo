        "text": "Marc Forster (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner, Christopher Robin, Monster’s Ball) and noted screenwriter David Magee (Finding Neverland, Life of Pi) have previously collaborated on the critically acclaimed and award-winning Finding Neverland for which Forster was nominated for a Best Director BAFTA and Magee was nominated for an Oscar® and BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for an Oscar® and BAFTA for Best Film.\n\nMarc Forster stated: \"When I first read Fredrik Backman’s novel, I fell in love with the notion that friendship has the power to shape a person’s life. I can’t wait to create a film with so much humor and heart alongside Tom and Rita.”\n\nFredrik Wikström Nicastro of SF Studios is producing the film with Rita Wilson (Mamma Mia!, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2), and Playtone partners Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman. Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Cast Away, Forrest Gump) will also star in the leading role. Principal photography will commence in 2022. Marc Forster will also serve as Executive Producer alongside Renée Wolfe via their production company 2DUX2.\n\nRita Wilson said: “Fredrik Backman wrote a novel that has entertained, moved and inspired countless readers through his character of “Ove”. The humanity of the story has resonated with people all over the world, including myself. I have always looked for films that bring people joy and, hopefully, create a common experience of recognizing ourselves in others. It’s an honor to be producing this movie and to be bringing it to audiences everywhere.”\n\nFredrik Wikström said: “Marc has made many films we love. His unique ability to tell human stories that strongly connect with audiences, makes him the perfect filmmaker to helm this beloved story. We couldn´t be more excited to have him and David Magee on board - bringing their magic to screens again, following their successful collaboration on Finding Neverland.”\n\nThe film is based on the Swedish international best-selling novel by Fredrik Backman, a life affirming comedy about love and unexpected friendships. It has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide and remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 77 consecutive weeks at the time of its release. The novel was subsequently adapted for the big screen by SF Studios and released in 2015. The Swedish language film was nominated for two Academy Awards® including Best Foreign Language Film and was the highest grossing foreign language film in the United States in 2016.\n\nMichael Porseryd, CEO at SF Studios said: “Both the novel and the Swedish film adaptation of A Man Called Ove were huge successes due to the poignant and timeless story of love, loss, family and friendships. To now have the opportunity to create a US adaptation with this high calibre of cast, producers and the incredibly versatile and skilled Marc Forster at the helm is a dream! It is a fantastic milestone for SF Studios in our 102-year history as a film studio.”\n\nThe US adaptation of A Man Called Ove is one of many high-profile projects lined up by SF Studios, including the highly anticipated large-scale Swedish film adaption The Emigrants, the Danish epic drama Margrete - Queen of the North, the Norwegian feature film Quisling and the Swedish original series Snabba Cash for Netflix. Previous international releases include Borg vs. McEnroe starring Sverrir Gudnasson and Stellan Skarsgård and the thriller Horizon Line starring Allison Williams and Alexander Dreymon.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nSF Studios contacts:\n\nFredrik Wikström Nicastro, SVP International Production, Fredrik.WikstromNicastro@sfstudios.se, +46 70 413 63 83\n\nMalin Strihagen, Vice President Brand & Communications, Malin.Strihagen@sfstudios.se, +46 70 780 39 35\n\nAbout SF Studios\n\nFor more than 100 years, SF Studios has been a leading Nordic film and TV studio that has produced some of cinema’s most iconic films and worked with some of the greatest talents in the industry, such as Ingmar Bergman, Ingrid Bergman and Greta Garbo.
