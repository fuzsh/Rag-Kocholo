        "text": "Tom Hanks is an American actor and producer who has had an extensive career in films, television and on stage. Hanks made his professional acting debut on stage playing Grumio, in the Great Lakes Theater production of The Taming of the Shrew (1977). He made his film debut with a minor role in the horror film He Knows You're Alone (1980). In the same year, Hanks appeared in the television series Bosom Buddies. His role in the show led to guest appearances on a variety of long running television shows including Happy Days. Hanks' appearance on the show led film director Ron Howard to cast him in his first leading role in the fantasy romantic comedy Splash (1984). His breakthrough role was in the age-changing comedy Big (1988), for which he garnered his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1993, he starred with Meg Ryan in the Nora Ephron-directed romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle. Later that year, he played the role of a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS, fighting discrimination in his law firm in the drama Philadelphia. For his performance, Hanks earned his first Academy Award for Best Actor. He followed with this with the romantic comedy-drama Forrest Gump (1994), for which he received a consecutive second Academy Award for Best Actor, the first since Spencer Tracy in 1938 to achieve this feat. In 1995, he played astronaut Jim Lovell, in Howard-directed historical drama, Apollo 13, and voiced Sheriff Woody in the animated film Toy Story.\n\nHanks made his debut as a director and screenwriter in the 1996 musical comedy That Thing You Do! Later in the same year, he founded with Gary Goetzman, his production company Playtone. In 1998, Hanks executive produced the Emmy Award-winning docudrama miniseries From the Earth to the Moon and starred in Steven Spielberg-directed epic war film, Saving Private Ryan, which earned him his fourth nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Later that year, he reunited with Meg Ryan in another Ephron directed-romantic comedy, You've Got Mail. In 2000, Hanks starred in Cast Away, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and a fifth nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2001, he executive produced Emmy Award-winning World War II mini-series Band of Brothers, and the romantic comedy, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The following year at the age of 45, he became the youngest person to receive the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\n\nIn 2006, he played Professor Robert Langdon in the Howard-directed adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name, The Da Vinci Code. Two years later he executive produced musical comedy Mamma Mia (2008), and Emmy Award-winning mini-series John Adams (2008). Hanks made his Broadway debut in 2013 in Ephron's play, Lucky Guy, which earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. He portrayed television personality Fred Rogers in the 2019 drama, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, for which he garnered nominations for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nStage[]\n\nYear Title Theatre Role Ref(s) 1977 The Taming of the Shrew Lakewood Civic Auditorium Grumio Hamlet Lakewood Civic Auditorium Soldier, Reynaldo 1978 Polly Lakewood Civic Auditorium Hacker The Two Gentlemen of Verona Lakewood Civic Auditorium Proteus The Wild Oats Lakewood Civic Auditorium Muz King John Lakewood Civic Auditorium Robert Faulconbridge 1979 Twelfth Night Lakewood Civic Auditorium Fabian Juno and the Paycock Lakewood Civic Auditorium Jerry Devine Do Me a Favorite Lakewood Civic Auditorium Harold The Mandrake Riverside Shakespeare Theater Callimaco 2013 Lucky Guy Broadhurst Theatre Mike McAlary 2018 Henry IV Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles Sir John Falstaff\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Credited as Notes Ref(s) Actor Producer Other Role(s) 1980 He Knows You're Alone Yes No No Elliot 1984 Splash Yes No No Allen Bauer Bachelor Party Yes No No Rick Gassko 1985 The Man with One Red Shoe Yes No No Richard Harlan Drew Volunteers Yes No No Lawrence Whatley Bourne III 1986 The Money Pit Yes No No Walter Fielding, Jr. Nothing in Common Yes No No David Basner Every Time We Say Goodbye Yes No No David Bradley 1987 Dragnet Yes No No Detective Pep Streebek 1988 Big Yes No No Josh Baskin Punchline Yes No No Steven Gold 1989 The 'Burbs Yes No No Ray Peterson Turner & Hooch Yes No No Detective Scott Turner 1990 Joe Versus the Volcano Yes No No Joe Banks The Bonfire of the Vanities Yes No No Sherman McCoy 1992 Radio Flyer Yes No No Older Mike/Narrator Cameo A League of Their Own Yes No No Jimmy Dugan 1993 Sleepless in Seattle Yes No No Sam Baldwin Philadelphia Yes No No Andrew Beckett 1994 Forrest Gump Yes No No Forrest Gump 1995 Apollo 13 Yes No No Jim Lovell Toy Story Yes No No Sheriff Woody Voice role 1996 That Thing You Do!
