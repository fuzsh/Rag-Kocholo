        "text": "New movie with Nia Vardalos, the star of “My Big Fat Greek Wedding”\n\nMy life in Ruins is an upcoming American romantic comedy movie, set in the archaeological sites of Greece. It will have an international premiere on May 2nd at the Tribeca Film Festival, which runs from April 22 to May 3, 2009.\n\nMy life in Ruins is set among the ruins of Ancient Greece, featuring Delphi, Epidaurus, Ancient Olympia, and the Acropolis. It’s the first time that the Greek Government has officially permitted these masterpieces to be featured in the movie; Nia Vardalos, who stars in the film, sought permission to shoot several scenes on the Acropolis, as it has been a lifelong dream for her to shoot a movie at her homeland, Greece.\n\nThe film is about a tour guide who takes her group to Athens and other archaeological sites in Greece. The group is more interested in shopping than learning about the rich Greek history and everything seems to go wrong, until the moment that a tourist reminds the tour guide that sometimes love can be found in the most unusual places.\n\nThe movie has received the honor of being the closing night event at the Tribeca Fest. Director Donald Petrie said, “We are excited and thrilled that My Life in Ruins is receiving the honor of being the closing night event at the Tribeca Fest. I can’t think of a better launching pad for our film.”\n\nThe movie is produced by Play Tone, the company run by Tom Hanks and his half Greek wife, Rita Wilson. My Life in Ruins stars Nia Vardalos, Richard Dreyfuss, María Ádanez, Sheila Bernette, María Botto, Rachel Dratch, Alexis Georgoulis.\n\nThe film will launch in the USA on June 5th and May7th in Greece."
