        "text": "Ever since Brian Henderson famously diagnosed the death of romantic comedy in 1978 there have been numerous attempts to \"kill\" the genre. In view of its apparent lack of popularity in the 2010s, scholars and popular culture writers are proclaiming, once more, its demise. This article aims to question this view, arguing that the genre is alive and well, though living largely on the margins and finding alternative ways to re-imagine itself. It interrogates the term \"independent\" and uses genre theory to produce a non-taxonomical definition of the \"indie rom-com\" in the 2010s. With this purpose, this work outlines the basic conventions of these films and ends with a close analysis of a recent indie rom-com: Jim Strouse's People, Places, Things (2015). The essay concludes that the relative mainstream dearth of the genre is masking a notable presence in other less visible sites. Contemporary romantic comedy is currently leading a \"secret life\" right before our eyes, independent cinema being rife with exciting examples of the genre. These films are finding new formulas that will eventually result in the reinvention of the genre at a larger scale, and not just in the independent sector. Amor en los márgenes: la comedia romántica independiente estadounidense en la década de los 2010s Desde que Brian Henderson diagnosticara la muerte de la comedia romántica en 1978 ha habido numerosos intentos de acabar con ella por parte de la crítica. A la vista de su aparente pérdida de popularidad en la última década, se está proclamando, una vez más, el fin del género tanto en el ámbito académico como en el popular. Este artículo se propone\n\nThe essay examines formal and informal film distribution in Greece since the financial crisis of 2009. By ‘formal’ I refer mainly to commercially organized theatrical, DVD and online distribution, while ‘informal’ consists of various networks of unlicensed circulation of films, usually referred to as ‘piracy’. The essay’s aims are threefold. As a media industries study, it focuses on formal distribution; it identifies the players that are involved in the process of rights acquisition and promotion of feature films in Greece, and explains their working practices. From a film studies perspective, it explores the mediating role of – both formal and informal – film distribution in helping (re)define and question the notion of national cinema. And finally, from a broader cultural studies angle, it presents a profile of the country in terms of which films are in circulation and how they are being watched, while pointing to comparisons with global and other national patterns of change. The essay positions Greece in the broader context of recent debates around contemporary film distribution and piracy, highlights methodological issues, and identifies the way in which global distribution practices manifest themselves locally in a specific ‘small’ territory of the European periphery.\n\nPage 1. Girl Meets Girl: Lesbian Romantic Comedies and the Public Sphere Kelly Ann McWilliam BA (Hons), GC Arts A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Queensland in May 2006. ABSTRACT: Six decades after the romantic comedy emerged as a Hollywood genre in 1934, the first romantic comedies with a central lesbian couple, including Marita Giovanni’s Bar Girls and Rose Troche’s Go Fish, were released in 1994. This study argues that Bar Girls and Go Fish represent the first in a group of films whose numbers and similarities enable their consideration as a romantic comedy sub-genre, namely the ‘lesbian romantic comedy’. This study identifies and analyses this sub-genre. It contends that these films have emerged as the predominant (and perhaps only) form of mainstream lesbian feature film in the United States of America in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet, despite their relative prominence for more than a decade, they remain vastly under-examined areas in scholarship on both film genre and lesbian culture. This project aims to contribute to these areas by producing the first full-length survey of the sub-genre and the first study of any length to focus exclusively on it. This study concentrates on ten lesbian romantic comedies: Bar Girls (1994), Go Fish (1994), Maria Maggenti’s The Incredibly True Adventure of 2 Girls in Love (1995), Kelli Herd’s It’s in the Water (1996), Julia Dyer’s Late Bloomers (1996), Emma-Kate Croghan’s Love and Other Catastrophes (1996), Heidi Arnesen’s Some Prefer Cake (1997), Anne Wheeler’s Better than Chocolate (1999), Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader (1999), and Helen Lesnick’s A Family Affair (2001). While this project employs textual analysis as its primary methodology to examine these films, these analyses take place more broadly within a public sphere framework. Consistent with a wider shift in analyses of lesbian and gay cultural products, this framework allows a consideration of the larger public stakes of lesbian romantic comedies and, in particular, their introduction of lesbian content into a heterocentric genre. Specifically, this project argues that the introduction of lesbian content—or the replacement of ‘boy meets girl’ with ‘girl meets girl’—destabilises the genre in significant ways, but that the genre itself equally restricts the representation of lesbianism possible within it. Ultimately, this project proposes a reading of lesbian romantic comedies as conservative and progressive, conventional and subversive, but as nonetheless complex texts that offer a range of pleasures and readings to their audiences and a range of challenges to the genre itself. Such a reading reveals the complexity and negotiation inherent in these films’ position as independent films presenting culturally and politically marginal content in a mainstream genre."
