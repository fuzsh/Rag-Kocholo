        "text": "(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nsame.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nwell this sucks\n\nObviously, it could be worse. Katherine Heigl starred in the notorious ZYZZYX ROAD, which made thirty dollars domestically.\n\nlol\n\nHow does that even happen? That's BEYOND a fail!\n\nI just found an article from a few years ago in EW talking about why it made only 30 bucks\n\n(no subject) - fil0li Expand\n\n(no subject) - ahkna Expand\n\n(no subject) - frenchverbs Expand\n\n(no subject) - para1 Expand\n\n(no subject) - marmar627 Expand\n\ni heard of them because i visit scene release sites but i didn't even bother to download them.\n\nKatherine Heigl starred in the notorious ZYZZYX ROAD, which made thirty dollars domestically\n\nomg, is that even possible?\n\nNo but seriously, we need less romantic comedies in the world. It's the same bullcrap over and over.\n\nagreed!\n\nplease we need a lot less of the majority of the films released.\n\nThe story is basically that it was never meant to be a real theatrical release. They released it to one theater to fulfill some SAG rule so they could pay the actors a lower rate and the only people that went to see it were the makeup artist, her friend, and a couple of randoms who were probably there for the a/c.\n\nI want a happy fluffy romantic comedy that has a shockingly bloody ending.\n\nI'm in love with your icon.\n\nand I'm in love with BOTH of your icons. Andrewww <3\n\nomg, yours is lovely too <3\n\nI like the idea of romantic comedies, they just need to be more original.\n\nthey played my life in ruins during my flight to cali last week. my mom watched it and said it was beyond awful and my mom never complains about movies.\n\nNGL I wanted to watch My Life in Ruins but was thwarted numerous times until it was out of the theater. I'm sure it was for my own good.\n\nThe world works in mysterious ways...\n\nLOL, I know right?\n\ni love your icon\n\nFate (and few of the many snowstorms of early 2008) kept me from being forced into seeing Jumper with my mother.\n\nOh damn.\n\nI haven't even heard of this movie...\n\nI thought it was an extension of \"my life in ruins\".......\n\nmy life in ruins was horrible.\n\nI wanted to watch my life in ruins i didn't know she had another movie damn three screen!damn\n\ni saw my life in ruins....it was really boring.\n\nKatherine Heigl starred in the notorious ZYZZYX ROAD, which made thirty dollars domestically.\n\nfrom imdb: A crew member who took a friend got a refund, so the final domestic box-office gross was $20.\n\nlmao\n\nomgggg that's even worse!!!\n\nWow... haha\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OMG. that is like a slappp in the face.\n\nLOL FOREVER!\n\nlol burn\n\nI mean, considering I have never heard of those films (or the Heigel one) plus the fact they only played in like 3 screens, it was kinda expected right?\n\nI mean shit if the studio isn't gonna promote something, why put it out there? Just let it go straight to DVD or PPV, you can still make a bit more money there just off people renting.\n\nI dont get why studios do this on some technicality which I'm sure they didnt bother to fix or look up alternative options for...\n\nAlso, who the fuck was the freshmen intern who wrote the article?\n\nI completely agree with you, this would never have happened if the studios just released them straight to DVD! but maybe they were expecting what happened with MBFGW to happen with these films.\n\nAnd the writer is actually a full time staff member of the site and she's really talented :) :)\n\nYeah but if they were expecting another Greek wedding they should have promoted it! lol Even that movie had some buzz.\n\nAnd not with that article she aint lol\n\nThat's the thing. I would have never heard of either of these movies except I read a new article about her filming My Life In Ruins in Greece. And then I never heard a thing about it again. I go to movies and check movie listings a lot so I'm pretty sure neither of them played in my city. You spent $17 million, don't you at least want to break even? I guess maybe they make so much money they don't care and just write it off."
