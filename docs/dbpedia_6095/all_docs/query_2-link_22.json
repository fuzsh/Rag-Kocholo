        "text": "Don Juan In Hell, Part 2\n\nTroubled by his recent relationship woes, Frasier goes to the country for peace and quiet, but ends up facing the ghosts of failed relationships past.\n\nThe Doll\n\nAt the screening of a mini-series, the young daughter of a TV exec gets Larry to cut the hair off a beloved doll--which then causes her to throw a fit. To save face, Larry and Jeff steal the head off Jeff's daughter's doll.\n\nDelinquent\n\nWhen a young woman finds a teenage boy asleep and naked in her bedroom, his mother, Bree Walsh (guest star Rita Wilson), is quick to defend him. While Detective Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Detective Stabler (Christopher Meloni) try to figure out what truly happened, they also have to manage the sneaky teenager and his naive mother. As the detectives dig deeper, they discover how deceptive appearances can be.\n\nIt's About Time\n\nSeason Two Premiere. Hannah tries to start fresh by dating a brand new guy and throwing a housewarming party with brand new roommate Elijah, but it's hard to move on when she's still playing nurse to Adam. Marnie gets some bad news at work and a visit from her mom, Shoshanna avoids Ray at the party, and sun-kissed Jessa returns from her honeymoon."
