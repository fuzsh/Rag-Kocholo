        "text": "Maybe you remember the cute comedy “My big fat Greek wedding”? It’s not bad even if you admit you liked it. This film is the perfect example of how a low budget film with nice characters and fun dialogue can become a worldwide hit. The team behind the “Wedding” – producer Tom Hanks and director and actress Nia Vardalos got together again, so they can film the new comedy “My life in ruins.”\n\nThis time, the start from “My big fat Greek wedding” is playing an archeologist, who is devastated after her divorce, so she leaves to work in Greece as a tour guide. The budget of the film is $16 million. The filming started in September in Spain and right now, the last scenes are filmed in Greece – in Delphi and in the Acropolis. Tom Hanks’ company Playtone was the first American company to be allowed by the Greek government to film in the Parthenon.\n\nNia Vardalos did not manage to take advantage of the great success of “My big fat Greek wedding,” which brought her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. In the last few years, her artistic appearances were not very convincing. Some of the first reviews about her role in “My life in ruins” speak about a triumph comeback to the big screen. Some Vardalos’ partners on the screen will be Richard Dreyfuss, the Spanish Maria Adanez and the charming Alexis Georgoulis, who is among the best established young actors in Greece – this is his first part in an American movie. Director of the film is Donald Petri and the distribution rights are held by Echo Bridge. The movie should come out in the big screens in 2008.\n\nThe Greek Ministry of Tourism assumed a part of the budget for the film and the Minister of Tourism Aris Spiliatopoulos visited the film set in Delphi personally."
