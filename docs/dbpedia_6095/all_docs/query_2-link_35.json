The film will be released exclusively in New York and Los Angeles on December 30, 2022, will expand to limited theaters across the U.S. on January 6, 2023 and will then open wide in the U.S. on January 13, 2023.\n\nABOUT THE FILM\n\nFor Otto Anderson, there’s only one way of doing things: the right way. Whether it’s how to park on the street (by permit only), or recycle (cans go in the cans bin, glass goes in the glass bin), lock up a bicycle (on the bike rack – that’s what it’s there for), drive a car (stick shift), or any number of other daily tasks and activities, there’s Otto’s way… and everyone who does anything else is an idiot. “He’s been set in his ways since he was four hours old,” says Tom Hanks, who brings the character to life in A Man Called Otto. “His world is a binary one. The world operates one way and one way only, and that’s according to the rules – and anybody can read the rules, and anybody can follow them.”\n\nThe neighborhood has reached a tenuous status quo – Otto gripes about the rules, and his neighbors accept that that’s just the way Otto is… until a new family moves in across the street, upending everything Otto thought he knew about the way life works.\n\nThe character first appeared in the international bestseller A Man Called Ove by Swedish author Fredrik Backman. Widely read around the world, the book stayed on the New York Times Bestsellers list for 42 weeks. It was then adapted into a feature film in Sweden, where it became a phenomenon; according to the Swedish Film Institute, it is the third-most-watched Swedish film of all time. It was nominated for two Oscars®, including Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nFollowing the success of the novel in the states and the Swedish film, producer Fredrik Wikström Nicastro set out to develop an American retelling of the film. When Rita Wilson and Hanks then saw the Swedish film, they reached out to Nicastro. The producers would join forces, with Hanks starring and SF Studios (who produced and financed the Swedish film) fully financing the film.\n\n“There’s so much about this story that resonated with me,” Wilson says. “The theme of finding hope , finding community with the unlikeliest of people, and learning to accept others that may be different than us made an impact on me. Adding to that was that there are serious themes yet, as in life, even in the most difficult times, we can still laugh. These elements of light breaking through the dark give us hope. And, we can all use a little hope.”\n\n“As a producer, you’re always looking for something that hits you just right – that makes you think, ‘I’ve got to make this movie,’” continues Wilson, who produces alongside Hanks and his Playtone partner Gary Goetzman, as well as Fredrik Wikström Nicastro, who also produced the Swedish film. “Like every other producer who has a great role for an actor, who wouldn’t want Tom Hanks as their star? I felt that Tom would be the perfect person to play that character.”\n\nFor Wilson, this character combined elements of comedy and drama that she wanted to see him bring to theaters. “Tom got his start in comedy, and I was asking him, why hasn’t he done more of that recently? His work has been incredible, but it’s been dramatic. He said, ‘It’s really hard to find projects that have the right comedic sensibility.’ This movie aligned with who he is as an actor, but also what he likes to put out there, and the right comedic take on that.”\n\n“Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor. He’s an icon,” says Marc Forster, who directs the film. “He’s extraordinary. Every role he plays, you believe him in it, because he has this incredible heart so you can relate to him. He comes from comedy and is very good in physical comedy, it's brilliant how he moves and his timing – but at the same time he’s extraordinary as a dramatic actor. In this role, he merges these two skillsets, and that makes Otto unique. You feel him, you laugh at him, you laugh with him, and you cry for what he is going through.”\n\nThat comedic sensibility combined with some of life’s big questions that will bring real emotion. As Wilson points out, “The story is so universal. It deals with so much of what people are going through. What is our purpose? Why are we here? What do we want out of this life? How can we change our perceptions about the people around us?”\n\nExecutive producer Renée Wolfe, who is Marc Forster’s producing partner, says that it is that mix of comedy and big questions that appealed to the director, after previously helming such varied projects from Finding Neverland to the James Bond movie Quantum of Solace. “Marc excels at working with actors to bring out the truth and the honesty of a scene,” says executive producer Renée Wolfe. “To watch him and Tom work together to continually evolve the character of Otto, both in a comedic and dramatic sense, was a pure joy. Tom and Marc shared a common creative language on set that was absolutely beautiful to witness.”\n\n“It’s not easy to make a story that is both personal and at the same time speaks to a universal audience,” Wolfe continues. “In a sense, the character of Otto is a little bit like every one of us. Somewhat Chaplin-like, Otto resonates what much of the world is feeling today – a sense of wanting to connect to each other but not knowing where to start. That’s Marc’s special gift. He saw right away that even though A Man Called Otto is a character study at heart, it was also a story that would speak to audiences everywhere.”\n\n“The comedic elements of the story resonate with all of us because they are so funny and so human,” says Forster. “We all get angry sometimes, and we can see that in Otto. How many people get road rage? That’s not so far from Otto himself.”\n\nTranslating the story to America was both a challenge and organic. “We wanted to make it a very, very American version of the film,” Nicastro continues. “There are a lot of themes that we felt are very relevant for our times – connection and community, letting go of the past and embracing life.”\n\nIt’s not a changing world that has Otto annoyed – it’s that he clearly sees a way the world can operate that would be better for everyone, and a vast populace who cut corners, making everything worse. “Unlike a lot of grumps, he’s not trying to protect his own or maintain a status quo,” Hanks explains. “Otto wants balance and equity for everyone who shares the street, and the best way to share that street is to care for it so that everyone can enjoy its benefits.”\n\n“Every time someone has read the script, or talked to me about the book, they say they know an Otto,” says David Magee, who reunites with Marc Forster after the two collaborated on Finding Neverland at the beginning of their careers. “They have someone in their life – a cousin, a grandfather – who can be cranky or opinionated or strong-willed, sometimes in a way that is frustrating, sometimes in a way that’s hilarious. But underneath that, they understand that it’s a person with a real heart that they care about. In my case, while my father was a very different person, I recognize in him that stoic crankiness when things go wrong.”\n\nAnd things have gone wrong for Otto. “He’s led this ritualistic life, and then suddenly, everything changes for him,” says Hanks. “His wife has passed away. He is forced into retirement. New neighbors move in. He’s feeling like the only thing he has left is his daily routine, and now he thinks he’s fighting his final battle, against the relentlessness of fate.”\n\n“The thing that Otto is dealing with really is time – relentless time that passes – and time ends up being both the villain and the hero of the piece,” Hanks continues. “Otto hates the passing of that time. He rebels against the fact that it's time for him retire. He doesn't appreciate the fact that his wife got older and she developed the great malady of maladies, and her time was up.\n\n“And now, he’s trying to rush time along, to end it all for himself and join her,” says Forster. “But you can’t do that.”\n\nThat’s why he’s so grumpy, says Hanks. With the passing of his wife, Sonya – a courtship that the film lovingly plays out in flashbacks – Otto has lost the sweetness that makes life worth living. “He knew that he was made different by Sonya,” says Hanks. “He knew that his life was inarguably more full. He knew that he had access to a whole different way of thinking, talking, eating, that he never would have had the curiosity in order to pursue if he hadn't met this extraordinary love of his life. He did not have an openness until he married somebody who was open. He did not have empathy until he met somebody who taught him how easy it can be to empathize with somebody. And when she was gone, he thought he was never going to have that back again. And in the early part of the film, he’s actually trying to speed along time. But time takes care of itself. You can’t fight it. He lives another day and he goes from a bad day to a better day.\n\nTime takes care of itself with the appearance of new neighbors – who bring Otto into that better day despite himself. “It’s the last thing he’s anticipating as being the great catalyst for the rest of his days,” says Hanks.\n\nThe idea of forging community where you find it with the people who are literally closest to you – your neighbors – seems to be an idea that resonates with Hanks; the last time he filmed in Pittsburgh, it was to bring to life America’s foremost neighbor, Fred Rogers, with his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\n“The thing that fills the void in our lives is each other – ourselves – our neighbors,” says Hanks. “Even if you don’t like each other, even if you have great cultural differences, religion or heritage or politics, sooner or later, they’re going to need your help and you’re going to need theirs. If you don’t know how to bleed your radiators, who are you going to turn to? When the tornadoes always hit, what's the first thing that happens? Neighbors come out with chainsaws and U-Hauls. A Man Called Otto puts that idea forward – it is a movie about community and a movie about family.”\n\n“All over the world, people are becoming very divided and polarized. We’re just not connecting with our neighbors, our communities. So I think this story about human connection has never been more relevant,” says Nicastro.\n\nThe new family across the street is Marisol (played by Mexican star Mariana Treviño), her husband, Tommy (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and their two children, Abbie and Luna (with one on the way). And no matter how cantankerous Otto gets, they keep coming back. “They are not afraid of Otto,” says Hanks. “They have an appreciation for what he brings to the neighborhood and understand that, at the end of the day, he’s a fair guy. I think Otto won the lottery when it comes down to Marisol moving in across the street, because Marisol is curious. She’s gregarious. She’s open-minded. And she is forthright in her affection, even for a guy like Otto.”\n\n“Otto’s relationship with Marisol is the heart of the film,” says Forster. “Marisol is just a wonderful, lovely character. There’s this comedic conflict right away between them, because they’re both very strong characters who don’t take no for an answer – they’re a mirror to each other. And because they’re a mirror to each other, they warm each other up. She really is the key to his heart.”\n\n“Her family brings all of this life, brimming with love and noise and joy and the everyday actions of living, barging into Otto’s closed-in life,” says Treviño. “She’s insistently trying to communicate with him, not in an invasive way, but in a way that makes herself present to connect with people.”\n\n“The way Otto perceives that changes throughout the movie,” Treviño continues, “he doesn’t know how to manage her in the beginning – her no-nonsense, in-your-face frankness of presence. But it’s really just an openness to what life brings. And he starts giving in to this life force.”\n\nTreviño was excited to be a part of the project not only to have the chance to act opposite Hanks, but also because the story’s unique mix of humor and dramatic situations feels drawn from real life. “I think that comedy most of the time comes from a very serious, even painful place – a personal or social wound,” she says. “The comedy and the drama of life is always intermingled, because we’re always fluctuating between those two lines of accepting and healing life.”\n\nPlus, Treviño adds, the characters are drawn in a way that is not overly saccharine or sentimental. “They’re endearing without realizing it,” she says.\n\n“For a director, you feel very blessed when you have two actors who have a true, artistic connection like Tom and Mariana do,” adds Forster. “They elevate what’s on the page and bring magic out onscreen. It makes your heart open, and it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You can’t ask for more.”\n\nAs Tommy, Hanks suggested the actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who he shared the screen with in Greyhound. As a character actor often called upon to play tough guys – which he does to perfection in movies like The Magnificent Seven and 6 Underground – he embraced the opportunity to play a dad, an IT professional, underneath a big friendly moustache and a mop of curly hair.\n\n“I fell in love with him because he’s such a nice guy,” says Garcia-Rulfo. “He has a huge heart, very committed to his family. He’s one of those characters who thinks he’s very cool and a great handyman when actually he’s very clumsy and not a very useful kind of man, physically. Otto thinks he’s a nitwit but Tommy is amazed by Otto – like when Tommy can’t parallel park the trailer, and Otto does it in one go. For him, Otto is everything.”\n\nAs Marisol comes into his life, Otto starts attracting others who need his help. A stray cat barely surviving the winter streets; a teenager – one of Sonya’s former students – kicked out of his home with nowhere else to go. “This is how he makes his peace,” says Hanks. “Marisol is the same sort of agent of change that Sonya was – benevolent and good for Otto even though he's dragged kicking and screaming through it. Just when he thought he was done with this kind of nonsense – the one-damn-thing-after-another that the world is like – these people enter his life and he makes his peace with it.”\n\n“He starts out very bitter – he thinks people are idiots and he’s given up on life. And he goes from that throughout the film to finding new friends and connecting with people in his neighborhood,” says Nicastro. “He comes to a place where he realizes he can use his energy to help other people.”\n\n“Now he has a mangy cat who sleeps on his bed, but he has somebody he can talk to in the morning – something he didn’t realize he was missing – even if it is just a cat,” says Hanks. “He recognizes the goodness of life he's lucky enough to stumble upon it. He certainly did with Sonya.”\n\nThe story of the courtship of the young Otto with Sonya is told through flashbacks, with Rachel Keller playing Sonya and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s son, Truman Hanks, playing Otto.\n\nThe question of who would play the young Otto was a vexing one for Forster. “Marc said that one thing that always throws him out of a movie is when there are flashbacks to a character as a young person, and the younger actor never really looks or behaves enough like the older actor,” says Wilson. “He asked about Tom’s kids, and Colin and Chet are actors, but they’re too old for the role. Truman’s the one who looks the most like Tom at that age, but he’s not an actor. And Marc asked to meet him.”\n\n“Truman and I met in New York, and I felt like I was sitting across from Tom in the late 80s,” says Forster. “It was such a delight. He was so charming, and part of the charm is that he was very clear that he’s not an actor – but at the same time, he’s always been around cameras, so there’s no stage fright. He loves to be behind the camera – he intends to be a DP. We even did a little reading with Rachel and Truman – it was so natural and beautiful. It felt right, organic.”\n\n“It was a unique opportunity,” says Truman. “I mean, I’m in Local 600, the camera union, and Marc yanked me from the camera world and put me on the other side of it. When I was deciding whether to do it, I asked a few friends for advice, and they had a helpful way to think about it: doing the part would help inform my decisions and my camerawork. I would know what it was like to be on the other side of the camera. Because this is a very collaborative art form, it’s enlightening to have been an actor and see what it’s like firsthand.”\n\nBesides, if the neophyte actor needed any advice, who better to go to than his old man? “He would talk to me about different ways to stand and walk,” notes Truman. “Certain mannerisms, like this pointing thing that he was incorporating the character, so that we could create a continuity.”\n\nRachel Keller, in playing Sonya, says that working opposite Truman made for a delightful change of pace. “The scenes played out genuinely, authentic, as we lived out this gorgeous love story,” she says. “It was just being together.”\n\nPlaying Sonya was a chance for Keller to create the lively, magical presence that is missing from Otto’s life as an older man. “She’s so sure of herself, very confident,” says Keller. “He’s taken by that – he sees how bright and lovely she is, and he’s smitten.”\n\nFor the filmmakers, framing the flashbacks and the present-day sequences was one of the key creative challenges. “How do we play with the two worlds, the flashbacks of his past, his memories of the joy of his life with Sonya,” says production designer Barbara Ling, who recently won the Oscar® for her design of Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\n\nFor A Man Called Otto, Ling would have to design for two eras – the rust oranges and milky greens looks of the 70s and 80s in the scenes that flash back to a younger Otto, which become the lighter, more natural values of those same colors in the present day.\n\nTo have those two color palettes co-exist, Forster worked with Ling and the director of photography, Mathias Koenigswieser, to show memories coming alive through reflections and lighting. The idea is that any little thing can spark a memory for Otto. “Mathias worked with the idea of reflection and how things reflect back to each other,” says Ling, “so that you could be in one era, and with the reflections from glass or a mirror, you see the tones of another era. Mathias had a wonderful idea of how to keep those transitions happening, and how we could play off two schemes at the same time.\n\nFor a film that is so much about finding community with one’s neighbors, choosing a location for Otto’s home (and, naturally, Marisol and Tommy’s across the street), would be key. “We found a little gem in Pittsburgh,” says Ling. “The neighborhood is beautifully built in what they called mutual housing – houses or apartments all joined together, but feel completely separate. It’s very unique living environment and very visceral to the city.”\n\nFor Otto, it’s another reminder of how things are changing beyond his control, with a new row of townhouses being built. “It’s another thing that raises his anger. He feels it’s losing soul, ripping down the good and putting up something much less well-built, much less caring about the environment; it’s just building as many housing projects as you can,” notes Ling.\n\nFor the flashback scene in which Otto falls in love-at-first-sight with Sonya as she hurries for a train, the filmmakers sought out a train station that still carried its charm from decades past. “The train station is where they first meet – it was so important that it had a romance to it,” says Ling. “But it’s hard to get train stations anymore. Most of them have been changed into apartment complexes or venues.”\n\nThey found the station they were looking for a few hours from Pittsburgh, in Toledo, Ohio. “It was built in 1950, with high hopes of commerce that didn’t quite happen in that area. It looks as if it has never been touched since 1950. It takes your breath away, how beautiful it is. And luckily, Toledo was extremely generous and very happy to have us come film.”\n\nLocations are just the half of it – to film in period requires all kinds of set and costume dressing, including cars. For Ling, not only did the cars have to be Chevys (as if Otto would drive anything else), but they had to match the color palette of the rest of the film.\n\nThe limited options tended to be in the hands of very protective owners, but it turns out if you want to get your hands on a classic car, there are two magic words that work like a charm. “We’d say, ‘Can we rent your car?’, and they’d make a noise and say they were the only ones who could drive it. ‘Well, no, you can’t drive it, but don’t worry, Tom Hanks will be driving it.’ And is there any more trusted human being on Earth? ‘Oh, well that would be interesting. All right.’”\n\nComposing the score is 15-time Oscar® nominee Thomas Newman. A key element of Newman’s score is the original song “Til You’re Home,” which Forster asked his producer Rita Wilson to write and perform; Newman incorporates key elements of the melody into the film’s underscore.\n\nWilson was apprehensive at first, because as the film’s producer, she was reluctant to put Forster in a position where he felt he was forced to use the boss’s song. “I’ve been writing songs for the past ten years and have written songs for independent movies before, and Marc was familiar with my albums. I was humbled and grateful for the opportunity, but I also made him promise to be honest with me if he didn’t want to use it,” says Wilson. “As producer, my first allegiance is to the film and the director’s vision.”\n\nReflecting on how to express the themes of the film in a song, Wilson recalled a comforting comment from a friend. “When my dad died, a close friend said to me, ‘The conversation continues,’ and that has always stuck in my mind. I wanted to make a song that was evocative of that – a song that could be heard as a conversation two people may be having with each other, even if they’re not in the same room.”\n\nTo write the song, Wilson teamed with co-writer David Hodges. “David and I have always been like minded when it comes to what we want to say musically and lyrically,” says Wilson. “This is a movie about the depths of love and how love continues even after a person leaves this Earth. One idea that kept coming up was wanting to tell someone about your day while waiting for them to come home – home being a place of comfort and peace.”\n\nWilson performs the song as a duet with Sebastian Yarta. “I believed that Otto could be singing this song to his wife, but also she could be singing it to him,” says Wilson. “It was a way for them to be together through the song.”\n\nBecause the character of Marisol, along with her husband, Tommy, are so integral to the plot of the film and Otto’s character arc, Wilson saw a unique opportunity to reflect the characters in the song by asking Yarta – whose performance of ‘Dos Oruguitas’ in Encanto has enchanted her – to be her duet partner. “He said yes, but had only one day on his schedule that he could do it. Fortunately, that day was in Los Angeles. The planets aligned.”\n\nHodges sings an acoustic mix of the song heard in the film. “It’s always special to be a part of writing for a film, and especially one as beautiful as A Man Called Otto,” says Hodges. “When Rita and I started to collaborate for it, each word and melody of Til You’re Home seemed to be waiting for us, like little steps on a path to what the story needed. I’m so excited to finally share one of my favorite songs I’ve ever been a part of writing.”\n\nABOUT THE CAST\n\nTOM HANKS (Otto / Producer) is an award-winning actor, producer, and director.
