        "text": "Sylvan vs. Fortress: You choose!\n\nAh, welcome, welcome. You can call me… the Spy Master. I’m glad you could join this little… informal meeting. I was worried for a moment those whispering crystals would not work. You know Wizards and their creations -- so enamoured with the theory they never do proper field-testing…\n\nBut let’s get to the matter at hand. We’ll have opportunities later to bring you up to speed concerning the latest events. Suffice it to say that it’s been ten years since the assassination of the Holy Empress Maeve Falcon at the hand of infernal agents. Ten years during which the Holy Empire has been ripped apart by a gruesome war of succession, as every Duke went and unearthed old family ancestries to lay claim upon the vacant throne.\n\nAfter countless battles, sieges, alliances, betrayals and treaties, only two contestants now remain: Seamus of the Stag, and Ivan of the Griffin. I invited you to this meeting because you share our goal: to ensure the Griffin takes the throne.\n\nWhat you might not know is that Ivan is… plagued by doubt. Ten years of war have taken a toll on both his body and his soul. He’s ready to renounce the crown and remove his Griffin Duchy from the Empire.\n\nBut the stakes of this war are bigger than the borders of the Holy Empire. Allowing a man like Seamus on the imperial throne would be a disaster for all Ashan. Fortunately Ivan seems to realize this as well. He has gathered a council of his own, friends and allies from neighbouring nations, to collect their advice before he takes his decision.\n\nI know from a firsthand source that the Wizards of the Silver Cities and the Necromancers of Heresh will both have a representative at Ivan’s council, so sparks are to be expected. Ivan’s master-of-arms, a proud descendant of the Whitespear clan, will be representing the Orc tribes. More interesting is the fact an Angel will also be seated at Ivan’s table, which hints at the possibility the Church of Light itself is not fully behind Seamus.\n\nBut that’s not all. I also heard that Ivan is about to send invitations to other nations as well. My information suggests he currently hesitates between sending a messenger to the Elves of Irollan or to the Dwarves of Grimheim. Clever choices -- both nations have fought the Stag armies in recent history. But if my informant is to be believed, Ivan will only invite the Elves or the Dwarves, so I presume not to arouse Seamus’s suspicions.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us to influence Ivan’s choice. And this is why I have gathered you here today, brothers and sisters. Who shall Ivan ally with? The Elves, or the Dwarves?\n\nMake your voices heard!\n\nSYLVAN\n\nElves have mostly kept to themselves since the Day of the Tears of Fire. The forests of Irollan have become hostile to foreigners, a green maze you do not enter uninvited. But they have always kept a vigilant eye on the Holy Empire - their big, noisy, intrusive neighbour. The Dukes of Stag have long been nibbling on Irollan’s borders, and there have been skirmishes in the past. The Elf High-King, Alaron, might consider sending an ambassador to Ivan’s council, if only to ensure the Empire won’t be ruled by someone he can’t trust.\n\nFrom a military point of view, Elves would add adaptability to Ivan’s strategies. Elf warriors are designed for speed and striking power. They hate a stand-up fight and prefer guerilla tactics. Maneuverability is the key to Elf tactics - they are past masters of retreating to draw the enemy into an advantageous position for them. In a fight they concentrate on picking the enemy army apart. To an Elf general, the perfect battle is one in which the enemy never sees a single Elf…\n\nFORTRESS\n\nThe Dwarves are only just recovering from Hathor Orlandsson’s tyrannical rule, a reign that strained the relationship between Grimheim and the Stag Duchy after Hathor’s warbands raided several Stag towns. Despite the truce that followed Hathor’s death and the election of a new King under the Mountain, Seamus has made no mystery of his desire to get his revenge against Arkath’s people. While we can be sure the Dwarves would rather stay in their mountains and leave Humans to their own devices, backing Ivan might be their only chance to avoid a full-fledged war with the Holy Empire.\n\nDwarves would make reliable allies as Dwarf warriors, while ferocious, are possessed of an uncanny discipline. They fight to the death, even when the odds are hopelessly against them. Dwarves particularly excel at sieges, with their engineers and sappers working relentlessly to undermine any fortifications they face. Which would be definitely become an asset if Ivan must conquer the impregnable walls of Horncrest, the Stag’s capitol.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Shadow Council: an evolving website\n\nBy joining the Shadow Council, you should have discovered that some doors still are closed during your exploration.\n\nThose sections will allow you to discover the game and its universe and will be updated in the following months along with dedicated news.\n\nThis website is more than just a dev blog; it's the one comprehensive platform for Might & Magic® Heroes VII.\n\nOne of the first elements we will add is the possibility to customize your profile on your “my account” page.

But before we venture into the future, let’s go back to the beginning in order to introduce (or reintroduce) the Might & Magic® Franchise and the Might & Magic® Heroes series.\n\nWhat is Might & Magic®?\n\nCreated in 1986 by Jon Van Caneghem & New World Computing, Might & Magic® started as a first-person RPG with its very first episode, “Secret of the Inner Sanctum”. This original game quickly became one of the historical pillars of the genre. Generations of gamers explored the lands of Varn, Terra, Xeen and more amazing worlds (the latest of which is called Ashan and serves as the setting of all of Ubisoft’s Might & Magic® games) to live epic adventure with their teams of fearless raiders and adventurers. But soon, role-players weren’t the only ones to spend hours on Might & Magic® games anymore…\n\nThe depth of its fantasy setting & the consistency of its universe permitted, with complementary and exciting different gameplays, to offer unique experiences for all tastes. One of them particularly stood out in the heart of gamers: the Might and Magic® Heroes saga.\n\nMight and Magic® Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum (1986) - Heroes of Might and Magic®©: A Strategic Quest (1995)\n\nWhat is a Might & Magic® Heroes game?\n\nMight & Magic® Heroes is a turn based strategy game, combining resource and town management with exciting RPG elements, to offer a unique and addictive formula.\n\nDifferent factions are taking part to the battle through exciting campaigns or skirmish scenarios. Alone or with friends, you become the Hero!\n\nYou are a strategist, leading your armies to war in order to conquer uncharted lands or enemy territories.\n\nYou are an economist; you know the importance of gold and the necessity for resources to develop your empire.\n\nYou also are a tactician, giving orders to your units during turn based battles where brains can surpass brawn.\n\nLast but not least: you command Heroes. Heroes are your generals, leading your armies on the field, earning experience to develop their skills and spells, and wielding magical artefacts of immense power.\n\nWhat about Might & Magic® Heroes VII?\n\nMight & Magic® Heroes VII is all of this, and more!\n\n20 years after the original Might & Magic® Heroes game spellbound gamers across the globe, Might & Magic® Heroes VII not only pays tribute to the famous turn based strategy series, but also builds upon its best features while adding improvements and innovations.\n\nYou will soon discover more information about the seventh chapter of this saga and also be able to actively influence its development through this website, and especially its vote feature.\n\nOn the day of its release, Might & Magic® Heroes VII will offer 6 factions, 2 to be voted by the community. The first vote is already open, check it out!\n\nWhy are faction votes so important for the game?\n\nFactions are, in a few words, the armies you will be able to command, all of them having a distinct gameplay, setting and unique creatures. Choosing a faction truly is choosing the experience you want to have in Might & Magic® Heroes VII.\n\nStay tuned on this platform to learn more about each of them! It is your responsibility to complete the chairs of the greatest council of Ashan…\n\nMight & Magic® Heroes VII storyline\n\nMight & Magic® Heroes VII tells the story of young Duke Ivan striving to restore peace in a time of civil torment.\n\nFacing political decisions with dire consequences in his ascension to the Imperial throne, he gathers 6 councilors from 6 distinct factions to support his claim to rule. These advisors tell him glorious stories of legendary heroes from the world of Ashan’s past, so that he may choose the surest path to power and forge his own destiny.\n\n↧\n\nWelcome!\n\nHello everyone,\n\nWelcome to the Might & Magic® Heroes VII Website.\n\nWithin the next months, this will be the place where you can watch a great game grow.

I understand the choice is difficult, and I also realize many of you would like more information about these two proud nations before voicing their opinion. This is perfectly legitimate – I know all too well that information is everything.\n\nTo quench your thirst, I called upon the knowledge of another esteemed member of this shadow council, the necromancer Kaspar. This master apothecary and healer has been around for… quite some time, and nobody on Ashan knows as much as he does about its peoples, except maybe the Loremasters of the Blind Brothers.\n\n…Brother Kaspar, please come forward. We’re listening to you.\n\nWell well, I would never have expected this shadow council to grow so big, so fast. It is heartwarming, yes, heartwarming to see so many young people gathered today – even through whispering crystals for most of you – to discuss the future of Ashan.\n\nMy name is Kaspar. I was born a few centuries ago in the city of Kriegspire, in the Wolf Duchy. But the Maiden of Fate led me to the Seven Cities, eventually joining the ranks of the Spider Cult that was growing within the ranks of House Eterna. In time, I drank the venom of the Namtaru to prolong my life, and became a Lich.\n\nBut despite the fact I am what the plebs would call “Undead”, I remain, first and foremost, a healer, travelling wherever my skills are needed. I was in Irollan in 654 to help circumvent the outbreak of White Fever near Syris Wynna, and I journeyed to Grimheim in 701 to treat the Dwarf warriors poisoned by Dark Elf blades. Today, I will share my observations regarding these two remarkable peoples, the Elves and the Dwarves.\n\nOn the Elves\n\n1. Irollan, the Elf realm\n\nGraceful and patient souls who live in close harmony with the earth, the Elves are in tune with the Dragon of Earth. Her deliberate nature and ancient wisdom are reflected in their approach to life and worship. Distrustful of machinery and cities, they keep to their ancient ways and ally with others only rarely. It must be emphasized that Elven lands are not safe. Wild animals, the natural terrain, and the Elves themselves all pose formidable hazards for the incautious traveller…\n\n…I took quite a lot of notes about the flora and fauna found in Irollan, but I guess that should be a topic for another time. Let’s focus on the Elves themselves, shall we? Oh wait, that part could be relevant to the matter at hand:\n\n…The woodlands are rich in natural resources, so much so that the Elves rarely have to trade with outsiders unless they wish it. Other natural resources are plentiful as well. The rivers and lakes teem with fish, the woodlands abound with wild game, and herbs and fruiting plants grow wild in abundance. The Elves have learned to tend these crops in their own way, so that an outsider stumbling upon an Elven farm would scarcely recognize the difference from the surrounding woods.\n\nElven cities are more in the air than on the ground. The Elves long ago mastered the art of convincing trees to grow to their desires, and as such they have created great canopies above the forest floor upon which they build their cities. Ladders, rope bridges, and other such devices connect the various levels of these treeborne cities. Kings and nobles dwell on the higher levels, while the common folk live closer to the ground. Elven cities do have a ground component, primarily forges and the like, but the Elves rely on the trees to guard their cities better than any wall ever could…\n\nMore descriptions of trees and Elf houses follow... Ah! This is more like it:\n\n…There are four major cities within the Elven realm, each serving as a seasonal capital for the King and his court. The capital changes at the solstices and equinoxes, and each city subtly tries to outdo the others. Syris Thalla (“New Green”) is the spring capital, located in the west. Syris Vaniel (“Golden Sun”) is the southern and summer capital. Syris Lothran (“Bloodleaf”) is the fall capital, and is located in the east, close to the Haven border. Syris Wynna (“White Wind”) is the northern capital, and it rules in winter. The changing of the capital is a major event in the Elven calendar, and the procession of the royal court from city to city is a magnificent sight to behold.\n\nI have been lucky indeed, as an outsider, to witness the journey from Syris Wynna to Syris Thalla, at the end of my stay in Irollan.\n\n2. The court of the High-King\n\n…There is a King of the Elves, and there are many other Kings below him. The High-King rules from the central court, and once he is chosen his word is law. The process of choosing a King falls to the druids, who fast and endure the sweat lodge until all are given a vision of who the new ruler should be. The decision has to be unanimous, and the druids will stay in the sweat lodge without eating for as long as it takes.\n\nThe High King rules for life, which for Elves, is a very long time indeed. Around him circulates a court of soothsayers, druids, warriors, musicians, ladies in waiting, poets, jesters, sons of lesser Kings and the like, a whirlwind of chaos that somehow manages to be surprisingly efficient, especially compared to the Imperial court. Intrigues within the Elven court are less deadly than they are elegant - Elves do not like to kill other Elves. Rather, they will work to humiliate, exile and otherwise bring low their rivals. Enmities can last hundreds of years, for Elves do not forget slights, and they guard their honour fiercely.\n\nThere are those who say that the Elves’ entire language, known as Monlin, the Song of the Earth, is music. That may be the case, but the Elves themselves claim to be partial to poetry. The more extemporaneously it’s composed, the better, and the Elf who can rip off a sestina on the fly wins a great deal of renown from his fellows. All Elves have two names, the one they use with outsiders and the one they use among themselves. The outsider name is generally descriptive and in the common tongue. The true name is in Elven, and is more or less unpronounceable by anyone except an Elf…\n\nBut I suppose you’re not so much interested in poetry and Elven ballads, so let’s skip a few pages and go straight to what I noted about the Elven military.\n\n3. Wardens of the Forest\n\n…Elven armies are composed of a fluid array of smaller units, all of which seem to instinctively know what the army as a whole needs to do. The swiftest runners and best archers are scouts and skirmishers, reporting back to the nobles who command each unit. Usually Elves will screen their main force with a line of skirmishers who will serve to draw opponents into traps, where they can be pounded with arrows from three sides.\n\nThe main body of the army is more heavily armed and armoured. Elven cavalry is mostly light cavalry, again designed for speed and manoeuvrability over shocking power. Riders will fire arrows or throw spears from horseback, eschewing heavier weapons like lances.\n\nThe Elves also have a sizeable navy. Their riverboats are fast and light, with tall rigging to allow room for plenty of archers. These ships also have narrow construction, to make them more difficult to board and to use enemies’ numbers against them. On the ocean, the pattern is repeated. Few Elves like sailing beyond sight of land, but those who do range far and wide as both traders and pirates. Not even mentioning the Sea Elves, of course…\n\nWell, I guess that’s all I can say about the Elves at the moment. Come back tomorrow, so I can tell you all I know about the Dwarves…\n\n↧\n\nDiscover Fortress\n\nSo where were we? Oh yes – yesterday I told you about the Elves of Irollan, but the time has come for me to share my experiences in Grimheim, among the Dwarf people.\n\nOn the Dwarves\n\n1. The Northern Fortresses\n\nThe capital city of the Dwarves is Tor Myrdal, built beneath two huge mountains (extinct volcanoes so tall that only the legendary Dwarven kings have climbed to their summits) and the mile-long knife-edged ridge that connects them. It is so massive and complex that no one, not even the Dwarves, knows all of its passages and tunnels. Indeed, some Dwarves have a superstitious fear that someone else – not Dwarves – has been surreptitiously adding to and modifying the tunnels for centuries, for some nefarious purpose that is as yet unknown.\n\nOther major Dwarven cities include Tor Vettfang, Tor Eldrheim, Tor Hlifa, and Tor Lindhath. The largest and most populous trading post is Tor Hallr, known to non-Dwarves as Beardsgate and to the Dwarves, colloquially, as “Talltown”…\n\nBy the way, allow me to dispel right away a story you might have heard: Dwarf women are neither bearded – they are actually rather attractive by Human standards – nor rare. But since the Dwarven lines place great stock in heredity and lineage, they guard their women fiercely and only in the most dire emergencies will women join the fray. That said, she-Dwarves are taught to fight and forge and have the same status and opportunities as any male.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of legends surrounding the Dwarves, it is worth noting that contrary to the popular belief found in the Holy Empire, Dwarves are not obsessed by gold, a metal they use to trade with the other peoples of Ashan but deem too fragile to be useful. Magical Flamegold, on the other hand, is highly prized by Dwarves as they consider it a gift from their God, Arkath.\n\n2. Trade and economy\n\nSpeaking of resources, here’s what I noted on this particular topic…\n\n…The Dwarven economy runs on mining and metalworking. The seemingly endless veins of precious metal and useful iron fuel the economy, while thick beds of coal fuel the forges. Gems are also common under the mountains. Then there are the underground rivers with their sand banks that have allowed the Dwarves to establish a thriving side business in glassworking and pottery. Basically, if it is made with fire, the Dwarves can shape it to their will…\n\nIndeed, most citizens of the Holy Empire don’t know it, but the spectacular stained glass found in the great Cathedrals of Elrath were actually made by Dwarves, artisans from Tor-Lindhath to be precise.\n\n…Dwarven trading outposts are located on the borders of Dwarven territory. Only a few trusted trading partners can actually bring their caravans over the borders and into the heart of the Dwarven kingdom. The rest do business on the fringes, though some extensive towns have grown up around these outposts.\n\nEach Dwarven city has its own king, with a council of advisors from the wealthiest and most industrious families. The King Under the Mountains is the king of kings among the Dwarves, and it is he who sets policy and summons them to war. Kingship is not hereditary, though it is a lifetime post. After each king’s death, the council convenes and elects his successor. At such times, the tunnels are filled with both celebration and intrigue, as various candidates court voters and attempt to discredit – or eliminate – rivals.\n\nSocial structure is based around three relationships: family, fostering and fighting. There is a complicated web of apprenticeships that serves to train up young Dwarves and cement relations between clans. These ties are precious – a single unworthy apprentice can poison an alliance that has existed for centuries.\n\nClans and families are not the same thing. Families are different lineages within a single clan, with each clan having its own name, battle history, customs and so forth. Ultimately, Dwarves always fall back on their clans. While a single city may house families from a half-dozen different clans, at important times, such as the election of a new king, Dwarves fall out along clan lines before anything else.\n\nThe main clans are Deepflame, Grimsteel, Winterwind, Stronghammer, Stonefist and Hearthguard. The might be other clans but I didn’t have the privilege to meet their members.\n\n3. Religion and beliefs\n\nAs the Dragon of Fire is their liege, Dwarves are huge fans of flames, lava, fires, and forges. The Priesthood is obligatory for those who have the gold-flecked eyes mentioned in the text; there is no questioning of this calling due to the immediacy of the Dragon in their daily lives. Neither the parents nor the children question the removal of such a child to the great seminaries. While studying at the seminary the acolytes learn Dragon lore, Dragon magic, medicine, military theory, and charitable acts. They are the closest things the Dwarves have to an impartial power, and are occasionally called upon to settle clan conflicts before they can destabilize the nation.\n\nReligious observance is seen in prayers in the morning and evening as well as before meals. Forges, shrines, and hearths will have a small object to the left of the doorway – the side of the heart – that symbolizes the presence of the Dragon. Dwarves will ritually touch these upon entering and leaving these places.\n\nIn design, Dwarven architecture tends toward circles and runes as motifs. They’re not fond of representational art, preferring instead geometric patterns. Buildings, roads, and stairs are built to be sturdy rather than decorative, and only central meeting halls and the like are decorated with ornate stonework. The Dwarves are also skilled glassworkers, and are renowned all over Ashan for their mastery of the art of stained glass, which they usually use to decorate the inside of their houses, especially around their hearths. These great glass frescoes usually describe the heroic adventures of their ancestors. With the fire burning at the centre of the house, it’s like the whole history of the family comes alive on the walls…\n\nWell I could go on and on but I suppose that’s enough regarding Dwarven economy, society, religion and architecture. Let’s talk about their armies.\n\n4. The Dwarven warbands\n\nThe Dwarven warbands are one of the most feared fighting forces in the world. Featuring unparalleled ferocity and iron discipline, they can be mustered on a moment’s notice. In combat, warbands from various cities try to outdo each other in terms of enemies killed, banners taken and the like – war is a game, and this is a way of keeping score. On the other hand, Dwarves never, ever surrender. They fight to the death, even when the odds are hopelessly against them. The best death a Dwarf can hope for is one in battle, against impossible odds, with a witness who will someday make a song of their deeds.\n\nMost Dwarves go into battle armed with a kite shield, a heavy single-bladed axe, and a brace of daggers. They also have other weapons hidden about their person, just in case. A Dwarf is never unprepared in battle – even if it’s just with a boot dagger, a Dwarf would sooner be naked than unarmed. Crossbows and siege engines are Dwarven specialties, and are vastly preferred to less complicated devices like bows, slings and the like. Dwarven ballista crews are deadly accurate, and can reload and fire fast enough to break up almost any enemy advance.\n\nBeing worshippers of Arkath, the Dragon of Fire, Dwarves and fire are old friends, and their communion is an intensely personal ritual that most outsiders have never seen. Apart from the deadly fire spells, their magic is mainly used to instil strength in warriors, forge objects and help during sieges.\n\nRunic inscriptions are omnipresent in Dwarf society and many Dwarves have runic tattoos on their skin. Each rune corresponds to a spell, an open door for communication between the physical world and the spiritual world. Runes allow the physical properties of an object to be channelled to the Rune bearer.\n\nIn other words, don’t get punched in the face by a Dwarf bearing a Stone Rune, for even my healing skills wouldn’t be able to fix your nose!\n\n↧\n\nDiscover Might & Magic\n\nHello Heroes,\n\nNext year we will celebrate with the launch of Heroes VII, the 20 years of the Heroes saga!\n\nReleased in 1995, Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest, made a real impression to all turn based strategy lovers and quickly became a pillar of the genre.\n\nFurthermore, since 1986 the Might & Magic franchise offered great memories to generations of players’ through complementary and unique experiences.\n\nIt is our duty to honor those precious moments and take the time to look back before moving to the next step with Heroes VII.\n\nClick here to discover right now the timeline of all main M&M games since 1986.

Thank you very much for all your comments and support messages, we are taking notes of all feedbacks and are following with attention discussions on community forums as well :)\n\nWELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ASHAN!\n\nAshan is a High Fantasy world where Dragons are primordial gods and the embodiment of magic, where warring factions fight for dominance through the powers of Might and Magic.\n\nTHE COSMIC EGG AND THE PRIMORDIAL TWINS\n\nIn the beginning there was Magic and the Void. Magic formed itself into the Cosmic Egg. Inside the Egg the Dragon twins Asha and Urgash, Sister and Brother, Order and Chaos, were nurtured with Primordial Magic until they hatched. Spawned from Magic to exist amidst the Void, the Primordial Dragons were the first with the potential to harness its unlimited power. While the brother Urgash basked in Magic’s infinite possibilities, dreaming of its potential for unlimited freedom, the sister Asha decided to give it shape and purpose.\n\nThe Cosmic Egg\n\nTHE COLOURS OF MAGIC\n\nAsha defined and named six “colours” of Magic that she had identified floating amongst the cosmic Void. They were Darkness, Light, Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. These were the threads with which she would weave the universe.\n\nTHE ELEMENTALS DRAGONS\n\nAsha gave birth to six Dragon Children, manifestations of the colours of Magic, to both guide and rule her creation. Malassa daughter of Darkness,Elrath son of Light, Sylanna daughter of Earth, Arkath son of Fire, Shalassa daughter of Water and Ylath son of Air.\n\nAsha, The Dragon of Order\n\nASHAN\n\nTogether with her children, Asha created Ashan, a world formed amidst the Darkness, bathed by the Light of the sun, an orb of Earth warmed by a heart of Fire, cooled by veins and arteries of Water, breathed to life by currents of Air.\n\nTheir work complete, the Dragons paused to gaze at their creation, and Asha was pleased.\n\nTHE ELDER RACES\n\nAsha now decided to create servants for her Dragon children. These Elder races were also emanations of the colours of Magic: the Faceless of Darkness, the Angels of Light, the Elves of Earth, the Dwarves of Fire, the Nagas of Water, and the Humans of Air. To give them sentience and grant them the ability to use Magic, Asha baptized them in the blood of their respective patron Dragon, so that it would mix with their own and flow in their veins.\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF CHAOS\n\nUrgash looked upon the Elemental Dragons, and the world that Asha had made, and he was filled with envy and disgust. What his sister had created, he would destroy, what she had organized, he would unravel and corrupt. In mockery of the Elder races, Urgash spawned the Demons, a race of alien creatures who live in a constant state of change, yielding to every urge they felt no matter how base. To impose some semblance of authority over his unruly, vicious offspring, Urgash created six Demon Overlords, twisted counterparts to the Elemental Dragons. Each Overlord was given dominion over a different aspect of Urgash’s unbridled passions.\n\nUrgash, The Dragon of Chaos\n\nGenesis & Hisory\n\nIf you are interested in knowing more about the genesis & history of Ashan, check out this complete timeline covering from the Ancient Age to the Sixth Eclispe on M&M Portal.\n\n↧\n\nSylvan vs. Fortress: Stand Proud!\n\nHello Councilors,\n\nIt has been already one week since the beginning of the faction vote.

I’m beginning to understand that many outside of the Holy Empire didn’t quite understand what was going on within our borders. As much pain as it causes me to recall the tragic events of this last decade, it is necessary if we are to bring an end to the bloodshed. This might take some time though. A lot happens in ten years, especially ten years of war.\n\nBut is the story I will tell you the truth? It would be presumptuous of me to say. I can only tell things as I saw them – my truth. Ask one of Seamus of Stag’s advisors and he might spin a widely different tale.\n\nTales of the Ten Years War\n\n843 YSD – Falcon’s Last Flight\n\nIf Empress Maeve Falcon committed a sin, it is certainly the sin of pride. It is often when you think you have everything under control that it all falls apart. The dangers of unreasonable pride will be a recurring theme in this story. So much that in centuries to come, historians may well call this war, “the War of Pride”.\n\nWhere to begin? Maybe with the prophecy.\n\nAt the dawn of our era, what the scholars call the “Historical Age”, Ronan the Great, High King of the Falcon Clan, defeated his rivals and had them bend the knee before him. The Human clans were no more. An Empire was born.\n\nIt is said that on the day of Ronan’s crowning, the Seventh Dragon himself, Sar-Elam, appeared to the new Emperor and talked with a voice that was both ancient and timeless. “Emperor of the Falcon!” he said. “Your blood is the blood of Men. For as long as your blood endures, the children of Ylath shall prosper.”\n\n…Well, he probably didn’t say these exact words, but all accounts at least agree to their meaning: as long as the Falcon dynasty existed, the children of Ylath – the Human race – would prosper.\n\nBut of course, Sar-Elam’s words also turned the Falcon line into targets. The Demons of Sheogh, in particular, made several attempts against the Falcon Emperors through history.\n\nHateful Plans\n\nIn 564 YSD, the Second Eclipse reddened the skies of Ashan, two years earlier than the Blind Brothers had predicted. The Demon Prince of Hate, Ahribban, who had been hatching plans to spread dissent and enmity within the Empire for years, personally led the siege of the Empire’s capital city, Falcon’s Reach. Emperor Liam Falcon died in battle, while Demon cultists led by the traitor Jezebeth hunted down his heirs.\n\nFortunately, the Duke of Griffin, Anton, managed to kill Jezebeth and rescue Liam’s only remaining family: his niece Gwendolyn. The princess safe, the imperial armies joined forces to liberate Falcon’s Reach and destroy Ahribban.\n\nAnd so the infernal plans were thwarted, and the blood of Ronan kept flowing.\n\nWhen the time of the Fourth Eclipse arrived, Empress Maeve was ready. The Blind Brothers had perfected their art, and this time their predictions were completely accurate. The Eclipse happened the very moment it was expected, and when the Demons unfurled upon the lands of the Holy Empire, the Knights of the Light were there to welcome them with blessed steel in hand.\n\nEverything was under control.\n\nBut Empress Maeve was underestimating the current ruler of Sheogh, the one they call the Demon Sovereign. While the Demons were being routed on the battlefields, a party of assassins infiltrated the walls of Falcon’s Reach. At their head was none other than Jezebeth, who had been offered – or cursed with, depending on the way you look at it – a second life in Sheogh as a Succubus.\n\nJezebeth was hell-bent on finishing what she had failed to do four centuries earlier. Jezebeth and her Demons stormed Maeve’s throne room, killing the Empress and slaughtering her entire family. Then, they burnt Falcon’s Reach to the ground, to ensure no heir of Falcon would survive.\n\nThe Fourth Eclipse ended with the Demons’ defeat… and their greatest victory.\n\nBlood for blood\n\nYet the world of Men didn’t seem in a hurry to end. And for scholars, that could mean only two things.\n\nThe skeptics reasoned that Sar-Elam’s prophecy could have been wrong all along, or at least misinterpreted. That happens all the time, really – just as you should never trust someone claiming to possess the one and only truth, you should never believe someone who claims his interpretation of a prophecy is the right one.\n\nThe faithful, on the other hand, claimed that Maeve’s son Brendan had somehow survived the massacre of Falcon’s Reach. As unlikely as it sounded, many in the Empire wanted to believe it. The Church of Light proclaimed there would be one year of mourning: if the child Brendan was found alive during this period, he would inherit the throne. If he was not found, then he would be declared dead, and a new Emperor would be chosen among the Dukes of the Empire.\n\nThat time was spent hunting the last pockets of Demon marauders. Among them was Jezebeth herself. It was Ivan of Griffin, leading a company of griffin riders, who located and cornered her. The Succubus had been trying to hide in plain sight, in the ruins of Castelrose, the old citadel of the Holy Inquisition.\n\nIt was no secret that Ivan had been good friends with Empress Maeve, and he showed her assassin no mercy. You probably know the folk song their encounter inspired? I think it goes like this:\n\n“She tried to cast her nasty spells\n\nSo he chopped off her hand\n\nShe tried to fly back to hell\n\nSo he chopped off her wings\n\nShe begged for her life\n\nSo he took out his sword\n\nShe promised to be his wife\n\nAnd he made his blade sing\n\nHe chopped off her head\n\nuntil he figured she was dead…”\n\nThe lyrical qualities of this piece are certainly debatable, but that’s not the point. What is important is what the song doesn’t mention: the fact Jezebeth had one last bargaining chip to offer in the hopes of saving her sorry hide. In a last, desperate gambit, she offered information about the boy Brendan. But Ivan replied that he would never believe one word spoken by an assassin, especially a Succubus. And that’s when he cut her head off with a mighty swing of his sword.\n\nWith Jezebeth’s death, the Fourth Eclipse was finally over. But in the Empire the troubles were only beginning…\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nInterview with Rob King and Paul Romero\n\nSince we announced Might & Magic Heroes VII, one of the most asked question has been: will the music be done by Rob King and Paul Anthony Romero? We are very happy to answer that today with a big YES :)\n\nTo celebrate the duo's return, we have asked them some questions about the past, the present, and the future!\n\n1. 2015 will mark the 20th anniversary of the Heroes series. Can you tell us how you became involved with Might & Magic?\n\nRob King: I started working at New World Computing back in Feb. 1994 and was originally hired as “The Sound Guy” which then became the Audio Director. The idea of Heroes was spawned from an earlier title called King's Bounty that Jon Van Caneghem created back in his parent’s garage I believe. It was one of the first projects I worked on ay NWC. When I first saw the concept art I was quickly inspired to want to do a Baroque influenced Classical score. At this point my musical background was mostly writing Pop/Rock/Electronic music and I knew I needed a true classical guy to pull this off. About 6 months prior to getting my job at NWC I went to a party with a friend that just so happened to be at Paul Romero’s house. Paul was already kind of known to throw these great parties with good food, drinks and talented musicians getting together to perform various repertoires of music. I met Paul in his kitchen over a glass of wine an instantly loved the guy as we discussed music and recording. Flash forward to when we started the concept of Heroes 1, I always had Paul in the back of my mind from our first encounter and decided to give him a call. I told him my idea for the game and he was pretty thrilled with the idea and was up for the challenge of doing a score for a video game.\n\nPaul Romero: Rob asked if I could make some tunes in a baroque feel that sounded like Vivaldi, Bach, or Handel.. Since I grew up learning the music of Bach, Scarlatti and Handel I felt like knew how the harmonic and melodic content was structured for that particular time period. And so I told Rob the types of instruments and orchestrations needed for that kind of baroque-era feeling and he put together a full arsenal of sounds for me. Hence, this is how be began our partnership 20 years ago. We had one week to create the score for this first Heroes game”. It was a fun fun time for me because I had never played a computer game and I had never created soundtrack music. I had only classical composed concerti, choral works, piano works, and chamber music for concert work. This was a whole new world for me: creating music to help make a fantasy world in a strategic computer game.\n\nPaul Romero at work...\n\nRob King: As a side note, back in the early 90’s is when games really started having thematic scores. Games like Lands of Lore, Myst, King's Quest and others. Most of the music was still done as General MIDI using sound chips on a Soundblaster or Turtle beach card. I really wanted a full sounding score so we opted for streaming the music from the CD player as you played. For Heroes II we used mp3 technology for disk streaming to avoid taxing the CD player after I had met Karlheinz Brandenburg from the Fraunhofer Institue at the AES show in 1995-96 up in San Francisco and I am pretty sure it was the first game to ever use it! :) Not to many people really know that bit of tech history. Boy did that technology go a long way!\n\nWe started writing the score in the bedroom of my apartment back in South Pasadena, Ca. It was also completed there using a very limited amount of gear! I think I had a couple Roland JV Modules and a couple AKAI S-1100’s. Everything was programmed and mixed live straight to DAT. So happy about where technology is today! That pretty much was the beginning of our working relationship and friendship. Today I consider him my brother. A chance meeting that spawned a best friend 20 years later.\n\n2. Even if it has retained the distinctive “King & Romero” touch that fans know and love, your music has evolved quite a bit during these 20 years. How would you describe this evolution?\n\nRob King: Obviously technology has played a big part in it and I’m a big tech nerd for sure. I purchased my first computer & sampler at age 17, the Roland S10 which had a whopping 256k of RAM and used these little 2,8 “Quick-Disks” that held 32k on each side and an Atari 1040ST running Master Tracks! 20 years later we use 3 computers that can stream the 400+ track Orchestral Template I have set up effortlessly with samples recorded in the finest rooms from around the world. It’s pretty crazy to think about it. On Heroes II we recorded all the live musicians on ADAT’s. Now we have unlimited tracks which really helps on the details of the music when you do it yourself.\n\nPaul Romero: Rob always proposes that we try a new sonic and musical path for each new project. Rob is never about doing the same thing over and over. He wants to push our musical language and expression with each new opportunity. Hence, we go from basic baroque to full-on post-romanticism in the Heroes game series. Diversity that ranges from Aztec to Vietnamese, Armenian to Persian, Chinese to Appalachian cultures… We always try and push the envelope within our standard sound.\n\nRob King: Yes, we have always tried to do things a little different on every one of the Heroes scores over the years, usually integrating more world instruments and vocalists. Heroes II was also the first game to ever have Opera in it! I can’t think of many games to this day that have that :) I know I had to fight for that idea as everyone thought I was a little crazy for wanting to do that in a “Video Game”. Luckily I got my way and it turned out to be sort of a staple over the years throughout the various scores. Some of the best Opera yet is in the new Heroes VII score. Paul brought in Karin Mushegain at age 16 or 17 on Heroes II and she returns on Heroes VII. She is better than ever 18 years later. Her voice has become magnificent and it is fun to hear her progression over the years. To change things up a bit I am even singing on 2 of the songs on the Heroes VII soundtrack. I have been a singer from age 14 and finally decided to do something on one of our scores. I hope I didn’t blow it :)\n\nKarin Mushegain sings opera once again for Heroes VII.\n\n3. What gave you the idea to add opera to the music in the first place?\n\nPaul Romero: Rob went with me to see La Bohème at the Los Angeles Opera and had a brainstorm: how would it be to incorporate operatic voices in a soundtrack? How could I say no to this proposal. I had been composing classical operatic music since I was a teenager and to now have an opportunity to write operatic-ish music for a computer game was a fantastic opportunity. I wanted to see if it was possible to make opera-sounding music listenable to a game-player. I was teaching piano lessons to the movie producer Howard Kazanjian’s (Star Wars) sons at the time. They had a young cousin names Karin Mushegain who was studying opera. And so I met her and asked if she would be willing to record some operatic-ish music for Heroes II. She was only 15 at the time and she and I and Rob had a great time working together. It was a first for all of us. My buddy Grant Youngblood, who is one of America’s best baritones, was in Los Angeles during an operatic tour and I asked if he could also join us to try and make some operatic music for Heroes II. So we all got together at Rob’s studio and tried to make some music that sounded as if it were from a nineteenth-century opera. I pulled out lyrics from the Roman Catholic requiem in both Latin and German.\n\nRob King: The idea for Heroes II pretty much came from that night after seeing La Bohème. I also knew Opera was never done in a video game before and that also had appeal to me. Opera is not for everyone and I totally acknowledged that when I was contemplating the idea of it. Paul was easy, he basically said ”Yeah, let’s do it” without blinking an eye. The New World Computing Dev team on the other hand had very mixed feelings :) I remember going into Jon’s office and he looked me straight in the face and said “uh, no”. Mark Caldwell who was the VP was also against it but was a little more receptive of trying the idea out. Jon just wasn’t a fan of Opera. After weeks of pleading with him and a lot of jokes in between he was up for the idea with one contingency. That we have mixes of the music without the vocal as an option for the user to switch between. One of the artists at NWC came up with a cute little icon/button of an Opera singer with her mouth open and closed in the sound option menu of the game and then this allowed the user to turn off the vocal in the track. We had both versions streaming so you could switch between the two. I remember being pretty nervous when that game released but it all worked out and the majority of the game fans really enjoyed it.\n\n4. As composers, how did you approach the Heroes VII project? What was similar to past Heroes, and what was different?\n\nPaul Romero: The approach was different because we wanted each piece to have it’s own sonic and musical style. Each theme was a world-unto-itself from a harmonic and melodic structural point of view. They range from neo-baroque to post-romanticism.\n\nRob King: We kinda approach it the same way as we did on Heroes 1. Paul and I get together and discuss the overall “vibe” of what we would like do and set it in motion. I first build the Orchestral Sound Template I want to use for the score and that usually takes a couple weeks to fine tune and Paul starts working from home on his Steinway around the same time. We knew we wanted Opera again as well as other vocal numbers. We decided early on that the language we wanted to use this time around was Greek and Armenian. We choose the language on every game and try to stay the course on beautiful emotional melodies and god knows we could do without any more damn Evil Latin Choir Chants in these so called “Epic” scores these days. Blah… :) Heroes II was German and Latin, Heroes IV was all Latin, Heroes V started in English then we redid it in Latin and a few made up words :) Heroes V had all original lyrics and the previous games we used passages from the Bible, lot’s of good story telling there huh? We did a game called RIFT a few year back and that game had Persian and Ancient Aztec languages in the score. Maybe something from Eastern Europe next time around? Perhaps something as obscure as Mongolian? It has to be slightly unusual these days for me to get excited. Ha! Again, technology and the advancement in Sound Design and samples also played a role in the evolution of our sound.\n\n5. As you mentioned before, Heroes VII marks the return of opera singer Karin Mushegain. How was it to work with Karin again?\n\nRob King: Karin is so easy to work with. We have all been friends for so long now and know each other so well it just flows effortlessly. We are also consistently joking around in the studio and all love hanging out together. No Autotune there folks! The girl has some seriously skills now. I also used my 1955 AKG C12 mic this time around on her vocal and the recording just sounds stunning. No doubt her best performance on a Heroes score to date.\n\nPaul Romero: Karin Mushegain has a voice that is reaching a zenith of power and control and beauty. I don’t think there is another mezzo-soprano in the world that could have sung more beautifully on these tracks. It was a pure pleasure and a fortunate moment to be able and work with her once again. To be able and capture her voice at this stage of her career is a fantastic and magnificent opportunity. Plus she is a wonderfully funny and charming woman on a personal level. So it’s a win-win-win situation for everyone.\n\n6. We often receive fan e-mails asking for transcriptions of the lyrics of the opera parts :) How do you write these lyrics?\n\nRob King: Basically start with what we want to say, then find the right phrases to suit the melodic flow. Heroes VII was about eternal Heroism and the old “Good vs. Evil”. Coming up with phrases relating to “Good vs. Evil” , like one liners and random other phrases, then translating them into the language. From there, whatever phrases best fit the melody and flow of the song get used.\n\nPaul Romero: We always try and express ourselves through different means. Which means not only expanding our musical and harmonic and technological language, but also our actual language of choice. Rob and I have used German, Latin, Nahuatl (Aztec), French, Farsi, in the past. I thought that Greek would be nice because the idea of the Hero is so closely linked to Greek mythology. So why not use the Greek language to express heroic thoughts? Plus I wanted to use a bit of Armenian as a tribute to Karin Mushegain’s ancestral past.\n\n7. Could you describe the process of composing a specific track: Hope for Green Falls (used in the game as the Haven faction theme)? From the first melodies to the final, mixed track.\n\nRob King: Everything usually starts with a mood. This particular track I knew I wanted the mid section to have all the ethnic flutes playing under Karin’s vocal. So the sound palette started pretty early. I also like to listen to a lot of different musical scores to gain inspiration and mood. There is one song on the Heroes VII score called Requiem For a King. I remember listening to the Seven Years in Tibet Score by John Williams and Yo Yo Ma. I just loved the sound of that record and the music is brilliant. I wanted to capture that sound from that score on this tune especially the cello solo. Our good friend Fang Fang Xu played the beautiful cello on this particular song and it is one of my favorites on the score.\n\nFang Fang Xu plays the cello on Heroes VII's soundtrack.\n\nPaul Romero: I was listening to Richard Strauss’ Four Last Songs for Soprano and Orchestra. That particular score tells the story of the last seasons of ones life with lyrics from Herman Hesse. That gave me an inspiration for this particular track. I started writing on the piano at home and then brought it into the studio for Rob and myself to program. We started with the Strings and Harp and built the orchestration around those performances.\n\nThe opening woodwinds are ethnically ambiguous so that you can feel “far away”, emotionally… Karin’s voice comes in to sooth you and gives you hope. The orchestra sweeps away and takes you to new heights of hopes of heroism.\n\nRob King: Once we had the tracked done in Cubase and Paul finished playing the last note of MIDI data I then go through every track individually and program keyswitch, breath and velocity data for all the instruments one by one making them sound as natural and organic as possible. After that tedious task is done, each individual instrument is tracked through my API sidecar into Protools. I just love what it does to the digital files. Once I have the arrangement all tracked in Protools I then go through and time adjust every .wav file so that the timing is spot on and sample accurate getting rid of any MIDI latency issues. BTW, we don’t quantize anything on these recordings. Every part is played by either Paul or myself and than edited for human timing. It takes a great amount of time but I feel it really makes everything sound incredibly organic. Then a few live elements were tracked and put in the mix.\n\nAfter the music is all finished we then had Karin come in and lay down the vocals I think the final take was take 2 on this particular piece. Once the song was complete I then started mixing. I use a combination on Software plugins and analog outboard gear. The Vocal had a Retro 176 Comp for a bit of Mojo and to tame some of the peaks in Karin’s range. The reverbs used on the song for various ambiences are from my Bricasti M7 hardware reverbs. On the master Insert bus of Protools I have a Manley Backbone mastering console plugged in. The chain used on the master bus for the whole score was usually Burl DA converter – Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor – Amtec PEQ-10 (Pultec type) tube EQ’s – Maslec MPL2 peak and M/S High frequency limiter – GML 8200 Stereo EQ – Burl AD Converter. Everything is just doing a little bit of something to put a bit of glue on the mix.\n\nRob King's studio - where the magic happens.\n\n8. Looking back on those 20 years of Heroes, which track are you the most proud of?\n\nRob King: I love the harpsichord piece from Heroes 1, Grass Theme in Heroes IV, Sylvan Theme in Heroes V, Most of the Tribes of the East expansion music came out pretty cool and on this new soundtrack I love most of it! (Maybe because it’s new?) :) My favorites being Hope for Green Falls, Requiem For a King, The Elven Coronation & The Wizard’s Waltz. Honestly we have done so much music on this series it is just crazy. Probably somewhere in the 6-8 hour range between all the titles and expansions over the past 2 decades. I can’t even remember most of it, LOL.\n\nPaul Romero: I am most proud of Heroes VII because each tune is fully expressed to my musical satisfaction. If I never have an opportunity to compose another soundtrack, I would be happy that this would be my last. It is everything I want to say musically at this time in my life.\n\n9. Paul, I think you’ll soon be in Poland for a music festival, with a special treat for Heroes fans… Can you tell us more?\n\nPaul Romero: I have a friend who is arranging a full Might & Magic Heroes concert with orchestra, chorus and operatic soloists.. I am composing a Might & Magic Heroes piano concerto so that I can be the soloist with the orchestra and play a lot of the Heroes melodies in a piano-concerto format. The concert organizers will announce a date as soon as everything is in place! I hope that Heroes fans from across Europe can come to this event and hear their favorite tunes in a format that is different than what they hear on the game scores.\n\nRob King: Not much to add here but I did spend 2 weeks canoeing in the Northern part of Poland and spent a bit of time in the lovely city of Gdansk. Would love to go back there again some time.\n\n10. Finally, do you have a message for Heroes fans?\n\nPaul Romero: I really love and appreciate that Heroes game fans take the time to write and express how they enjoy the musical aspects of the Heroes games. It means a lot to me because Rob and I really try our best to make good music from a technical and musical point of view. It is rewarding and heartwarming that people will actually notice and then write us to thank us, so I want to thank them. It is pointless to try and create good music if no one is listening and the great Heroes fans let us know that someone out there Is listening!\n\nRob King: Thank You for being so supportive of the music. Hearing all the positive feedback and the countless cover versions on YouTube of the various themes over the past 2 decades is truly amazing, especially from all the Eastern European fans. Paul & I always have a blast working on these scores and it has become a big part of our musical existence. Thank you for letting us continue our role on Heroes.\n\nThank you , much love. - شكرا لك، الكثير من الحب. - Dziękuję, dużo miłości. - Спасибо, много любви. - Σας ευχαριστούμε, πολλή αγάπη. - Gracias, mucho amor. - با تشکر از شما، بیشتر عشق. - Merci, Much Love.\n\nCheers,\n\nPaul Romero & Rob King\n\n↧\n\nThe Campaign - Fan Web Series\n\nHello Heroes,\n\nLast week we introduced the Fan series “The Campaign”, based on the Sylvan vs. Fortress vote for MMH7.\n\nAs war rages between the two candidates Thorin Fatbelly & Lidowyne Greenleaf, no holds barred in this race for a place in Ivan’s Council.\n\nToday we are glad to share with you the first episodes of this saga from the team Cheapmovies, do not hesitate to check their YouTube channel http://goo.gl/06o49N.\n\nSylvan vs. Fortress, have you made up your mind yet?

But in the Empire the troubles were only beginning…\n\nTales of the Ten Years War\n\n844 YSD – The Conclave of the New Dawn\n\nMaeve’s death had been avenged. With Falcon’s Reach reduced to a pile of smoldering ruins, the fallen Empress’ body was taken to the imperial Summer Palace, near Whitecliff, in the Greyhound Duchy. There she received funerals worthy of her rank: her body was cremated, letting, as per the custom, her essence rise towards the sun towards Elrath.\n\nNo one could ignore the mounting tension during the ceremony. All the Dukes and Duchesses were in attendance.\n\nIvan of Griffin, Maeve’s avenger.\n\nSeamus of Stag.\n\nAmílcar of Bull.\n\nRowena of Unicorn.\n\nEnguerrand of Greyhound.\n\nStefan of Wolf.\n\nIf Maeve’s son Brendan were truly dead, one of them would soon become Emperor or Empress.\n\nSoon after Maeve’s funeral, the Church of Light announced the creation of the Conclave of the New Dawn in the holy city of Flammschrein. This assembly of Angels, priests and scholars, led by the beloved Archangel and war hero Sandalphon, was to decide who would inherit the crown. Of course, even centuries after Uriel’s infamous Deception, many citizens of the Empire still had reservations regarding the Church’s impartiality, suspecting the Priests and Angels would simply pick the candidate that would serve their own interests best.\n\nTo alleviate these suspicions, Sandalphon decided to invite an Angel named Murazel to sit at the Conclave. “Guardian of Hammer Fall, brave heart of the purest Light, I trust you. I trust you to help us choose the best possible Emperor for this great nation. I trust you to keep us honest and true. Will you join the Conclave of the New Dawn, and sit at my side once again through these testing times?”\n\nIt was a brilliant move: Murazel was a figure of legend, known to favour Humans over her fellow Angels. She had helped the Free Cities of the East on numerous occasions, sometimes against the Empire, and her own kind considered her a renegade. If there was an Angel who would never compromise her ethics for personal gain or politics, it was Murazel.\n\nMurazel accepted Sandalphon’s offer, and departed Hammer Fall for Flammschrein, putting an end to six centuries of exile.\n\nA Falcon by any other name…\n\nOf course, as soon as the Conclave was established, many young men arrived in Flammschrein, claiming they were Maeve’s son Brendan. The Conclave interviewed them, and in the end rejected them all. Some Conclave members insisted the rascals needed to be tortured or executed publicly, to set an example. True to herself, Murazel spoke vehemently against this solution, and proposed to send them to jail for one year instead, to “meditate” on their life choices. The wise Sandalphon approved Murazel’s suggestion. It proved dissuasive enough.\n\nSeveral weeks passed, and the Conclave was still debating, or investigating leads regarding Brendan’s possible survival. Within the Empire, tension was growing. Everybody had an opinion about who should sit on the throne. All Dukes and Duchesses had at least one Falcon ancestor in their family tree, and they were all building their cases, gathering genealogical documents and other proofs of their heredity.\n\nThe most obvious candidate was Seamus of Stag. The house of Stag was cousin to the Falcons, and it seemed this strong family bond could not be questioned. Yet some scholars pointed out that Seamus was not a descendant of the main Stag bloodline, which had gone extinct around the Second Eclipse, but of a remote branch, cousins by marriage. He had some Falcon blood, but not as much as he would have hoped.\n\nThese same scholars had their sights on a more potent candidate: Ivan of Griffin. It was brought to light that Ivan descended from both the Falcon and the main Stag bloodlines. The great hero of the Second Eclipse, Duke Anton, had later become Empress Gwendolyn’s consort, fathering three children with her, the second of which then inherited the Griffin Duchy. But Anton’s own mother had been Cate of Stag, the sole member of her house to have had children.\n\nNeedless to say, Seamus was not pleased by the work of these scholars.\n\nWar of the Words\n\nAccusatory whispers started to spread in the taverns all around the Empire. These rumours claimed that it was Ivan who had led the Demons inside Falcon’s Reach, hoping to inherit the throne after Maeve’s death. If Ivan was innocent, then how did he know where Jezebeth was hiding? Was he really trying to avenge Maeve… or was he just making sure the Succubus would remain silent?\n\nAt the time, Ivan was courting Seamus’ daughter, Nolwenn. As the rumour grew stronger, Seamus publicly forbade his daughter to see Ivan again. “The Griffin may have blood on his wings”, he famously stated. Amílcar of Bull, who had inherited an old family grudge towards the Griffins and had always distrusted Ivan, made accusations of his own, much less subtle.\n\nThe other Dukes were not so eager to join in Seamus and Amílcar’s accusations, but they demanded that Ivan revealed how he knew where Jezebeth was hiding, to put this matter to rest once and for all. Stubborn and proud Ivan refused to explain himself. To you, my fellow shadow councillors, I can reveal he had learnt about Jezebeth from a trusted informant, and being a man of honour he simply would not betray his source. When Amílcar of Bull claimed Ivan’s silence was enough proof of his duplicity, Ivan challenged Amílcar to a duel. “There’s nothing I need to be ashamed of”, he said. “Let Elrath choose who is telling the truth, and who is spreading lies!”\n\nTwo weeks before the anniversary of Maeve’s death, Ivan and Amílcar met on neutral ground, in a small town called Brookshire, within the former Falcon province. Declaring himself Maeve’s champion, Amílcar unsheathed his sword. There was tumult among the witnesses when they recognized the legendary Blade of Truth, the ancestral sword of the Falcon dynasty, one of the seven “Bastards of Elrath”. Ivan saluted his foe with the Griffin’s Blade of Revelation, and the duel began.\n\nIvan was younger, faster, more powerful, but Amílcar was more experienced, more skilled, more cunning. Their duel lasted thirty agonizing minutes during which it seemed they were evenly matched. The blades clashed, again and again. And the unimaginable happened: one of Ivan’s blows shattered the Blade of Falcon to pieces.\n\nDisarmed and shocked, Amílcar admitted his defeat. Ivan had proven his innocence in a fair fight, but an ominous feeling descended upon the audience. Many felt the broken sword was no coincidence: it was an omen heralding the end of the Falcon Empire.\n\nThree days later, the bells of Flammschrein started ringing, but their song was dreary and doleful. It was a death-knell. Sandalphon was dead; a dark blade had been plunged into his heart. Murazel was nowhere to be found.\n\n↧\n\nEnd of the deliberations\n\nSo, the time allotted to the vote is now coming to an end. The response was overwhelming, and it quickly became pretty clear that within our Shadow Council a majority believes the Elves of Irollan would make adequate allies for Ivan.\n\nSo be it then.\n\nI’ll talk with Ivan soon, and advise him to send a missive to High-King Alaron of the Elves. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of a strong alliance between the forest kingdom and the house of Griffin. Time will tell.\n\nIn any case, I’m curious about the identity of the ambassador Alaron will send to Ivan’s court. I’ll share my discoveries with the Shadow Council as soon as I know more.\n\n…Mmm? My own vote? Is it important?\n\n…Very well. I actually voted for the Dwarves. But the Shadow Council is all about making a collective decision, and I intend to respect this. I don’t believe there are “good” or “bad” choices, only… opportunities.\n\nThe Shadow Council is adjourned. We shall meet again soon.\n\n↧"
