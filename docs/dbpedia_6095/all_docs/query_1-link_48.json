        "text": "No garnacha at table. State of the world. Swords in the field. Lambs pursued by hunger starvéd wolves. Tragedy treading heels of tragedy. Those damned old fires of hatred and greed. Always been burning since the world’s been turning, as Billy Joel put it.\n\nWe think to be or not to Bb but we know not what we may be. Sam Shepard’s dramatic structure borrowed from a jazz piece. Dramatic cadences and elements interweave and repeat until moonlight shines out of the play. Like a dowager? Influenced by Shepard’s one time room mate, Charles Mingus? Or perhaps just “in the air”. Liebniz. Newton. The air is full of sounds. Noises. Off. Maybe not as funny.\n\nWhile it may not always be Suicide in Bb, we still continue down the road to becoming ghosts. Storm or shine or blank of day. Parade of tomorrows. Novels, paintings, poetry, video games. All the influences of sky and dry grass. Roses growing in banks. In heaps. Long grass, waiting fingers to consume us.\n\nThings we long for, even as the weather turns cold.\n\nHow we long for “A forked mountain, or blue promontory/ With trees upon’t, that nod unto the world”. Antony’s words just before his death painting gorgeous, changeable skies.*\n\nBells toll incessantly. For me. For thee. Galloping horsemen close behind us. Hot breath on the neck of Golden Horn Hooligan while the world grows cold around us.\n\nStill no Brigadoon. Only the mist over the moors at midnight. Our hearts weep but no one comes. No village appears. No maiden. We lock ourselves in. Double lock ourselves in, which is not our custom.\n\nOutside, cows browse the margins of stubbled fields. The last brindled snakes of autumn lie across our path, soaking up the last fragrance of the light, the last remnants of the early autumn sun. One lone adolescent coyote forages through the vines. Field mice deeper underground. Will there be enough for winter? Should have thought of that before you turned your back on the too hot fields. The field is “now canopied/ Under these windows, white and azure laced/ With blue of heaven’s own tinct.”**\n\nLeaves die back and cooler weather paints the lands against a cosmos in retreat. Spaces curl in upon themselves.\n\nWe are weary, weary. Pervading sense of just not going there. Not Bartleby preferring not to, but being unable to. Unable to go, to see, to look, to hear. Oh, I could think but for this screaming in mine ears. Every night at the same hour. The sound from that skull.\n\nAnd lambs with us, those like snakes and doves, to whom can we turn? “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.”*** Those amongst us, in the sleepy towns, the safe towns, the quiet neighborhoods, who would or will readily open fire indiscriminately in public places. Berserkers laying about them with their sharp swords, cutting even into crowds in the marketplace.\n\nStrange men wandering the neighborhoods with electronic devices, trying to hack into household internet accounts. Strange cars patrol the streets, looking for work trucks which might be full of tools. The holidays are coming. Incidence of armed robberies on the rise.\n\nIs this collective grief? Collective rage?\n\nSome still pose themselves as avenging angels, crusading to save children from indoctrination–from drag shows or cross thinking. A woman’s weeds. Or a man’s. We need to check our genitalia. Check that at the door. (No, guns are allowed, just not genitalia.) Only what a birth certificate says. Or what scriptures says.\n\nAngel wannabes donning gowns and wings and banning books so children cannot read them. High schoolers cannot read them. The righteous plucking out their own children’s eyes so that they cannot see things which might have been written, painted, created, or considered, by those whose thoughts do not conform to some amalgamated image of righteousness. Naked statues? Must be evil because the tree of good and evil cannot be about knowledge. It must be sexual.\n\nIf it is knowledge though, then we shall ban knowledge. As long as we consolidate thinking, power, money. We must not let them think, these young ones. We must point them in the right direction. It is our duty.\n\nWhat does your own kingdom of heaven look like? Mine has old seventies style shag carpet and settees covered in brocade.\n\nNah, nah.\n\nThe barge she sat in like a burnished throne\n\nBurned on the water. The poop was beaten gold,\n\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\n\nThe winds were lovesick with them.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra 2.2.227-30\n\nReally? Hadn’t thought of that. Maybe have some of that next year albeit one gets tired of blue. We’ve done the seaside theme so often, but can one ever have enough of it? Ever have enough of love, garnacha, and the long night’s journey into day? Burnished beaten gold hanging from the trees reminds us. We grow old.\n\nThe rude angels of mismatched design. Higgledy piggeldy presentation. Sloppy thinking. Legions of Youtube channels have arisen in efforts to banish them. Promote them. Who furthers demonic aims?\n\nThe quick and easy fix. The hack. Brilliant way to peel your lemons, eggs, pomegranates. If Persephone had only known, maybe it all should have been different.\n\nDissent arrived early for dinner. First in the chow line. Uninvited but arising. Generated naturally out of the rich brocade of human nature. The nature of our dreams.\n\nWhy does it seem that avenging angels, punishing angels, were the first angels? First created by God? Why? What might that teach us? Right from wrong? Tree of knowledge? Tell us that being bad is more fun than being good? Donald Sutherland the tempter biting the apple.\n\nHow might we be wrong or imperfect in the eyes of a perfect being? If thine eye offend thee. . .? What if thy neighbor offend thee? The neighbors all out in the streets, carrying laptops, tablets, devices, trying to hack into our internet accounts. Do we blast them? Smite them? Annihilate them?\n\nOur collective rage rises up, a climbing mountain of wave. Rage. The dark side. Cookies.\n\nKeeping tabs on others. Judging them. We may not mean to but we do. In them we see the faults we had and add some extra new ones too. (So sorry, Philip.)\n\nAs if we do not have our own transgressions. Whistling past the graveyard. Such a broad and fanciful graveyard. Overgrown. Glittering under hoarfrost.\n\nGraves yawning before us. “Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn’t there to save them because you weren’t there to save Harry.” (So sorry, Charles, Frank, Philip Van Doren Stern, and Henry Travers.)\n\nWe turn away, we turn away. We turn our faces towards the day, Yet always we are becoming ghosts. Ghosts in the field. In the tall grass. Our sullied flesh melting, thawing, and resolving itself into a less congenial frost.\n\nOh, up ahead see the darkness falling over the vast fields of the republic. As at twilight, we can no longer see clearly. Not that we ever could, but darkling shadows gather devouring what sight we had. Still, we are so often certain we are right. There are rules. Regulations. Right and wrong are absolute. We judge others and we judge ourselves.\n\nWe punish others, letting them know when what they’re doing is wrong. Leveling lives casually and indiscriminately because others seem menacing, different. They seem to be threatening us, our well being, or (for the most part) just annoying us. “You used up all the glue on purpose.” The old Darren McGavin line applies these days to immigrants. To them. They’ll use up all the healthcare. It won’t be sustainable. If we can only hold our little part of the world together, the rest of it can go to hell. At least we’ll be okay.\n\nIn the end, we become vengeful ghosts. We smile. Patient. Waiting. Awaiting the downfall of those who have wronged us.\n\nGrudges are like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die, we are told. The vengeful ghost responds: fine. Don’t mind dying as long as the other person dies too.\n\nNever wanted in to the damned union to begin with. Never voted for that. (Only my ancestors voted, prayed, scraped, and fought, to make such divisions less likely to ever happen again.) Immigrants poison the lifeblood of a community? A nation? A people (whatever that means). We divide ourselves. Partition the world. Slicing it up like party cake. Not enough for them too. Not enough in the purse for others. Refugees. People who will use up all the national resources on purpose.\n\nOh, how we tread the paths of despots who came before us. Division. As long as we don’t have to pay for it.\n\nBut then, if we really stop to think about it, we all pay for it, no matter who we shut out with fences, walls, or armed guards. It costs us. It costs the world.\n\nAnd over here, the first child of division, of partition. War. That big, ugly mug. Sitting on it’s own throne of refuse. Burnished? Question of polishing a. . .what?\n\nWell, I didn’t vote for this, at least. I only voted to keep uneducated, job stealing foreigners out. I only voted because I know the colonials are X or Y, lazy, uneducated, shiftless. They are harmful. Overpaid, overfed, oversexed, and over here.\n\nThose people. (Who are “those people” anyway? Well, they’re certainly not us.)\n\nShowing up late for wars and taking all the credit.\n\nOthers threaten public safety. Best to keep them out. A government’s job is to build walls. To keep us secure–we the hard working, the noble, the fairy tale denizens of our original country. Yet, those fairy dances only leave rings of mushrooms behind them. Perhaps the fairies build walls too, to keep us out of fairyland because we are unworthy. Why Chaucer writes of how the fairies have all vanished.\n\nA government must not spend money taking care of the indigent. Those people. It is their own fault that they are not willing to work.\n\nThe halt. The lame. The blind.\n\nWe should not have to pay taxes to support them. “If you see a blind man, kick him. Need you be kinder than God?”\n\nOh, we can be mean at base. Mean.\n\n(Leave aside here those working two or three jobs, often while trying to raise a family, and remaining unable to make ends meet. Leave aside those who cannot find a job to support themselves, a job which pays enough to keep a roof. Most available jobs at minimum wage won’t pay for lodgings for anyone, at least not anywhere in the United States. Probably elsewhere as well.)\n\nOh, I don’t mean them. You know I don’t. I’m not heartless.\n\nThen why vote like that?\n\nNo “socialized” medicine here! That’s communism. Everyone knows that socialism is merely communism under a different name.\n\nMeanwhile, great cities arise. The unsheltered, who eke out an existence far from the fertile fields. Living in doorways, on council or on county land. In tents if they can get them. On road medians and the edges of highways.\n\nThe “homeless problem”? Is this because “no one wants to work anymore”?\n\nMeanwhile, we cut education to the bone. We cut public health and mental health initiatives to the bone. (Oh, maybe that was Reagan and Thatcher, I forget.)\n\nMost of the population used to have some cursory introduction to literature and drama, which gave them the rudiments of a context for considering and sorting ideas. But because these subjects, when deeply studied, do not tend to produce lucrative careers, now there is only STEM. The savior/damnation of the modern world. It’s really all about money, as the PM asserts. (Oh, not in those words, of course. It’s all couched in some rhetoric designed to make killing the humanities seem reasonable and humane.)\n\nThe natural economies of the world will kill it all for us in any case. No one wants to end up in a cardboard and tent city, unable to afford even a smart phone.\n\nAnd while the world burns, we’ll soon be able to give people implants which will contain all of the humanities, all of our collective humanity, with an AI to sort it for us. The shelterless won’t have them, of course, but the rest of us will be clever then. We will call to mind great and pertinent quotations at parties–things which people once had to work to memorize. Our own faculties will fade away, our natural memories unnecessary.\n\nWhere does it lead? This bright world increasingly askew? It tilts us into the fire.\n\nCan we learn any lessons from human history? (Oh, wait. We cut that beyond the scope of basic “western civ” courses. History doesn’t make money. Rip off the rearview mirror. What’s behind us does not matter. And how in time?\n\nWill we learn in time that the very idea of “otherness” wreaks havoc on the world? Will we learn it in time? Years. Lifetimes. Bloodlines? Who is more damned? Sinners? Punishers? We judge. We pronounce. We exclude. Gleefully.\n\nDamnation comes to us in many forms, but mostly dressed in grief and rage. Irretrievable moments. Shots fired which we cannot call back. Oh, great sorrow for all the sides in wars, all the innocents, all the lost talent, lost ways, lost meaning.\n\nBonfire, bonefire, of veritas, vanitas, vegitas. A falling away. Falling away from enlightenment.\n\nThe Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.****\n\nYet, if it is written, let us ban the books. Burn the books. We must protect the children. (Well, our own children. Who cares what other children believe or think?) We must construct the kind of society we need. Whole. Pure. Holy.\n\nSatan lives in “alternative” ideas. Ideas outside of whatever scripture we believe.\n\nWe engineer society for safety. Not to lord it over others. Not to tell them what to do with their own sordid peculiarities. Except they shall not live amongst us, not adjacent to us. No. We do not want to hear the dogs barking in the neighboring state, so we will silence them. Shoot them, if need be.\n\nWhat of the small ghosts, little ones wandering the world in search of peace and kindness. Oh, that’s why we have holidays.\n\nEven when the peace itself enrages us, even when we feel compelled to take up arms as others have done, we will be left in incandescent rage. We grow larger. Vigilantes. Riding the night hunt endlessly. Knights of Oberon’s train. Step off your horse and become the dust.\n\nPerhaps we trespass as those have trespassed against us, but we have God on our side. Anton LaVey telling us, “Do unto others as they do unto you.” How can we see otherwise when we are correct, right? Jesus loves me (but not necessarily you). This I know for the Bible tells me so.\n\nEnough.\n\nIt often seems we play a losing hand against the cold darkness of the world falling around us. We have no other choice. We buy peacemakers.\n\nSome become vengeful ghosts. Not hand wringing, but winging into the world on little bat wings, seeking those who have wronged us, seeking the great cosmic correction fluid of the typewritten page. Tears. Piety. Wit. Rage. Call the hand back or we will cancel the writing altogether.\n\nIf martyrs teach us anything, they teach us that what wounds most is love, and that wounds do not heal. Instead, they offer us choices. We can become angels, ghosts, or hollow men, headpiece filled with straw.\n\nBut are any of these states really us? Our original? Providence in the fall of a sparrow? Oh, no. Not tears. Not rage. We strive endlessly for peace remaining unforgiven. No one takes us seriously. “Man’s reach should exceed his grasp or what’s a heaven for?”\n\nIs the end of the road like Browning’s heaven? Or might that ending be painted other ways?\n\nShould we work in shops and sleep in doorways forever? The very cold in our bones awakens vengeful ghosts and they rise up like night around us.\n\nWhat roads do they take? Where should we look when we cannot read the news? The news draws our eyes endlessly to the hell scroll. We cannot look away.\n\nOh, we should look away? We should. We must. We pull away from social media. We minimize our presence. We become a ghost. Watching only kills us. Slowly. Quickly.\n\nYet it also shows us that suffering is not only our own.\n\nPerhaps our morbid fascination might also stir compassion. Empathy. As the humanities used to do.\n\nAfrica. Asia. Europe. The Americas. We watch struggles. Watching ourselves. Watching others striving. Starving.\n\nWe have struggles too. Disease. Housing. Hunger. Maybe we really are all fellow travellers on the ghost road. The late light slanting down making the shadows long and lean.\n\nIt won’t be that long now. Can’t be.\n\nEveryone we meet, smiling or stern, in glee or rage, endures the sometimes terrible vagaries of life.\n\nBeyond our own faculties to judge anyone really. Nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so. Bright and dark marks streak our souls, and we become zebras of infinite complexity. Infinite jest.\n\nVote as we will. Behave as we will. No mere ghost will stop us.\n\nStill, it behooves us and the world to extend the hand of kindness when we can. To think of others, of the different, more as being in the same boat. Doing the best for ourselves and those near to us.\n\nFor the problem with the world may lie not so much in violations of prescribed rules, but in unconcern and apathy. Better to touch hands with one’s neighbor, and try one’s best to understand them.\n\nWere we able to address poverty and fear, we might go far (even now) in righting the listing ship of our world. Will we? I don’t know. But even a ghost can hope.\n\n*Antony and Cleopatra 4.14.6-7\n\n**Cymbeline 2.2.24-5\n\n***KJV Matthew 7:15\n\n****The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, trans. Edward FitzGerald. (Sometimes controversial, but also familiar.)\n\nYes, this is a repost. Suitable for the season though, for times when many cultures remember their dead.\n\nAlso, ghosts can be surprisingly busy. Often busier than we intend. The living seem to think that it’s all just quiet rest and smooth sailing once we pass, but no. Believe you me. There can be an awful lot going on.\n\nAnd sometimes, ghosts can be called hither and yon on various errands, which can be errands involving memory and regret, especially those still carried by mortal spirits in the world.\n\nGreat Caesar’s Ghost\n\nWe have just reached that point where latest night bleeds into earliest morning. A man paces restlessly in a tent in the middle of a military encampment, all his companions long since asleep. The crucial battle looms ahead of him, and his mind won’t let him rest. Doubts surround his noblest convictions, threatening to vanquish them. Thoughts of long-lost friends and lovers are awash in waves of pain and deep regret.\n\nTortured by these reflections, the man hears a small sound. Turning, he sees someone standing before him. One of his dearest friends. A man whom he helped to assassinate, believing that his friend’s death would be better for the world.\n\nIn Act 4, scene 3 of The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar’s portentous ghost appears to Brutus. The ghost foretells Brutus’ final defeat at the hands of Marc Antony’s triumvirate forces in the coming battle at Philippi, but Caesar’s appearance also marks a final condensation and embodiment of Brutus’ own doubts and guilt.\n\nWhile we are used to ominous ghosts appearing in the plays of Shakespeare and in those of his early modern colleagues, these spectral devices have classical antecedents in Roman tragedy, and they have specific dramatic functions. Apparitions frequently mark pivotal moments in the plot, moments where a lead character’s fortune alters, or moments where the play’s tone or the plot direction is about to change in some significant way.\n\nYet, ghosts can also perform expository and narrative functions. In Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy, the ghost of the Spanish officer, Andrea, consorts with the embodied persona of Revenge to serve as a kind of chorus, offering a simultaneous commentary and directional indication for the play. In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which was perhaps written 15 to almost 20 years after Kyd’s influential drama, the ghost of prince Hamlet’s father becomes, in a sense, a coalescence of memory and revenge in a single figure. Old Hamlet’s ghost is a manifestation of a kingdom ill at ease, of the dis-ease within the state, a personification of the way in which the former kingdom’s leadership has been murdered, metaphorically to become a ghost of its former potent self.\n\nNeither need spirits be singular or strictly linked to the past. In Shakespeare’s Richard III, for example, the titular character is visited in his sleep by a number of ghosts of various people whom he has murdered, and this dire omen, as Caesar’s ghost does to Brutus, presages his defeat and death in the upcoming battle of Bosworth Field. However, in Macbeth, in addition to the prophesying spirits that appear to him in Act 4, scene 1, Macbeth is also shown a procession of future kings who will be descended from his former friend, Banquo. These future ghosts have no dialogue, but they speak strangely to our sense of fate and predetermination, further accelerating Macbeth’s already rapid descent.\n\nCaesar’s ghost does this as well, not only indicating Brutus’ impending downfall, but also precipitating the denouement of the entire play. Yet, in keeping with the nature of ghosts themselves, the appearance of Caesar’s ghost in Act 4 of Julius Caesar also encompasses a broader dimension than that of a simple perfunctory dramatic device. On a character level, the ghost combines a quickening confluence of circumstances with a dramatic turning point, not just in the weary Brutus’ fortunes, but in the character’s mind and spirit as well.\n\nAppearing in the liminal space at the very edge of dreams, the ghost confronts a Brutus who has already been navigating psychologically choppy seas. Just before the ghost’s appearance in the play, Brutus has argued with his co-conspirator, Cassius, and he has also been contemplating the death of his beloved wife, Portia. The row with Cassius has hinted to Brutus that he may have been relatively isolated in the nobility of his own motivations in participating in Caesar’s assassination. He has been pointedly confronted with the idea that other conspirators may have participated in the assassination more from hope of personal gain than from a genuine effort to secure the greater good of Rome.\n\nSo, this phantom moment in the play characterizes profound emotional and intellectual isolation. Even the musician has fallen asleep and the music has gone silent. Alone with the profound ache of his wife’s recent death, and with the chasm of potentially having committed to a questionably moral cause yawning at his spiritual feet, Brutus’ painful self-examination marks a true dark night of the soul.[i] It is into such moments of enormous emptiness that ghosts most often appear to us.\n\nEnter the Ghost of CAESAR\n\nBRUTUS\n\nHow ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?\n\nI think it is the weakness of mine eyes\n\nThat shapes this monstrous apparition.\n\nIt comes upon me. Art thou any thing?\n\nArt thou some god, some angel, or some devil,\n\nThat makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?\n\nSpeak to me what thou art.\n\nGHOST\n\nThy evil spirit, Brutus.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nWhy comest thou?\n\nGHOST\n\nTo tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nWell; then I shall see thee again?\n\nGHOST\n\nAy, at Philippi.\n\nBRUTUS\n\nWhy, I will see thee at Philippi, then.\n\nExit Ghost[ii]\n\nThe ghost’s response to Brutus’ opening question leaves open the kind of interpretive space that we find elsewhere in Shakespeare, potentially allowing the line to be read in more than one way. While the ghost seems to say that, as an “evil spirit”, it is a spirit of ill omen to Brutus, it also states that it is “thy” evil spirit, and perhaps signifying Brutus’ own evil, representing the ripening fruits of his character’s past associations and transgressions—his participation in the confederacy to murder Caesar finally coming home to roost.\n\nIf we consider “thy evil spirit, Brutus” as a kind of reflection of Brutus’ own evil, it hearkens back to Cassius’ initial arguments to Brutus, when he first begins to beguile Brutus to join the conspiracy against Julius Caesar. Cassius’ statement in Act 1 that “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings” (JC, 1.2.148-9) is reflexive, turning responsibility back upon the self. Cassius speaks of personal advancement here, saying, “Brutus and Caesar—what should be in that ‘Caesar’? /Why should that name be sounded more than yours?” (150-1). In spite of Brutus’ later assertion, “Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?” (4.3.20), Caesar’s murder nonetheless retains the taint of having been motivated by personal gain, haunted by the ghost selfish glory possibly having supplanted the greater good.\n\nNot surprisingly, Brutus seems somewhat resigned to the news that Caesar’s ghost will see him at Philippi. His response, “Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then” indicates not so much surprise or indignation as recognition and a possible reconciliation. For Brutus, from this point in the play, only the descent remains. He becomes both actor and character, ready to step through the curtained entrance of his camp tent and take his character’s place for his final segment of the play.\n\nIn terms of performance-based considerations, “enter the ghost of Caesar” tells us that the apparition should be recognizable—that the audience should be able to identify the ghost as Caesar’s as readily as Brutus does. Caesar’s ghost speaks with Brutus directly, representative of an active past that remains with the audience in the ongoing world of the play. Whether emblematic of the past mistakes, regret, or of the mounting force of impending failure the ghost’s presence remains a remarkably solid one, strongly indicating the approaching culmination of all of these forces. It may even be seen as a materialisation of Brutus’ own collective sorrows, gathering upon the stage.\n\nThis idea is especially sobering, reminding us how much our own pasts remain always with us. Our own sorrows and regrets wait just outside of our tents, ready to slip in and speak to us on late nights when we find ourselves so suddenly alone. In these shadowed moments, faces of vanished friends return to us, as we face what we might have done differently in our own lives.\n\nIn Julius Caesar, Caesar represents a great potential change for Rome. Caesar’s ghost, however, seems to represent something much more personal to Brutus and to us. It represents the things that haunt our lives and our dreams and return to us in our most solitary moments of reflection. Shakespeare reminds us that we all have our own inescapable ghosts following us, and that this is part of life. Ghosts represent those alchemical flashes when the past surfaces once again at the very moment that it transforms into the future.\n\nIn this heartbreaking moment, Shakespeare condenses Brutus’ movement away from friendship, and from the best part of himself. His loyalty has transformed into an empty scarecrow that overlooks mere rhetorical constructs of ‘honor’ and ‘nobility’. Even before Marc Antony tears them down, those words ring hollow because they have somehow been brought to Brutus from outside himself. In the moment that Caesar’s ghost confronts him, Brutus finally perceives his fatal mistakes as he faces a future that promises him the only kind of end to which such paths always seem to lead.\n\n___________\n\nSome time back, when the ghost still walked the world, he was conversing with a friend who denied the existence of ghosts. When asked if he had ever seen one, he said, “Of course not, because there’s no such thing!”\n\nStill, the ghost submits that there are indeed such things. Perhaps not always apparitions like those we see on stage or in the cinema, but things which follow us, trouble us, haunt us, sometimes for the whole span of our brief lives. These memories, regrets, and clinging bits of our past might not trouble those who lead exemplary lives, but show me where those are, and I’ll show you a fragile facade.\n\nIf ghosts really show us anything, they show us our own humanity, offering remembrance more immediate than any pressed flower in the pages of a book.\n\n[i] Brutus’ experience resonates strongly with the tortured isolation that frames La noche oxcura del alma, “The Dark Night of the Soul” written by the Spanish mystic, St. John of the Cross (San Juan de Cruz, 1542-1591). The opening lines of that poem read: On a dark night,/ Kindled in love with yearnings—oh, happy chance!—/ I went forth without being observed,/ My house being now at rest.

Ask a ghost.\n\nClues blow like scraps in the winds of the world. They float around us, sometimes reaching out their hands in offering. Sometimes the universe speaks to us.\n\nThe man of Valland, “so lame that that he was a cripple and went on his knees and knuckles“, one day had a dream. “He dreamt that a noble man came to him and asked where he would go, and he mentioned some town. And the noble man said ‘Go thou to St Olav’s Church which is in London and there thou wilt be healed.’ Then he awoke and straightaway went to find St Olav’s Church.” But in London, there were so many churches that no one could tell him where to go, or where the church might be. “But a little later a aman came up to him and asked where he might be going; he told him and the man then said: ‘We two shall both go to St Olav’s Church; I now the way there.’ Then they went over the bridge and on the street which brought them to St Olav’s Church. And when they cam to the churchyard gate the man stepped over the threshold of the gate, but the cripple rolled in across the the threshold and forthwith rose up healed. But when he looked about him, his companion had gone.“*******\n\nClap your hands. The goose is out. Body exposed in the golden wind.

This is the sad tragedy underlying the ongoing orphaning of English literature, drama, and the arts in U.S. universities (and everywhere else). We lose the truth for losing the way. Real truth is not a mere comparison, but is instead an actual thee, an actual summer’s day. The beacon of words leads us on to that realization, that seeing. It takes us to what we really long for in our deepest hearts.\n\nDifferent ways. Math can do this too. And biology. Anthropology. There is no exclusivity.\n\nBut words are designed to be like things. Signposts deliberately crafted to help us. To carry us when we become lost. If things are symbols, words are paths.\n\n“Mum said things were essentially emotions.

The Lily of the North. Slough: Maple Publishers, 2022, 213.\n\nWe typically think of angels as protectors and companions. Sometimes, they may be warriors. Destroyers of evil. Walking beside us. Keeping us safe.\n\nBut there are other angels who are not guardian angels. Not angels of “now I lay me down to sleep”. Not springtime nor summer’s day angels. Not by a long shot. Not someone to watch over you unless it be to watch you weep.\n\nAngels of sorrow. Angels of loss.\n\nAngels of dental work.\n\nThese angels are angels of uneasy nights. Of guilt, confusion, angels whose soul (sole) purpose seems to be to observe the senseless–tragedy, downfall, ruin. Loves gone wrong. Fortunes lost. Best laid plans gone off the rails.\n\nThese do not level Sodom and Gomorrah. They do not defeat heaven’s rebels or punish the wicked. Other angels bear heaven’s whips and scorns, but not these.\n\nThese are not the fearful scour of Allah’s desert wind. These are not angels of death. They do not bring peace at the end of the long and restless trail. These are the opposite of easy sleep and gentle dreams.\n\nAngels of the answer no.\n\nBut they include more than the angels of sorrow.\n\nThese are also angels of dead glass eyes looking back out of the dark. The angels of late hours and miles to go. Angels of the weary restless, of unnatural sounds. Angels of “what was that” during hours when it might be better not to know.\n\nThese are the angels of false friendship, of spilled secrets, of abandoned defense. These are the angels of false hope and sickness. Angels of the empty road through tough territory. The angels of empty words and hollow crowns.\n\nAngels of the darker swamps of the human soul. What swims beneath the murky water of our dreams? What rises from that black surface to gaze unsympathetic upon the sleeping world? What soft voice whispers promises after fatigue breaks down our sense of right and wrong? What hides in the jungles of the night?\n\nThere it is again. That late at night sound. Surely it is just the wind. Maybe a cat.\n\nThe half seen motion. Figure darting out of sight. Edge of vision angels cloaked in shadow. Slipping around the corner. Melting into the darkest edges of the gloom. Our secret damnation. If only they knew. If only.\n\nRetreating shiver dreams. Angels of doubt. Of suspicion.\n\nIn Henry IV part 2, the Chief Justice tells Falstaff:\n\nYou follow the young prince up and\n\ndown like his ill angel.\n\nHenry IV part 2, 1.2.166-7\n\nWhile the words are often taken to mean an ill angel as someone who leads to harm or offers a bad example, the words also may suggest an angel who might be somehow ill in themselves. Diseased. Not altogether well or whole.\n\nWhile the Justice implies that Falstaff is an ill meaning angel–a puck. misleading night wanderers, and laughing at their harm–his words also suggest something else. “Ill angel” may not be quite the same as an “ill-intentioned angel”, and certainly for all his vice, Falstaff is also no picture of good health.\n\nWe’ve written about Satan in previous posts.\n\nThe primary ill angel of western tradition, Lucifer’s exile from heaven presents a never ending dark night of the soul. The nature of the rebellion in heaven depends upon the tradition. It ranges from fomenting a conspiracy to an open and total war against those angels loyal to God. In the end, the exact circumstances seem to matter less than the aftermath.\n\nFor while Satan seems to excel at leading human souls astray, the banished former angel also remains a profoundly lonely figure. We picture him brooding over his lost kingdom of darkness on a lake of fire. Even with all the minions who serve him, Satan also seems to be perpetually accompanied by the angel of solitude. He is not only alone but also lonely.\n\nLucifer’s isolated landscape of smoke and blackened rock reflects both his outer and his inner reality. His own choices, impulses, or perhaps needs and characteristics have removed him from heaven’s table, and he has become an inversion of his former self. His fallen, diminished being contrasts his original magnificence. Other angels, erstwhile companions, have become adversaries. It is easy to imagine his dark turnings having congealed into a hard place within his heart.\n\nWrapped within the scope of those dark wings is the whole host of Pandora’s box. Worry. Trouble. Sorrow. Hurt. Those things which seem to walk beside us. With us. Always.\n\nLucifer becomes the leading angel of the sunset. Batwings. Not only the sunset of angels, but our sunsets as well.\n\nIn a mythological sense, Lucifer comes to embody inversion and perversion. Just as the first sorcerer in Diné cosmology breathed widdershins–reversing the sacred life breath (níłch’i). Like the other trickster figures to whom he is related (often coyote and/or jackrabbit in Native American cultures, and Falstaff too, in a sense), Satan reverses the natural order of being. In healthy individuals or societies, Lucifer represents the ever lurking threat of disease or profound social unrest. Slowing. Breaking down.\n\nThis contrasts any number of great goddesses (especially in Celtic tradition) who represent fertility. They not only project power and authority, but they also lend these to their partners (often through sexual relations which underscore the fertile nature of their being). Sex with the devil, however, made mortals into witches***, giving them powers to commit malevolent acts instead of abilities which might allow them to command, lead, unify, or rule. Witches became agents of disease. They eradicated ease and disseminated dissension.\n\nShakespeare’s Henry IV part 2 is filled with images of disease and its cousin, rumor (which spreads like disease). And although Falstaff characteristically deflects the idea, there is an underlying suggestion that he may be an ill angel indeed:\n\nFALSTAFF Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my\n\nwater?\n\nPAGE He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy\n\nwater, but, for the party that owed it, he might have\n\nmore diseases than he knew for.\n\nFALSTAFF Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me.\n\nThe brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is\n\nnot able to invent anything that intends to laughter\n\nmore than I invent, or is invented on me. I am not\n\nonly witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in\n\nother men. I do here walk before thee like a sow\n\nthat hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the\n\nPrince put thee into my service for any other reason\n\nthan to set me off, why then I have no judgment.\n\n2 Henry IV, 1, 2, 1-14.\n\nInstead of confronting his own illness, Falstaff becomes a kind of devil, pointing up the pride in others. He deflects his page’s words about the doctor’s ominous evaluation with the idea that men “take pride to gird” at him.\n\nSimilarly, when Satan notes that it is “Better to reign in Hell than serve in heaven”, his pronouncement carries the whiff of sour grapes along with a determination which has been wrung into especially ungenerous wine.**** His own illness and dissatisfaction shine even more brightly through the smoke and mirrors of his self delusion.\n\nThe adversary wears many seductive guises, and it employs many different kinds of angels. Adam and Eve’s serpent helps to engineer their expulsion from Eden. Beyond temptation the empty figures of rank solitude and desperation lie in wait. The seven deadly sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride, all of which are mentioned in previous posts) are only a beginning.\n\nYet seldom does the inversion confront us directly. The metaphor of Pilgrim’s Progress becomes just that, a rhetorical device. A counterpersuasion.\n\nUsually, the demonic remains hidden, working more subtly.\n\nWe all know the deal too good to be true. Attractive stranger, cash offer, or the golden ring spotted lying in the street.****** The innocent kiss on the cheek. A seemingly genuine hug. The friend who isn’t. The user. Slipping tiny gifts to hook our interest. The extended hand seeming righteous and royal, promising affectionate fidelity.\n\nPromises. Promises.\n\nBut what of Lola’s own contract? The sick angels of what we most desire–love, riches, or fame. How easy might the rule bend, or the shorter path arrive? It certainly can’t hurt us just this once.\n\nIago cautions Othello about jealousy, obliquely suggests that there may be reason to be jealous. Then Iago uses the word repeatedly, hammering it into Othello’s heart.\n\nOTHELLO: By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO:\n\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\n\nNor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.\n\nOTHELLO:\n\nHa?\n\nIAGO: O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!\n\nIt is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\n\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\n\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\n\nBut O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er\n\nWho dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!\n\nOTHELLO: O misery!\n\nIAGO:\n\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\n\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\n\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\n\nGood God, the souls of all my tribe defend\n\nFrom jealousy!\n\nOthello 3.3.191-206\n\nIago sows the idea of jealousy, and then fosters it. Angel of bad seeds. Ungenerous, pretending loyalty and honesty while secretly malevolent.\n\nAs ubiquitous as grief are these angels of uneasiness. They plague humanity endlessly. Our individual and collective blood pressure spikes each time someone opens fire in a cinema/supermarket/school/hospital/public place. Even miles, counties, states, or countries away it affects us. No person an island. One country invades another. A country forces down a passenger plane to jail a dissenter. The march of rising prices, failing healthcare, our lives described by the pronouncements of billionaires.\n\nWe engineer machines to think without really knowing what might happen. We practice eugenics without understanding how the human organism works. We believe that our little bit won’t really make a difference in the fight against climate change. We trust that God (or billionaires or corporations or someone) will take care of it before it gets too far out of hand.\n\nMedicine runs to “one size fits all” protocols while insurance companies or government budget offices dictate what treatment people receive, dictating what they will cover and what they will not. Meanwhile large pharmaceutical companies focus on marketing, on selling. The financial bottom line, profit, supplants wellness as a goal.\n\nSociety goes on baking Gordon Gecko’s lines from Wall Street into our psyche. Every week the financial news has a new article about people not needing more education, not needing university. All the while most people can’t seem to think their way through a wet tissue while the fonts of critical understanding, literature, drama, art, history, and philosophy, continue to vanish from the education marketplace. Because they don’t make money. They don’t make us billionaires.\n\nWe don’t need to improve ourselves. We need to make money. We’re told that the average American had better retire with three million dollars if they’re to retire comfortably. Rising costs of medical care? Vanishing Social Security? Medicare? Medicaid?\n\nAnd you folks in Europe or the British Isles reading this, remember Boris Johnson conferencing with Trump about privatising the NHS? That can’t and won’t happen there though. It will never happen there. The people would never let it, would they? They would rise up in revolt.\n\nYet Brexit was never going to pass either. The possibility was ridiculous. Who would vote for mere rhetoric, for proud sounding words like “independence” and slogans about “control of our own destiny” when they could participate in something bigger than themselves? Never happening, I tell you.\n\nBring me my Ruger plated gold:\n\nBring me my Arrows of desire:\n\nBring me my Spear: O clouds unfold:\n\nBring me my AR 15. Fire!\n\nIt will be okay. It will be okay. We won’t circle the wagons that far. We wouldn’t become medieval fiefdoms again–bordered, separated. Segregated. Bigoted. Keeping out the others–the Syrians, Afghans, refugees, or Hungarians who might be stealing our jobs, corrupting our kids. The Hindus, the Muslims, the (insert faith which isn’t my own here), the great manipulators of minds, thieves of our children’s souls.\n\nThe “look who’s talking fallacy” rears its ugly head out of the dark swamps of the human soul. Nations built on bigotry. Built on walls and separation. Anyone can become president, but for everyone else, much of day to day life in the United States remains an exercise in running to keep ahead of the financial reaper. Death and taxes, but taxes first.\n\nSTEM, STEM, STEM. No mention of arts or drama or literature or history. No philosophy. Such nonsense topics are poor choices in higher education. Parents need their children to make money. They cannot, will not, pay for foolishness. Poetry is fluffy nothing. Quit school and work. You could become manager. You might even move up from there.\n\nSome will. But the lie remains that hard work can get you there without generous scoops of luck. Hard work certainly. But people seem to overlook luck and connections. Cleverness and who one knows. The right place at right time-ness of it all.\n\nKeep the majority under employed. Keep them birthing to feed the corporate machine. Local labor nickle and dimed to death in an endless stream of economic attrition. The world runs on debt and it follows us on long, quick striding legs. Follows us in our days. Follows us in our dreams.\n\nThe terrifying uneasiness always snapping at our heels.\n\nThere will be those chiding the ghost for saying this. There will be those who respond, “Yeah, but I know a guy who became a billionaire selling t-shirts”. Of course you do. So do we all. People become movie stars and opera singers, sports personalities, and billionaires of all stripes every day. But the truth remains that many many more do not.\n\nDo billionaires chill out in front of Netflix? Not so often it seems. Too busy reading, making, minding, or cultivating their billions and their minds. Honing critical thinking even when their ideas prove crackpot. New deals. New ideas. Vending machines on Mars. Quadrilateral exoskeletons. Buying social media platforms or sports teams.\n\nDo these folks go see Shakespeare? Well, not in the United States, at least, where the fabled Oregon Shakespeare Festival seems to be fighting for its very financial survival. Too bad they missed The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nAnd what about non-billionaires? Eight hours of sleep a night when they can? Reach the age of forty and wonder why a solid manager’s salary no longer pays for much. Why they can’t afford eggs. Movies. Gasoline. Chewing gum. Does anyone still chew gum?\n\nWhat of the machinery itself? To function, a capitalist society needs worker bees–those who will continue to labor at the lower tiers to support the economic tiers above them. The people with money still need relatively affordable soap, dishes, fans, clothes hangers, clothes, computers, and (these days more than ever) phones. Even with the spread of robots (ask Cathie Wood, unless a trading AI takes over her job) someone has to help manufacture these.\n\nIn the meantime, in the U.S., degrees in English literature have become viewed as mostly useless. STEM is where we must compete. Listen to statesfolk. Congress. State legislatures. Staple passers. Selling gas. Selling staples. Talking. Passing.\n\nListen to the investors. Read the financial news. They’ll tell you just like they’ll tell you what you should buy, tell you what’s on sale on Amazon, and what latest skin product favored by celebrities. How did X get that glow at the Met Gala? Who’s going to that coronation anyway?\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly uneducated population becomes unable to comprehend political and social mechanisms, incapable of steering the ship of state. From veering to careening we go. Merrily we roll along, only voting what we see on television or what someone tells us. What we hear in church. At work. Or on the news. Fox crowing loudly until someone says, “Prove it.” Oops.\n\nYears ago, when the ghost was a person, it met a French lady who was working in a shop. She lamented the state of retirement in the U.S., the devastating lack of imagination.\n\n“Mon Dieu!” this lady exclaimed. “People retire here in the United States and then they go and get another job! Or they go play golf! Can’t they think of anything better to do with their time?”\n\nNothing against golf, but no. We either do not or we cannot think. We are forgetting/have forgotten how. Our constant feed of electronic streaming “content” robs us of our imagination.\n\nLoneliness, Surgeon General? We discuss little with anyone. We only watch. Our French lady could not imagine a more terrible fate than to work all of one’s life and then, faced with the opportunity for a departure into something creative, to instead go back to work again.\n\nYet, we can lay these ailments at the door of capitalist society if we wish, for we must continue to work. We must chase the three million gold pieces at the end of the rainbow even as the amount becomes five million, eight million, ten, twenty. Just over that hill. Remaining elusive for most folks even in a world where new billionaires seem to pop out of the woodwork.\n\nOnce one grows too “mature” for whatever one does, one must transfer to other industries. Not always less glamorous, these occupations may or may not pay the bills, but at least they contribute. Store clerk. Warehouse worker. Dog walker. Someone who spent a life in the insurance industry can always become a consultant–giving seminars on insurance options or how to retire.\n\nHow to retire. The brass ring at the end of the road. Retirement. Freedom.\n\nSome angel beckons. Let’s hope it is an angel of satisfaction, and not the angel of despair.\n\nOr that old angel of envy. “Be thankful for what you have”. Yes. Yet, when you are eighty and can no longer pay your medical bills, fewer roads remain open to you.\n\nSatan takes Job’s life in hand, and that expression about the patience of Job comes from the patience of Job. Exemplary. Exceptional. Is the reward of patience really patience? What good does that do us in the end, St. Augustine, if we can no longer live on what we have?\n\nSage advice? Platitudes?\n\nYet many would have us believe that people are only poor because they are lazy.\n\nOh, but we do not condemn. We are not the executioners. Not us. We’ll elect the next politician and they’ll do better for us. They’ll help us stop this madness.\n\nFor we have run mad. The angel of madness hovers close at hand. So close.\n\nMeanwhile, Shakespeare companies, theatre companies, simple drama groups close left and right and roll up the sidewalks for lack of funding. Who has time? There’s so much to see on Netflix, on Prime, on Hulu, Disney, Apple TV, and it’s cheaper than those tickets for live theatre. Less chance of catching something too.\n\nBesides, Shakespeare? Really? It’s so passé. We had to read one of those in high school, the one about the lovers who kill themselves because the message doesn’t get through? I’d rather watch Virgin River on Netflix. Something with language you can understand. More modern. Who wants to listen to that old crap? Who wants to support the words of the ancient, white, patriarchal, western European establishment?\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet. Who did not read Shakespeare? What writers and thinkers have not?\n\nFalstaff is a kind of fallen staff, bending the truth like balloon animals. His moral decay is cautionary to us. We should avoid becoming such a masterpiece of ruin.\n\nThe relationship between Falstaff and Hal remains as complicated as any modern plot with a touch of angel woven into it. For as much as he expects eventual advancement of the prince, Falstaff also loves him. And in some sense, Hal’s rejection of Falstaff (once Prince Hal has become King Henry V) is deeply painful. Tragic.\n\nIn Henry V, when Falstaff lies dying, Hostess Quickly says, “By my troth, he’ll yield the crow a pudding\n\none of these days. The King has killed his heart” (2.1.85-6).\n\nThere’s the true illness. The sad angel peering out of the play at us. For although physical ailments may be daunting, even unbeatable, death of the heart leaves us no escape. No exit, if you will.\n\nMiracles do happen. We may yet recover from cancers and all manner of sorrows. But the loss of a profound love? That may be the rub. That late thought in all the remaining empty nights of our lives.\n\nWhen love has gone, by death or doorway, do we ever fully recover from the blow? True loss, true grief, true despair, is like the angel at top of this page. A stone too immovable to shudder in its sorrow. Still, cold, and weeping in the elements forever.\n\n*Angel of grief, 1894 sculpture by William Wetmore Story which serves as the grave stone of the artist and his wife Emelyn at the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.

Such a wagoner\n\nAs Phaëton would whip you to the west\n\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\n\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\n\nThat runaways’ eyes may wink, and Romeo\n\nLeap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.\n\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\n\nBy their own beauties, or, if love be blind,\n\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\n\nThou sober-suited matron all in black,\n\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match\n\nPlayed for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\n\nHood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,\n\nWith thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,\n\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\n\nCome, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in\n\nnight,\n\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\n\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\n\nCome, gentle night; come, loving black-browed\n\nnight,\n\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\n\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\n\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\n\nThat all the world will be in love with night\n\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\n\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love\n\nBut not possessed it, and, though I am sold,\n\nNot yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day\n\nAs is the night before some festival\n\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\n\nAnd may not wear them.\n\nRomeo and Juliet, 3.2.1-33.\n\nWe get it. Juliet urges the sun to quicken its course across the sky. She’s in a terrible hurry not just to see Romeo, but also to be with him physically, to lie with him. In Juliet’s soliloquy, Romeo becomes a blend of night and day. His brilliance, and perhaps also the brilliance of her attraction, makes him day in night–something which shines out even in the darkness of night.\n\nIf only the day would pass more quickly. We can feel this, the idea of having bought the mansion of love but not possessed it–of having given our hearts, but not yet brought our body and soul to the giving. We understand this wild fructifying urgency. It borders on desperation and the need consumes us as it does Juliet.\n\nYet, as with so many desperate pleas, something within this also feels vaguely apocalyptic. In the first line, for example, yes, Juliet is talking about the horses of the sun–the steeds that pull the sun chariot of Helios/Phoebus/Apollo. While it seems natural that the sun’s horses should be “fiery-footed”, the word fiery also hints at fire’s potentially destructive aspect. A galloping horse afire might suggest the horse of the second seal of the apocalypse in the Biblical Book of Revelation. In the section describing the events indicating the approaching end of the world, a red (fiery) horse comes at the opening of the second seal:\n\nWhen He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come and see.” Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.\n\nNew King James Bible, Revelation 6:3\n\nFire, red, blood, Armageddon. Abaddon (from the Hebrew) or Apollyon (from the Greek) being the demonic figure representing destruction or doom is a destroying angel of the abyss. Hastening the end of Christian creation.\n\nWell, okay. Maybe. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we wind it back just a bit, maybe Juliet is merely talking about the sun–only really thinking about hurrying the day to finish so that she gets to see her love. Fine. But the ghost isn’t the only one who sees apocalyptic tones mixed into these lines. The end of one day symbolizes the end of them all.\n\nConsider West Side Story, the musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet conceived by Jerome Robbins with the famous score by Leonard Bernstein, book by Arthur Laurents, and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. When we look at the film versions from 1961 and 2021 respectively, we can see where the film directors take the quintet version of the song “Tonight”. The song integrates what has initially been introduced as a musical love theme with darker choruses which reflect Anita’s more mature sexual expectations and the underlying currents of violence anticipating the coming fight between the Sharks and the Jets.\n\nThe 1961 film, directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, opens the song with the striking red sky underscoring the longstanding rage and resentment between the gangs in preparation for the coming war:\n\nIn contrast, the 2021 film version’s opening palette remains cooler, reflecting the combatants’ more general emotional disconnect. The matter of fact way in which the two groups select their arsenals emphasizes chilling calculation over fiery emotion.\n\nIn each case, we know where this is going, just as we know where it goes in the play. And, in a bigger sense, each moment, the scenes from the musical and the soliloquy in the play, reflects a lifelike progression. For when we think about it, life has its own apocalypse in the mix as well–right there in the recipe, blended into the batter before it’s poured into the pan to bake.\n\nIt’s there in Juliet’s language. Speaking of losing her virginity, she talks about losing a winning match. One wins by losing. Love itself includes loss. Initially, love brings the loss of innocence, of self, of childhood, of inexperience–for by joining with and exploring another, we lose part of our inviolable individuality.\n\nIn the long run, of course, one lover invariably loses the other. Whether the loss be to infirmity or death, or to love’s dissolution, we have come to expect life to be like this. In part, human growth is learning forgiveness, learning to walk on after loss.\n\nHere’s “Antilamentation by Dorianne Laux:\n\nRegret nothing. Not the cruel novels you read\n\nto the end just to find out who killed the cook.\n\nNot the insipid movies that made you cry in the dark,\n\nin spite of your intelligence, your sophistication.\n\nNot the lover you left quivering in a hotel parking lot,\n\nthe one you beat to the punchline, the door, or the one\n\nwho left you in your red dress and shoes, the ones\n\nthat crimped your toes, don’t regret those.\n\nNot the nights you called god names and cursed\n\nyour mother, sunk like a dog in the livingroom couch,\n\nchewing your nails and crushed by loneliness.\n\nYou were meant to inhale those smoky nights\n\nover a bottle of flat beer, to sweep stuck onion rings\n\nacross the dirty restaurant floor, to wear the frayed\n\ncoat with its loose buttons, its pockets full of struck matches.\n\nYou’ve walked those streets a thousand times and still\n\nyou end up here. Regret none of it, not one\n\nof the wasted days you wanted to know nothing,\n\nwhen the lights from the carnival rides\n\nwere the only stars you believed in, loving them\n\nfor their uselessness, not wanting to be saved.\n\nYou’ve traveled this far on the back of every mistake,\n\nridden in dark-eyed and morose but calm as a house\n\nafter the TV set has been pitched out the upstairs\n\nwindow. Harmless as a broken ax. Emptied\n\nof expectation. Relax. Don’t bother remembering any of it.\n\nLet’s stop here, under the lit sign\n\non the corner, and watch all the people walk by.\n\nLaux, Dorianne. The Book of Men: Poems. New York: W.W. Norton, 2012.\n\nSaturday night may be full of expectation from the perspective of a Saturday afternoon, but it also ends.\n\nWe have the advantage over Juliet because we know the play. We know that she is at the beginning of what is to be a brief love–a ‘doomed’ love. We know that because of the blood enmity embedded in her family and the social structure of that feud within her home in fair Verona, she will not win this match. Life is already far too weighted against her. In this sense, our alpha is our omega as well–even as the play begins, we know how it ends.\n\nStill, in this moment Juliet is the child with the new gown she cannot yet wear. She waits for night. She awaits a bus, a taxi, a conveyance, without knowing where it might ultimately take her.\n\nThe night which she awaits may bring her peace. She hopes for the peace of connection with her Romeo. Night may bring sleep–perhaps sweet sleep in a lover’s arms. But Hamlet’s pause about death swims up in our minds peripheries. In that sleep what dreams may come?\n\nMercutio gives us a fair idea about what we might expect. Queen Mab runs her tiny carriage about in the night as a kind of inversion of the sun chariot, of Phoebus’ car, and she brings dreams to those whom she encounters. As Mercutio tells Romeo:\n\nMERCUTIO\n\nO, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\n\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\n\nIn shape no bigger than an agate stone\n\nOn the forefinger of an alderman,\n\nDrawn with a team of little atomi\n\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep.\n\nHer wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,\n\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\n\nHer traces of the smallest spider web,\n\nHer collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,\n\nHer whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,\n\nHer wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,\n\nNot half so big as a round little worm\n\nPricked from the lazy finger of a maid.\n\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\n\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\n\nTime out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\n\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\n\nThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\n\nOn courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;\n\nO’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\n\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\n\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues\n\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\n\nSometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\n\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit.\n\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\n\nTickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep;\n\nThen he dreams of another benefice.\n\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\n\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\n\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\n\nOf healths five fathom deep, and then anon\n\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes\n\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\n\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\n\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night\n\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\n\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes.\n\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\n\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\n\nMaking them women of good carriage.\n\nThis is she—\n\nROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.\n\nThou talk’st of nothing.\n\nRomeo and Juliet, 1.4.58-102\n\nAccording to Mercutio, Mab begins with lovers’ brains and dreams of love, but this quickly shifts to dreams of greed and dreams of cutting foreign throats. The alpha of love seems to give birth to other states of being in the speech which moves nimbly from dreamer to dreamer. The process of dreaming carries one across the stream and lands us on the far shore, or perhaps the scorpion nature stings us halfway across.\n\nPerhaps it behooves us to remember that the angel of death is an angel, a minister of endings and not a punisher. Just as the Valkyries arrive to escort fallen warriors to Valhalla, so the angel of death appears to minister to the Christian soul at the moment of its demise. Yet, as Tony Kushner reminds us, the kiss of the angel of death is often red–back to the fiery, but in this case deeper. It can be wine dark, and sometimes one ending seems to lead on to another:\n\nBorne back ceaselessly into the past? Even as we meet another, we meet their end or else our own. Love–that piece of ourselves we give to any other encompasses a kind of death, a vision of an ending certain to arrive eventually in one form or another. The angel of death will not be stayed, whether it comes for another or for ourselves.\n\nJames Joyce knew it, and John Huston’s 1987 film of Joyce’s short story The Dead recognizes it and highlights it in closing. The ephemera we are. The flotsam and jetsam of previous endings drifting inexorably towards our own. Towards all endings. Even as you meet her, or him, or them, the ending is already there. Present, even if unformed, as yet unshaped. Still, it is there.\n\nFiery-footed steeds rolled into a falling snow. The things we carry with us until we no longer can do so. Love. Demons. Dreams. Angels. And our connections. Guilt and affection. All carried like packs on our backs trudging through the snow.\n\nEven when we set others aside, or they set us aside, as sometimes it must be, we carry them on. That old heart and memory refrain. We carry them at sea and on land, flying and trudging, season upon season until our own dark snow begins to fall general over Ireland. Then we finally set them down.\n\nEven as Hamlet laments the horrors his father’s ghost describes, so the prince is already becoming a ghost himself.\n\nHAMLET\n\nIt waves me still.—Go on, I’ll follow thee.\n\nMARCELLUS\n\nYou shall not go, my lord. [They hold back Hamlet.]\n\nHAMLET Hold off your hands.\n\nHORATIO\n\nBe ruled. You shall not go.\n\nHAMLET My fate cries out\n\nAnd makes each petty arture in this body\n\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.\n\nStill am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.\n\nBy heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!\n\nI say, away!—Go on. I’ll follow thee.\n\n[Ghost and Hamlet exit.]\n\nHamlet 1.4.87-96\n\n“My fate cries out.” Hamlet follows the ghost and his following works on several levels. In one sense, he follows the ghost physically, trailing behind the apparition as it leads him to another location. In another sense, he follows the ghost into its own narrative, listening to what it tells him, opening his mind to it, and entertaining a willingness to act on its version of events–to avenge his father’s murder.\n\nIn a third sense, the ghost also leads Hamlet into the spirit realm. Following the ghost is moving towards the ghostly, moving Hamlet closer to becoming a ghost himself. Each step the prince takes in the ghost’s wake leads him further from the world of the flesh, away from the solid world of sentries and castle ramparts, while ushering him deeper into a realm of incorporeal fog.\n\nThis fog may or may not be literal. Although sometimes staged as a foggy night, the dialogue between the two sentries in the opening scene dwells more on the “bitter cold”, heart sickness, and a general apprehension. Identity remains in question, which suggests a kind of fog, and even after the ghost has identified itself to Hamlet as “thy father’s spirit”, doubts remain that the ghost is what it says it is.\n\nAngels and ministers of grace, defend us!\n\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,\n\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from\n\nhell,\n\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\n\nThou com’st in such a questionable shape\n\nThat I will speak to thee.\n\n1.4.43-9.\n\nNotably, the ghost, for all its likeness to Hamlet’s dead father, is not the former king. The ghost says, “I am thy father’s spirit.” There is a subtle distinction in this. The ghost is no longer Hamlet’s father, rather it is something which once was his father.\n\nGHOST: I am thy father’s spirit,\n\nDoomed for a certain term to walk the night\n\nAnd for the day confined to fast in fires\n\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\n\nAre burnt and purged away.\n\n1.5.14-8.\n\nIts state of being has altered, and the ghost is in flux, undergoing a purification by fire. Like Ophelia’s later mentioned baker’s daughter, Hamlet’s father has ceased to be in a former state, and is undergoing a sea change in a sea of fire.* As Ophelia later affirms, “Lord, we know what we are but know not what we may be.” 4.5.48-9. Life remains ever changing. As Ophelia reminds us again in her mad flower ramblings. “I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end.” 4.5.207-9.\n\nPoor ghost, or is it the poor remaining daughters, sons, partners, friends whom we should pity.\n\nThis ghost writer has written elsewhere about ghosts, how they can be echoes, especially in Shakespeare. They are characters who ‘were’, and ghosts exist as reminders of the past. Spectral Banquo still appears at the banquet from which his murder, arranged by his erstwhile friend, Macbeth, had prevented his attendance. The dead Julius Caesar visits Brutus on the night before his defeat at Philippi. Similarly, on the night before his decisive battle at Bosworth field, Richard III is visited by a host of phantoms of his victims–Prince Edward, Henry VI, Clarence, Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan all tell Richard that they will sit heavy on his soul.\n\nIn character terms, ghosts may mark the weight of memory, guilt, of previous transgressions returning to visit the living. Ghosts also indicate moments where things have gone awry in the world of the play’s past, and in terms of dramatic mechanism, they represent pivotal moments in the plot–moments when characters, circumstances, or fate change direction.\n\nIn Hamlet’s case, his father’s ghost sets him on a course which ultimately will lead not only to his uncle’s death, but also (either directly or indirectly) to the deaths of multiple other characters as his vengeance cuts an especially wide swath. Not only Hamlet and Claudius, but Hamlet’s revenge also encompasses Polonius, Ophelia, Gertrude, and Laertes as collateral damage. Not uncommon in early modern revenge tragedies, the mounting deaths can present a challenge to directors. What does one do with the large number of bodies covering the stage at the end of the play?\n\nThese corpses are revenants too, visual reminders of death for the audience, even as the final restoration of order takes place in the play’s world. , The profound discord of vengeance lingers, even after someone new takes command. Ghosts seem a bit like the “shine” as Halloran (played by Scatman Crothers) explains to Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) in Stanley Kubrick’s film version of Stephen King’s The Shining:\n\nIn this film, the ghosts range from creepy to terrifying. Still, in both The Shining and in Hamlet, the most frightening ghosts may be found in characters’ minds.\n\nOnce Hamlet encounters his father’s ghost, he climbs a metaphorical stile in the fence between the living and the dead. He enters the kissing gate between two different fields of existence–being and been. In this spot, weeds grow highest at the margin of the field and the space beyond the fence gives way to deeper woods.\n\nWhen the spirit directs him to avenge his father’s murder, Hamlet lends the ghost a surrogate physical presence. With the spirit representing a will towards resolution, Hamlet serves as the ghost’s extension by becoming the ghost’s agent in the world of the living. Hamlet also becomes a bridge between the afterlife and his own. He becomes the ghost’s earthly mind and hands. Hamlet begins to serve as a bridge between living and dead, between the world of the play, and the world beyond it.\n\nSuch bridges may function on multiple levels. Like the bridge above, they may connect the mortal world with a fairy land outside of it, but they may also signify a connection between the play and the audience, and the action of the play and its aftermath.\n\nThere are all sorts of boundaries, borders, connections. In the same sense that life leads on to an inevitable end, so one place leads on to another. Boundaries may also be seen as gateways.\n\nStiles, bridges, gateways–these may all be physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or any combination of these. Transition, change, is constant and unlimited. It may be gradual or precipitous, and each life tends to be full of gradients from across the spectrum. Places go through their own transitions as well, often serving as reminders of and connections to a vanished past.\n\nEven houses of worship may become relics. Remnants of changing patterns of faith and conflict. Marks of the ongoing political struggle inherent in human belief and its place in the world, or between the worlds of gods and those of humankind.\n\nSometimes, we see those gods’ worlds as humankind conceived them–all stone arches and lofty pinnacles. Reaching. Reaching for something they cannot truly touch (except perhaps within the human heart. Ask William Boyd, or better yet, read the novel).\n\nWhilst offering windows into human pasts, the ancient hallmarks of belief may also extend glimpses of other worlds.\n\nFrom our human perspective, it may all seem connected, all part of a greater circle. We do stand in a circle.\n\nIn my beginning is my end. In succession\n\nHouses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,\n\nAre removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place\n\nIs an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.\n\nOld stone to new building, old timber to new fires,\n\nOld fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth\n\nWhich is already flesh, fur and faeces,\n\nBone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.\n\nHouses live and die: there is a time for building\n\nAnd a time for living and for generation\n\nAnd a time for the wind to break the loosened pane\n\nAnd to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots\n\nAnd to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.\n\nIn my beginning is my end. Now the light falls\n\nAcross the open field, leaving the deep lane\n\nShuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,\n\nWhere you lean against a bank while a van passes,\n\nAnd the deep lane insists on the direction\n\nInto the village, in the electric heat\n\nHypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light\n\nIs absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.\n\nThe dahlias sleep in the empty silence.\n\nWait for the early owl.\n\nFrom T.S. Eliot Four Quartets 2: East Coker\n\nThe alpha and the omega any one? Although death coils intimately within life and being, Hamlet seems to cross a line when he chooses to follow it deliberately. Whereas our usual ways of reck oning, of gazing acr oss the fence, may afford a relatively safe kind of thanatopsis (not that anyone reads William Cullen Bryant so much these days), Hamlet defies anyone to stop him from following–offering to make a ghost of anyone who prevents him from climbing the stile and crossing the fence into the next field.\n\nStill, danger is always with us. Death surrounds us like the proverbial lover’s embrace, only closer. In our mating lies the hinge to the door of our senescence. Those ever renewable, quickly healing bodies of our youth seem to decline so quickly after puberty. Carlos Castañeda’s fictionalized Yaqui wise man Don Juan Matus might describe death as a friend who lurks ever at our left shoulder, but it all seems even much more intimate than that.\n\nS ome places seem m ore likely t o hasten our gh osth o od. We all kn ow dangerous places, albeit these may be changeable. A road at night. A path through the Carpathian Alps (again at night). A secret government facility (perhaps, but n ot necessarily, at night). A laboratory where someone tests the boundaries of existence or reality as we know it. Any place in eastern Ukraine this week. Still, for all that, it sometimes seems as if in our collective mythology, the m ost danger ous place in the world might be a small t own.\n\nBritish small t owns–we all d one seen ’em on the teevee–may have only a few h ouses and a sh op. Perhaps a nearby university extension or an art museum. S ome small towns may have neur odivergent physicians or kn owing p ostpersons. Often, there are schools, town halls, amateur theatrical productions. Yet even as small as these places are, pe ople seem to die there at an alarming rate. Worse, people are murdered!!\n\nLet’s face it, in places like the Shetlands, the Midsomer, and other similar small remote locations across the United Kingdom, beleaguered detectives and their faithful sidekicks wade endlessly thr ough pers onal quagmires of simmering resentment and sm oldering, s ometimes unrequited passi ons. Shocking murders seem to happen in such places on a weekly basis! And don’t tell me that this is just television, that the ideas are merely fabricated.\n\nJust as bad might be the small t own in the United States, where perhaps a stranger fr om out of t own is always stumbling acr oss s omething much bigger than the small t own or its narr ow minded p olice chief can handle. Unless the p olice chief is the one wh o, having only recently taken up the p ost, begins t o see just h ow “wr ong” everything is. Only a few ears may be trustw orthy. Otherwise, the wh ole thing is lies. Lies, I tell you. And only one person might set it right.\n\nAs Johnny ‘Rooster’ Byron says:\n\nSchool is a lie. Prison’s a waste of time. Girls are wondrous. Grab your fill. No man was ever lain in his barrow wishing he’d loved one less woman. Don’t listen to no one and nothing but what your own heart bides. Lie. Cheat. Steal. Fight to the death. Don’t give up.\n\nJerusalem, by Jez Butterworth, Act 3.\n\nNo sirree, Bob. Not for me. Not even the Christmas specials on the teevee can stop the killing in those small towns.\n\nMight be safer to live in a city. But then one had better not look out the window too much. Might see something bad. And commuter trains? Forget it. Might be better just to stay inside and keep the blinds drawn.\n\nIn polite social discourse, Hamlet, Ophelia, and Laertes might all be said to be so young–too young to be visited by death. And although we all know there really is no age limit (upper or lower) on death, it still seems significant that Hamlet follows his father’s ghost. This seems to set him on a track to all things ghostly. Murder and haunting and all things foul be they physical or not. In some sense it is almost as if Hamlet’s subsequent entanglement also entangles everyone around him, and they all go traipsing down skull and crossbones lane together.\n\nOh, sure. Claudius is already on it. He’s so riddled with guilt (rotted with guilt, rutting in guilt) that it seems as though he’s almost waiting for the avenging angel to show up and smite him. (See how I worked the word smite in there? Great word. Sh ould be used much m ore frequently than it is.) As s o on as Hamlet steps on the gh ost r oad th ough, all the y ounger generati on either f oll ow al ong or are dragged ont o the track.\n\nIn a larger sense, we are all on this path, of c ourse–all following either late or soon. We are all becoming ghosts. Yet there seems to be some degree of elasticity about when we step int o the shade. In most of our lives, some matter of degree remains. We may walk by the river, but we need not necessarily approach the gravestones.\n\nThis elasticity, this p otential f or temp oral electi on, does not deny the inevitability of death, but for many people it does introduce s ome element of choice. We still follow the course into darkness, but we have at least an illusi on of delaying that. N ot that, Hamlet’s father, Old Hamlet, was given any ch oice. The ghost tells Hamlet:\n\nSleeping within my orchard,\n\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\n\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\n\nWith juice of cursèd hebona in a vial\n\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\n\nThe leprous distilment, whose effect\n\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\n\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\n\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\n\nAnd with a sudden vigor it doth posset\n\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\n\nThe thin and wholesome blood.\n\nHamlet 1.5.66-77\n\nOf course, no one in Denmark knows the real truth–no one except the murderer (Claudius), the ghost (Old Hamlet), and now Prince Hamlet as well. As the ghost says:\n\n’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\n\nA serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\n\nIs by a forgèd process of my death\n\nRankly abused.\n\nPerhaps Denmark needs a good detective, but that’s not the way early modern playwrights usually did things, is it? Why have a detective when you can have an avenger instead? No, not the superheroes necessarily. We still have modern vengeance films galore, and although they may not all be typical westerns, they still are.\n\nNaturally, we aren’t all avengers. We aren’t all gunslingers, sword wielders. Very few of us are ex-servicemen with outrage ous sleuthing and tactical skills and seemingly limitless supplies of cash, strength, and stamina. Yet, we all approach the river boats of night inexorably.\n\nEventually, we climb on board, even if the nature of the ensuing journey remains a matter of doubt and a subject of debate.\n\nO dark dark dark. They all go into the dark,\n\nThe vacant interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,\n\nThe captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,\n\nThe generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,\n\nDistinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,\n\nIndustrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark\n\nIbid\n\nNaturally, life remains a journey as well, with a whole catalogue of trials and concerns before we board the final boats.\n\nYet, there are also as many ways to become a ghost here without even touching a boat. Staying lost for any reason, neurodivergence, atypical emotional engagement, or a host of ‘misfitisms’ may leave one internally howling at on the edge of the gutter, where one may wander like a spirit all of one’s days.\n\nLast stage of all (strange eventful history indeed–or is it eventless in a larger sense?), perhaps, one may move to one of those suburban neighbourhoods. You know them. Soulless, post modern architecture, living with the ongoing conversations of mostly weather. Lots of it. More every day. There, one may subsist as a shadow in the aesthetically, intellectually, and emotionally landscape forever. At least until that final boat finally arrives.\n\nIt may be love which never arrives. Something which never reaches fruition. The fruit tree dies in its sapling state instead. The love which we thought might be meant nothing in the end. Perhaps our only real consolation is coffee.\n\nSo many ways to become a ghost, or perhaps to see the ghost change happening. We look up at the sky and as in Clarke’s story, all the stars start going out one by one.\n\nMaybe we are swept out t o sea. But we d on’t actually mind. At least n ot like we th ought we w ould. Maybe that truly is our purpose. Just a catalog, a filing system.\n\nFor all of it, maybe becoming a ghost is usually much more accidental than Hamlet’s intentions. For without intention, where are we? Illinois? Nebraska? What would the Wizard of Omaha say?\n\nMaybe we just remain too late. We linger when the carnival is closing down. We see the tired carneys removing blocks and sandbags, taking down the lights. Maybe it isn’t the stars going out. Maybe it is just bits of neon going dark. Much as we might long to ride the sky swing to the heavens, we may only arrive after the last ride has left.\n\nFor once the lights begin to go out, we may not really reach the sky after all. We may only have a ‘Sy Swig’, which may not taste at all like we thought. Perhaps we should have gone with a Guinness, or a real ale somewhere. Maybe that ride with all the sporting logos on it, or another sandwich.\n\nNo matter what it is in the end. We eventually reach the boats. Even Kane Tanaka reached the boats. And they are always waiting for us. Day and night. Year in, year out.\n\nMaybe, with the world so threatened these days, Hamlet’s course does not seem so far afield. Perhaps we should focus on righting the wrongs done to us. Perhaps the course of vengeance might help to focus our being. In some cases, it must:\n\nThe revenge which may drive us through life may take many forms.\n\nOh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale!\n\nMelville, Herman, introduction by Viola Meynell. Moby Dick or the Whale. New York: Avenel Books, 1985, 581.\n\n“Go on, I’ll follow thee”, Hamlet says to the ghost. Ahab shouts, “. . .let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale!”**\n\nWe all follow something, even if what we f oll ow is a wish for peace. We yearn for resolution. A quiet, comfortable place. A home. A good book. A lover’s arms. Satisfaction of some kind–intellectual, emotional, physical. Somehow our passions come to rest. The owl hoots softly, but not urgently. Winters mild but summers not rendering us a howling inferno.\n\nWe would prefer not to howl. Not to have to howl unless we want to. Those dogs do that m ore than enough deep in the night. And the butterflies. H owling silently. Y ou may have heard them with out kn owing. Ghastly.\n\nWhen we d o wake fr om the butterfly’s dream of being human, where will we find ourselves buried?\n\nIn a church?\n\nAl ong a distant r oad at the edge of s ome lake c ountry?\n\nIn a seld om used chapel?\n\nThe questi on is, once we’ve d one ( or n ot d one) whatever the gh osts of our vari ous pasts have demanded, will they think of us? Remember us? Will angels pray f or us?\n\nBec oming a gh ost is a natural pr ocess which may happen faster or sl ower, depending on what we ch o ose. Will we fade in the artless milieu of the m odern w orld, eating our own tails like a f org otten mythic serpent, spitting ven om t o kill the thunder g od. Is that only in c omic b o oks? Will we climb the belfry when we realize our betrayal, or will we just stay at the table f or an other hand at hearts?\n\nWill we speak? Will we stay silent? Hear the din of racing c ombusti on engines, leaf bl owers, m owers, and oversized SUVs and pickups murdering our unb orn children. Will we l o ok at m onuments, angels or garg oyles, and wish that we were st one like them?\n\n*A 1948 song by Sonny Burke with words by Paul Francis Webster. Memorably recorded by Sarah Vaughan, Peggy Lee, and Ella Fitzgerald. This ghost suggests that it is worthwhile to listen to each of these versions, and all the others. K. D. Lang did a version with Grover Washington Jr. It’s on Youtube as well, and it’s fantastic.\n\n**For more about whales and Hamlet, including parallels with the biblical Jonah, please see the essays of my friend, Paul Adrien Fried, who has done a great deal of work on biblical references and allusions in Hamlet:\n\nhttps://pauladrianfried.blogspot.com/2022/04/hamlets-sea-voyage-christ-in-tomb-and.html\n\nTribes.
