        "text": "Chicago – In making a Chicago appearance at the Gabby Awards, which honored prominent Greek Americans, actress Nia Vardalos justifiably follows through on the heritage displayed in her hit “My Big Fat Greek Wedding.”\n\nHollywoodChicago.com was on the Red Carpet at the event, and got to briefly interact with vivacious Ms. V, who also was promoting her current film, “My Life in Ruins” with her co-star Alexis Georgoulis.\n\nNia Vardalos at the Gabby Awards, Chicago, June 19, 2009.\n\nPhoto credit: Joe Arce of Starstruck Foto for HollywoodChicago.com\n\nHollywoodChicago.com: You are one of the notable graduates from Chicago’s Second City troupe. What lesson or lessons from those years has sustained you in your career?\n\nNia Vardalos: There is no crying in comedy (laughs). You’ve got to be tough, and the Windy City sure teaches you that when that wind takes you, push back.\n\nNia Vardalos on the Red Carpet at the Gabby Awards,...\n\nActress Nia Vardalos has fired off at Hollywood executives who greenlight film romances featuring \"fat\" Russell Crowe and Seth Rogen and then poke fun at her for finding love with hunks on the big screen.\n\nThe My Big Fat Greek Wedding star is tired of Tinseltown's double standards when it comes to pairing up stars for movie love stories - because older women can't get away with dating hunks, while ageing actors regularly romance hotties.\n\nAnd she's had enough of the questions about her own onscreen match-ups with the likes of John Corbett and My Life In Ruins co-star Alexis Georgoulis.\n\nShe tells CNN, \"On the publicity tour of My Big Fat Greek Wedding I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my below average looks, hook up with hottie John Corbett.\n\n\"I thought I was attractive when I shot My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them. In other words, they labelled me with words like, overweight, unattractive, unappealing. Hey, just say fat. I love the word fat. I used it in the title. It’s actually not a naughty word.\n\n\"I have sat through many a movie like Sideways, where nobody blinks an eye when Paul Giamatti gets together with gorgeous Virginia Madsen, and Knocked Up. I mean the visual of Seth Rogen on top of Katherine Heigl made me put the popcorn down and reach for my purse... because I knew the film was about to stop and Ashton Kutcher would now jump out and go, 'Aha, you’ve been punked.' I waited, but no Ashton.\n\n\"Socially, the issue of men’s weight is simply not a big deal. Let’s face it, Russell Crowe is fat and no one ever talks about it. Alec Baldwin just orders his suits a size bigger and we continue to swoon.\n\n\"Meanwhile, I get hit with this awkward question about my weightloss daily and I have answered it in press interviews, at the grocery store, at the newspaper stand. Why? Because I see their (people) anxious, open faces needing the secret, the new pill, the cure, anything: 'Just please share the secret'. So I hesitantly answer and I am always met with the same response: the glaze-eye, slack-jawed face.\n\n\"They don’t want to hear the truth - I had a blood sugar problem, so my doctor ordered me to lose weight. It was really hard but I did it through diet and exercise, and it took a year.\"...\n\nWelcome to another hung-over edition of the Reject Report and the big question is who will have the box-office hangover this weekend -- The Hangover, or Will Ferrell? Or will Up finally come down to earth? You know, it could well be another Up weekend from the looks of it, because a lot of people are trashing Ferrell's latest movie, Land of the Lost, and suggesting Ferrell's career is hitting the skids. But who knows, really. This is one of those strange weekends where any number of scenarios could play out, and the mystery over how Land of the Lost will do is contributing to that. There are actually three new releases this weekend, and I'll start off with the non-contender of the whole bunch, My Life in Ruins. This is a romantic comedy film set among the ruins of ancient Greece starring Nia Vardalos of My Big Fat Greek Wedding fame, and...\n\nKefi, a main theme in the film, is the Greek word for mojo. Unfortunately for My Life In Ruins, that’s one of the many things it lacks. The story centers on Georgia (Nia Vardalos) who lost her ‘kefi’ and is in a miserable job as a Greek tour guide as she tries to find the mojo, or possibly love, along the way. Seeing the trailers, I already came into the theaters with the implications that it would be a fairly more lighthearted Under the Tuscan Sun but with a lot more Greek mixed into it. Instead it turned out to be a mediocre story with barely likeable characters and will want you to tell this movie to keep on looking for its kefi, it didn’t find it yet.\n\nAnyone find my kefi? I think it slipped under a seat in here.\n\nYes, Nia Vardalos is a fine actress,...\n\nChicago – When Nia Vardalos, the bride in “My Big Fat Greek Wedding”, went to Greece to film her new release – “My Life in Ruins” – she also had to find a hunky Greek co-star. Enter Alexis Georgoulis, in his American film debut.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 An unknown who had done obscure Greek films and TV shows, Georgoulis is embracing and absorbing his lucky break.\n\nIn the opening week anticipation of My Life in Ruins, Georgoulis sat down and talked with HollywoodChicago.com.\n\n“For me it was like a god came down to earth and said, ‘Would you like to do this?’” he recalled, laughing.\n\n“I was giving a performance in a theater, and afterward a Greek casting director came to see me and asked me if I’d like to audition for an American movie,” he added. “I said why not, but in what language? He said English of course. Okay, I thought to myself,...\n\nA preview to romantic comedy \"My Life in Ruins\" has been shared through the film's trailer. Courtesy of Moviefone, the video footage takes its focus on Georgia and her adventure as a tour guide in Greece that helps her to learn how to let lose and find love where she least expects.\n\nA romantic comedy from Fox Searchlight Pictures, \"My Life in Ruins\" follows Georgia, a Greek-American tour guide who leads a band of misfit tourists around Greece. Facing a clash of personalities and cultures, everything she has planned goes on the wrong way. That is until she meets Irv Gordon, a tourist who takes her on a personal detour and opens her eyes to a possibility of love which she finds on the last person she would expect, her Greek bus driver.\n\nDirected by Donald Petrie, the comical film which script is written by Mike Reiss sees \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding..."
