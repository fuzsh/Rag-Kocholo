(1996)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Dawn Patrol (2014)\n\nBirthday: Oct 26, 1956\n\nBirthplace: Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nThough Rita Wilson began her career as an actress in films like \"Volunteers\" (1985), \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"Runaway Bride\" (1999), she found her greatest success as the producer of two highly successful films, the comedy \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" (2002) and the musical \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008), which broke box office records around the globe. Though a skilled performer with a talent for light comedy, Wilson never quite found her star vehicle as an actress, but after her marriage to occasional co-star Tom Hanks, she began exploring production properties through his company, Playtone. With two major hits to her credit, Wilson proved herself to be a shrewd predictor of audience tastes, and one of the most accomplished independent producers of the new millennium.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n93% That Thing You Do! 92% Kimi 90% Gloria Bell\n\n88% If These Walls Could Talk\n\n85% A Simple Wedding 75% Sleepless in Seattle\n\n72% Auto Focus\n\n59% It's Complicated\n\nPhotos\n\nRita Wilson at arrivals for UNTRACEABLE World Premiere, Silver Screen Theater at the Pacific Design Center, Los Angeles, CA, January 22, 2008.
