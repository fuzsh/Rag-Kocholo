        "text": "The Zocalo Today\n\nWelcome and thank you for dropping by. Babylon 5 brought many of us together -- and it remains with us, despite the fact that is no longer in production. The good thing is that the internet provides a LOT of ways to stay in touch. Don't be shy. Join in the discussion today. You can also find plenty of Babylon 5 fans on FaceBook and Twitter eager to talk about their show, Babylon 5.\n\nIf you have questions or items for the news, drop me a line at sgbruckner@aol.com.\n\nAgain, WELCOME!\n\nMONTHLY HIGHLIGHTS OF ISN NEWS: THE ZOCALO TODAY\n\nDECEMBER NEWS\n\nWEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 31, 2014\n\nREMEMBERING THOSE LOST THIS YEAR\n\nThe end of the year is always a bittersweet time, because while we have a lot of fun taking stock of everything cool that happened over the last 12 months -- the new movies, the new toys, the breakout stars and more -- we also have to look back at what we lost, namely the creators who've brought us so much joy. Every loss is hard, but 2014 was a particularly rough year of departures for genre fans. We lost some of our heroes very suddenly and shockingly, and we lost others in old age, but they seemed invincible to us. However we lost them, there's no denying we had to say hard goodbyes to some giants this year.\n\nOf course, the point of this brief remembrance of the genre icons who left us in 2014 isn't to mourn, but to celebrate the great work they left behind, work we'll keep enjoying for many, many years to come. As we remember the films, the games, the art they gave us, they're all immortals.\n\nMOST ANTICIPATED FILMS OF 2015\n\nIt seems mainstream movie audiences crave their sci-fi and superhero movies almost as much as we do.\n\nIn a survey taken by leading online movie ticket retailer Fandango, four of the five most eagerly awaited films of 2015 come from one of those genres. The most heavily anticipated movie of next year? I doubt you'll be surprised when I tell you it's Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nThe full top five are:\n\n1. Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\n2. The Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\n3. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2\n\n4. 50 Shades of Grey\n\n5. Jurassic World\n\n50 Shades of Grey (which sort of has a genre connection itself, since it originally started as erotic Twilight fan fiction) is the one glaring exception, and as Collider notes, it would be interesting to see how the poll broke down demographically -- it's not too much of a stretch to say, for instance, that not a whole lot of men are breathlessly awaiting that movie.\n\nElsewhere, Avengers leader Robert Downey Jr. and Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence are rated the top male and female \"fan favorites\" returning to the screen in 2015, while Star Wars newbies John Boyega and Daisy Ridley made their respective \"breakout\" lists.\n\nWhile the movie picks are not exactly a surprise, it does tell us that sci-fi and its associated genres are bigger than ever going into 2015 -- which is great news going into the New Year.\n\nAGENT CARTER\n\nPeople has a new behind-the-scenes look at the ABC series âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ in which we get to see Hayley Atwellâs title spy in action as well as a visit from her old war buddy Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper)\n\n. Starring Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter, Chad Michael Murray as SSR Agent Jack Thompson, Enver Gjokaj as SSR Agent Daniel Sousa, James DâArcy as Edwin Jarvis, and Shea Whigham as SSR Chief Roger Dooley, âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ was written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Executive producers are Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Chris Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis DâEsposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee and Jeph Loeb.\n\nâMarvelâs Agent Carterâ is produced by ABC Studios and Marvel Television and is set to premiere January 6, 2015 on ABC.\n\nAVENGERS NOW\n\nEven before the most recent Marvel Comics event, âAxisâ, wrapped up, the Avengers NOW! Initiative was already well underway. With exciting new titles like âAll-New Captain Americaâ featuring Sam Wilson as the new Star-Spangled Avenger, âThorâ starring the mysterious Goddess of Thunder, and âAngela: Asgardâs Assassinâ written by Kieron Gillen and Marguerite Bennett the landscape of the Marvel Universe is quickly changing. However, there is still more in store from the House of Ideas in the New Year and the company has just released a trailer to highlight some of the upcoming new additions to your local comic book shops.\n\nIn anticipation for the release of new books like Mark Waid and Carlos Pachecoâs âS.H.I.E.L.D.â, Ryan North and Erica Hendersonâs âUnbeatable Squirrel Girlâ, a new volume of Rick Remenderâs âUncanny Avengersâ, and many more, Marvel shared a new trailer spotlighting some brand new series debuting in the coming months featuring Earthâs Mightiest Heroes.

But how could I resist a comic starring Squirrel Girl?! Anyway, which upcoming Avengers NOW! series are you most looking forward to? Let us know in the comment section.\n\nCONSTANTINE\n\nIn a move that fans will hopefully see as a promise for the future, NBC has moved its embattled DC Comics show âConstantineâ from the 10pm time slot on Fridays to the earlier 8pm time slot, as well as announcing the show will return on January 16th to finish the last 5 episodes of its first season. But will it be its only season?\n\nMoving the show to the 8 oâclock slot shows some confidence on the part of the network, although it might also be a last ditch effort to see if fans will really show up to support the show. With only 5 episodes remaining, it could also just be airing to burn off the episodes and keep the slot warm until NBC gets another show ready for the Spring season. Only time will tell, but the good news is that although production on the first season was stopped at only 13 episodes, NBC has still not officially canceled the show, and with its rating upswing, there is a good chance we might still see a âConstantineâ Season 2.\n\nFor now, check out âConstantineâ when it returns for its final 5 episodes on January 16th, in its new time slot at 8pm!\n\nConstantine - New Set of Cast Promotional PhotosâBased on the wildly popular comic book series âHellblazerâ from DC Comics, seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine specializes in giving hellâ¦ hell. Armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and his wickedly naughty wit, he fights the good fight â or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, heâs decided to leave his do-gooder life behind, but when demons target Liv (Lucy Griffiths), the daughter of one of Constantineâs oldest friends, heâs reluctantly thrust back into the fray â and heâll do whatever it takes to save her. Before long, itâs revealed that Livâs âsecond sightâ â an ability to see the worlds behind our world and predict supernatural occurrences â is a threat to a mysterious new evil thatâs rising in the shadows. Now itâs not just Liv who needs protection; the angels are starting to get worried too. So, together, Constantine and Liv must use her power and his skills to travel the country, find the demons that threaten our world and send them back where they belong. After that, who knowsâ¦ maybe thereâs hope for him and his soul after all. â\n\nDECEMBER 30, 2014\n\nDAREDEVIL\n\nMarvel TV head Jeph Loeb and showrunner Steven S. DeKnight opened up to Entertainment Weekly about the 13-episode Daredevil series and how it connects to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while also dropping some intel on how theyâll be adapting some of the comicâs iconic baddies.\n\nFirst up, Loeb reiterated that the series will definitely take place in the same world at The Avengers â just donât expect to see Iron Man or Thor zipping around in Hellâs Kitchen. This is definitely going to be a hyper-focused series, telling the story of a street-level hero tackling street-level problems. Thatâs something Marvel hasnât attempted up to this point, and weâre curious to see if they can pull it off:\n\nâWithin the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but The Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood. Itâs a very unique look at Hellâs Kitchen in New York, where Matt Murdoch grew up and continues to defend it from people who would harm the people that live there â¦ It does take place in the Marvel cinematic universe. Itâs all connected. But that doesnât necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [Iron Man]. Itâs just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies.â\n\nThough DeKnight made a name for himself with the pay-cable violence and nudity of Spartacus on Starz, he said this series wonât go quite that far into the dark. It will be âgrittier and edgierâ than anything thatâs come before in Marvelâs stable, but he argued the story doesnât require that level of gratuity to be told well.\n\nOne big part of that story, arguably just as big as Charlie Coxâs Matt Murdock? Vincent Dâonofrioâs portrayal of Wilson Fisk, aka the Kingpin. According to DeKnight, theyâre looking to bring some depth and new angles to the story of Fiskâs evolution into the Kingpin of crime. Instead of a black-and-white villain, theyâre going to essentially tell the human side of his story that drives him to evil.\n\nThe question of Bullseye also came up, and DeKnight made sure to leave the door open for one of Daredevilâs biggest rogues to show up in the second season â just donât expect him in the first 13 episodes. Basically, they wanted to tell the story of Daredevil and the Kingpin first, and they worried Bullseye would get in the way of those stories:\n\nâFisk has very many different aspects so itâs not all, âI want to conquer the city and make a lot of money.â In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love â our antagonist actually has a love story. Thatâs the love story youâre following, the one youâre invested in, and seeing how that affects him and changes him. I think Vincent just brings such depth to it, his performance is just astounding.â\n\nI wouldnât say thereâs no plans to include [Bullseyeâ in the series. Itâs not not to say he wouldnât be in the series at some point. But I think if you try to jam in too many characters, it just becomes a mess. And [Bullseyeâs] story was told in the last iteration of Daredevil that anybody saw. My feeling was, âWhy repeat it?â And honestly, if youâre looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist. Bullseye is a little more cut and dry. Not to say you couldnât make him fantastic over 13 hours, but Fisk really felt like the right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season.â\n\nThe Daredevil series is set to hit Netflix at some point in 2015, probably around the second quarter of the year.\n\nSTAR WARS REBELS\n\nA couple weeks ago, we told you the cool news that Frank Oz would reprise his vocal role as Yoda in an upcoming chapter of Star Wars Rebels when it returned from winter break. While not exactly sure what incarnation the little green guy would take, we now have a clip from next week's \"Path of the Jedi,\" with Yoda expounding his pure words of wisdom to Kanan as a disembodied voice from the sweltering swamps of Dagobah, where he's been in exile since Revenge of the Sith. Hearing Frank Oz's distinctive Yoda and its disjointed sentence structure gives us the geeky chills.\n\nStar Wars Rebels \"Path of the Jedi\" airs Jan. 5, 2015, at 9/8 CT on Disney XD.\n\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 25, 2014\n\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS TO EVERYONE\n\nI am taking some time off for the holidays. I hope all of your have an awesome holiday full of friends and family.\n\nDOCTOR WHO\n\nSomething happens in this year's Doctor Who Christmas special that has never happened before, promises executive producer Steven Moffat. On Peter Capaldi's (and the Twelfth Doctor's) first Christmas special we get to meet Santa in what might be the most Christmassy episode ever as Santa joins the Doctor and Clara to fight off terrifying creatures at an arctic base at the North Pole. \"Last Christmas\" which airs Christmas Day, Dec. 25, at 9 p.m. ET on BBC America.\n\nSeveral months have passed since the Doctor and Clara parted ways in the dark finale, said Moffat during a conference call with journalists. âUnless I'm lying,â joked Moffat regarding how much time passes between the finale and the Christmas special.\n\nâI do think a Christmas special should be Christmassy. I think thereâs no point in trying to pretend an ordinary episode would pass muster on Christmas Day. It wouldnât,â he said.\n\nRegarding \"Last Christmas,\" we know that Clara and the Doctor once again join forces, despite saying goodbye in the season finale. We also know that there will be monsters, Santa, elves and at least one reindeer as Santa rides to the Doctor's rescue ... literally. Actor Nick Frost plays Santa, and Dan Starkey (who also plays Strax on the series) and Nathan McMullen guest-star as elves. And Michael Troughton, the son of Second Doctor Patrick Troughton, guest-stars.\n\nSo why did it take so long for Santa to pop up on Doctor Who? âThe simple dull answer is that it took me this long to think of it. And so, no big deal. I think itâs oh so true that now that this is Doctor Whoâs 10th year at the heart of the Christmas schedule, heâs now earned the right to go toe to toe with Santa, you know? It feels about right,â said Moffat.\n\nâItâs one of those ideas that when you have it ... for goodness' sake, why has it not happened before now? Why havenât we seen them in a buddy movie together before now? They belong together. And itâs something in the hearts, Iâm sure, of the younger part of our audience, Doctor Who and Santa Claus live -- and Robin Hood -- all very much live in the same place,â he said.\n\nâSo itâs irresistible once youâve thought of it. And also because of the format of the show we can contrive anything to happen. So here we are,â said Moffat.\n\nAs far as the Robin Hood and Santa of it all, the Doctor âhas a different relationship with Santa Claus, letâs be clear. In a line cut from the Robin Hood episode which I rather regret now, he -- the Doctor -- while dismissing the existence of Robin Hood absolutely asserts that Santa is real,â he said.\n\nâWe know the Doctor has a sort of conviction about Santa. Heâs mentioned him several times. So itâs a different thing. His conflict with Robin Hood was more externalizing his post-Trenzalore angst about whether he really counts as a hero or not. So some of the transaction is, and letâs be honest, [the] Doctor doesnât really like it, does he, when a dashing handsome young man turns up. And the girl at his side is a bit more impressed with the new hero than the old one. He didnât like it when Captain Jack turned up. He didnât like it when Robin Hood turned up. What middle-aged man wants that kind of competition?â said Moffat.\n\nRegarding \"Last Christmas,â it will have a decidedly lighter tone than the finale. âItâs Doctor Who storytelling at its most primal. If you do something incredibly dark where another show would just have another episode of sad music and rain, you just spin it right around and do something outrageous.\n\nâThatâs the show biz of Doctor Who somehow .... When Santa walks onto the TARDIS itâs kind of -- I like that sort of moment, because it feels like, did you forget you were watching Doctor Who? You know, itâs not really Chekhov. We are having fun here,â he said.\n\n\"So donât worry, Santa will sort everything. That makes it Doctor Who again. Up until that point, just as youâre bottoming out and thinking this is as dark as it gets. Then all your childhood dreams come true and Father Christmas enters the TARDIS.â\n\nSTAR TREK 3\n\nThings are now starting to move quickly for Star Trek 3.\n\nJust one day after Justin Lin was officially announced as the film's director -- taking over for the departed Roberto Orci -- Paramount Pictures has set July 8, 2016 as the movie's release date. That's less than two years from now, which means Lin has his work cut out for him with what will presumably be an effects-and-action-heavy motion picture.\n\nWith that narrow a window to get a movie of this size up and running, I have to wonder if the studio is just going to stick with the screenplay that Orci and two other writers were working on -- the one that allegedly involved some sort of time travel device that would allow a young Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) to come face to face with the older one (William Shatner) for the first time. Or it might be getting a rewrite as we speak to feel more like Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nHow that all shakes out remains to be seen, but don't expect Paramount to budge from that date: July 8 is just two months shy of Star Trek's official 50th anniversary, as September 8, 1966 is when the original show's premiere episode, \"The Man Trap,\" first aired on NBC.\n\nONCE UPON A TIME\n\nABCâs real-life fairytale series Once Upon A Time is bringing in a legit genre alum to take on the role of a new major player in the back half of season four.\n\nSebastian Roche (Fringe, Supernatural) has signed on to guest-star as King Stefan, Auroraâs father, who has a âcomplicated pastâ with Maleficent (Kristin Bauer Van Straten). We donât know much else about his role, but this being Roche, youâd almost have to assume heâs playing a shady role. Our money would be on him turning out to be a villain, somehow. Heck, when was the last time he played a good guy? Odyssey 5?\n\nRocheâs face should be a familiar one for sci-fi fans across the spectrum. He previously played Thomas Jerome Newton on an eight-episode stint on Fringe, and showed up in six episodes of Supernatural as Balthazar. He most recently played Mikael on The Vampire Diaries and The Originals.\n\nRoche is set for an extended guest star role, though we donât know the exact episode count. His first appearance is scheduled for an episode slated to air in March.\n\nAGENT CARTER\n\nSure, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. might be on hiatus for a few months, but Agent Carter is ready to step in to fill the Marvel void on ABCâs schedule.\n\nThe seven-episode prequel series debuts Jan. 6 with a two-hour premiere and will focus on Hayley Atwellâs fan-favorite character first introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger. If youâre wanting to see more, the network has released a brand-new one-minute trailer showing off the 1940s setting.\n\nThe new teaser clip is loaded with additional footage and does an excellent job of setting up the premise and noir-style world weâll be exploring during the miniseries. The series finds Peggy working with young Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper), who is framed for a crime he didnât commit.\n\nPeggy is still working for the covert S.H.I.E.L.D. precursor the SSR (Strategic Scientific Reserve), but this being the 1940s, sheâs being treated more like a secretary than a secret agent. So her secret mission with Stark is the perfect outlet, assuming she doesnât get caught â or else she could wind up in prison. The miniseries serves as a prequel to the Marvel One-Shot that inspired the project.\n\nCOBALT\n\nThat Walking Dead spinoff series has finally found its female lead.\n\nDeadline reports that after quite the lengthy casting process (AMC apparently tested a number of actresses for the role), actress Kim Dickens (Deadwood, Lost, Gone Girl) has been tapped to play the as-yet-unnamed female lead, a guidance counselor working with a divorced teacher named Sean Cabrera and played by Cliff Curtis (Gang Related).\n\nSheâs being described as looking âlike the girl next door but has a darkness to her, a troubled past that will come back to haunt her.â Donât they ever? Thatâs what makes for great TV viewing.\n\nDickensâ character also has two children, played by Frank Dillane (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) and Alycia Debnam Carey (Into the Storm). Dillaneâs character is battling drug addiction, while Careyâs is being described as âambitious.â\n\nCode-named âCobalt,â the upcoming Walking Dead spinoff will take place in Los Angeles. Weâre definitely looking forward to seeing the undead and our new gang of zombie apocalypse survivors navigate the City of Angels.\n\nThe new spinoff was created by Robert Kirkman himself (the guy who wrote all those awesome Walking Dead graphic novels on which both shows are based) and Dave Erickson. Adam Davidson is set to direct the pilot.\n\nDOCTOR WHO COMICS\n\nThe current run of Doctor Who comics is providing some great adventures for fans who miss the past two fellas to pilot the TARDIS â but what if you want to go back a bit further?\n\nWell, the folks at Titan Comics will have you covered very soon. The publisher has announced a new five-issue miniseries starring Christopher Ecclestonâs Ninth Doctor, plus two of his fan-favorite companions. The series will follow the Doctor on some throwback adventures, with both Rose and Capt. Jack Harkness along for the ride.\n\nDespite the prequel aspect, the official synopsis hints at a fairly massive plot at the center of the story, with the Doctor and his team working to avert another temporal war that could destroy the universe due to some stolen Time Lord tech.\n\nLeaving World War II behind, The Ninth Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack discover that Time Lord technology, lost in the wake of the Time War, is being sold on the intergalactic black market! Now the threat of a NEW temporal war brews on the horizon. Can the Doctor stop history repeating itself?\n\nThe series will be written by Cavan Scott and drawn by Blair Shedd. The first issue is set to hit comic shops March 11, 2015.\n\nINTO THE WOODS\n\nWalt Disney Studios has just released (via Stitch Kingdom) a new clip from their upcoming Broadway adaptation, Into the Woods. This one features Lilla Crawfordâs Red Riding Hood paying a rather gluttonous visit to James Corden and Emily Bluntâs Baker and Bakerâs Wife. Check it out in the player below to hear Crawfordâs rendition of âTo Grandmotherâs Houseâ.\n\nAlso starring Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Daniel Huttlestone, Johnny Depp, Lilla Crawford, Tracey Ullman, Christine Baranski, MacKenzie Mauzy, Billy Magnussen, Tammy Blanchard, Lucy Punch, Richard Glover, Frances de la Tour, Simon Russell Beale, Joanna Riding and Annette Crosbie, the musical adaptation offers a modern twist on the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tales, intertwining the plots of a few choice stories and exploring the consequences of the charactersâ wishes and quests.\n\nRob Marshall, the acclaimed filmmaker behind the Academy Award-winning musical Chicago and Disneyâs Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, directs the film, which is based on the musical stage production by legendary eight-time Tony, Grammy and Oscar-winning composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim and Tony winner James Lapine, who also wrote the screenplay. Into the Woods is produced by John DeLuca, Marshall, âWickedâ producer Marc Platt and Callum McDougall.\n\nInto the Woods arrives in theaters December 25.\n\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 19, 2014\n\nSPIDER-WOMAN\n\nSheâs been a stalwart of the Marvel Universe for decades, and now Spider-Woman is finally getting a brand new look. It only took 'em 37 years to do it.\n\nJessica Drewâs trademark duds have looked like a throwback to the classic spandex era for a while now, but all that changes when Spider-Woman #5 hits shelves in March 2015. The book will put a new spin on Spider-Womanâs story and try to take the character back to her more âstreet-levelâ roots of the 1970s, along with introducing a new look designed by artist Kris Anka.\n\nAs USA Today notes, the character will trade in her spandex, for black leather pants, two-toned gloves and a jacket that can double as street-wear (and be tweaked for superhero-ing) at a moments notice. Despite the tonal shift, the look still has some nice nods to the original costume, giving it a good balance. Itâs similar to what DC did a while back with Batgirl, but a bit more casual. Note: We dig the glasses.\n\nSeries editor Nick Lowe noted the new look is also a move toward practicality, since strolling around in spandex doesnât really fit the vibe of turning Jessica Drew back into a detective-style character who isnât dealing with world-ending stakes on a daily basis:\n\nâSpider-Man isn't really a detective â he swings around looking for trouble, whereas Jess needs to go and figure stuff out and dig things up, and you can't really do that head to toe in spandex very well. To operate on the level she wants to, she needs something that can pass for semi-normal and she can turn it on to crazy if she needs to.â\n\nIf you canât wait to check out Spider-Woman #5 in a few months, the new-look Jessica Drew is being added as a playable character in the Spider-Verse mobile game this week.\n\nTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK\n\nA group of actors will gather in Los Angeles on Dec. 18 to do a live reading of The Empire Strikes Back, and at least one member of the cast may surprise you.\n\nThe reading is part of a series of similar events at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) that have been orchestrated by filmmaker Jason Reitman (Juno), who is also directing tonight. What makes this event different from others in the past are two things: First, Reitman usually picks dramas or comedies -- movies heavy on dialogue -- so reading the script for a movie filled with visual effects is a striking departure. Second, the cast he's assembled for the read also contains one thought-provoking choice:\n\nLuke Skywalker - Aaron Paul\n\nHan Solo - Ellen Page\n\nPrincess Leia - Jessica Alba\n\nDarth Vader - JK Simmons\n\nC-3P0 - Stephen Merchant\n\nLando Calrissian - Dennis Haysbert\n\nYoda - Kevin Pollak\n\nYes, that's Ellen Page -- also of Juno fame, but known to genre fans for Inception and as Kitty Pryde in the X-Men movies -- playing Han Solo. Reitman told EW about his choice, \"In casting Han, the most important thing is: who has the most interesting, ironic approach to life? And when I think of that, I think of Ellen Page. Sheâs a small human being who has the energy to fill Madison Square Garden.\"\n\nSure. she's not the first person to spring to mind to play everyone's favorite Corellian smuggler, but Page is a terrific actor and will undoubtedly bring a slant to Han that we're not likely to see or hear again.\n\nAs for the rest of the cast -- JK Simmons as Darth Vader? Aaron Paul as Luke? Kevin Pollak as Yoda? Sold.\n\nTickets to this thing are long sold out -- it was actually moved from LACMA to a bigger theater downtown to accomodate the audience -- but we're sure we'll hear about the evening's performance from those lucky enough to attend (they're intended as special events and are not recorded or filmed in any way).\n\nAs for the rest of us, we can take comfort from the fact that exactly one year from today -- December 18, 2015 -- Star Wars: The Force Awakens opens in theaters everywhere.\n\nDAREDEVIL\n\nTheyâve pretty much wrapped shooting on Marvelâs first Netflix series Daredevil, though weâre still waiting on so much as some test footage to get a peek at the small-screen version of Hellâs Kitchen. Well, weâre at least one step closer.\n\nThe latest print issue of Entertainment Weekly has debuted two new official photos from the series, including one of Charlie Coxâs Daredevil in costume and kicking some butt. The other shot shows Daredevilâs alter ego, Matt Murdock, strolling the streets of New York.\n\nBut, the costume shot â weâre digging it. As weâd previously heard, the series will trace a much more gritty path toward the classic Daredevil costume, with the vigilante starting out in what is essentially a basic black outfit with a mask inspired by the John Romita Jr. look from Man Without Fear. Simple, yes, but it does look good. It also seems a good fit for the aesthetic theyâve hit in the shot, more Arrow than Avengers.\n\nThis series will be the first big test for Marvel to see if they can move outside the so-so debut of ABCâs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which was supposed to be the flagship series of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) on television. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. barely pulled a second season due to middling ratings. But now Marvel can prove they can do television right with Daredevil. Fingers crossed, at least.\n\nThe 13-episode series is set to launch in 2015 on Netflix, followed by a slew of additional Marvel shows building up to The Defenders.\n\nWEEKEND BOX OFFICE\n\nFans are rushing back to Middle-earth one last time. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies opened to a very strong $24.5 million Wednesday.\n\nThe film, the final installment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, will top the domestic box office with a $70 million to $75 million five-day debut. Opening in 3,875 locations this weekend, the New Line and MGM project's big Wednesday number includes the $11.2 million from Tuesday's late-night showings.\n\nBox-office comparisons to the previous Hobbit films won't be exactly parallel as the first two came out on Fridays. But the previous film, The Desolation of Smaug, earned $73.6 million in its debut weekend, and hit a final tally of $958.4 million worldwide. The first installment, An Unexpected Journey, opened in December 2012 to $84.6 million on its way to a grand total of $1 billion.\n\nInternationally, Five Armies has also been doing brisk business, opening in 37 markets last weekend to a strong $122.2 million.\n\nThere is still the possibility that Five Armies will earn higher than the expected range for the weekend as fans could turn out in droves to say goodbye to the Tolkien franchise. But the film faces tougher competition than its predecessors during a crowded holiday season, which includes Sony's family film Annie and Fox's Night at the Museum sequel, both opening Friday, and musical Into the Woods, Angelina Jolieâs Unbroken and Paramountâs The Gambler next weekend.\n\nFamily musical Annie is expected to earn in the $15 million range while Fox's Night at the Museum should gross $25 million or slightly higher.\n\nSALEM\n\nWGN America has released an all-new promo for the second season of their original series âSalem,â which you can check out in the player below! In the spot, Mercy, the Reverend Lewisâ increasingly powerful daughter, transforms the symbol of her torment at the hands of the townâs witches into a signal of the Witch War to come.\n\nâSalemâ is a bold re-imagination of the infamous 17th century witch trials in colonial Massachusetts. The series stars Janet Montgomery as Mary Sibley, Shane Westas John Alden, Seth Gabel as Cotton Mather, Ashley Madekwe as Tituba, Tamzin Merchant as Anne Hale, Elise Eberle as Mercy Lewis and Iddo Goldberg as Isaac Walton. Created and written by Brannon Braga and Adam Simon, âSalemâ is executive-produced by Braga, Simon, and Prospect Parkâs Jeff Kwatinetz and Josh Barry.\n\nSeason 2 of âSalemâ will premiere in April 2015.\n\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 18, 2014\n\nCOBALT\n\nItâs been more than a year since we heard AMC was developing a spinoff series for undead hit The Walking Dead, and now we finally have some details about the mystery project. The world of The Walking Dead is a big one, though for five seasons the action has been largely relegated to Atlanta and some surrounding towns in Georgia. That hyper-focus is a big part of what makes the series so good, but it has left fans wondering whatâs going on in the rest of the world. Now weâll finally get a chance to find out. The crew behind the series are putting the companion show together, whichâll dig into a whole new corner of the Dead-verse. Though the series hasnât actually gotten a season pickup yet (itâs currently in the pilot phase), itâs considered a virtual lock, considering that the mothership series often beats network shows in the TV ratings race. From the setting to main characters, here is everything we know about the currently untitled Walking Dead companion series (codenamed Cobalt). ORPHAN BLACK - SEASON THREE\n\nThe twisty clone drama Orphan Black introduced a seismic shift to its plot in the season-two finale, and one of the first pics from year three offers up a major payoff to that twist. Entertainment Weekly has debuted a new pic from the BBC America sci-fi series, showing Tatiana Maslanyâs Sarah Manning having a legit face-to-face with one of the new male Project Castor clones played by Ari Millen. Worlds collide, literally. The seriesâ co-creator Graeme Manson offered up some intel on the image, along with what we can expect from the new season. First up, it seems the new season will pick up almost immediately after the season-two finale, so donât worry about a wacky time jump. Manson also confirmed there will be \"a few\" Castor clones, though theyâre in no hurry to introduce any \"redshirts.\" Not surprisingly, he was cagey on the odds of a new Maslany clone. Check out some excerpts from the interview below in which he opens up about how the new clones will affect the relationship between all the various Maslanays, and how itâll change the flow of the series: âAre these guys going to break the bonds of our sisters? Because this does remain Sarah Manning and her sistersâthis does remain their story. So is the threat that these guys poseâwill it bring them together or will it break the bonds? They are definite pressure, and within the season again, Sarah is the lynchpin. So whatever more she understands about these Castor boys, she understands more about herself and her sisters and their origin storyâ¦ We want that audience to be taking that journey with Sarah, throughout the whole series. Sheâs going to be leading her sisters and protecting her family. And thatâs the drive. Sheâs the one that the audience roots for, so when these guys show up, itâs fantastic that weâve got this new diverse villain in the form of clonesâvillains or whatever they may turn out to be. Because now we get to exercise with Ari Millen, who is doing a fantastic job with these guys. But itâs always been important to us and itâs always been [co-creator] John [Fawcett] and my focus that this is a story about Sarah tracking down her own story.â Orphan Black season three is set to air in spring of 2015. LOADOUT\n\nLoadout: Going in Hot is the latest live-action short film adapted from a videogame by Wayside Creations, with Battlestar Galactica's Richard Hatch on board to star. Hatch plays Captain Gaz, leader of a ragtag crew of \"space merchant marines\" who deal in antiquities and curios -- but find themselves constantly competing with other local haulers to get their hands on the goods. The short builds upon the third-person shooter published by Edge of Reality and paves the way for a potential new space-opera series. Hatch, of course, is best known to sci-fi fans as Captain Apollo on the original 1978 Battlestar, and as Tom Zarek in the 2003 remake, as well as for penning several Galactica novels. But Hatch is no stranger to the new and evolving worlds of online content: In addition to doing Loadout, he also played the Klingon commander Kharn in the crowdfunded Star Trek short Prelude to Axanar, which has been so successful that a full-length feature called Star Trek: Axanar -- with Hatch returning as Kharn -- is now in preproduction. He's also ventured into steampunk alongside Malcolm McDowell and Walter Koenig in the short film Cowboys and Engines. JUSTICE LEAGUE: THRONE OF ATLANTIS\n\nFollowing a first clip back in October and a full trailer earlier this month, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, Warner Bros. Animation, and DC Entertainment have released a new clip from their upcoming Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. In Justice League: Throne of Atlantis, Cyborg discovers an imminent threat in the depths of the oceans so powerful that it rallies together the newly formed Justice League. Meanwhile, wandering thousands of feet above the ocean floor is drifter Arthur Curry, a man with strange powers who may be the last chance to bridge the ancient Atlantean world with our own. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the rest of the Justice League must band together as they face off against warmongering Orm, an army of sea creatures, otherworldly weapons and perilous odds. In this all-new epic adventure from the DC Universe, mankindâs only hope of escaping from the darkness lies with the guiding light of a man â Aquaman! Matt Lanter will provide the voice for Arthur Curry in the animated feature. Heâs joined by Jason OâMara as Batman, Shemar Moore as Cyborg, Christopher Gorham as The Flash, Sean Astin as Shazam, Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, Rosario Dawson as Wonder Woman, Jerry OâConnell as Superman, Sam Witwer as Aquamanâs devious brother Orm, and Sumalee Montano as his future bride Mera. Justice League: Throne of Atlantis will debut digitally on January 13, and on Blu-ray and DVD on January 27, 2015. THE FLY\n\nDW is asking fans of David Cronenbergâs 1986 masterpiece The Fly to once again be afraid. Be very afraid. In March, the publisher will release the first issue of âThe Fly: Outbreak,â a new five-issue miniseries that continues the world of the original film. Written by Brandon Seifert (âHellraiser,â âWitch Doctorâ), the series will feature with painted interior and cover art by menton3 (âSilent Hill,â âMonocyteâ). Years ago, a scientist had a horrific accident when he tried to use his newly-invented teleportation device and became a human/fly hybrid. Now his almost-human son continues to search for a cure for the mutated genes. But a breakthrough turns into a breakout, and anyone exposed risks turning into a monster as wellâ¦ âTo be totally honest, âThe Flyâ is one of the most disturbing things Iâve ever seen!â said Seifert. âIt was really resonant for its time. And in the last 20 years or so, with all the advances in Genetically Modified Organisms, the film has taken on a lot of meaning it didnât originally have. Itâs really exciting to explore those elements in this miniseries â and great to have an amazing, super-distinctive artist like menton3 on the visuals!â âEqual parts gory allegory and tragic love story, The Fly was perhaps David Cronenbergâs crowning achievement,â editor Denton J. Tipton said. âThatâs a lot to live up to, but I believe Brandon and Menton are equal to the task. The script is sharp and poignant, and the art is visceral and haunting. No one is safe!â It remains to be seen whether or not âThe Fly: Outbreakâ will include the continuity of the 1989 big screen sequel, The Fly II. Hitting in March, issue one of âThe Fly: Outbreakâ boasts variant covers by Jason Edmiston and Lukas Ketner. STRANGE MAGIC\n\nTouchstone Pictures and Lucasfilm have debuted the first poster for their upcoming animated film Strange Magic! Strange Magic is a madcap fairy tale musical inspired by âA Midsummer Nightâs Dream.â Popular songs from the past six decades help tell the tale of a colorful cast of goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their hilarious misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion. Lucasfilm Animation Singapore and Industrial Light & Magic, which created the CGI animation for 2011's Academy Award-winning film Rango, bring to life the fanciful forest turned upside down. With a story by George Lucas, Strange Magic is directed by Gary Rydstrom (âToy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation,â âLiftedâ), produced by Mark S. Miller (associate producer Mars Attacks!) and executive produced by George Lucas, with a screenplay by David Berenbaum (Elf), Irene Mecchi (Brave, The Lion King) and Rydstrom. The voice cast includes Alan Cumming, Evan Rachel Wood, Kristin Chenoweth, Maya Rudolph, Sam Palladio, newcomer Meredith Anne Bull, Alfred Molina, Elijah Kelley, Bob Einstein and Peter Stormare. Strange Magic will open in theaters on January 23, 2015. MARVEL PHASE THREE PLAN\n\nFollowing yesterday's big announcement of Marvel Studios' slate of Phase Three films from \"Captain America: Civil War\" opening May 2016 through to \"Avengers: Infinity War Part II\" opening May 2019, Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige sat down for a fairly extensive Q&A and answered a bunch of lingering questions about the line-up. First up, Feige admits the plan was originally to do this big announcement at Comic Con in July but they weren't able to lock down various elements in time: \"We wanted to do this at Comic Con this year. Things were not set. Things for Civil War were not set yet, Guardians hadn't come out yet, the comfort with dating a few of the other movies wasn't set yet. So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic Con when we realized we weren't going to be able to do everything we wanted to do, is to decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.' Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being today.\" Asked about the Benedict Cumberbatch cast in \"Doctor Strange\" reports earlier this week and why no announcement was made yesterday, Feige says: \"I can say that if it were confirmed, we would have introduced him. I like that Chadwick [Boseman], for the most part - I think there's always been speculation on lots of different actors for Black Panther - but I'm glad that didn't leak in earnest, the way every single other actor in human history that is of a certain age has been for Doctor Strange. So like everything else, [Doctor Strange] will be announced maybe this afternoon? Next week? Next month? Sometime before the release of the movie. With Black Pather, what our little song and dance at the end was meant to signifiy, and I'll just clarify it for you: he is definitively a big part of Civil War. We will meet him for the first time in Civil War, in costume.\" Asked about the casting of an actress for Captain Marvel, Feige says they want to lock down a writer and director first: \"My guess is rumors will start flying this second. The initial announcements, in terms of attachments for that film, will probably be writer and director announcements, which I do actually expect will be quite soon. In terms of the actress, I think there's more time.\" No mention of a fourth \"Iron Man\"? \"Not yet... if there are more years after 2019, there'll be more possibilities after 2019.\" In terms of the 'Civil War' storyline, he advises that don't expect this to be utterly faithful to the comic storyline: \"Make no mistake, this is the 'Civil War' of the cinematic universe which will be greatly inspired by the 'Civil War' of the comic universe, but we have very different continuity going now. So this will be 'Civil War' based off of all the other films you've seen up to this point, particularly 'Winter Soldier' and particularly 'Age of Ultron'. The generalities of the act are the same, something happens, perhaps it's culmulative from the events of all of the movies leading up to this point, that's made the Governments of the world say we need some oversight of these guys. They need to report to somebody. So it falls under that umbrella versus take off your mask, it's not about the secret identity thing as much as it is overall who reports to who, and who can agree to an oversight committee. Because as of 'Avengers 2' there is no more world security council obviously, there is no more SHIELD obviously. Stark is paying for it, Captain America is running it, and things occur that make Governments begin to question that.\" The notable absence of a standalone Hulk film? \"Hulk is going to appear in many of those [Phase 3] movies, particularly all those 'Avengers' movies leading up to 2019. Mark Ruffalo is onboard for all those films, and we're excited to bring you all those films. What happens with a standalone 'Hulk' film? We'll see... We'd love to do it, we'd love to find a place to put it, but right now Hulk will be appearing with his friends in the other films.\" Asked about Phase Four films, Feige says they won't go into details about the third Phase films due to potential spoilers: \"We're not going to talk specifically about the storyline of any of those films, the plot lines of any of those films, what happens to those characters in any of those films, and frankly to even talk about who will be in what movies is a bit of a spoiler as to what may or may not happen to them in earlier movies.\" Asked how the \"Inhumans\" fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he says the groundwork may be layed sooner than you think: \"Where they fit into the universe? You may find out sooner than you're expecting frankly. I already mentioned in the presentation that there are seeds leading to \"Black Panther\" and Wakanda starting very very soon in things you've already seen and will see soon. Likewise with Inhumans, there may be easter eggs starting before you know it.\" Asked about the potential over saturation of the market with superhero films, Feige says as long as the movies are of good quality - people will come: \"Our plan has never been altered based on what anyone else is doing. In any genre, frankly, particularly in any other superhero film. In terms of the dating, that's why we plant flags as early as we do, to mark some territory, so that you can hopefully have some room. But the truth is there are always going to be big movies on almost every weekend. What we've found so far is that if the movie delivers, the movie will do well. That's what we focus on: what we can control, which is the quality of the pictures.\" Asked about the lack of a \"Black Widow\" solo film, he gives a similar answer as to what he gave about Hulk: \"It's about bringing new characters to the screen. Black Widow couldn't be more important as an Avenger herself, and like Hulk, the Avengers films will be the films where they play a primary role. Her part in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very very big, and further develops and further enhances her character. The plans that we have for her throughout the rest of the 'Avengers' saga is very very big and lynchpin in fact to those films. So instead of taking her out there, or instead of doing a prequel which we haven't done yet, continuing the forward momentum of the continuity of the cinematic universe of which Widow is a key key part.\" Asked about his involvement with the Marvel TV properties, Feige says he's exclusively involved with the movies but did offer some input regarding ABC's upcoming \"Agent Carter\" limited series. Finally, asked about members of \"The Defenders\" (the heroes of the four Netflix shows) showing up on the big screen, Feige says: \"There are a lot of people from the movies in 'Infinity War', a lot of it is about space, and a lot of it is about what happens between now and then. But all of those things inhabit, however far on the outskirts, the same continuity so certainly that opportunity exists.\"\n\nWEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2014\n\nHE-MAN AND MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE\n\nWeâre still waiting for He-Man to make his triumphant return to pop culture stardom, but while we wait, how about a walk down memory lane to see how it all started? Some vintage concept art has been released as part of the upcoming Art of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe book, set to hit shelves on April 28, 2015. The sketches and production art date back to the conception of the commercial for the Castle Greyskull play set. Mattel developed the He-Man animated series as a way to sell more He-Man toys, and itâs fascinating to see how they jammed a bunch of styles together. Along with the concept art, one of the original pitch letters from lead designer Roger Sweet has also been revealed. Not surprisingly, itâs all about the toys: It may be time to introduce into the [Mattel Action Figures] line a new theme of \"fantasy make-believe.\" The theme would be oriented towards Frizetta [sic] type figures possibly combined with parts of Conan, and Flash Gordon and Star Wars. Frizetta [sic] type subject matter had no \"advanced technology\" vehicles and accessories but these can be added within this theme. In addition giants (Shogun size), mid-size and nine figures (1 1/2\" - 2\") can all be combined in this theme and played with together. Check out some early toy designs, as well as stunning sketches for the pilot episode of the animated series, at www.blastr.com. The book is being published by Dark Horse, with help from the Power and Honor Foundation.Mo JEFF 1000\n\nSummer Glau knows that you kinda have a crush on her. She hasn't just accepted that; she's recognized that she will always be that girl you saw in that sci-show you love so much, and she's embraced it. And in the process of taking on a multitude of roles in a boatload of different science-fiction vehicles, she's embraced being something else, too -- self-aware. Further proof that Glau is at least a little cool with the whole \"Aren't you River? No, no, I mean the other River.\" thing is her leading role in the webseries, Jeff 1000, a trilogy of shorts in which Glau plays opposite her co-star and friend, Jeff. Jeff is an ordinary guy who is a newcomer to Hollywood. He's a bit of a fish-out-of-water who hails from some podunk town where he used to have a gig at a car-manufacturing plant -- he's also a ten foot tall robot. No big deal. This certainly isn't the first series to poke fun at how ridiculous Hollywood is, but it is the first to do it with Summer Glau and a giant robot. There's also an adorable pug involved, should that be a deciding factor for you. STAR WARS NOVELS\n\nWe already know that 2015 is going to be a very, very big year for Star Wars. A little more than a year from now, we'll all be in theaters watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but that's just the capper to months and months of other fun stuff from a galaxy far, far away. There are new Star Wars novels coming, new toys will fill store shelves for the 2015 holiday season, and Star Wars will also be a major force in 2015 comics through a combination of the new and the old. Marvel Comics, which announced the return of license for Star Wars comics to them earlier this year thanks to Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm, already has plenty of projects in the works for the franchise. Back in July, the publisher announced not only that they'll be launching three new Star Wars titles (so far) next year, but that they're also re-releasing the original Star Wars ongoing series in a new omnibus format. Now fans of classic Star Wars comics have another reason to celebrate. Marvel announced today that it will be re-releasing all three original comic-book adaptations of the original Star Wars trilogy in oversized hardcover format next year, beginning with the adaptation of Star Wars first published weeks before the film hit theaters in 1977. The new edition will feature remastered coloring of Howard Chaykin's original art by colorist Chris Sotomayor, and a new cover by Adi Granov. The Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope remaster will arrive in May, coinciding with the 38th anniversary of Star Wars' release, with the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi graphic novels following later in the year. So, if you're hoping to add to your Star Wars comic collection next year, you'll have no shortage of options, including hardcovers, like this Granov's cover. INTO THE WOODS\n\nWalt Disney Studios has just released new clips from their upcoming Broadway adaptation, Into the Woods. The first features Meryl Streepâs Witch explaining to James Corden and Emily Bluntâs Baker and Bakerâs Wife the objects of power sheâll need to break a spell that has left the pair childless. In the second, the couple have come across one of the objects â a milky white cow â and now have to persuade Daniel Huttlestoneâs Jack to part with it in exchange for some magic beans. Also starring Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Johnny Depp, Lilla Crawford, Tracey Ullman, Christine Baranski, MacKenzie Mauzy, Billy Magnussen, Tammy Blanchard, Lucy Punch, Richard Glover, Frances de la Tour, Simon Russell Beale, Joanna Riding and Annette Crosbie, the musical adaptation offers a modern twist on the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tales, intertwining the plots of a few choice stories and exploring the consequences of the charactersâ wishes and quests. Rob Marshall, the acclaimed filmmaker behind the Academy Award-winning musical Chicago and Disneyâs Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, directs the film, which is based on the musical stage production by legendary eight-time Tony, Grammy and Oscar-winning composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim and Tony winner James Lapine, who also wrote the screenplay. Into the Woods is produced by John DeLuca, Marshall, âWickedâ producer Marc Platt and Callum McDougall. Into the Woods arrives in theaters December 25. THE FLASH NEWS\n\nAccess Hollywood brings word that former âThe Tomorrow Peopleâ and âMad Menâ star Peyton List has joined the cast of âThe Flashâ as Lisa Snart, the sister of Leonard Snart, AKA Captain Cold (played by Wentworth Miller on the series). Lisa will attempt to join up with her brotherâs âRoguesâ gang in the series, much like she did in the source material where she went by the supervillain name Golden Glider. Sheâll make her debut in the showâs 16th episode. âThe Flashâ will return on Tuesday, January 20, 2015 with its tenth episode titled âRevenge of the Rogues.â CINDERELLA\n\nWalt Disney Studios has debuted the new international trailer for director Kenneth Branaghâs Cinderella, coming to theaters on March 13, 2015. The live-action film stars Lily James, Cate Blanchett, Richard Madden, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, Holliday Grainger, Derek Jacobi and Helena Bonham Carter. The story of Cinderella follows the fortunes of young Ella whose merchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother. Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother Lady Tremaine and her daughters Anastasia and Drisella into the family home. But, when Ellaâs father suddenly and unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her motherâs dying words and to âhave courage and be kind.â She will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an employee at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ellaâs hopes of once again encountering the charming âKit.â Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand as a kindly beggar woman steps forward and, armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, changes Cinderellaâs life forever.\n\nTUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2014\n\nAVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON\n\nTony Starkâs armor has been evolving ever since the first Iron Man film back in 2008, and we got the culmination of that in the wild third act of Iron Man 3. So, whatâs in store for Iron Manâs next appearance? The hyper-detailed 1/6th-scale Mark XLIII Collectible Figure from Hot Toys has been revealed, giving us our best look yet at Iron Manâs latest suit from Avengers: Age of Ultron. Not surprisingly, it bears a lot of similarities to his Iron Man 3 look, though thereâs a bit more silver accents and some tweaks to the chestplate. This suit looks like it's already been through a few battles, with some scratches, slight dents and scraped paint around the weathered edges. Not surprisingly, it also looks awesome, as one would expect from a Joss Whedon Avengers film. Of note: The diorama holds some intrigue, with a busted Ultron Mark I lying in the rubble. Avengers: Age of Ultron opens May 1, 2015. THE CIRCLE\n\nTom Hanks is already starring in the upcoming A Hologram for the King, an adaptation of the Dave Eggers novel that reteams the Two-time Academy Award winner with Cloud Atlas co-helmer Tom Tykwer. Now, Deadline reveals that Hanks is planning another big screen take on Eggers with The Circle. The Spectacular Now director James Ponsoldt is writing and directing the big screen take on the 2013 novel, officially described as follows: When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the worldâs most powerful internet company, she feels sheâs been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links usersâ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the companyâs modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae canât believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the worldâeven as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one womanâs ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge. Hanks is attached to both star in and produce The Circle alongside Gary Goetzman through their Playtone banner.The project is said to be actively being shopped around Hollywood this week, so check back for additional details on the project in the very near future. THE HOBBIT: BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES\n\nAlready beginning to open internationally, Peter Jacksonâs grand finale to his Middle-earth saga, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, arrives this week domestically, hitting 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D theaters this Wednesday, December 17. In honor of the event, Warner Bros. Pictures has just released a new feautrette that has the filmâs cast and crew saying goodbye to J.R.R. Tolkienâs incredible fantasy world. The impressive ensemble cast of âThe Defining Chapterâ includes Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Luke Evans, Richard Armitage, Cate Blanchett, Evangeline Lilly, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Fry, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ken Stott, James Nesbitt, Orlando Bloom, John Bell, Manu Bennett, Jed Brophy, Adam Brown, John Callen, Billy Connolly, Ryan Gage, Mark Hadlow, Peter Hambleton, Stephen Hunter, William Kircher, Lawrence Makoare, Sylvester McCoy, Graham McTavish, Dean OâGorman, Mikael Persbrandt and Aidan Turner. Having reclaimed their homeland from the Dragon Smaug, Bilbo and his Company of Dwarves have unwittingly unleashed a deadly force into the world. Enraged, Smaug rains his fiery wrath down upon the defenseless men, women and children of Lake-town. Obsessed above all else with his reclaimed treasure, Thorin sacrifices friendship and honor to hoard it as Bilboâs frantic attempts to make him see reason drive the Hobbit towards a desperate and dangerous choice. But there are even greater dangers ahead. Unseen by any but the Wizard Gandalf, the great enemy Sauron has sent forth legions of Orcs in a stealth attack upon the Lonely Mountain. As darkness converges on their escalating conflict, the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men must decide â unite or be destroyed. Bilbo finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of his friends in the epic Battle of the Five Armies, as the future of Middle-earth hangs in the balance. STAR TREK 3\n\nUPDATE: Make that four names! Following the initial story, Duncan Jones has taken to Twitter to confirm he wonât be directing. âVery flattering being on short list for Star Trek, but wonât be doing it,â he wrote. âAbsolutely MUST make my own thing next, or Iâll die of old age!â The original story follows: Following the departure of Roberto Orci from the directorâs chair of Star Trek 3 (or 13 depending on your point of view), the hunt for a new director has already begun and now Deadline reports that Paramount Pictures and J.J. Abrams have narrowed it down to a list of five names. On the list are directors Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game), Daniel Espinosa (Safe House), Justin Lin (Fast & Furious), and Duncan Jones (Moon, Warcraft). Although a release date has not been specified, it is widely believed that the plan is for the film to hit theaters in 2016, as the year marks the 50th anniversary of the âStar Trekâ franchise. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Anton Yelchin, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana and John Cho are all expected to reprise their roles as the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Plot details have not yet been revealed, although Orci stated earlier this year that his plan was to set the action in deep space, unlike the relatively Earth-centric J.J. Abrams films. There is no word currently on whether the film will move forward with the same screenplay scripted by Orci, Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne or seek a new draft. BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE\n\nAmy Adams says that despite the presence of Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman character in Zack Snyder's upcoming \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" don't expect some fanboy love triangle in the film between Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), Adams' own character Lois Lane and the Amazonian heroine. Adams tells Coming Soon: \"It's exciting to get to bring in all these other characters, and I was really excited that Gal was involved, because it was a nice to have another girl on set. Even if we don't work together a lot, it was nice to have her there... They always think that if you put in another woman and automatically... 'Catfight!' No, I think that's a male fantasy thing. I don't think that's reality. I don't know how it will turn out, if we're going to be competition, but we are not in this, I can safely say, and we're not in real life. She's just the coolest girl ever.\" In another interview for Collider, Adams says that despite all the superheroes competing for screen time, Lois will still be an important player in the action: \"Lois is still sort of like the key to the information, you know? She's the girl going out and getting it and figuring it out and putting it together and all of that, so she's very much involved, but I kind of leave the heavy lifting to the boys, you know? So to speak. They're awesome together. It's kind of like this big fest of muscles ... it was really kind of nice. And then you add Jason Momoa and Gal Gadot and I felt very short and, yeah.\" Meanwhile, Jeremy Irons has spoken a bit more about his version of Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth, telling Indiewire: \"Oh he'll be quite different. He has an interesting history. He's a very competent man. He's the sort of man I think anyone would like to be married to. He can sort of do everything: change light bulbs, blow up bridges if he has to.\" Capping off the news on the film today, OneHeadlightLink reports that casting is underway for two young boys in the film, both required to have extensive wushu, kung fu or pencak silat training. One of the roles is said to be a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne, the other is an unidentified 10-year-old boy.\n\nMONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 2014\n\nMARIO BROS. ANIMATED PROJECT\n\nThe long-running producer behind the Spider-Man movies, Avi Arad, is planning to make a series of Super Mario Bros. animated films next. According to Buzzfeed, and later confirmed by Arad, Sony is actively working to get its hands on the film rights to Super Mario Bros. from gaming giant Nintendo, with plans to turn it into an animated/CGI film franchise. According to emails that surfaced as part of the Sony hack, Arad told Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal (in an email dated Oct. 23, 2014, under the subject line âMarioâ): âI am the proud father of mario the animated film [sic].â He then proceeded to forward Pascal two images. One was of himself with Shigeru Miyamoto -- the legendary videogame designer and Mario creator -- and the other one was of him with Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata. The latter pic included this message: âHappy ceo, lets get together, itâs the mother load. [sic]â Then Amy Pascal allegedly passed that email along to Tom Rothman, who is the head of TriStar Pictures (which is a Sony subsidiary) with this added message: âAvi closed Mario brothers. Animated.â In a followup email on Oct. 24, sent to Sony Pictures Animation president of production Michelle Raimo Kouyate, Arad thanked her for a Mario Bros. merchandise basket that she sent to him, with Kouyate answering back by saying: âThank you Avi Letâs build a Mario empire! I can think of 3-4 movies right out of the gate on this. So huge!â It seems that Arad has been pursuing the Super Mario Bros. franchise for a while now. Kouyate told Pascal in a Feb. 24 email that Arad was traveling to Japan partly âto meet with his Nintendo guy (who he has been courting for a couple years).â Then a couple of months later, on July 14, Arad sent this email to Pascal: âI am heading to Tokyo â¦ I am going to try and bring back a little plumber. I guess we can all use our pipes cleaned.â Now, this is all cool and very exciting, but what does Avi Arad actually have to say to this? Once the story broke, the Amazing Spider-Man producer responded to the reports with a statement essentially confirming the talks but cautioning that this is âjust the beginning.â BEOWULF COMING AS SERIES\n\nHaving already had the big-screen CGI treatment with Ray Winstone in the titular role, ninth-century English epic poem Beowulf is now being adapted for TV. U.K. broadcaster ITV will bring the ancient story to life. It announced Monday that it has commissioned a 13-part series, due to air next year. \"Hundreds of years ago, our ancestors listened to the story of Beowulf because it was a great adventure story - it scared them, thrilled them, made them laugh and cry. But they also listened because they recognized themselves and their fears in it,\" said James Dormer (Wallander, Strike Back), who will write and executive produce the show. \"By holding a mirror up to them, this story helped define them and thus - us,\" he added. \"So itâs incredibly exciting to have the opportunity to make it relevant again for a wide audience - to let them own it again. To let them see themselves in it.\" Shooting on the drama, which tells the tale of a wandering warrior who must hunt down the terrifying monster Grendl (whose even more terrifying mother was famously played by Angeline Jolie in the film), will begin in Northeast England in April. ITV Studios' creative director of drama Tim Haines will executive produce with ITV Studios' executive producer of drama Katie Newman. WEEKEND BOX OFFICE\n\nExodus: Gods and Kings easily topped the U.S. box office this weekend with a $24.5 million debut, dethroning The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â Part 1, which had held No. 1 for the past three weeks. While the biblical epic, starring Christian Bale, earned exactly what box office insiders had expected for the weekend, it's not the strongest of starts for the big-budget 20th Century Fox and Chernin Entertainment film. And even though December openings are known for their slower starts and longer burns, Exodus, which cost $140 million to make after tax breaks, will need long legs over the next few holiday weekends to make a solid total. It will face stiff competition as well during a crowded holiday season that includes The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, family musical Annie, Disney's Into the Woods and Fox's threequel Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. While reviews weren't strong and there was some backlash over the casting of mainly Caucasian actors for the roles, Fox points out that Exodus' opening weekend audience was quite diverse, which is promising for the film's future. The audience was 54 percent male, and 65 percent was over 25 years old. And 20 percent of the audience was African-American while 18 percent Latino. Top grossing theaters ranged from major metropolitan cities to smaller towns such as San Antonio. Exodus also opened in several international territories, earning $43.3 million around the globe. Second place for the weekend went to the third Hunger Games film, now it its fourth week in theaters. The Jennifer Lawrence-starring YA adaptation slid only 40 percent, earning $13.2 million for a domestic total of $277.4 million. Worldwide, the film has earned $611.4 million, helping Lionsgate pass the $1 billion mark internationally for the third year in a row. Animated film Penguins of Madagascar swooped in just ahead of this weekend's other new offering, Top Five, for third place. The Fox family film earned a solid $7.3 million in its third week, and has earned $58.8 million domestically to date. Chris Rock's comedy Top Five lands in fourth place for the weekend with a $7.2 million debut. The Paramount film, about a comedian who is trying to be a serious actor, opened in 979 locations, and will open wider in the coming holiday weeks, hitting around 2,000 by Jan 1. \"Our goal was to start the movie and then build it, and get the word-of-mouth going,\" Paramount vice chairman Rob Moore tells The Hollywood Reporter. The comedy has benefited from strong reviews (89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), and critically praised R-rated comedies (Bridesmaids, for example) often have very strong multiples, so Paramount plans for the film to continue to perform well as it opens wider. Disney's family film Big Hero 6 took fifth place, adding $6.5 million to its domestic tally for a total of $185.3 million. Internationally, the film also opened in Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Iceland and Hong Kong this weekend and pushed its worldwide tally to $253.5 million. Inherent Vice, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest, also entered theaters this weekend in five locations. Warner Bros.' Joaquin Phoenix-starrer earned $330,000 in its debut for a stellar $66,000 per screen. Several awards films seem to have benefited from the announcement of the SAG and Golden Globe nominations, doing brisk business this weekend as well. Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything took ninth place for the weekend, earning $2.5 million playing at 1,220 theaters for a per-theater average of $2,070. And in its second week, Reese Witherspoon-starrer Wild had a strong weekend to take the No. 10 spot with $1.55 million in 116 locations for a per-screen average of $13,333. Other films at the specialty box office that performed well include The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, which, in its third week, took in another $875,000 in 25 theaters for a per-screen average of $35,005. The critically acclaimed film about British mathematician Alan Turing has earned $2 million domestically to date. ULTIMATE 2015 PREVIEW\n\nWe're almost to the end of the year, with not too many big event movies left to be released. Next week will see The Hobbit: The Battle of The Five Armies finally in theaters, and then on Christmas day, we'll get the anticipated family sequel Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. Then its all over. But not to worry, we have a whole new year in front of us, and if a new mash-up trailer is any indiciation, 2015 will be even better than 2014.

This is a must see for any movie fan, and if you weren't excited about this coming year, here's a mashup that will get you electrified, emotional and just plain ready to go! Get your pocket books ready, these next twelve months at the movies are going to be epic. After a quick run-through of all the participating studio logos, Mark Brandon gleefully kicks things off with Avengers: Age of Ultron, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Jurassic World, inarguably the three biggest releases coming our way in the next twelve months. A heavy rocking soundtrack then delivers even more footage, setting up Terminator Genisys, Furious 7 and Taken 3 as just some of the must-see movies heading our way soon.\n\nSUNDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2014\n\nBATMAN: ARKHAM KNIGHT\n\nBefore we get the epic conclusion to the no-less-epic Batman: Arkham videogame series with Arkham Knight -- set to be released in June of next year, by the way -- weâll get to be introduced to the titular character with a prequel comic.\n\nDC Comics announced via Entertainment Weekly earlier today that its new Digital First title will come from the world of Rocksteady Studios' Arkham videogame series.\n\nThe new digital comic will be based on the eagerly anticipated Arkham Knight game, set to conclude the story begun in 2009 with Arkham Asylum and followed by Arkham City (the game Arkham Origins wasnât developed by Rocksteady). Arkham Knight will be the first game to introduce a brand-new character in the shape and form of the titular Arkham Knight.\n\nHere's the announcement:\n\nWritten by Peter J. Tomasi (Batman and Robin) with art by Viktor Bogdanovic and Art Thibert, and covers by Dan Panosian, the Digital First comic will pick up the story where Arkham City left off. The Joker is dead, and the Arkham City prison complex is closed. In a dark place, Bruce Wayne is questioning whether Gotham needs Batmanâbut new trouble begins to stir, all of it tied to the Arkham Knight.\n\nArkham Knight #1 will go on sale Feb. 24, 2015, and the Batman: Arkham Knight game hits Playstation 4 and Xbox One on June 2, 2015.\n\nTHE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES\n\nThe final trailer for the final Hobbit film is here, and it's as much about looking back as it is about looking forward.\n\nWe're now less than a week away from the release of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the last film in Peter Jackson's divisive trilogy adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's first Middle-earth novel, and the film's marketing machine is still emphasizing the \"One Last Time\" of it all. This isn't just the end of The Hobbit, after all, but the end of Jackson's six-film excursion into Middle-earth, an excursion that -- though it's been a bit less warmly received in recent years -- earned loads of critical praise, a huge fanbase and no shortage of awards. Whether you personally agree or not, Warner Bros. is emphasizing this as the \"definining\" chapter of the Middle-earth saga, as a moment that we as moviegoers will never recapture again.\n\nSo it makes sense that the last trailer for The Battle of the Five Armies would take advantage of that point of view. In two and a half minutes, the trailer takes a loving look back at the entire trilogy, including an older Bilbo (Ian Holm) beginning to recount his tale, a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) meeting Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Thorin (Richard Armitage) for the first time, a peek at Gollum (Andy Serkis) and more, all building over somber music to clips of the struggle yet to come in the titular battle of the final film. If you're a fan of the Hobbit movies, you'll see this as a trip through some of the most effective moments of the films, and if you're not, well ... you might consider it a look at what could've been if the series had kept this kind of focus. Either way, it's a memorable trailer.\n\nBLADE RUNNER SEQUEL\n\nHarrison Ford apparently does not have a bad feeling about the Blade Runner sequel.\n\nRidley Scott, who directed the 1982 sci-fi classic, told MTV News that the sequel's script is \"written and ready to go,\" and Ford is \"absolutely\" on board for the film.\n\n\"I sent him this [script], and he said itâs the best thing heâs ever read,\" Scott said. \"Itâs very relevant to what happened in the first one.\"\n\nThe Exodus director added that he is currently unsure whether he would helm Blade Runner's sequel.\n\nScott also discussed his plans for a Prometheus sequel, saying that the 2012 film's follow-up would center on the relationship between Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender).\n\nARROW NEWS\n\nCBR brings word that former Beastmaster star Marc Singer has joined the cast of The CWâs âArrowâ as General Matthew Shrieve, who in the comics is the human leader of the âCreature Commandos,â a military unit consisting of Frankensteinâs monster, a werewolf, a vampire, and a gorgon. The official character listing for Shrieve reads as follows:\n\nâIn the DC Comics, Matthew Shrieve is the leader of a group known as the Creature Commandos. In âArrowâ he will play a significant role in the latter portion of the seasonâs flashback storyline.â\n\nSinger will make his debut in the 14th episode of the seriesâ third season which will be a recurring role. No stranger to genre roles, Singer is most well known for headlining the three âBeastmasterâ films but also had roles in the sci-fi favorite âVâ as well as the âPlanet of the Apesâ TV series and âBatman: The Animated Series,â where he provided the voice of Kirk Langstrom, AKA Man-Bat.\n\nâArrowâ will return for its mid-season premiere on January 21.\n\nDESCENDANTS\n\nExactly one year to the day after the project was first announced, Disney Channel has revealed a teaser trailer for itâs 2015 telefilm, âDescendants.â\n\nIn a present day idyllic kingdom, Disneyâs âDescendantsâ follows the benevolent teenaged son of the King and Queen (Beast and Belle from Disney?s iconic Beauty and the Beast), who is poised to take the throne. His first proclamation: offer a chance at redemption to the trouble-making offspring of Cruella De Vil, Maleficent, the Evil Queen and Jafar who have been imprisoned on a forbidden island with all the other villains, sidekicks, evil step-mothers and step-sisters. These villainous descendants (Carlos, Mal, Evvie and Jay, respectively) are allowed into the kingdom to attend prep school alongside the offspring of iconic Disney heroes including Fairy Godmother, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel and Mulan. However, the evil teens face a dilemma. Should they follow in their nefarious parents? footsteps and help all the villains regain power or embrace their innate goodness and save the kingdom?\n\nHigh School Musical helmer Kenny Ortega directs âDescendants,â which was written by âThe Starter Wifeâ creators Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott with High School Musicalâs Mark Hofeling tackling the production design and Karen Saun (âProject Runwayâ) providing the wardrobe design.\n\nThereâs no exact premiere date for âDescendantsâ quite yet, but look for it to hit Disney Channel in 2015.\n\nSATURDAY, DECEMBER 13, 2014\n\nDOCTOR WHO CHRISTMAS SPECIAL\n\nThe BBC has released a brand-new clip for Doctor Whoâs upcoming Christmas special in which our good old Saint Nick makes quite the entrance.\n\nBombastic music and explosions? Check. An army of beloved children's toys? Check. Santa (Shaun of the Deadâs Nick Frost) riding Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer in a way that would put John Wayne to shame? Check. Weird, creepy aliens? Check. That tangerine thing popping up again? Check. Parking jokes? Check, check, check.\n\nThings definitely get a bit weird in this brand-new clip for Doctor Whoâs upcoming yuletide special episode, âThe Last Christmas.â\n\nBut, eh, itâs Doctor Who, things are always bound to get weird.\n\nDoctor Who's \"The Last Christmas\" will air Christmas Day.\n\nWOLVERINE\n\nHere's a snikt sneak at the new Death of Wolverine spinoff, Wolverines #1, by writers Charles Soule, Ray Fawkes, Allison Borges and artist Nick Bradshaw. After Logan's demise, superheroes with close links to Wolverine, including Mystique, Sabretooth, Daken and X-23, forge a fragile alliance to honor and preserve the legacy of the infamous X-Man, now reduced to a valuable artifact consisting of his adamantium-encased mortal remains. Wolverines #1 is expected to hit shelves in January 2015, exploring the deeper essences of these iconic Marvel characters.\n\nHere's the official Marvel synopsis:\n\nHis death was only the beginning.

X-23, Daken, Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, the mysterious man known only as Sharp and many, many more!\n\nDUNE - 30 YEARS AGO\n\nAs an added holiday treat for our Dune-iversary tribute marking the 30th birthday of David Lynch's audacious Dune adaptation, here's a rare documentary that once made the convention circuit to help drum up interest in Universal's tentpole sci-fi feature for December 1984. Known as Destination Dune, this 6-minute short was used for publicity purposes only and meant to screen at science fiction fan events, comic-book conventions and fantasy collectible shows.\n\nIn its brief running time we get to see several key scenes being rehearsed and filmed in the Mexico City soundstages and even includes a sneak peek inside the prop and model shop, with David Lynch discussing designs with special effects coordinator Carlo Rambaldi (E.T.), hugging executive producer Dino De Laurentiis, chatting with famed production designer Tony Masters (2001: A Space Odyssey) and an appearance by Dune author, Frank Herbert, displaying his unbridled exuberance.\n\nThis intriguing little doc was only included in the 2004 UK DVD release of Dune and is a revealing time capsule of behind-the-scenes banter amid the amazingly complex sets when corporate enthusiasm for the troubled production was still riding high.\n\nDIVERGENT: INSURGENT\n\nA brand-new, explosive trailer has been released for the eagerly anticipated sequel to Divergent: Insurgent.\n\nSummit Entertainment has dropped a new trailer and poster for The Divergent Series: Insurgent. The new flick will be the second entry in whatâll be a four-film adaptation of Veronica Rothâs dystopian sci-fi series. It stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Daniel Dae Kim, Maggie Q, Ray Stevenson and Zoe Kravitz.\n\nHere's the official movie blurb:\n\nInsurgent raises the stakes for Tris as she searches for allies and answers in the ruins of a futuristic Chicago. Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) are now fugitives on the run, hunted by Jeanine (Kate Winslet), the leader of the power-hungry Erudite elite. Racing against time, they must find out what Trisâs family sacrificed their lives to protect, and why the Erudite leaders will do anything to stop them. Haunted by her past choices but desperate to protect the ones she loves, Tris, with Four at her side, faces one impossible challenge after another as they unlock the truth about the past and ultimately the future of their world.\n\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 12, 2014\n\nCHANGE IN SYFY ATTITUDE\n\nAfter riding high on fun hits such as Eureka and Warehouse 13 the past several years, itâs easy to see Syfy is putting some development muscle back into hard sci-fi. So what does the man behind the would-be renaissance have to say about the process? Syfyâs chief David Howe (Syfy is the corporate owner of Blastr -Ed.) sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the networkâs renewed push into more ambitious titles such as Ascension, 12 Monkeys, The Expanse and Childhoodâs End. According to Howe, the widespread success of the sci-fi genre across other networks (i.e. AMCâs ratings juggernaut The Walking Dead) has shown that itâs viable for the network to double down in this space and (hopefully) find success. Howe used the ambitious 2002 Steven Spielberg miniseries Taken as a touchstone â noting that Syfy is capable of competing on that level (the miniseries wasnât perfect, but it was still great) â adding that the network wants to once again be the home of transcendent shows with the cultural cachet of something like 2004âs Battlestar Galactica: âComcast recognizes we need to be in the high-quality content space and is prepared to invest in that and give us what we need in terms of owning this space in a way that we haven't since Taken. The other thing that's gone on in the last three or four years is that there's been an explosion of this genre across pretty much every broadcast and cable network. We have to position ourselves as the experts in this space, and we have to be seen to be tackling the smartest projects: genre-heavy as opposed to genre-lite. You cannot be in this space and not step up. From a sci-fi/fantasy perspective, you're competing with Game of Thrones, Walking Dead and a lot of those more expensive series. The Expanse, which we greenlighted straight to series for 10 episodes, is by far our most expensive series. We had to compete to get it. HBO was in the mix; Netflix was in the mix. We clearly aspire to those [Walking Dead] numbers, and I do think that we have the capability and the potential to get them. We talk a lot about Battlestar Galactica, which was the smartest, most pro-vocative show on TV before its time. Six or seven years ago, heavily serialized shows didn't play, there was no social media and there was very little in the way of nonlinear catch-up. If we had Battlestar Galactica on our air now, it would absolutely be a Breaking Bad, a Walking Dead, a True Blood. The aspiration is, we want to get back in that space.â But that doesnât mean itâs been perfect. The network has been making the sometimes awkward transition for a while now, and Howe touched on the cross-media experiment Defiance as an example of an ambitious idea that didnât exactly go off as planned. The series (which is coming back in 2015 for a third season) ties in to a MMORPG videogame, but the extremely expensive game side of the equation hasnât actually been much of a hit (and the show itself pulls in good-but-not-great ratings): âWe built a video game together with a series â it was a very risky, long-term project, but we need to be in the business of what's new and what's next, storytelling beyond the linear experience. The series has been very successful, the game less so, and the learning curve around immersive storytelling was incredibly powerful for us. So, the Defiance experience was incredibly fun and incredibly frustrating.â SPIDER-MAN UNLIMITED\n\nSince it doesnât look like weâll be getting our Spider-Man jones filled in an upcoming Marvel movie anytime soon, weâll have to make do with this intriguing new videogame featuring the wall-crawler(s). Dubbed Spider-Man Unlimited: The Spidey-Verse, the new mobile game brings in Spider-Men from across the various Marvel canons to battle a common foe. The game actually ties in to the ongoing Spider-Verse comic storyline, and is stylized with a comic look that seems to be a nice approach for the genre. Seasoned comic writer Dan Slott, who is currently penning the Amazing Spider-Man run, helped put the story together for the game to ensure it was accurate and matched up with what fans expect coming in to a Spider-Man game. The plot features different Spider-Men from various realities teaming up to take on the new vampire-like baddie Morlun. The game hits iOS, Google Play and Windows Phone platforms today. BROADCHURCH\n\nThe trailer for the second season of the critically-acclaimed U.K. crime drama Broadchurch has finally been unveiled, with David Tennant and Olivia Colman reprising their roles as detectives in a sleepy yet troubled English seaside town. Whereas the first season dealt with the death of a schoolboy, the trailer for the second suggests a story involving an abduction. But itâs clear that the characters are still dealing with the issues that came to an explosive, emotional finale in the first outing that had the U.K. gripped. The show was remade as Gracepoint by Fox, with Tennant cast in the lead as Detective Emmett Carver and the original creator Chris Chibnall in the writer's chair once more. The series concluded Thursday. The second season of Broadchurch will air on ITV in the U.K. Jan. 5 and on BBC America in the U.S. Feb. 4. THE WALKING DEAD\n\nAMC has debuted a new video for the remaining eight episodes of âThe Walking Deadâ Season 5 with the cast and crew teasing what we can expect from the characters and storylines. The series will return on February 8, 2015 for the remaining episodes of Season 5 and has already been renewed for a sixth season, set to begin in fall of 2015. Based on the comic created by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, âThe Walking Deadâ stars Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun, Lauren Cohan, Chad Coleman, Chandler Riggs, Melissa McBride, Emily Kinney, Danai Gurira and Sonequa Martin-Green. AGENT CARTER\n\nFollowing the poster that debuted yesterday, Marvel Entertainment and ABC have released the first official plot synopses for the first two episodes of âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ which will air back-to-back when the series premieres. The first episode, titled âNow is Not the End,â is described as follows: âPeggy is contacted by old acquaintance Howard Stark when he is framed for unleashing his deadliest weapons and can trust no one else. To help Peggy clear Starkâs name, he insists his butler, Edwin Jarvis, be at her beck and callâwhether she likes it or not. But the risk is great: If caught, Agent Carter could be targeted as a traitor and spend the rest of her days in prisonâ¦or worse.â âNow is Not the Endâ was written by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely and directed by Louis DâEsposito. The second episode, titled âBridge and Tunnel,â is officially described as follows: âHoward Starkâs deadliest weapon has fallen into enemy hands, and only Agent Carter can recover it. But can she do so before her undercover mission is discovered by SSR Chief Dooley and Agent Thompson?â âBridge and Tunnelâ was written by Eric Pearson and directed by Joseph Russo. Starring Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter, Chad Michael Murray as SSR Agent Jack Thompson, Enver Gjokaj as SSR Agent Daniel Sousa, James DâArcy as Edwin Jarvis, and Shea Whigham as SSR Chief Roger Dooley, âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ is executive produced by Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Chris Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis DâEsposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee and Jeph Loeb. âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ is produced by ABC Studios and Marvel Television and is set to premiere January 6, 2015 on ABC. JUPITER ASCENDING\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow have four new posters (via IGN) for Andy and Lana Wachowskiâs Jupiter Ascending, which hits theaters on February 6, 2015. Starring Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, Douglas Booth, Tuppence Middleton, Doona Bae, James DâArcy and Tim Pigott-Smith, the film follows Jupiter Jones (Kunis), a young woman born under a night sky, with signs predicting that she was destined for great things.

Only when Caine (Tatum), a genetically engineered ex-military hunter, arrives on Earth to track her down does Jupiter begin to glimpse the fate that has been waiting for her all along?her genetic signature marks her as next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos. AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. NEWS\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter brings word today that Golden Globe-nominated actor Blair Underwood has signed on to appear in âMarvelâs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.â as none other than Melinda Mayâs (Ming-Na Wen) estranged ex-husband, Dr. Andrew Garner.

Season Two will return in March following the conclusion of âMarvelâs Agent Carter.â\n\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 11, 2014\n\nMAD MAX: FURY ROAD\n\nIf Mad Max: Fury Road wasn't already on your must-watch movies of 2015 list, get ready to make some room. For a long time, it felt like it would be a miracle if we ever even saw a fourth Mad Max film. The project experienced delay after delay, and even when it finally got down to filming the odds seemed against it. Now the film is real, and it's awaiting its summer 2015 release. That the movie actually exists after a quarter-century of development hell is kind of amazing. That it looks this jaw-droppingly good is astounding. The Fury Road footage we saw back in July may have been the most thrilling part of the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con, and now Mad Max is back in what Warner Bros. has deemed the \"Official Theatrical Teaser Trailer.\" Like the Comic-Con footage, it features a lot of car-crashing action goodness, but it also goes further into full-on operatic territory, giving us a few character moments to go along with all that demolition, and adding a whole lot of madness to the Mad Max vibe. It's got big guns, big cars, big stunts, big wasteland body armor and a sense of impish audacity that makes us want to watch it over and over again. Check it out, and be sure to go full-screen for this one. In fact, if you can beam this trailer up to the largest TV screen you have available, it's probably worth it. And while we're here, check out a new official synopsis for the film, released yesterday (via Dark Horizons) Haunted by his turbulent past, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) believes the best way to survive is to wander alone. Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa (Charlize Theron). They are escaping a Citadel tyrannized by the Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), from whom something irreplaceable has been taken. Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high-octane Road War that follows. Mad Max: Fury Road hits theaters at full throttle on May 15, 2015. PROMETHEUS/BLADE RUNNER SEQUELS\n\nThere are sequels to Prometheus and Blade Runner coming. Sure, they aren't coming anytime soon, but heck if Ridley Scott isn't talking about them anyway. Prometheus left us on a bit of a cliffhanger. Most of the cast died, a xenomorph-like alien was birthed, and Doctor Elizabeth Shaw was still in search of the Architects with David's head in tow. So what happens next? According to Ridley Scott in an interview with MTV, you have to more or less pick up where you left off, with David's dilemma of needing a body, and the danger that represents: You can't have a person go off into the galaxy and have a person who's still got his head off. Once that head goes back on, he's really dangerous, but he's also very seductive, so maybe he'll persuade her to put the head back on. That's your Prometheus tidbit. As for the Blade Runner sequel, Scott says, \"It's written and ready to go.\" He also said he showed it to Harrison Ford, who supposedly called it \"the best thing I've ever read.\" Now, that's a lot of promoting. The meat of Scott's statement comes not from what the new Blade Runner will be, but what it won't be -- a reinvention. It's very relevant to what happened in the first one. I'm not just doing a sequel with lots of action to how how [much] farther we can go with the special effects, because you can't really. Blade Runner we kind of landed on a somehow very credible future. It's very difficult to change that because it's been so influential. That's a huge relief for Blade Runner fans. The world-building of that story was so perfect, it would be insane to tamper with it. Then again, Prometheus is kind of a reinvention of Alien, and in this same interview Scott responds to that film's detractors by saying \"#$% you very much.\" So, we'll just have to wait and see. THE CUCKOO'S CALLING\n\nBBC One announced today that Robert Galbraithâs Cormoran Strike novels will be adapted for a new television series, produced by BrontÃ« Film and TV. âThe Cuckooâs Callingâ (published by Little, Brown) is the first in the Cormoran Strike series and J.K. Rowlingâs first crime novel written under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. âThe Cuckooâs Callingâ was published to critical acclaim in 2013 and went on to be a global bestseller, followed in 2014 by âThe Silkworm.â Rowling will collaborate on the project, with the number and length of episodes to be decided once the creative adaptation process has formally begun. This marks a continuation of the BBCâs relationship with BrontÃ« Film and TV and J.K. Rowling. BrontÃ« is also making J.K. Rowlingâs âThe Casual Vacancy,â a three-part serial which will be aired on BBC One in February 2015. Neil Blair, Chair of BrontÃ« says: âWeâre delighted to be bringing these best-selling novels to the screen and to be working once again alongside the BBC.â Danny Cohen, Director of BBC Television says : âItâs a wonderful coup for BBC Television to be bringing J.K. Rowlingâs latest books to the screen. With the rich character of Cormoran Strike at their heart, these dramas will be event television across the world.â AGENT CARTER\n\nMarvel Entertainment and ABC have debuted a brand new poster for the upcoming âMarvelâs Agent Carterâ. Itâs 1946 and peace has dealt Agent Peggy Carter a serious blow as she finds herself marginalized when the men return home from fighting abroad.
