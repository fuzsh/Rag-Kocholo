        "text": "SAN SEBASTIAN — Alicante’s Ciudad de la Luz film and TV studios have hosted shoots worth Euro 212 million ($287 million) in their first two years of operation, general manager Jose Maria Rodriguez Galan reported Sunday.\n\nBankrolled by Valencia’s regional government and designed by Gary Bastien, the Ciudad has so far welcomed 19 feature films and one TV drama.\n\nDonald Petrie’s romantic comedy “My Life in Ruins,” the studios’ first U.S. shoot, rolled from early September. Tom Hanks’ Playtone Films, 26 Films and Valencia-based KanZaman are producing the pic, which toplines Nia Vardalos (“My Big Fat Greek Wedding”).\n\nOther big European co-productions, such as the $108 million “Asterix at the Olympic Games” and Jean-Jacques Annaud’s $48.6 million comedy “His Majesty Minor,” have also shot there.\n\nThe Ciudad is now beginning second-phase construction, which includes a 17,542 sq. ft. super stage — with an 27 acre backlot, three more soundstages from 1,968 to 3,280 sq. ft. in size, and a 9,842 sq. ft. administrative building.\n\nOnce finished, it will be able to host several mid-to-big shoots simultaneously.\n\n“We’ll continue to grow our talent base and facilities,” said Rodriguez.\n\nThe aim’s to see nearly 100 facilities houses setting up around or in the Ciudad in four years’ time, he added. Panavision has set up offices at the Ciudad. Kodak will open a boutique lab there in October.\n\nThe Ciudad’s third phase includes Europe’s only custom-built surface deep tank. The complex will be completed in 24-30 months."
