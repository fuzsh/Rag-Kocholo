Playtone (stylized on-screen as PLAY•TONE; a.k.a. Playtone Productions and The Playtone Company) is an American film and television production company established in 1998 by actor Tom Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman.

It was named after the fictional record company of the same name in the 1996 film That Thing You Do!, written and directed by Hanks; it also uses the same company logo, typically revealed on-screen with a brief instrumental snippet of the titular song itself, with some variations in each film depending on subject manner. The success of the film served as a spring-board to launch an actual Playtone Records label. Playtone has had an exclusive television development deal with HBO since the company was formed. Over the course of that time, Playtone's projects for HBO have won 46 Emmy Awards, while garnering 113 Emmy Award nominations.
