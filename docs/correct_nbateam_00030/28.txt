Richard Jefferson played for the San Antonio Spurs from 2009-12 and during that time, it was not enough for the city to leave a great impression on him.

During a food spot with Men's Health, Jefferson joked about Tim Duncan being someone he'd hate to play with again.

However, when he was asked about the worst cities he played in during his time in the NBA, Jefferson had this to say about San Antonio.

Worst place I had to play? Well, San Antonio is a dump.

San Antonio fans just hate me no matter how many nice things I say about them and I am really getting to the point where I am like 'Screw off'." Like dude, I can only say so many positive things about you before you all keep killing me.

When he talked about playing in Milwaukee, he once again took a jab at San Antonio.

Milwaukee is like San Antonio but with bad weather.

The Spurs and Jefferson parted way in 2012 as he was dealt to the Warriors for Stephen Jackson.

During his time in San Antonio, it did not work out the way many hoped and it wasn't a great fit. His best season with the Spurs was in 2009-10 when he posted 12.3 points per game and 4.4 rebounds per game.

He may have been teasing but as for his opinion of San Antonio, joking or not, the city would disagree.

From the famed Riverwalk, the historic Alamo to the food and people, San Antonio is a beautiful city many call home.
