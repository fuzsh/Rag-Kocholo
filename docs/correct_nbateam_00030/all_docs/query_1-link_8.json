Well, San Antonio is a dump.\n\nSan Antonio fans just hate me no matter how many nice things I say about them and I am really getting to the point where I am like 'Screw off'.\" Like dude, I can only say so many positive things about you before you all keep killing me.\n\nWhen he talked about playing in Milwaukee, he once again took a jab at San Antonio.\n\nMilwaukee is like San Antonio but with bad weather.\n\nThe Spurs and Jefferson parted way in 2012 as he was dealt to the Warriors for Stephen Jackson.\n\nDuring his time in San Antonio, it did not work out the way many hoped and it wasn't a great fit. His best season with the Spurs was in 2009-10 when he posted 12.3 points per game and 4.4 rebounds per game.\n\nHe may have been teasing but as for his opinion of San Antonio, joking or not, the city would disagree.\n\nFrom the famed Riverwalk, the historic Alamo to the food and people, San Antonio is a beautiful city many call home.\n\nWhat say you Spurs fans about Jefferson's comments? Let me know at ."
