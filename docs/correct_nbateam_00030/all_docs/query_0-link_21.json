        "text": "Players may win championships, but front offices build dynasties.\n\nIn the past ten years, perhaps no NBA team has been a more successful dynasty than the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nI'd probably get a fervent argument from Lakers' fans, but here's why the Spurs are superior.\n\nL.A. pulled off the \"three-peat\", at the beginning of the decade, but then went seven more years without adding another trophy to the mantle.\n\nSan Antonio has had sustained success throughout the same span. The Spurs won the NBA title in 1999, 2003, 2005, and 2007. That, to me, is far more impressive than what L.A. has accomplished.\n\nWhat has made San Antonio better than the rest is the front office's uncanny ability to keep the core pieces, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, in place and fill in with outstanding role players.\n\nThe names are endless: Robert Horry, Bruce Bowen, Michael Finley, Jacque Vaughn, Speedy Claxton, Steve Smith, and the list goes on.\n\nEach of those players, along with many others, helped the Spurs maintain a level of excellence that has been unrivaled.\n\nNone of those players were incredible, at least when they joined the Spurs, but they didn't have to be with the strong triumvirate of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili.\n\nAnd they continued to build on that foundation by trading for Richard Jefferson, who is entering his eighth career season.\n\nOf all the moves that the Spurs' front office has moved through the years, this is probably the biggest of them all.\n\nThis was an especially good move, considering that Ginobili missed a great deal of time due to injury. His absence really hurt the Spurs this year, but Jefferson could pick up right where Manu left off."
