        "text": "(Editor’s note: Welcome back to The Athletic NBA 75. We’re re-running our top 40 players to count down every day from Sept. 8-Oct. 17, the day before the opening of the 2022-23 NBA season. This piece was first published on Jan. 3, 2022.)\n\nThe last time Kawhi Leonard played in a basketball game was Game 4 of the 2021 Western Conference semifinals against the Utah Jazz. Leonard amassed an impressive stat line for the LA Clippers in a 118-104 win that evened the series — and he did so by doing a bit of everything:\n\n31 points, making 10 of 13 free throws and highlighted by a dunk on Jazz center Derrick Favors right at the rim\n\nSeven rebounds\n\nThree assists, with only two turnovers\n\nTwo steals and a blocked shot\n\n3 of 7 from 3-point range\n\nDespite leaving the game with a right knee injury after being fouled in transition, Leonard remained focused. And he made that clear in a way that only he can.\n\n“I don’t care about the Western Conference finals,” Leonard said with the Clippers two wins away from the star-crossed franchise’s first-ever conference finals appearance. “I’m trying to win a championship. This is, that’s the next step. But I’m not even looking at that. I didn’t even know we took criticism. I don’t know what’s going on in the outside world.”\n\nIt would be the last time Leonard would address the media after a game. The morning before the Clippers took the series lead in Utah, a series that the Clippers ultimately won to make their first Western Conference finals, it was revealed that Leonard had suffered a serious knee injury. Without their star player, the Clippers would lose to the Phoenix Suns in six games. Leonard would undergo surgery to repair a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, which delayed the start of his 11th NBA season.\n\nBut Leonard is already a legend. Despite his injury, the Clippers hold him in high regard and proved that by re-signing him to a four-year, $176 million contract. A blue-ribbon panel of current and former NBA players, coaches, general managers, team and league executives, WNBA legends, sportswriters and broadcasters named Leonard to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in October. On The Athletic’s Top 75, Leonard checks in at No. 34.\n\nLeonard is one of only 11 active players to make the NBA’s 76-member anniversary team (76 because of a tie in the voting), and he did so as the 15th selection in the 2011 NBA Draft from San Diego State. Even as his NBA career continues, Leonard took a moment to acknowledge the extraordinary accomplishment.\n\n“I mean, it’s great, you know,” Leonard told The Athletic about being honored as one of the league’s greatest players of all time. “Shows the foundation of work I put in is paying off.”\n\nLeonard’s basketball story began where he is now. He was born on June 29, 1991, in Los Angeles, before moving to Moreno Valley with his mother, Kim Robertson. Leonard worked with his father, Mark Leonard, who owned a car wash in Compton.\n\nAs a freshman during the 2005-06 academic year, Leonard attended Canyon Springs High in Moreno Valley. He played receiver on the football team but didn’t play basketball because he missed the tryouts. Instead, the 14-year-old Leonard would play AAU basketball for Team Eleate in Riverside, Calif., in the spring. That’s where he met skills trainer Clint Parks, who co-founded the team with former Pepperdine point guard Marvin Lea.\n\n“Long arms. Huge hands,” Parks said of what he remembered of Leonard in his teens. “Always had the huge hands. Was a great athlete. Was raw, basketball-wise. Wasn’t as sharp as one of these younger phenoms you see today. But just as far as playing hard and competing, always had that down from the beginning.”\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Leonard transferred to Martin Luther King High in Riverside for his last two years. In January of his junior year, his father was fatally shot at his car wash on a Friday night.\n\n“The commitment that comes from his mom and his dad, especially, I would say, a lot of his dad,” Parks said of Leonard’s work ethic. “Especially working with his dad, growing up at the car wash and stuff, just having an understanding of putting in work, you know, rolling up your sleeves, not being afraid of that.”\n\nLeonard would play in a game the day after his father was killed, against Dominguez High at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. Leonard’s King team lost, 68-60, despite Leonard scoring 15 points. Afterward, he broke down and cried with his mother.\n\n“I try to play as hard as I can each night,” Leonard would tell the Los Angeles Times later in his junior season. “That’s what my father wanted me to do.”\n\nLeonard’s teams at King would finish 32-3 his junior year and 30-3 his senior year, but he wasn’t named a McDonald’s High School All-American.\n\n“He was California Mr. Basketball, but at the same time still underrated, undervalued, didn’t have a bunch of offers,” Parks said. “He only played in like a local All-Star game, which was like the Inland Empire versus San Diego, down in Palm Springs. He just never had the recognition that he deserved, partially being from Inland Empire, being from Moreno Valley. We never get the respect that L.A. hoopers usually get.”\n\nWhen Leonard got to San Diego State, the objective was clear and direct.\n\n“Get out of here as quickly as possible,” Leonard told The Athletic. “You know, try to get drafted, pretty much.”\n\nLeonard would average 12.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game as a freshman in 2009-10. In the Mountain West Conference Tournament final against UNLV, Leonard finished with 16 points and 21 rebounds. But the feedback from the NBA’s Undergraduate Advisory Committee suggested that Leonard would not be a first-round pick and would possibly go undrafted.\n\n“You know, I was realistic, though,” Leonard said. “So, I gave myself two years. From there, you know, try to be the greatest player I could be. I want to be in those conversations when it’s all said and done.”\n\nLeonard would come back for his sophomore year, and San Diego State went from 25-9 to 34-3. His averages improved to 15.5 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists to go with 1.4 steals per game.\n\n“Trevor Ariza was working out at San Diego State at that time in the offseason, so that summer, (Leonard) got to bump up against him and work out with him and play one-on-one and stuff,” Parks said. “That helped his game a lot going into his sophomore year. And then, sophomore year, he already knew, ‘I’m out after this year.’ So he was just on one the whole season. Guaranteed double-double.”\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs were coming off of a 2010-11 season that saw them finish 61-21. Despite earning the West’s top seed, the Spurs were upset in the first round by the Memphis Grizzlies. It was the third straight season San Antonio failed to make the conference finals.\n\nThe Spurs’ first-round pick in the 2011 NBA Draft was 29th overall, which they ultimately used on point guard Cory Joseph. But San Antonio also made a trade in the draft, shipping point guard George Hill to the Indiana Pacers for two second-round picks (one of which was Davis Bertans) and Indiana’s first-round pick at 15th overall. Leonard was the 15th pick of the draft. Soon, he was headed to the basketball factory that was Gregg Popovich’s Spurs.\n\n“We liked him in the draft because we traded George Hill for him,” Popovich told The Athletic when the Spurs visited Los Angeles on Dec. 20. “It killed us because we were in love with George, and he was playing well for us. But we wanted to get bigger at the three spot. And just watching him, there was just kind of a pace about him and aggressiveness; he wasn’t a shooter yet or anything like that, but he was rugged.\n\n“And obviously, he had the body for it. And very honestly, we just thought, ‘Bruce Bowen.’ Maybe we can make this guy a defender with that body, that length and all that kind of thing. This guy can be a stopper, and we’ll work on his offense.”\n\nRichard Jefferson would be the starter at small forward to begin Leonard’s rookie season, which was delayed by a lockout. But by midseason, Jefferson was traded to the Golden State Warriors (with T.J. Ford and a 2012 first-round pick) for Stephen Jackson. But Jackson wasn’t coming in to start; that role would be Leonard’s for the rest of his time in San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs would win their last 10 regular-season games and first 10 postseason games before losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games in the 2012 Western Conference finals. Leonard would be named to the NBA’s All-Rookie First Team.\n\nWith Leonard entrenched as a starter, he would begin to expand his game in his second season, improving his scoring from 7.9 to 11.9 points per game. Leonard was a 37.6 percent 3-point shooter as a rookie and stabilized at 37.4 percent in his second season, but his attempts per game jumped from 1.7 per game to 3.0 per game. Though he missed 25 games due to injury, Leonard would average 13.5 points and 9.0 rebounds in the 2013 postseason, as the Spurs returned to the NBA Finals for the first time in six years.\n\nLeonard worked with a Spurs player development team, consisting of assistant coaches Chip Engelland, Chad Forcier and, eventually, Will Hardy. Popovich saw the improvement that came from Leonard’s work, and even with mainstays Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili still playing a prominent role, Popovich gained confidence that Leonard could assume a greater role over time.\n\n“He worked his ass off with those guys,” Popovich said of Leonard’s work with player development. “Ballhandling, pick-and-roll, shooting a 3-pointer, stepbacks, all that sort of stuff. He came before practice, he stayed after practice. And as time went on, toward the end of his time with us, the two Miami series is when we kind of opened it up for him. Like, ‘You’re going to be the guy now, because Timmy is getting older, Manu is getting older, Tony is getting older.’ And he had a great series the year we lost in ’13, and then he was the MVP the next year, in ’14.”\n\nWhen Leonard averaged 17.8 points and 6.4 rebounds opposite then-Miami Heat reigning Finals MVP LeBron James in the 2014 NBA Finals, a series the Spurs won decisively in five games, it was a moment of culmination for the player Leonard saw himself as from the jump. Leonard wasn’t yet an All-Star, but he made the NBA All-Defense Second Team. He ended his third NBA season as the Finals MVP on a team with Duncan, Parker and Ginobili. Leonard was a leader on Popovich’s fifth championship team.\n\n“I’ve always been a guy that won and wanted to win,” Leonard says. “But being around Gregg Popovich and those guys, they showed me how to win in the NBA, I guess I would say, with me having no experience. But it’s good and bad that come with that. I was a guy looking at trying to be, you know, having 20 (points per game) my first year. Getting the ball or just being more involved. You know, so it’s kind of, what do you call it … kind of like lowering my pride a little bit. So we can make something, a bigger accomplishment.”\n\nEven after winning Finals MVP in 2014, Leonard still wasn’t recognized as an All-Star, and the Spurs would lose in seven games to the Clippers in the 2015 conference quarterfinals. But Leonard earned the first of two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2015 after leading the NBA with 2.3 steals per game. Leonard is still the only perimeter player (point guard, shooting guard or small forward) to be named the league’s best defender since 2004, when Metta Sandiford-Artest (then Ron Artest) won the award.\n\nHow dominant and unique is Leonard as a defender? Through 10 NBA seasons, he has 1,013 steals — and only 988 personal fouls. The only other player in NBA history to have at least 1,000 steals and fewer than 1,000 personal fouls through their first 10 NBA seasons is Jimmy Butler.\n\nIt took until the 2015-16 season, Duncan’s final in the NBA, for Leonard to be selected as an All-Star. And Leonard wasn’t a fringe All-Star when he made it; he repeated as Defensive Player of the Year, becoming only the third perimeter player to accomplish such a feat, joining Sidney Moncrief (1983 and ’84) and Dennis Rodman (1990 and ’91). Leonard graduated to that 20-point scorer in 2015-16, averaging 21.2 points per game on 50.6 percent shooting from the field. He made his first of five All-Star teams and was a First Team All-NBA selection, as well.\n\nLeonard was even better in 2016-17, the first season of the post-Duncan era, as he averaged 25.5 points per game and led the Spurs to a second straight season of more than 60 wins. And Leonard would even show leadership qualities that would not become wholly apparent until after he was gone.\n\n“That’s my guy,” said current Spurs point guard Dejounte Murray, who was drafted by San Antonio in 2016. “We got a real off-the-floor relationship. He texted me right now, that’s the type of relationship we have. One thing about him, he works hard. When I got drafted, that’s one person I connected to right away. He took me under his wing. That was somebody — I always loved defense — but one thing he told me that stuck for my rookie year was, ‘Go make a defensive team; you’re going to get on the floor playing defense. That’s how you’re going to make your name.’ And that’s what stuck with me, and that’s what I did.”\n\nThough his tenure in San Antonio would end unceremoniously because of a sprained left ankle in the 2017 Western Conference finals and right quadriceps tendinopathy that limited his 2017-18 season to nine games, Leonard established himself as a winner in San Antonio — just as he had in high school and college.\n\n“I’m a team player, so, you know, I took it in,” Leonard said of his time in San Antonio. “A lot of those years were difficult. … Go to high school, San Diego State, that’s who I was. In high school, I played in the No. 1 division in the nation. That’s just always who I was: wanting to win, get the team to a better, next step. By saying that, you know, got to make myself a better player to help my team do that.”\n\n“I’m a fun guy. I love the game of basketball. It’s just more questions you’ll have to ask me in order for me to tell you about myself. I just can’t give you a whole spiel. I don’t even know where you’re sitting at …”\n\nPerhaps people needed a reminder of what Leonard could do when the Spurs traded him and Danny Green in July 2018 to the Toronto Raptors for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 protected first-round pick. Leonard arrived in Toronto with the option to decline the final year of his contract after the 2018-19 season. Leonard, however, would not be able to play in the second game of back-to-backs for the entire 2018-19 season because of a right quad injury. And DeRozan was a Raptors stalwart who helped lead Toronto to the best record in the Eastern Conference over his last five seasons there, albeit with no Finals appearances and only one conference finals appearance to show for it.\n\nLeonard didn’t look at his arrival to Toronto as an opportunity to revitalize his career. It was merely another step in what his singular focus has always been.\n\n“The same as any other year, if I’m playing consistently or not,” Leonard said about his approach to the 2018-19 season. “Just make an impact, a great impact on a team and try to win a championship. That’s it.”\n\nLeonard made it back to the All-Star game as a Raptor but was only named All-NBA Second Team, in part due to the load management program that limited him to 60 games out of 82. But he made an impression on his new team with his unwavering habits and work ethic.\n\n“I learned that he had a really good gauge of who he was and what he could do,” said Raptors head coach Nick Nurse, who had replaced 2018 NBA Coach of the Year Dwane Casey. “The things I remember are going through game plans and coverages and matchups and timing of when he would go guard the best player or parts of the game when he wouldn’t when he would go back in.\n\n“There were so many little things, I mean, I’d just kind of always remember that fourth quarter when he’s out, and you’d say, ‘Hey it’s about time to roll.’ And he’d say, ‘I need another minute and a half,’ or something like that. And I would kind of look up and say, ‘All right, I hope this minute and a half, I hope we’re still here!’\n\n“He’d take that minute and a half, and it would be down to about six and a half to go in a game, and he’d go out and make every offensive rebound. I mean, his guy wouldn’t score, and he’d score and get key rebounds at the defensive. … I mean, he kind of knew that he had about six and a half minutes of great play left, and that’s what you’d usually get.”\n\nLeonard’s 2019 postseason could be argued as a determining factor toward his place on the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team. After the Raptors dispatched the Orlando Magic in an Eastern Conference first-round series, Butler’s 76ers forced a Game 7 in Toronto. On Leonard’s 39th field goal attempt of the game, the ball bounced on the rim before dropping in for the first buzzer-beater to win a Game 7 in NBA history. He finished with 41 points; the only players with more points to finish a game with a postseason buzzer-beater are Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Damian Lillard.\n\nFacing a 2-0 hole in the Eastern Conference finals, Leonard would switch onto 2019 MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to change the series. The Raptors won in six games to advance to the NBA Finals, with Leonard averaging 29.3 points, 10.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 2.5 steals, 1.3 blocks and 2.3 3s in Games 3-6. Antetokounmpo was held to 20.5 points per game in the final four games of the series, compared to 27.0 points in Games 1 and 2.\n\n“It was like watching Kobe or MJ as a kid; like, that’s how I felt when I was watching him in the playoffs,” Parks says. “Especially against the Sixers. He couldn’t miss, it was nothing he couldn’t do. And then even watching him against the Bucks, after being down 2-0 and just watching him take Giannis’ heart.”\n\nLeonard culminated his return to prominence by leading the Raptors with 28.5 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.0 steals in the 2019 NBA Finals, earning MVP honors after Toronto defeated the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors in six games. Leonard became the first player to earn Finals MVP awards in both conferences, a feat since accomplished by James.\n\nThen, in a move that shifted the balance in the NBA, Leonard eschewed joining James and Anthony Davis with the Lakers and instead became the first Finals MVP to join a new team the following season as joined the Clippers in 2019.\n\nLeonard continues to add to his accolades in Los Angeles, even though his first two seasons have had difficult endings: the blown 3-1 lead in the 2020 NBA restart against the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals that forced the Clippers to move on from head coach Doc Rivers, and the knee injury that kept Leonard from playing in the franchise’s first Western Conference finals under new head coach Tyronn Lue.\n\nEven with those setbacks, Leonard won the 2020 NBA All-Star MVP award. And after a second straight All-NBA Second Team selection in Leonard’s first season with the Clippers, Leonard would get back to the All-NBA First Team in 2020-21, averaging a career-best 5.2 assists per game and only 2.0 turnovers per game.\n\n“I think, from being a 15th pick to being top 75, that means a lot,” said Lue when Leonard was named to the 75th Anniversary Team. “It’s a tribute to his hard work and dedication and things that he’s been able to achieve in his career. So just very happy for him.”\n\nLeonard is now entering the sixth month of his rehab from knee surgery. And based on those who know him best, there should be no surprises when he regains form as one of the best to ever play the game.\n\n“He’ll be fine, too, with his rehab, because Kawhi works hard,” said Murray, who has overcome a torn right ACL suffered in the 2018 preseason. “The whole world knows that. And he loves the game of basketball, so it’ll be fun.”\n\nAdded Leonard: “I’m just trying to get back on the court. So that’s my main focus. But I’m glad the NBA, commission, media and fans see my hard work and, you know, I was able to make that class.”\n\nCareer stats#: G: 576, Pts.: 19.2, Reb.: 6.4, Ast.: 2.9, FG%: 49.3, FT%: 85.8, Win Shares: 83.3, PER: 23.4\n\nThe Athletic NBA 75 Panel points: 597 | Hollinger GOAT Points: 162.0\n\nAchievements: Five-time All-NBA, five-time All-Star, NBA champ (’14, ’19), Finals MVP (’14, ’19), Defensive Player of the Year (’15, ’16) Steals champ (’15), NBA 75th Anniversary team (’21)\n\n#Through the 2020-21 season\n\n(Illustration: Wes McCabe / The Athletic; Photo: Andrew D.
