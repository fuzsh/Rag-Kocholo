        "text": "An estimated 300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide.\n\nRichard Jefferson, a 16-year NBA veteran and key cog for the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers, is one of those people.\n\nJefferson’s successful career, now in its twilight, has seen its fair share of obstacles. Over the last quarter-century, his battles with severe asthma have sent him to the hospital, hindered his on-court performance and, a few years back, almost led him to retire.\n\n\"The first time I was hospitalized with a severe asthma attack, I think I was in fifth or sixth grade, overnight in the hospital with tubes,\" Jefferson told USA TODAY Sports over the phone Thursday. \"I actually almost had a collapsed lung when I was a kid just because I struggled to breathe so much.\"\n\nAs Jefferson grew older, his symptoms lessened. He went on to play three collegiate seasons at Arizona, which he describes as \"one of the best places to live\" with asthma, due to its climate. But after he was drafted in 2001 (13th overall by Houston, traded to New Jersey), the rigors of the NBA travel schedule, paired with the ever-changing climates of different cities, triggered more asthma-related issues.\n\nJefferson attempted numerous treatments, from Ventolin inhalers to prednisone to nebulizers, but had trouble coping with some of the side effects. Later on in his career, after being traded to the San Antonio Spurs in 2009, he began to search for more long-term solutions.\n\n\"People were like, 'Oh, after you see a player play for 10 years and his numbers start to drop and his athleticism starts to drop, you just think that that's just the normal decline.' I knew it was something different,\" Jefferson said. \"... I knew that something needed to change. Just being on medicine and doing this stuff wasn't doing it.\"\n\nThat's when he discovered bronchial thermoplasty — an outpatient, non-drug procedure (which was approved by the FDA in 2010) where a tube, which is inserted into the airway, transmits thermal energy to help reduce smooth muscle and make breathing easier. He underwent the procedure in the summer of 2012, shortly after being traded to Golden State. But it didn't mark the end of his struggles.\n\nHe dealt with back and calf injuries the next season, played a career-low 10.1 minutes per game (and averaged a career-low 3.1 points) in a limited role, and at one point, contemplated retirement.\n\n\"I thought to myself, 'Hey ... if this is how it ends, then you had a great career.' \"\n\nThen things started looking up. In the summer of 2013, Jefferson was traded to Utah, where he says he \"really, really noticed the difference.\" His minutes increased (to 27 a night), as did his production (up to 10.1 points).\n\n\"After that procedure, combining it with changing my diet and doing a ton of other things differently with my body, whether it was yoga or playing volleyball or just being really, really active, I just noticed a huge difference,\" Jefferson said.\n\nFive years later, Jefferson — who still suffers from asthma, though he says his symptoms are much less severe — credits bronchial thermoplasty with extending his NBA career.\n\n\"Everybody is different, but the progression (from the procedure) has continued over the last few years and I think my success and how I've been able to play is a result of that.\"\n\nNow, Jefferson, 36, is teaming up with Boston Scientific to help educate those who suffer from severe asthma, working as a paid spokesperson for the Alair System — the device used for bronchial thermoplasty procedures.\n\n\"The partnership with (Boston Scientific) is purely based on how much I think this can help people and how much this can help asthmatics,\" Jefferson said. \"If I can be the face of something that can help people, I think that is an important opportunity that you can't pass up.\""
