        "text": "The story line grows more irresistible with every game. The\n\nwonder boy from the foreign land confidently directs the\n\nveterans with a wink and a smile. At the same time, he embraces\n\nthe showdown with the All-Star who many believe will take his\n\njob next season. The personal touches are beguiling too. The\n\nsly PEOPLE's-50-most-beautiful-people grin that reveals no\n\ntrace of fear. The delightful, French-accented references to\n\nSan Antonio Spurs teammate Tim Duncan that come out as \"Teemy\"\n\nor \"Teem.\" Is he married? (No.) Still available? (Won't say.)\n\nDoes he like French wine and goat cheese more than the Alamo\n\nCity's Tex-Mex cuisine? (Most definitely.)\n\nThrough the first three games of an NBA Finals that was more\n\nbare-knuckle brawl than high-caliber ball, Tony Parker--21 years\n\nold, 6'2\" and 180 pounds (maybe)--had cast a larger shadow than\n\neither two-time MVP Teemy or the New Jersey Nets' Jason Kidd, the\n\nsoon-to-be free agent who was expected to demonstrate, even to\n\nthose amoureaux de Parker, how point guard is supposed to be\n\nplayed. It's not that Kidd, who learned his hoops on the rugged\n\nplaygrounds of Oakland, was bad; he was sensational (30 points,\n\nseven rebounds) in the Nets' 87-85 Game 2 victory last Friday in\n\nSan Antonio. It's just that Parker, a product of the National\n\nInstitute of Sports and Physical Education, an elite sports\n\nschool in a verdant section of Paris, was better.\n\nOn Sunday night, as the series continued with Game 3 at\n\nContinental Airlines Arena and the Tony Awards were handed out\n\nacross the Hudson, San Antonio's Tony assumed the leading role in\n\nwhat at times resembled a midseason yawner between the Cleveland\n\nCavaliers and the Atlanta Hawks that included a 27-point second\n\nquarter, the lowest total for a period in Finals history. Parker\n\nscored a game-high 26 points, handed out six assists, turned the\n\nball over only once and for the most part kept his slender body\n\nin front of Kidd (12 points on 6-of-19 shooting, 11 assists, four\n\nturnovers) in the Spurs' 84-79 victory, which gave them a 2-1\n\nseries lead. Four nights earlier, in Game 1 at the SBC Center,\n\nParker had also outplayed Kidd in a 101-89 win.\n\nLooking at Parker from the perspective of 14 NBA seasons, the\n\nlast of which is upon him, Spurs center David Robinson notes an\n\nuncanny resemblance to another teammate. \"I see Tim,\" says the\n\nAdmiral, who after an inspired Game 1 (14 points, four blocked\n\nshots) had limited impact. \"Tony's a patient guy, like Tim, a guy\n\nwho learns from his mistakes, a guy who, like Tim, won't get\n\ncaught up worrying about the media.\"\n\nRobinson refers, of course, to the will-Kidd-get-a-free-agent-\n\noffer-from-San-Antonio-this-summer question, which had already\n\nbeen repackaged more ways than Law & Order. After Game 3 a\n\nreporter asked Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, \"Could you talk\n\nabout your point-guard situation two or three years down the\n\nroad?\" Popovich smiled and replied, \"I think point guard is a\n\nvery important position. We should have a point guard.\" Parker\n\nwould rather hunker down over a plate of nachos and an orange\n\nsoda--this is a man who dared order room-service creme brulee\n\nduring the Western Conference final in Dallas (and got sick\n\nfrom it)--than deal with the question. But early in the Finals\n\nhe arrived at the perfect answer: \"If I was the general manager,\n\nI would keep me.\"\n\nDespite Parker's excellence, there was no certainty that the win\n\non Sunday would turn the tide irrevocably in San Antonio's favor.\n\nAfter all, the Nets had played poorly in Game 1 and bounced back\n\nin Game 2, and the Spurs were too unreliable on offense (they had\n\n38 turnovers in Games 2 and 3) to suggest a juggernaut like the\n\nLos Angeles Lakers of last year, who swept New Jersey in the\n\nFinals.\n\nWhile the Nets did a credible job on Duncan (unstoppable in Game\n\n1, with 32 points and 20 rebounds; sluggish in Game 2, with 19\n\npoints and seven missed free throws; solid in Game 3, with 21\n\npoints, 16 rebounds and seven assists), they have to find a way\n\nto stymie Parker, who was almost the sole responsibility of Kidd,\n\na three-time All-NBA defender. Though he was concise in his\n\npraise of Parker (\"Tony's a real good player,\" \"He's handled\n\nhimself well,\" etc.), the 30-year-old Kidd showed some signs of\n\ncrankiness after Game 3. \"There's no pressure on us because we're\n\nnot even supposed to compete,\" he said. \"We're just supposed to\n\nlay down.\" That was a reference to the Spurs' being heavy\n\nfavorites entering the Finals, supposedly superior in most areas\n\nexcept for, well, point guard.\n\nParker and Kidd offer a fascinating contrast. The 6'4\", 212-pound\n\nKidd gets himself into the paint using a combination of muscle\n\nand guile, while Parker can do it on pure speed. Other than the\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers' Allen Iverson, Parker may have the quickest\n\nfirst step in the game. Kidd is a true set-the-table point,\n\npartly because he is a below-average shooter; he made only 21 of\n\n60 attempts in the first three games. Parker, despite his classic\n\npoint-guard size, often functions as a shooting guard--partly\n\nbecause he's such a good shooter, partly because the offense\n\nprimarily runs through the 7-foot Duncan in the post and partly\n\nbecause the Spurs need Parker to score. (Through Game 3 they were\n\n26-2 this season when he racked up more than 20 points.) As\n\nMavericks assistant coach Avery Johnson puts it, Parker is \"kind\n\nof a halfway-between guard.\"\n\nIn the first Finals featuring two franchises sprung from the womb\n\nof the ABA, designated team legends Julius Erving of the Nets and\n\nGeorge Gervin of the Spurs were ubiquitous, but it's safe to say\n\nthey didn't see much that reminded them of the offense-oriented\n\nstyle of those red-white-and-blue-ball days. The Spurs prepared\n\nlong and well to slow New Jersey's fast break, which produced 51\n\npoints over the first three games, a palatable sum for Popovich.\n\nDuring pre-Finals scrimmages he would suddenly yell, \"Turnover!\"\n\nand the first team would have to scramble back; he also allowed\n\nthe second team to start its offense without taking the ball\n\nout-of-bounds after made shots.\n\nThe Spurs were willing to sacrifice offensive rebounds (they had\n\n33 compared with the Nets' 42 in the first three games) to get\n\nback quickly and prevent Kidd from going into the paint and\n\nfinding a teammate storming in from the wing. Thus he was stuck\n\ndirecting a Nets half-court offense for which most\n\ndoors--especially their beloved back ones--were closed. San\n\nAntonio bodied up well (Bruce Bowen had particular success\n\nlimiting small forward Richard Jefferson, who was 11 of 31 from\n\nthe field in the first three games) and at times deployed a 3-2\n\nzone that seemed to discombobulate even the heady Kidd.\n\nThe task of containing Duncan was shared by several Nets,\n\nincluding 7'2\" Dikembe Mutombo, the most fascinating ancillary\n\ncharacter in this Finals. Mutombo, who makes $16 million this\n\nseason, $6.8 million more than Kidd, had been quietly chafing\n\nover his reserve status and found ways to turn most questions\n\ntoward that subject. Asked after Game 1 what had happened when a\n\nRobinson elbow opened a gash on his lip that required six\n\nstitches to close, Mutombo said that Robinson was greeting him:\n\n\"David say, 'Welcome, Mutombo. What you been doing sitting on the\n\nside?'\" Mutombo was effective in Game 2 with three blocked shots\n\nand four rebounds in 20 minutes, but much less so on Sunday with\n\nzero blocks and three boards in 18 minutes. It will be\n\ninteresting to see how much he plays in the remainder of the\n\nseries because coach Byron Scott appears not to have confidence\n\nin him.\n\nDuncan's primary shadow was 6'9\" Kenyon Martin, who among the\n\nNets played with the most passion and precision in the first\n\nthree games. When the refs allowed Martin to muscle up, he could\n\npush Duncan out to 17 or 18 feet, where TD's options are much\n\nmore limited. (However, Martin fouled out of Game 1 and drew his\n\nfifth in Game 3 with 7:26 still remaining.) And when the double\n\nteam came and Duncan got rid of the ball, most of the Spurs\n\nweren't comfortable shooting.\n\nMost, but not all. Though Parker often misfired on Sunday with\n\nhis teardrop--that high floater released before a taller defender\n\ncan block it--he bloodlessly tormented the Nets from the\n\nperimeter. Two Parker three-pointers a minute apart late in the\n\nthird period gave San Antonio momentum, and he hit two more in\n\nthe fourth, the last with 5:21 left, to give the Spurs a 73-62\n\nlead. As is their wont, the Spurs had trouble holding their\n\nadvantage, and the Nets cut the deficit to 78-75 with 1:30 left.\n\nDuncan, however, got an offensive rebound on a missed free throw\n\nand fed Parker, who motored along the baseline, looking for a\n\nreceiver. Swingman Manu Ginboli read the situation, stepped into\n\na seam to get the pass and made a leaning eight-footer that may\n\nhave been the most important basket of the game.\n\nFor Parker, handling the Finals pressure seemed as natural as\n\nsipping a glass of red wine, which became legal for him on May\n\n17. Asked after Sunday's game why he is so efficient at running\n\nthe high pick-and-roll, he answered, \"I don't know. I just try to\n\nplay out of it.\" One might as well have asked 16-year-old Steve\n\nWinwood how he was able to pull off the lead vocal on I'm a Man\n\nwith the Spencer Davis Group. Some things can't be taught.\n\nRefined, but not taught.\n\nSo who holds title to this lad, born in Bruges, Belgium, to an\n\nAmerican father and a Dutch mother, schooled in Paris, now\n\nschooling others in the States? Certainly France has a strong\n\nclaim, and Parker's performance has aroused Paris's pride.\n\nStories about him have spread from L'Equipe, the French sports\n\nnewspaper, to the front pages of Liberation and Le Figaro,\n\nParis's major dailies. \"The French want to make sure everyone\n\nknows he's a product of our club system,\" says George Eddy, who\n\ncovers the NBA for Canal+, France's national TV network. \"Because\n\nTony is playing so well at so high a level, and because he has\n\nsuch an American-sounding name, we want to pull him back, let\n\neveryone know he's ours.\"\n\nFor now, though, Parker belongs to the Spurs, and even if they do\n\nmake an offer to Kidd next month, it's a near certainty that TP\n\nwill remain with TD. Exceptional halfway-between guys are hard to\n\nfind.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BOB ROSATO [T OF C] SPUR OF THE MOMENT San Antonio's Tony Parker will fire away at the Nets in Game 5 on Friday (page 54).\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY JOHN W.
