        "text": "After the San Antonio Spurs blew out the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, coach Gregg Popovich didn't get too excited.\n\n\"We played very well, but they were wounded,\" Popovich said after the 105-85 win.\n\nPop's enthusiasm was tempered somewhat because reigning MVP Kobe Bryant was hampered by back spasms while All-Star forward Pau Gasol was out with a hamstring injury.\n\nThe wounded opposition notwithstanding, hand it to the Spurs for making some nice strides in the offseason by getting younger and more athletic.\n\nGeneral manager R.C. Buford pushed the right button when he unloaded Kurt Thomas and the popular but aged Bruce Bowen for swingman Richard Jefferson.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with unloading old warriors for a younger player with three or four productive seasons left in him, and Jefferson will eventually become the perfect complement to the big three of Duncan, Ginobili and Parker.\n\nOn the surface, it was a steal to bring in a guy who put up 19.6 points per game and 4.6 rebounds for the Bucks last season, and while he won't be asked to score as much for his new employer, Jefferson's presence has already helped on the scoreboard, where the Spurs are scoring 102 points per game, up five points from their 2009 output.\n\nWhile not as scrappy as Bowen on defense, Jefferson is bigger and longer, allowing him to better match up with the game's most physical small forwards, like LeBron James and Ron Artest.\n\nPopovich is a defensive head coach who isn't blown away by players who are known more for their ability to score. While Vince Carter's name was bandied about as a potential pickup, Pop and Buford must have thought that Jefferson, who has the reputation for playing hard on both ends, would be a better fit.\n\n\"He has a good feel for the game and he knows how to play,\" Popovich said. \"His personality is great and people love to play with him. He's a willing learner and he's going to get better as we go along.\"\n\nBringing in Jefferson has probably added a couple of years to the careers of Duncan and Ginobili while taking some pressure off young hands George Hill and Roger Mason Jr. Jefferson is playing nearly 36 minutes per game and producing (13.2 points and 3.8 rebounds) for a team that's still looking for cohesiveness after playing with the same rotation for the better part of the last four seasons.\n\nJefferson couldn't be happier after leaving Milwaukee, a postseason wasteland. The Bucks have finished under .500 for the last five years. Compare that with the Spurs, who haven't missed the postseason since 1997, the year before Tim Duncan arrived.\n\n\"It's been an adjustment,'' Jefferson said. \"I've enjoyed this process, getting to know some new guys and a new coach. There are going to be lots of opportunities for me in San Antonio and it's exciting to be a part of everything here.\"\n\nThe true measure of a team player is the willingness to defer, which means sacrificing individual stats for the benefit of the team. At 29, Jefferson is still capable of reaching his career averages of 17.7 points and 5.3 rebounds, but that won't be necessary with this group.\n\nDuncan, Parker and Ginobili will continue to do the heavy lifting, while Jefferson is smart enough to pick his spots when needed. He gives the Spurs a nice defensive presence on the perimeter, and unlike Bowen, he can do much more offensively than hit that occasional three-pointer from the corner.\n\n\"He's that athletic player on that wing that we haven't had in years,'' Duncan said. \"He's someone who can post his guy up. Offensively, you can tell that he's still not quite ready to put his entire offensive game on display. Right now he's still trying to find his way and fit in to the offense.\"\n\nYou read in this space at the beginning of last season that the title window had closed on the Spurs because their roster needed an infusion of athleticism and talent. With Jefferson and a couple of other fresh faces dotting the roster, that window has gone from closed to slightly ajar.\n\ncgolden@statesman.com; 912-5944"
