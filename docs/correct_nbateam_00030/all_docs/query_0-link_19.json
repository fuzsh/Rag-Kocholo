        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs have decided to use their one-time amnesty clause on Richard Jefferson to waive their starting small forward, league sources told Yahoo! Sports. The decision allows the Spurs to remove the three years and $30.5 million left on Jefferson’s contract from the team’s payroll for salary-cap and tax purposes. Jefferson will still be paid the $30.5 million.\n\nThe other new cast member, we’re told, is Kesha Ni’cole Nichols. She was set to marry Richard Jefferson back in 2009, but he bailed on the $2 million wedding the night … telling her via email. According to our sources, Nichols talks openly about the wedding on the show and has thus far been well-liked by the rest of the cast."
