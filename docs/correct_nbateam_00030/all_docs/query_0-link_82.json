        "text": "SAN ANTONIO — Richard Jefferson scored 24 points, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 117-99 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night.\n\nJefferson delivered monster dunks, made reverse layups and sank four 3-pointers as the Spurs (18-11) rolled to their third straight victory. Jefferson scored almost every way possible except from the free throw line. Despite several strong drives to the basket, he never drew a foul.\n\nRoger Mason Jr. added 18 points, including four 3-pointers, for the Spurs who have won nine of 11 games.\n\nAl Jefferson led Minnesota with 20 points. Kevin Love scored 18 and Jonny Flynn 17 for the Wolves (7-25), who have lost 10 straight to San Antonio.\n\nOn the day they acquired swingman Alando Tucker from the Phoenix Suns, the Wolves fell short in their attempt to win three straight for the first time in nearly a year.\n\nMinnesota had no answer for the Spurs’ outside shooting. San Antonio made 50 percent of their 3-point attempts.\n\nThe Spurs took control in the second period. They held the Wolves to 38.3 percent shooting in the first half with a tight, suffocating defense. And they rode the perimeter scoring of Manu Ginobili and Mason to build a 66-52 halftime lead.\n\nMason sank three, 3-pointers en route to 13 first half points. Ginobili made two shots beyond the arc. He finished the half with 13 points and four assists.\n\nBehind Love, Flynn and Al Jefferson, the Wolves pulled within nine three times in the third but never got any closer.\n\nRichard Jefferson started the third with a reverse layup. He began the final period with back-to-back 3-pointers, giving the Spurs a 95-73 lead and allowed Coach Gregg Popovich to rest Tim Duncan and Tony Parker.\n\nWith 7:11 to play, fans rose to their feet and applauded, the lead comfortably in hand. Shortly thereafter, little-used San Antonio reserve Malik Hairston entered. Another teammate who gets little playing time, Marcus Haislip, joined him a minute later.\n\nNOTES: The Timberwolves haven’t won in San Antonio since Jan. 14, 2004. … The Spurs have won 17 of their last 19 games against the Wolves. … Love collided with Spurs C DeJuan Blair in the second half and went down hard. He writhed on the floor for several moments as teammates crowded around. Then he rose to his feet, clutching his hip, and returned to action."
