        "text": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Bucks official with knowledge of the deal says Milwaukee plans to trade scoring forward Richard Jefferson to the San Antonio Spurs for Bruce Bowen, Kurt Thomas and Fabricio Oberto.\n\nThe official said Tuesday, in another move, the Bucks would send Oberto to Detroit for forward Amir Johnson.\n\nThe person confirmed the pending trade to The Associated Press and requested anonymity because the deal is not official until a call later Tuesday.\n\nThe trades will give the Bucks more financial flexibility, the Spurs a proven scorer and the Pistons a veteran big man at a lower cost than Johnson.\n\nYahoo! Sports earlier reported the deal between the Spurs and Bucks.\n\nThe Bucks are sending Jefferson away less than a year after acquiring him in a draft day deal with New Jersey for Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons. Jefferson’s contract has two years and $29.2 million remaining.\n\nJefferson was a steady offensive force for Milwaukee last season after spending his first seven years in New Jersey. He averaged 19.6 points and shot a career-high 39.7 percent from 3-point range while starting all 82 games.\n\nSpurs guard Tony Parker said he would welcome a big, athletic player like Jefferson.\n\n“He’s a great wing,” Parker said. “It’s something we don’t have on our team.”\n\nParker and Tim Duncan had little offensive help in April when the Spurs lost in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000. Jefferson gives San Antonio a scoring threat it sorely lacked when Manu Ginobili was out with injuries.\n\nJefferson became the Bucks’ biggest offensive threat after Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut suffered season-ending injuries, but the team’s tight financial situation made a move necessary. Milwaukee does not want to pay the NBA’s luxury tax, which last year hit teams dollar-for-dollar once they reach $71.15 million in total payroll.\n\nRedd, Bogut and Jefferson are scheduled to make more than $41 million combined this season.\n\nThe trade was a shock to at least one Bucks player: Charlie Villanueva posted “RJ traded to Spurs. Wow” on his Twitter account before the trade was official.\n\nBogut also chimed in, wishing Jefferson the best.\n\n“Sad to see RJ go. He was a fun guy to be around and could play. We are building for the future, slow and steady. Patience grasshopper,” Bogut posted on Twitter.\n\nThe deal actually might allow the Bucks to keep Ramon Sessions or Villanueva, since both are restricted free agents.\n\nBowen and Thomas give the Bucks a veteran group and neither is signed beyond the upcoming season.\n\nJohnson, 22, is a young power forward and another option down low for Milwaukee.\n\nJohnson, a second round draft pick by Detroit in 2005, started 24 games for the Pistons and averaged 3.5 points and 3.7 rebounds. He is also in the final year of his contract, but makes slightly more than Oberto’s $3.5 million.\n\nBowen, 38, is a 13-year veteran known for his defense. Thomas, 36, has played 14 years in the NBA, primarily at forward and center, and has been a bench player each of the last three seasons, averaging 4.3 points last year.\n\nOberto, 34, has played four years in San Antonio, averaging 3.6 points per game in his NBA career. Last season he underwent a procedure to correct an irregular heartbeat.\n\nAinge: Celtics unlikely to move up in draft\n\nWALTHAM, Mass. (AP) — The Boston Garden will be quiet for the NBA draft.\n\nNo party for the season ticketholders and sponsors. No network live shot from the war room. No congratulatory phone call to the next Boston Celtics star on Thursday night, when the top college and international players are distributed around the league.\n\nHaving traded their first-round pick to Minnesota in the deal that brought Kevin Garnett to Boston, the Celtics do not pick until No. 58 — out of 60 — in the NBA draft. It’s the lowest they’ve ever made their first pick.\n\n“It can be pretty boring compared to what we’ve been doing the past few years,” general manager Danny Ainge said Tuesday. “We’ve been good. I guess that’s a good position to be in.”\n\nAinge has no regrets about giving up the No. 1 pick, which was part of a 7-for-1 deal to acquire Garnett from the Timberwolves two summers ago. With Garnett, fellow newcomer Ray Allen and Celtics mainstay Paul Pierce, Boston won its 17th championship in 2008 and seemed poised for a repeat in ’09.\n\nBut Garnett went down with a knee injury, and the Celtics lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Orlando Magic. Now that Garnett’s on track for recovery — “100 percent by the time we start training camp,” Ainge said Tuesday — the GM sees no reason why the Celtics can’t compete for the title again.\n\n“We’re a championship contender the past few years and we feel like this year we’re going to be better,” Ainge said.\n\nThe Celtics have had to wait out 50 or more picks before, and it’s not encouraging. With the 55th overall pick in the 1999 draft, they took Kris Clack, who never played an NBA game; with the 50th overall pick in 2002, they selected Darius Songaila, who has started 78 games in six seasons with three other teams.\n\nIn 1986, Boston used the second overall pick on Len Bias, who died less than two days after the draft, and didn’t pick again until taking Tony Benford last in the fourth round of a seven-round draft, 93rd overall.\n\nIn 1979, a year after they took Larry Bird even though he had a year of eligibility left, their first pick was Wayne Kreklow, in the third round and 53rd overall.\n\nAinge has had some luck with second-round picks, grabbing Ryan Gomes with the 50th pick in 2005 and then flipping him to the Timberwolves as part of the Garnett deal.\n\nBut in this draft, Ainge said the team would even consider selling the pick — “not because we want the money, but because we don’t think there’s a chance of drafting someone that would make our roster,” Ainge said.\n\nOne trade the Celtics won’t make is one that costs them point guard Rajon Rondo. While saying that no one is untradeable, Ainge insisted that he wouldn’t do anything that would make the team worse this season.\n\n“That talk is so false,” Ainge said. “We love the kid and we think he’s got a very bright future. I don’t anticipate any trades happening this offseason regarding any of our core players. … We’re certainly not doing anything this year to get a draft pick that’s a developmental project, that’s going to make it harder to win a championship this year.”"
