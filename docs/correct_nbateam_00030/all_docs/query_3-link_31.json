        "text": "Part I of III: Written and edited by Jeffrey D. Wright\n\nIs it possible to lose something you never actually had? When you think about it, it doesn’t make much sense. You can’t lose something you never actually possessed … right? Many of us have, at one time or another, THOUGHT we were going to win/earn something, only to lose it. A board game, a contest, an athletic event … a championship. Regrouping is an arduous task. Who/what did you lean on? What did you learn? How did it make you improve? If you’re lucky, the moment will prove to be one of growth. Realistically, we all fail at some point, which is fine. It’s not about that, though. It’s about learning from it and not repeating it. It’s about not letting it define you. As an individual, you can control that part. Dealing with failure on an individual level is one thing. We can all relate. Athletic teams? They’re a bit different.\n\nBlood, sweat, tears, stomach acid and bile. For at least seven months. Every year. In the National Basketball Association, it’s all part of the process toward an ultimate goal. If you’re lucky, the season is like pregnancy. Nine months for the best teams. Everyone starts at the same time, but only one team will birth a championship. This goes for each individual, coaches and players. Basketball is a team game, full of skill, movement and grace; however, it’s also more controlled by its star players than any other team sport. People, well, they love stars. Movie stars, rock stars, sports stars. You name them. We’re all front runners here. You have to look up to see stars, and those stars shine, albeit some brighter than others. It’s metaphorical, yes. We gravitate to them and, well, hoops revolve around these stars, almost a reverse orbit deal. It’s always been this way. After all, this is a five-man game we’re talking about. Team sports are different from music and motion pictures given the omnipresence of intense, direct competition, especially in professional sports given the stakes. There’s tangible winning and losing involved ALL THE TIME in sports … all in public view. Imagine all of your professional success AND failure constantly on public display. Rise like a phoenix, dive like a hawk for all the world to see.\n\nSuccess, while great, often spawns from failure. That’s where resiliency in team sports is so fascinating. An individual musician or actor can control THEMSELVES, and that’s good enough usually. Athletes in team sports don’t have that luxury. After any emotionally crippling defeat, each individual brings more chances for SOMETHING to go wrong. Intangibles. It could manifest in a number of ways. A greater sense of defeat. Less confidence. Distrust among teammates. The list goes on. Like anything else, more people/participants correlates to a greater chance of something (good or bad) happening. For this reason, and the presence of intense (i.e., the kind that dictates the size of paychecks) competition, professional athletes/teams go through things to which everyday individuals simply can’t relate. We simply go to work and go home to our families (for the fortunate). These guys have two families. Spending seven (for non-playoff teams) to nine months (for title contenders) straight together dictates such an arrangement. Assimilating and coexisting in a locker room are prerequisites here.\n\nGiven this scenario, caring for and developing human beings is part of this as well. Generally, these players come into the league in their early 20s. They aren’t finished adults. That’s tough enough. Imagine, though, that you’re coming from a different country to play basketball in America on top of being young. One of my favorite parts of America is its diversity. Where else on Earth do you get this many different looking people living together, coexisting and making things happen? If you ask the average person, they’ll tell you (accurately) that NBA rosters aren’t so diverse. Sometimes, players from the United States, Europe, South America and Australia share a locker room with 14 others. This situation seems like it would need a greater family atmosphere, one where the individual’s assimilation into American culture and comfort in doing so are considered vital. For the San Antonio Spurs, it’s a scenario they’ve mastered through the years before our eyes. How? Well, I’ll get to all that. Or your money back.\n\nThe situation: The San Antonio Spurs lead the best-of-seven 2013 NBA Finals vs. the Miami Heat 3-2, and lead Game 6 in Miami 93-89 with 28 seconds left. Manu Ginobli of the Spurs steps to the free throw line for two shots. He misses the first attempt.\n\nIt was 2013. The Spurs were about to cap their dynasty off with a fifth title. The great Tim Duncan and Greg Popovich had a hand FULL of championship rings. It was one for the thumb, as they say. Ginobli grabbed a second straight LeBron James turnover up four with 28 seconds left to head to the free throw line. The American Airlines Arena staff in Miami proceeded to do what they’d done two years earlier vs. Dallas in LeBron’s first season in Miami: Rope off the floor in anticipation of a team winning an NBA Championship in their gym. Chris Bosh of the Heat would later say that he saw this development unfold, and it enraged him. It. Was. OVER. The dynasty of yesteryear toppled the superteam Heat.\n\nSpeaking of dynasties, THEY’VE been present throughout the NBA’s history, a discussion I'll revisit. Going back to its inception, the league has seen all types, too. There’s the fleeting dynasty, such as the late 1980s Detroit Pistons and mid-1990s Houston Rockets. There’ve been intermediate-term dynasties, such as George “Mr. Basketball” Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers at the onset of the league, as well as the 1980s Boston Celtics and the early 2000s Los Angeles Lakers. Oh sure, there’ve been lengthy dynasties, with the GREAT Bill Russell leading the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 seasons and Michael Jordan winning 6 in 8 years in the 1990s. Despite all those great teams, only one could say they made the NBA Finals with the same Head Coach and future first-ballot Hall of Famer 14 SEASONS after going to and winning their first. That would be the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nI want to write about the 2012-2014 era (mostly 2013-14) of the San Antonio Spurs because I’m fearful that they’ve been woefully overlooked during this Golden-State-Warrior-centric last half decade in the NBA. Yes, the Warriors were truly great over the second half of this decade and surely perfected the pace-and-space template that these Spurs helped introduce. However, it was the Spurs (and before them, the Mike D’Antoni Phoenix Suns) who really provided the template for just how devastating such an attack could look like. The 2013-2014 Spurs, in particular, though, were a mosaic of hoop beauty. It happens to be the most diverse team in league history. How did they so historically prolong their success? Why was this team so damned team oriented, on and off the floor, despite all kinds of different cultures in one locker room? Did it just so happen that this team, this eclectic collection of foreign players, were the ones to accomplish all of this? Were the Spurs just … lucky? Was it the great Duncan? Was it Popovich? Both?\n\nThere’ve been two abnormally lengthy dynasties this century in professional team sports: The New England Patriots. And the San Antonio Spurs. It just so happens that they also represent the longest such outfits of modern times, any sport, with dynasties that spanned at least a decade and a half by the time they were over. There are similarities between them, for sure, but the following might just be the biggest common thread: Both suffered long title droughts following immense success in the early 2000s. More specifically, each suffered an iconic, soul-crushing defeat in a championship setting during those draughts. A comeback, while always riveting, is surely great. It’s just that the important one might have been missed here. This is about epic teamwork from one of the most under appreciated winners I’ve ever witnessed. This story needs to be told.\n\nSometimes we miss something special because our propensity as a society is to live so manically in the present while moving at warp speed, species programmed and trained to think that the future is more important than the past. At best, we’re present oriented. That’s where the pandemic we’re all experiencing has allowed us to really examine past greatness that, far too often, has been sort of forgotten. In all sports, great teams have come and gone over time. Some are remembered too fondly. Others not quite enough. Then there’s the completely underappreciated. The criminally overlooked. The rare basketball supernova that dismantles everything in its way for other reasons, not because it has the king piece on the Chess board. Sure, we’ve seen these teams in the NBA. The heartbreak-turned-triumph crews, the curse breakers and the vigilante squads. We’ve had innovators, trend setters and style-altering teams. We’ve had overachievers. I want to ask you, though: IN ANY FOUR OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN TEAM SPORTS, have we ever seen a team be all three? I’m here to tell you about a group that changed the game of basketball in inspiring fashion and why we should appreciate them. Why? Innovation. Culture. Historic diversity. Resilience. Unprecedented teamwork.\n\nTHOSE OLD, “BORING” SPURS\n\nIn the 2000s, the Spurs were cast as an especially boring team. It certainly didn’t help that their chief rival, the Lakers, were exactly the opposite: booming with personalities, both brash and lovable. Shaquille O’Neal, arguably the single biggest physical force the game has ever seen, was at his most dominant, and he always brought the fun-loving quotes with him. He called the Sacramento Kings, “the Queens,” something that would be sacrilegious coming out of southeast Texas. The late Kobe Bryant’s actual game was just as breathtaking as watching Manu Ginobli. In contrast, Kobe’s star was ascending each year. He had the playoff failure in Utah back in 1997 as a teen, with even that bottom out almost serving as a “yeah, but …” moment for someone who LOOKED the part. Spurs point guard and staple Tony Parker looked like some model type who wandered into your local YMCA. Ginobli, with his Italian-like features, would almost be mistook for somebody’s uncle if he walked into the wrong gym. The Lakers’ agitator, Rick Fox, was a talker and a freaking Hollywood actor on the side. The Spurs’ equal was Bruce Bowen, an afterthought who said basically nothing. If the Lakers were high profile, the Spurs were pretty much no profile, aside from Duncan. Hell, even Pop was a relative unknown at that point. Lakers Head Coach Phil Jackson LITERALLY had a hand full of championship rings.\n\nThe NBA has long been about personality with its stars, and there’s a few reasons. To begin with, it has less players on a field/court than any other team sport, making each player obviously more noticeable. Coupled with the fact that, unlike in hockey and football where helmets/masks cover the faces of participants, these players are completely visible, from head to toe, the NBA has always enjoyed an inherent marketing advantage over other team sports. Even baseball players have helmets and caps to shield their identities, certainly more so than basketball players. When Jordan came along, he represented the perfect storm and completely changed sports marketing when he RESOUNDINGLY proved that a basketball player, no matter their skin color, could sell products to mainstream America. All of a sudden, if you were a good enough basketball player, you could have your own shoe. It’s a trend that’s stronger than ever 35 years later. It speaks to the individualism this team game has long held. In no other sport can one player have such an impact on who wins titles year in and year out. It’s been proven.\n\nThe great game of basketball was invented some 80 miles west of where I wrote this piece, located in a western Massachusetts city called Springfield. Being a five-versus-five sport lends itself to the process of individual excellence spearheading team success at least as much as any other team game we have. Its professional league, the NBA, was technically born in 1946 but was renamed in 1949 after the merging of two existing leagues (the league recognizes the pre-merger date of 1946 as the NBA’s inception). Either way, from the start of the league, the game’s best player and, subsequently, best team, would seemingly go hand in hand through the decades. The league quickly revolved around its SUPERSTARS. George “Mr. Basketball” Mikan was the first great, leading his Minneapolis Lakers to an early 1950s dynasty. When he was done, he was declared the game’s greatest player of the century’s first half by the Associated Press. Three years after his final championship season, Russell’s Celtics owned the end of the 1950s and pretty much all of the 1960s by winning 11 titles. A player unlike anything anyone had ever seen teamed up with Red Auerbach and an epic Celtics team to rip off eight straight titles beginning in 1959. Generally regarded as one of the five best players to ever play, The Great Bill Russell IS regarded as TEAM SPORTS greatest winner. He was done after 1969. In the league’s 21 seasons from 1949 to 1969, Mikan (5) and Russell (11) combined for 16 titles.\n\nIn 1971, it was the eventual leading scorer in league history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, winning the first of a handful of rings. After the league added three teams in 1970, the talent became more dispersed, which led to a brief period of teams led by less dominant types winning. It was short-lived when Bill Walton, in a long line of dominant NBA big men in their primes, won his only title in 1977. Things changed dramatically in 1980. While the 1970s saw eight teams win an NBA title (it remains a record decade in that regard), the 1980s saw half as many win. Dominant duos and trios, including Magic Johnson/Jabbar and Larry Bird/Kevin McHale/Robert Parish, were becoming the norm. Of course, these were fantastic passing teams that shared the ball. The 1990s arrived, and that meant Jordan. Through no fault of his own, his individual dominance changed the game. Yes, that decades-old “the best player’s team usually wins” mantra was well-known. This was different, though: an absolutely unstoppable force who wasn’t 6’ 9” or bigger (in MJ’s case, a perfectly, almost lab-crafted 6’ 6” frame). During his almost two-year hiatus, the best center I’ve ever seen, Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back NBA titles.\n\nJordan won his six NBA titles, and the ball-stopping basketball that was increasing after he retired in 1999 is more a testament to his utter greatness than any type of criticism of him. More than ever before, basketball was becoming a one-on-one sport. Isolations, players coming into the league at ages younger than the league had ever seen and the absolutely perpetual individual greatness of Jordan all contributed to this game changer. The game was more physical than ever. Offensive basketball declined as the century turned. Oh yeah, and those dominant teams returned, as evidenced by six franchises total winning the 15 post-Jordan NBA titles. The late great Bryant, the closest comparison to Jordan (it’s true, I’m not saying he’s better than LeBron either), was on a third of those 15 teams.\n\nIf players and personalities drive the league, markets also play a big role. Outside of Detroit, San Antonio is the smallest market in the past 40 years to produce an NBA champion. In its home state alone, it’s dwarfed by bigger cities such as Houston and Dallas. To push it farther down the totem pole, they play in a baseball- and football-crazed state. Basketball is third, and that’s being kind. “They (the Spurs) play in a TV market that ranks 36th among the more than 200 in the U.S. and resides in the bottom tier of those home to NBA teams,” according to Variety.com’s Brian Lowry back in June 2014.\n\nThose were just a couple things. Then, there was certainly what appeared to be the bottom line for the national audience: For whatever reason, this Spurs team had simply proven not to be box office material. Proof of the Spurs being quite possibly the most unpopular dynasty in the history of professional (or amateur) basketball is very hard to ignore. According to Statistica, which has “average TV ratings of NBA Finals games in the United States from 2002 to 2019,” the two lowest rated NBA Finals, by far, over that span both involved the Spurs. Yes, the small markets of New Jersey and Cleveland helped those numbers in 2003 and 2007, respectively, as did the expected outcomes. In one of the most hotly contested NBA Finals of that or any other era, in 2005 vs. Detroit, they had the highest of their three NBA Finals ratings; however, it still lagged ALL others. The numbers don’t lie. People didn’t exactly view the Spurs, despite multiple titles at that point, as an aesthetically pleasing bunch. Yes, the 2005 Finals were a rock fight that resembled a steel cage match. Offense was scarce. Regardless, I believe most would agree when I say, at best, they were taken for granted. To be totally honest, it actually felt like the opposite: that they were DISLIKED. Huh?\n\nAccording to Sports Media Watch (SMW), which has NBA Finals ratings for every game going back to 1988, the 2007 series against Cleveland (and one of the best players in league history in James, arguably the second-highest profile player in league history behind Jordan) is the only such series in more than 30 years that didn’t have a single game reach an eight-figure audience. Hell, the 2003 series is the only other one during that time that can compare (two such games, with no others occurring during that 30-year span). The Spurs were in both series. Yes, both were pretty much over before they began, but that hadn’t stopped the Lakers from almost doubling the Spurs’ ratings versus the same opponent, New Jersey, and similar expectations the year before in 2002. By the Spurs’ FOURTH title in nine years, they were a known commodity. James’ presence seemed not to matter either despite the fact that his superduper star presence dwarfed that of Jason Kidd’s back in 2002-2003, when he was New Jersey’s best and only comparison to such stature.\n\nAccording to SMW, the Spurs were in their own league as far as championship outfits and TV ratings were concerned: “Game 2 of the 2003 Spurs-Nets NBA Finals ranks as the lowest rated and least watched on record with a 5.2 rating and 8.1 million viewers. The 2007 Spurs-Cavaliers NBA Finals ranks at the bottom on average, with a 6.2 and 9.3 million over four games.” The 2007 Finals were more telling given James’s presence AND the fact that Cleveland as a whole was a city that was absolutely starving for a world championship in any of their three sports. It just didn’t matter. The people had spoken: We’re not really excited by these Spurs. Even Duncan.\n\nTake this exchange from Ringer founder, author, podcaster and NBA historian Bill Simmons in his The Book of Basketball. After listing Duncan as the league’s seventh best player ever (I concur), he includes an exchange with his father, also a noted NBA fan. “I once asked my father, ‘would you read a column about how underrated Tim Duncan is?’ Dad made a face. He played with his hair. He seemed confused. ‘A whole column on Tim Duncan?’ ‘You wouldn’t read it?’ ‘I don’t think so. I’d see the headline, skim the first two paragraphs, and flip to the next article.’ ‘Seriously? He’s the best player of the past 10 years!’ ‘Nahhhhhhh,’ dad maintained. ‘Nobody wants to read about Tim Duncan. He’s not that interesting.’” While Simmons would go to explain that, like me, his dad remained hurt over the Celtics missing out on him in 1997, this exchange represented common thinking at the time. It also signaled why the Spurs felt like such afterthoughts despite the dynasty they were.\n\nYeah, the Spurs dynasty was more than a decade in at this point; however, it came with something of an unofficial intermission after their fourth title in nine seasons in 2007. The Lakers and Phoenix had caught up to the four-time NBA Champions. In 2008, they were out in five games vs. the Lakers in the Conference Finals. A year later, they became a sitting duck when Ginobli went down for the year with an ankle injury just before the playoffs. For the second time in four years, they’d lose to hated in-state rival Dallas, this time in an easy five games. In 2010, things would more or less bottom out (many, many teams would love to have such a bottoming out scenario, I should add.). The Spurs were not only swept by another rival, this time Phoenix, it was clear they’d become far too reliant on their big three of Parker, Duncan and Ginobli. The bench support had become nonexistent. Sure, the Spurs had been swept once before in the Duncan/Greg Popovich era; however, it had been to the Lakers, smack dab in the middle of their three-peat in the early 2000s. In hindsight, there had been no shame in that loss given how good those Lakers were. But, Phoenix? More people than not that summer were saying that was probably it for the Spurs. They had a good run. It felt like it was over, though.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers had just repeated as NBA champs and were still loaded. Just as the Seven-Seconds-Or-Less Phoenix Suns of last decade were crumbling, a new contender was forming in the Oklahoma City Thunder and their trio of future NBA Most Valuable Players. Oh, I almost forgot … LeBron rewrote the rules when he formed a super team in Miami with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Times were changing. While the Spurs rebounded to win 61 games in 2011, they ended the season with their most shocking playoff defeat of the Duncan/Popovich era, a first round loss at the hands of the Memphis Grizzlies. The 2011 draft marked the Spurs’ fourth straight titleless season, the longest drought of Pop’s decade and a half tenure. In the NBA, a 60-win team not winning a playoff series is almost unprecedented, as only the Dallas Mavericks in 2007 had failed to do so (at least in the seven-game first round format. Seattle failed to do so in 1994, when teams only had to win three games to win a first round series).\n\nThe Spurs were still REALLY REALLY good ... but something was missing. They could beat most teams in their sleep, as the trio of Duncan, Parker and Ginobli was as stout as ever and had the added benefit of familiarity. Shit, they’d average 55 wins over the previous four years. But Duncan was slipping as an athlete, while Parker and Ginobli were always diminutive in stature and never considered high flyers. They needed new blood. Things felt different with the Spurs. Getting swept by Phoenix was one thing. To follow it up with another dud to Memphis was something else. That summer, questions about the dynasty’s demise turned more to statements compared to the suggestions they’d represented the previous summer. Whispers turned to shouts. “That was a time when people were like … maybe that’s it,” ESPN Senior Writer Zach Lowe recently said of the 2011 sweep to Memphis on The Bill Simmons Podcast. “People didn’t see the 12, 13, 14 run coming after that.”\n\nDespite four titles, the public was apathetic about the Spurs. Duncan? Great player, but not very entertaining. The Spurs? Meh, ok, they’re good. But there’s no high-flying, rim-rattling hero to zero in on. A public audience used to Magic, Bird, Jordan, Kobe and now James had little use for the Spurs. Or maybe they just didn’t know HOW to appreciate them. There was a monotonous manner to how the Spurs played. Duncan’s face-up, off-the-glass jumper off the block, while LETHAL, was nothing groundbreaking. His follow up dunks weren’t accompanied by any flair, there was no menacing smirk. They were ordinary, no more or less powerful than the ordinary jam. His underappreciated defense was nonetheless great. Yes, Ginobli was so fucking unique and unlike pretty much anything we’d ever seen. But this was Duncan’s team. The Big Fundamental, as Shaq dubbed him, was just not an entertainer. He was a winner. Unsurprisingly, then, EVERYTHING on the floor started with him.\n\nTHE GREATEST POWER FORWARD/CENTER COMBO EVER\n\nIn hindsight, it seems like we got the best power forward/center combo (while he certainly played more center than anything, he also played more at the power forward spot than any of the league’s greatest centers ever did. It’s true, thus my categorization here.) ever to grace a basketball court by accident. Duncan’s sport du jour was actually swimming. Not shockingly, he was really good. A nationally ranked swimmer at St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School in the Virgin Islands, he didn’t play organized basketball until high school. That was because Hurricane Hugo had demolished the island’s olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989. Both his sisters were swimmers, so he was naturally attracted to the sport. It helps to be really good, like his sister Tricia, who’d go on to be an olympic swimmer. It would be the start of a tough, transitional time for the young Duncan, as soon after Hurricane Hugo, his mother died. His brother-in-law, Rick Lowery, proved to be a life-changing presence.\n\nAfter his mom’s death, he moved back to St. Croix with his sister and Lowery, who would teach Duncan the game he’d eventually dominate. Duncan wore number 21 throughout his career to honor Lowery. According to acclaimed author John Feinstein in his gem, A March to Madness, Duncan would eventually choose Wake Forest after being first seen by Demon Deacon player Chris King. King had played against Duncan on a junior team in a Virgin Islands tournament. According to Feinstein, the following exchange ensued when King returned to see Wake Forest coach Dave Odom: “‘So, did you see anyone we ought to recruit?’ Odom asked jokingly. ‘Yeah, one guy, maybe.’ King answered. ‘Real skinny kid we played against on St. Croix. Tell you what, though, he had some raw talent.’”\n\n“Raw talent” was a term that was beginning to be used more and more given the increasing trend of college players leaving early for the pros. The trend would only accelerate in the mid 1990s, when high school players started going straight to the NBA. The exchange speaks to a few things that were happening. Duncan’s unpolished, but noteworthy, game. The insinuation from a coach who’d been around for a while that finding a player at an eastern Carribean basketball tournament wasn’t really feasible. To think that Duncan, as a mid-teenager, was so unknown at that point in time and sans some type of epic growth spurt was crazy. He remained a relative unknown while toiling in the Virgin Islands, as evidenced by the lack of colleges that ended up zeroing in on him.\n\nKnowing what we know now, five championship rings, a couple MVPs and a generally impeccable career later, you’d figure it was the Duke, North Carolina and Kansas blue blood types that were hot for this prodigy. Nope. According to Feinstein, it was the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, Providence College and Wake Forest University. A few phone calls and some recruiting later, and Duncan made his choice to attend Wake Forest over Providence. From the start, EVERYTHING about Duncan was quiet. That continued at Wake, where he was just so understated and steady.\n\nTo drive home just how good Duncan was at Wake, consider the following take from Feinstein: “He was an absolute lock to be the first player chosen in the NBA draft.” That was in 1996, after his junior year at Wake. It was practically consensus, too. You would have been hard pressed to find someone in the know to disagree at that time. Hell, most would agree he’d have gone first after his sophomore year, too. He was a quietly dominant force the entire time at Wake, part of what was widely considered the best college league in the country, the Atlantic Coast Conference. Although it never led to a Final Four appearance, his fours years at Wake Forest were among the best EVER in the college game. Without ANY debate, Duncan will go down as the last of his kind: A big man, who despite flourishing from day one and essentially dominating his final three college seasons, spent all four years in school. The reason? According to Feinstein, before she died, he promised his mother he’d graduate from college. He followed through on it.\n\nIn hindsight, his decision to go four years instead of two or three had enormous ripple effects. For one, imagine if he’d come out after his junior year. He would’ve been a Philadelphia 76er, and the great Allen Iverson would’ve probably played in Canada given Toronto and Vancouver followed Philadelphia in that draft. Or in 1995, when he would’ve been a Golden State Warrior and possibly pushed the likes of Kevin Garnett to another franchise. His decision to stay coincided with another development happening in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs had become a respectable basketball power by the mid-1990s, thanks in large part to David Robinson. A famously gentle giant, “the Admiral” had attended the Naval Academy. To put into context just how fortunate they were to even SNIFF the great Duncan in the 1997 draft, consider that the following happened before the Spurs’ trainwreck of a 20-win season that was 1996-97: Since Robinson’s rookie year in 1990, they hadn’t had a season of less than 47 wins. They were peaking in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, winning 62 and 59 games, respectively. But Robinson broke his foot early in the 1997 season, and the Spurs did the wise thing in letting him pretty much sit out the year from then on. It was a decision that would pay dividends beyond their wildest expectations. Looking back, Robinson’s injury may have been the most fortuitous in sports’ history. Yes, really.\n\nMost dynasties and almost dynasties enjoy a stroke of luck, some type of event you can point to and suggest the outcome would’ve been WAY different had that luck not occurred in some form. The mother of all dynasties, the Russell Celtics of the late 1950s and 1960s that won 8 straight and 11 of 13 NBA titles, came about more or less because two teams (partly for financial and race-related reasons) allowed the Celtics to get their hands on Russell, the obvious best player in the draft, with the third pick that year. The Bulls drafted the greatest player ever, Jordan, THIRD because the Portland Trailblazers felt set at his position. The early 2000s Lakers dynasty (and, for that matter, their repeat later) was buoyed by the great Bryant steering his way to Los Angeles out of high school. The Golden State Warriors dynasty of the teens was buoyed by the drafting of Draymond Green with the 35th pick, meaning essentially every team in the league passed on him. For the Spurs, it was netting Duncan despite the fact that the franchise had spent the better part of the decade as a playoff team. He was similar to Russell in that he joined a very good team and made it GREAT. Immediately.\n\nAfter Ginobli makes the second free throw attempt, Spurs 94 Heat 89, 28 seconds left. The Heat take a 20-second timeout.\n\nAs a rookie at 22, Duncan co-led a 56-win team with Robinson, forming a twin tower duo with the Admiral. It was a 36-win improvement for the Spurs, an astonishing feat even given Robinson’s return following his now fortuitous absence the year before. In 1997, Duncan became the first rookie selected to an All-NBA First Team (basically representing the five best players in the league at each position) since Larry Bird in 1980. He was an instant star, although never a marketable one. His offensive game was methodical, regardless if it was the patented face up off the glass or a “boring” jump hook from six feet. Sure, he had a shot you could hang laundry on (this is a hoopster way of saying his shot lacked arc.). But he perfected the bank, a lost art as time has passed. He was savvy in the post, never rushed. He couldn’t jump high and didn’t need to given he knew how to fake and get big men off balance.\n\nDuncan could do it all. Obviously he could score, but also pass out of the post. A fantastic rebounder. The defense was excellent, although understated for a guy his size. It led to a lot of winning. As good as he was and the Spurs were because of him, they always had a yawn factor. Duncan had little flair, both on and off the floor. He didn’t rattle rims or act. He didn’t market. He didn’t really smile. He was the COMPLETE antipathy of the 1990s player: introvertive, team oriented and, for a superstar anyway, egoless. As Feinstein stated, “Duncan wasn’t like kids who had grown up in the States dreaming of having their own shoe line and/or making millions of dollars.” Ironically, his almost monotonous existence undoubtedly contributed to the notion that the Spurs were boring. His game, while devastating, was vanilla. Hakeem had the iconic Dream Shake. Shaq’s thunderous dunks were just unlike anything we’d seen. Kevin Garnettt was the young, brash high schooler, making headlines with everything he did upon entering the league. Meanwhile, Duncan just quietly balled. Maybe that’s why he got along without a hint of dissension with the notoriously hard to please Pop. Or maybe it went deeper.\n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated’s Chris Ballard in his “21 Shades of Gray” Duncan profile back in May 2012, “Most important, he's allowed Popovich to coach him. For 15 straight seasons Pop has gone after his franchise player in practice. We're talking neck veins bulging, spittle flying, a Gatling gun of obscenities. And all Duncan has done is stare back, absorbing it. ‘He hasn't always liked it,’ says former teammate Sean Elliott, now a team announcer, ‘but he takes it. You know how important that is for the rest of the team to see?’” Coachability from a superstar. The coach, in turn, had his own strategy that involved trust in Duncan. “When the Spurs call a timeout and you see the San Antonio coaches huddle a few feet from the bench, it's not to hash out strategy. Rather, Pop is giving Duncan, Ginobili and Parker time with the team. ‘You'll see Timmy over there with a young kid, talking about how he should do this or that or what we meant by such and such,’ says Popovich.” That type of synergy helped them become the overachieving dynasty they represented.\n\nIs it a coincidence that the Spurs became so successful after having not one, but two straight superstars be more or less impeccable teammates? Robinson is basketball famous for being a nice guy. The more reclusive Duncan was always harder to read, though. Feinstein notes Wake Forest’s 1997 annual Christmas party in his book, and it provides a glimpse of who Duncan was as a man and teammate. Among a handful of other gifts that Christmas, he was given a pair of pom poms, “since his favorite thing in life was to sit on the bench and lead cheers for his housemate, Marc Scott.” Think about what that says about Duncan given Scott’s bench-warmer status throughout his Demon Deacon career. Think about that in the context of just how many guys he’d not only end up playing with in San Antonio, but from how many different backgrounds they came and, yet, still assimilated. As the leader in San Antonio for so long, that enthusiasm for your far-less-talented peers simply can’t be disregarded.\n\nThe other thing Duncan had, a very clear innate trait, was humility. In fact, it’s an organizational staple. Ego is a constant thing with stars. In superstars? It’s omnipresent. Duncan was a diamond in the rough in this regard. Feinstein’s anecdote when discussing Duncan’s dominance over Duke’s Greg Newton the year before puts it on display: “Newton had said after the game that Duncan wasn’t really all that good, that he ‘floated’ (didn’t play hard) a lot of the game. When Duncan had been asked for a response, he smiled and said, ‘Peace to him. He’s the best player I’ve ever seen.’” The retort, while classic Duncan, was a complete outlier for a superstar. Almost every time in these situations, the star either completely dismisses the far less talented (as was the case here) guy as nothing or brings a “how dare he?!” tone to their response. Hell, sometimes it’s both. But VERY RARELY do you see the star both say something POSITIVE back, albeit with a heavy dose of satire. It’s partly that “I can never take myself that seriously no matter how dominant I am” attitude that allowed Duncan and Pop to be so successful together. The two couldn’t have been more in lockstep in that regard. As one of my favorite artists, J.Cole, says, “the bigger we get, the more our egos collide.” It NEVER happened with Pop and Duncan for this reason.\n\nIt went both ways with the two. According to Jack McCallum’s 2013 Sports Illustrated piece, entitled “Pop Art,” Pop had this to say during their interview: “‘As far as innovation goes … ’ one question begins. ‘Oh, hell, I don't know anything about innovation,’ he says, rising. ‘Here is my innovation: I drafted Tim Duncan. Okay? End of story.’” While he came off sounding like Pete Bell (and definitely some Jack Cates, for Nick Nolte fans like me), there was never any denial or sugar coating from Pop regarding who was mainly responsible for the Spurs’ success. That almost hot potato game of “I don’t want the credit, no you take it” between the two was incredibly overlooked when talking about their longevity together. The fact is, it hardly felt like a coincidence when A) the Spurs had eclipsed Magic’s Lakers for longest modern (i.e., post 1960s Celtics) NBA dynasty and B) done so while never having any scandal or negative public discourse occur with its coach and/or star player, unlike Magic’s Lakers, unlike Jordan’s AND Pippen’s Bulls, and unlike Shaq and Kobe’s Lakers.\n\nLastly, that mature knowledge, that pragmatic thought process that would help him lord over one melting pot locker room after another was evident, too. We often think of dominant athletes in terms of how athletic they are, how their PHYSICAL gifts translate to the entertainment we expect when we watch. Even in this respect, Duncan was unlike almost all others. He didn’t swat shots into the fifth row. He didn’t howl and pound his chest after jams. It was never about him, although he was always the sun around which everything else orbited on a basketball court.\n\nBy his fourth title in 2007, the game was beginning to become smaller and faster. Enormous, dominant big men were becoming passe. Shaq had peaked and was declining. Yao Ming was starting to get injured and would never be the same. As the decade turned, the Spurs were transitioning the team. Sixteen years, four titles, and two MVPs in, Duncan’s NBA resume was simply impeccable. Ballard’s Duncan profile included the following: “13: Consecutive seasons to begin his career in which Duncan was named All-NBA and All-Defensive team, six more than anyone else in league history. .702: The Spurs' winning percentage during the Duncan era, the best 15-year run by any NBA team in history. 0: Number of teams in the four major pro sports with a better winning percentage over the last 15 years than the Spurs.”\n\nWhile the credentials were remarkable, the first Ballard stat had been somewhat telling in that the number “13” was two less than the 15 seasons Duncan had just completed. He was near the end at age 36. It’s no surprise and a testament to his headiness as a player that, even in his age 36 season in 2012-13, he managed to claim the last of his 10 All-NBA First Team honors. He was still highly effective, just not dominant. The Spurs were similar in this respect, as Parker and Ginobli were aging as well. It’s obviously no surprise, then, that they seemed to be heading backwards after 2011. They had to adapt.\n\nAN UNEXPECTED RESURGENCE BACK TO DOMINANCE\n\nThe 2011 team was an example of what the Spurs had more or less become: a savvy, seasoned and championship-caliber regular season crew that could seemingly cruise to 50-win regular seasons (the Spurs would attain a league-record 18 straight such regular seasons, between 2000 and 2017, by the time it was over. It should be noted that the real number is 20 here, given the abbreviated 1999 season and the Spurs’ subsequent title. Saying that team wouldn’t have won 50 games out of 82 would be truly comical, albeit misguided.), but one that was having an increasingly difficult time in the playoffs. Part of it was age, yes. Another issue was roster makeup.\n\nThe Spurs, like most highly successful team sport organizations, really like having adults around. That preference had pretty much crested in 2010, but it just hadn’t worked out. Michael Finley and Antonio McDyess (both former All-Stars) were shells of themselves, getting big minutes in years 14 and 13, respectively. The Spurs were devoid of any young talent and, worse, even more hollow in terms of possessing athletes. With Bryant, James and Kevin Durant all dominating the league, you simply couldn’t win the whole thing without having somebody to stop them. This was even more true based on how much help each of those players had at that point in their careers, with Byrant coming off back-to-back titles and armed with the winningest coach in NBA history, James having teamed up with Wade and Bosh and Durant being part of perhaps the most talented under-25 trio the league has EVER SEEN alongside Russell Westbrook and James Harden. The Spurs knew all of this and acted accordingly.\n\nIn terms of the team’s offensive transition, the numbers tell the story: After averaging 13.9 shot attempts in 2010, Duncan’t attempts dropped to 11 per game in 2011. It was the single biggest year-over-year per game shot attempt decline of his career, in addition to being the fourth straight year his attempts per game declined. Meanwhile, Parker missed 26 games in 2010. That absence had surely elevated Duncan’s attempts, but Parker still increased his attempts from 12.8 per game to 13.7 between 2010 and 2011. The Spurs were in transition.\n\nThere was a David-vs.-Goliath aspect to Parker’s game, demonstrated countlessly by his fierce bursts into the paint to hoist his patented floaters over players roughly a foot taller than him. He had a fearlessness, and Pop rode him early to help mold him into a better player. His ability to attack, almost dart, off the dribble was sort of like watching a cat zoom around a dog. He did it over and over, his impeccable quickness and first step allowing him to form a lethal pick and roll with Duncan. Never a three-point shooter, by this point in time, he’d become deadly in the midrange game. Parker was something of an enigma: Although considered a score-first point guard, you could also make the case he was pretty traditional for the position. Nonetheless, Parker blended his clear ability to score with his European roots, where sharing the basketball was a bit more prevalent than in the States. The Spurs were at a point where they needed scoring from him more than ever, a scenario that would be revisited by the 2013-14 season.\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how good the Spurs were in 2011. They started the year going 37-6, as well as 51-11. However, they went just 10-10 down the stretch. Yes, Pop was playing his usual long game and giving his big three plenty of rest. 10-10 to end the season, though? It was a very un-Spur-like finish. They’d made a conscious effort to get younger, bringing in guys like Danny Green, George Hill and Tiago Splitter. Unfortunately, youth often gets served in the playoffs. With a bench filled with players both too young and past their primes, along with an aging core, the Spurs lost to Memphis in six games in the first round. It was their second first round exit in three years and only the third in the entire Duncan/Pop era. They’d had a fantastic 2011, only to not win a playoff series. It’s really easy to forget that loss among the mountain of achievements the Spurs had been able to boast for a solid decade and a half.\n\nDynasties need some additional fortuity to get this far in the first place, especially when the superstar they’d long depended on slips into a reduced role. It was clear the Spurs needed help on the wing if they were to win a fifth title, a necessity dictated by a golden era of wing play. The Indiana Pacers were a pretty strong team already around this time. Luckily for the Spurs, Indiana was the opposite in that it had two high-level wing players in Danny Granger and Paul George already in tow. According to ESPN’s Lowe at the time, the Pacers had interest in Spurs guard George Hill almost from the moment he was drafted in 2008. Indiana was well aware of Hill, who played for four years at nearby IUPI. Three years later, the Pacers were still hot for Hill. Of course, the Parker/Barry scandal had just occurred and the Spurs reportedly were trying to figure out whether to cut ties with Parker or Hill. In one of the league’s biggest modern heists, the Pacers traded the draft rights to a rangy, defensive stalwart named Kawhi Leonard for Hill. At the time, it seemed reasonable; however, looking back, the Pacers traded a Bentley for an Acura.\n\nEven before 2011, though, the Spurs were fortunate. According to Lowe, the Pacers backed out of a Hill deal the year before when Paul George fell in their lap. It feels somewhat likely and accurate to say that, had George not fallen all the way to Indiana in the 2010 draft, a key addition to the 2012 Spurs team may have never been made. In terms of trades, by any conceivable metric, what the Spurs pulled off with the Leonard deal would prove to be easily the biggest heist in the post-millennium NBA. While Hill had been a nice player for the Spurs, they were wise enough to know that he was a valuable and desired trade chip. He helped bring them back the wing defense they’d sorely need if they wanted to add title number five. Hill has had a nice career, no question, but Leonard was a future superstar and everything the Spurs were lacking on the wing: young, athletic and long. After all, you’re not winning shit in the NBA at this time if you can’t contain the James, Durants, Bryants or DWades of the world.\n\nThe 2011 NBA lockout, which lasted from the official beginning of the off season (July 1) and ended on December 8, 2011, helped the 2012 Spurs given it chopped 16 games off the schedule. For a veteran team, most notably Duncan and Ginobli, it was beneficial. The Spurs had long been well-known for ramping up their effort and play after the All-Star break, which occurs annually during the second week of February. This time, with an abbreviated season at their advantage, the Spurs became UNSTOPPABLE all of a sudden. They won 11 of 13 returning from the break, including 11 straight wins that featured 6 different leading scorers. The team’s only two losses over more than two months were consecutive road defeats vs. Utah and the Lakers. Popovich sat his big three vs. Utah. The loss to the Lakers on April 11 would be their only true loss spanning 33 games, as they moved into yet another gear afterward. After beating Memphis and Phoenix at home, they had a three-game road trip in California where they beat Golden State and the Lakers by 21, then cracked Sacramento by 25. They went back home and again smoked the Lakers, this time by 25.\n\nOf course, the Spurs had extra motivation during this run to end the 2012 regular season. Early in the morning, Eastern time, on April 27, 2012, the San Antonio Spurs achieved what might’ve been the organization’s most significant accomplishment of all: A 13th consecutive 50-win season, setting an NBA record despite having 16 fewer games to do it in for the 2011-12 season. Titles are great, but the combination of longevity and consistency is arguably their greatest achievement. For Pop, the 2012 team was as unique a mix as he’d ever coached in San Antonio to that point. Duncan, a generational superstar, was still a very good player. He also had a point guard, Parker, who was peaking entering his second decade in the league. Finally, he had a rookie who, looking back, few realized how vital he’d become in Leonard. Despite having not made an NBA Finals in at least five seasons after reaching three in the previous five years, their 50th win capped a 10-game winning streak to end the regular season.\n\nMike Miller enters for Chris Bosh. Diaw enters for Duncan. Heat ball, 28 seconds left, Spurs 94 Heat 89.\n\nThe playoffs proved no different for the streaking Spurs, as they swept Utah in the opening round, allowing no more than 91 points in any game. The upstart Clippers were next. After going up 2-0, the Spurs came out flat in Game 3. They found themselves buried in a 22-point first quarter hole on the road in LA. But they used a 24-0 run in that game en route to a 26-8 advantage in the third quarter. They still won by double digits. The Clippers scored their 57th point at the 9:38 mark of the third quarter. They wouldn’t score a single point again until more than eight full game minutes ticked off the clock, at 1:25 remaining in the quarter. This was a team with a will-be Hall of Fame point guard (or GOD), Chris Paul, who was in his prime. Didn’t matter.\n\nAccording to SBNation’s Louis Bien back in 2012, the Spurs’ evisceration of a 22-point first quarter deficit was the largest EVER overcome to win an NBA playoff game in league history. Although Duncan was still the main guy, Parker was becoming more of the team’s engine at this point. He was in the midst of the best three-year stretch of his career. “We follow his lead. He stuck with it, made some big shots down the stretch and continued to attack,” Duncan said of Parker. They went on to sweep a suddenly very good Clippers team, running their total winning streak to 18, not to mention 29 wins in 31 games. The Spurs were anything but an unknown at this point; however, this FELT different. You could almost hear the whispers: Did we bury this proud franchise prematurely here?\n\nThe transition happening with the Spurs before everyone’s eyes was ironic on multiple levels. For one, it had been one of their rivals, Phoenix, of the previous decade’s latter half that had ushered in a new brand of basketball. In his book, Seven Seconds or Less, Sports Illustrated’s Jack MacCallum appropriately named those outfits for their run-and-gun style. Seven seconds or less represented the amount of time in which the Suns planned to get a shot up every time down the floor. Led by Canadian point guard and two-time league MVP Steve Nash, it represented a pace of play that was in direct contrast to the slow-down, grind-it-out style of the 1990s/early 2000s.\n\nThe other piece of irony was that, to fully embrace the spread style, the greatest power forward/center combo who ever lived, Duncan, would have to take a backseat. Not since Jabbar had a superstar been asked to do anything like this on a championship team. Like the Spurs and Duncan, the Suns had their own beast of a big man in Amare Stoudemire. Like Parker was becoming, Nash was the focal point of Phoenix’s high-octane offense. Also, like the Spurs, they were one of the first teams to really value foreign guys. In fact, one of their spicier foreign players was Leandro Barbosa, aka the Brazilian Blur. In a rare misstep, the Spurs drafted and traded Barbosa to Phoenix back in 2003. The Suns’ third foreigner, Boris Diaw, would eventually become a key figure in San Antonio. The similarities were there. They weren’t by accident.\n\nLike with humans and society, basketball’s evolution is and will continue to be a continuous, amorphous process. It took the league five years to crawl out of its epic scoring doldrums, a decline that had been a dozen years in the making starting with the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons in the late 1980s, carried on by Pat Riley’s New York Knicks and more or less adopted by team after team in trying to harness the great Jordan throughout the 1990s. By 1999, just one team managed to score 100 points per game. For context, consider that as recently as 1995, the league scoring AVERAGE was 101.4 points per game. In four years from 1995 to 1999, the league went from approximately 60% of its 27 teams averaging 100 points per game … to a single team. It would improve some at the turn of the decade post Jordan, but almost bottom out again in 2004 when only two teams eclipsed 100 points per game. Although the league scoring average would improve 1.8 points per game, to 93.4, in those five years, it was clear that this brand of basketball was stale. The game seemed to be going the wrong way.\n\nAfter the 2004 season, the league made a huge change for on-ball defenders: They eliminated the hand-checking rule that allowed defenders to place their hands on ball handlers, basically a tolerated and much-too-often-used way of dictating a ball handler’s speed and movement. For teams with point guards who were notoriously difficult to stay in front of, like Nash and Parker, this was a boon. Basketball, a game of movement and grace, had become the opposite: a 94-foot walkathon ripe with grabbing, holding, bumping and outright hacking that was commonplace. During this time, the Spurs were anything but an offensive juggernaut. Then again, few teams were. The game had always been about big men, and they had the fortune of employing one of the best the league had ever seen in Duncan. While the Spurs were winning THEIR way, basketball was changing a decade and a half ago. A new form of winning basketball was emerging, a change that certainly contributed to the unfortunate narrative that the Spurs were somehow boring.\n\nFor context on how sudden this Phoenix offense was and felt at the time, consider that the losing team in all seven 2005 NBA Finals (won by the Spurs) games failed to reach 90 points in regulation. In that same year, Nash led Phoenix to the NBA’s highest per-game scoring average of the past decade, at more than 110 points per game. The 24-second shot clock had never been more irrelevant. For Phoenix, the style was motivated not only out of the personnel they had, but also by using very simple math: If you took more shots than everyone else, wouldn’t that help you routinely score more than they did? Isn’t that the point of this great game of basketball? To outscore your opponent?\n\nWhile the Spurs had battled Phoenix over the second half of the decade during some heated playoff battles, times had changed. Phoenix was now an afterthought, while the Spurs felt different. The loss to Memphis had made them reevaluate. At this time, it was clear something was brewing in San Antonio. It was clearer than Avion that it was different than what we were used to seeing from this proud franchise. The New Yorker’s Reeves Wiedeman described it all aptly in his piece, “The N.B.A.’s Most Boring Team, and Its Best,” on May 21, 2012, the day after the Spurs completed their sweep of the Clippers for their 29th win in 31 games: “If much of the NBA is playing checkers, what the Spurs do is something closer to chess. The Rink Rats have held an ongoing discussion of the North American and European styles of play in hockey; in basketball, the Spurs play a decidedly international game. They have mobile big men, led by Duncan; slashing guards; and an armada of three-point shooters. Their primary offensive set, ‘motion weak,’ is a multi-step process primed to offer multiple angles of attack and to take advantage of the team’s strengths. At each point in the set’s progression, Parker and Ginobili are given choices: to drive, to dish, to shoot. To effectively make these choices, they have to know and trust that the other members of the team will be in the proper position at the proper moment.” Trust, both on and off the court, is a theme with this organization.\n\nWiedeman’s last sentence was so telling, on various levels. In order to “make these choices,” knowing AND trusting your teammates is of paramount importance. It’s basically imperative. Without that trust and team-oriented approach, the knowledge is useless and the “decision” becomes harder to nail. It was a huge reason that, despite Duncan and Ginobli being in their mid-30s (a point where most players retire), the Spurs trio was still effective. In a star-oriented sport, it’s an approach that helped many stars, including the greatest of all, Jordan, win championship rings. The Spurs didn’t have such an alpha dog to rely on; in fact, they had the opposite at this point. It was a triumvirate of grizzled veterans, including one in Parker who was starting to peak. Their model had been hugely successful, and, if anything, this stretch had totally validated it. It wasn’t 2007 anymore. Duncan was 36 years old, and his days of being an absolutely no brainer of a superstar were over. For Popovich, DEMONSTRATING that trust from the top down is something he’s always taken seriously.\n\n“A synergy has to form between the owner, whoever his president is, whoever the GM is, whoever the coach is,” Popovich said in March 2014, according to USA Today’s Sam Amick. “There’s got to be a synergy where there’s a trust. There (are) no walls. There is no territory. Everything is discussed. Everything is fair game. Criticism is welcome, and when you have that, then you have a hell of an organization. That free flow through all those people is what really makes it work. And that includes everything from draft to Os and Xs. Nothing should be left to one area – only to the president, only to the GM, only to the coach – or the culture just doesn’t form. At least that’s what’s worked for us.”\n\nBy 2012, the Spurs were forced to innovate a new way of succeeding. Their wrinkle was that they’d surround their high-end talent with floor spacers, guys who could shoot the ball and make the defense extend to more parts of the court. At this point, Duncan had logged too many minutes for the Spurs to continue to rely on him as they had his first decade in the league. Ginobli could still do plenty of damage in spurts. They were slowly becoming as balanced of a team as they’d been in a long time. Maybe ever. Saying that about a franchise that had won four NBA titles in less than a decade and a half was a somewhat startling proposition. On that end, this was only the beginning of the Spurs’ transformation. Those old, “boring” Spurs? Your older brother’s Spurs THESE WERE NOT.\n\nIn 2012, they seemed to be really peaking at the right time. For context, Jordan’s Bulls won six NBA titles in the 1990s, but never won their first 10 playoff games like the 2012 Spurs did. That the Spurs were doing this in the league’s tougher conference added some genuity. Granted, they squeaked out Game 1 against OKC in the Conference Finals. Up 2-0 as the veteran team against an outfit that was quite the opposite, though, the Spurs were in full command. It started to feel like it was their year. I mean, 20 straight wins? A freaking 31-2 record over more than two months of basketball that included the playoffs? In the spring, when everyone’s effort spikes? Undefeated in the playoffs heading into Game 3 of the Conference Finals? This type of dominance was RARE, as only the Kobe/Shaq Lakers had done so in two decades of NBA basketball.\n\nNot so fast. While the Spurs had long been so reliant on Duncan, it was a tough matchup for him given the athleticism of young Serge Ibaka and stout low-post defender Kendrick Perkins. They lost the next two games in OKC, allowing a preposterous 56% shooting in Game 4, an unacceptable number for a championship hopeful that was coming off a loss. They got outrebounded again, this time by 10. Still, you figured maybe they were just due for a couple hiccups. After all, OKC had a trio of young players who were all regarded as stars or, in the case of Harden, a star in waiting. This was an OKC team that had three players go on to win league MVP honors. Their size and athleticism was becoming a problem for the more beat-you-with-our-brains Spurs. Even worse for the Spurs, the bench was still an issue, one that became exacerbated when Pop moved Ginobli into the starting lineup in place of Danny Green for Game 5 back in San Antonio. Despite Ginobli’s 34 points, the Spurs lost their third straight. That loss was on June 4, the Spurs’ first at home since April 11. It was do or die heading back to OKC, an unthinkable scenario six days prior, when the Spurs had just ripped off their 20th straight win to go up 2-0.\n\nThings change QUICK in the NBA. We see it every few years, where a team down 2-0 just charges back. But the Spurs? The four-time champs? Despite their ironclad pedigree, the Spurs indeed fell on the road for their fourth straight defeat. In essence, they’d been swept after winning 20 straight games. For OKC, who went on to lose in the NBA Finals, it has to be considered one of the most impressive series wins in league history by a team that didn’t win it all. For the Spurs, they knew they had only one way to conquer the OKCs and Miamis of the world given they couldn’t outstar them: They had to beat them with brains, depth and trust. Given Duncan had just turned 36, the superstar approach seemed like a pipe dream for the Spurs.\n\nSETTING THE BLUEPRINT FOR A CULTURE OF US\n\nThe first two names who come to mind when talking about the Spurs dynasty are Duncan and Pop, of course (former General Manager and now CEO R.C. Buford’s role, in my view, is the only other who can rival them.) Like seemingly many of team sports’ most legendary coaches (think Red Auerbach, John Wooden, Mike Krzyzewski, Bob Knight and Bill Belichick), Popovich had a direct military influence. Like Krzyzewski, he attended a military college, the United States Air Force Academy. Two huge themes from these settings are TEAM and DISCIPLINE. I believe most people with such military experience will concur there. I also think most, if not all, military and service people will tell you that it’s unique in the following: Once you enter, you’re no longer an individual. You’re part of something bigger. There’s a sense of collectiveness, a team feel, one only intensified by exhaustive hours of arduous training and the possibility of eventually heading into battle. Your life as you knew it, as an INDIVIDUAL … is over.\n\nFor Popovich, the Spurs were almost perfect in this sense. The reason for that was Robinson, Pop’s best player when taking over in 1996. To have his best player not only be a really likable teammate and individual in general, but also a graduate of the Naval Academy, was big for the Spurs when looking back. Even the most ardent Spurs defender would admit that the franchise was lucky to enjoy one of Robinson and Duncan. To have them overlap to the point that at least one was on the team for more than a quarter century? It’s basically a God send in a league chock full of egos, endorsement angling, larger-than-life personalities, branding and players fighting for attention, money and shoe deals. None of those things really applied to the Spurs’ twin towers. Sure, Robinson did his Mr. Robinson’s Neighborhood commercial in the 1990s, but always with a smile and without a hint of self indulgence. Perhaps most noticeable about the commercial is the presence of his coach, Larry Brown, a pretty rare inclusion for any star (seriously, who the fuck does THAT now?). It was that type of selflessness, sharing and winning leadership template that would eventually allow the team to assimilate players from literally all around the globe into their locker room. Always without interruption.\n\nWhether it’s been his pioneer status as a coach of foreign players or finding great use of players for whom other teams had NO USE, inclusion is another Pop staple. On the other hand, no one is special. There is no coddling. According to ESPN’s Baxter Holmes back in February 2016, Pop relayed the following: “For us, it's easy. We're looking for character, but what the hell does that mean? We're looking for people — and I've said it many times — [who] have gotten over themselves, and you can tell that pretty quickly. You can talk to somebody for four or five minutes, and you can tell if it's about them, or if they understand that they're just a piece of the puzzle. So we look for that. A sense of humor is a huge thing with us. You've got to be able to laugh.” Pop’s stance of being anti-entitlement has fostered a selfless team culture that now spans nearly a quarter century. “(People) think that they're entitled to what they have ... So we talk about those things all the time. You have no excuse not to work your best. You have no reason not to be thankful everyday that you have the opportunity to come back from a defeat, because some people never even have the opportunity.”\n\nThis is where that all-important matter of culture comes into play for this franchise. Time after time after time, going back two decades now, the Spurs have mastered the “on their up way or on their way down” game. MOST often over these two plus decades, the makeup of the roster around the big three or four on the team has been roughly a split of winning veterans and undervalued youngsters (many of whom are foreign players who we’ll get to). While the NBA has far less parity than Major League Baseball in terms of teams’ salary sheets, let’s remember that, just 15 years ago, teams were allowed to spend less than 40% of what they can today. It was harder back then to not only create a winning team, but to sustain one. Didn’t matter for the Spurs.\n\nQuick, over more than two decades now, name me their highest profile free agent. (Cue the hand to chin emoji.) Finley, maybe? The point is that the Spurs were not just going out and chucking money around. There was a method. Yes, having a generational superstar is great. The Spurs did a great job of surrounding Duncan, though. Just like any other industry, the NBA has market inefficiencies. The Spurs were wise enough to know that they had the top-end talent at the beginning, so for their first title team in 1999, it was about bringing in WINNING ADULTS such as two-time NBA champion Mario Elie, 35, and Jerome Kersey, 36, a player who’d been to two NBA Finals. Will Perdue and Steve Kerr had won titles with the Bulls. In the late 1990s/early 2000s, it was guys like Terry Porter, Steve Smith and Robert Horry. In the late 2000s/2010s, it was Tracy McGrady, Antonio McDyess and Richard Jefferson. The years may have passed. The blueprint didn’t. Yet.\n\nWhat you saw instead of high-priced free agents was a very clear pattern in terms of the kind of people brought to the franchise. Take Pop’s first full season in 1997/98. That team would include three guys who would go on to become NBA head coaches in Avery Johnson, Vinny Del Negro and Monty Williams. The next year, future NBA Head Coach and GM Steve Kerr joined the Spurs. The year after that it was future coach Porter. In the beginning, the veteran “on their way down” types were likely these future coaches. As the years passed and the stakes heightened, it became guys like Horry and Michael Finley, players who’d spent essentially their whole careers on winners. Once the culture is established, it becomes strong enough that SO MANY different backgrounds in one locker room can not only function but also THRIVE.\n\nThe Spurs had such a culture, for sure. What does that REALLY mean, though? It’s used fairly vaguely these days, but exactly what does CULTURE represent? In today’s world, culture is more important than it’s ever been. Why? It’s simple: We live among more cultures in the United States right now than we have at any point in history, it’s just natural evolution. If we take that as fact, then don’t we all need to recognize how important EACH culture is and to respect it as if it’s our own? How do you make that happen, though? It starts with trust, which begins with connecting.\n\nWhen I was a junior at Syracuse University, I took a class called “Communication and Community” that would really change how I looked at things. My teacher was a special man from Trinidad named Amardo Rodriguez, who authored On Being Human: Notes on the Human Condition. One day, he very directly asked the class a simple question: “How often do you use trust in your everyday life? Do you use it every day?” We all were sort of caught off guard by the question, so we pondered. We generally agreed that we probably engage in the act of trusting a few times per week, not every day, though. Then, he asked, “How many of you drive?” After we responded that we all pretty much do, he explained that, in that case alone, you use trust every day. He explained that, when driving, you’re trusting that the person heading in your direction in the other lane, someone whose identity we’re routinely clueless about, won’t crash into you. He explained that we do it OVER AND OVER. From that day forward, I knew that trust was an absolutely everyday deal in life.\n\nTrust is paramount in sports, too. In order to get the VERY BEST out of each individual, it’s hard to sit here and say that feat is possible without a high level of trust from the players. At young ages, these players are thrust into organizations NOT of their choosing. They’re immediately showered with high salaries (generally speaking, of course). They don’t know their coaches, front office people or trainers from a cab driver. They have to assimilate into a team AND develop themselves. It’s a lot. Probably most importantly, they can’t be expected to be a fully mature adult at that point in life. There’s a reason NBA coaching staffs are usually at least five coaches deep. Now, imagine, you’re new to the United States altogether. On top of ALL the stuff every NBA newbie has to face, you have to learn and figure out how to assimilate into a new culture. How do you get guys to do THAT while expecting them to focus on their craft? Well, you connect.\n\nPerhaps the best comparison for what the Spurs’ brass values might be those of the man Fortune called “the world’s best leader” in 2017: Theo Epstein, President of the Chicago Cubs. Character is heavily involved when mining players. Are there signs of self motivation? Is there a work ethic, a passion? Are they team-oriented? It’s not coincidental. It sure as hell isn’t luck, either, when you define what you’re looking for in a player, see it, know how to value it and not only know how to acquire it, but use it, too. Epstein used a high-character-or-the-highway approach to build Major League Baseball’s 2016 World Champion Chicago Cubs, a franchise devoid of a championship for 108 seasons, essentially from scratch. Like the Spurs, he had to figure out how to guide a collection of backgrounds and languages. More importantly, both the Spurs and Cubs value a human element that too often gets lost.\n\nTake this anecdote from Tom Verducci’s The Cubs Way, as he discussed Epstein’s penchant for holding trust and relationships in extremely high regard. Epstein says, “talent wins, but … It’s like every year I did the job I just developed a greater appreciation for how much the human element matters and how much you can achieve as a team when you have players who care about winning, care about each other, develop those relationships, have those conversations … it creates an environment where the sum is greater than the parts.” On The Ringer’s “Flying Coach” podcast, eight-time NBA Champion, former player under Pop and current Head Coach of the Golden State Warriors Kerr said the following: “Pop (especially), in his time with the Spurs. I played four years there. You could feel his humility ... almost like a good parent, like you didn’t want to disappoint him. You know? Because you knew how much he cared about you, but you also knew he knew exactly what he was talking about. I think that’s a really powerful position to be in as a coach, is to understand that relationship with your players where you’re not telling them what to do, you’re trying to bring the best out of them.”\n\nAs was the case with countless Cubs and Spurs, they had to do it in a foreign country, too. According to Verducci, Epstein has the following two core principles among his six: The first is “we will treat the development of every player as if we were making a personal investment in him.” The other is “we will embrace the cultures of and backgrounds of all of our players, foreign and domestic …” The words “personal investment” and “embrace the cultures and backgrounds” are certainly part of the Spurs’ methodology as well, regardless if they’re actually documented like this. As far as the NBA was concerned, the Spurs were unique and unprecedented in terms of roster diversity. Within it, player development and personal growth seemed to similarly be not only equally prioritized, but treated as one in the same. The smartest organizations know this. They realize the kid who’s a knucklehead at 22 might be different five years later. Is it a coincidence that, in his first three years on the job, Pop just happened to have five guys who would go on to coach in the league? Did it just happen to work out that way? Looking back, it’s hard not to think that it was set up that way to help instill a winning locker room. What the Spurs probably didn’t know at the time was that it would prove to be a culture that helped them outlast all other modern dynasties in league history.\n\nThe fact that they had that many eventual NBA coaches also spoke to Pop’s instincts and ability with people. According to McCallum’s 2013 piece, the coach was clear what his leadership style prioritized. “Yes, we're disciplined with what we do. But that's not enough. Relationships with people are what it's all about. You have to make players realize you care about them. And they have to care about each other and be interested in each other. Then they start to feel a responsibility toward each other. Then they want to do for each other. And I have always thought it helps if you can make it fun, and one of the ways you do that is let them think you're a little crazy, that you're interested in things outside of basketball. 'Are there weapons of mass destruction? Or aren't there? What, don't you read the papers?' You have to give the message that the world is wider than a basketball court.”\n\nTreating everyone with respect while not treating them exactly the same can be a tough balancing act. Again, though, it’s one of the hidden secrets of this Spurs run. Communicating with versatility is another Pop strength. According to McCallum, “handling people is his strength. He and Duncan talk as kindred souls, he and Ginóbili as political analysts, he and Parker as old guy to young guy. When Bowen, a master of disingenuousness, was there, their lingua franca was sarcasm.” It didn’t stop there either. According to a 2005 profile by Liz Robbins of the New York Times, Pop “would actually converse in broken Serbian” with a couple European players. She goes on to explain that “Popovich has always reveled in this communicative challenge. ‘Most people just didn't believe it, they didn't want foreign kids, thinking they didn't speak English and it's going to be a pain,’” Pop said back in 2005. It speaks to his ability to lead such a successful outfit for so long. Name any modern day North American basketball coach or baseball manager: Greg Popovich has had a longer/more successful run with one franchise than ALL OF THEM. Was it any surprise, then, that a coach so in tune with and fascinated by foreign culture would … value foreign players?"
