        "text": "In the first major trade of the offseason, the Milwaukee Bucks sent Richard Jefferson to the San Antonio Spurs for defensive specialist Bruce Bowen, Kurt Thomas, and Fabricio Oberto.\n\nThe Spurs receive a third scoring option from the starting lineup in Jefferson, who will most likely be inserted at the small forward position.\n\nThe Bucks lose a top scorer, but receive one of the top defensive players in the league in Bowen and receive some much-needed size in Thomas and Oberto.\n\nThis could be the first sign that the Spurs are breaking up the core they've had for the past decade, especially considering the trade rumors surrounding Manu Ginobili since San Antonio's season ended.\n\nIf Ginobili decides to stay, the Spurs could be looking for another championship run with four scorers. The loss of Bowen, though, could affect chemistry between the close knit team.\n\nAfter his injury-plagued first season with the team, Bowen has only missed three games in seven years with the Spurs\n\nThe Bucks, who are coming off a roller coaster season where two of their top players were lost for the season to injury, will get some much-needed help. Oberto and Thomas bring great size and can provide some stability off the bench for Milwaukee, who's current center options are Francisco Elson and Dan Gadzuric.\n\nBowen will become the new small forward—barring any other blockbuster trades—with Joe Alexander gaining more minutes.\n\nIf there are no other trades from the two teams, the Spurs would feature a lineup with Tony Parker at point guard, Roger Mason at shooting guard, Richard Jefferson at small forward, Tim Duncan at power forward, and Matt Bonner at center."
