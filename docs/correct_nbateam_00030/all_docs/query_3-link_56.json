Mandatory Credit: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThere’s a simple formula for LeBron James to dominate in every contest and there are only three steps to it. James will have to use it for a title repeat.\n\nLeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers are the defending NBA champions. In what was one of the best NBA Finals series ever, the Cavs prevailed against all odds and down 3-1, came back to beat the 73-9 Golden State Warriors. The victory itself was miraculous. The parade was one of the greatest moment’s in sports history. The ESPY Awards was public acknowledgment of the what James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and the rest of the Cavs had accomplished. The ring ceremony will be icing on the cake, to say the least.\n\nJames has returned to Cleveland and completely changed the culture of the franchise. It’s an even better franchise than what it was when he left it. After the Larry O’Brien trophy left with the Cavaliers after Game 7 of the NBA Finals, James went from being an immortalized player in Cleveland to a deified persona. Now James, like Michael Jordan, has his own mythic tale that the players after him can only aspire to.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have their first NBA Finals banner to raise. Yet, James and the rest of the Cavs aren’t satisfied with just one NBA championship. If James has anything to say about it, that NBA Finals win won’t be their last.\n\nJames is the most physically gifted and naturally talented player in the NBA and he’s as cerebral as they come. If there’s been one problem he’s had in his career, it’s that James has to do literally everything. There’s been no constant and consistent blueprint to how he should be utilized game-by-game. This season that should all change.\n\nThis year’s Cleveland Cavaliers are more comfortable with each other and the improved chemistry will show in James’ game. As James’ role is refined, the Cavs will become a well-oiled machine. James can all but guarantee the Cleveland Cavaliers another NBA Finals appearance. If he wants to win an NBA championship there are three keys to doing so.\n\nMar 23, 2016; Cleveland, OH, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) dunks in the first quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks at Quicken Loans Arena.

Both Irving and Love are elite scorers. They make shots from all levels and the duo scores efficiently. However, their method of operation differs from James’ so there’s no redundancy within the styles of the Big Three. As a matter of fact, their offensive uniqueness was a major factor in James’ return to Cleveland.\n\nHow many power forwards are elite rebounders, inside-outside threats, above-average three-point shooters, and able to throw full-court passes for assists in transition? One. Love. How many point guards can break down any defender off-the-dribble one-on-one, make acrobat finishes around the basket look easy, and have a silky smooth shot out past three-point range? Two. Irving and two-time MVP Stephen Curry.\n\nHow many players are nearly unstoppable when they’re barreling towards the rim with physicality, have the finesse to make nearly any shot around the rim, have shown the ability to be a knockdown shooter, have an efficient and ever-expanding post game, and can expose every weakness of the opposing defense in the pick-and-roll? Just James.\n\nOut of the trio, James is the most dominant player with the ball in his hands. He has the power to physically impose his will on defense and the touch to score the ball with efficiency. He also has the versatility to score in isolation, in post-ups, off-the ball, and in the pick-and-roll. Most importantly he’s arguably the most intelligent basketball player in the NBA and knows how to beat his opponent in seemingly every situation.\n\nFeb 21, 2016; Oklahoma City, OK, USA; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) controls the ball as Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant (35) defends during the first quarter at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, John Wall, and James are all in that category. Even James Harden fits the mold of a true floor general, to that point. It’s up to them to be the maestro of the offense and put everybody in the right position. Yet, the NBA has changed. Point guards have gone from being lauded for their ability to facilitate or defend to being praised for their ability to score.\n\nCurry, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and Irving are the face of the new era of NBA point guards. Their abilities to pour points on opponents at the point guard position puts opposing coaches in a pickle. They have to guard a guy who can score with ease, but who always has the ball in his hands. As a result, they’ll trap the ball-handler after he crosses half-court, double him incessantly, anything to get the ball out of the other players hands. The point guard’s teammates are often in scoring position as a result.\n\nYet, it’s hard for players to be elite scorers and true floor generals. Players often can to do both but find it hard to balance both duties. Only Paul, and perhaps Wall, can be considered to be elite scorers and true floor generals. But having a true floor general in the NBA is as beneficial as ever for a team that wants to operate with intelligence and efficiency.\n\nRegardless of position, a player who can put his teammates in the right position to score is key to an elite team’s championship aspirations. It’s one reason that Draymond Green, Harden, and James are so beneficial to their teams. They keep the ducks in a row.\n\nWhen James is on the floor, every Cleveland Cavalier knows their role on the floor offensively. He’ll also diligently find them while their open. His basketball IQ has allowed him to expose team’s defenses while he uses his awareness to set up his teammates for easy baskets. There’s many times where James operates like Peyton Manning pre-snap with how he directs his Cavaliers teammates and sends a pass flying to them that the opponent never saw coming but probably should have.\n\nMost of the Cleveland Cavaliers are unable to consistently break down their opponents off-the-dribble and it’s up to one of them who can to find them. Out of the players for the Cavs who can get into the lane at will, James is far and away the best passer. He’s also the smartest player. It will be up to him, primarily, to find the shooters on the perimeter and big men as they roll to the basket.\n\nBe The Team’s Best Defensive Threat\n\nFrom a visual standpoint, if there’s one thing that James can stand to do it’s get up in his man. However, from a technical and schematic standpoint, James playing off of his man allows him to be a better team defender. When he’s not suffocating a defender’s airspace he keeps the ball action where he can see it and rotate out to open shooter.\n\nIn the regular season, James caused spot-up shooters to shoot a paltry 31.1 percent from the field. He was also effective guarding the pick-and-roll and held ball-handlers to 33.9 percent shooting from the field.\n\nJames always gets down into his defensive stance and uses his length and athleticism well to challenge defenders on the perimeter. In isolation situations, James only allowed opponents to shoot 26.9 percent from the field.\n\nHe also jumps the passing lanes well. In the playoffs, the only time hustle stats were recorded last year, James was tied for sixth in pass deflections with 3.0 per game. Those numbers had him tied with Avery Bradley and Chris Paul, both notorious defenders.\n\nJames’ perimeter defense is outstanding and it will need to continue to be elite for the Cleveland Cavaliers to repeat as NBA champions.\n\nWhile the Cleveland Cavaliers thrive off of turnovers, there are much simpler reasons to be an outstanding defensive squad. The first reason is that there’s a correlation between defense and championships. The second is that James, for the first time in his career, can focus more on being a defensive pest rather than an elite scorer. James is already a lockdown defender. He even holds opponents to 40.0 percent shooting in the post. Those are numbers on par with Rudy Gobert’s defense.\n\nIn Tyronn Lue’s rotation, Richard Jefferson is still the primary backup for James. Behind Jefferson at small forward is James Jones, another player near retirement. To put it bluntly, neither Jefferson or Jones will have nearly the defensive impact James provides. This is an issue that will be exposed in the games that James is off-the-court. It’s also one of the reasons the young depth of the Cleveland Cavaliers are so important. Their defensive potential.\n\nJames can guard any player on the court from the point guard to the center, and he should. When James is in the game, he’ll have to play as well as he can on both ends because there’s a monumental drop-off in the depth behind him defensively. This season, defense should be one of James’ three priorities every game.\n\nMay 23, 2016; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) reacts as he dunks for a basket against Toronto Raptors in the second quarter of game four of the Eastern conference finals of the NBA Playoffs at Air Canada Centre. Mandatory Credit: Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLeBron’s Outlook For 2016-17\n\nLeBron James is the centerpiece of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Not just in the sense that he’s the most important player in the Cavs quest to repeat, but in terms of the rest of his team has to move around him. They follow James’ cue and lead, and James acknowledges this fact. He embraces it.\n\nHe is the best offensive conductor there is in the NBA. It’s not just his ability to pass from any angle or any distance. It doesn’t just come down to his incredible basketball awareness either. James is unique in that he can get anywhere he wants on the court and be a mismatch physically.\n\nMore from King James Gospel\n\nJames’ passing is the threat that makes him more dangerous than his inability to be stopped as he runs right at the rim. When he is hitting his shots outside of the paint, he’s the most unstoppable player in the NBA because he already naturally has everything else.\n\nAlthough James will need to set the tone and takeover the scoring when the Cavs need it, the team will be better off if they let Irving and Love handle the bulk of the scoring. James, who already does the bulk of the Cavs facilitating, will be asked to play as the team’s point guard more than ever. This gameplan will allow James to exert more energy on the defensive end.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers can repeat as NBA champions, James just must follow a blueprint for success. The team has the pieces to make it work and the best player in the world. By focusing on these three keys every game, James will be in line to win another NBA Finals series.\n\nWhat do you think LeBron James needs to do to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to a second consecutive NBA championship?
