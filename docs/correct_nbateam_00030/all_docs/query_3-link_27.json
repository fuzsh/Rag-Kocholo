        "text": "THE EURO/SOUTH AMERICA INFLUENCE\n\nYou simply can’t tell the story of this Spurs dynasty, especially the 2014 team, without taking a deep dive into the league’s history of diversity. The Spur dynasty was buoyed by the combination of stealing Parker and Ginobli. Duncan would have certainly won three rings or so, but these two helped him max out his title count. It should be more, too, considering Derek Fisher’s historic shot to win Game 5 in 2004 and then THE most historic shot, which is an integral part of this piece, almost a decade later. In basketball, the European style and game has a fascinating history here in the U.S. After a host of Euros such as Detlef Schrempf (1985) and the late Drazen Petrovic (1986) introduced America to capable foreign-born NBA players who more than held their own at the end of the 1980s, the league slowly began to embrace European players (I want to be clear here: At this point, I’m only talking Euros who came directly from overseas to the league, no college here. South American players in the U.S. did not exist at this point.). However, for whatever reason, it was a very gradual process.\n\nMiller rebounds a James three attempt that almost broke the backboard with 23 seconds left, then passes back out to a wide open, stepping perfectly into his shot James for three. Good. Spurs 94 Heat 92, 20 seconds left.\n\nSome of it had to do with markets, as was likely the case for Golden State Warrior Lithuanian Sarunas Marciulionis playing all the way out in Oakland, California. According to Robbins, “in 1988 Popovich persuaded Larry Brown and the Spurs' general manager, Bob Bass, to send him to Cologne, Germany, to scout players at the Euroleague championships. During those championships, Popovich recalled seeing only one other N.B.A. coach -- Don Nelson, then at Golden State, who is responsible for starting the international wave of players by signing Lithuania's Sarunas Marciulionis in 1989.” In a moment of truth from the legendary coach, he said the following according to Robbins: “When I saw Nellie over there on that trip, I knew we were on the right track.” His thinking would certainly prove prophetic.\n\nExposure certainly helped in those days. If you weren’t on an elite team, you weren’t as well known (at least outside the major NBA markets of LA, New York, Boston and Philly). We’re way before any thought of social media here. Hell, there wasn’t even League Pass at this point. If you were an East Coast soul trying to see a Western Conference team, you had to wait till they played YOUR team or on national TV. After Vlade Divac went 26th in the 1989 draft, Toni Kukoc going at 29 in 1990 represented the only Euro first round pick until the iconic and completely unforgettable Gheorghe Muresan (he was 7’ 7” tall, and dude resembled someone out of the Adams family. Let’s just say he was known.) went 30th in the 1993 draft. It was sort of strange given how well Divac had played in the 1991 NBA Finals, a high-profile clash between Jordan and Magic. The greatest team ever assembled, the U.S. Men’s Olympic Dream Team in 1992, became iconic globally. It helped put basketball in Europeans’ minds. It planted the seed.\n\nOn the cusp of their first title at the beginning of the 1990s, the Bulls would do something that the dynasty Spurs would mimic the following decade: draft and stash. In the Bulls’ case, Kukoc was a tantalizing talent. He was long, at 6’ 9”, a smooth lefty with a nice stroke. He could handle the ball well for a guy his size. The Bulls stashed him overseas until Jordan left them abruptly after winning the 1993 NBA title. When they brought him over, the results were mixed for the 25-year old. He had an uneven first season, one highlighted by fellow teammate and future Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen refusing to go into a playoff game that year after coach Phil Jackson drew up a final play for the Euro rookie, not three-time champ Pippen. In what still remains one of the oddest sports situations I’ve ever seen, Kukoc NAILED the game winner, beating the hated New York Knicks. It might be the single most under-the-radar part of Jordan’s unforgettable, historic mid-career retirement: The vacuum it put Kukoc in to perform on a world stage, for all to see. No matter what anyone says, it’s one of the most seminal moments of European basketball in this country, ever. The league just was not looking at Euros. That was about to change.\n\nThe next year, in 1995, Kukoc really began to blossom. It was his best season as a teammate of Pippen, as he averaged 15.7 pts per night at better than 50% shooting. His 4.6 assists per game spoke to his playmaking ability. His all-around game was shining. Also, despite the shadow of the greatest player of all time making his iconic return before the 1995 playoffs, Kukoc actually raised his game in the playoffs that year, putting up 13.7 pts/5.7 assists (3-1 assist-to-turnover ratio)/6.8 rebounds on almost 44% from three per night. Almost two full years of Kukoc, sans Jordan, playing for the most high-profile team in the league AND excelling while doing it helped open the floodgates for European players. Four Euros were taken in the first round of the 1996 draft, representing more than 1990-1995 combined (3).\n\nEven though none were taken in the first round in 1997, that was the first year we saw a move that would become quite common over the next couple decades: taking second round fliers on European guys. There were four in 1997. The following year was also a landmark year for Euros, but for a different reason. Pre Draft, word was starting to leak out that there was this Larry-Bird-like European prospect, who some thought was absolutely a can’t miss. Dirk Nowitzki, who ironically had many battles with in-state rival San Antonio AND was picked 9th despite no one who was drafted ahead of him being remotely close to his level (FACT), was the final piece for Europeans. He was one of four Euro first rounders that year. His presence completely transformed the game.\n\nThe league was in a weird spot at the end of the 1990s, which, despite Jordan’s presence, had been littered with albatross contracts, eye-popping dollars and bad attitudes. There was A TON of isolation ball, and offense was rapidly declining. In addition, while Euros were certainly gaining the confidence of NBA execs, so too were kids coming straight to the league from high school. Between Euros who scouts still weren’t positive how to view and the completely underdeveloped “talents,” never before was there THIS MUCH uncertainty in picking players. The game was changing. As always, the teams quickest to recognize the shift were going to be the ones standing on top heading into the new century.\n\nThe Spurs were in a unique spot themselves, having just won an abbreviated season’s NBA title, the franchise’s first. The 1999 draft, looking back, went mostly as it should have. But there was one enormous, hugely notable exception: Ginobli. The Spurs simply hit the lottery with Ginobli, a future Hall of Famer who they’d draft with the 57th pick. The eventual four-time NBA Champion was an enormous grab. It would begin a trend of San Antonio valuing foreign players more than any other NBA franchise, one that helped spawn a dynasty-type franchise to heights that few others have ever reached.\n\nBy 2000, things had really changed with the draft. High school players were becoming more accepted. Foreign players were all of a sudden more intriguing. Three- and four-year college players started facing questions about whether they were good enough given they hadn’t entered the draft as underclassmen. A market correction was coming, and, looking back, it was really something. In one of the worst drafts in league history, in 2000, Darius Miles became the highest pick ever, third overall, to come to the NBA straight from high school. Comically, it got to the point in the late 1990s/early 2000s where teams were clearly favoring Euro players over homegrown domestic guys. Looking back, some of the examples are JAW DROPPING. In the 1999 draft, the Knicks took Frederic Weiss over homegrown talent Ron Artest. In 2002, Nikoloz Tskitishvili and his four-year career went before studs like Amare Stoudemire and Caron Butler.\n\nThe 2001 draft proved to be somewhat of a turning point. Despite Miles’s uneven rookie year in 2001, it was as if some sort of forcefield had been removed from high school players and Euros. All of a sudden, they became the apples of NBA executives’ eyes. According to Simmons’s recent 2001 Redraftables podcast with Lowe, “There was a sense that we felt at the time that something was really shifting with the draft because, by this point, Dirk was having real success as a foreign-born player, we started hearing the rumblings about Manu, maybe the Spurs had lucked out and he was going to come over at some point. And then, with the high schoolers, KG (Kevin Garnett) was a top 15 guy, Kobe was rounding into a superstar and there was a sense of ‘where is this thing going, where is this heading?’” It’s fairly indisputable when the first, second, fourth and eighth picks in 2001 were all high school players. The third pick? Pau Gasol, the highest Euro player selected up to that point. On the flip side, players from high-profile, winning college programs such as Shane Battier and Richard Jefferson went later. Future NBA All-Star Zach Randolph went 19th because he only played one year of college. A Belgian point guard fell, too.\n\nDespite being both a foreigner and a youngster (19 years old at the time), Tony Parker was still an afterthought heading into the draft. Generally speaking, the point guards of the 1990s had been either scorers and/or athletes. Floor generals (think John Stockton and Isiah Thomas) were becoming phased out because there was so much one-on-one action on the wings, the spot where the league seemed more loaded than ever. (As an avid Boston Celtics fan, what happened next will forever hurt.) At 6’ 2”, Parker was undersized. He was by absolutely no means a leaper. Yes, foreign players were gaining in popularity, but they’d all been big men as far as first round picks were concerned. After all, this IS the NBA. Size more than matters. Take all Euro first round picks from 1996-2000, height listed in parentheses: Peja Stojaković (6’ 9”), Zydrunas Ilgauskas (7’ 3”), Efthimi Rentzias (6’ 11”), Martin Muursepp (6’ 9”), Chris Anstey (7’ 0”), Nowitzki (7’ 0”), Rasho Nesterovic (7’ 0”), Mirsad Turkcan (6’ 9”), Vladimir Stepania (7’ 0”), Frederic Weis (7’ 2”), Andrei Kirilenko (6’ 9”), Hedo Turkoglu (6’ 10”), Dalibor Bagarić (7’ 1”), Jake Tsakalidis (7’ 2”) and Primoz Brezec (7’ 2”). Size, size … more size. Three other foreign big men went before Parker in the 2001 draft.\n\nIt didn’t help that a wave of bigger point guards had not only preceded him, but thrived on winners. Gary Payton (6’ 4”), Penny Hardaway (6’ 7”) and Jason Kidd (6’ 4”) were all thriving as larger-than-normal point guards. Payton and Hardaway both played in an NBA Finals in the mid-1990s, while Kidd would eventually lead the New Jersey Nets to back-to-back NBA Finals appearances. Obviously, context proves how gutsy the Parker pick was for the Spurs. While Raul Lopez was the first foreign point guard drafted in the first round, Parker followed four picks after. According to Simmons, there was also some luck involved, as the Celtics were rumored to select him. “There’s a ton of rumors in Boston at the time, they’re gonna take Tony Parker at number 21. He came on my podcast, I think in 2013, and I’d always heard they were gonna take him, so I asked him, ‘how close was it?’ He said they gave him the hat.” As an NBA draftee, when you receive merchandise from a team before being picked, it’s ALWAYS a sign they’re about to draft you. At worst, you’ll get picked and traded. Unfortunately, for Celtic fans like me, Boston pivoted. The rest is history. The Spurs swooped in to steal Parker with the 28th pick.\n\nIn addition to having size, 1990s point guards started to become more scorer types. Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and even guys like Sam Cassell were SCORERS more than traditional point GODs. Parker would certainly prove he could score with his patented floater, but he was a more capable facilitator than any, outside of the great Kidd. He had both a speed and ability to probe that went hand in hand, a style that had been rare in the sport. Parker struggled to shoot the ball when he first came over, at least compared to what he’d do for most of his career. He was never a marksman/shooter from deep; however, by year four in 2005, he was shooting over 48% because of his ability to get into the paint and use his patented floater to score. He was a career 49% shooter, for context. He was the first of a few key Spurs that noted “shot doctor/shot whisperer” Chip Engelland completely transformed into a viable shooter. Later, and probably most notable of all, would be Kawhi Leonard, followed by Marco Belinelli. Engelland’s influence and ability to rebuild professional’s shots is well documented.\n\nThe 2002 draft was the first of two times a foreign player coming directly to the U.S. without having played college here, this time from China, would be the top pick. After Yao Ming, four other foreign players at least 6’ 6” tall were picked in the top 16 in 2002. The Spurs were on to things at this point. In 2002, they mined Luis Scola with the 58th pick out of Argentina, a country they’d begin to focus on over the next decade. The trend of Euros and now South Americans going in the second round was really starting to pick up, and the Spurs would once again get great value here. Scola had a 10-year NBA career that could’ve easily been longer had he come to the U.S. earlier.\n\nThe 2003 NBA draft remains one of the most iconic in league history given it included James. Darko Milicic, in one of the more shocking developments in the league’s draft history, went second. It was the highest a European player had been chosen. Too bad he was taken ahead of three future Hall of Famers (Bosh, Carmelo Anthony and Wade). By this time, a lot of execs were looking at European and other foreign players as at least worthy of a first round flier. The Nowitzki (Germany) draft started a trend where every draft had a clearly undervalued Euro. Dirk was it in 1998. Besides the Ginobli heist, Andrei Kirilenko (Russia) went 24th in 1999 and ended up playing 13 seasons. Hedo Turkoglu (Turkey) went 15th in 2000 and played 15 seasons, including with a few really good Sacramento, San Antonio and Orlando teams. In 2001, it was Parker (Belgium) and Mehmet Okur (Turkey), who went 38th and had a 10-year career. By this time, the floodgates were completely opened. The onset of high school eligible draftees and capable Euros created a completely new draft dynamic. It also opened new markets and undervalued players on whom to pounce.\n\nAs far as the San Antonio Spurs were concerned, they were more than happy to have high school players be eligible for the draft given they had no real desire to use a pick on one. Beginning with the Parker pick in 2001, San Antonio was starting to set a blueprint for drafting player after player who turned out to be undervalued. They did so twice in 2002, stealing the aforementioned Scola and choosing John Salmons at 26. Two facts for added context should be noted, per Salmons: The first was that he was a four-year starter at the University of Miami. A Spur preference. Second, of the 48 players who went after the 10th pick of the 2002 draft, Salmons, despite going at 26, enjoyed the third longest NBA career. Only Matt Barnes and Tayshaun Prince had longer careers. Perhaps even more impressive at pick 56, only six such players beat Scola’s 10-year career. It speaks to the savvy of the Spurs in choosing certain types of players. If you go back throughout the aughts, the evidence is clear: Year in, year out, the Spurs exploited the foreign market like a stock broker getting rich off penny stocks.\n\nIt continued to pay off. In 2003, it was stealing Leandro Barbosa and his eventual 14-year career at pick 28. Ironically, Barbosa would be part of the two different NBA outfits that were arguably the most unique of the post millennium/Jordan era: The Seven Seconds or Less Phoenix Suns of later that decade and the Golden State dynasty of the following decade. In what’s been called part of an ill-fated attempt to lure Jason Kidd to San Antonio, the Spurs immediately traded Barbosa. Having been unable to actually add a player from the previous draft to their roster, the Spurs were in familiar territory when picking at the end of the first round. AGAIN, they went Euro. AGAIN, they were rewarded. Beno Udrih (13-year career) fell to them at 28. The Spurs and R.C. Buford to foreign players were like bees to honey. They kept getting players who’d have long careers and prove they were drafted too low.\n\nDuring a time when the league was going overboard with high school prospects, the Spurs went the other way, drafting European players who were more polished than early entree underclassmen. To this day, the Spurs have only technically DRAFTED one high school prospect, Leon Smith in 1999, but he was immediately traded. At this point in time, that may not sound like a big deal; however, when you consider that 30 such prospects were taken between 1995 and 2004, it’s certainly worth noting. (Another nine were chosen in 2005, the final year of high school eligibility.) The Spurs continued to go the other way.\n\nWhile the league’s Euro craze peaked mid-decade, something ELSE was happening ON the court: These foreign players were bringing a style that was unique to the league. And more team oriented. Further, that Parker and Ginobli were displaying their games on the world’s biggest stage (three NBA titles in five years between 2003 and 2007) WHILE winning wasn’t being lost on the league. Hell, if you ask most people who follow the league which team was the most fun to watch in the 2000s, almost all would include the Nash Suns, while many would certainly include Ginobli among the league’s most entertaining players.\n\nPartly due to the elimination of high school eligible draftees and the onset of the one-and-done rule in the NCAA, the 2006 draft was also historic. In general, the Euro craze peaked with Andrea Bargnani going first in 2006. It ended up aiding the Spurs, as the foreign player craze was more or less grounded. Bargnani made a lot of executives stop and say, “wait, what the hell are we doing here?” after it became evident that he was average at best. While the Spurs still managed to get their players, the 2007 draft was one of regret.\n\nBy the time the draft rolled around in 2007, the Spurs had won four NBA titles since the 1998-99 lockout season. Although (surprise!) the Spurs drafted one of five foreign players in the first round that year, Marco Belinelli was picked by Golden State and would become a key member of the 2014 team’s bench (again, molded by Engelland). The best team architects CONSISTENTLY find players, no matter if they’re picking in the lotto or routinely picking POST lotto, as the Spurs were. They nabbed Tiago Splitter from Brazil with the 28th pick. While he turned out to be a fine player and contributor, a tall Spaniard whose brother was already a star in the league ended up going 20 spots later in Marc Gasol. Taken by the rival Lakers in that draft, he’d become a trade chip of historic proportions later on in the 2007-08 season.\n\nWhen the Gasol brothers trade went down in 2008, I’ll never forget the normally reserved Popovich going postal about it. The Lakers, in one of this century’s most unheralded NBA draft picks, managed to use the younger Gasol to trade for his much more established (at the time) older brother. Given they had the best player on Earth in Bryant, getting a 1b in the older Gasol was colossal, and Pop knew it. It was more or less the spawning of the canterkous sideline interview Pop we’d come to love over the following decade. It’s a complete fool’s errand to knock the Spurs for allowing this to happen after they’d just basically put on a clinic of how to steal foreign assets. That would be incredibly misguided criticism. However, the consequences were simply undeniable: The Lakers were clearly better than the Spurs and would go on to three straight NBA Finals between 2008 and 2010, winning back-to-back titles in the latter two years. Meanwhile, the Spurs seemed to be heading the other way as the decade turned.\n\nWhile this would start a title “drought” in San Antonio, the league was once again shifting. The Bargiani draft had executives reassessing European/foreign players after a period of overvaluing. Perhaps the Spurs had been fortunate to have picks toward the end of the draft, where undervalued players can fall in your lap. Or was it that other teams were just too eager to find the next hidden gem? When you consider what happened between 2003 and 2006, it suggests the latter was certainly true. Generally speaking, picking foreigners was a crap shoot. There was also a pretty clear consensus, at least from American players, that Europeans were sort of soft. In fact, the whispers had long been there in that regard. They were more known for smarts than toughness. However, yet again, the Spurs had turned to another market and were ahead of the curve in South America. While they’d stolen Ginobli in 1999, it wasn’t really until the middle of the next decade that the South American market’s value became apparent.\n\nWas it to anyone’s surprise that Argentina’s Gold Medal team in the 2004 Olympics had five future NBA players, three of whom were or eventually would be drafted/signed as a rookie by the Spurs? Ginobli and Scola had led that team. Another member of that team, Fabricio Oberto, would make his way to the Spurs after and help them win their fourth title in 2007. Yes, it’s reasonable to assume he was on the Spurs to appease Ginobli. If you dig deeper, though, he was just another in a long line of guys who the Spurs knew would fit in. In a 2009 article on NBA.com entitled “Fabricio Oberto ‘The Ultimate Teammate,’” his former teammate and now NBA TV analyst Brendan Haywood made it clear why Oberto was valued. “Fab is the ultimate teammate,” Haywood said. “He's the guy that every winning team needs. He plays hard, practices hard, doesn't care about his stats, doesn't care about self, is always in the right place. To be successful, every team needs an Oberto, and we're just glad we have one.” The willingness to do the dirty work, including set screens, take charges, and dive for loose balls, was evident across the board with Argentine players. They were TOUGH.\n\nOberto’s presence as a teammate, though, was a microcosm of what the Spurs were all about. It seemed to be their secret sauce. In a speech for the FIBA World Association of Basketball Coaches, Pop shed some light on the Spurs’ motivation in building their teams throughout the years. “There was a time when America was way ahead of the game and everyone else was learning the game in other parts of the world … and we sort of lost our way, as far as the fundamentals, and the skills and the work ethic.” People can poo poo this as old school stuffiness, stubbornness, or whatever. Just know that this is one of the game’s best coaches ever. And he’s 100% correct here.\n\nLeonard steps to the line for two free throws with 19 seconds left. Spurs 94 Heat 92. He misses the first attempt.\n\nTHE 2009 NBA DRAFT: AN UNLIKELY RELOADING POINT\n\nThe decade had brought a clear level of insanity to the draft. How else could you explain how the league was basically devoid of Europeans (definitely South Americans) in the 1990s, but would have top picks from China, Australia and Italy by the mid-2000s? As the league caught up to South America, the Spurs again found a hidden market. This time, it was Australia. A teammate of Kukoc on those completely impossible-to-ignore Bulls title teams in the 1990s, Luc Longley had been the first Australian to play in the NBA. Drafted in 1991, he joined the Bulls after their first three-peat. Yes, the Dream Team really opened the world’s eyes to the great game of basketball. It’s just indisputable; however, I firmly believe that having guys like Kukoc and Longley on such a well-known team was huge for the game as well. According to Sports Media Watch (SMW), THOSE Bulls were the complete opposite of the Spurs: an utter box office bonanza. Want proof? Consider this, according to SMW: “As will surprise no one, NBA Finals ratings peaked during the Chicago Bulls era of the 1990s. Game 6 of the 1998 Bulls-Jazz series ranks as the highest rated and most-watched NBA game ever, with a 22.3 (rating) and 35.6 million (viewers). The 1998 series is also the highest rated NBA Finals on average, with an 18.7 and 29.0 million over six games.” It was both proof of Jordan’s star power and how it manifested in the ratings.\n\nNevertheless, the 2000s remained quiet for players from down under. Then, in 2005, Andrew Bogut was picked first overall. Like Longley, Bogut played college ball in America. Times had totally changed, though. From Kwame Brown being chosen first as a high school player in 2001, to Ming being picked first in 2002, to James and Milicic going one/two as a high schooler and Euro, respectively, in 2003, to another high school player (Dwight Howard) going first in 2004 and, finally, an Australian taken first in 2005, the draft basically had been tipped upside down. Whereas Euros had mercifully been forced to own the soft label, Australians had the exact opposite reputation, and Bogut was a great example as a physical player. While Longley had been the first, Bogut’s entry started a trend of Aussie players coming to the NBA. According to ESPN, by the 2017-18 season, Australia ranked fourth behind the U.S., Canada and France for most players in the league.\n\nDespite the high-profile Bogut pick, the following three drafts were quiet for Australians. Bogut was very good, but never great (partly due to a gruesome arm injury), and he played in one of the league’s smallest markets in Milwaukee. Aside from Hasheem Thabeet going second and Steph Curry falling to six, the 2009 NBA Draft was more or less ho hum. For the Spurs, three second round draftees and, eventually, an undrafted free agent showed how they were ahead of the curve. AGAIN. Like most Spurs’ foreigners, Patty Mills came to them with a relatively decorated resume. At just 17 years old (shout out to Wikipedia here), Mills was named the 2006 South East Australian Basketball League’s Under 21 Australian Youth Player of the Year. An undoubtedly impressive achievement for a 17-year old playing with 20-year olds.\n\nAfter his 2006 season in Australia really put him on the map, he was recruited by an up and coming coach on the West Coast named Randy Bennett. At tiny Saint Mary’s College of California, Bennett had taken over in 2001 and immediately developed a recruiting pipeline to Australia. After one NCAA tournament berth in six seasons, and following a 17-15 record in 2007, Mills stepped in the next year, joining fellow countrymen Lucas Walker and Carlin Hughes. Having already been routinely tested against bigger, older and stronger players in Australia, Mills had no trouble adapting. He scored 37 against then 12th ranked Oregon in just his fourth college game. As a freshman, he earned All-Conference honors and led the Gaels to their first top 25 ranking in nearly 20 years.\n\nFor college basketball fans, Mills quickly became a name to remember. I was no different. It was probably 2008, and I got a text from my most trusted basketball confidant, an associate head coach at one of Boston’s local high schools. He told me to check out this Mills kid from St. Mary’s. I did. Fuck! Where did THIS guy come from? He was a jitterbug in the Parker mold. The difference was that Mills was more scorer than facilitator. And the three-point shooting was absolutely no contest, in favor of Mills. Even though he had two seasons of college eligibility remaining, he left the Gaels to enter the 2009 NBA draft.\n\nMills represented a trifecta of sorts for the wise Spurs: he was a foreigner, a consistent winner at a small school in college and an afterthought who was picked 55th in the 2009 draft by Portland. As we sit here today in 2020, here’s proof of the value Mills has proven to be: He’s one of about a dozen players from that draft still playing today. Spur teammate Danny Green, also from that draft, can say the same thing. Although neither was drafted by the Spurs, it speaks to the organization’s savvy as a small market team trying to tangle with the Los Angeleses and New Yorks of the league. Over and over, they seemed to be ahead of the market. Starting Pop’s “program” by surrounding the roster with responsible, thoughtful future NBA coaches, like Porter, Del Negro and Kerr. Swallowing hard and taking Parker as a basically unprecedented European investment, at his diminutive height. Cornering the Argentine market before anyone knew it fucking existed. Ditto the Australian market.\n\nHere’s a theme you saw from many of the Spurs players during the NBA’s 2011 161-day Lockout: They did whatever they could to continue playing competitive games, a sign of their love for and commitment to the game. In a team sport, such as basketball, THAT commonality is important. When you have a team littered with players from different cultures? A shared love of the game practically becomes paramount. It would come as no surprise then that, like his future teammate Boris Diaw, Mills found a way to keep playing high-level basketball during the Lockout. After two years in Portland, the Blazers essentially decided to roster former lottery pick Johnny Flynn (who was picked 49 spots higher than Mills) over him. It would prove to be a mistake. Regardless, like South Americans, Australian players such as Bogut, Mills and Matthew Dellavedova, also out of Saint Mary’s, were starting to put the country on the NBA map.\n\nWhile 2013 and 2014 teammate and fellow countryman Aron Baynes wasn’t drafted out of Washington State University in 2009, he was similar to Mills in that he went to college as an Australian. After playing four years at Washington State, he played for the Lakers summer league team in 2009 and then in Europe for more than three seasons before joining the Spurs in January 2013. A man of brute strength who’s incredibly hard to move and possesses the typical Australian toughness, Baynes actually started a 2013 playoff game for the Spurs; however, overall he played sparingly. (It’s worth nothing here that Baynes is not only still in the league today, he’s routinely regarded as one of, if not the, strongest men in the NBA.) His 2013 teammate and fellow 2009 draft classmate DeJuan Blair (pick 37) had fallen to the Spurs after knee concerns scared teams off. Blair was not on the 2014 team, but the fourth 2009 graduate, Green, was on both teams.\n\nGreen was a decorated college player at the University of North Carolina. He was a four-year college player, a normal deal for the Spurs. Even better, he played in college basketball’s best conference, the Atlantic Coast Conference, winning the NCAA Men’s National Championship in 2009. He played his rookie year in 2010 in Cleveland, which waived him after the season. Enter the Spurs. Whether it mattered here or not is anyone’s guess, but the Spurs had longstanding ties to the University of North Carolina through ex-coach Larry Brown. It had been Brown, a UNC alum, who’d given Pop a chance as a volunteer assistant at the University of Kansas in the mid-1980s. When Brown took the reigns as Head Coach in San Antonio two years later, Pop joined soon after. After he and Brown were let go in 1992, Pop returned in 1994. One of his first moves was to sign point guard and future Head Coach Avery Johnson. Pop’s been in south Texas ever since.\n\nIn recent years, it had been big name veterans to round out the big three in San Antonio. Yes, foreign players were always mixed in, the Spurs routinely being rewarded for taking fliers on such draftees. They’d clearly altered their philosophy, though, to both younger AND undervalued foreign players. The big-three-plus-vets approach had helped get the Spurs this far, of course, helped in large part by the 1997 lottery luck with Duncan. They’d slightly altered the blueprint. Could it get them past OKC and Miami, though? Given how young and talented OKC was while the Spurs were appearing to head in the opposite direction, many prognosticators had doubts. Most of them, actually.\n\nTHE WRONG KIND OF UNFORGETTABLE SEASON\n\nLike the 2012 series vs. OKC, things changed quickly for the Spurs’ fortunes. This time, they enjoyed some indirect luck. Before the 2013 season, OKC traded Harden due to luxury tax concerns. Although he’d yet to prove to be the historic scorer he’d REALLY become, he was a force for the Thunder who’d just turned 23. It was considered basically fact that OKC had taken a step back with the trade, an attempt to reload and get something for a budding star before he walked in free agency the following summer. The Spurs were going on their sixth season since winning a title. But the door had suddenly cracked open. The Western Conference was suddenly very winnable.\n\nBy this time, the Spurs were even better. Although there were no notable additions, two things were standing out. One was the increased play of Splitter, the Brazilian the Spurs had drafted and stashed back in 2007. At 6’ 11”, he was superior in size and defensive ability to Dejuan Blair. The other, bigger reason was the emergence of Leonard. He played seven more minutes per night than he had in his rookie 2011-12 season, and he was providing the type of athlete on the wing who they’d basically never had. They DEFINITELY had not anyone of his defensive prowess since Bruce Bowen, but even Bowen was never the type of athlete Leonard is. Yes, the Spurs had been incredible the year before. But they could be even better with more size and athleticism. Leonard was an excellent rebounder for his position as well. Even without Harden, the Spurs were forced to get bigger and more athletic to keep up.\n\nBy this time, all the foreign players drafted by the Spurs the previous decade, along with Duncan in the late 1990s, added up to the most diverse roster in the history of the league. The 2013 team had 9 imports on its 15-man roster. To hammer home how unlikely a number that is in the NBA, consider that having three or four foreign players on one roster was considered a lot, even as the game had exploded globally over the previous two decades. The Dream Team in 1992 had showcased the game to the world in such epic fashion. To non-native Americans, watching these players do the things that they did, at their size, was groundbreaking. How can David Robinson be seven feet tall, but run the floor like a damned gazelle? How can Magic, at that height AND age, SEE everything like that? Handle the ball? How can Charles Barkley be that ferocious? How could Jordan be that graceful?\n\nDuncan, Ginobli and Parker were all well-known imports. But the likes of Mills and Baynes (Australia), Splitter (Brazil), Boris Diaw and Nando De Colo (France), and Corey Joseph (Canada) were all role players. You see all of this diversity. Did it happen out of luck, the Spurs just taking what they’re given year after year in the form of unheralded foreign players? Or was it more than that, the Spurs SEEKING these players out for one reason or another? At the time, it was hard to tell.\n\nThe 2013 team would start the year with a blistering 44-12 record. Whether it was because they were fairly locked in as the West’s 2 seed or Pop taking his foot off the gas pedal, they finished the year just 14-12. Another possible reason for the season’s end was the unhappiness of veteran Stephen Jackson. In his second stint with the Spurs, he’d grown unhappy about playing behind Ginobli (now 35) and Green. He was getting about five minutes per game less than he had the previous season under Pop. Of course, the emerging Leonard was also a reason for that de facto demotion. Nevertheless, Jackson was cut a week before the 2013 playoffs began, a rather unprecedented occurrence in the Pop/Duncan era.\n\nJackson’s role in San Antonio had always been quite complicated. While he helped the Spurs win their second title in 2003, he’s also made it known that he’s not a Tony Parker fan. In 2010, reports from major media outlets, including both New York papers, had the then married Parker in some kind of relationship with teammate Brent Barry’s wife. While the parties vehemently denied it, reports of a “sexting relationship” were rampant. Jackson was at a different stage of his career with younger players breathing down his neck. It’s not any type of coincidence that Jackson was essentially the lone Spur to be unceremoniously cut before the playoffs during their run, as well as the only former Spur player to reference Parker’s alleged infidelity in a public setting (on his and former NBA player Matt Barnes’s “All the Smoke” podcast last year). It was a tough situation for the Spurs, but their silence and refusal to speak publicly about it was another clear demonstration of the family atmosphere that Pop had cultivated.\n\nHaving cleared Jackson from their roster, the Spurs were hungry after the previous season’s flameout. The road to the Finals in 2013 would include battles vs. the past and present. First, it was the hobbled Lakers, that constant thorn in the Spurs’ side. In a somewhat disappointing end to the Kobe/Duncan rivalry given Bryant had just torn his achilles, they swept LA, winning each game by double digits. In what proved to be a sign of things to come, they had a difficult time with the Warriors in the second round. It started immediately, at home, in a game for the ages. The young Warriors came to San Antonio and jumped the veteran Spurs in Game 1. In what has to be one of their best achievements of the entire dynasty given what Golden State would eventually become, the Spurs pulled off the impossible.\n\nWhen Tony Parker was fouled and strolled to the free throw line with 3:57 remaining, the Spurs were down 104-88. In the NBA, that means game over 99.9% of the time PLUS. Parker made both, then drove in for a layup on each of the next to possessions. Spurs down 10, 3:05 left. After Leonard stole a pass from Jarrett Jack, Parker assisted him on a layup. Spurs down eight. Helped by ex-Spur Richard Jefferson missing two free throws, the game was scoreless for an entire game minute until Leonard buried a 3. Spurs down 5, 1:40 remaining. After Diaw blocked future two-time league MVP Steph Curry’s shot, Parker grabbed the rebound and came down for another layup. Spurs down 3, timeout Warriors, 1:17 remaining. After a loose ball foul, Diaw makes both free throws. One point game. After Jack finally broke the Warriors’ drought, Green nailed the game-tying three with 20 seconds left to send it to overtime. In a sign of their eventual championship toughness, undeterred, the visiting Dubs quickly went up five in OT. The Spurs battled back, yet again, and forced a second OT. This time, it was the Spurs going up five. The young Warriors weren’t folding, though, and they took the lead by two with 3.4 seconds left. Pop took a 20-second timeout.\n\nDuring the Spurs’ dynasty years, Duncan was a good bet to get the ball in some capacity in this situation. But this was Parker’s team now. The Warriors knew that, and they played him like it. They took the ball out in the frontcourt, mid right sideline with Leonard making the inbounds pass. Starting on the low weak side, the Spurs ran Parker around a double pick starting with Ginobli first setting a screen at the left elbow. Diaw, who was trailing, sees Ginobli’s screen pick off the now trailing Harrison Barnes (you can see Diaw looking right at this action on the video). Once he sees that, he’s smart enough to know that his own defender, Jack, has hesitated and made the ill-fated decision to now help deny Parker, who’s coming around the screens free as the clear preferred option beyond the three-point line at the top of the key. Once that happens, Golden State is in trouble. Diaw is key here. After reading Jack’s mistake, he immediately dives down the lane, forcing Golden State defender Kent Bazemore into a game-deciding decision: Try to deny Diaw a look three feet from the basket or run out to cover Ginobli, who had flared out to the three-point line on the left wing and was wide open.\n\nJack’s decision effectively forced this scenario upon poor Bazemore. This really WASN’T a choice, and certainly not Bazemore’s fault given Jack’s decision had now led to essentially a two on one for the Spurs. Give up a wide open look three feet from the basket or make the Spurs drain a three at the horn? Bazemore played it as well as he could, first hedging in front of Diaw. But, just as he did, Leonard knew he had Ginobli wide open on the wing. He hit him, and Ginobli made arguably the biggest shot of his career, a three pointer to steal Game 1. The one thing that REALLY stood out during this play was who was NOT involved: Duncan. It was another telling sign that the Spurs, although still as potent as ever, were in transition. This was a different era for them.\n\nMost will tell you that what happened here was vintage NBA, more formality than shocking: The veteran, weathered crew overcomes a vicious haymaker from an up and comer, who was simply unable to close the deal. There’s a lot of truth to that given two things: Veteran teams win most often in the NBA and young teams USUALLY have to overcome some form of heartbreak in the playoffs before they can REALLY succeed. It’s the classic, “take one step back to take two steps forward” scenario. Only, in the league, it’s not by choice. It’s just a rite of passage. The 1990s Bulls and 2000s Lakers would concur here, as each failed repeatedly in the years leading to their dynasties. Sometimes, you have to go through hell to get to heaven.\n\nSome, on the other hand, may tell you that this comeback is just another example of how, despite having four NBA Championships already in tow, THIS was the middle of the Spurs best run yet. The 20-game winning streak in the spring of 2012 had served notice that the Spurs were finally back after five years of uncharacteristic playoff flameouts. With each passing game in 2013, it started to feel like more of a foreshadow. The Harden trade had cracked the door open. And this team was better, as well as drama free after Jackson’s release. The Warriors, however, were giving them unexpected fits. Looking back, it was one dynasty schooling another eventual one.\n\nBosh enters for Miller. Diaw enters for Duncan. Leonard makes the second attempt. Spurs 95 Heat 92, 19 seconds left.\n\nIn Game 4, it was Golden State’s turn to come back, as the Spurs blew an eight-point lead with less than five minutes to play. They eventually lost in OT, their only loss on the road through the first three rounds of the 2013 playoffs (6-1 record), a practically unheard of feat, especially in the routinely more difficult Western Conference. The defense was carrying them. After their Game 2 loss to the Warriors to cede homecourt advantage (temporarily), they gave up 92 points in a blowout Game 3 win. After the Game 4 loss, they ended up ripping off seven straight wins, allowing less than 90 points (teams in the 2013 regular season averaged more than 98 points per game) in the final six. Four of those games were on the road, among three different venues. They held Memphis under 87 points in regulation in all four games, coming back from 18 down on the road to win in Game 3. The Spurs were playing like they had unfinished business, which was true given their history with Memphis. Unfortunately, incomplete jobs were something with which they would become far more familiar.\n\nBy the time the Conference Finals rolled around, Leonard’s stock was rising. Few professional basketball writers in this country are as plugged in as ESPN Senior Writer Zach Lowe, who wrote the following during that series when discussing the previously under-the-radar trade of George Hill for Leonard a couple springs earlier: “It’s hard to see where the Spurs are now, seeking a fifth title in the Duncan era, without the emergence of Leonard.” Demonstrating that even the most plugged in writers had little idea of what was eventually to come with Leonard, he later added that, in Hill, “The Pacers got the slightly less delicious slice (of the pie).” While Leonard was by no means a star at this point, his age 21 season, it was clear the Spurs had found someone special.\n\nFrom Spurs radio play-by-play man Bill Schoening’s blog, 20 Second Timeout, in November 2014: “We see it firsthand on an almost daily basis. Spurs' development coach Chad Forcier puts small forward Kawhi Leonard through some offensive drills. Ball handling, posting up, shooting off screens, corner 3's, etc. Through it all, Leonard is focused, almost steely-eyed. He is on the same page as Coach Forcier, following the instructions, step by step. Head Coach Greg Popovich told reporters this week, ‘He really is a Coach's dream. He does everything we ask of him.’” Fortunately for the Spurs, the teens were one of the league’s craziest decades in history given where the best players at decade’s end were drafted. James, of course, had been first and is still the best. After that, though? Giannis Antetokounmpo, largely considered James’s successor? He went 15th. Ditto Leonard. Steph Curry went seventh. A huge reason for Leonard falling was the uncertainty over his shot/ability to score. Undeterred, the Spurs grabbed him in large part due to their faith in Engelland. Defensively, Leonard was immediately great. His offense was starting to come along as well.\n\nThe Spurs had just swept Memphis to head to the NBA Finals for the first time in six springs. The Finals matchup vs. the Heat represented a collision of cultures. To put into context what the Heat were compared to the Spurs at this point, consider that post LeBron’s “Decision” in 2010, ESPN instantly developed the “Heat Index,” an everyday web page dedicated just to Miami Heat news. For the four-time champion Spurs? Nada. Sure, the league is driven by stars, and James was its biggest now. There was also the post “Decision” gathering at United Airlines Arena, during which the Heat’s newly minted big three of Wade, James and Chris Bosh chimed in about winning multiple rings in the coming seasons. Meanwhile, the Spurs HAD won four rings. Only it seemed like people were more excited about what this Heat team COULD BE compared to what the Spurs had already done. Actually, THAT was fact.\n\nThe matchup would be a clash of stars versus team, as well. Yes, the Spurs had Duncan. But he was no longer a superstar at age 37. Leonard was still a puppy, whereas James was peaking, Wade was already a two-time Champion and Bosh was a star in his own right. Small market vs. big market. Stars vs. a team. Small-town Texas vs. the glitz and glamour of South Beach. Not to mention two of the NBA’s three most iconic coaches of the past 30 years, only with Pat Riley assuming the role of Heat Lord at this point, not coach.\n\nWhen they met the Heat in the Finals, they pulled out Game 1 in bizarre fashion. It was a finish that would become increasingly telling over the next year. Tied at 88 with 17 seconds left, Parker used a screen to rid himself of James, with Mike Miller switching on to him. Coming back right off a Duncan screen, he then had Bosh switch on to him. He kept going but was walled off by James on the right block. He then spun out of it with James on him, somehow avoided Wade stealing the ball as Wade was chasing down Ginobli, fell to one knee, maintained his dribble, spun right with James ALL OVER HIM and banked one in from 17 feet. Spurs win Game 1 on the biggest shot of Parker’s career.\n\nIn relatively predictable NBA fashion, the Spurs lost Game 2 despite a subpar start from James, who missed 10 of his first 13 shots. But James brought his full arsenal, adding eight rebounds, seven assists and three blocks (including a highlight-level stuff of the far bigger Splitter) for a Heat rout. Back in Texas for the first of three in Game 3, the Spurs held a six-point halftime lead before exploding to a 63-33 second half advantage. They set an NBA Finals record by raining 16 threes on the Heat, including 7 from the scorching Green, during a 36-point demolishing of the defending champs. It wasn’t without a setback, though. As the Spurs were stretching their lead in the third quarter, Parker suffered a Grade 1 hamstring strain, the least severe of its type. He was forced to the locker room, only to come back and play one fourth quarter minute in the route.\n\nParker was starting to become more banged up than the Spurs could afford, especially given he’d just come off a left calf bruise suffered in the middle of the Golden State series. That injury had forced an MRI before Game 3 against Memphis. For the Spurs, a Parker injury was a scary proposition. He’d firmly become the team’s engine over the past two years, as Duncan and Ginboli reached their mid thirties and Leonard, while obviously talented, was still green and a relative unknown at the pro level. Of course, anyone who’d watched Game 1 could’ve told you how vital Parker was to this Spurs outfit. It was clear as day, especially against a Heat team without anyone who could match his speed. However, his comments about his injury were telling. “Coach Pop always prefers the rest, to avoid injury. If it was the regular season I would definitely have rest. I would not play,” Parker said, speaking about the calf strain against the Warriors. “And same thing here, it's an injury, and so we'll see. We'll see how I feel tomorrow. Talk with Pop.” It was ominous talk, but Parker ended up not missing any time in the series.\n\nAlthough the Spurs had dropped both regular season games to the Heat, they were not only comfortable against them, but very obviously unintimidated. The Heat had no answer for Parker, and the defensively dynamic Leonard was learning more and more each game in terms of what to do against James, his favorite spots and moves. Not only that, they were clearly bigger up front. The Spurs appeared a bit deeper as well. Champions aren’t easy to conquer, though, and this series was starting to resemble a heavyweight fight. Team punches, other team falls, gets back up and punches back. Again, relative to NBA history and routine for this series, and with Parker hobbled, the Heat bounced back with pride in Game 4 to even the series. Pop surprised everyone by starting Ginobli in Game 5, and he was rewarded with 24 points and 10 assists. Parker, who was giving the Heat fits with his quickness and ability to routinely get to his spots, went off for an additional 26 in the Spurs’ Game 5 win. They were one win away from title number five. They just had to win one of the final two games in Miami.\n\nJames misses a three-point attempt with seven seconds left, Spurs 95 Heat 92.\n\nWhat happened next was simply incredible theatre, unless you were on a certain side of the equation, that is. Back at American Airlines for Game 6, Duncan, knowing how close he was to another title, had one of those “Oh my God, he’s still fucking awesome” games. Like pretty much all superstars when the call comes, regardless of how much time they’ve spent in the league or their routinely long list of accomplishments, Duncan responded. He seemed noticeably driven in the first quarter, dominating the smaller Heat to the tune of 6 for 6 and 12 points. On the road, in the biggest of games, superstars are the ones who are supposed to lead. When you’re Duncan, a four-time champion and two-time league MVP, you don’t need to be told to show up big, you don’t need a pep talk and you don’t need the coach to tell you that YOU need to lead. It’s innate, the same type of savvy his old college coach, Dave Odom, witnessed IMMEDIATELY upon meeting Duncan.\n\nAs Feinstein’s story goes, Odom’s first encounter with Duncan spoke volumes in two ways: One was his maturity/savvy. The other was confidence. Not the chest thumping, look-at-me type. Quiet, assuring confidence. The kind you know is real. “When the word had gotten around that a big-shot American college coach was in town, everyone who had ever picked up a basketball on the island had shown up to play. Duncan was 16, which made him just about the youngest player on the court. (He told Odom) ‘If I make them let me play the first game, they’ll get upset and put me on a bad team,’ he said. ‘I’ll lose and I won’t get on the court for an hour. If I sit out the first game, though, I can pick my own team and once we get out there, we’ll be there for a while.’ Duncan stood up to get ready to play. ‘One more thing, Coach.’ ‘What’s that?’ Odom asked. ‘I can play this game.’” Odom was immediately a believer, and the rest is history. Duncan had the “quietest guy in the room but most potent” vibe, as is quite often the case.\n\nThat first sentence says so many things that we’d come to know (and, in my view, not appreciate enough) about Duncan. But imagine you’re a 16-year old playing with young adults and grown men. To even have the wherewithal, at ANY age, to KNOW you might be stepping on toes is impressive in its own right. To actually know the situation AND have the maturity to navigate it at that age is rare. “If I make them let me play” says so much by itself. First, the confidence is evident from the start. He knows that not only does he belong talentwise, but that, if he wants to, he can “make them let me play.” THAT’S powerful from a 16-year old. Then, there’s the respect he clearly has, that ever important thing that makes us all so much more likable: knowing your place and respecting the pecking order. It’s even more impressive given how skilled he must have been compared to his counterparts that day. It was the freaking Virgin Islands! We’re not talking Philly or Washington D.C. ballers here, ok? It’s comical that he wasn’t the guy everyone wanted to play with. That was Duncan, though. Zero self promotion.\n\nIt had all led to this point, so it was little surprise that he came out and had a dominant first quarter. He was a closer. It was closing time. There was just one thing: It was now 2013 and he’d just turned 37 years old and completed his 16th NBA season. His longevity of dominance at this point, in terms of big men in league history, was only eclipsed by the great Abdul-Jabbar. NOBODY else in the history of the league had done what Duncan, at this point in his career and at his size, was doing. Which was dominating the Heat. Like a great leader does, he got the Spurs started fast in a hostile road environment in Game 6. It was CLASSIC Duncan: No rah rah, no chest thumping. Just that no-nonsense look we’d become accustomed to seeing from him in big games. Locked in? He looked more POSSESSED in that first half. His trademark stoicism matched his first half dominance, a rarity in the “hey, look at me!” era. As things would turn out, it would be ironic.\n\nTrailing by five late in the second quarter, Duncan went on a personal 7-0 run to give the Spurs a lead they’d enjoy for almost the rest of the evening. He had 25 at the half, starting eight for eight. The Spurs led by 10 points heading into the final quarter, a nice cushion. Mario Chalmers had other ideas for the Heat, providing an unsung hero performance that totally dwarfed that of Bosh and Wade, two superstars having off nights in the biggest game of the season. His 20 pts would easily beat both of his higher-acclaimed teammates, and he started the fourth off by nailing a three to cut the lead to seven. Miami would chip away until taking the lead midway through the fourth quarter. The Heat led 87-84 after a James layup with 4:45 left. The game would be scoreless for the next 2:15. Then, the most incredible final two and a half minutes in Finals history happened.\n\nThey were surviving despite a subpar performance from Parker, but a Ginobli layup, helped by Duncan practically pinning Bosh in the paint, cut it to one. Wade hit two free throws to push the lead back to three. After a huge offensive rebound by Green, Parker had the ball at the top of the key with James smothering him and the 24-second shot clock winding down. He launched a fadeaway three at the top of the key over James outstretched hand as the clock expired. Tie game. Twenty seconds later, he shrewdly rotated under the basket to intercept a Chalmers pass, eventually coming down the other end and hitting an awkward leaner to put the Spurs up two with 58 seconds left. Heading back to the bench, the normally reserved Parker was woofing at his teammates as they embraced him. You can clearly see him scream, “LET’S GO!!!” as he made his way back to the bench after the Heat called timeout. The Spurs were back in control, up two. Of course, the greatest player alive would have plenty to say. What happened next would both defy logic and change the course (and narrative, per James) of NBA history.\n\nWhile he’d removed the monkey from his back by winning his first title in the Lockout 2012 season, James had had a lengthy history of LOOOOOOUD playoff exits. There was 2009, with an Eastern Conference ripe to be taken after Garnett’s injury left the defending NBA Champion Celtics mortal. They lost to Dwight Howard and Orlando. As heavy favorites to get through the East again in 2010, they had the Celtics tied at two in the conference semifinals. James then proceeded to make 3 of 14 shots, AT HOME, as he watched his team take a helpless second half beating, 70-44. His monster followup triple double (27 pts, 19 rebounds and 10 assists), the final game of his first Cleveland stint, was odd given how disengaged he’d looked in Game 5. His “Decision” eight weeks later was treated as sacrilegious outside of South Florida. It’s always been complicated here.\n\nWith the Heat up 2-1 on Dallas in the 2011 Finals, James delivered another head scratcher, a 3-11, 8-point, 4-turnover performance. Although he had 21 points in the deciding Game 6, the Heat lost to the Mavericks at home as overwhelming series favorites. James had six turnovers and went one for four from the free throw line. The history was simply impossible to ignore for the world’s best player. Now, it was 2013, and his first full season NBA title was in peril. Out of the Heat timeout with 58 seconds remaining, he turned the ball over despite having the far smaller Parker on him a couple feet from the basket. After Ginobli’s free throws extended the lead to four, he turned it over AGAIN. Now, the Heat were sitting ducks, just like against Dallas: with James struggling and American Airlines Arena staffers roping off the floor (this is true and has been documented) in anticipation of the visiting team’s championship celebration.\n\nAs Ginobli was fouled again, exasperated ESPN play-by-play man Mike Breen yelled, “an absolutely stunning turnaround in the final minute and a half!” As Ginboli missed the first free throw, you could see hoards of fans both behind the bench and then heading up the isles behind Ginobli. There’s a shot of Riley standing with his arms folded, everyone else around him sitting, and fans by the dozen passing by him through the exit below. After making the second to put the Spurs up five, 20-second timeout Miami. You could pretty much see the collective disbelief in the Miami huddle. Nobody said a word, it’s clear as day on the tape.\n\nOn the other side, Diaw came in for Duncan. Meanwhile, Mike Miller subbed in for Bosh, an indication that Heat Head Coach Erik Spoelstra was thinking three. James got the ball off the inbound pass and rushed up a three that almost broke the backboard. Luckily, it was SUCH a brick that it carammed right to Leonard, who had Wade right behind him. With literally a millisecond to react to James’s brick, Leonard got his hand up a half second late. Wade, in what HAS to be considered one of the biggest plays of his life, then quickly gets an arm on the ball, batting it up. He then leaps a second time, right as Ginobli was doing likewise. Despite three Spurs (Diaw, Leonard and Ginobli) circling the ball as it descended in the middle of the three-second area/paint, Wade beats them all too it, as Diaw and Leonard mistimed their jumps (you can see it clearly on the replay). In a miracle of its own, Miller grabbed the loose ball that had just been deflected as many as four different times. James was not only wide open, but stepping into a three. He wasn’t missing again: two-point game, 20 seconds left. Uh oh.\n\nBosh rebounds the James’ miss with about five seconds left … and immediately looks to the right corner.\n\nLeonard was fouled quickly. Like Ginobli’s most recent trip to the free throw line, though, he missed one of two. When James missed a three with seven seconds left, it felt like it was over even when Bosh grabbed the rebound (after Diaw had come back in for Duncan). He quickly saw Ray Allen in the corner for three. Parker, knowing he couldn’t sell out given how savvy Allen was as shot faking and sidestepping defenders and the clock STILL having six seconds on it, made a beeline for Allen in what has to be considered a relatively textbook close out (running out hard at the shooter, with a hand up to contest the shooter’s strong hand. But not doing so recklessly and out of control). Didn’t matter. Allen would make arguably the greatest shot in league history given the stakes. Tie game.\n\nTo make it even worse, the refs stopped the game to check and make sure it was a three. Pop was irate, as the Spurs had no timeouts and the Heat were celebrating. Bad beat given they seemed destined to at least get a shot up. (Imagine another buzzer beater to win the Finals!) No dice, overtime. In overtime, the game seesawed. ESPN color analyst Jeff Van Gundy could sense the magnitude while noting that the Spurs were no ordinary outfit: “I would be worried about a team’s response after being that close to a championship and not finishing it off, but the Spurs are a tough, strong-minded team.”\n\nWith eight seconds left in OT, the Spurs were down one and hadn’t scored in more than two and a half minutes. After a Leonard rebound, the Spurs didn’t call timeout. Ginobli pushed the ball, appearing to go by Allen and into the paint when he got stripped. Pop slammed down his clipboard in disgust as the no call unfolded. Ginobli swung his arm in disgust, same as Pop. Parker was on the bench. “To me, that’s a foul,” Van Gundy said. “Absolutely,” agreed Breen. The Heat, with unprecedented new life, went on to win. It was a historically cruel blow to the Spurs, up there with the biggest in the history of team sports. Certainly no NBA team had come so close to winning a title and not closed the deal. The Spurs had one more chance in Game 7, but less than 48 hours to regroup.\n\nAs for James, his 14-point fourth quarter had included easily one of the three biggest shots of his life in the final minute. A Business Insider article about an outfit called Betting Market Analytics after the Finals was aptly titled, “One Chart That Shows Why Game 6 May Have Been The Craziest NBA Finals Game Ever.” The article displays Betting Market Analytics’ graph showing the Heat’s win probability throughout Game 6. The article also includes the following: “With 28 seconds remaining, the Heat trailed by five and had only a 1.5% chance of winning the game. In other words, with 28 seconds left, the Spurs had a 98.5% chance of winning the championship.”\n\nA Game 7 in this situation with anything less than a battle-tested veteran team would’ve been a disaster, a loss before the game started. Historically, it seemed to be that way. A close, typically low-scoring battle for a Game 7 came down to the final two minutes. It was 90-88 when Chalmers left the door open for the Spurs by missing two free throws with 1:39 left. Just like in Game 6, the game’s key play ensued off a crazy rebound. Ginobli beat a trailing Bosh and Wade, who fell down. When he swung a crosscourt pass to Green, James almost picked it off. Only he doesn’t, leading to a 4-3 for the Spurs and a temporarily discombobulated Heat defense (Leonard was alone in the corner, the entire side of the floor not defended). After almost losing it, the ball ends up in the post to Duncan.\n\nKnowing he had a mismatch on Battier, he went middle to his strong right hand. Despite the much smaller Battier’s inability to contest, the Spur legend missed a relatively easy three-foot half hook. He got a hand on the tip, to no avail. Before he even got to the free throw line to run back on defense, the normally stoic Duncan could be seen lifting his jersey over his mouth (it was also seen in a closeup during the next pre-timeout montage from ESPN, in which Van Gundy again called it a “point blank miss”). Five seconds later, he crouched in his defensive stance and slammed the floor with his right hand. When Spoelstra called timeout, every player on both teams went back to their bench: except Duncan, who hunched over staring down with his hands on his knees. He knew a colossal opportunity had passed, and would later say the miss would haunt him. James then nailed an 18 footer with 28 seconds left. The Heat were going to repeat as NBA Champions. On the other side, the Spurs were an unenviable mix of emotions.\n\nDespite already having won four NBA titles during the previous decade and a half, THIS was going to be up there with ANY of them. Maybe it was going to be the sweetest! After all, their first NBA Championship is given an asterisk by many due to the very abbreviated 1999 season (50 games, as opposed to 82 due to the NBA Lockout that year). One could argue that they won in 2003 because the Lakers were just out of gas after three straight titles (and Shaq may have been banged up). The 2005 title could be called fortuitous given what happened at the end of Game 5 (not to mention the Malice at the Palace), when Rasheed Wallace inexplicably left big shot maker Robert Horry for a game-winning/series-altering three and win. And, of course, the 2007 Finals were a formality when James carried one of the worst teams in the history of the league to June basketball. Out of all five, this was going to be their most unassailable achievement.\n\n“It was so hard,” said then Spurs General Manager R.C. Buford, who I attempted to contact for this piece, according to ESPN Senior Writer Jackie MacMullan. “Especially hard to see Pop like that. I don't like talking about it.” Pop shockingly admitted he thought of quitting. According to MacMullan, he summoned his big three of Duncan, Ginobli and Parker early in the summer and asked them point blank pretty much, what’s next for us? “As the summer wore on, I got angrier and angrier,” Popovich said. “I wanted to pull the guys back together and appeal to them and challenge them. I wanted to ask them, 'When you are kicked in the gut, how will you respond?'”\n\nDespite ALL their success, the big three’s pain was clear as day. According to the New York Post’s Marc Berman, there was Ginobli basically admitting that the weight of Game 6 was one of gravity-defying magnitude. “In my head, I still had Game 6 in my head,’’ said Ginobili. “Being so close and feeling we were going to grab that trophy and seeing it vanish is very hard. We were five seconds away from raising that trophy. There’s such a fine line between celebrating all summer and now feeling like crap.” In his postgame press conference after Game 7, Duncan told the media the game will “haunt me.” According to Berman, it was Parker who gave the most accurate glimpse of what was to come. “Parker got angry when asked if this was the last of the Big 3. Ginobili will become a free agent and there’s been talk he could retire. ‘Can’t believe you’re asking that question,’ Parker said. ‘You’ve been saying we’re too old for five years.’’’ I mean, he had a point.\n\nWHEN YOU’RE KICKED IN THE GUT, HOW WILL YOU RESPOND?\n\nThere’s no right or wrong in these situations, in part because how do you know the answer to a question that’s never been asked? We’d never seen anything like the 2013 Finals. They were obviously hurting, but you can’t coddle them. Do you sympathize a little? Do you ease up and not be overly direct? How much looking back do you do before moving forward FOR GOOD? It was a unique spot in countless ways for San Antonio. Perhaps it was spawned from his Air Force background, but mincing words or holding back, well … not with Pop. Not after a loss like THAT.\n\nIn a speech the next year for the World Association of Basketball Coaches, Pop explained to the throng of up-and-coming coaches in attendance how he proceeded with his wounded group. “How do you get over that? How do you get them back? It’s all about honesty.” To back up that philosophy, Pop made the 2014 team watch every minute of the Game 6 and 7 losses from the year before. “What I didn’t want is them feeling sorry for themselves. I wanted them to feel the pain all over again, let them know that it was in our hands. WE blew it.” Pop calls it “total, brutal, between the eyes honesty.” Great, successful coaches live by it. “You have to be able to look at yourself and accept responsibility,” world-renowned presidential historian and Pulitzer-Prize winning author of Leadership: In Turbulent Times Doris Kearns Goodwin said in an April 2020 John Hancock webinar I was lucky enough to hear. Goodwin’s statement certainly applies here, in addition to countless life situations. Accountability is vital amid failure. Otherwise, growth won’t happen.\n\nAccording to MacMullan’s 2015 piece, Buford agreed it had to be done. “We needed to mourn that loss so we could move on.” How many times have you heard someone use the phrase “mourn that loss,” when NOT talking about someone dying? It was powerful semantics.That they’d fought so hard in that 2013 Game 7 after they’d literally come the closest anyone in league history had to NOT winning the title spoke volumes to Pop. \"You guys have got it,” Popovich told his team according to ESPN Senior Writer J.A. Adande in November 2014. “It's there. You've got the will, you've got the determination, you've got the fiber to do this again. And Game 7 proved it. It didn't happen for us, but is everything going to go your way in life? You think you're on the Earth and everything you want to happen to you is going to happen to you positively? The measure of who we are is how we react to something that doesn't go our way.”\n\nAnyone who has ever failed or, more specifically, failed while coming SO EXCRUCIATINGLY close to winning can relate to that last sentence. How we fail does NOT define us. How we bounce back DOES. It’s such a simple message, but its power resonates. The statement lingered. “How we react to something that doesn’t go our way … ” The best coaches ALWAYS maintain their big picture perspective. The best know that setting a goal of just “winning the whole thing” is a hollow one, it’s a result. The goal SHOULD BE constant improvement. That’s it. Because if you have both the motivation and fortitude to admit to yourself that you NEED to improve, plus the work ethic and commitment to actually DO IT, it’s all you really need. The improvement will come, and the results will follow. You hear the phrase all the time. But hard work remains underrated.\n\nFiguring out the big picture and reacting accordingly sometimes goes more under the radar. “What we didn't want to do is have them have the notion that the basketball gods got us,” Popovich said according to Adande. “'Ah, jeez, that one bounce here or we missed a free throw or we didn't get that offensive rebound. It's just the way it was supposed to be.' Well, no, it's got nothing to do with the basketball gods. You're in charge of yourself. There are always things you can do better. It's a game of mistakes. That's why people score, because you make mistakes. So let's figure out what we could have done, and that makes us a better team. We went through every single play of Game 6 and Game 7. We made them sit through it. We didn't yell and scream at 'em or berate 'em or anything. We were very businesslike. 'Here's where we didn't give help. Here's where we didn't rebound or put five men on the board.' So we understand it's on us. And now you can move forward. It's on us to see what we can do to get back into that same position. Can we or can't we? We may, we may not. I have no clue.” His last sentence said that, despite their four-time Champion status, the gravity of their loss was so profound that even this battle-tested crew might be unable to overcome it.\n\nPop would later say that the Spurs gravitated to players who were “over themselves.” Well, guess what? It’s a good thing they did, because NOBODY on Earth could get over a loss like they’d just suffered without getting over THEMSELVES first. It’s an impossibility. You don’t win four titles without it. For THIS group and all of its diversity, forming a strong locker room devoid of entitlement was paramount. As someone who grew up on an extremely non-diverse island, diversity was always something I was intrigued with. When I went to college and began taking an Intercultural Communication course, my eyes began to open regarding cultural differences. It might be a simple gesture done here, one you make without even thinking about, that could be taboo in another culture. How you look at people. How you speak to them, your tone, your eye contact. Your language, one word that could be totally offensive. I’d been completely ignorant to such differences growing up.\n\nAccording to Adande’s 2014 article, Pop said the following: “We spend a decent amount of time talking about what else you could be doing in your life, how fortunate we are basically just by the accident of birth,\" Popovich said. \"Think about it. It all starts with the accident of birth. Because you were born to these parents or this area geographically, or this situation, you deserve more than somebody else? Put that notion away. That's the most false notion one can imagine. But I think a lot of people forget that. They think that they're entitled to what they have. They don't understand the opportunity that they have compared to somebody else. And they don't understand the other person's lack of opportunity, why he or she is in a certain situation they're in. So we talk about those things all the time. You have no excuse not to work your best. You have no reason not to be thankful every day that you have the opportunity to come back from a defeat, because some people never even have the opportunity. So it's the measure of what you're worth, what you're made of.”\n\nOften, far too many of us equate toughness as a tangible deal. A fist thrown, a push, a stare, or whatever. Is such a person “tougher” than the person who has unwavering faith, a feat likely made more admirable by how that person used that faith to persevere through something truly difficult? Toughness is truly mental. Former NBA player and Head Coach Doug Collins said something while coaching Philadelphia on this end that I’ll never forget: “Faith brings hope, and hope brings life.” It all starts with faith, a complete belief in who you are, what you’re made of, where your team is going and how it should get there. In a team setting, such faith is the bedrock for not only succeeding, but attempting to do so after COMING SO CLOSE.\n\nOutside of sports, in how many types of industries is 50% considered a high success rate? Let’s agree there’s not very many. In the NBA, a 50% shooting percentage (i.e., making half the shots you take) is considered excellent. That means you’re EXPECTED to miss half your attempts, which still would be considered excellent. This dynamic alone separates NBA players from almost every other industry. If you can’t live EVERY SINGLE DAY with the fact that you have to fail half the time just to be considered good, you’re done. I don’t care how talented you are, how tall you are, how big your muscles are, how nice your smile is, or how genuinely great of a person you may be. It won’t happen for you. Ask anybody involved. Before you succeed, you have to know how to fail first. That mental toughness is omnipresent in the NBA. Add in the public nature of everything involved with the league, from routinely playing in front of sold out 20,000-seat arenas, to traveling ALL THE TIME, to maintaining the competitive drive needed to beat out literally thousands of others who won’t make it, and, of course, to having your failures on display TO THE WORLD, and it’s easy to see its uniqueness.\n\nFailure is painful no matter if you’re an individual or part of a team. EPIC, mind-numbing and soul-crushing failure? It’s rare. Regardless, crushing defeat brings a level of introspection that’s hard to put into words. It’s an intensely focused, introvertive feeling that usually involves questioning WHY it happened. ‘What could I have done?’ Or ‘what didn’t I do?’ No matter what, though, losing and failing ALWAYS involves the following opportunity: When you’re kicked in the gut, how will you respond? Good leaders generally view such scenarios as opportunities for improvement. They also know that winners will eventually reveal themselves when faced with this type of issue.\n\nHow do you respond to something like this, where you’re RIGHT THERE and just don’t finish the job? How can normal everyday non-athletes relate to this dilemma? How can you NOT let it consume you? How on Earth do you balance that hellbent desire for redemption with that last question? How do you take accountability without just breaking your own spirit? These questions all lingered over their heads, no different than the confetti in American Airlines Arena had after that fateful Game 7. Like that confetti, too, they kept raining down on each member of that Spurs team all summer, from Pop and his whole staff to Duncan and through the 15th man on the bench. Ahhhhhh, yes, pain. It was somewhat reminiscent of a past, similarly painful outcome for the Spurs.\n\nIf you look under the Spurs’ proverbial hood, you can see why they were able to extend their run longer than any other outfit in modern NBA history. For elite teams, failure becomes part of the deal by default. You’re SO good year after year, you find yourself in high-stakes situations all the time. Inevitably, it leads to crushing defeats, an irony in sports. It’s the nature of the game, but a good problem to have. It sure as hell beats losing all the time. For Ginobli, losing is an utterly unacceptable outcome. Maybe it wasn’t by accident that he and his probably not famous enough (ah, yes, a sort of Spur side effect of being ignored) competitive drive arrived after a three-year title drought to help the Spurs win three titles in five years. Maybe.\n\nPeople who trace the Spurs dynasty back to the ping-pong ball luck that netted them Duncan in 1997 aren’t wrong. It would be silly to dismiss such an enormous presence’s influence over a franchise that was as successful as San Antonio was during his career. However, I disagree that he allowed for THIS dynasty. Yes, he would have won titles. But had the Spurs not chosen Ginobli at 57 while the entire NBA was in a slumber in 1999, their title count would be lower. Likely because they had a late pick and had just won the title, the Spurs felt like they were in a position to gamble. They saw what the Bulls did with Kukoc, who’d ended up being an effective player on the game’s most iconic dynasty of the past 50 years. The Spurs did the same with Ginobli. In 2006, the Spurs were coming off two titles in three years. It could have EASILY been better, too, as it took one of the greatest shots in NBA history by Fisher to help defeat them in 2004. For Ginobli, he knew basically nothing but winning by 2006. Yet, his example is so crucial here.\n\nWhen the Spurs lost one of the game’s great playoff series to in-state rival Dallas in 2006, it was a loss Ginobli reportedly took shockingly hard after he fouled Nowitzki for a three-point play with the Spurs up three with 21 seconds left in Game 7. According to Josh Coyne of ClutchPoints, “the Argentine took sole responsibility for the series loss and blamed himself to anyone he would talk to.” He added the following, which is both a testament to Ginobli’s selflessness and the Spurs’ team culture: “He felt as though he had cost members of the team that hadn’t won a ring at that point the opportunity to become champions.” Accountability and empathy in their most powerful form. It’s great to be competitive, although it’s practically a prerequisite for professional athletes. Players who can perform like stars ON the court and have THIS kind of empathy are rare. There’s almost an inherent attitude of “you’re not getting in my way under any circumstances” vibe to a professional athlete, it’s dog eat dog, especially one with Ginobli’s competitive drive. There’s a reason they get this far, and it often involves this uber-intense self-focus. One that doesn’t involve other people’s feelings. The Spurs were different.\n\nAccording to a 2016 profile on Ginobli by ESPN’s Lowe entitled “Welcome to Manu’s basketball familia,” the organization became concerned with how hard Ginobli was taking the 2006 loss. “Duncan was so worried, he contacted Malik Rose, a former Spur and close friend of Ginobili's, and asked Rose to call and check on him. ‘I don't say this lightly, but we all told each other: We have to stick with Manu,’ said Sean Marks, the Brooklyn Nets General Manager and a Spurs reserve that season. ‘We had to talk him off the ledge. We had everyone calling, texting, trying to hang out with him.’ He moped all summer. ‘I don't think I've ever seen a person so hard on himself,’ former General Manager and now Spurs CEO R.C. Buford said. ‘He is maybe the greatest competitor that we have ever witnessed here.’\" Having that level of BOTH empathy and competitiveness is a rare combination. It’s those types of characteristics that kept the Spurs going for so long.\n\nThe more you read about Pop, Duncan, Parker and Ginobli, the more and more you can understand how four people who were so very different could not only overcome those differences but do so while creating the league’s longest-lasting modern (I use that word in reverence of the 1960s Boston Celtics that won eight straight titles from 1959-1966. But NO other franchise since can match the consistent league dominance of these Spurs. NONE.). For as much as his hell-on-wheels style practically drove Pop batshit in his early days, not to mention it’s clear uniqueness compared to EVERYONE else, spiritually, Ginobli was the perfect Spur.\n\nLowe’s 2016 profile includes a story of what Ginobli said to his fellow countrymen after losing the Bronze Medal game to Russia in the 2012 Olympics: “I would rather lose with you guys than win with any other group of players.” It was touching for sure; however, for someone who his own GM called maybe the most competitive player the franchise has had over multiple decades, just THINK about that statement and what it says about Ginobli the man. For someone as competitive as he is to say the words “I would rather lose …” is remarkably powerful. Again, it speaks to his empathy. When you read stories like this, it’s much easier to see how the Spurs routinely integrated different cultures into their locker room. And succeeded while doing it. It helps to have a leader, in Duncan, who Kerr recently lauded on Chris Long’s Green Light podcast for allowing everyone on the team to feel comfortable.\n\nThat 2006 loss was the only one comparable to the 2013 loss to Miami. In her June 2015 gem, MacMullan quotes various Spurs about the devastation of 2013. Before we go into that, let’s remember one very key fact about pretty much ALL of the people we’ll hear from: They had already been so historically successful together as the indisputable most decorated NBA group since Jordan’s Bulls in the 1990s. These are people with more memories of success and achievement than most. That’s just reality. And, still … you don’t need to be a brain surgeon to read between the lines.\n\nDiscussing the back-breaking three from Allen in that unforgettable Game 6 in 2013, Pop simply said: “I've thought about that play every day, without exception, 4, 5, 6, 10 times a day,” Popovich said. “I always will.” Keep in mind, this is two full years after the defeat and Pop is saying this. Parker, with three championship rings in his possession already, albeit one less than Pop: “I've never seen our team so broken.” Ginobli, perhaps harkening back to how mightily he struggled in those Finals, including his nine-point, eight-turnover Game 6 in 2013, was probably speaking for the group: “That game killed me mentally.” Again, these are three- and four-time NBA champs we’re talking about. The old adage of “no matter how much you win, the hardest losses are the ones you remember the most” had never been so evident.\n\nThere was one part of Lowe’s 2016 Ginobli profile that provided a relatively clear glimpse of a different type of unity found with the Argentinians. According to Lowe, in 2012, the Argentina team did what they always did despite the crushing defeat to Russia: Go out for a group dinner. “It's a rule: win or lose, there is a team dinner,” said Pablo Prigioni, a point guard on the 2012 team. “To celebrate together, or cry together.” It was a powerful statement and one that illustrated a family vibe. For as much as AAU ball in America has influenced players to develop a camaraderie among their opponents, this type of TEAM unity was rare. These weren’t even guys who spent seven to nine straight months together. They were simply countrymen who came together for a few weeks and went back to their respective teams.\n\nPerhaps no one more than Ginobli set the tone for what was to come for the Spurs. He did two things to make his intentions quite clear. First, he had to sign a contract given he was really the Spurs’ only free agent. So, he took a 50% pay cut to sign a two-year deal that would guarantee him a shot at redemption. Second, he told his fellow countrymen whom he clearly adored that he wouldn’t be playing in the FIBA Americas Championship. The Spurs’ trio had demonstrated their pain and frustration in all ways throughout the summer. Duncan’s face, body language and the frequency with which he looked down when speaking after Game 7. Parker vocally reminding reporters that they’d long been calling his proud outfit “too old.” Ginobli letting his actions speak LOUD AND CLEAR. It’s almost as if they scripted it. Guess what? They didn’t. It was just another example of why EVERYTHING this franchise did seemed to fit. It wasn’t by accident."
