        "text": "LAS VEGAS -- Becky Hammon already made history when she became the first female head coach in NBA summer league.\n\nLeading the San Antonio Spurs to the Las Vegas Summer League championship just made the experience that much sweeter.\n\nHammon coached the Spurs to a 93-90 victory over the Phoenix Suns in the title game on Monday night.\n\n\"It was a grind,\" Hammon said. \"They've been together for 17 days. They really started to jell the last two or three games. They listened and they played really hard for me. I just really appreciate their attentiveness and alertness. They were tired but they fought through.\"\n\nThe Spurs participated in both the Orlando and Las Vegas summer leagues, but Hammon served as the head coach only in the higher profile Vegas event.\n\nThe Spurs lost the opener to the New York Knicks, and then reeled off six straight victories.
