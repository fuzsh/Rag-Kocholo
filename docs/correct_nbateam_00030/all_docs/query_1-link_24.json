        "text": "Ah, the allure of expiring deals.\n\nFrom getting his shot blocked in the NBA Finals by Tim Duncan to now helping the league's best power forward get there again.\n\nFrom asbestos-infested New Jersey to the dearth of Milwaukee to sweaty San Antonio.\n\nFrom run-on sentence after run-on sentence to a bold declaration.\n\nWith the acquisition of forward Richard Jefferson, the Spurs front office has guaranteed the team will at least sweat into the second round of the 2010 playoffs.\n\nThe financially stranded Milwaukee Bucks unloaded Jefferson for the expiring deals of Bruce Bowen, Fabricio Oberto and Kurt Thomas.\n\nInstinct says Milwaukee fans, if there are any left, will remember and curse Robert \"Tractor\" Traylor. If Dirk Nowitzki gives the Bucks faithful chills every time his Dallas Mavericks visit the Bradley Center, maybe Jefferson will do the same with the Spurs.\n\nThis transaction is also fitting, considering the banal Bucks are the only team with a winning record against the Spurs in the Duncan era. Milwaukee beat San Antonio in both meetings this season.\n\nThe incentive for general manager John Hammond to donate his team's most complete player—reports suggest Bowen and Oberto could be bought out—is at first difficult to pinpoint.\n\nThomas, Bowen and Oberto are bit role players—long in the teeth—who have more value in San Antonio than anywhere else.\n\nWith $15 million more in cap space this summer, Hammond can at least afford to re-sign restricted free agents Ramon Sessions and Charlie Villanueva.\n\nHe'll need to dip into a free agent pool loaded with great support players to make this more than a one-sided affair.\n\nJefferson didn't fit with Milwaukee in the same way Pau Gasol didn't fit in Memphis. That much makes sense for Scott Skiles' scrappy bunch.\n\nThe Bucks turned down offers for Jefferson from Portland and Cleveland at the trade deadline. Surely, as with the Gasol abomination, Hammond could have struck a better deal than this.\n\nFor the Spurs, Jefferson represents the biggest offseason acquisition since Stephen Jackson or Hedo Turkoglu.\n\nOne could argue that his 20 points per game make him the most complete prospect to land in San Antonio over the summer since Duncan.\n\nIt took Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili several years to become All-Star, Hall of Fame-caliber contributors.\n\nJefferson joins the organization in his prime, with his All-Star talent tapped but not tapped out.\n\nHe can dunk, something the Spurs famously don't do much, and score from any area of the floor with reliability.\n\nHis shooting might be streaky on a lottery team like Milwaukee, but it will be a boon alongside San Antonio's \"Big Three.\"\n\nAnother huge plus for the Spurs: he is capable of playing excellent defense, and despite minimal reports of egotism and arrogance, will put his teammates first.\n\nHis price tag offers the only bit of concern. Jefferson is due $29 million over the next two years.\n\nThis expensive acquisition could eliminate the Spurs as players in the heralded 2010 market, provided management extends Ginobili for a few more years.\n\nThe financial drawback is small, though, when Jefferson's abilities factor in to the equation.\n\nPlus, San Antonio fans should appreciate an owner in Peter Holt who's willing to spend money to be competitive. Holt agreed to fork up an addition $1.5 million to net Drew Gooden earlier this year.\n\nThe Spurs also pulled off a deal for an athletic wing without surrendering George Hill, Roger Mason Jr., Duncan, Parker or Ginobili—the five players with market value in terms of talent, not contract length.\n\nThat feat alone deserves serious kudos.\n\nHowever, before anyone starts planning a fifth parade down the Riverwalk or even a takedown of the Los Angeles Lakers, critical questions about the Spurs roster remain.\n\nCan Ginobili stay healthy for 82 games and 16 victories in the playoffs, or has he entered a perpetually injured state of his career?\n\nHow will the Spurs replace Thomas' toughness and tremendous post defense?\n\nCan these four All-Star talents stay healthy for a full season?\n\nWill Jefferson's mercurial talent mesh with three superstars who have won three championships together, or will it clash?"
