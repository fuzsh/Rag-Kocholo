        "text": "Richard Jefferson put together an incredible video skit for social media, bringing Tim Duncan to feature alongside him. The notoriously private Duncan rarely makes such lighthearted appearance and in this skit, lends Jefferson one of the five Larry O'Brien trophies he's won in his career for one day.\n\n\"Now, Tim, I know you don't do interviews, and you don't even really like me, but I'm just asking for one interview. And bring your trophy.\"\n\nNaturally, an excited Jefferson spends more time than anticipated with the trophy, taking it on walks, meals, and even drinking wine with it. Even after two days passed, Jefferson didn't give a worried Duncan the trophy back. RJ even interviews the trophy on his podcast as Duncan is left scratching his head about where his precious trophy could be.\n\nJefferson and Duncan were teammates on the Spurs from 2009 to 2011. While Jefferson never won a title alongside Duncan, he would become a champion in 2016 for his part on the legendary 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers' roster. Jefferson definitely knows how to take care of the Larry O'Brien trophy, but Duncan knows better than to trust the ESPN analyst with something like that.\n\nJefferson averaged 11.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.6 assists in three seasons alongside Duncan on the Spurs. They didn't win a title together, and Jefferson was moved on to Golden State Warriors. Nonetheless, it was great to see happily retired Duncan in a rare media appearance.\n\nTim Duncan Used To Coach In The NBA\n\nUp until a few years ago, we at least got to see Duncan regularly on TV as he was a part of the Spurs' coaching bench. Duncan effortlessly became an assistant coach after finishing his NBA career in 2016, continuing to work with Gregg Popovich on the San Antonio Spurs. He joined the Spurs as a coach in 2019 and stepped down after 16 months, electing to step away from basketball entirely.\n\nNot much is known about what Duncan does nowadays, but his occasional media appearances always lead to discussions around how he looks. The five-time champion was known for his buzz-cut and clean-shaven face, exemplifying the professional culture that San Antonio demands.\n\nWhile he was an assistant coach, Duncan started to grow out dreadlocks and a beard. With a few years away from the NBA and the public eye, he now has a full-grown beard that continues to catch fans off-guard.\n\nIt seems certain Duncan won't return to the coaching world. Many believed he was being earmarked as Popovich's successor whenever he chose to retire, alongside current Las Vegas Aces' coach Becky Hammon. Duncan even took on the role of interim head coach with Hammon as his assistant in the 2019-20 season, leading the Spurs to a 104-103 win over the Hornets in March 2020.\n\nTim was known to be a master of fundamentals, so he'd likely excel as a coach if he could communicate his knowledge to players. He might not be looking to be a part of the coaches' bench anymore, but he's working with Victor Wembanyama, undoubtedly guiding the new Spurs' cornerstone into fulfilling his potential."
