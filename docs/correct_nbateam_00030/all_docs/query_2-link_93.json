        "text": "Jonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nMatt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nJoseph Treutlein\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A talented slasher who is a solid second or third option. Possesses very good athleticism, boasting good explosiveness and quickness along with a strong frame and a great wingspan. Injuries have slowed him to an extent. A highly touted prep player, he enjoyed an impressive career at Arizona. Put up eerily similar numbers during each of his seasons under Lute Olsen. Blossomed during his second season in New Jersey and has been playing at a relatively high level ever since. Had a down year in 2006-07, but rebounded before being traded to Milwaukee for the 2008-09 season. Contributes in many different ways and is a smart and productive team player, but has struggled to be as consistent as he once was playing alongside Jason Kidd. Still one of those rare perimeter players who is a lights out shooter and gets to the free throw line at a good rate, without turning the ball over much. Defense and rebounding have fallen off noticeably during the past two seasons, following repeated ankle problems. A very good scorer, but not good enough to be a teams premier option. Will have to accept a much smaller role now that hes been traded to San Antonio. Has to become more efficient as a scorer in less touches while bring the same intensity on the defensive end. Clearly a Spurs guy when considering the intangibles he brings to the table. Will likely thrive playing a smaller role, similar to the one he had in New Jersey in 2005-2006.\n\nOffense: A nice offensive option who is more productive than efficient. Gets almost one-third of his shots up in spot up situations with isolations, shots off of screens, fast breaks, and pick and rolls accounting for the majority of his other touches. Possesses a solid jump shot with good range and a high release point, and has improved dramatically in recent seasons as a catch and shoot option despite only decent mechanics. Takes a lot of contested jumpers, but doesnt change his mechanics considerably when he does. Not a terribly consistent shooter off the dribble, despite his ability to create, has improved his midrange game a bit, and doesnt get tunnel vision to the rim like he used to. Has a good first step, showing good quickness and timing, which allows him to break his man down going in either direction. Doesnt get out in transition as often as he used to, but still finds quite a bit of success going one-on-one. Not the most advanced ball-handler, but uses craftiness and subtle misdirection steps to maneuver through the lane. Shows great ability to adjust in the lane and takes contact very well. Goes to the line at a terrific rate and shoots a good percentage. Has been a fantastic finisher historically, but hasnt been very effective around the basket recently, seeming to force a lot of tough shots and not finish his drives as efficiently. His drop off in shooting percentage at the rim accounts for many of his struggles, though his dramatic improvements as a shooter mask some of these issues. Moves well off the ball and makes good, quick cuts to the basket, where he catches and finishes well. Also uses his athleticism to get out and make plays in transition. A low-mistake player who makes good reads in the passing game and gets a decent amount of assists.\n\nDefense: Lateral quickness has fallen off noticeably following ankle troubles, which has impacted him defensively. Shows a good defensive stance, but doesnt always move his feet well when being attacked off the dribble. Sags off his man too much in one-on-one situations, leading to some easy shots. Overplays help defense at times, leading to open shots for opponents on the weak side. A good post defender who uses his body well while showing good fundamentals, even looking comfortable when matched against power forwards. Offers San Antonio some nice defensive versatility, but will need to work hard to fit into their defensive system. Change of scenery could be exactly what the doctor ordered on this end of the floor."
