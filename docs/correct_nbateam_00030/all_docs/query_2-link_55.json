        "text": "A 50-victory season has pretty much been the standard of excellence for National Basketball Association teams over the years.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs know a little something about that.\n\nThe Spurs last week hit the magic 50-victory plateau again, marking the 12th straight season the Spurs have won at least 50 games.\n\nThink about it, 12 straight seasons of 50 victories. Pretty impressive.\n\n\"It's obvious that it starts with having good players, quality players and management and ownership that have good continuity and everybody being on the same page,\" said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who has been on the San Antonio bench throughout the 50-victory streak. \"Over time, if that's in place, you can make good decisions.\"\n\nOf course, having some good fortune in the draft doesn't hurt either.\n\n\"If you can draft Tim Duncan after David Robinson, that's a pretty good stroke of luck,\" said Popovich.\n\nThe Spurs began their run by winning 53 games in 1999-2000, and their streak might be even longer had the 1998-'99 strike-season not been shortened to 50 games. The Spurs won their first of four titles that season after going 37-13 during the abbreviated regular season. That .740 winning percentage would have translated into 60 victories over an 82-game season.\n\nMagic Johnson and the Lakers won 50 games for 12 straight seasons from 1980-'91, tying the current Spurs for the longest such streak in league history.\n\nDallas (2001-'10) and Boston (1959-'68) have strung together 10 straight 50-victory seasons, while the Celtics won 50 games for nine straight seasons from 1980-'88.\n\nCoach Don Nelson's Milwaukee Bucks teams from 1981-'87 join Philadelphia (1980-'86), Detroit (2002-'08) and Phoenix (1989-'95) as teams that put together seven straight 50-victory seasons.\n\nThe Spurs this season reached 50 victories in 61 games, the fastest they have ever done so. The 2005-'06 Spurs, who won a franchise-best 63 games, had a 48-13 record after 61 games and won their 50th game in their 64th game, which had been the previous team record.\n\nThis season, the Spurs were the first team to reach 20, 30, 40 and 50 victories and perhaps the only thing that is more impressive than their record is their injury report.\n\nThe Spurs' lineup of Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Richard Jefferson, and DeJuan Blair started together all season until Parker went down last week with a calf injury. Popovich did sit Ginobili at the start of a game against Washington to rest him, but Ginobili played in the game.\n\nParker will miss from two to four weeks. George Hill has started in his place and is expected to get the bulk of the minutes at point guard.\n\n\"As long as T.P. is out, that is what he is going to have to do,\" said Duncan of Hill's aggressive play. \"He will have to accept that role and give us some fire from that position.\"\n\nDuncan, by the way, is the only player who has been with the team throughout the 50-victory streak.\n\n\"I think what this streak says is that Tim Duncan is a pretty good player,\" said San Antonio's Matt Bonner.\n\nPerkins' cuddly side\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 280-pound Kendrick Perkins is trying to show his new Thunder teammates that looks sometimes can be deceiving.\n\n\"I'm showing them that I'm not this mean guy that everybody thinks I am,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't call myself a soft teddy bear because it might mess up my image.\"\n\nSaid Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks, \"He's not going to take anything from players on the court.\"\n\nAn eye on Moses\n\nMinnesota's Kevin Love continues to close in on Moses Malone's streak of 51 straight games in which he recorded a double-double, the league record since the NBA/ABA merger. But Wilt Chamberlain holds the all-time record of 247 consecutive double-double games. Love has recorded at least 30 points and 20 rebounds in four games this season, and the Lakers' Pau Gasol is the only other player to have done that this season.\n\nWhat a guy\n\nDeron Williams handed out 47 assists in his first three games with the Nets, the highest total ever for a player in his first three games with a new team. The previous record of 44 was set by Guy Rodgers in 1966 with Chicago. There had been some speculation after the Nets acquired Williams that he might have to sit out for a while because of hand and wrist injuries, but that was not the case.\n\n\"It's going to be an ongoing problem until we can get him some rest,\" said coach Avery Johnson. \"And when he bangs it, it takes awhile to kind of get back feeling pretty good.\"\n\nSaid Williams, \"They just traded for me. I don't think they traded for me to sit out.\"\n\nYou be the judge\n\nThe Clippers' Blake Griffin was chosen to play in the All-Star Game and Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge was not. But who is the better player? Let's ask Houston's Chuck Hayes, who went up against the two on consecutive nights. Hayes said that Aldridge was better at getting the shots he wants.\n\n\"Blake will get that in time,\" said Hayes. \"If he keeps progressing and working in the summers and the seasons at reading the defense, he'll get it. This is his first 82-game season. With Aldridge, I have to guard him for multiple dribbles. With Blake, I just have to guard his first dribble. His first step and first dribble gets him by a lot of people. If I make him go to a counter-move, an off-balance counter-move, I think I have the advantage.\"\n\nEncore performance\n\nWhen the Nets journeyed overseas to play the Raptors in London, they were trying to avoid being the first team, including the preseason, to ever lose on three continents in the same season. New Jersey lost in China during the preseason and has lost frequently during the regular season in North America. Not a single one of New Jersey's beat writers joined the team on the trip, probably because 12th place in the East was on the line.\n\nJust like a bro'\n\nOklahoma City's Kevin Durant had no advance notice that the team was going to trade his good friend and teammate Jeff Green to Boston in the deal for Perkins. In fact, Durant has revealed that he was in Green's hotel room in Orlando as the deadline approached and Green got the call. Durant, who grew up in the Washington, D.C., area with Green, called it one of his toughest moments he'd gone through as a player.\n\n\"We did everything together,\" said Durant. \"Just to have a brother like that leave was tough for me. What people don't understand from the outside looking in is it's much more than basketball here. We build family relationships.\"\n\nRolling the stones\n\nNew Orleans coach Monty Williams said he had to \"go at some guys\" a little bit after a listless loss to New York since he thought some of the Hornets played scared.\n\n\"I'm not going to get to the summertime and have stones that are unturned,\" he said. \"I cannot stomach guys who go out there and don't play with passion and play afraid. That's what I saw. It's hard to bring it when you're playing afraid. I saw fear in some of our guys' eyes.\"\n\nIn the driver's seat\n\nAfter being traded to Utah, guard Devin Harris spent his 28th birthday strolling through a local mall, trying to get a feel for his new environment. Harris, who admitted it was nice to be back in a winning situation after being in New Jersey, was surprised to be recognized in Utah and was \"freaked out\" at the attention he received around the mall.\n\n\"I had one guy actually park his car in the middle of the road and just chase me down,\" said Harris. \"It's reassuring. I know they're excited. I'm excited to be here.\"\n\nFast breaks\n\nA poll conducted by the Oklahoman newspaper indicated that 82.3% of respondents thought the Thunder was a better team after acquiring Perkins. . . .\n\nCleveland coach Byron Scott on the Spurs: \"That team is just way too good. They do not make a lot of mistakes and that's why they've won championships.\" . . .\n\nWilliams joking with his new Nets teammates in the huddle before his first game: \"Go Jazz.\" . . .\n\nOrlando coach Stan Van Gundy has won 72% of his career games after the all-star break compared with 68% before the break. . . .\n\nPerkins wears No. 5 with the Thunder since the team retired No. 43 worn by Jack Sikma when the franchise was in Seattle. . . .\n\nCleveland's J.J. Hickson on playing with new Cavaliers point guard Baron Davis: \"It's lob city.\"\n\nTHIS WEEK IN THE NBA\n\nThe Hawks have a challenging week ahead. They will play New York, the Lakers and Portland at home along with Chicago on the road. But it's a favorable month overall as they play 12 of 15 games in March at home. \"They have to believe now, regardless of who they line up against, that they can go out there and beat anybody,\" said Atlanta coach Larry Drew. Indiana, trying to hang on to the final playoff spot in the East, is at home against Philadelphia on Tuesday before heading out on a three-game trip that will begin in Minnesota and Toronto. Charlotte, trying to overtake the Pacers, is home all week against the Clippers, Chicago and Portland. The Trail Blazers will also play at Orlando, Miami and Atlanta. After its home game against the Trail Blazers, the Magic will open a five-game trip at Sacramento and Golden State. Orlando's trip will conclude March 16 in Milwaukee. The Lakers will visit San Antonio, Atlanta, Miami and Dallas.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nThe Lakers could pick up some ground in the race for the No. 2 spot in the West with a victory in Dallas on Saturday. It's the last stop on the Lakers' four-game trip, but it also wraps up a five-game week for the Mavericks.\n\nBUCKS WEEK\n\nThe Bucks will play three of four at home. Three-point king Ray Allen and the Celtics visit the Bradley Center Sunday night followed by Cleveland on Wednesday and Philadelphia Saturday. It will be the end of a four-game-in-five-nights stretch for the 76ers, who will play Boston at home on Friday. The Bucks are at Washington on Tuesday.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"You want them to play good but not too good. You want them to play bad but not too bad. It's like you don't want your girl to win a beauty pageant after you break up with her.\"\n\nSan Antonio's Richard Jefferson on his former team, the Nets, acquiring Deron Williams.\n\nPLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nAtlanta's Al Horford tied his career high with 31 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in leading a come-from-behind victory over Chicago. The Hawks trailed by 19 points late in the second quarter but limited the Bulls to 30 points in the second half. A dunk by Horford with 29.4 seconds left gave Atlanta its first lead of the game. \"We're a different team than earlier this year,\" said Horford. \"Games like that, we would have kind of given up.\" Horford became the first Hawks player to finish with more than 30 points and 15 rebounds since Dikembe Mutombo (34 points, 19 rebounds) did it in double overtime against Toronto on Nov. 26, 1997. Horford became the first Hawks player to post those totals in regulation since Kevin Willis (32 points, 16 rebounds) did it against Charlotte on March 23, 1994.\n\nNUMBERS GAME\n\n• The Hornets are 1-11 when the opponent makes 10 or more three-pointers.\n\n• By finishing with 14 points and 18 rebounds against Miami, Orlando's Dwight Howard set a franchise record with 20 straight double-doubles.\n\n• Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge set a career high for misses when he scored 20 points on 9-of-27 shooting in a victory over Sacramento.\n\n• Howard (25 years, 83 days) became the youngest player in league history to grab 7,000 rebounds, breaking the record held by Wilt Chamberlain (26 years, 128 days).\n\n• When the Spurs beat the Cavaliers, it marked the 13th game in NBA history in which a team with a winning percentage over .800 faced a team below .200 at least 40 games into the season. The team with the better record has won each time.\n\nSend e-mail to tenlund@journalsentinel.com.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS\n\nLast week 1. San Antonio Spurs 1 First to reach 50 victories. 2.
