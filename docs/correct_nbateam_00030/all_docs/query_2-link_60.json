Now the Blazers come into town after beating the Sacramento Kings 102-89 on Wednesday. The Spurs are coming off a 119-98 win over the Phoenix Suns, also played Wednesday night. Both teams should be well rested and a ticket to this contest would be one well spent.\n\nLa Marcus Aldridge's game has become much smoother over the last few weeks and has been playing his best ball since signing with the team.\n\n\"Yeah, I've been in a good rhythm and just playing with some confidence,\" Aldridge said. My shot is going in and my teammates are doing a good job of finding me out there, so they make it easy on me. I'm just trying to be more involved. I'm trying to look for my shot more and it's been paying off.\"\n\nThe Spurs hit the road after the Blazers game to take on the Atlanta Hawks before returning to San Antonio to face the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Insider\n\n2010/11 NBA Season\n\nThe ability to keep Tim Duncan healthy this season will be the key factor in your San Antonio Spurs reaching the playoffs. No longer are Spurs managers worried about SF Richard Jefferson as he was under the tutelage of head coach Gregg Popovich for most of the summer. DeJuan Blair has added perimeter weapons to his arsenal and both Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili are both healthy for the first time in two years.\n\nThe Spurs again had a great draft and pundits are again saying how they got the steal of the draft with the selection of SG James Anderson. The Spurs also re-signed Richard Jefferson and Matt Bonner but the biggest off season event is the arrival of the 2007 first round draft selection PF/C Tiago Splitter. Splitter, Blair and Antonio McDyess will be able to relieve Tim of some minutes to help preserve his body for the end run of the season and into the playoffs.\n\nLook for your San Antonio Spurs to be in the thick of the playoff hunt come playoff time so be sure to get your tickets and help support your San Antonio Spurs in 2010/11.\n\n2010 NBA Playoffs\n\nRound 1: Spurs 4 Dallas Mavericks 2\n\nThe 7th seed Spurs were left out of the playoff hunt talk on Sports Radio and TV pendants disregarded them with their usual disrespect and that was just fine for the team that loves to fly under the radar. With four strong victories over the Mavs, they no longer have the luxury of going unnoticed as does the newest Spur to make it known that he gets it and Pops system. Guard George Hill averaged 12.4 PPG in the regular season and dished out only 91 assists less the All Star Tony Parker. In the playoffs, Hill has stepped up his game even further shooting 50%, 82% from the line and 50% from the 3-point stripe while averaging 14.3 PPG. He was the X-Factor in this series.\n\nRound 2 Spurs 0 Phoenix Suns 4\n\nIf tradition holds, this will be one hell of a series. In recent times, the Spurs and Suns have met up for every one of the Spurs three championship runs; hard fought battles that left players bloody and bruised. Although only a handful of players from either team remain, this series will pick up where the last one left off. It will be one intense shootout. Be sure to reserve your seats before they’re all gone!\n\n2009/10 NBA Season\n\nThe 2009/10 San Antonio Spurs will mark the beginning of a new era for Spurs fans around the world. Long gone are the components that made last year’s squad the league’s oldest team (Bowen, Oberto, Thomas) and replaced with eight new players on the Spurs roster (Jefferson, Haislip, Hairston, Jerrells, Ratliff, McDyess, Blair and Keith Bogans). With folks around the league marveling at what every other team in the NBA considered an unworthy pick, PF/C DeJuan Blair has stated publicly that he will make every team who passed on him pay, which is, every team in the NBA. They should worry. In just four preseason games, Blair is averaging 16.0 PPG, (shooting 58%), 9.3 RPG, 1.5 APG and 1.5 SPG while playing an average of 20.8 minutes a contest.\n\nWith veterans Ginobili, Duncan and Parker fully rested from an off season of little to no activity (Parker played for the French League in the summer) and the addition of new and improved firepower, look for the Spurs to be contending with the LA Lakers for the Western Conference Crown.\n\nHistory\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are one of only four teams from the American Basketball Association to merge with the National Basketball Association back in 1976. The other franchises that joined them were the Denver Nuggets, the New Jersey Nets, the Indiana Pacers and the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe first stars for the Spurs Franchise were George Gervin, Gene Banks, Antoine Carr, TC Terry Cummings, the A-Train Artis Gilmore among others and while the early Spurs teams carried a medium of success, it wouldn’t be until the addition of The Admiral, David Robinson in 1989 that the fortunes would change for one of the smallest markets in the league. The Spurs immediately became a yearly contender in the playoffs and have been ever since but it was another number one draft pick that would put the Spurs Franchise into elite status.\n\nIn the 1997 draft, the Spurs chose Wake Forest forward Tim Duncan with the first pick. Duncan would make an immediate impact on the team and the league as he would take home the Rookie of the Year award while averaging 21.1 PPG, 11.9 RPG, 2.7 APG and\n\n2.5 BPG. Two seasons later the “Twin Towers” of Robinson and Duncan would lead the team and the franchise to the pinnacle of the NBA as they won the 1999 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks (who were the first 8th seed in the finals) in four games. The feat would be repeated three years later as Duncan and Robinson again led the Spurs to the promise land in Robinson’s final year. They would face the New Jersey Nets (also the first time two former ABA teams met in the NBA Finals) and would eliminate the Eastern Conference Champion in six games taking the series 4-2.\n\nIn the 2005 season, with a lineup of Duncan, Bowen, Ginobili, Parker, Horry, Brent Barry, Glenn “Big Dog” Robinson and Nazr Mohammed, the Spurs again rolled 59-23 record and would blitz through the Sonics, the Suns and the Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe team would again have a celebratory River Parade down the San Antonio River in 2007 as the team would finish the season with a 58-24 record (25-6 in the final 31 games) and blast through the Nuggets in five games, the Warriors in six games and the Suns in six games to play for their 4th NBA Title in nine years. They would meet the LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers (who most considered Spurs East Coast) and take them out in a sweep of four games. Tony Parker won the Finals MVP Award making him the first European to win the prize.\n\nDespite missing being knocked out of the playoffs the last two seasons, Spurs fans have reason to rejoice as the team gears up to take on the league with a renewed sense of purpose and self. With names like Jefferson, Blair alongside Parker, Duncan and Ginobili, the Spurs fortunes are again on the rise and Spurs fans will expect nothing but another championship."
