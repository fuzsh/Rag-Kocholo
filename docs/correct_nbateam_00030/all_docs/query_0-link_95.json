        "text": "If and when the 2019-20 NBA season resumes is still to be determined but if it does, then former San Antonio Spurs forward Richard Jefferson and Lakers' LeBron James propose a mini-tournament to determine which team will get the 8th seed in the West.\n\nBefore the season was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spurs were still in contention for the final spot in the West postseason. The team had key games left on their regular-season schedule against the Pelicans, Grizzlies, and Kings which could have determined the outcome for the Spurs.\n\nBut if the season resumes, and the NBA wants to get things going fast, James and Jefferson are proposing a quick tournament with the Spurs battling it out as they discussed on Jefferson's \"Road Trippin'\" podcast.\n\n\"You can have Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, and San Antonio play... have a tournament right,\" Jefferson said.\n\nSaid James: \"So you have the eighth seed playing 11 right and then you got nine playing 10 correct? We can sit here and figure it out.\"\n\nJefferson also proposed the Spurs start the tournament against the Blazers in a best-of-three games series with James on board.\n\n\"You can have Portland play San Antonio and New Orleans play Sacramento. Best-of-three games and the winner of that plays a best of three games,\" Jefferson added.\n\nJames definitely is on board with this idea adding one of the teams fighting for a playoff berth could get \"hot\" at the right moment and get in.\n\nAgain, this is just an idea but if the NBA were agree, it would give the Spurs an even playing ground to make it an NBA record 23rd-straight straight appearance in the post-season.\n\nThe Spurs would not have to finish out their 19 remaining regular-season games, hope teams lose in order for them to have a slim chance at making the playoffs.\n\nWith a tournament, the Spurs could control their own destiny - win or go home.\n\nWhat say you Spurs fans? Agree with this idea to determine the West's final playoff team? Let me know on Twitter at .\n\n( contributed to this post)"
