        "text": "The Golden State Warriors They have continued to move in the NBA market and have transferred their recent signing Stephen jackson a San Antonio Spurs in exchange of Richard Jefferson, the retired TJ Ford and a conditional first round of the draft.\n\nJackson had been acquired by the Warriors in the trade with the Milwaukee Bucks and has not been part of the team for more than a few hours. Gregg Popovich has always had a good relationship with Jackson, part of the Spurs squad that won the 2003 ring.\n\nIn turn, Richard Jefferson puts an end to a turbulent period in the Texan franchise, marked by a higher contract than what he finally demonstrated on the field. The forward, after almost three seasons in San Antonio, will now play for his fourth team in the NBA, after the Nets, Bucks and Spurs. The presence of TJ Ford in the transfer has no other explanation than to free up salary expenses for the Spurs. The point guard already announced a few days ago his retirement as a player due to a spinal cord injury."
