In the last month I’ve dealt with two life changing events back to back. My decision to move on from basketball and the tragic passing of Big Rich. The support of my family and friends have been huge. This video was taken after he bbq’d for about 20 people, something he would do a few times every summer. All I would do is tell people that I was having people over to my house and the next question was “Is Big Rich on the grill?” He really was a true OG. I’m going to miss all his one-liners, his cooking and his ability to make a whole room laugh. Until next time!!!!\n\nJefferson played with the Spurs from 2009-12 before being traded to the Warriors for Stephen Jackson. He also played with the Nets, Nuggets, Mavericks, Cavaliers, Jazz and Bucks. He won an NBA title with Cleveland in 2016."
