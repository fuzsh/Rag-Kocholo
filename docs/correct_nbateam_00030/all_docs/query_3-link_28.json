        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs have had successful winning seasons since early 2000s. During the Tim Duncan era, the team never had a losing record and always made the playoffs for the past 22 seasons. But that streak came to a close after the team missed out on making the postseason in 2020. While the credit may go to its star players, one big reason for the Spurs’ longevity is none other than their head Coach Gregg Popovich. Among others, LeBron James’ former teammate has stamped on this coaching legacy.\n\nOn a recent podcast, LeBron James’ buddy and former teammate went on to talk about the impact Coach Pop will have on Victor Wembanyama. This former NBA champion went on to draw comparisons between Wemby’s Coach and this boxer’s dark tragedy.\n\nLeBron James’ former teammate draws an interesting comparison\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRichard Jefferson and Allie Clifton went on to talk about the San Antonio Spurs landing the number one pick, Victor Wembanyama. The two hosts also talked about the impact Gregg Popovich would have on their podcast, Road Trippin’.\n\nJefferson went on to draw a comparison between Popovich and Mike Tyson’s past tragedy. “Mike Tyson, I think is Vic(Cus) D’Amato,” Jefferson said. “So somebody will correct me. But he was an old, like a legend trainer. Let’s call him Pop, right?”\n\nRead More: “You and Your Son Will Be Joining Him Soon”: Hours After $80 Million Deal, LeBron James’ Self-Invite to Dinner Might Excite Victor Wembanyama Fanatics”\n\n“He was that guy,” Jefferson continued, “like he was one of the greatest trainers of all time. He found Mike Tyson at 19 and was like you’re going to be my greatest achievement and just got Mike. And one of the reasons why Mike started to struggle is because Vic(Cus) passed away. He was very very old. But my point is, these once-in-a-generation, these once-in-a-lifetime guys can give you purpose.”\n\n“They can give you a reason, they can give you that energy to be like, ‘Hey look, I might not be with him for his whole career, but if my last f***ing stretch is to give this kid the base that’s gonna allow him to be great, then oh, that’s purpose every day’.”\n\nCoach Pop’s star-studded history\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRichard Jefferson went on to talk about head coach Gregg Popovich being embedded in the Spurs organization. There is no San Antonio Spurs without Coach Pop, he suggested. Given that Jefferson played for the Spurs for two seasons, he does know what he is talking about.\n\nAfter landing Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs extended Popvich’s contract by giving him the biggest deal a coach has ever gotten.\n\nAnd looking at Coach Pop’s history of coaching great stars, there is no one better to guide and mold a young Wembanyama than him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: Following his latest ESPYs win, LeBron James further pushes himself away from GOAT rival, Michael Jordan\n\nThe future is bright for the young Frenchman and the Spurs organization going forward."
