        "text": "The Golden State Warriors traded swingman Stephen Jackson to the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday for small forward Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round draft pick this year.\n\nGolden State acquired Jackson — who helped the Warriors reach the second round of the playoffs in 2007 — and centre Andrew Bogut from the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown. There was immediate thought that the Warriors would then try to deal Jackson by Thursday's NBA trade deadline.\n\nThey were able to do it and got a much coveted first-round pick in the process. Golden State had previously agreed to send its first round pick to Utah if it is not in the top seven. The Warriors now will likely be back in the first round. San Antonio's pick is lottery protected, but the Spurs are in second place in the Western Conference so that will probably not be an issue.\n\n\"We've been aggressive in the last 48 hours and feel this is another transaction that will benefit our team, both now and in the future,\" general manager Larry Riley said. \"Richard Jefferson has played a key role and has been a solid contributor on some very successful basketball teams during his career. He has won a lot of games and will certainly provide our team with some veteran leadership and perimeter shooting skills. Additionally, as has been well-documented, we are in an unknown position in regards to our first round draft pick this season and are quite pleased to, potentially, acquire a pick in what is expected to be a pretty deep draft.\"\n\nThe Warriors also acquired the rights to T.J. Ford, who announced his retirement earlier this week following the latest scare to his surgically repaired spine.\n\nThe Warriors also acquired a second-round pick for this June's draft from the Atlanta Hawks for cash considerations in an earlier deal.\n\nRookie Klay Thompson appreciates the efforts being made to upgrade the roster moving forward.\n\n\"I think Warriors management is doing a great job,\" Thompson said. \"They're not going to make any moves that are going to move this team backward. I'm happy with it, and I support whatever they do.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Jefferson is averaging 9.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game this season for the Spurs. He could be in the Bay Area in time for Friday night's game against the Bucks, which will mark Ellis' much-hyped, quick return to Oracle Arena in an opposing uniform.\n\nBlazers move Wallace\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says the New Jersey Nets have acquired Gerald Wallace from the Portland Trail Blazers for two injured players and a protected first-round draft pick.\n\nThe Nets sent center Mehmet Okur and forward Shawne Williams to Portland along with their own 2012 draft pick. The pick is protected if it is in the top three, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the teams have not announced the deal.\n\nA 2010 All Star, Wallace is averaging 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds in 42 starts. He also is an outstanding defensive small forward.\n\nOkur has been sidelined since Jan. 27 with a sore lower back. Williams is out for the year after having surgery on his left foot in early February.\n\nCamby, Fisher are Houston bound\n\nA person familiar with the deal says the Houston Rockets have acquired centre Marcus Camby from Portland and Derek Fisher and a 2012 first-round pick from the Los Angeles Lakers in separate trades.\n\nThe Rockets are sending point guard Jonny Flynn, centre Hasheem Thabeet and a second-round pick to the Trail Blazers and forward Jordan Hill to the Lakers. The person spoke Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Camby brings a much-needed inside presence to the Rockets, who are 24-20 and currently hold the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference. Fisher provides depth and championship experience to the point-guard spot. Goran Dragic has started the last four games in place of Kyle Lowry, who's out with a bacterial infection.\n\nFisher has spent 13 of his 16 NBA seasons with the Lakers and was part of five championship teams with Kobe Bryant. The Rockets play the Lakers in Houston on Tuesday.\n\nThe Rockets have been looking for big men since Yao Ming retired last summer. They were ready to trade Dragic, Luis Scola and Kevin Martin for Pau Gasol before the season, but NBA commissioner David Stern nixed the trade for \"basketball reasons\" on behalf of the league-owned New Orleans Hornets.\n\nFollowing the news, Hill took to Twitter: \"I had a good time being in houston with the rockets, the players, staff, and the fans…I'm gonna miss y'all It's LA time…#LakerNation.\"\n\n76ers deal for Young\n\nThe 76ers on Thursday acquired Sam Young from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for the rights to Ricky Sanchez.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 220-pound Young, who plays guard and forward, was the 36th overall pick by Memphis in 2009 out of Pittsburgh. He averaged 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds, and 17.5 minutes per game with the Grizzlies.\n\nThe Sixers acquired Sanchez's rights from Denver, along with Reggie Evans, in exchange for Steven Hunter and Bobby Jones on Sept. 10, 2007.\n\n\"We feel Sam's overall skill set can be a valuable asset to our team,\" Philadelphia president Rod Thorn said. \"He adds to our depth at two positions.\"\n\nLakers land Sessions\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers acquired point guard Ramon Sessions from Cleveland on Thursday in a four-player trade sending Luke Walton and Jason Kapono to the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Lakers also got forward Christian Eyenga in the deal, while the Cavaliers will get the Lakers' lottery-protected first-round pick in the upcoming draft and other considerations, according to the Lakers. Sessions is Kyrie Irving's backup in Cleveland, averaging 10.5 points and 5.2 assists. He was expected to opt out of his contract following the season to become a free agent, but he is likely to have a major role with the Lakers alongside Steve Blake, who has been Fisher's backup this season.\n\nThe Lakers unloaded the albatross contract of Walton, a two-time NBA champion who has played almost no significant minutes for Los Angeles in the past three years. Kapono, who signed with the Lakers shortly before training camp last summer, returns to the team that drafted him out of UCLA in 2003.\n\nOne player the Lakers didn't move was Pau Gasol, who clearly wasn't immune to the rumours: \"The uncertainty has come to an end! Happy to continue wearing the @Lakers uniform! Now time to focus in playing basketball and winning!\"\n\nWizards acquire Nene in 3-team trade\n\nThe Denver Nuggets agreed Thursday to ship big man Nene to Washington in a three-team deal, with the Wizards sending JaVale McGee and Ronny Turiaf to Denver and Nick Young to the Los Angeles Clippers, a person with knowledge of the trade told The Associated Press.\n\nWashington also picked up forward Brian Cook in the deal. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because no formal announcement had been made about the deal, which was completed right at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Nuggets signed Nene to a new five-year, $67 million contract in December. He was averaging 13.4 points and 7.4 rebounds in an injury-plagued season. But the recent play of rookie forward Kenneth Faried made Nene expendable.\n\nESPN was among the first to report the trade and also said that Washington would receive a future second-round pick from Los Angeles.\n\nCeltics keep Big 3\n\nThe Boston Celtics are standing pat at the NBA's trade deadline.\n\nThe deadline passed at 3 p.m. EDT on Thursday.\n\nHeading into the deadline, there had been a lot of talk about giving up on the last shot for the new Big 3 and building for the future. Deals for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen were all rumoured, as well as point guard Rajon Rondo.\n\nThe Celtics also need to replace forward Chris Wilcox, who was diagnosed this week with an enlarged aorta that will keep him out for the rest of the season.\n\nHornets stand pat\n\nHornets general manager Dell Demps says there's been no talk of buying out the rest of Chris Kaman's contract and that New Orleans would prefer to hold on to the 7-foot centre.\n\nThe Hornets have explored trade offers for Kaman, who is in the final year of a contract that pays about $14 million this season. However, Demps decided against trading Kaman on Thursday before the NBA trade deadline passed.\n\nDemps says \"the door is not closed\" on the Hornets keeping Kaman, who has averaged 20.8 points during his past five games.\n\nKaman says he is happy to be able to maintain some of the relationships he has formed with teammates and others in New Orleans and \"certainly\" sees a future with the Hornets beyond this season."
