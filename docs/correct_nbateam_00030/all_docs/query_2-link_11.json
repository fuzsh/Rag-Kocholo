        "text": "Richard Jefferson has joined the army of well-known former or current basketball players who are delighted by the atmosphere created by Partizan’s fans.\n\nRichard Jefferson is a former NBA player and a current analyst on ESPN. He won an NBA championship ring with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. He played in the NBA from 2001 to 2018. Upon seeing a video of Partizan’s fans, he reacted:\n\n“Okay, this has to be said. No college crowd, no NBA crowd comes close to international. Not! So when you ask the players “oh, how heavy was the atmosphere? Did the crowd boo?” It’s not!"
