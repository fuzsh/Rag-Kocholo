        "text": "Long before Wembanyama took the court for his NBA debut, oddsmakers had already priced the Spurs rookie as the clear-cut favorite to win one of the league’s most coveted awards, with an outside chance of multiple trophies in his debut campaign.\n\nHe entered the season as the runaway favorite to win NBA Rookie of the Year and a long shot to win MVP. He also opened among the favorites to win Defensive Player of the Year even before stepping foot in a real NBA game.\n\nThere is one potential drawback to betting on Wembanyama to win any of these awards: Will he play enough games?\n\nThe NBA’s new rules regarding awards eligibility means the rookie will have to play at least 20 minutes in at least 65 games (with minor exceptions), which could be tricky depending on the Spurs’ plans for their franchise star.\n\nIf Wembanyama gets hurt at any point during this season – which profiles as a rebuilding year for San Antonio – coach Gregg Popovich could opt to shut down the generational prospect to avoid a long-term injury.\n\nEven if he remains healthy, there’s a chance the team shelves him once the playoffs are beyond reach, which could prematurely end his chances of winning an award.\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nWembanyama opened as a -130 favorite to win NBA Rookie of the Year shortly after being drafted first overall, and he entered the 2023-24 season dealing at that same price on at least one online betting site.\n\nWembanyama was the first player to enter the season as the odds-on favorite to win NBA Rookie of the Year since Kevin Durant (-200) in 2007, when the former SuperSonics star ran away with the award averaging 20.3 points as a 19-year old.\n\nOnly three other players – Scoot Henderson (+240), Chet Holmgren (+280) and Brandon Miller (+1600) – entered the season with odds shorter than 25/1 to win Rookie of the Year, and only two of them are true rookies. Holmgren missed the entire 2022-23 season with injury.\n\nMost Valuable Player\n\nThe Spurs rookie entered the season as a 90/1 long shot to win MVP at DraftKings, ranking him inside the top 40 to win the award. He had better odds to win MVP than the likes of All-Stars Tyrese Haliburton and Darius Garland and recent No. 1 picks Cade Cunningham and Paolo Banchero.\n\nEven the greatest players of all-time have fallen short of that lofty goal in their debut season, as only two players – Wilt Chamberlain (1959-60) and Wes Unseld (1968-69) – have ever taken home the NBA MVP trophy in their rookie year.\n\nDefensive Player of the Year\n\nEntering the season, Wembanyama was listed at 15/1 to win Defensive Player of the Year at DraftKings – the ninth-shortest odds of any player to win the award.\n\nWembanyama slotted just behind Brook Lopez, who finished second in voting last year, and three-time winner Rudy Gobert. He also boasted better odds than former DPOY winners Draymond Green, Marcus Smart and Kawhi Leonard.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean Wembanyama is already a better defender than those players. But he could be. Standing at 7-foot-5 in shoes, the 19-year-old Frenchman has the potential to defend the paint at an elite level while also being a suffocating perimeter defender.\n\nAs the anticipation was building ahead of Wembanyama’s official NBA debut, fans were left combing through his stats in the preseason and summer league for a taste of what to expect when he finally took the court for an official NBA game.\n\nAll of those stats told the same story: Wembanyama has elite potential as a rookie on both ends of the court, and there’s no telling what his upside could be even in his first season.\n\nPreseason Numbers\n\nEven before Wembanyama played first official NBA game, the Spurs rookie was wreaking havoc in his first taste of league action.\n\nIn four preseason games, Wembanyama averaged 19.3 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists on 50.9% shooting from the floor, adding 2.8 blocks and 1.0 steals per game. He did all of that in just 20.9 minutes per game.\n\nIf you took his stats and stretched them across 36 minutes, he would have averaged a whopping 33.2 points and a ridiculous 4.7 blocks per game – both of which would approach the all-time rookie records across a full season.\n\nFans and bettors alike received a sneak peek of Wembanyama in action during the 2023 NBA Summer League, which was his first time sharing the court with fellow NBA prospects since being drafted first overall in June.\n\nIn his debut against the Hornets, the No. 1 pick struggled, shooting only 2-of-13 from the field to finish with nine points. Wembanyama also grabbed eight rebounds in the contest. His defense was elite, blocking five shots in his first unofficial taste of NBA action.\n\nIn his second Summer League game against the Trail Blazers, Wembanyama demonstrated his offensive prowess, scoring 27 points and grabbing 12 rebounds in a loss for San Antonio.\n\nAfter that game, the Spurs opted to shut down their prized asset for the remainder of Summer League to avoid any injury risk, which could be a sign of things to come in the 2023-24 NBA season.\n\nIn June 2023, the Spurs drafted Wembanyama with the first overall pick. This came after NBA evaluators labeled him as the greatest prospect in NBA draft history.\n\nTo complement praise from front office members and reporters, James – who was once considered a generational prospect in his own right – called Wembanyama “an alien.”\n\nWembanyama was a near gambling lock (to use a popular sports betting term) to cross the Barclays Center stage before all of his draftmates in 2023. At NBA sportsbooks, he was a -20000 betting odds favorite to be the first draft pick in the ‘23 class.\n\nHe opened at -2000 in late 2022, but as the weeks and months passed, it was clear there was no stopping Wembanyama’s momentum. As his odds skyrocketed to -8000, some oddsmakers no longer allowed fans to wager on any other individual player. Instead, you could only take “the field” against Wembanyama going No. 1.\n\nBy spring, Wembanyama was -20000. To win $100, sports bettors would have had to risk $20,000. There was no point in betting on anyone other than the Frenchman to go first overall, right? Well, some sports bettors were essentially betting on a Wembanyama injury – though even that might not have stopped the Spurs from taking him first.\n\nEarly in 2023, Scoot Henderson (+3000 to go first overall) was the only other player worth discussing, even though his odds were long. Henderson ended up going third, with Alabama’s Brandon Miller selected second.\n\nBetting odds of -20000 to go No. 1 had an implied probability of 99.5%. Wembanyama at No. 1 was the biggest foregone conclusion since James in 2023.\n\nRichard Jefferson, a 19-year NBA veteran who won a championship with James, said his former teammate would’ve gone second in a draft with Wembanyama. NBA franchises salivated at the prospect of landing Wembanyama in the draft. The NBA Draft Lottery took place May 16, 2023, with the Spurs hitting the jackpot.\n\nDuring an interview, Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said to “pray for Victor (Wembanyama).” Houston had the worst record in the NBA when he made the comment, and the Rockets finished tied with the Spurs for the second-worst regular season record.\n\nUnfortunately for Fertitta, but fortunately for the competitive integrity of the NBA, draft position is not determined solely by the regular season. Instead, teams are assigned a spot in the draft through a lottery instituted in 1985.\n\nTanking to Draft Wembanyama?\n\nThe 14 teams not qualifying for the playoffs are in the draft lottery. The teams with the three worst records have a 14% chance of the first pick, and the odds lengthen from there.\n\nThe lottery determines the first four positions on the draft board, and the remaining 10 spots are filled out in reverse order of record. That ensures that the team with the worst regular-season record gets no worse than the fifth pick, although that could be the difference between a franchise-changing star and a solid role player.\n\nBefore the 2020 NBA Draft, the team with the worst record had the best odds of landing the No. 1 pick, and only the top three draft positions were determined by the lottery. Changes were made to discourage teams from “tanking,” or intentionally losing regular-season games. Still, there were allegations of tanking for the Frenchman.\n\nThe Rockets, Spurs, Pistons and Hornets were the favorites to land the top pick in the draft. Their records at the end of the 2022-23 NBA regular season:\n\nPistons: 17-65\n\nRockets: 22-60\n\nSpurs: 22-60\n\nHornets: 27-55\n\nOnly the three worst teams have a 14% chance of the first pick, as the fourth-worst team’s chances drop to 12.5%. Of those four teams, only one (Detroit in 2021) has had the first overall pick in the last 20 years.\n\nThe 2007-08 Chicago Bulls were the luckiest team in NBA draft history. Having finished 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 33-49 record, the Bulls had a 1.7% chance of landing the No. 1 pick. They defied the odds and selected future MVP and Chicago native Derrick Rose.\n\nPhoto by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images"
