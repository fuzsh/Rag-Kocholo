        "text": "In a recent interview, Richard Jefferson referred to San Antonio as “dump” when asked about the worst cities he played in during his NBA career.\n\nOf the thirty NBA teams, Jefferson played with seven: New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Denver Nuggets.\n\nJefferson retired in 2018 but that he is, at thirty-nine, coming out of retirement at the request of absolutely nobody.\n\nJefferson played seven seasons with the New Jersey Nets alongside Jason Kidd. During their tenure, they made two NBA Finals appearances. He was brought to the Spurs where his game significantly dipped, causing contention between him in the franchise and eventually leading to his being traded to the Warriors.\n\nAll feelings aside, Jefferson makes derogatory remarks about both Tim Duncan and San Antonio, which probably doesn’t come as a shock to many. But to take the time and energy to do both in an interview seems unnecessary.\n\nYou can read the article and link to a 6 minute video here.\n\nWelcome to the Thread.
