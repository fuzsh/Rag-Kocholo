        "text": "Tim Duncan is known for his composed demeanor and respect for the game. His initial refusal was a clear indication of Duncan's unwillingness to engage in a debate that could potentially undermine the legacy of any of the three basketball icons. Jefferson, however, pressed further, playfully reminding Duncan that he couldn't plead the fifth on the show.\n\nDuncan then delivered a perfect response, showcasing his characteristic humility and reverence for the greatness of his contemporaries. This answer not only deflected the contentious nature of the question but also highlighted Duncan's recognition of the unparalleled contributions of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James to the sport of basketball.\n\nRichard Jefferson, acknowledging the grace and wisdom in Duncan's response, concluded that was the correct answer. This exchange underscored the mutual respect among NBA greats and the understanding that such comparisons, while often debated by fans and analysts, are not always conducive to appreciating the unique greatness each player brought to the game.\n\nTim Duncan's response is a testament to his character. Throughout his career, he was known not only for his exceptional skills and achievements on the court but also for his leadership, humility, and respect for his peers.\n\nBy choosing to start all three and cut and bench himself, Duncan avoided diminishing the legacy of Jordan, Bryant, and James. Instead, he elevated the conversation, reminding everyone that the true spirit of the game lies in celebrating the greatness of all players and recognizing their individual contributions to basketball.\n\nTim Duncan On Who Would 'Start-Bench-Cut' Between His 3 Legendary Teammates\n\nIn the same episode of \"The Richard & Larry Show,\" hosted by Richard Jefferson, NBA legend Tim Duncan faced another challenging question. Jefferson, continuing with the theme of \"Start-Bench-Cut,\" asked Duncan to make a tough decision between his three legendary San Antonio Spurs teammates: Tony Parker, Manu Gin√≥bili, and David Robinson.\n\n\"I'll start David, bench Manu and I'll cut the French boy.\" (1:17)\n\nWhen asked to choose who he would start, bench, and cut among these iconic San Antonio Spurs teammates, Duncan humorously yet thoughtfully responded, that he would Robinson while benching Ginobili as he chose to cut Parker. This playful yet difficult decision reflects Duncan's deep respect and admiration for each of these players while also acknowledging the formidable presence of his long-time teammates.\n\nStarting with David Robinson, Duncan's choice highlights the significant impact Robinson had on his career. Known as \"The Admiral,\" Robinson was a dominant force in the painting and a mentor to Duncan during the early stages of his career. Together, they formed one of the most formidable frontcourt duos in NBA history, leading the Spurs to their first championship in 1999.\n\nBenching Manu Ginobili reflects Duncan's recognition of Ginobili's versatility and game-changing abilities off the bench. Ginobili, known for his electrifying play and clutch performances, was a crucial component of the Spurs' success. His willingness to embrace a sixth-man role, despite his star-caliber talent, epitomized the selflessness and team-first mentality that defined the Spurs dynasty.\n\nFinally, cutting Tony Parker, though said with a hint of humor, underscores the depth of talent and tough decisions Duncan faced. Parker, the dynamic French point guard, was instrumental in the Spurs' multiple championship runs. His speed, scoring ability, and leadership were pivotal in securing victories and establishing the Spurs as perennial contenders.\n\nDuncan's answer, filled with light-heartedness and respect, reflects the camaraderie and mutual admiration that characterized the Spurs' locker room. It also highlights the unique and irreplaceable roles each player had in contributing to the team's legacy of excellence."
