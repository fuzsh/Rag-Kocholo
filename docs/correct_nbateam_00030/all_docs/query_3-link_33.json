        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs exude an air of quiet professionalism,\n\nsuggesting a team of diligent stay-after-practice drudges\n\nstriving to get the most out of their ability. From time to time\n\nthey try too hard to play perfectly, thinking instead of\n\nreacting, and allow double-digit leads to slip away. But those\n\nclose to the Spurs also know them as loosey-goosey and\n\nfun-loving, inclined to roll their eyes at the\n\ngood-little-worker-bees image. ¬∂ Put simply, the San Antonio\n\nSpurs are their 7-foot power forward, Tim Duncan. His character,\n\nintelligence and disposition run through this team as surely as\n\nthe San Antonio River winds through the heart of the Alamo\n\nCity. \"Tim sets the tone,\" reserve forward Danny Ferry said\n\nbefore Game 4 of a Western Conference final in which the Spurs\n\ndefeated the Dallas Mavericks four games to two. \"The work\n\nethic, the way he's always improving--those things provide a\n\nmodel.\" A few minutes later, as forward Bruce Bowen stood at\n\nthe baseline doing an interview, Duncan peppered Bowen's back\n\nwith bounce passes. When Bowen was finished, he and Duncan\n\nhappily hacked each other for the next few minutes in a game of\n\none-on-one. \"Now and then,\" said assistant coach P.J. Carlesimo,\n\n\"Tim Duncan knows how to be a goofball.\"\n\nIt's a safe bet that the goofball Duncan will not be on prominent\n\ndisplay against the New Jersey Nets in the Finals. Poised for a\n\nrun at the second title of his six-year career after winning\n\nconsecutive MVP awards, he stands alone at the NBA\n\nmountaintop--where he would no doubt prefer to wear sandals, an\n\nuntucked shirt and a look that says he could live without all the\n\nfuss. Even when the Mavs limited his effectiveness, \"holding\"\n\nDuncan to an average of 20.7 points and 15.3 rebounds in the\n\nfinal three games after he had put up 35.3 and 18.0 in the first\n\nthree, it was because they double-, triple-and sometimes\n\nquadruple-teamed him, thus providing his teammates with jump\n\nshots that were frighteningly unimpeded. (And frightening is the\n\ncorrect word, considering how often they passed them up to jam\n\nthe ball in to Duncan.)\n\nWith the Texas shootout continuing while the Nets were cooling\n\ntheir heels--after sweeping the Detroit Pistons, they would be\n\nidle for 11 days before Game 1 on Wednesday--the excellence of\n\nthe 27-year-old Duncan has been the most sustained theme of this\n\nyear's playoffs. True, Nets point guard Jason Kidd, with his\n\nbaseline-to-baseline dashes, impending free agency and rumors of\n\nhis possible move to San Antonio, will grab a share of the Finals\n\nspotlight. But Duncan has emerged as the postseason's principal\n\nprotagonist, a role played the past three seasons by the Los\n\nAngeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nConsequently, this has been a quieter postseason. We'll get no\n\ntrash talk from T.D. or from his toe-the-line teammates. Even\n\nDuncan's dunkin' has a tameness about it. \"He's not throwing\n\nbehind-the-back passes, he's not doing tomahawk jams, he's not\n\ndoing anything that's very flashy,\" says New Jersey coach Byron\n\nScott. \"He's just a very unassuming guy who goes about his job,\n\nand the next thing you know he's got 23 points and 20 rebounds,\n\nlike it's a normal day at the job.\"\n\nDuncan's only obvious flaw is his free throw shooting (71.0%\n\nduring the regular season, 67.4% in the playoffs), but that\n\nstands out partly because every other aspect of his game is so\n\ngood. In contrast to the Big Scene Stealer, Duncan works his\n\nmagic almost invisibly. Most superstars have a physical attribute\n\nthat clearly explains their mastery--O'Neal's earth-moving mass,\n\nKidd's Energizer Bunny stamina, Kobe Bryant's quickness, Kevin\n\nGarnett's pogo-stick leaping ability. But Duncan doesn't seem to\n\nbe stronger or quicker or more explosive than the average player;\n\nthe prosaic economy of his game is, paradoxically, its most\n\ndistinctive characteristic. Neither does he have anything\n\nconspicuous that he gets away with, such as Patrick Ewing's palm\n\ndribble or the shoulder-dipping clear-out that drives Shaq's\n\ndetractors to distraction. As Carlesimo puts it, Duncan is \"the\n\nmost fundamentally sound player since...since...maybe ever.\"\n\nThe broad outlines of Duncan's success are obvious. After Shaq,\n\nhe is the league's most reliable low-post scorer, but his menu of\n\njumpers (face-up and turnaround) and jump hooks (from either\n\nblock) is more varied than O'Neal's and a threat from greater\n\nrange. \"Tim's moves are one thing,\" says Ferry, \"but what makes\n\nhim special are his countermoves, the kind that [former Boston\n\nCeltic] Kevin McHale had. You stop him one way, he's got two\n\nbackup ways to get it done.\" Duncan's defense (he's been a\n\nfirst-team all-league defender in each of his six seasons)\n\nmirrors his offense: dependable, understated and, of course,\n\nfundamentally sound. To get at the essence of Duncan's game it's\n\nimperative to see how well he does the little things. To wit:\n\n--In the Spurs' half-court offense, he almost never gives up his\n\ndribble early in the possession while waiting for double and\n\ntriple teams to come at him. He waits, patiently holding the ball\n\nout of reach, eyes up, then makes impeccable decisions. (On\n\noccasion, though, he's too generous: A somewhat forced attempt\n\nfrom Duncan, a 54.1% shooter in the playoffs, is better than a\n\ngood one from any other Spur.) If defenders don't adequately\n\ncorral him, Duncan will step through for a leaning jumper, often\n\ndrawing a foul in the process. Or he'll use his dribble to get\n\ninto the lane.\n\n--Duncan is both nimble enough and accurate enough shooting from\n\nthe outside to be a big part of the pick-and-roll offense. He'll\n\nset up on one side of the blocks, then cut across diagonally to\n\nset a high screen for a guard, usually Tony Parker. Duncan\n\ndoesn't have three-point range but positions himself in a spot\n\naround the elbow where he must be guarded.\n\n--Unlike many big men, such as Shaq, Duncan is also a big part of\n\nthe pick-and-roll defense. He can \"show\"--jump at the ball\n\nhandler, then retreat and cover his man--or he can leave his man\n\nand frantically double-team the ball. The Nets will test that\n\nability. They're certain to use Kenyon Martin as their pick man\n\nin an attempt to draw Duncan out, and no guard in the league is\n\nmore adept than Kidd at forcing the action off a pick-and-roll.\n\n--Duncan \"closes out\" well on shooters, something big men rarely\n\ndo. That means he charges out quickly to cover opponents on the\n\nperimeter but not so quickly that he allows them to go by him.\n\n--Duncan is an immovable object on defense, not in terms of sheer\n\nbulk, like O'Neal, but in his ability to resist fakes. In the six\n\ngames of the Dallas series he had 18 blocks and only 22 personal\n\nfouls, an enviable ratio for any big man. Watch for encounters\n\nnear the basket between Duncan and Kidd, who loves to take it\n\nhard to the hoop.\n\nUntil this postseason the major blotch on Duncan's resume\n\ninvolved his performances against the Lakers, which included\n\nseven losses in eight postseason games in the previous two years.\n\nLos Angeles coach Phil Jackson helpfully suggested to the Spurs\n\nthat their 1998-99 championship should bear an asterisk because\n\nit was a strike-shortened season; O'Neal, MVP of the last three\n\nFinals, likewise sniffed at Duncan's regular-season awards,\n\nstrongly implying that the important hardware is handed out in\n\nJune. In this year's Western Conference semifinal, though, Duncan\n\naveraged 28.0 points and 11.8 rebounds against the Lakers, and\n\nSan Antonio's bloodlessly efficient 110-82 victory at L.A. in\n\nGame 6 replaced that blotch with a gold star.\n\nBeyond his free throw shooting, what blemishes are now evident in\n\nthe game of a player before whose name the words fundamentally\n\nsound have been permanently attached? Backup center Kevin Willis,\n\nwho has spent 18 seasons with eight teams and who engages Duncan\n\nin practice-session wars, considered the question for a full\n\nminute. \"Frankly,\" he said, \"I'm baffled. Can't find anything.\"\n\nThe Nets were equally baffled, though perhaps they feared\n\ndivulging their plan for D-ing up T.D. \"Free throws is about it,\"\n\nsaid Martin, who will spend considerable time pressing his\n\ntattoos into Duncan's epidermis.\n\nSurely there must be flaws, so we set out, Diogenes-like, to turn\n\na lantern on them. The search wasn't particularly fruitful. Spurs\n\nreserve guard Steve Kerr, who won three titles with the Chicago\n\nBulls in the 1990s and another with San Antonio in '99, was the\n\nonly respondent to answer quickly, saying, \"I think he could\n\nimprove a little with his left hand.\" (You must understand that\n\nKerr wants to be a coach someday--he'll be a good one--and is\n\ntherefore predisposed to nitpicking.) Spurs forward Malik Rose\n\nsaid he couldn't think of any flaws, then snapped his fingers. \"I\n\ngot it,\" he said. \"He can't shoot his bank shot from the right\n\nside as well as the left.\"\n\nDavid Robinson, who is in his final season as Duncan's\n\nin-the-paint playmate, shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I guess\n\nyou could say he could improve his jumping ability. But,\n\nultimately, what's the difference? He gets every rebound that\n\ncomes into his hands and dunks over people.\"\n\nDallas forward Eduardo Najera, who was called upon to guard\n\nDuncan from time to time in the Western final despite being four\n\ninches smaller, laughed at the question. \"He can go left, he can\n\ngo right, he can spin, he can back you in,\" Najera said. \"You\n\nthink about pushing him out, but now he's hitting that midrange\n\nshot all the time. All you can say is that he's not a great\n\nthree-point shooter.\" To which Mavericks assistant coach Avery\n\nJohnson, a former Spurs teammate of Duncan's, added, \"If Tim\n\nstarts making threes, we can all go home.\" (Before the Finals,\n\nDuncan had attempted only 10 treys in the postseason, all of them\n\nclock beaters, and made none.)\n\nRaef LaFrentz, who guarded Duncan the majority of time in the\n\nWestern final, believes that he is the most \"fundamentally sound\n\ninside player in the world.\" Said LaFrentz, \"Any small mistake,\n\nany lapse in your thinking, he will make you pay. Some great\n\nplayers, like Shaq, will take a possession or two off. Tim never\n\ndoes. If I had to [point to] something, it's that he doesn't have\n\na lefthanded jump hook. But, then, I can't think of any bigs in\n\nthe league who can do a lot of things with their opposite hand.\n\nIncluding me.\"\n\nDuncan, predictably, reacted with wide-eyed surprise when it was\n\nsuggested to him that he doesn't have a lot to work on. \"Nobody\n\nis consistent enough to stop working,\" said Duncan. \"For me,\n\nNumber 1, obviously, is my free throw shooting. Number 2 is\n\nextending my range. I'm very hesitant to shoot outside of my\n\ncomfort zone, which is about 18 feet. Some guys talked about my\n\nleft hand? Well, they're right. But I'm weird in that respect. I\n\ngo through seasons when all I do is go left and finish left, but\n\nthis year I haven't done it at all. I'm just not comfortable with\n\nit, and I've got to get back to it.\"\n\nDuncan said that from the moment he picked up a basketball in his\n\nnative St. Croix he's been--yes--fundamentally sound. \"That's\n\nwhat's always worked for me,\" he said. \"I don't think I\n\nconsciously set out to be that kind of player, but maybe I\n\nrealized right away that guys would have more athletic ability\n\nthan me.\"\n\nDuncan expects that these Finals will be a vastly different\n\nexperience for him than they were in '99, when he was named MVP\n\nafter San Antonio's five-game conquest of the New York Knicks.\n\nBack then, with a hale and hearty David Robinson at center and\n\nthat fiery preacher of a point guard named Avery Johnson running\n\nthe show, T.D. wasn't counted on to be the heart and soul of the\n\nSpurs. Now he is. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich calls him \"our\n\nJoe Montana,\" both because the offense runs through him so often\n\nand because he's the team's quiet leader. Even Duncan\n\nacknowledges, \"I know I'm the guy others will lean on.\"\n\nThere's no better reason to like the Spurs, which is why, after\n\nseven games, they will be champions again.\n\nFor the latest NBA news plus analysis from Jack McCallum, go to\n\nsi.com/basketball.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO MONTAGE: PHOTOGRAPH BY JOHN W.

MCDONOUGH (GINOBILI) [See caption above]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: JOHN W. MCDONOUGH BRING IT HOME Duncan's superior skill should enable the Spurs to win their second title.\n\nMARQUEE EVENT\n\nIn a Finals packed with role players, the outcome hinges on the\n\ntwo biggest names\n\nAn Eastern Conference scout sizes up what he calls \"one of the\n\nleast talented Finals I can remember--each team has only one\n\nsuperstar. We're down to Tim Duncan versus Jason Kidd, the best\n\nplayers in each conference, with a lot of young role players\n\nthrown in. Which of those stars proves to be more dominant will\n\ndetermine who wins the championship.\" Here are the scout's views\n\non the head-to-head matchups of the starters.\n\nRICHARD JEFFERSON, SF, Nets\n\nKidd gets him eight points a game on the fast break alone. In the\n\nhalf-court Jefferson likes to drive for the dunk or take a\n\ndribble or two and pull up. Look for Bowen, one of the most\n\nphysical defenders in the league, to crowd him. When Jefferson\n\ndrives, Bowen will back up to protect the basket, but he's quick\n\nenough to still contest the jumper.\n\nBRUCE BOWEN, SF, Spurs\n\nIf 29 teams had their choice of Jefferson or Bowen, 28 would\n\nchoose Jefferson. But who has the advantage in this series? I\n\nthink Bowen's defense will negate Jefferson, who's a big part of\n\nthe Nets' offense. And Bowen led the league in\n\nthree-point-shooting percentage, which means Jefferson won't be\n\nable to leave him to help out on Duncan.\n\nADVANTAGE: SPURS\n\nKENYON MARTIN, PF, Nets\n\nMartin has had an excellent postseason, but that's about to end.\n\nThere's no way--no way--he can guard Duncan, who can shoot over\n\nhim or punish him on the low block. I give Martin credit for\n\nwanting the challenge of covering him, but it's too much. I don't\n\nsee Martin hurting Duncan at the other end either, except when\n\nthe Nets are out on the break.\n\nTIM DUNCAN, PF, Spurs\n\nPeople are right to talk about how much Kidd helps his teammates,\n\nbut you can say the same about Duncan. When he's doubled or\n\ntripled, he makes the smart pass for an open jumper. That's given\n\nthe other Spurs a lot of confidence and has allowed the team to\n\nbe better than the sum of its parts. Whether he's at the four or\n\nthe five, he's the focus of everything they do.\n\nADVANTAGE: SPURS\n\nJASON COLLINS, C, Nets\n\nCollins is the Nets' fifth option; if he gives them six to 10\n\npoints, that's a huge lift. Yet the Spurs have to keep an eye on\n\nhim because he can hit the jumper from the elbow and he's so\n\nactive on the boards. He's been effective on the offensive glass\n\nbecause he's much bigger than the centers in the East--but he\n\nwon't be able to rebound over Robinson.\n\nDAVID ROBINSON, C, Spurs\n\nAt 37 he isn't very active. How effective he is has a lot less to\n\ndo with his opponent than with how much energy he has in his\n\nlegs, so having almost a week off before the Finals should help\n\nhim. If he scores on a put-back or two early on, that could mean\n\nhe has enough in the tank for a 14-to 20-point game. Otherwise,\n\nit'll be one of those nights he looks his age.\n\nADVANTAGE: NONE\n\nKERRY KITTLES, SG, Nets\n\nHe's the Nets' best outside shooter, the main guy you have to\n\npick up in transition because he can kill you with spot-up\n\nthrees. In every game there's a short stretch when they run him\n\noff screens to establish his jump shot and force the defense to\n\npay attention to him. That gives them balance, stretches out the\n\ndefense and helps open things up.\n\nSTEPHEN JACKSON, SG, Spurs\n\nThe Nets didn't re-sign Jackson in 2001, and I imagine he'll be\n\njuiced up to play against them. The biggest difference in his\n\ngame since he's come to the Spurs is that he's improved his shot\n\nand can knock down the three. Then, when you go out to guard him,\n\nhe can get by you. On defense Jackson can be exploited off the\n\ndribble or in the low post.\n\nADVANTAGE: NETS\n\nJASON KIDD, PG, Nets\n\nThe only way the Nets have a chance is if Kidd dominates Parker\n\nand gets in his head so that his decision making suffers. And\n\nKidd can dominate in all sorts of ways--by making steals, by\n\nhitting the key shots. Kidd isn't a great shooter, but when he's\n\nhitting he becomes almost unstoppable. I'm sure they'll take\n\nadvantage of his size and post him up on Parker.\n\nTONY PARKER, PG, Spurs\n\nEven though Parker is only 21, he's a tough guy. Early on in\n\ntheir first-round series against Phoenix, it looked as if Stephon\n\nMarbury was going to manhandle him, but Parker recovered and got\n\nthe upper hand. Kidd will lay off him to cut off the passing\n\nlanes, especially on entry passes to Duncan, so Parker has to\n\nkeep his turnovers down--and hit his jumper.\n\nADVANTAGE: NETS\n\nThe Better BENCH MARK?\n\nThe well-stocked Spurs will come at the Nets in waves\n\nThe Nets' reserve corps has one thing the Spurs' does not--a\n\ngenuine folk hero in the 6'9\" person of Brian (Veal) Scalabrine,\n\nwhose infrequent entrances usually produce an ovation from the\n\nhome crowd. Otherwise, the New Jersey bench, which may offer as\n\nfew as three real contributors during the Finals, pales in\n\ncomparison with San Antonio's.\n\nThe X factor for the Nets is Lucious Harris, a streak-shooting\n\nguard who defends tenaciously and, most important, brings a\n\nwarrior mentality. But his opposite number, the Spurs' 6'6\"\n\nrookie Manu Ginobili, is as feisty as Harris and a better player.\n\nCoach Gregg Popovich still frets about Ginobili's penchant for\n\nforcing shots and passes, but his energy and athleticism will be\n\nneeded to a) stymie the Nets' transition game; b) give backcourt\n\nstarters Tony Parker and Stephen Jackson and small forward Bruce\n\nBowen a break from guarding Jason Kidd; and c) create half-court\n\nactivity when Duncan is multiteamed.\n\nNew Jersey's Rodney Rogers can launch three-point shots better\n\nthan just about any broad-shouldered power forward in recent\n\nmemory. But undersized Malik Rose, San Antonio's top frontcourt\n\nreserve, more than counters Rogers's outside game with his\n\naggressive post-up moves and his offensive rebounding. The Spurs\n\ndon't have a perfect answer for 6'9\" Aaron Williams, a quiet and\n\nundervalued frontcourtman who chases every loose ball, rebounds\n\ndiligently and hits the midrange jumper if teams slough off him.\n\nBut look for 40-year-old Kevin Willis, one of several Spurs\n\ngraybeards, to collect some hard fouls and toss a few elbows in\n\nwhat will probably be his final shot at a championship.\n\nThe Nets have counted on one other bench player for brief\n\nstretches--Anthony Johnson, the backup point guard who sometimes\n\ngets New Jersey out of its offense by launching ill-advised\n\njumpers. San Antonio, on the other hand, has a steady backup\n\nbackup at that position in 37-year-old Steve Kerr, who dashed\n\ninto a phone booth, slipped into a cape and three-point-bombed\n\nthe Mavericks out of Game 6 of the Western finals. Popovich says\n\nhe has no plans to give Kerr significant minutes against New\n\nJersey, but here's betting that he changes his mind. Speedy\n\nClaxton, Parker's principal backup at point guard, will also be\n\nneeded: He's a transition player, and this could be a transition\n\nseries.\n\nThe most interesting bench question for the Nets is whether they\n\nwill hire a crane to hoist up the creaky 36-year-old body of\n\nDikembe Mutombo, a four-time defensive player of the year who was\n\nsidelined most of the season with a torn ligament in his right\n\nwrist and has been little more than a 7'2\" ornament on the New\n\nJersey bench during the playoffs. \"The Nets have to be tempted to\n\nuse Mutombo to harass Duncan,\" said one NBA scout, \"but he's too\n\nmuch of a liability on offense unless they think they can play in\n\nthe half-court with four guys.\" Against a team as complete as the\n\nSpurs, that wouldn't be a good idea. --J.M."
