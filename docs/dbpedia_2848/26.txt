Art in Transit: “Leaves” by Jason Lim

The artwork draws inspiration from the biological structure of bamboo leaves. Looking through the microscope, the dense cell networks of leaves are a conceptual metaphor for the intricate networks of businesses around the station. The blending hues of green illustrate the vibrancy of the area above. Encountered up close, the mosaic resembles the microscopic view of the biological structure of the bamboo leaves while revealing blades of leaves directing commuter flows when viewed from afar.
