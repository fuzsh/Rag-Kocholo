And best of all, you can even catch the sun setting behind the city, creating the perfect postcard photo of Singapore.\n\nHow to get there\n\nN1° 17' 19.1904\"E103° 52' 07.284\"\n\nBay East is located opposite the Gardens by the Bay, over the stretch of water known as Marina Bay. The only way there is by foot or bicycle as there are neither roads nor MRT stations in the direct vicinity. Best be prepared for a long, but scenic, walk along the bay area. By MRT: - Closest MRT Station: Bayfront (Circle Line) - Take exit C or D out and head towards The Shoppes@Marina Bay Sands and walk towards the Helix Bridge. - Facing the Helix Bridge, turn right and head down the stairs. - Follow the path along the river and keep walking straight. You’ll find yourself in the Gardens by the Bay. Keep following the path, walking past the Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest and Satay by the Bay. - Here, follow the path until you arrive at the Marina Barrage. Head through the sheltered area and turn left. - Walk across the barrage – the dam separating Marina Bay from the sea – and you’ll find yourself at the outskirts of Bay East. - Keep following the path along the water’s edge. As you walk, you’ll notice the skyline fanning out across the water. - Once you have arrived close to the GPS location, look for one of the many gaps in the bushes and walk down the breakwater to get close to the edge of the bay."
