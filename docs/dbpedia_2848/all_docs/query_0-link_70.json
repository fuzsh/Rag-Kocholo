        "text": "The HS/SS gives protection to residents against weapon effects such as blast and fragments during a wartime emergency. It has the advantage of being easily accessible when needed and requires minimal maintenance.\n\nThe HS/SS has its walls, floor and ceiling strengthened with increased thickness. Each shelter compartment is designed with two ventilation sleeve openings and a light protective steel door approved by SCDF. Each HS/SS door has a notice fixed to its interior face, which identifies the structure as a HS/SS and states clearly the prohibited works within it. The owner or occupier is not allowed to tamper with the HS/SS door, structural walls, and the floor and ceiling slabs. The owner or occupier must also maintain the HS/SS in accordance with the regulations, such as ensuring the HS/SS door and ventilation sleeves are able to operate smoothly, free of rust etc."
