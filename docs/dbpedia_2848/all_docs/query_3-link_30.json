        "text": "The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system is efficient, eco-friendly, and the cheapest way to almost every destination in Singapore.\n\nCheck out all current/future MRT & LRT lines of Singapore, maps & stations, and the best apps to download to travel efficiently and cheaply around the city.\n\nAs of January 2020, the MRT network encompasses 203 kilometers of route on standard gauge, with 122 stations in operation, spread across six lines set in a circle-radial topology and with an average daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019.\n\nThe network is expected to double to a total length of almost 400 kilometers by 2040 as a result of ongoing expansion works to its six existing lines and the construction of three new lines.\n\nThe network is complemented by a small number of local Light Rail Transit (LRT) networks in the suburban towns of Bukit Panjang, Sengkang, and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates, bringing the combined length of the domestic heavy and light rail network to 231.6 kilometers, with a total of 159 stations in operation.\n\nThe Circle MRT Line (CCL) runs a currently incomplete loop from Dhoby Ghaut station in the city area of Singapore to HarbourFront station in the south via Bishan station in Central Singapore.\n\nIt also has a branch to Marina Bay station from Promenade station, which will be extended to Harbourfront station in the future to form a complete loop. Coloured orange on the rail map, the fully-underground line is 35.5 kilometres long with 30 stations. Travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about an hour.\n\nCC1 | NS24 | NE6 Dhoby Ghaut\n\nCC2 Bras Basah\n\nCC3 Esplanade\n\nCC4 | DT15 Promenade\n\nCC5 Nicoll Highway\n\nCC6 Stadium\n\nCC7 Mountbatten\n\nCC8 Dakota\n\nCC9 | EW8 Paya Lebar\n\nCC10 | DT26 MacPherson\n\nCC11 Tai Seng\n\nCC12 Bartley\n\nCC13 | NE12 Serangoon\n\nCC14 Lorong Chuan\n\nCC15 | NS17 Bishan\n\nCC16 Marymount\n\nCC17 | TE9 Caldecott\n\nCC18 Bukit Brown\n\nCC19 DT9 Botanic Gardens\n\nCC20 Farrer Road\n\nCC21 Holland Village\n\nCC22 | EW21 Buona Vista\n\nCC23 one-north\n\nCC24 Kent Ridge\n\nCC25 Haw Par Villa\n\nCC26 Pasir Panjang\n\nCC27 Labrador Park\n\nCC28 Telok Blangah\n\nCC29 NE1 HarbourFront\n\nThe Cross Island Line (CRL) is currently under planning and will be the eighth MRT line when built. The line will be colored lime on the rail map.\n\nWhen completed, the line will begin in Changi, passing through Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Timah, Clementi, West Coast before terminating at Jurong Industrial Estate. The eastern leg of the line includes a segment that branches out from Pasir Ris and extends into Punggol.\n\nNames stated are working names, except for current operational stations.\n\nCR2 Aviation Park\n\nCR3 Loyang\n\nCR4 Pasir Ris East\n\nCR5 | EW1 | CP1 Pasir Ris\n\nCR6 Tampines North\n\nCR7 Defu\n\nCR8 | NE14 Hougang\n\nCR9 Serangoon North\n\nCR10 Tavistock\n\nCR11 NS16 Ang Mo Kio\n\nCR12 Teck Ghee\n\nCR13 | TE7 Bright Hill\n\nCP1 | EW1 | CR5 Pasir Ris\n\nCP2 Elias\n\nPE4 = CP3 Riviera\n\nCP4 NE17 PTC Punggol\n\nThe Downtown Line (DTL) currently runs from Bukit Panjang station in the north-west to Expo station in the east via the Central Area.\n\nColoured blue on the rail map, the line serves 34 stations, all of which are underground. The DTL is the fifth MRT line on the network to be opened and the third line to be entirely underground.\n\nThe line is set to be further extended in the near future. An extension of the line to Sungei Bedok, is under construction and is scheduled to begin operations in 2024, while a new infill station, Hume station, is planned to open in 2025.\n\nAn extension to connect with the North-South line at Sungei Kadut station is also being planned and set to open in the 2030s. When fully completed in 2024, the line will be about 44 kilometres long with 36 stations and will serve more than half a million commuters daily.\n\nDT– NS6 Sungei Kadut\n\nT1 = BP6 Bukit Panjang\n\nDT2 Cashew\n\nDT3 Hillview\n\nDT4 Hume\n\nDT5 Beauty World\n\nDT6 King Albert Park\n\nDT7 Sixth Avenue\n\nDT8 Tan Kah Kee\n\nDT9 | CC19 Botanic Gardens\n\nDT10 | TE11 Stevens\n\nDT11 = NS21 Newton\n\nDT12 | NE7 Little India\n\nDT13 Rochor\n\nDT14 | EW12 Bugis\n\nDT15 | CC4 Promenade\n\nDT16 | CE1 Bayfront\n\nDT17 Downtown\n\nDT18 Telok Ayer\n\nDT19 | NE4 Chinatown\n\nDT20 Fort Canning\n\nDT21 Bencoolen\n\nDT22 Jalan Besar\n\nDT23 Bendemeer\n\nDT24 Geylang Bahru\n\nDT25 Mattar\n\nDT26 | CC10 MacPherson\n\nDT27 Ubi\n\nDT28 Kaki Bukit\n\nDT29 Bedok North\n\nDT30 Bedok Reservoir\n\nDT31 Tampines West\n\nDT32 | EW2 Tampines\n\nDT33 Tampines East\n\nDT34 Upper Changi\n\nDT35 | CG1 Expo\n\nDT36 | Xilin\n\nDT37 | TE31 Sungei Bedok\n\nThe East West Line (EWL) is running from Pasir Ris station in the east to Tuas Link station in the west, with an additional branch between Changi Airport and Tanah Merah stations.\n\nIt is the second Mass Rapid Transit line to be built in Singapore. The 57.2 kilometres line is the longest on the MRT network, with 35 stations, 8 of which (from Lavender to Tiong Bahru and Changi Airport stations) are underground.

The line is coloured turquoise on the rail map.\n\nThe Jurong Region Line is the first MRT line to be built fully elevated with no underground or ground level sections.\n\nJS1 | NS4 | BP1 Choa Chu Kang\n\nJS2 Choa Chu Kang West\n\nJS3 Tengah\n\nJS4 Hong Kah\n\nJS5 Corporation\n\nJS6 Jurong West\n\nJS7 Bahar Junction\n\nJS8 EW27 Boon Lay\n\nJW1 Gek Poh\n\nJW2 Tawas\n\nJE1 Tengah Plantation\n\nJE2 Tengah Park\n\nJE3 Bukit Batok West\n\nJE4 Toh Guan\n\nJE5 | NS1 | EW24 Jurong East\n\nJE6 Jurong Town Hall\n\nJE7 Pandan Reservoir\n\nJS9 Enterprise\n\nJS10 Tukang\n\nJS11 Jurong Hill\n\nJS12 Jurong Pier\n\nJW3 Nanyang Gateway\n\nJW4 Nanyang Crescent\n\nJW5 Peng Kang Hill\n\nThe North East Line (NEL) is the shortest MRT line in Singapore. It is a high-capacity line and runs from HarbourFront in the south-west to Punggolin the north-east.\n\nIt is currently 19.2 kilometres long with 16 stations and a full journey from one end to the other takes 33 minutes. The line is coloured purple on the rail map.\n\nIt is the first MRT line in the network to use fully automated and driverless trains and is also the world’s first fully underground and high-capacity driverless rapid transit line to use conventional steel-wheel technology.\n\nThe North East Line is also the first line to feature Art in Transit across all 16 stations and full Wireless@SG coverage in all 16 stations. It is also the first MRT line to run entirely underground.\n\nCurrently under construction is the North East line extension, a 2-kilometre extension of the line from Punggol through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown which will open in 2023. The single station extension will span 1.6 kilometres and will serve the future Punggol North area, along with the planned “creative cluster and learning corridor” in Punggol.\n\nNE1 | CC29 HarbourFront\n\nNE3 | EW16 | TE17 Outram Park\n\nNE4 DT19 Chinatown\n\nNE5 Clarke Quay\n\nNE6 | NS24 | CC1 Dhoby Ghaut\n\nNE7 | DT12 Little India\n\nNE8 Farrer Park\n\nNE9 Boon Keng\n\nNE10 Potong Pasir\n\nNE11 Woodleigh\n\nNE12 | CC13 Serangoon\n\nNE13 Kovan\n\nNE14 | CR8 Hougang\n\nNE15 Buangkok\n\nNE16 | STC Sengkang\n\nNE17 | PTC | CP4 Punggol\n\nNE18 Punggol Coast\n\nThe North South Line (NSL) is coloured red on the rail map, is 45 kilometres long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the Bishan and Marina South Pier stations, are underground.\n\nIt runs from Jurong East station, located in western Singapore, to Marina South Pier station in the Central Area, via Woodlands station in northern Singapore. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with headways of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours.\n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from Yio Chu Kang station to Toa Payoh station beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to Raffles Place station on 12 December the same year and northwards to Yishun station on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to Marina Bay station on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the East West line. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the Branch line via Woodlands through the Woodlands line extension.\n\nTwo more infill stations (Brickland and Sungei Kadut stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\nNS1 | EW24 | JE5 Jurong East\n\nNS2 Bukit Batok\n\nNS3 Bukit Gombak\n\nNS3A Brickland\n\nNS4 | BP1 | JS1 Choa Chu Kang\n\nNS5 Yew Tee\n\nNS6 | DT– Sungei Kadut\n\nNS7 Kranji\n\nNS8 Marsiling\n\nNS9 | TE2 Woodlands\n\nNS10 Admiralty\n\nNS11 Sembawang\n\nNS12 Canberra\n\nNS13 Yishun\n\nNS14 Khatib\n\nNS15 Yio Chu Kang\n\nNS16 | CR11 Ang Mo Kio\n\nNS17 | CC15 Bishan\n\nNS18 Braddell\n\nNS19 Toa Payoh\n\nNS20 Novena\n\nNS21 = DT11 Newton\n\nNS22 | TE14 Orchard\n\nNS23 Somerset\n\nNS24 | NE6 | CC1 Dhoby Ghaut\n\nNS25 | EW13 City Hall\n\nNS26 | EW14 Raffles Place\n\nNS27 | CE2 | TE20 Marina Bay\n\nNS28 Marina South Pier\n\nThe Thomson–East Coast Line (TEL) is coloured brown on the rail map, it is fully underground serving 32 stations over 43 kilometres in length, and will be among the world’s longest driverless rapid transit lines.\n\nIt will run along a combined north-south and east-west corridor, starting in the north at Woodlands town, passing through Upper Thomson and the towns of Ang Mo Kio and Bishan, before heading south to Orchard and Marina Bay, then running eastwards along the east coast through Kallang, Marine Parade and Bedok South, before ending at Upper East Coast.\n\nThomson–East Coast Line will be extended to Changi Airport Terminal 5, which will start construction in 2020, and Changi Airport.The stretch of rail network between Tanah Merah and Changi Airport on the East West line will be converted to form part of the extension. The extension is expected to begin construction after 2022, with train services commencing by 2040.\n\nTE1 RTS Woodlands North\n\nTE2 NS9 Woodlands\n\nTE3 Woodlands South\n\nTE4 Springleaf\n\nTE5 Lentor\n\nTE6 Mayflower\n\nTE7 | CR13 Bright Hill\n\nTE8 Upper Thomson\n\nTE9 | CC17 Caldecott\n\nTE10 Mount Pleasant\n\nTE11 | DT10 Stevens\n\nTE12 Napier\n\nTE13 Orchard Boulevard\n\nTE14 | NS22 Orchard\n\nTE15 Great World\n\nTE16 Havelock\n\nTE17 | EW16 | NE3 Outram Park\n\nTE18 Maxwell\n\nTE19 Shenton Way\n\nTE20 | NS27 | CE2 Marina Bay\n\nTE21 Marina South\n\nTE22 Gardens by the Bay\n\nTE22A Founders’ Memorial[26]\n\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu\n\nTE24 Katong Park\n\nTE25 Tanjong Katong\n\nTE26 Marine Parade\n\nTE27 Marine Terrace\n\nTE28 Siglap\n\nTE29 Bayshore\n\nTE30 Bedok South\n\nTE31 | DT37 Sungei Bedok\n\nTE32 | CR1 Changi Airport Terminal 5\n\nCG2 | TE33 (from 2040) Changi Airport\n\nCG1 | DT35 | TE34 | DT35 (from 2040) Expo\n\nCG | EW4 | TE35 | EW4 (from 2040) Tanah Merah\n\nThe Bukit Panjang LRT Line (BPLRT) is 7.6-kilometre and serves 13 stations in the neighbourhood of Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang.\n\nThere are two services on the line: A and B terminate at Choa Chu Kang.\n\nCurrently Operational\n\nA: Choa Chu Kang – Senja\n\nSenja to Petir | Clockwise direction Operates during peak hours (Weekdays) only\n\nB: Choa Chu Kang – Petir\n\nPetir to Senja | Anti-clockwise direction\n\nBP1 | NS4 | JS1 Choa Chu Kang\n\nBP2 South View\n\nBP3 Keat Hong\n\nBP4 Teck Whye\n\nBP5 Phoenix\n\nBP6 | DT1 Bukit Panjang\n\nBP7 Petir\n\nBP8 Pending\n\nBP9 Bangkit\n\nBP10 Fajar\n\nBP11 Segar\n\nBP12 Jelapang\n\nBP13 Senja\n\nThe Punggol LRT Line connects the residential districts and suburbs of Punggol to Punggol Town Centre, where it connects with the North East MRT line and the Punggol Bus Interchange.\n\nThe first phase is a 10.3-kilometre line with 15 stations in two loops.\n\nThere are four services in total, with two services on each loop.\n\nA: Punggol – Soo Teck | West Loop\n\nSoo Teck to Sam Kee, clockwise direction\n\nB: Punggol – Cove | East Loop\n\nCove to Damai, anti-clockwise direction\n\nC: Punggol – Damai | East Loop\n\nDamai to Cove, clockwise direction\n\nD: Punggol – Sam Kee | West Loop\n\nSam Kee to Soo Teck, anti-clockwise direction\n\nPTC | NE17 | CP4 Punggol\n\nEAST LOOP\n\nPE1 Cove\n\nPE2 Meridian\n\nPE3 Coral Edge\n\nPE4 = CP3 Riviera\n\nPE5 Kadaloor\n\nPE6 Oasis\n\nPE7 Damai\n\nWEST LOOP\n\nPW1 Sam Kee\n\nPW2 Teck Lee (Not in operation)\n\nPW3 Punggol Point\n\nPW4 Samudera\n\nPW5 Nibong\n\nPW6 Sumang\n\nPW7 Soo Teck\n\nThe Sengkang LRT Line connects the residential districts and suburbs of Sengkang to Sengkang Town Centre, where it connects with the North East MRT line, Sengkang Bus Interchange, Compass One and Compassvale Bus Interchange.\n\nIt is the second line of the LRT system in Singapore and is 10.7-kilometre long\n\nThere are four services in total, with two on each loop.\n\nA: Sengkang – Renjong | West Loop\n\nRenjong to Cheng Lim, clockwise direction\n\nB: Sengkang – Cheng Lim | West Loop\n\nCheng Lim to Renjong, anti-clockwise direction\n\nC: Sengkang – Compassvale | East Loop\n\nCompassvale to Ranggung, clockwise direction\n\nD: Sengkang – Ranggung | East Loop\n\nRanggung to Compassvale, anti-clockwise direction\n\nSTC | NE16 Sengkang\n\nEAST LOOP\n\nSE1 Compassvale\n\nSE2 Rumbia\n\nSE3 Bakau\n\nSE4 Kangkar\n\nSE5 Ranggung\n\nWEST LOOP\n\nSW1 Cheng Lim\n\nSW2 Farmway\n\nSW3 Kupang\n\nSW4 Thanggam\n\nSW5 Fernvale\n\nSW6 Layar\n\nSW7 Tongkang\n\nSW8 Renjong\n\nCitymapper – Transit Navigation\n\nCitymapper is the ultimate transit app, making cities easier to use!\n\nCheck nearby departures in real-time\n\nFind the fastest route combining bus, subway, train, ferry, taxi, car share, bike share, and walk\n\nFollow the step by step directions, including the best subway exit to reach the platform\n\nReceive alerts when your favorite lines are disrupted\n\nApp Store | Google Play\n\nExplore Singapore MRT Map\n\nSingapore’s best MRT and LRT map!
