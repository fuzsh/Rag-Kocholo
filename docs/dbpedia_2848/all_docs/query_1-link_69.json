The portions from which these tangent lines are drawn\n\nTo accomplish this, the tangent line to the graph was found and the slope of the line was calculated, which was the average rate of reaction. The independent variable with the fastest average rate of reaction would be determined as the optimal concentration of 〖\"NaHCO\" 〗_\"3 \" for usage in the cleaning of tarnished sterling silver. The average rates of reaction are displayed in Table 2 below. The tangent lines (as shown by the dashed black lines) as well as the lines of best fit for each trial are\n\nhow Singaporeans have reacted towards the fare hike and also whether the increase in public transports fares is justifiable.

It is no wonder that Singapore emerged\n\nCHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background of Study Coordinate systems form a common frame of reference for description of positions and on the other hand, coordinates are simply an ordered set of numbers that are used to describe the positions or features in coordinate system. Transformation parameters are required to move from one system to another. Also, new technologies like global positioning system have provide new methods of coordinates determination the map production, update"
