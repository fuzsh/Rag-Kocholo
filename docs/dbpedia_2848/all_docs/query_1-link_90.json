It can be easily access via the overhead bridge (Lions Bridge) located at Marina Bay Sands Hotel or the underground linkway via Bayfront MRT Station. The specific spot I took this photograph was the southernmost part of the Supertree Grove area. Find the Supertree Dining area and walk along the path until you see the window aquarium called “Arowana Acquarium.” You’ll see a small lane leading back into the Supertree Grove area, and in the middle of that lane is where I snapped this photograph! By MRT: - Closest MRT Station: Bayfront (Downtown Line and Circle Line) - Take exit “B” underground linkway towards Gardens by the Bay - Look for Supertree Grove signs"
