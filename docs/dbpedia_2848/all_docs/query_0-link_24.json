        "text": "The Land Transport Authority marked the completion of tunnelling works for Circle Line 6 (CCL6) with a final tunnel breakthrough from Prince Edward Road station into Cantonment station today.\n\n2. Tunnelling works for CCL6, which consists of three new stations â Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward Road â started in August 2019. Three tunnel boring machines (TBMs) were used to construct the three stretches of twin tunnels linking the new stations to the rest of the Circle Line. The first stretch of tunnelling works from Keppel station towards HarbourFront station was completed in August 2020. The TBMs were then re-launched to mine between Keppel and Cantonment stations. Works for this leg were completed in July 2021.\n\n3. The final stretch of works, which includes the boring of 2-kilometre-long twin tunnels from Prince Edward Road station to Cantonment station, was completed today, marking the completion of CCL6 tunnelling works. With this, the progress for CCL6âs civil construction works is about 55 per cent complete.\n\n4. Moving forward, works will commence to build the structural connections between the bored tunnels and stations. This will be carried out in tandem with the rest of the structural works for the three new underground stations for CCL6.\n\n5. Separately, structural works for the underground Kim Chuan Depot extension are also progressing well. The expanded depot will have increased capacity to house new Circle Line trains.\n\n6. Upon the completion of the basic civil structural works, the installation of track-related equipment as well as electrical and mechanical services and systems will commence, followed by systems testing and commissioning.\n\n7. The CCL6 is on track to open in 2026, closing the Circle Line loop by connecting HarbourFront to Marina Bay stations. This will provide commuters in Telok Blangah a more direct, faster and more convenient route to the Marina Bay area, cutting travelling time by up to 10 minutes. Commuters travelling from Paya Lebar and Mountbatten will enjoy faster access to the retail and office centres in the HarbourFront area, and those in the west such as Pasir Panjang and Kent Ridge can also have a direct route to the Central Business District.\n\nOvercoming Tunnelling Challenges"
