        "text": "Order received for subway construction work in Singapore\n\nPenta-Ocean Construction Co., Ltd. (President Yoshio Murashige) has received an order from the Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA) for the construction of the Woodlands North Station, the northernmost station on the Thomson Line of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) System (subway and elevated railway), and surrounding tunneling works (T202 region).\n\nThe amount of the order received is 26.8 billion yen and the construction is scheduled to be completed in 69 months by Sep 2019. The Company has also received an order for the construction of the Bendemeer Station and surrounding tunneling works (C933 region) on the Downtown Line in 2011. This is the fifth order received following orders received for the HarbourFront Station Building on the Circle Line and the Expo Station Building on the East-West Line and so on.\n\nThe Thomson Line is scheduled to be an underground subway about 30 km long linking 22 stations from the Woodlands area in the north of Singapore to the Marina Bay area in the south. Tenders for construction works in 25 sub-divided areas have been called for sequentially since the beginning of 2013. The Singapore Government has announced plans to expand the overall length of the MRT subways to 360 km or twice the current length. Eventually, about 80% of all households are expected to stay within a 10 minutes walking radius of the nearest MRT station with about 400,000 people using the subway system every day.\n\nBesides the MRT works ordered by LTA, the Company is currently involved in two other tunneling projects in the country and has also received an order for tunneling works between Jurong and Pioneer this year. The Company is involved in the tunneling works for the \"Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High Speed Railway Construction Project\" by the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation Ltd as well. The current order was received in recognition of the Company's advanced technical capabilities, including its track record in Japan.\n\nSince establishing its sales office in Singapore in 1965, the Company has participated in numerous large-scale projects in Singapore. Going forward, it is expected to continue with other infrastructure projects such as energy-related facilities, roads, railways, harbour construction and so on. The Company considers Singapore to be one of the key markets for its overseas business and will continue to proactively expand the business while keeping an eye on the bottom line."
