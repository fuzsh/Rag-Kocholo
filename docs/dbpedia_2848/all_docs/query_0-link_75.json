        "text": "SINGAPORE: From a mere five stations in 1987 to eight lines by 2030, Singapore’s rail network will eventually make travel times shorter and more convenient for most people.\n\nConstruction of the Cross Island Line began on Wednesday (Jan 18) and Phase 1, with 12 stations, is expected to be completed by 2030. There will eventually be at least 30 stations.\n\nOnce fully operational, about eight in 10 households are expected to be within a 10-minute walk of a train station, Transport Minister S Iswaran said.\n\nCNA looks at how Singapore’s MRT network has evolved through the years.\n\nNORTH-SOUTH LINE\n\nThe North-South Line (NSL) was Singapore’s first MRT line, opening in 1987 with only five stations connecting Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh.\n\nToday, it spans 45km and has 27 stations to serve commuters travelling between Jurong East to Marina South Pier. It also includes eight interchanges, allowing travellers to transfer to the East-West Line, the Circle Line, the Downtown Line, the North East Line and the Bukit Panjang LRT.\n\nIn recent years, additional stations were added: Marina South Pier in 2014 and Canberra – located between the existing Yishun and Sembawang stations – in 2019.\n\nIt may be Singapore’s oldest train line, but it remains an integral part of the country’s rail system and is currently undergoing upgrading works to ensure that it keeps up with travel demands.\n\nSince the renewal works started in 2012, three out of the line’s six core systems have been replaced: The signalling system, sleepers and third rail. Track circuit replacements are also about 93 per cent complete.\n\nThe bustling Jurong East MRT station was also retrofitted with two new platforms in 2012, allowing two trains to enter and depart the station at the same time.\n\nMost of the core system replacements are expected to be completed by this year, according to Mr Iswaran.\n\nEAST-WEST LINE\n\nOriginally a part of the NSL, the East-West Line (EWL) is currently Singapore’s longest at about 57km.\n\nIt will take you across the island, spanning 35 stations and nine interchanges from Tuas West to Changi Airport.\n\nStudents may be familiar with Clementi or Dover stations, which serve nearby polytechnics and universities. The line also serves those working in the central business district, including Raffles Place, City Hall and Outram Park.\n\nDid you know that Dover MRT station was the first one to be constructed while the train line was in operation? It is also the first station to have two platforms alongside a central rail line.\n\nLike the NSL, the EWL is also undergoing a renewal of its core systems, which is set to be completed this year.\n\nCROSS ISLAND LINE\n\nWith Phase 1 set to open in 2030, the Cross Island Line (CRL) will be Singapore’s eighth and longest fully underground train line at more than 50km long.\n\nThe line is key to Singapore attaining its target of having nine in 10 peak-period “Walk Cycle Ride” journeys completed in less than 45 minutes, said Mr Iswaran.\n\nDaily ridership for the Cross Island Line is expected to hit 600,000 when it opens for service in 2030, with that number eventually increasing to more than 1 million. It will take commuters through major hubs like the Jurong Lake District, Punggol Digital District and the Changi region, with more than 30 stations planned.\n\nTravelling between train lines? The CRL will have the highest number of interchange stations in Singapore, with more than half connected to existing rail stations once operational.\n\nRecreational spaces like Changi Beach Park or Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park will also become accessible by public transport, which means family outings and daily exercise routines will be more convenient.\n\nThe NEL was also the first to take accessibility into account, featuring the most number of lifts at its stations at the time and the first to incorporate art into its stations.\n\nAs the line serves growing neighbourhoods, many of its stations were designed to allow for future expansions to cater to the growing population.\n\nFor example, when Sengkang LRT line first opened in 2003, surrounding developments were not yet built. With future connections in mind, the line's stations were built with a simple layout to allow commuters to navigate their way easily.\n\nCIRCLE LINE\n\nDespite the name, the Circle Line (CCL) is not yet a full circle.\n\nLike the NEL, the 30-station CCL is completely automated and driverless. It was also Singapore’s first medium-capacity line, linking the existing NSL, EWL and NEL to the city.\n\nAccording to the Land Transport Authority, it required “innovations in design, engineering and construction” to build.\n\nBuilders faced challenges such as varying soil conditions, which posed safety and structural issues at Promenade and Nicoll Highway stations, and having to tunnel through a maze of existing tunnels and cables.\n\nBras Basah Station is home to the longest escalator in the MRT system, stretching 41m from the ticket concourse to the transfer level.\n\nIn 2026, the CCL will become a full circle, with the opening of a 4km extension that includes three stations connecting HarbourFront to Marina Bay.\n\nCommuters will enjoy a direct route between areas in the west - such as Pasir Panjang and Kent Ridge - and the Central Business District. Those living in Paya Lebar and Mountbatten will also get faster access to the HarbourFront area.\n\nDOWNTOWN LINE\n\nMeasuring 42km and covering 36 stations, the Downtown Line (DTL) is Singapore’s longest underground and driverless MRT line.\n\nIt serves residential areas in Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, MacPherson and Bedok Reservoir, which were previously not covered by the MRT system."
