The station will also serve upcoming residential and recreational developments in the area.\n\nAn existing facilities building currently under construction will be converted to create the new station. The contract to construct the building was awarded to China Railway First Group in June 2016 for approximately S$242.4m (£140m).\n\nWork will start this year and the station will open at the same time as the Founders’ Memorial."
