        "text": "Whenever I get a bit of a break, I like to look through my stash of holiday photos I’ve not yet posted and reflect a little bit about the experiences I had while I’m overseas. After all, I’m due for another holiday soon … so I guess I must put in a little more effort in getting these posts out in a timely manner.\n\nIn this post, I’ll be talking about transport in Singapore. I visited Singapore in July to August of 2017 for about a week, just wandering around and absorbing the sights. In the past, I made a concerted effort to document the public transport systems, but in Singapore, I felt a little less inclined. Part of the reason is the rather clean and sterile culture, which at the time, seemed to focus on being a good citizen which included not taking random photos especially including strangers. At the time, there were campaigns about not filming fights and spreading videos over social media amongst other things. As a result, I took a more reserved approach, so this posting will have a mix of transport content instead.\n\nLooking back at my GPS track logs (which can’t track underground), I can tell that I definitely covered a good amount of area by travelling on public transport and on foot. It’s clear that Singapore is a very well connected country, but it seems they’ve got plans for even more infrastructure.\n\nBy Air\n\nRegarding transport, Singapore is perhaps most important in the Asian region for its massive Changi Airport. It’s a great place to make interconnections and is a gigantic hub. It consistently wins awards, although I probably spent a lot less time in there than I should have – since I was so eager to get outside. I did catch some PA announcements when flying out – Lost Passport and Paging Passenger in Korean. Unlike some other airports I’ve been to, their PA system is pretty decent.\n\nThat’s not to say that Changi wouldn’t make an appearance in my journey. Normally, cameras and airports don’t really mix well. But bring your camera to Changi Beach Park and things don’t seem to be so bad, except for the possibility of sand getting into places where it shouldn’t … best be careful.\n\nAs a result, I plonked myself onto the sandy beach, watching as others went about their own business. I got out the telephoto lens, watching for inbound aircraft on Flightradar24 as I snapped some photos. But not before grabbing a few more pictures of interesting signs.\n\nLooks like the beach is home to a number of suspicious activities … lets hope nobody calls the cops on me!\n\nThat was an enjoyable morning of plane-spotting – quite a few carriers I’ve not seen elsewhere, but also a few familiar ones from home – like Jetstar. I’m no real plane-spotter, but I suppose when you’re on a beach next to one of the busiest airports, this comes naturally.\n\nIt was catching the bus to and from this venue that I discovered what Checkpoint Mode means for buses – the driver switches Checkpoint Mode on so that you can tap off as you are “forced off” the bus. This suspends your ride and you are left in a shelter on the side of the road as the bus enters a secure area to pick up passengers from this area (airport staff, mainly). Then, when your bus comes back after doing the loop, the readers are set into Checkpoint Mode again to resume your ride. This was a very perplexing thing to me when I read about it on the LTA’s website, but after experiencing it in person, it all makes sense.\n\nBy Bus\n\nI’ve not got much to say about buses in Singapore, except that they pretty much just work. I had one of the apps installed from one of the four bus operators, and it was a simple task of looking up the appropriate route, stop list and departure times with real-time information. Some of the more popular routes seem to operate on a frequency basis, with the drivers having a headway regulation display which shows the time difference between the bus ahead and behind so that they can prevent buses from bunching up. Pretty neat.\n\nI liked that some of the buses were double-deck to cope with demands and alleviate traffic jams to some degree, meaning that there was a good chance to do some filming – like my ride on Route 80 to Harbourfront Interchange (which was quite massive):\n\nThere are multiple operators, but as long as you have an appropriate contactless card (i.e. EZ-Link or NETS FlashPay), it’s a simple matter of tapping on and off as necessary. One does have to be careful to make sure they tap on the appropriate reader, as some are configured entry/exit, while others are exit-only. As above, if you’re near the airport, there’s also potentially checkpoint mode to worry about as well.\n\nIt’s also interesting to look at the advertising plastered on the buses – there are many instances of various public-service style announcements trying to inspire positive social change. While on the one hand, it’s a bit of a chuckle to think about how cruel some people might be, on the other to see it so explicitly called out suggests it might be an actual problem (and not a small one at that). It seems that there’s a lot of aspiration for Singapore to “be better”, which often means investment in what seems to be excellent public infrastructure (at least, to a tourist) but perhaps people are still lagging behind somewhat.\n\nBy MRT\n\nThe MRT is probably the main public transport system in use which is a mixture of above and below-ground lines and segments. When I visited in 2017, the map (adapted from the Land Transport Authority of Singapore) looked like this and I was able to travel across all the highlighted areas:\n\nAt the time of my visit, the East-West line extension to Tuas Link had completed and opened, although sometimes operating slowly because of a transition between signalling systems. Aside from that, the Downtown line extension was under construction. The Thomson East Coast line had already been planned with construction also underway. This results in a rather interesting-looking map where the Circle line isn’t exactly a circle …\n\n… but their new map definitely has a circular Circle line and a few more curves. Part of the Thomson East Coast line has also opened to the north. I found the MRT system easy to use, convenient, and relatively fast although with subtle differences between lines and teething issues with a driverless conversion of the East-West line at the time.\n\nTravelling Around\n\nMRT stations are fairly well spaced about Singapore – you’re bound to run into signs like these which point you to the nearest station. These can be above ground or underground depending on the line. The MRT lines are operated by either SMRT or SBS Transit, but commuters don’t need to worry about that too much.\n\nThe nearest station to where I stayed was Kallang, on the East West line. The above ground station looked fairly plain with an arched roof. At the time of my visit, the East West line was still undergoing conversion to driverless operation. On my first ride on the line, I experienced some anomalies, such as the doors opening and then rapidly shutting at stations, not observing the dwell time. Other times they would re-open while the internal announcements would be out of sync. Problems with overshooting were also experienced on occasion, but this seems to be a problem due to the number of different rolling stock in use on the line and their differing characteristics. On the whole, it still worked well enough with only very rare delays. The stations themselves had half-height passenger screen doors and massive fans – unfortunately, being exposed to outdoor temperatures in Singapore means that it’s normally quite hot, but the trains are ice cold, which is a plus. Air conditioning to the rescue!\n\nSome stations have rather interesting architectural features, such as this “space-ship”-looking saucer at Expo.\n\nWhile the East-West line was still undergoing conversion at the time of my visit, the North-South line was still driven manually as far as I know. The newer lines (e.g. North-East), however, were already driverless with this notice at Dhoby Gaut warning passengers about doors which close automatically. It seems driverless technology is well proven in these lines which operate mainly underground – a smooth ride for the most part.\n\nThere are some places where the age of the East-West line shows, for example, an underground station where a full-height passenger screen door from Westinghouse Brake and Signal Co. Ltd. can be seen. That’s a beautiful relic right there!\n\nIt seems that they had some incentive program based on QR codes at stations which would enable people to earn points and redeem rewards. I didn’t investigate this further, but I did hear that some people had (cleverly) taken down the QR codes at different locations and would scan photos of these codes to collect points even though they were not travelling on the MRT … so the program was somewhat curtailed. The above codes a text block with “KAL_PSD_PS36_9332” as the payload.\n\nInside the train is frosty air-conditioning that can result in some condensation forming. The route map is plastered above doors with a yellow multi-lingual sign that says to keep clear of doors. The newer trains have some LCD passenger information displays, but the older ones had a nice blue VFD display. Not a common choice of display, nor a common colour, but they were beautiful.\n\nUnlike some other operators around the world, it seems that they want to know about problems from commuters – so there’s their Snap-Rep contact to which you can report faults using WhatsApp.\n\nIn every station, there are maps for the locality and interchanges – but this one never seemed to be fitted with its transfer service list, instead showing a mock-up/sample. Not a mistake I expected to see.\n\nThere are also rules about transfers (45-minutes, not onto the same service) and total journey time (2-hours maximum). That being said, if you’re a real early-bird, apparently travelling to downtown stations before 7:45am means a free ride with a discount of 50c up to 8:00am. I never could get myself up that early though – I’m on holiday!\n\nUnder Construction\n\nI was caught-out at one point – walking around, I saw a sign towards an MRT station that wasn’t even open. That’s not a major issue though – I just walked to another one.\n\nAt the time, they had signage regarding later opening of the Downtown Line on Sundays to prepare for full opening by the end of 2017. Travel alternatives include regular route bus services and a shuttle bus service.\n\nI did manage to snap a random image of a station still under construction. This would be part of the Downtown Line.\n\nI also managed to snap an image of the hoardings around the future Napier station on the Thomson East Coast Line, due for opening around 2021.\n\nTopping Up and Tapping On\n\nI travelled with a NETS FlashPay card which can be topped up at any ticket machine. The left shows a cash top-up from a newer machine at Downtown, which has a wider receipt paper while the right shows a top-up from an overseas Visa Debit card (as credit) – it worked just fine.\n\nThe NETS FlashPay card can be used to purchase small items at certain retail outlets, similar to the Octopus card in Hong Kong. I like how the top-up receipts show the values and the station.\n\nI only ever had one issue with the GTM top-ups at Aljunied. The machine couldn’t verify the top-up on the card (even though I didn’t remove or disturb it in the process). It results in this print-out which says “value may not be added” with a message to “please approach station staff for verification.”\n\nAs it turns out, there were no issues and the top-up completed just fine.\n\nInstead of the GTMs, at some stations, there are more advanced ticket machines. I played with the TransitLink AVM+ which has the ability to e-mail you a .csv file of transaction history. Unfortunately, these machines weren’t that widespread.\n\nThe .csv shows the fine details of how the system works, down to 30-transactions depth. It seems that similar to the Opal card, a maximum charge is deducted on tapping on, with a refund processed on tapping off on a bus. Train travel is not processed the same way, with the payment deducted in a single line. Purchases at McDonalds and KFC can be seen – the service descriptor is very limited in length though.\n\nMany people have their transport card in their wallets and tap their whole wallet on the readers. Unfortunately, similarly to the Opal system, the readers don’t always select the correct card or can suffer issues with card collisions. There was a cute cartoon-style poster which mentioned this – but people still don’t seem to do it. Perhaps taking out a card is just too inconvenient for some … so they try, try and try again.\n\nSounds of the MRT\n\nI spent a lot of time riding around the MRT, hence I have a lot of recordings (some noisier than others) to share. The system sounds quite homogeneous at first, but there are some subtle differences in some sounds which give certain lines/systems away.\n\nNext Station Interchange Announcement\n\n20170727-MRT-NS-IC-OutramPark – “[5-tone chime] Next station Outram Park Interchange.

[Rapid Pips/Beeping] [Doors Close]” Note this sounds like it’s replaying a recording of the rapid pips – they sound very muffled.\n\n20170731-MRT-DC-Message-xhq – “[Ding Dong] Doors are closing. [Rapid Pips]” – this is a very clear recording.\n\n20170802-MRT-DC-DTLDual – “[Bipping] Doors closing. [Rapid Pips]”. I particularly like this sound – the rapidity of the pipping is rather comforting. Having advance notice of door closure is a good feature – more systems should probably adopt this. I believe this is from the Downtown Line.\n\nBy LRT\n\nSingapore also has three light rail transit systems (LRT) which interconnect with the MRT. These are the Bukit Panjang, Sengkang and Punggol LRT systems, denoted in grey on the route map. The systems are built with predominantly loop sections to service the areas around MRT stations.\n\nThe Bukit Pangjang system is the oldest of the three, using Bombardier Innovia APM 100 people movers. These remind me a bit of guided busways, as the carriages run on rubber tyres. The services run coupled pairs of carriages and has had some history of accidents and incidents. It feels a bit dated and is reaching its end of life. The stations themselves are interesting – involving sets of stairs which wind upwards to the elevated platform which is only protected by barriers outside of door sections – no platform screen doors here. The system operates automatically – so the lack of screen doors seems to be at odds with most automated systems I’ve seen.\n\nRiding the system, it seemed rather unusual. More used to the elevated sky rails which have barriers on the sides of the elevated running rails, the lack of barriers gave me a slight sense of vertigo and a fear that a stiff wind could blow the units off the tracks, especially when cornering some of the narrow curves. It was a bit of an experience, but the nerves quickly faded and I learned to enjoy the ride through town on elevated tracks. It’s a good view.\n\nOne of the stations on the Bukit Panjang LRT that I felt I had to visit was Ten Mile Junction (BP14). This was an odd station on a “spur”, served by an infrequent single-carriage service C. This was the LRT station famous for being integrated into a shopping mall building. Here we see the old turnstile ticket validators on the way to the platform.\n\nAs a result of this integration and the air conditioning, the station has full platform screen doors. I wasn’t aware that the depot for the system is actually along this branch, as this station closed 13th January 2019, having the distinction of being the only station to have closed on the LRT network. The station has just one platform.\n\nThe timetable at the time of my visit shows 20 minute service intervals for the most part, but with gaps in services on weekdays.\n\nThere was a door fault – either with the train or platform screen doors, resulting in this half-opening mess. Within the train, on the front window, was a route map. I suspect this particular unit was dedicated to running the Service C.\n\nI also visited the Punggol and Sengkang LRT systems, both of which use Mitsubishi Crystal Mover C810/C810A automated people movers in a two-car configuration. These systems felt a bit newer and more modern by comparison and are the same as used in the Changi Airport Skytrain, which I didn’t have a chance to ride unfortunately.\n\nThe stations are built some way above the ground, but unlike the other system, there are barriers on the sides …\n\n… this is because the third rail runs along the side of the train. This makes the system feel less vertigo inducing. The ride is relatively smooth, as this system also appears to be rubber-tyred. The platforms (at the time) were unprotected which is again unusual for an automated system. This leads to the placing of signs saying “Value Life. Act Responsibly.” I’m not sure that works …\n\nAs with any system, there are periods of track-work. As the system’s loops run in both directions, a closure normally only affects one direction meaning that it takes a little longer to catch the service the long way round. This is hardly a big inconvenience when the line lengths are only about 10km.\n\nThe system seems to be built with expansion in mind, especially if we look at Teck Lee (PW2) station which was built in advance for future development but not opened. I believe the train made a stop at the station, did not open its doors and continued onwards.\n\nSounds of the LRT\n\nThe LRT sounds part of the family, in part due to the use of a similar voice and rapid pips, but the two systems do sound different especially with the use of “dings” and “ding-dong”.\n\n20170802-LRT-DCNS-BukitPanjang – “Doors closing. Next Station Bukit Panjang.”\n\n20170802-LRT-DCNS-Senja – “Doors closing. Next Station Senja.”\n\n20170802-LRT-DCNS-TeckWhye – “Doors closing. Next Station Teck Whye.”\n\n20170802-LRT-DODCNS-Jelapang– “Senja. [Doors Open] … Doors Closing, Next Station Jelapang. [Doors Close]“\n\n20170806-LRT-AANS-Kangkar – “[Ding] Please do not lean against the doors. Next Station Kangkar.”\n\n20170806-LRT-AANS-Rangung – “[Ding] Please do not lean against the doors. Next Station Rangung.”\n\n20170806-LRT-DC-HoldHandrail – “[Ding] Doors Closing. Please stand clear of doors. [Rapid Pips] Please hold onto the handrail. Thank you.”\n\n20170806-LRT-NS-BukitPanjang – “[Ding Dong] Doors Closing. Next Station Bukit Panjang.”\n\n20170806-LRT-SA-BukitPanjang-IC – “[Ding Dong] Bukit Panjang. Passengers going to Choa Chu Kang please proceed to Platform 1.”\n\n20170806-LRT-SA-DO_DC-Kangkar – “[Ding] Kangkar. [Doors Open] … [Ding] Doors Closing. Please stand clear of doors. [Rapid Pips] Please hold onto the handrail. Thank you.”\n\nAround Sentosa\n\nEvery tourist to Singapore has probably heard about Sentosa Island. After all, it’s practically a tourist resort island (also known as a tourist trap). There wasn’t too much in for me to do at Sentosa, not being a theme-park kind of person, but I did at least get to visit Fort Siloso and take a walk through the natural areas. But getting to/from/around Sentosa is an interesting topic in itself.\n\nOne way to get to Sentosa is just to catch the Sentosa Express monorail from Harbourfront. This service runs smaller versions of the Hitachi straddle-beam monorail that was seen in South Korea.\n\nThey seem to love colouring the train sets, with the system having four stations in total, spanning a distance of 2.1km. Yes, just 2.1km. The line charges fares for travelling from the mainland to the island (~SG$4), and is otherwise free of charge.\n\nOf course, with such a short distance, one is probably inclined to walk to the island. In fact, just underneath the beam is a covered walkway which leads you to the island, with moving walkways to speed up the process. Unfortunately, walking isn’t free as an entrance fee is technically SG$1 charged at the island … but when I was there, somehow they chose not to charge the fee for whatever reason. It seems this may still be the case …\n\nIf you can walk there, you can also cycle there (SG$2). Apparently cycling to Sentosa island is still free for now as the entrance is waived … Otherwise, you can also take public buses, arrive by taxi (with surcharges of course) or … if you really have an excess of money …\n\n… you could opt to ride the cable car from Mount Faber or Harbourfront. That’s a luxury that could cost you SG$30+. Cool to see in action, but I don’t think that’s really my thing. I’m not exactly fond of heights.\n\nOne of the more interesting things from my time at Sentosa (aside from visiting Fort Siloso) was seeing this in the forested area. This green piece of metal, winding about, is the remnants of the original Sentosa Monorail – operating all the way back from 1982 to 2005 when it finally ended operation owing to declining popularity as it was slow and uncomfortable.\n\nThe other thing I visited was the Sentosa Beach Tram, except, it probably should have been called the Sentosa Beach Scam. It’s not a tram at all – it’s basically electric buggy vehicles running between stations, free of charge. I was expecting … I dunno … something with rails?\n\nAbove is some shaky video taken out of the side of one of these “trams”. I guess at least I don’t have to walk. The loop buses on the island are also quite convenient and free of charge, which is nice. But the island still feels like a tourist trap – lots of fees and “artificial” amusements.\n\nBy Other Means\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about Singapore was the proliferation of rental bicycle schemes operated by the (now defunct) ofo, mobike and others.\n\nWhen I was there, I thought this to be a brilliant idea at first until I saw the litter of bikes parked in inconsiderate locations. I also saw many that were somehow defective, seemingly left there for a long time without any real incentive to collect them.\n\nAt one point, I was tempted to give them a try, but I didn’t fancy handing over my credit card details to a company I’m not sure I trusted. I wasn’t sure how well it would work given a foreign card either, but I didn’t expect that as soon as I got home to Sydney, the same schemes would start to roll out at home as well!\n\nIt seems that they have a good set-up for private bicycle usage – this was at my nearest MRT station where they had a row of double-decker bicycle storage. Unfortunately it was quite empty …\n\nIt seemed a little complicated to use, so I’m glad they put up a sign about how to use the upper racks.\n\nSingapore is pretty easy to get around on foot as well. The pedestrian crossings are mainly push-button type – interestingly the signs say “Press For Green Man”, which oddly implies that the main use for the button is to obtain green men and not to cross the road. In Chinatown, I spotted an unusual crossing where there was a card reader – apparently, seniors and disabled people can “tap” their card to enable a longer crossing time as required. This is not something I’ve seen implemented elsewhere.\n\nOne unexpected find was this banner in Little India, featuring the classic meme-style text which illustrates one thing – they have a parking problem.\n\nWhile I was there in Singapore, ANZ had transferred its retail arm to DBS and shuttered their ATMs. That was big news I wasn’t aware of at all … not really transport related but I came across it on foot and it was a shock. I thought ANZ was doing well in Asia …\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transport in, out and around Singapore is quite amazingly convenient. It’s hard not to be jealous, but I suppose it’s easy for a geographically small country to have good public transport. But despite this, they still keep building more lines. I find it hard to explain, although it does seem some of the infrastructure is beginning to show its age.\n\nI could never match the efforts of Land Transport Guru, where I learned a lot about the Singaporean transport network including a lot of practical knowledge about things like maximum travel times and history of various MRT lines. The site is well worth a visit for transport enthusiasts.\n\nBut I guess Singapore is mostly just a good country to fly through as an interconnection hub. There really isn’t that much to see and keep yourself occupied, unless you like the “tourist trap” style attractions and shopping. One week was good enough for me, so it was onwards to my next destination, where I hoped to see things which were a bit more up my alley."
