        "text": "By LINDA JAMES | Updated June 15, 2023 | AREA GUIDES\n\nThis article may contain compensated links. Please read the disclaimer for more information.\n\nThe Marina Bay Sands resort dominates this area along with the impressive Gardens by the Bay next door. Just across the river, The Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay arts complex is worth visiting for its views as is the Singapore Flyer.\n\nThe Marina Bay project was an ambitious civil engineering plan that meant creating three massive tracts of reclaimed land to seal off the basins of the Singapore and Kallang rivers from the sea. This has resulted in a seaside freshwater reservoir that cut Singapore’s dependence on Malaysian water supplies.\n\nMarina Bay is a great place to stay if you haven’t been to Singapore before because it’s so close to the key sights. Other favourites – Chinatown and Orchard Rd – are just a short ride on the MRT.\n\nGetting There\n\nDepending on where you want to start your visit to Marina Bay, there are two main MRT stations and lines that can get you there. Bayfront (DT16) and Promenade (CC4/DT15) and Esplanade (CC3). Marina Bay MRT station (CE2/NS27) is currently under construction and is planned to open in 2026.\n\nYou could also take the following buses: 106, 131, 502, 518\n\nWhat to See & Do\n\nArtScience Museum\n\nThis lotus-shaped museum is also known as “The Welcoming Hand of Singapore”. It focuses on exploring the meeting point of art, science, culture and technology, and innovation. There’s a variety of permanent and temporary exhibitions.\n\nFuture World: Where Art meets Science, a permanent exhibition created in conjunction with art collective teamLab, features a collection of digital interactive installations. There are four sections – City in A Garden, Sanctuary, Park, and Space. One of the new exhibitions is Radical Curiosity: In the Orbit of Buckminster Fuller Journey”, which tells the story of inventor and visionary, Buckminster Fuller. He created innovations that impacted the world by working across multiple disciplines including art, science, mathematics, architecture and design.\n\nAddress: 6 Bayfront Ave Open: daily 10am–7pm Cost: general admission free, selected exhibitions at a cost eg Future World is $S16 (adult) and $S12 (child) for residents and $S19 (adult) and $S14 (child) for non-residents Getting there: near Bayfront MRT (CE1/DT16), 10 min walk; buses – 133,655,77,97,97E More information: https://www.marinabaysands.com/museum.html\n\nEsplanade – Theatres on the Bay\n\nThe striking architecture here – two large spiked shells – has been likened to durians or giant insect eyes. Just east of the Padang and Esplanade Park, the venue has a concert hall that seats about 1600, theatres (one of which seats 2000) and gallery space. There are fantastic views here across the bay to the Riverside District and Marina Bay Sands.\n\nCheck the website to see what shows are on. There’s even a good line-up of free shows.\n\nAddress: 1 Esplanade Dr Open: daily 8am-11.30pm Cost: varies according to show, some free Getting there: near City Hall and Esplanade MRT stations More information: https://www.esplanade.com\n\nGardens by the Bay\n\nThe Supertrees are definitely one of the most iconic representations of this city state and you definitely should not leave without seeing them.

Designed to resemble the double helix structure of the DNA molecule, it symbolises “life and continuity, renewal and growth”.\n\nThe bridge is made of stainless steel, is three storeys high and 280m long, and is 8.8m above water so that boats can pass underneath. It can support up to 16,000 people at a time.\n\nOne of the best walks to do in Singapore is to go from City Hall, the Singapore Flyer and the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay across the Helix Bridge to Marina Bay Sands, the ArtScience Museum and Gardens by the Bay.\n\nThis gives you an excellent view of the city skyline from the five viewing pods on the bridge.\n\nEventually this will be part of an 11.7km promenade route that links Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, the Esplanade, Marina Barrage and the Singapore Sports Hub.\n\nOpen: 24 hours Cost: Free Getting there: near Promenade MRT (CC4/DT15), 10 min walk; near Bayfront North Jetty, 5 min walk, Promenade Jetty 7 min walk; buses – 106,77,97,97E More information: https://www.coxarchitecture.com.au/project/the-helix-bridge/\n\nMarina Bay Sands\n\nThis hotel – with its three 55-floor towers connected by a vast, curved-surfboard-like deck, the SkyPark – has become an icon of Singapore.

The Bird sculpture is not technically part of the trail but doesn’t involve much a detour to see.\n\nAbundance III, by architect-artist Sun Yu-Li, is a large bronze ring in Suntec City, which has been so cleverly constructed it appears to be different sizes and shapes depending on where you’re standing.

It’s turned off throughout the day so visitors can walk around the mini fountain at the centre three times for good luck. If you’re lucky, you might see a laser show there around 8pm and 9pm.\n\nWater is a symbol of life and wealth in Chinese culture and the inward motion of the water symbolises the retention of wealth for Suntec City as well as the idea of riches pouring in, according to feng shui experts. Hence the name Fountain of Wealth.\n\nThe fountain’s bronze ring, which has a circumference of 66m, is also based on the Hindu Mandala and represents the union of spirit and unity. Suntec City itself was designed to look like a hand emerging from the ground, the fountain forms the palm of the hand while the five tower blocks are the fingers and thumb.\n\nOpen: 24 hours Cost: free Getting there: Walk from Temasek Blvd to the roundabout\n\nSix Brushstrokes, by pop artist Roy Lichenstein,is in the outdoor plaza at Millenia Walk and was the last work of pop artist Roy Lichtenstein.

The lion head is symbolic of Singapore’s original name – Singapura – meaning “lion city” or “kota singa”. The original sculpture was designed by Kwan Sai Kheong, sculpted in white concrete by Lim Nang Seng and commissioned by the Singapore Tourism Board.
