Located in Downtown Core, Singapore, underneath Central Boulevard, the station serves various commercial developments including the Marina Bay Financial Centre, Asia Square and SGX Centre. The station is operated by SBS Transit.\n\nFirst announced as Landmark MRT station in 2005 as part of the Circle line's Downtown extension, the station was constructed as part of DTL Stage 1. The station opened in 2013. Downtown station features an Art-in-Transit artwork Leaves by Jason Lim.\n\nHistory\n\nThe station was first announced as Landmark station when the Land Transport Authority (LTA) unveiled the 3.4-kilometre (2.1 mi) Downtown extension (DTE) on 14 June 2005. The DTE was initially planned to be a branch of the Circle line, extending from Milennia (now Promenade) station to Chinatown station. In 2007, the DTE was revised, becoming Stage 1 of the 40-kilometre (25 mi) Downtown line (DTL). Through a public poll, the station was renamed to Downtown in June 2009.\n\nContract C907 for the construction of the station was awarded to Taisei Corporation for S$230 million (US$152.6 million) in December 2007. The contract also included the construction of Central Boulevard above the station. The station held an open house on 7 December 2013. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong held an official inauguration at this station on 21 December; the station commenced operations the following day along with the DTL Stage 1 stations.\n\nStation details\n\nDowntown station serves the DTL and is situated between the Bayfront and Telok Ayer stations. The official station code is DT17. Downtown station is within walking distance of the Raffles Place and Marina Bay stations on the North South Line. Being part of the DTL, the station is operated by SBS Transit. The station has a side platform configuration with four underground levels.\n\nDowntown station is underneath Central Boulevard between the junctions of Straits View and Marina View, and serves the Marina Bay Financial Centre. The station's six entrances connect to surrounding developments and landmarks including Asia Square, Hong Leong Building, Marina Bay Suites, One Raffles Quay, OUE Downtown and SGX Centre. The station has provisions to link with future developments."
