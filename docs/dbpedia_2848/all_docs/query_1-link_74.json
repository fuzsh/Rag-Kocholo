It is the second deepest station with a depth of 35m below ground level. It also houses the longest escalator, at 41 m which stretches from the ticket concourse to the transfer level and takes approximately one minute to travel.[1]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nDate Event 17 April 2010 Station officially opened\n\nArtworks[edit]\n\nCircle Line: The Amazing Neverending Underwater Adventures! by Tan Kai Syng\n\nThe artist plays the protagonist, Desyphus, a “Perpetual Commuter” on an adventure on the Circle Line. The videos projected on the wall below the station’s water-filled glass skylight takes commuters through themes of travel, time, memory and the train line.[2]\n\nCircle Line: Sea Port of Singapore by Jaafar Latiff\n\nCircle Line: Vibrant Singapore by Thang Kiang How\n\nArchitecture[edit]\n\nThe station design by WOHA resolves two conditions needed for the station: allowing a visual connection to the exterior to enhance the travel experience for the commuters, and enabling the station to blend into the landscape in the historic district and park location. A reflection pool, which also acts as the station roof, allows skylight to enter the station, and functions as a landscape element on the surface. With skylight entering the station, minimal artificial light is required for the station during the day. The natural light allows improvement in way-finding and safety for the commuters.[3] The ventilation shafts of the station also blended into the landscape, avoiding any blocking of view lines across the site to the surrounding civic buildings.[4]\n\nThe station design was commissioned through the Marina Line Architectural Design Competition jointly organised by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA). At the 2001 SIA Awards, the SIA awarded LTA the prize for ‘Excellence in Architectural Design Competitions’.[1] In 2009, the station was awarded the \"Best Transport Building\" at the World Architecture Festival, on the basis that the design gives \"precedence to the surrounding, historically important, colonial structures, creating a piazza-like urban space to the station underneath\" and noted the design's functionality to allow natural light into the station.[5] The station later won the Award for International Architecture at the AIA's 2010 National Architecture Awards.[3] In addition, it won the Chicago Athenaeum and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies and International Architecture Awards in 2011.[6]\n\nLayout[edit]\n\nL1 Street Level Singapore Art Museum, Singapore Management University, DT21Bencoolen B1 Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Machines, Passenger Service Centre B2 Service Level Restricted access B3 Service Level Restricted access B4 Transfer Hall between Concourse and Platforms B5\n\nAPlatform ➔ CC29HarbourFrontCE2Marina Bay via CC4Promenade Service Map\n\nCC2Bras Basah CC3Esplanade CE2Marina Bay CE1Bayfront CC4Promenade CC5Nicoll Highway CC6Stadium CC7Mountbatten CC8Dakota CC9Paya Lebar CC10MacPherson CC11Tai Seng CC12Bartley CC13Serangoon CC14Lorong Chuan CC15Bishan CC16Marymount CC17Caldecott CC19Botanic Gardens CC20Farrer Road CC21Holland Village CC22Buona Vista CC23one-north CC24Kent Ridge CC25Haw Par Villa CC26Pasir Panjang CC27Labrador Park CC28Telok Blangah CC29HarbourFront\n\nPlatform A/B\n\nBPlatform ➔ CC1Dhoby Ghaut Service Map\n\nCC1Dhoby Ghaut CC2Bras Basah\n\nExits[edit]\n\nExit Disabled-Access Location/Nearby A Singapore Art Museum, NTUC Trade Union House B Singapore Management University C Singapore Management University D Manulife Centre E Singapore Art Museum, Manulife Centre\n\nTransport Services[edit]\n\nFirst/Last Train Timing[edit]\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Mon − Fri Sat Sun & P.H.
