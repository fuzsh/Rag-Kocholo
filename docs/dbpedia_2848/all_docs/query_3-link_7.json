Take note that you should get the latest maps, as more train lines are being built and will be opened in the next few years. Our train network is getting more complicated, which is good! More ways to get around.\n\nMarina Bay Cruise Center\n\nThe nearest MRT station is Marina South Pier, southern most station on the North-South Line.\n\n[YOUTUBE]-a5WI-KinVQ[/YOUTUBE]\n\nSingapore Cruise Terminal @ Harbourfront\n\nThe MRT station is called Harbourfront. This is also a terminus station, at the south-west of the map.\n\nSingapore Changi Airport\n\nEastern-most station. Note, you have to change trains at Tanah Merah MRT in order to get on the line that takes you to Changi Airport.\n\nIf you can't find the link to download the map on the SMRT website, drop me an email and I'll send the file to you.\n\nCheers and have a great day!\n\nHi Iluvcruising2,\n\nI have been reading all of you information and maps ,thank you so much ,we are arriving Singapore on Thursday ,so looking forward to everything that you have suggested ,only there for 3 days ,but am hoping to cover as much as we can . It all sounds so exciting with the Chinese New Year happening while we are there ,what would you recommend as the best place ,to observe it all .\n\nIf you aren't a travel guide ,you should be ,everything you show and share is wonderful and very helpful.:D thank you !!!!\n\nCheers Deb\n\nHi Iluvcruising2,\n\nI have been reading all of you information and maps ,thank you so much ,we are arriving Singapore on Thursday ,so looking forward to everything that you have suggested ,only there for 3 days ,but am hoping to cover as much as we can . It all sounds so exciting with the Chinese New Year happening while we are there ,what would you recommend as the best place ,to observe it all .\n\nIf you aren't a travel guide ,you should be ,everything you show and share is wonderful and very helpful.:D thank you !!!!\n\nCheers Deb\n\nDear Deb,\n\nMany thanks for leaving such a nice compliment. No, I'm not a travel guide, but maybe I will become one next time.\n\nYour question is a bit tricky. You arrive on the first day of Chinese New Year (19 Feb, Thursday). Most festivities and activities culminate on 18th Feb, with street parties past midnight of 18 Feb. Once we hit 19 Feb, it is a day whereby the Chinese people will go visiting, i.e. visit relatives (usually seniors) to wish them a happy new year. So there would be fewer public activities.\n\nHowever, River Hongbao should still be on - http://www.riverhongbao.sg/\n\nThis is our iconic event to celebrate CNY and you shouldn't miss it. The website contains all the info you need to get there.\n\nI believe all the major tourist attractions would still be opened. Also, since you are here over Chinese New Year, you have the opportunity of visiting the Istana Open House - http://www.istana.gov.sg/the-istana/open-house\n\nThe Istana will be opened on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year, there will be special performances.\n\nhttp://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/istana-open-house-second-day-chinese-new-year-20150216\n\nI noticed the National Museum is also open and on the 2nd day of the Chinese New year, they have some activities.\n\nThere are also some activities at Sentosa Island on the 2nd day of CNY - http://www.sentosa.com.sg/en/SentosaCelebratesLNY/\n\nI will look around to see what else that might be open.\n\nEdited February 16, 2015 by Iluvcruising2"
