J. Novak play the two brothers as they produced film’s hit songs.\n\n“Richard Sherman was the embodiment of what it means to be a Disney Legend, creating along with his brother Robert the beloved classics that have become a cherished part of the soundtrack of our lives,” said Bob Iger, CEO of The Walt Disney Company.\n\n“From films like Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book to attractions like ‘it’s a small world,’ the music of the Sherman Brothers has captured the hearts of generations of audiences.\n\n“We are forever grateful for the mark Richard left on the world, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family.”\n\n“You don’t get songs like ‘A Spoonful of Sugar’ without a genuine love of life, which Richard passed on to everyone lucky enough to be around him,” Pete Docter, Chief Creative Officer, Pixar Animation Studios, added.\n\n“Even in his 90s he had more energy and enthusiasm than anyone, and I always left renewed by Richard’s infectious joy for life.”\n\nSherman was born in New York City on June 12, 1928. His family relocated to Beverly Hills in 1937 after years of cross-country moves.\n\nHe attended Beverly Hills High School before majoring in music at Bard College.\n\nDrafted into the United States Army, he served as conductor for the Army band and glee club from 1953 to 1955.\n\nHe earnt a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame thanks to his service to the arts industry.\n\nSherman is survived by his wife Elizabeth Sherman, 66, his children and grandchildren.\n\nA private funeral will take place on May 31 in Los Angeles."
