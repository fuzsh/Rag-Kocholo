        "text": "Questlove has been named the director of an upcoming Disney film. First exclusively reported by Deadline on Monday (March 27), the 52-year-old is set to helm a live-action adaption, hybrid reimagining of The Aristocats for Walt Disney Studios.\n\n“They chose i to chase the cat…” the musician explained on Instagram announcing the exciting news. “I basically have 2 life goals: 1. Don’t dismiss my dreams & 2. Get out of my own way.”\n\nWhile no details such as a release date have been confirmed, directing is not Questlove’s only role in the project. The Roots founding member is also credited as an executive producer and will be in charge of the film’s music.\n\nThe Aristocats script is by Will Gluck and Keith Bunin. Tariq Trotter — better known as The Roots frontman Black Thought — Shawn Gee, and Zarah Zohlman will executive produce on behalf of Thompson’s Two One Five Entertainment. According to the outlet, Gluck and his production company, Olive Bridge, will also co-produce."
