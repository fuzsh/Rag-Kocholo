        "text": "RETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nDuring a 60-year career, the versatile actor Terence Bayler, who has died aged 86, became a recognisable face on television and in films, notably for his collaborations with the Monty Python team.\n\nHe played Gregory (and other roles) in the controversial Life of Brian (1979)  a religious spoof about a man mistaken for the Messiah  uttering two of the films most memorable lines. During the final crucifixion scene, Brians fellow prisoners try to pass themselves off as him in order to escape death (a subversion of the Im Spartacus moment in Stanley Kubricks 1960 film). Amid the many cries of Im Brian, Gregory exclaims Im Brian, and sos my wife  an ad lib by Bayler. Earlier in the film, when the assorted throng worshipping Brian shout in unison We are all individuals, Bayler interjects Im not - another ad lib. He had started working with the Python team after Eric Idle  whom he knew socially  saw him performing music hall songs in a small pub theatre and was impressed with his comic timing. Idle later cast him in his first stage play, Pass the Butler (Globe theatre, 1982).\n\nThe stories you need to read, in one handy email\n\nRead more\n\nTall and distinguished looking, Bayler was cast as military officers and upper-class Englishmen, even though he was actually a working-class New Zealander. He was born in Wanganui, the son of Amy (nee Allomes) and Harold Bayler. His father, a lorry driver by day and theatre stagehand by night, got him free tickets to see shows, so he was well versed in the profession by the time he started working backstage and acting in amateur theatre.\n\nHis professional debut was the lead role in the first feature film produced in New Zealand after the second world war, Broken Barrier (1952). It was a groundbreaking film about a relationship between a Maori woman and a white man; in 1996, a still of Bayler and his co-star, Kay Ngarimu, was featured on a postage stamp issued to mark the centenary of New Zealand cinema.\n\nHe had already won a scholarship to study at Rada in London when the film was shot, and he moved to the UK in 1950. After training, he worked in theatre for Peter Hall in Twelfth Night and Richard III (Elizabethan Theatre Company, 1953). He made his West End debut in 1960 in Villa Sleep Four at the Strand theatre. The following year he won excellent notices for his comic performance in Ira Levins Critics Choice at the Vaudeville, and in 1964 he appeared in Glen Byam Shaws production of The Right Honourable Gentleman at Her Majestys theatre.\n\nHe had stints as Giles Ralston in The Mousetrap in 1967 and as the Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show (Kings Road theatre, 1974), appeared at the National Theatre in The Magistrate (1986-87), was Cominius to Corin Redgraves Coriolanus (Young Vic, 1989) and in 1993 played Colonel Pickering to Maximilian Schells Henry Higgins in a European tour of Pygmalion (the production also featured the actor Valerie Cutko, who was to become Baylers second wife).\n\nTelevision credits included the Player King in Hamlet (1961, with William Russell as Hamlet), Maigret (1963), Doctor Who (1966 and 1969, playing two different roles), The Brothers (1974), Upstairs, Downstairs (1975) and Dennis Potters Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). Having appeared in numerous episodes of Rutland Weekend Television (1975-76) for Idle, he then played Leggy Mountbatten, the band manager, in the 1978 TV film The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash, a spoof documentary about a group not unlike the Beatles.\n\nIn his heftiest cinematic role, he was cast by Roman Polanski as Macduff in his film adaptation of Macbeth (1971). The director changed the schedule to secure Baylers services when the initial dates clashed with another project he had committed to. During the brutal final fight scene he sustained an injury above his eye when he was accidentally hit by Jon Finchs sword.\n\nHaving impressed another Monty Python member, Terry Gilliam, Bayler found himself in the films Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985). Later big-screen work included James Ivorys The Remains of the Day (1993) and Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (as the ghostly Bloody Baron, 2001).\n\nBayler wrote the foreword to the book New Zealand Filmmakers (2007), describing the basic filming methods employed on Broken Barrier, an engagement for which he was paid six pounds a week plus food and tobacco. He worked on his native soil again in the film Pictures (1981), which reunited him with John OShea, the director of Broken Barrier, and on the 1992 miniseries The Other Side of Paradise.\n\nHe is survived by Valerie, and by the son and daughter of his first marriage, to the actor Bridget Armstrong, which ended in divorce.\n\n Terence Bayler, actor, born 24 January 1930; died 2 August 2016\n\nMore obituaries Topics\n\nMonty Python Comedy Theatre New Zealand Asia Pacific\n\nShare on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Save for later\n\nReuse this content\n\nMost popular in US\n\nA Trump campaign chair in Ohio says there was 'no racism' before Obama\n\nIndigenous Australians most ancient civilisation on Earth, DNA study confirms\n\nKeith Scott shooting: Charlotte police say they warned him to drop gun\n\nCharlotte protests: governor of North Carolina declares state of emergency\n\nThis photo from Charlotte tells you all you need to know about policing in America | Ije\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel\n\nRETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nArnold Palmer, a seven-time major winner who brought golf to the masses and became the most beloved figure in the game, died Sunday from complications with heart problems, a source close to the family confirmed to Golfweek. He was 87.\n\nReaction poured in from “Arnie’s Army” of admirers in the world of golf.\n\n“We loved him with a mythic American joy,” said Palmer biographer James Dodson. “He represented everything that is great about golf. The friendship, the fellowship, the laughter, the impossibility of golf, the sudden rapture moment that brings you back, a moment that you never forget, that’s Arnold Palmer in spades. He’s the defining figure in golf.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nArnold Palmer captivated audiences for decades\n\nWith his iconic brand, Arnold Palmer stood out from the crowd\n\nArnold Palmer left his mark on 300-plus course designs\n\nGolf community reacts to the death of Arnold Palmer\n\nThe Arnie years: Sept. 10, 1929 to Sept. 25, 2016\n\nNo one did more to popularize the sport than Palmer. His dashing presence singlehandedly took golf out of the country clubs and into the mainstream. Quite simply, he made golf cool.\n\n“I used to hear cheers go up from the crowd around Palmer,” Lee Trevino said. “And I never knew whether he’d made a birdie or just hitched up his pants.”\n\nGolfweek subscriber Bob Conn of Guilford, Conn., in a letter to the editor, captured the loyalty and devotion that the public felt for Palmer.\n\n“If Arnold Palmer sent me a personal letter asking me to join the cleanup crew at Bay Hill, I would buy a green jumpsuit, stick a nail in a broom handle, grab some Hefty garbage bags and shake his hand when I arrived.”\n\nIt wasn’t just the fans. His fellow competitors revered him, and the next generation and the generation after that worshiped him. When reporters at the 1954 U.S. Amateur asked Gene Littler to identify the golfer as slender as wire and as strong as cable cracking balls on the practice tee, Littler said: “That’s Arnold Palmer. He’s going to be a great player some day. When he hits the ball, the earth shakes.”\n\nPalmer, of Latrobe, Pa., attended Wake Forest University on a golf scholarship. At age 24, he was selling paint and living in Cleveland, just seven months removed from a three-year stint in the Coast Guard when he entered the national sporting consciousness by winning the 1954 U.S. Amateur at the Country Club of Detroit.\n\n“That victory was the turning point in my life,” he said. “It gave me confidence I could compete at the highest level of the game.”\n\nPalmer’s victory set in motion a chain of events. Instead of returning to selling paint, Palmer played the next week in the Waite Memorial in Shawnee-on-Delaware, Pa., where he met Winifred Walzer, who would become his wife of 45 years until her death in 1999. On Nov. 17, 1954, Palmer announced his intentions to turn pro, and golf would never be the same.\n\nIn his heyday, Palmer famously swung like he was coming out of his shoes.\n\n“What other people find in poetry, I find in the flight of a good drive,” Palmer said.\n\nHe unleashed his corkscrew swing motion, which produced a piercing draw, with the ferocity of a summer squall. In his inimitable swashbuckling style, Palmer succeeded with both power and putter. In a career that spanned more than six decades, he won 62 PGA Tour titles between 1955 and 1973, placing him fifth on the Tour’s all-time victory list, and collected seven majors in a seven-year explosion between the 1958 and 1964 Masters.\n\nPalmer didn’t lay up or leave putts short. His go-for-broke style meant he played out of the woods and ditches with equal abandon, and resulted in a string of memorable charges. At the 1960 U.S. Open at Cherry Hills near Denver, Palmer drove the first green and with his trademark knock-kneed, pigeon-toed putting stance went out and birdied six of the first seven holes en route to shooting 65 and winning the title in a furious comeback.\n\n“Palmer on a golf course was Jack Dempsey with his man on the ropes, Henry Aaron with a three-and-two fastball, Rod Laver at set point, Joe Montana with a minute to play, A.J. Foyt with a lap to go and a car to catch,” wrote Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray.\n\nEven Palmer’s setbacks were epic. He double-bogeyed the 18th hole at Augusta in the 1961 Masters after accepting congratulations from a spectator he knew in the gallery. Palmer lost playoffs in three U.S. Opens, the first to Jack Nicklaus in 1962; the second to Julius Boros in 1963; and the third to Billy Casper in 1966 in heart-breaking fashion. Palmer blew a seven-stroke lead with nine holes to go in regulation at the Olympic Club and lost to Casper in an 18-hole playoff the next day.\n\nArnold Daniel Palmer, born Sept. 10, 1929, grew up in the working-class mill town of Latrobe, in a two-story frame house off the sixth tee of Latrobe Country Club, where his father, Milfred “Deacon” Palmer, was the greenskeeper and professional.\n\nThough for decades Palmer has made his winter home in Orlando, Fla., he never lost touch with his western Pennsylvania roots in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains.\n\n“Of all the places I’ve been, there isn’t any place that I’m more comfortable than I am right here,” he told Golfweek in 2009 in Latrobe ahead of his 80th birthday.\n\nPalmer was 3 years old when his father wrapped his hands around a cut-down women’s golf club in the classic overlapping Vardon grip, and instructed him to, “Hit it hard, boy. Go find it and hit it hard again.”\n\nPalmer’s combination of matinee-idol looks, charisma and blue-collar background made him a superstar just as golf ushered in the television era. He became Madison Avenue’s favorite pitchman, accepting an array of endorsement deals that generated millions of dollars in income on everything from licensed sportswear to tractors to motor oil and even Japanese tearooms. Credit goes to agent Mark McCormack, who sold the Palmer personality and the values he represented rather than his status as a tournament winner. Palmer’s business empire grew to include a course-design company, a chain of dry cleaners, car dealerships, as well as ownership of Bay Hill Resort & Lodge in Orlando. He even bought Latrobe Country Club, which his father helped build with his own hands and where as a youth Palmer was permitted only before the members arrived in the morning or after they had gone home in the evening. Palmer designed more than 300 golf courses in 37 states, 25 countries and five continents (all except Africa and Antarctica), including the first modern course built in China, in 1988.\n\nPalmer led the PGA Tour money list four times, and was the first player to win more than $100,000 in a season. He played on six Ryder Cup teams, and was the winning captain twice. He is credited with conceiving the modern Grand Slam of the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship during a conversation with golf writer Bob Drum on a flight to Ireland for the 1960 Canada Cup. Palmer won the Masters four times, the British Open twice and the U.S. Open once. It was Palmer who convinced his colleagues they could never consider themselves champions unless they had won the Claret Jug. Nick Faldo, during Palmer’s farewell at St. Andrews in 1995 may have put it best when he said, “If Arnold hadn’t come here in 1960, we’d probably all be in a shed on the beach.” Mark O’Meara went a step further. “He made it possible for all of us to make a living in this game,” he said.\n\nIn 1974, Palmer was one of the original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame. As he grew older, a shaky putter let Palmer down, but his popularity never waned. The nascent Senior PGA Tour hitched its star to golf’s first telegenic personality when Palmer turned 50. He relished winning again and became a regular on the senior circuit, remaining active until 2006.\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel"
