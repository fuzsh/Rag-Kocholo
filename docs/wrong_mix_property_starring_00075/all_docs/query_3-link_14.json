        "text": "I often feel like the animated Disney films made during the 1970s get overlooked far too often as they’re made after the passing of Walt Disney and before the Disney Renaissance began. However, there were several animated gems made during this era and The Aristocats is one of them (it also has the distinction of being the last film project approved by Disney himself before his death in 1966). Set in Paris in the year 1910, The Aristocats follows a family of high-class felines that live with Madame, a retired opera singer. When Edgar, the family butler, learns that the cats will inherit the estate before he does, the disgruntled servant kidnaps the cats and abandons them in the French countryside, leading the cats into an adventure to get back to Paris and their home.\n\nThe titular song was performed by Maurice Chevalier, a legendary French singer and performer, who was actually talked out of retirement to do the song (his final contribution to the film industry as he died in 1972). The song describes all the advantages “aristocats” possess (‘aristocat’ being an obvious play on aristocrat) over ‘common’ cats and ends with the cats out with Madame on a carriage ride.\n\nWhich pet’s address\n\nIs the finest in Paris?\n\nWhich pets possess\n\nThe longest pedigree?\n\nWhich pets get\n\nTo sleep on velvet mats?\n\nNaturellement! The aristocats!\n\nWhich pets are blessed\n\nWith the fairest forms and faces?\n\nWhich pets know best\n\nAll the gentle social graces?\n\nWhich pets live\n\nOn cream and loving fats?\n\nNaturellement! The aristocats!\n\nThe song plays out while we’re treated to the opening credits, as well as animations of the cats that will appear later in the film.\n\nThey show aristocratic bearing\n\nWhen they’re seen\n\nUpon an airing\n\nAnd aristocratic flair\n\nIn what they do\n\nAnd what they say!\n\nAristocats are never found\n\nIn alleyways or hanging around\n\nThe garbage cans where\n\nCommon kitties play, oh no!\n\nWhich pets are known\n\nTo never show their claws?\n\nWhich pets are prone\n\nTo hardly any flaws?\n\nTo which pets\n\nDo the others tip their hats?\n\nNaturellement! The aristocats!\n\nI’ve always found it interesting that the film points out the year as 1910, as there aren’t many Disney films that specify a year. Perhaps I’m being morbid, but every time I see that date, I always remember that it was only a few years before the start of World War I, when the glitz and glamour of the 19th century disappeared. The year is also a reminder that this is a time of great change (even before the war began). For instance, while Madame is riding in a carriage, her lawyer drives up in a car (albeit a primitive one).\n\nAlso, fun piece of trivia: Hermione Baddeley, the voice of Madame, is also the voice of Auntie Shrew in The Secret of NIMH (1982) (another Disney credit includes Ellen in Mary Poppins (1964)).\n\nI like “The Aristocats,” it’s a fun little song that provides a good opening to the film and I hope you enjoy listening to it. Let me know what you think of this song in the comments below and have a great day!\n\nSee also:\n\nDisney/Dreamworks/Pixar/etc. Soundtracks A-Z\n\nBecome a Patron of the blog at patreon.com/musicgamer460\n\nCheck out the YouTube channel (and consider hitting the subscribe button)"
