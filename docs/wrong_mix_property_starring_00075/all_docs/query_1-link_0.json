        "text": "Gary Dubin, a former child actor whose credits include The Partridge Family, The AristoCats and Diamonds Are Forever, has died. He was 57.\n\nDubin died Saturday in Burbank of bone cancer, his sister, Lori “Ellie Mae” Dubin, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nDubin portrayed Punky Lazaar, a friend of Danny’s (Danny Bonaduce), in a handful of episodes of ABC’s The Partridge Family and provided the voice of the orange-furred Toulouse in Disney’s The AristoCats (1970). He also had a regular role as the son of a movie producer (Peter Haskell) on the 1969-70 NBC drama Bracken’s World.\n\nIn Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Dubin is seen as the boy who wins a stuffed animal (with smuggled jewels inside) at a carnival and has it snatched from him by Jill St. John.\n\nThe Los Angeles native also played the son of Jack Lemmon and Sally Kellerman in the romantic comedy The April Fools (1969), and later, his character met an untimely end in Jaws 2 (1978).\n\nHis TV résumé as a youngster also includes work on Green Acres, Here Come the Brides, Land of the Giants, Mannix and Eight Is Enough. Later, he dubbed for Japanese animation series and showed up on the series The Division, Sonny With a Chance and Up All Night and in the 2009 film The Lodger.\n\nIn addition to his sister, survivors include his wife Marietha, mother Barbara and cousins Jeff, Steven, Eric, Elliott, Vicki and Bradley."
