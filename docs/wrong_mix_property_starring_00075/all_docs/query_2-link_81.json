Rutledge was known for having really good serves with\n\ntremendous spin. He literally could beat most players below 2200 just with\n\nhis serves. I also remember that I was told that he had to deal with severe\n\ndepression most of his life. I believe that his suicide came shortly after\n\ntrying to come to grips with a major financial loss.\n\nMas always spoke very kindly of Rutledge and I believe he was well liked by\n\nthose who knew him. I spoke with him (as I remember) perhaps once or twice\n\nas he was using the ASTI rubber. I was very saddened when I heard he had\n\ntaken his life apparently as a direct consequence of a short term financial\n\nsetback. He had many years of success and a brilliant career so it was very\n\nsad what happened. He was I am told an extraordinary talented person.\n\nWaqidi\n\n\"jc\" <mi...@NOSPAMusmo.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:3c75ba21$0$42174$45be...@newscene.com...\n\n> What a lovely, heartwarming thread........ I'd almost rather listen to\n\n> S-jan's blathering!\n\nBelieve me, it's a pretty bad memory for me as well. At the time, I was\n\nabout 18 or 19 or so (about 1978 or 1979), and was practicing regularly with\n\nBrian Masters, who like Johnny Stillions and Eric Boggan was about 14, and\n\nthe top three in the country for their age. A short time before he died in\n\nwhat I was told was a car accident (was it a moped accident, as someone else\n\njust posted?), Brian and I took a bus to a tournament (I think an Easterns\n\nin Pittsburgh), and roomed together. Brian invited Johnny and Eric up, and\n\nwe spent the night playing video games. Later that night, we got in trouble\n\nfor throwing candy off the hotel roof. Eric got in bigger trouble when he\n\ntossed a rock and accidentally put out a hotel light, and got chased by\n\nhotel security - they didn't catch him. I knew Johnny very well, and still\n\ncan't believe it, over 20 years later. Brian also took it pretty hard. (I\n\nalso knew Rutledge Barry, Alan Evanson, Matthew Murad, Chris Manglitz and\n\nEric Jones very well, so these aren't exactly fond memories....)\n\nAround 1978, I spent the night with a friend from Virginia, Tony Khan. He\n\ngave me a ride to the tournament on his motorcycle, the only time in my life\n\nI've ever been on a motorcycle. I ended up beating him in the final of some\n\nevent, probably Under 1900 or so. After the match, he broke his racket in\n\ntwo, and stormed off very angry at himself. (I had a separate ride home.) I\n\nfound out a week later that he died in a motorcycle accident on the way\n\nhome.\n\nî—“"
