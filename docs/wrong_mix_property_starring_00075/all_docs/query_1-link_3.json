He was best known for his portrayal of Punky Lazaar, a friend of Danny Partridge on The Partridge Family.[1] He also voiced Toulouse in The Aristocats in 1970 and played the part of ill-fated teenager Eddie Marchand, who was eaten by the shark in Jaws 2.\n\nDubin portrayed a runaway boy on Green Acres in 1968. In 1969, he portrayed deaf boy Dal in the season 1 episode 25 of Land of the Giants titled, \"Shell Game\". He appeared in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in the carnival scene, where he lost to Jill St. John at the water balloons, complaining that he had been cheated and that she needed more wins to get the stuffed animal that, unknowing, contained the diamonds. Dubin was also a prominent voice actor in dubbing for Japanese animation throughout the 1990s to the early 2000s.[2]\n\nHe has also acted in many other projects, his most recent being RockBarnes: The Emperor in You.
