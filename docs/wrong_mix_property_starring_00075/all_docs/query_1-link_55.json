        "text": "A sudden change to an elderly matron's will, a sinister servant, and a mysterious disappearance set the stage for...a delightful children's film? Disney's 1970 madcap musical The Aristocats blends these elements with a toe-tapping score, enchanting animation, and a cast of colorful characters to create a film that is as light and enjoyable as a Parisian souffl√©. Through its combination of mystery, adventure, and music the film offers a delightful slice of the city of lights that is guaranteed to leave even the dog lovers in the audience wanting to be a cat. For a film that is certain to show the whole family a swinging time join The Aristocats.\n\nThe story begins in 1910 Paris with Duchess and her three kittens, Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz, enjoying a life of luxury with their mistress, a retired opera singer known as Madame. To ensure that her feline friends are cared for in the event of her death, Madame bequeaths her entire estate to her cats with the intention that the cats' inheritance then be passed on to her butler, Edgar. When Edgar overhears this plan he decides that the lifespan of Duchess and the kittens is too long to wait for his share of the estate. He then hatches a plan to drug and drown the cats and stage a fake 'catnapping' to ensure that Madame does not suspect his involvement. Before he can carry out the final stage of his deadly plot, however, he is attacked by a pair of dogs. In the ensuing chaos he flees, leaving Duchess and her kittens alive, but stranded in the French countryside. Fortunately for the feline family, help soon arrives in the form of roguish alley cat Thomas O'Malley who offers to escort them home. The cats then embark upon an adventurous journey back to Paris with plenty of joie de vivre along the way.\n\nThe film's combination of dazzling visuals and dizzying jazz tunes brings Disney's whimsical vision of Paris to vibrant life. The film's animation captures the glamour of Paris and the charm of the French countryside with equal skill, and ensures that every frame of the cats' adventure is signature Disney. The animators portray the human and animal characters with realism while lending each character unique expression and style of movement. The soundtrack aptly propels the story forward while also revealing insight into each of the characters' distinct personalities. Each of the film's tunes contains an infectious quality that is guaranteed to leave viewers humming for days, with the swinging finale 'Everybody Wants To Be a Cat' maintaining a well earned place in the studio's storied songbook. To enjoy a feast for the eyes, ears, and ultimately the heart hit the road with The Aristocats.\n\nThe voice performances infuse the dialogue with an energy, humor, and emotion that ensure that each member of the colorful cast of characters virtually leaps off of the screen. Hermione Baddeley conveys Madame's sophisticated refinement with ease while still imbuing her with lovable quirkiness and warmth. Charles Lane is uproarious in his turn as Madame's eccentric attorney, Georges. Roddy Maude-Roxby strikes an ideal balance between menace and comedy as hapless villain Edgar. Gary Dubin, Liz English, and Dean Clark nearly steal the film in their endearing, but never cloying, turns as Duchess' precocious kittens Toulouse, Marie, and Berlioz. Eva Gabor personifies elegance in a vocal performance that exudes grace and charm while still conveying maternal warmth and dry wit. Phil Harris masterfully blends suave with swagger in his roguish turn as the alley cat with a heart of gold Thomas O'Malley. Together Harris and Gabor convey a chemistry so believable that it almost makes the viewer forget that they are rooting for a romance between a pair of cartoon cats.\n\nThe Aristocats showcases some of the most charming, elegant, and ultimately heartwarming family entertainment ever put to celluloid. Through its captivating animation, catchy songs, and memorable characters the film treats the entire family to a fun filled adventure of the first order. To learn why everybody wants to be a cat join the hepcats of The Aristocats."
