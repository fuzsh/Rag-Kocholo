        "text": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning University of Hawai‘i Mānoa, Honolulu., 2010\n\nLand Development Process Monitoring & Trail Management Planning for the National Park Service Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail. DURP Land Development Project, October 2010 Juliette Budge and Luciano Minerbi (PI) Department of Urban and Regional Planning University of Hawai‘i Mānoa, Honolulu HI,96822. This technical document studies the land development process and its impacts on Hawaiʻi ancient and historic trails and associated cultural sites through material available to the public through federal, state and county agencies. The scope is to see how the public can learn about the land development and the mechanisms beyond the issuance of various land development permits. Flow charts describe each permit associated with the Island of Hawaiʻi . Also included are the statutory guidelines associated with these permits to specify the application process, opportunity for public involvement and final decision making. A spreadsheet depicts all permitting process in a format for comparative analysis. An analysis was performed of the interagency work-flow and communication during the permit processes and interviews were conducted with agencies and other persons able to inform on the efforts. Rules can be confusing and even contradictory complicating the understanding of the process. Making the land development process accessible, and manageable enough for the public to have a voice is an important part of trail management, as it establishes the public as a stakeholder when development projects are proposed on the islands. Ch. 1 “Land Development Monitoring” discusses the need for monitoring along the trail corridor. Ch. 2 “Background and Data Compilation” describes the process of data collection. Ch. 3 “Application Forms” explains limitations in the search for information. Ch. 4 “Interview Instruments” explains the intent of the interviews. Ch. 5 “Permit Process Flow Charts and Description of Permit Process contains visual flow charts of each permit process at state and county levels with discussion of their application requirements and how the National Park Service (NPS) can be involved to influence decisions to protect the trail corridor. Ch. 6 “Perception of the Process” contains ideas from various agencies. Ch. 7 “Specific Opportunities for Inter-Agency Collaboration and Communication” proposes recommendations for the NPS. Five Appendices follow.\n\nDownload\n\nD. The District Court and Court of Appeals have attempted to overrule the presumption against the jurisdiction of the federal courts The federal courts of the Ninth Circuit appear to have inappropriately aligned themselves with the creditor class and their lawyers against individual debtors. As a result, the Ninth Circuit now simply assumes that BNY Mellon trustees oversee “traditional” trusts, so that federal courts in this circuit no longer have to demonstrate they actually have subject-matter jurisdiction over individual debtors. See e.g., Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Thunder Props., 778 F. App’x 488 (9th Cir. 2019). But see Bank of Am., N.A. v. Remington Place Homeowners’ Ass’n., No. 19-16802, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 4112 (9th Cir. Feb. 12, 2021)(applying traditional subject-matter jurisdiction analysis in case not involving an individual debtor.) In Thunder Props. the Ninth Circuit held in an unpublished memorandum that subject-matter jurisdiction did not have to be demonstrated by a “Bank of NY Mellon” purported trustee prior to the District Court granting summary judgment on the merits because (1) “nothing alleged in the complaint suggests the relevant trust is anything but a traditional trust,” Id. at 488, and (2) “Defendants never sought discovery to contest the truth of Bank of New York Mellon’s factual allegations regarding urisdiction.” Id. at 488, n. 1. This holding violates this Court’s longstanding precedents that the presumption against lower courts’ jurisdiction must be factually rebutted in the record in order for lower courts to exercise judicial power. See e.g. DaimlerChrysler v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 & n.3 (2006); Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991); Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 546-547 (1986); Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994); Miller & Lux, Inc. v. E. Side Canal & Irrigation Co., 211 U.S. 293, 302 (1908); Thomas v. Bd. of Trs., 195 U.S. 207, 210-11 (1904); Lehigh Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Kelly, 160 U.S. 327, 337 (1895); King Bridge Co. v. Otoe Cty., 120 U.S. 225, 226-27 (1887); Grace v. Am. Cent. Ins. Co., 109 U.S. 278, 283-84 (1883); Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. 646, 649 (1878); Turner v. President, Dirs., & Co. of Bank of N. Am., 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 8, 11 (1799). The rule is, and always has been that “[t]he facts necessary to establish standing . . . must not only be alleged at the pleading stage, but also proved at trial.” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1931, 201 L.Ed.2d 313, 329 (2018) citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)(holding that subject-matter jurisdiction must be established before a court can issue a summary judgment.) Cf. Sprint, 559 U.S. 272–295 (requiring documentation in the record that the lawsuit by a representative plaintiff is of “the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.”) The problem is not just the Ninth Circuit abused its judicial power in the Thunder Props. case, but that it did so in a deceptive way that suggests its departure from the longstanding presumption against subject-matter jurisdiction was appropriate, when the Ninth Circuit’s decision here demonstrates that it is not. Stafne made the factual challenges to Nationstar’s invocation of the District Court’s jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1), which both the District Court and Court of Appeals outright ignored as if their judicial power was not in any way limited. And Stafne moved these courts to require attorneys claiming to represent the trust to prove that authority by which they represented such trust in accordance with long-established precedent from this Court, which those same lower courts again ignored E. The decisions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals promote judicial tyranny under the pretext that Stafne acted improperly. Stafne has never before asserted a similar defense, i.e., lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as a sole defense, on behalf of a client facing a summary judgment because it is a very risky strategy. He does so here because the risk to his home and life is merited by the circumstances this nation confronts in the opening decades of the Twenty-First Century, including unprecedented homelessness, a pandemic, and greed, which as this case demonstrates now pervades our legal system. Stafne believes the Constitution is on his side. ...\n\nDownload"
