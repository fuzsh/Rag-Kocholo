Shortly after Walt Disney's death, his studio released The Aristocats, near the beginning of a period of decline for Disney Studios. It's a cheery, straightforward entertainment vehicle that, like many of the most successful Disney films, centers on animals. In this case, it's a family of disinherited cats fighting to regain their rightful fortune from a conniving butler. Something of a feline French road movie, The Aristocats features Maurice Chevalier singing the title song and Eva Gabor as the prissy pussy Duchess. No less than four directors are credited on this collaborative effort, a perennial favorite in the second tier of Disney successes.
