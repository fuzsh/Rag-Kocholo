        "text": "Nothing could have prepared either the literary world in general or the curious reader who had been following Eliot’s career to date for the publication, in late 1922, of The Waste Land. Published in October of that year in Eliot’s own literary review, the Criterion, in London and in the Dial in New York, it was then released in book form in December of that year by the New York publishing house Boni & Liveright. Virtually overnight The Waste Land became a focal point and rallying cry for the culture wars of its time and brought Eliot a celebrity and iconic status that he would never live down and, within a short time, would be adamantly refusing to live up to.\n\nBACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS\n\nEliot’s The Waste Land is undoubtedly the most renowned if not notorious literary achievement in poetry in English of the 20th century, a poem so celebrated even in its own time that it generated a whole slew of legends, misinformation, and general myths about its origins, intentions, and impact on the contemporary scene of postwar Europe in the early 1920s, a scene of which the poem has by now come to be regarded as a perfect reflection. Surely, if nothing else, the notion that it is barely readable, let alone intelligible, is a part of The Waste Land’s reputation among readers. No one would dispute that The Waste Land stands among the handful of literary works from this time—other examples including most notably Hugh Selwyn Mauberley by Eliot’s close friend, literary confidante, and erstwhile mentor, the expatriate American poet Ezra Pound, and Ulysses, the highly experimental, innovative, and epic novel by Irish novelist James Joyce—that typified modernism in English language literature, both from the point of view of its most energetic practitioners and its most ardent detractors.\n\nModernists such as Eliot, Pound, and Joyce were obsessed with the idea that the literary artist could create a text in any medium, be it the novel, poetry, or a theatrical piece, that would freely and enthusiastically break all the rules and fly in the face of centuries of conventional wisdom and traditions, all for the sake of creating equally enduring works of literature that did more than just comment on human experience—that, instead, could effectively mirror its most obscure psychological and spiritual sources and dimensions. Other motives and issues compelled these younger artists as well, of course. The world had changed radically between 1800 and 1900, a century that was and continues to be regarded as an age of revolution in virtually all fields of human endeavor and on all fronts of human concerns. Efforts to revivify or revolutionize the arts coincided with these other efforts. What they themselves called modernism was the response of many of those involved with creative activities, particularly among the young, to these very real shifts, some of them quite cataclysmic, in what is called, for lack of a more inclusive term, the human condition. On the other side of what was then and possibly remains a great divide were those who saw nothing but anarchy and chaos, nihilism and irreverence, tastelessness and arrogance, in those who were practicing modernist techniques and utilizing modernist ways of thinking that eschewed authoritarianism and absolutes and advocated in their place relativistic ways of thinking and perceiving reality.\n\nFrom his debut on the literary stage in the mid- 1910s, Eliot was unmistakably one who had cast his lot with these newer ways of thinking and of defining the relationship among the writer, the work, and the reader. In his most famous early poems, among which “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” and “Rhapsody on a Windy Night” stand out to this day as exceptionally new and original works, Eliot showed that he was far more interested in expressing his time and place, its moral and social dilemmas and inner anxieties, than in carrying on business as usual. Rather than becoming an artist of the beautiful, it was clear as he attempted to translate the vision and attitudes of the French symbolists into contemporary American poetry, that his aim was to be an artist of the real, even if that often meant the sordid, the squalid, and the boring. Whether it was for these reasons or for other characteristics that Eliot’s poetry exhibited, his intentional efforts to “resuscitate the dead art of poetry,” words from Pound’s Mauberley, led Pound to proclaim Eliot, in a letter to Poetry editor Harriet Monroe, a poet who had “made himself modern all on his own.”\n\nFor a while, it seemed, however, as if Eliot might not be able to continue to live up to this reputation. The quatrain poems that, with their iconoclastic and sophisticated tone, succeeded these early efforts may not have been quite up to the same mark of originality and meaningful innovations as the poetry composed in 1910–11, primarily during Eliot’s Paris sojourn. In these later poems, Eliot’s efforts to surprise and puzzle his readers with a petulant cleverness and an excessive erudition, including the use of obscure, Greek-based medical terms and other multisyllabic words that were more likely to be found in use in the academy than in the literary salon, may all too often have overwhelmed the reasonably serious themes underlying the poetry of works such as “The Hippopotamus” and “Whispers on Immortality.” Still, Eliot remained something of trailblazer from whom a more somber and sober poetry would emerge with “Gerontion” in 1919, as if he had learned to bring the frivolous erudition of the quatrains to bear with the power of the same sort of tragic vision that had given “Prufrock” and “Rhapsody” their deserved but unassuming gravity.\n\nFor those who despised the newfangled ways that modernism seemed to be espousing and to take a certain iconoclastic relish in embodying, The Waste Land was the last straw, the arch case in point for the argument that, with the modernist movement, serious literature, and poetry in particular, had reached a low point in its development, one from which it might never fully recover. The subsequent publication of the poem in book form with notes, of all things, appeared to them to clinch the argument for good. What kind of poet could imagine that his work needed notes in order for a reader to be able to understand it, some wondered, claiming that the notes only made any attempt toward comprehending The Waste Land worse, not better. Indeed, what with James Joyce having virtually simultaneously published in Ulysses what, from the point of view of even sophisticated readers, was an unreadable novel, many were inclined to begin to believe that the entire modernist movement was an elaborate hoax, a private joke executed by a few dozen overeducated and pretentiously self-absorbed literary snobs.\n\nBut there were as many, if not more, who embraced the poem for what they took it to be saying about their times, times that had just witnessed the conclusion of a four-year war that had virtually brought European civilization to its knees. This was a civilization that had brought the world unheard of technological and commercial progress at the expense of their own populations and of the rights of other peoples around the globe to self-determination and self-government. The catastrophe of World War I, or the Great War, had compelled Pound to label Europe “an old bitch gone in the teeth.” What price glory, after all, if that quest for glory had come to this: a Europe in ruins, if not quite literally, as was the case in many areas, at least economically and in terms of the morale of its people?\n\nOddly enough, both the Eliot poem and the Joyce novel won as much favor as recrimination for the uses that each author made of Europe’s classical past, although on reflection it is perhaps not odd at all. In Joyce’s case, he retold in modern terms the epic homeward journey of Homer’s hero, Odysseus. In Eliot’s case, allusions to sources as sundry as Sophocles and Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare and Ovid, make up much of the poetry of The Waste Land.\n\nFor those who were imagining that Europe had just gone to hell in a handbasket, the invidious comparisons that Eliot and Joyce seemed to be making between the great literary monuments of the past and the diminished scope for original creative vision in the present were seen as a fitting critique of a civilization that had fallen into a cultural and spiritual decline. On the other hand, those who still held out hope for the future lamented the fact that all that modernism appeared to be able to produce were works that looked back in sorrow, mimicking past triumphs but unable to equal them. The sides may not have been quite as neatly divided as this, but there were sides and the debate was furious, even if it was carried on mainly in the pages of little magazines, as the major reviews of those days were called, and in university classrooms.\n\nWithin time, however, both works took their places as literary masterpieces that, like the great works of ages past, tell the future something significant of their own times, even if the times themselves did not necessarily realize or recognize as much to be the case. It did not take long for Dante to become the voice of the Renaissance, for Shakespeare to be seen as a literary genius of worldwide importance, or for Joyce to be widely read and highly respected.\n\nThe Waste Land, however, remains a problem text. While no one would deny its importance as a literary document, the precise nature of its achievement as a work of literature, pure and simple, remains elusive for the very reason that the poetry remains difficult to read and is seldom rewarding for the novice reader. Some modest preparation, nevertheless, can make The Waste Land not only accessible but challengingly so. To understand the times that produced it, the place that it occupies in Eliot’s development to this point in his poetic career, the poetry’s sources, and Eliot’s methods of composition can all contribute to finding in the finished poem one of the most incredibly conceived works of literature ever composed.\n\nIn his effort to resist modeling his poem on any previous work while simultaneously paying an oblique homage to the accumulated accomplishments of past epochs, Eliot created a work that is a tribute neither to the past nor to the present and certainly not to European literature in particular or to culture in general, but to the human imagination and its capacity to make order out of the chaotic and random. That is the struggle of art in any age, but it seemed to be a more obvious and compelling struggle during the time that Eliot and his generation were both formulating and executing those masterworks of literary modernism among which The Waste Land shall remain a spectacularly shining example, albeit an occasionally blinding one as well.\n\nThe War\n\nSometimes scholarship does not have to uncover the obscure for fear of appearing to belabor the obvious. That is certainly the case with the profoundly devastating impact that World War I had on all aspects of European civilization. The war’s causes remain as transparent as its effects, and neither paint a pretty picture of human nature or of the sorry consequences of greed, pride, and blatant stupidity. One might question the notion that Europe had indeed produced a civilization in the first place, for it was the ferocity, destructiveness, and futility of the war that inevitably gave rise to the disillusionment that the catastrophe of the war ultimately engendered in the young, who also were those who fought and died in it. It was this same disillusionment that the literature of the 1920s, The Waste Land a notable example in this regard, would reflect, according to some.\n\nA brief overview of the causes and consequences of the war will expose the severely dissipating impact that it had on any and all notions of cultural and racial superiority that had been running rampant among Europeans up to that moment. The popular imagination would have it that the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914 was the direct result of the assassination by a Serbian nationalist of the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife, Sophia, in Sarajevo, the capital of Serbia. An event of that order was a long time in both the coming and the making, however. As awful as such an act of political terrorism was, it was only the famous spark that ignited the tinderbox that Europe had become in the century since the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1815. It had been a century during which the four great European powers—England, France, Russia, and Austria-Hungary—jockeyed for military dominance and colonial and commercial one-upsmanship in a game of constantly shifting alliances and treaties amid bureaucratic and palace intrigues. By the last third of the 19th century, those four powers had been joined by Italy and Germany, which only recently had unified into the modern nations that we know today. An already stiff competition for territorial and market expansion only became that much stiffer.\n\nTo put it simply, the European powers started stepping on each other’s toes no matter where they turned and whenever they turned. Ultimatums and threats were made with an ever-increasing belligerency. Pledges of support and mutual defense were sworn to as freely. Sooner or later, someone or something was bound to slip up.\n\nThe bullets that killed Franz-Ferdinand and his consort in 1914 had been fired nearly a century before when in 1820 the same great powers had carved up post-Napoleonic Europe among themselves at the Congress of Vienna. Along with the royal couple, the same assassin’s bullets struck down a century of posturing that had convinced Europe if not the world that theirs was the most successful and refined civilization that history had seen to that time. When hostilities finally broke out in August 1914 on a continent that had been legendarily teetering on the brink of war for more than a decade, no one was particularly surprised, although nearly everyone was convinced that the conflict would be over in a matter of months if not weeks.\n\nGermany and Austria-Hungary quickly found themselves allied against England, France, Russia, and Italy, and it was well nigh impossible for other, lesser European nations and powers to stay out of the way. A modern phenomenon came into being: world war. The catastrophic irony was that the very self-congratulatory pomposity that had led up to the outbreak of conflict now only underscored the war’s relentless brutality, and that irony was itself ironical.\n\nIn earlier works such as Heart of Darkness, such authors as the Polish-born English novelist Joseph Conrad had already borne witness to the moral travesty of 19th-century European colonial and cultural imperialism, but so pervasive were its self-assured successes that the moral bankruptcy that it portended seemed nevertheless to defy easy analysis or even satire. The legal impunity and moral immunity with which the European ruling classes manipulated public opinion and the fate of nations worldwide gave rise to a new, cynical, and skeptical literature, like the French symbolist movement, a literature that was all the vogue among the avantgarde during Eliot’s youth and that would become the seedbed for the modernism that had then subsequently burst on the literary scene on both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly in Europe, in the prewar years. If literary artists had found it difficult to grapple effectively with the contradictions of values and moral paradoxes that had led up to the war, however, they were to find it far more difficult to deal with the hypocrisy and fanatical nationalistic patriotism that the war itself produced. Indeed, so immune had prewar European self-aggrandizement become to the normal community channels of criticism and correction such as the arts, the church, and legitimate political dissidence, all of which as institutions had been either neutralized or radicalized into ineffectiveness, that it would finally take nothing less than a conflict on the scale of World War I to expose the essential corruption of vision at the heart of European cultural arrogance and put one abrupt stop to the whole awful show.\n\nIn a manner of speaking, the war unraveled all the lies that a civilization had been telling itself and the rest of the world for decades, perhaps even centuries, and left in their place only emptiness. The rationales of a racial, managerial, and entrepreneurial superiority by which Europe had justified colonizing and otherwise exploiting to some degree or another most of the known world from the 16th century onward were now revealed to be nothing more than a justification for those old standbys, greed and territorial expansion, that simply could not, when the true trial came, pan out. Europe’s vaunted superiority had been forever blasted.\n\nPart of the value of The Waste Land, as its title suggests, is that its complexities are intended somewhat to mirror, portray, and embody this emptiness that the war left behind; but there was far more to the aftermath of the war than that. There was also the bitter irony that such a bloodbath had achieved, by demolishing the myth of European greatness, no other end than that. That it had left not opportunities for new beginnings but only emptiness and despair in the place of that previous self-confident arrogance. As much was an irony that not even art could successfully engage without seeming to distort itself as well. That is, great art, be it literary or musical or plastic, can portray great tragedy or great comedy, but it cannot easily portray smallmindedness, futility, and meaninglessness. A sense of that withering loss of all perspective and purpose is exactly what the war had engendered in those who survived it, particularly those of a more creative spirit like Eliot’s. A now-famous study published in 1973, Paul Fussell’s The Great War and Modern Memory, makes an extremely convincing case that the cultural catastrophe that the war both was for and wreaked on Europe changed the very ways in which poets wrote about war and in which the public perceived its purpose and results.\n\nBattles were fought in which casualties in the tens of thousands were produced in a matter of days if not hours. The front in the West became stalemated and shifted sometimes only in terms of yards over months on end. Rats in the no-man’sland between the heavily fortified trenches became as large as cats and dogs from feasting on the dead and wounded who had to be left where they lay. There was chemical warfare, so horrible a means of waging war that it has been condemned and outlawed as battlefield ordinance among civilized nations ever since. All of these gruesome details, meanwhile, were communicated willy-nilly and nearly instantaneously by a popular press that had become a major competitive industry in the last part of the 19th century and, so, like the 24-hour cable news channels of our own time, required reams of lurid copy and appropriately graphic photographs of the war in order to sell newspapers.\n\nIn one final, capping irony, when the war finally ended after more than four years, on November 11, 1918, it was not in any emphatic victory for one side or the other, but in an armistice, a truce of sorts (although Germany would be penalized with reparations and other territorial and economic sanctions that eventually would lead to a renewal of hostilities a mere 20 years later in what history now knows as World War II). Fussell summarized all these results and their impact on ways of thinking in the remainder of the 20th century in this manner: “there seems to be one dominating force of modern understanding; . . . it is essentially ironic; and . . . it originates largely in the application of mind and memory to the events of the Great War.”\n\nFrom start to finish, the war had had as devastating an effect on literary artists and their hope and belief in the future as on any other members of the communities affected by it. In a letter composed shortly after Great Britain’s entry into the war in August 1914, the American novelist Henry James, who had been residing in England for most of his adult life, spoke for the dashed hopes of many when he wrote that “the plunge of civilization into the abyss of blood and darkness . . . gives away the whole long age during which we have supposed the world to be . . . gradually bettering.” Ultimately, he declared the prospects of the cultural and social disaster that the war was forecasting for Europe to be “too tragic for any words.” Though already in his 70s, James was so moved by the cataclysmic struggle that then ensued as the result of Britain and the rest of “civilized” Europe’s waging total war that, to signal his moral support for the British cause in the conflict, he became, and, in 1915, died, a British subject.\n\nEliot, for his own part, was a man young enough for military service in a world where young men who were not supporting the war effort in some manner or another were becoming more and more scarce commodities on the so-called home front. He had been in London more or less permanently since the summer of 1914 as an Oxford student 428 Waste Land, The and later a figure on the London literary scene, part-time Latin teacher, and bank clerk, but he had remained a U.S. citizen, and the United States was a neutral power for most of the war years. (Late in 1918, Eliot would try to enlist for service with the U.S. armed forces but ran into so much red tape that he abandoned the effort.) Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that he was personally affected by an epic conflict that was laying waste his own generation. Lost to the future would be such brilliant and promising young thinkers, artists, and poets as T. E. Hulme, Henri Gaudier- Brzeska, and Wilfrid Owen.\n\nIn December 1917, as the war stretched into its fourth year and the United States had by then been dragged into the European conflict as well, Eliot could comment in a letter to his father on how much the lives of everyone around him, himself included, had been “so swallowed up in the one great tragedy that one almost ceases to have personal experiences or emotions, and such as one has seem so unimportant.” Eliot concluded the thought by remarking nevertheless that he had “a lot of things to write about if the time ever comes when people will attend to them,” but that does not mean that wartime was not otherwise a time for poetry and for poetic renewal. If World War I was a war that depoeticized warfare by deromanticizing it, it was nonetheless not a war that did not produce poetry—but it was a changed poetry, one that was capable of rendering the paradoxes and ironies of a human and cultural tragedy of colossal proportions in terms of its impact on individuals rather than on nations.\n\nThe most startling feature of the war, if that could be summarized in a single word, was in fact its waste—of time, of resources, of human energy, of life itself—young life, promising life, hopeful life. Every war exposes warfare as a terrible way to conduct human affairs. World War I, however, did this in a way that those who were left to survey the wreckage of a civilization that the war had left behind found to be intolerable and disgraceful.\n\nOne of the most immediate and devastating results was that traditional sources of authority and stability, the state and the military, but particularly the remnants of the ancient European aristocracy, were totally discredited. Of the six great European powers that waged the war (seven if the Ottoman Turkish Empire is included), three suffered irreparable fissures in their traditional power structures. The longtime hereditary rulers of Germany, Austria- Hungary, and Russia were sent packing.\n\nThe old order had vividly, demonstrably, finally changed, even if it had nearly brought the whole precarious structure of civilized society down with it. In the aftermath of such a stunningly unanticipated changing of the guard, modernism, with its emphasis on making the arts new, was none too surprised to find that it had been waiting in the wings since the turn of the century if not earlier and was more than ready to tackle the task of chronicling this new moment in European, perhaps even human history. No one will deny that Eliot’s The Waste Land, a poem based on the ancient myth of a wounded king and a blasted land that is seeking a questing hero who will heal its deadly illness, holds an honored and most telling place in that chronicle.\n\nThe Immediate Sources\n\nThe Waste Land is done a serious disservice, however, if it is treated as only or even primarily being a poem about or in response to the war that had just ended in Europe. Eliot was always careful to distinguish between the work and the biographical, social, and historical sources that produced it, not to obfuscate matters but for the sake of emphasizing that a poem is not second-rate or even secondtier autobiography or journalism or history but is itself a species of human record, human knowing of an entirely different order. Perhaps no other form of human communication, and there are many, is so difficult to understand and accept in terms of itself and itself alone. That is an attitude, a prejudice, that Eliot sought to ameliorate if not overturn in the best of his critical commentaries, yet he has often been the poet most associated with autobiographical or documentary readings, perhaps for the very reason that his poetry, as poetry, is a difficult nut to crack to this day. (The poetry of The Waste Land provides the best example of that very difficulty and complexity.)\n\nAnother case in point is Eliot’s mental and emotional condition at the time of The Waste Land’s composition. While it would be foolhardy to deny that the horrors and fears generated by four years of unceasing warfare found their way into aspects of the tone and texture of the poetry of The Waste Land, those effects are as blended with the effects of other untold experiences, both conscious and unconscious, so that to try to disentangle or identify particular ones would be equally foolhardy. Nevertheless, legend has it that Eliot was either undergoing treatment for or actually having a mental breakdown at a psychiatric clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland, in the fall of 1921, during the period that he was writing The Waste Land. The fact is that the poem was hardly composed at one sitting or even several. It combines as many if not more bits and pieces from earlier, often discarded poetic treatments by Eliot himself, written at scattered times in his life, as from other poets.\n\nA significant passage from early on in “The Burial of the Dead,” the first part of The Waste Land, for example, can be found virtually verbatim in “The Death of Saint Narcissus,” a poem that was set in galleys for the October 1915 issue of Poetry but was never published. Nearly the entire text of the fourth part, “Death by Water,” meanwhile, is taken from a poem of Eliot’s, “Dans le Restaurant,” that was published in the Little Review in October 1916. These lines cannot be said to be verbatim transcription, however, because the Eliot original is written in French. Furthermore, the nightmarish or hallucinatory and always fragmentary qualities of the poetry of The Waste Land, qualities that seem to support or at least suggest the view that they are either the results of or meant to mimic an unstable state of mind, can be found in Eliot’s finished poems from as early as the “Preludes” and “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” written in 1911, all the way up to “Gerontion,” composed as late as 1919.\n\nPound’s severe editing out of some of Eliot’s original sections of the poem also had the effect of making the finished text seem far more fragmentary than Eliot’s initial design would have indicated. There was much more detailed narrative description in the manuscript that Pound worked from, a draft that began with a long episode of youthful revelers enjoying a night on the town in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reminiscent of Joyce’s famous Nighttown sequence in Ulysses. Another section, involving the typist and her erstwhile lover, was far longer, too, in keeping with the source after which it was modeled, Alexander Pope’s The Rape of the Lock. There was, as a consequence, a more logical flow to the poetry and poem both than could ever be guessed at from the poem that was finally published.\n\nPerhaps equally as important are the biographical data, however. Eliot’s nerves were often if not always bad under the stress of his marriage to Vivien Haigh-Wood and her own ill health; he also suffered from the weakening effects of his own never sturdy physical constitution, which made him prone to chronic but never serious illnesses. In September 1921, a physician had recommended a period of rest and recuperation as treatment for headaches that Eliot was suffering (there had just been six months of drought in London). However, when Eliot applied to his employers, Lloyds Bank, for an extended vacation so that he might avail himself of such medical rest, the paperwork that his supervisors subsequently filed to justify his absence from work identified the reason for the three-month leave as a “nervous breakdown.” Finally, although Eliot, following a month on the Kent coast at Margate, initially planned to sojourn for the remaining two months of his leave in a country cottage belonging to Lady Rothermere, who was underwriting the Criterion, at the last moment Ottoline Morrell prevailed upon him to go instead to Lausanne and a clinic run there by a Dr. Vittoz, who had had some success with treating people who were emotionally run down, among them Lady Ottoline herself and Julian Huxley, brother of the novelist Aldous.\n\nWhile the foregoing depiction of how Eliot came to be in treatment at a psychiatric clinic in Lausanne while he was composing the better part of The Waste Land hardly constitutes a comedy of errors, neither does it suggest that Eliot had suffered anything even remotely resembling a mental breakdown. The hints with which The Waste Land opens of people visiting one of those European health resorts or spas frequented by members of the leisure class further underscore what his time in Lausanne must have seemed like for him. In resorting in this way to biographical information to clarify poetic detail, it is important to remember that the issue is not whether biography and current events can shape poetic output but whether they do anything more than that, thereby giving the poetry all its purpose and meaning. Where does the life and its attendant experiences leave off and the poetry, which is what must matter, begin?\n\nEliot was acutely aware of this conundrum. At just about the same time that the aftermath of the war was sinking in on both public life and private mentalities, Eliot, in 1919, was penning the essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” in which he was forcefully arguing for the necessary separation between, as he put it, the person who suffers and the mind that creates. Eliot’s aim in proposing as much was not to deny that the poet writes out of personal experience—what more does anyone have?—but that creative processes transform that personal experience into something else altogether, much as digestive processes transform food into nutrients that then become muscle and blood cells.\n\nTo that notion that there is not a direct relationship between poets’ personal experiences and the poetry that they write could be added a corollary requiring a like separation between the times and the literary works that emerge from them. For Eliot, however, there is a greater consideration at hand than the transformative powers of art, and that is its transcendent qualities. If art only comments on the times that produce it, then it cannot possibly continue to serve as commentary on enduring or permanent aspects of human experience, which it clearly does.\n\nAny reader who has ever confronted a work of literature from the past without any information other than the text itself knows this simple fact well. True, there may be a subsequent desire on a reader’s part to learn about the times or people or culture that produced the text as a result, and having that subsidiary information to begin with may make for an entirely different reading experience— but neither is a necessary condition or conclusion, and someone of Eliot’s way of thinking would argue that everyone’s reading experience, as well as every reading, is different in any case.\n\nIt is this transcendent aspect of poetry that had apparently been of critical interest to Eliot himself from his earliest attempts at poetic composition. That a young descendent of Puritan American stock could find not only inspiration but a voice and poetic techniques in the French symbolists, not to mention a 13th-century Italian adherent of Roman Catholicism, the poet Dante, as Eliot indeed did, speaks reams in favor of his having cultivated from the start an approach toward literature that stressed its timelessness, but not at the expense of its power as art. At the very least, his own wide literary interests would have been living proof to him that there was something in the poetic act that superseded cultures and even language systems, providing it with an essential capability to speak with fresh impact over great passages of both time and geographic distance and despite barriers of language and culture. It was as if for him and his methods of composition, literature formed a present and living whole in which all the works of all the ages were somehow contiguous with each other, shaped by and shaping one and the other.\n\nNor is that a very far-fetched proposition. If people are capable of accepting that there are only six degrees of separation between any two human beings chosen at random from out of the billions who are alive at any one moment, how much more reasonable it is to accept the idea that all works of the imagination, of which there are so many less, affect and are affected by each other. In any event, that had become by the time of the publication of The Waste Land the hallmark of Eliot’s style. The easy commerce in his texts among original lines of verse and both open and veiled allusions to the works of others, virtually always without attribution and never with any sort of advanced warning, bespeaks this attitude toward the uses and the presence of both past and present voices in his work. Nor was he alone in this. For just one outstanding example, the poetry of Ezra Pound also depended for its challenging effectiveness on his sprinkling the words and phrases of other poets, often in their original, non-English form, liberally among his own.\n\nIndeed, while The Waste Land is not an easy text and does not even lie well on the page, what with its irregular stanzaic patterns and line lengths, not to mention frequent appearances of whole lines of verse, often consecutively, in languages other than English, no one who had been following Eliot’s poetry to this time would have been particularly struck by his methodology. (This time he even provided notes, when he published the work in book form.) Criticism has come to call this methodology intertextuality, referring to the processes of cultural and generic cross-pollination that have taken place among texts very likely from the beginnings of the use and easy dissemination of the written word. Virgil’s great epic the Aeneid is founded on Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, and anyone familiar with either text would know that, but someone who was not familiar with Homer would not hardly miss Virgil’s essential points.\n\nThe author does not have to be conscious of his or her borrowings, however, any more than a reader does. The only difference that a poet like Eliot, and poetry like Eliot’s, makes is that, because Eliot exposes his allusions, the reader is made conscious from the outset that literature is the product of a continuous human dialogue whose terms can crop up in the unlikeliest of places and often without either recognition or attribution on the author’s or reader’s part. If the mind is like a mirror, it is important to remember that a mirror has no memory. There is no before and after, earlier and later. The whole of the past is a simultaneous experience for anyone who knows it by the bits and pieces by which each of us know it as it rises, quite frequently totally unbidden, to the surface of the reflective mind.\n\nInto the structure of The Waste Land, then, and onto its complicated surface detail, Eliot weaves centuries, millennia, of that mirror’s magic sights. His trick is that he lets his readers know that he is doing this, so that along with him, or at least along with the poem’s unnamed and unintroduced protagonist, Eliot’s readers share the quest that the poetry embodies, a quest, appropriately enough, for meaning on a stormy sea of signifiers (although, in keeping with The Waste Land’s ruling metaphor of cultural drought, it would be more like a desert sandstorm). Poetry’s aim is to quicken not the intellect, but the imagination, to make it make connections that cannot otherwise be easily spelled out, as it were. The device that Eliot has consistently used to achieve that end is the literary allusion. The Waste Land is no exception.\n\nThroughout his critical career, Eliot maintained that nothing should be regarded as a substitute for engaging the poem, as poetry, in its own terms. The commentators and readers of poetry in general and of Eliot’s poetry in particular who seem adamant in insisting that his poetry is little more than veiled autobiography may not be missing the point, but they are most certainly missing the poetry. The danger is in imagining that identifying a source in The Waste Land constitutes an understanding of the verse or verses as they appear in that poem. It would be wise to recall Eliot’s own justification, from “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” for having an awareness of voices of the past. It is in the voices of the present that the past speaks most clearly, and that to the only audience that ever can matter, the living. Anything more is guesswork, and anything less is severely restricted by the endless possibilities for other interpretations that offer themselves even as one meaning or interpretation is emerging.\n\nThe Epigraph\n\nAnyone familiar with “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” knows that that poem’s unattributed epigraph, in the original Italian, from Dante’s Divine Comedy is far more than mere window dressing, a showing off of the poet’s erudition. Once identified, contextualized, and translated, Guido da Montefeltro’s words about his condition for speaking freely and truly set the tone for a poem in which another suffering soul, in this case, J. Alfred Prufrock, disburdens himself of the pains of a lifetime of being a wallflower.\n\nOther examples of the importance of the epigraph to the substance of an Eliot poem abound, but “Sweeney among the Nightingales,” with its unattributed epigraph in the original Greek, provides for present purposes one more telling illustration of the epigraph’s importance to an appreciation of the complexities of meaning that Eliot weaves into even a relatively minor work. How else to parallel the shallowness of Sweeney’s moral fiber than to remind readers, once they know that the source of that poem’s epigraph is Aeschylus’s ancient tragedy, the Agamemnon, of how equally shallow were the self-serving motives of Agamemnon for killing his own flesh and blood, his daughter Iphigenia, so that the fleet that he commanded might set sail to lay waste the fabulous city of Troy, all to his own greater glory and wealth? How self-servingly shallow, too, were the motives of his wife, Iphigenia’s mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, Agamemnon’s first cousin, who then took revenge by killing the Greek leader virtually at his doorstep upon his triumphant return from that war some 10 long years later. And so his cry, “I am struck within by a mortal blow,” echoes across the centuries by virtue of Eliot’s giving the words a place and a meaning in a thoroughly modern context in the epigraph to his poem “Sweeney among the Nightingales.”\n\nIf the epigraph matters as much in poems that are otherwise reasonably self-sustaining poetic compositions, how much more it must matter in a poem such as The Waste Land, whose poetry is largely composed quite openly of the poetry of others, with its epigraph in Greek and Latin. The passage, in Latin and Greek, contains a report of what the Cumaean Sibyl is reputed to have said to a group of boys who were taunting her. Translated, it reads: “For I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a bottle, and when the boys said to her, ‘Sibyl, what do you want?’ she replied, ‘I want to die.’ ”\n\nThe Sibyl was originally a single Greek oracle, an elderly woman who wrote her prophecies in ecstatic trances and then would toss to the seeker the leaves on which they were written. It would be up to the seeker, then, to make sense of the prophecy. The Cumaean Sibyl was a later but no less celebrated manifestation of this ancient Greek original. In one of the most famous stories about the Sibyl of Cumae, a Greek settlement near Naples in the south of Italy, she offered the last Roman king a series of nine books containing prophecies regarding Rome, destroying each succeeding one the longer he refused to meet her price, until only three were left. These remained in Rome, in the temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, well into imperial times.\n\nA reader who goes on to discover that The Waste Land, too, deals with a seeker, the Grail quester, and has another famous Greek soothsayer, Tiresias, the blind seer of Sophocles’s Oedipus the King, in its pages, has every right to feel that he or she is on to something. Oedipus, after all, is himself a seeker after the truth, even if he tragically misreads the significance of the Delphic oracle’s prediction that he will murder his father and have children by his own mother, and, like the seeker who must unravel the Sibyl’s tangled messages, he is a solver of riddles to boot, having solved the riddle of the Theban Sphinx. All this information in hand, any reader must feel quite justified in imagining that this epigraph sets just the right tone of a dire seriousness for the theme of the poem to come. The epigraph’s appropriateness in this regard is further underscored if the reader focuses immediately on the Sibyl’s withering reply to the boys’ taunts: “I want to die.” After all, if a quest is one of The Waste Land’s themes, so, apparently, is the poem’s equally heavy attention to the futility of action and to the range and depth of human desire as well, all of which themes the Sibyl’s reply seems to endorse.\n\nThe only problem is that the epigraph that underscores such potential meanings can just as nimbly undercut them. The further information, for example, that the source text for the epigraph is a first-century A.D. Roman social satire, the Satyricon, may undermine a reader’s confidence in the profundity of the epigraph and faith in Eliot’s own intentions for it. Indeed, Eliot is as liable to weave, and is capable of weaving, as tangled a web of potential meanings as any the Sibyl ever has, as anyone who knew the comings and goings of seriousness and frivolity in his poetry would have been well aware by the time of The Waste Land’s publication. If the content of the epigraph sounds profound, the knowledge that the context is a work of satire, traditionally not regarded as serious literature, makes that profundity immediately suspect.\n\nNot only is the epigraph’s source a satire rather than a work of serious literature, but the satire’s title, Satyricon, with its reference to those notorious sexual libertines, the half-men, half-goat satyrs, does not bode well, either, for its being a sober commentary on seeking wisdom and overcoming desire in the midst of life’s vanity and futility. Indeed, the Roman source in question is attributed to Petronius, a wealthy Roman whose main claim to historical fame is that he was the director of revels for the notoriously decadent emperor, Nero, whose sexual and other outrageous exploits remain legendary. Petronius himself led a richly comfortable life as a favorite of the decadent emperor but died a suicide (having slit his wrists, he then went on to regale his friends with witty talk as he slowly bled to death) after he had been falsely accused of conspiring against Nero. About the only substantiated link, such as it is, between Petronius and the passage that Eliot uses as the epigraph to The Waste Land is that Petronius happened to have died at Cumae.\n\nEliot’s readers, the more they come to know of this epigraph, have every right to wonder if they are not being put on, not just by its putative author, Petronius, but by Eliot as well. An Eliot reader’s head ought by now to be spinning, as is often the case of encounters with any Eliot poem written during the first decade and more of his poetic career. The story of this particular epigraph, however, does not end even on this note of compounded double meanings of insidious intent.\n\nLeft for the curious reader is the task if not obligation of finally discovering that, in that allimportant textual area, context, the Sibyl’s withering words to those nasty boys are related in yet another person’s first-person account—confusing, but not unintentionally so. That latter person, Trimalchio, is being quoted by Encolpius, a man whose name in Latin pretty much means “encrotched” and who is himself the Satyricon’s fictitious narrator of a work by an author about whom little is otherwise known (since no one is certain that its author actually was Petronius, after all).\n\nIt may seem by now as if Eliot’s epigraph is a sort of literary black hole, absorbing all meaning whatsoever into its darkening bowels, but there are yet further depths to plumb. Words are not spoken in isolation from events, after all, and that is the case with Trimalchio’s eyewitness report about the Cumaean Sibyl. A very wealthy man who some think may have been modeled somewhat on Nero himself, Trimalchio tells his tale as he regales his guests, Encolpius among them, at a fabulous dinner party.\n\nThe party had begun with Trimalchio’s slaves carrying in a huge pig that was then disemboweled right in front of the assembled guests, who were sent flying as the guts came bursting out. But the joke was all on them, for the “guts” turned out to be cooked sausages. Having fooled his guests to their own delight, it is then that Trimalchio tells them stories of his various other exploits, including the story about seeing the ancient Sibyl, so withered by age that she could fit inside a jug, telling the boys that she wished only for death. What else is anyone to think except that this Trimalchio, famously generous host though he may be, is nothing more than a practical joker and teller of tall tales, among whose repertoire is this tale of his having seen the Cumaean Sibyl “with my own eyes”?\n\nAll is not lost, however, for the epigraph still, ironically enough, comes full circle, reminding the reader of the ancient wisdom that, in the midst of our revels, there is death. The story of the Sibyl hanging in a bottle and wishing only for death is not a happy one, after all, whether it is a true one or not. Furthermore, while Trimalchio’s report is in Latin, the words of the boys and of the Sibyl that he is reporting are in Greek. These words introduce a multilingual poem (seven distinct languages in a variety of dialects are cited directly within it) written some 2,000 years later for an audience that speaks English, itself a language partly derived from Latin and ancient Greek.\n\nIn simple terms, by the time a reader has even begun to try to unravel the substance of the Sibyl’s “meaning” when she says, “I want to die,” and then further attempts to apply that substance to the substance of the text, that reader has already had linguistic instincts and capacities exploited and left unsettled, in very much the same manner in which poetry exploits a reader’s verbal equilibrium and assumptions long before that same reader happily, almost desperately, can attach a meaning to the experience. This is precisely the effect Eliot wishes to have the epigraph achieve: The illusion of meaty meaning in the Sibyl’s words distracts us from the immediate work of the epigraph as a play on the veracity of firsthand observation, particularly as the artist utilizes the device—and that understanding can itself be arrived at only by one’s having complete access not only to understanding the languages of the epigraph in the first place but also to understanding the context of the words as well.\n\nThese kinds of complexities, however, serve a purpose for Eliot and for the complexities of the poem. It is possible, in fact, to read the epigraph not for the specific detail of its content as much as for taking it as a model, a miniature exemplar, of how the text of the poem is to be read. This idea is borne out by the fact that Eliot originally intended to use for the poem’s epigraph a passage from Joseph Conrad’s short novel, Heart of Darkness. In that novel, an anonymous narrator (like Encolpius in the Satyricon) tells the reader what Marlow, a seaman, told him about Kurtz, a fabled ivory trader who apparently went mad in the depths of jungle along the Congo in Africa. So, then, the epigraph from Conrad’s Heart of Darkness that Eliot had originally intended for the poem shares with the passage from the Satyricon nothing more than the fact that it too is a report (in this case thrice removed, once by Marlow, a sort of Trimalchio in this case, and then by the anonymous narrator of the Conrad story, and finally by Conrad) of Kurtz’s last words, which would be the equivalent of what Trimalchio reported the Sibyl to have said: “Did he [Kurtz] live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision,—he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath—‘The horror! the horror!’ ”\n\nThe reader is left to imagine that those were Kurtz’s last words, for they seem to be very much in keeping with the guilt that the reader is also left to imagine that Kurtz must have been suffering as he lay dying. But the reader is only allowed to imagine what Marlow has made of it, and even Marlow’s recollection is filtered through a retelling by Conrad’s anonymous narrator. Furthermore, Kurtz’s cry is reported as being “no more than a breath.” Could Conrad, the fiction’s constructer, be asking us to imagine that it was Kurtz’s breath suspiring, not the words “the horror, the horror,” that Marlow heard, who heard, like all humans do, only generally what he expected to hear, not necessarily what was to be heard?\n\nNo one can speak for Conrad’s intentions, of course, any more than anyone can speak for Trimalchio’s, let alone Encolpius’s, let alone Petronius’s, let alone Eliot’s. Still, it seems that, the similarities between the Conrad and Petronius epigraphs being as structural as they are thematic, the poet of The Waste Land wants his readers to think about the structure as much as about the substance of the statements in both cases. While the reader/listener’s instinct is to take any report at face value, the poet seems to be demonstrating with both choices for epigraph how it is impossible to know another person’s words firsthand, let alone in context, let alone as meaning. And yet in literary experiences, readers foremost derive some species of meaning from the words before they ever consider any other purpose for their particular arrangement.\n\nSo much as a reader or listener can be tricked into assuming meaning where no clearly defined or intended meaning exists, Eliot would say, so much does this drive for meaning master the reader, who is then rendered liable to being tricked continuously, at least as he or she reads an Eliot poem, particularly The Waste Land. In his poetry, Eliot simply uses the neutral territory of language in action (and often other people’s language) to prove as much to the reader, should he or she care to take notice. The fact is that a reader is drawn toward the meaning toward which the artist wishes to draw the reader, but that is not necessarily the meaning the poet is himself aiming to achieve or exploit. Like all art forms, after all, poetry works on the reader before that person can determine whether the poem is enjoyable, let alone whether it is intelligible.\n\nEliot the poet/critic would later say, in The Use of Poetry, that the poet puts meaning into his poetry in much the same way that the burglar puts out a bit of meat for the guard dog, and that is to distract the reader while the poem does its “real work” on him or her. It is no accident certainly that this analogy of Eliot’s equates meaning with meat, for it would be like Eliot to play with the popular notion that meaning is the muscle of poetry to which technique and structure are merely genetic code and circulatory system. Physiologically speaking, muscle is vital but not primary. So with meaning in poetry, in Eliot’s view, who goes on to say that there are still poets who do not even care that much for meaning and who become instead “impatient of this ‘meaning’ which seems superfluous, and perceive possibilities of intensity through its elimination.” One must wonder what that “real work” that Eliot speaks of might be, and it would not be too far amiss to suggest that it is poetry’s capacity to demonstrate vividly how meaning is arrived at, whatever the meaning might be, rather than to express a particular meaning to the exclusion of any other.\n\nAs much is illustrated in the curious case of the poem’s original title. This information became widely known in 1971, when the poet’s widow, Valerie Eliot, published the original manuscript of The Waste Land, as it had been considerably edited and revised by the poet’s then-wife, Vivien, and his friend and literary confidante, the fellow expatriated American poet, Ezra Pound. After the poem’s publication, Eliot had sent the manuscript, in October 1922, as a gift to John Quinn, a New York businessman, in recognition of Quinn’s continuing patronage and support of Eliot on the New York publishing scene. On Quinn’s death in July 1924, this fascinating piece of 20th-century literary history passed into relative obscurity until October 1968 when the New York Public Library, which had acquired the manuscript from a grandniece of Quinn’s, made public its existence.\n\nAlong with providing details such as, for example, Eliot’s initial plan to use the passage from Heart of Darkness for his epigraph (a plan that Pound talked him out of, leading Eliot to substitute the present epigraph from Petronius), Valerie Eliot’s later scholarly reproduction of the lost manuscript in book form was a genuine publishing event that provided scholars with a veritable treasure trove of new information, including the information that the poem was first titled He Do the Police in Different Voices. Fortunately, Valerie Eliot’s studious notes provided scholars with the precise source for such a quaint title, which, like so much else in a typical Eliot poem, turned out to be a literary allusion.\n\nThe sentence comes from Charles Dickens’s novel Our Mutual Friend and is spoken by one character, an impoverished widow, about a young boy whom she has adopted. In describing how much of a joy the boy, Sloppy, has become for her, she says: “You mightn’t think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices.” In essence, she is saying that Sloppy reads her the police report section of the newspaper, and when he does, he changes his voice to characterize each of the different individuals being quoted by the reporter in each news item.\n\nThe idea, a fairly simple one, put Eliot scholars into high gear competing with each other in using this information as if it were a secret formula by which they could now unravel the complexities of one of the most enigmatic poems ever written. After all, and not surprisingly, there were connections among the line from Dickens, the novel itself, and the poem (and does not Eliot, in the poem, urge his readers not to be like his speaker who can “connect nothing with nothing”?). For one thing, then, The Waste Land, with its occasional emphasis on the forlorn and frustrated lives of the lower classes—Madam Sosostris and the young man carbuncular, Lil and Albert and the typist home at teatime—gives his readers a sort of police report world where people suffer from and with each other over their modest peccadilloes. (And in the earliest versions of the poem, before Pound severely edited the text back, there was much, much more of that kind of material.) Furthermore, for all that they are classical myths, the stories of rapes and mutilations and murders that fill the pages of Sophocles and Ovid are also the stuff of police reports, such as they are. Like Sloppy, then, The Waste Land as well does “the Police in different voices.”\n\nFurthermore, Our Mutual Friend has an ostensible theme that also resonates with the ostensible theme of The Waste Land, that is, finding riches in the debris of the past. For at the center of the conflict in Our Mutual Friend is the question of who will inherit mounds of ashes left behind by a man who has been a trash collector all his life— the thought being, no one knew what incredible treasures he or she might find by sifting through the rubbish.\n\nOnce these connections between Our Mutual Friend and The Waste Land were made public in the flurry of reviews that had followed the publication of Valerie Eliot’s work, they seemed so obvious that it was hard for many to imagine that The Waste Land had not finally been deciphered. However, such euphoria did not last very long. If any scholarly career was eventually made by this particular critical escapade, it was made by the scholar who cried out, “Hold on, now!” To imagine that Eliot intended The Waste Land to do and to mean just this and just that because Our Mutual Friend included just this and just that was no less imagining, no less speculating, no less second-guessing. Thus ended the case of just what could be learned from the fact that Eliot had originally planned to call the poem He Do the Police in Different Voices.\n\nThis is a good lesson for any reader of The Waste Land to keep in mind as he or she ventures into the poem: To discover a source is not to discover a meaning. It may help circumscribe the possibilities for how far a meaning may be extended, but even then, someone else, not armed with the same source material, is no less likely to discover meanings as well. Sources, in other words, may have meant a great deal to the author and may continue to be meaningful experiences for the scholar to explore and perhaps exploit, but the less a reader is mindful of them, the more the poem itself becomes the thing itself, as it should be.\n\nWhat, then, the frustrated student of Eliot’s first truly major work and one of the major literary achievements in English of the 20th century is liable to ask, is the purpose of all those source signposts that Eliot sprinkles liberally, to say the least, throughout his famously difficult text. Why make such a point of the poem’s being a combining of sources if to know the sources is not the point? But does Eliot in fact isolate each source, or does he assimilate them all into the far greater whole called The Waste Land, which is its own work with its own purposes? The fact of the matter is that Eliot is not hanging wallpaper. Eliot is a poet who has blended all these various sources and others never to be known so well into a unique creation of his own, its own, that scholars are, to this day, still finding new sources for those old lines. What else should that tell the frustrated Eliot scholar but that the sources are many things, the poem but one? When in doubt, stick to the poem and the poetry that it has made into its own self, whatever the original source may have been.\n\nThat said, there is still one other item of front matter to be considered, and that is the dedication to Ezra Pound. It too has a story, and that story will lead the reader to still another source, in this case a major one for Eliot—Dante.\n\nThe Dedication and Eliot’s Use of Dante\n\nThe dedication to The Waste Land is made to Ezra Pound, the American poet who had befriended the younger Eliot almost from the time of the latter’s arrival in London in 1914 and who had taken it on himself to help foster Eliot’s burgeoning literary career. Pound’s editorial advice had a great deal to do with the final shape of The Waste Land as a completed poetic composition. It should not be too surprising, then, to discover that, in the dedication, Eliot praises his mentor Pound by calling him “the better maker.”\n\nNo doubt, the finest compliment that one craftsman can pay another—and poets, like any other artists, are foremost craftsmen—is that the other is better at what they both do. As a poet and critic, not only was Pound an individual to whom Eliot turned constantly with early drafts of poems such as the quatrains, for example, and most assuredly with the original draft of The Waste Land, seeking his response and the benefit of his editorial judgment and acumen, but Pound’s was also a forceful and authoritative personality. His advice, no doubt, was neither given nor taken lightly. Not only that, but Eliot applied Pound’s advice with a liberal hand. Entire sections of The Waste Land as Eliot had initially conceived the poem were scrapped at Pound’s suggestion, and the history of the two poets’ editorial collaboration remains an interesting chapter in textual criticism. So, then, whatever other motives may have compelled Eliot to make the comparison, it seems fitting for Eliot to have praised his friend and to have acknowledged his contribution by not merely dedicating The Waste Land to Pound, but by declaring him to be the better poet, or at least craftsman, as well.\n\nThe only problem is that the dedication, which is in Italian, il miglior fabbro, is itself a literary allusion, in this case to Dante’s Purgatorio, the second part of his great masterpiece, The Divine Comedy. Dante is one of those poets whom Eliot himself has identified as being among his literary models from his undergraduate days, and, for just one outstanding example of Eliot’s admiration for Dante, “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” has for its unattributed epigraph a passage from Dante’s Inferno, the first part of the Comedy. Once more, then, it should come as no surprise that, in a poem in which Eliot alludes to almost every major literary tradition and/or master up to his day (the list is long but includes, in addition to Dante, Sophocles, Ovid, Shakespeare, and CHARLES BAUDELAIRE, to give some brief sense here of its breadth and scope), Eliot should use the words of a master such as Dante to compliment that living poet, Pound, whom he apparently regards as his own master.\n\nAnother problem is, however, that Eliot’s use of Dante in The Waste Land does not stop there. Indeed, although disguised innocuously as nothing more than an erudite and appropriately accurate dedication to a fellow poet, the dedication, once it is put in the larger context of Eliot’s use of Dante in the total poem, serves a much broader thematic purpose. Maybe it is just the waste-not, want-not Yankee frugality of Eliot’s New England forebearers that made Eliot give his dedication a double purpose, but it is far more likely that it is merely another way for Eliot to illustrate, and to drive home, The Waste Land’s essential point: that there is nothing in a poem or on the page that does not contribute to what readers call, for lack of a better word, that elusive commodity known as “meaning.” To appreciate just how much even the dedication to The Waste Land, by virtue of its allusion to Dante, contributes to that poem’s meaning, it will first be necessary to locate the words of the dedication from Dante, “il miglior fabbro,” in the Dante poem.\n\nAs already mentioned, the phrase comes from Dante’s Purgatorio and is spoken to Dante by Guido Guinizzelli, whom he encounters in canto 26 of the Purgatorio, where Guido is suffering in purgative or refining, as opposed to infernal or damning, fires to be cleansed of the sin of a bestial carnality. When Guido inquires why Dante is apparently an admirer of his, Dante tells Guido that he admires him for his “sweet verses” that will be treasured “as long as modern usage endures.” It is at that moment that Guido declines the compliment, however, and points out to Dante another poet suffering in the same fires for sins of carnality, telling Dante that that one was “was a better craftsman [miglior fabbro] in the mother tongue.” The poet so honored by Dante through Guido’s compliment is none other than Arnaut Daniel, the greatest of the 13th-century Provençal troubadors, on whose work Dante had modeled his own love poetry. Furthermore, Arnaut Daniel was a poet whom Pound, in the earliest phases of his own career as both a language scholar and poet, had also studied and translated. Eliot puts himself in the dedication in the position of both Guido and, by extension, Dante, then, by not only praising Pound as the better modern poet but by comparing him favorably to Pound’s, and Dante’s, own poetic idol, Arnaut Daniel.\n\nIf Eliot’s use of Dante in The Waste Land stopped there, the dedication would be a rich and multilayered enough literary tribute from one poet to another, but things do not stop there by any means. In fact, they instead come full circle. To understand and appreciate, however, exactly how they do that, it is necessary to map out, quite literally, the subsequent uses that Eliot makes of Dante in The Waste Land.\n\nThe analogy to a map is a fitting one, inasmuch as both The Divine Comedy and The Waste Land are spatial in concept, each depending for its structural integrity in large part on its being designed as the representation of a journey or quest. In Dante’s case, it is a quest for spiritual enlightenment and eternal salvation within the rubrics of an orthodox, Western Christian theology. In Eliot’s, it is a quest for meaning within the disorienting chaos resulting from the counterclaims of tradition and modernity in the secular wasteland of post-Christian Europe. In either case, for the metaphor of the quest to be convincing, it must make its passage through the physical realities of a self-defined space, a geography, as it were, even if that space is fictional in its conceptualization, as much as through the lines of verse on the page.\n\n. In Dante’s case, his protagonist, whom he portrays as himself at the midpoint in his life, actually traverses the environs of the pit that is hell and then mounts the physical mountain that is purgatory. In Eliot’s case, his protagonist, who manifests himself largely as the speaker that comments from time to time on the flow of the action, must traverse a psychological wasteland, a desert of the mind and soul that is no less real a geographical space simply because it cannot be found on any map. Appropriately, then, the first allusion to Dante comes reasonably early in The Waste Land, near the close of the first part, “The Burial of the Dead,” and from a point in the Dante text relatively near, as well, to the beginning not only of that lengthy poem but of the first, critical steps of Dante’s journey of discovery, his descent into the Inferno.\n\nThough these first two allusions to Dante in Eliot’s text come back to back, lines 63 and 64 in the first section of The Waste Land, they are separated by nearly the length of a canto in Dante (approximately 150 lines). In The Waste Land, the immediate context is the moment at which, subsumed by the “brown fog of a winter dawn,” the speaker makes his way over London Bridge with a crowd of other early morning office workers and such. (Though this famous bridge has long since been replaced, its counterpart leads across the Thames into the City of London proper, not only the site of the original Roman settlement but the present-day commercial, financial, and administrative center of the metropolis. Not far from the bridge’s terminus in the city, for example, was the Exchange as well as the offices of Lloyds Bank, where Eliot was employed at the time.)\n\nTo depict this crowd of the nameless, faceless bureaucratic and clerical types who have come to be the heirs of city directors, as Eliot will allude to them later in the poem, he draws on two images from Dante’s Inferno. The first occurs in Dante’s Inferno, canto III, lines 55–57, not long, that is, after Dante has passed through the infernal portal with the ominous injunction, “abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” The first sinners he sees are a swarm of faceless, nameless humanity. These are the Opportunists, those who in life had been neither hot nor cold so that in death heaven will not take them and hell does not want them. There are so many of them that Dante says “ch’io non avrei mai creduto / che morte tanta n’avesse disfatta” (“I would never have believed / that death would have undone so many of them”), a sentiment that Eliot echoes in line 63 of The Waste Land: “I had not thought death had undone so many.”\n\nLine 64 echoes the moment shortly later in the Inferno, canto IV, lines 25–27, when Dante stands at the edge of the precipice overhanging the immense abyss that is hell. At that moment he says, “Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare, / non avea pianto, ma’ che di sospiri, / che l’aura eternal facevan tremare” (“There, according to what could be heard, / there was not weeping but sighs / that made the eternal air tremble”). Eliot, according to his own notes, paraphrases the sentiments of that moment in the Inferno with his own observation that “sighs short and infrequent” were being exhaled by the crowd flowing over London Bridge. These lines from early on in beginning cantos of the Inferno are set as markers along the way and come near the beginning, too, of Eliot’s speaker’s own journey through his personal, modernist Inferno, The Waste Land.\n\nThe next allusion to Dante comes from near the beginning of the Purgatorio, the middle section of Dante’s journey, at the end of canto V, in line 133. In Eliot, meanwhile, it falls at the end of the middle section of The Waste Land, “The Fire Sermon.” “The Fire Sermon,” of the five sections of The Waste Land, is the most explicit about the vagaries of human desire, especially and explicitly sexual desire. At the point in this section where the allusion to Dante occurs, the reader encounters quoted dialogue, apparently of a young woman, who is relating how she was born at Highbury but “undone”—that is, sexually compromised by a young man—in a canoe on the Thames between Richmond and Kew: “Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew / Undid me.”\n\nAccording to Eliot’s notes, this line and a half of verse echoes a passage in the Purgatorio, where a woman, who identifies herself as “la Pia,” which may be her name or an attribute (in Italian, it would mean “the pious woman”), asks Dante to remember her when he returns to be among the living, telling him:\n\nRicorditi di me, che son la Pia;\n\nSiena mi fé, disfecemi Maremma. . . .\n\n[Remember me, who is la Pia;\n\nSiena made me, Maremma unmade me. . . .]\n\nSienese by birth, Pia goes on to tell Dante that the man who “did her in” in Maremma, as it were, was the same who had placed the ring on her finger, that is, her spouse. So, then, while Pia’s exact historical identity remains a matter of scholarly controversy, Eliot clearly makes her his marker at this point in The Waste Land because she represents another woman undone in one way or another in order to satisfy a man’s “needs.”\n\nThe next allusion to Dante in the Eliot poem, and the next to last, comes very close to the end of The Waste Land but falls very near the conclusion of the Inferno, in this case the next-to-last canto of the Inferno, canto 33. At first glance, that may seem odd. If the speaker’s progress through The Waste Land is being marked by Dante’s parallel progress through the Inferno on into the Purgatorio, as witnessed thus far, it may seem to be backtracking for the speaker of The Waste Land to have fallen back into the Inferno again. However, such a vacillation between the one and the other—near the end of the Inferno, at the beginning of the Purgatorio— could be regarded as a more realistic rendering, by Eliot, of the stop-and-start, back-and-forth nature of spiritual or moral progress and growth, which is never a perfectly straight line.\n\nWhatever the case, this particular allusion to Dante’s Inferno is one of the most memorable from a particularly memorable poem. As he traverses the frozen lake, Cocytus, which lies at the very bottom of hell and comprises Circle Nine, where the sins of compound fraud or betrayal are punished, Dante comes on a man who is gnawing on the head of another man, both of whom are otherwise frozen up to their necks in the ice. The man doing the gnawing is Count Ugolino, his victim Archbishop Ruggieri, although in life their roles had been somewhat reversed. Ugolino stops chewing on Ruggieri’s head long enough to tell Dante the story of how the count and his young sons had been imprisoned in a tower by the archbishop’s trickery.\n\nIn and of itself, however, that was not the cause of the hellish retribution that the count is now being permitted to mete out to the archbishop. Ugolino describes the day that, at the time when they would normally bring Ugolino and his sons their meager prison rations, he heard instead his jailers turning the key to lock the single door to the tower—“io sentí chiavar l’uscio di sotto / a l’orribile torre” (XXXIII.45–46). Although his sons did not realize it at the moment, the count knew that they were now going to be left in the tower to starve to death, which they then did, one by one, the count dying last. Now both he and the archbishop are here in the very same circle of hell for their sins, and Ugolino is allowed to wreak such a perverse justice as Dante had just witnessed on the man who, in life, had made Ugolino and his sons suffer such a slow and horrible death by starvation.\n\nEliot’s allusion to this poignant episode from the Inferno itself has a place of honor in The Waste Land. Eliot uses it to define by analogy the second of the third injunctions from the Upanishads that form the core of the fifth and last section of The Waste Land, “What the Thunder Said.” That second injunction, Damyadhvam, to sympathize, is symbolized by Eliot in the count’s having “heard the key / Turn in the door,” signaling for him how he and his sons are being cut off forever from the gifts of human compassion. Once more, fittingly, this allusion comes near the end of The Waste Land—lines 411 and 412 of a 433-line poem. If the first two allusions to Dante came from early in the Inferno and come early in The Waste Land, then, despite the momentary springing forward into the beginnings of the Purgatorio, this late allusion to Dante comes from near the end of the Inferno and at the very end of The Waste Land.\n\nBut there is one more allusion to Dante before The Waste Land ends a mere 21 lines later. Line 427 is a direct quotation from Dante’s poem and one of those fragments that the speaker, with “the arid plain behind him,” now uses as “shor[ing] against my ruins.” The line from Dante in question reads, Poi s’sacose nel foco che gli affina (“Then he hid himself in the fire that is purging him”). Its exact placement in Dante is line 148, the last line, of canto 26 of the Purgatorio.\n\nThat ought to give any reader pause. As The Waste Land ends, the symbolic markers of forward progress that allusions to Dante have provided suddenly take a quantum leap forward—from canto 33 of the Inferno to canto 26 of the Purgatorio—as if now that the speaker, having received the guid ance of the rain-bringing thunder, has the wasteland behind him, there is no further vacillation and he is free to make his way past the modern hell in which the poetry of The Waste Land had had him embroiled till now. That is, one must admit, a wonderful symmetry, but Eliot is not done yet. If the foregoing has been something of a demonstration of how Eliot uses allusions not to show off his learning but to underscore his poem’s meaning, such as it is, it should mainly serve as a demonstration of the delightfully rewarding complexities of structure and insinuation those same allusions serve.\n\nThe final allusion to Dante is spoken in regard to Arnaut Daniel, who has just greeted Dante after Guido Guinizzelli had called Daniel to Dante’s attention as the “miglior fabbro”—the better maker or craftsperson—the same words that Eliot used in the dedication to Ezra Pound. Indeed, the quotation from Dante in the dedication (one that Eliot, in his notes, does not attribute, by the way) comes a mere 31 lines—canto 26, line 117—before the line from Dante, canto 26, line 148, on which The Waste Land, lacking but six lines, virtually ends.\n\nWhat is Eliot up to, the reader might well ask. This is one of those many instances where Eliot’s renowned and often unduly annoying complexities become disarmingly simple. The separation between the poet and the identity of the speaker in The Waste Land is a murky one. Indeed, there are those who will argue that The Waste Land has no speaker or at least one who is consistent from part to part, stanza to stanza. Unlike Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” where the speaker is easily identified as Prufrock, or, for the sake of contrast, “Whispers of Immortality,” where the speaker is clearly the poet, The Waste Land is a poetry more in keeping with “Portrait of a Lady” or “La Figlia che Piange,” in which it is difficult to discern if the “I” is the poet or a fictive projection that he simply has not taken the trouble to introduce and identify by name and function.\n\nThat said, with his dedication, Eliot is telling his readers, or at least those who recognize it as an allusion to Dante’s Purgatorio, that as The Waste Land opens and they are about to make their own descent into the hell that The Waste Land will depict in excruciatingly nightmarish detail, he, the poet and their guide, has already been there and made it out—has figuratively completed the Inferno as well as the better part of the Purgatorio, that is to say; otherwise, he would not be able to cite from it. If, then, by the end of The Waste Land, the speaker identifies the same passage from Dante as the poet had identified in his opening dedication, that is Eliot’s way of confirming for his readers that they, too, have now successfully made their way out of the hellishness that The Waste Land is intended to portray and, like him and his speaker, stand near the peak of Dante’s purgatorial mountain.\n\nThe following analysis of the poem, section by section, demonstrates that The Waste Land takes its readers on a hellish journey for the sake of bringing them, like Dante, to some point of positive recognition that the hell of self can be mastered and left behind. The question is, How?\n\nA Note on the Notes\n\nNo doubt, there are still those who hold up the six or seven pages of author’s notes that follow The Waste Land as proof positive that Eliot must have regarded the completed poem as unintelligible without them. Only the poem’s earliest readers, that is, those who had the opportunity to read it when it was first published, in October 1922, in two reviews, the Criterion and the Dial, will ever know what the experience of encountering The Waste Land’s decidedly complex text must have been like without the benefit of Eliot’s notes. On the other hand, it has long since been recognized that the notes, by calling attention to any one particular detail at the expense of another in a richly detailed tapestry of allusions and other poetic devices, may as often be a hindrance to understanding and clarity as a help.\n\nNo one wants to approach The Waste Land unattended; still, it is unfortunate that that privilege has forever been denied readers once Eliot introduced his notes into the poem, with its publication in book form in December 1922. By now, the notes form as much of the experience of the poem as its lines of poetry, almost as if Eliot had always intended them to be a part of the poetic effect of The Waste Land from the first.\n\nWhatever other reputation for often intentionally obfuscating the obvious that Eliot may deservedly have earned by now, however, his notes came to be appended to the text of The Waste Land completely by happenstance and most assuredly without any subtle motivation on his part. The story goes, and there is no reason to doubt its veracity, that when Boni & Liveright was preparing The Waste Land for publication in book form in late 1922, they discovered that there would be a quantity of extra pages. That was because the text of the poem would fill only 48 pages. To this day, the typical trade book is printed in a format to produce the standard 6 × 9-inch size. This book size is achieved by printing 16 pages at a time on each side of a 24 inch × 36-inch sheet that is then folded four times, so that each finished page is one-16th of the original size of the sheet. These 32-page units, which are subsequently trimmed back at the top, bottom, and outside edges so that they can be opened properly after binding, are called signatures. Once the text of The Waste Land was set in type, it was discovered that it would fill only 48 finished pages, but it would have to be printed in two signatures nevertheless, leaving 16 pages blank. Eliot was prevailed on to provide some additional poetry to complete the volume. He opted, however, to provide the notes instead, hoping, as he says, that they might assist “any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble.”\n\nThat is not to say, nevertheless, that Eliot may not have eventually employed the notes as much to misdirect as to direct. The question remains whether he did so intentionally. Scholars have subsequently discovered many more possible sources and alternatives to sources for lines that Eliot himself identified than Eliot’s notes could have listed in the space allowed him. Still, one must question what mode of selection Eliot may have employed in determining what to omit, what only to point toward, and what to expatiate on in painstaking detail. Every choice, of course, shapes the response that the reader and the scholar formulate to the line or the source in question—a prejudicing of the evidence, as it were, that someone of Eliot’s astuteness and acute intelligence would have been highly aware.\n\nIn the following discussion, to identify a source of Eliot’s, the notes will be relied on for the most part, and it will be only when there is a powerful suggestiveness to look elsewhere—for example, the reference to the Starnbergersee, which calls up King Ludwig of Bavaria, or the reference to Marie, that seems to be a reference to the tragic suicides at Mayerling—that sources not identified by Eliot will be introduced into the discussion.\n\nIncidentally, Eliot does not always identify an obvious source or provide an expected one. For example, the absence of an identification of a source for the epigraph is singularly conspicuous. For another example, Eliot does not let the reader in on the inside joke that the dedicatory words to Pound allude to the same passage from Dante alluded to elsewhere in the poem. That the title of the first part, “The Burial of the Dead,” is apparently taken from the Anglican burial service of the same name, is also not noted. Identifying the alleged allusion to Chaucer in the opening line, meanwhile, is left up to the agility of the reader’s imagination.\n\nStill, anyone doubting the story of how the notes came to be there in the first place—that they were provided by Eliot to fill what would otherwise have been blank space—need only compare the number of pages occupied by the notes with the number of pages occupied by the poem itself. The ratio should come out at just about one to three, accounting for the same proportionality that would have resulted if there indeed were those 16 blank pages to account for out of two 32-page signatures, leaving 48 pages of poetry.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThe following is a section-by-section if not quite line-by-line reading of The Waste Land. This reading is designed to be consistent and coherent, but not exhaustive. To be exhaustive, a treatment of the poem would easily take a volume equal in size to this present one, and even then it could not possibly take into account in any genuinely satisfactory manner all the various other commentaries that the poem has generated virtually from the day of its first publication.\n\nPart I: “The Burial of the Dead”\n\nThus far, the information being presented has had a single aim, and that has been to prepare a novice reader of The Waste Land for the experience of its poetry without unnecessarily daunting that reader before he or she even begins. With the achievement of that aim in mind, such a reader will find useful as well the following characterization of the approach to the text of The Waste Land that is about to ensue. That approach is to think of The Waste Land as a verbal space, literally—a wilderness of words and word-images, allusions and literary sound bytes, nonsense syllables and foreign words and phrases, and anything else that may come to mind or eye or ear. Just as the poem’s speaker will have to, the reader too must traverse that imaginary space with only one goal in mind—surviving the experience so that, by poem’s end, he or she may sit on the shore, like the speaker, with the arid plain behind them both.\n\nIf a single principle can be isolated from all those foregoing presentations made thus far regarding The Waste Land, it would be that the richness and complexity of the poetry of The Waste Land should never be sacrificed for the sake of a facile reliance on stringing together the semblance of meaning by treating the wealth of background and source information as if it were the poem. It simply is not. However, a corollary principle has emerged, and that is that Eliot does rely on his readers’ having some sense of those general cultural reference points within the various texts and figures to which he calls attention by virtue of the poem’s many allusions. The danger would be to imagine that there might ever be a one-for-one connection between these allusions as they operate in their original sources and as they operate in Eliot. There is likely no better place to begin to demonstrate the validity of this corollary principle than with the opening line, which has traditionally been regarded as a direct allusion to the opening lines of Geoffrey Chaucer’s 15th-century English treasure, The Canterbury Tales.\n\nSo complicated has the issue of Eliot’s use of literary and other allusions in The Waste Land become, however, that even the title of the first part of the Eliot poem, “The Burial of the Dead,” needs first to be quickly considered and then as quickly dismissed as an allusion to the funeral service from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. That service is indeed called the Burial of the Dead and, like any item of great liturgical interest, purpose, and history, it no doubt has in it much powerful and beautiful language, not to mention powerful and moving sentiments as well. Raised in his ancestors’ Unitarian traditions, Eliot would, later in the 1920s, begin to attend Anglican services and eventually convert to the Anglican church in 1927. Finally, as the actively intelligent, engaged, and curious human being that he was, Eliot would have known something of the Book of Common Prayer, even if that were only for its literary, historical, and cultural importance to English-speaking peoples.\n\nStill, and all that said, it is pure speculation that Eliot had that source in mind at the moment that he selected the title for the first section of The Waste Land and, furthermore, even should it be proved conclusively that he did, the question remains whether it is necessary for a reader to have that information in order to feel the impact and import of the words, “the burial if the dead,” particularly in terms of the tone and the mood that they set for the poem that is to follow. “Of course not,” is the only fair answer that could be made to that speculative question, and that is the very point that Eliot makes by leaving so many putative allusions, including this present one, unattributed. The accidentals of reading and memory and writing surely play a part in anyone’s use of language. Words may come to mind in a particular order or echoing a particular source as much for their rhythms as for their initial meaning or source. In the case of Eliot, this particular horse—that every word must have its specific source, every source its specific implication for meaning—is one that cannot possibly be beaten to death too often inasmuch as it is the phoenix of dead horses and has a way of becoming an interpretative nightmare to boot.\n\nThat said, it is fair to examine the poem’s celebrated opening clause, “April is the cruelest month,” with the same spirit of skeptical reservation when it comes to imagining that that opening image, such as it is, is an allusion to Chaucer. The General Prologue to his celebrated collection of tales, in Middle English, told to each other by a band of pilgrims on their fictitious journey to Canterbury to visit the shrine to the martyred 13thcentury saint Thomas à Becket, opens by setting the following springtime scene:\n\nWhan that aprill with his shoures soote\n\nThe droghte of march hath perced to the roote,\n\nAnd bathed every veyne in swich licour\n\nOf which vertu engendred is the flour;\n\n. . . . .\n\nThanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe hooly blisful martir for to seke,\n\nThat hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.\n\n[When April with his showers sweet\n\nThe drought of March had pierced to the root,\n\nAnd bathed every vine in such liquid\n\nOf which virtue engendered is the flower;\n\n. . . . .\n\nThen long folks to go on pilgrimages, . . . . .\n\nThe holy blissful martyr for to seek,\n\nThat them had helped when they were sick.]\n\nEqually celebrated by now are the opening seven lines of The Waste Land, which describe April as the “cruelest month” because the spring rain breeds “lilacs out of the dead land” and stirs with a quickening liveliness “dull roots” that would otherwise apparently be content to remain sluggishly embedded in their wintry torpor. To this mix of the conflict between an awakening natural universe and what, in Chaucer’s time, would have been called acedia, a tragic slothfulness of the spirit resulting in a disengagement from the processes of life, Eliot also adds how April mixes “memory and desire,” the longing for a past contentment, perhaps, contending with that same promise of new life, new activities, springing into being. The point seems to be that, for the speaker or observer of the event, that promise is clearly not necessarily a welcome one, since its aim is to rouse the sleeper out of the cocoon of acedia. The idea being promoted with little fanfare or argument as the poem begins, then, is essentially one that the spirit, much like the body or mind, is reluctant to be wakened, so April is “cruel” by awakening all living things whether they wish it or not.\n\nThis is not to say that there may not be good reason for imagining that Eliot wants his readers at the outset to be thinking of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims, if only for the sake of contrasts. They, after all, have a fixed goal and purpose in mind. The reader of The Waste Land will discover quickly that if there is a protagonist inhabiting the lines of The Waste Land, his or her most outstanding characteristic is aimlessness and confusion of purpose or direction. Even so, the ability to make even that sort of a connection with Chaucer would require some familiarity with Chaucer to begin with. That familiarity absent, the question would then be, Would that ignorant reader obtain a meaning of some sort from Eliot’s words about April and the spring rain, dull roots, and dried tubers? The answer to such a question could be nothing less than a resounding yes.\n\nFor example, in the headnote that precedes the notes at the end of the poem, Eliot states that JESSE L. WESTON’s study, From Ritual to Romance, a work of fairly recent scholarship that had theorized that the origins of the Grail legend were to be found in ancient vegetation myths regarding the need for the earth to renew itself in new life after the death of winter, informs “not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism” of The Waste Land. Also involved in the quest for the Grail is the legendary cup from Christ’s last supper, another story involving a journey or pilgrimage. So, then, there are several points of contact in general with the Chaucer poem, but beyond that, they do not seem to point toward any particular meaning or in any particular direction so much as onward.\n\nWhat that particular meaning and direction maybe should be the reader’s entire focus, of course, but Chaucer, having been brought up, must first be laid to rest. In other words, knowing Chaucer’s “meaning” will never clarify Eliot’s. To get past the first line, the reader must get past Chaucer—the reader must bury the dead. Throughout its pages, The Waste Land plays with and, to some degree, virtually milks humankind’s vastest and most common store of symbols and symbolical imagery and actions, those that have to do with life and death, birth and resurrection, sterility and fertility—in summary, the conflict between procreative sex and sexual recreation, as well as another conflict, that one between what has been sapped of all its vital energy and life and that sap that restores all vital energy and life.\n\nIf The Waste Land is a wasteland, the reader comes to feel that it is one because there has been no life-giving rain, there is no water in it, nothing of that sweet liquid that can restore the dead land. That water is the life-giving water celebrated in countless myths from countless human cultures over countless ages, every one of which associates life with the supple and the quickened, and death with the dried out or desiccated and the dulled, the numbed. April is indeed the cruelest month, then, not because the ghost of Chaucer or of his particular sentiments on the same ageless topic haunt those opening lines of Eliot’s, but because it is that month in which the struggle between the forces of death and the forces of life are there for all to see as most obviously in conflict—provided that one has awakened to see it. Rather than the spirit being willing but the flesh is weak, in April the flesh is willing, but the spirit may be weak, or weakened. Certainly, it may be more willing to sleep than to awaken.\n\nIt is this fear—that this spring there may be not that usual, age-old victory of spring over winter, but rather a defeat for the new life that is awakening, both literally and figuratively—that will permeate the entirety of the remainder of The Waste Land. That is how Eliot is able easily to slip between a poetry that at one moment seems to be a cultural critique of the shortcomings of his own time and, at others, seems to be merely yet another chapter in the enduring human tale of death versus life carried on in the terminology of a symbology as old, perhaps, as the human imagination itself.\n\n“Winter kept us warm,” the speaker, or a speaker, says, and it is perfectly understandable that the winter should have but only if it is the false warmth of the body dying into a paralyzing numbness, not the true warmth of the spirit reviving. No wonder, then, that the poetry moves now very quickly, but not unexpectedly for the reader who has been cued in to what the essential crisis is, to persons who are content to haunt “health” resorts, where they may partake of artificial cures in artificial settings while the real work of the natural universe progresses all about them.\n\nThe reference to the Starnbergersee is particularly appropriate at this juncture. It is at that lake that the so-called crazy King Ludwig of Bavaria, the royal patron who underwrote much of Richard Wagner’s operatic efforts, including his Parsifal, which recounted the Grail legend for 19th-century Germans, not only built his renowned storybook castle that imitates the Grail castle but subsequently drowned himself, a suicide. The reference to Marie, meanwhile, is commonly thought to harken back to Baroness Marie Vestera, the mistress of the Archduke Rudolph of Habsburg, crown prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (and first cousin to the same Archduke Franz-Ferdinand whose subsequent assassination would precipitate the outbreak of hostilities that became World War I). Rudolph and Marie, in one of the most famous scandals of the late 1880s, apparently committed suicide together on January 30, 1889, at his hunting lodge at Mayerling in Austria. Although the truth of the matter may never be known (some argue that he was brutally murdered), there is no doubt that Rudolph’s untimely death began the final series of crises and setbacks, involving matters of succession and alliances, that would bring Europe from the height of its glory as a human culture to the brink of a devastating war within a matter of decades.\n\nInasmuch as Eliot’s intentions are concerned, however, all of the forgoing is purely speculative. What the reader does know is that in the midst of the polyglot activity of winter with which The Waste Land opens, what is missing is any sense of the ancient foreboding: What if the springtime does not come? If, for example, the Grail legend is centered around a wounded king whose wounds must be healed if the land is itself to be healed, a story whose origins are far, far older than Sophocles’s Oedipus the King, then it is none too puzzling that The Waste Land opens with these allusions to “wounded” royals, both of them connected to those two powers, Germany and Austria, that would become the initial aggressors in World War I.\n\nDo myth and reality live so near each other, The Waste Land asks, that one can be seen to blend easily into the other. The Waste Land can ask that question, however, only of the reader who is himself or herself conscious that he or she, too, is a living link in the ever-shifting present that resides between the past that is winter, memory, myth, and a future that could be possibly spring but may only be frustrated by confused signals and mixed desires.\n\nLogically, compellingly enough, into the next stanza in this poem of irregular stanzas and irregular lines, lines that rhyme and lines that end abruptly leading nowhere, suddenly appearing in a foreign tongue only to disappear instantly into another tongue or into an English that itself often seems to make as little sense, as if it too were a language from another land, the wasteland, comes the speaker, speaking clearly but hardly cheerily. This speaker calls the reader directly into the poem, confronting him with dire questions and more dire consequences. In so many words, he tells the reader that, although it may be spring, they are both lost in the wilderness, in a desert that is the wasteland of their mind and spirit and culture.\n\nThus far in this commentary there have been passing references made to a speaker in "
