        "text": "The poem describes a sense of deep disillusionment stemming both from the collective experience of the First World War and from Eliot’s personal troubles. Though Eliot described the poem as “the relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life…just a piece of rhythmical grumbling.” it was seen, and it is now seen to represent a general crisis in western culture. One of its major themes is the barrenness of a post-war world in which human sexuality has been perverted from its normal course and the natural world too has become infertile.\n\nThe critic I. A. Richards – Eliot captured the “sense of desolation, of uncertainty, of futility, of the groundlessness of aspirations, of the vanity of endeavour, and a thirst for a life-giving water which seems suddenly to have failed.”\n\nT S Eliot once read The Waste Land to the Queen Mother as a personal favour. Whenever the reading was subsequently referred to she was less than enthusiastic, commenting: “That Dreadful poem – the Desert?”\n\nPericles Lewis’s Cambridge Introduction to Modernism\n\nDoes the fragmentary nature of the poem merely reflect the randomness and contingency of the world, or, as other readers would have it, does the poem have an overarching structure, or rationale or argument in which some form of salvation is achieved or achievable?\n\nAnthropology had a huge influence on Eliot – the new readings of cultural history, where belief systems were seen to be similar across time and the world, and the need for such was being understood. So, can the Waste Land be read as a declaration that such beliefs, the old beliefs that inform Christianity and all religions, are essential, and even the only solution to modern man’s plight?\n\nConrad’s Heart of Darkness was very important to Eliot and to the composition of the poem. The poem’s epigraph was to be Kurtz’s “The horror. The horror.” From the end of the novel, but Ezra Pound though it insufficiently weighty. This is a novel that starts out in London – where the Wasteland is set (if it is set in any particular place) – and concerns itself with the moral emptiness at the heart of the modern European enterprise, as well as with the savage beating heart that lies beneath the apparent civility and sophistication of modern life. For Eliot the primal and visceral reality was not to be buried, but to be tapped into, in order to give our modern life a grounding that it did not otherwise have.\n\nConrad’s Heart of Darkness:\n\nDid he live his life again, in every detail of desire, temptation and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision – he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath. ‘The horror! The horror!’\n\nInstead, the epigraph chosen was:\n\n“Nam Sibyllam quidem Cumis ego ipse oculis meis vidi\n\nin ampulla pendere, et cum illi pueri dicerent:Σιβυλλα\n\nτι θελεις; respondebat illa:αποθανειν θελω.”\n\nWhich is taken from the Satyricon by Gaius Petronius. Eliot’s translation:\n\n“I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl at Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said to her: “Sibyl, what do you want?” she answered: “I want to die.””\n\nThe Satyricon tells of the misadventures of a former gladiator through the Roman Empire in the first century A.D. Only fragments of the story still exist. The scene Eliot quotes occurs during a feast at the villa of a wealthy buffoon named Trimalchio. Sibyl of Cumae was a prophetess in service to Apollo and a great beauty. Apollo wished to take her as his lover and offered her anything she desired. She asked to live for as many years as there were grains in a handful of dust. Apollo granted her wish, but still she refused to become his lover. In time, Sibyl came to regret her boon as she grew old but did not die. She lived for hundreds of years, each year becoming smaller and frailer, Apollo having given her long life but not eternal youth. When Trimalchio speaks of her in the Satyricon, she is little more than a tourist attraction, tiny, ancient, confined, and longing to die.\n\nI. THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD\n\nThe opening four lines of the Waste Land:\n\nAPRIL is the cruellest month, breeding\n\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n\nMemory and desire, stirring\n\nDull roots with spring rain.\n\n…are designed to recall the opening lines of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales to the reader’s mind:\n\nWHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote\n\nThe droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,\n\nAnd bathed every veyne in swich licour,\n\nOf which vertu engendred is the flour\n\nWhen April’s gentle rains have pierced the drought\n\nOf March right to the root, and bathed each sprout\n\nThrough every vein with liquid of such power\n\nIt brings forth the engendering of the flower;\n\nEliot is contrasting the cruelty of April in his poem to the sweet showers of April in the Canterbury Tales, which, according to Chaucer soothe the drought of March and bring forth life. The title of this section recalls the section from the English Church’s Common Book of Prayer, which deal with details the service for the dead: modern life is somehow dead, its process cruel, memory and desire both are buried and unpromising, and what comes from the land, if anything, does so unwillingly.\n\nThe negative presentation of spring, traditionally represented in literature as positive a time of new beginnings, of new life, is then contrasted with the winter that preceded it, which is show in a positive light:\n\nWinter kept us warm, covering\n\nEarth in forgetful snow, feeding\n\nA little life with dried tubers.\n\nWhat is it about modern life that is hard to confront, difficult to contend with and almost impossible to embrace with joy? The poet would rather hide away, take shelter, and eke out the most miserable of existences rather than embrace life. There is no virility; life is hollow and painful, offering us nothing. It is better to while away our existence in the dark than confront its full menaing.\n\nThen we are given the second fragment in Eliot’s collage: there is no link with the lines that preceded them; the picture we are presented with, some kind of crass and inane goings on of the Belle Epoch (The Beautful Era) – a social existence on the continent that would always seemed doomed in retrospect, a period characterized by optimism, peace, new technology and scientific discoveries, where the arts flourished, and literature, music, theater, and visual having their heyday. The period was named in retrospect, when it was considered to be something of a golden age in contrast to what went after it – much like the women coming and going in Prufrock talking of Michelangelo: this is the hollow, meaningless existence that the Waste Land is exposing:\n\nSummer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\n\nWith a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\n\nAnd went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\n\nAnd drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\n\nBin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\n\nAnd when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,\n\nMy cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,\n\nAnd I was frightened. He said, Marie,\n\nMarie, hold on tight. And down we went.\n\nIn the mountains, there you feel free.\n\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\n\nThis is life without meaning for Eliot. The deracinated (uprooted from any natural, geographical, social or cultural environment) existence of this class of people had psychosis at its heart; it was freewheeling towards destruction, and was out of sync with the earth’s natural rhythms. It is, to be fair, hardly the worst of early twentieth century life, but it stands for the collapse in any moral order, and a faltering in the meaningful existence of people going back into time immemorial.\n\nThen we launch into a biblical register…\n\nWhat are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\n\nYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only\n\nA heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\n\nAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\n\nAnd the dry stone no sound of water. Only\n\nThere is shadow under this red rock,\n\n(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\n\nAnd I will show you something different from either\n\nYour shadow at morning striding behind you\n\nOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\n\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust.\n\nThe world without water and the world without meaning (without tradition, religion, customs, rituals – anything to inform the world/life with meaning) are presented to us here. the absence of water is symbolic of the absence of meaning / significance. We need water just as we need redemption, but there is neither here. but is he merely commenting on, even bemoaning, or is he actually experiencing (living it) the breakdown in Christianity. The poem can be seen as the poet’s own purgatory – something he ahs to live through in order to find redemption. The final line also recalls the sibyl’s (of the epigraph) request for as many years of life as there are grains of sand – this is life suffered, not life lived. Is the final declaration enough to drive you, the reader/ the poet, to seek redemption?\n\nFrisch weht der Wind\n\nDer Heimat zu,\n\nMein Irisch Kind,\n\nWo weilest du?\n\nWhat is the place in today’s world of the old stories and legends? This is Tristan and Isolde by Wagner, the great romantic tragedy: “The wind blows fresh to the homeland. My Irish girl, where are you lingering?” however, it should be noted that this is a tale of adultery and so of misdirected sexual energy which (rightly?) ends in tragedy.\n\nWe go back to the Wagnerian opera at line 42: Öd’ und leer das Meer – “Empty and desolate the sea” – Is this what modern sexual union and reproduction / fertility (life) has become?\n\n“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\n\nThey called me the hyacinth girl.”\n\n—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\n\nYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\n\nSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\n\nLiving nor dead, and I knew nothing,\n\nLooking into the heart of light, the silence.\n\nÖd’ und leer das Meer.\n\nThe “arms full” and “hair wet” have strong sexual connotations, but any water in this poem is positive – because most of the poem is concerned with the absence of living giving water. But what is this excerpt designed to tell us? is this symptomatic of the feeble attempts of modern man to gain spiritual enlightenment? It recalls the Grail Legend – which Eliot has interwoven into the whole poem – an incident where the searcher for the grail meets the bearer of the grail, but fails to ask the right question.\n\nDo the tarot card readings represent debased religion? Not finding the “hanged man” who traditionally is seen to parallel Christ – who dies for the redemption of mankind – is significant…\n\nMadame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\n\nHad a bad cold, nevertheless\n\nIs known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\n\nWith a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,\n\nIs your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,\n\n(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)\n\nHere is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\n\nThe lady of situations.\n\nHere is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\n\nAnd here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\n\nWhich is blank, is something he carries on his back,\n\nWhich I am forbidden to see. I do not find\n\nThe Hanged Man. Fear death by water.\n\nI see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.\n\nThank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,\n\nTell her I bring the horoscope myself:\n\nOne must be so careful these days.\n\nBut Eliot isn’t dismissing religion, nor is he dismissing the romanticism of Wagner: he is not just satirising the romantic or the sentimental, to bury Romanticism – he is in many respects quite a Romantic poet. Fearing “death by water” is significant here in that this type of death was seen as something which would prefigure or lead to resurrection and the fertility of the land. Modern man is not committing himself to the rituals and rites and traditions of the past, not whole-heartedly – isn’t this the diagnosis of Eliot? So the prognosis would be…? This may well be satire, but does that mean that Eliot lays no store in a religious solution for the Waste Land?\n\nUnreal City,\n\nUnder the brown fog of a winter dawn,\n\nA crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\n\nI had not thought death had undone so many.\n\nSighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\n\nAnd each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\n\nFlowed up the hill and down King William Street,\n\nTo where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\n\nWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\n\nThere I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!\n\nYou who were with me in the ships at Mylae!\n\nThat corpse you planted last year in your garden,\n\nHas it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?\n\nOr has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?\n\nOh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,\n\nOr with his nails he’ll dig it up again!\n\nYou! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\n\nThis phantasmagorical little episode, staring off with a cleverly placed line from Dante’s Divine Comedy – The Inferno, (“such a long steam of people that I should never have believed that death had undone so many” – a vast crowd of unhappy spirits, those who in life know neither good nor evil, who never learnt to care for anyone but themselves) is an example of Eliot seeking out (and finding) historical and literary parallels for his own / our own perceived condition: a whole history of this journey being enacted, and so a kind of recovery as much as a denunciation. It is notable that it is those people who have done nothing constructive with their lives, who have offered nothing, that Eliot reprises here.\n\nThere are also echoes of the following from The Book of Common Prayer: “How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou savest is not quickened except it die” – Corinthians, Order of the Burial of the Dead.\n\nThe sudden explosion of dramatic monologue leads to a strange place. But is there a sign of hope here? “Sprout” / “Bloom”? Is life stirring hopefully in the waste land?\n\nThe final line is from Baudelaire “You hypocrite reader, my likeness, my brother.” Might be read as a rather direct and earnest appeal to the reader to attend to what is being addressed here, and to share in the spiritual journey, the purgatorial experience, through which the writer himself is going through. This is not the vapid dandy Prufrock speaking; this is the real prophet, not the laughable parody of John the Baptist that Prufrock briefly thought himself in the more ridiculous climaxes of his thinking.\n\nII. A GAME OF CHESS\n\nThe Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,\n\nGlowed on the marble, where the glass\n\nHeld up by standards wrought with fruited vines\n\nFrom which a golden Cupidon peeped out\n\n(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)\n\nDoubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra\n\nReflecting light upon the table as\n\nThe glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,\n\nFrom satin cases poured in rich profusion;\n\nIn vials of ivory and coloured glass\n\nUnstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,\n\nUnguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused\n\nAnd drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air\n\nThat freshened from the window, these ascended\n\nIn fattening the prolonged candle-flames,\n\nFlung their smoke into the laquearia,\n\nStirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.\n\nHuge sea-wood fed with copper\n\nBurned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,\n\nIn which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.\n\nAbove the antique mantel was displayed\n\nAs though a window gave upon the sylvan scene\n\nThe change of Philomel, by the barbarous king\n\nSo rudely forced; yet there the nightingale\n\nFilled all the desert with inviolable voice\n\nAnd still she cried, and still the world pursues,\n\n“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.\n\nAnd other withered stumps of time\n\nWere told upon the walls; staring forms\n\nLeaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.\n\nFootsteps shuffled on the stair,\n\nUnder the firelight, under the brush, her hair\n\nSpread out in fiery points\n\nGlowed into words, then would be savagely still.\n\nOpening with a parody of Shakespeare’s Anthony & Cleopatra, this piece of the collage is baroque in its depth of detail, subjecting the reader to a claustrophobic feeling, one of sensory overload, trapped in a woman’s boudoir, stifled by the aesthetic. Here Eliot is presenting the reader with the sexual and emotional aspects of modern man’s spiritual collapse, juxtaposing the wealthy and educated with the poor and uncultured: this is how hollow and meaningless humanity’s sexual relations have become.\n\n“Jug Jug” – is the song of the nightingale, as represented in Elizabethan poetry, but also Elizabethan slang equivalent of the modern “fu*k” – this is another reference to Philomela of ancient myth who was raped by Tereus, her sister’s husband, and had her tongue cut out so that she couldn’t tell anyone of the crime. She was later turned into a nightingale in order to escape Tereus’ wrath once she had taken her revenge (communicating the crime by means of a tapestry, she then conspired with her sister to make Tereus unwittingly eat his own son).\n\n“My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.\n\nSpeak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.\n\nWhat are you thinking of? What thinking? What?\n\nI never know what you are thinking. Think.”\n\nI think we are in rats’ alley\n\nWhere the dead men lost their bones.\n\n“What is that noise?”\n\nThe wind under the door.\n\n“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”\n\nNothing again nothing.\n\n“Do\n\nYou know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember\n\nNothing?”\n\nI remember\n\nThose are pearls that were his eyes.\n\n“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”\n\nBut\n\nO O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—\n\nIt’s so elegant\n\nSo intelligent\n\n“What shall I do now? What shall I do?\n\nI shall rush out as I am, and walk the street\n\nWith my hair down, so. What shall we do to-morrow?\n\nWhat shall we ever do?”\n\nThe hot water at ten.\n\nAnd if it rains, a closed car at four.\n\nAnd we shall play a game of chess,\n\nPressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.\n\n“O O O O” are the final “words” of Hamlet in some early editions of the play and have become a signifier of the tragic death and Shakespearean Tragedy – but it also redolent of the syncopated ragtime rhythm of Jazz that was filling the cafes and dancehalls of London about that time. This is one of the much odd juxtapositions by Eliot – though here working as a pun – to contrast what was once meaningful with what is now shallow.\n\nWhen Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said,\n\nI didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nNow Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.\n\nHe’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you\n\nTo get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.\n\nYou have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,\n\nHe said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.\n\nAnd no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,\n\nHe’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,\n\nAnd if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.\n\nOh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.\n\nThen I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nIf you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said,\n\nOthers can pick and choose if you can’t.\n\nBut if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.\n\nYou ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.\n\n(And her only thirty-one.)\n\nI can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,\n\nIt’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.\n\n(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)\n\nThe chemist said it would be alright, but I’ve never been the same.\n\nYou are a proper fool, I said.\n\nWell, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,\n\nWhat you get married for if you don’t want children?\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nWell, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,\n\nAnd they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nHURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME\n\nGoonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.\n\nTa ta. Goonight. Goonight.\n\nGood night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.\n\nThe marriage ritual should restore life to the wasteland, but we are here presented with a grim parody of the reuniting of the husband and wife.\n\nFor Eliot there was no sustaining sense of values amongst the poor and uneducated (as with the decadent few). Ending with Ophelia’s last words in Hamlet, Eliot’s juxtaposition highlights the relative emptiness and meaninglessness of the scene just narrated: there is nothing significant or meaningful in what has gone on before, in contrast to the words of Ophelia dripping with significance in Shakespeare’s play.\n\nIII. THE FIRE SERMON\n\nThis is a transitional section in the poem, from suffering, through purgation and towards nirvana. The Fire Sermon is preached by the Buddha against the fires of lust and other passions that consume men, suffered here amidst the\n\nRecalling Edmund Spencer’s Prothalamion – a nuptial song / poem composed at the end of the sixteenth-century on the occasion of the marriage of the two daughters of the Earl of Worcester, which begins with description of the river Thames where he comes across two beautiful maidens who he wishes well for their marriages. However running through Eliot’s modern day version of such a poem runs a line form Marvel’s To His Coy Mistress – “But at my back… I hear” repeated twice: the line which follows this in the Marvel poem is “Time’s wingéd chariot hurrying near” which, along with other notes and hints and images, such as the lamentations of the Israelites in exile in Babylon (by the waters… [of Babylon] I sat down and wept”), undermines the festive sense of Spencer’s poem – a poem celebrating an elaborate court marriage. And then to follow this with more images of the modern waste land, recalling the trenches and carnage of World War One, interspersed with images of death from Shakespeare’s final play The Tempest.\n\nThe river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\n\nClutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\n\nCrosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.\n\nSweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\nThe river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\n\nSilk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\n\nOr other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.\n\nAnd their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;\n\nDeparted, have left no addresses.\n\nBy the waters of Leman I sat down and wept…\n\nSweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,\n\nSweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.\n\nBut at my back in a cold blast I hear\n\nThe rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\n\nA rat crept softly through the vegetation\n\nDragging its slimy belly on the bank\n\nWhile I was fishing in the dull canal\n\nOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse.\n\nMusing upon the king my brother’s wreck\n\nAnd on the king my father’s death before him.\n\nWhite bodies naked on the low damp ground\n\nAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret,\n\nRattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.\n\nBut at my back from time to time I hear\n\nThe sound of horns and motors, which shall bring\n\nSweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.\n\nO the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter\n\nAnd on her daughter\n\nThey wash their feet in soda water\n\nEt, O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\n\nTwit twit twit\n\nJug jug jug jug jug jug\n\nSo rudely forc’d.\n\nTereu\n\nSweeny is Eliot’s natural man – something of a brute – one of the Boston Irish he recalls from his youth. Mrs. Porter (along with daughter) is apparently a brothel keeper in Cairo – notorious for passing on venereal disease – and features in many bawdy verses known by the troops. The washing of feet has clear religious connotations, and the line in French “And oh, these children’s voices singing in the dome” comes from a poem in which the protagonist’s (Parsifal) feet are ceremonially washed before he proceeds to the Grail – showing the triumph of a young and virgin knight over desire / lust & so enabling him to penetrate the grail’s mystery – the sick king is healed and the waste land is restored. However, the washing of feet in soda water here, by v.d. riddled prostitutes, suggests that the ceremony would be meaningless and ineffective.\n\nA reappearance of Tereus – who raped and cut out the tongue of Philomela – reminds us of the emptiness of sexual desire without reproduction – sating the base desires of base men. Coming after a bawdy interlude, it underscores the importance Eliot is placing on sexual regeneration, fertility, fecundity, as opposed to the hollowed out sex of modern times – of the modern waste land.\n\nUnreal City\n\nUnder the brown fog of a winter noon\n\nMr Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant\n\nUnshaven, with a pocket full of currants\n\nC. i. f. London: documents at sight,\n\nAsked me in demotic French\n\nTo luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel\n\nFollowed by a week-end at the Metropole.\n\n…corrupted sexuality – Mr Eugenides is after a dirty (homo-sexual – and so not generative) weekend in Brighton. The “unreal city” / London is a hollow and dead place.\n\nAnd we are given another vignette to illustrate the state of modern life:\n\nAt the violet hour, when the eyes and back\n\nTurn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits\n\nLike a taxi throbbing waiting,\n\nI Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,\n\nOld man with wrinkled female breasts, can see\n\nAt the violet hour, the evening hour that strives\n\nHomeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,\n\nThe typist home at tea-time, clears her breakfast, lights\n\nHer stove, and lays out food in tins.\n\nOut of the window perilously spread\n\nHer drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,\n\nOn the divan are piled (at night her bed)\n\nStockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.\n\nI Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs\n\nPerceived the scene, and foretold the rest—\n\nI too awaited the expected guest.\n\nHe, the young man carbuncular, arrives,\n\nA small house-agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,\n\nOne of the low on whom assurance sits\n\nAs a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.\n\nThe time is now propitious, as he guesses,\n\nThe meal is ended, she is bored and tired,\n\nEndeavours to engage her in caresses\n\nWhich still are unreproved, if undesired.\n\nFlushed and decided, he assaults at once;\n\nExploring hands encounter no defence;\n\nHis vanity requires no response,\n\nAnd makes a welcome of indifference.\n\n(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all\n\nEnacted on this same divan or bed;\n\nI who have sat by Thebes below the wall\n\nAnd walked among the lowest of the dead.)\n\nBestows one final patronizing kiss,\n\nAnd gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit…\n\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass,\n\nHardly aware of her departed lover;\n\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\n\n“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”\n\nWhen lovely woman stoops to folly and\n\nPaces about her room again, alone,\n\nShe smoothes her hair with automatic hand,\n\nAnd puts a record on the gramophone.\n\nIt is after this interlude (the typist as a modern parallel to Philomela) that the poem takes a discernible upwards swing, but the alienation of the young typist is yet another in our tour of the texture of modern life. But it is the appearance of Tiresias – the blind seer, the only person who knows what it is to be both man and woman – which starts this upwards turn. For Eliot “What Tiresias sees is the substance of the poem.” If we are to have a guide through the wasteland, something Eliot refuses to be, then we have to grab hold of Tiresias.\n\nThe old myths have been abused – man has turned his back upon the spiritual and is unable to glimpse the means of his redemption.\n\n“This music crept by me upon the waters”\n\nAnd along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.\n\nO City City, I can sometimes hear\n\nBeside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,\n\nThe pleasant whining of a mandoline\n\nAnd a clatter and a chatter from within\n\nWhere fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls\n\nOf Magnus Martyr hold\n\nInexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.\n\nHere begins what Eliot called the “song of the three Thames daughters” imitating the three Rhine-daughters of Wagner’s Ring who are lamenting he theft of gold that led to the destruction of the old world.\n\nThe river sweats\n\nOil and tar\n\nThe barges drift\n\nWith the turning tide\n\nRed sails\n\nWide\n\nTo leeward, swing on the heavy spar.\n\nThe barges wash\n\nDrifting logs\n\nDown Greenwich reach\n\nPast the Isle of Dogs.\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\nElizabeth and Leicester\n\nBeating oars\n\nThe stern was formed\n\nA gilded shell\n\nRed and gold\n\nThe brisk swell\n\nRippled both shores\n\nSouth-west wind\n\nCarried down stream\n\nThe peal of bells\n\nWhite towers\n\nWeialala leia\n\nWallala leialala\n\n…and a return to the modern scene…\n\n“Trams and dusty trees.\n\nHighbury bore me. Richmond and Kew\n\nUndid me. By Richmond I raised my knees\n\nSupine on the floor of a narrow canoe.“\n\n“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart\n\nUnder my feet. After the event\n\nHe wept. He promised ‘a new start.’\n\nI made no comment. What should I resent?”\n\n“On Margate Sands.\n\nI can connect\n\nNothing with nothing.\n\nThe broken finger-nails of dirty hands.\n\nMy people humble people who expect\n\nNothing.”\n\nla la\n\nTo Carthage then I came\n\nBurning burning burning burning\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest me out\n\nO Lord Thou pluckest\n\nburning\n\n…the allusions pile up towards the end: “Only connect” is the epigraph to Forrester’s Howard’s End “Live in fragments no longer.” Then there’s an allusion to Augustine arriving at Carthage, where his senses are assaulted by a cauldron of unholy loves” before he converts and prays for the release form the temptation of the senses, especially sexual temptation. “Fishermen” is a reference to a physical place – Billingsgate Fishmarket – but also, fishermen are always very positive symbols for Eliot, and of course linking to The Fisher king of the underlying myth. And “people who expect nothing” is King Lear (Shakespearean Tragedy) who has been driven mad by his own ungrateful and monstrous daughters.\n\nIV. DEATH BY WATER\n\nPhlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,\n\nForgot the cry of gulls, and the deep seas swell\n\nAnd the profit and loss.\n\nA current under sea\n\nPicked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell\n\nHe passed the stages of his age and youth\n\nEntering the whirlpool.\n\nGentile or Jew\n\nO you who turn the wheel and look to windward,\n\nConsider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.\n\nIs death by water to be feared? As Madam Sosostris claims on line 55. Death by water is symbolic of the sacrifice that precedes growth and rebirth and redemption. It is, in the Grail Romance and elsewhere, an integral part of the fertility ritual. This brief section functions as another transition in the poem. We are moving on. There is progress. But what are we moving towards? Is there available to us in the modern world / wasteland a form of redemption?\n\nV. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID\n\nThe final section channels the story of the Road to Emmaus incident from the bible where the apostles filled with fear and doubt meet the newly risen Christ, and the approach to the Chapel Perilous in the final stage of the Grail Quest where the knight is tested by the illusion of nothingness. We have God telling Moses to “smite a rock”, Christ as a vegetation god, the cross, crux, as death, and then resurrection as renewal. We enter the world of the risen god (though man cannot recognize him), Shakelton’s polar landscape, and we head towards eastern mysticism of the Upanishads (free yourself form the world of selfish desire) which might hold out a solution in Eliot’s mind for what ails us.\n\nAfter the torch-light red on sweaty faces\n\nAfter the frosty silence in the gardens\n\nAfter the agony in stony places\n\nThe shouting and the crying\n\nPrison and place and reverberation\n\nOf thunder of spring over distant mountains\n\nHe who was living is now dead\n\nWe who were living are now dying\n\nWith a little patience\n\nHere is no water but only rock\n\nRock and no water and the sandy road\n\nThe road winding above among the mountains\n\nWhich are mountains of rock without water\n\nIf there were water we should stop and drink\n\nAmongst the rock one cannot stop or think\n\nSweat is dry and feet are in the sand\n\nIf there were only water amongst the rock\n\nDead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit\n\nHere one can neither stand nor lie nor sit\n\nThere is not even silence in the mountains\n\nBut dry sterile thunder without rain\n\nThere is not even solitude in the mountains\n\nBut red sullen faces sneer and snarl\n\nFrom doors of mud-cracked houses\n\nIf there were water\n\nAnd no rock\n\nIf there were rock\n\nAnd also water\n\nAnd water\n\nA spring\n\nA pool among the rock\n\nIf there were the sound of water only\n\nNot the cicada\n\nAnd dry grass singing\n\nBut sound of water over a rock\n\nWhere the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees\n\nDrip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n\nBut there is no water\n\nWho is the third who walks always beside you?\n\nWhen I count, there are only you and I together\n\nBut when I look ahead up the white road\n\nThere is always another one walking beside you\n\nGliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded\n\nI do not know whether a man or a woman\n\n—But who is that on the other side of you?\n\nWhat is that sound high in the air\n\nMurmur of maternal lamentation\n\nWho are those hooded hordes swarming\n\nOver endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth\n\nRinged by the flat horizon only\n\nWhat is the city over the mountains\n\nCracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air\n\nFalling towers\n\nJerusalem Athens Alexandria\n\nVienna London\n\nUnreal\n\nA woman drew her long black hair out tight\n\nAnd fiddled whisper music on those strings\n\nAnd bats with baby faces in the violet light\n\nWhistled, and beat their wings\n\nAnd crawled head downward down a blackened wall\n\nAnd upside down in air were towers\n\nTolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours\n\nAnd voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\n\nIn this decayed hole among the mountains\n\nIn the faint moonlight, the grass is singing\n\nOver the tumbled graves, about the chapel\n\nThere is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.\n\nIt has no windows, and the door swings,\n\nDry bones can harm no one.\n\nOnly a cock stood on the roof-tree\n\nCo co rico co co rico\n\nIn a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust\n\nBringing rain\n\nGanga was sunken, and the limp leaves\n\nWaited for rain, while the black clouds\n\nGathered far distant, over Himavant.\n\nThe jungle crouched, humped in silence.\n\nThen spoke the thunder\n\nDA\n\nDatta: what have we given?\n\nMy friend, blood shaking my heart\n\nThe awful daring of a moment’s surrender\n\nWhich an age of prudence can never retract\n\nBy this, and this only, we have existed\n\nWhich is not to be found in our obituaries\n\nOr in memories draped by the beneficent spider\n\nOr under seals broken by the lean solicitor\n\nIn our empty rooms\n\nDA\n\nDayadhvam: I have heard the key\n\nTurn in the door once and turn once only\n\nWe think of the key, each in his prison\n\nThinking of the key, each confirms a prison\n\nOnly at nightfall, aetherial rumours\n\nRevive for a moment a broken Coriolanus\n\nDA\n\nDamyata: The boat responded\n\nGaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar\n\nThe sea was calm, your heart would have responded\n\nGaily, when invited, beating obedient\n\nTo controlling hands\n\nI sat upon the shore\n\nFishing, with the arid plain behind me\n\nShall I at least set my lands in order?\n\nLondon Bridge is falling down falling down falling down\n\nPoi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina\n\nQuando fiam ceu chelidon—O swallow swallow\n\nLe Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie\n\nThese fragments I have shored against my ruins\n\nWhy then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.\n\nDatta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.\n\nShantih shantih shantih\n\nOnly in love and in the loss of selfhood, however brief they may be, can modern man, isolated among the ruins of his culture, threatened by enemies within and without, his myths broken and his emotions wrecked, glimpse for a moment the possibility of the “peace which passeth understanding”.\n\nSo we may well be able to salvage something amid the detritus of contemporary flux: the discipline, achievements and coherence of past literature and tradition offer us something: a means of measuring the pettiness of modern life and exposing its hollowness: a life richer than the modern world of sterility and decline. Is this Eliot’s “message”? The relation of chaotic subjective experience to a higher and absolute experience. Yes, there is the known awfulness of the real world, but this is more to do with the “unmagicking of the world” – the disenchantment / disillusionment consequent on western man’s over-rationalisation, for whom the myths no longer function to weld the various parts of man’s life together and assure him of security, potency and a sense of well-being.\n\nThe Waste Land – An Interpretation\n\nAdapted from Pericles Lewis’s “Cambridge Introduction to Modernism”\n\nThe Waste Land makes use of allusion, quotation (in several languages), a variety of verse forms, and a collage of poetic fragments to create the sense of speaking for an entire culture in crisis; it was quickly accepted as the essential statement of that crisis and the epitome of a modernist poem.\n\nThe first lines of the poem position it as a monument in a specifically English tradition by alluding to Geoffrey Chaucer, the first major poet of the English language, whom Dryden called “the Father of English Poetry.” Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales begins with a description of April’s “sweet showers,” which cause the flowers of spring to grow. The natural cycle of death and rebirth traditionally associated with the month of April appears tragic to Eliot’s speaker:\n\nApril is the cruellest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with dried tubers.\n\nFor Eliot’s speaker, April’s showers are cruel, not sweet. The “us” in line 5—“Winter kept us warm”—seems to link the poet himself to the earth that is covered with snow. These opening lines, then, pose the question of the poet’s originality in relation to a tradition that seems barely capable of nourishing the “dull roots” of the modern poet’s sensibility. The poet lives in a modern waste land, in the aftermath of a great war, in an industrialized society that lacks traditional structures of authority and belief, in soil that may not be conducive to new growth. Even if he could become inspired, however, the poet would have no original materials to work with. His imagination consists only of “a heap of broken images,” in the words of line 22, the images he inherits from literary ancestors going back to the Bible. The modernist comes to write poetry after a great tradition of poetry has been all but tapped out. Despite this bleakness, however, the poem does present a rebirth of sorts, and the rebirth, while signifying the recovery of European society after the war, also symbolizes the renewal of poetic tradition in modernism, accomplished in part by the mixing of high and low culture and the improvisational quality of the poem as a whole.\n\nThe poet’s struggle to make a new poem out of the inherited language of tradition seems to be mirrored in the unevenness of the poem’s language and form. The opening lines vary between five and nine syllables each. Five of the seven lines end with a single verb in participial form, following a comma (which marks a caesura, or pause, in the poem’s rhythm). These lines seem uneven—as if the poet had started to write iambic pentameter but not completed the lines or as if he had intended to write shorter lines with three or four beats each but felt compelled to add the words that appear after the commas. Each of the participles introduces an enjambment—in which a unit of meaning carries beyond a line-ending into the next line. The poem makes sparing use of end-rhyme, which is associated with completion and closure. Yet the participial verb forms that end five of the first seven lines perform something like the function of rhyme, linking together the various underground motions of winter and spring: breeding, mixing, stirring, covering, feeding: indeed, “breeding” and “feeding” do rhyme. Eliot also makes use of alliteration—the repetition of consonants—in phrases such as “lilacs out of the dead land,” “mixing / Memory,” “Winter kept us warm,” and “a little life.” Alliteration is an older poetic technique than rhyme and typical of Old English poetry, which, like these lines, was heavily accented. Eliot adopted these Old English poetic techniques from Pound, who had translated the Anglo-Saxon poem “The Seafarer” into alliterative modern English. They suggest that Eliot is drawing on resources even older than Chaucer’s Middle English. Even as he describes the decay of modern civilization, he seeks power in the primitive resources of the English language. The caesuras and enjambment give the verse a ritual air, as if we were witnessing a “rite of spring,” such as Stravinsky celebrated before the war. The title of this first section, “The Burial of the Dead,” from the funeral service in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, reinforces this ritual quality. The participial phrases emphasize the continual activity that underlies the winter’s “forgetful snow” and the spring’s “dead land”: life is breeding and stirring; dry roots are soaking up water; the emotions of the past and the future, memory and desire, are mixing in the rebirth of spring. Something is germinating.\n\nFor Eliot’s speaker, this rebirth is cruel, because any birth reminds him of death. The soil out of which the spring plants grow is composed of the decayed leaves of earlier plants. April is the month of Easter, and Eliot is invoking here both the Christian story of the young god who dies in order to give new life to the rest of us and the many other versions of this myth chronicled by Sir James Frazer in his anthropological work The Golden Bough and Jessie Weston in her From Ritual to Romance. Frazer and Weston explored the links among the mythology of the ancient near east, the Christ story, fertility rites, folk customs like May Day, and degenerate modern forms of magic such as the Tarot deck. What made Frazer’s and Weston’s discoveries shocking to some of their first readers was the evidence that many Christian myths and rituals had their origins in ancient, pagan forms of magic. Eliot was particularly interested in the myth of the Fisher King, most famously embodied in the Arthurian story of the quest for the holy grail. The Fisher King is impotent, his lands infertile and drought-stricken; one cause of this infertility is a crime, the rape of some maidens in the King’s court. Only the arrival of a pure-hearted stranger (Perceval, Gawain, or Galahad in different versions of the Arthurian tales) permits the land to become fertile again. Weston emphasized the sexual symbolism of the story, notably the grail (a cup said to have been used at the last supper) and the lance (said to have pierced Christ’s side), which can be interpreted as symbols of the female and male genitalia. This suggests ancient practices of imitative magic, including ritual marriages intended to encourage the plants to grow; Frazer thought that the tradition of the May Queen and King derived from such rites. Much of the symbolism of The Waste Land suggests these ancient fertility rites, but always gone awry, particularly in such modern instances as the fortune-teller Madame Sosostris, whom Eliot drew from Crome Yellow (1921), a satirical novel by the young Aldous Huxley.\n\nMany myths attribute the death of winter and the rebirth of spring to the death and rebirth of a god with human attributes, who in some ancient practices is a man ritually murdered and in others an effigy buried or thrown into the sea to guarantee fertility or to bring rain. In The Waste Land, however, the god himself is conspicuously absent, except in debased forms like the (missing) Hanged Man in the Tarot pack or the drowned Phoenician Sailor, who returns as “Phlebas the Phoenician” in the fourth section, “Death by Water.” Other, more modern versions of the Christ story find a place in the poem. The Waste Land echoes Whitman’s “When Lilacs last in the Door-Yard Bloomed” (1865), in which Whitman makes use of a similar mythology to commemorate Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated at the end of the American civil war on Good Friday, 1865. Eliot probably also had Rupert Brooke’s poem “The Old Vicarage, Grantchester” (1912), in mind; it begins, “Just now the lilac is in bloom.” Brooke himself combined the roles of poet and martyr when he was transformed into a mythical figure of the English “poet-soldier” after his death. In the more immediate past, W. B. Yeats had recently published “Easter, 1916,” celebrating the martyrs of the Easter rebellion. Chaucer drew on this same mythological structure in the Canterbury Tales: his pilgrims are headed to Canterbury, “the holy, blissful martyr for to seek, / He who hath helped them when they were sick.” Eliot would later write a play, Murder in the Cathedral (1935), about the death of Thomas à Becket, Chaucer’s “holy, blissful martyr.” Spring, the season of rebirth, is also a season for celebrating martyrs, and Eliot’s speaker seems to align himself with such martyrs as Christ, Becket, Lincoln, Brooke, and the war dead.\n\nThe poem ultimately does promise a new beginning, but Eliot’s speaker appears, perversely, to prefer winter to spring, and thus to deny the joy and beauty associated with rebirth. He emphasizes the role of death and decay in the process of growth, most memorably in the conversation between two veterans who meet near London bridge after the war: “‘Stetson! / ‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! / ‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden, / ‘Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? / ‘Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?’” The war is the essential background to the poem, but instead of referring to it directly, Eliot alludes to the battle of Mylae in the Punic Wars of the third century B.C.E., suggesting that all wars are in reality one war. The fact that the first world war was fought not primarily on ships but in trenches is expressed only indirectly through the idea of the sprouting corpse, which seems a grotesque parody of Brooke’s image of the foreign burial plot (in “The Soldier”) as “forever England.” Similarly, the poem’s “rats’ alley” owes something to the rats that appear in poetry about trench warfare by such soldier-poets as Siegfried Sassoon. Later, Eliot casually introduces the minor character Albert, Lil’s husband, a demobilized soldier. History enters the poem not as a subject for direct treatment but through snatches of overheard dialogue.\n\nIn the first section of the poem, “The Burial of the Dead,” Eliot adapts some of the crucial imagery of the poem—the rocky, deserted land, the absence of life-giving water, the dead or dying vegetation—from the Biblical books of Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Ecclesiastes. Other quotations or translations come from writers of near-sacred status: Shakespeare (“Those are pearls that were his eyes,” line 48) and Dante (“I had not thought death had undone so many. / Sighs, short and infrequent were exhaled,” lines 63-4). Eliot helpfully, if somewhat pedantically, included a set of notes on the poem that allowed even his early readers to identify the sources of these allusions, although he later ridiculed his own notes as “a remarkable exposition of bogus scholarship.” The notes themselves are an indication of what is new about the poem. Previous poets would have assumed that their readers shared a common culture with themselves and would probably have alluded only to materials from that common culture. Eliot inherits from the symbolists a concern with private, esoteric meanings, but he adds a structure of notes in order to make some of those meanings accessible to his readers. The Bible, Shakespeare, and Dante obviously provide historical and aesthetic ballast for Eliot’s apparently chaotic modern poem, but other types of allusion seem more bizarre. Many of the quotations appear in foreign languages, such as the lines from Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde (1857-59), a legendary story of adultery which helps Eliot to establish the theme of frustrated or misdirected sexuality. While occasionally quoting his favorite modern French poets, including Baudelaire, he also includes passages of everyday conversation, such as the snippets in lines 8 to 16 from the reminiscences of Countess Marie Larisch, the niece of the former Empress of Austria and a fashionable contemporary of Eliot.\n\nEliot’s use of allusion and quotation seems in part a response to the dilemma of coming at the end of a great tradition. The poet seeks to address modern problems—the war, industrialization, abortion, urban life—and at the same time to participate in a literary tradition. His own imagination resembles the decaying land that is the subject of the poem: nothing seems to take root among the stony rubbish left behind by old poems and scraps of popular culture. The method of assembling “fragments” or “broken images” from the past into a sort of mosaic allows him at once to suggest parallels between contemporary problems and earlier historical situations and to disorient the reader, turning the reading process into a model of modern, urban confusion. It parallels the cubist use of collage, calling attention to the linguistic texture of the poem itself and to the materials—literary and popular—out of which it is constructed. Eliot’s allusive method is a distinctive feature of his poetry, but he developed it in part on the model of some of Pound’s earlier poems, and Pound’s editing of The Waste Land greatly increased its fragmentation. An even more important influence was Joyce. Eliot read the early episodes of Ulysses that appeared in the Little Review; as assistant editor at The Egoist, he read the original drafts of five episodes that were published there in 1919. He also read other parts of the novel in manuscript and corresponded with Joyce about it. He later confessed to having felt that Joyce’s Ulysses did “superbly” what Eliot himself was “tentatively attempting to do, with the usual false starts and despairs.” Allusion would become a favorite modernist technique for reconciling formal experiment with an awareness of literary tradition.\n\nVoice\n\nEliot’s original title for The Waste Land was “He do the Police in Different Voices.” The line, another quotation, comes from Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend (1864-65), and describes the foundling Sloppy’s skills as a reader of the newspaper—imitating the voices of the police in the crime reports. The Waste Land is composed of many voices, not always distinguishable from one another. The second section, “A Game of Chess,” contains a medley of voices. The opening passage draws on Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra to describe a richly furnished room, in which a depiction of Ovid’s story of the rape of Philomela and her transformation into a nightingale is displayed above the mantel. The “inviolable voice” of the painted or sculpted nightingale also enters the poem inarticulately through a conventional representation of birdsong from Renaissance poetry: “Jug jug” (103). The following passage relates a conversation between a neurotic woman and a laconic man. The woman’s remarks appear in quotation marks: “Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.” These comments alternate with lines, not in quotation marks, that may be spoken or thought by her male companion: “I think we are in rats’ alley / Where the dead men lost their bones.” The ominous tone of these replies suggests, however, that the words may issue from some supernatural source. A moment of ragtime music breaks in before the neurotic woman threatens to rush out into the street. (Eliot’s friends thought that the woman in this passage was very closely based on his first wife, who was later institutionalized). The section ends with an overheard monologue, this one drawn from a story told by the Eliots’ maid concerning Albert, the demobilized soldier, and Lil, his wife, who has bad teeth and has taken some pills to induce an abortion. The maid relates her own conversation with Lil. Another ominous voice (or the same one?) interrupts the monologue, announcing with increasing frequency “HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME,” the standard warning that closing time is approaching in a pub. Here, the words have a sinister quality, suggesting that “time” means death, or apocalypse. The final words of the section recall Ophelia’s last scene before her suicide in Hamlet. The section makes use of at least seven voices: the initial narrator, the nightingale, the neurotic woman, her companion, the gramophone, the maid, and the barkeeper.\n\nAmong the mix of voices are those of popular culture. The influential critic Clive Bell, brother-in-law of Virginia Woolf, described Eliot’s poetry as largely “a product of the Jazz movement,” and saw The Waste Land as part of a “ragtime literature which flouts traditional rhythms and sequences and grammar and logic.” Eliot riffs on a ragtime song (“The Shakespearean Rag”): “O o o o that Shakespeherian rag, / It’s so elegant, so intelligent.” The critic Michael North has shown that many of Eliot’s first reviewers associated his modernism with the Jazz Age. The poem’s syncopated rhythms might seem, to a conservative critic, to bring all of literary tradition down to the level of jazz, but they can just as plausibly be seen as including popular culture in a new canon that erases the boundaries between high and low.\n\nThe use of so many voices in this kind of collage allows the poet to distance himself from any single statement. As the critic Louis Menand has put it, “nothing in [the poem] can be said to point to the poet, since none of its stylistic features is continuous, and it has no phrases or images that cannot be suspected of—where they are not in fact identified as—belonging to someone else….. Eliot appears nowhere, but his fingerprints are on everything.” Menand’s comment recalls Flaubert’s idea of the godlike author who is “present everywhere and visible nowhere,” and the demand of the prosecuting attorney in the Madame Bovary trial: “Would you condemn her in the name of the author’s conscience? I do not know what the author’s conscience thinks.” Indeed, some of Eliot’s most important influences were the post-Flaubertian novelists Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and James Joyce. Is the poet himself speaking the lines describing the room, or is this merely a pastiche of Renaissance drama? Who is issuing the warnings about closing time? Although The Waste Land is, by Eliot’s own admission, a highly personal document, it also aspires to a certain kind of impersonality.\n\nThis doctrine of impersonality was closely linked to Eliot’s claim that his poetry was “classical” and not “romantic,” by which he meant in part that it was more concerned with form and balance than with the expression of emotion. Impersonality did not mean his poetry avoided emotion. However, the emotions are assumed in something like the way an actor takes on a role—Eliot, in The Waste Land, “does” a variety of different characters in different voices. Paradoxically, by trying several personae on, and not identifying himself with any one persona, Eliot manages to achieve a kind of impersonality. Like Pound, Eliot drew for his conception of impersonality on Robert Browning’s dramatic monologues, in which he took on the roles of such figures as the Duke who casually tells the story of how he put a stop to his first wife’s suspected adultery (“My Last Duchess,” 1842) or the Renaissance professor who devotes his whole life to the smallest aspects of Greek grammar (“A Grammarian’s Funeral,” 1855).\n\nIn a note to the third section of the poem, “The Fire Sermon,” Eliot wrote:\n\nTiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a “character,” is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.\n\nEliot thus suggests that all the many voices in the poem may be aspects of two voices, those of one man and one woman, or indeed of a single voice, that of Tiresias, the man who was changed into a woman and back into a man, according to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, who foresaw the destruction of Thebes, according to Sophocles’s Oedipus the King, and who was visited by Odysseus in the underworld in book eleven of the Odyssey. The background suggests one undercurrent of the dialogue between men and women in The Waste Land. The title “A Game of Chess,” drawn from a Renaissance play about a seduction, and the chess imagery of this section, point to an understanding of marriage and sexuality debased into a game of strategy in which men and women battle over sex. Instead of a life-giving act of love, sex occurs in the poem as seduction or rape, leading to abortion. Eliot’s note also suggests that the entire poem can be understood as a vision of a possible destruction, and near the end of the poem such a catastrophe seems to be envisioned in the words of the nursery rhyme, “London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down.” From the point of view of impersonality, the central role of Tiresias suggests that the various voices of the poem can be understood as a sort of chorus, with each part being spoken by representatives of one sex or the other. The distance from such earlier poems as “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1915) or even from Pound’s Hugh Selwyn Mauberley is apparent; the lyric “I” and the concentration on a single speaker’s or character’s experience has given way to a sort of dream vision, in which many voices speak at once. The resulting cacophony suggests the impossibility of a truly unified understanding of the poem, even if Eliot hoped that all the voices could be subsumed in that of Tiresias.\n\nWords at Liberty\n\nThe Waste Land could not have been written without the assault on the English poetic tradition undertaken by Ezra Pound and the imagists. The most obvious way in which The Waste Land differs from most of the poetry of the nineteenth century, and from more recent poets like Kipling or even Wilfred Owen and Sigfried Sassoon, is in its play with and partial rejection of traditional meter, rhyme, and stanza form. Parts of the poem are written in free verse. Eliot himself did not much like free verse in general and even insisted that it did not exist. Using the French term for free verse (vers libre), Eliot wrote that “no vers is libre for the man who wants to do a good job.” In particular, although he was happy to do away with standard rhyme schemes, Eliot claimed in an essay of 1917 that all verse (perhaps all language) made use of some kind of meter; what was distinctive about his work was the complexity of his use of meter: “the most interesting verse…has been done either by taking a very simple form, like the iambic pentameter, and constantly withdrawing from it, or taking no form at all, and constantly approximating to a very simple one. It is this contrast between fixity and flux, this unperceived evasion of monotony, which is the very life of verse.” In this regard, Eliot’s rhetoric clashed with that of Pound, but both men claimed to be experimenting with very difficult techniques for recording the rhythms of actual speech. Indeed, their views had converged in the years immediately preceding The Waste Land, with Pound experimenting more with traditional meters and Eliot using some aspects of free verse. Eliot’s divergences from traditional meters, then, were meant to achieve particular poetic effects rather than simply to shock. At first glance, The Waste Land may appear to follow no set metrical pattern. Yet, just as the opening lines of the poem subtly introduce a form of rhyme, Eliot frequently draws on regular meters. Eliot makes use of many fragmentary lines like those of the nightingale’s song in the “Fire Sermon” section:\n\nTwit twit twit\n\nJug jug jug\n\njug jug jug\n\nSo rudely forc’d\n\nTereu\n\nHere, the first two lines seem to be made up entirely of stressed syllables, although they tend to fall into groups of three. The third and fourth lines, however, are composed of iambs. The iamb is the dominant “foot,” or metrical unit, of English poetry, consisting of two syllables, the first unstressed and the second stressed.\n\nOften, as Theodore Roethke observes, “free verse is a denial in terms…[because] invariably, there is the ghost of some other form, often blank verse, behind what is written.” Blank verse is the English name for iambic pentameter (lines of five iambs) without rhymes, the verse form of Shakespeare’s plays and of Milton’s Paradise Lost and Wordsworth’s Prelude. Many verses of The Waste Land are composed in iambic pentameter, and others closely resemble that meter. Eliot’s frequent adaptation of lines from other poets, such as Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, John Webster, and Andrew Marvell, often reinforces this tendency to revert to the standard meter of English long poems, for example in the opening lines of the second section, “A Game of Chess.” Indeed Pound criticized these passages as “too penty,” that is, too close to iambic pentameter, or as Pound also put it, “too tum-pum at a stretch.” In addition to the many lines clearly written in blank verse, Eliot uses various rhyme schemes, often to comic effect. For example, in “The Fire Sermon,” one of the unwholesome couplings is introduced by a rhyming couplet: “The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring / Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.” In another part of “The Fire Sermon,” Eliot relates the unsatisfactory tryst between the typist and the young man carbuncular from the perspective of Tiresias, who, according to one version of the myth, was blinded by the goddess Juno for his claim that women enjoyed sex more than men. In the encounter related in the poem, neither participant seems to experience much pleasure. Eliot uses quatrains (rhyming units of four lines) to describe the tryst. Eliot’s slightly forced rhymes call attention to the coercive nature of the sexual encounter between the “young man carbuncular” and the typist. When he has left,\n\nShe turns and looks a moment in the glass\n\nHardly aware of her departed lover;\n\nHer brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\n\n“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”\n\nThe double or feminine rhymes (rhyming the last two syllables of each line) have a darkly comic effect. The traditional meter and rhyme in such passages sets them off from the free verse of the rest of the poem, but often Eliot seems to be using the meter to call attention to a disjuncture between his low subject matter and the formal style with which he describes it. In fact, often the formality of the language is inversely related to the seriousness of the material Eliot is describing. Frequently, the lower-class material in the poem is treated satirically, in contrast with the work of Joyce, who showed a great fondness for the lower middle-class milieu of Ulysses.\n\nEliot also makes use of a number of the patterns and systems for making meaning available to free verse, some of which have been summarized by the critic Paul Fussell. They include the use of enumeration or cataloguing. Lists are one of the most ancient poetic forms, visible in the catalogues of ships in Homer’s Iliad or in the “begats” of the Bible. A brief list appears at the beginning of “The Fire Sermon”: “The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, / Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends / Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed” (177-179). In this case, Eliot begins in iambic hexameter (six feet), but allows the meter to break down in the third quoted line. Eliot also makes use of another typical device of free verse, the repetition of phrases or syntactical forms, like the refrain “HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME” in the passage about Albert and Lil.\n\nAnother method of structuring free verse, seldom used by Eliot, is to write very long lines, each of which contains a full syntactic unit, as Whitman often does, thus creating the effect of a formal speech and sometimes even a Biblical tone. Conversely, writers of free verse may run a series of very short lines together, dividing a syntactical unit into as many as four or eight lines, as in William Carlos Williams’s “This is just to say” (1934) :\n\nI have eaten the plums that were in the icebox\n\nand which you were probably saving for breakfast\n\nForgive me they were delicious so sweet and so cold\n\nEliot sometimes combines the techniques of Whitman and Williams, by writing a long line that introduces a set of variations on a theme; the line then re-appears but broken up by enjambment as if the speaker were mulling over his thought, unable to phrase it adequately. Thus the line, “If there were only water amongst the rock,” forms the basis for the fugal sequence:\n\nIf there were water\n\nAnd no rock\n\nIf there were rock\n\nAnd also water\n\nAnd water\n\nA spring\n\nA pool among the rock\n\nIf there were the sound of water only\n\nNot the cicada\n\nAnd dry grass singing\n\nBut sound of water over a rock\n\nWhere the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees\n\nDrip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n\nBut there is no water\n\nThe Waste Land thus makes use of a wide range of metrical patterns and rhyme schemes, as well as techniques for structuring free verse. Although the effect appeared chaotic to some of Eliot’s first readers, the poem fulfills Pound’s dictum that “Rhythm must have meaning” (1915). Later poetic practice was largely shaped by Pound’s advocacy of free verse and Eliot’s example.\n\nEpic\n\nThe Waste Land is also characteristic of modernist poetry in that it contains both lyric and epic elements. Modernism continued the tendency, begun in romanticism, to prize lyric highly, but many modernist poets also sought to write in the traditionally highest form, epic. Eliot defined the lyric as “the voice of the poet talking to himself, or to nobody,” and if we accept his description of The Waste Land as a “piece of rhythmical grumbling,” it may seem to belong to the lyric tradition. Yet its broader ambitions are obvious. “Eliot came back from his Lausanne specialist looking OK; and with a damn good poem (19 pages) in his suitcase,” wrote Pound after reading the manuscript of the poem. “About enough, Eliot’s poem, to make the rest of us shut up shop.” Pound defined an epic as a “poem including history.” Although much shorter than Homer’s Iliad or Odyssey, Virgil’s Aeneid, Dante’s Divine Comedy, or Milton’s Paradise Lost, The Waste Land does contain history—both contemporary history and the history of the world understood in mythological terms. One of the factors that helped to create “high modernism” was the attempt of poets, after the war, to extend the techniques of the pre-war avant-gardes to address broad, historical questions, the sorts of questions normally addressed by epic. They remained suspicious, however, of attempts to tell the history of the world from a single, unified perspective—the “Arms and the man I sing” of the first line of Virgil’s Aeneid, in which both the poet (“I”) and his hero (“the man”) are singular. Instead, their epics tended to treat historical experience as fragmentary, and often it is difficult to say whether their long poems are epics or merely collections of lyrics. Instead of granting perspective on history, they struggle to contain it in their irregular forms. In the first draft of his own fragmentary epic, The Cantos, in 1917, Pound had written that “the modern world / Needs such a rag-bag to stuff all its thoughts in.” The modernist epic would have to be a rag-bag.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of modernist rag-bags is the concluding section of The Waste Land, “What the Thunder Said.” Eliot wrote this section in a flash of inspiration and published it virtually unedited. Eliot invokes three ancient Sanskrit words from the Upanishads, ancient Hindu scriptures: Datta, Dayadhvam, Damyata, each announced by the single syllable “DA,” representing a clap of thunder. The return of the waters suggests the possibility of a different type of sexual relation from those seen in the poem so far: “The sea was calm, your heart would have responded / Gaily, when invited, beating obedient / To controlling hands.” However, the flood and the purifying fire arrive, and the last lines of the poem seem to announce destruction, in many languages, as partial quotations pile up and the speaker (perhaps at last representing the poet himself), announces: “These fragments I have shored against my ruins.” After the destruction, the poem ends on a note of peace, with the words “Shantih Shantih Shantih,” which, as Eliot informs us, mark “the formal ending to an Upanishad.”\n\nEliot’s intentions in making a miniature epic out of the various lyrical moments and borrowed fragments that make up The Waste Land can best be understood in terms of his own analysis of Joyce’s Ulysses, which served as perhaps the most important model for the poem. Eliot wrote that the parallels Joyce draws between his own characters and those of Homer’s Odyssey constitute a “mythical method,” which had “the importance of a scientific discovery.” He went so far as to compare Joyce to Einstein. The mythical method, according to Eliot, “is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history.” Many of Joyce’s readers have felt that Joyce himself did not necessarily aim for control and order, but most are in agreement that Eliot’s essay describes well the intention of The Waste Land, in which the many parallels that have been briefly discussed here help to convert chaos into a kind of order.\n\nLike other modernist models of history—Yeats’s gyres, Pound’s vortex, Joyce’s Vichian cycles—Eliot emphasize the current moment as one of crisis, either preparing for or recovering from a radical break in history. This radical break certainly has something to do with the first world war, but it is also an aspect of the modernists’ eschatological view of the world, that is their fascination with the problem of destiny and the last judgment. It is for this reason that Kurtz’s famous last words (“The horror! The horror!”) in Heart of Darkness ring through so much of later modernism. Eliot originally intended to use them as the epigraph for The Waste Land. As Conrad’s narrator, Marlow, says, “he had summed up—he had judged. ‘The horror!’ He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candor, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange commingling of desire and hate.” The capacity to judge a civilization that teeters on the edge of chaos was highly prized by Eliot, as it was by Pound, Whose Cantos shares some of the features of The Waste Land, and by the other modernists who attempted their own epics.[1]\n\nAdapted from Pericles Lewis’s Cambridge Introduction to Modernism (Cambridge UP, 2007), pp. 129-151."
