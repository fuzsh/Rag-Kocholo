The Burial of the Dead\n\n1 April is the cruellest month, breeding\n\n2Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n\n3Memory and desire, stirring\n\n4Dull roots with spring rain.\n\n5Winter kept us warm, covering\n\n6Earth in forgetful snow, feeding\n\n7A little life with dried tubers.\n\n8Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee\n\n9With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,\n\n10And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,\n\n11And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.\n\n12Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.\n\n13And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s,\n\n14My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,\n\n15And I was frightened. He said, Marie,\n\n16Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.\n\n17In the mountains, there you feel free.\n\n18I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.\n\n19 What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n\n20Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\n\n21You cannot say, or guess, for you know only\n\n22A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\n\n23And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\n\n24And the dry stone no sound of water. Only\n\n25There is shadow under this red rock,\n\n26(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),\n\n27And I will show you something different from either\n\n28Your shadow at morning striding behind you\n\n29Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;\n\n30I will show you fear in a handful of dust.\n\n31 Frisch weht der Wind\n\n32 Der Heimat zu\n\n33 Mein Irisch Kind,\n\n34 Wo weilest du?\n\n35“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;\n\n36“They called me the hyacinth girl.”\n\n37—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,\n\n38Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not\n\n39Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither\n\n40Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,\n\n41Looking into the heart of light, the silence.\n\n42Oed’ und leer das Meer.\n\n43 Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,\n\n44Had a bad cold, nevertheless\n\n45Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,\n\n46With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,\n\n47Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,\n\n48(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)\n\n49Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\n\n50The lady of situations.\n\n51Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\n\n52And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\n\n53Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,\n\n54Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find\n\n55The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.\n\n56I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.\n\n57Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,\n\n58Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:\n\n59One must be so careful these days.\n\n60 Unreal City,\n\n61Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,\n\n62A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,\n\n63I had not thought death had undone so many.\n\n64Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,\n\n65And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.\n\n66Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,\n\n67To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours\n\n68With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.\n\n69There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!\n\n70“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!\n\n71“That corpse you planted last year in your garden,\n\n72“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?\n\n73“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?\n\n74“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,\n\n75“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!\n\n76“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”\n\nII. A Game of Chess\n\n77The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,\n\n78Glowed on the marble, where the glass\n\n79Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines\n\n80From which a golden Cupidon peeped out\n\n81(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)\n\n82Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra\n\n83Reflecting light upon the table as\n\n84The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,\n\n85From satin cases poured in rich profusion;\n\n86In vials of ivory and coloured glass\n\n87Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,\n\n88Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused\n\n89And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air\n\n90That freshened from the window, these ascended\n\n91In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,\n\n92Flung their smoke into the laquearia,\n\n93Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.\n\n94Huge sea-wood fed with copper\n\n95Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,\n\n96In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam.\n\n97Above the antique mantel was displayed\n\n98As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene\n\n99The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king\n\n100So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale\n\n101Filled all the desert with inviolable voice\n\n102And still she cried, and still the world pursues,\n\n103“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.\n\n104And other withered stumps of time\n\n105Were told upon the walls; staring forms\n\n106Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.\n\n107Footsteps shuffled on the stair.\n\n108Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair\n\n109Spread out in fiery points\n\n110Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.\n\n111 “My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.\n\n112“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.\n\n113 “What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?\n\n114“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”\n\n115 I think we are in rats’ alley\n\n116Where the dead men lost their bones.\n\n117 “What is that noise?”\n\n118 The wind under the door.\n\n119“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”\n\n120 Nothing again nothing.\n\n121 “Do\n\n122“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember\n\n123“Nothing?”\n\n124 I remember\n\n125Those are pearls that were his eyes.\n\n126“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”\n\n127 But\n\n128O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—\n\n129It’s so elegant\n\n130So intelligent\n\n131“What shall I do now? What shall I do?”\n\n132“I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street\n\n133“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?\n\n134“What shall we ever do?”\n\n135 The hot water at ten.\n\n136And if it rains, a closed car at four.\n\n137And we shall play a game of chess,\n\n138Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.\n\n139 When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—\n\n140I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,\n\n141HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\n\n142Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.\n\n143He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you\n\n144To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.\n\n145You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,\n\n146He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.\n\n147And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,\n\n148He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,\n\n149And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.\n\n150Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.\n\n151Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.\n\n152HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\n\n153If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.\n\n154Others can pick and choose if you can’t.\n\n155But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.\n\n156You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.\n\n157(And her only thirty-one.)\n\n158I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,\n\n159It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.\n\n160(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)\n\n161The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.\n\n162You are a proper fool, I said.\n\n163Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,\n\n164What you get married for if you don’t want children?\n\n165HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\n\n166Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,\n\n167And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—\n\n168HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\n\n169HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\n\n170Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.\n\n171Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.\n\n172Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.\n\nIII. The Fire Sermon\n\n173 The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf\n\n174Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind\n\n175Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.\n\n176Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\n\n177The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,\n\n178Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends\n\n179Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.\n\n180And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;\n\n181Departed, have left no addresses.\n\n182By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .\n\n183Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,\n\n184Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.\n\n185But at my back in a cold blast I hear\n\n186The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\n\n187A rat crept softly through the vegetation\n\n188Dragging its slimy belly on the bank\n\n189While I was fishing in the dull canal\n\n190On a winter evening round behind the gashouse\n\n191Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck\n\n192And on the king my father’s death before him.\n\n193White bodies naked on the low damp ground\n\n194And bones cast in a little low dry garret,\n\n195Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.\n\n196But at my back from time to time I hear\n\n197The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring\n\n198Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.\n\n199O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter\n\n200And on her daughter\n\n201They wash their feet in soda water\n\n202Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!\n\n203Twit twit twit\n\n204Jug jug jug jug jug jug\n\n205So rudely forc’d.\n\n206Tereu\n\n207Unreal City\n\n208Under the brown fog of a winter noon\n\n209Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant\n\n210Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants\n\n211C.i.f. London: documents at sight,\n\n212Asked me in demotic French\n\n213To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel\n\n214Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.\n\n215At the violet hour, when the eyes and back\n\n216Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits\n\n217Like a taxi throbbing waiting,\n\n218I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,\n\n219Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see\n\n220At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives\n\n221Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,\n\n222The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights\n\n223Her stove, and lays out food in tins.\n\n224Out of the window perilously spread\n\n225Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,\n\n226On the divan are piled (at night her bed)\n\n227Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.\n\n228I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs\n\n229Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—\n\n230I too awaited the expected guest.\n\n231He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,\n\n232A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,\n\n233One of the low on whom assurance sits\n\n234As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.\n\n235The time is now propitious, as he guesses,\n\n236The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,\n\n237Endeavours to engage her in caresses\n\n238Which still are unreproved, if undesired.\n\n239Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;\n\n240Exploring hands encounter no defence;\n\n241His vanity requires no response,\n\n242And makes a welcome of indifference.\n\n243(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all\n\n244Enacted on this same divan or bed;\n\n245I who have sat by Thebes below the wall\n\n246And walked among the lowest of the dead.)\n\n247Bestows one final patronising kiss,\n\n248And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .\n\n249She turns and looks a moment in the glass,\n\n250Hardly aware of her departed lover;\n\n251Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:\n\n252“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”\n\n253When lovely woman stoops to folly and\n\n254Paces about her room again, alone,\n\n255She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,\n\n256And puts a record on the gramophone.\n\n257“This music crept by me upon the waters”\n\n258And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.\n\n259O City city, I can sometimes hear\n\n260Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,\n\n261The pleasant whining of a mandoline\n\n262And a clatter and a chatter from within\n\n263Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls\n\n264Of Magnus Martyr hold\n\n265Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.\n\n266 The river sweats\n\n267 Oil and tar\n\n268 The barges drift\n\n269 With the turning tide\n\n270 Red sails\n\n271 Wide\n\n272 To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.\n\n273 The barges wash\n\n274 Drifting logs\n\n275 Down Greenwich reach\n\n276 Past the Isle of Dogs.\n\n277 Weialala leia\n\n278 Wallala leialala\n\n279 Elizabeth and Leicester\n\n280 Beating oars\n\n281 The stern was formed\n\n282 A gilded shell\n\n283 Red and gold\n\n284 The brisk swell\n\n285 Rippled both shores\n\n286 Southwest wind\n\n287 Carried down stream\n\n288 The peal of bells\n\n289 White towers\n\n290 Weialala leia\n\n291 Wallala leialala\n\n292“Trams and dusty trees.\n\n293Highbury bore me.

What the Thunder Said\n\n322 After the torchlight red on sweaty faces\n\n323After the frosty silence in the gardens\n\n324After the agony in stony places\n\n325The shouting and the crying\n\n326Prison and palace and reverberation\n\n327Of thunder of spring over distant mountains\n\n328He who was living is now dead\n\n329We who were living are now dying\n\n330With a little patience\n\n331Here is no water but only rock\n\n332Rock and no water and the sandy road\n\n333The road winding above among the mountains\n\n334Which are mountains of rock without water\n\n335If there were water we should stop and drink\n\n336Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think\n\n337Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand\n\n338If there were only water amongst the rock\n\n339Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit\n\n340Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit\n\n341There is not even silence in the mountains\n\n342But dry sterile thunder without rain\n\n343There is not even solitude in the mountains\n\n344But red sullen faces sneer and snarl\n\n345From doors of mudcracked houses\n\n346 If there were water\n\n347 And no rock\n\n348 If there were rock\n\n349 And also water\n\n350 And water\n\n351 A spring\n\n352 A pool among the rock\n\n353 If there were the sound of water only\n\n354 Not the cicada\n\n355 And dry grass singing\n\n356 But sound of water over a rock\n\n357 Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees\n\n358 Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n\n359 But there is no water\n\n360Who is the third who walks always beside you?\n\n361When I count, there are only you and I together\n\n362But when I look ahead up the white road\n\n363There is always another one walking beside you\n\n364Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded\n\n365I do not know whether a man or a woman\n\n366—But who is that on the other side of you?\n\n367What is that sound high in the air\n\n368Murmur of maternal lamentation\n\n369Who are those hooded hordes swarming\n\n370Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth\n\n371Ringed by the flat horizon only\n\n372What is the city over the mountains\n\n373Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air\n\n374Falling towers\n\n375Jerusalem Athens Alexandria\n\n376Vienna London\n\n377Unreal\n\n378A woman drew her long black hair out tight\n\n379And fiddled whisper music on those strings\n\n380And bats with baby faces in the violet light\n\n381Whistled, and beat their wings\n\n382And crawled head downward down a blackened wall\n\n383And upside down in air were towers\n\n384Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours\n\n385And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\n\n386In this decayed hole among the mountains\n\n387In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing\n\n388Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel\n\n389There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.\n\n390It has no windows, and the door swings,\n\n391Dry bones can harm no one.\n\n392Only a cock stood on the rooftree\n\n393Co co rico co co rico\n\n394In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust\n\n395Bringing rain\n\n396Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves\n\n397Waited for rain, while the black clouds\n\n398Gathered far distant, over Himavant.\n\n399The jungle crouched, humped in silence.\n\n400Then spoke the thunder\n\n401DA\n\n402Datta: what have we given?\n\n403My friend, blood shaking my heart\n\n404The awful daring of a moment’s surrender\n\n405Which an age of prudence can never retract\n\n406By this, and this only, we have existed\n\n407Which is not to be found in our obituaries\n\n408Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider\n\n409Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor\n\n410In our empty rooms\n\n411DA\n\n412Dayadhvam: I have heard the key\n\n413Turn in the door once and turn once only\n\n414We think of the key, each in his prison\n\n415Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison\n\n416Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours\n\n417Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus\n\n418DA\n\n419Damyata: The boat responded\n\n420Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar\n\n421The sea was calm, your heart would have responded\n\n422Gaily, when invited, beating obedient\n\n423To controlling hands\n\n424 I sat upon the shore\n\n425Fishing, with the arid plain behind me\n\n426Shall I at least set my lands in order?\n\n427London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down\n\n428Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina\n\n429Quando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow\n\n430Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie\n\n431These fragments I have shored against my ruins\n\n432Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.\n\n433Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.\n\n434 Shantih shantih shantih"
