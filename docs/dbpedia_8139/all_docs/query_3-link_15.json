The poem \"The Waste Land\" by T.S. Eliot explores the theme of cultural and spiritual decay in the modern world after World War I. It uses a fragmented style with allusions to past works and a tone of resignation and despair. The structure divides the long poem into five parts with surreal vignettes in vague scenes commenting on post-war society. Eliot breaks from traditional forms which he saw as exhausted, creating a chaotic work through cultural echoes and fragments of hope.",
