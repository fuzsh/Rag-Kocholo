        "text": "Each week during Eastertide I am posting a poem that helps me engage more meaningfully with Jesus’ resurrection. Here is stanza IV of T. S. Eliot’s poem “East Coker,” which is from Four Quartets (1943). Thomas Stearns Eliot is probably the most famous twentieth-century English-language poet, renowned for his groundbreaking work typified in poems like “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (1911) and The Wasteland (1922). Eliot was born in the United States but resided in England for most of his adult life.\n\nThe wounded surgeon plies the steel\n\nThat questions the distempered part;\n\nBeneath the bleeding hands we feel\n\nThe sharp compassion of the healer’s art\n\nResolving the enigma of the fever chart.\n\nOur only health is the disease\n\nIf we obey the dying nurse\n\nWhose constant care is not to please\n\nBut to remind of our, and Adam’s curse,\n\nAnd that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.\n\nThe whole earth is our hospital\n\nEndowed by the ruined millionaire,\n\nWherein, if we do well, we shall\n\nDie of the absolute paternal care\n\nThat will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.\n\nThe chill ascends from feet to knees,\n\nThe fever sings in mental wires.\n\nIf to be warmed, then I must freeze\n\nAnd quake in frigid purgatorial fires\n\nOf which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.\n\nThe dripping blood our only drink,\n\nThe bloody flesh our only food:\n\nIn spite of which we like to think\n\nThat we are sound, substantial flesh and blood—\n\nAgain, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.\n\nPrevious poems in this series:\n\nGeorge Herbert, “Easter Wings”\n\nDenise Levertov, “On Belief in the Physical Resurrection of Jesus”"
