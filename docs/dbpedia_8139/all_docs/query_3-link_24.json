        "text": "The Waste Land is perhaps the most important single poem in English of the 20th century. It is almost impossible to overstate its range of influence—the style, the themes, and especially the pervasive tone—upon subsequent writers of both fiction and poetry. Yet there is no denying its immense difficulty; a premonition of this \" problem \" may even have been one reason for Eliot's decision to append a set of notes to the poem when it first appeared in book form (it had earlier been published in The Criterion, an English periodical, without the notes.) Since then five generations of scholars have burrowed for the sources of possible allusions and have taken pains to explain their function in the poem.\n\nA critical analysis of the thematic significance of \"waste\" throughout T.S. Elliot's, \"The Waste Land\". A brief socio-historic context is offered, with a focus on the social and personal effects of WW1. Modernist themes and tropes, as well as the effects of language used and symbolism, are analysed.\n\nAfter the World War-1, there spread chaos and disillusionment in society, faith got shattered and life became meaningless. Jean-Paul Sartre’s version of Existentialism is based on this meaninglessness and absurdity. Man faces an absurd and meaningless existence in this chaotic world. Thus these two are the main tropes of Sartre’s philosophy. T. S. Eliot also lived in that chaotic age and composed his long narrative poem The Waste Land (1930) after the World War. This poem is based on the consequences of the war that caused absurdity and chaos depriving human life of real significance and value. This study explores and analyses these aspects of meaninglessness and absurdity in The Waste Land (1930) in the light of Sartre’s philosophy and contends to say that almost all of the characters presented in the poem encounter meaningless and chaotic lives. Their lives are without any real purpose and are quite insignificant in a chaotic and disorderly world. So the land is full of the waste ..."
