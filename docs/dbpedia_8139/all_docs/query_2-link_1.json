        "text": "About the theme of The Waste Land, various interpretations have been given, Those interpretations are often conflicting and cintraductiry. Critics like F.R.Leavis feel that the theme of the poem is 'the disillusionment of a generation'. It merely presents 'a vision of dissolution and spiritual drought\", But it is very doubtful whether the public fully realized the significance of the poem. Theme of criticism of life The Waste Land, like Matthew Arnold's School Gipsy, offers a criticism of life in the sense of an interpretation of its problems. In both there is a painful consciousness o the sickness and the fever and the fret of contemporary civilization but The Waste Land goes beyond a mere diagnosis of the spiritual distempers of the age; it is a lament over mans fallen nature, a prophecy and a promise. Unlike Arnold, who suggests a cure of escape from the feverish contact of modern life. Eliot vaguely hints at the possibility of rebirth. obviously there is no assurance of this redemption but there is at least the awareness that is the only way out. The conclusion of the poem give no assurance of any sort but the basic symbol used in the poem is one of restoration into life though after hazardous quests. The legend of the Holy Grail which originated in fertility cult tells how a questing knight saved the Waste Land from drought and barrenness, occasioned. by the old age of the ruler. known as the Fisher King. The knight must restore the latter's youth by riding to the Chapel Perilous and there questioning the Lance and the Grail. symbols of the male and female principles .Eliot's poem is an allegorical application of this story to modern society and religion. Our civilization is The Waste Land; we can obtain youth and life-giving rain only by journeying far, questioning our condition and learning a ward lesson. To enforce his premise, Eliot uses symbols drawn from kindred myths and religions. in the process what ironic pictures of modern manners, what superb mingling of satiric vulgarity and sensuous delicacy. what prophetic earnestness, and what variety of imagery and rhythm are revealed. Theme of contemporary disintegration\n\nEncompassing the period of Modernist movement, Eliot's The Wasteland Land is perhaps a prime example of realistic study of the world and its society brimming with complex subject matters and experimentation in poetic technique. One of the longest poems, written with 434 lines and five sections, the poem serves as a great inspiration to many modernist as well as post-modernist writers. The fragmentary nature of time, the hollowness and meaninglessness of lives, ravages caused by the world war, violation of sex through the degeneration of love into lust are responsible for the spiritual drought in the modern wasteland. The beauty of the work lies in the fact that the poem effortlessly blends the past and the present; the East and the West. This study examines how the ideas manifested in the The Wasteland are relevant in the present world.\n\nThe term 'The Waste Land' is a pivotal and grievous abstract idea of the modern era which holds much structural complexity, obscurity and despairing tone to reflect the embody many of the cultural and intellectual issues of the present age. A well known literary personality of 20 th century , T.S Eliot published \"The Waste Land \" in 1922 after The Great War. The postwar disillusionment of 1920s led many literary figures to voice out the predicament and moral dilemma that modern life faces. T.S Eliot was one of the eminent figures who was able to depict the crisis time and connect then existing panorama with the modern age. To quote Harold Bloom, The waste land can be read as \"a testament to the disillusionment of a generation, an exposition of the manifest despair and spiritual bankruptcy of the years after world war I\". Eliot is a stern realist acutely conscious of manifold problems as well as a visionary who looks at life beyond the limits of time and space. A vivid of the uncertain world and the insincere manner of the mind is portrayed carefully in The Waste Land , which refers to the spiritual and intellectual death of the modern world which is in the verge of decay. The poem displays the disillusionment, hopelessness and cynicism of modern life and the world where tension, anxiety, depression, unrest above all an extreme decay of morality. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the social, cultural and moral decay of modern civilization due to the commercialization of life where everything is for sale. Exposing a picture of mundane waste land that symbolically suggest the spiritual death of modern men ,and is expedition of \"human failure and of perennial quest for salvation \".\n\nModern man is spiritually hollow and barren; he is just like a robot that follows the pre-assigned tasks. He wakes up early in the morning, changes his dress, takes his breakfast, goes to office, takes his lunch, returns to his home, spends time with family, takes dinner, goes to his bed and next day in the morning again follows the same routine. Modern man is inhabitant of Wasteland, although he has gained progress in science and materialistic culture, yet he has no values, he is spiritually dead. He has only one eye of Commerce his spiritual eye is closed, so he is spiritually blind. Few of the reasons for modern man's destruction are sex perversities and gambling, making false love and religious waywardness. He is confined to his routine work and helpless to act upon his religious doctrines or moral values. Religion is the only way to get deliverance, man is mortal he can be immortal just like the Holy Christ by adopting the message of God. The poem \"The Wasteland\" digs the graves of ancients and shows us their immoral activities, waywardness and spiritual barrenness and this is the great craftsmanship of the poet. Through the symbolic and allusive analysis of this poem the researcher will try to show the images of hollowness and barrenness in the present age.\n\nMost of his literary works deal with the postwar years, earning him the Noble Prize in Literature. The Waste Land was published during Europe's post-World War I identity crisis. After mental damage, cynicism and anguished nihilism spread. Under such turmoil, Eliot sought to depict the dystopian world of cruelty and irrationality known as a Utopian world of knowledge and equality. Although Eliot has not written the poem from the perspective of Marxism, it could be possible to read it from the perspective of Marxism. The Marxist approach will help us to know that Conflicts between capitalism's expanding power and the purported inherent rule of socialism have been seen in this poem. This paper will discuss how Wasteland affects the lower class people. The incoherent plots and discussions were intriguing to the lower class. Words like \"broken\" and \"shattered\" were part of their regular lexicon. In their everyday lives, people experienced resemblances to these expressions in the guise of ruined houses, crushed hopes, etc. The Marxist notion holds that the aristocracy establishes private-secondary worlds where individuals are selfkings and disengage oneself from society as a whole. The story of Marie and the archduke, Marie's cousin, is presented in the first section, titled \"The Burial of the Dead.\" Even a quick perusal of the text shows that Marie was a member of an aristocratic social group. When we first see that the archduke took just Marie on a sledge, we get a peek at the secret world that she inhabits and the world around her. This contributed to the formation of a private-secondary world around them.\n\nAbstract T. S. Eliot in his poem, The Waste Land, examines the way that people think and their minds through the modern individual perspectives. The waste Land is considered one of the greatest modernist poems that criticizes the esoteric nature of such times and eras with similar deeds and qualities. This paper tries to analyze this piece of literature in the lights of modernism examining Eliot’s intense use of the metaphorical language throughout the whole poem. Also, I will handle two main points in the poem which are the allusion that the text implies or refers and the incoherent flow structure; that is to find the aim of this literary work which is considered as a meaningful master piece. Despite the fragmented design or structure of it, The Waste Land indicates multiple moral and critical subjects that fully prove the way which the world -mankind- lives and behaves in the eyes of modernism."
