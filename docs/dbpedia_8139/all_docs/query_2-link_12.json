        "text": "'The Waste Land' summary\n\n'The Waste Land'Published in:1922Written by:T.S EliotStructure:Five PartsRhyme scheme:Free verseThemes:The effects of WW1 on European civilisation.Literary devices:Dramatic monologueImagery:The desert, water, European cities, rain.\n\n'The Waste Land' background\n\nIn 'The Waste Land', Eliot uses the ‘voices’ of ordinary people, alongside heroes from myths and legends, and the great works of European literature and music. In the poem, we meet Madam Sosostris, a clairvoyant, Mr Eugenides a merchant from Smyrna, a female typist and her lover, a middle-class couple caught in a difficult marriage, a group of women in a pub, and a host of other characters.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe Victorian era had come to an abrupt end with the First World War. The stability which had appeared to dominate social life was found to be an illusion. In the place of tradition (social and aesthetic) came new uncertainties. The ideal of steady progression turned out to be empty. The technological advancements which were to bring improved living conditions and progress brought death and misery, as well as social isolation. Eliot's poem attempted to show that all that was left were fragments of the 'old'.\n\nLiterary Context\n\n'The Waste land' is a poem in the Modernist tradition. In some ways, it can be said to have set the standard for the movement in poetry.\n\nModernism was a literary, philosophical and artistic movement which abandoned Victorian traditionalism. It aimed, across these disciplines, to start again, to do something new. In literature, it was associated with fresh poetic expressions, or new ways of writing, like Eliot's free verse or James Joyce's stream of consciousness monologues, like those found in his 1922 novel Ulysses.\n\n'The Waste Land' was important because it signified a turn away from older and more established forms of poetry (those especially known as Romanticism and Victorianism), and dealt with the banal and negative aspects of human experience. The opening line of the poem sets the poem’s course, evoking earlier literary tradition, something which Eliot had done in 'Prufrock' (1915) and would continue to do in later poems like 'Four Quartets' (1943). The poem begins with the words ‘April is the cruellest month…’. This is an echo of the open line of Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales: (1387-1400) ‘Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote…’.\n\nRomanticism was a literary and artistic movement which emphasised the individual experience and the beauty of the natural world. It arose between the mid-18th to the mid 19th century.\n\nVictorian poetry (Victorianism) was characterised by pessimism and the conflict between science and religion.\n\nEliot’s aim was to reimagine the literary canon, pulling together the fragments of culture left behind after WW1 into some kind of unity, and in doing so, to preserve Western civilisation. This overall aim is summarised in two of the last lines of the poem: the metaphorical 'fall' of London and the use of the poetic fragments of past tradition to recreate something new in 'The Waste Land':\n\nLondon Bridge is falling down falling down falling down. (Line 426)\n\nAnd then, a few lines further down:\n\nLe Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie\n\nThese fragments I have shored against my ruins. (Line 430–431)\n\nAside from the wide range of sources from the English literary canon, Eliot drew on two main external sources for the poem. These were the book From Ritual to Romance (1920) by Jessie Weston and James Frazer’s The Golden Bough (1890). Apart from these, 'The Waste Land' contains many other sources, allusions and references to other works, both literary and musical. The poem was written shortly after WW1 and echoes of this traumatic period can be felt throughout the poem. Eliot wrote 'The Waste Land' because he wanted to explore British life in the post-war years.\n\nEliot had originally written a much longer version of the poem, but this was edited by Ezra Pound, who removed large chunks, including the first 54 lines. Because of Pound’s influence on the final version, the poem is dedicated to him. In the dedication, Eliot calls Pound ‘the better craftsman’ (Il Miglior Fabro).\n\n'The Waste Land' went through a series of revisions. Originally, it was called ‘He Do the Police in Different Voices’. The title was taken from Charles Dickens’ book Our Mutual Friend (1865). But in the end, Eliot went with the title we now know.\n\n'The Waste Land' structure\n\nThe poem has five parts:\n\nThe Burial of the Dead\n\nA Game of Chess\n\nThe Fire Sermon\n\nDeath by Water\n\nWhat the Thunder Said\n\nEach of these parts is subdivided; each subsection is a study of one aspect of post-war England. 'The Waste Land' is written in free or open verse. There is no continuous rhyme scheme, although there are instances of rhyme, normally in couplets.\n\n'The Waste Land' themes\n\nOverall, it is difficult to say what 'The Waste Land' is about because it has multiple themes and offers multiple perspectives. It is about both decay and fertility; it is about mundane human existence and the effects of automation; it is about the city of London and Europe, as well as the mythical past; and it is about the hope of restoration.\n\nThe main themes of the poem are the shattering of Enlightenment rationalism. The themes are conveyed through the topography of the poem (the riverside, the desert, the city apartment, the foothills of the Himalayas) as well as in the characters who populate the poem, some real and some mythical or legendary. As for topography, along with places in and around London, there are references in the poem to several other important places, including Paris, Munich, Jerusalem, Athens, Alexandria, and Vienna. The final part of the poem is set in Northern India. These relate to the centres of European civilisation, philosophy and art, and to the spiritual sources of both western and eastern religions.\n\nEnlightenment rationalism emphasised the use of logic in the pursuit of knowledge, rather than using the senses. It said that although knowledge comes through experience, it was necessary to use reason to experience.\n\n'The Waste Land' characters\n\nThere are two key characters in the poem who act as cyphers for the main themes. One of them is named and the other is only alluded to: Tiresias and the Fisher King.\n\nTiresius is a mythical Greek figure who could see into the future (a clairvoyant) and was also blind. He was changed into a woman for seven years (which is why Eliot refers to him as both blind and as having breasts). 'The Waste Land' is Eliot’s attempt to prophesy, like Tiresius, the downfall of his adopted country (Britain). Through Tiresius, the poem becomes a study of national decay.\n\nThe Fisher King comes from Arthurian legend. He is the guardian of the Holy grail and is wounded in the groin. He fishes in a small boat on a river. In the poem, Eliot has him doing exactly that, but on a canal:\n\nWhile I was fishing in the dull canal\n\nOn a winter evening round behind the gashouse\n\nMusing upon the king my brother’s wreck\n\nAnd on the king my father’s death before him. (Line 189–192)\n\nBecause the Fisher King has been wounded in the groin, he is infertile. Eliot uses him as a metaphor for the infertility of the country after the war.\n\nEliot drew on other sources from literature, including Charles Baudelaire, Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Ovid, and Homer, as well as from classical and popular music. In this way, the poem is both high and low-brow. All these sources come together to convey what the author has ‘seen’ (like Tiresias the blind clairvoyant). It is no accident that Eliot had originally used lines from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899) as the epitaph of 'The Waste Land': ‘The horror, the horror’. As E.M. Forster said, ‘It is about the fertilizing waters that arrived too late. It is a poem of horror. The earth is barren, the sea salt, the fertilizing thunderstorm broke too late. And the horror is so intense that the poet has inhibition and is unable to state it openly.’ ¹\n\nTS Eliot and 'The Waste Land'\n\nThe Waste Land is a bleak poem. Some have said that this is because it is the result of a nervous disorder which Eliot experienced. He took three months off to recover from it and headed to the sea at Margate in Kent to do so. He wrote some of the poem there, and there are some lines about it in the third section, ‘The Fire Sermon’. Eliot’s nervous disorder (he called it a nervous breakdown) can be felt in the lines:\n\nOn Margate Sands.\n\nI can connect\n\nNothing with nothing.\n\nThe broken fingernails of dirty hands.\n\nMy people humble people who expect\n\nNothing. (Line 300–305)\n\nThere is a feeling of depression in these lines, which some have said is autobiographical.\n\nEliot’s marriage to Vivienne Haigh-Wood was difficult, especially because Vivienne suffered from depression. The strain of their marriage may have influenced the second part of the poem, A Game of Chess:\n\n“My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.\n\n“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.\n\n“What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?\n\n“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”. (Line 111–114)\n\n'The Waste Land' quotes\n\n'The Waste Land' is full of memorable quotes. The opening lines are perhaps the most quoted:\n\nApril is the cruellest month, breeding\n\nLilacs out of the dead land, mixing\n\nMemory and desire, stirring\n\nDull roots with spring rain. (Line 1–4)\n\nOther famous lines include:\n\nIn the mountains, there you feel free.\n\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. (Line 17–18)\n\nAnd:\n\nWhat are the roots that clutch, what branches grow\n\nOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,\n\nYou cannot say, or guess, for you know only\n\nA heap of broken images, where the sun beats,\n\nAnd the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,\n\nAnd the dry stone no sound of water. (Line 19–20)\n\nBut perhaps the best-known line is:\n\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust. (Line 30)\n\nThe meaning of these lines is debated and uncertain. In fact, to help the reader understand the poem, Eliot provided end notes. It is likely that these end notes are there to flesh out the poem because it was too short to publish on its own, or perhaps as a kind of intellectual game. Books have been written about the purpose of the end notes, as they are uncommon in poetry.\n\nAlong with the allusions and references to European cities, Eliot uses a variety of languages. There are sections or lines in German, Russian, French, and Sanskrit. There is even a section in Cockney. The purpose of these is uncertain, but it is possible that, like the poem, they are meant to disorient the reader.\n\nEliot used a poetic technique called the objective correlative, designed to enable the reader to feel what was meant rather than simply to read about it. There’s a good example of this in these lines:\n\nIf there were water\n\nAnd no rock\n\nIf there were rock\n\nAnd also water\n\nAnd water\n\nA spring\n\nA pool among the rock\n\nIf there were the sound of water only\n\nNot the cicada\n\nAnd dry grass singing\n\nBut sound of water over a rock\n\nWhere the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees\n\nDrip drop drip drop drop drop drop\n\nBut there is no water. (Line 346–358)\n\nTo describe the absence of water, Eliot describes water in several ways: the repetition of the word ‘water’, a reference to a songbird found near water, and the sound of water dripping. He ends with the words ‘But there is no water’. By using water imagery to describe the lack of water, Eliot evokes thirst or a longing for water in the reader. There is an ‘objective’ correlation between the words on the page and the feelings evoked by the words on the page.\n\nThe philosophy of 'The Waste Land'\n\nEliot's revolutionary poem says that life has fractured because of the war, technology, and the ensuing isolation of both. Modern life is a disaster, affecting social norms and traditions, communities, the landscape, and with no remedy in sight. There is a distant hope, but it does not materialise in the poem. It is the promise of rain, and of peace, symbolised by the spiritual statement at the end of the poem:\n\nShantih, shantih, shantih' (Line 433)\n\nThis is an incantation. It is not the realisation of peace, but the declaration that there should be peace and fertility in the land.\n\nThe Waste Land - Key takeaways\n\nEliot wrote 'The Waste Land' in Margate, where he was recovering from a nervous disorder.\n\n'The Waste Land' was published in 1922.\n\nAfter WW1, Europe was in a state of destruction. 'The Waste Land' attempts to convey this.\n\nThe poem is structured into five parts, with each subsection a study of one aspect of post-war England.\n\nThe poem was influenced by the myths of The Fisher King, an Arthurian legend, and Tiresias, a figure from Greek mythology.\n\nReferences\n\nE.
