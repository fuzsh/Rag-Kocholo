        "text": "T.S. Eliot, 1888-1965\n\nThe Waste Land (1923)\n\nPS3509.L43 W3 1923Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nThis poem begins with the famous line âApril is the cruelest month.â It was edited by Ezra Pound as well as Eliot and it became a significant Modernist document. This poem, like Poundâs âCantos,â contains languages other than English. It is also written using the voices ofÂ several different speakers, whoÂ talk about despair, an inability to consummate love, and a lack of spirituality. This long poem is made of fragments which seem unconnected, partially as a result of the various speakers in the poem. William Carlos Williams once stated that the poem hit the world âlike an atom bomb.\" His comment is particularly interesting becauseÂ there was no atom bomb during that time.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ The Undergraduate Poems of T.S. Eliot (1949)\n\nPS3509.L43 A6 1948yÂ Â Â Â\n\nThis slim volume contains poems of Eliotâs that were published in The Harvard Advocate. The poems were written from 1907 to 1910 and the final poem in the collection was one that he read for his commencement.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nOld Possumâs Book of Practical Cats (1982)\n\nPS3509.L43 O55 1982Â Â Â Â\n\nAlthough this book was first published in 1939, this later edition is noteworthy because it is illustrated by Edward Gorey. The poems within are all about cats and were written for T. S. Eliot's godchildren. Well-known poems include âMr. Mistoffeleesâ and âThe Rum Tum Tugger.âÂ The cats and poems from this book were brought to the stage in 1981 in the musical Cats, which is still being played around the world.Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nT.S.
