        "text": "Notes\n\n1] [Title.] T. S. Eliot's notes to The Waste Land are bold-faced and retain their original lineation. The indispensable work on the poem's composition is T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound, ed. Valerie Eliot (London: Faber and Faber, 1971; PR 6009 .L5W3 1971 Trinity College Library).\n\nNot only the title, but the plan and a\n\ngood deal of the incidental symbolism\n\nof the poem were suggested by Miss Jesse L.\n\nWeston's book on the Grail legend: From\n\nRitual to Romance (Macmillan). Indeed, so\n\ndeeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will\n\nelucidate the difficulties of the poem much\n\nbetter than my notes can do; and I recom-\n\nmend it (apart from the great interest of the\n\nbook itself) to any who think such elucidation of the\n\npoem worth the trouble. To another\n\nwork of anthropology I am indebted in general,\n\none which has influenced our generation pro-\n\nfoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have\n\nused especially the two volumes Atthis Adonis\n\nOsiris. Anyone who is acquainted with these\n\nworks will immediately recognise in the poem\n\ncertain references to vegetation ceremonies. [Eliot's note]\n\nEliot's title refers to the ancient legend of the Fisher King, the ruler of the Waste Land, so-called in the Perceval versions of the Grail legend because it was doomed to barrenness until the King, who was wounded in the sexual organs, was healed by a knight of great purity. The legend exists in many versions, pagan and Christian, and originated in pagan fertility rites celebrating the movement of Nature from barren winter to fertile lifeful spring and often involving human sacrifice to bring about this natural rebirth. Usually the King was killed, his flowing blood being taken as the power that rejuvenates the land. In the Fisher King legend, however, there is no human sacrifice: the King stands for the land, in his barrenness, and his healing accordingly comes to symbolize the land's healing.\n\nSee Jessie Laidlay Weston, From Ritual to Romance (1920: Cambridge: University Press, 1957; PN 686 G7 W45 Robarts Library):\n\nThe distinctive feature of the Perceval version is the insistence upon the sickness, and disability of the ruler of the land, the Fisher King. Regarded first as the direct cause of the wasting of the land, it gradually assumes overwhelming importance, the task of the Quester becomes that of healing the King ... (13-14)\n\n(a) There is a general consensus of evidence to the effect that the main object of the Quest is the restoration to health and vigour of a King suffering from infirmity caused by wounds, sickness, or old age;\n\n(b) and whose infirmity, for some mysterious and unexplained reason, reacts disastrously upon his kingdom, either depriving it of vegetation, or exposing it to the ravages of war.\n\n(c) In two cases it is definitely stated that the King will be restored to youthful vigour and beauty.\n\n(d) In both cases where we find Gawain as the hero of the story, and in one connected with Perceval, the misfortune which has fallen upon the country is that of a prolonged drought, which has destroyed vegetation, and left the land Waste; the effect of the hero's question is to restore the waters to their channel, and render the land once more fertile.\n\n(e) In three cases the misfortunes and wasting of the land are the result of war, and directly caused by the hero's failure to ask the question ... (20-21)\n\nIn the English Middle Ages the Fisher King legend became associated with the Arthurian legends, especially that of the quest for the Holy Grail (the vessel supposed to have been used by Jesus at the Last Supper). One of Arthur's knights, on a quest, endures temptations and agonies in the Waste Land, all of which culminate in the ordeal of the Chapel Perilous; then, through the Grail, he becomes able to heal the Fisher King, and the land regains its fertility. In some versions, the knight's final test is his arrival at a castle where a beautiful young girl brings him the Grail (or other symbols), and where he must ask certain right questions; failure to do so sometimes causes the previously fertile land to become waste; Grail Castle must be reached by crossing a water-filled moat; the questor must be motivated by a desire to save the land, not to attain some personal end. The Grail is symbolically associated with the lance, the female and male symbols.\n\n[Epigraph.] Sybil's response, which Eliot places in Greek letters, is here transliterated and italicized. \"And as for the Sibyl, I saw her with my own eyes at Cumae, suspended in a bottle, and when boys asked her, `Sibyl, what is your wish?', she would reply, `I want to die.'\" (Petronius, Satyricon, trans. P.-G. Walsh [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996]: chapter 48, p. 39; PA 6558 E5W3 Robarts Library). The Sybil of Cumae, a gatekeeper of the underworld, asked the gods for as many years of life as grains of sand in her hand, but forgot to ask for physical youth along with them. She was an oracle who divulged her knowledge by flinging from her cave handfuls of leaves, which the seeker of knowledge had to catch and try to put in order.\n\n[Dedication.] For Ezra Pound, \"the better craftsman\" (Italian). Eliot alludes to Pound's title for a chapter on Arnaut Daniel in The Spirit of Romance (London: J. M. Dent, 1910).\n\nLines 1-4 echo Geoffrey Chaucer's \"General Prologue\" of The Canterbury Tales, lines 1-18 (from the Hengwrt manuscript):\n\nWhan that Aueryll with his Shoures soote\n\nThe droghte of March hath perced to the roote\n\nAnd bathed euery veyne in swich lycour\n\nOf which vertu engendred is the flour\n\nWhan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth\n\nInspired hath in euery holt and heeth\n\nThe tendre croppes and the yonge sonne\n\nHath in the Ram his half cours yronne\n\nAnd smale foweles maken melodye\n\nThat slepen al the nyght with open Iye\n\nSo priketh hem nature in hir corages\n\nThanne longen folk to goon on pilgrymages\n\nAnd Palmeres for to seeken straunge strondes\n\nTo ferne halwes kouthe in sondry londes\n\nAnd specially from euery shyres ende\n\nOf Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende\n\nThe holy blisful martir for to seke\n\nThat hem hath holpen whan that they weere seeke\n\n[Modern English translation]\n\nWhen April with his sweet showers\n\nhas pierced the drought of March to the root\n\nand bathed every vein with such a fluid\n\nof whose power is engendered the flower,\n\nwhen also the West Wind with his sweet breath\n\nhas quickened in every wood and plain\n\nthe tender shoots, and the young sun\n\nhas run in the Ram his halfway course,\n\nand small birds make music\n\nwho sleep all night with an open eye --\n\nso nature spurs the life-force in them --\n\nthen people yearn to go on pilgrimages,\n\nand palmers to seek out foreign ways\n\nto far-off shrines known in various lands,\n\nand especially from every shire's end\n\nof England they travel to Canterbury\n\nto seek out the holy, blessed martyr\n\nwho has helped them when they were sick.\n\nBack to Line\n\n6] feeding / A little life: Eliot alludes to James Thomson's poem, \"To Our Ladies of Death,\" The City of Dreadful Night and Other Poems (London: Reeves and Turner, 1880; B-12 6999 Fisher Rare Book Library):\n\nOur Mother feedeth thus our little life,\n\nThat we may in turn feed her with our death\n\nBack to Line\n\n8] Starnbergersee: a lake south of Munich. Back to Line\n\n10] Hofgarten: \"the manor- or house-garden,\" a public park in Munich. Back to Line\n\n12] \"I am no Russian, I come from Lithuania, true German.\" Back to Line\n\n19] Compare Luke 8:1-15, Jesus's parable of the sower, who sowed seed variously at the road-side, on a rock, among thorns, and on good ground. \"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture\" (8:6). \"They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away\" (8:13). Back to Line\n\n20] Cf. Ezekiel II, i. [Eliot's note] The Son of man is mortal man, addressed by God in a vision in Ezekiel: \"Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me ...\" (2:3). Ezekiel's mission is to prophesy the destruction of Jerusalem (that is, the city of man) and the enslavement of its people in Babylonian captivity; and God warns, \"In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished\" (6:6); and \"the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord\" (12:20). God also foretells to Ezekiel the eventual restoration of Israel after its exile in the desert:\n\nThe hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,\n\nAnd caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.\n\nAnd he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.\n\nAgain he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.\n\nThus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live. (37:1-5)\n\nBack to Line\n\n23] Cf. Ecclesiastes XII, v. [Eliot's note]\n\nRemember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them .... In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened .... Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets ..... Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.\n\nBack to Line\n\n25] \"this red rock\" has several interpretations. (1) Compare Isaiah 32:1-3, the prophecy concerning Christ's coming: \"Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.\" (2) In one version of the Grail legend (Parzifal), the Grail is said to be a stone, and those called to its quest are like children growing up under its shadow. (3) St. Peter (whose name means \"stone\"), the first Pope, is the rock on which Christ foretold he would build his church.\n\nEliot's early poem, \"The Death of S. Narcissus,\" supplied lines 25-30. For the text, see Poems Written in early Youth, ed. John Hayward (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1967). Back to Line\n\n28] Compare Philaster's words on the need to preach \"How all the good you have is but a shadow, / I' th' morning with you, and at night behind you\", in Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's Philaster, III.ii. Back to Line\n\n30] For \"a handful of dust,\" see the Anglican rite for \"The Burial of the Dead\":\n\nThen, while the earth shall be cast upon the body by some standing by, the Priest shall say, `Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed: we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our incorruptible body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.\n\nBack to Line\n\n31] V. Tristan und Isolde, I, verses 5-8. [Eliot's note] These verses are sung by a sailor on the ship bringing Isolde to Cornwall to marry King Mark, uncle to Tristan: \"The wind blow fresh / toward land of home: / My Irish child, / where do you roam?\" (Richard Wagner, Tristam and Isolde, trans. Stewart Robb [New York: Dutton, 1965]: 2-3). The sailor's naive and happy love for his \"Irish child\" contrasts with the tragically ending courtly (that is, secret) love of Tristan and Isolde. Back to Line\n\n35] The hyacinth is a flower supposed to have sprung from the blood of Hyacinthus, a son of a king of Sparta loved by both Apollo and Zephyrus, and slain by the latter when the boy only returned the love of Apollo. As the god was playing quoits with Hyacinthus, the god of the wind blew a quoit thrown by Apollo so that it struck the boy and killed him. Back to Line\n\n41] Compare Dante's Paradiso, XII, 28, for another \"heart of light.\" Dante, with Beatrice, his guide, reaches the second level of heaven, which is another circle of lights that sing, dance and speak, and there \"from out of the heart of one of the new lights there moved a voice ...\" (that of St. Bonaventura, leader of the Franciscans). Back to Line\n\n42] Id. III, verse 24. [Eliot's note] That is, in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, the words of the shepherd telling Tristam there is no sign of Isolde coming to heal his mortal wound: \"Bleak and bare the sea\" (Wagner, trans. Robb, pp. 108-09). Back to Line\n\n43] Sosostris is the name of an Egyptian king. Eliot may have been influenced by Aldous Huxley's novel Crome Yellow (London: Chatto and Windus, 1921), in which a Mr Scogan disguises himself as \"Sesostris, the Sorceress of Ecbatana\" and pretends to be a clairvoyant. Back to Line\n\n46] I am not familiar with the exact consti-\n\ntution of the Tarot pack of cards, from which\n\nI have obviously departed to suit my own\n\nconvenience. The Hanged Man, a member of\n\nthe traditional pack, fits my purpose in two\n\nways: because he is associated in my mind\n\nwith the Hanged God of Frazer, and because\n\nI associate him with the hooded figure in the\n\npassage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V.\n\nThe Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant\n\nappear later; also the \"crowds of people,\"\n\nand Death by Water is executed in Part IV.\n\nThe Man with Three Staves (an authentic\n\nmember of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite\n\narbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself. [Eliot's note]\n\nThe Tarot cards were used originally as a part of fertility rites to \"predict the rise and fall of the waters which brought fertility to the land\" (Weston, From Ritual to Romance [1920: 1957]: 80). The cards have four suits: cup (hearts), lance (diamonds), sword (spades), and dish (clubs; Weston, 77). Among the cards are the Fool, the High Priestess, the Wheel of Fortune, the Hanged Man, and Death, but evidently no blank card, no drowned sailor. Certain other figures Eliot mentions here cannot be identified in the pack. The man with three staves may be the Pope, who carries a triple cross (which has two cross-bars). The one-eyed merchant and his pack are likely the Fool, who on the Tarot card carries, on a wand over his back, a wallet or pack, the lock of which is in the form of a single eye. The Tarot symbolism suggests that the wallet contains the sum of past human experience, and that the eye which is the key to it is the all-seeing eye (compare the eye of Horus in Egyptian myth), the visionary power, by which man can gain access to a universal memory. Back to Line\n\n48] This quotation is from Ariel's song to Prince Ferdinand in Shakespeare's The Tempest (I.2.398), where the air-spirit refers to Ferdinand's father, King Alonzo, whom he thinks has just drowned in an illusory storm at sea that was of Ariel's doing:\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n\nOf his bones are coral made;\n\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n\nNothing of him that doth fade\n\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\n\nInto something rich and strange.\n\nSea-nymphs hourly sing his knell.\n\nBack to Line\n\n49] Leonardo da Vinci painted the \"Madonna of the Rocks\" (the Virgin Mary). \"Belladonna\" means \"fair lady\" and is the name of a poisonous plant called deadly nightshade. Back to Line\n\n56] Perhaps a reference to the damned in Dante's Inferno, who are imprisoned in various circles descending to the lowest, in which Satan is fixed. Back to Line\n\n60] Cf. Baudelaire:\n\n\"Fourmillante cité, cité pleine de rûves,\n\n\"Où le spectre en plein jour raccroche le passant!\"\n\n[Eliot's note]\n\nBaudelaire's \"Les Sept Viellards,\" that is, \"The Seven Old Men,\" which begins:\n\nSwarming city, city full of dreams,\n\nWhere the spectre in broad daylight buttonholes the passer-by.\n\n(Les Fleurs du Mal [Paris: Alphonse Lemerre, 1917]: 159). Back to Line\n\n63] Cf. Inferno III, 55-57:\n\n\"si lunga tratta\n\ndi gente, ch'io non avrei mai creduto\n\nche morte tanta n'avesse disfatta.\"\n\n[Eliot's note]\n\nVirgil leads Dante into the underworld, a dark plain just before they reach the great river over which Charon ferries the damned. There Dante sees a vast number, uttering cries in great pain: these are souls never sufficiently alive to be good or evil, but who cared only meanly for themselves: \"And I looked and saw a flag that, whirling about, ran so quickly that it seemed to scorn to pause; and behind it came so long a line of people that I should never have believed death had undone so many.\" Back to Line\n\n64] Cf. Inferno IV, 25-27:\n\n\"Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,\n\n\"non avea pianto, ma' che di sospiri,\n\n\"che l'aura eterna facevan tremare.\"\n\n[Eliot's note]\n\nDante crosses the river and enters Hell's first circle, which holds those who (though they did not sin greatly) were no Christians and so were never baptized. \"Here there was no lamentation that could be heard except sighs, which made the eternal air tremble; and this arose from the sadness, without agony, of the many, great crowds both of children and of men and women.\" Back to Line\n\n66] King William Street, in London, throngs with office workers at the morning rush hour. Saint Mary Woolnoth is a church at the corner of King William and Lombard streets and was across the street from Eliot's work-place, Lloyd's Bank. Back to Line\n\n68] A phenomenon which I have often\n\nnoticed. [Eliot's note] Back to Line\n\n69] Stetson: Eliot certainly knew Ezra Pound, who, an expatriot American, sometimes sported a stetson hat. Back to Line\n\n70] In the Gulf of Milazzo, on the northern coast of Sicily, Rome won its first victory at sea over the Carthaginians in the first Punic war, which was launched over the profits of trade. Back to Line\n\n74] The Dog could refer to (1) the Dog star, Sirius, who heralded the rising of the Nile waters; (2) the word \"God,\" reversed; (3) Psalms 22:20, \"Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog\"; or (4) as Eliot later says in his poem \"Marina,\" \"Those who sharpen the tooth of the dog, meaning / Death.\"\n\nCf. the Dirge in Webster's White Devil. [Eliot's note]\n\nThis is sung by a madwoman to her son over the corpse of his brother (whom he has killed):\n\nCall for the robin redbreast and the wren,\n\nSince o'er shady groves they hover,\n\nAnd with leaves and flowers do cover\n\nThe friendless bodies of unburied men.\n\nCall unto his funeral dole\n\nThe ant, the field-mouse, and the mole,\n\nTo rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm,\n\nAnd, when gay tombs are robbed, sustain no harm;\n\nBut keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men,\n\nFor with his nails he'll dig them up again.\n\nBack to Line\n\n76] V. Baudelaire, Preface to Fleurs du Mal. [Eliot's note]\n\nC'est l'Ennui! ....\n\nTu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,\n\nHypocrite lecteur! mon semblable, mon frère! (p. 9)\n\n[It's boredom! ....\n\nYou know him, reader, this dainty monster,\n\nHypocritical reader! my double, my brother!\n\nBack to Line\n\n77] The title has many associations. (1) It recollects the chess game in Thomas Middleton's Women Beware Women, in which a widow is distracted by the playing of a game of chess from the duke's seduction of her daughter-in-law Bianca in the next room (almost described as a rape, and in double entendre imaged as a chess game). (2) The chess game often represents man's mortality -- for example, Igmar Bergman's film, The Seventh Seal, shows life as a chess game with Death. (3) In the Grail legend, the knight sometimes visits a chessboard castle, where he meets a water-maiden. (4) At the end of Shakespeare's The Tempest the two ancient rival kingdoms of Milan and Naples are united in the promised marriage of Prince Ferdinand and Prospero's daughter, Miranda, who are discovered together playing a game of chess -- signifying the rational basis of their love, their pre-marital chastity, and their marriage as the reduction of a real war to a mere game between lovers. (5) In chess, two kings strive for supremacy by manipulating and sacrificing their Queens, Knights, Bishops, Castles, and Pawns (soldiers), although in fact the two Kings are the weakest pieces on the board.\n\nCf. Antony and Cleopatra, II, ii, 190. [Eliot's note]\n\nThis is Enobarbus' description of Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen, as she floats on her ship down the Cydnus River to meet Antony (II.2.192-206):\n\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,\n\nBurned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\n\nPurple the sails, and so perfumèd that\n\nThe winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,\n\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\n\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\n\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\n\nIt beggared all description: she did lie\n\nIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,\n\nO'erpicturing that Venus where we see\n\nThe fancy outwork nature. On each side her\n\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\n\nWith divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem\n\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\n\nAnd what they undid did.\n\nThere are also reminiscences here of the descriptions of Imogen's room in Shakespeare's Cymbeline. In order to convince Posthumous that he has seduced his wife Imogen, the cunning Iachimo visits her room while she is asleep and writes down the details of the bedroom's decoration, and certain distinguishing marks on Imogen's body. The room is hung with tapestries of the meeting of Antony and Cleopatra, and of chaste Diana bathing, and\n\nThe roof o' th' chamber\n\nWith golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons --\n\nI had forgot them -- were two winking Cupids\n\nOf silver, each on one foot standing, nicely\n\nDepending on their brands. (II.4.87-91)\n\nNote also that Imogen has just put down a book of the rape of Philomela and had marked her place \"Where Philomel gave up\" (II.2.44-46). Back to Line\n\n83] Eliot's description of the make-up table resembles Belinda's where she sits primping on the day of her \"rape\" in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (an 18th-century mock-heroic poem about the social furor caused when a nobleman snips off two prized locks of hair from a coquette's hair).\n\nAnd now, unveiled the toilet stands displayed,\n\nEach silver vase in mystic order laid ....\n\nUnnumbered treasures ope at once, and here\n\nThe various treasures of the world appear;\n\nFrom each she nicely culls with curious toil,\n\nAnd decks the Goddess with the glittering spoil.\n\nThis casket India's glowing gems unlocks,\n\nAnd all Arabia breathes from yonder box.\n\n(I.121.2, 129-34)\n\nBack to Line\n\n92] Laquearia. V. Aeneid, I, 726:\n\ndependent lychni laquearibus aureis\n\nincensi, et noctem flammis funalia vincunt.\n\n[Eliot's note]\n\nAeneus, the last son of Trojan Priam, and the founder-to-be of Rome, escapes from burning Troy, and after many misadventures reaches Carthage (on the Mediterranean shore of present-day Tunesia, in northern Africa), the Punic capital of Queen Dido. Aeneus's mother, Venus, took him under her protection against Juno, Queen of Heaven, who supports the Greeks and has a temple in Carthage. So as to secure Aeneus from Juno's evil influence there, Venus puts Aeneus to sleep on the night in which he is supposed to attend a feast given by Dido and doubles for him her other son, Cupid, whom she tells to arouse Dido's desire for Aeneus' image. Dido receives the false Aeneus on her golden couch beneath rich tapestries and falls in love quickly. Just before Dido proposes a toast and asks the false Aeneus to tell his adventures, Virgil describes the sensuously rich hall in lines that Eliot here adapts: \"lighted lamps hang down from the fretted roof of gold, [i.e., laquearia] and flaming torches drive out the night\" (Virgil, 2 vols., rev. edn., ed. and trans. H. Rushton Fairclough [London: Heinemann, 1935]: I, 342-43; PR 6801 A2 Robarts Library). Aeneus and Dido become lovers, and when he leaves Carthage to fulfil his destiny she commits suicide. Their unmarried love -- Dido was widowed when her brother killed her husband -- proved disastrous for her country, which Rome went on to defeat and destroy. Carthage, the city of Juno, goddess of marriage, was doomed once Venus intervened. Back to Line\n\n98] Sylvan scene. V. Milton, Paradise Lost, IV, 140. [Eliot's note]\n\nThe woodland view describes a hill with \"hairy sides\" in Eden on the very top of which rests Paradise, the garden in which Adam and Eve lived innocent. Satan sees this \"sylvan scene\" as, having escaped Hell and passed through Chaos, he approaches Paradise to seduce man to disobedience from God's commands. Satan succeeds in seducing Eve and through her Adam, and the first couple then are exiled from the garden to live in a harsher world, one that exacts pain in work and in the labour of childbirth and that ends inevitably in death. Back to Line\n\n99] V. Ovid, Metamorphoses, VI, Philomela. [Eliot's note]\n\nPhilomela (daughter of Pandion, king of Athens) went by sea to visit her sister Procne, who had married Tereus, king of Trace. Tereus accompanied Philomela from Athens, and when they disembarked he took her to a hut in a dark wood and violently raped the virgin. When she threatened to accuse him, Tereus cut out her tongue with his sword and raped her again in her blood. Shut up afterwards for a year in that hut, Philomela cleverly wove into a tapestry the story of her sufferings and had it conveyed to her sister, who then found her prison and secretly brought her back to Tereus' palace, where they plotted revenge. Procne seized her own son (by Tereus), Itys, who looked like his father, and stabbed him in the chest and cut his throat. The two sisters then butchered the boy's body, cooked it by boiling in kettles and by roasting on skewers over a fire, and served the meat to Tereus, who made it a feast. Philomela then appeared before Tereus and flung the boy's bloody head at him. Before Tereus could murder the sisters, they all changed into birds: Tereus into a hoopoe bird, Procne into a swallow, and Philomela into a nightingale, who sings according to legend with her breast pressed against a thorn -- assuredly a sexual image -- a plaintive song of great beauty on love's mixed joy and sorrow. See Ovid, Metamorphoses, ed. and trans. Frank Justus Miller, 2nd edn. (London: Heinemann, 1921): 424-674; I, pp. 316-35; PA 6519 M2 1921 Robarts Library. Back to Line\n\n100] Cf. Part III l. 204. [Eliot's note] Back to Line\n\n103] \"Jug jug\" are words often used in Elizabethan poetry for the nightingale's song, and as slang for sexual intercourse. John Lyly's lyric from his play Alexander and Campaspe is an example:\n\nWhat bird so sings, yet does so wail?\n\nOh, 'tis the ravished nightingale.\n\nJug, jug, jug, jug, tereu! she cries,\n\nAnd still her woes at midnight rise.\n\nBrave prick-song!\n\nThe second cry, \"tereu!\", of course recalls the name of the rapist king in the story of Philomela. Back to Line\n\n111] The next 25 lines echo the closet scene in Shakespeare's Hamlet where the young prince confronts his mother Gertrude with the ugly lechery and incest of her marriage with Claudius, the brother of her first husband (Hamlet's father), and also his murder. Frightened when Hamlet kills Polonius in her bedchamber and then accuses her viciously of lechery, Queen Gertrude cries out, \"O Hamlet, speak no more,\" and \"O, speak to me no more\" (III.4.89, 95), but Hamlet does not calm down until after the Ghost, his father King Hamlet, enters to remind him of his duty to carry out revenge against Claudius. He tells Hamlet to comfort his mother, \"Speak to her, Hamlet\" (116). Because Gertrude cannot see the Ghost, she is amazed:\n\nQueen. To whom do you speak this?\n\nHamlet. Do you see nothing there?\n\nQueen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.\n\nHamlet. Nor did you nothing hear?\n\nQueen. No, nothing but ourselves.\n\nLike Eliot's distracted lady, Gertrude says, \"What shall I do?\" when Hamlet tells her to repent. He gives her crazy-seeming advice to refrain from and to continue in lechery:\n\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\n\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed,\n\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse (182-84)\n\nThis game of king, queen, and knight is consistent with the chess match alluded to previously.

The last line in Part II quotes from Ophelia's first mad scene, where she appears, distracted by the news of Hamlet's murder of her father, Polonius, and also apparently by the prince's decision to repudiate his previously expressed love for her. Just before this poignant farewell (IV.5.72-73), Ophelia sang a St. Valentine's day's poem about a young man who seduced a virgin (on a promise of marriage) and then refused to wed her because she yielded to him -- a song that may apply to Ophelia herself. Later she will be drowned, perhaps accidentally, as she wanders, distracted, seemingly insane. Back to Line\n\n173] The title to this Part is the name of a sermon by the Buddha to a great congregation of priests who followed him from Uruvela in the direction of Gaya Head, where he gave the homily (Henry Clarke Warren, Buddhism in Translations [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1922]: 351-53).\n\nAll things, O priests, are on fire. And what, O priests, are all these things which are on fire?\n\nThe eye, O priests, is on fire; forms are on fire; eye-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the eye are on fire; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the eye, that also is on fire.\n\nAnd with what are these on fire?\n\nWith the fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire.\n\nThe ear is on fire; sounds are on fire; ... the nose is on fire; odors are on fire; ... the tongue is on fire; tastes are on fire; ... the body is on fire; things tangible are on fire; ... the mind is on fire; ideas are on fire; ... mind-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the mind are on fire; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the mind, that also is on fire.\n\nAnd with what are these on fire?\n\nWith the fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire.\n\nPerceiving this, O priests, the learned and noble disciple conceives an aversion for the eye, conceives an aversion for forms, conceives an aversion for eye-consciousness, conceives an aversion for the impressions received by the eye; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the eye, for that also he conceives an aversion. Conceives an aversion for the ear, conceives an aversion for sounds, ... conceives an aversion for the nose, conceives an aversion for odors, ... conceives an aversion for the tongue, conceives an aversion for tastes, ... conceives an aversion for the body, conceives an aversion for things tangible, ... conceives an aversion for the mind, conceives an aversion for ideas, conceives an aversion for mind-consciousness, conceives an aversion for the impressions received by the mind; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the mind, for this also he conceives an aversion. And in conceiving this aversion, he becomes divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes free, and when he is free he becomes aware that he is free; and he knows that rebirth is exhausted, that he has lived the holy life, that he has done what it behooved him to do, and that he is no more for this world.\n\nThe sermon ends, \"Now while this exposition was being delivered, the minds of the thousand priests became free from attachment and delivered from the depravities.\" Back to Line\n\n176] V. Spenser, Prothalamion. [Eliot's note]\n\nEdmund Spenser's hymn, of which Eliot quotes the refrain, celebrates two court weddings, the progress to which took the form of a stately barge trip up the Thames from the royal court at Greenwich to London. On the way, the barge is greeted by a \"flock of nymphs\" on the shores, \"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby, / With goodly greenish locks all loose untied, / As each had been a bride\" (21-23). To ensure the marriages' fertility and happiness, these nymphs strewed flowers over the waters and several sang a bridal hymn to the lovers.

What Tiresias sees, in fact,\n\nis the substance of the poem. The whole\n\npassage from Ovid is of great anthropological\n\ninterest:\n\n... Cum Iunone iocos et `maior vestra\n\nprofecto est Quam, quae contingit maribus', dixisse,\n\n`voluptas.'

She held the opposite view. And so they decided to ask the judgment of wise Tiresias. He knew both sides of love. For once, with a blow of his staff he had outraged two huge serpents mating in the green forest; and, wonderful to relate, from man he was changed into a woman, and in that form spent seven years. In the eighth year he saw the same serpents again and said: `Since in striking you there is such magic power as to change the nature of the giver of the blow, now will I strike you once again.' So saying, he struck the serpents and his former state was restored and he became as he had been born. He therefore, being asked to arbitrate the playful dispute of the gods, took sides with Jove. Saturnia [Juno], they say, grieved more deeply than she should and than the issue warranted, and condemned the arbitrator to perpetual blindness. But the Almighty Father (for no god may undo what another god has done) in return for the loss of sight gave Tiresias the power to know the future, lightening the penalty by the honour.\n\nSome years after the marriage of the King of Thebes, Oedipus, who was married to Jocasta, the wife of the former king, Laios, a terrible plague befell Thebes. Oedipus is told by the Delphic oracle that the wasted city is polluted by the presence of the former king's murderer in it. The blind prophet Tiresias tells Oedipus that he, in pronouncing a terrible curse on the slayer, lies under his own curse, that the murderer is a Theban, and that he is the brother of his own children. Witness to incest here, Tiresias later on, after Oedipus has been exposed, has blinded himself, and has left Thebes, is also witness to the further disasters that the family of Laios has brought upon itself. Oedipus's two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, agree to share the kingdom between them, and reign alternately year by year. Eteocles, who starts, refuses to surrender the throne after his allotted time, and Polynices gains the support of the King of Argos to war against his brother. Eteocles consults Tiresias about the ultimate issue, and the seer declares that victory will fall to Thebes if Menoeceus, the son of Creon (statesman-counsellor to Oedipus and the state), will sacrifice himself. The boy does so, but (though Thebes is victor) the two brothers kill one another, and Antigone (their sister) commits suicide in the end. Tiresias has watched both the murder and incest that made Thebes a plague-ridden waste land, and the self-slaughter and civil war that is a precondition of its purification.\n\nCompare Swinburne's poem \"Tiresias\": \"I, Tiresias the prophet, seeing in Thebes / Much evil.\" Back to Line\n\n221] This may not appear as exact as\n\nSappho's lines, but I had in mind the \"long-\n\nshore\" or \"dory\" fisherman, who returns at nightfall.

Götterdäm-\n\nmerung, III, i: the Rhinedaughters. [Eliot's note]\n\nInfluenced by the following passage from Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness (1902; my italics):\n\nThe sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished spirit. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.\n\nIn Wagner's opera Das Rheingold the three Rhine-daughters, nymphs entrusted to guard the gold in the river, sing happily and use the cry, \"Weialala leia wallala leialala\" to express their joy. The ugly gnome Alberich interrupts their play at the start of the opera and wants them to satisfy his lust. Chasing after them, he is made to flounder in the waters as they laugh at him and mock him with these cries. The nymphs jeeringly betray to Alberich that only he who overcomes the lusts of the flesh can hope to possess the Rhine-gold he sees at the river's bottom as he chases them. Alberich then tears the gold from the river so that the nymphs' laughter changes to mourning. In the last of Wagner's operas about the Ring of the Nibelung, Götterdæmmerung, the three Rhine-daughters re-appear to sing of the Rhine gold they have lost, but even here they are not lamenting, but instead happily singing a hymn of praise to the gold and looking forward to a hero who will restore it to them -- Siegfried, who enters with the ring. Their talk is banter, but when he refuses at last to return the gold they prophesy his death. In the end Siegfried is murdered and his beloved Brunnhilde mounts the funeral pile beside his body and they perish together in the flames. The Rhine then rises and its nymphs regain their ring from the ashes -- at which point the Dusk of the Gods (the opera's title) has come, and Valhalla is seen burning with all its heroes and gods. Back to Line\n\n275] Down the Thames towards the sea from London Bridge is a great loop in the river that creates a peninsula known as the Isle of Dogs, which is turned into an island by the cuts of a series of docks across it. Hardwood especially is unloaded here. Just across the river stands what used to be the Royal Docks from the period of Henry VIII. Many ships used against the Spanish Armada were built there, and on the Golden Hind Queen Elizabeth knighted Sir Francis Drake. At the top of the bend, just before the river loops back, stands Greenwich Palace and the hill behind it. Many of these structures were designed by Sir Christopher Wren and contrast sharply with the dismal docks that surround them. On the other side of the peninsular Isle of Dogs, the Thames is called Greenwich Reach, the part of the river between the two seaward bends of the loop. Back to Line\n\n279] V. Froude, Elizabeth, Vol. I, ch. iv, letter of De Quadra to Philip of Spain:\n\n\"In the afternoon we were in a barge, watch-\n\ning the games on the river.

Dent, n.d.): 244.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, according to rumour, took Lord Robert Dudley (earl of Leicester) as her lover and wanted to marry him, but public scandal developed when Dudley's young wife was found at the bottom of a staircase with her neck broken, and when Dudley was suspected of having murdered her so that he could wed the Queen. The Spanish ambassador at this time (1561), the Roman Catholic bishop De Quadra, encouraged the Queen in her infatuation and promised her that Philip II, king of Spain, would support her sovereignty against all comers, English or foreign, if she married a Catholic. Eliot refers to a party given by Leicester on a barge in the Thames described by De Quadra in a letter to Philip on June 30. Elizabeth never married Dudley, or anyone else, and (unlike the Thames-daughters, who became victims of their lovers) chose power over desires of the flesh. She also died childless. Back to Line\n\n289] The white towers are perhaps the donjon of the Tower of London (the original royal palace in London, and also a prison) and the great spire of St. Paul's Cathedral, which burned down June 4, 1561.

St. Augustine's Confessions:\n\n\"to Carthage then I came, where a cauldron of\n\nunholy loves sang all about mine ears.\" [Eliot's note]\n\nSt. Augustine, in his autobiography, writes of his falling-away as a student from God into \"a land of want\" (III.10), specifically in Carthage. The passage that Eliot quotes continues as follows: \"I was not yet in love, but I was in love with love ... I defiled the very source of friendship by the filth of concupiscence, and its clear waters I befouled with the lust of hell .... But in my joy I was bound about with painful chains of iron, so that I might be scourged by nurning rods of jealousy, and suspicion, and fear, and anger, and quarreling.\" Later Augustine (X.34) writes about the temptation of the eyes, and, like the Buddha, wishes release from them for sight instead of the spiritual light of God: \"I resist these seductions of the eyes, lest my feet, wherewith I walk upon your path, be ensnared, and I raise up my unseen eyes to you so that you may `pluck my feet out of the snare' [Psalms 25.15]. Again and again do you pluck them out, for they become ensnared. You never cease to pluck them out, for I often get caught in the snares scattered on every side ...\" He ends this chapter: \"yet I too entangle my steps in such outward beauties. But you pluck me out, Lord, you pluck me out .... For I am caught most wretchedly, and you mercifully pluck me out. Sometimes I feel nothing, because I had not fallen deep into those snares; sometimes it is with pain, because I was already caught firmly therein.\" Carthage, of course, is the doomed city of Dido. Even as Augustine died, it was overrun by barbarians.

In Alexandria, an Egyptian city on the Nile delta, according to Jessie Weston, this God's spring feast \"began with the solemn and joyous celebration of the nuptials of Adonis and Aphrodite, at the conclusion of which a Head, of papyrus, representing the god, was, with every show of mourning, committed to the waves, and borne within seven days by a current (always to be counted upon at that season of the year) to Byblos [in Lebanon, the Phoenician sacred city from which the term `Bible' comes], where it was received and welcomed with popular rejoicing. The duration of the feast varied from two days, as at Alexandria, to seven or eight.\"\n\nA fortnight is two weeks.

Charybdis is a mythical monster, daughter of Mother Earth and Poseidon (the sea-god), a voracious woman who had been hurled by Zeus's thunderbolt into the sea and thrice daily sucked in a huge volume of water and presently spewed it out again -- minus passing sailors that had been swallowed.

In one of the Upanishads (Hindu treatises concerning metaphysics), the Svetasvatara, the image is invoked to explain all that is: \"In this vast brahma-wheel, which enlivens all things, in which all rest, the soul flutters about thinking that the self in him and the Mover (the Lord) are different. Then, when blessed by him, he gains life eternal\" (The Principal Upanisads, ed. and trans. S. Radhakrishnan [London: George Allen & Unwin, 1953]: 713; BL 1120 A3R32).

Barabbas was released from prison in exchange for Jesus (Luke 23:19).

[Eliot's note]\n\nEliot's note refers to Sir Ernest Shackleton's South: The Story of Shackleton's 1914-1917 Last Expedition (1970; London, 1919; G 850 1914 .S5 Robarts Library), which describes the first attempted crossing of the Antarctic continent from sea to sea via the Pole. Shackleton says concerning their journey across South Georgia (from Haakon Bay to Stromness Bay): \"When I look back at those days I do not doubt that Providence guided us, not only across those snowfields, but also across the stormy-white sea which separated Elephant Island from our landing place on South Georgia. I know that during that long march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia it often seemed to me that we were four, not three. And Worsley and Crean had the same idea. One feels `the dearth of human words, the roughness of mortal speech,' in trying to describe intangible things, but a record of our journeys would be incomplete without reference to a subject very near to our hearts\" (125).\n\nSee Luke 24:13-16. \"And, behold, two of them [Simon and Cleopas, disciples of Christ] went that same day [the third day after Christ's execution] to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\" Christ (still unknown to them) rebuked the two for their doubts about the prophecied resurrection, and expounded the scriptural prophecies concerning himself to them. When Christ broke bread with them that night, their eyes were opened and they recognized him -- whereupon he vanished. Emmaus is present-day El Qubeibeh, a small Muslim village about 18 kilometers out of Jerusalem on the road to Nablus. The disciples are identified as Cleopas and Simon at 24:18 and 24:34. Back to Line\n\n365] a man or a woman: possibly an allusion to an exemplum from the Buddhist Visuddhi-Magga (\"Way of Purity or Salvation\"), partly translated in the Buddhist text Eliot referred to before:\n\nThe story is that a certain woman had married into a family of rank, but had quarreled with her husband, and, decked and ornamented, until she looked like a goddess, had issued forth from Anuradhapura, early in the morning, and was returning home to her family. On her way she met the elder, as he was on his way from Mt. Cetiya to go on his begging-rounds in Anuradhapura. And no sooner had she seen him, than the perversity of her nature caused her to laugh loudly. The elder looked up inquiringly, and observing her teeth, realized the impurity of the body, and attained to sainthood ....\n\nThen came her husband, following in her footsteps, and seeing the elder, he said:\n\n\"Reverend sir, have you seen a woman pass this way?\"\n\nAnd the elder said:\n\n\"Was it a woman, or a man,\n\nThat passed this way? I cannot tell.\n\nBut this I know, a set of bones\n\nIs travelling on upon this road.\"\n\n(Henry Clarke Warren, Buddhism in Translations [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1922]: 297-98). Back to Line\n\n367] Cf. Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:\n\n\"Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest\n\nder halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum\n\nChaos, fährt betrunken im heiligen Wahn am\n\nAbgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt be-\n\ntrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Kara-\n\nmasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört\n\nsie mit Tränen.\"\n\n[Eliot's note]\n\nEliot quotes a passage from A Glimpse into Chaos by Hermann Hesse (1872-1962) that refers to the Russian Revolution and other upheavals: \"Already half of Europe, already at least half of Eastern Europe, on the way to Chaos, drives drunkenly in spiritual frenzy along the edge of the abyss, sings drunkenly, as though singing hymns, as Dmitri Karamazov [in Feodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov] sang. The offended bourgeois laughs at the songs; the saint and the seers hear them with tears.\" Back to Line\n\n374] Falling towers: the Tower of the Tarot pack is a crumbling pile, struck by a thunderbolt, with a man and a woman hurtling from its summit. Back to Line\n\n380] According to Eliot (Poems, 1910-1930, p. 155), these details were inspired by a painting from the school of Hieronymus Bosch (a fifteenth-century Dutch artist), one called \"Hell\" or \"The Sinful World\" and forming a diptych with Bosch's \"Deluge.\" In a part of the painting one can see a bat-like creature with dull human features crawling headfirst down a rock wall. See Charles de Tolnay, Hieronymus Bosch (Basel: Holbein, 1937), plate 25. Bosch's horrific late Gothic style shows, with extraordinary vividness, allegories of Hell, the fallen world of vice, and wasting self-slaughter. Back to Line\n\n385] In the language of the Old Testament, the empty wells and cisterns signify the drying up of faith in the one God and the worship of false gods in their place. Compare the words of the prophet Jeremiah, \"For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and carved themselves out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water\" (Jeremiah 2:13), and those of Solomon to his people, \"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well\" (Proverbs 5:15). Back to Line\n\n388] the chapel: the Chapel Perilous in the Grail legend, a mysterious and deadly place where the hero knight meets with a strange and terrifying adventure. The details vary. Sometimes there is a dead body laid on the altar; sometimes a black hand extinguishes the tapers. There are threatening voices, and throughout evil and supernatural forces are engaged. In the Percival story the Chapel was built by Queen Brangemore of Cornwall, who was later murdered by her own son Espinogres and buried beneath the altar. Many knights are slain there mysteriously, perhaps by the black hand that appears and puts out the light. The enchantment can only be ended if a valiant knight fights the black hand and, taking a veil kept in the Chapel, dips it in water that has been sanctified, and sprinkles the walls. After being warned, Percival encounters the Chapel he recognizes as being that of the black hand. The hand appears, and Percival fights and wounds it. Then a head appears, and finally the devil in full form, who seizes the knight as he is about to seek the veil. Percival makes the sign of the Cross, the devil vanishes, and the knight falls unconscious before the altar. One reviving, he takes the veil, dips it in holy water, and sprinkles the walls inside and outside. He sleeps there that night. The next morning he sees a belfry. He rings the bell, whereupon an old man, followed by two others, appears. He tells Percival that he is a priest and has buried 3,000 knights slain by the black hand. Every day a fresh marble tomb is added to the graveyard. Especially notable in the Percival story (taken almost verbatim from Jessie Weston's From Ritual to Romance, pp. 175-77) are the bells, the walls, and the graves, all of which are adapted by Eliot in this passage. Back to Line\n\n393] The cock's cry can be interpreted in several ways. (1) In Shakespeare's Hamlet Horatio says that the cry signals the departure of evil spirits:\n\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\n\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\n\nAwake the god of day; and, at his warning,\n\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\n\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\n\nTo his confine. (I.2.150-55)\n\nPreviously the cock has indeed cried out as the Ghost of Hamlet's murdered father is about to speak, and its spirit (who is condemned to suffer in purgatory for a time) hastens away. (2) Also in Hamlet, Marcellus adds that the cock crowed especially at seasons connected with events in Christ's life:\n\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\n\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\n\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long:\n\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;\n\nThe nights are wholesome ... (I.2.158-62)\n\nEaster as well as Christmas brings the cock into the story of Christ, for he predicted that before the cock crowed Peter would betray him three times on the night he was taken away by the Jewish priests to Pilate for trial. \"And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he [Peter] went out, and wept bitterly\" (Matthew 26:73-75). (3) In Shakespeare's The Tempest Ariel leads Ferdinand on by his singing and music (which the prince hears beside the waters), and just before the lyric stanza that includes the line, \"Those are pearls that were his eyes,\" Ariel sings out:\n\nHark, hark! I hear\n\nThe strain of strutting chanticleer\n\nCry, Cock-a-diddle-dow. (I.2.385-87)\n\nBack to Line\n\n394] Compare Joseph Conrad's An Outcast of the Islands, IV.5:\n\nThen the heavy air round him was pierced by a sharp gust of wind, bringing with it the fresh, damp feel of the falling rain; and all the innumerable treetops of the forests swayed to the left and sprang back again in a tumultuous balancing of nodding branches and shuddering leaves. A light frown ran over the river, the clouds stirred slowly, changing their aspect but not their place, as if they had turned ponderously over; and when the sudden movement had died out in a quickened tremor of the slenderest twigs, there was a short period of formidable immobility above and below, during which the voice of the thunder was heard, speaking in a sustained, emphatic and vibrating roll, with violent bursts of crashing sound, like a wrathful and threatening discourse of an angry god.\n\nBack to Line\n\n396] Ganga: the sacred Indian river Ganges. The Hindu faith is that bathing in it brings renewal to a person. Back to Line\n\n398] Himavant: \"Snowy Mountain\" -- one or more sacred mountains in the Himalayas. Back to Line\n\n400] the thunder: the voice of God (Christian or otherwise). Compare Job 26: 6-11, 14: \"Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. He holdeth back the face of the throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof .... Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?\" Compare also Psalms 77:16-20 (also 104:7): \"The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightenings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron [out of Egypt, the desert, the waste land].\" Back to Line\n\n402] \"Datta, dayadhvam, damyata\" (Give,\n\nsympathise, control). The fable of the mean-\n\ning of the Thunder is found in the Brihada-\n\nranyaka -- Upanishad, 5, 1. A translation is\n\nfound in Deussen's Sechzig Upanishads des\n\nVeda, p. 489. [Eliot's note]\n\nEliot refers to the Indian legend of the Thunder in the sacred book, Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad, in which the Lord of Creation, Prajapati, thunders three times, the sound being represented by the Sanskrit word \"DA\". The complete myth is as follows (The Principal Upanisads, ed. and trans. S. Radhakrishnan [London: George Allen & Unwin, 1953]: 289-91; BL 1120 A3R32):\n\nThe threefold offspring of Praja-pati, gods, men and demons, lived with their father Praja-pati as students of sacred knowledge. Having completed their studentship the gods said, \"Please tell (instruct) us, sir.\" To them, then, he uttered the syllable da (and asked) \"Have you understood?\" They (said), \"We have understood, you said to us `damyata,' `control yourselves.'\" He said, \"Yes, you have understood.\"\n\nThen the men said to him, \"Please tell (instruct) us, sir.\" To them he uttered the same syllable da (and asked) \"Have you understood?\" They said, \"We have understood. You said to us `give.'\" He said, \"Yes, you have understood.\"\n\nThen the demons said to him, \"Please tell (instruct) us, sir.\" To them he uttered the same syllable da and asked, \"Have you understood?\" They said, \"We have understood, you said to us, `dayadhvam,' `be compassionate.'\" He said, \"Yes, you have understood.\" This very thing the heavenly voice of thunder repeats da, da, da, that is, control yourselves, give, be compassionate. One should practise this same triad, self-control, giving and compassion.\n\nThe gods, being unruly, are asked to exercise self-control; men, being avaricious, are asked to give in the way of charity; the demons, being cruel, are asked to take pity.

Although Dante does not mention this fact, Eliot would have found it in a footnote to his edition of Dante. Ugolino is frozen in the same hole as is Archbishop Ruggieri, the man who betrayed him, and is condemned to gnaw and chew on the part of his enemy's head where the brain meets the nape of the neck. The two share the same hole because both (like Coriolanus) are traitors.\n\nEliot's doctoral thesis at Harvard University, which he began October 1911 and finished April 1916, was entitled \"Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley.\" Eliot never defended the thesis, and so he never received the Ph.D., but the book was published all the same in 1964. Back to Line\n\n417] a broken Coriolanus: the protagonist of Shakespeare's tragedy of same name, a great Roman general and aristocratic despiser of the fickle mob, turns double traitor. First, his pride and desire to punish an ungrateful Roman populace make him go into exile, join the Volscian forces against Rome, and defeat his mother country in battle. Second, by the intervention of his Roman mother, wife, and son, Coriolanus is persuaded to spare Rome from sacking; and the Volscians hack him to death to punish his treachery to them. Back to Line\n\n424] V. Weston: From Ritual to Romance;\n\nchapter on the Fisher King. [Eliot's note]\n\nJessie Weston, in her chapter on the Fisher King, discusses the Fish as a universal life symbol, one of some antiquity. The Fisher, as a royal title, is thus associated with life-creating-and-preserving deities. In very early Christianity, the word \"icthys\" (the Greek word for \"fish\") is an acronym for \"Jesus Christ, King of the Jews\" (note courtesy of Jonathan Harvey); Christ's apostles are given the name, \"fishers of men\"; and the Fisherman has a papal ring. The M{_a}h{_a}yana scriptures give another example of the use of this symbol: Buddha is named the Fisherman who draws fish from the ocean of Samsara to the light of salvation (pp. 124-26). Back to Line\n\n426] Compare the words of the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah, a sick man whose kingdom lies waste under Assyrian conquest: \"Thus saieth the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live\" (Isaiah 38:1). Hezekiah prays for nercy and God answers him, promising to deliver his country from the Assyrians and granting him a further fifteen years of life.\n\nNote also the epigraph to Dante's Purgatorio, a prayer of the poet Jacopone da Todi (1230-1306): \"Ordina quest' amore, O tu che m' ami'\" -- \"set my love in order, O thou who lovest me.\" Back to Line\n\n427] The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes gives the following version:\n\nLondon Bridge is broken down,\n\nBroken down, broken down,\n\nLondon Bridge is broken down,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nBuild it up with wood and clay,\n\nWood and clay, wood and clay,\n\nBuild it up with wood and clay,\n\nMy fair lady.\n\nWood and clay will wash away,\n\nWash away, wash away,\n\nWood and clay will wash away, My fair lady.\n\nThe remaining refrain lines are as follows:\n\nBuild it up with bricks and mortar.\n\nBricks and mortar will not stay.\n\nBuild it up with iron and steel.\n\nIron and steel will bend and bow.\n\nBuild it up with silver and gold.\n\nSilver and gold will be stolen away.\n\nSet a man to watch all night.\n\nSuppose the man should fall asleep.\n\nGive him a pipe to smoke all night.\n\nBack to Line\n\n428] V.

The Vigil of Venus, ed. Cecil Clementi, 3rd edn. (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1936): lines 90-91, p. 200 (PA 6557 P3 1936 Robarts Library).\n\nThe poem celebrates Venus' life-force surging in nature and contrasts the poet's own dispirited silence with the singing of the birds, even that of \"terei puella\" (`the girl of Tereus'), who was raped by the barbarous king (\"de marito barbaro\"), whom Eliot mentions in Part II when he relates the story of Procne and Philomela.\n\nO swallow swallow: much like a cry that runs through Swinburne's poem, \"Itylus,\" a lament sung by the nightingale Philomela to her sister the swallow Procne. Philomela reproaches her sister for rejoicing with the spring and for forgetting the tragic rape and murders that led to their metamorphosis. The opening lines of Swinburne's poem are as follows:\n\nSwallow, my sister, O sister swallow,\n\nHow can thine heart be full of the spring?\n\nA thousand summers are over and dead.\n\nWhat hast thou found in the spring to follow?\n\nWhat hast thou found in thine heart to sing?\n\nThe image and voice of the slain boy haunt Philomela, a constant reminder of the past reaching into the present. Swinburne's last stanza is:\n\nO sister, sister, thy first-begotten!\n\nThe hands that cling and the feet that follow,\n\nThe voice of the child's blood crying yet\n\nWho hath remembered me? who hath forgotten?\n\nThou hast forgotten, O summer swallow,\n\nBut the world shall end when I forget.\n\nEliot may also have in mind Alfred lord Tennyson's lyric poem, \"O Swallow, Swallow\":\n\nO Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,\n\nFly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,\n\nAnd tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.\n\nO tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,\n\nThat bright and fierce and fickle is the South,\n\nAnd dark and true and tender is the North.\n\nO Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light\n\nUpon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,\n\nAnd cheep and twitter twenty million loves.\n\nO were I thou that she might take me in,\n\nAnd lay me on her bosom, and her heart\n\nWould rock the snowy cradle till I died.\n\nWhy lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\n\nDelaying as the tender ash delays\n\nTo clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\n\nO tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:\n\nSay to her, I do but wanton in the South,\n\nBut in the North long since my nest is made.\n\nO tell her, brief is life but love is long,\n\nAnd brief the sun of summer in the North,\n\nAnd brief the moon of beauty in the South.\n\nO Swallow, flying from the golden woods,\n\nFly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,\n\nAnd tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.\n\nBack to Line\n\n430] V.

[Eliot's note]\n\n\"Why then Ile [I'll] fit [supply] you [with what you need]\" is spoken by Hieronimo in Thomas Kyd's Elizabethan revenge tragedy, The Spanish Tragedy, one of the forerunners of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Hieronimo's son Horatio is murdered by the brother and would-be lover of the woman with whom he was carrying on an illicit love affair. Like Hamlet, Hieronimo suffers in his grief from moments of seeming insanity as he tries to find out the identity of these murderers. When he at last determines who they are, and when the guilty ask him to prepare a court entertainment in which all of them will act, Hieronimo sees an opportunity to enact his revenge:\n\nWhy then I'll fit you, say no more.\n\nWhen I was young, I gave my mind\n\nAnd plied myself to fruitless poetry:\n\nWhich though it profit the professor naught,\n\nYet is it passing pleasing to the world. (IV.1.70-74)\n\nBy echoing this passage, Eliot (as before in the allusion to Pervigilium) contrasts the world's content and his own unhappiness.\n\nHieronimo's play-within-a-play is also a tragedy. It concerns a prince who kills a husband to get his wife but who is foiled when she murders him in turn and suicides. Hieronimo ensures that the players will all die in their parts. Like Eliot, Hieronimo writes his tragic ending in many languages and instructs his players as follows:\n\nEach one of us must act his part\n\nIn unknown languages,\n\nThat it may breed the more variety,\n\nAs you, my lord, in Latin, I in Greek,\n\nYou in Italian, and for because I know\n\nThat Bel-imperia [Horatio's beloved] hath practised the French,\n\nIn courtly French shall all her phrases be. (172-78)\n\nWhen one of the characters objects that the play will then be \"a mere confusion\" (180), Hieronimo replies that \"the conclusion / Shall prove the invention and allwas good\" (182-83). Eliot may have intended to apply this passage in anticipating critical response to his own work.\n\nHieronymo's mad againe: the subtitle of the 1615 quarto of The Spanish Tragedy is \"Hieronymo is Mad Againe.\" Back to Line"
