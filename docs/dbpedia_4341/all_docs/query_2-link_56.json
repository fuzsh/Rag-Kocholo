        "text": "Abstract [eng] There is a vast body of literature and knowledge on and about articulating tradition and heritage as a resource to construct identity. It is so to the point that both concepts become reliable tools that would speak as symbolic and tangible arguments in the identity build-up. This thesis brings the case of ‘Hispano’ Newmexicans, the Spanish lineage-related community in the southwestern American state of New Mexico. The case’s singularity comes from the circumstances in which that community’s identity articulation gets produced. Newmexican ‘Hispano’ proclivity to engage in tradition and heritage discourse delves into the fascination for the past. Memories and customs become recurrent, coherent, and cohesive cultural artifacts, immovable devices to endorse social presence, voice cultural relevance, and vent past grievances. Such an emphasis somehow brings not just an act of agency into the open, showing value and the community’s character. Stressing the accent on heritage and tradition often conceals inter-ethnic social tensions and blurs too many cultural similarities. That specific condition, the one of a society functioning on a multi-ethnic pattern, provides the necessary tools for debate. New Mexico had been conceptualized as a tri-ethnic-cultural state, around Native Americans -Pueblo, Navajo, Apache-, ‘Hispanos,’ and Anglos, regardless of much social and academic grumble. This has posed an elusive concern. That reductionist approach subsumed diverse ethnic groups into a solid three-grouping entity and fabrication. Moreover, it blocked each group’s tradition and heritage-specific production for a more standard and carefully customized version by local cultural institutions. The School for Advanced Research - SAR- and the Spanish Colonial Art Society -SCAS- were the gate openers in the building up, implementing, delivering, and promoting the commodified optics of the state’s cultures for outer exposure. Those conditions only messed with the internal social perception of the ‘other’ while exposing New Mexico’s complex society’s structure and history to foreigners' consumption. The two case studies - the Santa Fe Fiesta and the Museum of Spanish Colonial Art- brought here for analysis look to shed light on the current conditions of societal power relations. Both are meant to fully display and dissect the usage and channeling of identity and heritage discourses. That is meant by a functional artifact that aligns in time the inception of New Mexico as the political unit that led to its current existence, and the historical process that informs the massive growth in the production of social and behavioural knowledge. We have considered particularly relevant some specific lines to develop this task: • The social structure and hierarchy in New Mexico after the independence of Mexico and the After the 1848 Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty -1848-, at the end of the war with the United States. • The account of social bonds or cultural ties - linguistic, religious, territorial, historical, traditional- Spanish-lineage Newmexicans perceived as theirs. • The effects of the political program behind the U.S. Manifest Destiny ideology. • Tracking the systematization and production of knowledge of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Ethnography, and Anthropology included, as shapers of discourse and social narratives. The proposition weighs the relevance of both case studies that set off from the same historical moment, regardless of their subsequent functional trajectory. A trajectory that eventually would mesh them both in the public scene. Both also occupy a proper place as self-representational 'loci' for New Mexican narratives, whether institutional or 'Hispanic', that we portray as confronting discourses. The display of identity manifestations has the purpose to provide clues to the connect/disconnect relationship of the ‘Hispano’ community to and with the neighbor communities, as well as the terms of entitlement that ensue through identity production."
