        "text": "The carbon sink capacity of tropical forests is substantially affected by tree mortality. However, the main drivers of tropical tree death remain largely unknown. Here we present a pan-Amazonian assessment of how and why trees die, analysing over 120,000 trees representing > 3800 species from 189 long-term RAINFOR forest plots. While tree mortality rates vary greatly Amazon-wide, on average trees are as likely to die standing as they are broken or uprooted—modes of death with different ecological consequences. Species-level growth rate is the single most important predictor of tree death in Amazonia, with faster-growing species being at higher risk. Within species, however, the slowest-growing trees are at greatest risk while the effect of tree size varies across the basin. In the driest Amazonian region species-level bioclimatic distributional patterns also predict the risk of death, suggesting that these forests are experiencing climatic conditions beyond their adaptative limits. These results provide not only a holistic pan-Amazonian picture of tree death but large-scale evidence for the overarching importance of the growth–survival trade-off in driving tropical tree mortality.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Tree mode of death and mortality risk factors across Amazon forests\n\nAU - Esquivel-Muelbert, Adriane\n\nAU - Phillips, Oliver L.\n\nAU - Brienen, Roel J.W.\n\nAU - Fauset, Sophie\n\nAU - Sullivan, Martin J.P.\n\nAU - Baker, Timothy R.\n\nAU - Chao, Kuo Jung\n\nAU - Feldpausch, Ted R.\n\nAU - Gloor, Emanuel\n\nAU - Higuchi, Niro\n\nAU - Houwing-Duistermaat, Jeanne\n\nAU - Lloyd, Jon\n\nAU - Liu, Haiyan\n\nAU - Malhi, Yadvinder\n\nAU - Marimon, Beatriz\n\nAU - Marimon Junior, Ben Hur\n\nAU - Monteagudo-Mendoza, Abel\n\nAU - Poorter, Lourens\n\nAU - Silveira, Marcos\n\nAU - Torre, Emilio Vilanova\n\nAU - Dávila, Esteban Alvarez\n\nAU - del Aguila Pasquel, Jhon\n\nAU - Almeida, Everton\n\nAU - Loayza, Patricia Alvarez\n\nAU - Andrade, Ana\n\nAU - Aragão, Luiz E.O.C.\n\nAU - Araujo-Murakami, Alejandro\n\nAU - Arets, Eric\n\nAU - Arroyo, Luzmila\n\nAU - Aymard C, Gerardo A.\n\nAU - Baisie, Michel\n\nAU - Baraloto, Christopher\n\nAU - Camargo, Plínio Barbosa\n\nAU - Barroso, Jorcely\n\nAU - Blanc, Lilian\n\nAU - Bonal, Damien\n\nAU - Bongers, Frans\n\nAU - Boot, René\n\nAU - Brown, Foster\n\nAU - Burban, Benoit\n\nAU - Camargo, José Luís\n\nAU - Castro, Wendeson\n\nAU - Moscoso, Victor Chama\n\nAU - Chave, Jerome\n\nAU - Comiskey, James\n\nAU - Valverde, Fernando Cornejo\n\nAU - da Costa, Antonio Lola\n\nAU - Cardozo, Nallaret Davila\n\nAU - Di Fiore, Anthony\n\nAU - Dourdain, Aurélie\n\nAU - Erwin, Terry\n\nAU - Llampazo, Gerardo Flores\n\nAU - Vieira, Ima Célia Guimarães\n\nAU - Herrera, Rafael\n\nAU - Honorio Coronado, Eurídice\n\nAU - Huamantupa-Chuquimaco, Isau\n\nAU - Jimenez-Rojas, Eliana\n\nAU - Killeen, Timothy\n\nAU - Laurance, Susan\n\nAU - Laurance, William\n\nAU - Levesley, Aurora\n\nAU - Lewis, Simon L.\n\nAU - Ladvocat, Karina Liana Lisboa Melgaço\n\nAU - Lopez-Gonzalez, Gabriela\n\nAU - Lovejoy, Thomas\n\nAU - Meir, Patrick\n\nAU - Mendoza, Casimiro\n\nAU - Morandi, Paulo\n\nAU - Neill, David\n\nAU - Nogueira Lima, Adriano José\n\nAU - Vargas, Percy Nuñez\n\nAU - de Oliveira, Edmar Almeida\n\nAU - Camacho, Nadir Pallqui\n\nAU - Pardo, Guido\n\nAU - Peacock, Julie\n\nAU - Peña-Claros, Marielos\n\nAU - Peñuela-Mora, Maria Cristina\n\nAU - Pickavance, Georgia\n\nAU - Pipoly, John\n\nAU - Pitman, Nigel\n\nAU - Prieto, Adriana\n\nAU - Pugh, Thomas A.M.\n\nAU - Quesada, Carlos\n\nAU - Ramirez-Angulo, Hirma\n\nAU - de Almeida Reis, Simone Matias\n\nAU - Rejou-Machain, Maxime\n\nAU - Correa, Zorayda Restrepo\n\nAU - Bayona, Lily Rodriguez\n\nAU - Rudas, Agustín\n\nAU - Salomão, Rafael\n\nAU - Serrano, Julio\n\nAU - Espejo, Javier Silva\n\nAU - Silva, Natalino\n\nAU - Singh, James\n\nAU - Stahl, Clement\n\nAU - Stropp, Juliana\n\nAU - Swamy, Varun\n\nAU - Talbot, Joey\n\nAU - ter Steege, Hans\n\nAU - Terborgh, John\n\nAU - Thomas, Raquel\n\nAU - Toledo, Marisol\n\nAU - Torres-Lezama, Armando\n\nAU - Gamarra, Luis Valenzuela\n\nAU - van der Heijden, Geertje\n\nAU - van der Meer, Peter\n\nAU - van der Hout, Peter\n\nAU - Martinez, Rodolfo Vasquez\n\nAU - Vieira, Simone Aparecida\n\nAU - Cayo, Jeanneth Villalobos\n\nAU - Vos, Vincent\n\nAU - Zagt, Roderick\n\nAU - Zuidema, Pieter\n\nAU - Galbraith, David\n\nPY - 2020/12\n\nY1 - 2020/12\n\nN2 - The carbon sink capacity of tropical forests is substantially affected by tree mortality.
