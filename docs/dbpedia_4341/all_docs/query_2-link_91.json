        "text": "There are yet no records that identify the names of the parents of Cristóbal Torres (b.ca 1665-1668), husband of Ángela Leiba, the progenitors of the Torres family of 18th-century New Mexico. Y-DNA research is being conducted to provide insights into the genetic ancestry of Cristóbal Torres as described in the article by Miguel A. Tórrez titled, \"Cristóbal de Torres Y-DNA,\" that was published in the New Mexico Genealogist, Vol. 55, No. 1, Marvh 2016, and is available as a PDF online.\n\nCristóbal Torres (ONMF: 294 & 396) was buried at Santa Cruz de la Cañada on December 2, 1726. His age was given as seventy-seven, indicating he was born circa 1649. His wife, Ángela Leiba (ONMF: 54, 294, & 396) was buried four months later at Santa Cruz on 1 April 1729. Her burial record identified her as age seventy (born circa 1657) and as the widow of Cristóbal Torres.\n\nThere is yet no documentation that connects Cristóbal Torres with Francisco Gómez de Torres who resided in New Mexico in the 1630s. A man named Juan de Torres came to New Mexico in the expedition of donJuan de Oñate. He was a native of Mexico City and a son of Baltasar de Torres, but Juan de Torres did not remain in New Mexico. There are no accounts of him in New Mexico any records after 1600.\n\nInformation on the Internet that gives the names of Cristóbal Torres and Juana Francisca Benavides is erroneous.\n\nA couple named Cristóbal Torres and Juana Benavides were enumerated in the 1750 census of Belen with two children, Ana María and Alexo (Olmsted, “Spanish and Mexican Censuses of New Mexico, 1750-1830, page 95). By all appearances, this Cristobal Torres was a son of Diego de Torres and a grandson of Cristóbal Torres and Angela Leyva. In fact, the household of Cristóbal Torres and Juana Benavides was listed just after that of Diego Torres and his third wife, Rafaela Baca.\n\nAlso, Juana Benavides belongs to the Benavides family that came to New Mexico in 1693, so she could not have been the mother of Cristóbal de Torres (b.ca. 1665-1668), husband of Angela Leyva.\n\nAlexo/Alejo Torres, son of Cristóbal Torres and Juana Benavides, gave his age as 34 in 1778, indicating he was born circa 1744. He was first married with Leonarda Jaramillo and then sought to marry Josefa Serna (Chávez, “New Mexico Roots, Ltd.,” page 1897). Cristóbal Torres and Juana Benavides were probably married in the 1740s.\n\nSo, the question before us is, “How did the names of Cristobal Torres and Juana Benavides, who lived in the 1700s, get associated with Cristobal de Torres who was born circa 1665-1668?”\n\nWell, there is a prenuptial investigation dated October 10, 1701, Bernalillo for Mateo de Torres, age 23 (b.ca.1678), who declared he was a son of Cristóbal de Torres and Juana Maria Francisca (no surname given); see Chávez, “New Mexico Roots, Ltd.,” page 1894. Mateo’s intended bride was Isabel González, age 19 and a daughter of Hernando Martín and Nicolasa Apolonia (no surname given). There is a chance that the women listed without surnames were Indians, or coyotas, or mulatas.\n\nSomeone entered information into their genealogy database that combined the names and families of two separate couples that lived in two different centuries. That person combined Cristobal de Torres and Juana Maria Francisca (no surname known) with Cristóbal Torres and Juana Benavides. However, these are two separate couples.\n\n___________________\n\nOne important branch of the Torres family of northern New Mexico was founded by Manuel Torres of Las Trampas, born circa 1773, who was identified as the natural son of Pasquala Martín when he sought to marry María de las Nieves Valdés, a native of El Pueblo Quemado (modern-day Córdova) and a daughter of Francisco Valdés y Bustos and Diega Tafoya.\n\nBy all appearances, Manuel's natural mother, Pasquala Martín, is the same individual of this name who had been married to Joaquín Torres. If so, Pasquala apparently had a son out of wedlock whom she reared as a Torres. On 29 May 1794, Manuel Torres submitted his request to marry María de las Nieves Valdés to church authorities as part of the customary pre-nuptial investigation process. He declared he was twenty-one years of age and the natural son of Pasquala Martín, a widow.\n\nIn March 1795, María de las Nieves gave birth to the couple’s first born son who was baptized at the mission church of San Lorenzo de Picurís on 25 March and christened José Antonio de la Encarnación Torres. Almost eighteen months later, the second son of this couple was born at Santa Bárbara and baptized at Picurís on 5 November 1796 and named Manuel de los Santos Torres. This child died less than eight weeks later and was buried at San José en el Río de Las Trampas on 26 December 1796. Immediately following this burial record was that of the child's father, Manuel Torres, deceased at age twenty-three, and who died without having received the sacraments.\n\nGenealogy:\n\nPasquala Martín, her son\n\nManuel Torres, born circa 1773, Las Trampas, died December 1796, buried at Las Trampas (jurisdiction of Picurís); married circa May 1794 with María de las Nieves Valdés, native of Quemado, daughter of Francisco Valdés y Bustos and Diega Tafoya.\n\nKnown children:\n\n3.1 José Antonio de la Encarnación Torres, baptized 25 March 1795, Picurís.
