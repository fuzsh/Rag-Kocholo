Today I am twelve years old and Papa has given me this journal for a gift. He says that I must write in it all that happens.\" A few months later, there were important and exciting events to record. In March of 1730, Carlos and his family set sail on an adventure that would take them halfway around the world and more than a world away from their comfortable life on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. They were among sixteen families from the Islands who were settlers for King Philip IV. Their journey would take them to New Spain to a place called Texas, to help hold the vast empty lands for the crown.\""
