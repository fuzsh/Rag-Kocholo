        "text": "The North Carolina Department of Labor (DOL) last week fined Barnes Farming Corporation $187,509 following the death of José Arturo González Mendoza, a seasonal farm worker, last September.\n\nThe farm in Nash County was responsible for one \"serious intentional violation,\" along with two other \"serious violations,\" according to the summons document and penalty notice from the DOL.\n\nGonzález Mendoza, thirty years old, died on September 5 while harvesting sweet potatoes in Barnes Farming & Farm Pak in Nash County. According to his brother Gustavo, who spoke with Enlace Latino NC last year, his death was due to harsh working conditions exacerbated by extreme heat.\n\nNow, the North Carolina Department of Labor has corroborated the working conditions that led to González Mendoza's fatal outcome.\n\nHow to avoid heat stroke while working in the field\n\n\"Serious intentional rape\"\n\nThe North Carolina DOL declared that Barnes Farming committed a \"serious intentional violation\" by failing to provide a safe workplace, as required by law.\n\nAbout 32 workers in several sweet potato and tobacco fields in Nash and Johnston counties were exposed to temperatures above 91°F risking serious or fatal injuries, according to the department.\n\n\"The employer did not implement adequate control measures to prevent employees from experiencing heat-related illnesses,\" the document reads.\n\nThe DOL gave Barnes Farming the maximum penalty for all violations. A \"serious intentional violation\" has a maximum penalty of $156,259.\n\nThe maximum penalty for a \"serious violation\" is $15,625, according to the department.\n\n\"This was a brave work by many workers who decided to participate in the investigation,\" said Leticia Zavala, leader and organizer of farm workers in The future is ours a Enlace Latino NC.\n\n\"Thanks to the bravery of many workers who participated and said the things that are experienced in the field, these things have been achieved because it is difficult for a department to go out and fine an employer,\" he said.\n\nYou may be interested > The Magnificent Prayer\n\nThe death of González Mendoza could have been avoided\n\nGonzález Mendoza's death could have been prevented if the employer had followed guidelines to recognize the symptoms and prevent illnesses related to extreme heat.\n\nJosé Arturo González Mendoza was harvesting sweet potatoes in direct sunlight when he began showing signs of heat-related illness, including confusion, fatigue and loss of consciousness, according to the North Carolina DOL.\n\nManagers never called for medical help or provided first aid when González Mendoza began feeling symptoms, the citation reads.\n\nAn employee finally called 911 approximately 50 minutes after González Mendoza showed the first signs and symptoms of a medical emergency.\n\nHowever, the worker went into cardiac arrest before help arrived and was pronounced deceased at the scene.\n\nOne option to avoid the danger of heat illness, according to the department, is to develop and implement the safety elements previously agreed upon by Barnes Farming Corporation in the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Inspection Informal Resolution Agreement.\n\nThe agreement executed on May 21, 2020 included training, acclimatization, monitoring of weather conditions, provision of cool areas and drinking water for employees.\n\nThey also had reporting and medical care protocols for employees who present symptoms of heat-related illnesses.\n\nYou may be interested > Companies that sponsor work visas in the US\n\nThe department identified the following violations at several Barnes Farming Corporation fields:\n\nThe employer did not adequately implement a work and rest schedule for high heat conditions. For the six-hour workday, workers were given a maximum of one scheduled break of 5 minutes.\n\nShaded or cool areas were not provided for rest periods away from the heat.\n\nBreaks were taken inside a bus which was hot because it had no air conditioning and was often parked in an open field in direct sunlight.\n\nAn adequate supply of drinking water was not provided to employees. Although a 10-gallon water cooler was provided, there were no glasses, so employees had to drink the water by placing their heads under the faucet.\n\nThe employer did not develop or implement an acclimatization program for H2A migrant farmworkers that would allow them to gradually adapt to high temperatures over several days. The employees worked the full shift on their first day of work.\n\nThe employer did not establish or implement a reporting process, first aid procedures, and emergency response procedures for employees exhibiting signs and symptoms of heat-related illness.\n\nLack of protections for agricultural workers\n\nJosé Arturo González Mendoza was in North Carolina under a H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers.\n\nEl statute What the North Carolina DOL said Barnes Farming violated was failing to provide \"a workplace free of recognized hazards that were causing or were likely to cause death or related serious injury.\"\n\nHowever, currently, there are no laws in effect at the state or federal level requiring breaks or other heat-related safety measures.\n\nThe death of González Mendoza generated calls for North Carolina to pass a heat protection law for farm workers.\n\nThe visa system has raised concerns national level due to what some advocates consider a \"Explotacion\"of the workers and a lax application of the regulations.\n\nEnlace Latino NC and Carolina Public Press investigated these and other deficiencies in the H-2A visa program with around 15,000 agricultural workers to North Carolina.\n\nBarnes Farming Political Ties and Next Steps\n\nJohnny Barnes, the president of Barnes Farming Corporation, is married to state senator, Lisa Barnes, of the Republican Party for the counties of Franklin, Nash y Vance.\n\nBarnes Farming has 15 days, once it receives the violation, to appeal or pay the fine.\n\n\"They can appeal and the fine may be lowered or they may be given the opportunity to correct the system,\" Zavala said.\n\n\"As we know that the president's wife is a senator, perhaps they do it not so much for the money but for the publicity that there is no negative publicity in an election year,\" he explained.\n\nThe appeal would be heard by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission of North Carolina, an independent governing board.\n\n\"There are many fields that are similar so if we want to continue inviting workers to raise their voices,\" Zavala added."
