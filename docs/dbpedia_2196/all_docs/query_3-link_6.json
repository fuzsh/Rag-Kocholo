        "text": "Format:\n\nTitle of Source. Title of Container, Version, Publisher, Date, Location.\n\nExample\n\n\"Describe the Symbolism in Picasso's Guernica\" prompt. ChatGPT, version 3.5, OpenAI, 8 Sep. 2023, chat.openai.com/chat.\n\nFor more information and additional examples, please see the MLA Style Center webpage on citing generative AI in MLA style.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Publication Year.\n\nExample - One Author:\n\nBleicher, Steven. Contemporary Color Theory & Use. Delmar, 2012.\n\nWhen a book has two authors, order the authors in the same way they are presented in the book. The first given name appears in last name, first name format; second authorâs name appears in first name last name format.\n\nExample - Two Authors:\n\nOkuda, Michael, and Denise Okuda. Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future. Pocket, 1993.\n\nIf there are three or more authors, list only the first author followed by the phrase âet al.â in place of the subsequent authors' names.\n\nExample - Three or More Authors:\n\nBurtenshaw, Ken, et al. Fundamentals of Creative Advertising: An Introduction to Branding. AVA Publishing, 2006.\n\nIf there is an editor, cite the book as you normally would, but add the editor after the title with the label, \"Edited by\".\n\nExample - A Book Prepared By an Editor:\n\nBlanc-HoÃ ng, Henri S., et al. Comics as History, Comics as Literature: Roles of the Comic Book in Scholarship, Society, and Entertainment. Edited by Annessa Ann Babic, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2013.\n\nIn MLA 8th Edition, there are three possible ways to cite an eBook.\n\n1) If the eBook you accessed has a URL or DOI, cite the book just like you would if it were in print. Then add the name of the database or website you used to access the online book, and add a URL or other location indicator at the end of the citation.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Publication Year. Database name, URL/DOI.\n\nExample - eBook with URL/DOI:\n\nWright, Steve. Digital Compositing for Film and Video. Focal Press, 2013. Proquest Ebrary, 0-site.ebrary.com.library.academyart.edu/lib/academyart/detail.action?docID=10399317\n\n2) If the eBook lacks a URLâi.e. books read on a personal device or computer requiring specific software (e.g., Kindle, EPUB) â use following format.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. E-reader type, Publisher, Publication Year.\n\nExample - eBook with No URL, Software/eReader Known:\n\nDunn, Barbara. More Than a Song: Exploring the Healing Art of Music Therapy. Kindle ed., University Book Store Press, 2015.\n\n3) If the eBook lacks a URL and the personal device or software is unknown, the format is the same as above, however, use âe-bookâ instead of Kindle, EPUB, etc.\n\nExample - eBook with No URL, Software/eReader Unknown\n\nDunn, Barbara. More Than a Song: Exploring the Healing Art of Music Therapy. e-book, University Book Store Press, 2015.\n\nFor a volume in which illustrations supplement the written text, such as an illustrated edition of a literary work, give the illustratorâs name, preceded by âIllustrated byâ, after the title. If another contributor (e.g., an editor or a translator) is also cited after the title, place the names in the order in which they appear on the title page.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Illustratorâs First and Last Name, Publisher, Publication Year.\n\nExample:\n\nSnyder, Laurel. Swan: The Life and Dance of Anna Pavlova. Illustrated by Julie Morstad, Chronicle Books, 2015.\n\nIf you refer mainly to the illustrator's work instead of the author's in your research, begin the entry in the works-cited list with the illustrator's name, followed by \"illustrator\", and give the author's name, preceded by the word By, after the title.\n\nExample - Mainly Referring to Illustrator's Work:\n\nTenniel, John, illustrator. Alice Through the Looking-Glass. By Lewis Carroll. Academy Editions, 1977.\n\nIn a graphic novel, text and illustrations are intermingled. The entry in the works-cited list for a graphic novel entirely created by one person follows the same format as any other non-periodical print publication.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. Title of Book. Publisher, Publication Year.\n\nExample:\n\nBarry, Lynda. What It Is. Drawn & Quarterly, 2008.\n\nIf the graphic novel is part of a multi-volume work, include the volume number after the work's title, or after the work's editor, illustrator, or translator.\n\nIf the graphic novel is part of a multi-volume work, you may add information about the series following the medium of publication.\n\nExample - Multivolume Work:\n\nFialkov, Joshua H. The Bunker. Illustrated by Joe Infurnari, vol. 2, Oni Press, 2015.\n\nIf the volume you are using has its own title, cite the book without referring to the other volumes as if it were an independent publication.\n\nExample - Multivolume Work, Each Volume with Its Own Title:\n\nMiller, Frank. Just Another Saturday Night. Dark Horse Books, 2005.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor or Editorâs Last name, First Name. âTitle of Article or Page.â Name of Website. Version number, Name of Institution/Organization Affiliated with the Site (if different from the title of the website), date that the page/article/post was written (if available), URL. Date of access (optional).\n\nURLs are now a required component of a citation. Providing the date of access is optional.\n\nExample - Article or Page On a Website with a Known Author:\n\nGross, Doug. âItâs Social Media Day â Again!â CNN.com, 30 June 2011, www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/social.media/06/30/social.media.day/. Accessed 23 Dec. 2016.\n\nExample - Article or Page on a Website with a Corporate Author:\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, U. S.

Grove Art Online, 0-www.oxfordartonline.com.library.academyart.edu/subscriber/article/img/grove/art/F019413. Accessed 10 Jan. 2017.\n\nIf the work is found only online, provide the name of the artist, title of the work, and then citation information for the website that it was found on. If no author is present, use the username that posted the image as the author.\n\nExample - Image Found Only Online:\n\nCloix, Emmanuel. BROUSSAI 2 visu. 2007, Wikimedia Commons, Wikimedia Foundation, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BROUSSAI_2_visu.jpg. Accessed 1 June 2011."
