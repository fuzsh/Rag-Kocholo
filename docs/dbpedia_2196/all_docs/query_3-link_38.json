These should appear only in footnotes.\n\nThe bibliography can be divided into sections (e.g. primary and secondary sources).\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style advises against citations taken from secondary sources (i.e. “quoted in”), but check with your lecturer or tutor if you are in doubt. For more information refer to Chicago Manual of Style (14.260) (login required).\n\nAcceptable abbreviations in the bibliography for parts of books and other publications include:\n\nchap.chaptered.editionet al.and othersrev. ed.revised edition2nd ed.second editioned.
