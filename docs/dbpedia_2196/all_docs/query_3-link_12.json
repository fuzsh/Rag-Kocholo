        "text": "Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is essential for the prevention of stent thrombosis and ischemic thrombotic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the efficacy of antiplatelet treatment is often limited by the increased risk of bleeding, which necessitatespost-procedural transfusion in 1–5% of patients1,2,3,4.\n\nThe major physiological rationale for transfusion is to restore oxygen delivery capacity and alleviate anemia-related myocardial ischemia by supplying red blood cells. However, recent clinical studies have shown a correlation between periprocedural transfusion and an increase in cardiac event and mortality2,5,6.\n\nLifelong antiplatelet treatment poses a lifelong risk of bleeding, which increases as the population ages and patients become more susceptible to bleeding7,8,9. Currently, little is known about the clinical impact of late transfusion for patients long after PCI. We investigated the long-term pattern of transfusion and its impact on the clinical outcome using a real-world nationwide healthcare database.\n\nStudy population\n\nThe National Healthcare Insurance Service is a compulsory unique healthcare insurance system in Republic of Korea and provides anonymized longitudinal data of medical care. We retrospectively retrieved all individual claims for PCI using stent from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, along with all administrative, medical services, and pharmacy claims issued from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016. Medical services claim data included diagnosis codes of the 10th revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and medical procedure codes. Data was retrieved retrospectively on July 1, 2017.\n\nThe Samsung Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this study and determined that informed consent was not required due to the use of anonymized database and the reporting of aggregated results. This study adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0377626610.\n\nDefinitions and study endpoints\n\nAll procedure, transfusion, and clinical events were defined on a daily basis. The index PCI date was the first date of PCI performed in the selection period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. Baseline clinical characteristics and medical history prior to the index PCI were defined by respective ICD-10 codes or claims issued in the look-back period from January 1, 2009 to one day before the index PCI date. Clinical events or procedures after index PCI were defined by ICD-10 codes or claims issued in the follow-up period from the index PCI date to December 31, 2016.\n\nPost-PCI transfusion was defined by the first claim date for a red blood cell transfusion occurring at or after the index PCI. Multiple transfusions were discriminated by different timestamps. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were defined by corresponding ICD-10 codes. Diabetes was defined by corresponding ICD-10 codes accompanied by at least two claims of hemoglobin A1C within 1 year. Other clinical conditions were defined by respective ICD-10 codes. The overall comorbidity of patients was ranked using the Charlson comorbidity index, which classifies comorbidities of patients based on ICD codes11. Critically ill cardiovascular status was defined by any claims indicating cardiogenic shock, such as resuscitation, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, or use of hemodynamic support device including intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Stroke was defined by corresponding ICD-10 codes accompanied by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and hospital admission within 7 days. All-cause death was defined using administrative code. Further details regarding the codes for each clinical conditions are listed in the Supplementary Data.\n\nThe primary outcome was 5-year incidence density of transfusion after the index PCI. Secondary outcomes were 5-year incidence densities of a major adverse clinical event (MACE) consisting of all-cause death, revascularization, critically ill cardiovascular status, and stroke after the index PCI. Additionally, the association between MACE and transfusion was investigated.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe risk of transfusion and clinical events was assessed using incidence density, defined as the number of events per 100 person-years with a 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the Poisson distribution. In addition to the 5-year incidence density, incidence densities were calculated for the 7-day periprocedural period (0 to 6th day after index PCI) and the 1-year period from 1st to 5th year. Cochrane-Armitage trend test was used to examine the time-dependent change in the annual risk of transfusion or clinical events.\n\nThe cohort was split into two cohorts according to the presence or absence of any red blood cell transfusion within 5 years after the index PCI. For survival analyses, the potential confounding factors related to transfusion were assessed. This was done after balancing patient’s propensity for transfusion using the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) model and adjusting frequency and intervals of transfusion using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression model12. The propensity model for transfusion included all available clinical parameters including age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, prior stroke, prior resuscitation, neoplasm, prior transfusion, prior acute myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, initial clinical presentation (angina, non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction), resuscitation, intubation and mechanical ventilation, use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation or extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, stent materials (1st generation or 2nd generation drug-eluting stent, or the other stents), the number of stents implanted, and the Charlson’s comorbidity index. The propensity model showed moderate to good performance (c-statistics = 0.77, 95% CI 0.76–0.77) and was well-balanced in the IPTW model (Supplementary Fig. I). Subgroups based on clinical characteristics were also analyzed and shown in forest plots. No patient was lost to follow-up regarding death. Follow-up of non-fatal clinical event was available in most patients, 99.2% at 4 years and 94.8% at 5 years.\n\nSAS (SAS Institute Inc.) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) software were used for analyses. Hazard ratios (HR) for compared outcomes are reported with a 95% CI. Statistical significance was defined by two-tailed p < 0.05.\n\nBaseline clinical characteristics\n\nA total of 53,087 patients undergoing PCI was identified in the enrollment period. After exclusion of 4301 patients without use of stents, a total of 48,786 patients with 64.5 ± 11.3 years old and 67.8% male were included in the study (Fig. 1). During a mean follow-up of 4.8 ± 1.5 years, 11,194 patients (22.9%) received at least one red blood cell transfusion. Most transfusion occurred over 1 or 2 days (median 1 day, interquartile range 1–2 days).\n\nPatients who received transfusions tended to be older, more often female, and more frequently presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or in critically ill cardiovascular status. They also had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and prior history of myocardial infarction or stroke (p < 0.001, all). Charlson comorbidity index was also higher in the transfusion recipients (1.62 ± 1.91 versus 0.82 ± 1.31, p < 0.001) (Table 1).\n\nPatterns and incidence densities of transfusion and clinical events\n\nOver 5-year follow-up period, the incidence density of transfusion was 4.74 per 100 person-year (95% CI 4.70–4.79). During this time, the annual incidence density ranged from 2.43 to 5.05 per 100 person-year, except for the very high incidence density in the 7-day periprocedural period. The overall incidence density of MACE, death, non-fatal MACE, revascularization, critically ill cardiovascular status, and stroke were 8.17, 3.88, 6.09, 3.59, 0.91, and 2.53 per 100 person-year, respectively. Notably, all the risk of transfusion and clinical events decreased from 1st to 5th year (all p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).\n\nImpact of transfusion on the clinical events\n\nIn unadjusted survival analysis, patients who received transfusions had a threefold higher risk of MACE compared to those who did not (HR 3.0, 95% CI 2.7–3.1, p < 0.001). This higher risk extended to death, revascularization, critically ill cardiovascular status, stroke, and non-fatal MACE (HR 1.7–6.1, all p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A–F). Survival analyses that accounted for clinical factors related to transfusion and multiple transfusions with different time intervals showed consistent results (MACE, HR 3.2, 95% CI 3.2–3.3; all other clinical events, HR 1.5–6.49, all p < 0.001) (Fig. 3G–L). Transfusion was also consistently associated with a higher risk of MACE and all other clinical events across various subgroups categorized by age, gender, clinical risk factors and comorbidities, prior history of cardiovascular events, prior history of transfusion, initial clinical presentation of angina or myocardial infarction, and the number of stents used (all p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. II).\n\nTemporal association between transfusion and clinical events\n\nThe median (interquartile range) interval between clinical events and transfusion were as follows: for MACE, 56 (0–460) days; for death, 224 (41–795) days; for non-fatal MACE, 0 (− 87 to 389) days; for revascularization, 0 (− 249 to 341) days; for critically ill cardiovascular status, 202 (10–817) days; and for stroke, 18 (− 53 to 503) days (Fig. 4). The year of first transfusion coincided with the period of increasing MACE and all clinical events (Fig. 5), as well as with the highest incidence density of MACE and all clinical events (Fig. 6).\n\nThe key message of this study is that transfusions after PCI are quite common and related to worse clinical outcomes. While the risk of periprocedural transfusion has been studied extensively, little is known about the transfusion patterns and effects long after PCI6,13,14,15. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to highlight that transfusion is associated with significant clinical risk even 5 years after PCI. The results, derived from a real-world data of a nationwide PCI cohort and reporting all hard clinical events, add strength in observational setting for safety surveillance.\n\nOur study did not investigate bleeding due to limitations and difficulty of defining it from database. However, transfusion can be seen as akin to clinically significant bleeding, given highly various duration of antiplatelet agents and transfusion thresholds among physicians or hospitals2,3. A meta-analysis comprising 53 studies showed a wide variation in the bleeding risk within 1-year from 0.2 to 39.4%16. Despite this ambiguity, clinical studies consistently have shown strong association among bleeding or transfusion and clinical risk. In the TRACER trial and the Oxford Vascular study, the rate of transfusion was approximately 3.0% per year8,17. In the PARIS trial, the risk of BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) 2 or 3 bleeding for 2 year was 8.1%18. In the DAPT trial, moderate to severe bleeding occurred in 1.9% in 12–30 month follow-up period19. These trials did not include patients with recent bleeding, transfusion, or bleeding tendencies. The apparently high bleeding risk in our study may be explained by inclusion of high bleeding risk patients or the racial difference in the platelet reactivity known as the Eastern Asian Paradox20.\n\nThe clinical propensity model for transfusion was built using only clinical parameters without laboratory tests. Despite this inherent limitation of using administrative claim data, the discriminative performance of the propensity model was relatively good (c-statistics = 0.77, 95% CI 0.76–0.77). This performance is numerically not inferior to the bleeding prediction models in other studies that incorporated laboratory tests, such as the PRECISE-DAPT (c-statistics 0.68), the DAPT (c-statistics 0.71), the CRUSADE (c-statistics 0.71), or the ACUITY (c-statistics 0.71)19,21,22.\n\nTransfusion per se might be a surrogate marker of sicker patients with a higher frequency of co-morbidities or a marker of bleeding events, as well as a cause of excess morbidity or mortality23. In our study, patients who received blood transfusions were older, more likely to have comorbidities or critically ill cardiovascular status, more likely to receive mechanical hemodynamic support, and hence were more likely to have higher morbidity or mortality. Even after accounting for these confounders, blood transfusion remained an independent predictor of mortality and adverse clinical events.\n\nTemporal aggregation of all clinical events to transfusion infers the association between transfusion and clinical events. However, it is challenging to determine whether the clinical events were caused by the transfusion itself, or by underlying reasons for transfusions such as bleeding. Moreover, previous studies showed substantial overlap of clinical predictors between thrombotic and bleeding events19,21,24,25. Severe bleeding followed by transfusion may disrupt antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, leading to subsequent thromboembolic event26,27. Transfusion can also invoke prothrombotic status by release of platelet activating agents and procoagulants, which would be particularly harmful in the periprocedural period28,29. In addition, stored red blood cells may have reduced oxygen transport capacity and bioactivity of vasodilatory nitric oxide through depletion of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid and S-nitrosohemoglobin levels30. Importantly, the results of our study do not mean direct causal relationship among transfusion and clinical event, and cannot be used to support avoidance or restrictive transfusion15,23,31,32.\n\nLimitations\n\nAs the source data is administrative database, we could not access the severity of disease, detailed results of laboratory tests, or lifestyle such as smoking were not available. Despite the use of multivariable and propensity-modelling analyses, the retrospective observational nature of the data limits the mitigation of unmeasured confounding variables. We only analyzed patient-level data, not hospital- and practitioner-level data, which could be different and affect the pattern of transfusion2. Myocardial infarction was not defined because the results of cardiac biomarkers or electrocardiography were not available. Instead, we assessed death, revascularization, and critically ill cardiovascular status, which represent severe complications of myocardial infarction. The use, compliance, duration, and discontinuation of drugs including antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors that may increase or decrease bleeding or transfusion were not investigated8. The pattern and frequency of trauma or non-cardiac surgery which may invoke transfusion were also not investigated."
