This study aimed to explicitly address this issue. A total of 698 Chinese rural adolescents participated in this study (Mage = 13.32 years; 54.60% boys). The results showed that for rural adolescents with lower expected future SSS, perceived parental expectation was negatively related to persistence; for rural adolescents with higher expected future SSS, perceived parental expectation was not significantly correlated with persistence. These findings imply the adverse effects of high perceived parental expectation on rural adolescents’ persistence and that expected future SSS can alleviate this adverse relationship.

The decision-making process can be influenced by various factors present in the social context. According to the behavior-pattern-categorization framework of information acquisition, potential biases may develop at all stages of decision-making as information about social context is progressively entered and integrated. In this study, employing the Chicken Game, we investigated the influence of varying information levels within the behavior-pattern-categorization framework (i.e., competitiveness of behavior choice, uncertainty of behavior pattern, and sociality of category) on decision-making in the dilemma of competition and cooperation. Combined with reinforcement learning models, our findings from three experiments showed that participants exhibited basic complementary behavior, becoming less competitive against highly competitive opponents and vice versa. Notably, individuals exhibited varying adaptation rates to different levels of opponent competitiveness and fluctuations. Specifically, participants adapted slower to highly competitive opponents and faster to cooperative opponents. This asymmetric adaptation in social learning is related to the rate at which various levels of information are updated. The current study disentangles the different levels of information acquisition and highlights the asymmetric processing that can occur during the updating of information within each level.

The results indicated that 34.5% of Chinese undergraduates were in poor or worse mental health. There were significant positive correlations among meaning in life, self-esteem, and interpersonal trust; meaning in life, self-esteem, and interpersonal trust were all significantly and positively correlated with mental health. Self-esteem and interpersonal trust played a chain mediating role between meaning in life and mental health. Schools and families should conduct appropriate activities to help them enhance meaning in life so as to improve the level of mental health.

The aim was to analyze the relationship between PIU and depression in Latin American college students. (2) Methods: The sample consisted of 1828 college students (63.7% women), aged between 18–30 years (M = 21.64 years). (3) Results: PIU was detected in 40.2% of cases, and severe or moderately severe depression in 31.7%. Rates of severe depression in students with PIU were 3.02 times higher than in those without PIU (χ2(3) = 168.443; p < 0.000). The presence of PIU was also statistically significantly higher among youth with depressive symptoms. Linear and logistic regression models for predicting PIU, show how the depression level constitutes a risk factor for PIU: seven times higher for severe depression; more than five times higher for moderate depression; and more than two times for mild depression. (4) Conclusions: There is a clear association between depression and PIU, suggesting that a higher level of depression would act as a predictor of PIU. However, this finding is exploratory. Future studies should clarify the directionality of the relationship between both variables.

Developing students’ leadership profiles is among the important goals of educational systems aiming for future generations to take responsibility and advance their countries. With this perspective in mind, the PISA assessment includes items to measure students’ leadership behaviors. This study aims to extract student leadership profiles from the leadership-related items in the PISA 2022 application, using data from Cambodia, Peru, Paraguay, and Guatemala, which have different governance systems and cultural characteristics. The second purpose of the research is to determine the distribution of the identified leadership profiles in these countries and explain them in the context of governance and cultural characteristics. Latent class analysis was used to determine student leadership profiles. Accordingly, two-class and three-class latent models were found to be the most suitable models to explain student profiles. While the distinction between student profiles is more pronounced in the two-class model, the three-class model provides more detailed information about student profiles. In this respect, two-class and three-class latent models are reported comparatively. In the two-class latent model, students are labeled as the “Shy or Lack of Self-Confidence Group” and the “Active Leader or Influential Group”. In the three-class latent model, students are labeled as the “Moderate or Passive Leader Group”, the “Strong Leader or Influential Group”, and the “Avoidant or Leadership-Uncomfortable Group”. In both models, it is one of the striking findings that Cambodian students are in the low leadership profile, and Peruvian students are in the high leadership profile.

Method: Three patients with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD underwent the eight-week therapy program. Clinical assessments included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at baseline, post-assessment, and follow-up assessment, along with additional measures assessing other relevant symptoms and side effects. Results: The results demonstrated clinically relevant reductions in PTSD symptoms, indicated by a change in the CAPS-5 score at post-assessment (M = −18.00; SE = 6.48) and follow-up assessment (M = −25.33, SE = 5.58). Additionally, depressive symptoms showed notable improvement, with changes in HAMD scores at post-assessment (M = −8.33, SE = 3.07) and follow-up assessment (M = −9.00, SE = 3.77). Positive effects were also observed in anxiety reduction, decreased dissociations, and improvements in emotion regulation and disturbances of self-organization. Conclusions: Despite potential variations in clinical profiles among the patients, the therapy program demonstrated positive outcomes for all participants. Nasally administered ketamine was well tolerated and resulted in immediate symptom reduction in tension, anxiety, and common PTSD symptoms. However, to validate these findings and compare treatment efficacy, future randomized controlled trials are warranted, especially in comparison with trauma-focused therapy alone.

Available research suggests emerging best practices that promote effective SMH teaming and indicates the importance of having team members who are highly engaged (e.g., actively involved, retained on the team). Despite evidence that these factors improve team functioning, there is limited knowledge of SMH team prevalence, best practice use, and factors impacting member engagement among a diverse sample of elementary schools. This study surveyed a cross-sectional sample of elementary principals (n = 314) across the United States whose schools implement multi-tiered SMH programs. Most principals (89%, n = 280) reported using teams to organize these programs. Schools in urban/suburban communities, with 300 or more students, or with specific school funding for SMH activities were more likely to have SMH teams. Only one-third of principals reported that their team members participated in related training. Other SMH team best practices were commonly reported (by two-thirds or more teams). Results of a linear regression model indicate that larger teams (six or more members) and teams with access to resources had significantly higher member engagement scores. The study’s findings provide recommendations for practice and future research directions.

At present, a consensus on diagnostic criteria for problematic internet use remains elusive, leaving uncertainty regarding its classification as a distinct mental disorder. Extensive research efforts are underway to investigate its underlying causes, risk factors, and correlated adverse consequences. Nonetheless, research on problematic internet use (PIU) frequently faces challenges due to the absence of consistent and dependable evaluation methods, with many existing assessment tools lacking a solid theoretical basis. This study introduces a novel instrument that incorporates positive emotional regulation along with negative emotional regulation, compulsive use, and cognitive preoccupation, all crucial aspects of PIU. The study involved 3054 adolescents from Madrid, Spain, and employed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to validate the instrument’s structure. The resulting four-factor model includes Positive Emotional Regulation, Negative Emotional Regulation, Compulsive Use, and Cognitive Preoccupation. The instrument demonstrates good internal consistency and an association with risk factors, as evidenced by correlations with time spent on various internet-related activities. This comprehensive tool enhances our understanding of PIU and its underlying cognitive and emotional processes and provides a valuable resource for assessing and addressing problematic internet use in adolescents.

This systematic review investigates evidence on the outcomes of art-based leadership development, addressing the critical need for empirical validation of its effectiveness. A qualitative metasummary was employed to review 31 empirical studies published between 2008 and 2023. The studies were sourced from databases including Business Source Complete, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. The Quality Assessment for Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was used to assess the studies. The analysis revealed that art-based methods significantly enhance reflective and reflexive practices, higher-order cognitive skills, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal competencies. Representing leader development, art-based initiatives facilitate holistic self-discovery and transformative shifts in mindset, offering a valuable complement to conventional skill-based approaches. Despite these promising benefits, the review highlights a need for more rigorous empirical studies, particularly longitudinal and quantitative research, to substantiate the long-term effectiveness of art-based methods.

Positive environmental reinforcement is a significant mediator of avoidance and depression in healthy university students. However, this relationship is understudied in those with subthreshold depression or depression. Therefore, this study examined these associations in healthy university students and those who fit the criteria for subthreshold depression or depression. We conducted an online survey with 1200 undergraduate students (600 women and 600 men, mean age = 20.61, SD = 1.59). The results revealed significant differences in avoidance patterns (behavioral social, behavioral nonsocial, cognitive social, and cognitive nonsocial), with participants with depression presenting the highest scores. The results of the mediation analysis were similar to those of previous studies in healthy groups. However, in the subthreshold-depression group, positive environmental reinforcement was mediated by behavioral social and behavioral non-social avoidance and depressive symptoms. In the group with depression, positive environmental reinforcement was mediated only by behavioral nonsocial avoidance and depressive symptoms. Associations between avoidance patterns, positive environmental reinforcement, and depressive symptoms vary with the degree of depressive symptoms. The results revealed by this study provide new foundational insights to prevent subthreshold depression among university students from deteriorating into depression.

Addressing such issues requires mindful leadership to support employees and organizations in maintaining awareness during complex situations, which then promotes environmental sustainability. Drawing on social information processing theory, this study theorizes and tests the relationships between mindful leadership, employee moral reflectiveness, environmental passion, and employee green creativity. To test the model, we utilize a two-wave multisource dataset comprising 215 workers from manufacturing firms in China. The findings demonstrate that mindful leadership has a positive relationship with employee green creativity. Additionally, our research reveals that both moral reflectiveness and environmental passion serve as mediators in linking mindful leadership to employee green creativity. Crucially, our empirical analysis suggests a serial mediation model, examining the sequential role of moral reflectiveness and environmental passion in the relationship between mindful leadership and employee green creativity. The findings provide a new viewpoint on employees’ eco-friendly behaviors and have practical implications for improving environmental sustainability within organizations.

Specifically, considerable empirical work shows that variability in such capabilities is linked to differences in numerous academic outcomes. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the malleability of cognitive abilities. Thus, an emerging strand of research focuses on the use of computerized cognitive training to improve cognitive skills. This project addresses this issue with high-risk students attending community day schools. An in-school cognitive training program implemented (for 30 min per day) at each school site resulted in improvements for working memory, task switching, and processing speed after six total hours of participation. The current results provide evidence for the changeability of what were once thought to be static skills. Equally important, this study highlights the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training and critically extends intervention-based work to a student group that has received little attention. Implications of this work for cognitive research and educational support programs are discussed.

Suicide is a serious public health problem with complex biological, social and psychological risk factors and a multidimensional clinical appearance, occurring all over the world and ranking among the leading causes of death. In this study, psychological approaches explaining suicide were evaluated under the headings of first-generation and second-generation suicide theories, the different aspects of these theories were put forward, and previously published studies and recent evidence were reviewed. A literature review on the theoretical foundations of suicide is presented. First-generation suicide theories were developed before the 2000s and second-generation suicide theories were developed after the 2000s. While Psychodynamic Theory, Social Learning Theory, Hopelessness Theory, Shneidman’s Suicide Theory and Escape Theory are included under the title of first-generation suicide theories, Interpersonal Psychological Suicide Theory, Three Stage Suicide Theory, Complementary Motivational-Demotivational Theory and Variable Predisposition Theory are examined as second-generation suicide theories. The approaches of the theories provide important evidence in understanding suicidal behaviour and recognising various risk factors in the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal action. Controlling the risk factors may contribute both in terms of preventive community mental health and in the development of health policies.

However, there is a lack of research exploring the resources and adaptive strategies that promote resilience in informal caregivers. This cross-sectional study used psychometric network analysis to model the interplay between coping strategies, emotion regulation, trait resilience, and anxiety and depression symptoms in 351 Italian informal caregivers. The results showed that coping through a positive attitude, emotional reappraisal, and trait resilience were the most central and interconnected nodes in the network. These adaptive strategies buffered against the negative impact of anxiety and depression symptoms, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying resilience and well-being in informal caregivers. Clinically, it is crucial to assess and foster these resilience-promoting factors (positive attitude coping, cognitive reappraisal, and trait resilience) to help mitigate the mental health challenges faced by informal caregivers, especially in the context of public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers have demonstrated that utilizing more complex statistical methods, such as mixed-effects regression and hierarchical linear modeling, can lead to a more complete understanding of the variability observed within children’s word learning abilities. In the current paper, we demonstrate how a person-centered approach to data analysis can provide additional insights into the heterogeneity of word learning ability among children while also aiding researchers’ efforts to draw individual-level conclusions. Using previously published data with 32 typically developing and 32 late-talking infants who completed a novel noun generalization (NNG) task to assess word learning biases (i.e., shape and material biases), we compare this person-centered method to three traditional statistical approaches: (1) a t-test against chance, (2) an analysis of variance (ANOVA), and (3) a mixed-effects regression. With each comparison, we present a novel question raised by the person-centered approach and show how results from the corresponding analyses can lead to greater nuance in our understanding of children’s word learning capabilities. Person-centered methods, then, are shown to be valuable tools that should be added to the growing body of sophisticated statistical procedures used by modern researchers.

This study examined these reactions and analyzed how they are influenced by the individual characteristics of people with IDD (gender, age, and level of IDD) and the variables related to CB (type of behavior and its frequency and behavioral function). A total of 125 professionals assessed 293 people with IDD who exhibited CBs. The professionals were asked to complete the Behavior Problems Inventory—Short Form, the Emotional Reactions to Challenging Behavior Scale, and the Questions About Behavior Function measure. It was revealed that positive emotional reactions predominated over negative ones. Significant results were found regarding the level of disability and the age of people with IDD. Emotional reactions were related to the severity of CBs, especially self-injurious and aggressive/destructive behavior, as well as certain behavioral functions. The severity of CBs and the age of people with IDD emerge as key predictors of the emotional reactions of professionals. In short, these reactions vary according to different variables, highlighting the importance of interventions that address professionals’ emotional needs.

We hypothesized that there would be a reverse SDS in which highly sexually active lesbian women would be evaluated positively and highly sexually active gay men negatively, with both being evaluated more negatively than less sexually active gay men and lesbians. We also hypothesized that masculinity would moderate this effect, with participant masculinity being positively related to stronger negative evaluations of highly sexually active gay targets and more positive evaluations of highly sexually active lesbian targets. Results indicate a weak SDS in the areas of likability and morality, with highly sexually active lesbians being liked by masculine participants the most and highly sexually active gay men being rated as the least moral. The SDS appears to be influenced by expectations of gender roles and may be reversed for gay men and lesbian women because of these expectations.

This paper investigates the antecedents of intrapreneurial behaviour in the service sector in southern Spain, analysing the relationships between it and authentic leadership, as well as the mediating role of practiced creativity, autonomy and meaningful work. This study uses a quantitative approach through the distribution of a questionnaire. A total of 333 employees completed the research questionnaire. The results show that although authentic leadership has a significant negative direct effect on intrapreneurial behaviour, it positively and significantly promotes it through practiced creativity and meaningful work. In contrast to the previous two mediations, the mediation of autonomy was not significant. This research provides empirical findings that can contribute to a better understanding of intrapreneurial behaviour by highlighting the importance of balanced, authentic leadership and offering guidance to organisations in designing a work climate that enhances organisational effectiveness.
