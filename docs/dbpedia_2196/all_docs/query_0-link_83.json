        "text": "There is an increasingly pressing demand for improving the quality of teaching and learning English in Vietnam to meet the needs and interests of learners in the global integration. Research into vocabulary instruction through songs has indicated its positive effects on young learners' vocabulary gains and language learning, including English as a foreign or second language. However, little research focuses on the use of songs perceived by teachers in vocabulary instruction to young learners within the teaching and context in Vietnam where English is taught as a foreign language. This paper therefore considers teachers' perceptions about this instructional delivery at a foreign language center in the Mekong Delta. A descriptive study was conducted with seventy-five teachers from an English language center in the Mekong Delta. Data on teachers' perceptions about using songs to teach young learners' vocabulary were collected through the questionnaire and follow-up semi-structured interviews as part of a wider study over fifteen-week semester time. The findings indicate that teachers had positive perceptions about songs used in vocabulary instruction for young learners. Also, the findings provide teachers with insightful views of the effectiveness of implementing songs in promoting young learners' vocabulary and serve as a useful resource for teachers and practitioners by suggesting how to use songs to facilitate young learners' vocabulary. The paper concludes by giving pedagogical implications for further research into seeking alternative ways to maximize young learners' vocabulary learning.\n\nSongs are popular among language learners and a text genre that is yet to be fully exploited in language teaching. Questions arise regarding their lexical demand and vocabulary-learning opportunities they afford. Two pop song corpora were analyzed to determine the vocabulary size necessary to comprehend 95% and 98% of words in pop songs. The first corpus comprised 408 songs listed in recent US billboard charts. The second corpus consisted of 635 songs selected by teachers for language-teaching purposes. Results of an analysis using RANGE and 20 BNC word-frequency lists showed that the lexical demand of charts songs is overall clearly lower compared to other written genres but similar to spoken genres, as the most frequent 3000 word families plus proper nouns provided 95.1% coverage of tokens, and knowledge of 6000 word families plus proper nouns was necessary to reach 98.2% coverage. Teacher-selected songs have a lower lexical demand: Knowledge of the most frequent 2000 word families plus proper nouns was necessary to reach 95.5% coverage, while a vocabulary size of 4000 word families plus proper nouns provided coverage of 98.2% of words in the pedagogical corpus. Implications for the use of songs in ESL and EFL classrooms are discussed.\n\nEffect of rap songs on text recall and vocabulary expansion in second language acquisition CONTEXT Research on the use of songs as a pedagogical tool in the second language classroom has assumed greater importance more now than ever before. Viewing the use of songs in the classroom critically, Falioni (1993) states that the use of songs in second language acquisition has been relegated to recreation and entertainment. The intention to use songs in the classroom has often been met with ridicule and a cautionary statement that although students were enjoying class, they were not learning. So the researcher decided to conduct more empirical studies determining specific benefits of songs. As not much research has been done on using songs at the tertiary level in India, the researcher studies the use of rap songs to enhance vocabulary and aid in rote memorization. The researcher, therefore, decided to study the effect of rap songs on text recall and the occurrence of the din in the second language classroom. The significance of the present study would be to explicate regarding the melody-text integration in relation to memory. The present study would compare the occurrence of involuntary mental rehearsal, which may stimulate the language acquisition process by internal repetition of words and phrases and also provide students the opportunity to practice second language production through entertaining and culturally rich songs.\n\nIn the core of teaching the four macro skills of a language, vocabulary is considered to be the panacea to achieve absolute mastery of the target language. It is considered to be the crucial rudiment towards learning a foreign language and if not mastered in the apt way may lead to a serious impediment on a learner. Therefore, in order to avoid this from happening songs could be considered as a solution to assist the learners’ from having low mastery of English vocabulary. In the day to day communication hearing the songs could be considered as a solution to increase the tendency of awareness in recognising English vocabulary. Hence, this proposed study has intended to examine the use of English songs on learners’ vocabulary mastery skills, which was conducted through an experimental design. In this research, there was one class each that were chosen as research samples. The first one was considered as an experimental group, while later was the control. Each class had thirty student...\n\nEarly childhood is a child in the age of 0-6 years. In this age, the development and growth of physical and mental of children develop rapidly. Meanwhile, the aspects developed in early childhood education are: religious and moral values, physical (consisting of gross motor, fine motor and physical health), cognitive (consisting of general knowledge and science, concepts, shapes, colors, sizes and patterns, number concepts, symbols of numbers and letters), language (consisting of accepting language, expressing language and script) and emotional social. Language skills are one of the aspects which are developed at this age. Therefore, researchers intend to examine the level of mastery of the language of children through the song. This study aims to improve the vocabulary of early childhood, where this result affects the children’s ability to speak a foreign language in the future. This study is a Classroom Action Research, which aims to improve the ability of children English by usin...\n\nThe aim of this study is to find out whether or not there is a linguistic difference between pop and rock genres and if different music genres have an effect on the recognition of words in song listening activities. In order to investigate these issues, a mean lexical density analysis of 42 pop and rock songs was carried out and 4 of the songs were engaged in a listening activity in a university prep class so as to discover if different genres have an effect on the recognition of words or not. The results of the mean lexical density analysis showed that rock songs, although slightly, are more spoken than pop songs. Accordingly, the recognition success rate was higher in rock songs. The results display a bias towards rock songs; however, a more detailed analysis showed that the word/duration ratio of songs seems to be a more reliable predictor of a success in word recognition.\n\nVocabulary mastery is one of the requirements for students to be able to communicate both in spoken and written. There are many ways to improve students’ vocabulary mastery used by the language teacher. This paper aims to examine the use of English song to motivate students in learning English. In addition, this concerns on the use of English song to improve students’ vocabulary mastery. The respondents were fifteen elementary students of community groups of orphans An-nur Surabaya. The data were taken by assessing the students’ vocabulary mastery through pre-test and post-test, and analyzed to identify students’ vocabulary mastery. The result shows that students responded positively to this activity and indicated improvement in their vocabulary mastery. Thus, the study suggests that the use of English song is an effective media to improve the students’ vocabulary mastery.\n\nThis paper is about the Arabic component of a Song Project grant. The project addresses the critical need for advanced/intermediate content-based materials for the Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL). It is a Web-based course, capitalizing on songs as the base of a content-based course. The paper reports on the linguistic, cultural, cognitive and historical importance of songs -- and the methodology with which the researcher and materials developer designed the course and set the criteria for choosing the songs. The paper concludes with a description of the Web-based course."
