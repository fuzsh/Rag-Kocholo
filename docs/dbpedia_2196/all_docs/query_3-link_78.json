        "text": "A Complete Guide to MLA 8th Edition\n\nShare to Google Classroom\n\nKey differences in MLA 8th Edition\n\n1. One standard citation format that applies to every source type\n\nIn previous editions of the MLA Handbook, researchers were required to locate the citation format for the source that they used. For example, if a magazine was used, researchers needed to locate the specific citation format for periodicals. Due to the various ways that information is now received, in books, websites, lectures, tweets, Facebook posts, etc, it has become unrealistic for MLA to create citation formats for every source type. Now, there is one standard, universal format that researchers can use to create their citations.\n\n2. Inclusion of “containers” in citations.\n\nContainers are the elements that “hold” the source. For example, if a television episode is watched on Netflix, Netflix is the container. Both the title of the source and its container are included in a MLA 8th edition citation.\n\n3. The ability to use pseudonyms for author names\n\nIt is now acceptable to use online handles or screen names in place of authors’ names.\n\nExample:\n\n@WSJ. “Generation X went from the most successful in terms of homeownership rates in 2004 to the least successful by 2015.” Twitter, 8 Apr. 2016, 4:30 p.m., www.twitter.com/WSJ/status/718532887830753280\n\n4. Adding the abbreviations vol. and no. to magazine and journal article citations.\n\nIn MLA 7, there was no indication that the numbers in periodical citations referred to the volume and issue numbers.\n\nExample of a journal article citation in MLA 7th Edition:\n\nDelGuidice, Margaux. “When a Leadership Opportunity Knocks, Answer!” Library Media Connection 30.2 (2011): 48-49. Print\n\nAn example of a journal article citation in MLA 8th edition:\n\nDelGuidice, Margaux. “When a Leadership Opportunity Knocks, Answer!” Library Media Connection, vol. 30, no. 2, 2011, pp. 48-49.\n\n5. Inclusion of URLS\n\nIn previous versions of the MLA handbook, it was up to the discretion of the instructor whether URLs should be included in a citation. In MLA 8, it is highly recommended to include a URL in the citation. Even if it becomes outdated, it is still possible to trace the information online from an older URL.\n\nOmit “https://” or “https://” from the URL when including it in a MLA 8th edition citation.\n\n6. Omitting the publisher from some source types\n\nIt is not necessary to include the publisher for periodicals or for a web site when the name of the site matches the name of the publisher. For periodicals, the name of the publisher is generally insignificant.\n\n7. Omitting the city of publication\n\nIn previous versions of the MLA handbook, researchers included the city where the publisher was located. Today, this information generally serves little purpose and the city of publication can often be omitted.\n\nOnly include the city of publication if the version of the source differs when published in a different country (Example: British editions of books versus versions printed in the United States).\n\nFeatures that have not changed, and are the same as MLA 7:\n\nThe overall principles of citing and plagiarism\n\nThe use of in-text citations and works cited pages\n\n——————————————————————————————————————————\n\nHow to Format an MLA 8 Works Cited List\n\nThe purpose of a Works Cited list is to display the sources that were used for a project. Showcasing the sources that were used allows others to locate the original sources themselves. In addition, a Works Cited list gives credit to the original authors of the works that were consulted for a project.\n\nWorks Cited lists are typically found at the very end of a project. The last page of a research paper, the final slide of a presentation, and the last screen of a video are all appropriate places to display a Works Cited list.\n\nEach source is displayed in a special format, called a citation. This guide explains how to create citations for the Works Cited page.\n\nCitations are listed in alphabetical order by the first word in the citation, which is typically the last name of the author. In an MLA annotated bibliography, after each citation, you’ll also include a brief paragraph summarizing and evaluating the source.\n\nWhen there are two or more sources with the same author, only include the author’s name in the first citation. In the second or subsequent citations, use three hyphens in place of the author’s name, followed by a period.\n\nExample:\n\nSparks, Nicholas. Dear John. Grand Central, 2007, p. 82.\n\n– – -. A Walk to Remember. Warner, 1999.\n\nIf the individual is someone other than an author, such as a director or an editor, follow the three hyphens with a comma. Then, include the role of the individual after the comma. Place the citations in alphabetical order by the title of the work when there are multiple works by one author.\n\nExample:\n\nAllen, Woody. Getting Even. Vintage, 1978.\n\n– – -, director. Midnight in Paris. Sony Pictures Classics, 2011.\n\nThe only instance when it is acceptable to include an author’s name more than once in a Works Cited Page is when the author is a coauthor with another individual or team.\n\nExample:\n\nPatterson, James, and Chris Grabenstein. House of Robots. Little, Brown and Co., 2014.\n\nPatterson, James, and Chris Tebbetts. Middle School: Get Me Out of Here. Little, Brown and Co., 2012.\n\nWhen there is no author listed for a source, place it in alphabetical order by the title. Omit words such as A, An, and The. If the title begins with a number, write the number out in word form.\n\nExample:\n\nTwenty-Eight Days Later. Directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Alex Garland, Fox Searchlight Pictures, 2002.\n\nExample of an MLA Eighth Edition Works Cited Page:\n\nPatterson, James, and Chris Grabenstein. House of Robots. Little, Brown and Co., 2014.\n\nPatterson, James, and Chris Tebbetts. Middle School: Get Me Out of Here. Little, Brown and Co., 2012.\n\nSparks, Nicholas. Dear John. Grand Central, 2007, p. 82.\n\n– – – . A Walk to Remember. Warner, 1999.\n\nTwenty-Eight Days Later. Directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Alex Garland, Fox Searchlight Pictures, 2002.\n\nHow to Format the Author’s Name in an MLA 8th Edition Citation:\n\nHow to Format the Title in MLA 8\n\nHow to Format the Title of the Container in MLA 8\n\nHow to Format Other Contributors in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Format the Version in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Format Numbers in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Format the Publisher in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Format the Publication Date in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Format the Location in MLA 8:\n\nHow to Create In-Text Citations in MLA 8:"
