It can be tricky to know how to properly cite the Bible, since its formatting makes it different from other MLA style book citations.\n\nIn this guide, you will find the basics of what you need to know about how to cite a Bible in MLA 9, the current edition of MLA handbook (we follow the handbook but are not associated with it). This guide contains formatting guidelines and examples of how to cite a print Bible, an online version of the Bible, an e-book Bible, and a Bible app, both on in-text and on your reference page.\n\nHere’s a run-through of everything this page includes:\n\nWhy Cite?\n\nWhat You Need?\n\nWorks Cited Citation for a Print Version of the Bible\n\nWorks Cited Citation for an Online Version of the Bible\n\nWorks Cited Citation for an E-book Version of the Bible\n\nWorks Cited Citation for a Bible app with Multiple Translations\n\nCreating In-Text Citations for the Bible\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nWhy Cite?\n\nCiting sources is important in any research paper. It shows that you have done the necessary work to make credible arguments, it helps readers understand the context of your quotes, and it gives credit to the original sources. In order to avoid plagiarism, you need to cite all direct quotes or paraphrasing from other sources. Properly citing your sources shows that you are an experienced and ethical scholarly writer.\n\nWhat You Need\n\nTo create your reference page citation, you will need to following information:\n\ntitle of the Bible\n\nname of the editor(s) (if applicable)\n\nversion of the Bible (which may differ from the title)\n\npublication information.\n\nFor your in-text citation, you will need:\n\nthe title of the Bible\n\nthe Bible verse(s), including book name, chapter, and verse numbers\n\nWorks Cited Citation for a Print Version of the Bible\n\nFormat:\n\nBible Title. Edited by Editor’s First and Last Name, Bible Version, Publisher, Year of Publication.\n\nExample:\n\nHoly Bible. New International Version, Zondervan Publishing House, 1984.\n\nWorks Cited Citation for an Online Version of the Bible\n\nThe guidelines for citing an online version of the Bible are different from a print version. If your source is an e-book or an app, those guidelines are different as well. These are the guidelines for a Bible found on a website. Note that you only need to create one reference page citation for every web page you cite from the same online Bible (MLA Style Center).\n\nFormat:\n\nBible Title. Title of Website/Organization, URL. Accessed Date.\n\nExample:\n\nNew International Version. Biblica, www.biblica.com/bible/niv/genesis/2/. Accessed 22 Mar. 2020.\n\nWorks Cited Citation for an E-book Version of the Bible\n\nIn MLA, citing an e-book version of the Bible is the same as citing any other e-book (MLA Style Center). Since MLA e-book citations begin with the author name, skip straight to the title information instead of beginning the citation with the author.\n\nFormat:\n\nTitle. E-book edition, Publisher, year of publication.\n\nExample:\n\nThe King James Version of the Bible. E-book edition, Project Gutenberg, 2011.\n\nWorks Cited Citation for a Bible app with Multiple Translations\n\nList The Bible as the title and use the translation as the version (MLA Style Center). The name of the bible app should follow in italics, then the version (if available), and app publication information.\n\nFormat:\n\nTitle. Name of translation Version. App Title, app version number, app publisher, year of app publication.\n\nExample:\n\nThe Bible. Good News Bible Version. YouVersion, app version 5.0, British & Foreign Bible Society, 1996.\n\nCreating In-Text Citations for the Bible\n\nWhether you are citing a print or online version of the Bible, the in-text citation format remains the same. You will need the Bible verse you are quoting, including the book name, chapter number, and verse number. For longer book names, you will use an abbreviated version in your in-text citation (MLA Handbook). For example, abbreviate the book of Genesis as Gen. Shorter books can be completely written out, such as Mark.\n\nYou need to include the italicized title of the Bible, which should match the italicized title on your reference page, at the beginning of your first in-text citation. The remaining in-text citations should only include the book name, chapter, and verse number.\n\nFirst in-text citation format:\n\n(Title of Bible, Book Name Chapter.Verse)\n\nAll following citations:\n\n(Book Name Chapter.Verse)\n\nExample first in-text citation format:\n\n(New International Version, Gen. 2.1)\n\nFollowing citations:\n\n(Gen. 2.5)\n\n(Mark 3.5-7)\n\n(1 Cor. 1.5-11)\n\nIn this section, Jesus explained, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved” (King James Version, John 3:16-17).\n\nMany believed John the prophet was the Messiah, evidenced by him saying, “A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven. Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him” (John 3:27-28).\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nSolution #1: How to cite a Psalm as an in-text citation\n\nCreating an in-text MLA citation for passages from the Book of Psalms is similar to citing other books of the Bible.\n\nFirst, begin with indicating the book, Psalm, followed by the Psalm number and, if necessary, the specific lines quoted. The Psalm number and lines will be separated by a period.\n\nExample:\n\n(Psalm 28.6-9)\n\nSolution #2: How to cite a Bible that is not in English\n\nTo cite a Bible that isn’t in English for your full MLA citation in your bibliography, include the title of the Bible in its language of publication, followed by the translated English title in brackets. Italicize both titles in both languages.\n\nExample:\n\nLa Biblia de las Américas [The Bible of the Americas]. Biblica, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=G%C3%A9nesis+1&version=LBLA. Accessed 20 Nov. 2021.\n\nFor your in-text citation, you only need to include the title of the Bible in its language of publication, not the translated title as well. Italicize the title. Follow the title with the book and verse of your quotation, separated by a period.\n\nExample:\n\n(La Biblia de las Américas, Gen 1.1)\n\nSolution #3: How do I cite a Bible if there isn’t an editor listed?\n\nIf you want to cite a Bible, but cannot find the editor’s information, you may leave out the editor and edition information from your bibliographic citation. This applies to both hard copies and electronic Bibles.\n\nExample:\n\nHoly Bible. New International Version, Zondervan, 2011.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“How Do I Cite a Bible App with More than One Translation?” The MLA Style Center, 27 June 2019, style.mla.org/bible-app-multiple-translations/.\n\n“How Do I Cite an e-Book in MLA Style?” The MLA Style Center, 4 Sept. 2019, style.mla.org/citing-an-e-book/.\n\n“If I Am Citing an Online Version of a Sacred Text and Each Chapter Is on a Separate Web Page, Must Each Web Page Be Listed in the Works-Cited List?” The MLA Style Center, 2 July 2019, style.mla.org/citing-web-pages-sacred-text/.\n\nMLA Handbook. 9th ed., Modern Language Association of America, 2021.\n\nPublished August 10, 2012.
