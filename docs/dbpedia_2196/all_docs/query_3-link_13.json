Moissl-Eichinger\n\nArchaea represent a separate domain of life, next to bacteria and eukarya. As components of the human microbiome, archaea have been associated with various diseases, including periodontitis, endodontic infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and urogenital tract infections. Archaea are generally considered nonpathogenic; the reasons are speculative because of limited knowledge and gene annotation challenges. Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global microbial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating archaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory potential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial for investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve health outcomes in infectious diseases. We summarize potential reasons for archaeal nonpathogenicity, assess the association with infectious diseases in humans, and discuss the necessary experimental steps to enable mechanistic studies involving archaea.\n\nEID Duller S, Moissl-Eichinger C.

Caraballo et al.\n\nLeptospirosis is a common but underdiagnosed zoonosis. We conducted a 1-year prospective study in La Guaira State, Venezuela, analyzing 71 hospitalized patients who had possible leptospirosis and sampling local rodents and dairy cows. Leptospira rrs gene PCR test results were positive in blood or urine samples from 37/71 patients. Leptospira spp. were isolated from cultured blood or urine samples of 36/71 patients; 29 had L. interrogans, 3 L. noguchii, and 4 L. venezuelensis. Conjunctival suffusion was the most distinguishing clinical sign, many patients had liver involvement, and 8/30 patients with L. interrogans infections died. The Leptospira spp. found in humans were also isolated from local rodents; L. interrogans and L. venezuelensis were isolated from cows on a nearby, rodent-infested farm. Phylogenetic clustering of L. venezuelensis isolates suggested a recently expanded outbreak strain spread by rodents.

Sekar et al.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a fungal disease associated with substantial mortality rates among persons with advanced HIV disease. Our systematic review synthesized data on the global prevalence of Histoplasma­-caused antigenuria in persons with HIV. We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases on January 3, 2023, to identify cross-sectional and cohort studies evaluating Histoplasma antigenuria prevalence among adults with HIV infection. We calculated point estimates and 95% CIs to summarize prevalence. Of 1,294 studies screened, we included 15. We found Histoplasma antigenuria among 581/5,096 (11%; 95% CI 11%–12%) persons with HIV and 483/3,789 persons with advanced HIV disease (13%; 95% CI 12%–14%). Among persons with HIV and symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis, Histoplasma antigenuria prevalence was 14% (95% CI 13%–15%; 502/3,631 participants). We determined that persons with advanced HIV disease, inpatients, and symptomatic persons might benefit from a systematic approach to early detection of histoplasmosis using urine antigen testing.\n\nEID Sekar P, Hale G, Gakuru J, Meya DB, Boulware DR, Ellis J, et al.

Arendrup et al.\n\nAzole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (ARAf) fungi have been found inconsistently in the environment in Denmark since 2010. During 2018–2020, nationwide surveillance of clinical A. fumigatus fungi reported environmental TR34/L98H or TR46/Y121F/T289A resistance mutations in 3.6% of isolates, prompting environmental sampling for ARAf and azole fungicides and investigation for selection of ARAf in field and microcosmos experiments. ARAf was ubiquitous (20% of 366 samples; 16% TR34/L98H- and 4% TR46/Y121F/T289A-related mechanisms), constituting 4.2% of 4,538 A. fumigatus isolates. The highest proportions were in flower- and compost-related samples but were not correlated with azole-fungicide application concentrations. Genotyping showed clustering of tandem repeat–related ARAf and overlaps with clinical isolates in Denmark. A. fumigatus fungi grew poorly in the field experiment with no postapplication change in ARAf proportions. However, in microcosmos experiments, a sustained complete (tebuconazole) or partial (prothioconazole) inhibition against wild-type A. fumigatus but not ARAf indicated that, under some conditions, azole fungicides may favor growth of ARAf in soil.\n\nEID Arendrup M, Hare R, Jørgensen K, Bollmann UE, Bech TB, Hansen C, et al.

We conducted an epidemiologic, multicenter, retrospective study of all human CdSC infections diagnosed in French Guiana during January 1, 2016–December 31, 2021. A total of 64 infectious episodes were observed in 60 patients; 61 infections were caused by C. diphtheriae and 3 by C. ulcerans. Estimated incidence increased from 0.7 cases/100,000 population in 2016 to 7.7 cases/100,000 population in 2021. The mean patient age was 30.4 (+23.7) years, and male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1 (38/22). Of the 61 C. diphtheriae isolates, 5 tested positive for the diphtheria toxin gene, and all results were negative by Elek test; 95% (61/64) of cases were cutaneous, including the C. ulcerans cases.

In August 2006, a bluetongue (BT) outbreak caused by BTV serotype 8 began in northwestern Europe. The Netherlands was declared BT-free in February 2012, and annual monitoring continued. On September 3, 2023, typical BT clinical manifestations in sheep were notified to the Netherlands Food and Product Safety Consumer Authority. On September 6, we confirmed BTV infection through laboratory diagnosis; notifications of clinical signs in cattle were also reported. We determined the virus was serotype 3 by whole-genome sequencing. Retrospective analysis did not reveal BTV circulation earlier than September. The virus source and introduction route into the Netherlands remains unknown. Continuous monitoring and molecular diagnostic testing of livestock will be needed to determine virus spread, and new prevention strategies will be required to prevent BTV circulation within the Netherlands and Europe.\n\nEID Holwerda M, Santman-Berends I, Harders F, Engelsma M, Vloet R, Dijkstra E, et al.

We retrospectively investigated potential environmental acquisition, primarily water sources, of M. kansasii among 216 patients with pulmonary disease from an industrial city in Taiwan during 2015–2017. We analyzed sputum mycobacterial cultures using whole-genome sequencing and used hierarchical Bayesian spatial network methods to evaluate risk factors for genetic relatedness of M. kansasii strains. The mean age of participants was 67 years; 24.1% had previously had tuberculosis. We found that persons from districts served by 2 water purification plants were at higher risk of being infected with genetically related M. kansasii isolates. The adjusted odds ratios were 1.81 (1.25–2.60) for the Weng Park plant and 1.39 (1.12–1.71) for the Fongshan plant. Those findings unveiled the association between water purification plants and M. kansasii pulmonary disease, highlighting the need for further environmental investigations to evaluate the risk for M. kansasii transmission.\n\nEID Tobias Cudahy P, Liu P, Warren JL, Sobkowiak B, Yang C, Ioerger TR, et al.

McQuaid et al.\n\nNew tuberculosis (TB) drugs with little existing antimicrobial resistance enable a pan-TB treatment regimen, intended for universal use without prior drug-susceptibility testing. However, widespread use of such a regimen could contribute to an increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, potentially rendering the pan-TB regimen ineffective or driving clinically problematic patterns of resistance. We developed a model of multiple sequential TB patient cohorts to compare treatment outcomes between continued use of current standards of care (guided by rifampin-susceptibility testing) and a hypothetical pan-TB approach. A pan-TB regimen that met current target profiles was likely to initially outperform the standard of care; however, a rising prevalence of transmitted resistance to component drugs could make underperformance likely among subsequent cohorts. Although the pan-TB approach led to an increased prevalence of resistance to novel drugs, it was unlikely to cause accumulation of concurrent resistance to novel drugs and current first-line drugs.\n\nEID McQuaid C, Ryckman TS, Menzies NA, White RG, Cohen T, Kendall EA.

We conducted a retrospective wastewater surveillance study of the 2022–23 influenza season in 2 communities, Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor-Essex, Ontario, Canada, that form North America’s largest cross-border conurbation. We observed a positive relationship between influenza-related hospitalizations and the influenza A virus (IAV) wastewater signal in Windsor-Essex (ρ = 0.785; p<0.001) and an association between influenza-related hospitalizations in Michigan and the IAV wastewater signal for Detroit (ρ = 0.769; p<0.001). Time-lagged cross correlation and qualitative examination of wastewater signal in the monitored sewersheds showed the peak of the IAV season in Detroit was delayed behind Windsor-Essex by 3 weeks.

We derived a lower cutoff for identifying previous infections in a large blood donor cohort (N = 142,599) by using the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total-N Antibody assay, improving sensitivity while maintaining specificity >98%. We validated sensitivity in samples donated after self-reported swab-confirmed infection diagnoses. Sensitivity for first infections in unvaccinated donors was 98.1% (95% CI 98.0–98.2) and for infection after vaccination was 95.6% (95% CI 95.6–95.7) based on the standard cutoff. Regression analysis showed sensitivity was reduced in the Delta compared with Omicron period, in older donors, in asymptomatic infections, <30 days after infection, and for infection after vaccination. The standard Ortho N antibody threshold demonstrated good sensitivity, which was modestly improved with the revised cutoff.\n\nEID Grebe E, Stone M, Spencer BR, Akinseye A, Wright DJ, Di Germanio C, et al.

From a high-quality curated dataset of 1,480 HRSV-A and 1,385 HRSV-B genomes submitted to GenBank and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) public sequence databases through March 2023, we categorized HRSV-A/B sequences into lineages based on phylogenetic clades and amino acid markers. We defined 24 lineages within HRSV-A and 16 within HRSV-B and provided guidelines for defining prospective lineages. Our classification demonstrated robustness in its applicability to both complete and partial genomes.

N. Wambugu et al.\n\nRabies, a viral disease that causes lethal encephalitis, kills ≈59,000 persons worldwide annually, despite availability of effective countermeasures. Rabies is endemic in Kenya and is mainly transmitted to humans through bites from rabid domestic dogs. We analyzed 164 brain stems collected from rabid animals in western and eastern Kenya and evaluated the phylogenetic relationships of rabies virus (RABV) from the 2 regions. We also analyzed RABV genomes for potential amino acid changes in the vaccine antigenic sites of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein compared with RABV vaccine strains commonly used in Kenya. We found that RABV genomes from eastern Kenya overwhelmingly clustered with the Africa-1b subclade and RABV from western Kenya clustered with Africa-1a. We noted minimal amino acid variances between the wild and vaccine virus strains. These data confirm minimal viral migration between the 2 regions and that rabies endemicity is the result of limited vaccine coverage rather than limited efficacy.\n\nEID Wambugu EN, Kimita G, Kituyi SN, Washington MA, Masakhwe C, Mutunga LM, et al.

Lambert et al.\n\nWhite-tailed deer are susceptible to scrapie (WTD scrapie) after oronasal inoculation with the classical scrapie agent from sheep. Deer affected by WTD scrapie are difficult to differentiate from deer infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD). To assess the transmissibility of the WTD scrapie agent and tissue phenotypes when further passaged in white-tailed deer, we oronasally inoculated wild-type white-tailed deer with WTD scrapie agent. We found that WTD scrapie and CWD agents were generally similar, although some differences were noted. The greatest differences were seen in bioassays of cervidized mice that exhibited significantly longer survival periods when inoculated with WTD scrapie agent than those inoculated with CWD agent. Our findings establish that white-tailed deer are susceptible to WTD scrapie and that the presence of WTD scrapie agent in the lymphoreticular system suggests the handling of suspected cases should be consistent with current CWD guidelines because environmental shedding may occur.\n\nEID Lambert ZJ, Bian J, Cassmann ED, Greenlee M, Greenlee JJ.

Fusaro et al.\n\nInfluenza A/H9 viruses circulate worldwide in wild and domestic avian species, continuing to evolve and posing a zoonotic risk. A substantial increase in human infections with A/H9N2 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and the emergence of novel reassortants carrying A/H9N2-origin internal genes has occurred in recent years. Different names have been used to describe the circulating and emerging A/H9 lineages. To address this issue, an international group of experts from animal and public health laboratories, endorsed by the WOAH/FAO Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza, has created a practical lineage classification and nomenclature system based on the analysis of 10,638 hemagglutinin sequences from A/H9 AIVs sampled worldwide. This system incorporates phylogenetic relationships and epidemiologic characteristics designed to trace emerging and circulating lineages and clades. To aid in lineage and clade assignment, an online tool has been created. This proposed classification enables rapid comprehension of the global spread and evolution of A/H9 AIVs.\n\nEID Fusaro A, Pu J, Zhou Y, Lu L, Tassoni L, Lan Y, et al.

Duller and C. Moissl-Eichinger\n\nArchaea represent a separate domain of life, next to bacteria and eukarya. As components of the human microbiome, archaea have been associated with various diseases, including periodontitis, endodontic infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and urogenital tract infections. Archaea are generally considered nonpathogenic; the reasons are speculative because of limited knowledge and gene annotation challenges. Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global microbial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating archaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory potential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial for investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve health outcomes in infectious diseases. We summarize potential reasons for archaeal nonpathogenicity, assess the association with infectious diseases in humans, and discuss the necessary experimental steps to enable mechanistic studies involving archaea.\n\nEID Duller S, Moissl-Eichinger C.

A. Fishman and N. J. Mueller\n\nXenotransplantation, transplantation into humans of vascularized organs or viable cells from nonhuman species, is a potential solution to shortages of transplantable human organs. Among challenges to application of clinical xenotransplantation are unknown risks of transmission of animal microbes to immunosuppressed recipients or the community. Experience in allotransplantation and in preclinical models suggests that viral infections are the greatest concern. Worldwide, the distribution of swine pathogens is heterogeneous and cannot be fully controlled by international agricultural regulations. It is possible to screen source animals for potential human pathogens before procuring organs in a manner not possible within the time available for surveillance testing in allotransplantation. Infection control measures require microbiological assays for surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients and research into zoonotic potential of porcine organisms. Available data suggest that infectious risks of xenotransplantation are manageable and that clinical trials can advance with appropriate protocols for microbiological monitoring of source animals and recipients.\n\nEID Fishman JA, Mueller NJ.

The hepatitis A outbreak (153 cases) was associated with hepatitis A virus genotype IA. The IMD outbreak (44 cases) was associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C, sequence type 11, clonal complex 11. The mpox outbreak in Florida (2,845 cases) was part of a global epidemic. The hepatitis A and IMD outbreaks were concentrated in Central Florida and peaked during March–­June, whereas mpox cases were more heavily concentrated in South Florida and had peak incidence in August. HIV infection was more common (52%) among mpox cases than among hepatitis A (21%) or IMD (34%) cases. Where feasible, vaccination against hepatitis A, meningococcal disease, and mpox should be encouraged among at-risk groups and offered along with program services that target those groups.\n\nEID Doyle TJ, Gumke M, Stanek D, Moore J, Buck B, Locksmith T, et al.

To determine the relationship between immune response and clinical and therapeutic outcomes, we studied 101 DL and 101 cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases and determined cytokines and chemokines in supernatants of mononuclear cells stimulated with leishmania antigen. Patients were treated with meglumine antimoniate (20 mg/kg) for 20 days (CL) or 30 days (DL); 19 DL patients were instead treated with amphotericin B, miltefosine, or miltefosine and meglumine antimoniate. High levels of chemokine ligand 9 were associated with more severe DL. The cure rate for meglumine antimoniate was low for both DL (44%) and CL (60%), but healing time was longer in DL (p = 0.003). The lowest cure rate (22%) was found in DL patients with >100 lesions. However, meglumine antimoniate/miltefosine treatment cured all DL patients who received it; therefore, that combination should be considered as first choice therapy.\n\nEID Machado P, Lago A, Cardoso TM, Magalhaes A, Carvalho LP, Lago T, et al.

Because human S. suis infections are not notifiable in most countries, incidence is underestimated. We aimed to increase insight into the molecular epidemiology of human S. suis infections in Europe. To procure data, we surveyed 7 reference laboratories and performed a systematic review of the scientific literature. We identified 236 cases of human S. suis infection from those sources and an additional 87 by scanning gray literature. We performed whole-genome sequencing to type 46 zoonotic S. suis isolates and combined them with 28 publicly available genomes in a core-genome phylogeny. Clonal complex (CC) 1 isolates accounted for 87% of typed human infections; CC20, CC25, CC87, and CC94 also caused infections. Emergence of diverse zoonotic clades and notable severity of illness in humans support classifying S. suis infection as a notifiable condition.\n\nEID Brizuela J, Roodsant TJ, Hasnoe Q, van der Putten B, Kozakova J, Slotved H, et al.

Survey-weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine willingness among participants at each site were compared within demographic groups by using linear regression models with inverse variance weighting. Among 22,284 persons >2 months of age and older, median prevalence of infection (prior, active, or both) was 12.9% across sites and similar across age groups. Within each site, average prevalence of infection was 3 percentage points higher for Black than White persons and average vaccine willingness was 10 percentage points lower for Black than White persons and 7 percentage points lower for Black persons than for persons in other racial groups. The higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among groups with lower vaccine willingness highlights the disparate effect of COVID-19 and its complications.\n\nEID Justman J, Skalland T, Moore A, Amos CI, Marzinke MA, Zangeneh SZ, et al.

We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to describe clinical and biologic characteristics, patient outcomes, and factors associated with death and response to antifungal therapy. We identified 55 patients with invasive fusariosis from 16 ICUs in France during 2002­–­­2020. The mortality rate was high (56%). Fusariosis-related pneumonia occurred in 76% of patients, often leading to acute respiratory failure. Factors associated with death included elevated sequential organ failure assessment score at ICU admission or history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or hematologic malignancies. Neither voriconazole treatment nor disseminated fusariosis were strongly associated with response to therapy. Invasive fusariosis can lead to multiorgan failure and is associated with high mortality rates in ICUs. Clinicians should closely monitor ICU patients with a history of hematologic malignancies or stem cell transplantation because of higher risk for death.\n\nEID Demonchy J, Biard L, Clere-Jehl R, Wallet F, Mokart D, Moreau A, et al.

We observed no major differences in phylogenetic groups or virulence profiles between the 2 collections. However, sequence type (ST) analysis showed the presence of 6/32 (19%) ST1193 strains causing EOS, the same frequency as in the highly virulent clonal group ST95.

Emerging ST1193 appears to be highly prevalent, virulent, and antimicrobial resistant in neonates. However, the physiopathology of EOS caused by ST1193 has not yet been elucidated.

In all 3 cases, the patients had refractory otorrhea. Although their additional symptoms varied, all patients had an ear canal stenosis and A. ignavus detected in microbiologic swab specimens. A correct identification of A. ignavus in the clinical microbiology laboratory is hampered by the inability to identify it by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Also, the bacterium might easily be overlooked because of its morphologic similarity to bacterial species of the resident skin flora. We conclude that a high index of suspicion is warranted to identify A. ignavus and that it should be particularly considered in patients with chronic external otitis who do not respond clinically to quinolone ear drop therapy.\n\nEID Roth S, Linxweiler M, Rehner J, Schmartz G, Becker SL, Kühn J.
