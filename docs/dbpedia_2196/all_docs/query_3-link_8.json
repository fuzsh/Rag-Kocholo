To reference the performance (live or recorded), then use this format. Note that many courses at ECU that commonly cite plays use a referencing style other than APA; check your assignment instructions to be sure you should be using APA 7th style.\n\nThe director (not the writer of the text) will usually be considered the 'author' of a performance. If there is no director for a dance performance, the choreographer might be considered the author.\n\nThe date is the performance date, not the year the play was written.\n\nDescribe the type of performance in square brackets after the title. Include the production or theatre company as the 'publisher' in the source element.\n\nMany performances are only available on one streaming platform or from one provider. If the work has this type of limited distribution, you might include the URL to the database in order to help the reader locate the work.\n\nIn-text: (Fentiman, 2018)\n\nFentiman, M. (Director).

If you are reproducing an image or a part of an image in your own work, you will need to add a caption below the image. The page on Figures, Tables, & Images has guidelines, example captions, and a video to explain the concepts.\n\nIn-text: (Chagall, 1912)\n\nChagall, M. (1912). Calvary [Painting].

For common software and apps (e.g. Microsoft Office, Twitter, Photoshop, etc.) mentioned in your work but not quoted or paraphrased, you do not need to provide a reference list entry. If you are not sure if it is common, include a reference.\n\nThis example is for the software or app itself. For content hosted on the app (e.g. a tweet that was posted on Twitter), you should use a different format.\n\nIn-text: (Epocrates, 2019)\n\nEpocrates. (2019). Epocrates medical references (Version 18.12) [Mobile app]. App Store. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epocrates/id281935788?mt=8\n\nWhen using APA 7th style referencing, you should only use the webpage format if the source you are citing does not fit into any other category (see section 9.2 in the publication manual). For instance, an online dictionary or Wikipedia entry is a reference work that is hosted online, and a blog post is a periodical article that is hosted online. Many journal articles and books are only published electronically, but they will still be considered an article or a book. Consider whether the source you are citing could fit into another category.\n\nFor most webpage sources, you will give a more specific date than just the year to ensure that the exact source you used can be found. However, it can be more difficult to find the publication date for works found online: sometimes the only date you can find is the copyright year in the footer of the website. If you can't find the date when the content you're citing was actually published, treat it as \"no date\".\n\nThis section has examples of webpages, as well as other sources you might find online.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor. (Year, Month Day). Webpage title. Website Name. URL\n\nWebpage with an individual author\n\nIn-text: (Freeman, 2000). Even if a more specific date is included, only the year is used in your in-text citation.\n\nFreeman, S. (2000, April 1). How anesthesia works.

(n.d.). What is nanotechnology and what is nanomedicine? https://www.britishsocietynanomedicine.org/what-isnanomedicine/\n\nWhole website\n\nIf you are discussing a website as a whole, but you are not citing any specific content on a particular page, you do not need to include an end-text reference. Just include the web address after your first mention of the site, within your own writing.\n\nHow is a website different from a webpage? A website is a collection of webpages (or reports, videos, and so on), similar to the way a journal or magazine is a collection of articles. You may wish to discuss a whole website or journal—for instance, to evaluate its credibility—but if you are citing information found on a website, you should provide a reference to the specific page or pages you used.\n\nKidsPsych (http://www.kidspsych.org) is an interactive website for children…\n\nOnline-only news source\n\nMost newspaper articles will use the format shown in the periodicals section. However, for online-only news sources (e.g. BBC News, HuffPost, ABC News), articles are treated as a webpage. This means that the article title is in italics, and the site is not.\n\nIn-text: (Vrajlal, 2020)\n\nVrajlal, A. (2020, January 10).

The Conversation. https://theconversation.com/whats-the-best-most-effective-way-to-take-notes-41961\n\nOnline sources designed to change\n\nSome online sources do not have one specific publication date, because they are designed to change frequently. If the page or entry has a permanent or stable link that will retrieve an archived version of the page as it looked when you accessed it, include that link and reference the page as normal (see the Wikipedia example below).\n\nIf the page does not have a permanent link to the version you used, include a retrieval date so the reader will be aware that the page they accessed might not contain the same information you saw.\n\nIn-text: (Bureau of Meteorology, n.d.)\n\nBureau of Meteorology. (n.d.). Perth forecast. Retrieved February 17, 2020, from http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/forecasts/perth.shtml\n\nOnline source with permanent link (Wikipedia; no author)\n\nFor frequently-updating sources where a permanent or archive link exists for the version you used, there might be a publication date included for the material. The publication date for this Wikipedia article is the date for the version I accessed in January 2020.\n\nNote that Wikipedia is treated as a reference work, not a webpage source, so its format will look different to others on this page.\n\nIn-text: (\"Bird,\" 2019). The title takes the place of the author in-text as well. For help formatting a title in-text, see this section.\n\nBird. (2019, December 1). In Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bird&oldid=928751793\n\nClass materials, e.g. lecture notes and case studies from your unit site\n\nIf the class materials you would like to reference are on a closed site (such as Canvas), you can still reference them if you expect that the people reading your work will have access to that site, name the site and link to the login page only. If they are on a closed site, and you are writing for publication, or you expect your readers would not have access to the site, then you should either find another source or cite as personal communications.\n\nIf the materials you would like to cite are available online to anyone, include the full link. Items in your reading list or linked in your unit site may actually be journal articles, book chapters, or something else. If this is the case, use the reference type for a journal article, book chapter, etc.\n\nFor class materials, use the full date if you can find it. Many lecture notes will not have the date displayed, but if your lecturer uploaded the notes on Canvas there might be a publication date for the post.\n\nClass materials in the unit site (e.g. Canvas)\n\nIn-text: (Watson, 2020)\n\nWatson, S.

University of Oslo, Department of Economics. https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/oekonomi/ECON4150/v18/lecture1_intro-reviewofprobability.pdf\n\nThis format is the same as the format used for reports, streaming videos, etc. If you would like to cite a lecture you watched on Panopto, Canvas or YouTube, cite it similarly to the above examples, changing the type as appropriate, e.g. [Panopto lecture for ENS1000]. Make sure there is enough information for the reader to be able to find the exact lecture you are citing.\n\nFor more information, see the APA Style website: online course materials; classroom/intranet sources; PowerPoint slides.\n\nYouTube or streaming video\n\nCredit the person or group who uploaded the video as the author, even if they did not create it. This is to help the reader find the video.\n\nInclude the screen name in brackets after the uploader's real name, if both are known.\n\nIn-text: (McDonnell, 2011).

A Philosopher's Take. https://aphilosopherstake.com/2018/12/06/discovery-and-invention-part-i-distinctions-and-notation/\n\nSocial media\n\nThis format is used when the content you are citing is a social media post of some sort. If you found another source through social media, you should cite the work you used. You do not need to say how you found it.\n\nSocial media references with no title should include up to the first 20 words of the post, using the spelling and capitalisation of the original source. You do not need to change this content to sentence case. Include any emojis if you can. If there are any audiovisual elements, note their presence in square brackets after the title.\n\nThese references are unusual in an academic context, so it might be helpful to include a description of the type of work you're citing (Status update, Twitter profile, Online forum post, etc.) in your reference. The type should be within square brackets, before the punctuation for the title element. In some cases, you will have two sets of information in brackets at the end of the title, as in this example:\n\nIn-text: (Evans, 2020)\n\nEvans, C. [@ChrisEvans]. (2020, March 24).

Twitter. https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/1242170836754276365\n\nFor a profile or timeline page that is intended to change over time with new updates, use \"no date\" for the publication date and include a retrieval date indicating when you accessed the page.\n\nIn-text: (Ardern, n.d.)\n\nArdern, J. (n.d.). Home [Facebook page]. Facebook. Retrieved March 25, 2020, from https://www.facebook.com/jacindaardern/\n\nIf you use software and AI tools to generate images or text, analyse data, or in any way help create your work, this use should be acknowledged. Similarly, code and data originally created or gathered by someone else must be cited, even when you have transformed it into a new product.\n\nThe version of the software you use affects the output, so it must be included in your reference. You may also need to include the software version within your writing as part of your acknowledgement of use.\n\nFormat:\n\nAuthor, A. A. (Date). Title of the software/app (Version x.x) [Description]. Publisher or app store name. URL\n\nThe author is the creator of the software, tool, or dataset. If you are citing code or data that does not have a title, describe the contents in brackets in place of the title. The description should explain what kind of item you are citing, in brackets and with sentence case capitalisation. Examples: Software, Mobile app, Data set, Source code, AI image generation tool. Provide a link to where the app or software can be downloaded or accessed.\n\nArtificial intelligence tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Midjourney, Bard)\n\nAI tools are new and constantly developing, so this guidance may change over time.\n\nIf you have used an AI tool, you must acknowledge that use as a part of academic integrity. Note that each unit you take will have different rules for how you may use an AI tool or text generator; you should clarify with your lecturer if your use is appropriate before you rely on one of these tools for help. You may wish to keep a copy of your prompts and the responses generated by the AI tool, in case you need to show someone else how you used it.\n\nAll use of AI tools should be acknowledged with a written statement at end of your assignment, including 1) which tools you used, and the version number, and 2) how you used them. For example:\n\nAcknowledgement: I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (Version 4) to brainstorm ideas for the structure of my assessment and to help me understand what cultural norms are. I used Grammarly Go to help edit my draft.\n\nImages used in this presentation were created using DALL-E.\n\nIn some assessments, you may also need to make a declaration that your work is your own and that you have appropriately cited or acknowledged all resources you have used to assist you. Please read these declarations carefully when you submit. A declaration may look like this:\n\nMore examples of ways to acknowledge your use can be found on the APA's official APA Style Blog. If you are a law student using AGLC4 style, follow the advice on the AGLC Legal Citation page.\n\nGenerative AI tools should not be used as a source of information for your assessments, so in most cases you would not directly reference their output outside of your acknowledgement. Locate more credible and authoritative sources to support the information they generate, and reference those sources instead. However, you may need to include in-text citations in addition to your acknowledgement, if you have created an image or have decided to quote or paraphrase information provided by the tool. You must include an end-text reference if you have an in-text citation for an AI tool. You may also need to include an end-text reference for the AI tool in your reference list, even if you have not cited its use directly; check with your unit teaching staff.\n\nThe format for your reference follows the software format. The author is the creator of the software, not the AI tool itself. You should include the version of the AI tool that you used.\n\nIn-text: (OpenAI, 2022)\n\nOpenAI. (2022). ChatGPT (Version 3.5) [AI text generation tool]. https://chat.openai.com/\n\nNote that the version of ChatGPT and similar AI tools is likely to change frequently, as the creators edit or update the code and parameters. Check for the version of the tool you are using each time you use it, and record it with the output. The format of a version number may look unusual, but report the details you see. For example: (March 23 version), (Version V1), or (Version 3.3.070).\n\nSoftware or mobile app\n\nProvide a reference and an in-text citation for any software or mobile app if you use a specific idea or quote from it. You should also provide a reference (including the version) for apps or software used to help create your work, analyse your data, or generate images. Common software and apps (e.g. Microsoft Office, Twitter, Photoshop, etc.) mentioned in your work do not require a reference list entry. If you are not sure if it is common, include a reference.\n\nThis example is for the software or app itself. For content hosted on the app (e.g. a tweet that was posted on Twitter), you should use a different format, as shown in the Online sources section.\n\nIn-text: (Epocrates, 2019)\n\nEpocrates. (2019).
