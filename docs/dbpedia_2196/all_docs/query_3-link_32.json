        "text": "Donald Trump’s Got Troubles\n\nHis campaign is careening, his poll numbers are slipping, and, after something of a summer lull, he is due for several confrontations in court.\n\nIn London, Taylor Swift and Her Fans Are in Their “Fearless” Era\n\nFollowing a terrorist threat targeting the pop star’s concerts in Vienna, and the murder of three children at a Swift-themed dance party in the U.K., the Eras Tour continues.\n\nThe Story That “Hillbilly Elegy” Doesn’t Tell\n\nLike many memoirs, J. D. Vance’s book misses a few details, some of which complicate the story upon which he has based much of his politics.\n\nThe Warped World of the U.K. Rioters\n\nThe United Kingdom has become more multicultural, but a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence raises the possibility that it is also becoming more racist.\n\nLetter from Biden’s Washington\n\nKamala Harris’s Best Campaign Surrogate Is Donald Trump\n\nThe ex-President’s tired old show is a great advertisement for his new rival.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nPaul Skenes Is a Heroic Figure in Baseball’s Antiheroic Age\n\nThe tall, young, mustachioed pitcher throws hard—so hard that his team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, is doing everything it can to be careful with him.\n\nFault Lines\n\nWhat Makes Nancy Pelosi So Appealing Now\n\nHer ruthless pragmatism and reliance on subtext are refreshing after years of lefty infighting and Donald Trump’s endless blather.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\nWith “Close Your Eyes,” a Legendary Filmmaker Makes a Stunning Return\n\nIn his first feature in more than two decades, the Spanish director Víctor Erice tells a story haunted by the ghosts of cinema past.\n\nPhoto Booth\n\nThe Outback Observed, and Transformed\n\nFor “Big Sky,” the Australian photographer Adam Ferguson went in search of his own country, and found a place he both did and didn’t know.\n\nBooks\n\nIs A.I. Making Mothers Obsolete?\n\nHelen Phillips’s new novel takes place in a dystopian world where the environment has been devastated and humans have outsourced their best selves to tireless, empathetic robots.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nJacques Rozier’s Inspired Improvisations\n\nA retrospective of the great director’s rarely screened movies reveals his extraordinary vision of ordinary life.\n\nUnder Review\n\nA Frank Account of an Unequal Art-World Friendship\n\nOrlando Whitfield’s memoir of his fifteen-year friendship with the disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick gives a momentous relationship its due, with unusual directness.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nCharli XCX, Chappell Roan, and the Unstable Hierarchy of Pop\n\nThis summer’s releases have breathed new life into the genre—and underscored the challenges of staying relevant in a cutthroat music landscape.\n\n“The Door Between Us”\n\nAgain, I pressed my ear against the wall, but I heard nothing. Why couldn’t I have said something to her?\n\n“The Penthouse”\n\nWe were lying on their bed. We were trying to be still and not ruin anything else. Soon we might even fall into sleep, our least disruptive state of being.\n\n“Lucy’s Boyfriend”\n\nYou could be involved in other people’s wanting, whether you knew it or not.\n\n“The Boy at War and at Home”\n\nHis toy cars are out of gas, creating chaos at the checkpoint, but the plastic horses can still get through.\n\n“Damages”\n\nTug too hard on a little footsy, and you wind up with a footsy in hand and a baby in tears.\n\n“A Children’s Story”\n\n“I want a happy ending,” the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. “You don’t know how to write happy.”\n\nWhat Tweens Get from Sephora\n\nKids are mimicking the semi-professionals they see on their phones, imbibing ideas about beauty rooted in deep desires and capitulations.\n\nAn Ode to Old Bay\n\nThe condiment is a spice-and-herb mix that’s super salty and slightly sweet, a perfect culinary simulation of late summer and early fall. Marylanders put it on everything; everybody should.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons."
