Archduchess Maria Anna’s Sapphire Cluster Brooch: This lovely brooch features a 30-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by twelve brilliants, in a classic design that echoes the famous Albert Brooch from the British royal collection.

The brooch sold for $551,010.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n9. Archduchess Maria Anna’s Fancy Orangy Pink Diamond Ring: This classic cluster ring features an unusual 2.44-carat fancy orangy pink diamond framed by additional colorless diamonds.

The suite contains diamonds owned by several members of the Bourbon-Parma family, including Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (son of King Charles X of France), the Duchess of Angouleme (daughter of Queen Marie Antoinette), and Princess Isabella of Croy (mother of Archduchess Maria Anna, Duchess of Parma). The demi-parure sold for $848,853.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n6. Archduchess Maria Anna’s Fleur-de-Lis Tiara: We featured this bold fleur-de-lis tiara recently here at The Court Jeweller.
