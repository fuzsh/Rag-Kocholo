        "text": "Félix Marie Vincent of Bourbon was the sixth of twelve children, the son of the last exiled Duke Robert of Parma of the House of Bourbon, who reigned until 1860, and his second wife, Duchess Maria Antonia of Braganza, Infanta of Portugal, younger sister of Grand Duchess Maria Ana.\n\nPrince Félix attended boarding schools in Austria and England, where he obtained his baccalaureate in 1913.\n\nDuring World War I, he completed his military service in Austria with two of his brothers, while his other two brothers were active in the Belgian army. As a first lieutenant, Prince Félix saved his brother-in-law, Emperor Charles of Austria, from drowning in 1917.\n\nAfter he got engaged to Princess Charlotte in November 1918, he gave up his service as a cavalry captain in the Austrian army.\n\nSeveral international developments, which were to be seen as the first signs of World War II, prompted Prince Félix to start planning for a possible exile of the Grand Ducal Family in 1939. He established the first contacts with President Roosevelt. In consultation with Foreign Minister Joseph Bech, he prepared the establishment of a Luxembourg legation in Washington.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, he followed the Grand Duchess and the Luxembourg Government into exile via France and Spain to Portugal. In July, Prince Félix went to the United States with his six children. The Grand Duchess joined them in October before the Family moved to Montreal, Canada, in December, where the Princes and Princesses stayed and continued their studies. In August 1941, the Grand Duchess and Prince Félix flew to London and settled there for the duration of the war. Good relations with the United States were consolidated, inter alia through several receptions organised by President Roosevelt at the White House in 1942.\n\nIn 1942, Prince Félix and the Crown Prince decided to join the British army as volunteers to fight with the Allies to liberate Luxembourg. From November 1942 onwards, Prince Félix served in the Northern Command of the British Army. In May 1944, he was appointed head of the Luxembourg military mission to the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces.\n\nAfter the Allied landings in Normandy, Prince Félix took part in the liberation of Paris and on 10 September 1944 in the liberation of Luxembourg City. During the Battle of the Bulge, he remained in Luxembourg and assisted the Allies in the defence of the country.\n\nOn 14 April 1945, he accompanied the Grand Duchess on her triumphant return to Luxembourg. The Grand Ducal Family moved to Fischbach Castle. Prince Félix was entrusted with the duties of Inspector General of the new Luxembourg Army from 1945 to 1967. From 1947 onwards, he accompanied the Grand Duchess on numerous official visits abroad, the last of which were a visit to the United States and a State visit to Paris in 1963."
