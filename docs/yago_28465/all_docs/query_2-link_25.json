        "text": "Pictures of the event, which took place on Saturday 12 September, showed the beautiful Gabriella wearing an elegant white bridal gown with a sheer lace overlay on her shoulders and arms, accessorised with a veil and the Grand Duchess Adelaide Tiara. This exquisite piece from the Luxembourg family collection features a diamond leaf and berry design and a pale blue central stone, which paired beautifully with Prince Henri’s pale blue tie.\n\nThe couple’s daughter, Victoria, looked adorable in traditional regional dress, while other family members in attendance included Gabriella’s parents, Archduke Carl Christian and Archduchess Marie-Astrid of Austria.\n\nPrince Henri, 28, reportedly asked Gabriella, 26, to marry him on October 22, 2017 before she gave birth to their beautiful daughter, Victoria Antonia Marie-Astrid Lydia, just over a week later on the 30th. The couple are very distantly related, they are both great-grandchildren of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg and her husband Prince Félix (né Bourbon-Parma). Beautiful Gabriella, who was born in Geneva, is the youngest of five and the second daughter of Archduke Carl Christian of Austria and Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg. Gabriella attended a British School in Brussels, Belgium and is the spitting image of her sister, Archduchess Marie Christine, who also has a son, Count Gabriel.\n\nPrince Henri was born in Denmark and is the youngest child and second son of Prince Erik of Bourbon-Parma and Countess Lydia Holstein-Ledreborg, who divorced in 1999. Prince Henri’s paternal grandfather is the handsome French businessman and former racing driver, Michel de Bourbon-Parma, who died last year aged 92.\n\nPreviously, the aristocratic couple maintained a long-distance relationship since Prince Henri was studying for a master’s degree in law at the University of Copenhagen, while Gabriella still lived with her family in Switzerland.\n\nMore from Tatler"
