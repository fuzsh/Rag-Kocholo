        "text": "Charles I of Austria (17 August 1887 - 3 August 1940) was the Emperor of Austria-Hungary from 21 November 1916 until 15 May 1917 and then of the Austrian Commonwealth until his death on 3 August 1940. On the 28 June 1914 his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo causing the First World War. Charles then became the Crown Prince and ascended the throne following the death of his great-uncle Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1916. He signed peace treaties with the Triple Entente and withdrew Austria from the war. He then federalised the multi-ethnic Empire through the Ausgleich on the 15 May 1917.\n\nBefore the POD[]\n\nCharles was born 17 August 1887 in the Persenbeug Castle to Archduke Otto Franz of Austria and Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony. As a child, Charles was raised as a devout Roman Catholic in the tradition of his family. He spent his childhood with his father's regiment and was privately educated and on the conclusion of his studies entered the army, serving as an officer in Prague.\n\nIn the years following he carried out his military duties in various Bohemian garrison towns. Charles's relations with his granduncle were not intimate, and so up to the time of the assassination of his uncle in 1914, he was not a figure into affairs of state. In 1911, Charles married Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma. Due to Franz Ferdinand's morganatic marriage, his children were excluded from the succession to the throne of Austria-Hungary. As a result, Charles was the second in line and expected to marry a noble of equal rank. Zita was both a devout Catholic and of a royal lineage of the House of Bourbon.\n\nCharles became heir after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in 1914, only at this time did the old Emperor take steps to initiate the heir-presumptive to the affairs of state. Charles spent his time during the first phase of the First World War at headquarters at Teschen, but exercised no military influence. Charles then became a Field Marshal and in the spring of 1916, in connection with the offensive against Italy, he was entrusted with the command of a Corps, whose affections the heir-presumptive to the throne won by his affability and friendliness. The offensive, after a successful start, soon came to a standstill. Shortly afterwards, Charles went to the eastern front as commander of an army operating against the Russians and Romanians.\n\nFranz Joseph I died of old age on 21 November 1916, Charles immediately ascended the throne and was crowned on the 30 December 1916 as Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary. In January 1917, Charles secretly entered into peace negotiations with France despite continued support of the German Empire on the front against Russia. through his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian Army.\n\nSurrender of Austria-Hungary[]\n\nDissolution of the Triple Alliance[]\n\nOn 22 February 1917 the Foreign Minister of France, Aristide Briand, sent the Briand Note, informing the Emperor that the Triple Entente would accept peace if he gave into at least their core demands including the federalisation of the Empire that was promised by Archduke Franz Ferdinand before his assassination. The next day a meeting was held in Salzburg between the Austrian Emperor and Kaiser Wilhelm II, where Charles announced the dissolution of the Triple Alliance and Austria's impending separate peace. After the meeting the two men became very distant and less than cordial.\n\nIn the following day Charles sent his Foreign Minister Ottokar Czernin to meet with his counterpart from Italy, Sidney Sonnino, and hopefully signs a peace treaty with Victor Emmanuel III. After agreeing to give South Tyrol with it's large Italian population over to the Italians, both sides agreed on peace. On 11 March Czernin and Sonnino signed a cease fire halting all hostilities despite the continued state of war between the countries. The final treaty was only signed of 27 April in Trieste and formally declare both the end of the state of war and the change of ownership of South Tyrol.\n\nWhen the United States joined the war against the German Empire on 6 April after three months of discussion in the wake of the Zimmermann Telegram, it did not declare war against Austria-Hungary. Meanwhile the Austrian army withdrew from the land that belonged to Romania before the war in preparation for the upcoming peace treaty with the nation. The Treaty of Bucharest was signed on the 18 April and while the Romanians were not given Transylvania yet as they had wished, it was determined that its position in the Empire would be discussed during the eventual peace conference. At the same time the German Empire was pushed back slightly in Belgium during the Nivelle Offensive, so the Kingdom of Bulgaria signed their own armistice two days later fearing defeat after Austria withdrew.\n\nPerhaps the most complicated peace treaty was with the country that had started it all by sending assassins to Sarajevo three year earlier. As part of the Treaty of Sarajevo signed on 13 May the lands of Bosnia-Herzegovina that were given to the Empire by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 were to remain a part of the Commonwealth with large autonomy. The Kingdom of Montenegro with was occupied in 1915 was restored as well after the Austrian Armistice was signed with them, the United Kingdom and France the same day.\n\nThe Commonwealth[]\n\nThe Imperial Council and the Diet of Hungary agreed that the fifth renegotiation of the original Ausgleich of 1867 on 15 May would federalise the Dual Monarchy into a Commonwealth of mostly independent nations in a personal union with Austria. The newly independent countries (Hungary, Bohemia, Galicia-Lodomeria, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) all got a minister-president as their head of government and were granted seats in the newly created Imperial Parliament. In reaction to the large scale defections of their army that was only accelerated by the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government requested to sign a more complete peace treaty called the Treaty of Lemberg so they were safe to move their army inland to insure order.\n\nAustria agreed to recognise the Provisional Government as the sovereign body of the Russian People's Republic and the sanctity of the borders of the Kingdom of Poland on the 17 May, with the Provisional Council of State declaring the latter's independence on the 20 May, following the signing of the German Armistice. When the German Empire surrendered it was agreed, that on the 1 July 1917, a conference would begin in Brussels, Belgium. The Brussels Peace Conference saw Ottokar Czernin once again representing the country, with Austria stating it would agree to minor secession of land in southern Hungary if the Romanians pressed the issue. Charles and Czernin supported partial return of Alsace-Lorraine to France, thus earning the hatred of then de facto military dictator of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg, who referred to them as backstabbing traitors on numerous occasions.\n\nPost-War Politics[]\n\nRussian Civil War[]\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, the empire kept to the Treaty of Lemberg and officially supported the Russian People's Republic in opposition of the Bolsheviks and the Restoration Faction. Though much like Norway, they attempted to remain neutral, only intervening when the enemies of Alexander Kerensky threatened their own or Polish sovereignty; earning the trust of Franciszek Radziwiłł, who had been elected their king in May 1917. The two nations defeated small Bolshevik militias in late July and early August 1917, however all of the battles were though on either Polish of Austrian soil.\n\nThe battles of their combined armies against the militias greatly weakened the armies on the western wing of the Civil War and so eased the pressure on Kornilov's army, who had time to deal with the Bolsheviks in White Ruthenia and the larger Restoration Faction in the south. Officially siding with the government in Moscow throughout the war, the last battles they took part in occurred in the Summer of 1918. They later signed the Peace of Ryazan on 24 March 1919 as one of the three supporters of Kerensky alongside Germany.\n\nEuropean Politics[]\n\nFollowing the abandonment of German Empire and their own involvement in the aforementioned Russian Civil War through the declaration of the Prussian Soviet Republic, the future of the relations between them and the Austrian Commonwealth was determined for decades to come. The dictatorship of Paul von Hindenburg held things peaceful at least as far as wars went, but that would not last. After Hindenburg retired in 1930, he was replaced Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who greatly expanded the nationalist policies of Germany, mostly after the ascension of Wilhelm III in 1934.\n\nWhile at first hoping that Benito Mussolini would aid his country, Charles soon realised he would likely align against him. After the March on Rome in 1922 the relations between Italy and Austria became very sour. Charles was a pious Catholic and supported Pope Pius XI on many occasions and was credited with aiding in the signing of the Lateran Treaty in 1928. While officially denouncing the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the Austrian Commonwealth didn't intervene.\n\nWhile both Germany and Italy supported the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War, the government of Austria refused to send expeditionary forces to fight against the Republicans. The two enemies of the Commonwealth however got closed and in 1937 the Venice Meeting led directly to the Italo-German Pact. After that both countries started bend the term of the Brussels Peace Conference more and more. Charles would however not live long enough to see the results.\n\nInternal Politics[]\n\nAs a pious Catholic, Charles was vocally opposed both Communism and the later De Leonism politics, with the latter spreading into the Austrian Commonwealth following the 1st Congress of Syndicates in 1920. With the reforms of the Socialist Democrats under the premiership of Karl Renner the socialist tendencies were kept under raps, but when the majority election system made the Christian Socialists led by Ignaz Seipel the ruling party, the unrest slowly boiled over.\n\nWhile the 2nd Congress of Syndicates in 1926 focused more on the Kingdom of Spain rather then the Austrian Commonwealth, but the support for a socialist restoration rose and eventually led to the Vienna Uprising in 1928, which the government attempted to crush by force. Charles was instead forced to accept Karl Renner back as prime minister after the demonstrators threatened to storm the Imperial Palace in Hofburg and various musing about declaring a republic were reported.\n\nThe government of Karl Renner would last until 1936, with their support almost doubling after many Christian Socialist got disillusioned with Ignaz Seipel, whom they hated for firing at his own people first and talking with them second. As time went on the Emperor was more and more sidetracked as his health deteriorated and after Richard Bernaschek took the premiership in 1936, he was rarely seen. When the 3rd Congress of Syndicates attempted to work with the Christian Socialist, the Emperor made his last public address denouncing the Congress as a bunch of anarchist atheist rebels, which they took as a sign they had done the right thing.\n\nThe death of Emperor Charles on 3 August 1940 was long expected and while many mourned his loss, many questioned the wisdom of continuing the semi-absolutist monarchy under Otto I. His son would eventually lead the Austrian Commonwealth through the Second World War with Richard Bernaschek as prime minister after his reelection in 1942. His wife Zita outlived him by several decades, dying in 1977.\n\nFamily and Succession[]\n\nCharles married Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma, a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, the cadet branches of the House of Capet. Through her parents she had the blood of the royal houses of France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Sardinia, Modena, Parma, Saxony and Poland and so this was considered a marriage of equals according to the house law of the Habsburg family. Unlike Franz Ferdinand's morganatic marriage, their children would be in the line of succession after Charles.\n\nThey were married on the 21 October 1911 and had nine children together, upon Charles's death the eldest became Emperor Otto I. His other children were styled Archdukes and Archduchesses since birth as per custom."
