        "text": "As you probably learned in school, the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo was an important event that led to the outbreak of the Great War, which is perhaps better known as World War I. The death of the archduke placed a certain Charles of Hapsburg as the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungary throne. Just two years later, when the Emperor Franz Joseph died, the twenty-nine-year-old Charles became Emperor of Austro-Hungary. Today, that certain Charles is now known as Blessed Charles of Austria.\n\nCharles was born in 1887 to Archduke Otto and Princess Maria Josephine of Saxony. The marriage of the archduke and the princess was not necessarily a good match, but they were committed to raising their children and preparing them to be successors to the the throne.\n\nCharles received a strong Catholic education which helped grow his devotion to the Holy Eucharist and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. His catechist was the Dominican Fr. Nobert Geggerle who described the young boy as, \"a very modest child, as pious as he could be, who loved the truth and had a tender conscience ... He was never angry, self-willed, self-righteous or quarrelsom; he didn't hold a grudge.\" Although initially privately taught, he took his high school classes at a Benedictine school in Vienna.\n\nWhen he was seventeen years of age, he entered the army. After a year of military training, he was made a lieutenant and was assigned to a cavalry regiment. Over the next several years, with the exception of four semesters spent studying law and political science in Prague, Charles served in the military. His assignments included being stationed in Bohemia, Galacia, and Vienna. By the age of twenty-seven, he had been promoted to colonel.\n\nAfter the death of Archduke Ferdinand which made Charles the heir to the Austro-Hungary throne, the Emperor Francis Joseph had Charles visit the troops at the various command posts and become familiar with the military high command. He led several campaigns in Italy and Romania which, although showing a good grasp of strategy and daring, were only somewhat successful.\n\nIn 1911, he married Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma. They had met when Charles was stationed in Bohemia and had been introduced by Charles' aunt. Over the course of several months, they fell in love and began to build a relationship which would be strong enough to see them through good times and bad times. Zita was a wonderful match for her husband. They shared a great love of Christ and His Church and were firmly committed to living the Gospel in their roles as husband and wife, parents, and royalty.\n\nDuring their marriage of ten years, they had eight children. As committed Catholics, they practiced marital fidelity, attended mass, obeyed the authority of the Church, especially in the pope, and had great devotion to the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThen on November 21, 1916, Emperor Franz Joseph, who had ruled for sixty-nine years, died. Subsequently, Charles became the emperor of the Austro-Hungary empire and commander-in-chief of all the military forces of the empire. He immediately began efforts to use his authority to foment social reform and peace. As Archduke Ferdinand had been, Charles was opposed to the war. Charles had seen the horrors of modern warfare firsthand, and he was committed to bringing peace as soon as possible.\n\nWhen Pope Benedict XV proposed a peace plan, Charles I was the only European leader to support it. Charles I also began secret peace talks with the French that broke down with disagreements regarding the recognition of certain territories in Italy.\n\n‚úâÔ∏è One fascinating snail mail letter per week\n\nüòá Real letters written by saints such as St. John of the Cross, St. Joan of Arc, St. Francis of Assisi, and St. Gemma Galgani\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes that provide background information on the letter, the saint, and faith lessons\n\nüì™ A letter in your mailbox that you look forward to receiving\n\nüñÉ Printed on parchment paper and sent with a real stamp\n\nüéÅ Also makes for a fun and unique gift\n\nAt the end of the war, Charles I proclaimed that the peoples of Austria and Hungary could determine what government they should have. He stopped short of abdication with the hope that the people might want the monarchy to be part of the new government. Eventually, the Austrian parliament exiled him and he relocated to Switzerland. With the loss of his throne, his income, and his country, he had been brought to a very low point indeed. Yet, both Charles and Zita continued to trust in God and in each other.\n\nEventually, he traveled with his family to Portugal where he died of pneumonia at the age of thirty-four. Shortly before his death, he prayed to commend his wife and all his children, including the one who would be born after his death, to the Lord. The last words he whispered to his wife were: \"I love you endlessly.\""
