        "text": "A marriage has been planned between\n\nthe young Archduke Charles Francis\n\nJoseph of Austria and the Princess Zita\n\nof Bourbon-Parma, the possible results\n\nof which are terrible to contemplate.\n\nThe young Archduke is the son of the\n\nhalf insane madcap Archduke Otto, who\n\ndied five years ago. He in turn was the\n\nsou of the old Emperor Francis Joseph's\n\nbrother, Archduke Charles Louis, who\n\nwas declared \"mentally irresponsible\"\n\nby the Vienna courts.\n\nThe Princess Zita is the twelfth of the\n\n20 children of the late Dnke Robert of\n\nBourbon-Parma, 16 of whom are imbe-\n\ncile.\n\nThe contemplated marriage is of great\n\npublic importance because the bride\n\ngroom, Archduke Charles, is .the prospec-\n\ntive heir to the throne of Austria\n\nHungary. His uncle, actual heir.\n\nArchduke Francis Ferdinand, has made\n\na morganatic marriage, the children of\n\nwhich cannot inherit the throne. And\n\nso, after him, the succession passes to\n\nhis nephew, to the young Archduke\n\nCharles.\n\nThe Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma\n\nbelongs to a branch of the Spanish Bour\n\nbon dynasty thai intermarried with, the\n\nHaps bergs, the Imperial family .of Aus\n\ntria,. in the eighteenth centafy, and ac\n\nquired the Italian, doehy of Parma. The\n\nBourbon-Parmas were, tamed out of their\n\nItalian possessions by the United Italy\n\nmovement, and oow make their home in\n\nAustria\n\nIt seems thai the unhappy Bourbon\n\nParmas have united in the present gene\n\nration all the\" notorious \"mental defect®\n\nof the ancient Hapshnrg and Bourbon\n\nfamilies, from whom they are descended\n\nthrough centaries of intermarriage. Ac\n\ncording to ~ all the teachings of medical\n\nscience Oie union of two ■persons closely\n\nrelated for many, generations, and hav\n\ning in their immediate and remote an\n\ncestry many cases of immrri*y,is very\n\nlikely to result in insane or\" mentally\n\ndefective offspring. 4'\n\nIt had been, planned .to celebrate the\n\nmarriage early in October, and .fee sceoe\n\nof tfee ceremony—of all places—is to be\n\nSehwarzan, the castle.. oftheJEkrarbon\n\nPamias, in Atistria. * 1..\n\nNever in the world, probably, has there\n\nbeen a more pitiful, yet ludicron^, tra\n\n[ gedy than the iuUaiui ofSehwazraa pre\n\nsents. . It. is an rarpretentioup . though\n\nvery extensive country bouse, some t^O\n\nhours by rail from -\"Vienna, tbi 'Residence\n\nfor the last 15 years or more of the .ducal\n\nfamily of Bran. Foot years - ago^ flic\n\nlast sane Duke of Parma, Eoberi bjr\n\nname, died , there. •'■• j\n\nAt this\" bead of the nnbasppy pwioteakm\n\nof IS \"imbecile royal princes comes Henry,\n\nhead of the family, designated in offioiaT\n\nlanguage. as \"His Boyal Highness fee\n\nI>ake of Parma.\" ' Henry is 38 years of\n\nage, and developed insanity so' eaiiy .in\n\n'life that none of trig relatives, empertAS,\n\nkings, and archdukes. invested him wtfli\n\na military tfiie, or evan ..a royal decora\n\ntkra. He \"is the ddest of; the eight chil\n\ndren borne by the Dnfee*S first wife, Prin\n\ncess Maria Pin of Boarbon-Sieily, a\n\ncousin.\n\nAfter Henry the taint of Tiimmnji made\n\nvictims of the six next children of the\n\nroyal couple, five grris and a bo^. ®ien\n\nit allowed ti»e birth of a child perfect\n\nin mind and body, the present Prince\n\nHelie of Parma, who married the Arch\n\nduchess Aetna Maria of Austria. The\n\nunion was a happy one. Prince Helie\n\nis captain of the 6th Dragoons of the\n\nAustrian Army. They have four chil\n\ndren, Princes Carl and Bobert and Prin\n\ncesses Elizabeth, and Msria,/he£ljthy boys\n\nand gilis.\n\nWith Prince He3ie terminated the\n\nDuchess Pia's career as a moflaer. She\n\ndied in 1832, happy to have blessed 'her\n\nhiisband with one perfect\" child. Bxrt\n\nthe curse of 'insanity . appeared again\n\nwhen Bobert took his second wife, the\n\npresent\" Dowager Daehess of Parma, An\n\ntonia, the youngest of the ax famous\n\nBragaaza princesses, and stmt to HBgcel\n\nBragama.\n\nThe first daughter she \"bore to her cou\n\nsin and husband, the Princess Adelaide,\n\nwas insane at her birth. At the age of\n\n20 she enjoyed' a short period of sanity,\n\nand realising .the. tenilile affliction her\n\nbrothers ana. sisters were suffering \"from\n\nshe entered holy ozders.\n\nTwo boys, Sixtas and Xavier, and a\n\ndaughter, Fraocisfca, who, in\" the cata\n\nlogue of Duke Robert's offspring, bear\n\nthe numbers nine, ten, and eleven, were\n\nlikewise born insane. . Then occurred a\n\nsecond happy, interval of sanity. t)n\n\nMay 9, 1892, Princess Zita. saw.the\n\nat the .royal yilla ofJPiaoore, Italy. Zita\n\nproved, as healthy in Tnindand body as\n\nher step-brother Helie. She is a fine\n\ngirl -physically.\n\n- There were seven ■ ehflctren after Zita,\n\nthree girls and four boys. . None of thetn,\n\nit is asserted, ever enjoyed a moment's\n\nperfect sanity.\n\nThe fact that of nine princes of the\n\nhouse of Parma .only one holds a mili\n\ntary commission, ajid 'that ■■ of the 11\n\nprincesses not one has been honored by\n\nthe customary decorations by their royal\n\nrelatives, shows the deplorable --cobdltion\n\ninto whieh the family has .tank in the\n\nestimation of the other royal families.\n\nBat these poor princes and princesses\n\nhave helped themselves to titles. Duke\n\nHenry numm*.*! the dignity of\n\n\"Grand Prince of the Storks,\" and his\n\noldest sister, Princess Louise, calls her\n\nself \"Empress Hieodora.\"\n\nPriaoess Maria Izranacolata mmpwa\n\nherself. to be Qoeeo Marie Antoinette,\n\nand is, not happy mrisss allowed to bug\n\nacabtrage which she thinks is her own\n\nbead cut off by her subjects. On the\n\ncabbage she lavishes all the affection she\n\nis capable of feeling, coddling and deco\n\nrating it, and talking for hours to it.\n\nEveryone of the crazed princes and prin\n\ncesses has some special foible or abnor\n\nmality\n\nIt would be impossible to chronicle all\n\nthe madmen of the Hapsbnrg and Bour\n\nbon families. Among the distant ances\n\ntry of this couple are Pedro the Cruel of\n\nSpain: King Pedro I. of Portugal, who\n\nresurrected his murdered wife, Inez de\n\nCastro, and sat her beside hi™ cm the\n\nthrone; mad Queen Joanna; and a score\n\nof others.\n\nThe family marks of degeneracy are\n\nto be traced in the peculiar facial for\n\nmation of King Alfonso of Spain, and in\n\nthe defect of throat and ears which has\n\ncaused his second son.
