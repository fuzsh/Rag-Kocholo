        "text": "Princess Marie-Françoise Antoinette Jeanne Madeleine of Bourbon-Parma, known upon her marriage as Princess Edouard de Lobkowicz (French: Marie-Françoise de Bourbon-Parme; born 19 August 1928) is a French humanitarian and philanthropist. A princess of the House of Bourbon-Parma by birth and the House of Lobkowicz by marriage, her wedding in 1960 was the first Bourbon wedding to take place at Notre-Dame de Paris since the wedding of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry to Princess Caroline of Naples and Sicily in 1816 during the Bourbon Restoration.\n\nAfter escaping the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 with the assistance of Catholic Relief Services, Marie-Françoise helped settle refugees in West Berlin who fled the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, while her husband, Prince Edouard de Lobkowicz, was serving as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta's ambassador to Lebanon, she was involved in the construction and development of twelve medical and social centers owned by the Order. Princess Marie-Françoise founded the Malte Liban Association, a Catholic organization that raises money for medical clinics serving the poor in Lebanon, in 1987. She served as a delegate of the United Nations from 1990 to 1995."
