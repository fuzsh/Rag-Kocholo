        "text": "DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Sotheby’s in Geneva sold a hundred lots of jewelry from the House of Bourbon-Parma, including impeccable pieces with eye-popping royal provenance. Here’s a look at the ten highest-grossing lots from the sale!\n\nSotheby’s\n\n10. Archduchess Maria Anna’s Sapphire Cluster Brooch: This lovely brooch features a 30-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by twelve brilliants, in a classic design that echoes the famous Albert Brooch from the British royal collection. This brooch is newer, made around 1900 and given by Princess Isabella of Croy to Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria when she married Prince Elias, Duke of Parma in 1903. The brooch sold for $551,010.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n9. Archduchess Maria Anna’s Fancy Orangy Pink Diamond Ring: This classic cluster ring features an unusual 2.44-carat fancy orangy pink diamond framed by additional colorless diamonds. The ring was given to Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (wife of Prince Elias, Duke of Parma) by her father, Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen in 1909. The gift was a celebration of the birth of Maria Anna’s second son, Prince Robert. The ring sold for $574,837.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n8. Princess Maria Teresa’s Diamond Girandole Earrings: This spectacular pair of diamond pendant earrings were made in the first half of the nineteenth-century. They originally belonged to Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy, the wife of Charles II, Duke of Parma, and were later inherited by her grandson, Robert I, Duke of Parma. The earrings sold for $729,715.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n7. The Bourbon-Parma Diamond Demi-Parure: This incredible diamond demi-parure consists of a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a brooch. The suite contains diamonds owned by several members of the Bourbon-Parma family, including Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (son of King Charles X of France), the Duchess of Angouleme (daughter of Queen Marie Antoinette), and Princess Isabella of Croy (mother of Archduchess Maria Anna, Duchess of Parma). The demi-parure sold for $848,853.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n6. Archduchess Maria Anna’s Fleur-de-Lis Tiara: We featured this bold fleur-de-lis tiara recently here at The Court Jeweller. It was made in 1912 for Archduchess Maria Anna (wife of Prince Elias, Duke of Parma) by an Austrian jeweler, Hübner. The tiara sold for $967,990.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n5. The Duke of Angouleme’s Order of the Saint-Esprit: This diamond, emerald, and ruby badge of the French Order of the Saint-Esprit was made around 1820 for the Duke of Angouleme (son of King Charles X of France). The badge sold for $1,623,244.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n4. The Duke of Angouleme’s Order of the Golden Fleece: This elaborate diamond, sapphire, and ruby ornament is the neck badge of the Order of the Golden Fleece. The badge was made around 1820. It sold for $1,682,813.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n3. Marie Antoinette’s Diamond Bow Brooch: This 18th century diamond bow brooch features a large pear-shaped yellow diamond pendant. The bow brooch belonged to Queen Marie Antoinette of France; the yellow diamond was a later addition. The brooch sold for $2,099,793.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n2. Queen Marie Antoinette’s Pearls: This three-stranded pearl necklace is strung with pearls that belonged to Marie Antoinette. (We featured her pearl parure here.) The necklace sold for $2,278,499.\n\nSotheby’s\n\n1. Marie Antoinette’s Diamond and Pearl Pendant: This astonishing diamond and pearl pendant was a part of Marie Antoinette’s collection (in a different form — see more here). This was the absolute whopper of the sale. The top range of its pre-sale estimate was just under two million dollars. When the hammer fell on Wednesday, this pendant sold for a breathtaking $36,165,090.\n\nDANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe print and online catalogues for next week’s landmark Bourbon-Parma jewelry auction are officially up, and we’ve finally got more information on a set of jewels I’ve been very curious about: the pearl suite that belonged to Marie Antoinette.\n\nMarie Antoinette in pearls, painted ca. 1790 by Alexander Kucharsky (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMarie Antoinette was often painted with pearls, and her collection included some remarkable pearl pieces. After her execution, the pearls we’re discussing today were inherited by her daughter, Marie Therese. Known as “Madame Royale” from birth, Marie Therese became the Duchess of Angouleme when she married a cousin, Prince Louis Antoine, in 1799. The couple were technically King and Queen of France, in a reign that lasted a whole twenty minutes — the period of time after Louis Antoine’s father, King Charles X, signed his abdication papers and before Louis Antoine subsequently also signed the abdication document.\n\nPrincess Louise, Duchess of Parma wears the pearl necklace and pendant in a portrait by Prosper Raffi, ca. 1849 (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMarie Therese did not have any children of her own, but she did have a niece and a nephew, the children of Louis Antoine’s brother, the Duke of Berry. Her niece, Princess Louise, married the Duke of Parma; she’s the one who inherited the pearl suite, which remained with her descendants until this year. Look closely at the portrait above, and you’ll see Marie Antoinette’s pearl necklace and pendant around Louise’s own neck.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nTwo generations later, the pearl suite was recorded in a jewelry inventory compiled by Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, the wife of Louise’s grandson, Prince Elias, Duke of Parma. She noted that the “grande parure de perles” that belonged to Marie Antoinette included a necklace with three rows of round pearls, with a pearl pendant suspended from a diamond bow, and fastened by a a diamond clasp. The necklace as described by Maria Anna is pictured above.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nMaria Anna also listed a pair of pearl earrings as part of the suite (“deux boucles d’oreilles, boutons et poires en perles”). The earrings feature pearl studs from which large brilliants and pearl drops are suspended.\n\nDANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe pearl necklace has undergone some renovations since the inventory was created, but now, the pearls from this suite are all being sold in the upcoming auction at Sotheby’s, divided into four separate lots.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nLot 97, which is estimated to sell for between $202,350 and $303,525, includes 119 of the 161 pearls from the original necklace. That original necklace was restrung as a sautoir in the early 20th century, and then restrung again into this three-row necklace, which features a large diamond clasp, and a separate single-stranded necklace.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nLot 98 is that single-stranded necklace, which is estimated to sell for between $40,470 and $70,823. It features 40 pearls and a detachable diamond clasp. The lot notes indicate that 39 of the pearls are natural saltwater and one is cultured.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nThe earrings from the parure are presented as lot 99 in the auction, and they’re estimated to bring between $202,350 and $303,525. The earrings are described as follows in the lot notes: “Each surmount set with a button shaped natural pearl measuring approximately 12.65 x 12.95 x 15.60mm and 12.95 x 13.10 x 16.00mm respectively, the reverse set with rose diamonds, supporting a detachable pendant set with an oval natural pearl measuring approximately 10.25 x 10.50 x 8.55mm and 10.15 x 10.20 x 7.70mm respectively, capped with rose diamonds, and a pinched collet-set cushion-shaped diamond.” The notes also indicate that the earrings feature “early 19th century, hook and hinged back fittings,” which naturally would have been added after Marie Antoinette’s death.\n\nSotheby’s\n\nThe final and perhaps grandest part of Marie Antoinette’s pearl parure, the large pendant featuring a diamond brilliant, a diamond bow, and a pear-shaped pearl, is lot 100. It’s the whopper of the sale, estimated to bring between one and two million dollars. You’ll note that the oval-shaped diamond at the top of the pendant was originally the clasp in Marie Antoinette’s necklace. The lot notes indicate that the pearl has been tested and is indeed a natural saltwater pearl.\n\nRead more of our posts on the Bourbon-Parma jewel auction:\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe magnificent jewelry collection of the Bourbon-Parma family, which will be auctioned at Sotheby’s in Geneva in a few weeks, has made it to America. Selected pieces are currently on display at the auction house in New York, and, as you may have expected, the links to Marie Antoinette are being very heavily advertised.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWe still don’t have complete catalogue or lot information for the sale, but we know that some of the jewels included do appear to have genuinely been owned by Marie Antoinette. Her picture was displayed prominently alongside the jewels when they were photographed by the press on Friday. You can read details on ten of the lots now at the Sotheby’s website.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nTwo pearl necklaces from the sale were among the pieces displayed. The necklace on the left, a late nineteenth-century piece with an elaborate diamond clasp, is one of the pieces with available lot information. The necklace on the right is described as a “natural pearl and diamond necklace” in the label provided during this exhibition. Both necklaces are said to include pearls that belonged to Marie Antoinette and were later restrung by members of the Bourbon-Parma family.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThis exceptional eighteenth-century diamond and pearl pendant is directly said to have come from Marie Antoinette in the provided lot notes.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nSotheby’s states that the incredible baroque pearl pendant has been tested and is a natural, saltwater pearl.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLot notes are not yet available for this magnificent diamond bow brooch.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe label from the exhibition, however, simply describes it as a “diamond brooch” made in the “second half of [the] 18th century.” The piece’s auction estimate is set at $50,000-80,000 USD. The piece was displayed beside a simpler diamond bow brooch (visible in the last photograph in this post). That brooch, which dates to the late 19th century, has an auction estimate of $95,000-140,000 USD.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe necklace, earrings, and brooch in this photograph make up the “superb diamond parure” being auctioned in November. We do have lot notes for this one. The necklace was made using diamonds previously set on a sword that belonged to Prince Charles Ferdinand d’Artois, Duke de Berry (1778-1820).\n\nFive of the diamonds set in the earrings and brooch (according to the lot notes, “the ones on the earrings, the central diamond on the brooch and the two remaining pendants on the brooch”) were once included in an “important tiara” that belonged to Marie Antoinette’s daughter, the Duchess of Angoulême. The lot notes state that the silver and gold frame from that tiara was auctioned at Sotheby’s as Lot 82 from the Dimitri Mavrommatis Collection; the lot also included a portrait of the Duchess wearing the tiara.\n\nIn the foreground of this photograph, you’ll see two rings. The label from this exhibition describes them as “two diamond and woven hair rings,” accompanied by an additional “diamond and woven hair jewel,” dating to the “18th century and early 19th century.” The trio of pieces has an auction estimate of $20,000-50,000 USD.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWe don’t yet have lot notes for the outstanding fleur-de-lis tiara included in the exhibition, but thanks to the Instagram account of jewelry historian Vincent Meylan, we know a little bit about it. The tiara was made in 1912 for Archduchess Maria of Austria, wife of Prince Elias, Duke of Parma. Meylan notes that the three large fleur-de-lis ornaments can be detached and worn as brooches.
