        "text": "In times of war, it oftentimes takes a very great and courageous man to stand for peace. People have a bad tendency of getting swept up in war fervor and bloodlust and forget that, as Chesterton wrote, “the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.” This ends up with states fighting for open-ended and unclear goals outside of national interest and these conflicts (even when started for understandable reasons) usually end up contrary to both natural law and just war theory. World War I was, to some extent, a good example of such a conflict. From seen from the position of most of the countries, it is understandable why they entered the war, after all the Austrians wanted to stop the Black Hand, the Russians wanted to protect the Slavs, and the British wanted to stop the “Rape of Belgium.” However, all of these countries blundered into a war without clear, tangible, and accomplishable aims that could have been resolved diplomatically. This conflict, which was a lot more destructive than any today, was the one that Bl. Charles (Karl) inherited when he came to the Austro-Hungarian throne in 1916, two years after the start of the conflict.\n\nThough Charles was born into the Imperial House of Habsburg, Charles lived all but an easy life, as tragedy after tragedy befell the ancient dynasty and the world. In fact, he only became Emperor through tragedy. When he was born in 1887, it was unlikely that he would ever ascend to the throne. He was fourth in line to the throne, behind the then-emperor (Franz Jozef)’s son Crown Prince Rudolf, his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his father. The first major tragedy in his life struck when Rudolf died in either a murder or suicide (his death has been described as the “JFK assassination of the 19th Century” and is still mysterious), and this death traumatized the Imperial Family. Furthermore, Blessed Charles’s parents were an awful match for each other. His father, Archduke Otto was quite charismatic but also a womanizer while his mother, Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony, was very pious but a very dower woman, and the two spent little time together. However, none of this deterred Charles from his education as he was captivated by others around him and the Catholic Faith. Providentially, Charles inherited the best traits of both of his parents, as he had his father’s charisma and natural leadership skills and his mother’s piety and solemnity. Furthermore, the shortcomings of his father greatly impacted him, particularly as his father died young of syphilis, and Charles’s family life represents one that we should all try to replicate. When he married his wife, Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma, he said that they must “help each other go to heaven,” and they both bolstered each other’s piety. Bl. Charles’s family life provides another antidote to many of our problems today.\n\nAfter his uncle, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Sarajevo in 1914 (the event that led to the July Crisis and World War I), Charles became the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and this only bolstered his sense of duty. Before the death of Emperor Franz-Jozef, Bl. Charles personally led soldiers from the frontline, and this experience further bolstered his desire for peace, with him writing to Zita that though he was an officer, he did not see how anyone could enjoy war. Thus, Bl. Charles viewed his service as a soldier and officer and his advocacy for peace as one in the same, as both were expressions of his duty to his people, putting even his life on the line so that his people could live in peace. Upon becoming Emperor, he immediately started working for peace through both the Pope and his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma (who was in the Belgian Army). This attempt failed as the French leaked the attempt to embarrass Charles, and he was derided as a Pacifist by both Clemenceau and the General Staff of the German Empire. Furthermore, as Emperor, Charles had the Imperial family live on the same rations as everyone else (to share in the privations of his people), and he created the first department of social welfare in the world to protect workers.\n\nUltimately, when the Central Powers lost the war, Bl. Charles was forced to leave the country and he went into exile in Switzerland, though he refused to abdicate, arguing that doing so would be an abandonment of his duties. However, in 1919 he went back to assume the throne of Hungary (where he was coronated in 1916), to where he was invited by the supposedly supportive Regent, Miklos Horthy. However, when Charles arrived, the Regent, Horthy (who would later collaborate with the Axis), told him to go back to Switzerland, though told him that he would later be restored. However, when back in Switzerland, Charles realized that Horthy had lied to him and had no intention of a restoration, and thus Charles publicly to Hungary that Horthy would have to recognize him. When he did return to Hungary, thousands flocked to him and he could have retaken the country from Horthy. However, Horthy refused to stand down, and Charles thus abandoned the plan as he did not want to cause a civil war, as he thought that such a conflict would go contrary to his coronation oaths. Thus, he was exiled again, this time to the Portuguese island of Madeira, where he died in 1922 at the young age of 34, because of the poor living conditions that he had there. Charles, however, bore both his exile, illness, and death as suffering done for his people, and he united his sufferings to those of Christ, stating “I must suffer like this so my people will come together again.”\n\nBut why is Blessed Charles important today? For many reasons. First of all, he provides a great example for young men, especially today in a world where leadership has been replaced with celebrity and piety has been replaced by materialism. Secondly, as a devoted father (of eight children) and husband, his family life exemplifies the Christian ideals of fatherhood and marriage (his wife, Zita, also has an open cause for canonization and has been declared a “Servant of God”), and this makes him all the better of an example when juxtaposed against the current culture’s hostility to marriage and the family. Charles’s witness also inspired many of the other great saints of the last century. St. John Paul II (Karol Wojtyla) was named after Charles by his father, who as a soldier in the Austrian Army had met the Emperor. Furthermore, Empress Zita’s death served as the catalyst for his son, Crown Prince Otto, to organize a picnic on the Austrian and Hungarian borders, an event that played a major role in the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Though Bl. Charles may have failed in his political goals of creating peace in 1916, governing Austria, and maintaining his throne, but his example allows us to improve the world in our day and age, whether it be through promoting peace, justice, or the family."
