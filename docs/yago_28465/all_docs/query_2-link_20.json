        "text": "Imperial and Royal Highness Archduchess Gabriella of Austria will reportedly marry her fiancé HRH Prince Henri of Bourbon-Parma this September. Henri asked 26-year-old Gabriella to tie the knot on October 22 2017, just a week before the birth of their daughter Victoria Antonia Marie-Astrid Lydia.\n\nAfter they maintained a long-distance relationship while Henri was studying law in Copenhagen, the couple settled down in Switzerland.\n\nHenri and Gabriella are second cousins as they are both great-grandchildren of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg and her husband Prince Félix.\n\nBut Gabriella's side of the family also has an interesting link with the British Royal Family.\n\nHer mother, Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg, is the elder daughter and eldest child of Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg and Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium.\n\nThis made her one of the few remaining princesses from European reigning houses - and considered by match-makers an ideal candidate for marriage to Charles, the Prince of Wales.\n\nReports flurried about the prospects of such a marriage between two royal households in the 1970s.\n\nAt the beginning of that decade, Prince Charles had already met Camilla Parker Bowles, who in 2005 would become his second wife.\n\nREAD MORE: Sophie Wessex 'proud' to teach Lady Louise royal ways - expert\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
