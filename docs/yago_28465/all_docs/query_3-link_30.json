        "text": "The great and the glamorous of French society were out in force last month, as Princess Charlotte de Bourbon-Parma tied the knot with her handsome diplomat beau, Javier Valladares Urruela. The blushing bride continued a royal tradition by donning a tiara for her nuptials, choosing one worn by her mother, Baroness Constance de Ravinel, on her own wedding day in 1991. The diamond headpiece is in the Meander style, also known as the Greek style, for its similarity to Grecian artworks.\n\nThe wedding took place on 25 June at Saint-Aubin church in the picturesque village of Tourouvre au Perche in Normandy, with the bride choosing a princess-style white gown with puff-sleeves, full skirt and sweetheart-neckline. As well as her tiara, she also wore delicate pearl earrings, keeping her beauty look classic and simple, with an elegant low bun and natural make-up. The civil ceremony took place in the town hall of the same village a week earlier, with the bride wearing a chic floral Zimmermann mini-dress in yellow, accessorising with a matching hat.\n\nPrincess Charlotte is the daughter of Prince Charles-Emmanuel of Bourbon-Parma, whose father, Prince Michael, was a famous racing car driver in his day. She is related to the royal households of Denmark and Romania on her father's side, while her mother's family are French nobility dating back to the 15th century. She is one of four children, with two sisters, Princesses Elisabeth and Zita. Her brother, Prince Amaury of Bourbon-Parma, recently made headlines after running for political office. In 2011, she made her debut alongside fellow European aristocracy at the Bal des Debutantes in Paris, wearing Versace."
