As such, she was the last Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, in addition to other titles. She married Karl in 1911 and they had 8 children before his early death in 1922 of respiratory failure. Zita and Karl had a beautiful loving Catholic marriage and were inseparable during their lifetime. She never remarried and wore black in mourning for her remaining 67 years. In keeping with their devotion to each other and their faith in the Holy Mother of God, the hearts of Karl and his Zita are interred in the Marian chapel to Our Lady of Loreto in Muri Abbey, Switzerland.\n\nSign up to get the latest on sales, new releases and more…\n\n© 2024 Portraits of Saints.
