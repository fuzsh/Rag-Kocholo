As the daughter of the king, she was a Daughter of France (fille de France). She married Infante Philip, younger son of Philip V of Spain, and later became Duchess of Parma. In secondary sources she is referred to also as \"Louise Élisabeth of France\".\n\nHer prospective engagement to the Infante Philip of Spain was announced at court in February 1739, when she was eleven years old. Philip was the third son of Louis XV's uncle, Philip V d'Anjou, King of Spain, and of his second wife, Elizabeth of Parma. Through his mother, he inherited the Duchy of Parma and with his wife founded the House of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nThis engagement followed a tradition dating back to 1559 of cementing military and political alliances between the Catholic powers of France and Spain with royal marriages. Despite this and the fact that Philip was her father's first cousin, the announcement of the marriage agreement was not well received at the French court, as there was little chance that Philip would become King of Spain.\n\nThe twelve-year-old Élisabeth was married by proxy on 26 August 1739, not having met her future husband beforehand. Afterwards, she was known as Madame Infante at the court of Louis XV.\n\nShe met her nineteen-year-old husband some thirty kilometers northeast of Madrid, at Alcalá de Henares, where the marriage ceremony took place on 25 October 1739.\n\nÉlisabeth returned to France again in September 1757, to arrange the marriage of her daughter Isabella to the Archduke Joseph of Austria, the future Emperor Joseph II, which took place in 1760.\n\nKing Ferdinand VI of Spain died without an heir in August 1759 and was succeeded by his younger (and Philip's older) brother Carlos, who became Charles III of Spain.\n\nÉlisabeth fell ill while she was at Versailles, and died of smallpox on 6 December 1759 and was buried on 27 March 1760 at Saint-Denis Basilica beside her twin, Henriette. Their tombs were desecrated in 1793, during the French Revolution.[1]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Louise_Élisabeth_of_France\n\nSanger, Ernest, Isabelle de Bourbon-Parme: la Princesse et la Mort, Racine, Brussels, 2002.\n\nZieliński, Ryszard, Polka na francuskim tronie Czytelnik, 1978.\n\nLouise Élisabeth of France on Find A Grave: Memorial #84602185 Retrieved Sälgö-1 06:49, 19 January 2017 (EST).\n\nSee also:\n\nThis WikiTree profile is referenced from Wikidata: Item Q230868, en:Wikipedia"
