        "text": "Full name: Jaime Bernardo\n\nTitle: Prince de Bourbon de Parme, Count of Bardi (His Royal Highness)\n\nBorn: St. Radboud Hospital, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, October 13th, 1972\n\nParents: Charles Hugues Prince of Bourbon, Duke of Parme and Piacenza (1930) and 1964 (div. 1981) Irene Princess of the Netherlands (1939)\n\nBrother: Carlos (1970)\n\nSisters: Margarita (1972, married) and Carolina (1974)\n\nEducation and work: primary school in Paris and Madrid; International School, Amsterdam; Brown University, Rhode's Island, USA - international affairs; Rhode's Island School of Design - interior decoration; trainees for the World Wildlife Fund and the Red Cross; ABN Amro bank, São Paulo, Brazil (-2002); works at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Hague, The Netherlands (2002-).\n\nPersonality: openhearted and spontaneous.\n\nHobbies: painting, drawing, travelling, sailing, cycling, walking and swimming.\n\nJaime de Bourbon Parme\n\nDoes somebody know where Jaime lives in Holland and where he goes out for dinner or parties?\n\nWe are writing an article about him, but we can't find anytime about him only where he was born and stuff like that.\n\nPlease somebody help me?!\n\nKind regards,\n\nRoos\n\nI guess he live in The Hague. He works for the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nI see in your profile that you are from the Netherlands, so I hope you speak Dutch Here are some (Dutch) sites with more information about Jaime.\n\n- http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_de_Bourbon_de_Parme\n\n- http://www.jaime.web-log.nl/\n\nFor even more information you can maybe better contact himself\n\nFor that, go to: http://www.minbuza.nl/default.asp?search=yes&searchstring=Jaime&collection=0&period=0&language=0&CMS_ITEM=2089C42A52714485A90A6735A5087692X2X62191X76\n\nSorry, I have no more information about him. Maybe someone else, here on the forum?\n\nYou can find here pictures of Jaime: http://www.petersmulders.nl\n\nTRF has also a Jaime-thread: http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/showthread.php?t=401&highlight=jaime+bourbon\n\nThis thread has now been cleaned up.\n\nAny recent pictures of Prince Jaime? Or any news on him? What does he do and where does he live?\n\njoachim_l said:\n\nThere is a rumour about Prince Jaime being homosexual, it's the first time I heard that\n\nYes, the rumour that Prince Jaime is gay has been bandied about. But since it is \"rumour\" and he is unlikey to tells us, there's nothing much more to add.\n\n.\n\nHRH Prince Jaime de Bourbon-Parma attended the Remembrance Ceremony at the Dachau Monument,Amsterdam,this afternoon.\n\nHis grandfather,Prince Xavier de Bourbon-Parma,brother to the Empress Zita,was imprisoned at this concentrationcamp by\n\nthe nazi's during WW II.\n\nThe camp was liberated by the american Rainbow Division on april 29th 1945.Every year one of the Bourbon-Parma siblings\n\nattends the Memorial.\n\n[DNF] Fotoarchief Denieuwsfoto\n\nDoes anyone know who is the girl with Prince Jaime of Bourbon-Parma?\n\nShe escorted the prince earlier to an event too. It is said that she is his girlfriend. Her name is Paulette Alexandra van Ommen btw. Some more info about her professional life:\n\nhttp://www.bidnetwork.org/person/42428/en\n\nhttp://nl.linkedin.com/pub/paulette-van-ommen/14/661/347\n\nShe escorted the prince earlier to an event too. It is said that she is his girlfriend. Her name is Paulette Alexandra van Ommen btw. Some more info about her professional life:\n\nBiD Network - Paulette van Ommen\n\nPaulette van Ommen - LinkedIn\n\nThank you Marengo for the informations! This is the first time I see her with Jaime.\n\nI'm wondering...at the last Dutch Royal Christening at Het Loo Palace I saw for the first time the girlfriend of Prince Carlos, and after some time they got engaged and they're going to marry; will this happen with Jaime and Paulette as well?\n\nThank you Marengo for the informations! This is the first time I see her with Jaime.\n\nI'm wondering...at the last Dutch Royal Christening at Het Loo Palace I saw for the first time the girlfriend of Prince Carlos, and after some time they got engaged and they're going to marry; will this happen with Jaime and Paulette as well?\n\nShe was (I believe) present at the wedding of Bernardo Guillermo and Eva, and the 40th birthday party of Prince Maurits. I hope you are correct.\n\nJosette\n\nLike 2 years ago Prince Jaime visited the Dachau-monument again.\n\nPrince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, son of Dutch princess Irene, puts\n\na flower in the hedge of the Dachau-monument in Amsterdam, on April\n\n24, 2010. The prince attended the yearly ceremony to commemorate\n\nthe liberation of the camp by US troops in 1945 along with former Dachau\n\nprisoners.\n\n** Pic 1 ** Pic 2 ** belga **\n\nPrince Jaime attended the Queens Day concert in Noordeinde Palace, earlier this week. Other royals attending were HM the Queen, princess Maxima and princess Christina. The concert will be broadcasted tonight on Nederland 2.\n\nThe concert was also attended by Prince Carlos and his fiancé Annemarie Gualthérie van Weezel.\n\nSo she is only 24? And he 38...hmm, big age difference.\n\nVisibly both brothers like women much younger than them.\n\nLove doesn't do ages,\n\nunless it's the wrong choice,then it's aging.Jaime doesn't look older then\n\n30 tho.He really does,a handsome lad.\n\nLove doesn't do ages,\n\nOf course it doesn't but whether it is the love of their life or not, the time will show (i.e. if their union ends with marriage)\n\nThey've been together for only two years.\n\nJaime is already in such an age that he would probably like to become a father... Is Paulette sufficiently mature to maternity?\n\nUnion with big age difference requires much more efforts & sucrifices from both sides than that of people in the same age.\n\nAccording to Blauw Bloed, prince Jaime attended the 63rd birthday of the international student association of the university of Groningen. The prince was a guest speaker during the so-called 'Dies Natalis'. His lecture was about the conflict between humanitarian intervention and national souverenity.\n\nThe prince works for the ministairy of Foreign Affairs in The Hague."
