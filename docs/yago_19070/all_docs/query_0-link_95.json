        "text": "The modest city of Toledo was founded on the northern edge of the state of Ohio, in a strip of land that nearly provoked a border war between Ohio and Michigan. Over the years, it grew to become a midsized industrial powerhouse, known as “Glass City” for its glass-making companies, and also as the “Auto Parts Capital of the World” (Detroit is only 60 miles away). Like much of the Rust Belt, deindustrialisation hit Toledo hard; the local newspaper, the Toledo Blade, counts 140 factories that have closed since 2000 alone.\n\nWith a population of about 300,000, Toledo is just one of many cities in the US and across the globe that flies largely under the radar. It lacks the large urbanist booster class that exists in many bigger cities. Rust Belt self-loathing remains in fashion here: a local videographer has achieved a degree of fame by posting videos to YouTube of him driving around what seems to be a mostly vacant city, with names like Only in a Dump like Toledo, or Welcome to Downtown Toledo Ohio's Fabulous Nightlife (\"Believe it or not, 300,000 people live here\").\n\nBut beyond the plant closings and the civic struggles, today Toledo is making positive global headlines for something other than shuttered malls and urban decay: for the millions of dollars in Chinese investment it is attracting.\n\nChinese investor groups have bought the Park Inn Hotel and Seagate Hotel downtown. Another Chinese group purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for a \"new urbanist\"-style marina, which will include a mix of residential, retail and commercial uses. Ten separate Chinese companies have established sales offices in the region.\n\nThe previous mayor, Michael Bell, kicked all this off. Knowing he was unlikely to get much help from Washington in attracting investment, he decided he'd go drum it up himself. He made China his city's top foreign target for investment and led several trade trips to China personally. Until recently, the Toledo/Northwest Ohio region had a full-time representative in China.\n\nUnlikely Toledo is an example of an increasing trend around the world: small cities going it alone in search of success in a globalised, urbanised age. They are increasingly finding it necessary to act more like city-states such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Dubai, directly selling themselves to global investors and potential residents.\n\nCities, big and small, now trade not just provincially or nationally, but globally. They're also economically specialised at both the macro level (think of fashion and luxury in Paris) and the micro (the design of super-tall skyscrapers in Chicago). Migration patterns often follow city-to-city networks. Even crime is now global.\n\nWhat all this means is that each city’s needs are both global and particularised – and each needs to come up with its own strategy. Large cities have led the way here: São Paulo is focusing on diplomacy, with an \"office of foreign affairs\" and direct relationships with the US, Britain and France, aiming to tap into global networks of money, people and expertise. In New York, the police department has created its own international anti-terrorism unit with officers stationed everywhere from London to Tel Aviv and embedded at agencies such as the FBI, New Scotland Yard and Interpol. Mayors from around the world, realising they have more in common with each other than with their countries, have formed the C40 group to tackle climate issues, as national governments continue to squabble and fail to act.\n\nBut the city-state model comes with risks, especially for small cities. Too narrow a focus on global economic success can open fissures at home. In Britain, a chasm is opening between London and everywhere else. Even in the capital itself there has been a massive widening of the income gap and skyrocketing housing prices, not to mention riots.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities, an ill-timed raise of transit fares just as the country was pouring billions into the Olympics triggered protests. One of those cities was São Paulo, the \"leader in foreign diplomacy\", forced to come to terms with the fact that its citizens were throwing Molotov cocktails because of very local issues. Global investment might be flowing into Istanbul, but try to pave Gezi Park and watch what happens. A city too focused on its role in the global economy is like a national government obsessed with military spending.\n\nIt can also be taken too far, to a comical extent. Rather like Toledo, three cities in Indiana – Indianapolis, Anderson and Muncie – each took independent foreign trade trips in 2013. Yet all three are part of a single economic region, and only Indianapolis probably has the scale to operate globally.\n\nCooperation, here, is surely more important – as was recognised by Louisville and Lexington, two smaller cities (albeit the two largest in Kentucky) that joined forces to boost manufacturing. “Cities need to be excellent at partnering with each other internal to the state” to compete globally, says the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer. Rather than city-states proper, perhaps a better way to think about these new urban areas is “metro city-states”. Toledo has smartly taken this regional approach. “We always make sure to say Northwest Ohio,” says Paul Zito of the area’s regional growth agency.\n\nNevertheless, Toledo remains a deeply troubled city. The poverty rate is high and job creation anemic. So far, the hype about the China strategy probably outstrips the reality. Chinese investment has certainly put some money in the city’s coffers, but it has not yet created many jobs, and the marina remains on the drawing board. Zito says that Chinese investment in Toledo is following the pattern of Japan, with commercial real estate as only “the first wave” – but the new mayor, Mike Collins, says he won’t make as many personal trips as his predecessor.\n\nBut while full recovery for Toledo, and a potential harvest of significant jobs from its Chinese efforts, might be a way off, the fact that foreign investors are putting money into property in the urban heart of the Rust Belt shows how small cities can carve out a place for themselves on a global scale. Nick Kubiak, a Toledo expat who was living in Detroit, decided to apply the same DIY ethic happening in Motown to his own hometown. He returned last year to open a wine bar downtown, and says declining Toledo rents actually opened the door for him and others to get in where they previously couldn't before. Though he welcomes Chinese investors, Kubiak points out that many in this blue-collar union stronghold are suspicious of foreign investment. Still, as he says: \"You're not going to see change in Toledo without investing a lot of money – and that has to come from somewhere.\"\n\nAnd realistically, what alternative does this small city have? In a global age, cities simply have no choice but to be in the game.\n\nAaron M Renn publishes the urban affairs analysis site The Urbanophile\n\nMore in our City-states series\n\nWhich cities most dominate their countries?\n\nAre mayors more powerful than national leaders?"
