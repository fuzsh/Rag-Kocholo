        "text": "As published in the November 1, 2009 Toledo Business Journal\n\nTweet\n\nMike Bell,\n\nCandidate for Mayor of Toledo\n\nMayoral candidates address development issues\n\nToledo Business Journal recently spoke to Toledo mayoral candidate, Mike Bell. He shared the following thoughts.\n\nToledo Business Journal: Water is clearly a regional issue, and communities outside Toledo have now increased efforts to obtain alternative suppliers. One issue that outside communities cite is the requirement that, in addition to increasing rates for water, a share of the economic development benefits from projects must be paid to the City of Toledo. Do you see a loss of customers for Toledo water in the future? What impact will this have on the cost of water for Toledo residents (or is this not a real issue)? Do you see a role for a regional water authority? Explain your thoughts on this topic and any specifics you might suggest.\n\nMike Bell: The City’s current approach to selling our water is shortsighted. Toledo has not been a good partner – we have been inconsistent and arbitrary. Today, we are faced with having some of Toledo’s customers go elsewhere for water, which would ultimately reduce our revenue.\n\nIn June, I proposed a regional water compact in which Toledo would partner with our suburban neighbors. I believe that we can deal with our water customers in a professional and consistent manner while ensuring Toledoans get a fair return on their investment. Suburban communities understand that they will pay more for water than Toledo will. However, if they cannot get consistent and fair treatment, they could go elsewhere.\n\nThere are other economic implications of this issue that affect all of us. Water is an attractive resource for commerce. By sharing our water with other communities, we help them remain an attractive location for businesses. Joint Economic Development Zones and revenue sharing, when applied correctly, are effective means of getting a return on investment for Toledoans.\n\nBut again – it goes back to dealing with customers in consistent manner with fair and equitable proposals.\n\nTBJ: What is your position on merging the City of Toledo Department of Economic Development with the Lucas County Improvement Corporation (LCIC)? Are there other City of Toledo and Lucas County departments that you believe should be combined or any other departments or services in any other political entity that offer an opportunity for consolidation? If so, which specific departments and services?\n\nMB: I feel Toledo needs to have an autonomous economic development plan, but we can definitely create synergy by partnering with other economic development agencies in the community.\n\nAside from economic development, I would examine cooperative functions in information technologies, purchasing, and permitting systems where possible to create a more streamlined process for the region when dealing with businesses, but also to achieve savings in the City budget for Toledo and other participating municipalities.\n\nI believe that the only real way to create good, long-term, well-paying jobs is to make our community a good place for employers to do business. Toledo must restore its reputation as a city where it is easy to locate and grow a business. This includes assuring that Toledo becomes a business-ready location for expansion and business growth by creating turnkey sites that are “shovel ready” – with built-out infrastructure such as roads, sewer and water, natural gas, power, and street lighting. Such an approach will apply to major single sites and a pilot program of business parks to best capture interested prospects for location and expansion. Cost for infrastructure can come from an additional flow of dollars to the Capital Improvements Fund from the sale or lease of existing city properties.\n\nTBJ: There has been a great deal of attention on Toledo’s budget deficit. What is your position on raising new revenues through an increase in taxes or fees?\n\nMB: I am against raising taxes to generate revenue for the City. In talking with citizens around our community, I believe the message loud and clear is that we need to work within our existing means and that increased taxes or fees are not acceptable or tolerable to our residents.\n\nI have proposed the launch of a “citizen special investigation” (CSI) task force in concert with City Council to conduct a 90-day study of the City’s finances and generate the solid data needed to give the Mayor, council, administrators, and employees the ability to work out solid cost-cutting solutions in real time – and operate at a new level of trust. The CSI will be made up of senior-level leaders from accounting, banking, law, business, and labor – including leaders of the City’s bargaining units. The team will rely on a forensic accounting model to provide a data-driven analysis of income and expenses, pension and benefit liabilities, and overtime.\n\nI have also proposed that we evaluate skills of the City financial team and make improvements through staffing assignments and training – identify City holdings that can maximize revenue if they are privatized, either through sale or long-term lease. This could include parking garages, the Erie Street Market, or related facilities. We need to work with the bargaining units to initiate a human resources audit of all City departments to clarify assignments, eliminate inefficiencies, and establish appropriate staffing levels. Incorporate “best practices” from business and other communities to help find ways to do more with less. Finally, utilize an interest based bargaining model in all future negotiations with City bargaining units to work toward a workforce that is properly sized and deployed and is also given fair compensation, benefits, and job security.\n\nTBJ: There has been much discussion on the issue of the City of Toledo and other communities in the region becoming more “business friendly.” What are the three highest priority actions that you would take in your first 30 days in office to address this?\n\nMB: I would first establish the Mayor’s business advocate position, which would report directly to the Mayor as a member of his senior staff. The advocate would be the City’s point of contact to maintain regular contact with Toledo’s employers as well as guide people through the process of establishing a business in Toledo and identifying opportunities as well as roadblocks in economic development. The business advocate would also be a liaison with a business advisory panel – a volunteer committee of business leaders serving as a sounding board and a source of feedback on Toledo’s economic development and job retention efforts.\n\nIn addition, consolidate City departments responsible for permits, inspections, and business incentives into a single location that is convenient and accessible. Put a single manager in charge of these functions to end turf wars within the City bureaucracy that currently create barriers for new businesses to locate or existing businesses to expand.\n\nFinally, Toledo will save and create jobs by making our community a good place to do business, collaborating with regional economic development professionals and acting swiftly in a coordinated manner when new opportunities arise. Incubating businesses through creative partnerships will entail taking an economic gardening approach balanced with an economic hunting approach. An economic gardening approach cultivates companies and organizations by creating supportive environments where they can thrive. An economic hunting approach focuses on recruiting development opportunities from outside the City or region."
