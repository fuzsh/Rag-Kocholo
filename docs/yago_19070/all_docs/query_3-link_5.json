        "text": "Former Toledo Mayor Mike Bell, who is running again in 2015, has responded to allegations of sexism and making inappropriate comments at a Toledo bar last week.\n\nThe 'Mike Bell for Mayor' campaign sent the following statement to NBC 24 on Tuesday:\n\nMike Bell has been a public servant in this community for more than 30 years. Social media and phones with cameras may be relatively new, but Mike's reputation in this community isn't. Character defamation is a serious issue.\n\nA former Lucas County Democratic Party employee was following Mike at Wesley's taking pictures, on the night of September 4th. The next morning, she made accusations toward Mike regarding inappropriate behavior that is in no way proven by the posted photos, and are clearly egregious.\n\nWhile Mike was at Wesley's that evening, he has no idea who the woman is or what is behind her claims. These accusations are harmful toward Mike's character and reputation. They are false and we are confident they will be discovered as such.\"\n\nAllison Dow, who formerly worked for the Lucas County Democratic Party, posted a series of tweets on Monday accusing Bell of making inappropriate comments at Wesley's Bar last Friday. Dow tweeted that Bell \"grabbed me from behind and said if I stood on my tiptoes in my dress, his friends would pass out.\"\n\nDow posted another tweet saying she is \"not going to let a candidate for #toledomayor act sexist towards me and get away with it. Toledo deserves better than that.\"\n\nDow agreed to an interview that would have take place on Tuesday night, however she later told NBC 24 that she would instead be releasing her own video response on Wednesday."
