        "text": "After 33 years with the Toledo Fire Department, including four as its chief, Mike Wolever is retiring.\n\nWolever first joined TFD in August of 1978. He worked his way through the ranks to become its chief in 2007 when he replaced Chief Mike Bell who retired.\n\nHe serves as the vice chair of the Ohio Homeland Security Advisory Committee and served as chairman of the State of Ohio Medical Technical Advisory Committee, co chair of the Toledo Urban Area Security Initiative and co chair of the Metropolitan Medical Response Team.\n\n\"As fire chief and mayor, I have counted on Mike Wolever to be a leader in the fire department for 20 years,\" said Mayor Michael P. Bell. \"I appeciate his service and his dedication to Toledo Fire and Rescue and to the residents of the city and the region.\"\n\nDuring Wolever's tenure, the long term federal consent decree issued in the case was dismissed allowing the department to move forward with more modern and widely accepted recruitment practices. The fire department also evolved into a more regional entity with its merger with the Ottawa Hils Fire Department.\n\nWith Wolever's departure, Deputy Chief Luis Santiago will lead the Toledo Fire and Rescue Division. Santiago has served as deputy chief since December 2007. He joined the department in 1984.\n\n\"I have every confidence in Lou's ability to lead this department into the future,\" said Mayor Bell. \"He has proven himself to be a valuable leader among Toledo's firefighters and a strategic incident response commander.\"\n\nWolever's last day will be July 1."
