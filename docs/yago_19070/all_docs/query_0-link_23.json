Michael Collins, Toledo has elected a new leader.\n\nUnofficial results indicate Paula Hicks-Hudson has been elected mayor of Toledo by more than 30-percent of voters. She becomesthe first Democratic Party endorsed mayoral candidate to win election in Ohio since 2001.\n\nThe vote comes after months of heavy campaigning and dozens of forums and debates between all seven candidates, including Collins's widow Sandy Drabik-Collins, former mayors Mike Bell and Carty Finkbeiner, Toledo City Councilwoman Sandy Spang, former Toledo City Councilman Mike Ferner, and self-proclaimed Prophetess and perennial candidate Opal Covey.\n\nVIEW:\n\nMayor Hicks-Hudson, who assumed the mayoral seat in February after the death of Mayor Collins, will serve the remaining two years of the unexpired term. She will have the opportunity to serve for the next ten years - two full, four-year terms - if re-elected.\n\nThe former Toledo City Council President becomes the first African American woman to be elected mayor of Toledo."
