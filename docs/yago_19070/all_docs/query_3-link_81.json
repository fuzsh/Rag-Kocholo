        "text": "Here’s How To Watch the Paris Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will officially come to an end on Aug. 11, and it’s been quite a run. So, how do you watch the Paris Olympics closing ceremony? Get some tissue ready, because it’s almost here. I personally like the opening ceremony more than the closing one, because it’s sad to see the games end. But, both the opening and closing ceremonies are always exciting, so I’m looking forward to seeing the Paris Olympics close out. It’s also right around my birthday, so I might as well pretend it’s a birthday celebration for me.\n\nHow to Watch the Paris Olympics Closing Ceremony\n\nBefore the Paris Olympics closing ceremony on Aug. 11, NBC will air a special “Best of Paris 2024” highlight show at 2 p.m. ET. This show will feature some of the best moments from the games this year.\n\nLooking back at the games, I’m guessing that some of the moments they’ll show include when surfer Gabriel Medina scored a surfing photo that went totally viral. The moment happened on July 29, when Medina competed in Teahupo’o, a village in the French Polynesian Island of Tahiti, and predicted his perfect score by holding up 10 fingers while he came out of a massive wave. He got a 9.90, which NBC News says is the highest single-wave score in the sport’s Olympic history. After getting that score, he traveled towards the lip of the wave, flew off his surfboard and pointed his finger towards the sky. Photographer Jerome Brouillet caught the special moment, and it went viral. Another big moment was when Simone Biles and fellow Olympian Jordan Chiles showed real sportsmanship during the award ceremony when they bowed down, gracefully, in front of Andrade to give her respect. People around the world thought it was such a sweet moment, and that moment soon went viral. Biles’ husband supporting her at the games was also special.\n\nWhere the Paris Olympics Closing Ceremony Will Take Place and More\n\nThe closing ceremony will happen at Stade de France in Saint-Denis. It’s the stadium where the Olympic track and field events are being held.\n\nThe ceremony will take place Sunday, Aug. 11, live at 3 p.m. ET/12 p.m. PT. Then, NBC will air a primetime replay at 7 p.m. ET. Aside from watching the festivities on NBC, you can stream the closing ceremony on Peacock and NBCOlympics.com. So, get your popcorn and snacks ready, because this will likely be a dramatic end to the games. If you’re already looking ahead to the future, the next Summer Olympics will take place from Jul 14, 2028, to Jul 30, 2028, in Los Angeles.
