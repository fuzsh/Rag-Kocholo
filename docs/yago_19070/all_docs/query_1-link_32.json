        "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - Toledo’s mayor says he will make sure the splash pad at Savage Park will reopen within the next week, regardless of whether it’s officially deemed up to code, and committed to building a new one there in the future.\n\nMayor Wade Kapszukiewicz told 13 Action News on Thursday the city will make sure the currently shut down splash pad will be available to neighborhood kids again in the coming days, even if it means reopening without being in compliance with laws about water pressure.\n\nA representative with the Toledo Lucas County Health Department said despite the mayor’s comments, nothing has changed and the department’s priority remains the safety of those using the splash pad.\n\n“We want to ensure that any repairs or plans that the City of Toledo wants to implement are approved by an engineer to be in compliance with laws and regulations,” the statement from the health department Thursday read.\n\nMayor Kapszukiewicz went on to say the city believes the splash pad is currently in compliance with the water pressure laws. They’ve tested the sprinklers at least four times, but the health department wants a special engineer to sign off on it.\n\n“Sometimes there are communication issues, there’s always bureaucracy, I would say within a week one way or another the splash pad will be turned on even if I go over there and turn it on myself,” Kapszukiewicz said. “Even if the health department doesn’t give us permission, we’re going to turn it on and they can put me in jail if they want. Up until this point, we’ve been sort of working with the health department and trying to do this in a way where they would give us the permission, we’re getting to a point where we’re going to turn it on and have them yell at us after the fact.”\n\nHe went on to say that the city will make sure a new splash pad will be built at Savage Park. The city is hoping to secure a $2 million grant to pay for the new splash pad, but won’t find out if that money will be awarded until November. He said in the event that grant funding isn’t awarded to Toledo, the city will pay for it through American Rescue Act funding. The administration is sending an ordinance to Toledo City Council next week to fund the new splash pad.\n\nPrevious coverage:\n\nToledo officials provide update on splash pad at Savage Park\n\nCity of Toledo hands out free one-day pool passes as Savage Splash Pad remains closed\n\nI-TEAM: City knew Savage Park splash pad was not compliant\n\nSplash pad at Savage Park not compliant with new regulations, closed for work\n\nLatest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals"
