        "text": "One NFL player has criticized Simone Biles and fellow Olympian Jordan Chiles for a move they made in good will, and people are certainly taking Biles and Chiles’ side. When you’re on top, people want to bring you down. It’s a sad truth that Biles knows too much about. She’s the “GOAT” when it comes to the Olympics and athleticism, but she still has people who try to bring her down.\n\nNFL Player Criticizes Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles and Gets Backlash\n\nOne of the most viral moments from the Paris Olympics came Monday (Aug. 5), when Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles bowed down in front of Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who won a gold medal, with Biles and Chiles scoring the silver and bronze. It’s a huge deal for Andrade, who has fought through three ACL tears during her athletic career. Winning in the floor exercise was the second gold medal of her career, and it meant a lot. Biles already has tons of gold medals, so she didn’t look too upset.\n\nBoth Biles and Chiles showed real sportsmanship during the award ceremony when they bowed down, gracefully, in front of Andrade to give her respect. People around the world thought it was such a sweet moment, and that moment soon went viral.\n\nWhile most people were loving on it, one NFL player, Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey, was not. The three-time Pro Bowler took to X (formerly Twitter) to write, “This is literally disgusting.” Of course, his message has gotten a lot of criticism in the form of replies on X, but he must believe in it, because he hasn’t taken it down.\n\nI’m honestly floored by Humphrey. As a longtime follower of the NFL and an NFL reporter, I really respect Humphrey and everything he has done in his career. He’s probably going to be a huge piece of the puzzle for the Baltimore Ravens this coming season. For someone this talented and who has so much going for him, I have to wonder, why would you say this, Humphrey? Maybe he wanted to get in the news cycle, because here we are talking about him in the same breath as the Olympics, which wouldn’t have happened otherwise. Maybe he saw Biles’ husband, fellow NFL player Jonathan Owens of the Bears, getting attention. Or, maybe he really doesn’t like to see competitors play nice. Either way, I hope he rethinks his thoughts on this, because most people appreciate this moment for being one of the most beautiful in the Paris games.
