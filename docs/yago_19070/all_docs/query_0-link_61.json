Sonny explains that new construction is still prevalent, but when renovating is more practical and cost-effective, many clients are now considering that route. The feature goes on to detail SSOE’s recent renovation project for ProMedica Health System, still under construction, which the article appropriately dubs a “whopper remodeling job”. The project requires transforming two historical industrial structures in Toledo, Ohio into what will soon be ProMedica’s corporate headquarters. The design consists of repurposing a 19th century landmark steam plant and connecting it to a former bank building to create an office space for nearly 1,000 employees. Complex to say the least, the urban revitalization effort also required the demolition of two deteriorated 20-story brick smokestacks, which were replaced with smaller steel replicas that required close coordination with National Register of Historical Preservation officials.
