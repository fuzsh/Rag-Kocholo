        "text": "After winning the vote by more than 5,000 in November, Wade Kapszukiewicz is now officially beginning his duties as the Mayor of Toledo.\n\nThe former Lucas County Treasurer starts his new role at 8 a.m. Wednesday, and says he will immediately be in a meeting.\n\n\"We're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work. There's a lot that needs to be done, but this is also an exciting time for Toledo. There's some momentum in our downtown, and we want to see that momentum continue, but we also want to see it extend out into the neighborhoods, so everyone can enjoy the comeback that Toledo has begun.\"\n\nKapszukiewicz takes over for Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson who led the city for nearly three years.\n\nDuring his speech Tuesday, he credited her for what she accomplished while in office.\n\nHe also referenced Shakespeare and Aristotle in his wishes to the city.\n\n\"What is the essence of life? To serve others and do good. It's that simple. I need Toledoans to do good for their city. I'm challenging our citizens to do good for Toledo this year. We need your help.\"\n\nThroughout his speech, Kapszukiewicz referenced the ups and downs that Toledo has been through.\n\nHe believes that if he can get some help from the people of the city, a lot will get done.\n\n\"We have to change, we have to adapt, we have to do new things, and I need help if we're going to do this together. No one will feel sorry for us if we don't do it. History will just pass us by, but we can do it.\"\n\nFollowing his swearing in, Kapszukiewicz sat in his first council meeting as mayor.\n\nThat's where Matt Cherry was named Council President."
