        "text": "Training camp is here and Baylor football is less than a month away from kicking off the 2024 season against Tarleton State. As training camp continues to unfold and the opening weekend comes closer, BearsIllustrated will provide an in-depth preview and breakdown of each position group, including our early depth chart projections.\n\nToday, we focus on the tight end room.\n\nQuarterback - Link\n\nRunning back - Link\n\nWide Receiver - Link\n\nOFFSEASON RECAP\n\nWith a new offensive scheme in 2024, the tight end group will feel the greatest change in playstyle. Going from the Wide Zone to Air Raid, Baylor added Ole Miss transfer Michael Trigg as a pass catching threat to fill the shoes of Drake Dabney, who was the second leading receiver on the team in 2023 and transferred to TCU to play out his final year of eligibility in 2024.\n\nThe Bears also lost Jake Roberts, who transferred to Oklahoma, as the room shrunk from nine players deep to just six. The green and gold will likely flow through the entire room as each player made big plays in spring camp to land themselves on the roster. Gone are the days of three tight end sets, but offensive coordinator Jake Spavital has plenty of tools at his disposal in the tight end room.\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT – Kelsey Johnson\n\nSince arriving at Baylor in 2022, Johnson has constantly exceeded expectations. Now, Johnson is the incumbent tight end with the best pass-blocking skills among players who could start and has developed as a pass catcher since arriving on campus. The 6-foot-3 tight end started four games in 2023 and tallied 11 catches for 80 yards.\n\nWith the offensive shift, Johnson will have to rise to the occasion as a game-changer rather than a surprise contributor. In the spring, I said he could be a boom or bust candidate, and I still believe that due to the depth on the roster and the opportunities for a tight end to be the best safety blanket on the team.\n\nJohnson's usage will depend on the game plan and opponent each week, but if he is the best all-around player in the room, expect him to see significant time on the field.\n\nMUST STEP UP – Michael Trigg\n\nWhile every tight end made jaw-dropping catches at Baylor's Green & Gold Spring Practice, Trigg constantly forced defenders into mistakes and made big plays. When Trigg was recruited to USC in 2021, he was the No. 128 prospect but never saw the opportunity to secure the starting role. After battling through multiple injuries, the path for Trigg led him to Baylor.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 tight end still has the talent to be a star pass catcher in a featured role, but he's still an unknown commodity until he can prove himself on the field. There is no question he will have the opportunity to start in 2024, but with the talent surrounding him, the window could close quickly. However, with two years of eligibility remaining, Trigg will have every opportunity to succeed in the green and gold if healthy.\n\nUNDERCLASSMEN TO WATCH – Matthew Klopfenstein\n\nDuring his freshman season, Klopfenstein played in 11 games and flashed exciting pass-catching ability, which should translate to more opportunities now that he's in year two. The former four-star recruit came to camp at 6-foot-4, 244 pounds, emphasizing becoming a better all-around tight end. With improved blocking technique and his strong pass-catching skills, the sophomore should see plenty of opportunities to step up and get more reps.\n\nPROJECTED DEPTH CHART\n\nTE1 – Michael Trigg (R-Jr)\n\nTE2 – Kelsey Johnson (Jr)\n\nTE3 – Matthew Klopfenstein (So)\n\nDepth – Gavin Yates (Sr), Hawkins Polley (R-Fr), Cody Mladenka (R-So)\n\nREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS\n\nDabney (552 yards) and Roberts (231) combined for more receiving yards than any wide receiver on the team and were some of the most targeted players on the roster. With the change in scheme, the idea is to avoid tight ends being the No. 1 option on three out of every four plays.\n\nThere will still be opportunities for big plays out of the tight end room, with more passing plays naturally. However, I would tone expectations and say a 500-yard season and a 250-yard season out of the top two tight ends is a neat baseline, with the goal of protecting the quarterback and allowing others to shine first, like an old-school tight end would."
