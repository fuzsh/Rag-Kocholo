Anyone in the city can now access e-scooters and bicycles to ride around and see everything Toledo has to offer!\n\nWe love seeing the growth in Downtown Toledo!\n\nTo celebrate the new program, Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz took a ride on one of the new scooters. After a photo was taken of him downtown riding a scooter through downtown, he instantly went viral and became memeworthy over night!\n\nPeople placed him in so many different photos such riding away from dinosaurs, riding with motorcycles, even turned him into the modern day Indiana Jones, and so much more!\n\nOf course we wanted in on the fun! Doesn't the Mayor look excited to check out our newest releases?\n\nIn all seriousness, we are excited about this new program and hope this helps people to get around and check out everything that makes Toledo wonderful and unique."
