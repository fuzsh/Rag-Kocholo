The mayor has always put working families first, and under his leadership, Toledoans have already seen more jobs and meaningful investments in city infrastructure, housing and public safety. We look forward to even more results for working families in Toledo and around Ohio under his continued leadership,” said Chair Walters.\n\n###"
