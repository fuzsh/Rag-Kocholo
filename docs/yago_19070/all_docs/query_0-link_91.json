        "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio — Before it became known as the Marina District, the 128 acres of tall grass and dirt piles on the Maumee River here was home to one of the city’s most prominent eyesores, the Acme coal-fired power plant, which was decommissioned in 1994.\n\nAdjoining the riverfront parcel is the Docks, a 69,550-square-foot formerly city-owned dining and entertainment complex that for years after it was built in 1996 was among Toledo’s most popular destinations. But the recent recession hit Toledo hard, and two of the five restaurants closed this year, leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and lost tax revenue.\n\nThe open space along the east bank of the Maumee, bounded by Front Street, Main Street and Interstate 280, appeared to be another big development challenge in one of the regions of the country hardest hit by the recession. But last fall two real estate developers from China, personally recruited by Mayor Michael P. Bell and his staff, took a look during a reciprocal visit to this city of 287,000 residents and saw an opportunity.\n\nOn March 18, the two investors, Yuan Xiaohona and Wu Kin Hung, closed on the $2.15 million purchase of the Docks and the adjacent five acres of parking lots. In an interview, Mayor Bell, a 56-year-old independent elected in 2009, said he and other city leaders thought the deal would eventually lead to a much larger project: the sale of the adjoining 69 acres to Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu, who said in a signed memorandum in February that they intended to build a new riverfront residential, office, retail and entertainment district.\n\n“They’ve moved forward to say what they are going to do,” said Mr. Bell, an outsize bachelor who played linebacker at the University of Toledo, rides a Harley and favors pink ostrich cowboy boots and matching pink ties. “A huge portion of what is happening and will happen is based on the trust we’ve developed. The purchase of the Docks is Step 1. It shows we have energy, and we have direction.”\n\nR. Scott Prephan, a real estate consultant who introduced Mayor Bell to Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu during a trip to China in September, said engineering studies had started. He showed a reporter some of the first architectural drawings, which envisioned a low-rise assembly of modern multi- and single-family residences, office buildings and retail spaces surrounded by parks and the Maumee waterfront. The intent of the development, he said, is to serve as a kind of staging area for international executives to conduct business in the Midwest, a lively urban neighborhood for their spouses and children, and a destination for shopping and dining for residents of the Toledo region.\n\n“The concept is very strong,” Mr. Prephan said, “and the market will support this kind of idea.”\n\nMs. Yuan and Mr. Wu, the principals in their newly organized Dashing Pacific Group, have expressed ardent enthusiasm for the project. Ms. Yuan wrote in the February memorandum, signed by her and Mr. Bell, that the company’s goal was to “work diligently to prepare an offer to purchase the Marina District and share with you our vision for its development.”\n\nMs. Yuan, who was not available for an interview, has visited Toledo twice, most recently in late March when she met newly elected Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, who said he supported the project. Mr. Wu visited Toledo in October and sent Jimmy Wu, his son who lives in New York, to the meeting with Mr. Kasich.\n\nReal estate professionals here estimated that the investment by Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu could total $200 million to $300 million. That would make it one of the largest real estate investments in the United States by Chinese developers, and part of a steadily growing number of Chinese-financed projects in small urban American markets.\n\nAccording to the research company Real Capital Analytics, aside from two big office building investments in New York for $900 million, the largest Chinese investment last year was the $90 million purchase of the Sheraton Universal hotel in North Hollywood, Calif., by the Shenzhen New World Group. The largest real estate purchase in the Midwest last year by Chinese investors, according to Real Capital Analytics, was the $7.2 million that the Shenzhen BRC Development Company paid for a 120,500-square-foot mall in South Bend, Ind. The companies are not related.\n\n“What’s remarkable in a good way about the Toledo deal is historically when people think about investors from China, they focused on the major markets — New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,” said Spencer Levy, the executive managing director of CB Richard Ellis Capital Markets, who is based in Washington. “But we’re starting to find significant interest from China in what people would consider secondary markets, and in asset classes that are not stable and do not have long-term leases.”\n\nThe plan for the Marina District and the sale of the Docks set off a small xenophobic response from some Toledo residents. “There were a few letters and a few blogs that took issue with our selling riverfront property to the Chinese or any foreign investor,” said Thomas S. Crothers, the deputy mayor for external relations. “Our job, though, is to bring investment from domestic or foreign sources to revitalize our community.”\n\nStill, many business executives here praised the deal. “Business people have been very supportive,” said Ford Weber, the president and chief executive of the Lucas County Improvement Corporation, an economic development group. “It’s an opportunity to take a vacant, tax-dead property and make it a contributor to a better quality of life, a stronger economy and a broader tax base.”\n\nThe city has been trying for years to develop the Marina District, the site of a $42 million toxic waste cleanup that was completed in 2007. The city also spent four years marketing the Docks to retire a $1.66 million bond and bring in revenue to help reduce a budget deficit that this year will reach $4.85 million. The $2.15 million that Dashing Pacific Group paid for the restaurant complex will net Toledo about $300,000, city officials said."
