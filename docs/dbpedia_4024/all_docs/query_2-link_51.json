        "text": "DURHAM â€“ Duke junior quarterback Riley Leonard has been selected to the preseason watch list for The Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, which is an honor that recognizes the top senior or upperclassman quarterback set to graduate with their class.\n\nThis is Leonard's fourth preseason watch list selection as he was also tabbed to the Maxwell Award, Davey O'Brien Award and the Manning Award watch lists.\n\nLeonard returns for his second campaign as Duke's starting quarterback and was tabbed a team captain for the upcoming season. In 20 career games (14 starts), he has completed 287-of-454 (.632) passes for 3,348 yards with 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He owns a career pass efficiency rating of 137.35. On the ground, Leonard has rushed 171 times for 872 yards (5.09) and 15 touchdowns.\n\nHe opens the 2023 campaign as one of three returning FBS quarterbacks nationally to amass 2,900-plus passing yards and 695-plus rushing yards a season ago, joining LSU's Jayden Daniels and North Carolina's Drake Maye. Additionally, he is one of two returning FBS quarterbacks nationally to register 20-plus passing and 13-plus rushing touchdowns last year, joining Oregon's Bo Nix. Leonard, a 6-4, 212-pound native of Fairhope, Ala., was named a 2022 honorable mention All-ACC selection after ranking third in the league in total offensive yards per game (282.00), third in pass attempts (392), third in pass completions (25), third in total points responsible for (198), tied for third in scoring (78), fourth in pass completion percentage (.638), fourth in passing yards per game (228.23), fifth in touchdown passes (20), and fifth in passing efficiency (141.11).\n\nThe leader of a multifaceted offense, Leonard was a big contributor to the Blue Devils' ground game, joining Jordan Waters (566), Jaquez Moore (508), and Jaylen Coleman (480) to form the first quartet in Duke history to post 400-plus rushing yards each in a single-season. Additionally, Leonard coupled with Waters (8), Ja. Moore (5), and Coleman (4), formed the first foursome in Blue Devil history to compile four-plus rushing touchdowns apiece in a single-season.\n\nThe namesake of the Golden Arm Award has a storied history. Johnn Unitas was an 18-year veteran of the NFL, who played his collegiate career at the University of Louisville before joining the Baltimore Colts in 1958. His career passing figures include 2,830 pass completions for 40,239 yards, 290 touchdowns and throwing a touchdown pass in 47 consecutive games.\n\nThe 2023 award winner will be presented the Golden Arm Award trophy by The Johnny Unitas Educational Foundation President, John Unitas Jr., as well as other notable attendees at Golden Arm Award banquet and celebration at the Four Seasons Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland on Thursday, December 7, 2023.\n\nSeason and single-game tickets as well as mini plans for the 2023 campaign are now available by visiting GoDuke.com/footballtix.\n\nTo stay up to date with Blue Devils football, follow the team on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook by searching \"DukeFootball\".\n\nDuke Players on 2023 NCFAA Watch Lists\n\nMaxwell Award: Riley Leonard\n\nOutland Trophy: Graham Barton\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy: DeWayne Carter\n\nRay Guy Award: Porter Wilson\n\nWuerffel Trophy: Ja'Mion Franklin\n\nPaul Hornung Award: Jaylen Stinson\n\nRimington Trophy: Jacob Monk\n\nBiletnikoff Trophy: Jalon Calhoun\n\nDavey O'Brien Award: Riley Leonard\n\nChuck Bednarik Award: DeWayne Carter\n\nManning Award: Riley Leonard\n\nLombardi Award: Graham Barton & DeWayne Carter\n\nJohnny Unitas Golden Arm Award: Riley Leonard\n\n#GoDuke\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#62 Graham Barton\n\nOL\n\n6' 5\"\n\nSenior\n\n#5 Jalon Calhoun\n\nWR\n\n5' 11\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\n#90 DeWayne Carter\n\nDT\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\n#22 Jaylen Coleman\n\nRB\n\n6' 1\"\n\nGraduate Student\n\n#5 Ja'Mion Franklin\n\nDT\n\n6' 2\"\n\nGraduate Student\n\n#13 Riley Leonard\n\nQB\n\n6' 4\"\n\nJunior\n\n#63 Jacob Monk\n\nOL\n\n6' 3\"\n\nGraduate Student\n\n#9 Jaquez Moore\n\nRB\n\n5' 10\"\n\nJunior\n\n#2 Jaylen Stinson\n\nS\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSenior\n\n#7 Jordan Waters\n\nRB\n\n6' 0\"\n\nGraduate Student"
