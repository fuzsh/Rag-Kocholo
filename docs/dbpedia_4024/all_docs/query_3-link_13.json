Together, let's celebrate the incredible achievements of your team and set the stage for an even brighter year ahead. 🌠 #RecognizeExcellence #EndOfYearAwards #TeamAppreciation\n\nWe're thrilled to introduce another of our Leadership Committee superstars, Joe Thomas, ACP, MAAP!!! AND since it's Friday we're releasing this one early because we all know work stops at 12 on Fridays --- wait 👀 did we just say that!?!?!?!? 😂 🌟 Position: ACPN Leadership Committee Member 🛠 Skills: Networking, Sarcasm, Inappropriate Comments, VCdb Query Master 📅 Seasons with ACPN: 3 Anyone who has met Joe knows he can not be summed up into a paragraph so you are getting some eclectic facts about him (from him): 🔸 My life has been split living in the Toledo, OH area (mostly in Michigan) and the Atlanta Metro area 🔸 I love sci-fi adventure, all of it! Star Trek, Star Wars, Firefly, Battlestar Galactic, and if you have a favorite I would love to hear!! 🔸 I love the heat and hate the cold 🔸 I imported a JDM commercial truck from Japan a couple years ago and it's a blast to drive. 🔸 I go to Disney World 🏰 ✨ entirely too much, but I love it! 🍻 🌎 🔸 I once had a 🐿️ as a pet. 🔸 I \"fell\" into catalog 9 years ago with an unsolicited message on LinkedIn from Jeffery Chalfin and this is a story I love to tell! 1️⃣ Why I joined the aftermarket? -- I needed a day job when I was 18 to supplement my evening job as a pizza 🍕 delivery driver. I saw a now hiring sign at a small shop while I was out delivering pizza and swung in the next day to apply. Started off busting tires and changing oil. Probably one of the best decisions I every made in my life. 2️⃣ Why I stay in the aftermarket? -- I found my passion and my people in this industry. The Aftermarket just feels like home; yes, our aftermarket family is a little crazy, very diverse opinions, and even a little irritating at times but I can think of no better place I want to spend the rest of my career. The people, the passion, and the tenacity of this industry is what keeps me motivated to not only stay but to contribute to its betterment where I can. 3️⃣ ONE word the committee might use to describe me? -- \"Eclectic\" - I am uniquely me and always trying to glean the best parts of my experiences. I had a feral childhood in the 80's, experienced the dawn of personal computing in the 90's, and the mobile devise revolution in the 2000's. 4️⃣ Joe we asked Sam Russo, MSIT, ACP 🏎️💨 if this word was appropriate and she had a not appropriate for LinkedIn response -- \"Eclectic lolol...I would say that's a fancy word for Joe. We all know Joe brings a TON of VALUE to the industry and that value comes out in unexpected different ways. Having managed Joe for a year, and been Joe's friend for going on 7 years, I would say Joe is not everyone's cup-of-tea. He doesn't play the politics of corporate norms, so don't try to put him in a box. He's more passionate about this industry than anyone I know, and he will do it with a smile on his face and Loki ears on his head!\" #ACPNLeadership #TeamSpotlight #DisneyAdult\n\nTheater Alliance was so pleased to join Booz Allen Hamilton at The Anthem for their Booz Allen Excellence Awards! The talented team of Theater Alliance artists and youth \"brought the magic\" to the evening of WOW led by Natalie Ade, Kari Merkel, and team. Arts organizations get asked to perform at these kind of events all the time - and as an artistic leader, we get asked to make those decisions. For me, the question always comes down to #values. Does the organization align with our values of integrity, diversity, and excellence? Does the organization value artists? Does the organization live their values? With #BoozAllenHamilton, the answer was a resounding YES. Even in the first conversation about the event, we didn't talk about what they needed or how to make all their dreams come true on a tiny budget. Instead, we talked about what they believe in and what we believe in - we talked about the WHY of our organizations. That is what makes a great collaboration and I'm grateful! #values #integrity #diversity #excellence\n\n💡Many interesting insights about building the companies, hiring-maintaining-firing people, investing, merging, keeping some amount of mental and physical fitness and much more last week at Etnetera Group. 🫶🏻 I am very glad that events like this exist since sharing the true insights with all theirs ups and downs is helping us to grow and learn. 💡🚀 Among all interesting topics I would emphasise some thoughts that were mentioned: - it is good to be an open leader (especially as a founder at earlier stages), but at some point the personal issues does not belong to the working hours - if a leader is in a trouble, it is his / her duty to inform and coordinate with investors...and sometimes they jointly decide not to share to a team to destabilise - OKRs are great as a concept to keep focus, but sometimes other frameworks such as \"high integrity commitment\" or \"beat failure\" serves better - when bringing investors or facing an M&A, hiring an consultant to represent you during a negotiations might be the best investment you made - founder in the sold company is an VIP - \"vest in peace\" :D ❤️✌🏻 I can't wait to join one of other LEADERS VOICE later this year and to all others do not hesitate to join if you get your invite. And of course always glad to see the good old partners-in-crime Tomáš Braverman, Jiri Psota, Michal Ďuriník, Petr Boros and many others ☺️ #foundersshare #leadersvoice #workhardplayhard\n\nAll the team chatter is about organising the Christmas party. How did that happen? Another year almost gone and you're thinking - well, I'm on track to reach my operational goals, it's been a busy year (of course), but... But what about those loftier goals I had for myself? Perhaps the ones that I kept to myself? Where I wanted to prove to myself I could speak up at that senior leadership meeting? (Hasn't happened. Not the right time.) Where I wanted to get involved in something new? (Hasn't happened. Not enough time.) Where I wanted to spend time developing that new product to help our clients? (Hasn't happened. Not enough time.) But there is enough time. You need to take a step back, really commit to what you want to be different and prioritise this. Easier said than done, I know. I can help. I've worked with many senior women just like you in the insurance sector to take a step back, speak up and make the impact they're looking for. With confidence. If you want that shift, then set up a call https://lnkd.in/ePEhaTp6 or dm me."
