        "text": "I use an integrated interdisciplinary approach to address issues of concern in human and animal health, my lab has a unique focus on two closely related issues: 1) Developing methods to understand immunometabolism towards innovative therapies for diseases with high public health impact, e.g. diabetes, obesity, and infectious disease, and 2) Identifying reasons why non-clinical models fail or succeed in predicting human outcomes to confer solutions that improve the accuracy of these models. When there are no alternatives to animal models, we focus on critical refinements aimed at reduction in use and the best animal experience. My work explores this interface to provide therapies that improve the quality of life for patients and improve the welfare of animals used in biomedical research.\n\nCurrent projects in the lab include: optimal design and the impacts of behavioral management on coping, physiology, and well-being; and the development of predictive biomarkers and regenerative medicine approaches to reverse metabolic disease, induce immune tolerance or immune recognition, and replace damaged cells, tissues, and organs.\n\nGraham, M.
