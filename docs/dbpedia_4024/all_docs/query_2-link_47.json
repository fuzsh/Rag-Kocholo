        "text": "Leonard Graham Wickline went to the big fire station in the sky on Monday June 28, 2021. Graham was born in Radford, Va where he spent his remaining years. Born in Radford on December 3, 1947, he was the son of the late Evangeline Graham Wickline and Arndill Miller Wickline.\n\nHe worked for Lynchburg Foundry in Radford, was a volunteer firefighter with Radford Fire Department where he later served as a career firefighter until he retired. He was a member of the Virginia May Masonic Lodge #38 A.F.&A.M. His greatest job by far was playing PawPaw to his 3 grandsons. One of his great joys was playing practical jokes on people and causing trouble. He enjoyed taking trips with his wife, keeping his grandsons in trouble, forcing his daughter to go to Lowes with him, and instilling a love of Star Wars through his whole family.\n\nHe is survived by his beloved wife, Donna Austin Wickline, a daughter, Kimberly Wickline Proctor (James Proctor), 2 sons, Jason Kyle Wickline and Austin Miller Wickline, and 3 grandsons, Kyle, Lucas, Liam, and a sister Brenda Wickline.\n\nMemorial services will be held on Friday, July 2, 2021 at 2:00 p.m. at Grove United Methodist Church with Rev. Dr. Jan C. Nicholson-Angle officiating. The family will receive friends on Friday at the church from noon until 2:00 p.m. Graham will receive his last call of duty while on Engine 2 immediately following the service and will complete his mission at Radford Fire and Rescue Building in Radford. In lieu of flowers, please make memorial contributions in Grahamâ€™s memory to the Radford Animal Shelter.\n\nOnline condolences may be sent to the family by visiting www.seaglefuneralhome.com Arrangements by Seagle Funeral Home, Pulaski."
