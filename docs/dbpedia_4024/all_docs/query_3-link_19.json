        "text": "In Honor Of… Norma Graham\n\nHonoring scientists who have made important and lasting contributions to the sciences of mind, brain, and behavior.\n\nNorma Graham, PhD\n\nProfessor and Chair, Department of Psychology\n\nColumbia University\n\nNorma Graham was born on August 8, 1944, in St. Louis, Missouri. She received her bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Stanford University in 1966 and her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. After completing her doctorate, she became a post-doctoral fellow in visual neuroscience at the Rockefeller University. Following her fellowship, she took a position in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University, where she has worked since 1972.\n\nGraham is a leading researcher in the field of visual perception, using mathematical models to interpret results from psychophysical experiments and neurophysiological studies. She is particularly interested in what might be called the hidden layers of visual perception — stages of processing far from the input end (the light hitting the retina) and also far from the output end (conscious perception and control of action).\n\nHer early work on pattern and form perception helped develop the concept, now widely accepted, of multiple channels sensitive to different ranges of spatial frequency and orientation. Her book Visual Pattern Analyzers (1989) summarized, integrated, and extended the work of many scientists investigating multiple channels not only for spatial frequency and orientation, but also for many other dimensions of pattern vision.\n\nHer subsequent work (along with that of a number of other scientists) hypothesized and investigated several other kinds of processes. These include complex channels (also called second-order or non-Fourier channels) and two forms of contrast adaptation (normalization and comparison). When combined with the original multiple channels, these produce an even better description of hidden stages of visual processing.\n\nGraham has served on the editorial boards of several journals and on the committees of various professional societies. She has also served on numerous committees and task forces at Columbia University and is currently chair of the Department of Psychology there. She considers one of her greatest contributions (and pleasures) to be the teaching, not only of graduate students, but also of large numbers of undergraduates, both in courses and in her laboratory.\n\nGraham’s contributions to psychology and the visual sciences have been recognized through the honors she has received. She is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and of the Optical Society of America. She was elected to the Society of Experimental Psychologists (1983), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993), and the National Academy of Sciences (1998).\n\nIndividuals Honoring Norma Graham:\n\nCorby Dale, University of California, San Francisco\n\nElizabeth T.
