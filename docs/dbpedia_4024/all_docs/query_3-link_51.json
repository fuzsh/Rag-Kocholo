understands that the day aims to raise awareness of the importance of sign language and focuses on people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and people with speech disorders; further understands that early access to sign language, and services in sign language, including quality education available in sign language, is vital to the growth and development of deaf people, and recognises what it sees as the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity.\n\nThat the Parliament acknowledges that Alzheimer Scotland’s Memory Walk in Glasgow will take place on 29 September 2024, to walk in memory and in honour of loved ones; notes that people across Scotland will come together to participate in the Your Walk, Your Way campaign, where people can choose where they want to walk, who they walk with and who they want to walk for;

understands that Memory Walks across Scotland have so far raised over £1 million since the campaign began, helping to provide crucial support across the country for people with dementia, their families and carers;

understands that sepsis arises when the body’s response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs, which may lead to shock, multi-organ failure and death, particularly if not recognised early and treated promptly; notes that the day hopes to increase public awareness and show support for people who have lost loved ones, or are sepsis survivors, and understands that the UK Sepsis Trust has joined forces with St Andrew's First Aid to raise awareness of sepsis in Scotland by providing the Scottish charity with literature encouraging people to \"Just ask: could it be sepsis?\", as well as Z-cards showing the symptoms in both adults and children.\n\nThat the Parliament congratulates Graeme Reid, of Findochty, on becoming a European powerlifting champion at the recent European Bench Press Championships held in Istanbul, breaking the Scottish lifting record twice in the process, first setting a new record of 230kg only to break it again with a lift of 240kg, and recognises what it sees as Graeme's level of dedication and sacrifice to compete on the world stage.\n\nThat the Parliament congratulates the eight venues in Aberdeen Central that have been nominated in the Food Awards Scotland 2024;

understands that this is the first time that it has provided its services for the people who live or work in the Scottish Borders; believes that credit unions such as this have an important role in providing ethical financial services and reducing people’s reliance on such things as payday loans and doorstep lenders, which often charge extremely high interest rates; considers that this is particularly important for those on low incomes who may have difficulties accessing basic banking services, and wishes all at Caledonian Credit Union the best in this endeavour.\n\nThat the Parliament welcomes 2024's Scotland Loves Local week, which is taking place from 26 August to 1 September;

understands that for this year's Scotland Loves Local Week, following the success of the inaugural week in 2023, the campaign is working with local civic and community leaders, businesses and social enterprises, as well as local representatives, to promote what it sees as the significant impact of localism and support local organisations and communities; notes the wide range of organisations across the country, including in Orkney, that are taking part in Scotland Loves Local week this year; commends the Scotland Loves Local campaign's efforts to promote localism and local communities across Scotland;
