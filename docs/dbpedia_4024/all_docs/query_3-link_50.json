Nicole began her career with the company in 2001. With over 2 decades of experience in the hotel industry, Nicole demonstrates exemplary standards of professional character in her day to day business dealings. Her \"grit, ethical decision making, and dedication to a robust business community\" were strong traits expressed in her nomination for the award. She is devoted to Historic Main Street Merchant activities that bring visitors to the island to stimulate the local economy, such as Death By Chocolate, Search for Shamrocks and Annual Tree Lighting. Volunteering at local events such as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival and Oyster Festival are but two of the ways she gives back to the community. Arranging food drives, helping plan weddings, and providing alternative prom photo opportunities from the hotel balconies when weather is an obstacle are a few more. Nicole's \"tireless commitment to the health and well being of the entire Chincoteague business community\" sets her aside as the Chincoteague Chamber of Commerce 2024 Leonard \"Buddy\" Burton Business Person of the Year.\n\nThe Chincoteague Chamber Of Commerce Proudly Honors The 2024 John White Shields Outstanding Citizens Of The Year\n\nThe Chincoteague Chamber of Commerce 2024 John White Shields Citizen of the Year Award was presented to David Landsberger. David has lived on Chincoteague for over 15 years, supporting numerous projects financially and through his time, energy, and creative ideas. His vision for ways to improve the quality of life in our community here on the Eastern Shore of Virginia shines in every project he touches. He has been instrumental in assisting the Island Theatre Performing Arts Center renovation, the Island Community House, Brianna's Kindness Park, Chincoteague Island Food Closet, Museum of Chincoteague Island/Beebe Ranch Acquisition, Chincoteague Cultural Alliance, Chincoteague Island Library Endowment, the David Landsberger Family YMCA, Eastern Shore Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the Eastern Shore Community College to name a few. David's leadership and \"efforts have significantly contributed to the welfare of the community\" for both residents and visitors, according to one nomination ballot. Another person wrote, \"I've found that David's inclination has been to support projects that help to make a community whole.\" The projects mentioned here certainly attest to that belief and was a deciding factor in the committee's choice for the Chincoteague Chamber of Commerce 2024 John White Shields Citizen of the Year."
