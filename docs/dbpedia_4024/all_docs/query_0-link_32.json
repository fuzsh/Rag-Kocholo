Its purpose was to support pupils with special educational needs and disabilities prepare for the world of work by providing them with work-based placements on our Birmingham Children's Hospital project. ✨ The South Bank Quay project delivered significant social value through job creation, skills development, and investment in the Teesside area. Achieving a Social and Economic Value of 177% against the original target, investing £188,000 in charities and local community groups, along with 227 hours of volunteering, 24 weeks of work placements and four apprenticeships to local young people. ✨ CRE8 is our pre-employment initiative that creates long-term job opportunities for local disadvantaged people. It involves training, site-based work experience, job opportunities and follow-on career advice – making CRE8 the first wraparound initiative of its kind in construction. It has continued to evolve, recently being adopted by our GRAHAM Interior Fit-Out Division who delivered an Armed Forces targeted programme. We look forward to attending the awards ceremony in November in London – good luck to all finalists. #Construction #CivilEngineering #CNWorkforce Steven Mackinder Louise Seddon Pam Green Gary Redpath Stephen Hughes\n\nHats off to Jane McCarron, Trainee Planner with GRAHAM Building! Jane recently returned from Canada upon completion of an ‘Optimizing High Performance Building Design’ course at Humber College in Toronto. Jane was selected to attend the course following an application and interview process, giving her the unique opportunity of learning from leading Professors in sustainability and high-performance buildings. While there she became Carbon Literacy Certified and developed a deeper understanding of the built environment’s role in supporting climate change mitigation, adaption, and resilience. She also gained extensive knowledge in the principles of Passivhaus and high-performance design techniques and how they can benefit the construction industry and society. To cap it all, she ended her trip by representing the students at the closing ceremony. We congratulate Jane on her success and know that this experience will only further enhance her studies as a Higher Level Apprentice in Construction Engineering with Surveying, and support the valuable contribution she makes to the GRAHAM team. #apprentice #construction #planning #teamGRAHAM South West College Ulster University Ray Ferguson\n\n📢 GRAHAM consortium selected as preferred bidder for University of Manchester Fallowfield campus redevelopment 📢 Viridis, a consortium of Equitix (infrastructure investor, developer and manager), GRAHAM Group (investor and contractor) and Derwent FM (facilities management), has been selected as preferred bidder and delivery partner for the redevelopment of the The University of Manchester’s Fallowfield Campus redevelopment under a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) model.

Whilst the flags are a colourful addition to the grey skies of June, they symbolise the inclusive environments we aim to create through open dialogue and psychological safety. As a platinum member of Investors in People and IIP Wellbeing we push for diversity within our business and our industry, tackling homophobia and encouraging more LGBTQIA+ people to consider working in construction. Hollie M Cregan MIoL (she/her) Head of FIR at GRAHAM said: “We take steps to ensure the environment in GRAHAM is reflective of the society in which we work. Respect is a core value and underpins our relationships with colleagues, partners, clients and the public. We continuously look to improve our workforce culture, ultimately creating a respectful, inclusive working environment for all.” As one of the UK’s leading construction, fit out and FM companies, we are acutely aware of the need to champion Fairness, Inclusion & Respect in construction and help the industry develop inclusive workplace cultures. #construction #edi #pride2024\n\n✨ Finalist in six categories at CEF Awards ✨ GRAHAM Group is delighted to have been shortlisted in six categories at Construction Employers Federation (CEF) Excellence Awards 2024: ➡ Sustainable Company of the Year ➡ Excellence in the Use of Construction Technology ➡ Infrastructure Projects of the Year – Transport & Utilities Infrastructure Project of the Year above £10m: York Street Redevelopment Project ➡ Health Project of the Year: Maternity Unit at Royal Victoria Hospital ➡ Social Value Project of the Year: Seagahan Clear Water Tank Project ➡ GB & ROI General Construction Projects of the Year – Projects above £5m: Pall Mall Press Read more here: https://bit.ly/3xKFBZM #construction #civilengineering #CEFawards24 Lianne Taylor Andrew Crawford Lorraine Harrison John Deery Ciaran Moohan Jonathan Hall Peter Reavey Nick Williamson-Corbett\n\n📣We are thrilled to be shortlisted in 2 categories at the London Construction Awards: ➡ CONSTRUCTION SOFTWARE OF THE YEAR: GRAHAM-DESIGNED, SHE ONLINE PORTAL ➡ EXCELLENCE IN SUSTAINABILITY – PROJECT: REARDON COURT Designed in-house by GRAHAM Group with an external software developer, our SHE reporting and analysis portal captures the timeous reporting of all incidents, observations and disciplines across the 3 strands of SHE.

Let’s hear from Grace Jackson, Site Engineer, Beth Paterson, Building Site Engineer and Hannah Garrett, Building Services Manager. 📢Grace achieved a well-deserved second place in the recent Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Emerging Engineers Award. Her award-winning presentation explored the evolving role of a modern engineer, highlighting the diverse skillset required to tackle society's pressing challenges. To ignite an interest in civil engineering among young people, Grace created an interactive quiz game, an engaging tool that allows them to discover the breadth of the role and serves as an inspiration for the next generation of engineers. 📢Beth is a Building Site Engineer in Glasgow and joined GRAHAM in 2018 as an Apprentice Trainee Engineer. She has been involved in multiple projects during her time with the business including our recently completed Candleriggs Square Build-to-Rent development where she gained valuable experience that she will be able to transfer onto her next project at Bonnington Road in Edinburgh. 📢Hannah began her career in site team administration, moved into computer-aided design (CAD), before settling on a career in engineering. She was sponsored through her degree, achieving BEng (Hons) while working. Hannah believes diversity and inclusion opens up better innovation in construction; introducing fresh voices allows new ways of looking at a problem and finding innovative solutions. The construction industry has moved forward greatly from when she joined it over fifteen years ago. As more women continue to enter the industry, more opportunities are available - helping to see the bigger picture of change for women engineers in construction. #INWED24 #womenengineers #celebrate GRAHAM Group GRAHAM Building GRAHAM Civil Engineering"
