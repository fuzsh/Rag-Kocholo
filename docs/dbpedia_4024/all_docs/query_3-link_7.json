        "text": "Dr Graham Leonard In 2006 Dr. Leonard developed MaHakkaat at-Tafkir, a discussion program in Arabic for the Ministry of Education in Jordan for 6th–9th graders. He currently spends half the year training teacher trainers who implement this program in the public schools. He just completed work on a book in conjunction with the Minister of Education in Jordan: Re-Defining Arab Education for the 21st Century.\n\nDr. Leonard received his PhD in Education from Harvard University. A lifelong educator, he worked at UNESCO, UNDP, UNRWA, and International Planned Parenthood. Among his many achievements he has taught at the Friends School in Ramallah (1950–51, 55–57), Birzeit University, and was Dean of Students and Associate Professor Humanities at the American University of Beirut (1960–63).\n\nAs an instructor he helped to create the Department of Education at the Experimental State University of New York (1970–73). He was visiting professor at National Teachers University, Beijing, Peoples Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution (1979–81).\n\nDr. Leonard is a fluent speaker of Jordanian colloquial Arabic and French. At the age of ninety four Dr. Leonard continues to work passionately and tirelessly in the field of education.\n\nFew \"foreign experts\" understand as deeply the vital distinction between modernization and westernization, which is a theme that pervades Dr. Leonard's consciousness and influences much of what he has to tell us concerning educational reform. As evidence from his work, he can dissect these two elements, modernization and westernization, with the skill of a surgeon performing a delicate operation to separate unwanted tissue from living, healthy tissue. This requires a life-time of careful attention to the differences among cultures, much of which Dr. Leonard acquired through more than 65 years of work in the Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Leonard has a deep and broad knowledge of the history, theory and practice of education in the West, its failures and its progress.Unlike many educators, his perspective is not one of narrow specialization but a broad yet detailed understanding of all aspects of society that interact and influence education whether we like it or not.\n\nDeep moral commitment to all that is good in man guides Dr.Leonard always. He has devoted his life to education because he is aware that only through education can progress be made which allows every society to become creative and self-sufficient, not dependent on the ideas and then therefore the power of other nations.\n\nDr. Diya Abdo is Associate Professor of English and current Chair of the Department of English and Creative Writing at Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina. A first-generation Palestinian, born and raised in Jordan, she received her B.A. in English Language and Literature (1996) from Yarmouk University in Jordan and her M.A. (1998) and Ph.D. (2005) from Drew University in New Jersey. Her Ph.D. dissertation entitled Double Agent: Fatima Mernissi’s Interventions in the Narratives of the Self, the Nation, and the Other examines the textual and paratextual strategies of Islamic feminisms with an emphasis on the Islamic feminist and sociologist Fatima Mernissi. Her dissertation won the university’s Mary Pennywitt Lester Dissertation Prize for “an outstanding dissertation written in English literature or modern history and literature.”\n\nDiya has published papers in Life Writing, Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Pacific Coast Philology, Image and Narrative, Women’s Studies Quarterly, Eugene O’Neill Review, The Journal of Lesbian Studies, and MLA’s Approaches to Teaching the Works of Assia Djebar as well as anthologies on Anglophone Arab writers and women writers. Her research and scholarship center on Arab women writers, autobiography, Islamic feminism, comparative literature, and postcolonial translation with a particular interest in Arab women writers’ narrative strategies, life writing, and the cross-cultural translation of autobiography.\n\nRecently, Diya has published fiction in Journal: New Writing on Justice (her short story “The Love Hoard” is nominated for a Pushcart Prize), poetry inStorm Cellar, and creative non-fiction in Eno Publisher’s 27 Views of Greensboro and forthcoming in Bad Girls of the Arab World. Her short memoir “Bad Girl” won the Honorable Mention Award for Creative Nonfiction in the Center for Women Writers 2015 International Literary Awards. Her public essays, which have appeared in Jadaliyya, The Feminist Wire, and The Electronic Intifada, focus on the intersection between identity and vocation.\n\nDiya is a passionate teacher and adviser. In 2008, after teaching in Jordan for several years, she took a tenure-track position at Guilford College. In April 2010, she was awarded Guilford’s “Dick Dyer Award for Outstanding Academic and Personal Advising,” in April 2012 was awarded Guilford College’s top teaching honor—the “Bruce B. Stewart Award for Teaching Excellence,” and in 2013 was awarded Guilford’s top advising honor “Board of Visitors Award for Excellence in Academic Advising.”\n\nDiya enjoys teaching composition, World Literature, Postcolonial Literature, American Literature, Arab Women Writers, and Arab and Islamic Feminisms. She also enjoys sharing her research and has presented at many national and international conferen\n\nces and given public lectures at universities here and abroad.
