There could be several reasons that your name does not appear in what you believe to be the appropriate giving levelâ€”or not appear at all:\n\nYou made your qualifying gift after June 30, 2022.\n\nYou gave more before June 30, 2022, than you realize; your name may be in the next giving level.\n\nYou made a pledge instead of an outright gift; this list reflects gifts received.\n\nYour planned gift is not documented by the UGA Foundation, or you have withdrawn your planned gift between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022."
