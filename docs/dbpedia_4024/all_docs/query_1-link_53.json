        "text": "Computing, Data, and Society fellows conduct cutting-edge research in computing and data science, broadly construed, with the potential for direct or indirect societal benefits.\n\nExample areas of focus include Algorithmic Fairness, Ethical AI, Explainable AI, Disinformation, Algorithmic Economics, Privacy, Security, smart grid, sustainable computing; applied mathematics, core computer science, and control theory with applications to climate, energy, water, transportation, medicine, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, agriculture, and sociology.\n\nThe Kortschak Scholars Program was founded in 2017 with the objective of launching a new era of scholarship, inquiry, and innovation in computing and mathematical sciences at Caltech. Caltech trustee and venture capitalist Walter Kortschak (MS '82), with his wife, Marcia, created the program through a $5 million gift for endowed graduate fellowships.\n\nMore information about the Kortschak Scholars Program can be found here.\n\nThe Ben P.C. Chou Doctoral Prize recognizes outstanding doctoral dissertations in the broad area of information science and technology. The Prize was established by his wife, June, and his son, Scott (BS 1986), as a lasting tribute for Ben's lifetime dedication to the pursuit of scholarly research and foregoing personal gain in favor of always doing the right thing for society.\n\nProfessor Pen-chu \"Ben\" Chou was born in China and suffered a childhood disrupted by a revolutionary war that ultimately took his father. At the age of 13, his mother took him and his two younger sisters to Taiwan as war refugees where she raised the three of them on her own. Prof Chou went on to complete his undergraduate at Tunghai University, his master's degree at the University of Missouri, and his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma. He spent the bulk of his career doing research and teaching at The Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston and Jilin University in Changchun, China. Prof Chou is noted for his pioneering contributions in developing photoreactivity for thin film superconductors and helping establish OCEF, an international charitable foundation headquartered in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Northrop Grumman Prize for Excellence in Teaching is awarded to an EAS professor or lecturer who demonstrates, in the broadest sense, unusual ability, creativity, and innovation in undergraduate and graduate classroom or laboratory teaching.\n\nThe Northrup Grumman Prize is awarded EAS-wide and the following CMS professors have been recipients of the award. The full list of recipients can be found here.\n\nThe CMS and IST Gradient for Change Awards honor students, postdocs, staff, and faculty in the Caltech community who demonstrate exceptional efforts to make Caltech and/or the broader scientific community a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. The awards recognize and highlight individual contributors or small teams who are considered agents of change, community leaders, and/or allies to historically marginalized group(s) in the information sciences, including computer science, applied mathematics, and beyond.\n\nMore information can be found here.\n\nDepartment of Computing and Mathematical Sciences Award for Excellence in Mentoring\n\nThe Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences Award for Excellence in Mentoring is given to outstanding alumni mentors who consistently provide invaluable advice, time, and connections to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. These mentors are able to connect with a diverse group of young scientists and engineers, promoting opportunity for all, and supporting an informed, confident community."
