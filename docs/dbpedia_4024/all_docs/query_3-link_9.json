He was able to make a successful crash landing in a paddock.\n\nAs part of the Empire Air Training Scheme he finished his training in Canada and after graduating as a Sergeant Pilot he was posted to the UK\n\nFrom there he was attached to Number 37 Squadron (37SQN) RAF in the Middle East flying Wellington bombers over Italy - he was awarded the DFM (Distinguished Flying Medal) for his sinking of enemy shipping in Palermo Harbour\n\nUpon being commissioned as a Flying Officer he returned to Australia and was posted to Number 1 Operational Training Unit (1OTU) based at East Sale in Victoria for Flying Instructor duties - unfortunately he was killed in a collision between a motor bus and his bicycle on Heart Road, East Sale, Victoria"
