He will be in charge of the Rams’ defensive line again in 2023.\n\nLast fall, the Fordham defense led the Patriot League in sacks (2.42/game) and placed second second in tackles for loss (5.8/game). The defensive line had a hand in those rankings, led by Jonathan Coste, who had 9.0 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks, both second best in the team as he earned First Team All-Patriot League honors.\n\nIn 2021, Leonard's defensive line helped the Rams rank third in the Patriot League in fumbles recovered, 20th in the NCAA FCS, and rank third in the League in both tackles for loss and sacks per game.\n\nLeonard arrived at Rose Hill after five seasons on the Indiana University of Pennsylvania coaching staff where he led the Crimson Hawks' defensive line group from 2016-2020 before being promoted to linebackers coach in 2021.\n\nDuring his stay at IUP, the Crimson Hawks compiled a 41-8 (.838) overall record in his four seasons (the 2020 season was canceled). Leonard helped the team to three NCAA Division II playoff appearances, including a national semifinal berth, and a PSAC Championship in 2017.\n\nAt IUP, Leonard led and coached two All-Americans, seven All-Super Region One selections, and nine All-PSAC West picks. Rotating up to ten players along the defensive front in any given year, Leonard's group combined for 111 sacks and 195.5 tackles-for-loss over that span.\n\nLeonard arrived at IUP from West Virginia University, where he was the defensive graduate assistant and assistant linebackers coach for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. A former All-Big East linebacker at WVU, Leonard spent two seasons at his alma mater, helping the Mountaineers to Liberty Bowl and Cactus Bowl invitations.\n\nAssisting with the linebackers, he mentored first team All-American Nick Kwiatkoski and honorable mention All-Big 12 selection Jared Barber. Leonard coached Shaq Petteway, who earned Defensive Player of the Game honors at the 2016 Cactus Bowl. He also assisted with the Western Pennsylvania and South Florida recruiting areas.\n\nLeonard went to WVU after coaching the defensive line at West Virginia Wesleyan in 2013. He saw Marcus Spearman earn second team All-Mountain East honors while also serving as the program's assistant director for strength and conditioning.\n\nLeonard got his coaching career off the ground after suiting up for West Virginia. A three-year team captain, he earned All-Big East honors in helping the Mountaineers' defense rank second nationally in 2010. He played in four bowl games at WVU – the 2008 Fiesta Bowl, 2008 Meinicke Car Care Bowl, 2009 Gator Bowl, and 2010 Champs Sports Bowl – and also earned the program's Gridiron Gladiator and Hammer Awards in his final season.\n\nA 2010 graduate of WVU in 2010, Leonard received a degree in athletic coaching education and received a master’s degree in communication from the school in 2015. He spent time in the New England Patriots camp in 2011 after signing as a rookie free agent.\n\nLeonard graduated from McKeesport Area High School in 2006, where he was a first team All-State and All-WPIAL player an helped the Tigers to 2005 WPIAL and PIAA championships."
