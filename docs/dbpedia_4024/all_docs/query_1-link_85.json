Contributions to the science and profession of petroleum geology may be in particular areas or combinations of discovery thinking, application, exploration leadership, research, etc. Distinguished service to the petroleum industry may have brought favorable reflection on both the geologic profession and the Association.\n\nProcedure for Recommendation\n\nNominations for this award should be submitted, along with documentation, to the Chairman of the Honors and Awards Committee at Association Headquarters. The Committee’s recommendations will be submitted to the Advisory Council, which in turn will submit its selection to the Executive Committee for final action.\n\nDescription of Award\n\nThis award is a walnut chest. When opened, the right panel displays the AAPG emblem. Beneath the emblem is a plate bearing the recipients name, the designation “AAPG Honorary Member,” and the year awarded. The left panel has a plate bearing the signed citation.\n\nHistory\n\nThe award of Honorary Member was established in 1919. It was elevated to third honors position and given “medal” status by Executive Committee action in 1974. The medal bore the AAPG seal on the obverse side, with the recipient’s name, the designation “AAPG Honorary Member,” and the year awarded on the reverse side. It was worn on a neck ribbon assembly. In 1982, the Executive Committee approved changing the award to a walnut chest containing the appropriate presentation data.\n\nFunding\n\nThe AAPG provides funding for the Honorary Member Award."
