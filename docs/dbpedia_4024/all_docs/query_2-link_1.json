His ...",

        "text": "“Dr. Graham Leonard has strong views about education in the Arab world. These views are right on. They are transformational. Perhaps that is partly why we have yet to fully realize them. For decades, Dr. Leonard has been fighting for three main transformations in Arab education: speaking and writing in Modern Standard Arabic; engaging all students in Arab liberal studies, history of science, and humanities; and critical thinking through debate and dialogue. These might all seem non-controversial, and some people might think we are already practicing them. Neither is true. Indeed, these ideas, if taken seriously, would be transformational. To be clear, it will take a decade at least to make the changes needed in curricula, teacher training, and cultural shifts of students and parents. But it will be a revolution, or perhaps the revolution, the Arab world needs to come to terms with its history and its future. In my own experience as Minister of Education, working with Dr. Leonard and with pioneers in the Ministry of Education, I sensed firsthand the bureaucratic push back. It was not hard to start “Mahakkaat at-Tafkir” (Touchstones for Thinking) as a pilot. It was indeed a great success. What was challenging, however, is to integrate it into the curriculum and teacher training.\n\nMaking the above transformations is critical for an Arab renaissance. It will require patience, but also a clear long-term vision with clear targets that involves society as a whole."
