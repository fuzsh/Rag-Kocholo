        "text": "The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration that may be bestowed upon members of the British or Commonwealth armed forces for acts of valour or gallantry performed in the face of the enemy. Within the British honours system and those of many Commonwealth nations it is the highest award a soldier can receive for actions in combat. It was established in 1856 and since then has been awarded 1,356 times, including three service personnel who were awarded the VC twice.[1]\n\nThe VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. The traditional explanation of the source of the gunmetal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins.[2] The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the London Gazette regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not \"officially\" awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men.[3] The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.[4][5]\n\nDue to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal has fetched over £400,000 at auction.[6] A number of public and private collections are devoted to the Victoria Cross. The private collection of Lord Ashcroft, amassed since 1986, contains over one-tenth of all VCs awarded. Following a 2008 donation to the Imperial War Museum, the Ashcroft collection went on public display alongside the museum's Victoria and George Cross collection in November 2010.[7] Since 1990, three Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as head of state have instituted their own versions of the VC. As a result, the original Victoria Cross is sometimes referred to as the \"Commonwealth Victoria Cross\" or the \"Imperial Victoria Cross\", to distinguish it from the newer awards.[8][9]\n\nThe Corps of Royal Engineers can trace its origins back 900 years, during which time they have been involved in every major conflict the British Army has fought in. The Royal Flying Corps – the forerunner of the Royal Air Force – and the present day Royal Signals were originally part of the Corps.[10] Their first recipient of the Victoria Cross received the award for actions performed during the Crimean War, while the last came during the Second World War. In total, thirty-six Royal Engineers have been awarded the Victoria Cross, across ten different conflicts or campaigns.[10]\n\nRoyal Engineer recipients[]\n\nName Date Conflict Location 001 !Adam Archibald 19181104 !4 November 1918 First World War Sambre–Oise Canal[11] 002 !Fenton Aylmer 18911202 !2 December 1891 Hunza-Nagar Campaign Nilt[12] 003 !Mark Sever Bell 18740204 !4 February 1874 Third Anglo-Ashanti War Ordashu[13] 004 !John Chard 18790122 !22–23 January 1879 Anglo-Zulu War Rorke's Drift[14] 005 !Brett Cloutman 19181106 !6 November 1918 First World War Pont-sur-Sambre[15] 006 !Clifford Coffin 19170731 !31 July 1917 First World War Westhoek[16] 007 !James Morris Colquhoun Colvin 18970916 !16–17 September 1897 First Mohmand Campaign Mohmand Valley[17] 008 !James Lennox Dawson 19151013 !13 October 1915 First World War Hohenzollern Redoubt[18] 009 !Robert James Thomas Digby-Jones 19000106 !6 January 1900 Second Boer War Ladysmith[19] 010 !Thomas Frank Durrant 19420328 !28 March 1942 Second World War St Nazaire[20][nb 1] 011 !Howard Craufurd Elphinstone 18550618 !18 June 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[21] 012 !George de Cardonnel Elmsall Findlay 19181104 !4 November 1918 First World War Sambre–Oise Canal[22] 013 !Gerald Graham 18550618 !18 June 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[23] 014 !William Hackett 19160622 !22–23 June 1916 First World War Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée[24] 015 !Reginald Clare Hart 18790131 !31 January 1879 Second Anglo-Afghan War Bazar Valley[25] 016 !Lanoe Hawker 19150725 !25 July 1915 First World War Passendale[26][nb 2] 017 !Charles Jarvis 19140823 !23 August 1914 First World War Jemappes[27] 018 !Frederick Henry Johnson 19150925 !25 September 1915 First World War Hill 70[28] 019 !William Henry Johnston 19140914 !14 September 1914 First World War Missy-sur-Aisne[29] 020 !Frank Howard Kirby 19000602 !2 June 1900 Second Boer War Delagoa Bay[30] 021 !Cecil Leonard Knox 19180322 !22 March 1918 First World War Tugny[31] 022 !Edward Pemberton Leach 18790317 !17 March 1879 Second Anglo-Afghan War Maidanah[32] 023 !Peter Leitch 18550618 !18 June 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[21] 024 !William James Lendrim 18550214 !14 February 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[23] 025 !Wilbraham Lennox 18541120 !20 November 1854 Crimean War Sevastopol[23] 026 !Henry MacDonald 18550419 !19 April 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[21] 027 !Edward Mannock 19180717 !17 June 1918\n\n7 July 1918\n\n14 July 1918\n\n19 July 1918\n\n20 July 1918\n\n22 July 1918 First World War Western Front[33][nb 3] 028 !Cyril Gordon Martin 19150312 !12 March 1915 First World War Spanbroek Molen[34] 029 !James McPhie 19181014 !14 October 1918 First World War Sensée Canal[35] 030 !Philip Neame 19141219 !19 December 1914 First World War Neuve-Chapelle[36] 031 !John Perie 18550618 !18 June 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[23] 032 !Claud Raymond 19450321 !21 March 1945 Second World War Talaku[37] 033 !John Ross 18550721 !21 July 1855 Crimean War Sevastopol[23] 034 !Michael Sleavon 18580403 !3 April 1858 Indian Mutiny Jhansi[38] 035 !Thomas Colclough Watson 18970916 !16 September 1897 First Mohmand Campaign Mohmand Valley[17] 036 !Arnold Horace Santo Waters 19181104 !4 November 1918 First World War Sambre–Oise Canal[39] 037 !Theodore Wright 19140823 !23 August 1914 First World War Jemappes[40]\n\nReferences[]\n\nFootnotes\n\nCitations"
