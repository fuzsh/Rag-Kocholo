        "text": "Patriot League men’s and women’s indoor track and field athletes are in full swing as nine men’s programs and 10 women’s programs prepare for the 33rd Patriot League Indoor Track and Field Championships next month. The Navy women look for their fifth-consecutive League title, while the Midshipmen men look to capture their fourth-consecutive Leage title, and their ninth in the past 10 seasons.\n\nThe teams will compete regularly over the next several weeks before participating in the Patriot League Indoor Track and Field Championships at Boston University’s Track and Tennis Center on February 24-25, 2024.\n\nAmerican Eagles\n\nHead Coach: Sean Graham (Seventh Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Sixth – 27 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 13\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Ninth – 2 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 19\n\nCoach Sean Graham on the Eagles’ Men…\n\n“The men’s team has a great opportunity to build on the growing success found on the track last year. Now with more experienced sophomore and junior athletes that raced their way to finals in the championships and veteran seniors and fifth years who have consistently been in finals and scoring spots in their respective individual events or relays. In addition to that we have a great group of freshman sprinters and distance athletes ready to make their presence seen on the track. We missed the mark a little in cross country this past fall and the team is hungry to show what they're capable of on the track.”\n\nCoach Graham on the Eagles’ Women...\n\n“After a season that placed athletes across nearly every event’s top-10 list, this year’s group will take on the goal of continuing to set records and personal bests as well as improving on last year’s depth. Building on the momentum that the 2023 group created, we will rely on the experience of our upperclassmen like June Mwaniki, who will be eyeing school records held by historic names, and Rachel Potter who has been a cultural leader on the team since she walked on campus five years ago, as well as Luci Ianello and Kirah Tianga who both made massive jumps in their 2023 cross country campaign. In addition, a talented freshman class is looking to set a new standard for AU Track. Names like Lorelei Bangit, Hannah Puckett, Estella Miller, and Ciera Thacker (who has already set a school record in the 60 back in December) are all ones to watch move the needle this year.”\n\nArmy West Point Black Knights\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country: Mike Smith (Eighth Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Third – 132.5 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 17\n\nMen’s Key Returners: Cameron Smith, Ethan Hesson, Brian Matthews, Luke Griner\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Third – 131.25 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 22\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Kayley Ragazinni, Barbara Antwi, Charlotte Richman, Lindsey Smith, Holli Chapman\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country Mike Smith on the Black Knights’ Men…\n\n“Last year I felt as though our men’s team had some holes in key events. This year appears to be a completely different story. In the short sprints, we have a great group of men that I believe will get the job done in our championship season. Our distance men continue to be one of the strongest in the conference, and I will be expecting a lot out of them. We have some good jumpers, and we’ve got a good young group of throwers. I am impressed with how these groups trained throughout the fall, and I am looking forward to putting that hard work to the test. It appears that we trained well over the winter break, so I feel even more confident that we have a lot of potential as long as we remain healthy. We have a good shot at being near the top of the conference, and who knows what we can do if our team executes like I know they are capable of at the conference championship.”\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country Mike Smith on the Black Knights’ Women…\n\n“I think we have a very good women’s team. We have a lot of depth, youth, and veterans. That is a good combination. This fall was very productive: we learned a lot about our team through training and the Cross Country season, and I believe that success will continue on the track. Where we once had holes or felt like we lacked depth, we now have options and a lot of talent. I feel good about our depth in the field events and on the track. We also have a group of veterans who have been leading our team for the past couple of years. One that stands out is Kayley Ragazzini in the throws. She was very dominant in the Patriot League last year, and I believe that success will continue. In the sprints, we have a veteran group of women who are proven performers, and we have a good influx of rookies in the jumps. Overall, I think we are headed in a good direction.”\n\nBoston University Terriers\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country: Gabe Sanders (Fifth Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Second – 137 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 31\n\nMen’s Key Returners: Foster Malleck, Dakota Jackson, Steven Franco, Leon Christian, Parker Schneider, Max Gorriaran, Uchenna Nwosu, Matt Spicer, Ryan Rosenberger\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Second – 146 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 37\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Jada Smith, Daisy Liljegren, Vera Sjöberg, Emma Lawrence, Asia Hamilton, Isabela Shepard\n\nCoach Sanders on the Terriers’ Men…\n\n“Coming off a monumental indoor season in 2023, that saw our program return to the podium after seven years with a runner-up finish at the league championships, we look to build on that momentum and push harder towards bringing home our first league team title.”\n\nCoach Sanders on the Terriers’ Women...\n\n“This is one of the most well-balanced teams we’ve had in a long time. With a number of high-end returners and league champions throughout the program, alongside fresh new faces that will have an immediate impact, we feel confident BU can approach returning to the heights of when we first entered the league.”\n\nBucknell Bison\n\nHead Coach: Kevin Donner (23rd Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Fifth – 51.5 points\n\nMen’s Returning Letterwinners: 24\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Fourth – 78.25 points\n\nWomen’s Returning Letterwinners: 23\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Lila Gaughan, Karen Hill, Katherine Loew, Meghan Quinn, Olivia Boyce\n\nCoach Donner on the Bison Men…\n\n\"I felt we underperformed in 2023 due to injuries and inconsistency. We got off to a nice start in our December meet and we are way ahead of where we were a year ago. We brought in some nice freshmen who can contribute right away and we returned the bulk of our points from last year.”\n\nCoach Donner on the Bison Women...\n\n\"This might be our best women's team since 2017 and we have a great nucleus of veterans that cover all the event groups. Scoring points in every event at the league meet is an attainable goal. The key will be staying healthy.”\n\nColgate Raiders\n\nHead Coach: Chelsea France (Second Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Ninth – 13 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 29\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: Cole Blair, Ben Krill, Ryan Krill, Dylan Wehrly, Ethan Eisner\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: 10th – 1 point\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 14\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Carollin Mellin, Clare Gillis, Sara Tabibian\n\nCoach France on the Raiders’ Men...\n\n\"This year we have a mixture of young talent and experienced talent amongst our men's team. This group has big goals to continue to break school records and position themselves in scoring positions across events in our League. I'm excited to witness their hard work play out this season as we continue to build towards our goals.\"\n\nCoach France on the Raiders’ Women...\n\n\"Our women's program has the most depth we've seen in years. They are young, yet hungry to be successful, which has been an honor to witness as we build a team culture of competitive excellence. We are steering in the right direction and I'm confident in where our women's team is headed this indoor and outdoor season.\"\n\nHoly Cross Crusaders\n\nDirector of Cross Country and Track and Field: Egetta Alfonso (Second Season, 25th at Holy Cross)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Seventh – 18 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 23\n\nMen’s Key Returners: Chris Barone and Mike Mazzocca\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Sixth – 40 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 27\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Jane Feeney, Celia Kulis, Ella Grey, Molly O'Connor\n\nCoach Alfonso on the Crusaders Men…\n\n\"Our men's team will be led by scorers Michael Mazzocca and Christopher Barone. Also returning will be most of our key players from last year, who contributed to the team's efforts. We're eager to see how our group of skilled and promising first-year students will add to our competitiveness in the League.\"\n\nCoach Alfonso on the Crusaders Women...\n\n\"The women's team brings back several key scorers from previous years - Feeney, Kulis, Grey, and O'Connor - alongside a group of consistent performers aiming to make their mark in the League this year. Bolstered by promising incoming first-year students, the team is poised for an excellent season and will be competitive at the Patriot League Championships.\"\n\nLafayette Leopards\n\nHead Coach: Michelle Curcio (10th Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Ninth – 5 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 24\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Eighth – 10.5 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 28\n\nCoach Curcio on the Leopards’ Men…\n\n“Our men’s team is also quite young with 30 first-year and sophomores. We only lost one individual scorer from the 2023 indoor championships. We will look for Andrew Bowsher ’24, Roman Conca ’26, Ben Hill ’26, Jack Lynett ’25, John Paul Pfisterer, and AJ Sanford to step up into scoring positions. Outstanding newcomers include Alex Caba, Dexter DeMarco, John Liedtka, and Ivan Tejada. We will look for our men to move up in the team scores while the younger student-athletes learn what it takes to compete at the Patriot League level.”\n\nCoach Curcio on the Leopards’ Women…\n\n“We are a pretty young team with 30 first-year and Sophomores on the roster. The women had a bunch who just missed out on scoring opportunities at the League Championships in 2023. We are looking for many of them to take the next step and begin to look for scoring (and podium) finishes. Juliette Delmotte and Julia Greeley ’25 scored at the Indoor Championships last season, as did Ashleigh Lustgarten ’26 at the outdoors. Our team will also count on Melina Panagakos ’24, Nava Chevan ’25, Erin O’Leary, Liz Borah ’26, Maeve Waldron ’26, and Elena Malone ’26 to step up into scoring positions. We also have a group of strong first-years in Ida Moczerniuk, Gabby Buber, and Amanda Hoffman to add depth to the sprint and relays.”\n\nLehigh Mountain Hawks\n\nHead Coach: Khayla Atte (Second season, Fifth season at Lehigh)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Fourth – 61 points\n\nMen’s Letterwinners Returning: 18\n\nMen’s Key Returners: Ian Scott, Kevin Harvey, Gideon Coprivnicar, Patrez Thomas, Jack Murphy\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Fifth – 60.5 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 22\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Abby Klebe, Christina Yakaboski, Ashley Struck, Simone Davey, Lauryn Heskin, Laura Reigle, Svea Wickelgren.\n\nCoach Atte on the Mountain Hawks’ Men…\n\n\"The men's track and field program is off to a great start with fall preseason training and the men’s cross country program putting out pretty solid performances during their fall season. Our season openers gave us a pretty good opportunity to assess where we are as far as our training and what we need to work on. We have a lot of fresh faces and we’re excited to see how they will contribute to the program and how they learn and grow. We have some top veteran leadership and proven performers returning so I’m excited to see how they again can rise to the occasion and put themselves in the position to be top performers in the league as always. In addition to that, begin to help the new faces understand what it means to be part of a winning culture.\"\n\nCoach Atte on the Mountain Hawks’ Women…\n\n\"The women’s track and field program had a very solid preseason training and fall cross country season. We also have fresh faces on the women’s side and are excited to see what they can do. For the women, during their two season openers they proved they are here to make their mark and prove their point. Within the first two meets, we had a top-10 addition from a fresh face and two school records in the field and on the track. Our veteran leadership is very strong; we have several school record holders returning. The same as the men, I expect veteran leadership will not only prove their ability to walk back into the Patriot League Championship and produce but also help these new fresh faces understand what it means to be part of a winning culture. I think it’s exciting for the women, as well as the men, that they have the opportunity to participate in a sport that is not a single gender and not one type of athlete - it is a wonderful collection of many different types of athletes and people. I am excited to see what the women’s team does.\"\n\nLoyola Maryland Greyhounds\n\nHead Coach: Amy Horst (Eighth Season)\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: Seventh – 17 points\n\nWomen’s Letterwinners Returning: 17\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Jamie Adams, Lauryn Clarke, Isabella Coleman, Meghan Leonard\n\nHead coach Amy Horst on the Greyhounds…\n\n“Our women’s team is eager to enter the 2024 championship season having a strong indoor training camp in early January. The fall training block was foundational in developing our team community. With a focus on performing both as individuals and in relays, their tenacity will surely showcase the trust and development they’re putting into their holistic training!”\n\nNavy Midshipmen\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country: Jamie Cook (Seventh Season)\n\nMen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: First – 256 points\n\nNumber of Men’s Letterwinners Returning: 30\n\nMen’s Key Returners: Jacques Guillaume, Sam Keeny, Brahmir Vick, Nathan Kent, Carson Sloat, Matt Newell, Joshua Boamah, Nathan Kent, Jacques Guillaume, Sam Keeny, Walker Rudisaile, Aidan Fetherby, Sebasteon Allen, Collin Greene, Joshua Boamah.\n\nWomen’s 2023 Patriot League Indoor Championship Finish: First – 214.5 points\n\nNumber of Women’s Letterwinners Returning: 23\n\nWomen’s Key Returners: Ellie Abraham, McKenna Brophy, Mia-Claire Kezal, Alex Wercinski, Kayla McGuire, Jia Anderson, Annie Taylor, Emily Boutin, Hannah Lowenstein, Isabella Romasko.\n\nDirector of Track & Field/Cross Country Jamie Cook on the Midshipmen…\n\n“We are excited to start the 2024 season. The team is led by Annie Taylor and Joshua Boamah, both strong captains. They continue to lead by example as the squad improves each day at practice. We encourage everyone to support our program by coming out to Wesley Brown Field House for our four remaining home meets this indoor season.”\n\nPATRIOT LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nThe 2024 Patriot League Men's and Women's Indoor Track and Field Championships will be held at Boston University's Track & Tennis Center beginning Saturday, Feb. 24 and concluding on Sunday, Feb. 25. All nine men's programs and each of the 10 women's teams will compete.\n\nABOUT THE PATRIOT LEAGUE\n\nThe Patriot League is in its fourth decade of academic and athletic achievement, continually demonstrating that student-athletes can excel at both academics and athletics without sacrificing high standards.
