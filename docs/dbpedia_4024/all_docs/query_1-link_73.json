        "text": "Clifford Paul (C.P.) Johnson was born in March, 1909 and was raised on a farm in a French colony near New Orleans. He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, and taught at several locations in the South and Southwest. During the war, he served as a U.S.O. Director for the Government. Over time, C.P. obtained a master’s degree in School Administration from the University of Washington in 1951.\n\nC.P. and Dorothy married during the war and made their first home in Austin, Texas. They lived and taught in Austin for 14 years. The Johnsons relocated to Seattle where C.P. and Dorothy accepted teaching positions in the Shoreline School District.\n\nThe couple moved to Bothell in 1961 and held their positions in Shoreline until 1969, when C.P. became Northshore School District’s first Coordinator of Minority Studies. He brought to the Northshore community a new awareness of the values of ethnic diversity speaking often of the responsibilities schools and communities have to understand the contributions of all people. Dorothy too had a way of showing those she met, their worth, skills and untapped abilities."
