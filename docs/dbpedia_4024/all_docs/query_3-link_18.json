When his life ended tragically at age 24, his parents wanted to keep his memory alive in a way that would be meaningful to him. “Once he passed,” his father Leonard recalls, “we figured that a scholarship would be the best way to preserve and honor his memory by helping others achieve their goal to become a nurse.
