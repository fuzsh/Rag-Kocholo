The Society’s objective is to promote fellowship among people of similar intellectual interests beyond the limits of the classroom. It has the interests of the University at heart and directs its efforts toward expansion of Virginia’s influence and prestige. Undergraduates, graduate students, and members of the faculty and alumni are eligible for membership; they are selected on the basis of excellence in their field and contributions to the University. The Society meets regularly during the year to conduct business meetings, hear speakers, and hold elections for new members. Its activities culminate each year in a formal Spring banquet at which officers are elected, new members are initiated, and highly-coveted Raven awards are presented to people outstanding in their manifold contributions to the University. Each year four students from the medical school are elected."
