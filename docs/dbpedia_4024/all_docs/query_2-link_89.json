        "text": "Although the Rebels have had some pieces banged up so far through fall camp, those numbers currently pale in comparison to the numbers banged up back in the spring. It was one of the first things head coach Lane Kiffin highlighted when fall camp initially began.\n\nFinally, the staff has been able to get a better understanding of their personnel from an on-field standpoint.\n\nIn another case of looking to the NFL for guidance, Ole Miss has been trying to adopt a preseason model that's similar in some ways. Over the last few days of practice, Ole Miss would go from morning one day to evening the next, allowing more physical rest in between. However, they've made the absolute most of those shortened on-field times. In the interim, it's been a learning and more learning.\n\n\"We've had a lot of meetings and walkthroughs. Our format has changed over the years, especially a year ago where we don't practice as much, having more of an NFL model, talking to them about injury prevention and taking care of players, what they call a 'ramp up'. The first five days, which is drastically different from the way it used to be here, that a lot of people still do,\" Kiffin said on Monday. \"It's a little frustrating because for instance, five days and practicing three times. That's a lot of meeting times and walkthroughs, but I think it'll pay off long term for the players' bodies.\"\n\nOle Miss is still just a handful of practices in, with game week still two-and-a-half weeks away by the time of writing. This new training approach as made it a little tougher to find out the conditioning side of things, due to the limited sample size.\n\n\"It probably doesn't quite tell you as much about conditioning, because in the old days, there used to be two-a-day's every day. Even after that, people still practiced every day. The majority of camp, even when going back-to-back days in camp, it'll be a morning and not until night the next day. A full day-and-a-half off,\" Kiffin said, \"So you can't tell, which is okay, so that's why it's ramp up, gradually getting up there versus training for distance and running 20 miles the first day. It makes sense, but it's against our wiring as coaches.\"\n\n\"I really take each day one day at a time,\" Kiffin said. \"What can we improve on this day, versus 'hey, we're going to be here after eight practices.' I would say that I'm really pleased by a lot of players. There's not a ton of mistakes this early in camp, probably because of the less practice, so you're not as tired, and all the walkthroughs.\"\n\nOle Miss boasts an unprecedented amount of depth across the board this season, more than any other previous team in recent memory. That alone has bred competition across a number of position groups.\n\nInside the Rebels will be back out on the practice field on Thursday, Aug. 8. and Ole Miss will begin this 2024 campaign on Aug. 31 inside Vaught-Hemingway Stadium against Furman. Kickoff is set for 6 p.m. CT and can be seen on SECN+/ESPN+ or listened to on the Ole Miss Radio Network.\n\n\"We've got a lot of work in for the most part. We're really healthy so that's been good to be able to see the majority of the guys out there pretty much at full speed, being able to move guys around to see how things works together,\" Kiffin said."
