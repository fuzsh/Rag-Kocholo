In its selection of LSE Architects, the 2023 Firm Award jury cited the firm’s impressive growth in just 12 years, the quality of its work across a range of building types and scales, and the way LSE has challenged traditional assumptions about public process and inclusion.\n\nRead the press release.\n\n2021 Firm Award: LHB, Inc.\n\nWith 254 professionals working across a variety of disciplines and in offices in Duluth, Cambridge, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as Superior, Wisconsin, LHB has advanced sustainable design in our state and around the country through its design work and research.\n\nRead the press release.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe AIA Minnesota Firm Award is open to any individual firm or successor firm or organization of architects with an office in Minnesota. Prior recipients are eligible to resubmit after 10 years.\n\nChapters, committees, board members, or members may submit nominations.\n\nThe AIA Minnesota Firm Award nomination and selection process takes place every two years, although there is no obligation for the Firm Award Selection Committee to make the award in any given year.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nThe Firm Award Selection Committee evaluates candidates based on how well they meet program criteria, which include how firms have:\n\nDemonstrated great depth and breadth in their work, having a cumulative effect on the profession of architecture in Minnesota;\n\nProduced work that is a product of a collaborative environment, consistently addressing the future of architecture while honoring its tradition;\n\nTranscended or united specific areas of expertise; and\n\nBecome widely known—by architects, designers, educators, and the public—for the quality of their work.\n\nAdditional selection considerations\n\nThroughout the submission, where applicable and to the extent possible, nominators are encouraged to highlight any aspect of work that may have reflected contributions or sensitivity concerning areas of special interest to or the strategic priorities of AIA Minnesota, its members, and the architecture profession in Minnesota, including but not limited to the policy and position statements of AIA Minnesota. These might include such areas as diversity, sustainability, architectural education, or the mentoring of emerging professionals, to the degree the firm has had the opportunity to address them, or as these topics may enhance the presentation.\n\nProcess\n\nFirm Award Selection Committee\n\nThe 2023 AIA Minnesota Firm Award Selection Committee:\n\nSam Olbekson, AIA, AICAE, NOMA – Selection Committee Chair, Full Circle Indigenous Planning + Design\n\nAmy Kalar, AIA – BWBR\n\nNathan Johnson, FAIA, NOMA – 4RM+ULA\n\nMichael Fischer, AIA – LHB, Inc.\n\nRebecca Muchow, AIA – Cushing Terrell\n\nSimona Fischer, AIA – MSR Design\n\nMelissa Lefebvre, AIA – DSGW Architects\n\nThe composition of the Firm Award Selection Committee is as follows:\n\nTwo AIA Minnesota Board Members – one of which will be the AIA Minnesota President (or in their place, the AIA Minnesota President-Elect), who will serve as Chair of the Committee\n\nOne AIA Fellow\n\nOne Past Recipient\n\nOne AIA Minnesota Committee on Design chair/co-chair\n\nTwo individuals selected by the Committee on Design to represent the priorities and diverse perspectives of the Minnesota architecture community\n\nThe Firm Award Selection Committee is convened prior to the call for nominations.
