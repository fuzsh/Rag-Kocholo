Leading Aircraftman (LAC) Leonard Graham Fuller 402052 landed an Anson aircraft with another Anson attached following a mid-air collision while undergoing pilot training at Number 2 Service Flying Training School (2SFTS) Wagga on 29 September 1940

The two aircraft remained firmly locked together and continued to fly after the collision with LAC Fuller in control of the upper Anson (N4876) while his navigator, 402066 LAC Ian Sinclair, and both crew members of the lower aircraft (402056 LAC Jack Hewson and 402051 LAC Hugh Fraser) all parachuted to safety. He was able to make a successful crash landing in a paddock.

As part of the Empire Air Training Scheme he finished his training in Canada and after graduating as a Sergeant Pilot he was posted to the UK

From there he was attached to Number 37 Squadron (37SQN) RAF in the Middle East flying Wellington bombers over Italy - he was awarded the DFM (Distinguished Flying Medal) for his sinking of enemy shipping in Palermo Harbour

Upon being commissioned as a Flying Officer he returned to Australia and was posted to Number 1 Operational Training Unit (1OTU) based at East Sale in Victoria for Flying Instructor duties - unfortunately he was killed in a collision between a motor bus and his bicycle on Heart Road, East Sale, Victoria
