The nice group of the Honorary Member 5th Class of the Royal Victorian Order for the station master at Homburg v. d. H. Rudolph Stirn brought me again to the point, to speculate about the numbering of this order.

Because of the often personalized British decoration, it is possible to relate the numbering of this order in medal groups to a person and a awarding date. More difficult is the situation for Honorary Members, where we need more information by documents, as e. g. we have for Rudolph Stirn.

There already seems to exist lists, where collectors tried to relate these numbers to awarding dates. Unfortunately I was not able to get access to these lists.

Surprisingly it was possible in a relatively short time, to find a few personalized groups of Knights and Members of the Royal Victorian Order by searching the internet. I arranged these by the awarding date. In this way one get a frame work of some use for ranging a numbered order referring its fabrication period. Especially for groups of Honorary Members it can help to identify the owner by using other sources.

Numbers not fitting in the numerical order could be the result of returned and again issued insignia. On the other hand it is not certain, if the Orders Chancellery dispense the decorations always and in consequence by the numerical order of the insignia.

The emission dates of the insignia marked with No. 1 is taken from the book The Royal Victorian Order by Peter Galloway.

I would be glad, if someone could add the still existing lists or single data of other personalized groups of numbered Royal Victorian Orders.

I'm afraid the only information I can add is negative in nature. Several decades ago, when I still collected medals, I was told that collectors would write the appropriate office in London - The Chancellery, I assume - asking about 'the [fill in order here] numbered XXX' and in due course someone would respond that the decoration /order had been awarded to '' [Mr/Mrs/Lord A___________' in year 'ZZZZ'. All very helpful.

Then, as the story goes, there a new chap took over as head of the office, and the next such request was met with "We don't divulge that information and, byt the way, that award should have been returned to us on the death of the recipient. Please return it to us now!' And that rather put a lid of further enquiries.
