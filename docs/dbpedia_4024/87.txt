While serving as a U.S. Marine, Leonard Bernard Graham III decided on his life path to become a Spartan Nurse and set a course to achieve it. When his life ended tragically at age 24, his parents wanted to keep his memory alive in a way that would be meaningful to him. “Once he passed,” his father Leonard recalls, “we figured that a scholarship would be the best way to preserve and honor his memory by helping others achieve their goal to become a nurse. MSU was the natural choice.” Each time this scholarship is awarded, his dream continues to live.

The Sergeant Leonard Bernard Graham III Nursing Scholarship serves to ignite the possibility of higher education and contributes to a living legacy of caring for others.
