And what was worse is that they didn't inspire another generation to come up through the ranks and want to write with the same models of aspiration. The science fiction that succeeded was the kind we had no use for, and I still don't. What I see is a marketplace full of walls of Star Trek novels. Long ago, I wrote that essay about how science fiction is just juvenile literature. That's only a partial truth, but had a real kernel to it that people weren't admitting at the time. An awful lot of the best science fiction really was juvenile literature, and that was OK and very good as such  classic stuff that I loved then and still do  but people wouldn't admit it because they thought it wasn't respectable enough. A lot of the people who have been successful with science fiction in the new era have, as it were, acknowledged my sense of that, and written juvenile books including Ursula Le Guin. Orson Scott Card's books are juvenile adventures. I think history has born me out; that's what really did succeed. And space opera with it. The science fiction I dislike also bears that out.\"\n\n*"
