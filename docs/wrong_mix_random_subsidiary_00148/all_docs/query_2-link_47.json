        "text": "Do L5 and s1 nerve root compressions produce radicular pain in a dermatomal pattern?\n\nPubMed\n\nTaylor, Christopher S; Coxon, Andrew J; Watson, Paul C; Greenough, Charles G\n\n2013-05-20\n\nObservational case series. To compare the pattern of distribution of radicular pain with published dermatome charts. Dermatomal charts vary and previous studies have demonstrated significant individual subject variation. Patients with radiologically and surgically proven nerve root compression (NRC) caused by prolapsed intervertebral disc completed computerized diagrams of the distribution of pain and pins and needles. Ninety-eight patients had L5 compressions and 83 had S1 compressions. The distribution of pain and pins and needles did not correspond well with dermatomal patterns. Of those patients with L5 NRC, only 22 (22.4%) recorded any hits on the L5 dermatome on the front, and only 60 (61.2%) on the back with only 13 (13.3%) on both. Only 1 (1.0%) patient placed more than 50% of their hits within the L5 dermatome. Of those patients with S1 NRC, only 3 (3.6%) recorded any hits on the S1 dermatome on the front, and only 64 (77.1%) on the back with only 15 (18.1%) on both. No patients placed more than 50% of their hits within the S1 dermatome. Regarding pins and needles, 27 (29.7%) patients with L5 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 27 (29.7%) on the back alone, and 14 (15.4%) on both. Nineteen (20.9%) recorded more than 50% of hits within the L5 dermatome. Three (3.6%) patients with S1 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 44 (53.0%) on the back alone, and 18 (21.7%) on both. Twelve (14.5%) recorded more than 50% of hits within the S1 dermatome. Patient report is an unreliable method of identifying the anatomical source of pain or paresthesia caused by nerve root compression. 4.\n\nDiffusion tensor imaging with quantitative evaluation and fiber tractography of lumbar nerve roots in sciatica.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Yin; Zong, Min; Xu, Xiaoquan; Zou, Yuefen; Feng, Yang; Liu, Wei; Wang, Chuanbing; Wang, Dehang\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo quantitatively evaluate nerve roots by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA) values in healthy volunteers and sciatica patients, visualize nerve roots by tractography, and compare the diagnostic efficacy between conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI. Seventy-five sciatica patients and thirty-six healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging using DTI. FA values for L5-S1 lumbar nerve roots were calculated at three levels from DTI images. Tractography was performed on L3-S1 nerve roots. ROC analysis was performed for FA values. The lumbar nerve roots were visualized and FA values were calculated in all subjects. FA values decreased in compressed nerve roots and declined from proximal to distal along the compressed nerve tracts. Mean FA values were more sensitive and specific than MR imaging for differentiating compressed nerve roots, especially in the far lateral zone at distal nerves. DTI can quantitatively evaluate compressed nerve roots, and DTT enables visualization of abnormal nerve tracts, providing vivid anatomic information and localization of probable nerve compression. DTI has great potential utility for evaluating lumbar nerve compression in sciatica. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Conventional T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) scans are commonly used to image spinal cord degeneration. However, these modalities are unable to image the entire lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Thus, in the present study, we assessed the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for quantitative assessment of compressed lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Subjects were 20 young healthy volunteers and 31 patients with lumbosacral stenosis. T2WI showed that the residual dural sac area was less than two-thirds that of the corresponding normal area in patients from L3 to S1 stenosis. On T1WI and T2WI, 74 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots from 31 patients showed compression changes. DTI showed thinning and distortion in 36 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots (49%) and abruption in 17 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots (23%). Moreover, fractional anisotropy values were reduced in the lumbosacral spinal nerve roots of patients with lumbosacral stenosis. These findings suggest that DTI can objectively and quantitatively evaluate the severity of lumbosacral spinal nerve root compression.\n\nIntraoperative conjoined lumbosacral nerve roots associated with spondylolisthesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopa, Iulian; Poenaru, Dan V; Oprea, Manuel D; Andrei, Diana\n\n2013-07-01\n\nLumbosacral nerve roots anomalies may produce low back pain. These anomalies are reported to be a cause for failed back surgery. They are usually left undiagnosed, especially in endoscopic discectomy techniques. Any surgery for entrapment disorders, performed on a patient with undiagnosed lumbosacral nerve roots anomaly, may lead to serious neural injuries because of an improper surgical technique or decompression. In this report, we describe our experience with a case of L5-S1 spondylolisthesis and associated congenital lumbosacral nerve root anomalies discovered during the surgical intervention, and the difficulties raised by such a discovery. Careful examination of coronal and axial views obtained through high-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging may lead to a proper diagnosis of this condition leading to an adequate surgical planning, minimizing the intraoperatory complications.\n\nA novel rat model of brachial plexus injury with nerve root stumps.\n\nPubMed\n\nFang, Jintao; Yang, Jiantao; Yang, Yi; Li, Liang; Qin, Bengang; He, Wenting; Yan, Liwei; Chen, Gang; Tu, Zhehui; Liu, Xiaolin; Gu, Liqiang\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe C5-C6 nerve roots are usually spared from avulsion after brachial plexus injury (BPI) and thus can be used as donors for nerve grafting. To date, there are no appropriate animal models to evaluate spared nerve root stumps. Hence, the aim of this study was to establish and evaluate a rat model with spared nerve root stumps in BPI. In rupture group, the proximal parts of C5-T1 nerve roots were held with the surrounding muscles and the distal parts were pulled by a sudden force after the brachial plexus was fully exposed, and the results were compared with those of sham group. To validate the model, the lengths of C5-T1 spared nerve root stumps were measured and the histologies of the shortest one and the corresponding spinal cord were evaluated. C5 nerve root stump was found to be the shortest. Histology findings demonstrated that the nerve fibers became more irregular and the continuity decreased; numbers and diameters of myelinated axons and thickness of myelin sheaths significantly decreased over time. The survival of motoneurons was reduced, and the death of motoneurons may be related to the apoptotic process. Our model could successfully create BPI model with nerve root stumps by traction, which could simulate injury mechanisms. While other models involve root avulsion or rupturing by distal nerve transection. This model would be suitable for evaluating nerve root stumps and testing new therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection through nerve root stumps in the future. Copyright Â© 2017.

However, it is unclear what causes stenosis, narrowing of the central canal or foramina. We performed a morphometric analysis of the lumbar nerve roots and intervertebral foramen in 17 patients (170 nerve roots and foramina) with achondroplasia (eight symptomatic, nine asymptomatic) and compared the data with that from 20 (200 nerve roots and foramina) asymptomatic patients without achondroplasia presenting with low back pain without neurologic symptoms. The measurements were made on left and right parasagittal MRI scans of the lumbar spine. The foramen area and root area were reduced at all levels from L1 to L5 between the patients with achondroplasia (Groups I and II) and the nonachondroplasia group (Group III). The percentage of nerve root occupancy in the foramen between Group I and Group II as compared with the patients without achondroplasia was similar or lower. This implied the lumbar nerve root size in patients with achondroplasia was smaller than that of the normal population and thus there is no effective nerve root compression. Symptoms of lumbar stenosis in achondroplasia may be arising from the central canal secondary to degenerative disc disease rather than a true foraminal stenosis.

To investigate the association between microstructural nerve roots changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and clinical symptoms and their duration in patients with lumbar disc herniation. The ability to identify microstructural properties of the nervous system with DTI has been demonstrated in many studies. However, there are no data regarding the association between microstructural changes evaluated using DTI and symptoms assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and their duration. Forty consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on the S1 nerve roots. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using an ODI questionnaire for each patient, and the duration of clinical symptoms was noted based on the earliest instance of leg pain and numbness. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated from tractography images. The mean FA value of the compressed lumbar nerve roots was significantly lower than the FA of the contralateral nerve roots (Pâ<â0.001). No notable difference in ADC was observed between compressed nerve roots and contralateral nerve roots (Pâ=â0.517). In the compressed nerve roots, a significant negative association was observed between FA values and ODI and symptom duration. However, an obvious positive association was observed between ODI and ADC values and duration on the compressed side. Significant changes in diffusion parameters were found in the compressed sacral nerves in patients with lumbar disc herniation and leg pain, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root has been damaged. 3.\n\nC2 root nerve sheath tumors management.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Sissy, Mohamed H; Mahmoud, Mostafa\n\n2013-05-01\n\nUpper cervical nerve sheath tumors (NST) arising mainly from C2 root and to lesser extent from C1 root are not uncommon, they constitute approximately 5-12% of spinal nerve sheath tumors and 18-30% of all cervical nerve sheath tumors, unique in presentation and their relationship to neighbouring structures owing to the discrete anatomy at the upper cervical-craniovertebral region, and have atendency for growth reaching large-sized tumors before manifesting clinically due to the capacious spinal canal at this region; accordingly the surgical approaches to such tumors are modified. The aim of this paper is to discuss the surgical strategies for upper cervical nerve sheath tumors. Eleven patients (8 male and 3 females), age range 28-63 years, with C2 root nerve sheath tumors were operated upon based on their anatomical relations to the spinal cord. The magnetic resonance imaging findings were utilized to determine the surgical approach. The tumors had extra- and intradural components in 10 patients, while in one the tumor was purely intradural. The operative approaches included varied from extreme lateral transcondylar approach(n = 1) to laminectomy, whether complete(n = 3) a or hemilaminectomy(n = 7), with partial facetectomy(n = 7), and with suboccipital craniectomy(n = 2). The clinical picture ranged from spasticity (n = 8, 72,72 %), tingling and numbness below neck (n = 6, 54,54 %), weakness (n = 6, 54,54 %), posterior column involvement (n = 4, 26,36 %), and neck pain (n = 4, 36,36 %). The duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 54 months, total excision was performed in 7 patients; while in 3 patients an extraspinal component, and in 1 patient a small intradural component, were left in situ. Eight patients showed improvement of myelopathy; 2 patients maintained their grades. One poor-grade patient was deteriorated. The surgical approaches for the C2 root nerve sheath tumors should be tailored according to the relationship to the spinal cord, determined by magnetic\n\n[Long-term effects of pulsed radiofrequency on the dorsal root ganglion and segmental nerve roots for lumbosacral radicular pain: a prospective controlled randomized trial with nerve root block].\n\nPubMed\n\nFujii, Hiromi; Kosogabe, Yoshinori; Kajiki, Hideki\n\n2012-08-01\n\nAlthough pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) method for lumbosacral radicular pain (LSRP) is reportedly effective, there are no prospective controlled trials. We assessed the long-term efficacy of PRF of the dorsal root ganglion and nerve roots for LSRP as compared with nerve root block (RB). The study included 27 patients suffering from LSRP. The design of this study was randomized with a RB control. In the PRF group, the PRF current was applied for 120 seconds after RB. In the RB group, the patients received RB only. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed immediately before, and immediately, 2 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the procedure. P<0.05 was regarded as denoting statistical significance. In both groups, the VAS not only of short-term but also of long-term (6 months and 1 year after procedure) significantly decreased as compared with that before treatment (P<0.05). There were no significant differences of VAS between the two groups at the same time points. This study indicates that PRF adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion and nerve roots for LSRP has long-term effects. There were no significant differences of long-term effects between the two groups.\n\nConsecutive assessment of FA and ADC values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyagi, Ryo; Sakai, Toshinori; Yamabe, Eiko; Yoshioka, Hiroshi\n\n2015-06-27\n\nDiffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35Â years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7Â ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800Â s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5Â mm; and total scan time, 7Â min 35Â s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5Â mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15Â mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1â>âL5â>âL4 (pâ<â0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15Â mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4â>âL5â>âS1 (pâ<â0.05). Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root.\n\nMicrosurgical resection of cauda equina schwannoma with nerve root preservation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCormick, Paul C\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe occurrence of motor deficit following resection of an intradural spinal schwannoma is an uncommon but potentially serious complication.

Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy.\n\nExtracorporeal Stimulation of Sacral Nerve Roots for Observation of Pelvic Autonomic Nerve Integrity: Description of a Novel Methodological Setup.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoszkowski, Tomasz; Kauff, Daniel W; Wegner, Celine; Ruff, Roman; Somerlik-Fuchs, Karin H; Kruger, Thilo B; Augustyniak, Piotr; Hoffmann, Klaus-Peter; Kneist, Werner\n\n2018-03-01\n\nNeurophysiologic monitoring can improve autonomic nerve sparing during critical phases of rectal cancer surgery. To develop a system for extracorporeal stimulation of sacral nerve roots. Dedicated software controlled a ten-electrode stimulation array by switching between different electrode configurations and current levels. A built-in impedance and current level measurement assessed the effectiveness of current injection. Intra-anal surface electromyography (sEMG) informed on targeting the sacral nerve roots. All tests were performed on five pig specimens. During switching between electrode configurations, the system delivered 100% of the set current (25Â mA, 30Â Hz, 200Â Î¼s cathodic pulses) in 93% of 250 stimulation trains across all specimens. The impedance measured between single stimulation array contacts and corresponding anodes across all electrode configurations and specimens equaled 3.7Â Â±Â 2.5Â kÎ©. The intra-anal sEMG recorded a signal amplitude increase as previously observed in the literature. When the stimulation amplitude was tested in the range from 1 to 21Â mA using the interconnected contacts of the stimulation array and the intra-anal anode, the impedance remained below 250Â Î© and the system delivered 100% of the set current in all cases. Intra-anal sEMG showed an amplitude increase for current levels exceeding 6Â mA. The system delivered stable electric current, which was proved by built-in impedance and current level measurements. Intra-anal sEMG confirmed the ability to target the branches of the autonomous nervous system originating from the sacral nerve roots. Stimulation outside of the operative field during rectal cancer surgery is feasible and may improve the practicality of pelvic intraoperative neuromonitoring.\n\nDermatomal somatosensory evoked potential demonstration of nerve root decompression after VAX-D therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaguszewski, W K; Naguszewski, R K; Gose, E E\n\n2001-10-01\n\nReductions in low back pain and referred leg pain associated with a diagnosis of herniated disc, degenerative disc disease or facet syndrome have previously been reported after treatment with a VAX-D table, which intermittently distracts the spine. The object of this study was to use dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (DSSEPs) to demonstrate lumbar root decompression following VAX-D therapy. Seven consecutive patients with a diagnosis of low back pain and unilateral or bilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathy were studied at our center. Disc herniation at the L5-S1 level was documented by MRI or CT in all patients. All patients were studied bilaterally by DSSEPs at L5 and S1 before and after VAX-D therapy. All patients had at least 50% improvement in radicular symptoms and low back pain and three of them experienced complete resolution of all symptoms. The average pain reduction was 77%. The number of treatment sessions varied from 12 to 35. DSSEPs were considered to show improvement if triphasic characteristics returned or a 50% or greater increase in the P1-P2 amplitude was seen. All patients showed improvement in DSSEPs after VAX-D therapy either ipsilateral or contralateral to the symptomatic leg. Two patients showed deterioration in DSSEPs in the symptomatic leg despite clinically significant improvement in pain and radicular symptoms. Overall, 28 nerve roots were studied before and after VAX-D therapy. Seventeen nerve root responses were improved, eight remained unchanged and three deteriorated. The significance of DSSEP improvement contralateral to the symptomatic leg is emphasized. Direct compression of a nerve root by a disc herniation is probably not the sole explanation for referred leg pain.\n\nThe Accuracy of the Physical Examination for the Diagnosis of Midlumbar and Low Lumbar Nerve Root Impingement\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSuri, Pradeep; Rainville, James; Katz, Jeffrey N.; Jouve, Cristin; Hartigan, Carol; Limke, Janet; Pena, Enrique; Li, Ling; Swaim, Bryan; Hunter, David J\n\n2010-01-01\n\nStudy Design Cross-sectional study with prospective recruitment. Objective To determine the accuracy of the physical examination for the diagnosis of midlumbar nerve root impingement (L2, L3, or L4), low lumbar nerve root impingement (L5 or S1) and level-specific lumbar nerve root impingement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using individual tests and combinations of tests. Summary of Background Data The sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination for the localization of nerve root impingement has not been previously studied. Methods Sensitivities, specificities and LRs were calculated for the ability of individual tests and test combinations to predict the presence or absence of nerve root impingement at midlumbar, low lumbar, and specific nerve root levels. Results LRs â¥5.0 indicate moderate to large changes from pre-test probability of nerve root impingement to post-test probability. For the diagnosis of midlumbar impingement, the femoral stretch test (FST), crossed femoral stretch test (CFST), medial ankle pinprick sensation, and patellar reflex testing demonstrated LRs â¥5.0 (LR â). LRs â¥5.0 were seen with the combinations of FST and either patellar reflex testing (LR 7.0; 95% CI 2.3â21), or the sit-to-stand test (LR â). For the diagnosis of low lumbar impingement, the Achilles reflex test demonstrated a LR â¥5.0 (LR 7.1; CI 0.96â53); test combinations did not increase LRs. For the diagnosis of level-specific impingement, LRs â¥5.0 were seen for anterior thigh sensation at L2 (LR 13; 95% CI 1.8â87); FST at L3 (LR 5.7 ; 95% CI 2.3â4.4); patellar reflex testing (LR 7.7; 95% CI 1.7â35), medial ankle sensation (LR â), or CFST (LR 13; 95% CI 1.8â87) at L4; and hip abductor strength at L5(LR 11; 95% CI 1.3â84). Test combinations increased LRs for level-specific root impingement at the L4 level only. Conclusions Individual physical examination tests may provide clinical information which substantially alters the likelihood\n\nMassive nerve root enlargement in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchady, W; Goulding, P J; Lecky, B R; King, R H; Smith, C M\n\n1996-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To report three patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) presenting with symptoms suggestive of cervical (one patient) and lumbar root disease. METHODS: Nerve conduction studies, EMG, and nerve biopsy were carried out, having found the nerve roots to be very enlarged on MRI, CT myelography, and at surgery. RESULTS: Clinically, peripheral nerve thickening was slight or absent. Subsequently one patient developed facial nerve hypertrophy. This was mistaken for an inner ear tumour and biopsied, with consequent facial palsy. Neurophysiological tests suggested a demyelinating polyneuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy showed in all cases some loss of myelinated fibres, inflammatory cell infiltration, and a few onion bulbs. Hypertrophic changes were much more prominent on posterior nerve root biopsy in one patient: many fibres were surrounded by several layers of Schwann cell cytoplasm. There was an excellent response to steroids in two patients but not in the third (most advanced) patient, who has benefited only marginally from intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: MRI of the cauda equina may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of CIDP.

However, if an entire contralateral C 7 nerve is used to repair two nerves, both recipient nerves show good recovery. These findings seem contradictory, as the above two methods use the same donor nerve, only the cutting method of the contralateral C 7 nerve is different. To verify whether this can actually result in different repair effects, we divided rats with right total brachial plexus injury into three groups. In the entire root group, the entire contralateral C 7 root was transected and transferred to the median nerve of the affected limb. In the posterior division group, only the posterior division of the contralateral C 7 root was transected and transferred to the median nerve. In the entire root + posterior division group, the entire contralateral C 7 root was transected but only the posterior division was transferred to the median nerve. After neurectomy, the median nerve was repaired on the affected side in the three groups. At 8, 12, and 16 weeks postoperatively, electrophysiological examination showed that maximum amplitude, latency, muscle tetanic contraction force, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle were significantly better in the entire root and entire root + posterior division groups than in the posterior division group. No significant difference was found between the entire root and entire root + posterior division groups. Counts of myelinated axons in the median nerve were greater in the entire root group than in the entire root + posterior division group, which were greater than the posterior division group.

Duco; Mahadevan-Jansen, Anita\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is a neurostimulation modality that uses pulsed infrared light to evoke artifact-free, spatially precise neural activity with a noncontact interface; however, the technique has not been demonstrated in humans. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of INS in humans in vivo. The feasibility of INS in humans was assessed in patients (n=7) undergoing selective dorsal root rhizotomy, where hyperactive dorsal roots, identified for transection, were stimulated in vivo with INS on two to three sites per nerve with electromyogram recordings acquired throughout the stimulation. The stimulated dorsal root was removed and histology was performed to determine thermal damage thresholds of INS. Threshold activation of human dorsal rootlets occurred in 63% of nerves for radiant exposures between 0.53 and 1.23ââJ/cm2. In all cases, only one or two monitored muscle groups were activated from INS stimulation of a hyperactive spinal root identified by electrical stimulation. Thermal damage was first noted at 1.09ââJ/cm2 and a 2â¶1 safety ratio was identified. These findings demonstrate the success of INS as a fresh approach for activating human nerves in vivo and providing the necessary safety data needed to pursue clinically driven therapeutic and diagnostic applications of INS in humans.

Prominent computed tomography (CT) findings include: (a) rounded masses in the region of the foramina isodense with cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space; (b) associated asymmetry of epidural fat distribution; (c) enlargement of the neural foramina in axial sections with scalloped erosion of the adjacent posteriolateral vertebral body, pedicle, and pedicular-laminar junction with preservation of cortex and without bony sclerosis or infiltrative appearance; (d) prominent or ectatic dural sac with lack of usual epidural landmarks between the sac and vertebral body; and (e) multilevel abnormalities throughout the entire lumbar region. Myelographic and CT correlations are demonstrated with a review of the literature. A discussion of the various cystic abnormalities involving nerve root sheaths is undertaken in an attempt to clarify the confusing nomenclature applied to nerve root sleeve pathology.\n\nReinnervation of Urethral and Anal Sphincters With Femoral Motor Nerve to Pudendal Nerve Transfer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRuggieri, Michael R.; Braverman, Alan S.; Bernal, Raymond M.; Lamarre, Neil S.; Brown, Justin M.; Barbe, Mary F.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAims Lower motor neuron damage to sacral roots or nerves can result in incontinence and a flaccid urinary bladder. We showed bladder reinnervation after transfer of coccygeal to sacral ventral roots, and genitofemoral nerves (L1, 2 origin) to pelvic nerves. This study assesses the feasibility of urethral and anal sphincter reinnervation using transfer of motor branches of the femoral nerve (L2â4 origin) to pudendal nerves (S1, 2 origin) that innervate the urethral and anal sphincters in a canine model. Methods Sacral ventral roots were selected by their ability to stimulate bladder, urethral sphincter, and anal sphincter contraction and transected. Bilaterally, branches of the femoral nerve, specifically, nervus saphenous pars muscularis [Evans HE. Millerâs anatomy of the dog. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders; 1993], were transferred and end-to-end anastomosed to transected pudendal nerve branches in the perineum, then enclosed in unipolar nerve cuff electrodes with leads to implanted RF micro-stimulators. Results Nerve stimulation induced increased anal and urethral sphincter pressures in five of six transferred nerves. Retrograde neurotracing from the bladder, urethral sphincter, and anal sphincter using fluorogold, fast blue, and fluororuby, demonstrated urethral and anal sphincter labeled neurons in L2â4 cord segments (but not S1â3) in nerve transfer canines, consistent with rein-nervation by the transferred femoral nerve motor branches. Controls had labeled neurons only in S1â3 segments. Postmortem DiI and DiO labeling confirmed axonal regrowth across the nerve repair site. Conclusions These results show spinal cord reinnervation of urethral and anal sphincter targets after sacral ventral root transection and femoral nerve transfer (NT) to the denervated pudendal nerve. These surgical procedures may allow patients to regain continence.

We study the outcome of the procedure with in-depth analysis of the results of 18 implanted cases. Patients with urinary urge incontinence were subjected to percutaneous nerve evaluation of the S3 roots as a temporary screening test to determine response to neuromodulation. Satisfactory responders were implanted with permanent sacral root neuroprosthesis. The study design included comprehensive voiding diaries for 4 consecutive days twice as a baseline, 1 with percutaneous nerve evaluation screening, 1 after the percutaneous nerve evaluation, 1 at the 1, 3 and 6 post-implantation visits, and every 6 months thereafter. Uroflowmetry and quality of life questionnaires were performed at the same intervals. Urodynamic study was done as a baseline and 6 months after implantation of the neuroprosthesis. All 18 patients (16 women and 2 men) with refractory urge incontinence received a sacral foramina neuroprosthesis after demonstrating a good response to the percutaneous nerve evaluation. Average patient age at presentation was 42.3+/-3.3 years (range 22 to 67) and duration of urinary symptoms was 6.6+/-1.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.8). Average followup was 18.8 months (range 3 to 83). Neuromodulation in these patients showed a marked reduction in leakage episodes from 6.49 to 1.98 times per 24 hours and in the leakage severity score. Eight patients became completely dry and 4 had average leakage episodes of 1 or less daily. Patients showed as well a decrease in urinary frequency with an increase in functional bladder capacity. Associated pelvic pain improved substantially. Cystometrograms demonstrated increased volume at first sensation by 50% and increased cystometric capacity by 15% with the disappearance of uninhibited contractions in 1 of the 4 patients who presented with it preoperatively. There was also noticeable improvement in the quality of life\n\nCharacterization of a chondroitin sulfate hydrogel for nerve root regeneration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nConovaloff, Aaron; Panitch, Alyssa\n\n2011-10-01\n\nBrachial plexus injury is a serious medical problem that affects many patients annually, with most cases involving damage to the nerve roots. Therefore, a chondroitin sulfate hydrogel was designed to both serve as a scaffold for regenerating root neurons and deliver neurotrophic signals. Capillary electrophoresis showed that chondroitin sulfate has a dissociation constant in the micromolar range with several common neurotrophins, and this was determined to be approximately tenfold stronger than with heparin. It was also revealed that nerve growth factor exhibits a slightly stronger affinity for hyaluronic acid than for chondroitin sulfate. However, E8 chick dorsal root ganglia cultured in the presence of nerve growth factor revealed that ganglia cultured in chondroitin sulfate scaffolds showed more robust growth than those cultured in control gels of hyaluronic acid. It is hypothesized that, despite the stronger affinity of nerve growth factor for hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate serves as a better scaffold for neurite outgrowth, possibly due to inhibition of growth by hyaluronic acid chains.\n\nRole of dorsal root ganglion K2P1.1 in peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMao, Qingxiang; Yuan, Jingjing; Xiong, Ming; Wu, Shaogen; Chen, Liyong; Bekker, Alex; Yang, Tiande\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPeripheral nerve injury-caused hyperexcitability and abnormal ectopic discharges in the primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a key role in neuropathic pain development and maintenance. The two-pore domain background potassium (K2P) channels have been identified as key determinants of the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. However, whether K2P channels contribute to neuropathic pain is still elusive. We reported here that K2P1.1, the first identified mammalian K2P channel, was highly expressed in mouse DRG and distributed in small-, medium-, and large-sized DRG neurons. Unilateral lumbar (L) 4 spinal nerve ligation led to a significant and time-dependent reduction of K2P1.1 mRNA and protein in the ipsilateral L4 DRG, but not in the contralateral L4 or ipsilateral L3 DRG. Rescuing this reduction through microinjection of adeno-associated virus-DJ expressing full-length K2P1.1 mRNA into the ipsilateral L4 DRG blocked spinal nerve ligation-induced mechanical, thermal, and cold pain hypersensitivities during the development and maintenance periods. This DRG viral microinjection did not affect acute pain and locomotor function. Our findings suggest that K2P1.1 participates in neuropathic pain development and maintenance and may be a potential target in the management of this disorder.

Between September 2009 and April 2012, 22 patients (9 men, 13 women; mean age: 48.2 years) underwent MRI-guided (1.0 Tesla, Panorama HFO, Philips) single-site periradicular cervical nerve root infiltration with 40âmg triamcinolone acetonide. A further 64 patients (34 men, 30 women; mean age: 50.3 years) were treated under CT fluoroscopic guidance (Somatom Definition 64, Siemens). The mean overall costs were calculated as the sum of the prorated costs of equipment use (purchase, depreciation, maintenance, and energy costs), personnel costs and expenditure for disposables that were identified for MRI- and CT-guided procedures. Additionally, the cost of ultrasound guidance was calculated. The mean intervention time was 24.9 min. (range: 12â-â36âmin.) for MRI-guided infiltration and 19.7âmin. (range: 5â-â54âmin.) for CT-guided infiltration. The average total costs per patient were EUR 240 for MRI-guided interventions and EUR 124 for CT-guided interventions. These were (MRI/CT guidance) EUR 150/60 for equipment use, EUR 46/40 for personnel, and EUR 44/25 for disposables. The mean overall cost of ultrasound guidance was EUR 76. Cervical nerve root infiltration using MRI guidance is still about twice as expensive as infiltration using CT guidance. However, since it does not involve radiation exposure for patients and personnel, MRI-guided nerve root infiltration may become a promising alternative to the CT-guided procedure, especially since a further price decrease is expected for MRI devices and MR-compatible disposables. In contrast, ultrasound remains the less expensive method for nerve root infiltration guidance.

Of these, 48 were treated with Feng's Spinal Manipulation, hot fomentation, and bed rest (treatment group). The remaining 46 patients were treated with hot fomentation and bed rest only (control group). After 3 weeks of treatment, clinical parameters including the angle of straight-leg raising, visual analogue scale pain score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for low back pain were improved. The treatment group had significantly better improvement in scores than the control group. Magnetic resonance myelography three-dimensional reconstruction imaging of the vertebral canal demonstrated that filling of the compressed nerve root sleeve with cerebrospinal fluid increased significantly in the treatment group. The diameter of the nerve root sleeve was significantly larger in the treatment group than in the control group. However, the sagittal diameter index of the herniated nucleus pulposus and the angle between the nerve root sleeve and the thecal sac did not change significantly in either the treatment or control groups. The effectiveness of Feng's Spinal Manipulation for the treatment of symptoms associated with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation may be attributable to the relief of nerve root compression, without affecting the herniated nucleus pulposus or changing the morphology or position of the nerve root. PMID:25206408\n\nSpontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak from an anomalous thoracic nerve root: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLopez, Alejandro J; Campbell, Robert K; Arnaout, Omar; Curran, Yvonne M; Shaibani, Ali; Dahdaleh, Nader S\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe authors report the case of a 28-year-old woman with a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak from the sleeve of a redundant thoracic nerve root. She presented with postural headaches and orthostatic symptoms indicative of intracranial hypotension. CT myelography revealed that the lesion was located at the T-11 nerve root. After failure of conservative management, including blood patches and thrombin glue injections, the patient was successfully treated with surgical decompression and ligation of the duplicate nerve, resulting in full resolution of her orthostatic symptoms.\n\nThe Relation Between Rotation Deformity and Nerve Root Stress in Lumbar Scoliosis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Ho-Joong; Lee, Hwan-Mo; Moon, Seong-Hwan; Chun, Heoung-Jae; Kang, Kyoung-Tak\n\nEven though several finite element models of lumbar spine were introduced, there has been no model including the neural structure. Therefore, the authors made the novel lumbar spine finite element model including neural structure. Using this model, we investigated the relation between the deformity pattern and nerve root stress. Two lumbar models with different types of curve pattern (lateral bending and lateral bending with rotation curve) were made. In the model of lateral bending curves without rotation, the principal compressive nerve root stress on the concave side was greater than the principal tensile stress on the convex side at the apex vertebra. Contrarily, in the lateral bending curve with rotational deformity, the nerve stress on the convex side was higher than that on the concave side. Therefore, this study elicit that deformity pattern could have significantly influence on the nerve root stress in the lumbar spine.\n\nPrevalence of extraforaminal nerve root compression below lumbosacral transitional vertebrae.\n\nPubMed\n\nPorter, Neil A; Lalam, Radhesh K; Tins, Bernhard J; Tyrrell, Prudencia N M; Singh, Jaspreet; Cassar-Pullicino, Victor N\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAlthough pathology at the first mobile segment above a lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) is a known source of spinal symptoms, nerve root compression below an LSTV, has only sporadically been reported. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of nerve root entrapment below an LSTV, review the causes of entrapment, and correlate with presenting symptoms. A retrospective review of MR and CT examinations of the lumbar spine was performed over a 5.5-year period in which the words \"transitional vertebra\" were mentioned in the report. Nerve root compression below an LSTV was assessed as well as the subtype of transitional vertebra. Correlation with clinical symptoms at referral was made. MR and CT examinations were also reviewed to exclude any other cause of symptoms above the LSTV. One hundred seventy-four patients were included in the study. Neural compression by new bone formation below an LSTV was demonstrated in 23 patients (13%). In all of these patients, there was a pseudarthrosis present on the side of compression due to partial sacralization with incomplete fusion. In three of these patients (13%), there was symptomatic correlation with no other cause of radiculopathy demonstrated. A further 13 patients (57%) had correlating symptoms that may in part be attributable to compression below an LSTV. Nerve root compression below an LSTV occurs with a prevalence of 13% and can be symptomatic in up to 70% of these patients. This region should therefore be carefully assessed in all symptomatic patients with an LSTV.\n\n[Possibility of cauda equina nerve root damage from lumbar punctures performed with 25-gauge Quincke and Whitacre needles].\n\nPubMed\n\nReina, M A; LÃ³pez, A; Villanueva, M C; De AndrÃ©s, J A; MartÃ­n, S\n\n2005-05-01\n\nTo assess the possibility of puncturing nerve roots in the cauda equina with spinal needles with different point designs and to quantify the number of axons affected. We performed in vitro punctures of human nerve roots taken from 3 fresh cadavers. Twenty punctures were performed with 25-gauge Whitacre needles and 40 with 25-gauge Quincke needles; half the Quincke needle punctures were carried out with the point perpendicular to the root and the other half with the point parallel to it. The samples were studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy. The possibility of finding the needle orifece inserted inside the nerve was assessed. On a photographic montage, we counted the number of axons during a hypothetical nerve puncture. Nerve roots used in this study were between 1 and 2.3 mm thick, allowing the needle to penetrate the root in the 52 samples studied. The needle orifice was never fully located inside the nerve in any of the samples. The numbers of myelinized axons affected during nerve punctures 0.2 mm deep were 95, 154, and 81 for Whitacre needles, Quincke needles with the point held perpendicular, or the same needle type held parallel, respectively. During punctures 0.5 mm deep, 472, 602, and 279 were affected for each puncture group, respectively. The differences in all cases were statistically significant. It is possible to achieve intraneural puncture with 25-gauge needles. However, full intraneural placement of the orifice of the needle is unlikely. In case of nerve trauma, the damage could be greater if puncture is carried out with a Quincke needle with the point inserted perpendicular to the nerve root.\n\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging of Lumbar Nerve Roots: Comparison Between Fast Readout-Segmented and Selective-Excitation Acquisitions.\n\nPubMed\n\nManoliu, Andrei; Ho, Michael; Nanz, Daniel; Piccirelli, Marco; Dappa, Evelyn; KlarhÃ¶fer, Markus; Del Grande, Filippo; Kuhn, Felix Pierre\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the quality of recently emerged advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a functional assessment of lumbar nerve roots. The institutional review board approved the study including 12 healthy volunteers. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 3 T (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with b-values of 0 and 700 s/mm and an isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting. The nerve roots L2 to S1 were imaged in coronal orientation with readout-segmented EPI (rs-DTI) and selective-excitation EPI (sTX-DTI) with an acquisition time of 5 minutes each, and in axial orientation with single-shot EPI (ss-DTI) with an acquisition time of 12 minutes (scan parameters as in recent literature). Two independent readers qualitatively and quantitatively assessed image quality. The interobserver reliability ranged from \"substantial\" to \"almost perfect\" for all examined parameter and all 3 sequences (Îº = 0.70-0.94). Overall image quality was rated higher, and artifact levels were scored lower for rs-DTI and sTX-DTI than for ss-DTI (P = 0.007-0.027), while fractional anisotropy and signal-to-noise ratio values were similar for all sequences (P â¥ 0.306 and P â¥ 0.100, respectively). Contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for rs-DTI and ss-DTI than for sTX-DTI (P = 0.004-0.013). Despite shorter acquisition times, rs-DTI and sTX-DTI produced images of higher quality with smaller geometrical distortions than the current standard of reference, ss-DTI. Thus, DTI acquisitions in the coronal plane, requiring fewer slices for full coverage of exiting nerve roots, may allow for functional neurography in scan times suitable for routine clinical practice.\n\nInfrared neural stimulation of human spinal nerve roots in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nCayce, Jonathan M; Wells, Jonathon D; Malphrus, Jonathan D; Kao, Chris; Thomsen, Sharon; Tulipan, Noel B; Konrad, Peter E; Jansen, E Duco; Mahadevan-Jansen, Anita\n\n2015-01-01\n\nInfrared neural stimulation (INS) is a neurostimulation modality that uses pulsed infrared light to evoke artifact-free, spatially precise neural activity with a noncontact interface; however, the technique has not been demonstrated in humans.

Using the MASEP-SRRS type gamma knife treatment system, 140 Chinese patients with trigeminal neuralgia (NT) were treated in our hospital from 2002 to 2010, in which the pain relief rate reached 95% and recurrence rate was 3% only. We investigated the effect of the gamma knife treatment on the trigeminal nerve root in 20 Chinese patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia by the magnetic resonance imager (MRI) observation. 1) The cross-sectional area of trigeminal nerve root became smaller and MRI signals were lower in the treatment side than those in the non-treatment side after the gamma knife treatment of primary trigeminal neuralgia; 2) in the treatment side, the cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerve root decreased significantly after the gamma knife treatment; 3) there was good correlation between the clinical improvement and the MRI findings; and 4) the straight distance between the trigeminal nerve root and the brainstem did not change after the gamma knife treatment. The pain relief induced the gamma knife radiosurgery might be related with the atrophy of the trigeminal nerve root in Chinese patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nCells of origin in the embryonic nerve roots for NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Zhiguo; Liu, Chiachi; Patel, Amish J.; Liao, Chung-Ping; Wang, Yong; Le, Lu Q.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSummary Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a tumor-predisposing genetic disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas are common NF1 tumors carrying a risk of malignant transformation, which is typically fatal. Little is known about mechanisms mediating initiation and identity of specific cell-type that gives rise to neurofibromas. Using cell-lineage tracing, we identify a population of GAP43+ PLP+ precursors in embryonic nerve roots as the cells of origin for these tumors and report a non-germline model of neurofibroma for preclinical drug screening to identify effective therapies. The identity of tumor cell-of-origin and facility for isolation and expansion provides fertile ground for continued analysis to define intrinsic and extrinsic factors critical for neurofibromagenesis. It also provides unique approaches to develop therapies to prevent neurofibroma formation in NF1 patients.

Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed an enhanced tumor continuing into the foramen from the spinal cord at the C5/6 intervertebral level. It was thought to be an Eden type 2 schwannoma. Right unilateral laminectomy was performed on C5. The tumor was present in the intradural area and arose from the right C6 anterior root. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the deltoid, biceps, and extensor carpi radial (ECR) muscles were recorded following electric cervical nerve root stimulation (0.2 ms duration, and 7 mA intensity). CMAPs of large amplitude were obtained from the deltoid, biceps, and ECR muscles following C5 root stimulation, but those following C6 root stimulation were small. As a result it was determined that the right C6 root was not associated with the nerve distribution for these muscles, so it was resected en bloc with the tumor. No apparent loss of motor function was observed. Standard needle electromyography showed no denervation potentials or decrease in motor unit potentials in either the deltoid or biceps muscles. Intraoperative investigation for compensation of nerve root is clinically useful for determining whether resection of a nerve root results in muscle weakness after surgery for a cervical schwannoma.\n\nDiagnostic value of history and physical examination in patients suspected of lumbosacral nerve root compression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVroomen, P; de Krom, M C T F M; Wilmink, J; Kester, A; Knottnerus, J\n\n2002-01-01\n\nObjective: To evaluate patient characteristics, symptoms, and examination findings in the clinical diagnosis of lumbosacral nerve root compression causing sciatica. Methods: The study involved 274 patients with pain radiating into the leg. All had a standardised clinical assessment and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The associations between patient characteristics, clinical findings, and lumbosacral nerve root compression on MR imaging were analysed. Results: Nerve root compression was associated with three patient characteristics, three symptoms, and four physical examination findings (paresis, absence of tendon reflexes, a positive straight leg raising test, and increased finger-floor distance). Multivariate analysis, analysing the independent diagnostic value of the tests, showed that nerve root compression was predicted by two patient characteristics, four symptoms, and two signs (increased finger-floor distance and paresis). The straight leg raise test was not predictive. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic was 0.80 for the history items. It increased to 0.83 when the physical examination items were added. Conclusions: Various clinical findings were found to be associated with nerve root compression on MR imaging. While this set of findings agrees well with those commonly used in daily practice, the tests tended to have lower sensitivity and specificity than previously reported. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that most of the diagnostic information revealed by physical examination findings had already been revealed by the history items.

Because of the small size and ventral course of these arteries in relation to the dorsal root ganglion and ventral root, they cannot be reliably identified during surgery by anatomic or morphologic criteria. Sacrificing them will most likely result in paraplegia. The goal of this study was to evaluate a novel method of intraoperative testing of a nerve root's contribution to the blood supply of the thoracic spinal cord. This is a clinical retrospective study of 49 patients diagnosed with thoracic spine tumors. Temporary nerve root clipping combined with motor-evoked potential (MEP) and somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring was performed; additionally, postoperative clinical evaluation was done and reported in all cases. All cases were monitored by SSEP and MEPs. The nerve root to be sacrificed was temporarily clipped using standard aneurysm clips, and SSEP/MEP were assessed before and after clipping. Four nerve roots were sacrificed in four cases, three nerve roots in eight cases, and two nerve roots in 22 cases. Nerve roots were sacrificed bilaterally in 12 cases. Most patients (47/49) had no changes in MEP/SSEP and had no neurological deficit postoperatively. One case of a spinal sarcoma demonstrated changes in MEP after temporary clipping of the left T11 nerve root. The nerve was not sacrificed, and the patient was neurologically intact after surgery. In another case of a sarcoma, MEPs changed in the lower limbs after ligation of left T9 nerve root. It was felt that it was a global event because of anesthesia. Postoperatively, the patient had complete paraplegia but recovered almost completely after 6 months. Temporary nerve root clipping combined with MEP and SSEP monitoring may enhance the impact of neuromonitoring in the intraoperative management of patients with thoracic spine tumors and favorably influence neurological outcome.

The aims of this study were to assess and compare miRNA expression profiles in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following three different kinds of peripheral nerve injury, including spinal nerve ligation (SNL), dorsal root transection (DRT), and ventral root transection (VRT), in Sprague-Dawley rats. Responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 4, and 7. A miRNA microarray analysis was used to detect the miRNA expression profiles in injured L5 DRG from SNL, DRT, and VRT on POD 7. Validation of miRNA expression was performed by qPCR and in situ hybridization. Rats receiving SNL displayed significantly higher mechanical hypersensitivity, but those receiving DRT developed higher thermal hypersensitivity. The number of miRNAs that were significantly upregulated in L5 DRG was 49 (7.2%), 25 (3.7%), and 146 (21.5%) following SNL, DRT, and VRT, respectively. On the other hand, 35 (5.1%) miRNAs were significantly downregulated in the SNL group, 21 (3.1%) miRNAs in the DRT group, and 41 (6.0%) miRNAs in the VRT group. Of the four miRNAs that were mutually aberrant in all three models, two were significantly upregulated (twofold), miR-21 and miR-31, and two were significantly downregulated, miR-668 and miR-672. Using in situ hybridization, miRNA-21, miRNA-31, miRNA-668, and miRNA-672 were found to localize to neurons in the DRG. Collectively, the mutual abnormal miRNA expression of miR-21, miR-31, miR-668, and miR-677 implied that these miRNAs may be therapeutic targets for alleviating multiple forms of neuropathic pain.\n\nIntercellular junctions between palisade nerve endings and outer root sheath cells of rat vellus hairs.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaidoh, T; InouÃ©, T\n\n2000-05-15\n\nHair follicles have a longitudinal set of sensory nerve endings called palisade nerve endings (PN). We examined the junctional structures between the PN and outer root sheath (ORS) cells of hair follicles in the rat external ear. Transmission electron microscopy of serial thin sections showed that the processes of the ORS cells penetrated the basal lamina of the hair follicle, forming intercellular junctions with the PN (PN-ORS junctions). Two types of junctions were found: junctions between nerve endings and ORS cells (N-ORS junctions) and those between Schwann cell processes and ORS cells (S-ORS junctions). The N-ORS junctions had two subtypes: 1) a short process or small eminence of the ORS cell was attached to the nerve ending (type I); or 2) a process of the ORS cell was invaginated into the nerve ending (type II). The S-ORS junctions also had two subtypes: 1) a short process or small eminence of the ORS cell was abutted on the Schwann cell process (type I); or 2) a process of the ORS cell was invaginated into the Schwann cell process (type II). Vesicles, coated pits, coated vesicles, and endosomes were sometimes seen in nerve endings, Schwann cells, and ORS cells near the junctions. Computer-aided reconstruction of the serial thin sections displayed the three-dimensional structure of these junctions. These results suggested that the PN-ORS junctions provided direct relationships between the PN and ORS in at least four different patterns. The discovery of these junctions shows the PN-ORS relationship to be closer than previously realized. We speculate that these junctions may have roles in attachment of the PN to the ORS, contributing to increases in the sensitivity of the PN, and in chemical signaling between the PN and ORS.\n\nEffects of lower limb neurodynamic mobilization on intraneural fluid dispersion of the fourth lumbar nerve root: an unembalmed cadaveric investigation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGilbert, Kerry K.; Smith, Michael P.; Sobczak, StÃ©phane; James, C. Roger; Sizer, Phillip S.; BrismÃ©e, Jean-Michel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives Manual and physical therapists incorporate neurodynamic mobilisation (NDM) to improve function and decrease pain. Little is known about the mechanisms by which these interventions affect neural tissue. The objective of this research was to assess the effects of repetitive straight leg raise (SLR) NDM on the fluid dynamics within the fourth lumbar nerve root in unembalmed cadavers. Methods A biomimetic solution (Toluidine Blue Stock 1% and Plasma) was injected intraneurally, deep to the epineurium, into the L4 nerve roots of seven unembalmed cadavers. The initial dye spread was allowed to stabilise and measured with a digital calliper. Once the initial longitudinal dye spread stabilised, an intervention strategy (repetitive SLR) was applied incorporating NDMs (stretch/relax cycles) at a rate of 30 repetitions per minute for 5âminutes. Post-intervention calliper measurements of the longitudinal dye spread were measured. Results The mean experimental posttest longitudinal dye spread measurement (1.1âÂ±â0.9âmm) was significantly greater (Pâ=â0.02) than the initial stabilised pretest longitudinal dye spread measurement. Increases ranged from 0.0 to 2.6âmm and represented an average of 7.9% and up to an 18.1% increase in longitudinal dye spread. Discussion Passive NDM in the form of repetitive SLR induced a significant increase in longitudinal fluid dispersion in the L4 nerve root of human cadaveric specimen. Lower limb NDM may be beneficial in promoting nerve function by limiting or altering intraneural fluid accumulation within the nerve root, thus preventing the adverse effects of intraneural oedema.

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images from the patient record database at a dental hospital were selected. The anonymized CBCT images were reconstructed and examined in three planes (coronal, axial and sagittal) using 3D viewing software. The relationship between each root apex of mandibular second molars and the IAN was evaluated by measuring the horizontal and vertical distances from coronal CBCT sections, and the actual distance was then calculated mathematically using Pythagoras' theorem. In 55% of the 272 mandibular second molar roots evaluated, from a total of 134 scans, the distance between the anatomical root apex and the IAN was â¤3Â mm. In over 50% of the cases evaluated, there was an intimate relationship between the roots of mandibular second molars and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Therefore, root canal treatment of mandibular second molars may pose a more significant potential risk of IAN injury; necessary precautions should be exercised, and the prudent use of CBCT should be considered if an intimate relationship is suspected.

Diaphragm paralysis is possible in phrenic nerve roots ischemia in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We examined whether there is a relationship between phrenic nerve root ischemia and respiratory disturbances in SAH. This study was conducted on 5 healthy control and 14 rabbits with experimentally induced SAH by injecting autologous blood into their cisterna magna. Animals were followed up via monitors for detecting the heart and respiration rhythms for 20 days and then decapitaed by humanely. Normal and degenerated neuron densities of phrenic nerve root at the level of C4 dorsal root ganglia (C4DRG) were estimated by Stereological methods. Between the mean numerical density of degenerated neurons of C4DRG and respiratory rate/minute of groups were compared statistically. Phrenic nerve roots, artery and diaphragm muscles degeneration was detected in respiratory arrest developed animals. The mean neuronal density of C4DRG was 13272 Â±1201/mm3 with a mean respiration rate of 23 Â±4/min in the control group. The mean degenerated neuron density was 2.240 Â±450/mm(3) and respiration rhythm was 31 Â±6/min in survivors. But, the mean degenerated neuron density was 5850 Â±650/mm(3) and mean respiration rhythm was 34 Â±7/min in respiratory arrest developed animals (n = 7). A linear relationship was noticed between the degenerated neuron density of C4DRG and respiraton rate (r = -0.758; p < 0.001). Phrenic nerve root ischemia may be an important factor in respiration rhythms deteriorations in SAH which has not been mentioned in the literature.\n\nDeficiency in Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) in Mice Delays Regeneration of Peripheral Nerves following Sciatic Nerve Crush\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorrison, Brett M.; Tsingalia, Akivaga; Vidensky, Svetlana; Lee, Youngjin; Jin, Lin; Farah, Mohamed H.; Lengacher, Sylvain; Magistretti, Pierre J.; Pellerin, Luc; Rothstein, Jeffrey D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPeripheral nerve regeneration following injury occurs spontaneously, but many of the processes require metabolic energy. The mechanism of energy supply to axons has not previously been determined. In the central nervous system, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), expressed in oligodendroglia, is critical for supplying lactate or other energy metabolites to axons. In the current study, MCT1 is shown to localize within the peripheral nervous system to perineurial cells, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and Schwann cells by MCT1 immunofluorescence and MCT1 tdTomato BAC reporter mice. To investigate whether MCT1 is necessary for peripheral nerve regeneration, sciatic nerves in MCT1 heterozygous null mice are crushed and peripheral nerve regeneration quantified electrophysiologically and anatomically. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recovery is delayed from a median of 21 days in wild-type mice to greater than 38 days in MCT1 heterozygote null mice. In fact, half of the MCT1 heterozygote null mice have no recovery of CMAP at 42 days, while all of the wild-type mice recovered. In addition, muscle fibers remain 40% more atrophic and neuromuscular junctions 40% more denervated at 42 days post-crush in the MCT1 heterozygote null mice than wild-type mice. The delay in nerve regeneration is not only in motor axons, as the number of regenerated axons in the sural sensory nerve of MCT1 heterozygote null mice at 4 weeks and tibial mixed sensory and motor nerve at 3 weeks is also significantly reduced compared to wild-type mice. This delay in regeneration may be partly through failed Schwann cell function, as there is reduced early phagocytosis of myelin debris and remyelination of axon segments. These data for the first time demonstrate that MCT1 is critical for regeneration of both sensory and motor axons in mice following sciatic nerve crush.

From January 2009-January 2013, 163 patients with DD were assigned to the construction (nâ=â106) or validation sample (nâ=â57) according to different admission times to hospital. Outcome was assessed according to the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) recovery rate as excellent, good, fair, and poor. The first two results were considered as effective clinical outcome (ECO). Baseline patient and clinical characteristics were considered as secondary variables. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to construct a model with the ECO as a dependent variable and other factors as explanatory variables. The odds ratios (ORs) of each risk factor were adjusted and transformed into a scoring system. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and validated in both internal and external samples. Moreover, calibration plot and predictive ability of this scoring system were also tested for further validation. Patients with DD with ECOs in both construction and validation models were around 76Â % (76.4 and 75.5Â % respectively). more preoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) score (ORâ=â1.56, pâ<â0.01), stenosis levels of L4/5 or L5/S1 (ORâ=â1.44, pâ=â0.04), stenosis locations with neuroforamen (ORâ=â1.95, pâ=â0.01), neurological deficit (ORâ=â1.62, pâ=â0.01), and more VAS improvement of selective nerve route block (SNRB) (ORâ=â3.42, pâ=â0.02). the internal area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85, and the external AUC was 0.72, with a good calibration plot of prediction accuracy. Besides, the predictive ability of ECOs was not different from the actual results (pâ=â0.532). We have constructed and validated a predictive model for confirming responsible nerve roots in patients with DD. The associated risk factors were preoperative VAS score, stenosis levels of L4/5 or L5/S1, stenosis locations\n\nLack of effectiveness of laser therapy applied to the nerve course and the correspondent medullary roots\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSousa, Fausto Fernandes de Almeida; Ribeiro, ThaÃ­s Lopes; Fazan, ValÃ©ria Paula Sassoli; Barbieri, Claudio Henrique\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of low intensity laser irradiation on the regeneration of the fibular nerve of rats after crush injury. METHODS: Twenty-five rats were used, divided into three groups: 1) intact nerve, no treatment; 2) crushed nerve, no treatment; 3) crush injury, laser irradiation applied on the medullary region corresponding to the roots of the sciatic nerve and subsequently on the course of the damaged nerve. Laser irradiation was carried out for 14 consecutive days. RESULTS: Animals were evaluated by functional gait analysis with the peroneal functional index and by histomorphometric analysis using the total number of myelinated nerve fibers and their density, total number of Schwann cells, total number of blood vessels and the occupied area, minimum diameter of the fiber diameter and G-quotient. CONCLUSION: According to the statistical analysis there was no significant difference among groups and the authors conclude that low intensity laser irradiation has little or no influence on nerve regeneration and functional recovery.

To answer this question, we compared the frequency of nerve root injuries for multiple open versus MIS operations including diskectomy, laminectomy with/without fusion addressing degenerative disc disease, stenosis, and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. Methods: Several of Desai et al. large Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial studies showed the frequency for nerve root injury following an open diskectomy ranged from 0.13% to 0.25%, for open laminectomy/stenosis with/without fusion it was 0%, and for open laminectomy/stenosis/degenerative spondylolisthesis with/without fusion it was 2%. Results: Alternatively, one study compared the incidence of root injuries utilizing MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) versus posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) techniques; 7.8% of PLIF versus 2% of TLIF patients sustained root injuries. Furthermore, even higher frequencies of radiculitis and nerve root injuries occurred during anterior lumbar interbody fusions (ALIFs) versus extreme lateral interbody fusions (XLIFs). These high frequencies were far from acceptable; 15.8% following ALIF experienced postoperative radiculitis, while 23.8% undergoing XLIF sustained root/plexus deficits. Conclusions: This review indicates that MIS (TLIF/PLIF/ALIF/XLIF) lumbar surgery resulted in a higher incidence of root injuries, radiculitis, or plexopathy versus open lumbar surgical techniques. Furthermore, even a cursory look at the XLIF data demonstrated the greater danger posed to neural tissue by this newest addition to the MIS lumbar surgical armamentariu. The latter should prompt us as spine surgeons to question why the XLIF procedure is still being offered to our patients?

Changes of Ryk protein expression in DRG neurons after unilateral sciatic nerve injury were investigated by immunostaining. Changes of Ryk mRNA were also tested by semi-quantitative PCR concurrently. We found, both at the level of protein and mRNA, that Ryk could be induced in cells of ipsilateral DRG after unilateral sciatic nerve lesion. Further investigation by co-immunostaining confirmed that the Ryk-immunoreactive (Ryk-IR) cells were NeuN-immunoreactive (NeuN-IR) neurons of DRG. We also showed the pattern of Ryk induction in DRG neurons after sciatic nerve injury: the number of Ryk IR neurons peaked at 2 weeks post-lesion and decreased gradually by 3 weeks post-lesion. The proportions of different sized Ryk IR neurons were also observed and counted at various stages after nerve lesion. Analysis of Ryk mRNA by RT-PCR showed the same induction pattern as by immunostaining. Ryk mRNA was not expressed in normal or contralateral DRG, but was expressed 1, 2 and 3 weeks post-lesion in the ipsilateral DRG. Ryk mRNA levels increased slightly from 1 to 2 weeks, decreased then by 3 weeks post-lesion. These results indicate that Ryk might be involved in peripheral nerve plasticity after injury. This is a novel function apart from its well-known fundamental activity as a receptor mediating axon guidance and outgrowth.\n\nDeficiency in monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) in mice delays regeneration of peripheral nerves following sciatic nerve crush.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorrison, Brett M; Tsingalia, Akivaga; Vidensky, Svetlana; Lee, Youngjin; Jin, Lin; Farah, Mohamed H; Lengacher, Sylvain; Magistretti, Pierre J; Pellerin, Luc; Rothstein, Jeffrey D\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPeripheral nerve regeneration following injury occurs spontaneously, but many of the processes require metabolic energy.

To present a rare case of intradural, subpial hemangiopericytoma in the thoracic spine, with a brief overview of the literature. Spinal intradural extramedullary hemangiopericytoma is rare entity that radiographically mimics nerve-sheath tumors. These lesions are typically diagnosed at surgery performed due to suspicion of tumor. A 20-year-old man who presented with back pain, leg weakness, and sphincter incontinence. MR imaging demonstrated an intradural extramedullary lesion at the T9-T10 level that was isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and homogeneously enhancing after administration of gadolinium, with cystic components seen on T2-weighted images. The preoperative diagnosis was meningioma or schwannoma. At surgery, the lesion was bluish and completely subpial, with apparent nerve root invasion. Pathological examination revealed a neoplasm adjacent to a nerve root with possible focal infiltration. Abundant reticulin fibers and widened, branching vascular channels imparting a staghorn appearance were seen. Up to five mitotic figures were counted in one high-power field. On immunostaining, the neoplastic cells were diffusely immunoreactive for CD99 and immunonegative for EMA, CD34, and S-100 protein. The pathological diagnosis was consistent with anaplastic hemangiopericytoma, WHO grade III. This is the ninth report of spinal intradural hemangiopericytoma. The location of the neoplasm supports the hypothesis that hemangiopericytoma may arise from the spinal pial capillaries.\n\nNew technique targeting the C5 nerve root proximal to the traditional interscalene sonoanatomical approach is analgesic for outpatient arthroscopic shoulder surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nDobie, Katherine H; Shi, Yaping; Shotwell, Matthew S; Sandberg, Warren S\n\n2016-11-01\n\nRegional anesthesia and analgesia for shoulder surgery is most commonly performed via interscalene nerve block. We developed an ultrasound-guided technique that specifically targets the C5 nerve root proximal to the traditional interscalene block and assessed its efficacy for shoulder analgesia. Prospective case series. Vanderbilt Bone and Joint Surgery Center. Patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy at an ambulatory surgery center. Thirty-five outpatient shoulder arthroscopy patients underwent an analgesic nerve block using a new technique where ultrasound visualization of the C5 nerve root served as the primary target at a level proximal to the traditional interscalene approach. The block was performed with 15mL of 0.5% plain ropivicaine. Post anesthesia care unit pain scores, opioid consumption, hand strength, and duration of block were recorded. Cadaver dissection after injection with methylene blue confirmed that the primary target under ultrasound visualization was the C5 nerve root. Pain scores revealed 97% patients had 0/10 pain at arrival to PACU, with 91% having a pain score of 3/10 or less at discharge from PACU. Medical Research Council (MRC) hand strength mean (SD) score was 4.17 (0.92) on a scale of 1-5. The mean (SD) duration of the block was 13.9 (3.5) hours. A new technique for ultrasound-guided blockade at the level of the C5 nerve root proximal to the level of the traditional interscalene block is efficacious for shoulder post-operative pain control.

The purpose of this study is to specifically analyze patient-derived sensory outcomes over time in patients with intentional C2 nerve root transection during atlantoaxial segmental screw fixation compared with those without transection. This is a post-hoc comparative analysis of prospectively collected patient-derived outcome data. The sample consists of 24 consecutive patients who underwent intentional bilateral transection of the C2 nerve root during posterior atlantoaxial segmental screw fixation (transection group) and subsequent 41 consecutive patients without transection (preservation group). A visual analog scale (VAS) score was used for occipital neuralgia as the primary outcome measure and VAS score for neck pain, neck disability index score and Japanese Orthopedic Association score for cervical myelopathy and recovery rate, with bone union rate as the secondary outcome measure. Patient-derived outcomes including change in VAS score for occipital neuralgia over time were statistically compared between the two groups. This study was not supported by any financial sources and there is no topic-specific conflict of interest related to the authors of this study. Seven (29%) of the 24 patients in the transection group experienced increased neuralgic pain at 1 month after surgery either because of newly developed occipital neuralgia or aggravation of preexisting occipital neuralgia. Four of the seven patients required almost daily medication even at the final follow-up (44 and 80 months). On the other hand, only four (10%) of 41 patients in the preservation group had increased neuralgic pain at 1 month after surgery, and at â¥ 1\n\nResidual neurological function after sacral root resection during en-bloc sacrectomy: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nZoccali, Carmine; Skoch, Jesse; Patel, Apar S; Walter, Christina M; Maykowski, Philip; Baaj, Ali A\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSacrectomy is a highly demanding surgery representing the main treatment for primary tumors arising in the sacrum and pelvis. Unfortunately, it is correlated with loss of important function depending on the resection level and nerve roots sacrificed. The current literature regarding residual function after sacral resection comes from several small case series. The goal of this review is to appraise residual motor function and gait, sensitivity, bladder, bowel, and sexual function after sacrectomies, with consideration to the specific roots sacrificed. An exhaustive literature search was conducted. All manuscripts published before May 2015 regarding residual function after sacrectomy were considered; if a clear correlation between root level and functioning was not present, the paper was excluded. The review identified 15 retrospective case series, totaling 244 patients; 42 patients underwent sacrectomies sparing L4/L4, L4/L5 and L5/L5; 45 sparing both L5 and one or both S1 roots; 8 sparing both S1 and one S2; 48 sparing both S2; 11 sparing both S2 and one S3, 54 sparing both S3, 9 sparing both S3 and one or both S4, and 27 underwent unilateral variable resection. Patients who underwent a sacrectomy maintained functionally normal ambulation in 56.2Â % of cases when both S2 roots were spared, 94.1Â % when both S3 were spared, and in 100Â % of more distal resections. Normal bladder and bowel function were not present when both S2 were cut. When one S2 root was spared, normal bladder function was present in 25Â % of cases; when both S2 were spared, 39.9Â %; when one S3 was spared, 72.7Â %; and when both S3 were spared, 83.3Â %. Abnormal bowel function was present in 12.5Â % of cases when both S1 and one S2 were spared; in 50.0Â % of cases when both S2 were spared; and in 70Â % of cases when one S3 was spared; if both S3 were spared, bowel function was normal in 94Â % of cases. When even one S4 root was spared, normal bladder and bowel function were present in 100Â % of\n\nHMG-CoA synthase isoenzymes 1 and 2 localize to satellite glial cells in dorsal root ganglia and are differentially regulated by peripheral nerve injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Fei; Xiang, Hongfei; Fischer, Gregory; Liu, Zhen; Dupont, Matthew J; Hogan, Quinn H; Yu, Hongwei\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn dorsal root ganglia (DRG), satellite glial cells (SGCs) tightly ensheathe the somata of primary sensory neurons to form functional sensory units. SGCs are identified by their flattened and irregular morphology and expression of a variety of specific marker proteins. In this report, we present evidence that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase isoenzymes 1 and 2 (HMGCS1 and HMGCS2) are abundantly expressed in SGCs. Immunolabeling with the validated antibodies revealed that both HMGCS1 and HMGCS2 are highly colabeled with a selection of SGC markers, including GS, GFAP, K ir 4.1, GLAST1, GDNF, and S100 but not with microglial cell marker Iba1, myelin sheath marker MBP, and neuronal marker Î²3-tubulin or phosphorylated CaMKII. HMGCS1 but not HMGCS2 immunoreactivity in SGCs is reduced in the fifth lumbar (L5) DRGs that contain axotomized neurons following L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in rats. Western blot showed that HMGCS1 protein level in axotomized L5 DRGs is reduced after SNL to 66Â±8% at 3 days (p<0.01, n=4 animals in each group) and 58Â±13% at 28 days (p<0.001, n=9 animals in each group) of its level in control samples, whereas HMGCS2 protein was comparable between injured and control DRGs. These results identify HMGCSs as the alternative markers for SGCs in DRGs. Downregulated HMGCS1 expression in DRGs after spinal nerve injury may reflect a potential role of abnormal sterol metabolism of SGCs in the nerve injured-induced neuropathic pain.

Sham animals were included. Expression of cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 3 (ATF3), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) types 1 and -2 was analysed seven days after injury. L6-S1 axotomy induced dramatic de novo expression of ATF3 in many L6-S1 DRG NPs, and parallel significant downregulations in the percentage of CGRP-, TRPV1-, TH- and VGLUT2-immunoreactive (IR) DRG NPs, as compared to their expression in uninjured DRGs (contralateral L6-S1-AXO; sham mice); VGLUT1 expression remained unaltered. Sham L6-S1 DRGs only showed a small ipsilateral increase in ATF3-IR NPs (other markers were unchanged). L6-S1-AXO induced de novo expression of ATF3 in several lumbosacral spinal cord motoneurons and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons; in sham mice the effect was limited to a few motoneurons. Finally, a moderate decrease in CGRP- and TRPV1-like-immunoreactivities was observed in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn neuropil. In conclusion, injury of a mixed visceral/non-visceral nerve leads to considerable neurochemical alterations in DRGs matched, to some extent, in the spinal cord. Changes in these and potentially other nociception-related molecules could contribute to pain due to injury of nerves in the abdominopelvic cavity.\n\n[Effects of Chinese herbal medicine Yiqi Huayu Recipe on apoptosis of dorsal root ganglion neurons and expression of caspase-3 in rats with lumbar nerve root compression].\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Le-qin; Li, Xiao-feng; Zhang, You-wei; Shu, Bing; Shi, Qi; Wang, Yong-jun; Zhou, Chong-jian\n\n2010-12-01\n\nTo observe the effects of Yiqi Huayu Recipe, a Chinese compound herbal medicine, on apoptosis of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and expression of caspase-3 in rats after lumbar nerve root compression injury. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups: control group, untreated group, Methylcobal group and Yiqi Huayu Recipe group. Surgery was performed on rats of untreated group, Methylcobal group and Yiqi Huayu Recipe group to place a micro-silica gel on right Lâ DRG, while control group received skin and paravertebral muscle incision only. Rats in Methylcobal group and Yiqi Huayu Recipe group were given Methylcobal by intramuscular injection and Yiqi Huayu Recipe intragastrically respectively. Rats in control group and untreated group received saline intragastrically as equal amount as Yiqi Huayu Recipe group. The compressed nerve roots were harvested at the 10th day after treatment. Apoptosis of DRG neurons was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling. Caspase-3 activity and mRNA expression in compressed nerve roots were detected with spectrophotography and real-time polymerase chain reaction respectively. Apoptosis of DRG neurons was significantly increased in the rat model. The apoptosis index of untreated group was higher than that of control group (P<0.01). Yiqi Huayu Recipe and Methylcobal could reduce the apoptosis of DRG neurons, and both groups showed a lower apoptosis index than untreated group (P<0.01). Caspase-3 activity and its gene expression were significantly increased in untreated group. The levels of caspase-3 activity and its gene expression in untreated group were higher than those in control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Yiqi Huayu Recipe and Methylcobal could reduce the overexpression of caspase-3 mRNA, and statistically significant differences were found between the untreated group and Yiqi Huayu Recipe group or Methylcobal group (P<0.01). Lumbar nerve root compression\n\nDistortion-free diffusion tensor imaging for evaluation of lumbar nerve roots: Utility of direct coronal single-shot turbo spin-echo diffusion sequence.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Takayuki; Doi, Kunio; Yoneyama, Masami; Watanabe, Atsuya; Miyati, Tosiaki; Yanagawa, Noriyuki\n\n2018-06-01\n\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on a single-shot echo planer imaging (EPI-DTI) is an established method that has been used for evaluation of lumbar nerve disorders in previous studies, but EPI-DTI has problems such as a long acquisition time, due to a lot of axial slices, and geometric distortion. To solve these problems, we attempted to apply DTI based on a single-shot turbo spin echo (TSE-DTI) with direct coronal acquisition. Our purpose in this study was to investigate whether TSE-DTI may be more useful for evaluation of lumbar nerve disorders than EPI-DTI. First, lumbar nerve roots of five healthy volunteers were evaluated for optimization of imaging parameters with TSE-DTI including b-values and the number of motion proving gradient (MPG) directions. Subsequently, optimized TSE-DTI was quantitatively compared with conventional EPI-DTI by using fractional anisotropy (FA) values and visual scores in subjective visual evaluation of tractography. Lumbar nerve roots of six patients, who had unilateral neurologic symptoms in one leg, were evaluated by the optimized TSE-DTI. TSE-DTI with b-value of 400â¯s/mm 2 and 32 diffusion-directions could reduce the image distortion compared with EPI-DTI, and showed that the average FA values on the symptomatic side for six patients were significantly lower than those on the non-symptomatic side (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Tractography with TSE-DTI might show damaged areas of lumbar nerve roots without severe image distortion. TSE-DTI might improve the reproducibility in measurements of FA values for quantification of a nerve disorder, and would become a useful tool for diagnosis of low back pain.
