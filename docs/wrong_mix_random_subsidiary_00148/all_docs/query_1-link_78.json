        "text": "What pre-1985 science fiction are you reading or planning to read this month?\n\nHere’s April’s installment of this column.\n\nFirst, a bit about Isaac Asimov’s Foundation (1951) from M. Keith Booker’s Monsters, Mushroom Clouds, and the Cold War: American Science Fiction and the Roots of Postmodernism, 1946-1964 (2001), my current history of science fiction read:\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHere’s to a happy 2024! I hope you had a successful reading year. Maybe you pulled down some dusty tome that you’ve wanted to dive into for a decade. I’d like to imagine you finally picked up a book I raved about in years past that you acquired with great anticipation but never opened. Whether you are a lurker, occasional visitor, or a regular commenter, thank you for your continued support and wonderful conversation.\n\nWhat were your favorite vintage SF reads–published pre-1985–of 2023? Let me know in the comments.\n\nContinuing a trend, I read only a handful of novels this year. Instead, my obsessions focused on my science short story review initiatives (listed below), collections, and histories of the science fiction genre. Without further ado, here are my favorite novels and short stories I read in 2023 with bonus categories. I made sure to link my longer reviews where applicable if you want a deeper dive into the rich seam of science fictional gems.\n\nCheck out last year’s rundown if you haven’t already for more spectacular reads. I have archived all my annual rundowns on my article index page if you wanted to peruse earlier years.\n\nMy Top 5 Science Fiction Novels of 2022\n\n1. Edgar Pangborn’s Davy (1964), 5/5 (Masterpiece): Nominated for the 1965 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Full review.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Under Compulsion (variant title: Fun with Your New Head), Thomas M. Disch (1968)\n\nFrom the back cover: “A BLACK BANQUET OF PURE DISCH\n\nA part-human, part-electronic brain going slowly mad in the Venus jungle.\n\nThe last man on earth rejecting the last woman.\n\nA Russian astronaut looking for a good reason to die on the moon.\n\nA chilling glimpse of a 21st century America where war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength–and they like it like that.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Quicksand, John Brunner (1967)\n\nFrom the back cover: “She had nearly killed a man who tried to assault her. She spoke a language no one could understand. Commonplace objects like clothing and cars were a mystery to her.\n\nPaul was haunted and entranced by her. He licked at the secrecy that surrounded her until, inevitably, his fate became linked to hers. And she gave him a vision of a world more beautiful than any he had ever known.\n\nTHEY LIVED IN A PARADISES OF SENSUAL ECSTACY… UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. BECAUSE HER LOVE WAS LIKE QUICKSAND.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: My Brunner obsession in my early 20s generated a packed few years of reading as many novels–the good and the bad–that I could get my hands on. This one escaped my grasp.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAs always, which books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Worlds Without End, Clifford D. Simak (1964)\n\nFrom the back cover: “A link between yesterday and the tomorrow that was here already…. Dreams constructed and maintained by society…. A world-to-world search for an elusive secret…. The bizarre, weird, strange creations of things and worlds only Clifford D. Simak could have written… and make believable.”\n\nContents: “Worlds Without End” (1956), “The Spaceman’s Van Gogh” (1956), “Full Cycle” (1955)\n\nContinue reading →\n\n(From the uncredited cover for the 1975 edition of The Invincible (1964), Stanislaw Lem)\n\nI’ve updated the website template (and purchased the domain name) and would like to know if it is easy to navigate (especially on mobile devices). Obviously I can’t please everyone but hope that it is more streamlined and 2017 than before.\n\nI started Science Fiction and Other Suspect Ruminations way back in 2010. My first post bashed John Brunner’s Born Under Mars (1967) in vaguely substantive terms (sometimes I think about deleting my earliest reviews). Since then I have written some 300 odd review reviews, 114 cover art posts, and various film reviews, indices, lists, guest post series, an interview, etc. With all of this in mind, I thought I’d give you a sense of what is on the horizon.\n\nReminder: If you’re the emailing rather than commenting sort I can be reached at ciceroplatobooks (at) gmail (dot) com.\n\nThe Three Major Projects\n\n1) I’m in the process of compiling a resource page for Barry N. Malzberg that would include links to reviews/interviews/academic articles from around the web. Let me know if there are any links you would like me to include. Even if you aren’t a Barry N. Malzberg fan, if you happen to come across in your SF perambulations any relevant information I’d be very appreciative if you’d send them my way.\n\nResource/article INDEX\n\n2) This will appeal to far more readers. Over the last few years I’ve been slowly working my way towards a “My Favorite 1970s SF Novels List.” Continue reading →\n\nLittle pleases me more than reading the fascinating cross-section of the genre presented by anthologies from my favorite era of SF (1960s/70s). After the success that was World’s Best Science Fiction: 1967 (variant title: World’s Best Science Fiction: Third Series) (1967), ed. Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, I decided to browse my “to post” pile of recent acquisitions and share a handful with you all. As is often the case, the collections are peppered with stories I’ve already read—I’ve linked the relevant reviews.\n\nFilled with authors I haven’t read yet—Stephen Tall, Robin Scott, Roderick Thorp, Jean Cox, Christopher Finch, etc.\n\n…and of course, many of my favorites including Gene Wolfe, Ursula Le Guin, Barry N. Malzberg, and Kate Wilhelm (among many many others).\n\nScans are from my collection.\n\n1. The 1972 Annual World’s Best SF, ed. Donald A. Wollheim (1972)\n\n(John Schoenherr’s cover for the 1972 edition) Continue reading →\n\nI still have not reviewed one of my favorite novels (tied with Christopher Priest’s 1981 masterpiece The Affirmation) that I read in 2016: Angela Carter’s The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (1972). I have an excuse—I successfully defended my PhD earlier this month and am currently revising the 300+ page dissertation for final submission later this summer! And, I must confess, the fear that I won’t be able to do The Infernal Desire Machines justice envelopes me….\n\nOn May 7th Angela Carter Online [an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about her life and works] posted a previously unpublished 1979 interview with Carter conducted by David Pringle for a New Worlds volume that never came together: “The conversation focuses mostly on the topic of science fiction, and includes discussions of the seminal Continue reading →\n\nThere is no better way to celebrate the New Year than with a pile of vintage SF acquisitions!\n\nYou might notice the predominance over the coming weeks of UK publishers (Pan, Granada, Panther)—the images correspond to my editions. I acquired nine via a “secret” UK pipeline for a mere $3.50 each (with shipping) as a gift from my wife. Cue bad Chris Foss copycat (Tony Roberts and his ilk) covers. The disconnect between Thomas M. Disch’s 334 (1972) and the Tony Roberts spaceship pains me.\n\nThe books: A lesser known Ian Watson novel. Anyone know the cover artist? His short fiction inspires: A Very Slow Time Machine (1979). I found Jonah Kit (1975) worthwhile although I never reviewed it.\n\nA Jack Vance novel that explores the nature of language…\n\nA collection of early PKD stories. I’ve read the majority of his short fiction in my omnibus collections of his work but it might be worth the reread.\n\nAnd finally, what I am most excited about, Disch’s best known collection of thematically linked short fiction….\n\nEnjoy! As always, thoughts and comments are welcome.\n\n1. Alien Embassy, Ian Watson (1977)\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1979 edition) Continue reading →"
