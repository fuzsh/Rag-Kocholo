        "text": "The first thing you need to know about 334, other than the fact that it's one of the more depressing of Disch's works, is that it's actually not a novel at all. In fact it consists of 5 short stories and one novella all set in a future New York city where most of population live in high rise public housing. 334 is the address of one of these apartment blocks and it's also the location of most (but not all) of the major characters.\n\nDisch presents us with a familiar dystopia (well, familiar if you've been reading his work for the last two months like I have). It's dark and grimy and dirty and filled with people who are either looking for a better life (but failing miserably) or trying very hard to deal with the existence they've been handed (and still failing miserably). Each of the shorter pieces highlights a different aspects of this dismal society. The Death of Socrates tells the very sad story about a resident of 334, Birdie, whose gone to College in the hopeless attempt to lift his Regency Score, a sort of IQ test which, amongst other things, determines whether you can have kids or not. He's desperate to have children with his girlfriend Milly, but raising his score is proving to be a struggle.\n\nAnd then there's Bodies, which is both hilarious and confusing and frustrating (because it doesn't really end) where morgue attendant, Ab, sells the bodies of the recently dead to necrophiliacs and sexual perverts. Ab's life is turned upside down when the family of one of the recent corpses asks for the body so they can put it into cryogenic storage. All the stuff with Ab trying to get back the body or get a replacement is great. But there's all sorts of periphery stuff in the story that doesn't seem to fit or go anywhere. It's also only tangentially features 334 (the residence) though it is set in the same Universe.\n\nEveryday Life in the Later Roman Empire is very dull, and struggles to get out of first gear. It's about Alexa (who does admin work for 334, though this is never made entirely clear) who takes drugs so she can escape to another life in the Roman Empire. The idea of the drug that basically transports you to a Second Life, is interesting. But Alexa's story stumbles around and like Bodies doesn't actually seem to have an end.\n\nEmancipation, though, is a much better story featuring the character of Milly from the first story. Milly gets pregnant, but it's her husband Boz Hanson (not Milly) who wants to actually carry the baby to term. The story is actually quite sweet and probably one of the few love stories that Disch wrote. Don't get me wrong, it's a dysfunctional love - it wouldn't be Disch otherwise. But the last few passages of the story are both not only a bit romantic and a bit lovely but also some of Disch's most optimistic writing.\n\nAnd there's Angouleme, which is a about of bunch of kids who live in 334 and are looking for someone to kill. It's an OK story with a reasonable ending, but lacks a certain punch.\n\nAnd then comes the novella, 334, which is really where the brilliance of this book lies. While the other stories offered us snippets of New York city in decline, it's 334 that really forces us to look at the miserable heart of this future society. And it isn't nice. The Hanson family, who Disch has introduced in the previous stories, are smart people. All of them, that is the mother, the two daughters (Donna and Shrimp) and the son (Boz) have close to genius level regency scores. But other than the fact that this allows them to have children, and in the case of one daughter, children she farms out to the State, they live an aimless life in 334. Their ambitions are small to be nearly non-existent. There's no dreams of being rich and famous. Rather, the Hanson's survive from day to day with the hope that they might find love or kindness or a relationship that's reasonably fulfilling.\n\nIt's bloody depressing. And at times it's hard to keep reading about these people and their sad, despairing lives.\n\nI did wonder, at first, whether 334 was an attack on a social welfare society. For the most part, Disch's future society cares for it's residence by providing them with housing, free health care (from what I could tell) and jobs. Everyone who wants to be employed in this world, is employed. And yet, this very same society provides nothing at all for the residents to strive for. Yeah, there's TV and books and some a drug that can transport you into a life you never led, but none of it is real or tangible. And in reading that, a part of me wonders whether Disch is arguing that an over paternalistic system of Government has the effect of coddling and swaddling all the inspiration and imagination out of us.\n\nBut really, this is a commentary on our world and our current lives. As George Turner correctly points out in 1975 review of the book, 334 is a purely mainstream or literary work told in SF terms. While I was reading the novel I did wonder why Disch bothered to set the book in the future. Take away a few of the SFnal elements and 334 could easily be a book about the New York city of the 1970s or the 80s or today. Because unlike most SF of the 70s, or of today, 334 is not about dazzling us with ideas or allowing us to escape to other worlds, he wants to force us to reflect on the world around us. And as a result, it makes 334 tough going at times. As much as I wanted to engage with the book and the characters, there were times when I found it hard to continue. It all seem too real.\n\n334 is a remarkable book."
