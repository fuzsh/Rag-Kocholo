        "text": "Thomas M. Disch Or Thomas Michael Disch (February 2, 1940 – July 4, 2008) was an American science fiction author and poet. He won the Hugo Award for Best Related Book – previously called \"Best Non-Fiction Book\" – in 1999, and he had two other Hugo nominations and nine Nebula Award nominations to his credit, plus one win of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, a Rhysling Award, and two Seiun Awards, among others.\n\nHis writing began appearing in science-fiction magazines in the Sixties. His critically acclaimed science fiction novels, The Genocides, Camp Concentration and 334 are major contributions to the New Wave science fiction movement. In 1996, his book The Castle Of Indolence: On Poetry, Poets, And Poetasters was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award,[4] and in 1999, Disch won the Nonfiction Hugo for The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of, a meditation on the impact of science fiction on our culture, as well as the Michael Braude Award for Light Verse. Among his other nonfiction work, he wrote theatre and opera criticism for The New York Times, The Nation, and other periodicals. He published several volumes of poetry as Tom Disch.\n\nFollowing an extended period of depression after the death in 2005 of his life-partner, Charles Naylor, Disch stopped writing except for poetry and blog entries – although he did produce two novellas. Disch killed himself by gunshot on July 4, 2008. in his apartment in Manhattan, New York City. Naylor and Disch are buried alongside each other at Saint Johns Episcopal Church Columbarium, Dubuque, Iowa. His last book, The Word Of God, which was written shortly before Naylor died, had just been published a few days before Disch's death. His last short story collection, The Wall Of America, Disch's first in over 25 years, was published posthumously, several months later.\n\nBibliography[]\n\n334\n\nCamp Concentration\n\nThe Dreams Our Stuff is Made of\n\nExternal[]"
