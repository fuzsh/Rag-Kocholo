Hanging on it are nearly thirty photos I’ve collected over the years of me standing beside the game’s best signalcallers, including several I’ve been privileged to play against. Scanning the collection, you’ll ﬁnd many of the great ones: Troy Aikman, Brett Favre, Dan Marino, Steve Young, John Elway, Phil Simms, Jim Kelly, Warren Moon, Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, George Blanda. I like to glance at those guys while I’m working out. You’ll also ﬁnd photos of my two all-time favorite quarterbacks—my dad Archie Manning and my brother Eli—as well as one of my all-time nonfamily favorites: Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts. I knew about Johnny Unitas from stories my dad told me, and every time I look at the photo, I think of the opportunity I had a few years back to let Johnny know in person how much I admired and respected him. In 1997 I was the recipient of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and at the banquet that year I presented the Hall of Famer with a pair of black high-top football shoes. Anyone who had the privilege of watching number 19 play will know exactly what those shoes symbolize. Now, take a closer look at the wall. Focus in on a place of honor near the center of my quarterback collection. You’ll see a photo of an elderly man in\n\nIX\n\nHolley Pages2.indd ix\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\na baseball cap and sweatpants sitting on a bench outside on a bright, sunny day; at his side is a barefoot young man in shorts and a golf shirt. The two men are laughing, obviously enjoying each other’s company. That picture holds a special place in my heart. The young man is me; the older is Slingin’ Sammy Baugh, arguably the greatest quarterback ever to play the game. Even more important to me, he was a man I was proud to call a friend. As you’ll come to know in the pages that follow, Sam Baugh was not only a great athlete but also one of the ﬁnest guys you’d ever want to meet. Let me tell you how I came to know him. In the late summer of 2000, shortly before training camp opened for my third NFL season, I got a call from Sports Illustrated. The magazine was planning to run a story that would spotlight two NFL players at each position—the player they felt had deﬁned the position during the twentieth century and the player who would lead it into the twenty-ﬁrst. Sam and I were their picks at quarterback. I was honored to be chosen, of course, but one of the stipulations was that the new player had to visit the home of the old, which presented a bit of a challenge. We had to do it quickly because of the magazine’s deadline and because teams were about to go to training camp. I ended up going to see Sam in a hearse. (More about that later.) I had heard of Slingin’ Sammy Baugh. I knew he had played for the Redskins, knew he had been a great passer and was in the NFL Hall of Fame, but I didn’t know much more than that. I called my dad and told him how excited I was about being chosen and how I was looking forward to meeting a bona ﬁde football legend. I asked him what he knew about Sam, and he reminded me that not only had Sam been an All-American at TCU and a Redskins star for many years, he also had been a magniﬁcent punter and had played defensive back. Needless to say, times have changed. I was familiar with Horned Frog football from an earlier era, having won the Davey O’Brien Award as a senior at the University of Tennessee. O’Brien, of course, was Sam’s Heisman-winning successor at TCU. I’ve been back to the annual banquet several times since and have gotten to know the O’Brien family, but I was eager to learn more about Sam. Dad said we also had almost a family connection to Slingin’ Sam. One of the great inﬂuences on my dad’s life was Johnny Vaught, the legendary coach at Ole Miss during my dad’s playing days. Coach Vaught had been Sam’s teammate at TCU in the 1930s. Dad said that Coach Vaught thought highly of Sammy Baugh and used to tell stories about his exploits. Dad said he also had heard about how, when\n\nX\n\nHolley Pages2.indd x\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= FOR EWOR D =\n\nSam himself became a coach—at Hardin-Simmons—he would come out at halftime during games and hold punting and passing clinics. Fans were almost as eager to see the old Redskins quarterback’s pinpoint passing and precision punting as they were to see the game itself. Not something you see every day, right? Anyway, Sports Illustrated told me I would have to get to Rotan, Texas, for the photo shoot. I had no idea where Rotan was, but the magazine told me I could hitch a ride on the private plane that was ferrying the ﬁlm crew to West Texas. They would pick me up in New Orleans, and then we would ﬂy together to Snyder, not far from Sam’s ranch near Rotan. The plan worked perfectly until we got to Snyder and couldn’t ﬁnd a vehicle big enough to transport the six-person ﬁlm and photo crew, all the equipment, and myself. That’s how we ended up piling into the biggest car in town, a long, black hearse, to get to Sam’s Double Mountain Ranch. I made sure I didn’t sit in the back. I’ll never forget that day at the ranch. It was just a very, very special day for me. Throughout the day, while the ﬁlm crews were setting up, Sam and I got to visit with each other, just the two of us. I got to ask him about O’Brien, about Coach Vaught. I asked what it was like playing in Washington during the ’40s. I remember I asked him whether he had met any presidents during his playing days. He told me he didn’t give much thought to Washington, D.C., or politics, or presidents. He was there to play football, to do the best he could. Once the season was over, he would pack his bags and head home to Rotan to ride horses and rope and be a cowboy. Life on the ranch was his passion, that and football. Here’s what else I remember: Sam Baugh was a world champion cusser and tobacco-chewer. He usually had his spitter right beside him. Fortunately, he could hit that coffee can as accurately as he could hit a receiver during his playing days. I also learned that he was a man who knew his own mind and wasn’t afraid to express it. At one point during the day, one of the photographers came over to us with an idea. “Sammy,” he said, “I’d like to get the two of y’all pitching horseshoes together.” That was fine with me but not with Sam. “I don’t pitch horseshoes,” Sammy told him. “Well, you know, Sammy, just kind of for the picture, we thought it would be kind of neat having two quarterbacks throwing horseshoes,” the photographer said, all the while getting his camera ready for the shoot.\n\nXI\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xi\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nSammy aimed a stream of tobacco at the grass (not at the photographer) and looked up at the man. “I don’t know if you couldn’t hear me the ﬁrst time,” he said. “I don’t pitch horseshoes.” That was the end of that. In the photo that ran in the magazine, Sam is chewing tobacco and I’m sitting beside him drinking iced tea. The “Mail Pouch” chewing tobacco thermometer on the wall of the shed behind us registers 105 degrees. We’re just sort of sitting there shooting the bull about football and whatever else came to mind. It was, to me, a more appropriate picture than us pitching horseshoes would have been. A friend of Sam’s, Bob O’Day, told me that the Cotton Bowl people had been after Sam for years to come back to Dallas for a ceremony. (He and his fellow Horned Frogs played in the inaugural Cotton Bowl game.) Sam would always tell them, “Just move that Cotton Bowl to Rotan, and I’ll be there in a heartbeat.” Once again, it kind of told you who he was. He was a man who, as long as it didn’t hurt anybody, was going to do things his way. Sam told me that day at the ranch that he still enjoyed football and especially liked watching Troy Aikman, the superb quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. He also told me he enjoyed watching me play. From that day on, he said, he would follow my career even more closely. That made me feel good. I left the ranch that day—in the hearse—with great respect for Sam Baugh. I never saw him again, but we stayed in touch. Sam died eight years later, on December 17, 2008. That next Sunday we played Jacksonville, and on my wristband I wrote “SB,” in tribute to my friend. As it turned out, I had a Sammy Baugh–quality day against the Jaguars: 17 straight completions to open the game, 29 of 34 completions overall for 364 yards, three touchdowns in a game that clinched a playoff spot for us. “I was slinging it tonight,” I remember telling reporters. “We were slinging it tonight.” Who knows, maybe somewhere up above that evening, Sammy Baugh was smiling—and, I’m guessing, slingin’ a couple of affectionate cuss words my way as well. Sammy Baugh was quite a guy.

She was eighty-six when I met her in the parking lot of FedEx Field, where she and friends enjoyed tailgating at almost every Washington Redskins home game. Both elegant and fun-loving, the retired U.S. Postal Service executive had seen Sammy play, and when I mentioned his name, she smiled—as did almost everyone else who talked to me about the old football player turned Texas cowboy. Like Jeanne O’Neill, they were happy to share their stories. I thank them. I am grateful to my friends at the Washington Post who encouraged me to tell Sammy’s story, including Emilio Garcia-Ruiz, Lynn Medford, Matt Vita, Matt Schudel, Pat Sullivan, and Adam Bernstein. Although this is not an authorized biography, the Baugh family was a huge help, particularly David and Jean Baugh, who sat down over David’s daily ham sandwiches at the kitchen table and talked candidly about the man who had meant so much to them. I am grateful to Sam’s old friends Bob O’Day, Sonny Nichols, Pete Hart, and many others who were willing to share their reminiscences. Thanks to my brother Ken, who made the long drive with me to Rotan and the Double Mountain Ranch and who offered suggestions and ideas\n\nXIII\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xiii\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nthroughout the writing of this book. Thanks also to my children—Heather, Rachel, Pete, and Kate—for their love and encouragement. At the University of Texas Press, my old friend David Hamrick was quick to see the need for a biography of Sammy Baugh, and my editor, Allison Faust, was a sure and steady guide throughout the long process. Kip Keller, an old football player himself, copyedited the manuscript with care and precision. Thanks also to Lynne Chapman. I owe a debt of gratitude to Bill Miller, who works his magic around the Capitol in Austin almost daily, and who came through for me in a big way. And thanks to Peyton Manning, who was willing to share his memories of Sam, despite a trying time for himself and his Indianapolis Colts. And ﬁnally, Laura. She was good-natured and patient (sort of ) when I was chained to the computer, ever encouraging when I got bogged down, and always willing to talk about the book when that was what I needed. She had so many great ideas, it almost became a joke between us. I am grateful.\n\nXIV\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xiv\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nC\n\nhicago. A dreary December afternoon so cold that anyone who dares to venture out runs the risk of frostbite, or worse. A punishing wind off frozen Lake Michigan only adds to the misery. The city is shut down, closed up, as Chicagoans seek warmth behind closed doors and boarded-up windows. On the North Side, though, home to Wrigley Field, some 15,000 football fans have braved the dangerous conditions to watch a game, a National Football League championship game between the fearsome Chicago Bears and the upstart Washington Redskins. Swaddled in layered coats and mufﬂers, wearing gloves, hats pulled down over their ears, these fans are fanatics in every sense of the word. Some caught the elevated train and rode it through a desolate downtown, the train winding its way through the canyon of tall buildings blocking out a pallid sun. Others rode streetcars past mounds of snow shoved out of roadways. Still others maneuvered Model Ts, slowly and carefully, through the icy streets. The locals have come to see their Bears, the “Monsters of the Midway,” a team of hard-nosed, big-shouldered brawlers who not only defeat their opponents almost every Sunday but also punish them in the process. Chicagoans like to think that the Bears of George Halas and Bronko Nagurski\n\nXV\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xv\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nand George Musso truly embody their big, tough, hog-butcher-to-the-world metropolis. Several thousand fans are there from out of town. They boarded a special train in Washington’s Union Station and headed west. Disembarking at Chicago’s LaSalle Street Station, fortiﬁed against the cold by ﬂasks of alcohol stashed away in their overcoats, they hailed cabs to take them to the tidy brick ballpark that baseball’s Chicago Cubs have made famous. Their Redskins are completing their ﬁrst season in Washington, but already the capital city has taken them to its heart. Years later, the NFL championship game will be called the Super Bowl. Years later, millions of football fans around the world will gather in front of their televisions to witness the spectacle. Advertisers will pay millions for a few minutes of viewing-audience time. On this cold day in Chicago, fewer than 20,000 football fans, their very sanity in question, are on hand to witness one of the pivotal games in NFL history. Shortly after noon, the two teams take the ﬁeld for the kickoff, the Bears in their dark blue jerseys trimmed in orange, the Redskins wearing their trademark burgundy and gold. Both teams wear tennis shoes, hoping to get whatever purchase they can on the ice-encrusted ﬁeld. Mist from their breathing is visible in the frigid air. The tall, spindly-legged Texan who ambles onto the frozen turf of Wrigley Field on that dreary Sunday afternoon has played in miserable weather before. The pride of Sweetwater, Texas, he has known northers that barrel across the plains with little warning, straight from the Canadian Arctic. As a high school senior four years earlier, he played in a blizzard, with driving snow and sleet pelting players and fans alike. But he has never played in temperatures so frigid that it hurts to breathe, so cold that hands and ﬁngers ache and barely move, so cold that it is actually dangerous to be outdoors. He has never played on turf so hard and brittle that it rips bare skin like a cheese grater whenever someone hits the ground. Backed up against his own goal line the ﬁrst time the Redskins get the ball, young Sam Baugh looks around the huddle, ten men snorting steam in the punishing cold. He glances over the helmeted heads of his teammates, sees the mob of blue-shirted Bears waiting impatiently at the line of scrimmage to tear him apart. Literally. That is their game plan—hurt him any way they can, send him to the sidelines, knock him out of the game. The Bears know he is special; so do his Redskin teammates. From the moment he rifled a bullet pass to a teammate in the team’s first scrimmage—“Which eye, Coach?”—the Redskins knew they had something. And now, four months later, their conﬁdence has been conﬁrmed.\n\nXVI\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xvi\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= PROLOGUE =\n\nAlthough he is barely out of college, he has gained his teammates’ respect during the long season, a season that has culminated in this moment, this championship game. They wait for his instructions. He glances over at Riley Smith, the Redskins’ signal caller. (Sam is actually the tailback in the Redskins’ single-wing formation.) Smith hears him out. “Let’s trick ’em,” he suggests in his Texas drawl. “I’ll drop into punt formation. But I won’t punt.” He glances at stellar running back Cliff Battles. “See that chunk of ice right over there?” he says, nodding toward a white spot on the yellowed grass. “Run straight to it, cut to the sideline and look for the ball.” The Redskins break their huddle and line up in punt formation. The Bears aren’t surprised, since punting on first down is standard strategy when a team ﬁnds itself bottled up in its own end of the ﬁeld. The Bears know that Sam is also one of the best punters in the game, possibly the best. Smith calls the signals and Sam waits for the snap, his face beneath the leather helmet red and raw. His cold hands received the ball, but instead of stepping into it with his strong right leg, he wraps his long ﬁngers around it, feeling for the laces as he rolls to the right behind the goal line and looks downﬁeld for Battles. The Redskin running back, running as fast as he can on the frozen ﬁeld, carefully sets his pivot foot and cuts in front of a Bear safety, Gene Ronzani. As Ronzani slips on the ice, the Redskin halfback gathers in the Baugh toss over his right shoulder and motors up the sideline for a forty-two-yard gain. Although the Bears hold shortly afterward, the pass from the end zone delivers a message: the Redskins’ brilliant young passer isn’t going to allow the elements to dictate strategy. Neither the weather nor the fearsome Bears can scare him.\n\nXVII\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xvii\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nSLINGIN’\n\nSAM\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xix\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nSammy happens to be just about the most valuable football player of all time, according to most pro coaches I’ve talked to. — SPORTSWRITER G RA N T L AN D RI C E, 1 9 4 2\n\nI still think he was the greatest quarterback who ever lived, college or pro. — SPORTSWRITER DAN JENKINS, 2006\n\nIn two hours, Sammy Baugh gave me the ﬁnishing touches for Augustus McCrae [in Lonesome Dove], and he didn’t even know it. — ACTO R RO BERT D U VA L L , 2 0 0 6\n\nHolley Pages2.indd xx\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nS\n\nam was his name. Sam Baugh. Not Sammy and certainly not Slingin’ Sammy. It isn’t that he spurned the inspired appellation—coined by the longtime Fort Worth Star-Telegram sportswriter Amos Melton— but “Sam Baugh,” a good, simple, common name, reﬂected how he saw himself. To his friends, to his family, to himself, he was just plain “Sam.” (That was also how he signed his autographs; “Slingin’ Sammy Baugh” took too long.) He was a man easy to like. Throughout his life—in college, as a big-time pro football player, as a West Texas rancher—people gravitated to him. Recalling Sam Baugh years later, a fellow TCU student named Ed Prichard told the sportswriter Whit Canning: “He was our idol—our hero—but we were never in awe of him, because he was also our good friend. He got along with people very well—with everybody—and on the ﬁeld he was a good leader.” Joe Tereshinksi, an end on Washington Redskin teams of the late 1940s, echoed that assessment. “He was our leader,” Tereshinski told me in 2008. “We all looked up to Sam.” “I loved Sam Baugh, not because he was a superstar, but because he was a super person,” Bob O’Day told me one hot July afternoon as we sat in his living room in Snyder, Texas. O’Day, the retired golf coach at Western Texas\n\n1\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 1\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nCollege in Snyder, was Sam’s regular golﬁng partner for nearly twenty years. Tears welled up and his voice grew husky when he recalled his old friend. O’Day told me one Sam Baugh story after another, including stories about his friend’s salty language. Sam was one of the most gloriously profane men who ever lived. He couldn’t utter a sentence—whatever the time, whatever the circumstance—without punctuating it with a cuss word or two, or three. He was never obscene, never malicious, his niece Ellen Stevenson was quick to remind me. “That’s just Sam,” Stevenson said, a phrase I heard time after time from friends and family. He was a masterly storyteller, and when he got wound up, his hands were in perpetual motion, sometimes slapping his thigh for emphasis, and he would laugh now and then at the freshness of his memories. He always had a chaw of tobacco in his cheek (Red Man, not Skoal, even though his old friend Walt Garrison once sent him a case of Skoal). Sam’s son David recalled a summer Sunday morning years ago when Sam accompanied his wife, Edmonia, and the ﬁve Baugh kids to services at the First United Methodist Church in Rotan, Texas, the town nearest the Baugh family ranch. As the service droned on toward the end, Sam’s mind began to drift to thoughts of horses and calves and the roping scheduled for after lunch. He felt a sharp poke in the ribs from Edmonia (Sam called her “Mona”). “The preacher just asked you to give the benediction,” she whispered. Sam stared down the row at the ﬁve younger Baughs, all leaning forward, all staring at him—and all wondering not only whether he was awake but also whether he could go to the Lord in prayer without uttering a cuss word. As David recalled, his dad, as usual, came through in the clutch. “That’s just Sam,” Bob O’Day said, laughing, as he recounted the same story. O’Day, a deeply religious man and a member of the Gideon Society (the people who supply Bibles to hotel rooms) was willing to give his friend a pass when it came to taking the name of the Lord in vain. “His assets certainly outweighed his liabilities,” O’Day said, his mind drifting to the happy times they spent together for nearly thirty years.\n\nI\n\nsaw Sam Baugh twice, the ﬁrst time when I was a kid. On a Saturday morning in the mid-1950s, Dad woke my two younger brothers and me earlier than usual. Mom ﬁxed us breakfast, and we drove to Holt’s Sporting Goods across Fifth Street from the courthouse in downtown Waco. Holt’s was where we bought our baseball gloves and bats every spring, our football equipment in the fall. All three of us were too young to play on school teams,\n\n2\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 2\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= INTRODUCTION =\n\nbut like most Texas youngsters, we played in the backyard every afternoon and during recess at school, so we had to have equipment. We enjoyed our trips to Holt’s, enjoyed pawing over the brightly colored jerseys hanging on racks, enjoyed breathing in the new-leather smell of baseball gloves, footballs, basketballs. On this morning, though, we weren’t going to Holt’s to buy. We were going to pay homage, although Kenny and Steve and I didn’t know that was what we were doing. In the football section, toward the back of the store, surrounded by brand-new jerseys, helmets, and shoulder pads, we were ushered into the presence of a tall dark-haired man in a tan sport coat and slacks who, as I remember, was standing around talking football with some of the Holt’s salesmen. “Boys, meet Slingin’ Sammy Baugh,” Dad said, giving us a gentle shove forward. What Sammy Baugh was doing in Waco on that Saturday morning, I don’t know, although I suspect his Hardin-Simmons University Cowboys— he was head coach—were playing the Baylor Bears at Baylor Stadium that night, and he had dropped by Holt’s for a personal appearance. Maybe Dad had read about his being there in the Waco Times-Herald. His lean face crinkling into a smile, the tall man leaned down and shook our hands and signed an autograph for us. Unlike the treasured Mickey Mantle autograph we got in Dallas a few years later, we promptly lost Sammy Baugh’s. Although we were big sports fans, we had no idea who he was. We didn’t know that he had been the quarterback of the Washington Redskins for sixteen seasons, that he was arguably the greatest passer ever to play the game. Soon, though, as I got a little older and started going to high school football games, I began hearing the name. I began to understand who Sammy Baugh was and what he stood for. What Babe Ruth’s home runs did for Major League Baseball in the 1920s, Sam Baugh’s passing did for the National Football League a decade or so later. “Ruth was more Bunyanesque,” the sportswriter Tom Boswell once wrote, “more outside the parameters of previous imagination. But Baugh wasn’t too far behind.” Like Ruth, he remained, for decades, the epitome of excellence for his particular sport. It is 1955, say, and a kid on the playground rears back and heaves a long pass downﬁeld. Regardless of whether he completes it, his teammates chide his audacity. “Hey, who do you think you are, Sammy Baugh?” they’ll say. Sportswriters every fall assess the latest crop of Texas schoolboy\n\n3\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 3\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\npassers, and the standard they used for decades was Sammy Baugh— Slingin’ Sammy Baugh. For years, he remained an icon, to be gradually superseded in the fans’ imaginations only when a young Johnny Unitas led the Baltimore Colts to victory over the New York Giants in the 1958 championship game in what would come to be called “the greatest game ever played.” Or maybe when, nearly a decade later, a brash young quarterback named “Broadway” Joe Namath led his New York Jets to an improbable Super Bowl victory over the Colts. The name and the memories began to fade, of course, as the years went by, as the game evolved, as new faces captured public attention, and as television magniﬁed their fame in ways Sammy himself could never have imagined when he was playing. But Sammy’s accomplishments on the football ﬁeld didn’t fade. They remain as astounding today as they were three-quarters of a century ago when he was a tall, gangly quarterback with a whiplike arm and a limber right leg that could kick a ball a mile. In his sixteen seasons in the NFL—a long career by pro football standards—Sammy led the Washington Redskins to ﬁve title games and two NFL championships. He led the league in passing six times, in punting four times, and in interceptions once. (From his defensive safety position, he was the intercepter, not the interceptee.) His career punting average was more than 45 yards, but from 1940 through 1942, it was close to 50 yards (49.5). Before Sam, only one man had passed for 1,000 yards in a season. In 1947, Sam completed 210 passes for 2,938 yards—both marks that simply obliterated old records. Like Ruth, who changed the very perception of the game of baseball and how it was played, Sam transformed the notion of offense and how much yardage could be gained through the air. In a game against the Detroit Lions in 1943, he threw four touchdown passes—and caught four interceptions. (That was the year he led the league in interceptions, with eleven.) During several seasons early in his career, he played every minute of every game. “He really had a riﬂe for an arm,” the sportswriter Dan Jenkins told me in 2006. “He could throw sidearm and underhanded along with it. He was tough and wiry, probably the greatest punter who ever lived as well. Plus, he liked to jaw around and kid with the zebras [referees], even in college, and certainly he was a leader.” Before Sam, professional football was at the periphery of American sports. With a limited fan base drawn exclusively from the Northeast and upper Midwest, and with few economically viable franchises, the pros were overshadowed by the Saturday-afternoon heroics of college teams. Football fans wanted to read about Harvard-Yale, Army-Navy, Notre Dame—or,\n\n4\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 4\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= INTRODUCTION =\n\nin the Southwest, SMU-TCU—not the Boston Redskins or the Portsmouth Spartans. The former collegians who continued to play the game at the professional level didn’t make enough money to make football their fulltime job. Sam was the bridge between the leather-helmet era and the modern. Not only was he professional football’s most popular player, but he also was a superb athlete who revolutionized how the game was played. Before Sam Baugh, football closely resembled rugby, with tightly packed linemen trying to open holes for ball carriers running primarily between tackles on a tighter ﬁeld without hash marks. Conﬁdent enough to throw the ball from any spot on the ﬁeld, on any down, Sam wrenched football free from its sclerotic past and made it a hell of a lot more fun to watch. By the thousands, football fans in the nation’s capital, in New York, in Chicago, wherever the pros played the game, saw what the tall slender Texan could do with a football—on offense and on defense, with his arm and his leg—and they decided they liked what they saw. They liked the way the rawboned young athlete from the wide-open spaces of West Texas opened up the playing ﬁeld and made the forward pass a strategic weapon, not a desperation heave. They liked his gambler’s instincts. They thrilled in delicious anticipation of multiple possibilities when the ball was in his hands. The TCU all-American, a product of Sweetwater, Texas, changed the game almost instantaneously, beginning with his rookie season in 1937, when the twenty-two-year-old Texan took the Redskins to the NFL title, beating the Chicago Bears, the Monsters of the Midway, on their home ﬁeld. If football fans around the country weren’t aware of Slingin’ Sammy Baugh before, they were that day. On the ﬁrst play of the game, he dared to throw from his own end zone to all-pro halfback Cliff Battles for forty-two yards. Down 21–14 in the fourth quarter, he looked one way and threw the other to his end, Wayne Millner, for seventy-seven yards and a score, then got the winning touchdown on a thirty-ﬁve-yarder to Ed Justice. Earlier in the half, he threw a ﬁfty-ﬁve-yard touchdown to Millner. All this on his one healthy leg; the other had been almost broken in two by ruthless, rampaging Bears. In 1937, when Sam Baugh entered the league as a rookie, a 47.4 percent completion percentage was good for tops in the league. He was that 47.4 percent passer, incidentally. And indeed, for nine of his sixteen seasons, he was the most accurate passer in the NFL; in two other seasons he was second. In 1945, he completed more than 70 percent of his passes, then a ﬁrst for the NFL. His feat went unmatched for some thirty-seven years until Ken Anderson of the Cincinnati Bengals ﬁnally broke Sam’s record in 1982.\n\n5\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 5\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nHe also led the league in punting for four straight years, and in another championship game against the Bears, he got off a punt that traveled eightyﬁve yards. In 1940, he averaged an NFL record 51.4 yards on his punts and was the master of the third-down quick kick, a tactical tool no longer used. Sam still holds or is tied for six Redskin records: most touchdown passes in a career, 187; best punting average in a career, 45.1 yards; most passing yards in a game, 446; most touchdown passes in a game, 6; best punting average in a season, 51.4 yards; and most passes intercepted in a game, 4. In a game against the New York Giants in 1943, he threw two touchdown passes, ran seventy-one yards with an intercepted pass, batted down two Giants passes in the end zone, and made seven tackles. A pretty good afternoon’s work. Almost from the day he entered the National Football League, the big number 33 on Sam’s back was the biggest gate attraction in professional football. He made quarterback the glamour position, which means that Unitas, Namath, Brett Favre, Donovan McNabb, the Manning brothers, and all the other football ﬁeld generals since Sam are in his debt (as are the fans, of course). During the 1940s, he was on a par in the public mind with Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio, Bill Tilden, and Joe Louis. The longtime political columnist David Broder, my esteemed colleague at the Washington Post, recalled a midwestern senator of another era who, some time in his third term, was heard to ask a colleague, “Who is this man Sammy Baugh that people keep talking about?” The story got around town and eventually back to the unnamed senator’s home state, and in Broder’s words, “the fellow was deservedly defeated the next time he was up for reelection.” Through it all, Sam Baugh kept a steady head on his shoulders, kept his accomplishments in perspective. Beyond the gridiron exploits as a Hall of Fame quarterback, all-pro safety, and record-setting punter, beyond the glamour that came with being the biggest name in the game, he fashioned another life, one he found even more satisfying than his football career. Like a movie cowboy riding off into the sunset, he decided to chuck it all in the early 1960s. Retiring as a player and coach, he left behind the gridiron glory, a possible movie career, and the money. He never looked back. Nearly thirty years after the Redskin impresario George Preston Marshall sold Washington fans on the notion that the tall, lean Texan was a rootin’-tootin’ cowboy—never mind that he had grown up in town, gone to college in Fort Worth, and was more preppy than pastoral—he became a genuine Texas cowboy. For nearly ﬁfty years, until his body wore out, he lived in far West Texas on his Double Mountain Ranch near Rotan. On a ﬂat\n\n6\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 6\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= INTRODUCTION =\n\nsea of scrub brush beneath two great rock peaks, where the only hardy vegetation is mesquite trees and prickly pear, he raised his cattle and horses, made himself a champion roper, and reveled in the wide-open spaces. That was where I found him, a half century or so after that long-ago Saturday morning when he signed an autograph for my brothers and me in Waco. As a staff writer for the Post, I was writing “Redskins Journal,” a weekly column during football season that took me to varied Washingtonarea venues during Redskin games—a bar, a restaurant, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a ﬁrehouse. I watched the game with fans and wrote their particular stories. One cold Sunday morning, I was wandering around the vast parking lot of FedEx Field, the Redskins’ home stadium, where two hours before game time, thousands of fans were tailgating, sitting in lawn chairs or on pickup tailgates, barbecuing ribs or charcoaling burgers and maybe tossing back a brew or two, or three. Youngsters were ﬂinging footballs back and forth between lines of parked cars until it was time to troop into the stadium and cheer for the burgundy and gold. Notebook and pen at the ready, my “Redskins Journal” question for the day was what Washington player of yore would fans love to see still with the team. Many of the answers were predictable—Hall of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen was still immensely popular, as were Hall of Fame wide receiver Charley Taylor and defensive back Darrell Green. I was astounded, though, at how often a fan would answer with the name of a player who hadn’t taken the ﬁeld in more than half a century—Slingin’ Sammy Baugh. The older ones, invariably, had a story to tell about being in the stands when he intercepted four passes or got off a mind-boggling punt. One tailgater, seventy-seven-year-old Ray Augsterfer, wore a throwback leather helmet in homage to his favorite player. Augsterfer, who lived in nearby Annapolis, had been a thirteen-year-old in the stands for Baugh’s very ﬁrst Redskin game in 1937, and he was there in ’41 for his record-setting eightyﬁve-yard punt. “He was so much fun to watch,” Jeanne McNeill told me that day. The smartly dressed woman sitting on a lawn chair and nursing a gin and tonic with friends was eighty-six, a retired U.S. Postal Service executive. She had been a regular at Redskin home games since 1947, when the team played in Griffith Stadium, the old Washington Senators baseball park. “He could do everything—run, pass, kick,” McNeill told me. “And he was a good guy too.” McNeill and Augsterfer and the other fans who recalled Sam that morning would have seconded the view of the legendary Washington Post sportswriter Shirley Povich, who wrote in 1994 in response to an official\n\n7\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 7\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nannouncement from the NFL that Sammy Baugh was one of four quarterbacks being acclaimed as the league’s all-time, all-stars at that position: “No disrespect here to Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana and Otto Graham, who were bracketed with him in gross oversight of Baugh’s patently superior credentials. They too were great quarterbacks, deserving of loud cheers. They evoked memories of Samuel Baugh, but not the reality of him. Simply put, they lacked his measure in so many skills.”\n\nB\n\nut what had become of him? Was he still alive? None of the fans I talked to knew, and neither did any of the Post sportswriters. I persuaded my editors that we ought to ﬁnd out, so one weekend in January, I ﬂew back to Texas from my home in Washington, rented a car in Austin, and, with my brother Ken along for the ride, made the 300-mile drive to Sam’s Double Mountain Ranch. We ﬁlled up with gas in Abilene and then headed toward Rotan, eighty miles northwest. Not far from the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River, ﬂat pastureland began to rumple up. The rocky, hard-packed ground was filigreed by canyons, ravines, and dry washes. Stubbled grass and mottes of dry mesquite were almost the only vegetation. Sam’s West Texas wasn’t much to look at—at first glance, anyway— but like the coyotes, deer, jackrabbits, and wild turkeys that populate the vast area, the old football star took to it. For more than six decades, it had been home. The daily routines of the ranch, hard work outdoors, peace and quiet, even the extremes of West Texas weather—he found all of it deeply satisfying. The ranch was still there, but Sam wasn’t. His son David told us he had been moved to Jayton, thirty miles away. In a nursing home in the dusty little ranching town, where there seemed to be as many tumbleweeds as people, Kenny and I wandered into a simple room decorated with a child’s drawing of a football player in the burgundy and gold uniform of the Washington Redskins. Lying on his back, half-asleep on a single bed, was a gaunt gray-haired man who had been a resident for the past ﬁve years, since Alzheimer’s disease had begun to erase the memories of nearly a century. Sam Baugh had no idea who we were, of course, but this time Kenny and I were certainly aware of who he was. And people still remembered. He still got requests for autographs, still got cards and letters, including one from a Nebraska businessman, who dropped Sam a line not long after Kenny and I visited.\n\n8\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 8\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= INTRODUCTION =\n\n“Dear Sammy,” he wrote. When Dudley DeGroot was coaching the Redskins more than 60 years ago, I was sort of an assistant water boy for two Redskins games. This came about because my older sister was dating Dudley, Jr. and I made such a pest of myself that they decided to buy me off by letting me sit on the Redskins’ bench. Then my sister broke up with Dudley and my career ended. But I still remember the thrills of watching you play, not just for the passing but also for the punting and defensive interceptions.\n\nCalling himself “a huge fan in Omaha” and wishing Sam the best, the letter writer signed his name: “Warren E. Buffett.”\n\n9\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 9\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nSAM BAUGH thebeginning\n\nO\n\nn a hot summer afternoon in 1933, on a hard-packed baseball ﬁeld in West Texas, Dutch Meyer was watching his Texas Christian University Horned Frogs play a couple of practice games against a semipro town team in Abilene. Every summer the TCU coach would pick twelve Horned Frog players and barnstorm for part of the summer, driving around the Southwest in two cars the TCU team used for road trips, a Cadillac and a jump-seat Chevrolet. On this particular day, the team they were playing was the Mose Sims Oilers. The Abilene team was made up mostly of guys in their twenties and thirties who had knocked around baseball for some years at various levels. Meyer, who also was an assistant football coach at TCU, couldn’t take his eyes off a younger player, a tall, gangly high school kid playing third base for the Oilers. “He had two great days against us,” Meyer recalled years later. “He was quick as a cat, and the way he could throw that baseball—whew! And he could hit. I wanted him bad, but the trouble was I didn’t have any baseball scholarships to offer him.” The kid’s name was Baugh—Sam Baugh—and he had graduated from high school a few weeks earlier in Sweetwater, a town ﬁfty miles northwest\n\n10\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 10\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nof Abilene. Meyer, the future Frog legend, may have wanted him for TCU, but the youngster wasn’t even sure he was going to college. The Depression had hit West Texas hard, and jobs were hard to come by. Baugh’s dad, who worked for the railroad in Sweetwater, thought he might be able to get his son a railroad job too if he was lucky. The Baugh family was relatively new to Sweetwater—they had moved from the Central Texas town of Temple only three years earlier—but Baughs had been in Texas for three generations. Like many Texans, they were descended from southerners who had migrated to the Lone Star State. The Baugh family originally settled in South Carolina in the 1760s. Sam’s great-great-great-great-grandfather, John Baugh, with his wife Darcus Mitchell Baugh and nine children, moved to Georgia in the 1790s, where the couple farmed and were stalwart members of the Grove Level Baptist Church in Grove County, Georgia. Church records indicate that in 1822, two years after John Baugh’s death, his wife was excluded from the congregation “for cursing, swearing and striking Mr. Savelle.” Records don’t say what caused the disagreement, but she was restored to fellowship ﬁve years later. (Perhaps Sam’s penchant for cussing was genetic.) William Baugh, the firstborn of John Baugh and Darcus Mitchell, fathered ﬁfteen children and was married twice. A veteran of the War of 1812, he lived his whole life in Georgia and was known as an upright man and a successful, hardworking farmer, despite a war wound that left him with a disabled right hand. A proﬁle of William Baugh, found in “The History of Gwinnett County, Georgia,” described him as “stern, solid and courageous even to his oddities. He was cool, not at all excitable, but calm and determined in all his purposes, and would resent an insult coming from whatever source it might.” William Baugh’s anonymous proﬁler recalled that Baugh had a brother who was a bully “and had whipped every man with whom he had fought.” Baugh and his brother had some kind of disagreement, and the brother told him that if it were not a disgrace for brothers to ﬁght he would give him a whipping. Mr. Baugh replied: “You have got your name by whipping drunk men and boys. Pull off your coat and try a man.” It was no sooner said than done. At it they went and the bully got a terrible licking. This occurred before he came to Gwinnett County, but after he had joined the church.\n\nThe author of the county history recalled that William Baugh\n\n11\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 11\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nwas a deadly enemy to whiskies and to masculine long hair. He used to say: “I am always uneasy about my gimlets, augers, pocket knife and hen roost when the whiskered gentry come about my house.”\n\nA minister named Allen Turner, a friend of William Baugh’s, was passing through the county on his way to a gospel meeting and was accompanied by Mr. Richard Whittick, “a gentleman of culture, of ﬁne sense, good morals, a churchman and gentleman.” Unfortunately for the fellow, he wore a long beard. According to the anonymous archivist: Upon their arrival and after an introduction to the strange brother and cordial greetings of old friends, Mr. Baugh brought out his razor with a basin of water and a towel and invited Brother Whittick to shave. He declined saying: “I do not wish to shave.” Mr. Baugh insisted and still Mr. Whittick declined.\n\nFinally, William Baugh told the visitor he was not welcome to stay the night unless he shaved. As a result: “Mr. Whittick, a little huffy, left and went over to the home of Mr. Flowers, who did not object to his beard, and there he spent the night.” More than a century and a half later, long after he had quit coaching, William’s Baugh’s descendant Sam Baugh told an oral historian that longhaired football players didn’t bother him a bit; he didn’t believe the length of their hair had a whole lot to do with how tough they were or how well they could play the game. “I wouldn’t put in a rule I couldn’t live with,” he said. “I don’t believe in making trouble for yourself.” Several of William Baugh’s children moved to Texas. When annexed by the United States in 1845, Texas retained control of its public lands. The state used its bountiful natural resource to pay off debts, reward war veterans, ﬁnance public education, and build its grand capitol in Austin. It also used land grants to entice settlers, including the Baughs of Georgia, who were dividing up 300-acre farms among family members while Texas was giving away the same amount of land per head of household. William Lovic Baugh, the ﬁrstborn son of William Baugh and his second wife, Elizabeth Lindsay, settled in Rusk County, in Deep East Texas, with his wife, Lucille Harris Purcell Baugh, in the 1840s. In 1854, they moved into Coryell County, in Central Texas, not far from the future town of Temple, in Bell County. Establishing himself as a farmer and rancher, William Baugh—who favored a long beard—built a large rock house in the Leon River valley. A local historian described the house as a mansion with eight large rooms,\n\n12\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 12\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\neach with its own ﬁreplace, and thirty-two large windows. Because Indian raids on area homesteads were still a danger, William Baugh built his house with an escape tunnel in a downstairs room. It started in the side of the ﬁreplace and ran 150 yards underground to the west, where it exited in a brushy area. Rocked on all sides, the tunnel was three feet wide and three feet high. William Lovic Baugh died in 1914 at age ninety-three. Most of his children and their families settled in Central Texas, including John Pascal Baugh, the fourth child born to William Lovic and Lucille Harris Baugh. John Pascal Baugh married Geneva A. Medlin in 1874, and the couple had fourteen children, ﬁve girls and nine boys.\n\nT\n\nhe couple’s ninth was James Valentine Baugh, known as Jim, born on March 25, 1889. At age twenty-one, he married Katherine Lucinda Ray, known as Lucy, in 1910, and the couple’s ﬁrst child, Bobby Blake Baugh, was born in 1912. Their second son, Sam Adrian Baugh, was born two years later, on March 14, 1914, in a farmhouse outside Temple. A daughter, Nell Merwyn Baugh, was born in 1916. A family genealogist noted that Jim Baugh’s World War I draft card listed him as a farmer working in Falls County, near Temple, between the villages of Rogers and Heidenheimer. “We lived out there on that farm when I was little—six miles out of town—and I really loved that life,” Sam Baugh told a reporter years later. “We had a few dairy cows, and living out there in the country—just doin’ the chores and not worrying much about anything else, seemed like the perfect way to go through life.” Growing up, young Sam may not have been worried about much, but farm life in the years before the Depression was hard and unpredictable. When he was about ﬁve, his father got on with the Santa Fe Railroad in nearby Temple. And in fact there was a bit more to it than that, whether young Sam realized it at the time. Jim Baugh was a gambling man, and the family farm was actually a front for a gaming house—complete with a pool table and card tables, and with cockﬁghts and greyhound races out back. “Everything you could gamble on . . . they had,” Sam recalled in later years. “My daddy played poker all the time, too. When he got older, he couldn’t see, and I’m sure they cheated the living hell out of him.” The 1930 census shows the family living in Temple at 108 North 23rd Street; the house was valued at $2,700, and the family did not own a radio, the census noted. Seventeen-year-old Bob, sixteen-year-old Sam, and\n\n13\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 13\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nthirteen-year-old Nell attended school. Jim Baugh is listed as a weigh master at Temple’s rail yards. Temple, sixty-seven miles north of Austin, owed its origins to the railroads. It started out in the 1880s as a construction camp for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. The railway company called it Temple Junction, while locals called it Mud Town or Tanglefoot. It remained a railroad interchange, and after three major hospitals were built in the early years of the twentieth century, it became one of the largest medical centers in the Southwest. By the time young Sam was a student at Temple High School in the late 1920s, the town had a population of about 15,000. Nell Baugh Kendrick, the youngest child, remembered growing up in Temple. Both her brothers were good to her, she recalled nearly a century later. “If he had a dollar,” she said, speaking of Sam, “he’d give me half of it, and dollars weren’t easy to come by in those days.” She remembered him being a paperboy for the Temple Daily Telegram. Sam, known as “Buddy” growing up, remembered trying to pick cotton on the Blackland Prairie around Temple when the Baughs lived in the country. “It would take me all day to pick a sack of cotton when I was little,” he recalled years later. But I remember dragging that dang sack full and how it hurt my shoulders. Later on, when I was playing football and practicing football, it was hot and we were tired, and you’d think, “Dang, this is tough.” And then you’d think about dragging that sack and then you’d jump up and you’re ready to go again. So I always promised myself that if I ever had an acre of land I’d never plant a stalk of cotton.\n\nSam’s grandparents still lived out in the country, so he had at least a passing familiarity with farm life—and the drudgery of dragging a heavy sack down endless cotton rows—but basically he was a town boy. Life on a ranch would come much later. One other thing happened in the country, something that would stay with Sam the rest of his life, although he rarely talked about it. He was maybe twelve, and a buddy of his had gotten a .410 shotgun for Christmas. Sam, the kid with the shotgun, and one other boy were ambling through a pasture looking for rabbits on Christmas Day when they came to a barbedwire fence. As they were climbing through the fence, the gun went off, killing the youngster who had gotten it for Christmas. Years later, Sam would take his boys out hunting for jackrabbits, but he would never handle a gun himself.\n\n14\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 14\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nOnce the Baughs moved into town, Buddy always had a ball of some kind in his hand. The family lived behind Temple’s Westside Baptist Church, and the youngster got in the habit of tossing a baseball over the tall roof and running around to catch it on the other side. And for hours at a time he tossed a baseball at the church building’s concrete steps. The steps formed a semicircle, so young Sam had to be ready for the ball to carom off at odd angles. “I just played just by myself,” he recalled. “My daddy used to play catch with me.” He once recalled that it was when he was in the third grade, maybe eight years old, that he ﬁrst started tossing a football around, an imitation-leather ball somebody had bought for him at a drugstore. He ﬁrst played football in elementary school, during recess, where his ﬁrst coach, of sorts, was his third-grade teacher. She was “really, really interested in football,” he recalled. “I’ve often tried to think of that woman’s name, but I can’t remember it. But she was the ﬁrst football coach I had.” Like most Texas boys growing up in the 1920s and ’30s, he played whatever sport was in season—football in the fall, basketball in winter, baseball in the spring. He ﬁrst played organized sports in junior high school, when he came out for football. Because he was tall, his coach made him an end. The team won most of its games. “The coach, after the season was over, was talking to three of us boys,” Sam recalled years later, “and he said, ‘You know,’ he said, ‘we had a pretty good year.’ He said, ‘If you three boys were back next year, we’d probably be the best junior high team in Texas.’” The coach, wittingly or not, had planted the germ of an idea, and Sam and his two buddies liked how it sounded. They purposely failed eighth grade. Years later, Sam remembered how disappointed his mother was when he had to tell her that he had ﬂunked English, but he didn’t regret his decision. “We stayed there that extra year in junior high, which really helped me, because I wasn’t very big anyway,” he recalled. Sam’s junior high football coach turned out to be prescient. With his three ringers leading the way, the team beat every other junior high in Temple as well as every other team they played in Central Texas. They ﬁnished the season undefeated, as did a team from Cisco, an oil-boom town 200 miles to the west. The Cisco coach called his Temple counterpart to see whether he would be interested in a championship game of sorts to determine the unofficial state junior high champion. The Temple coach agreed. Sam and his teammates traveled the 200 miles to Cisco by bus, stayed with host families, and played the junior high version of the Cisco Big Dam Lobos (named for a large hollow dam across Sandy Creek, creating Lake\n\n15\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 15\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nCisco). The Big Dam Lobos won the game, but Sam enjoyed the experience. Over the years, he would run into Cisco boys he had played against, who were proud to remind the football star that they had once played against him. “A lot of times,” he recalled, “they’d come see a game and look me up and tell me about when we played that game in Cisco.”\n\nS\n\nam’s winning ways ended abruptly when he arrived—a year late—at Temple High School. Although the Temple Wildcats basketball team was one of the best in the state—winning state championships in 1928 and 1932—the football team was, in Sam’s words, “the sorriest team Temple ever had, I guarantee you.” The team had only two seniors. “And I was playing end, and we played Waco the ﬁrst ballgame,” Sam recalled. “Waco beat us 60 to nothing. Just ran over us, you know. Then we played Corsicana, and they beat us 55 to 0.” When the dismal season was about half over, Sam, weighing all of 155 pounds, was still playing end, but one day during practice, his coaches noticed in a passing drill that their string-bean end was throwing the ball back to the passers better than the passers themselves. They noticed that he had a natural, easy way of throwing, perfected through years of practicing at home. He had found an old tire, tied a rope around it, and hung it from a tree limb. He would get the rope to swinging and practice throwing a football through the tire at twenty paces and beyond. He had a strong arm, big hands for a kid, and—thanks to the tire—an understanding of how to lead a receiver. He was accurate. He could also be obsessive about striving for perfection. His son David would recall years later that it didn’t matter whether it was passing, calf roping, or dominoes, Sam Baugh would work at it incessantly until he was the best he could be. Coach Henderson had an idea in the middle of the Wildcats’ woeful season. “He called me in his office,” Sam recalled, “and told me, he said, ‘What would you think if I moved you from end to the backﬁeld?’ I said, ‘Well, I’ve already played end. If you want me to move, I’ll move.’ He said, ‘Well, I’ve been watching you since practice started,’ and he said, ‘You kick the ball better than anybody we’ve got. You throw the ball better than anybody we’ve got, so we haven’t got another player in the backﬁeld who can throw the ball.’ He said, ‘Maybe you could throw it a little bit and it might help us a little.’ I said to him, ‘If you want me to, I’ll do it.’ So I spent half a year in the backﬁeld at Temple.” In a Hollywood version of the Sammy Baugh story—which Sam’s life\n\n16\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 16\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nlater resembled—the skinny young quarterback in Temple blue and white ambles onto the ﬁeld the next Friday afternoon and starts ﬂinging touchdown missiles before a surprised and delighted crowd. The Wildcats season is rescued. A star is born. For sophomore Sam, however, it didn’t happen that way. “Didn’t make a damn bit of difference that I could tell,” he recalled. “We just kept on losin’.” “I don’t recall what happened on the ﬁrst pass he ever threw in a game, but he didn’t do too well, I know, because we got beat,” Henderson himself recalled three decades later. “I think [Austin High School] intercepted two or three of his passes.” Henderson lost more than games. He lost his job. He would eventually become the head basketball coach at Baylor University, thirty miles up the road in Waco. He took the Bears to the NCAA ﬁnals in 1948 and retired in 1961 with more wins than any coach in school history. “Bill was a hell of a basketball coach when he was coaching at Baylor, but he wasn’t much of a football coach,” Sam recalled. “I would always tell him, ‘See how lucky you are we had a damn bad team at Temple, which got you ﬁred, and here you are coaching at Baylor.’ He was a ﬁne man.” Young Sam Baugh left Temple as well. With the Depression causing calamity throughout the country, and with the struggling Santa Fe Railroad laying off men, Jim Baugh suddenly found himself out of work. Union rules allowed anyone who lost his job to claim the job of the next person below him in seniority. The elder Baugh got caught in a railroad version of musical chairs, which meant he would have to leave Temple to ﬁnd work. “My daddy got bumped by someone with more seniority and lost his job in Temple, so he bumped somebody in Somerville and the family moved over there,” he recalled. (The children stayed with their grandparents.) “Then he bumped somebody else in Sweetwater, and we moved out there. Nobody had any money, and if you just had a job you were ahead of a lot of people. So you went wherever the jobs were.” Rumors arose over the years, particularly after Sam Baugh became Slingin’ Sam of nationwide renown, that football boosters in Sweetwater somehow had lured the elder Baugh because they wanted his son throwing the football for Sweetwater’s Newman High School Mustangs. Although recruiting high school football players (or their parents) was forbidden by the state’s newly established University Interscholastic League rules, it certainly went on, particularly in football-mad West Texas. No one has ever offered proof, though, that Sam was recruited, and since he was merely a promising athlete on a lousy team, not a star, when he left Temple, it is unlikely that it happened.\n\n17\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 17\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nThe Temple Wildcats had a sense of what they were losing. As Sam recalled years later, he was elected captain of the football team, the baseball team, and the basketball team. “I could understand the baseball, being elected the captain of the baseball team, but basketball—I knew damn well something was wrong, because we had four or ﬁve boys there better than I was at the time, and they ranked me captain of the damn team. And I wasn’t smart enough to ﬁgure out they were trying to get me to where I’d stay at Temple with my grandmother and graduate from Temple. I never thought of that until later on.” Before Sam Baugh, Sweetwater’s most famous resident—or infamous resident, depending on your point of view—was a young English scholar named Dorothy Scarborough, who wrote a novel called The Wind (1925). Set in the Sweetwater area in the late 1880s, the book depicts “a straggling collection of small houses of the rudest, simplest structure, some not even painted, some without fences . . . little bare box-like houses, naked and unbeautiful!—set down in a waste of sand.” Scarborough’s main character, a young woman from genteel Virginia, is so unnerved by the isolation, numbing emptiness, and incessant wind that she takes her own life. The real Sweetwater got its start in 1877 when a trader named Bill Knight, following the buffalo hunters and government surveyors, opened a store in a dugout on the banks of Sweetwater Creek. The ﬁrst house constructed of lumber was used for a saloon, and later two saloonkeepers acted as bankers for area stockmen. A century later, Sweetwater would play on its frontier image by staging an annual Rattlesnake Roundup, but the Sweetwater the Baugh family discovered was a tidy town of about 10,000 people, with paved streets, multistory downtown buildings, and an economy that was thriving until the Depression set in. The West Texas wind still blew and sandstorms blanketed the town almost every spring, but residents had planted trees to act as windbreaks. It was still a market town for area sheep and cattle ranches, as well as cotton and grain farmers. In addition to the railroad shops where the elder Baugh worked, the local economy relied on the development of gypsum deposits in the area. Sam attended high school in a distinguished-looking two-story redbrick building with white columns. It was known as Newman High School in Sam’s day. Sweetwater, like every West Texas town, was fanatical about high school football. The Mustangs were the talk of the barbershop during the week and the topic of conversation after church on Sundays (once members got past the preacher at the door and had complimented him on his sermon).\n\n18\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 18\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nA Mustang who scored the winning touchdown was a hero for a week; a kid who dropped a potentially game-winning pass knew folks would remember for years. On Friday afternoons, the town shut down to follow the Mustangs to away games in Big Spring, Roscoe, Colorado City—in auto caravans following the school bus if the game was relatively close by, on special trains when the team made the playoffs and traveled to Amarillo. In Sweetwater, football gave Sam an opportunity to escape a home life that was becoming increasingly difficult. His father had added bootlegging to his repertoire. He was still promoting gambling and chicken ﬁghting. Sam recalled the time his father took his wife’s yard rooster and attached gaffs to him and used the bird to train one of his ﬁghting cocks. As the story goes, the yard rooster inﬂicted a broken wing on the trained killer. The elder Baugh eventually left the family and took up with a red-haired ﬂoozy named Ruby. Sam’s mother, Lucy, was left with the three kids, no visible means of support during hard times, and a ﬂood of resentment that the children shared. She took in sewing, and the children had part-time jobs to make ends meet. “I grew up knowing I wouldn’t bet on the sun coming up,” Sam once said. “You read a lot now about kids not having a shot because of their family life and things. You learn from your family, good or bad. I got enough bad to know I never wanted to live that way.” Years later, Sam’s niece, then Ellen Kendrick, was sitting in the car with her mother on a downtown street in Sweetwater, where the family lived. Her mother gestured toward a man and woman walking along the sidewalk. The woman had ﬂaming-red hair. “Do you know who that is?” Nell Kendrick asked her daughter. Ellen said she didn’t. “That’s your grandfather,” Nell said. “And I want nothing to do with him.” Years after the three children were grown and living on their own, Jim Baugh tried to reconcile with them. David Baugh, Sam’s son, remembered a man and woman coming out to the Baugh ranch and sitting on the front porch. He was a ﬂashy dresser, Sam recalled, and the red-haired woman was pretty. “He was just as friendly to us boys as he could be,” David Baugh recalled, “but Mom [Sam’s mother] wouldn’t come out of the house.” Sam was willing to reconcile, but not Nell. He couldn’t persuade his sister that they ought to let their father back into their lives. Jim Baugh died in 1968.\n\nD\n\nespite his unsettled home life, Sam had a good two years in Sweetwater. He helped his mother, who cooked and sewed for people in town and sold butter and eggs. It wasn’t easy being a single mother.\n\n19\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 19\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nSam was a good student and popular at school. He also had two good years on the football ﬁeld with the Mustangs, but nothing spectacular. Wearing number 21 for the red-and-white-clad Ponies, he played safety on defense— as he would throughout his long career—and blocking back or halfback on offense. (The school retired his number in 2006.) In the single- and double-wing formations that most teams used in those days, the tailback and fullback carried the ball on most plays and did most of the passing. The halfback was primarily a blocker, although now and then he got to carry the ball. “There’s been some stuff written from time to time about how when I was in high school I led the Sweetwater Mustangs to the state playoffs,” he recalled. “But it just ain’t true. Hell, I was a long way from being the guy who led us to the playoffs.” The real star of the team was a running back named Ney “Red” Sheridan. “”He was a good quarterback, a good baseball player; he was just a good athlete,” Sam recalled. “He was a running back, could run like a deer. Weighed about 230 pounds.” At the end of the season, the Sweetwater newspaper called Sheridan “the ﬁnest running back and the smartest quarterback in the Texas interscholastic league.” The paper also lauded Jack Dodson, “stellar Pony wingman,” who “stopped everything coming his way through the season just past.” There was no mention of Sam. Behind the running of Sheridan, the Mustangs were one of three undefeated teams in the state in Sam’s senior year, 1932. (Amarillo High and the Masonic Home of Fort Worth were the other two.) As district champs, they qualiﬁed for the state playoffs. “Our big game that year was against Big Spring, which was averaging about 40 points a game and was probably the best high school team I ever saw,” Baugh recalled. “They were real big and real fast, and nobody thought we could beat ’em, and I have to admit, it looked pretty darn near impossible. But Red [Sheridan] had a great game, and we won the district championship.” That set up a big bi-district game the next week against the Amarillo Golden Sandstorm, and all of Sweetwater was excited. A committee of local businessmen launched a campaign to sign up at least 400 fans to charter a special train to the Panhandle city. Twenty-ﬁve businessmen posted from $25 to $100, the high school band $90, and the athletic association $390 to pay the team’s way, along with the 130 girls in the pep squad. Fans paid $3 for a round-trip ticket. “Twenty-four husky Sweetwater lads mushed off for the northland Thursday and in the frozen Panhandle country Saturday they will prospect\n\n20\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 20\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nfor that rich vein of pay dirt which may yield for them the nugget of a state quarter-ﬁnal victory,” reported a poetically inclined Sweetwater Reporter sportswriter. He noted that Sweetwater had never played in Amarillo and had never advanced so far in Texas high school football competition. He also noted that the Mustangs had been battling another foe all week. “The squad, after a hard game against the Flu Midgets—who play dirty football considering their size—had almost whipped down the germs’ attack and were in some semblance of regular form as they pulled out at noon for the Panhandle city.” Playing in a blizzard that Saturday and perhaps still weakened by the ﬂu, the Mustangs lost to the bigger, stronger Amarillo team 7–0. Coach Ed Hennig, speaking to the Sweetwater Club at noon the next Thursday, declared that he was proud of his team. “The way those boys fought in the last few minutes of that Amarillo game, the way they stayed in there and battled when they were almost hopelessly whipped, numb and freezing, and ﬁnally came out with tears in their eyes—well that’s what makes a season a success in my estimation,” he said. And so it was over for young Sam Baugh—the end of the season, perhaps the end of his football career. If he had any athletic future at all, he—and most everyone else—assumed, it would be on the baseball diamond.\n\n“I\n\nhad played baseball all my life, and that’s what I wanted to be in the beginning—a professional baseball player,” he recalled. “A fellow I played semipro ball with was going to get me a baseball scholarship to Washington State University, but I hurt my knee about a month before I was supposed to go. I was sliding into second base and caught a spike and tore up the cartilage. Well, if it’d happened today, they’d operate, but back in those days they didn’t know much about knees. The doctor told me to use a mudpack. I put a mudpack with vinegar on my knee. But I couldn’t straighten it out, and the scholarship to Washington State fell through.” The summer after he graduated, with no ﬁrm plans about work or college, he caught on with Mose Sims’s amateur Oilers in Abilene. For the rest of his life, he had a cache of stories about Sims, who called his all-star third baseman “High Schooler.” When Mose drove the Oilers to diamonds around West Texas, Sam liked to sprawl out in the equipment trailer hitched to the car. He could stretch out his long legs back there. On one of their trips, with Mose behind the wheel, Sam and a teammate were in the trailer as the car sped down the highway. The trailer came unhitched. As the car slowed on a downhill grade,\n\n21\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 21\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\na teammate in the front seat commented, “Hey, Mose, there goes Sam,” and Mose looked up to see the wayward trailer passing their car. As Sam’s teammates watched, the trailer bounded over a ditch, sailed through a barbedwife fence, and ﬁnally came to a stop, still upright, in a West Texas pasture. Mose stopped the car on the shoulder and watched Sam and Red climb out of the trailer, none the worse for wear. Mose put his players up every summer in an old house he owned in Abilene. Each player was assigned a chore to do; Sam’s was cooking. One day Mose barged in the door with a sack over his shoulder. “Boys, I found y’all something to eat,” he announced. The sack was full of fresh corn. “I know he stole it,” Sam always said. “Mose, I need a quarter for a haircut,” Sam told Mose as the coach was headed out the door. “Hell, High Schooler,” Sims told him, “I don’t have any money. I paid my last quarter for that corn.” Sam was holding down third base that summer, the summer Dutch Meyer saw him play. Saw him and wanted him at TCU. “I told him I didn’t have any money, that I’d have to have a little help,” Sam recalled. Without a baseball scholarship to offer and knowing that Sam couldn’t afford to go to college without ﬁnancial aid, Meyer, who also coached the TCU basketball team, tried to work a deal with Francis Schmidt, TCU’s head football coach. Schmidt controlled the scholarships. “So I went back and told Coach Schmidt that I had found a kid named Baugh out in West Texas who was a real ﬁne basketball player, was also a baseball player and maybe could play a little football, too. Schmidt had heard of him; Sammy had been blocking back on Sweetwater’s single-wing football team, but the kid Schmidt really wanted from Sweetwater was Red Sheridan, the tailback.” “Baugh is just another blocking back,” Schmidt told Meyer. “I’ve seen Baugh. No thanks.” John Knowles was the student manager on the TCU teams of the midthirties. Whether Schmidt would ever have noticed Sam and his abilities is hard to say, Knowles recalled years later. Schmidt, he said, was set in his ways. “He was a character, one of a kind,” Knowles said. “He would be concentrating on football and didn’t know anything else was going on in the world.” Regardless, Sheridan got away, opting to become a Texas Longhorn. And so did his teammate Sam Baugh. “I was going to TCU right up until the last week,” Sam recalled in 1981. “In about the last 10 days before we had to go to school old Billy Disch, who was the baseball coach at Texas, got in touch with me and told me he’d send\n\n22\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 22\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SA M B AUGH =\n\nme through Texas on a baseball scholarship if I’d come down there. Well, I also wanted to play football, but he talked me into coming down there with this promise—if I didn’t like it he would send me to TCU on the bus. I thought, ‘Well, I can’t lose anything that way,’ so I went and stayed about four days.” Coach Disch—William John Disch officially—already was on his way to becoming a legend. Nearly sixty years old when Sam met him, he had been coaching baseball in Austin since 1900—at St. Edward’s University from 1900 to 1910, and then at the University of Texas from 1911 until he retired in 1940. Known as the “Grand Old Man” of Texas baseball, a strict disciplinarian who always sought perfection from players, he coached his Longhorn teams to twenty-one out of a possible twenty-six Southwest Conference championships. He sent several of his players, including Bibb Falk and Oscar Eckhardt, to the majors. The tall young man from Sweetwater was impressed. He was pretty sure he wanted to be a Longhorn, even more so when white-haired Uncle Billy reminded him that the University of Texas would be a superb showcase for a baseball player with major league aspirations. There was only one hitch: “But when I asked Uncle Billy about playing football, he told me that if I came to Texas, it would have to be for baseball only.” He wasn’t cowed by the big-name coach. He told Disch he would have to think about his offer. He worked out with the Longhorn baseball team every morning, and in the afternoon strolled around the Forty Acres, as the campus is known, gawking at the impressive buildings, lingering under the stately live oaks. And then he would wander over to the stadium where the Longhorn football team was working out under the watchful eye of Dana Xenophon Bible, another legendary coach. Sam made up his mind one afternoon with the sights and sounds of colliding bodies, shouting coaches, and kicked pigskins echoing through the empty seats. “I ﬁnally decided, hell, I wanted to go to TCU, because I couldn’t play football at Texas,” he recalled. Before he left Austin, he called Dutch Meyer and told him he was coming to TCU. Then he walked back to Disch’s office and told him what he had decided. The Longhorn coach said he understood. As agreed, he gave the young man money for the 200-mile bus trip to Cowtown. Sam enrolled in time to go out for freshman football.\n\n23\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 23\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nDUTCH MEYER short,safe,sure\n\nM\n\naybe the best thing that ever happened to Sam Baugh was meeting Dutch Meyer, the TCU coach who discovered the rangy young third baseman on a hardscrabble baseball diamond in Abilene and the ﬁrst football coach in America to build an offense around the forward pass. Sam himself often said that he learned more about football from Dutch Meyer than anybody else he ever met. But Dutch was more than just his coach. He was a mentor, adviser, and perhaps even a surrogate father. “I think he was one of the greatest men I’ve ever known,” Sam said. “He was hard, but he was fair. He treated everybody the same.” That was how John Knowles remembered him too. Knowles, the team’s student manager during Sam’s playing days, said Meyer was approachable. “You could relate to him more than you could Schmidt,” Knowles recalled. He was born Leo Robert Meyer in Waco, Texas, to German parents in a German neighborhood (thus “Dutch,” a common nickname for immigrants from Deutschland). He didn’t learn English until he started school. TCU (known as Add-Ran College until 1902) was then located in Waco, and as a second grader young Dutch hung around a campus gathering place called the TCU Drugstore. He loved sports, and by third grade he was water boy and mascot for the Texas Christian University football team. Years later he loved to recount the crosstown rivalry between TCU and\n\n24\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 24\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= DUTCH MEY ER =\n\nBaylor, which often resulted in citywide ﬁghts. In 1908, the two schools played each other three times. The Christians beat the Bears the ﬁrst two games, and Baylor could not bear the thought that it might happen a third time. Trailing 8–6 at halftime, the Bears resorted to a bit of un-Baptist skullduggery by dressing its talented right end, John Fouts, in TCU purple. TCU howled, but Babe Grant, the Baylor captain, argued there was no rule against it. He was right. TCU was so befuddled and upset that Baylor rallied for a 23–8 win. As Dutch recalled, windows were smashed in Waco that night, and trolley cars were derailed. It would be years before TCU acknowledged the Baylor “victory” in its record books. Young Meyer couldn’t wait until he was a Horned Frog himself. In 1911, ﬁre destroyed the TCU campus, and Fort Worth’s city fathers offered land and transportation connections if the small Disciples of Christ–affiliated school would relocate. Dutch vowed to make the same move just as soon as he was old enough. At Waco High School, he played football for Paul Tyson, one of the most innovative coaches in the game. Tyson’s Waco High Tigers won ﬁve straight state championships, lost only twice during that span, and in nine games scored more than a hundred points. Tyson also concocted an offensive scheme he called the “spinner series,” and he was so successful with it that such big-name college coaches as Pop Warner at Stanford and Knute Rockne at Notre Dame made it their own. Meyer, short and stocky, was a guard in football, a pitcher on the baseball team, and a hot-shooting guard on the Waco Tigers’ basketball team. He graduated from high school in 1917—the class prophecy was that he would be a missionary in Africa—and enrolled at TCU. Perhaps—or perhaps not—he recalled his father’s parting dictum: “Don’t you go out for football!” Once he got to Fort Worth, he immediately went out for the Horned Frogs’ football team. He also played baseball and basketball. TCU football was barely two decades old when Dutch donned the purple and white in the fall of 1917. In 1896, Addison Clark, the son of the university president when the school was at Thorp Spring, Texas (in its pre-Waco days), was just back from the University of Michigan, where, according to an early history of TCU, he had been “bitten by the Football bug.” On Thanksgiving Day, “Little Addie” Clark and a professor named A. C. Easley, “lover of all sports and expert in the military drill,” divided the boys on campus into two squads—the “black stockings” and the “brown stockings”—and had them play a game of football. The Add-Ran boys had no idea what they were doing. They knew rugby,\n\n25\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 25\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nso the professors tried to explain to them that football was a variation on the old British game, although the way the TCU boys played it that afternoon, it was more a friendly brawl. The ﬁnal score was 4–4. “It was a delightful shinkicking affair with little rules and no skill, but it began an era,” the official university history notes. TCU’s young men must have learned fast. They played their ﬁrst intercollegiate contest that same year, against Toby’s Business College. TCU won 8–6. They became the Horned Frogs in 1898, in honor of the little horned creatures—they are actually lizards—that were in abundance on the TCU campus. (Today they are nearly extinct.) TCU had hired its ﬁrst football coach, Joe J. Field, in 1897. He laid down four rules: “1. Abstain from all intoxicants, also coffee and tobacco. 2. Go to bed at ten. 3. Eat no sweets or pastry. 4. Indulge in no kinds of dissipation.” Whether Dutch was following similar rules then or later is not known, but the stocky kid with the lopsided grin was successful at the shin-kicking affair that quickly evolved into college football. He was undersized and knew it, so he relied on relentless aggression to survive among bigger, faster players. “I hunted them up and cut them down,” he recalled years later, “and the bigger they were, the worse it hurt them.” He left TCU during World War I, serving as an ROTC instructor at Transylvania College in Kentucky. He also played end on a Transylvania team he described as the worst college football team of all time. Back at TCU in 1918, he earned eleven varsity letters in three sports, and in 1920 played end on the team that won the championship of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association. (TCU didn’t join the Southwest Conference until 1923.) He didn’t play football his senior year, because of some kind of dispute with his coach, Billy Driver, but he did play basketball, also coached by Driver. He and Driver later became good friends, perhaps because the coach needed Dutch’s set-shooting skills. He was forced to drop out of school a second time, brieﬂy, because of his participation in a hazing incident against TCU ministerial students. Once he got back in school, a milk cow was found in the dean’s office, and suspicion centered on Dutch, but nothing was ever proved. When his nephew, Lambert D. Meyer, enrolled at TCU some years later, Dutch took him aside and told him: “I’ve been at TCU many years and have a spotless reputation here. So I don’t want you to neglect your studies or get into any mischief, because that would reﬂect on my perfect reputation.” That “spotless reputation” must have relied on a lot of willful ignorance on the part of the TCU administration. A Houston-area coach attending a coaching school in 1939 recalled being in a Houston hotel room where\n\n26\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 26\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= DUTCH MEY ER =\n\nDutch was staying and where a group of college coaches was shooting craps inside a larger ring of their colleagues. “Dutch was dressed in some longhandled drawers,” the coach recalled, and when he got down on his knees to take a turn “that ﬂap would come wide open and show his bare ass.” Dutch graduated in 1922 with a degree in geology and immediately signed with the Cleveland Indians baseball team on the strength of his 30-4 pitching record as a Horned Frog. Baseball was his best sport, but he had more brains than talent, scouts said. “He had perfect control but no speed,” one of them recalled. “And when Dutch threw a curve, the third baseman had to duck to keep Dutch’s thumb from hitting him in the eye.” As a sophomore at TCU, he had strained a ligament in his pitching arm, and it still bothered him as he bounced around the minor leagues during the 1922 season. He decided to give up baseball and return to Fort Worth to coach at Polytechnic High School. After a year at Poly, he was back at his beloved alma mater as coach of all freshman sports. He would stay for forty years, the last eleven as athletic director. He was a bantam rooster of a man who loved to chest up to the big boys and beat them. He pulled off so many upsets that he acquired the nickname “the Saturday Fox.” Dutch would scratch and claw until the last second to eke out a victory, whatever the sport. “Fight ’em till hell freezes over,” the coach liked to say, “and then ﬁght ’em on the ice.” Coaching the freshman football team—the freshman teams were known as the Polliwogs—in a game against Terrell Prep one year, his team was so banged up that Meyer had only ten able-bodied men who weren’t limping, lame, or otherwise incapacitated. When the referee told him he would have to produce an eleventh or forfeit the game, he laid one of his injured players on a stretcher and positioned it just inside the out-of-bounds line. The wounded warrior lay quietly while his fellow Wogs ﬁnished the game. Dutch’s teams down through the years were always fun to watch— especially with Sam Baugh and his successor, Davey O’Brien, throwing passes—but Meyer was a sideline show himself. Always on the move, always talking, he would light one cigarette after another, and sometimes shove the lighted end into his mouth. He was constantly plucking and nibbling grass blades and would jam his expensive Stetson down over his ears until, as one observer put it, “he resembled a cat with its head halfway in a salmon can.” “He would tumble off the end of the bench like a drunken troll. And all the time, he’d ad-lib on the ebb and ﬂow: ‘Stop that drop-the-handkerchief and let’s play some football. . . . What luck! Who put the hat on the bed! . . . Receivers as open as a butcher with a butcher knife! . . . They’re blowing us out of the tub! . . . Judas H. Priest! We can’t hit nobody!’”\n\n27\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 27\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nBy the end of the game he was an emotional basket case and would often break into tears—win, lose or draw. After one victory over traditional rival SMU, he wept unashamedly as the team physician wrenched his hat from around his ears, applied hot and cold towels, and sponged his face. Gordon Brown, a legendary high school coach, recalled watching Dutch give a lecture to Texas high school coaches on his famous spread formation. “There was no air conditioning, so he pulled off his shirt, and here’s this chubby little guy with his belly hanging over his belt, and he must have drawn two hundred plays on the chalkboard that morning.” Brown recalled walking away and “thinking I must be the dumbest coach in Texas,” adding, “I learned afterward that it is not the system that makes you successful, but the perfection of the system.” As Sam would soon learn, Dutch Meyer was nothing if not a perfectionist.\n\nD\n\nutch was a keen judge of athletic talent, but he didn’t initially realize what he had when Sam Baugh showed up at TCU as a 170-pound freshman. He had promised the rangy West Texan a part-time job—it turned out to be sweeping out a campus music room—if he decided to enroll at TCU, and he promised him he could play all three sports. Unlike the University of Texas, TCU was too small to be picky about who played what. Meyer wasn’t really expecting much from Sam the football player. He had recruited him as a baseball player, and Sam considered himself primarily a baseball player who happened to play football. The ﬁrst time the Frogs’ trainer saw Sam in a football uniform, he hurried over to Meyer and told him he better get the puny kid off the ﬁeld before somebody hurt him. Meyer just laughed. Freshmen weren’t eligible for varsity football, so Sam was tailback for the Wogs. “Hell, we only played a couple of games,” he recalled years later, “and I can’t even remember if we won any.” In fact, they played three at LaGrave Field, Fort Worth’s minor-league baseball park, which was situated on the Trinity River bottoms between downtown and the stockyards. The Wogs won all three, including a matchup against the John Tarleton College Plowboys, a small college in Stephenville, Texas. “Undoubtedly he can throw a football farther and with more accuracy than anyone seen on Tarleton Field in recent times,” a Stephenville sportswriter noted. Meyer knew, of course, that Sam had played football in high school, but if he knew anything at all about his abilities, it was his punting skill. That was probably what he told Francis Schmidt, the football coach and\n\n28\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 28\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= DUTCH MEY ER =\n\nathletic director. Meyer was counting on Baugh to play third base, but if he came out for football, maybe did a little punting, then that was just an added bonus for TCU athletics. After all, the Frogs needed everybody they could get. That was how things stood until about halfway through the fall semester. Not unlike what happened at Temple during Sam’s freshman year in high school, Meyer and his fellow coaches couldn’t help but notice that the kid who could throw a clothesline strike from third base to ﬁrst on a baseball diamond could do similar things with a football. “By that time, all the coaches realized that the best passing arm in school belonged to some freshman who had been a blocking back in high school,” Meyer’s nephew L. D. Meyer recalled. The Washington Post sportswriter Shirley Povich talked to Dutch Meyer a few years after the coach’s protégé had become an NFL star. “Anybody can throw a forward pass, there’s no trick in that,” Dutch told Povich. “The trick is to turn the pass loose at the right time. That’s how forward passes are completed, and that’s why Sammy Baugh is the best passer football ever saw.” Sam had raw talent, of course, but Dutch reﬁned it. “But he’d have been a ﬁne passer under any coach,” Meyer told Povich, “He has certain traits that makes a good football player. At any other school he’d have been just as successful. But when he came to me at TCU he was just a tall skinny kid who could throw the ball.” The nickname Slingin’ Sam referred to the way he blazed a baseball from third to ﬁrst, but the whiplike right arm made him Slingin’ Sam on the football ﬁeld as well. He often threw sidearm, like a third baseman scooping a hard grounder off the inﬁeld grass and throwing before he got set. He could throw a football from any position or angle, a skill that would come in handy years later when he often had to throw on the run behind weak protection from his Washington Redskin linemen. Unlike technically proﬁcient passers of the modern era, Sam would throw off his back foot, off his front foot, or even with both feet off the ground. Today’s coaches would no doubt try to change him—until they saw what he could do with his unorthodox style. “He was like hundreds of other Texas kids—forward-pass conscious,” Dutch said. “He had a nice pair of hands, and he could make that ball travel, but he was crude as college passers go. No deception, no ﬁnesse, and he didn’t know exactly when to turn the ball loose. But he learned plenty fast. He didn’t like to quit throwing those long passes, but we forced him to. When he began having some luck with those short ﬂips, he was satisﬁed. But he became a great forward passer because he had kind of a sixth sense. He was a good passer instinctively.”\n\n29\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 29\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nMEYER, BAUGH, AND THE PLAN FOR TCU FOOTBALL\n\nDutch got his chance to work with Sam when Coach Schmidt parlayed his success at TCU into the head-coaching job at a midwestern powerhouse, Ohio State University. Twenty-ﬁve years after carrying water for his Horned Frog heroes, Dutch took over as head coach. He immediately began designing an offense that would make the forward pass a tactical weapon, not a mere desperation heave on third down. He would not only confound the Horned Frogs’ opponents, but also rely on the skinny West Texan with a golden arm. In those days most teams ran the single-wing formation on offense and the six-man line on defense. In the single wing, all four backs were usually tightly bunched behind the line (which is how Sam ended up as a blocking back in high school, his passing prowess unused and unappreciated). Tight ends, typically, were just that, lined up within a shoe’s width of the tackles. The compact formation was tailored to the running game. At TCU, Dutch didn’t have an abundance of big linemen who could bunch together and blast out holes for powerful backs to trundle through. He had to be more devious, more daring. Like minutemen in the American Revolution relying on guerrilla tactics against the tightly bunched redcoats, Dutch had to ﬁght his football battles unconventionally. That meant throwing the ball. Nobody threw the ball in the early days of football; in fact, it wasn’t even legal until 1906. In 1913, a small Catholic school in Indiana named Notre Dame, playing against a bigger, faster Army team, relied on the forward pass and upset the highly touted visitors from the East. Playing end for Notre Dame that day was a young man named Knute Rockne, who later became Notre Dame’s coach. Rockne, Pop Warner, Jim Thorpe at Carlisle, Alonso Stagg at the University of Chicago, and John Heisman at Georgia Tech began to experiment with passing’s possibilities. The so-called Meyer Spread resembled the modern shotgun formation. “They said I had my ends sitting in the stands, spread out so wide they would sell soda water between plays,” Dutch recalled. “The truth of the matter is, they were hardly spread at all by more than three to ﬁve yards, so spaced that any of them could make the two-way move to block, in or out. The formation wasn’t conceived so much as a spread for the sake of spraying boys all over the ﬁeld; it was set up for the purpose of ‘anglization.’ We always had a blocking angle in mind.” The man in the backfield who received the direct snap from center was the tailback, not the quarterback. In the old single wing, there was a\n\n30\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 30\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= DUTCH MEY ER =\n\nquarterback, and it was he, not the coach, who called the plays. The rules at the time prohibited coaching from the sideline, and until 1941, a substitute was forbidden from communicating with teammates until he had been in for one play (unless he was substituting for the quarterback). So the single-wing quarterback was indeed a “ﬁeld general.” But unlike today’s quarterbacks, he seldom handled the ball. After calling the play and calling the signals, his main job was to block, and so he was commonly known as the “blocking back.” Dutch didn’t have a blocking back in his spread offense, because his scheme derived from Pop Warner’s double-wing formation, which didn’t have a blocking back either. He didn’t have a position named “quarterback.” Instead, his tailback called the plays—and handled the ball on nearly every play. In addition to his tailback, Dutch had a fullback and two halfbacks, deployed most of the time in such a way that with both of his ends split, he had three slot receivers. Years after Sam’s introduction to the Meyer Spread, he recalled sitting in a classroom and trying to make sense out of three words written on a blackboard: “Short. Safe. Sure.” Sam recalled, “Dutch comes in and says, ‘We’re going to be playing teams that can score on us every time they have the ball. The only way we can match them is to keep the ball away from them. And we’re going to do it with short passing.’” Dutch told his raw protégé that the Frogs would be “playing teams that were better than us, teams that would have us outmanned. And if we tried to play the same game they were playing, they would just run over us.” On the practice ﬁeld, the new coach and his young passer worked on patterns—down-and-outs, hooks, curls, crossovers, slants, comebacks. Sam worked primarily with a receiver named Walter Roach, who had good speed and good hands and who knew how to run good patterns. He was all–Southwest Conference three straight years. “Back in those days, nobody knew anything about the passing game,” Sam recalled. Most teams—even in the pros—would try to pound at you with the running game and then, in desperation, throw on third and long. Then they would just try to throw it as far as they could. Dutch taught us the short passing game, and it was a revolutionary thing for that day and time. We would just move the ball right down the ﬁeld hitting short passes—with little risk of an interception—and nobody could ﬁgure out how to stop it.\n\n31\n\nHolley Pages2.indd 31\n\n7/24/12 3:08 PM\n\n= SLINGIN’ SA M =\n\nL. D. Meyer—also known as Little Dutch—became a favorite Baugh receiver as well. “In those days,” Meyer said, he was the greatest passer I ever saw. And in all the years since, I don’t remember ever seeing anyone better. In all my life, I never saw another passer like Sam Baugh. Sam could throw any kind of ball—off balance or whatever—and he could throw long, short or medium. But he threw a very light ball. Most of Sam’s passes, you could catch ’em with one hand.\n\nAs good as he was at throwing the ball, he was just as good kicking it. Years after he quit playing, teammates and fans told stories about how he could punt the ball and make it land just about anywhere he wanted it to. In the days before passes became a potent weapon, teams relied on punters to keep their opponents backed up in their own end of the ﬁeld. Dutch taught his punters to kick away from the deep man in order to avoid punt returns. During baseball season, Sam would devote a day to punting practice, maybe with another punter on the team or by himself. If he had a partner, Sam would station the man at different spots"
