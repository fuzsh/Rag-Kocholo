        "text": "Though an American, Disch was often associated with the New Wave of science fiction in Britain – where he lived during the late 1970s – which was centred on writers such as Michael Moorcock and M John Harrison, rather than with figures such as Philip K Dick and Ursula Le Guin in the United States, who were also engaged in broadening the field from its pulp origins.\n\nDisch's work was self-consciously literary and ambitious – and became more so as time went on – and was notable from the first for its sardonic wit, chilly anger, cynicism and reliance on irony and allegory. In his later novels and poems, it often seemed that satire had given way to bitterness.\n\nThe critic John Clute judged him \"perhaps the most respected, least trusted, most envied and least read of all modern first-rank SF writers\". He was well-regarded for his poetry (which he wrote as Tom Disch) by many who had no idea that he wrote genre fiction.\n\nThomas Michael Disch was born on February 2 1940 at Des Moines, Iowa, the son of a travelling salesman. He was educated at home and at a Catholic military school; in 1953 the family moved to Minneapolis-St Paul in Minnesota, and he also spent some time in high school there, where he became fascinated by poetry, memorising thousands of lines of verse.\n\nImmediately after school he moved to New York, where he had a series of short-lived jobs: as a salesman; in offices, bookshops, newspapers and a theatre cloakroom. The last led to stints carrying a spear in Swan Lake (behind Margot Fonteyn) and (blacked-up) as a servant in Don Giovanni at the Metropolitan Opera. He also had a brief spell in the Army, from which he was swiftly invalided out after a nervous breakdown. He worked in insurance, then enrolled in architecture lectures and night classes in creative writing at New York University.\n\nAs exams approached in 1962, he realised that he was likely to fail his calculus paper and, under the appearance of another nervous breakdown, devoted the weekend before to writing a short story rather than revising. The Double Timer sold for $112.50 to the sf magazine Fantastic Stories, and he dropped out.\n\nThereafter he devoted himself to writing, though he continued in a series of jobs (bank teller, mortuary worker, advertising copywriter) to pay the bills. His early sf stories were collected in 1966 in One Hundred and Two H Bombs; one of them, \"White Fang Goes Dingo\", was later expanded as his second novel, variously known as Mankind Under the Leash and The Puppies of Terra. Most of this work was later reissued in the collection The Early Science Fiction Stories of Thomas M Disch (1977, edited by David G Hartnell).\n\nThe Puppies of Terra followed on from the themes of his first novel, The Genocides, which appeared in 1965. In it, aliens take over the Earth as a sort of greenhouse. When human beings fight back against a transformation of their environment which threatens their survival, they are gassed like greenfly.\n\nIn the second book, humans are treated as similarly unimportant by conquering aliens, though they are retained as pets. The indifference of the universe to human suffering was a constant theme in Disch's work. Camp Concentration (1968) described a near-future America in which political prisoners are given doses of a drug which greatly enhances their intelligence, but shortens their life expectancy to months. It was a theme not unlike that of Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes (filmed as Charly the same year), but in Disch's tale, the analogies with Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus were explicit.\n\nIndeed, a persistent difficulty for Disch's reputation was that many of his novels were excessively literary by the standards of the science fiction of the time, while seeming to the literary mainstream to be tied to the genre. In later years this caused him to drift away from the field, and to produce, amongst other books, horror novels, criticism, poetry and plays. But from the mid-1960s his output remained as prolific as that of many of his contemporaries who had begun their careers in pulp magazines.\n\nHe and John Sladek, collaborating under the name Cassandra Knye, wrote a Gothic horror, The House That Fear Built (1966); the two later wrote, as Thom Demijohn, a non-sf novel, Black Alice (1968). Disch produced novelisations of the television series The Prisoner and the feature film Alfred the Great (both 1969, the latter as Victor Hastings). Another, huge, Gothic novel, Clara Reeve (1975), appeared under the name Leonie Hargreave.\n\nBut his best-known and best-regarded novels, 334 (1972) and On Wings of Song (1979), were both science fiction, set in a near-future New York. The first described the struggles of the inhabitants of an apartment block (the 334 of the title, which was also used as the basis for the book's structure) against the constraints and indifference of authorities in a dystopian city. On Wings of Song, which won the John W Campbell Award, was less pessimistic, and more popular, than much of the rest of his work. It celebrated the arts (especially opera) as a mechanism for spiritual transcendence in a similarly repressive future, in which fundamentalism dominated the American Midwest.\n\nFrom the 1980s, when he returned to America, Disch concentrated on horror fiction, writing a series of novels set in Minneapolis: The Businessman (1984) was followed by The MD (1989), The Priest (1994) and The Sub (1999); they satirised the American dream by concentrating on the appalling consequences of people getting their hearts' desire.\n\nIn 1986 he produced a computer adventure game, Amnesia, which was popular on the Commodore 64 and Apple II. The same year, he wrote a children's book, The Brave Little Toaster, which was turned into an animated film distributed by Disney. The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars followed in 1988.\n\nHe also produced two acute critical works on sf: The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of (1998) and Disch on SF (2005), as well as two on poetry, The Castle of Indolence (1995) and The Castle of Perseverance (2001). He reviewed theatre for The Nation for many years.\n\nHis own poetry had a relatively narrow audience until the publication of his selected poems, Yes, Let's, in 1989. It was followed by Dark Verses and Light (1991) and About the Size of It (2007). His play The Cardinal Detoxes (1990), which was due to be staged in a former school on Manhattan's Lower East Side, incurred the wrath of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which owned the freehold. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a court order preventing the play from going ahead, it was alleged that the Church subsequently attempted to have the building padlocked shortly before a performance.\n\nThough Disch's supporters claimed that there was nothing profane in the play, a monologue about an archbishop in a drying-out clinic who has killed a pregnant woman in a drink-driving accident and attempts to bribe a judge, Disch was unquestionably hostile to religion. In his lively and entertaining blog on LiveJournal, which ran until July 2, he proclaimed himself God, and encouraged readers to set up shrines in their back gardens, so that their gardening tools would be tax-deductible. One of his forthcoming books, entitled The Word of God, consists of short stories from the Deity's point of view.\n\nA burly, tattooed figure who veered between charm and cantankerousness, Tom Disch lived for many years with the poet Charles Naylor, with whom he produced several anthologies. Naylor died in 2005, after a long illness which exhausted the pair's savings. Their house at Barryville, New York, succumbed to mildew and, since Naylor had been the named tenant on their rent-controlled flat on Union Square West, Disch had been under threat of eviction. He became increasingly depressed both by his failure to gain recognition for his work and his material circumstances. His last blog entry complained about the rising price of food."
