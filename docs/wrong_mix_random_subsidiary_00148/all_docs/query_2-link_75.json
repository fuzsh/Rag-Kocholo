This is as true of the provision of the daily (or nightly) space needed for research, reading, and reﬂection as it is of the incredibly time-consuming labor of formatting, checking of references, and creation of indices. In my particular case, the required sustenance for daily life is such that I have far too many people to thank. Therefore, other than my parents (Tom and Betty Rowe), who are more than one could hope for in loving parents and whom I would especially like to honor and thank, and my parents-in-law (Joe and Pam Ponzi), for whom the same applies, I shall simply list those on the local scene who by their active help, conversation, encouragement, friendship, or sheer stamina in care have allowed the writing of this book: Richard Hays, Moody Smith, Greg Jones, Douglas Campbell, Joel Marcus, Susan Eastman, Stanley Hauerwas, Paul Grifﬁths, Randy Maddox, Stephen Chapman, Ellen Davis, Grant Wacker, Warren Smith, Geoffrey Wainwright, Reinhard Huetter, Allen Verhey, David Toole, Laceye Warner, Allan Poole, Betsy Poole, Margaret Frothingham, Samantha Fisher, the Tonn family, Jeff and Susan McSwain, Rachel Campbell, Carrie Pothoven, Cheryl Blake, Steve Larson, Chip Denton, Megan Wright, Pam Holland, Gini Osborne, Rich and Dick Jarman, T.

These are people—some of whom don’t even know it—who make our daily lives possible. Beyond this, my debt to friends and colleagues across the globe expands exponentially. No matter how well supported, daily life while teaching does not always grant the time needed to write. To that end, my profound thanks are due to two organizations and their ofﬁcers that created an extended time for me to think and write: the Lilly Endowment (for a Faculty Fellowship), and the Louisville Institute (for a Christian Faith and Life grant). My editor at Oxford, Cynthia Read, has been exemplary, as has the production staff. Without them, of course, there would be no book to read. Portions of chapter 2 were previously published as ‘‘The Book of Acts and the Cultural Explication of the Identity of God,’’ in The Word Leaps the Gap: Essays on Scripture and Theology in Honor of Richard B. Hays, edited by J. Ross Wagner et al. (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2008). These portions are reprinted by permission of the publisher, all rights reserved. Finally, I know of no way to thank my wife and son, since they are in a very real sense my daily life, and so I simply dedicate the book to them as a gesture toward the kind of deep hope and—perhaps above all—silliness that goes into the richness of our life together.\n\nContents\n\n1.

But—being a work of New Testament scholarship— the discussion herein is not a philosophical reﬂection on the importance of practical reason or an academic manifesto that proclaims the end of the false dichotomies that plague modern thought. Instead, the argument about these matters is conducted via a historicized discussion of one New Testament text—the one that, in my judgment, best encompasses the difﬁculties and promises of thinking through the particularity of Christian theological knowledge and its embeddedness in a comprehensive pattern of life: the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nThe Project For almost three hundred years—since C. A. Heumann’s article of 1720—the dominant trend in New Testament interpretation has been to read the Acts of the Apostles as a document that argues for the political possibility of harmonious existence between Rome and the early Christian movement (e.g., Heumann, Cadbury, Haenchen, Conzelmann, Tajra, Sterling, Heusler, and Meiser). The few challenges to this view that have arisen amount to little more than adjustments to the basic premise (e.g., Walaskay) or exegetically feeble\n\n4\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\ndenials of the dominant reading (e.g., Horsley).1 To date there has not been a sophisticated, critically constructive reappraisal of Acts’ ecclesiological vision. The time is long overdue for such a study. The underlying reason for such stagnation in the study of Acts is that where the question of Luke’s politics has been taken up, it has been thought about as though one could speak of politics simpliciter.2 For Luke, however, politics is the particular, embodied shape of God’s revelation to the world in the Lord of all, Jesus Christ. To understand Luke’s political vision, therefore, one must examine the way Luke’s narration of God’s apocalypse shapes ecclesiology: theological truth claims and the pattern of life that sustains them—the core practices of Christian communities—are inextricably bound together. Recognizing this interconnection requires a radical reassessment and rereading of Acts. No longer can Acts be seen as a simple apologia that articulates Christianity’s harmlessness vis-a`-vis Rome. Yet neither is it a direct call for liberation, a kind of theological vision that takes for granted the solidity of preexistent political arrangements. Rather, in its attempt to form communities that witness to God’s apocalypse, Luke’s second volume is a highly charged and theologically sophisticated political document that aims at nothing less than the construction of an alternative total way of life—a comprehensive pattern of being—one that runs counter to the life-patterns of the GraecoRoman world. His literary work is thus, in the terms of Frances Young and others, a culture-forming narrative.3 In order to read Acts afresh, the body of this work unfolds in three successive chapters the profound tension that structures Luke’s cultural vision: ‘‘Collision’’ (chapter 2) narrates the cultural explication of divine identity; ‘‘Dikaios’’ (chapter 3) develops the connection between the character of the Christian mission and the rejection of statecraft; and ‘‘World Upside Down’’ (chapter 4) focuses upon the practice of theological knowledge.\n\nChapter 2: Collision The opening chapter argues that Luke narrates the Christian mission to the Gentiles in Acts as an apocalypse (see, e.g., Luke 2:32).4 At its core, the Christian mission claims to be a revelation of God. Inasmuch as this revelation is carried in the formation of a people (‘‘church’’)—rather than merely being a list of academic theses—it entails a necessary challenge to constitutive patterns of pagan life. Embracing the theological vision of the Christian gospel simultaneously creates a new cultural reality. That this process of revelation and formation inherently destabilizes essential assumptions and practices of Mediterranean culture emerges paradigmatically in the scenes in Lystra,\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n5\n\nPhilippi, Athens, and Ephesus (Acts 14, 16, 17, and 19, respectively). These passages, read narratively and in connection to their Graeco-Roman contexts, thus constitute the exegetical lens through which the problem of cultural destabilization is examined.\n\nChapter 3: Dikaios In light of the ﬁndings of chapter 2, chapter 3 argues that the culturally destabilizing character of the Christian mission entails the potential for outsiders to construe Christianity as sedition or treason (as indeed it was so construed). In order to counter such a perception, Luke explicitly raises these and related charges and repeatedly narrates the course of events so that the Christians—here in the mold of Jesus himself—are found ‘‘innocent’’ by the Romans of seditious criminal activity. In the terms of Roman jurisprudence, they are dikaios (iustus). Thus does Luke bring Paul, the representative of the Christians, before the Roman state in the ofﬁcials that are its living agents: Gallio, Claudius Lysias, Felix, and Festus (Acts 18; 21–23; 23–24; and 25–26, respectively). With deft narrative development and considerable jurisprudential skill, Luke moves Paul through to Rome while concurrently negating the charges of his opponents on the basis of a revisionary reading of Roman law: the Christian mission is not a bid for political liberation or a movement that stands in direct opposition to the Roman government. When read together with the preceding chapter, the argument in chapter 3 uncovers the profound tension that lies at the heart of Luke’s literary program. On the one hand, Luke narrates the movement of the Christian mission into the gentile world as a collision with culture-constructing aspects of that world. From the perspective created by this angle of vision, Christianity and pagan culture are competing realities. Inasmuch as embracing Christian theological claims necessarily involves a different way of life, basic patterns of GraecoRoman culture are dissolved. The pagans in Lystra, Philippi, Athens, and Ephesus are understandably riled: the Christians are a real threat (chapter 2). On the other hand, Luke narrates the threat of the Christian mission in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of conceiving it as in direct competition with the Roman state. Of all forms of sedition and treason, Luke tells, Christianity is innocent. Paul may well engender considerable upheaval as a part of his mission, but repeatedly—in Corinth, Jerusalem, Caesarea, and Rome (so the reader understands)—the political authorities reject the accusations of his opponents: Paul is dikaios. The Christians are not out to establish Christendom, as it were (chapter 3). New culture, yes—coup, no. The tension is set.\n\n6\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nChapter 4: World Upside Down Chapter 4 locates the origin of the tension created by the juxtaposition of the arguments in chapters 2 and 3 and, in so doing, argues for a way of reading Acts that derives from thinking the tension that the narrative exhibits. As a way into the argument of the chapter, the ﬁrst section analyzes the narrative and political dynamics of Paul’s and Silas’ visit to Thessalonica (Acts 17:1–10a). More than any other, this scene encapsulates in one compressed piece of text the theological thought that expresses the tension inherent to Acts: the Christian mission is, in Luke’s way of reading reality, a witness to a world that is upside down (17:6). Thus does cultural destabilization (chapter 2) appear to Roman eyes as sedition and treason but emerge in Luke’s counter-narration as the light and forgiveness of God (chapter 3). The deconstructive move of the apocalypse to the gentiles—the novum that requires a new culture—has its reconstructive counterpart in the creation of a people who receive light in darkness, forgiveness of sins, and guidance in the way of peace (e.g., Acts 26:17–18; cf. Luke 1:79). To read reality in this way is, from an outsider’s perspective, clearly to make a radical claim. Yet in Acts, such a claim is not made at an abstract philosophical level but rather in relation to concrete forms of life. The epistemological move that sees things upside down is thus a lived way of knowing, a kind of ‘‘thick’’ knowledge indissolubly tied to a set of practices that are instantiations of a world turned right side up.5 To understand the origin of the narrative tension, therefore, is to examine the most critical practices required by Lukan epistemology. Hence, the remainder of chapter 4 focuses on the way Luke has narrativized three core ecclesial practices that generate the tension produced by the juxtaposition of chapters 2 and 3: the confession of Jesus as Lord (Kyrios), the active mission ‘‘to the end of the earth,’’ and the assembly of the ‘‘Christians.’’ These are core practices in three primary senses: other important activities of the Christian community— economic redistribution, for example—can be traced to these core practices; they are interdependent; and the narrative of Acts is fundamentally inconceivable without them.6 Seen together, these three core practices constitute the practical-theological pattern that produces the tension inherent to Acts’apocalyptic vision. This three-chapter sequence is thus intended not only to overcome literarily an atomistic reading of the text (the perennial peril of the modern exegete), but also to display Luke’s remarkable—if offensive—claim that the culturally destabilizing power of the Christian mission is not to be construed as sedition or treason but rather as the light and forgiveness of God. The dissolution of patterns\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n7\n\nbasic to Graeco-Roman culture (e.g., sacriﬁce to the gods) is nothing less than the necessary consequence of forming life-giving communities. To understand Acts in this way is inconceivable without a sufﬁciently layered description of Graeco-Roman culture.7 If ‘‘culture’’ names the interconnections of concepts and practices that constitute a total way of life (see below), then the necessary historical task is to elucidate the interconnections that form this total way of life. Religion and politics, for example, are not two separate things in Graeco-Roman antiquity but intertwine to form a coherent pattern of life. So, too, religion and economics were not two separate spheres— corresponding, say, to modern academic departments of study—but were inseparable. Politics and economics are thus not ancillary but basic to what we say about ancient religion. Exposing this intertwining is necessary in this book precisely because the narrative power of Acts in the ancient world derives from the way its religious challenge simultaneously undoes political and economic practices. Reading Acts as lively political theology in its time inevitably raises questions that directly relate to several crucial contemporary problems. Indeed, my argument is that engaging Acts in this way offers signiﬁcant resources on which we can draw to understand conﬂicts that arise in light of profoundly different schemes of life. That all serious thinkers are in search of such resources today hardly requires comment. ‘‘God,’’ ‘‘tolerance,’’ ‘‘diversity,’’ ‘‘culture,’’ and ‘‘religious violence’’ are not only topics frequently in the news; they are also words that explicitly point to issues requiring sustained and reﬁned reﬂection in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Hence, after offering a condensed exposition of the reading of Acts given in chapters 2 through 4, the ﬁnal chapter, ‘‘The Apocalypse of Acts and the Life of Truth,’’ engages critical questions that attend the interrelation between universal truth claims and the politics they produce. It should thus be clear: my aim in this book is not simply to ﬁll a gap in the scholarly discussion on Acts but admittedly is rather more ambitious: to reread an ancient text with historical knowledge and acumen precisely so that we might better understand how to think intelligently about the very real problems that face us today.\n\nThe Premises This book is an interdisciplinary project. It requires for its exegetical execution signiﬁcant interaction with scholarship on the New Testament and on GraecoRoman antiquity as well as interaction with contemporary work in political theory, narrative criticism, and constructive theology. Of course, the danger in\n\n8\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nany interdisciplinary project is the temptation to spend too much time justifying the ‘‘poaching’’ in other disciplines. Though easily understandable as moves to hedge academic bets, such justiﬁcations are ﬁnally unnecessary for the simple reason that it is impossible for us to think in non-interdisciplinary ways. While it is obviously—perhaps platitudinously—true that some people will know more about some things than others,8 it is also true that the days are gone when we may conﬁdently inhabit one mode of thought to the exclusion of others—a ‘‘discipline’’ that exists with its own epistemological canons and discrete subject matter. Not only is this the case in practice—there is now simply too much secondary literature to read even within one’s traditional ﬁeld of study—but also in relation to thought: all thinking is done by people whose lives are not lived in discrete moments of intellectual disciplines but in the unity of one, narratively structured life.9 That we can somehow extract our thinking from our lives and think solely in terms of a ﬁeld of study is an illusion; it is in fact the modern university’s social reproduction of a mind/body dualism. We think only within the lives we live, and since our lives are not made up of departments of study, neither is our thinking. Or, more simply: because we live interdisciplinary lives, we think in interdisciplinary terms. Still, for the presentation of thought in writing, there are important ways in which we must make choices, must, that is, decide what to treat directly and what indirectly, what goes in the foreground and what in the background, what is argued for and what is assumed, and so on. It is in this light that we should understand the naming of this project as a ‘‘work of New Testament scholarship.’’ This particular genre signiﬁes the foreground of the book: exegesis constitutes its direct mode of thought, detailed discussion of passages its argumentative discourse. This basic choice of what to place in the foreground of the book and in what primary language to conduct its argument necessarily involves a range of other interpretive choices and commitments. Here we shall enumerate those that best facilitate a reading of the coming material.\n\nActs and the Ancient World The exegetical foreground of the book betrays my commitment to the importance of what Umberto Eco calls the cultural encyclopedia of a text, the wider cultural knowledge (tacit and explicit) assumed by the author and embedded in a text by virtue of its origin within a particular time and place in history.10 To stay with an example invoked previously, in contrast to the cultural encyclopedia relevant to modern democracies, Luke has no idea of a basic bifurcation\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n9\n\nthat many people now claim is necessary, namely, the separation of religion from politics; this distinction is simply not part of the conceptual conﬁgurations or political practices current in the ﬁrst century (or anywhere in antiquity for that matter). To access the cultural encyclopedia of the text of Acts is immediately to become aware of the unity of religion and politics in one form of life. To draw on Eco’s notion is not simply to dress up a tired, old assertion about the importance of historical inquiry in ﬂashy linguistic garb; it is, rather, to point to a more robust philosophical basis for textual interpretation in what Alasdair MacIntyre describes as ‘‘historically situated rationality,’’ namely, the fact that patterns of reasoning appear ‘‘rational’’ only within the context of a larger history that has come to determine what rationality actually is.11 To think that we could understand the patterns of Lukan reasoning as evidenced in the text of Acts without examining the wider history in which such patterns are intelligible is not only to return to a discredited nineteenth-century mode of inquiry—in which the biblical authors’ ‘‘rationality’’ looks suspiciously like that of modern ‘‘critical’’ professors12—but also to abandon our hope for the kind of deep historical work that simply refuses to perpetuate the philosophical myth that places all thinking on a level plane. The truth is that there are not only different ways to think, but different ways to think about how to think. Religion and politics once more: Luke does not have a different opinion on the question of religion and politics from many modern thinkers, he has an entirely different question. Taking Acts’ cultural encyclopedia seriously enables us to offer a richer and more compelling account of the historically situated rationality displayed in the text. In practice, this means that the exegetical arguments of chapters 2 through 4 necessarily involve extensive interaction with various aspects of the GraecoRoman world as a way to contextualize and thus sharpen our perception of the patterns of Lukan reasoning. In principle, seeking to give a rich account of historically situated rationality not only helps us better to understand Acts in the ﬁrst century but also how to think about its interpretation today. If it is true, as Gadamer wanted to teach us, that without hermeneutical ‘‘sympathy ’’ for the text we are reading we cannot hope for a melding of interpretive horizons, it is no less true that we cannot hope to develop a sophisticated version of such sympathy without some genuine understanding of the habits of reasoning that constitute what the horizons actually are. If this book thus rejects a two-step hermeneutical model—a kind of from-then-to-now linear movement—it nevertheless maintains that rigorous historical thickening of the biblical text helps to create the necessary hermeneutical conditions for the kind of analogical thinking required by sensitive readers of the New Testament today.\n\n10\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nActs and the Reader In contrast to a strong stream of past New Testament scholarship,13 this book assumes with Luke Johnson, Hans-Josef Klauck, and others that Acts is best read as a document intended for Christians (though this term was not yet a self-designation). Though individual elements occur that could lend support to an apologia pro ecclesia hypothesis, Acts is primarily concerned not with outwardly directed apologetic but with the story of God’s apocalypse in the mission of the church. And although things would quickly change, Tertullian’s comment near the end of the second century ﬁts well the situation presupposed by the contents of Acts: ‘‘no one turns to our literature who is not already Christian’’ (De Testimonio Animae, 1.4).14 The readers of Acts were not pagan ‘‘seekers’’ or ‘‘cultured despisers’’ of the gospel but Christians for whom such a story told the life of their community/ies.15 It follows, then, that in seeking to explore the interface of Acts and the Graeco-Roman world we are not asking about the perception of Acts within a ‘‘purely’’ pagan framework of thought—what pagans qua pagans would have made of Acts—but more about the contour of Christian life and thought inside conversion as evinced by the dialogical interrelation of Acts and pagan culture. Thus, for example, our question is not about the degree to which Stoics and Epicureans would have found Paul’s speech in Acts 17:16–34 philosophically persuasive but about the effect of Acts 17:16–34 upon the theological life of pagan converts.16 And though the scenes discussed in the body of the book transpire in different geographical locales (Lystra, Athens, Ephesus, etc.), our analysis will not focus diachronically on what pagan converts in these particular places would have made of the scenes that touch only their immediate surroundings17—as if the guiding question in Acts 16:16–40, for example, is whether or not Philippian readers of Acts would have been able to relate a particular event to Luke’s description of the great earthquake (Ø; 16:26). Geography in this book is thus taken more as a feature of theological vision, and less as a guide for mapping the concrete Sitze im Leben of Acts’ readers. The interest, that is, is more in the constructive role local knowledge plays in the narrative and its contribution to the overall literary project. To speak of a literary project is already to say that over against the tendency to think of Acts’ theology in bits and pieces we reject the idea that the passages treated in the coming chapters were read in isolation.18 As an increasing number of scholars are coming to afﬁrm, to write a story is to give the hermeneutical direction, ‘‘read this as a narrative.’’19 Thus is this work interested in the cumulative or total effect of the passages treated in the body of the\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n11\n\nbook. Lest these scenes seem to leave portions of Acts untouched, we hasten to point out that the selected passages articulate animating convictions of Lukan theology and, precisely in this way, serve well as focal instances of the larger perspective rendered through the entire narrative. In short—and to put it in stark terms—I take it that, aside from some basic generalities, we have no idea where Acts was written, or for whom, or at what particular time, or where it was to be sent (if indeed only one place was intended). In light of such ignorance, the proper hermeneutical posture is to practice a kind of interpretive asceticism in relation to what Acts’ actual readers would have made of Acts. ‘‘Readers’’ in this book thus functions primarily as a placeholder for Christian readers of various kinds in the late ﬁrst century and as a word that allows us to talk about the overall theological vision of the narrative of Acts. In simple terms, to ‘‘read’’ Acts is to think Christianly in the late ﬁrst century Graeco-Roman world.\n\nActs and Interpretation One of Acts’ more notable younger scholars, Todd Penner, has recently written an extensive Forschungsbericht that catalogues the enormous methodological variety characterizing current New Testament scholarship on Acts.20 The point here is not to offer observations about any one of the many aspects of Penner’s seventy-page article but rather to step back and consider the piece as a whole: the fact is that the secondary literature on Acts is no longer full to the brim; it has now burst the dam and threatens to wash away the text of Acts in a torrent of scholarly glossolalia.21 Taken as a whole, the present state of Acts research thus points less to the accumulation of scholarly knowledge or a serious advance in exegetical sophistication than it does to a hermeneutical danger: the temptation to neglect a patient rereading of the text and engage in extended argument about the interpretation of the interpretation of Acts. Or, to put it slightly differently, we must beware the tendency to write more about those who write about Acts than about Acts. The great mass of scholarly studies should doubtless inspire hermeneutical humility, but if we are to practice New Testament interpretation, the body of secondary literature should not become the primary subject of our discourse. That place, it must be said, belongs to the New Testament texts themselves.22 The aim of this book is to display in detail my close readings of the passages necessary to sustain my thesis and, hence, to develop the argument by means of actual exegesis. So doing allows the reader not only to see a concentrated presentation of my interpretation of Acts—how I work with the text—but also to follow the basic dependency of this book for its constructive moves on ancient\n\n12\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\ntestimony outside the New Testament. To be sure, there is ample discussion of scholarly hypotheses, contested points of interpretation, problematic hermeneutical paradigms, and other standard academic fare. And for those who know well the scholarly literature, the positions I take in relation to current debates will be readily apparent. But the foreground of the argument is the text of Acts. It is not fundamentally otherwise with the scholarly literature on, for example, the political shape of the concept of sovereignty, or the philosophical importance of practical reason, or the indispensability of narrative as an ordering mode of thought. In agreement with Hans Frei, I argued in Early Narrative Christology that the book would be most compelling as an actual interpretation of the Gospel of Luke if the bulk of the theoretical apparatus were largely invisible. That was hardly to say that it did not exist, but rather that it was left in the background ‘‘at the level of informing presuppositions.’’23 The case is similar here. Thus, for example, running all the way through this book is the position that theology is not just ratiocination, an act of a (disembodied) thinking mind, but is a total life, a context within which thinking is what it is by means of the lives we live. This position can be reasonably contested (and defended) on a variety of grounds. But the argument of this particular book is not really as much about that as it is about Acts—hence, the arguments for the epistemological priority of a theological life remain in the background. Or to take one other example, in chapter 5 I assume, rather than argue for, the position that Acts is a normative text for speciﬁcally Christian reasoning and discourse. Of course, to speak of ‘‘normative’’ texts is to raise complex questions about intracanonical differences, varying emphases within Acts itself, the proper role of Sachkritik, and so forth. These are doubtless important questions, but I do not treat them directly (which, let it be said, is not the same thing as ignoring them). Instead, I simply assume that Christian communities read Acts as scripture and launch the inquiry from there. To defend the necessity of reading Acts as Christian scripture is an important task, but it would be a different book. Taken as a whole, then, this book attempts to deal with the problem of secondary literature not by disregarding it but by refracting its interpretive worth through the text of Acts itself. The hermeneutical choice should thus be clear: there is more in the foreground about our reading of Acts than about our reading of the readings of Acts. This is, after all, a book about Acts.\n\nActs and Modern Vocabulary Since words receive their meaning from their larger semantic context, I am somewhat skeptical of the usefulness of precise deﬁnitions: they are liable to\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n13\n\nskew the reading of sentences for the sake of words whose ‘‘deﬁnitions’’ are supposedly separable from the context in which they occur.24 Still, for this study, there are a few contemporary words whose acquired connotations require us to say more or less what we mean when we use them.25 Culture: Raymond Williams once wrote that ‘‘culture’’ is ‘‘one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language.’’26 How we could ever know such a thing is beyond my comprehension—but it seems right. In any event, this impression did not stop Williams from using the word in multiple publications, and neither shall it stop us. Yet we are undeterred not so much because the term ‘‘culture’’ is without theoretical problems27 or is indisputably the best word to describe a comprehensive pattern of life but more because (1) I know of no better alternatives that name the interconnection of concepts and practices that comprise a total way of life (habitus might work, if we still wrote in Latin),28 and (2) the word is used without deﬁnition so frequently in intellectual work of all kinds (from anthropology departments to papal encyclicals) and in the media that most of us have an intuitive grasp of what we mean—or at least what we are after.29 Where we could get into conceptual difﬁculties, in my judgment, actually has more to do with what we cannot mean if we are to speak intelligently about culture in a way that reﬂects something of the vision of Acts. Saying what we do not mean is of course hermeneutically risky business, at least in the sense that it can quickly lead to the ‘‘death of a thousand qualiﬁcations,’’ as it were. Still, for this book, by culture we cannot mean at least three things: (1) Culture cannot mean: a sphere of life that exists in independence from God, as if God were not the creator of all that is not God (cf. Acts 17:24, 26). In this respect, H. Richard Niebuhr’s famous book Christ and Culture is the example par excellence of how not to speak of culture: in Niebuhrian grammar, Christ is one thing, culture another.30 Whatever this teaches us about Niebuhr’s thought, it is emphatically not what the word culture could mean if it is to be employed rightly in relation to the text of Acts. Indeed, to refer to a confession that will be discussed at length in chapter 4, for Luke, Jesus is Lord of all (Acts 10:36). (2) Culture cannot mean: a piece of reality that is separable from other basic aspects of a total pattern of life (e.g., economy). When historian David Cherry, for example, writes of the effects of Roman presence in North Africa, he separates what belongs inherently together: ‘‘[t]here is in fact no evidence to show that there was any really signiﬁcant measure of cultural change in the region during the period of Roman occupation. It might be supposed instead that the main consequences of the coming of the Romans were economic and social.’’31 Contra Cherry, economic and social consequences are not\n\n14\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nnon-cultural consequences but are instead bound up with what it would mean to speak of cultural consequences in the ﬁrst place. Precisely to the degree that the Romans affected social and economic life, they also effected cultural change. (3) Culture cannot mean: a static backdrop to the text of Acts, as if Acts itself were somehow sealed off from and did not partake of Graeco-Roman culture32; or a pristine reality that Acts attempts to form, as if the new culture that Acts seeks to narrate was to retain nothing from the old. It is of course true that the ‘‘culturally ﬂuid’’ situation of the late antique period bears little resemblance to the situation Acts describes.33 But if we are to speak of culture in relation to Acts, we cannot think in terms of entirely isolated forms of life. To take only one obvious example: when the Christian community ‘‘bursts the conceptual frame’’ of Graeco-Roman ‘‘altruism’’ by engaging in radical economic redistribution (Acts 2:43–47; 4:32–37), they did not attempt to erect their own mint and strike ‘‘Christian’’ coins for use in the network of house churches.34 The governor Felix hopes for Paul’s collection money not for spiritual reasons but because he can use it (Acts 24:17, 23, 26). In this book, the word ‘‘culture’’ is thus employed with a certain interpretive lightness of foot. Its meaning is not overly determined for the sake of what is inevitably an elusive deﬁnitional precision, but neither is the word so vacuous as to be left without substance. With all the necessary qualiﬁcations, culture nevertheless remains the word we shall employ to name the interconnections that make and sustain a total pattern of life. Pagan: Like culture, ‘‘pagan’’ is a word chosen primarily because of the lack of workable alternatives. In some quarters, of course, the word could be taken to imply a denigration of non-Jews or non-Christians—a synonym for bad religion or immorality—but this is scarcely necessary, and it is certainly not the meaning invoked here. Indeed, as we will see in chapter 3, especially as we consider the narrative appropriation of Roman jurisprudence, Luke himself hardly conceives of paganism in intellectually simplistic or moralistic terms.35 ‘‘Pagan’’ in this book, therefore, has rather to do with a simple way to point to the people in the ancient world who were neither Jewish nor Christian and is here employed in the same manner as we ﬁnd it in the work of scholars of classical antiquity such as Peter Brown, Ramsay MacMullen, Mary Beard, Glen Bowersock, Robin Lane Fox, Fergus Millar, John North, Simon Price, and others. The word is not, of course, intended to reduce, systematize, or smooth over the internal contestations or vast diversity of life in the Graeco-Roman world. But for the purposes of this study the term ‘‘pagan’’ does limit Graeco-Roman diversity in one crucial respect: the confrontation with the Christian mission. Talal Asad may be right that there are no ‘‘self-contained societies,’’ or\n\nREADING ACTS\n\n15\n\n‘‘autonomous civilizations,’’ in the sense that there has always been interconnection, interaction, mutual borrowing, and so forth between what have been taken to be vastly different peoples or cultures.36 But one does not have to endorse the intellectual ﬁction of complete cultural isolation, or the absence of internal diversity and contestation, to see that in fact paganism names well a contained area of life in the ancient world—at least in the profoundly signiﬁcant sense that it is incapable of including a missionizing Christianity without the loss of what it would mean to be pagan. Christian: Despite employing a plethora of terms for the early followers of Jesus, Luke studiously avoids characterizing them as ‘‘Christians.’’ Moreover, as will be seen in chapter 4, Christian is itself a term that originated as a label given by outsiders for those who followed the man Christus, and it evokes from Luke a narratively crucial rejection of the word’s normal meaning. Still, I know of no alternatives that are descriptively more advantageous than Christian when it comes naming the community of those who live in the Way. There are copious cumbersome alternatives and somewhat odd proposals,37 but in my judgment, Christian remains the best word that points unambiguously to the pattern of communal life that Jews and Gentiles have together in their common confession of Jesus of Nazareth as Lord of all. The term should thus not be understood as a chronological signal that locates Acts at a deﬁnite point somewhere in the complex questions that surround the parting of the ways between Judaism and Christianity but as an effort to point clearly to the community that Acts both presupposes and seeks to create. As we use ‘‘Gospels’’ to talk about the texts that were later called the Gospels, so we use ‘‘Christians’’ to talk about the people that were later named Christians.\n\nThe Hope This book does not depend upon or advocate a particular method. Rather, it embodies a multidimensional constructive purpose: as in a piece of music, there are discernable themes—or strands of thought—but the themes are inextricably woven together in service of a complex telos. Thus, as a composer might wish to direct attention toward particularly important themes of a work and concurrently insist that the work as a whole is the performance of these themes simultaneously, so I wish to insist that to understand this book attention must be given both to these themes and to the fact that they are played, as it were, all at once. The reluctance to reduce the book’s animating intellectual moves to a speciﬁc method does not stem from skittishness about matters methodological.\n\n16\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nIt has rather to do with the recognition that ours is a time in which there exists tangible evidence of massive and irrevocable shifts in thought and life that have occurred both on the ‘‘long march’’ from the Protestant Reformation to the present day, and within the last ﬁfteen years in particular, in which the explosion of the interpretive horizon of everyday life has become a lived fact (‘‘globalism’’—the digital age, worldwide markets, market states, news media, transnational currencies, etc.).38 The tangible evidence of these shifts in New Testament studies is not so much the bewildering array of different methodologies for reading the New Testament or even their obvious backside, the expression of profound dissatisfaction with established modes of inquiry.39 It is more what the whole reality of the methodological plethora portends: that we do not quite know what we are doing or how we ought to proceed, that studying the texts of the New Testament is a task requiring skills that exceed our capacity of methodological construction.40 We are therefore learning as we go. And, indeed, this is not surprising. Late (or post) modernity names our experience of the fact that we lost our way and must search again for how to ﬁnd it. It also names, however, a time of great hope and expectation, at least in the sense that the fundamental need for creative engagement with the foundational texts of Christian discourse is widely perceived and eagerly pursued. It is in this light that the hope that underwrites the telos of this book is best seen. If the book’s aim—why I wrote it rather than something else—has most of all to do with what it means to read the New Testament at close range within a particular historically situated rationality, its hope is to display a way of thinking that is in step with the text itself. In this book, that is, our attempt to think (long) after the text is also our attempt to think with it.\n\n2 Collision: Explicating Divine Identity\n\nWith few exceptions, New Testament scholars are not accustomed to reading Karl Barth for help with their historical and exegetical work. Yet at one point at least, it is Barth above all others in our time who has clearly seen a central theological point without which the historical dynamics involved in Christian origins are virtually unintelligible: God is the measure of all things.1 To speak properly of God in Barth’s sense is not to speak of the grandest object within our horizon but of the reality that constitutes the total horizon of all human life. God is not derivative of human culture (a` la Feuerbach, Freud, et al.) but generative. The hermeneutical corollary of Barth’s insight is of momentous consequence and can be simply stated: what we think about God will determine what we think about everything else.2 To speak of ‘‘God’’ is to invoke the context for all understanding, that to which all life and thought are related: to the extent that we live and think at all, therefore, we do so in light of our understanding—whether explicit or implicit—of God. Theology, that is, is never merely ideation. It is always and inherently a total way of life. The early Christians were not Barthians. Yet, to see that the contour of their life derived from their understanding of God is to penetrate to the core of the conﬂict that surrounded their birth and growth. From 1 Thessalonians (1:9) through Pliny’s famous epistle (10.96) to the persecution under Decius and beyond, the clash of the gods ultimately determined the shape of the collision between (emerging) Christianity and paganism.3 There was of course\n\n18\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nconfusion, diversity, difference, and complex interaction between paganism and Christianity. But the conﬂict as a whole and the instantiation of a new culture—for that is what it was—are utterly inconceivable apart from the clash between the exclusivity of the Christian God and the wider mode of pagan religiousness.4 To put it slightly differently: once one grasps the primary— sensu stricto—importance of God for a total way of life, the conﬂict becomes intelligible. Converting to the God of the Christians was not merely an adjustment of this or that aspect of an otherwise unaltered basic cultural pattern; rather, worshipping the God of the Christians simultaneously involved (1) an extraction or removal from constitutive aspects of pagan culture (e.g., sacriﬁce to the gods), and (2) a concomitant cultural proﬁle that rendered Christians identiﬁable as a group by outsiders.5 Yet the practices that created this cultural proﬁle were themselves dependent upon the identity of God. Christian ecclesial life, in other words, was the cultural explication of God’s identity. Taken as a whole, the narrative of the Acts of the Apostles is a rich exposition of this cultural explication of divine identity. In the book of Acts, the expansion of God’s PÆªªºØ is coterminous with the creation of a people whom, in Luke’s terms, God has taken out of the gentiles for his name’s sake (Acts 15:14: O Łe K ŒłÆ ºÆ E K KŁ H ºÆe ﬁH O ÆØ ÆPF).6 The revelation of God in Christ, that is, necessarily entails the formation of a people who bear witness to God’s name.7 In this way, volume two of Luke’s overall literary project displays the narrative outworking of the claim in volume one that the salvation of God comes through Jesus Christ as an apocalypse to the gentiles (Luke 2:30–32; Acts 13:47; cf. Isa 42:6; 49:9). To elucidate these matters from the entirety of Acts would require a fulllength commentary. Here we limit our focus to four especially illuminating instances in which the reconﬁguration of divine identity necessitated by the witness of the early missionaries results in a collision between the expansion of the gospel and essential assumptions of ancient pagan life: the accounts of the Christian mission in Lystra (Acts 14:8–19), Philippi (Acts 16:16–24), Athens (17:16–34), and Ephesus (19:18–40).\n\nActs 14: Paul and Barnabas—Hermes and Zeus To all but a few of the highly educated, the gods were indeed a potential presence whom a miracle might reveal.8 After escaping a second straight round of persecution (ﬁrst in Pisidian Antioch, then in Iconium), Paul and Barnabas make their way through\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n19\n\nDerbe, Lystra, and the surrounding countryside preaching the gospel (PÆªªºØÇ Ø qÆ , 14:7). In the Roman colony Lystra, Paul dramatically heals a cripple who had been listening to Paul preach (14:9a) and who had the Ø to be healed (F øŁB ÆØ, 14:9bc).9 The effect upon the crowds is immediate and overwhelming: they respond with religious acclamation and prepare to make a sacriﬁcial offering to Paul and Barnabas as Hermes and Zeus respectively (14:11–13). The apostles,10 delayed by their inability to understand Lycaonian,11 ﬁnally rush forth to protest this pagan worship and to call for its abandonment on the basis of a reconﬁguration of divine identity (14:14–18). As a result, after the arrival of some Jews from Antioch and Iconium, the crowds are persuaded to stone Paul (14:19).12 Though it is perhaps startling to moderns, it is hardly surprising that in the ancient world a display of power would occasion the acclamation ƒ Łd ›ØøŁ I Łæ Ø ŒÆ ÅÆ æe A (14:11; ‘‘the gods have come down to us in the likeness of human beings’’). Not only was great theological importance attached to miracles,13 but Graeco-Roman religious sensibilities had long been under the ‘‘spell of Homer,’’14 in which the appearance of the gods in human form was to be expected: ‘‘gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities.’’15 This was no less true in various hamlets or in the interior of Asia Minor than it was in Greece itself: ‘‘Even in wretched Olbia, on the Black Sea, the wandering orator Dio (ca. 100 AD) ﬂattered his audience on their passion for Homer and his poems.’’16 Philosophers, of course, from Xenophanes and Plato to the time of the NT and beyond were critical of Homer’s anthropomorphism of the gods, crudely interpreted.17 Only through sophisticated demythologization of the inherited mythology could Aristotle, for example, make the views of the ‘‘forefathers and earliest thinkers . . . intelligible’’ (Metaphysics, 12.8.18 [1074B]).18 Among intellectuals, this criticism naturally gained considerable currency. Luke’s contemporary Josephus, for example, praises ‘‘the severe censure’’ of the Homeric tales by the ‘‘leading thinkers’’ among the ‘‘admired sages of Greece.’’19 Yet, if we take our measure from material remains and from the views presupposed by the critics’ criticism—as well as from the kind of data we see in Pausanias’s vivid descriptions of local piety, for example—we ﬁnd that ‘‘far into the second and third centuries AD, this piety of the majority survived the wit of poets and philosophers.’’20 Alexander of Abonuteichos, to take but one outstanding case from the mid-second century AD, began his career by addressing the people from a high altar, [congratulating] the city because it was at once to receive the god [Asclepius] in visible presence.\n\n20\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nThe assembly—for almost the whole city, including women, old men, and youths, had come running—marveled, prayed and worshipped. Uttering a few meaningless words like Hebrew or Phoenician, he dazed the people, who did not know what he was saying save only that he everywhere brought in Apollo and Asclepius.21 After Alexander displays his divine powers by producing a small snake he had secretly prepared for the occasion, the people ‘‘at once raised a shout [and] welcomed the god.’’22 Lucian is no doubt having a bit of fun here, but in point of fact the cult in Abonuteichos was enormously successful and did center on Alexander and his pet snake. From ‘‘around 150 to the mid-170s, people ﬂocked to this distant point where Providence seemed to have broken afresh into the world. Its god gave personal advice to Romans of the highest rank and sent an oracle to the Emperor himself.’’23 If behind Lucian’s satire, therefore, we glimpse a philosophically trained (Pythagorean) and religiously nimble Alexander, we must also see that his skillful charlatanry was well calculated to ﬁt a vast, believing public. Nor is it any surprise that in Lystra the local priest of Zeus and the crowds instantly prepare to sacriﬁce to Paul and Barnabas (ŁØ , 14:13, 18), inasmuch as to worship the gods in antiquity was to sacriﬁce. Ovid’s Metamorphoses, to cite a work obviously germane to Acts 14, opens its treatment of transformation with Jupiter’s (Zeus’s) account of his descent from Olympus ‘‘as a god disguised in human form [deus humana . . . imagine].’’ After appearing at his destination in the guise of a human, says Jupiter to his divine audience, ‘‘I gave a sign that a god had come, and the common folk began to worship me’’ (I.200–220, LCL trans.). Ovid’s tale is signiﬁcant, not simply because he was still the most inﬂuential poet of Rome when it was composed (ca. AD 8), but because it reﬂects, with Acts 14:8–18, a common typos, a standard way of thinking about the appearance of the gods and the human response to them (cf. Acts 10:25–26 and 28:1–10). Indeed, if we read on in the Metamorphoses to Book VIII, we ﬁnd the delightful account of Jupiter’s and Mercury’s visit—specie mortali—to the Phrygian countryside, where they are (ﬁnally24) received hospitably by the old couple Baucis and Philemon, who eventually ask to serve as priests for the gods (i.e., to guard their temple, to preside over the sacriﬁces, etc., lns. 707–8). The similarity to Luke’s account of Paul and Barnabas in Lystra is striking, and it is not without good reason that Acts scholars have frequently drawn attention to this passage in the Metamorphoses as a possible basis for Luke’s story.25 Prima facie, one might easily think the Lystrans’ eagerness to honor Barnabas and Paul makes excellent sense in light of their religious prehistory: Zeus and Hermes had been sighted in the interior of Asia Minor before.\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n21\n\nWhether or not Luke knew the story in Ovid’s Metamorphoses or a local tradition is largely indeterminable.26 The syncretistic Jew Artapanus (second century BC), for example, tells of Egyptians who accorded Moses divine honors and designated him Hermes in response to his hermeneutical skill.27 And Horace, too, suggests that Augustus was Mercury in human shape.28 But that Luke shares with Ovid and other Graeco-Romans a basic understanding of the religious patterns that surround the appearance of the gods can hardly be denied. In this, as in other areas of his portrayal of paganism (see the following), Luke is simply a man of his time. As Lane Fox puts it, ‘‘Acts’ author believed this response was natural.’’29 Where Luke’s historical situatedness is forgotten, the critical theological edge of this carefully sketched scene is badly blunted. Haenchen, for example, asks with respect to the pagan response to Barnabas and Paul, ‘‘But is it really conceivable?’’ His answer is clearly that it is not: That the priest of Zeus would immediately believe that the two wonderworkers were Zeus and Hermes, and hasten up with the oxen and garlands, is highly improbable. . . . It is not only the priest’s credulity, moreover, but that of the people which is unconvincing. The healing of the cripple was admittedly a great miracle. But surely not so great as to persuade the Lycaonians that their very gods stood in their midst.30 But this reading is, at best, to replace ancient religious practice with its philosophical critique, or already to adopt unawares the perspective of Paul and Barnabas. At worst, it is no less than a radical modernizing of the text, in the sense that it dismisses fundamental aspects of pagan religion as mere silliness.31 By contrast, to become aware of the normalcy—indeed, the religious propriety—of the pagan reaction is to become aware of the requisite background against which Luke’s scene derives its critical force. For Luke’s call through the mouths of Paul and Barnabas is not simply an admonition to tweak a rite or halt a ceremony. It contains, rather, the summons that simultaneously involves the destruction of an entire mode of being religious. It is true, of course, that in a certain respect Paul and Barnabas appear ‘‘as genuine philosophers who reject such attempts at deiﬁcation’’32 and, in this way, evince a joining of hands with pagan philosophical criticism.33 Yet merely to note this connection is to reduce the import of the passage to a single point of contact with a small minority in the wider culture. With few exceptions, principal philosophical critique was directed more against superstition (see, e.g., Plutarch’s æd ØØÆØ Æ34) and overly literal interpretation of myth than it was against cultic practice.35 In spite of the\n\n22\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nmanifest theological problems exposed by his lucid dialogue on the nature of the gods, for example, Cicero believed ﬁrmly in the necessity of traditional cultic practice (Nat. D., I.ii.4) and was himself—again, despite De Divinatione—a member of the College of Augurs (Nat. D., I.vi.14).36 So, too, the same Plutarch who ranted against the impiety of the superstitious in his earlier years, later became a priest at Delphi with no sense of discontinuity. And the Stoics, despite Zeno’s criticism of building temples to gods, ‘‘attend the mysteries in temples, go up to the Acropolis, do reverence to statues [ æŒı FØ . . . a Å], and place wreathes upon the shrines.’’37 Even Epicureans, though sometimes considered atheists,38 sacriﬁced to the gods.39 Luke’s criticism, however, goes much deeper and aims at the very foundations that support the ediﬁce of pagan religiousness in the effort to break the entire structure with a single biblical word—ÆØÆ.40 Accompanied by prophetic action—the rending of their clothes41—Paul and Barnabas characterize the whole scene as worthless, futile, or vain.42 Though ‘‘images’’ (NŒ =IªºÆÆ= Æ Æ) are not excluded, the passage gives no indication that they are directly in view. At this point, images are not in themselves the problem. Rather, the critique reaches further, toward the entire religious complex of pagan deities and cultic sacriﬁce. Luke is not interested in philosophical reform or in demythologizing but in K Øæç, a conversion to a way of life incompatible with traditional pagan cults (cf. Acts 15:3, c K Øæçc H KŁ H ; 26:20, ŒÆd E Ł Ø I ªªºº Æ E ŒÆd K ØæçØ K d e Ł ).43 Turn, say Paul and Barnabas, from these backward acclamations (the honor of mere humans as Ł) and lifeless practices (sacriﬁce) to the living God.44 Where the pagan action would bring the human and divine almost entirely together, there is in the cry (ŒæÇ ) of Paul and Barnabas the explicit emphasis upon ¼ Łæø Ø in their sheer humanness, as it were, as an attempt to open a space between human beings and God. ˚Æd E . . . K ¼ Łæø Ø is emphatic and, indeed, reminds the reader of Peter’s similar exclamation when confronted by a prostrate Cornelius: ŒÆd Kªg ÆPe ¼ Łæø NØ! (10:26).45 In both cases, the speakers move to establish a common humanity with their audience and, hence, to drive an ontological wedge between themselves and the divine. In Acts 14:15 this attempt is further strengthened with the use of ›Ø ÆŁE . . . E , particularly as it counterbalances E . . . K : ˙E ›Ø ÆŁE K E ¼ Łæø Ø: ‘‘we’’ are just like ‘‘you’’—human beings through and through. ˇØ ÆŁ would of course, to the ear of the philosophically trained auditor, seal the deconstructive case: a true Ł is one without Ł.46 Paul and Barnabas are human.\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n23\n\nYet the message is not simply cease and desist. Rather, as Luke Johnson notes, the religious impulse of the crowds is received even as the ofﬁcial machinery is shut off. In this way, the reception of the pagan impulse involves an essential reinterpretation as to its telos—the living God. Barrett is correct that Łe ÇH is ‘‘almost a proper name’’;47 the potency of the name comes through in the utter contrast between death and life, the turning away from ø H ÆÆø toward Łe ÇH Æ, the source of life itself: God ‘‘made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them’’ (v. 15).48 To be the ‘‘living’’ God is to be Creator, to possess, that is, the life-giving power to do good and to bring rain and sustenance (v. 17). The pagan religious impulse is thus redirected toward the living God by a sweeping criticism and the unveiling of the true divine reality behind the gifts that sustain life in the natural world. Zeus was of course seen as the giver of good things—K ØØ ÆØ ªaæ c IªÆŁa ÆPe I Łæ Ø49—and, in particular, as the rain-god (˘f Ø= ˇ æ, etc.). In fact, these two functions could easily be linked, as Pausanias reports: ‘‘there is on Parnes another altar, and on it they make sacriﬁce, calling Zeus sometimes Rain-god (Z æØ ) and sometimes Averter of Ills (I Ø ).’’50 In light of these well-known functions of Zeus,51 the radical nature of the apostles’ reinterpretation emerges in that it does not, in the manner of Aristobulus, for example, consist of a simple substitution of numinous realities—‘‘that which you call Zeus is really the God of Israel.’’52 It thus has no afﬁnity with ancient pluralism (in which, e.g., divine names can be only incidental to divine realities).53 Instead, it involves both a demolition of the pagan model in toto (worshipping Zeus is futile) and the call for a new construction of divine identity. Cilliers Breytenbach puts well the implicit theological ground: the God whom they preach is not only ‘‘der lebendige Gott’’ but ‘‘auch der einzige lebendige Gott.’’54 At least as Luke would have it, the telos of the pagan religious impulse is not in need of a different or additional name; rather, the impulse itself requires a fundamentally new direction, from dead worship to the living God. With such a message, it is no great wonder that the crowds, having barely (ºØ) been put off, are subsequently persuaded to attack (14:18–19).55 This end to the episode in Lystra articulates narratively the offense caused by a collision of divine identity and the practices it entails. Contrary to much received scholarly wisdom, in Acts the gospel does not routinely meet with exuberant acceptance among the gentiles (cf., e.g., 14:2 and the careful ‹Ø formulation of 13:48).56 It may well be that in past generations God allowed all the gentiles to walk in their own ways (v. 16, K ÆE ÆæﬁøåÅ ÆØ ª ÆE YÆ\n\nÆ a Ł Å æŁÆØ ÆE ›E ÆPH ), but the phrase intimates that the time has now come for gentiles to turn away from their foolish › toward the\n\n24\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nliving God.57 If idolatry is at least as much ‘‘an error about the management of society (a political error)’’ as it is an error of the mind,58 it should occasion no surprise that those who would be affected by the destabilizing power of its theological critique should attempt to drive the bearers of this critique out of their community.\n\nActs 16: Power at Philippi [S]treet prophets were strongly in evidence. We hear much about prophetic women, ‘‘pythonesses,’’ as they were popularly known.59 After Paul’s escape from Lystra, Luke narrates swiftly the passage through Derbe and Paul’s eventual journey to the apostolic council (14:19–15:5). Upon approval from James and the council, Paul resumes his Mediterranean mission and soon thereafter, in response to a vision, travels to the Roman colony of Philippi. In Philippi, after the conversion of Lydia (16:14–15), the missionaries are ‘‘opposed’’ ( Æ BÆØ) by a certain ÆØŒÅ, who has a FÆ Łø Æ by whose oracles she is able to bring to her masters (ŒæØØ) much economic beneﬁt. Subsequent to their initial meeting, the mantic girl continues to follow the missionaries around crying (ŒæÆÇ ), ‘‘These men are slaves F ŁF F łı, who proclaim to you a way of salvation’’ (16:17).60 Paul, who is greatly annoyed, exorcises the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ (16:18), and, in turn, the girl’s masters—with the Zåº and æÆÅª (vv. 22–23)—see that Paul is removed from their midst. The narrative force of v. 17’s initial ambiguity is disclosed when we recall that ołØ was a term ‘‘vague enough to suit any god treated as the supreme being.’’61 Within the world of the story, that is, there exists the linguistic and chronological space—Paul was followed for ‘‘many days’’ ( ººa æÆ)—for the pagan misidentiﬁcation of the God of Israel with the highest god in the (local) pantheon.62 Indeed, if Stephen Mitchell is right, there ‘‘are good grounds for thinking that the place where this confrontation occurred was a sanctuary of Theos Hypsistos. . . . [T]he cult of Theos Hypsistos is well attested epigraphically in cities of the Aegean and Propontic Thrace around the middle of the ﬁrst century AD.’’63 In any case, such fusion and interchangeability of the divine were of course commonplaces in Graeco-Roman antiquity, at both the popular and philosophical levels. As Celsus would later put it, ‘‘I think . . . that it makes no difference whether we call Zeus the Most High [ołØ ], or Zen, or Adonai, or Sabaoth, or Ammon like the Egyptians, or Papaeus like the Scythians.’’64\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n25\n\nThis is hardly to say, of course, that the proclamation (ŒÆÆªªººø)65 presupposed by the narrative was itself polytheistic, as if Christian readers of Acts would be unaware of the speciﬁc identity of the Most High God. Rather, it is to point out that the auditor can realistically imagine that the gentile audience of Paul and his companions (E, v. 17) would have heard the mantic’s cry as a polytheistic interpretation of Christian proclamation—that is, these are the prophets of the Most High (ołØ ˘) who provide healing (øÅæÆ).66 Indeed, as Klauck suggests, this conscription of God’s identity by local religious tradition may well be the (implied) reason for Paul’s annoyance (v. 18).67 The ambiguity in the phrase F ŁF F łı, however, lasts only until the exorcism, at which time the identity of the Most High receives christological speciﬁcation: › Łe ołØ is not Zeus ołØ (or any other ‘‘supreme being’’) but the God who works øÅæÆ through the name of Jesus Christ (cf. Acts 4:12!). Moreover, prior to this speciﬁcation, it is not clear within the world of the story that Paul’s proclamation necessarily entails an attack upon pagan religiousness. But the explicit appearance of the name Jesus Christ involves a simultaneous confrontation with a pagan FÆ (or Æø ) and the economic practices that depend upon pneumatic presence. That the citizens of Philippi ﬁnd the implications of this confrontation threatening is made clear by the ensuing events, in which the power of Jesus Christ is interpreted narratively as a force of subversion for the religio-economic habits of the polis (vv. 19–24). Such habits are represented in the character of the mantic girl. Though some scholars note the possible meaning of Łø as ‘‘ventriloquist,’’68 this reading would make little sense here.69 However much the double accusative may surprise us,70 it seems clear that the meaning is something like ‘‘a pythian/ pythonic spirit.’’71 The description is not of linguistic trickery but of the animating spirit that is the source of the oracles (Æ ı Å, v. 16).72 It is this spirit of divination—in Plutarch’s language, the Æø 73—that is the immediate target of Paul’s exorcism. This emerges clearly in v. 18, where Luke is careful to differentiate the spirit (Ø) from the girl (I ÆPB) through Paul’s direct address to the FÆ: ‘‘I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out from her.’’ Thus it is that the intense anger of the masters is narratively intelligible. It is not that Paul has announced the nature of a ventriloquist’s linguistic trick to the wider public in order to enlighten their minds, but rather that he has destroyed the means by which the oracles were produced. The display of power through the evocation of the name Jesus Christ has removed dynamically— rather than simply epistemologically—the economic beneﬁt derived from the possession of the girl. The masters own the ÆØŒÅ, not the FÆ. The spirit\n\n26\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nhas gone out (K BºŁ ).74 Indeed, the text may even suggest that this display of Jesus Christ’s superior power was visible to the masters: they see (N ) that the hope of their gain has gone out (K BºŁ ).75 It is this dynamic character of the exorcism that is ﬁnally what is so fundamentally disruptive in Philippi. If Cicero is right, there had long been philosophical criticism of Æ ØŒ (Div., 1.3–5; Nat. D., 2.3.9), at least in its more ofﬁcial forms.76 Yet, Paul’s action is hardly the type of intellectual stroke that can be parried by the piety of the masses.77 To the contrary, the vanquishing of the pythonic spirit is a tear in the basic fabric of pagan popular religion in that it demonstrates publicly the weakness of the pagan FÆ in the face of the missionaries and their message. Inasmuch as such religious life was woven together with material gain,78 such a tear means the unraveling of manticbased economics as well (v. 19). If it is anywhere near true that ‘‘prophetic persons were to be found everywhere, in the cities, the countryside, in every cultural zone of the Empire,’’79 the economic effect could well be considerable. In this sense, the masters of the ÆØŒÅ perceive rightly that the power of the name Jesus Christ extends beyond one mantic; Paul and Silas are in fact ‘‘disturbing the city’’ (v. 19). Verse 21 thus encapsulates the juxtaposition of perspectives present in the conﬂict: ‘‘they advocate customs which are not legal for us Romans to accept or practice’’ (ŒÆd ŒÆÆªªººıØ ŁÅ L PŒ Ø E ÆæÆåŁÆØ Pb EØ øÆØ sØ ). Of course if we read from Luke’s perspective and take PŒ Ø in v. 21 in a strictly legal sense, the charges are untrue and incapable of substantiation, as we know from the magistrates’ decision to release Paul and Silas in peace (16:36, prior to their knowledge that Paul and Silas are Roman citizens). The missionaries are not calling for riotous insurrection (Ø). Yet, read from within the perspective of the characters who utter the charges, it must be admitted that, despite their motivation (v. 19), they have witnessed in Paul’s exorcism the inherently destabilizing power of Jesus Christ for the pagan way of life. The recognition of the superior power of Jesus Christ is simultaneously the invalidation of the power claims of other ÆÆ. As Ramsey MacMullen rightly notes, ‘‘The unique force of Christian wonderworking . . . lies in the fact that it destroyed belief as well as creating it—that is, if you credited it, you had then to credit the view that went with it, denying the character of god to all other divine powers whatsoever.’’80 To adopt the ŁÅ advocated by these missionaries, as in fact happens in the Philippian pericopae both preceding and following (Lydia and the jailer), would thus be to accept ( ÆæÆåŁÆØ) and to embody ( ØE ) a set of convictions that run counter to (PŒ Ø ) the religious life of the polis. In this way, too, the Zåº and æÆÅª—doubtless encouraged by the ıÆEØ= øÆEØ contrast81—are\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n27\n\ngiven credible motive in the logic of the narrative to join in the attack (vv. 22–23). Harbingers of economic and religious disaster rarely elicit affection. Given such a confrontational display of power, it is hardly surprising that after their beating and imprisonment, the missionaries are ﬁnally asked to leave the city (vv. 22–24, 39).\n\nActs 17: Athens After leaving Philippi, Paul and Silas immediately become engaged in another disturbance, this time in Thessalonica. The two missionaries are therefore sent away by night to Beroea. After some success, the crowds are again incited against Paul, and he is sent on to Athens, the site of his famous address before the Areopagus (17:22–31).82 At least since Martin Dibelius’s seminal analysis in 1939, this speech has been interpreted—broadly speaking—as Luke’s attempt to establish common ground with the more philosophically minded of the pagans.83 As Dibelius famously puts it, 17:30–31 contain ‘‘the only Christian sentence in the Areopagus speech.’’ Taken as a whole, ‘‘the main ideas of the speech . . . are Stoic rather than Christian.’’84 It is not difﬁcult to see how, in general, such a conclusion could be reached. After all, it does appear on the face of it that Luke adduces an inscription and echoes well-known pagan religio-philosophical traditions in an attempt at intellectual rapprochement. Yet such a reading ﬁnally ignores the basic interpretive moves through which Luke places pagan traditions within a different hermeneutical context and thereby transforms their meaning. In order to see this transformation of meaning, we must attend ﬁrst to the context of the speech before moving to an analysis of the speech itself.\n\nSetting the Stage Modern studies of the Areopagus speech have tended to concentrate almost exclusively on the speech proper and have, as a consequence, made use of the material surrounding the actual speech only where it is deemed immediately relevant.85 This procedure is helpful when comparing Lukan speeches to one another. Yet, when it comes to understanding the Areopagus discourse in the narrative of Acts, Paul’s speech should not be read in isolation from its surrounding context, as isolating the speech renders irrelevant a series of crucial statements that determine the way it should be heard. To interpret Acts 17:22–31 in context is thus to observe the carefully placed and explicit\n\n28\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nnarrative markers in 17:16–21 that shape the reader’s perception of Paul’s speech. Luke prefaces the speech with the hermeneutically signiﬁcant remark in 17:16 that while Paul was waiting in Athens for Silas and Timothy, Ææø e\n\nFÆ ÆPF K ÆPﬁH ŁøæF ŒÆøº sÆ c ºØ . Whether one translates Ææø as ‘‘vexed’’ (Barrett), ‘‘provoked’’ (RSV), or ‘‘exasperated’’ (Talbert), the general sense is clear. Paul is not moved by the city’s rich philosophical or cultural heritage;86 he is, rather, ‘‘deeply distressed’’ (NRSV) by what he sees in Athens.87 Luke’s description of the cause of Paul’s distress also marks the entry to the speech: ŒÆøº. Though this word turns up elsewhere only in the Acts of John and Georgius Syncellius (ca. AD 900), its basic meaning in its present context is readily discernable, particularly in light of the immediate connection to Ææø . Athens is a ‘‘veritable forest of idols.’’88 This judgment not only coheres with what we know of the city from other ancient sources89 but also adds narrative force to the Athenian misunderstanding of Paul’s preaching: those who believe Jesus and the Resurrection to be two different divinities, ÅF (masc.) and I ÆØ (fem.), have heard Paul’s preaching with polytheistic ears (17:18c).90 Or, to switch the metaphor, when refracted through interpretive lenses ground in a city full of idols (ŒÆøº sÆ c ºØ ), the resurrection of Jesus cannot help but be fundamentally distorted and misunderstood. No less important is the term used by the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers to denigrate Paul for his lack of sophistication, æºª (v. 18). Demosthenes, for example, on one occasion wrote of his accuser Aeschines: ‘‘Why if my calumniator had been Aeacus, or Rhadamanthus, or Minos, instead of a mere scandal-monger, a market-place loafer [Iººa c æºª;\n\nææØ IªæA] . . . he could hardly have used such language, or equipped himself with such offensive expressions’’ (De Corona, 18.127 [269], LCL trans.). And Dio Chrysostom characterizes the Cynics as æºªØ those who post ‘‘themselves at street-corners, in alleyways, and at temple-gates . . . stringing together rough jokes and much tittle-tattle [ ººc æºªÆ ] and that low badinage that smacks of the market-place [a IªæÆı ÆÆ]’’ (Discourse, 32.9, LCL trans.). In a similar manner, Paul’s argumentation (Øºª, v. 17a), so say the learned, reveals his ignorance of the primary sources (as we might put it) and simultaneously brands him as a philosophical poser. At best, his scraps of knowledge come from one of the ﬂorilegia circulating in the Iªæ (v. 17);91 at worst, from the coffee shop talk at Barnes & Noble. Of course, by this time in the narrative of Acts, when an auditor hears Paul insulted, it arouses immediate distrust in the judgment of the insulters. Such\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n29\n\ndistrust of the philosophers’ judgment, in turn, accompanies the auditor through Paul’s speech and shapes the perception of the speech in a crucially important way: the mention of æºª by characters whose perspective on the matter is to be distrusted cleverly eliminates the possibility of reading Paul’s citation of Aratus and allusion to pagan ‘‘poets’’ as evidence of his superﬁciality.92 Frontloading the æºª charge gets this objection out of the way, as it were, while concurrently positioning the auditor against the philosophers’ accusation. When the subsequent allusions and citations are made, the auditor thus understands that Paul (Luke) is no æºª and is thereby encouraged to discern the import of these ‘‘scraps’’ of gentile philosophical or religious traditions. Subtlety, implies Luke, should hardly be confused with ignorant babbling.93 The response to Paul’s proclamation in Athens is suggested through the use of K ØºÆ ÆØ, the ﬁrst word that describes an actual action on the part of those to whom Paul had preached (PÅªªºÇ, v. 18). While it is true that K ØºÆ ÆØ can be used with the sense ‘‘of a well-intentioned attachment,’’94 Ga¨rtner was correct to draw attention to the other occurrences in Luke–Acts in which Luke uses the word to mean something like ‘‘to lay hold of’’ or ‘‘to seize’’ (Luke 23:26; Acts 16:19; 17:6; 18:17; 21:30, 33).95 In particular, in Acts 16:19, as here in 17:19, Luke employs K ØºÆ ÆØ with the preposition K in order to speak about Paul and Silas’s appearance before certain authorities: ‘‘[H]aving seized [K ØºÆ Ø] Paul and Silas, they drug them into the agora K d f ¼æå Æ’’ (cf. K d f ºØæåÆ in 17:6). In both 16:19 and 17:19, K ØºÆ Ø carries the sense of ‘‘to seize,’’ with the intent of forcing the apprehended person to appear before the political authorities. Jerome got it right, therefore, when he translated K ØºÆ ÆØ here in 17:19 as apprehendere in the Vulgate (et apprehensum eum ad Areopagum duxerunt).96 As a result of his preaching, Paul was apprehended and brought before Athenian authorities: K `æı ªı ´ıº.97 the areopagus. Of course, as is evident in this discussion, such a reading of K ØºÆ ÆØ is shaped in part by one’s interpretation of the ensuing scene, especially the ambiguous phrase K d e ¢ æØ ª .98 Many modern scholars, at least since Norden’s famous book, take this phrase to mean that Paul was brought to the ‘‘hill of Ares’’ rather than before K ` æı ªı ´ıº. But to focus upon the hill to the exclusion of the council is highly problematic. Given Paul’s location in the agora in vv. 17–18, it makes little sense to think that he would be removed from there simply in order to be given yet another chance at getting his point across.99 Nock saw this issue clearly when he asked,\n\n30\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\n‘‘But why on earth should men take Paul to this hill?’’100 Moreover, excluding the council causes the allusions to the trial of Socrates (vv. 19–20, see below) to lose their narrative force entirely; indeed, the allusions become pointless: why direct so carefully the auditors’ attention to Socrates’ trial if it is not meant to inform their understanding of Paul’s situation in Athens? So, too, both Greek and Latin patristic interpretation—in part because of the allusions to Socrates—uniformly read the scene as Paul’s appearance before the Athenian tribunal.101 Finally, though K ﬁø (in the phrase ÆŁd b —ÆFº K ﬁø) can refer in the Lukan writings to geographical location (Luke 21:21), the overwhelming sense is ‘‘amidst’’ (Luke 2:46; 8:7; 10:3; 22:27; 24:36; Acts 1:15; 2:22; 27:21).102 That this is the sense of K ﬁø here is conﬁrmed by the conclusion of the speech in which Luke writes that Paul K BºŁ KŒ ı ÆPﬁH .103 Paul speaks in the midst of a group of people, that is, the Areopagus council.104 For these and other reasons—for example, in Acts the political authorities appear only when Christians are under (threat of) attack105—different scholars have taken K d e ¢ æØ ª to refer to the Areopagus council. Strictly speaking, as T. D. Barnes argues, this interpretation is not incompatible with the notion that Paul was led to a hill, inasmuch as (1) the council originally derived its name from its meeting place on Ares’ Hill, and (2) there is no solid evidence, contra Haenchen, Cadbury, and others, that the council ever ceased to meet on this hill.106 Thus, while Nock’s question previously quoted points out the weakness of the view that excludes the council from the picture in Acts, it can also potentially be answered: Paul was taken to Ares’ Hill because that is where the Areopagus council met. As Barnes puts it: ‘‘The obvious meaning of the words in Acts should be accepted: Paul was taken before the Areopagus, i.e. before the council sitting on the hill.’’107 To those who might object that the hill itself was unsuitable for the gathering Luke presupposes (e.g., Haenchen, Cadbury), one could point out, as several scholars have (e.g., Dibelius), that the ridge below the hill’s zenith allows room for many people to gather. In addition, the number of people presupposed is open to debate (17:34 does not necessarily imply that all those in Athens who believed were present at the Areopagus speech). The worry, therefore, that Luke did not discriminate between the two different senses of ‘‘Areopagus’’ actually displays well the false alternative inherent in the modern effort to separate them.108 There is no exegetical need to distinguish clearly between the two senses of Areopagus. Though the precise range of functions is not entirely clear, the power of the Areopagus council itself was well known in antiquity across both time and geographical locale. Lucian, for instance, presupposes the recognizable authority of the Areopagus when he stages his ingenious mock trial of various\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n31\n\nphilosophies in front of the council (notably, upon the hill; Double Indictment, 4ff.).109 And Diogenes Laertius writes of Stilpo’s arraignment before the Areopagus for denying that Phidias’s statue of Athena was a god (Ł), suggests that Theodorus either barely escaped the hemlock death penalty or received it at the hand of the Areopagus (for giving himself out as Ł), and notes that Cleanthes was hauled before the Areopagus to give account of how he sustained himself (Lives, 2.116; 2.101; 7.169, respectively). Inscriptions, communications between Athens and the Roman emperor, and so forth, all conﬁrm the picture gained from the literary evidence: ‘‘In short,’’ as T. D. Barnes has argued, ‘‘the Areopagus seems to be the effective government of Roman Athens and its chief court. As such, like the imperial Senate in Rome, it could interfere in any aspect of corporate life—education, philosophical lectures, public morality, foreign cults. . . . Its general constitutional position enabled it to control religion no less than any other part of the life of Athens.’’110 By writing that Paul was seized (K ØºÆ ÆØ) and brought before the Areopagus council, Luke thus draws on the Mediterranean cultural encyclopedia to situate Paul’s speech within an overtly political context. The speech is not simply a peaceful philosophical dialogue with his curious opponents. It is, instead, so the attuned reader understands, a moment in which Christian preaching—once again—has drawn the attention of the governing authorities. That such a moment is indeed perilous for Paul is indicated by the questions and charges in vv. 19b and 20 that recall the infamous trial of Socrates. New Testament scholars have long noted the connection of 17:19b and 17:20 to the charges brought against Socrates. Acts 17:19b reads: ı ŁÆ ª H ÆØ ŒÆØ c ÆoÅ e F ºÆºı Å ØÆå. Contra Barrett, for example, ı ŁÆ here is stronger than a ‘‘polite request’’ (‘‘may we . . . ’’).111 Indeed, given the authority of the Areopagus, it may well be that the sentence is more of a demand or statement of intention than a question (see the questionable punctuation of NA27, NRSV, NIV, etc.): ‘‘we have the right to know . . . ’’ is probably not too strong. ˜ ÆÆØ in this reading would be closer to its meaning ‘‘to enjoy a legal right,’’ as in Acts 25:11 or P. Oxy 899 (ln. 31; second/third centuries): ÆÆØ B ªøæªÆ I ÅººåŁÆØ.112 That an authoritative or political reading of ÆÆØ in this context captures better its semantic drift corresponds to the rest of the sentence and to v. 20a, in which ŒÆØ c ØÆå and the participle Ç Æ together with NçæØ sound the bells of warning:\n\nÇ Æ ªæ Ø Æ NçæØ KØ a IŒa H . Embedded in the cultural memory of antiquity was the understanding that Socrates was brought to trial and received the death penalty in part for introducing ‘‘new,’’ ‘‘strange’’ gods.113 As much as Xenophon’s and Plato’s portrayals of Socrates may differ, both authors are agreed—almost verba-\n\n32\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\ntim—in their judgment about this particular charge. Xenophon, for example, begins his Memorabilia by stating the words of the Athenian indictment: ‘‘Socrates is guilty of rejecting the gods acknowledged by the state and of bringing in other, new deities’’ (1.1.1: IØŒE \"øŒæÅ R b ºØ ÇØ Łf P Çø ; æÆ b ŒÆØ a ÆØ ØÆ Nçæø ).114 But, says Xenophon, ‘‘Socrates was no more bringing in anything new than others who acknowledge divination . . . augury. . . oracles . . . coincidences and sacriﬁces’’ (1.1.3: › Pb ŒÆØ æ Nçæ).115 In Plato’s Apology we meet the same charge, this time through the mouth of Socrates himself: ‘‘[The charge] says: ‘Socrates is guilty because . . . he does not acknowledge the gods that the polis acknowledges but other, new deities’ ’’ (24BC; \"øŒæÅ çÅd IØŒE f . . . Łf R\n\nºØ ÇØ P Ç Æ; æÆ b ÆØ ØÆ ŒÆØ ).116 Regardless of its historical accuracy—though it is likely accurate—this memory persisted in undiluted form through the time of the NT and beyond, as Christian, pagan, and Jewish sources attest.117 We have no evidence that Luke had read Xenophon or Plato, but the remarkable similarity of language—\n\nø ÆØ ø (v. 18), ŒÆØ c ÆoÅ ØÆå; Ç Æ; NçæØ (v. 19–20),\n\nØ; ŒÆØ æ (v. 21)118—suggests nothing less than a conscious attempt on Luke’s part to vivify the memory of Socrates’ trial in the minds of his auditors and forge a connection to the Athenian reputation for enforcing the death penalty upon those who brought in new gods.119 Once awakened, the memory of Socrates’ trial reverberates with the text of Acts to create an analogy between Paul’s situation and that of Socrates. The reader is therewith enjoined to discern in Paul’s arraignment the potential for death.120 Like Socrates, Paul is charged by the governing Athenian council with introducing strange, new deities (Jesus and Resurrection),121 and, like Socrates, Paul’s life may be forfeited.122 The transition from the demand of the Areopagus (vv. 19–20) to Paul’s speech (vv. 22–31) is provided by a remark that is usually taken to reﬂect Luke’s knowledge of yet another familiar aspect of Athens’ reputation: the proverbial curiosity of its citizens (#ŁÅ ÆEØ . . . ŒÆd ƒ K ØÅF Ø N Pb æ ÅPŒÆæı j ºªØ Ø j IŒØ Ø ŒÆØ æ , v. 21). At its most obvious, this reading of v. 21 is doubtless correct. Yet to say that v. 21 speaks here of Athenian curiosity in ‘‘a nonpejorative sense’’ or gives the ‘‘motive’’ of the Areopagus is to miss Luke’s clever and well-placed criticism.123 Contra Conzelmann and others—who in essence reduce v. 21 to a needless or pedestrian comment124—Luke is not merely adding local color by means of stock knowledge. Through his careful use of Ø and ŒÆØ æ Luke creates a sense of irony in which the attentive reader can recognize Athenian hypocrisy: the council is prepared to threaten Paul with the charge of bringing in\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n33\n\nŒÆØ = Æ ÆØ ØÆ, but it is the Athenians themselves who admit Ø into their city and together with them spend time telling and hearing something ŒÆØ æ . The force of the comparative here should not be lost,125 as if Luke had simply written ŒÆØ (e.g., NRSV, RSV, etc.). To the contrary, ŒÆØ æ has a speciﬁc referent with which it is to be compared: the preaching of Paul. The reputation of Athens is thus turned against the city itself, as Luke makes use of common knowledge to reverse the charges brought against Paul. It is the Athenians who ‘‘do not themselves hold to legitimating tradition’’ but seek after even newer things.126 A careful reading of vv. 16–21 thus creates a distinct Vorversta¨ndnis with which the reader then hears Paul’s speech. Instead of a romantic view of Athens as the place of university-like debate, Luke portrays the city’s rampant idolatry—Paul is rightly vexed—as the context in which the Christian preaching of the resurrection of Jesus (1) is distorted and (2) results in a potentially life-threatening situation for Paul vis-a`-vis the political authorities (who are themselves enmeshed in hypocrisy). Moreover, via the word æºª and resonance with the trial of Socrates, the reader is prepared not only to encounter scraps of pagan traditions in Paul’s speech but also to discern in them a wider signiﬁcance than their mere occurrence initially suggests. the speech. For our present purposes, we do not have to analyze each important element of Paul’s speech.127 We will instead focus upon ﬁve interconnected features that call for further elaboration. First, despite both Lucian and Apuleius, Acts 17:22 is widely seen by modern scholars to be an excellent example of a captatio benevolentiae with which ancient orators opened a speech: ÆŁd b › —ÆFº K ﬁø F #æı ªı çÅ ¼ æ #ŁÅ ÆEØ; ŒÆa Æ ‰ ØØÆØ æı A ŁøæH.128 This interpretation of 17:22 depends entirely upon taking ØØÆØ æ as ‘‘very religious,’’ which of course it can well mean.129 In this reading, Luke displays yet again his awareness of common knowledge about Athens and puts it to use in good rhetorical form.130 Under threat, Paul attempts to ﬂatter his audience and win their goodwill. Conversely, other scholars note the clearly pejorative sense ØØÆø could carry in the ancient world and interpret the sentence not as an adroit rhetorical move but as Paul’s frontal attack on Athenian ‘‘superstition.’’131 This reading, furthermore, points back to 17:16, where Luke explicitly states that Paul was exasperated at the idolatry of the city, and forward to 17:30, where Paul characterizes Athenian idolatry as ¼ª ØÆ (cf. 17:23!)—scarcely a laudation of their piety.132 In fact, however, these two different readings of ØØÆø are but different sides of the same coin. As Hans-Josef Klauck notes,133 Luke actually\n\n34\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\nexploits the ambiguity of ØØÆØ æ. The characters of the story, that is, hear ØØÆØ æ in a complimentary sense, while the auditors— remembering the perspective created by 17:16—hear Luke’s critique of Athenian idolatry as superstition. ˜ØØÆØ æ is simultaneously very ‘‘religious’’ and ‘‘superstitious.’’ To eliminate the ambiguity of ØØÆØ æ, therefore, is to eliminate the dramatic irony and the sophisticated manner in which this technique negotiates between the author’s historical presentation and the reader’s contemporary situation.134 By contrast, to discern the dramatic irony in the ﬁrst sentence of Paul’s address is to become alert to the subtlety and richness of the multilevel discourse of the speech. Second, though such an inscription has yet to turn up, Paul asserts that he found in Athens an altar K ﬁz K ªªæÆ #ª ﬁø ŁﬁH.135 In light of the Socratic resonance—the speciﬁc accusation of bringing in new, strange gods—it is not surprising that Luke narrates Paul’s ﬁrst theological move as one that attempts to deﬂect the charge of newness: ‘‘what therefore you worship unknowing, this I proclaim to you’’ (n s Iª F P E; F Kªg ŒÆÆªªººø E ). Paul’s proclamation is not new, for his message in Athens is preceded there by the reality that evokes it. Indeed, Paul speciﬁes this unknown god as ‘‘the God who made the world and everything in it,’’ thus locating the ultimate basis of his proclamation in the origin of the cosmos.136 To link the identity of the unknown god with creation is to undermine in the most radical way possible the charge of preaching a new divinity. Bluntly put, it can scarcely get older than this: the God about whom Paul speaks created the world in which Athens exists. Third, Paul indicates immediately—within the same sentence—the implications that follow from God’s identity as the Lord and maker of all things, namely, that the Creator/creature distinction precludes the attempt to fashion God in human terms, as if God could live in shrines and needed to receive ministrations.137 With PŒ K åØæ ØØ ÆE ŒÆØŒE Pb e åØæH I Łæø ø ŁæÆ ÆØ æ Ø , Paul does not say anything of which the best pagan philosophy was unaware.138 Indeed, the phrasing intentionally resonates with a wide array of philosophical traditions. Despite the standard practice of caring for the images of the gods (washing, offerings, etc.), Greek philosophers at least since Socrates had been critical of the crude theological views that such practice presupposed. In Plato’s Euthyphro, for example, Socrates attempts to push Euthyphro toward a better deﬁnition of holiness by asking, ‘‘What advantage could come to the gods from the gifts which they receive from us? Everybody sees what they give us. No good that we possess but that is given by them. What advantage can they gain\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n35\n\nby what they get from us? Have we so much the better of them in this commerce that we get all good things from them, and they get nothing from us?’’ Euthyphro takes the bait and responds, ‘‘What! Socrates. Do you suppose that the gods gain anything by what they get from us?’’ (14E–15A). Roman memory, too, entailed a period of 170 years of aniconic worship. Though such aniconism was likely wishful thinking, at the very least Varro knew that true gods do not need sacriﬁce.139 By Luke’s time such criticism was a philosophical commonplace, particularly among Stoics. Seneca, for example, strove time and again to purify crassly material notions of divinity by sundering their tie to the practices of caring for images: ‘‘Let us forbid lamps to be lighted on the sabbath, since gods do not need light. . . . God is worshipped by those who truly know him. Let us forbid bringing towels and ﬂesh-scrapers to Jupiter, and proffering mirrors to Juno; for God seeks no servants. Of course not.’’140 And Lucian knew, as well as any Stoic, that Apollo needed no precious metals for his honor: ‘‘the god takes no interest in your gold-work,’’ says Solon to Croesus (Charon, 12).141 At least for the more sophisticated, ‘‘the anthropomorphism of Greek cult statues does not mean that the Greeks thought their gods actually were people’’ that required cleansing, food (i.e., sacriﬁces), and care.142 Yet we must once again be wary of projecting the philosophers’ views onto the wider populus. Where modern scholars might readily sympathize with the philosophers, many—probably most—ancients took their images rather more sincerely.143 If Lane Fox’s statement that ‘‘the identiﬁcation of god and image was very strong at all levels of society’’ is somewhat too strong, it is nevertheless broadly accurate and has the added merit of taking pagan religion seriously.144 The citizens of Orchomenos in Boeotia, for example, vanquished a ghost by fashioning and physically restraining its ¼ªÆºÆ: A ghost, say the city’s inhabitants, carrying a rock was ravaging the land. When they inquired at Delphi, the god told them to discover the remains of Actaeon and bury them in the earth. He also told them to make a bronze likeness of the ghost and fasten it to a rock with iron. I have myself seen this image thus fastened. They. . . sacriﬁce to Actaeon as to a hero.145 Of course, the Orchomenians were hardly the only people to treat images as something ‘‘real.’’ In Thasos, to take another striking example, the statue (NŒ ) of the famous athlete Theagenes was prosecuted, convicted of murder, and sentenced to be thrown into the sea. Later, however, in response to an oracle from the Pythian priestess, the Thasians wished to retrieve the statue to halt\n\n36\n\nWORLD UPSIDE DOWN\n\na famine. When they could not ﬁnd a way to recover it, the statue placed itself into the net of some ﬁshermen and was thereby restored to its original place. The Thasians, notes Pausanias, sacriﬁce to this image of Theagenes as if to a god (– ŁﬁH).146 The power of images was, moreover, hardly limited to the ‘‘supernatural’’ effect of an otherwise dead piece of stone or wood. Indeed, images of the gods could appear to be alive. Even Lucian, satirist and skeptic though he was, tells of a statue of Apollo that moves, sweats, spins, and leaps from one priest to another. This god, in fact, speaks ‘‘without priests or prophets.’’147 Despite Lucian’s silence, we may be tempted to discern trickery here or, at best, to read the events symbolically. But this is to move immediately into modern intellectual space and, hence, to work anachronistically. As one scholar put it when commenting on this particular passage, for the ancients ‘‘this image was a god, its actions were supernatural, its utterances oracular.’’148 So, too, within a less explicitly public sphere, evidence remains of ‘‘secret rites which were thought to ‘animate’ [statues] and draw a divine ‘presence’ into their material.’’149 Political emissaries brought images with them for assistance or had them shipped.150 Travelers carried statuettes on their journeys.151 Statues worked miracles, cured diseases, changed expressions, or less positively, were buried, ﬂogged, chained, banished, defamed, lusted after, and so on.152 In short, despite traditions of critical reﬂection, the practice of viewing ‘‘shrines made by human hands’’ as habitations of divine ﬁgures was an essential component of the larger pagan construal of reality.153 Thus in Acts 17:24–25 Luke aligns Paul with the broadly philosophical critique of the interface between the gods and their images. At the same time, the narrative furthers the reshaping of the readers’ religious imagination by placing its theological foundation in the transcendence of the Creator God over the world of images. That such a move is conceptually similar to the statement in Acts 14:15 is not mere coincidence. Much to the contrary, the similarity points to a fundamentally important part of Luke’s narrative project vis-a`vis gentile converts: to break the connection between God and the world that underwrites pagan religion. Luke’s advocacy for this rupture, however, depends ultimately not on philosophically superior notions of e ŁE (17:29) but upon a biblically funded doctrine of › Ł as the transcendent Creator of the cosmos (Isa 42:5: ŒæØ › Łe › ØÆ e PæÆ . . . › æÆ c ªB ŒÆd a K ÆPﬁ B). To hear clearly Ææ ÆØ and ŒÆøº in Acts 17:16 is to understand 17:24–25 at the narrative theological level not so much as philosophical critique as a skillfully articulated charge of idolatry. Fourth, Luke further develops Paul’s critique of Athenian idolatry by subsuming Graeco-Roman religio-philosophical knowledge into the biblical\n\nCOLLISION : EXPLICATING DIVINE IDENTITY\n\n37\n\nstory. God’s purpose in creating all ( A Ł I Łæ ø ) from one (K $ )154 was so that they might seek, even grope, after God and ﬁnd him (17:26–27).155 The ground for this seeking and ﬁnding is, for Luke, ultimately biblical: ‘‘You will seek the Lord your God and you will ﬁnd him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul’’ (Deut 4:29; cf. Isa 55:6, etc.). But here he presents only the linguistic ‘‘point of contact’’ with pagan thinking, as he moves Paul—once again the rhetor—through a series of allusions to and citations of gentile philosophy and poetry.156 Paul’s statement in 17:27 that God is not far (P ÆŒæ ) from each one of us, if not entirely marketplace phrasing, was hardly secret wisdom. It could easily win praise from Seneca, for example, who knew that ‘‘we do not need . . . to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his image’s ear, as if in this way our prayers were more likely to be heard. God is near you, he is with you, he is in you’’ (Ep., 41.1: prope est a te deus, tecum est, intus est). Josephus, too, as Norden recognized, reﬂects precisely this thought when rewriting Solomon’s dedicatory prayer in 1 Kings: because of the Temple, the people should always be persuaded that God ‘‘is present and not far removed’’ ( æØ ŒÆd ÆŒæa PŒ IçÅŒÆ; AJ, 8.108).157 And Dio Chrysostom comes still closer to Acts: ‘‘For these earlier men were not far from [P ÆŒæ"
