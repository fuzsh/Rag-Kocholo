        "text": "Tom Disch died on the 4th July.\n\nI loved his work. The first novel of his I read was actually his first novel, The Genocides. Great post-alien invasion novel unlike anything I had read at the time – Earth is planted out with enormous alien plants and the remnants of humanity scrape an existance living among the roots, trying to avoid alien pest control!\n\nI read several of his other novels: Camp Concentration, The Puppies of Terra, 334 (probably my favourite; I was looking at the the other day, wondering whether to re-read it or not), On Wings of Song, The M.D. and others, but it was really his short stories I most enjoyed. The collections I have at home all have top stories in them… too many to pick a favourite.\n\nHe often addressed weighty themes, and didn’t shy away from down-beat endings, but he was also responsible for writing the story behind a great, uplifting animated movie – The Brave Little Toaster, a wonderful parable featuring household goods on a quest!\n\nI understand he was depressed and took his own life; but he’ll always remain a great writer, and one of my favourite authors both when I was discovering science fiction, and beyond, once I knew a bit about ‘the good stuff’.\n\nI guess I will read 334 now.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nTransreal Fiction\n\nMy twitter handle is @transrealshop should you wish to follow me for other news, etc.\n\nRecent (2021) Google Street View (the restaurant next door is now a bubble tea cafe/restaurant)\n\n_________\n\nTransreal Fiction is closed on Sundays & Mondays.\n\nTransreal Fiction is a shop dedicated to selling science fiction, fantasy & related books, together with a limited selection of other merchandise.But really, it’s about books. Transreal Fiction opened in April 1997 in Cowgatehead and moved to it’s present location nearby in June 2011. The owner, Mike Calder, first sold sf & f books many years ago and has worked in the business either part- or full-time since. For years he also had a respectable job as well, but that’s another story…\n\nThe shop is named after the term coined by Rudy Rucker to describe his fiction and I thought it an apt name for a shop specialising in speculative fiction. And, in case you’re wondering, yes, Rudy Rucker was happy to allow me to use of the term as a name for my shop."
