        "text": "Thomas Michael Disch Biography\n\nThomas Michael Disch (February 2, 1940 – July 4, 2008) was an American science fiction author and poet. He won the Hugo Award for Best Related Book – previously called \"Best Non-Fiction Book\" – in 1999, and he had two other Hugo nominations and nine Nebula Award nominations to his credit, plus one win of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, a Rhysling Award, and two Seiun Awards, among others. In the 1960s, his work began appearing in science-fiction magazines. His critically acclaimed science fiction novels, The Genocides, Camp Concentration, 334 and On Wings of Song are major contributions to the New Wave science fiction movement. In 1996, his book The Castle of Indolence: On Poetry, Poets, and Poetasters was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and in 1999, Disch won the Nonfiction Hugo for The Dreams Our Stuff Is Made Of, a meditation on the impact of science fiction on our culture, as well as the Michael Braude Award for Light Verse. Among his other nonfiction work, he wrote theatre and opera criticism for The New York Times, The Nation, and other periodicals. He also published several volumes of poetry as Tom Disch. Following an extended period of depression following the death in 2005 of his life-partner, Charles Naylor, Disch stopped writing almost entirely, except for poetry – although he did produce two novellas. Disch committed suicide by gunshot on July 4 2008 in his apartment in Manhattan, New York City. His last book, The Word of God, which was written shortly before Naylor died, had just been published a few days before Disch's death.)\n\nThe Best Poem Of Thomas Michael Disch\n\nOde to a Blizzard\n\nO! wonderful for weight and whiteness!\n\nIdeolog whose absolutes\n\nAre always proven right\n\nBy white and then\n\nMore white and white again,\n\nWinning the same argument year\n\nAfter year by making the opposition\n\nDisappear!\n\nO! dear miniature of infinity with no\n\nEnd in sight and no snow-\n\nFlake exactly like\n\nAnother, all\n\nA little different no\n\nMatter how many may fall,\n\nJust like our own DNA or the human face\n\nEternal!\n\nO! still keep covering the street\n\nAnd sidewalks, cemeteries, even\n\nOur twice-shoveled drive,\n\nAnd all that is alive,\n\nWith geometries that sleet\n\nWill freeze into Death's\n\nImpromptu vision of a heaven\n\nWholly white!\n\nFor we know who your sponsor is, whose will\n\nYou so immensely serve,\n\nWhose chill is more severe\n\nThan any here.\n\nThough his name may be unspoken,\n\nHis commandments are unbroken,\n\nAnd every monument that you erect\n\nBelongs to him!"
