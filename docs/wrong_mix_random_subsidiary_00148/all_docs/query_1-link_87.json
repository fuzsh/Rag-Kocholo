        "text": "Thomas M. Disch’s “The Roaches” is a darkly humorous tale that reminds me of the movie Willard. The story is about Marcia Kenwell, who has recently arrived in New York to seek out a new job, but unfortunately has to settle for a series of dead end jobs while living in a cockroach-infested apartment. Marcia has an intense phobia of roaches, but also shares a psychic bond with the creatures and is able to command them to do her bidding.\n\nDisch’s plain and simple use of language is effective in drawing the reader into the low-rent apartments of New York, where all sorts of nasty bugs lurk between the cracks and at the back of a dark cabinet. Marcia is painted as a very flawed person, whose focus on cleanliness seems to alienate her from others. She dismisses her neighbors as loud and filthy – more or less as human cockroaches.\n\nThe ending is ambiguous, but it’s implied that Marcia’s power has caused her to descend into insanity. I recommend checking this one out.\n\n— Mike Malan, Blogger"
