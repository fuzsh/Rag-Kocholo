        "text": "By Tom Downey, Chat Sports\n\nThe 2015–16 NBA season is fully underway. Every team has played at least one game, and the schedule continues on Thursday with the Memphis Grizzlies, Indiana Pacers, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Clippers, Atlanta Hawks and New York Knicks.\n\nCheck out the latest NBA news and rumors below.\n\n• Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose is still battling blurred vision, reports ESPN. Rose sustained a fracture to his left orbital bone during the preseason, and said he often plays with only one eye open because of the injury.\n\n• Clippers point guard Chris Paul told the Orange County Register that he wants to finish his career with Los Angeles.\n\n• Golden State Warriors center Andrew Bogut sustained a concussion in the team’s season-opening win, reports CSN Bay Area. Bogut won’t be cleared to play until his concussion symptoms stop.\n\n• The NBA will place a Kia logo on the front of All-Star jerseys in 2016 and 2017, reports The Wall Street Journal. The marketing trial could result in another revenue stream for professional sports leagues.\n\n• Chat Sports: Lakers full season preview\n\n• Washington Wizards forward Martell Webster has a partially torn labrum in his hip, according to CSN Mid-Atlantic. Webster might need surgery, but is holding out hope he can avoid it. In an attempt to avoid putting excess stress on his hip, Webster is using prescription eyewear to help keep him balanced.\n\n• New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony was impressed by rookie Kristaps Porzingis’s debut. “You couldn’t ask for more than that,” Anthony told ESPN following Porzingis’s 16-point, five-rebound performance in his first NBA game.\n\n• The Utah Jazzstarted rookie Raul Neto over Trey Burke at point guard in the season opener. Burke was a lottery pick in 2013, while Neto was a late second round selection that same season.\n\n• Kobe Bryant is now in the midst of his 20th season with the Los Angeles Lakers, which is an NBA record. No one has played for as many seasons with the same team as Bryant, according to ESPN."
