If anything the whole league needs a downgrade so certain players stand out more.\n\nAlso to OP\n\nIf it goes like this\n\n95-HOF\n\n90-MVP\n\n85-Perrenial Allstar\n\n80-Borderline Allstar\n\n75-Good Starter/Sixth man\n\n70- Good Role player\n\n65-68-Decent Role Player\n\n50-60-Bench Warmer\n\netc\n\nThen why would MARTELL WEBSTER need to be rated as a borderline allstar?!\n\nAnd yeah like other have said Beal doesn't need to be rated any higher. 75 is very good for a rookie.\n\n****I do agree Vucevic and Harris are playing well and could get SLIGHTLY rated higher\n\nStreaky McFloorburn and tyklug2013 like this.\n\nLast edited by Melbournelad; 03-29-2013 at 10:12 PM.\n\nPro\n\nOVR: 8\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2012\n\nBlog Entries: 1\n\nRe: JOHN WALL, MARTELL WEBSTER, BRADLEY BEAL AND NENE\n\nDoes no one get that overalls just don't matter? I mean, how is this not common knowledge by now?\n\nBesides, talk to me when the Wizards get their win column within 20 of their loss column to end a season and John Wall averages more than 7.5 assists per game with 3.5 TOs a game (that's a whole TO per game higher than the best passers), then we'll talk about a passing upgrade.\n\nBertmanT5 and tyklug2013 like this.\n\n__________________\n\n\"The designated hitter rule is like letting someone else take Wilt Chamberlain's free throws.\"\n\n- Rick Wise"
