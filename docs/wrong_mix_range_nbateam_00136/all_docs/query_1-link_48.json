        "text": "American basketball player (1952–2009)\n\nNot to be confused with Martell Webster.\n\nMarvin Nathaniel Webster (April 13, 1952 – April 4, 2009) was an American professional basketball player. He played one season in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and nine in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Denver Nuggets (1975–77), Seattle SuperSonics (1977–78), New York Knickerbockers (1978–84) and Milwaukee Bucks (1986–87). His nickname was The Human Eraser because of his impressive shot blocking talent.[1]\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of a Baltimore preacher, Webster attended Edmondson High School in the city.[2] A four-year basketball letterman at Morgan State University, he earned the nickname \"The Human Eraser\" as a junior when he averaged eight blocked shots a game while helping the Bears capture the 1974 NCAA Division II Championship. He averaged 21 points and 22.4 rebounds and was named Division II player of the year.[3]\n\nWebster still holds eight career school records: 1,990 points, 2,267 rebounds, 19.5 rebounds per game, 785 field goals made, 424 free throws made, 644 free throws attempted, 722 blocks and 110 games started.[4] His 740 rebounds in 1974 and 2,267 career total are still second all-time in NCAA history in their respective categories.[5] He was named to the NCAA Division II Men's Basketball 50th Anniversary All-Elite Eight Team in 2006.[6]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1971–72 Morgan State 26 - - .453 - .687 16.1 - - - 13.2 1972–73 Morgan State 28 - - .514 - .686 23.2 - - - 18.5 1973–74 Morgan State 33 - - .545 - .697 22.4 - - - 21.4 1974–75 Morgan State 27 - - .562 - .490 17.0 - - - 15.7 Career 114 - - .524 - .658 19.9 - - - 17.5\n\nWebster was selected in the first round of both the NBA and ABA Drafts in 1975 (third overall by the Atlanta Hawks, first overall by the Denver Nuggets, respectively). After signing with the Nuggets, he was diagnosed with a form of hepatitis, and played only 38 games as a rookie in 1975–76.[7]\n\nA 7' 1\" center, Webster helped the Nuggets reach the 1976 ABA Finals and win the 1976-77 NBA Midwest Division championship as a backup to Dan Issel. Before the 1977-78 season, the Nuggets traded Webster, Paul Silas, and Willie Wise to the Seattle SuperSonics for Tom Burleson, Bobby Wilkerson and a first-round draft pick. With Webster as the starting center, rookie Jack Sikma, Gus Williams, and Dennis Johnson, the SuperSonics won the 1977-78 NBA Western Conference championship and reached the 1978 NBA Finals. His finest season was his single year with Seattle, in which he averaged 14.0 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks per game.[8] He raised his performance in the SuperSonics’ 22-game playoff run that year, averaging 16.1 points, 13.1 rebounds, and more than 2.6 blocks per game.[8] Webster still holds the SuperSonics' record for rebounds in one half with 21.[9]\n\nIn 1978, the Knicks signed Webster as a free-agent. As compensation, the NBA awarded the SuperSonics the playing rights to power-forward Lonnie Shelton and the Knicks’ 1979 first-round draft pick.[10] In his first season with the Knicks, Webster averaged 11.3 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game. Webster never again reached double figures in either category in the NBA after that.[8] Webster missed the 1984–85 and start of the 1985–86 season with hepatitis before retiring from the Knicks.[3]\n\nWebster played briefly in the Continental Basketball Association, and later with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 1986–87 season.[3]\n\nWebster was found dead in a Tulsa, Oklahoma hotel room on April 4, 2009.[11] He was 56 years old. It is believed that he died of a coronary artery disease.[3]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1975–76 Denver 38 - 10.5 .458 .000 .705 4.6 0.8 0.2 1.4 4.3 Career 38 - 10.5 .458 .000 .705 4.6 0.8 0.2 1.4 4.3\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1975–76 Denver 13* - 11.9 .420 .000 .536 5.5 0.7 0.1 1.1 4.4 Career 13 - 11.9 .420 .000 .536 5.5 0.7 0.1 1.1 4.4\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1976–77 Denver 80 - 16.0 .495 - .650 6.1 0.8 0.3 1.5 6.7 1977–78 Seattle 82 - 35.5 .502 - .629 12.6 2.5 0.6 2.0 14.0 1978–79 New York 60 - 33.8 .473 - .573 10.9 2.9 0.4 1.9 11.3 1979–80 New York 20 - 14.9 .481 .000 .750 4.0 0.5 0.2 0.6 4.4 1980–81 New York 82 - 20.8 .466 .250 .638 5.7 0.9 0.3 1.2 5.2 1981–82 New York 82 32 23.0 .491 .000 .635 6.0 1.2 0.3 1.1 6.2 1982–83 New York 82 0 18.0 .508 .000 .589 5.4 0.6 0.4 1.6 5.4 1983–84 New York 76 5 17.0 .469 .000 .564 4.8 0.7 0.4 1.3 3.8 1986–87 Milwaukee 15 0 6.8 .526 1.000 .750 1.7 0.2 0.2 0.5 1.8 Career 579 37 22.4 .489 .333 .617 7.0 1.2 0.4 1.4 7.1\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1976–77 Denver 6 - 16.0 .500 - .667 6.7 0.5 0.3 1.8 5.0 1977–78 Seattle 22* - 41.1 .489 - .675 13.1 2.6 0.3 2.6 16.1 1980–81 New York 2 - 31.5 .500 .000 .000 5.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 6.0 1982–83 New York 6 - 19.2 .389 .000 .636 4.7 0.5 0.0 1.2 4.7 1983–84 New York 12 - 17.0 .483 .000 .600 4.7 0.3 0.3 1.4 3.1 Career 48 - 28.8 .485 .000 .647 8.8 1.4 0.3 2.0 9.6\n\nWebster was married to Mederia Webster.[12] Webster's son, Marvin Webster Jr., was recruited to play basketball at Temple University, but died at age 19 from a heart attack prior to his sophomore season.[13]\n\nLater in his life, Webster lived in Metuchen, New Jersey.[14]\n\nWebster is one of five 1970s Seattle SuperSonics players whose names are featured on characters in \"The Exterminator,\" the third episode of Season 1 of iZombie. The other four are Freddie Brown, Gus Williams, Wally Walker and Don Watts.[15]"
