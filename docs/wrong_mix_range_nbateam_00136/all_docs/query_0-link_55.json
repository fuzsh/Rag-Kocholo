        "text": "SAN ANTONIO - Tim Duncan had 30 points and 12 rebounds, Kawhi Leonard added 24 points and 13 boards, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-113 on Saturday night.\n\nManu Ginobili added 14 points and 10 assists, Nando De Colo had 11 points and Tiago Splitter had 10 for San Antonio (51-16), which is 1Â½ games ahead of Oklahoma City in the Western Conference.\n\nWayne Ellington had 21 points and fellow reserve Marreese Speights added 19 for Cleveland (22-44). Shaun Livingston had 16 points, and Alonzo Gee and Dion Waiters added 15 apiece.\n\nNeither offense was slowed by the loss of its starting All-Star point guards. The Spurs' Tony Parker is expected to miss another two weeks with a Grade 2 left ankle sprain and Cleveland will be without Kyrie Irving (shoulder) for another three weeks.\n\nIt was defense that both teams were lacking.\n\nOpponents were averaging 96.2 points against the Spurs entering Saturday's game, but the Cavaliers had 90 entering the fourth.\n\nFrustration with that defense may have led to Gregg Popovich's ejection. The Spurs coach was ejected with 6:33 left in the first half after arguing a charge Ed Malloy called on Boris Diaw. After the initial technical, Popovich was quickly assessed a second and ejected after storming onto the court, yelling and pointing at Malloy.\n\nSan Antonio outscored Cleveland 19-12 down the stretch, but the Cavs shot 51 percent from the field.\n\nDuncan had 13 points in the first quarter, going 6 for 9 and collecting six rebounds.\n\nHe tossed in a 2-foot jumper that gave the Spurs a 30-21 lead with 3 minutes left in the first quarter. Leonard picked up an assist on the basket, hustling in from out of bounds to tip his own missed shot to Duncan.\n\nWaiters' 3 with 7 minutes left in the first half capped a 13-5 run that gave the Cavaliers a 48-44 lead.\n\nAfter CJ Miles made both free throws on Popovich's technicals, the Spurs closed the first half on a 22-11 run to take a 66-61 lead. Ginobili had eight points in the run and Duncan added seven.\n\nCleveland shot 61 percent from the field in the first half.\n\nThe Spurs never trailed in the third quarter, but Livingston's layup with 1:20 left tied the game at 90 to set up the fourth quarter.\n\n¦ Wizards 127, Suns 105\n\nWASHINGTON - Martell Webster scored a career-high 34 points and became the Washington Wizards' first 30-point scorer this season in a victory over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nJohn Wall added 17 points and 11 assists as Washington won its fourth straight at home and third straight overall while setting its season high in scoring.\n\nEmeka Okafor added 17 points and 10 rebounds as Washington snapped a 10-game losing streak to Phoenix, dating to 2006.\n\nMichael Beasley scored 21 points and Goran Dragic added 12 points and 11 assists as the Suns lost their fourth straight and their sixth of eight in March.\n\n¦ Celtics 105, Bobcats 88\n\nBOSTON - Paul Pierce had 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds before sitting out the fourth quarter, and the Boston Celtics won their 11th straight at home, beating the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nAvery Bradley scored 13 and Courtney Lee had 12 points and five assists as the Celtics beat the Bobcats for the first time in three meetings this season. Two of the Bobcats' NBA-low 14 wins came against the Celtics, including a 100-74 blowout in Charlotte on Tuesday.\n\nKevin Garnett sat out with a strained left thigh muscle, but the Celtics had more than enough to overwhelm the Bobcats this time.\n\nJeff Green and Brandon Bass scored 10 apiece as all five starters were in double figures.\n\n¦ 76ers 98, Pacers 91\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Spencer Hawes had 18 points and career highs with 16 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to victory over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nJrue Holiday added 27 points and 12 assists to help the Sixers win for only the third time in 15 games. While the Sixers are one of the worst road teams in the league, they are 19-17 at home."
