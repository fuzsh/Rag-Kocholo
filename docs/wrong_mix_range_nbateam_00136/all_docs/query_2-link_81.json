        "text": "Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait said Tuesday night that the city was getting “closer” to striking a deal to get the NBA’s Sacramento Kings to relocate to Anaheim. We love the idea of a National Basketball Association team in Orange County, but if it is done, it must be done without taxpayer dollars. Fortunately, Mr. Tait agrees – on the record.\n\nAs we have editorialized before, the owners of the Sacramento Kings reportedly have been in talks about moving their NBA franchise from the state capital to Orange County. We welcome the idea of a Kings’ proposal to move to Orange County. If the owners were to do so, they would be welcomed by a vibrant fan base very fond of our sports teams.\n\nWe support the move, however, with one caveat: No taxpayer subsidies to get the team here. No taxpayer-financed sports arenas. No special bonds to pay for renovations to the Honda Center, where the team presumably would play.\n\nDuring the Anaheim City Council meeting Tuesday night, Mr. Tait addressed our concerns directly: “We have all seen the speculation in the media, but I want to assure everyone that, should a deal go forward, the city taxpayers and the city’s general fund will not be put at risk in any way.”\n\nHis remarks are a good sign. He went on to state that “my colleagues on the City Council and city staff share my concern that the taxpayers cannot be exposed to any risk with this potential new deal.”\n\nHow will the project be funded? According to Mr. Tait, “A financing structure is being proposed that would allow for private investment to fund improvements at Honda Center.” This also sounds promising, though, the devil usually tends to be in the details. We will continue to monitor, encouraging but also eager to ensure that taxpayers are not on the hook.\n\nIt is only fitting that Orange County get a professional basketball team. After all, one of the original purposes of the Honda Center, built for $123 million in 1993, was to house an NBA team. With this new deal it looks as though that dream may come to fruition but let’s ensure that it is done without any taxpayer exposure.\n\nThe Kings moved from Kansas City, Mo., to Sacramento in 1985. The franchise moved to Missouri from Cincinnati, Ohio, where since 1957 it was called the Royals. If the team shifts to Anaheim, perhaps we can consider a name more aligned with quintessential Orange County. The Anaheim Ducks hockey team were originally the Mighty Ducks to honor a film from the team’s original owner, the Walt Disney Co. So, how about the Anaheim Dukes to tip the hat to an iconic, and local, movie star?"
