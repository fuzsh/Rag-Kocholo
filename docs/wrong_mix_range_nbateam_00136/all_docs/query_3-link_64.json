        "text": "Martell Webster has announced that he is retiring after 10 years in the NBA.\n\nWebster was drafted sixth overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in 2005. During his career, he played in Portland, Minnesota and Washington.\n\nWebster hasn’t been on an NBA roster since the 2014-15 season with the Wizards, when he suffered a season-ending hip injury.\n\nWebster was on the Pelicans’ training camp roster this summer, but obviously won’t be with the team for the regular season.\n\nHe would have been a welcome addition for a Pelicans team that severely lacks depth on the wing.\n\nWebster, 6-foot-7, compiled career averages of 8.7 points and 3.3 rebounds per game on 41.8 percent shooting from the field.\n\nHis best season came as a starter for the Wizards in 2012-13 when he started 62 games for the Wizards, averaging career-best marks in points per game (11.4), rebounds per game (3.9) and 3-point percentage (42.2).\n\nWebster declared for the NBA Draft out of high school. In high school, he was a McDonald’s All-American."
