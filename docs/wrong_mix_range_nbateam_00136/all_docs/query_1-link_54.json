There went perhaps the lead and possibly even the game.\n\nOnly, Webster didn’t pull up for a three-pointer.\n\nInstead, he coasted in for the dunk.\n\n“When I saw him pass the three-point line, I just said, ‘Thank you,’ ” Stone said. “That’s all I was thinking – go lay it up.”\n\nThe Nuggets threw the ball in and Corey Brewer was fouled, hitting 1 of 2 free throws with 0.5 seconds left and sealing the win.\n\nTimberwolves coach Rick Adelman was befuddled at Webster’s decision.\n\n“Maybe emotions got the best of him,” he said.\n\nWebster’s thought process was simple: He thought he could get fouled on his way to the hoop.\n\n“If I had to do it over again, yeah, I’d probably pull up for a jump shot,” Webster said. “But what was going through my mind was go to the rim and possibly get fouled. The contingency to that shot was get a bucket, get a foul, they miss free throws, and we get another shot. It didn’t work out that way.”\n\nKevin Love had 22 points and 13 rebounds for Minnesota, which had its three-game winning streak snapped.\n\nThe Timberwolves weren’t at full strength; center Darko Milicic didn’t make the trip due to a stomach ailment. Milicic just recently returned to the lineup after missing a few games with a sprained right ankle.\n\nThey also lost another center when Nikola Pekovic left with a sprained right ankle. He had seven points and seven rebounds in 15 minutes.\n\nHarrington came up big all night, tying the score 93-93 on a three-pointer from the corner with 1:39 remaining in regulation.\n\nLike Afflalo, he craves the ball at crunch time.\n\n“Me and Arron needed to be more aggressive, earn our pay tonight,” Harrington said. “Usually, we’re laid back and let the game come to us. We forced the issue.”\n\nThe Nuggets lost their cool and control of the game late in the third quarter.\n\nLeading 76-69, Miller became irate over an offensive foul and kept barking at the officials, eventually leading to his ejection. The Timberwolves took advantage, using an 11-2 run to take the lead.\n\n“There was no question it put extra pressure on our team, but we passed the test,” coach George Karl said.\n\nWith flying colors.\n\nThe banged-up Nuggets were without Danilo Gallinari (left ankle), Nene (left calf strain) and Rudy Fernandez (lower back strain). They also lost Lawson to a sprained left ankle in the second quarter. His status is day-to-day.\n\nKarl is hoping to keep the team afloat and not lose ground in the playoff race until he gets all his pieces back. Nene might return later this week and Gallinari could be back on the court soon after the All-Star break.\n\nThe possible addition of former Nuggets forward Wilson Chandler might just help. He watched the game Monday night from a suite with team executive Masai Ujiri sitting by his side.\n\nChandler’s in town as he looks at potential landing places for when his time in China is finished. He signed with Zhejiang Guangsha of the Chinese Basketball Association during the lockout and is ineligible to return until his team signs off and FIBA, basketball’s governing body, gives him clearance.\n\nWatching his former team play made him all the more anxious to be back in an NBA uniform.\n\n“Hopefully we get something done,” said Chandler, who sat at Miller’s locker after the game as he chatted with teammates. “Watching (the NBA) on TV and coming to the game today, it makes you miss it.”\n\nOriginally Published: February 20, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
