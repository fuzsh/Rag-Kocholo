        "text": "In the summer of 2015, no team did a better job modernizing their roster than the Washington Wizards. They beefed up the wing, added three-point shooters and turned themselves into a versatile, switch-happy unit that should be capable of playing any style next season.\n\nLost in the shuffle is Martell Webster, who signed a four-year, $22 million deal in 2013. The 6'7\" forward was brought in for his outside shot, and knocked down threes at a respectable clip in the first two years of that contract.\n\nBut Webster struggled to stay healthy last season, and was a total non-factor. According to CSN Mid-Atlantic's J. Michael, Webster could be a stretch four this season if his surgically-repaired back allows him to stay on the court:\n\n\"A person with knowledge of the situation told CSNmidatlantic.com in June that Webster had already dropped about 15 pounds. While that sounds good, it'll all come down to his ability to make shots and improving other numbers. His 23.3% accuracy from three-point range, a career low, last season isn't going to cut it. Webster has to get out of the gate quickly, and avoid re-injury when training camp starts next month, to prove to coach Randy Wittman he indeed can be a stretch-four option.\"\n\nIt's a crowded field now, with Jared Dudley and Otto Porter presumably sharing Washington's power forward minutes whenever Randy Wittman goes small.\n\nBut if Webster can consistently knock down threes and play a little defense while Dudley is easing himself back from surgery, there's a decent chance he can earn Wittman's trust and find a spot in the rotation.\n\n(h/t: CSN Mid-Atlantic)"
