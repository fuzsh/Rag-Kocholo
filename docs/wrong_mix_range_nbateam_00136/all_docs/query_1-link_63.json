        "text": "Martell Webster knows his NBA career won’t last forever – which is why he’s able to put his most recent setback in perspective.\n\nOn Wednesday, his current team, the Washington Wizards, announced that the former prep-to-pro standout would undergo season-ending hip surgery, bringing his 2015-16 campaign to a close – before he even logged a minute of game action. The 28-year-old Webster had been attempting to play through a partially torn labrum in his right hip, though he sat out all of the preseason and had yet to get into a regular season contest. But he’s never been one to focus on the present – he’s always been thinking about what happens once his playing days are done.\n\n“It’s not very long you get to play this game; it’s blink,” Webster says. “I’m looking forward to living for another 60 years after this. I don’t plan to be remembered for what I did in a glitch of my life. I plan to be remembered by the people I touch and that I effect.”\n\nHe hopes to accomplish that though music. Webster, long a fan of hip-hop, says he’s been working on his own tracks for a few years – though it was only recently that he decided it was time to go public with his private passion.\n\n“The hesitation was worrying about what people were going to think. And then I finally got to a place where it was like, ‘I don’t care what people think about it. It’s mine. I made it. I’m so proud of it,'” he says. “I’m making my music based on how I feel, not following a trend.”\n\nTrending\n\nWebster’s music is both soulful and spiteful, celebrating his successes and answering his critics. After a ten-year career in the NBA, he’s had plenty of experience with both. Now, it’s about bringing people together.\n\n“Basketball is like a gladiator sport. People cussing at you, all this crazy stuff…you want nothing to do with the crowd,” he says. “But with music, it’s like ‘No, this is us.‘ I need to talk to everybody. That’s fun to me. I love it.”"
