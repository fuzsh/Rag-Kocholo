        "text": "Martell Webster has reportedly agreed to a deal with the Washington Wizards. Webster, the former Minnesota Timberwolves forward, worked out for the Wizards this week and reportedly had Washington near the top of the list of teams he was considering signing with.\n\nWebster, 25, has been slowed down during his career by back injuries. He missed 19 games last year for Minnesota and missed the entire 2008-2009 season with injury. Webster has averaged 8.4 points and 3.2 rebounds in 23.4 minutes per game for his career. He's a 37.4 percent shooter from behind the arc for his career, but only shot 33.9 percent last season.\n\nWebster was the No. 6 pick in the 2005 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. Webster played for Portland from 2006-2010 before being traded to the Timberwolves. He was waived by Minnesota in July."
