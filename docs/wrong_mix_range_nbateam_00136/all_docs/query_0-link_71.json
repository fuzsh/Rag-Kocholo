        "text": "Anderson Varejao, Tristan Thompson, Martell Webster\n\nWith plenty of new frontcourt players joining Anderson Varejao (left) and Tristan Thompson, where are the Cavaliers going to find playing time for all of them?\n\n(AP file)\n\nHey, Mary: Why are the Cavs trying to sign another power forward? We already have Andy, TT, Bennett, Jones and now Earl Clark. I get they use Andy as a center, but he is really a PF and it seems his body can't take playing center. Is one going to be traded? Or do they plan on using Bennett or Clark at the 3? -- Paul Talbott, Massillon\n\nHey, Paul: You're far from the only person with a variation on this topic. It will all work itself out, especially with the imminent signing of Andrew Bynum. I think Clark will play some small forward and, although they have insisted Bennett is a power forward, I think he'll play some small forward, too. I guess it's still possible Varejao could be traded, but I don't see that happening until they see what Bynum can do.\n\nHey, Mary: With their current teams looking toward the lottery and their mixture of youth and relative affordability, any chance either Gerald Wallace or Rudy Gay play for the Cavs next year? -- Kevin Turman, Detroit\n\nHey, Kevin: As the recent moves have used up almost all of the salary cap, there's no chance either of those players is coming here.\n\nHey, Mary: How much money can we spend this year to have enough money for a max contract next year? I think by adding a couple pieces this year we can make the playoffs. Then bring you know who next year and be a title contender. -- Matt Heinz, Norton\n\nHey, Matt: Don't worry. It's not like Chris Grant is going to forget what could happen next summer. Virtually every contract on the books is a team option next season.\n\nHey, Mary: I'm hoping the Cavs can take advantage of teams grasping at pipe dreams, teams trying to position themselves for Howard, James and other big-name free agents (and) next year's draft. Perhaps we can land an all-star-type player in a trade. I think its foolish to wait for James to come back. He's not. -- Joe, Poland, Ohio\n\nHey, Joe: No one knows. I doubt he has made up his mind at this point. But I have been told it is not out of the question.\n\nHey, Mary: The LeBron back to Cleveland is too good of a storyline not to happen, so my question is this: When he comes back, does he wear No. 6 or does he go back to No. 23? I mean, he may have to duke it out with Earl Clark for No. 6. -- Chad Jordan, Los Angeles\n\nHey, Chad: Now that's funny. Since he's all about the brand, my guess is he'd pick a whole new number so he could sell all those new jerseys.\n\nHey, Mary: How interested are the Cavs in acquiring Danny Granger? I believe he would solve a lot of problems at small forward. -- Jason Smith, Louisville, Ohio\n\nHey, Jason: I have never sensed much interest in Granger from the Cavs. Perhaps one reason is that the Pacers got to the conference finals without him.\n\nHey, Mary: Is it just me or does Anthony Bennett reminds you of J.J. Hickson with a jump shot? -- Chris Taylor, Columbus\n\nHey, Chris: Hmmmm, I hadn't thought of that. Hickson was so raw when he came into the league. Bennett is much more polished offensively and is supposed to have a much better motor, as they say.\n\nHey, Mary: Cleveland is always out of the running for signing impact free agents. It's fun to guess which players might sign but, ultimately, isn't it the starters who will determine whatever success the Cavs might have this season? -- Marty Curry, Applegate\n\nHey, Marty: I'm guessing you sent in your question before the recent free-agent signings. You make a good point, but the key is to have competent backups so if a starter gets hurt, like Danny Granger, the team's chances don't go out the window.\n\nHey, Mary: Why not keep Allen Crabbe? First-round talent, great shooter. They should realize they can take four rookies. No way are they not a lottery team for a year or two. -- James Crandell, Avon Lake\n\nHey, James: They got two second-round picks they apparently thought were more valuable. They are not planning to return to the lottery next season.\n\nHey, Mary: Any chance Bennett starts over Thompson this year? -- Lucas Stacy, Hilliard, Ohio\n\nHey, Lucas: I don't see that.\n\nHey, Mary: Please tell me the Cavs are not being more aggressive pursuing top tier free agents this year because they are trying to preserve cap space in hopes of trying to sign that bum Lequit next summer. No self respecting Clevelander, including the Cavs' organization, should want anything to do with that quitter ever again. -- Dan Kapalin, Tampa\n\nHey, Dan: Dan Gilbert is a businessman, first and foremost. If the best player in the NBA wants to come back to Cleveland, he'd be crazy not to try to make that happen to increase the value of his franchise and its chances for success.\n\nHey, Mary: I was discussing a few potential trades while getting a manicure with the girls and was wondering if the Cavs offered the Warriors Andy Varejao and a second-round pick for Harrison Barnes, would that be of interest to either side? -- Leslie Gorta, Sagamore Hills\n\nHey, Leslie: Hope you didn't smudge your nails typing that! I think that's too much for Barnes. I think if the Cavs wanted him, they would have drafted him last year. Obviously, he had a great rookie season and would fill a need at small forward. But I don't sense them going in that direction. Also, I don't think the Warriors would let him go. They've got David Lee, so they don't need Varejao.\n\nHey, Mary: I'm not sure why some want to push Alonzo Gee to the side. He is the only one on the roster that can guard the best small forwards in the East. He has a great work ethic and has improved each year. Be careful what you wish for. -- Joe Ceresa, Erie, Pa.\n\nHey, Joe: Gee actually played his best defense against opposing point guards. Earl Clark is a better defender of front-court players. I think much of the angst over Gee is the fact that he averaged 10 points, pretty low for a starting small forward. Ideally, he's a role player coming off the bench, although as you point out, he is a good athlete with a great work ethic. He has done everything the Cavs have asked. The question is whether he has reached his ceiling.\n\nHey, Mary: I think Tyler Zeller has the potential to become the next Big Z. He needs to add some muscle, yes, but his mid-range jumper reminds me of Big Z and he seems to know what he is doing when he doesn't have the ball in his hands. Am I crazy to think that Zeller could be a legit starting center? -- Nathanael Ressler, Mount Vernon, Ill.\n\nHey, Nathanael: I see a long NBA career for Zeller because of his fundamentals and basketball IQ. I'm going to have to wait and see how much strength he can add before I'm ready to declare him a starter or bench player.\n\nHey, Mary: If Anthony Bennett pans out and TT continues his ascent, do the Cavs see them as the starting PF-C combo of the future? -- Jack Bacevice, Cleveland\n\nHey, Jack: I'd say more likely PF-SF.\n\nHey, Mary: In Florida many years ago the high schools in that state required all football players to wear a knee brace to prevent knee injuries. The brace worked and saved so many kids from serious knee injuries. I mention this because we have now signed Andrew Bynum, a player with a history of knee problems. Should the Cavs require Bynum to wear a brace to protect their investment? -- Rich Ragnanese, Dumagete, Philippines\n\nHey, Rich: I don't think the Cavs can require him to wear a knee brace. If the medical staff believes it's in his best interest, then they can suggest it and strongly urge him to do so. But, typically, the player ultimately has to decide.\n\nPlayers often complain about the bulkiness of such braces. Same thing with the face masks. You'll often see a player take the mask off during a game and throw it to the bench because it's uncomfortable. Then the trainer and/or medical staff persuade him that it's in his best interests to put it back on. In this unusual instance, I suppose it's possible there could be something in Bynum's contract and/or an insurance policy, but I don't know that that's the case.\n\nHey, Mary: What role will Bennett, Karasev and Felix have with the Cavs? -- Daniel Alloza, Zaragoza, Spain\n\nHey, Daniel: Right now, I'd say all three are projected as role players who will come off the bench.\n\nHey, Mary: Do you believe the Cavaliers should have gone for Pekovic or Asik before Bynum? I would love to see a possible Kyrie/LeBron duo in 2014, but I feel as though we needed to make a better move at the center position. -- Shelton Wiltz, Port Arthur, Texas\n\nHey, Shelton: The advantage to Bynum is that it's a virtually risk-free move. If he's anything like he was, then he's way better than Pekovic or Asik. If he's not, he comes off the books. That wouldn't be the case with either of the other two heading into 2014.\n\nHey, Mary: With Andrew Bynum now on board, how long will the Cavs hold on to Anderson Varejao before trying to flip him for a sharpshooting SF/SG? Please tell me they wait to see Bynum make it into a regular season game before they pull the trigger on something. -- Ron, Fort Bliss, Texas\n\nHey, Ron: I do think the Cavs will wait to make any more moves until they see what Bynum can do.\n\nHey, Mary: Are the Cavs done in free agency? One more player? Maybe depth at SG/SF? Any cap space left? Is this team good enough? -- Alan Martin, Indian Rocks Beach, Fla.\n\nHey, Alan: The Cavs probably are done in free agency, though they still have a $2.6 million exception left. It's possible they could trade someone like Varejao for a veteran small forward, which remains a question mark. Whether they're good enough likely depends on whether Bynum can play and whether Varejao and/or Irving can stay healthy.\n\nHey, Mary: Assuming a healthy and happy Andrew Bynum plays next year, this team is primed to improve dramatically. How many wins does he add and are they a team ready to make some noise in the East? -- Gino Scipione, Lyndhurst\n\nHey, Gino: That's a big assumption, but let's say it happens. Given the other changes and the progress of the youngsters, I think it's entirely possible the Cavs could be 20 games better, which would get them over .500 for the first time in four years. That should get them in the playoffs.\n\nTraditionally, though, it takes more than one year for a team to grow together enough to make the kind of \"noise\" I think you mean.\n\nHey, Mary: Would you please clear something up for me? How many players do NBA teams keep -- 12 or 15? Is it like the NFL, 53 players on the roster but 47 dress on game days? -- Will Saunders, Pittsburgh\n\nHey, Will: The NBA roster maximum is 15, but only 12 players can be active for any given game.\n\nHey, Mary: If the Cavs sign Bynum, how will the starting lineup look? -- Damion Taylor, Cleveland\n\nHey, Damion: If he can play -- and that's a big if right now -- I think they'd start Bynum, Thompson, Clark, Waiters and Irving.\n\nHey, Mary: What draft choices do the Cavs have next year and 2015? -- Bill Cooke, The Villages, Fla.\n\nHey, Bill: In 2014, the Cavs have their own first-round pick, plus Sacramento's pick (top 12 protected). They have their own second-round pick, Memphis' second-round pick and Orlando's second-round pick.\n\nIn 2015, the Cavs have their own first-round pick, plus Sacramento's pick if not already used (top 10 protected). The Cavs also have Memphis’ first-round pick, protected 1-5 and 15-30. The Cavs have their own second-round pick and one (of two) from Portland in the deal for Allen Crabbe.\n\nHey, Mary: Tyler Zeller and Dion will be playing in both the summer league and the Olympic practice squad. Will those two interfere with each other? -- Anthony T., Cleveland"
