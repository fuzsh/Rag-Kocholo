        "text": "LeBron James came back – as a reserve – and the Cavaliers, sparked by their superstar’s return, snapped a six-game losing streak with a 118-105 win over the Indiana Pacers last night in Cleveland.\n\nJames, the NBA’s leading scorer, had missed Cleveland’s previous five games with what the Cavs have described as a sprained left index finger. Wearing a padded, protective glove on his hand, James scored 17 points in 22 minutes as the finally-getting-healthy Cavs had one of their finest performances this season.\n\nThe Cavs set season highs in points and field goal percentage (55).\n\nLarry Hughes also came off the bench and scored a season-high 36 points – in just 26 minutes. It was his second game back after missing 11 with a bruised leg. Zydrunas Ilgauskas added 17 for Cleveland.\n\nMike Dunleavy scored 23 points and Jermaine O’Neal had 18 for the Pacers. Indiana guard Jamaal Tinsley, who was shot at with an assault weapon in front of a downtown Indianapolis hotel over the weekend, scored 10.\n\nJames was expected to play, and it was assumed he would start.\n\nHowever, the game began with Cleveland’s megastar on the bench in his white-and-wine warmups. It was the first time he had not started in 333 career regular-season games as a pro, and it may have been one of the only times in his life that he wasn’t on the court for the opening tip.\n\nRaptors 100, Hawks 88 – T.J. Ford scored 26 points before he was sent crashing to the floor with an apparent injury on a flagrant foul late in the game, casting a pall over Toronto’s victory in Atlanta.\n\nFord, who missed the 2004-05 season following neck surgery, was headed toward a breakaway basket when Atlanta rookie Al Horford hit the guard’s face with his hand. Ford landed hard, his head bouncing off the floor.\n\nFord was conscious but did not appear to move before he was strapped to a stretcher and wheeled off the court.\n\nHorford was ejected with the flagrant foul.\n\nPistons 113, Grizzlies 103 – Chauncey Billups had 28 points and 14 assists, while Richard Hamilton scored 27 points as visiting Detroit beat Memphis.\n\nTayshaun Prince scored 19 points and Jason Maxiel finished with 15 points, missing only one of eight shots from the field as the Pistons won their seventh game in the last eight.\n\nBulls 123, SuperSonics 96 – Ben Gordon scored 27 points, Luol Deng added 20, and host Chicago scored its most lopsided victory of the season by pounding Seattle.\n\nIt was the fifth win in seven games for the Bulls, who were coming off a 92-81 loss to the Celtics.\n\nWizards 102, Timberwolves 88 – Washington is down to nine healthy players, so it’s a good thing six scored in double figures in a win over visiting Minnnesota. Antawn Jamison led the way with 22 points and 13 rebounds, while Caron Butler added 20 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBrendan Haywood had 11 points and 14 rebounds, and reserve guard Roger Mason Jr. scored 17 points, as the Wizards improved to 8-5 without star point guard Gilbert Arenas.\n\nClippers 91, Nets 82 – Chris Kaman and Tim Thomas both scored 18 points to lead Los Angeles to its first win in New Jersey in nearly 10 years.\n\nRichard Jefferson led the Nets with 21 points but was 6-for-21 from the field.\n\nTrail Blazers 97, Jazz 89 – In Salt Lake City, Martell Webster scored 25 points and Portland won on the road for just the second time this season.\n\nThe Trail Blazers played without leading scorer LaMarcus Aldridge, who did not travel with the team because of a foot injury, but Webster came up with his season scoring high and Jarrett Jack added 16 points as the Blazers won their fourth straight.\n\nElsewhere in the NBA – Commissioner David Stern won’t punish Isiah Thomas or Madison Square Garden for their role in a sexual harassment trial that embarrassed the Knicks and the league."
