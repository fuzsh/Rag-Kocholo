        "text": "Martell Webster scored 21 points as the Washington Wizards beat the Los Angeles Clippers 98-90 on Monday night.\n\nThe Clippers, playing without the injured Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, watched as the Wizards pulled away with a 7-0 run late in the fourth quarter, spurred by a pair of big offensive rebounds by Nené. Nené and Garrett Temple scored 15 points each. Jamal Crawford scored 28 points, and DeAndre Jordan had a career-high 22 rebounds for the Clippers.\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points and Chris Bosh added 23 to lead the Miami Heat to a 99-84 win over the Charlotte Bobcats, their 10th consecutive victory over Charlotte. Dwyane Wade had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Heat, who have won nine of their last 10 at home. James was 13 for 14 from the field, for a career-best 93 percent shooting. Ramon Sessions scored 18 points for Charlotte, which lost its fourth in a row and 12th in the last 14.\n\nTyson Chandler equaled a franchise record with his third straight 20-rebound game and Carmelo Anthony scored 27 points as the New York Knicks cruised past the Detroit Pistons 99-85 for their fifth consecutive victory.\n\nIn a game that was decided early, Chandler played long enough to grab his 20th rebound midway through the fourth quarter. After grabbing 20 in victories on Friday and Saturday night, he became the first Knicks player to have 20 in three straight games since Hall of Famer Willis Reed in December 1969. Newly acquired Jose Calderon scored 15 points in his Detroit debut, while Greg Monroe had 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers took a share of the Central Division lead as David West scored 29 points and Paul George had 21 points, 11 rebounds and five assists in a 110-101 win over the Chicago Bulls. The Pacers have won three straight games and 14 at home, matching their longest home winning streak since 2002-03. Marco Belinelli had a season-high 24 points and Nate Robinson had 19 to lead the Bulls, who lost for only the third time in nine games."
