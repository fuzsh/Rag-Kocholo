As a senior at Seattle Prep he averaged 27.7 points, ten rebounds and two assists.\n\nHe was assigned with the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League to whom the Blazers assigned him in January, 2006. He returned to the Portland Trail Blazers in February, and proceeded to score his career high of 24 against Boston Celtics on February 24, 2006.\n\nHe is one of the last ever high school lottery picks to be chosen in an NBA Draft due to 2005's new draft eligibility rules.\n\nWebster's nickname, \"The Definition\", is a play on his surname (e.g., Webster's Dictionary).
