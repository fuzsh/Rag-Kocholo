        "text": "Seattle has been a hotbed for hoops for quite a while now and many of the local products who have made it to the NBA are also in this year’s playoffs.\n\nHere’s a look at each of the NBA players from the Seattle-area that have helped get their teams to the postseason, which started last week.\n\nSpencer Hawes, Los Angeles Clippers (Seattle Prep). After winning a state championship at Prep in 2006, Hawes spent just one season at the University of Washington (this was the first year the NBA required a year between high school graduation and draft eligibility). The Sacramento Kings took him with the No. 10 overall pick back in the 2007 NBA Draft. Hawes has also played in Philadelphia and Cleveland, but this year — his first with the Clippers — is his first time playing in the postseason.\n\nMartell Webster, Washington Wizards (Seattle Prep). Yes, there was a time when Hawes and Webster were a one-two punch for Seattle Prep. Webster was rated as a five-star recruit but declared for the NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Portland Trailblazers took him with the sixth overall pick in the 2006 draft and he spent the first five seasons of his career there. In addition to Portland and Washington, Webster also played for Minnesota. Career averages: 9 points and 3.2 rebounds per game.\n\nJason Terry, Houston Rockets (Franklin High). At Franklin, Terry helped the Quakers to back-to-back state championships in 1994 and 1995. Terry helped Arizona win the program’s first NCAA championship in 1997. Terry, who is Webster’s cousin, named the PAC-10 Player of the Year his senior season before being selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 1999 draft.\n\nAvery Bradley, Boston Celtics (Bellarmine Prep). Bradley spent three seasons at Bellarmine before transferring to Findlay Prep, a basketball powerhouse in Nevada. He and former Washington Husky guard Abdul Gaddy formed one of the best back court’s in the state at that time, making it to the 4A state semifinals in 2008. After one year at Texas, the Celtics picked Bradley 19th overall in the 2010 draft. He’s considered one of the top perimeter defenders in the NBA.\n\nAaron Brooks, Chicago Bulls (Franklin High). Brooks helped Franklin to a state title his senior year and picked up accolades as State Player of the Year from Gatorade, Seattle Times, and Tacoma News Tribune. In his career at Oregon he was ninth in scoring (1,511 points) and fourth in assists (471) before being selected as a 2007 first round draft pick by Houston.\n\nJamal Crawford, Los Angeles Clippers (Rainier Beach High). At Beach, Crawford helped lead the Vikings to a 1998 state title, and the high school gymnasium now bears his name as Crawford Court. The standout guard averaged over 16 points and four assists in his one year at Michigan before declaring for the NBA draft. Having played for Chicago, New York, Atlanta, and Portland, Crawford’s career averages are over 15 points and three assists.\n\nIsaiah Thomas, Boston Celtics (Curtis High). While at Curtis, Thomas set eight state tournament records, most notably points in a game (51), total tournament points (162), and highest average points (40.5). He went on to a stunning career at Washington, ranking sixth on the Husky scoring list with 1,721 points. His junior year, Thomas hit a game-winning overtime buzzer beater to lead Washington to the PAC-10 championship over Arizona. In 2011, he was a round two draft pick to the NBA."
