        "text": "Cavaliers fans have been clamoring for a rim protector.\n\nMany think it’s the one area that’s lacking on the championship-caliber roster.\n\nHowever, in center Brendan Haywood’s opinion, they already have one.\n\nThe 7-foot, 263-pounder missed the entire 2013-14 season with a stress fracture of his left foot. If he continues his path to good health, he could play a big role with the Cavaliers this season.\n\n‘I don’t feel like I’ve been written off,’ Haywood said. ‘I didn’t play last year. I have to prove to a lot of people I’m still healthy and I’m capable of doing what I did before. I have to go out there and earn my keep.\n\n‘My goal is to be the rim protector of this team. That’s what I’ve done my whole career.’\n\nThe North Carolina product has averaged 6.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 12 NBA seasons.\n\nHaywood, 34, was dealt to the Cavaliers on draft night, even though the trade wasn’t announced until mid-July.\n\n‘I had no idea,’ he said. ‘I found out I was traded on Twitter. It definitely blind-sided me.’\n\nHaywood said physically he feels fine.\n\n‘I’ve been playing five-on-five with the guys,’ he said. ‘I’m pretty much cleared.\n\n‘The medical staff is probably going to hold me back on some back-to-back days to make sure there’s not a re-injury. I can take part in most of the drills and most of the scrimmages.’\n\nMost expect Haywood to be Anderson Varejao’s backup at center.\n\n‘I have a lot of respect for Anderson Varejao,’ he said. ‘I think we offer very different things as far as the game of basketball. He’s really great as far as passing, rolling to the basket and finding guys on the weakside. I’m more of a shot-blocker, rebounding-type. I think we complement each other well.’\n\nSitting out last season in Charlotte was very difficult.\n\n‘The thing I learned the most, you have to make the most of your opportunity because in an instant, it can be gone,’ he said.\n\nIf healthy, he said he believes he can be a big asset.\n\n‘I can play physical inside, block shots, rebound, be an inside presence and finish at the rim,’ Haywood said. ‘I can play against the Roy Hibberts and Dwight Howards in the NBA.’\n\nComing together as a team is something that’s going on right now.\n\n‘The biggest thing we realize is we have a lot of talent, but talent doesn’t guarantee us anything,’ he said. ‘We have to come together as a unit and continue to play smart and play hard. When you do those things, good things will happen.’\n\nThe Cavaliers might have acquired him in the first place because they were intrigued by Haywood’s $10.5 million contract for 2015-16, which is not guaranteed. That could prove to be a huge trade chip this summer.\n\nQuick shots\n\n* Cavaliers forward LeBron James said he’s still undecided about playing for the U.S. Olympic team in 2016. ‘I’m nowhere near there yet,’ he said. ‘I haven’t thought about it too much.’\n\n* James said he let the fans and his two boys decide what number he would wear. He went back to his old No. 23. ‘My kids run my house,’ he said. ‘I really don’t have much say-so. They wanted to see me in 23. Between the fans and my kids, it was over with.’\n\n* Cavaliers coach David Blatt said forward Kevin Love has done a ‘great job’ so far defensively in training camp. ‘He’s such a smart player and has a great understanding of concepts,’ Blatt said. ‘He’s done a much better job on defense than people have given him credit for.’\n\n* Blatt said former Cavaliers guard Damon Jones is helping out in training camp. ‘He’s been helping out in practice and learning as he goes,’ Blatt said. Jones has not been hired as a coach."
