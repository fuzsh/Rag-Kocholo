        "text": "Monta Ellis\n\n: What are your thoughts on the possible 20 year old age requirement the NBA is considering imposing?\n\nMonta: I don't too much think about it because if I do decide to come out it won't effect me anyway. And if I don't, you know I can still go to college for one year and still come out. For the other guys who wanna come out.the NBA is not like the NFL. If you come out of high school in the NBA, you can adapt quicker to the play of the basketball game more then you can on the football field. They can't base it on because the NFL is doing this then the NBA is trying to do it. It's two different sports. Football is contact. Basketball is contact, but its not more contact then football. I'm not worried about it because if I go to college I'll still come out after one year, but if I decide to go now, it won't effect me. I just feel bad for the guys next year, they have higher for the 2006 draft to come out.\n\n: Now there have been reports that you are strongly considering the draft because you are ineligible to play college basketball next year. If college were to start tomorrow, would you be eligible to play college basketball?\n\nMonta: (Laughs).Yes I would be able to play. I have a 2.7 GPA and a 23 on my ACT. As long as me and my high school coach know how my grades are. Rumors are rumors. People are going to talk about the negative things before they talk about the positive. I can do 10 positive things right now and I one negative thing and they're gonna talk about it. Rumors are rumors. You know? You can't stop that.\n\n: Well while we're on the subject of rumors, is there any truth to the rumor that you have already been in contact and/or signed with the agent XXXX XXXXXX? [blacked out for Agent/Player's sake]\n\nMonta: No that's not true. I haven't signed no papers at all yet. I've just been going through my senior year trying to finish out my high school career and worry about what I need to worry about after my season over with.\n\n: Do you think you can play point guard at the next level?\n\nMonta: I know I can play point guard. I've played point before. I still play point. I played point the whole season this year. So it ain't no doubt that I can play the point. I like to come off screens, but if I have to play the 1, I can play the 1.\n\n: So if you can play the point, why didn't your coach do that all game tonight?\n\nMonta: (Laughs).. He figured that I was a better shooter then anyone on the floor, so he put me at the two. Then when I played for the first 7 minutes and I didn't get in for the next what 20 some minutes? He expect me to get in and do what I need to do when I've been sitting on the bench for 20 minutes. You know? You get stiff like that. I can play the 1. Most people have seen it this year that I can play the 1. My last 15 games, I was up to about 10 or 11 assists a game, so there ain't no doubt that I can play the 1. I can play the 1.\n\n: So when are you planning on making your decision as to if you're going to enter the draft?\n\nMonta: About a week from now.\n\n: So you're going to make your decision before the Jordan game?\n\nMonta: Probably so.\n\n: Where would you have to be picked in order for you to stay in the draft?\n\nMonta: Top 15.\n\n: So let me get this clear. If you aren't projected as a top 15 pick, you will withdraw and go to Mississippi State?'\n\nMonta: Yes I would.\n\n: Best of luck in the Hoop Summit and Jordan Classic.\n\nMonta: Thanks a lot.\n\nJosh McRoberts from post game press conference.\n\n: Are you considering the NBA at all right now? Is it even an option for you?\n\nMcRoberts: No, I don't think so. Not right now. I haven't even thought about it.\n\n: Considering your solid play at the Roundball Classic at practices and your MVP performance tonight, how come?\n\nMcRoberts: I don't know. Right now, I just really want to go to college and have that experience. To play for Coach K, I really want that opportunity. I don't feel that I'm ready yet for the NBA, physically or mentally.\n\nMedia: Describe the relationship you have with Greg Paulus.\n\nMcRoberts: I've really gotten to know him ever since we both committed at close to the same time to Duke. I've gotten to know him through AAU tournaments and stuff like that. We talkwe talk all the time on the phone. I roomed with him this week, so I got to know him really well. I think it showed on the court a little bit.\n\nMartell Webster\n\n: What are your thoughts on the NBA's possible 20 year old age requirement?\n\nMartell: I think it's a good idea. A lot of people might not want it to happen right now, but if it does, it probably won't take place til next year. I think it's a good thing because David Stern says there a lot of immature players and from what I have seen in the paper, I can probably say that is true. I probably stand by him on that one. There's probably some good potential coming out, guys who are real hungry and are ready for the NBA. I think it's a 50/50 split. Whatever happens, I back it.\n\n: Now if the age limit were to go into effect, how would it affect you personally?\n\nWebster: I really want to pursue the NBA dream, and if I really, really wanted to go right now, I'd probably be disappointed. I probably wouldn't want that to happen. But so far, it's not taking place, so I'm still in good hands. College is still there, so I don't have anything to worry about.\n\n: So are you still considering entering the NBA draft?\n\nWebster: Yes, yes. It's still an option, but college is an option too. Whatever comes first or whatever my decision is, that's it.\n\n: Do you know when you're going to be making your decision?\n\nWebster: I'm not sure.\n\n: Do you think it will be closer to the deadline or right after the Jordan game?\n\nWebster: It will be closer to the deadline probably.\n\n: So if you were to enter the draft, where would you have to be projected as being picked in order to stay in the draft?\n\nWebster: I don't know, I haven't really thought of that. I'm sure everyone wants a high pick. Top 10.\n\n: Would you be satisfied with merely being a late first round pick?\n\nWebster: It depends on how much I want to go. If I'm going to be a late pick, then I'm probably just going to go to college. Get my stock up in college and then hopefully get a better pick next year.\n\n: So you are aware that with the age limit, you'd have to go to school for two years?\n\nWebster: That's if the rule passes. But yes I understand. It's a chance I'm willing to take.\n\n: What would you say you bring to the table as a player?\n\nWebster: All around game. There are a lot of things I need to work on, don't get me wrong. Defense is the main part of that, and I've been working really hard on my defense. I can shoot, I can pass. I'm just an all around player.\n\n: What is your actual height and weight?\n\nWebster: 6'8, 230 lbs.\n\n: Do you know what your vertical jump and wingspan are?\n\nWebster: My vertical jump is 36 inches. I'm not really sure on my wingspan.\n\n: Thanks a lot. Best of luck in the Hoop Summit, Jordan game, and with whatever decision you decide to make after that.\n\nWebster: I really appreciate that.\n\nCJ Miles\n\n: C.J, there has been some talk that you are thinking about entering the NBA draft. Is there any truth to this?\n\nMiles: Right now, I'm focusing on school. There has been a lot of talk about it. If it comes, it comes. I'm just playing my game. If I'm high enough, I'll go. Right now I'm leaning towards school though.\n\n: What are your thoughts on the possible 20 year old age requirement the NBA is considering imposing?\n\nMiles: There have been so many good players out of high school, but there have been so many downfalls. To me, if it looks like he is ready to play and the team is willing to take himthey're [the NBA] not the team, they're telling the team to take the player. I don't think it's really that effective because they're just going to come out in two years anyways.\n\n: So when are you planning on deciding on if you're going to enter the draft or not?\n\nMiles: I don't know. I'm just taking it time by time. Just working out. Focusing on doing what I gotta do.\n\n: What do you see your position being on the next level?\n\nMiles: The 1 or 2.\n\n: What are your height and your weight right now?\n\nMiles: 6'6, 205 lbs.\n\n: If you were to enter the draft, where would you have to be picked in order to stay in the draft?\n\nMiles: I don't know. It just depends on the situation. It just depends on the situation of me going to that team and how its going to look, how they're going to develop me, if they're going to put me in and see if I can play. I mean, I don't expect to go in and just take some minutes, but it just depends on how my game is when I come around. If they [NBA personnel] think I'm good enough to go, then I'll go.\n\n: What do you think your role would be if you were to attend Kansas next year?\n\nMiles: It's Texas. There have been a lot of misprints lately. Help Daniel Gibson out in the backcourt and be another person to attack the basket. They have some shooters, but they don't have people who are able to slash, penetrate, and kick. Just do everything. That's what I do.\n\n: What do you think your role would be if you were to enter the NBA draft?\n\nMiles: Probably more of what I do. Just do little intangible stuff. Getting rebounds, pushing the ball, make passes. Play like I did today by hitting my jump shot. Attacking the basket when they run at me. Just playing.\n\n: Do you have any idea where this stuff is coming from about you considering entering the draft?\n\nMiles: It's just a lot of NBA people's talk. There's a lot of buzz around me. I have to think about it if they put me on these internet sites saying that I can get picked in the first round, put my name on the draft board and the mock drafts. You gotta think about it. I'm just playing hard, and if I'm blessed enough to go, I'll go.\n\n: Thanks a lot C.J. Best of luck in the Jordan game and the Hoop Summit.\n\nMiles: Thank you.\n\nLuke Zeller from Press Conference.\n\nMedia: What was it like for you playing at the Joyce Center tonight?\n\nZeller: It was a great thing. The media said there would be more pressure on you because you're playing at the Joyce Center for the first time and I said No, its actually more support. That's really how I felt tonight. I just went out there and played. My team played really well and I was just out there supporting them.\n\nMedia: How about the whole week in general, being here in South Bend.\n\nZeller: It's been great. It really feels like home already. I'm looking forward to playing here next year.\n\nMedia: Tough night for you. Obviously not the way you had hoped. A little different then last Saturday.\n\nZeller: A little bit. I was hoping to get it down to a one point game so I could shoot another half court shot, but we couldn't get it close enough.\n\nMedia: Are you kind of emotionally spent after what happened Saturday and then coming up here for a few days?\n\nZeller: I haven't really had time to think about it. I haven't had any time to sleep or think about it. I'm looking forward to sitting at home and taking a break from anything. It's been a fun ride though. One of the best weeks of my life and something I'll remember for a long, long time.\n\nMedia: Have you had the chance to walk around Washington yet and get slapped on the back by all your boys?\n\nZeller: I went to church. Other then that, we had a pep session and that's about it. I really haven't been home much. I don't know if there's a town left after everything that happened Saturday, so we'll find out.\n\nMedia: Would you have liked to have fared better against Josh?\n\nZeller: I don't think there is anything individual that is important as far as I was just worried about my team to do the best they could do and help them out there as much as I could.\n\nLuke Zeller\n\n: What are your thoughts on the possible 20 year old age requirement the NBA is considering imposing?\n\nZeller: That's for them to decide. I don't have anything for them to do with that. They can take care of that and do whatever they want.\n\n: What will you bring to the table next year at Notre Dame so they don't have another disappointing finish like they did this year?\n\nZeller: Just hard work, passing out of the post, and things like that. Being able to knock down the shot when I'm open, and things like that.\n\n: Why did you choose Notre Dame?\n\nZeller: Just the academic and athletic excellence that they pursue. That was very attractive. The combination of that and being close to home doesn't hurt.\n\n: Do you feel pressure playing in-state?\n\nZeller: No, it actually feels like I have more support. The pressure is not there. I have the support of the whole state behind me and it feels really good.\n\n: Do you think that you're going to be able to start next year next to Torin Francis?\n\nZeller: I don't know, that's not my decision. We'll let Coach Brey make that choice. I'll work hard and we'll see what happens.\n\n: Do you think you'll be playing power forward or center?\n\nZeller: Probably power forward.\n\n: Thanks Luke. Best of luck in the Adidas game.\n\nZeller: Thank you very much.\n\nRead Next...\n\nPangos All-American Camp Interviews: Bassey, Porter, Walker\n\nInterviews with Charles Bassey, Kevin Porter, and Kyree Walker from the 2017 Pangos All-American Camp.\n\nPangos All-American Camp Interviews: Dotson, Mann, Moody\n\nInterviews with Devon Dotson, Tre Mann, and Moses Moody from the 2017 Pangos All-American Camp."
