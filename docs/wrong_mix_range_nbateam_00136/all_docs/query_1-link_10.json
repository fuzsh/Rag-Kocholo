        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nA gifted shooter who brought a sweet natural perimeter stroke for a player his size. Long of limb, and was an above-average defender. Also was a solid athlete who showed some versatility. Played a little too much on the perimeter, which limited and field-goal percentage and his production as a rebounder (both of which could have been better). Wasn't much of a passer. His career was limited by injuries."
