        "text": "Hip-hop has been a longstanding passion for Webster. He toyed around with beats as a rookie on the Portland Trailblazers, and he built a studio in his Minnesota home when he played for the Timberwolves from 2010 to 2012. But he didn’t start writing lyrics until two years ago. “There was a time during the season when I wasn’t happy with what was going on—my role, trying to stay 100 percent,” he said. “The times I felt down or whatever and just needed to vent, I would vent on the Notes app on my iPhone.”\n\nThe Washington Wizards announced today that the team has waived forward Martell Webster and signed center Ryan Hollins. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. “Martell, with his contributions on the court and ability to connect with the fans and the community off the court, has been a great example of the type of player we want to represent our organization,” said Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld. “He worked extremely hard to fight through his injuries but unfortunately was not able to make a healthy return. We appreciate everything he contributed to the team and wish him and his family nothing but the best.”\n\nStoryline: Martell Webster Free Agency\n\nWashington will still owe Webster, 28, the remainder of his $5.6 million salary this season and $2.5 million next season, unless he is claimed off waivers — a very unlikely possibility. The charismatic swingman joined the Wizards on a one-year contract in 2012 and turned in his best season as a pro, averaging a career-high 11.4 points per game while shooting a career-best 42.2 percent from three-point range."
