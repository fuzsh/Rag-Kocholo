        "text": "NEW ORLEANS â€” Veteran small forward Martell Webster has signed a training camp deal with the New Orleans Pelicans, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWebster, who missed the past season recovering from a hip injury is a 10-year veteran of the NBA with stints in Portland, Minnesota and Washington.\n\nInjuries have plagued the 6-7 swingman since he joined the NBA in 2005. He has suffered damage to his left foot, his back, and his right hip and has player fewer than 61 games in five of his 10 seasons.\n\nHowever, when healthy, Webster has shown a dependable shot from distance, converting better than 38 percent of his three-pointers.\n\nHe brings little as a rebounder or defender, so if he makes the team it would be primarily as a specialist.\n\nTraining camp begins in late September."
