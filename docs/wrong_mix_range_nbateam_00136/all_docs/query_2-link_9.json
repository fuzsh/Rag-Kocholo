        "text": "Martell Webster is expected to return to the Washington Wizards with a new four-year contract in hand next season, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. Wojnarowski reports that the deal will be worth $22 million over the duration of the contract, with the fourth year partially-guaranteed.\n\nWebster, who SB Nation's Tom Ziller said is \"not worth much of a contract, but could be a nice pickup in the right situation -- including Washington\" during his rundown of the NBA's top free agents, played for Washington on a one-year deal worth $1.75 million last year.\n\nThe former lottery pick has had an up-and-down career thus far as he's struggled to stay healthy in earlier stints with the Portland Trail Blazers and Minnesota Timberwolves. Webster tallied career highs in points and assists this season, though, while increasing his 3-point percentage to an impressive 42 percent despite hoisting it up from beyond the arc more than four times per game.\n\nWebster has yet to live up to the expectations most people have for players picked in the top 10, but he seems to be improving each season. And, at just 26 years of age, it wouldn't be surprising if Webster has just now finally found his groove despite already spending eight seasons on NBA rosters.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• The NBA's top 90 free agents | All NBA free agency news\n\n• Grading the NBA free agent deals\n\n• Tyreke Evans and the suddenly hot free agent market\n\n• Rondo's on board with Boston's rebuild"
