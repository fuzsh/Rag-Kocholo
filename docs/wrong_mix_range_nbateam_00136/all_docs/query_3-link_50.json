        "text": "Martell Webster on the track.\n\nHe's already achieved one dream — playing in the NBA. The 29-year-old NBA veteran is now pursing another passion.\n\nMORE: Rap's basketball All-Star team | Jeremy Lin gets photobombed by Nelly\n\nWebster is putting the finishing touches on his rap debut, \"Emerald District,\" as he attempts to rebound from a hip injury that got him cut by the Washington Wizards early this season.\n\nThe sixth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, Webster was one of the last players to go directly from high school to the NBA. It was during his time with the Timberwolves — whom he played for from 2010 through 2012 — that he began perfecting his flow.\n\n\"There was a time during the season when I wasn't happy with what was going on — my role, trying to stay 100 percent,\" he told Vice Sports. \"The times I felt down or whatever and just needed to vent, I would vent on the Notes app on my iPhone.\"\n\nWebster recently performed at South by Southwest and released a single called “Give It Up” earlier this month, which rides on the hipster-chill-rap vibe.\n\nWebster has averaged 8.9 points and 3.1 rebounds for his career, and he’s not giving up on basketball just yet.\n\n\"I have my hands in so many different things, because life is about building knowledge through all the different things you do,\" he said. \"I know what I can do. I know what I want to pursue.\""
