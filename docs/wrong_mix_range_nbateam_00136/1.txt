Check out the latest NBA news and rumors below.

• Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose is still battling blurred vision, reports ESPN. Rose sustained a fracture to his left orbital bone during the preseason, and said he often plays with only one eye open because of the injury.

• Washington Wizards forward Martell Webster has a partially torn labrum in his hip, according to CSN Mid-Atlantic. Webster might need surgery, but is holding out hope he can avoid it. In an attempt to avoid putting excess stress on his hip, Webster is using prescription eyewear to help keep him balanced.

• Kobe Bryant is now in the midst of his 20th season with the Los Angeles Lakers, which is an NBA record. No one has played for as many seasons with the same team as Bryant, according to ESPN.
