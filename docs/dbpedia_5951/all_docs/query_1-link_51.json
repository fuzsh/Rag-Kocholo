Emmaline seems to have everything that John is looking for - a loving family, a comfortable home, and a good reputation. However, John is hesitant to make a commitment because he is still struggling with his own past. Despite his reservations, John and Emmaline begin a courtship. As they get to know each other, they realize that they have a lot in common. They share a love of music and spending time outdoors, and they are both determined to find a way to make their relationship work. Despite the obstacles in their way, John and Emmaline are determined to find their hearts' desire.; 8vo; FSA."
