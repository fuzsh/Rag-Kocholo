        "text": "Studio executives purposely downplayed the fact that the new “Mean Girls” is actually the movie version of a stage musical after poor feedback from audiences on movie musicals.\n\nMusicals can be, in a word, divisive. Some people love them, some people hate them, and some people won’t watch them if they’re on screen. The movie musical itself can be such a turnoff that Paramount purposely downplayed the fact that the new “Mean Girls” movie is a musical, much to the surprise of some audiences.\n\nStudios took the same marketing approach with “Wonka” and “The Color Purple,” both new musical films. These executives were likely scared off by the box office performance of other recent movie musicals like “West Side Story” and “In the Heights,” as BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThese numbers are interesting when you consider the stage productions of these shows were better received. Why is it that shows that perform well on Broadway don’t always translate well to screen? Some of it has to do with the way music is presented in musicals, according to Allen Feinstein, teaching professor of music at Northeastern University.\n\n“Everyone who goes to the theater accepts that it’s artificial,” Feinstein said. “You’re going into a room with other people who are presenting thoughts, ideas, stories and characters. If you add musical theater elements and characters start to sing, it’s even more artificial. Most movies take advantage of all the realism you can depict with the tools of movie making. You’re not in the same room with people. They’re in a setting that is more organic to those characters. It’s depicted realistically much of the time. If you’re going to introduce the truly artificial conceit of characters breaking into song in a realistic setting (in a movie), there are challenges to making that work artistically. It’s forcing something super artificial into a setting where people are used to seeing very true representations.”\n\nThat is the struggle for Jeff Hirbour whenever he tries to watch musicals. The TV producer and Cambridge resident has a degree in film theory and follows the Oscars.\n\n“Musicals don’t really work for me,” he said. “I’ve had good experiences in person when I see musicals, but for some reason, wherever I watch them on TV, it doesn’t quite work for me.”\n\nSome of the only musical media Hirbour enjoyed are ones in which the music makes sense in the context of the plot — for example, he loved the episode of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” in which the characters were possessed by a demon that made everyone sing.\n\n“That was the first time it worked for me,” Hirbour said. “I realized that I only liked (musicals) if there’s a logical reason why people are breaking into song which makes no sense, right? Because it’s a demon so it’s not even realistic. But if you give me a reason why people would start singing, I could get behind it. But it’s just people day-to-day singing for no reason, I get very confused as to why that’s happening.”\n\nThis might be the reason why some theatergoers — according to TikTok — are walking out of showings when “Mean Girls” protagonist Cady Heron starts singing in her high school math classroom. Unlike in the stage musical of “Mean Girls” (which ran on Broadway from 2018 to 2020), it likely yanked viewers out of the realism of the movie.\n\nFeinstein, who’s composed and conducted music for film and stage, said most music used in non-musical films is either scores that the audience can hear but the characters can’t or music that makes sense in the context of a film (like a character listening to a song on the radio or at a concert). But most musicals feature music that is sung by the characters themselves without the knowledge they’re singing.\n\n“That’s how they express themselves is through song (in a musical),” Feinstein said. “But it’s not like characters aren’t saying to the audience or to the other characters ‘OK, I’m going to sing a song and tell you how I feel.’ Their emotion is so intense that they break into song and that’s part of the artifice. Film scoring is totally different (with) the relationship between the music and the characters and the awareness of the music happening.”"
