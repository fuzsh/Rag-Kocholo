        "text": "The year was 1930 and in an outrageous film called “Madam Satan,” an early but already vintage effort by Cecil B. DeMille, a lot of well‐heeled people were holding a masked ball — in a dirigible moored over New York. “Just Imagine,” another film released that year, was boldly anticipating what life would be like in 1980. For one thing, people weren't going to have names any more, and playing one of those numbered souls was a very green young actress named Maureen O'Sullivan. By 1934 Miss O' Sullivan was a seasoned Hollywood hand and had become famous as Johnny Weismuller's jungle partner; that year they were in “Tarzan and His Mate.” A high point of 1939, for some filmgoers, was being able to watch Gracie Allen bumble her way through a supremely looney suspense story called “The Gracie Allen Murder Case.”\n\nNot surprisingly, the decade of the 30's, the years in which the Depression collided with the advent of sound and a subsequent public mania for movies, was a busy decade for escape films. But it was also a time for social commentary. There was William Wellman's “Wild Boys of the Road,” (1933), in which a youthful Frankie Darro and Edwin Phillips acted out youth's coming of age in the Depression years. There was “Let Us Live” a 1939 film with Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Sullivan, Alan Baxter and Ralph Bellamy that explored a real story of law and order gone awry in the false arrest and near execution in the gas chamber — of two Boston taxi drivers. There was “Redskin” (1929), a story of interracial marriage — between a Pueblo woman and a Navajo man who was caught in between the culture of his birth and the white man's education he had received. And in the political naiveté and uncertainty of 1933 there was “Gabriel Over the White House,” with Walter Huston — a chilling pitch for a little fascism in the White House\n\nAll of these films are part of “19291939 — From the Crash to the Fair,” two‐week series of period motion pictures being presented by Joseph Papp starting Tuesday at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theater. The series is a celebration of the decade in which moviegoing in America reached a peak that has never been surpassed. By the millions, people turned to the movies to forget for while the desperation and unrest of the Depression. For anyone who could spare a dime — then a quarter or even 50 cents — America was a kingdom of picture palaces.\n\n•\n\nForget for the moment the Marx Brothers, Garbo, Chaplin and Astaire. This festival is not aiming to hit only the highlights — though there will be stars aplenty. Rather it is attempting to provide a rare look at ordinary fare, a real cross‐section of the prodigious output of Hollywood in its busiest years. It was an era when the studios were supreme and each company had its distinct trademark. M-G-M was making lush and glossy “coffee‐table” films full of classy people. The films of Warner Brothers were tougher, rawer and more socially incisive. Universal was big in horror films, and R.K.O. could be counted on for a bit of Americana.\n\nThe 30's saw not only the first flourish of sound films but also the introduction of color photography in the cinema. These new technologies were employed in literally hundreds of films churned out every year by companies who still owned their movie houses and were thus guaranteed a showing for every film. There were musicals, science fiction and adventure films, documentaries and newsreels, serials, adaptations of plays and films of strong social comment. Since studios were quick to feel the public pulse, all films in their respective ways said something about their time.\n\n“If historians really want to study society in this country during that period, then the best source would be these films,” Mr. Papp said as he and Fabian Canosa, the Public's film programmer, and Andy Holtzman, the theater's film program coordinator, sat down to talk about the series and how they are hoping to recreate the whole 1930's moviegoing experience in their 90‐seat house.\n\n“Moviegoing was your contact with the outside world,” added Mr, Canosa, who won a New York Film Critics award in 1974 for his innovative programming at the old First Avenue Screening Room in Manhattan. “When we selected these films, we tried to get a little of everything people saw— a little bit of adventure, some melodrama, news, lots of shorts. We tried to cover everything that was showing in the neighborhood theaters. Millions of people went to the movies then. The high point was between 1929 and 1932. In ‘33 and ‘34 it declined a lot, then it picked up a little again. In the peak years about 88 million people would go to the movies every week. Now 30 or 40 million would be tops — and the population has increased much.”\n\n•\n\nThe organizers of the show at the Public began with several hundred possible titles, from which about 35 feature films were selected. In addition to those already mentioned, the series will include “Whoopee” (1930), which along with “Redskin” was made by the original two‐strip Technicolor process; the 1929 million‐dollar musical “Broadway” and Raoul Walsh's “The Bowery” (1932), with Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper. In a trio of mysteries set aside for Halloween, the audience that night will see Carole Lombard in “Supernatural” (1933), “Murder by the Clock” (1931) with William Boyd and the Grade Allen whodunit.\n\nGiven the revolutionary potential of the time, the 30's produced surprisingly few political films. ('Was it Sam Goldwyn who said, ‘If I want a message I'll call Western Union'?” Mr. Papp interjected.) But Mr. Canosa emphasizes that there were many filmmakers not excluding Cecil B. DeMille— whose works were social commentaries. As an example, the Public will be showing “Winterset,” an adaptation of the Maxwell Anderson play about the SaccoVanzetti murder case.\n\nPerhaps the series’ most haunting and strange film on a political theme is “Gabriel Over the White House,” with its favorable view of fascism. “Hitler wasn't so strong then,” Mr. Canosa said in trying to put “Gabriel” in historical perspective. “People hadn't figured out what he was yet. The film is a call to curb the excesses of all social classes.”\n\nOver and over again the classless appeal of the cinema comes up in conversations about the 30's. Not that the age wasn't a time of studio‐created glamour, of lush interiors and excesses of champagne and caviar. Indeed some of this glamour spilled right out over the neighborhood audiences, seated in their moorish‐fantasy theaters attended by corps of bow‐tied ushers who might have been Busby Berkeley extras. But cinema in the 30's, the film historians say, had a way of looking at the great economic disaster through the eyes of the people who stood farthest from Wall Street. There was anger and bitterness, but there was Continued on Page 22\n\n`During the Depression, for people who could spare a dime or a quarter, America was a kingdom of picture palaces.’\n\nUlenn Tryon and chorus girls in the 1929 film “Broadway,” part of “From the Crash to the Fair,” a series starting Tuesday at the Public-'escape plus social commentary”\n\nCelebrating the Movie‐Mad 30's\n\nContinued from Page 17\n\nalso humor. “The films dealt with poverty in a variety of ways,” Mr. Papp said. “Sometimes they made jokes about it. ‘Is there a headline about breadline today?’ they would sing. Or ‘We're in the money.’ They sang a lot of happiness. There were lots of songs like ‘Life is just a bowl of cherries.’ People were taking the whole thing of the Crash and the stock market failure and turning it into a kind of tap dance. But still there were identifiable, real, poor people. You don't see that many common folks in films today. It's all turned very middle class.\n\n“The films of the 30's were much more oriented to the masses,” Mr. Papp went on. “It was a very democratic medium because it really had tremendous appeal to the ordinary person. That made it as popular as Shake- speare's theater at the Globe.”\n\nThe actors and actresses who starred in these films of such extraordinary popular appeal were among the luckiest people who lived in the 30's. Theirs was a growth industry. “We were paid all through the Depression- and many actors were paid very well indeed,” said Maureen O'Sullivan, who can be seen in four films on the Public bill: “Let Us Live,” “Tarzan and His Mate,” “Just Imagine” and “Okay America” (1932). “I think most of us were unaware of the Depression, which is unfortunate in a way,” she said. “I remember only one incident. I was walking along Hollywood Boulevard and there were people standing around a bank. They were all crying. A policeman was telling them to move along and he was crying, too.\n\n“Hollywood in those days was a world unto itself,” Miss O'Sullivan said. “There was the Malibu colony where everyone lived. There was not too much conversation except about films. We were all consumed with the love of film. But Hollywood was lovely little city, a dream world.” ■"
