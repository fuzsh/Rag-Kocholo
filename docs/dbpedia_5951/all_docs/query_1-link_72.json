        "text": "April 24, 2019\n\nFew of these books are any good and fewer still are so good they feel like an episode. This is one of the latter books. The characterisation was spot on and I particularly enjoyed the thought of Sam and Jack piloting an airship.\n\nOctober 2, 2022\n\npretty good, actually well paced so üëå\n\nMarch 9, 2021\n\nNot one of my favourites. Too bad because I love Amy Griswold.\n\nApril 6, 2016\n\nA good solid SG1 story, would have made a good episode.\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nGreat book\n\nIf you are a Stargate fan you will enjoy this book very much. Interesting right from the first page. Well done\n\nJune 6, 2020\n\nMaybe I read too much fanfiction, but I was hoping for more angst and reflection.\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nI didn't know exactly what to make of this when I first picked it up. This book takes place in the aftermath of Teal'c having been forced to kill Sha're before Amaunet killed Daniel with the ribbon.\n\nHammond sends SG-1 on what was supposed to be an easy diplomatic mission telling O'Neill it's to let his team get some badly need rest. The gate is high on a mountain top and they're picked up by a dirigible that Sam determines defies the laws of physics.\n\nAfter a couple of days of discovering the people of this world don't possess anything worthy of a trading relationship, Daniel discovers some ancient stones and want's to see more. The king makes this ‚Äútrade agreement‚Äù into a big deal and requires the ceremony take place in a special courtyard where they praise their Goa'uld goddess who pays no attention to the planet but once a year when she comes for her tribute.\n\nPirates arrive, separating SG-1 and stealing them away on their own dirigibles after zatting thedm. Sam and Jack on one and Daniel and Teal'c on the other.\n\nThe pirate that captured Daniel and Teal'c has taken the ancient tablets believing they lead to treasure and that she intends to ransom them to the goddess as she's arriving for her tribute and tours her houses of worship. Daniel convinces her that he can figure out the writing and she relents when he figures out coordinates.\n\nJack and Sam manage to escape and zat the crew. Sam discovers that the dirigibles fly using Goa'uld anti-gravity tech. They land and haul the crew onto the ground, keeping the captain to help fly the thing.\n\nHaving earlier established radio contact with Daniel and Teal'c, Sam creates a homing beacon they use to rescue their fellow team members.\n\nAlong the way both Jack and Sam and Daniel and Teal'c learn from their would be captors that the King takes a lot for himself and often leaving the farmers and other citizens to starve.\n\nI'm not going to give away any more, but I really enjoyed this book. It's well written and well paced, and I ended up having quite a bit of empathy for the pirate that took Daniel and Teal'c hostage.\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nQuite an enjoyable read. It didn't so much feel like an episode of Stargate SG-1 as an SG-1 movie set in season 3 (which isn't a bad thing, just what how it came across to me). That's probably due to how broad and slightly epic the story felt. A bit more humour would have made it even better as I thought Jack's humour was just a tiny bit off.\n\nThe first half/two thirds dragged on a bit at some points, though perhaps that's because pirates aren't my thing, sea, air, or otherwise. Reba also irritated me quite a bit, though I'm still unsure whether I was meant not to like her or whether it's just me. But I really loved the end and the heart's desire/dream/what could have been part! I thought it was quite well done and I very much enjoyed reading it. It wasn't particularly original as it's something we've seen in the show several times but I liked the execution.\n\nSince I was so very critical of how badly Sam was written in the last Stargate book I read and how useless she was made out to be (still not over that, no one puts baby in the corner!), it would be a bit hypocritical of me not to point out that I thought Teal'c was a bit left out in this one, compared to our three other stooges. Otherwise, it was fairly balanced between their different capabilities and talents and everyone contributed to driving the story and their own rescue forward.\n\nAll in all, good little story and I had fun reading it.\n\nMay 24, 2021\n\nNot the best-ever SG-1 adventure, but with lots of action and some great introspection - including a look at some \"what-if\" scenarios akin to something what we'd see later on with the Atlantis team. Some of the diplomatic talks (early on) were a bit slow, but the pirates definitely added an interesting touch (especially given their mode of \"sailing.\" Overall, a worthy read for any Stargate fan :-)\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\nA fun jaunt\n\nA fun, action-packed read. My favorite of all the SG books I've read so far. The characterization was spot on, it tied in nicely to the series episodes it referenced, and it was just plain entertaining.\n\nApril 20, 2019\n\n3.5 stars. I had a little trouble getting into it as I thought the second third or so of the story was just a little to slow and the new characters just weren't that interesting. However, I loved the last third a lot!\n\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\nThe writing was not great compared to other stories in the series (sorry) but it did feel like it could have been an episode on the show. We even got tons of Sam/jack content which I‚Äôm never not happy about ;)\n\nJanuary 21, 2023\n\nmostly okay\n\nOther than sleeping Jaffa, this wasn‚Äôt a bad book. The characters were true to the tv series. Except the writer doesn‚Äôt seem to know that Jaffa with symbiotes don‚Äôt sleep but instead meditate through Kel‚Äôno‚Äôrem.\n\nApril 19, 2021\n\nThis was a particularly fun idea. Not at all the most exciting adventure, but a fun story nonetheless. Heaps of puzzle solving in true SG1 form and even Hammond gets in a delightful pickle.\n\nOctober 7, 2014\n\nI found this story a little slow going but still interesting."
