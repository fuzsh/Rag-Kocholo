        "text": "Confusing might be a word to describe this hardcore punk/metalcore outfit. Since its inception in 2009, The Armed has featured a revolving door of members. It's been known to not include names of band members on its albums, use actors to portray shots of the group, and not promote tours. Sounds strange, but this all certainly plays to the mystique of the band, which has put out four studio records.The most recent arrived in 2021.\n\nIn the case of Badfinger, it's about \"what could have been.\" Dubbed by some critics in the mid-1960s as the \"next Beatles,\" these Welsh power-poppers were the first band signed by the Fab Four's Apple label in 1968. Though the group enjoyed worldwide success with hits \"Come and Get It,\" \"No Matter What,\" \"Day After Day\" and \"Baby Blue,\" financial and legal issues consistently plagued the band following Apple's demise. Vocalist Pete Ham tragically took his own life in 1975, as did guitarist/bassist Tom Evans in '83. Drummer Mike Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005, leaving guitarist Joey Molland as the only surviving member from the classic lineup. Molland, however, has toured under the Badfinger name in recent years.\n\nWhat Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter have created since Daft Punk's inception in the early 1990s is set the bar massively high in the world of electronic house/dance music as six-time Grammy Award winners. Of course, the intrigue, excitement and mystery of the duo's fantastic live shows have always been part of its legacy. The upbeat energy, tremendous light shows and, of course, those shining helmets that we see from behind their elevated turntable all adds to one of the greatest audio and visual experiences in the history of modern music.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguingly consistent question that surrounds Death Grips is to how to categorize its sound? It's been dubbed experimental or industrial hip-hop, even electronica, with some punk flash. The trio, which got going in 2010, is indifferent on the subject, which is part of the fun for a group that's also been known for its unpredictability. There's also a certain vibe of mystery surrounding vocalist/lyricist Stefan Burnett (aka MC Ride), one of the most aggressive and in-your-face vocal performers.\n\nIs Devo the most misunderstood band in music history? There's certainly a case to be made. To the casual music fan back in the 1970s and '80s, on the surface, Devo looked like a gimmick. Nerdy-looking guys with those goofy plastic hats and colorful jump suits. In reality, Devo was, and still is, highly innovative and influential â€” not just on the new wave scene, but the broader completion of alternative music. That influence thrived during the infancy of mainstream music videos (See \"Whip It\"). In its heyday, Devo was led by the brother duos of Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh and Gerald and Bob Casales. High-profile artists from David Bowie to Dave Grohl have cited the band as a major influence on their own work.\n\nThe 1991 Oliver Stone movie about Jim Morrison and Co. painted a decent picture into the fascinatingly obscure and disturbing mind of the legendary frontman, and what life within the Doors was like. Morrison's dependence on alcohol and hallucinogenic drugs, and introducing the latter to the other three band members, fueled the group's creativity. It ultimately played a part in the singer's demise, as well. Those various substances left a sense of unpredictability of what the Doors, or Morrison, specifically, would do next. That created more buzz, and eventually, controversy.\n\nFor those metal fans not in the know, it's time well spent experiencing the wonderment that's Ghost. These Swedish hard rock/metal masters, and Grammy winners, have consistently generated acclaim, while also growing its popularity through its mysterious collective persona. The mystery includes nameless band members (though frontman Tobias Forge has played the roles of Papa Emeritus and Cardinal Copia) dressed in religious, yet gothic, Cardinal and papal costumes during their highly theatrical and virtuosic stage shows. Campy perhaps, but all part of the Ghost experience.\n\nRock music writer Mick Wall wrote a book about Guns N' Roses back in the 1990s, titled Guns N' Roses: The Most Dangerous Band in the World. The danger, incidentally, was almost nearly self-inflicted. From the band's early days of getting by on heroin, cheap wine, and friendly ladies to frontman Axl Rose's antics like showing up late for shows and inciting a riot at one of its gigs in St. Louis. On stage, Rose would sport a Charles Manson shirt and a kilt. Guitarist Slash and his trademark black top hat, plus the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of fellow guitarist Izzy Stradlin prior to the release of the Use Your Illusion records. Back in the day, the band didn't care how it acted or what people thought. That made them rock legends and able to sell out stadiums upon returning to the music scene following an absences that lasted decades.\n\nSince 1984, GWAR has built a cult-like following with its unique brand of thrash metal and hardcore punk. Of course, the band's true appeal is its visual presence. Each member sports a mythical, gory, and grotesque costume from another realm with a science-fiction base. Notably, co-founder and lead singer Oderus Urungus, originally portrayed by late lead singer David Brockie. Its songs and mildly inappropriate stage performances have a certain sense of camp, complete with sexual musings and satire on topics such as politics and pop culture. Of course, the band has generated plenty of controversy over the years.\n\nThe misconception by casual rock fans is that Jethro Tull is a person. No, that's not the case. Of course, lead singer and multi-versatile musician Ian Anderson is the group's undisputed leader and most recognizable member. Behind him, many musicians have come and gone throughout the decades, but Anderson, with flute in hand, the creator of some of progressive rock's most celebrated works (\"Aqualung,\" \"Thick as a Brick,\" \"Locomotive Breath\"), has been the mainstay.\n\nA pioneer of the post-punk genre, Joy Division started out with a harder sound. The moodiness of frontman Ian Curtis offered a more melodic vibe that was followed by the likes of The Cure and The Smiths. However, Curtis' demeanor had plenty to do with a myriad of personal issues, plus dealing with epilepsy and depression. Making him one of the more misinterpreted musicians of the time, who struggled to deal with the group's rising success. Sadly, Curtis took his own life in 1980, at just 23 years old.\n\nThere's usually a modest level of mystery and uncertainty that comes with acts from the experimental electronica genre. This Swedish brother-sister duo of Karin and Olof Dreijer did their best to stand out during its run from 1999-2014. From a musical standpoint, the band was highly regarded, with Deep Cuts from 2003 and 2006's Silent Shout â€” two of their most acclaimed albums. However, the pair could be reclusive. They didn't do live shows until 2005, rarely gave interviews, and participated in stage photo shoots wearing masks.\n\nIn some form or another, Mr. Bungle is still finding places to play to this day â€” notably on festival circuits. Those live shows remain raucous events, complete with costumes, masks, and plenty of bouncing around on stage while delivering the band's alternative/funk metal sound, which also features various elements of jazz and ska. Frontman Mike Patton, perhaps best known as the face of Faith No More, has been joined by Anthrax's Scott Ian and legendary thrash metal drummer Dave Lombardo (Slayer, Misfits, Testament) on Mr. Bungle projects.\n\nThroughout this legendary band's existence, there's been a sense of mystery and fascination among its fans. From the rumors of dumping acid on to the stage to set up their amps or the making of the Wish You Were Here album, the Floyd has certainly built mystical legacy. Notably, in the early years with regards to guitarist/singer Syd Barrett. The \"madcap genius\" is one of rock's most enigmatic â€” and tragic â€” figures. Meanwhile, pompous former leader Roger Waters did all he could to drive the band into the ground, while soft-spoken members Richard Wright and Nick Mason never seemed to get the credit they rightfully deserved.\n\nCall it punk or metal, whatever, the raunchiness and destruction that the Plasmatics displayed was its calling card. Fronted by the obscenely proud former stripper Wendy O. Williams, who was once charged with public indecency during a performance. Williams and various musicians employed behind her were all about showmanship and not really known for the music, though others like the Ramones and Motorhead considered the group a significant influence. Amid all the controversy and attention the Plasmatics drew, Williams was a troubled woman. Sadly, she took her own life in April 1998.\n\nLed by eccentric and extremely talented bassist Les Claypool, Primus stayed alternative even when the genre went mainstream in the 1990s. With his slap-happy bass playing, Claypool and Co. have delivered their brand of alternative funk and metal, with progressive tendencies, to critical acclaim, which included three Grammy Award nominations. Never really caring what the establishment thought, this quirky trio has delivered such innovative offerings as \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver,\" \"Tommy the Cat\" and \"My Name is Mud.\"\n\nThere was plenty of musical experimentation going on in the late 1960s and '70s. Then, there's The Residents. A hodge-podge of avant-garde, experimental and conceptual pop can probably sum up The Residents' sound, which also included the introduction of multimedia, notably the CD-ROM, to the production side. Over the years, prominent artists such as George Harrison, Les Claypool, and Mark Mothersbaugh have been tied to the act, but highly respected musician/composer Hardy Fox was the most dominant force for years. Beginning with 1974's Meet the Residents, the band has put out more than 40 studio albums and 26 live records.\n\nPart of the nu metal sound that rose to prominence in the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Slipknot managed to separate itself from others in the genre by incorporating an aggressive sound, which also featured slick grooves. Experimental and conceptual creativity resulted in 10 Grammy nominations and one win. However, the band's mystique has usually drawn from high-impact live shows and, of course, masked or painted-face band members, who also sport jump suits. Some controversial lyrics â€” mostly violent in nature â€” and the tragic deaths of bass player Paul Gray and former drummer Joey Jordison have also added to the group's complex legacy.\n\nIn addition to being one of the most creative and musically sound alternative/progressive rock/metal acts, Tool might be the most reclusive. And not necessarily in the sense the four members of this four-time Grammy outfit live like hermits. They just seem to value their privacy more than anything else. Casual fans of the band might consider versatile frontman Maynard James Keenan a bit self-absorbed because he rarely gives interviews, but he's actually quite active off stage as a producer, actor, and vineyard owner. In the end, the band's aggressive sound and abrasive and socially encompassing lyrics have made them one of the most successful hard rock bands of all time.\n\nPerhaps the major intrigue regarding Ween is its overall sound. Undisputedly alternative, there are various elements of funk, metal, punk, and even some soul and country. That's a lot to digest, but Gene and Dean Ween (a.k.a. Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo, respectively) and Co. were consistently one of the most creative and ingenious groups during the 1990s and into the 2000s. Not to mention the Ween's allegiance to Boognish, the Demon God that has pretty much fueled the band throughout its existence."
