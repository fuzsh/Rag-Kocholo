        "meta_description": "Hailed as the new Beatles but \"mismanaged and exploited beyond the bounds of human decency\" Badfinger's thankless career drove two members to take their own lives. Badfinger could have been huge. What’s more, the band’s connections with The Beatles once earned them the tag of ‘the new Fab\n\nFour’. But instead, despite writing and recording some wonderfully memorable music, Badfinger went down in the annals of rock history for all the wrong\n\nreasons. Most people who remember the band today will probably point to the fact that two key members took their own lives.\n\nThe story of Badfinger is probably one of the most tragic in rock’n’roll. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong – twice– while their occasional triumphs over adversity never seemed to bring them their rightful reward. When Harry Nilsson first heard Without You (his future worldwide No.1 hit single), written by\n\nBadfinger’s Pete Ham and Tom Evans, he assumed it was a Beatles song. It was an understandable mistake, given that Paul McCartney had taken the band under his wing, signed them to The Beatles’ Apple label, and even written a hit for them in Come And Get It. Badfinger also backed George Harrison on his Bangladesh concerts. But their connection with The Beatles would become a double-edged sword.\n\nMy special guest this week is singer, songwriter and guitarist JOEY MOLLAND - Badfinger's sole surviving member.\n\nDuring our chat, Joey discusses his life and career in the music industry. He talks about his early days in Liverpool, where he was part of a tight-knit\n\nmusical community that included some of the most famous bands of the time, such as The Beatles and The Searchers. He talked about his experiences playing in various bands and making records, including joining The Ivey's, which later became Badfinger.\n\nJoey talks about the success of Badfinger in America, particularly their hit song 'Come and Get It', which was written by Paul McCartney. He also discusses the band's formation and later successes with songs such as No Matter What and Day After Day. However, despite the band's success, Joey walks us through \n\nthe struggles the band faced with management and financial ruin. He still believes that \"whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\"\n\nToday Joey Molland continues to perform under the name Joey Molland's Badfinger and is proud of the band's legacy of hits. He chats about his latest solo album, 'Be True to Yourself', which features collaborations with notable musicians such as Mark Hudson, a Grammy-winning\n\nproducer who has worked with bands like Aerosmith and Rainbow. The album also features contributions from his friends Julian Lennon and The Monkees' Micky Dolenz.\n\n\"Be True to Yourself,\" is Joey Molland's sixth solo album and the first in seven years. It definitely has echoes of John, Paul, George and sometimes even Ringo. \n\nTo learn more about Joey Molland, check out my website https://abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nYou may also like to take a look at the 1997 book \"Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger,” by Dan Matovina https://www.amazon.com.au/Without-You-Tragic-Story-Badfinger/dp/0965712222\n\nPlease get in touch with me with any comments, feedback or guest suggestions - sandy@abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode.",
