        "text": "Joey Molland: Liverpool To Memphis chronicles the remarkable life and career of Badfingerâs sole surviving original member, Joey Molland.\n\nAs a teen, Joey left his hometown of Liverpool for a successful stint with the internationally-acclaimed Gary Walker and the Rain, then joined the Iveys â Pete Ham, Tommy Evans and Mike Gibbins â on the very day in July 1969 that they changed their name to Badfinger.\n\nIt would be Paul McCartney who gave the group its first break, writing âCome and Get Itâ and asking them to record it for the soundtrack of the film The Magic Christian. It went on to become a top-fifteen single worldwide, as did the groupâs next three releases: âNo Matter Whatâ, âDay After Dayâ and âBaby Blueâ â all released on The Beatlesâ Apple Records.\n\nDespite Harry Nilsson reaching Number One in the US in 1971 with Badfingerâs âWithout Youâ, litigation brought the band to a virtual standstill by 1974, contributing to the tragic suicides of Peter Ham in 1975 and Tommy Evans in 1983. Joey worked sporadically with Mike Gibbins until Gibbins' passing in 2005.\n\nIn late 2013, Badfingerâs 1971 recording of âBaby Blueâ was used during the pivotal last scene of the season finale of the AMC hit series Breaking Bad, renewing worldwide interest in the band and leading to a dramatic rise in streams and sales of the bandâs catalog.\n\nMolland's latest CD, 'Return To Memphis', was recorded in Memphis, the birthplace of the music that originally inspired him.\n\nJoey Molland: Liverpool To Memphis is directed, edited and produced by John Anderson and includes appearances by Billy J. Kramer (\"Little Children\") and Freda Kelly (\"Good Ol' Freda\") Executive Producer is Kevin Allodi, CEO and Co-Founder of Philo Broadcasting, Inc.\n\nBreaking Bad Good for Badfinger's Baby Blue\n\nPhilo Broadcasting and John Andersonâs documentary feature on the life and career of Badfingerâs sole surviving member JOEY MOLLAND: LIVERPOOL TO MEMPHIS is expected to be released early 2014. Here are two clips from the film:\n\nLive: 'Vampire Wedding' and 'No More' (10:00)\n\nJoey Molland At the Hotel Sax in Chicago\n\nRough Cut Screening\n\nA rough cut of JOEY MOLLAND: LIVERPOOL TO MEMPHIS was shown at the 2013 Chicago International Music and Movies Festival, followed by a Q&A with Joey Molland, Kevin Allodi and John Anderson. John also moderated the festivalâs kickoff event, âA Night With Van Dyke Parksâ, and participated in the Festival event âThe Films of John Andersonâ, moderated by Frank Haney.\n\nA Night With Van Dyke Parks\n\n(L-R: John Anderson, Van Dyke Parks)"
