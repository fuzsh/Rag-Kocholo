        "text": "The story of Badfinger is one of rock history’s sadder ones, with legal and managerial problems that robbed the band of millions and led to the suicides of two key members. But for guitarist/singer Joey Molland, there’s still a lot of good to remember. The sole survivor of Badfinger’s classic lineup, he performs tonight at Kowloon Restaurant in Saugus.\n\n“The band was a great time for me, and that period with Pete, Tommy and Mike was one of the happiest of my life,” Molland said by phone from his Minnesota home, referring to deceased band mates Pete Ham, Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins. “So I never looked on Badfinger as a sad thing. It was very sad that the guys went on to do what they did, but being onstage was always what I really loved. Even if you listen to the old tapes, you can hear how much I was enjoying myself.”\n\nLiverpool, England-born Molland, 62, was the last to join the classic Badfinger lineup in 1970, after they’d signed to the Beatles’ Apple label and had their first hit single, the Paul McCartney-written “Come and Get It.” Molland added heavier guitars, and Badfinger helped create the Beatles-inspired sound now known as power pop. But unlike their contemporaries Big Star and Todd Rundgren, Badfinger had the actual Beatles in their corner, and managed a string of hit singles: “Day After Day” (which George Harrison produced and played on), “No Matter What” and “Baby Blue.” Also in 1971, Harry Nilsson had a No. 1 hit with a Badfinger album track, “Without You.”\n\n“We just did straight-ahead songs but played them with a bit of attitude,” Molland said. “People were surprised to see us onstage, because it was a lot more jammy and riffy. We didn’t even play all the hits. We hardly ever did “Day After Day” because it had so many overdubs. That was the one problem with the George period.”\n\nBut Molland’s current group will play that song at the Kowloon, along with many rare album tracks.\n\nBadfinger’s problems began after Apple folded, and management dealings left them with no income from their hits. Worse, lawsuits led to the band’s best overall album, 1974’s “Wish You Were Here,” getting pulled from stores just weeks after its release (it’s since been reissued). The band spent two years in court, draining their finances and killing their career momentum. A frustrated Ham hanged himself in 1975; Evans did the same after a failed reunion in 1983. Gibbins died of natural causes in 2005.\n\n“If the lawsuits hadn’t happened, we would have still been a good band,” Molland said. “We had no reason to break up. Nobody was a big druggie and we were all writing and playing, doing what we were supposed to do.\n\n“I think Peter would have gone onto bigger and better things. He’d probably be into writing musicals. There was never any innuendo in Pete’s songs, you always knew what they were about and that sort of writer always seems to go onto the West End. Tommy would have searched the rest of his life for another hit song, that was always really important to him.”\n\nContrary to most Beatles histories, Molland says that Badfinger’s name came from Beatles associate Neil Aspinall, not John Lennon.\n\n“People assume we were closer to them,” Molland said, “but we really dealt more with the people that were around the Beatles. I will say that John was a very civil guy, and he always complimented the Badfinger lads.”"
