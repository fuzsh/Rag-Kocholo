        "text": "Millions of fans and musicians can — and often do — declare that The Beatles changed their lives\n\nBut very few can discuss the impact of the Fab Four with more authority and first-hand experience than Joey Molland, who headlines the San Diego 2015 Beatles Fair at Queen Bee’s Art & Cultural Center on Saturday, March 28. (Hours and ticket information appear at the conclusion of this article.)\n\nMolland, 67, is the sole surviving member of Badfinger. As The Iveys (which quickly changed its name to Badfinger), the English quartet was the first band signed to Apple Records, the label founded by The Beatles in 1968.\n\nBadfinger went on to sell 14 million albums worldwide and scored three Top 10 U.S. hits between 1970 and 1972, including “Come and Get It” (written by Paul McCartney), “No Matter What” and “Day After Day.” Molland and his band mates also performed on “All Things Must Pass,” George Harrison’s epic 1970 triple-album, as well as at the Harrison- and Ravi Shankar-led “Concert for Bangladesh” benefit shows at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 1971.\n\nBadfinger, “No Matter What”\n\nHarrison, in turn, played a slide guitar part on “Day After Day,” as well as co-producing Badfinger’s second album, “Straight Up.” Meanwhile, Molland and fellow Badfinger member Tom Evans were featured playing guitars on “I Don’t Want to Be a Soldier,” a song on John Lennon’s 1971 album, “Imagine.”\n\n“I never really looked at The Beatles in the sense that they’d moved on, from Liverpool to London, and progressed,” said Molland, who — like all four Beatles — is a Liverpool native.\n\n“I simply looked at The Beatles as having become the absolute greatest four-piece rock ‘n’ roll band in the world. To this day, I’ve never heard anybody better than them, doing any kind of song. And I haven’t heard singers like those guys. I haven’t heard anyone sing harmony like that. I just never heard anybody better. And that’s what’s enthralling to me about The Beatles — their music, and the life and fire in it. They kept it all alive and burning.”\n\nFond memories of George & John\n\nRecalling Badfinger’s separate recording sessions with Harrison and Lennon, Molland said: “George was mellow, until he went wild, and then he wasn’t mellow! John would raise the room temperature, just by walking in. He had ferocious energy, like a man on fire. John was really sweet to us, and Yoko (Ono) was lovely as well.\n\n“George would go around to each musician and make a point of showing each what he was doing. He’d sing the arrangement to them and talk about the part they were going to play. John didn’t do that. He just sang the song and we’d learn the chords. He knew we could grab the music quickly. We were familiar with every style of music that The Beatles were. We grew up on the next street from those guys. We listened to the same music, went to the same record stores, played the same clubs. We had the same experiences in Liverpool as them.”\n\nThat the stories of The Beatles and Badfinger are intertwined is a matter of record. So is the fact that two of its members, Evans and Ham, each committed suicide by hanging themselves in, respectively 1983 and 1975. The band’s drummer, Mike Gibbins, died of a brain aneurism in 2005. Ham, who was was only 27 when he killed himself, wrote the song “Without You,” which became a worldwide hit for Harry Nilsson in 1972 and Mariah Carey in 1994,\n\nBadfinger’s real-life tale of doom inspired a 1997 book, “Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger,” by Dan Matovina. Ham left behind a sucide note in 1975, specifically blaming the band’s manager, Stan Polley. “I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better,” Ham wrote, adding: “Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me.”\n\nLives & fortunes lost\n\nIn his book, Mantovina discloses how Polley put Badfinger’s money into a holding account that he — not the band’s members — controlled. To further compound members, the legally complicated dissolution of Apple Records prevented Badfinger’s members from receiving any royalties from Apple until 1985.\n\n“It all came to a head in 1974, after four years of Number One records around the world,” Molland said by phone from his home in Minneapolis, where he has lived since 1983.\n\n“We did five or six tours — a total of about 600 shows — over those four years, and and we never had any money. We signed a $3 million record deal (in late 1971) with Warner Bros. and they gave us $600,000 (as an advance), and we still didn’t have any cash. It went all to our manager. I couldn’t even buy a tape recorder.”\n\nHe sighed in frustration.\n\n“Peter Ham should have been a millionaire by (1975),” Molland said. “He’d written four or five great songs that were international hits. The royalties were in the $200,000 range, every couple of months. The checks would go to the manager, and that’s the last we’d see of them. Warner Bros. sued us, Our (1974) album, ‘Wish You Were Here,’ fell off the charts. The most we ever got was $1,250 a month in salary. They gave us no support or direction.”\n\nBadfinger imploded, briefly regrouped after adding a new member, then imploded again. By the early 1980s, Molland and Gibbins were leading rival editions of Badfinger. A 1985 U.S. court settlement finally resolved the many legal issues that had sealed Badfinger’s fate. Royalties now go to Molland and the estates of the band’s three deceased members.\n\n‘No time for rock stars’\n\n“It’s a shame Pete did what he did,” Molland said of Ham’s suicide. “I really believed he would have had a great (solo) career, if he had held on a little longer. It’s a sad story, this band.”\n\nThe settlement has enabled Molland to be a fulltime musician since 1985. Apart from making one album with the short-lived band Natural Gas in 1976, he spent the next decade doing an array of day jobs to support his wife and two sons.\n\n“I laid carpet at a department store in Los Angeles,” recalled Molland, whose latest solo album, “Return to Memphis” came out last year. “Then I installed carpets in people’s houses. Shortly after that, I got a job with an old friend who taught me to be a carpenter, of sorts,, hanging doors, putting up trim and dong crown moldings. That was fine with me. My boys were born in 1979 and ‘80. I just kept going to work. And I kept writing songs, and I still do.\n\n“Doing all those days jobs was OK with me. I wasn’t depressed. I’ve never been a rock star or in a ‘rock star’ band. I’ve got no time for rock stars; I just am not interested in it. I love bands and music, and I love to see them perform. But when they bring that (contentious) stuff off the stage with them, that’s not the real world. It’s just weird for me. If I needed money, I got a (day) job. I did that before Badfinger, when I worked on the docks in Liverpool, and after Badfinger.”\n\nWhat’s welcome, not weird, for Molland is to appear at Beatles-related events — as he will here next Saturday — to sing and to discuss the band that irrevocably changed his life.\n\n“That’s what people what to hear about, and that’s what I do,” he said. “I tell my story and I play the (Badfinger) songs. The memories come flooding back to me.”\n\n2015 San Diego Beatles Fair\n\nWith: Joey Molland of Badfinger, Baja Bugs, Bart Mendoza, Dave Humphries Band\n\nWhen: Noon to 11 p.m., Saturday, March 28\n\nWhere: Queen Bee’s Art & Cultural Center, 3925 Ohio St., North Park\n\nTickets: $22 (adults), $10 (kids, 10-16), free (kids 9 and under)\n\nPhone: (619) 255-5147\n\nOnline: sandiegobeatlesfair.com"
