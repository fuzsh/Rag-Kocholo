        "text": "“hardcore power pop… genuine talent” – All Music\n\nFrom their legendary lineup, Joey Molland continues the unforgettable legacy of Badfinger. Badfinger was one of the original signings to the Beatles’ Apple Records. They had their first hit single with a Paul McCartney-penned song, “Come and Get It”, which went to #7 on the U.S. charts. Badfinger followed this with their own compositions “No Matter What”, “Day After Day” (produced by George Harrison), and “Baby Blue”, which went to #8, #4 and #14 respectively.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 Molland and Badfinger enjoyed an incredible run with this string of hits. During Molland’s association with Apple, he made guest appearances on two George Harrison albums, All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh, and the John Lennon album Imagine.\n\nMolland left Badfinger in late 1974 due to disagreements over management. In 1975, he joined with Jerry Shirley (formerly of Humble Pie) and formed a group called Natural Gas. The band released their self-titled album in 1976 and enjoyed a successful tour with Peter Frampton the following year. A general lack of organization led to the band’s demise late in 1977.\n\nMolland’s career since 1983 has been with various rock groups and duos, and performing tours under the Badfinger name or as “Joey Molland’s Badfinger”. Molland was instrumental in releasing a 1974 live recording of Badfinger in 1991, called Day After Day: Live, which received mixed critical reactions due to overdubbing and a rearranged track order.\n\nMolland’s solo recordings have been well received. His first, After The Pearl, was released in 1983. His second, The Pilgrim, was released in 1992. His third, This Way Up, was released in 2001. His fourth album, Return To Memphis, was released in 2013. His latest album. 2021’s Be True To Yourself, features the single ″Rainy Day Man.”"
