        "text": "There are few stories in music more tragic than Badfinger.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride that is their history has just about everything you could imagine: management problems, inter-band turmoil, financial disaster, tragic deaths and some of the truly best music ever made.\n\nIt’s another case of the old cliche of truth being stranger than fiction. Words like bittersweet, heartbreaking, triumphant and countless others come to mind and probably still don’t quite provide adequate description.\n\n“Well, it was a little of all of those things,” offered guitarist Joey Molland, who’ll bring his version of Badfinger to the Sellersville Theater Sunday night at 7:30 p.m.\n\nMolland, the only original member of the group still active, has kept the band and its music alive despite a long saga of roadblocks and challenges that might have brought things to an end.\n\n“A couple times I did pack it in and get a job,” said Molland Wednesday afternoon from his home in Minnesota. “But then someone would come along and offer us a record or a tour. No matter what music is like, it beats the hell out of laying rug. It doesn’t beat the hell out of the steady paycheck, but I guess you have to sacrifice some things,” he said.\n\n“My wife Kathy was always really behind me, really encouraging. So it always seemed to work itself out OK.”\n\nMolland’s positive outlook has helped keep a lot of Badfinger’s rough career in perspective.\n\nTheir history is virtually impossible to summarize in short form, but the group – Molland, with principal singer/songwriters Pete Ham and Tom Evans, with Mike Gibbins on drums – was the first to be signed by The Beatles’ Apple Records. Music fans will already know about the troubled financial, litigious demise of Apple. Badfinger didn’t escape the fall out.\n\nAgain, in another chapter that is difficult to cover briefly, the financial side of Badfinger’s world would become nothing short of disastrous when their manager, Stan Polley, swindled them out of money that was rightfully theirs, leaving them with nothing after working near non-stop from 1969 through 1974.\n\nUltimately, the strain of the managerial and financial woes would take their toll on Ham and Evans, who both committed suicide, Ham in 1975 and Evans in 1983.\n\nIt’s the classic story of rock’s younger years when a band, whose primary concern was making music, could fall prey to a manager whose primary concern was making money, no matter what the cost or who was hurt.\n\n“The Badfinger thing is, the guy stole all the money. What else can you say?” asked Molland. “So in ’74 when we found that out, we froze all the royalties, Tommy and I did. Years later, of course, we got that money. We’ve been getting our royalties since ’85 when we went to court in London and won. We finally started to get our royalties,” he said. “We all started getting paid then, so over the years that’s more than made up for the money that the guy messed over.”\n\nDespite what was happening inside and outside the band, Badfinger was still able to create some of the finest power pop ever made. “The outside things, they came into the music a little bit, stuff like ‘Apple in My Eye’ or ‘Give It Up,’ so we did have a little of it in there,” said Molland. “It really didn’t have much to do with the music as the final thing, though. The music was where we escaped to,” he said.\n\n“The music was what we were trying to do. We were trying to make good stuff. We had our heroes and we were trying to live up to their level in terms of writing songs and being serious about the music and about the world we were living in.”\n\nThat philosophy landed some work with a few of the biggest names in music. While they were signed to The Beatles’ label, they soon found themselves working with George Harrison on his landmark, 3-LP “All Things Must Pass” and playing on John Lennon’s masterpiece, “Imagine.”\n\n“George Harrison and the Beatles were probably the biggest band in the world at the time, and probably still are, so it was really magical to be invited to those things,” said Molland. “It was very difficult not to be an out and out fan and just start blubbering. At the same time, something inside me made me get it together, pay attention, learn the songs and play,” he explained.\n\n“Once we were doing that, it was just a dead normal thing. We were doing our job – making records, which is a great thing to do. It was afterwards, when you realize where you been and what you’d been doing; George would come out and talk to you like you were one of his pals. He was so nice and encouraging. They really like our band, they thought we were really great and it really mystified us.”\n\nAfter the group helped Harrison daily for three weeks for “All Things Must Pass” during the summer of 1970, they got a call from a representative for John Lennon asking if they’d like to sit in on his recording session and contribute to another Beatle’s solo work.\n\n“They acted like we were doing him a favor,” Molland said, still with some awe in his voice before breaking into an infectious laugh. “To be playing with John Lennon was really stunning to me. This guy was like such a hero to me. The energy level he would put out when he entered a room, it was like the temperature would go up. It was just amazing.”\n\nBoth experiences left an impact. Molland has started a production company with his son, Joe, a recording engineer, and the two have just begun their first project together.\n\n“I still use a lot of the things I learned about recording with them today,” he said. “Those arrangement techniques, the form of songs, the way songs go, stuff we’d been practicing all our lives was really solidified by those guys. There was a nice brevity about their arrangements. It was the song that was important, not the guitar solo. But the guitar solo was an integral part of the arrangement. Those were valuable lessons.”\n\nThe chance for Molland to share a little of the “lessons” he’s learned along the way is something he cherishes. There’s an inherent pride in his voice in the way he’s kept Badfinger’s spirit alive – Mike Gibbins, the only other surviving original member is no longer in the music business.\n\nHe’s quick to point out that getting a chance to keep the music going he, Ham, Evans and Gibbins created is nothing short of magical.\n\n“I’m still working now. I get more gigs than I ever did,” Molland laughed. “I do loads of shows. I’m doing 60 to 80 shows this year. We get a good cross-section of an audience, there is no doubt about that. We try and play a real rock show for them. There’s still a bit of looseness about it, a good feel. And we aim to keep playing. As long as we can keep singing the songs, we’ll keep playing. When I find I can’t sing, I’m not going to do it any more. I’m not going to embarrass myself or anybody else warbling through ‘No Matter What,’ know what I mean? Because these are songs you have to be able to sing. They are full tilt songs. That’s part of the criteria that keeps us going. We can actually still play. And I love it.”"
