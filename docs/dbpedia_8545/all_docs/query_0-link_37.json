        "text": "It Was Fifty Years Ago Today: A Tribute To The Beatles is a tour starring Todd Rundgren, Christopher Cross, Badfinger featuring Joey Molland, Jay DeMarcus of Rascal Flatts, Denny Laine (founding member of The Moody Blues and Wings) and Jason Scheff (Chicago’s lead singer from 1985-2016). Within this touring show, these artists will be performing their hits plus selected songs from The Beatles’ albums Rubber Soul and Revolver. In turn, you get to hear classics like “I Saw The Light,” “Hello It’s Me,” “Sailing,” “Ride Like The Wind,” “No Matter What,” and “Go Now” alongside plenty of Beatles classics.\n\nThe aforementioned Joey Molland joined Badfinger after a successful run with Gary Walker & The Rain. After leaving Badfinger in 1974, he would form Natural Gas with Humble Pie’s Jerry Shirley, which led to a big tour alongside Peter Frampton. He would ultimately rejoin Badfinger in 1978, recording a pair of albums alongside Tom Evans, and has single-handedly kept Badfinger brand alive for the past few decades. If that isn’t enough, Molland also holds the distinction of playing on albums by George Harrison and John Lennon, beyond having worked alongside Paul McCartney via Badfinger.\n\nOn February 23, 2022, I had the pleasure of speaking with Joey Molland via Zoom, as embedded below. Beyond It Was Fifty Years Ago Today: A Tribute To The Beatles, we spoke about his long-term career plans, hobbies outside of music, his hometown of Liverpool, and why he moved to Minnesota. More on Molland and the It Was Fifty Years Ago Today tour can be found by clicking here, here, here and here.\n\nTweet"
