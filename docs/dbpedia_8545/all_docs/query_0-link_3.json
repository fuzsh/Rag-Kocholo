        "text": "Thanks for the info! I'll be checking this out. I'm anxious to hear these songs sound better than how I know them. At this point, I think any improvement is a big improvement.\n\nReally a pity this album didn't get more attention when it came out. It was a great combination of talent and some great performances.\n\nIt manages to sound polished and spontaneous at the same time.\n\nI find Joey's comments on the website about the album pretty interesting. I do wonder how much better the album might have been if Mal Evans had produced it. The reviewer on the original post pointed out \"Dark Cloud\"--it's probably my favorite song on the album.\n\nFrom the It's About Music website:\n\nThe Natural Gas album was recorded at Crystal Studios in Los Angeles and produced by legendary Mountain member Felix Papalardi. \"Felix was really nice,\" says Joey, \"a real sociable guy and talented fellow. As far as a producer went, we really wanted Mal Evans to do it. But the label wanted Felix Papalardi, the bass player from Mountain who’d done Cream and all that – the label wanted him to do it. Apparently Felix wanted to do the project as well, so that was that. I think Mal was pretty disappointed actually.\"\n\nFor anyone interested in the newly remastered Natural Gas CD, you should know that it was originally released last year on Renaissance Records who did such a horrible job on both the music and the artwork that when I released it again this year I offered anyone who had purchased the Renaissance version to contact me for a free replacement - no matter where they bought it - even downloads would be replaced.\n\nAnd to clear up all speculation, the original master was indeed lost in a fire so I had to use my own copy of the vinyl which has always been in great shape. I have the ability to make some pretty cool sounding \"needle-drops\" (as they say) and this may be my finest achievement. The artwork is exactly like the original as well. Since this is one of my all-time favorite albums I had to do a good job - even if it was just for my own listening pleasure.\n\nFYI - Joey Molland now owns the master and I licensed it from him for 3 years (at least).\n\nBe careful at all Internet stores - if you see the corresponding album cover (at Amazon for instance) and it looks horrible - then that's the wrong CD to buy. Look for the 2010 release. But my distributor screwed it up at Amazon and it doesn't say \"ItsAboutMusic.com\" as the label. Safest way to get the right CD is to buy it from my site - ItsAboutMusic.com - along with the new Mark Clarke CD which is extremely cool.\n\nIf you need to contact me directly - [email protected]\n\nTake care."
