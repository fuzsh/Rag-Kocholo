        "text": "I was driving home from work the other evening and stopped at a convenience store to grab a pack of smokes and something to drink I had a moment before I took off again, I wanted to listen to something I haven’t heard in a long time so I dug out my CD case out of my rear junk storage of my Ford Ranger, (extended cab).\n\nThumbing through about a hundred or more CD’s I came across my Badfinger collection page, I was and still am a big fan of Badfinger since I was 13, so I pulled there third album out (Straight Up) and popped it in my deck.\n\nimage removed\n\nI forgot how well produced this album was and how many tasty hooks every song seems to have took me back a bit and remember buying these LP albums in the cut out section at Peaches records in Florida and my buddies and we would think, Wow what a great deal we just got for $1.99!\n\nI still have them in a box someplace after thirty something or more years!\n\nGood stuff to sing to and play along with for cover 70's stuff.\n\nRead some history and tragedy of this band > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badfinger\n\nimage removed\n\nI was about 9 in San Jose CA when Straight Up came out. It was extremely rare for my parents to allow me to have an album (or even a single) but I sure wanted that one just for the cover art.\n\nMy mother squashed that one citing it as 'obscene'.\n\nI grew up and bought it on my own and loved it. I know nothing of the band except that I believe I read somewhere that Paul produced them.\n\nThanks for the link. I am going to read it right now but I hope it isn't too sad.\n\nThe Badfinger album Straight Up is timeless and at the same time nostalgic for me. When I hear these songs I am almost transported back to the times we had with this in the 8 track.... damn... those were the best days of my life.\n\nWow... I feel old now... thanks.\n\nStraight Up was out of print for a while and almost impossible to find a copy of at one time.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Up_(album)\n\nWow. That article paints a much more complex picture involving Ham's suicide. In a book about the Beatles, I read a much more simpler but more perplexing account. It said that Badfinger never received any royalties from Apple Records. This appears to be true. Yet that account left out where they got enough income to survive.\n\nThis has the got to be the saddest rock-n-roll story of some 'almost' famous folks. I'm sure there are some unsung stories that are much darker.\n\nI liked all of their Apples recordings. I not sure if I know much about their music after Apple.\n\nWhen I came down with GAS and started teaching myself to play the guitar a couple years ago, \"No Matter What\" was the first song I learned.\n\nGreat band. I remember having to buy the import LP's of their early albums because you couldn't find them stateside.\n\nIMO, this one may be their best, but it's difficult for me to listen to anymore given the tragedies that followed....\n\nimage removed"
