        "text": "Cher returns to home she shared with Sonny Bono\n\nApparently, Cher can turn back time. The singer-actress recently took a trip down Memory Lane, by way of Laurel Canyon Drive.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Cher returned to the Hollywood home she shared with the late Sonny Bono in the mid-1960s. The celebrity gossip site reports that the Oscar winner randomly showed up to the address with two assistants and took a quick tour of the home except for a bedroom that was occupied.\n\nIt was the first time Cher had been back to the residence since 1965.\n\nBono was married to Cher from 1964 to 1975. The couple's only child, a daughter named Chastity, was born in 1969. He underwent female-to-male gender transition and is now known as Chaz.\n\nSonny Bono came to Palm Springs in the 1980s and served as the city's mayor from 1988 to 1992. He was then elected to Congress from the 44th District and served in the House of Representatives until his death in a skiing accident in 1998."
