        "text": "With more than 20 studio albums under her belt and a reported net worth of $360m (£286m), it's no surprise that Cher has amassed an incredible property portfolio. She's made her money work hard too, investing in houses and often selling them on for a profit. However, she may wish she'd held on to some of them, including the Miami getaway she bought for just $1.5 million (£1.2m) that has just hit the market at $42.5 million (£34m). Let’s take a look around...\n\nWith a career spanning seven decades, the multi-talented performer has been in the property game a while too. She bought the waterfront Miami manse in 1993 for $1.5 million (£1.2m) and nearly tripled her money when she sold it for $4.3 million (£3.5m) three years later. But now the very same pad has just come on the market and is priced at a staggering $42.5 million (£34m). We bet she wishes she could 'turn back time'....Let's look around...\n\nThe six-bedroom, nine-bathroom house on La Gorce Island, off the coast of Miami Beach, has undergone a few changes over the years since Cher was mistress, of course. According to The Wall Street Journal, the present owners are James Eaton, president of a Canadian private holding company and his wife Cecily. Reportedly, they spent the last three years renovating the place, raising the ceilings and converting a terrace into a dining room and sitting area. With its dual staircase and arched doorways, the results are spectacular.\n\nThe Goddess of Pop would no doubt approve of the bathrooms too, which have been fitted out with a two-person central shower, a statement marble freestanding bath and plenty of living and lounging space. Cher sold the Mediterranean-style pad to Calvin Klein co-founder, Barry K Schwartz, in 1996 and she's been busy buying and selling ever since. But one of her homes isn't selling...\n\nCher bought this Italian Renaissance-style estate for just shy of $3 million (£2.4m) in September 1989, according to property records, and spent nearly five years transforming it into her perfect home. The sprawling 13,200 square-foot mansion sits on approximately 1.7 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean from its setting on the Pacific Coast Highway, and is considered one of the most sought-after areas of Malibu.\n\nAccording to reports, LA-based interior designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard was engaged to create the “Venetian-meets-Moorish” building, which boasts arched windows and doors with unrivalled ocean views. The ‘Do You Believe’ singer first listed the seven-bedroom property, which includes a gatehouse which doubles as a guesthouse, in 2009 for $45 million (£36m), and there were rumours in 2013 that Beyoncé and Jay-Z had snapped it up. But this turned out not to be true.\n\nAs famous for her striking looks as for her talent, the house includes a state-of-the-art dressing room, as well as a show-stopping climate-controlled wig room, which according to the 2002 book The Cher Scrapbook, displays almost 100 of the singer’s hairpieces. The primary suite also boasts two closets (one doubling at a panic room), an indoor-outdoor gym and a private cinema.\n\nThe singer was hoping for some serious profit when she then put it on the market in October 2022 for a staggering $85 million (£67.7m). But almost a year on, she is still yet to sell the magnificent mansion, despite having dropped the price by a whopping $10 million (£8m) in March 2023. Her current home, it remains the glittering jewel in her property portfolio.\n\nHaving bought and sold a whole host of properties over the last 60 years, it seemed Cher was finally settled in her dream home in Malibu. But it seems she's keen to move on. With a new Christmas album reveal in September 2023, will the star steal Mariah Carey's crown and have a new home for the holidays? We can't wait to find out!\n\nRead more... Cher's property portfolio journey from humble beginnings in California to Beverly Hills and London mansions...\n\nCher has bought and sold some amazing real estate in her time, from a humble apartment in London to a tropical mansion in Hawaii. Her long-term home has been the magnificent Malibu mansion she custom-built in the nineties, which she has been trying to sell on and off for years. It is currently on the market for $75 million (£60m), which includes a $10 million (£8m) discount (scroll down for more info). But let’s go back to the beginning…\n\nIn 1962, at 16 years old, Cher met fellow performer Sonny Bono. Sonny introduced Cher to producer Phil Spector and they sang backing vocals on a number of hits and the couple soon became a pop duo, releasing a number of smash hits. They also became a couple, eventually separating in 1975. In 1971, Cher went solo and release her album Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves, with which she went to number one in the charts with the title track.\n\nCher went on to establish a solo career of her own and is often referred to as the Goddess of Pop. She went on to have a residency at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and in 2018 started her seventh world tour. Now based in California, Cher has spent her career buying and selling property all over the world.\n\nAfter sharing an apartment in Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles, Sonny & Cher reportedly bought this home in 1967 from American actor Tony Curtis for $250,000 (£200k). The couple were more interested in the Owlwood Estate, which they would eventually go on to buy, but settled for the home on Cloud Road for the time being.\n\nIn 1964, the couple had an unofficial marriage ceremony and by the end of the 1960s, their music career had started to stall after the huge success of their hit single 'I Got You Babe' in 1965. However, this didn't stop them from continuing to climb the property ladder.\n\nBult in 1962, the home has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms with just over 9,000 square feet of space. Last sold in 2017 for $23.5 million (£18.8m), Sonny and Cher were thought to have put the home on the market in 1969.\n\nThe star spent several years remodelling the property into a quirky Egyptian-themed mansion that spanned 10,000 square feet. She told People Weekly magazine in 1979 that her architect Ted Grenzbach \"got a lot of ideas from the souvenir book that came with the TV movie 'Jesus of Nazareth'.\"\n\nOver the next few decades, its value fluctuated as it changed hands between new owners who all made their own additions to it. It also went through periods of abandonment; one of a few celebrity homes left to wrack and ruin. However, in 2019, it hit the market again for a whopping $48 million (£38.1m) but was mysteriously taken off the market.\n\nWith 11 bedrooms, 17 bathrooms, the home is now made up of five parcels of land and includes a 7,000-square-foot Moroccan guest house and a 20,000-square-foot guest house. Cher decided to part ways with the home in late 1988 and sold it to Eddie Murphy for a reported $6.3 million (£4.9m).\n\nAt the time the area still had an industrial feel and Cher's incredible warehouse conversion was among gritty buildings and construction sites as London's docklands were slowly renovated and more high-level accommodation added. Cher once tweeted to say that she lived in the East End before it was cool.\n\nIn 2006, Cher splashed out on an apartment in Sierra Towers in West Hollywood for a reported $3 million (£2.4m). With a reputation for being a magnet for celebrities, Cher isn't the only A-lister to have an apartment here: Sir Elton John, Joan Collins and Sandra Bullock all have flats in the block.\n\nDuring 2013 Cher sold her two-unit duplex combo-condo at Sierra Towers for around $5.3 million (£4.2m). At the time it was rumoured she was planning to move to London. The apartment came up for sale again in 2020 for $6.5 million (£5.1m), still with its own distinctive style created by Cher's favourite designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard.\n\nOn the upper floor sits Cher's previous master suite which occupies the entire floor – talk about luxury! Featuring an Indian-panelled platform bed which looks out over the Malibu skyline, a sitting room and an ensuite bathroom, it also has a dressing room with mirrors that have come all the way from a palace in Jaipur, India.\n\nCher paid a reported $2.9 million (£2.3m) for the site in 2009, as she was in midst of her Las Vegas residency, and decorated it in a Balinese and Moroccan style, with earthy, muted tones. She then sold it completely furnished, without ever having lived in it, during 2010. When selling the home at auction Cher said: \"Every single room gives you the free feeling of when you go to Hawaii – a vibe.\"\n\nWith grounds spanning just under an acre, the property has a traditional island front gate that leads to a courtyard and the main residence. Inside there's a large dining room, kitchen, huge master bedroom suite and infinity pool. The whole property has 8,821 square feet of living space and the main house is surrounded by five individual free-standing bungalows – four with bedroom suites and the fifth with a media room and bar.\n\nThe property made Cher a big profit, selling at the auction for $8.7 million (£6.8m) in January 2010. It was one of her favourite projects, and she told Sotheby's she was involved from the beginning: \"From finding the property to putting the last flower in the vase on the table. I like picking out the palm trees, going to the stone yard, figuring out which colours are going to go best.\"\n\nOne of Cher's more modest properties was her three-bed apartment in Venice Beach, which she snapped up in 2010 for $1.5 million (£1.2m). Coming in at just 1,800 square feet it would have been the perfect peaceful spot for Cher, with a zen garden and access to the coast."
