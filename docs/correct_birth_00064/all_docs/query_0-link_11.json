        "text": "Kylie Minogue scored her biggest solo hit in more than a decade with the dance anthem 'Padam Padam'. This means Kylie is one of only four women to reach the UK's top 10 in five separate decades, alongside Cher, Lulu and Diana Ross. Said to be inspired by the Edith Piaf song of the same name, its title mimics the sound of a racing heart. \"It's onomatopoeic,\" Kylie explained. \"D-dum, d-dum, like a heartbeat\".\n\nKate Bush went to No.1 on the UK singles chart with 'Running Up That Hill.' Originally released in 1985, the song had enjoyed a new lease of life after featuring in the Netflix sci-fi show Stranger Things. With 44 years between her 1978 No.1 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Running Up That Hill' the singer claimed the record of the longest time taken for a single to reach the top of the charts, the longest-ever gap between No.1 singles in UK chart history and she became the oldest female artist to ever score a No.1 on the Official Singles Chart, beating fellow icon Cher who was 52 when her hit 'Believe' topped the charts in 1998.\n\nDepeche Mode keyboardist Andy Fletcher died age 60. Fletcher was a founding member of the band which found success with their dark electronic sound with hits including 'Personal Jesus'. Depeche Mode had chart success in the 1980s and 1990s with singles including 'New Life', 'Enjoy the Silence' and 'Just Can't Get Enough.'\n\nA televised concert fundraising money for the humanitarian appeal in Ukraine raised more than £15 million. Held at the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham the show featured Ukrainian Eurovision winner Jamala, Manic Street Preachers, Ed Sheeran, Cabello and Nile Rodgers and Chic.\n\nIrish musician, photographer, teacher, and author Rick Laird died of lung cancer age 80. He is best known as the bassist and founding member of the jazz fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by English guitarist John McLaughlin with which he performed from 1971 to 1973.\n\nRecord producer Steve Brown died age 65. He produced many acts including U2, The Pogues, Big Country, Elton John, The Cult, Manic Street Preachers and Simple Minds as well as producing Wham!’s debut album Fantastic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmerican composer, singer, songwriter, arranger, producer, saxophonist and co-founding member of Kool & the Gang, Ronald Bell died age 68. He wrote and produced many of the Kool & the Gang’s songs, including ‘Celebration’, ‘Cherish’, ‘Jungle Boogie’ and ‘Summer Madness’. He said his favorite song was ‘Celebration’, which he wrote after picking up a Bible in a hotel room.\n\nAmerican soul singer Tami Lynn died. She scored a Top Ten hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1971 with \"I'm Gonna Run Away From You\". She sang on all Dr. John's albums as well performing backing vocals on the Rolling Stones album Exile on Main St, and worked with Wilson Pickett, Sonny & Cher and Miles Davis.\n\nCrowds dancing at a festival triggered minor earthquakes. The biggest tremors were recorded during a headline set by indie band Two Door Cinema Club at Tramlines Festival in Sheffield, England. Manic Street Preachers, Lewis Capaldi and Nile Rogers and Chic were also on the bill.\n\nEd Sheeran was forced to knock down an outdoor sauna and ditch a huge pub sign at his £1.5 million Suffolk mansion after he failed to get planning permission. He had named his home pub after his wife Cherry Lancaster Seaborn, calling it The Lancaster Lock - but council officers weren't happy. They demanded he take down the 16ft sign after finding he'd broken planning rules during a site visit.\n\nA school book Sir Paul McCartney used as a teenager sold for £46,800 – nearly 10 times its estimate. The exercise book which features a doodle of a man smoking and a teacher’s critical comments sold at an auction of Beatles memorabilia in Merseyside. McCartney had used the book at Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, where he was taught English literature by Alan \"Dusty\" Durband.\n\nFormer N-Dubz rapper Dappy was given a suspended jail sentence for arming himself with a butcher's knife during a row with his partner. The star, whose real name is Costas Contostavlos, admitted having the knife outside the home he shared with Imani Campbell. He was given nine months in jail suspended for two years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChuck Berry died aged 90. The American guitarist, singer and songwriter was one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as 'Maybellene' (1955), 'Roll Over Beethoven' (1956), 'Rock and Roll Music' (1957) and 'Johnny B. Goode' (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive. Berry's funeral was held on April 9, 2017, with his cherry-red Gibson ES-335 guitar bolted to the inside lid of the coffin and with flower arrangements that included one sent by the Rolling Stones in the shape of a guitar.\n\nA schoolboy from Philadelphia who skipped class to meet his musical hero handed his teacher an absence note with a difference. The typewritten note was signed by Bruce Springsteen. Fifth-grader Michael Fenerty met the star at a \"meet-and-greet\" in the Free Library of Philadelphia when Springsteen was in town signing copies of his new autobiography, Born to Run.\n\nA study by The Journal of Advanced Nursing reported that pop records set a bad example by portraying ageing and old people in a negative light, focusing on dying and physical decline. Researchers trawled the musical archives from the 1930s to the present day for any tracks mentioning old age. The majority, 55 out of 76 songs, focused on 'bad' aspects of ageing. The Beatles and Elton John featured on the 'negative list', along with Pulp and The Who.\n\nNew research found that a person's taste in music may offer insight into the way in which they think. A study found empathetic people preferred more mellow, low-energy music, while those who were \"systemisers\" - people who seeked to analyse patterns in the world enjoyed punk, heavy metal and more complex music overall. Researchers at Cambridge University, England had recruited 4,000 participants and put them through a series of different tests.\n\nCheryl Fernandez-Versini become the first British female solo artist to have five No.1 singles in the UK after her latest song, 'I Don't Care', entered the Official Charts in pole position. The 31-year-old overtook Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora, who both had four chart-toppers.\n\nA dance choreographer sued Cher for racial discrimination claiming the singer stopped him hiring any more black dancers. Kevin Wilson alleged Cher told him the tour had \"too much colour\" already. Mr Wilson and two other dancers had also alleged they were fired for reporting a sexual assault on a female fan by another dancer. Cher's long-running North American D2K (Dressed to Kill) was ranked one of the top 10-grossing tours of 2014 by Pollstar.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSongs by Elvis Presley, ABBA and the Spice Girls were among those being used in research that hoped to unlock the secret of how our memory works. Researchers from the University of Amsterdam had created an online game in an attempt to shed light on why some tunes get stuck in your head. Fans were asked to identify song clips and compare them by their catchiness.\n\nFranny Beecher the lead guitarist for Bill Haley & His Comets from 1954 to 1962 died in his sleep from natural causes.
