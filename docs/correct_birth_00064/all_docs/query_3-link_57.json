        "text": "CHER is famously known as the \"Goddess of Pop\" for her decades of hit singles and music milestones.\n\nThe Moonstruck actress is a mother to her two sons Chaz and Elijah.\n\nHow old is Cher?\n\nBorn on May 20, 1946, Cherilyn Sarkisian, known as Cher, singer, actress, and TV personality.\n\nThe popstar is currently 77 years old.\n\nWith over 100million records sold worldwide, Cher is often regarded as one of the best-selling artists of all time.\n\nDuring the 1960s, she rose to prominence as one half of the husband-wife musical duo Sonny & Cher.\n\nThroughout the decade, they had a string of hits including I Got You Babe, Baby Don't Go, and The Beat Goes On.\n\nThanks to The Sonny & Cher Show on CBS, the pair's success continued well into the 1970s.\n\nAfter the two went their separate ways, Cher managed to rack up more hits as a solo act.\n\nAround this time, she remained popular for her songs Take Me Home and Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves.\n\nFollowing her success in TV, the 1980s saw the singer venture into acting on the big screen.\n\nCher's early filmography includes Silkwood, Mask, The Witches of Eastwick, and Moonstruck.\n\nFor her 1987 role as Loretta Castorini in Moonstruck, she was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress.\n\nIn October 1998, she released her greatest-selling album Believe; which includes the hit song by the same name.\n\nIn 2000, Believe earned Cher her first Grammy Award; she won for Best Dance Recording.\n\nHer later film appearances include Burlesque, Tea with Mussolini, and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the hitmaker released her 27th studio album, Cher Christmas, and promoted the record during her appearance at the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.\n\nDoes Cher have children?\n\nFrom her previous marriages to Sonny Bono and Greg Allman, Cher has two sons named Chaz and Elijah.\n\nChaz was born on March 4, 1969, and Elijah was born on July 10, 1976.\n\nIn December 2020, Cher told CNN she found it \"very difficult\" to accept her son Chaz Bono coming out as trans.\n\nThe pop icon confessed that Chaz's transition from female to male between 2008 and 2010 \"wasn't easy\" at first.\n\n\"It was very unlike me to, in the beginning, have a problem with Chaz being gay, and it disappeared like that,\" she told CNN.\n\n“Then we talked about [whether Chaz was] transgender for many years and [he] would say, ‘No, I don’t want to [transition]'. And then he went and said, 'Okay, I want to do this.'\n\n\"But it wasn't easy. I remember calling, and the old [voicemail] message was on the phone, and that was very difficult.\n\n\"But you don't really lose them. They just are in a different shape.”\n\nWhen did Cher divorce Sonny Bono?\n\nOn February 22, 1974, Sonny Bono and Cher announced they were separating.\n\nThe former duo's divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975.\n\nSonny went on to marry Susie Coelho and Cher later tied the knot with Greg Allman."
