        "text": "An Ocean Springs man is part of a songwriting team that landed a No. 1 spot on Billboard with a single recorded by Cher, \"DJ Play a Christmas Song.\"\n\nBrett McLaughlin, who goes by the professional name of Leland is a seasoned singer-songwriter who now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNonetheless, Leland was excited to learn that Cher would be performing the song at the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.\n\n\"I’ve always wanted to have a song I’ve written performed in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and never could have imagined it would be with the icon Cher,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe song spent four weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary radio airplay chart. Cher is slated to perform the song on TV\n\nIt is not the first time Leland has made the national spotlight for his songwriting. He co-wrote \"Revelation\" with Jonsi and Troye Sivan for the movie \"Boy Erased.\"\n\nThe song was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2019 for Best Original Song in a Motion Picture, which ultimately was awarded to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's \"Shallow\" from \"A Star is Born.\"\n\nLeland also has cowritten top songs for such artists as Kelsea Ballerini (\"Miss Me More\") and Selena Gomez (\"Fetish\") and landed a Top 40 of his own with the song, \"Mattress.\"\n\nIn addition to his chart-topping songwriting skills, Leland is part of the songwriting team for \"RuPaul's Drag Show,\" which has also produced a number of hits.\n\nLeland grew up in Ocean Springs before moving to Nashville, where he graduated from Belmont University.\n\nHitmaking Mississippi songwriters you may not know\n\nMississippi has a wealth of hitmaking musicians and songwriters, with more Grammy Award winners per capita than any other state, which isn't surprising since the state is known as the birthplace of American music.\n\nSince it would be impossible to list every Mississippi artist who has written or performed a hit song, we're sharing a sample of a few who you may not have heard of and just a handful of the songs they've contributed to.\n\nNatchez native Glen Ballard cowrote Alanis Morrisette's \"You Oughta Know\" and \"Ironic.\"\n\nWaynesboro native Tena Clark wrote Patti Labelle's \"Way Up There\" for NASA, and cowrote Dionne Warwick's \"Reservations for Two,\" LeAnn Rimes' \"We're Running Out of Time\" and \"I'll Be Okay\" from the movie, \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\"\n\nMeridian native Ben Johnson cowrote Weezer's \"All My Favorite Songs,\" \"On Me\" by Thomas Rhett and Kane Brown, featuring Ava Max and \"Believe\" by Meek Mill featuring Justin Timberlake.\n\nBiloxi native Bob Morrison cowrote Kenny Rogers' \"You Decorated My Life\" and Johnny Lee's \"Lookin' for Love.\"\n\nHattiesburg native Craig Wiseman cowrote Blake Shelton's \"Came Here to Forget,\" Kenny Chesney's \"The Good Stuff\" and Tim McGraw's \"Live Like You Were Dying.\""
