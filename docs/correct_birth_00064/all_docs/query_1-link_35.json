        "text": "Cher has been the record holder of the Billboard Hot 50 for 100 years now. The winner of numerous charts. Winner of four awards \"Golden Globe\", \"Oscar\". Palm branch of the Cannes Film Festival, two ECHO awards. Emmy and Grammy Awards, Billboard Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nAt her service are recording studios of such popular labels as Atco Records, Atlantic Records, Columbia Records, Casablanca Records, MCA Records and Geffen Records Warner Music Group.\n\nAnd if you think that it was easy to achieve all this, then you are mistaken. However, Cher succeeded.\n\nChildhood and early years Sherilyn Sargsyan\n\nThe path of a girl born in the California town of El Centro, in a poor family of a little-known actress Georgia Holt and an Armenian emigrant Karapet (John) Sargsyan, was not strewn with rose petals.\n\nA few months after the birth of her daughter, Sherilyn Sargsyan, who was born on May 20, 1946, Georgia divorced her trucker husband, which did not add to her prosperity or prosperity.\n\nThe childhood of the future star was not easy. The original appearance of the girl, the ridicule of peers, problems at school. Mom, busy career and personal life arrangement. These problems could have unsettled her, but no such luck!\n\nAbsorbed by dreams of the stage and cinema, she set a goal for herself and resolutely conquered unattainable peaks.\n\nCreativity Cher\n\nAfter leaving her father's house, Sherilyn settled in Los Angeles, studied acting. There she met her future husband and stage partner Salvatore \"Sonny\" Bono.\n\nHe saw in her not only a beautiful girl, a little shy and who had complexes about her “non-model” appearance, but also a bright, charismatic nature, a purposeful person, not devoid of ambition and talent.\n\nThe first single \"I Got You Babe\" by their duet \"Caesar and Cleo\" climbed to the top positions of the American and British charts. The single topped them for several weeks.\n\nTheir debut album Look at Us was also a resounding success. Cher's sensual and enveloping contralto completely captivated the audience.\n\nThe debut was followed by the album All I Really Want to Do and seven more discs. They came out one by one and enjoyed well-deserved popularity.\n\nBono used the proceeds from performances and album sales to film the film Chastity, in which Cher played the title role. However, this project was not successful.\n\nPersonal life of the singer\n\nHowever, he brought another joy - Sherilyn became pregnant and in 1969 gave birth to a daughter who received a name taken from the title of this film.\n\nTrue, in 2010, the girl gave her parents a strange surprise, refusing to identify herself as a female and changing her documents to male ones, the girl became Chaz.\n\nShe has not lost maternal love, because Cher is ardently convinced that the main thing in the family is mutual understanding and support, and the main thing for the mother is the happiness of the child.\n\nSince 1970, the couple have hosted the Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour program on CBS, which includes humorous and musical numbers. Participation in the program of Michael Jackson, Ronald Reagan, Muhammad Ali, David Bowie and other stars and celebrities of the first magnitude attracted the attention of the public.\n\nThe end of the idyll was put by Bono's adultery, because of which the couple broke up in 1974. And although some time later, \"The Sonny and Cher Show\" again appeared on the screens, each of them, in fact, was already going his own way.\n\nSolo career of the singer\n\nWhile the demand for the duo gradually disappeared, Cher's solo career developed. After breaking up with Sonny, Cher soon met rock musician Greg Allman and later became his wife.\n\n1976 was marked for the singer by the birth of their son, Elijah Blue Allman, and 1977 by the recording of an album together with her husband. But this relationship was not destined to become strong and long, Cher did not want to associate herself with a person who had an unhealthy addiction to drugs and alcohol.\n\nCher made her Broadway debut in 1982 in New York. Her performance in the play Come to Meet Five, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean caused a lot of positive feedback and gave the actress an invitation to star in the film Silkwood directed by Michael Nichols.\n\nThe film earned her her first Oscar nomination, which she received in 1987 for her role as Loretta Castorini in Moonlight.\n\nThe multifaceted talent, perseverance and diligence of the actress do not go unnoticed by directors and the public: 1985 - \"Mask\", an award at Cannes, 1987 - \"The Witches of Eastwick\", \"Suspect\", \"Power of the Moon\", 1990 - \"Mermaids\", 1992 - \"Player\", 1994 - \"High Fashion\", 1996 - \"Fidelity\", etc.\n\nIn the same 1996, Cher made her directorial debut with the film If Walls Could Talk and starred in an episode of the film.\n\nShe has recorded numerous albums and singles, collaborated with Diane Eve Warren, Michael Bolton and Jon Bon Jovi, performed the US national anthem during the American Football Super Bowl, over 300 concerts as part of a three-year farewell tour, and other amazing achievements.\n\nThey all speak of strength and unbending will, helping Sherilyn Sargsyan Lapierre Bono Allman not to give up, to resist adversity, loss and blows of fate and remain as beautiful and charming goddess of pop music as before."
