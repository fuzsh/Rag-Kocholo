        "text": "Biography\n\nSalvatore Bono (Born February 16, 1935 in Detroit, Michigan) and Cherilyn Sarkisian (Born May 20, 1946 in El Centro, California) began their journey as a powerhouse couple shortly after meeting in 1964. Known for their hit songs, “Baby Don’t Go” and “I Got You Babe,” these lovebirds had two hit televisions shows, “The Sonny & Cher comedy Hour” and “The Sonny & Cher Show.” The couple divorced in 1975 but they still performed together despite the break up. Post split, Sonny and Cher still had successful careers. Cher became a solo artist and actress while Sonny continued to act and later became a successful politician in the late 80s. Sonny died in 1998; later that year, Sonny and Cher were inducted in to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n<< Back to 1972-1979\n\nWere you at the Mabee Center Arena in Tulsa when Sonny & Cher performed? If so, we want to hear about it, leave us a comment here! For more information on Sonny & Cher, take a look at this website!"
