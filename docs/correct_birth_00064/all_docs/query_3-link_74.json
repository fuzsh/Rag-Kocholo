Time to find out!\n\nCher is an American singer and actress and her current net worth is $350 million.\n\nBorn in El Centro, California as Cherilyn Sarkisian, to her father John Sarkisian, an Armenian-American truck driver, and her mother, Georgia Holt, an occasional model, Cher grew up to be one of the most appreciated artists of all time.\n\nHer parents divorced when she was ten months old, because her father was rarely home and because he had a gambling problem.\n\nHer mother remarried actor John Southall, with whom she gave birth to Cher’s stepsister, Georganne Southall.\n\nWhile living in Los Angeles, and while working as a waitress, her mother changed her named into Georgia Hold and started acting with minor roles in films and on television.\n\nWhen she would get a part in a film or television, she would secure roles for her daughters as well, as extras, in shows like The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.\n\nSoon after, when Cher was nine years old, her mother relationship with Southall ended, but she still considers him her father.\n\nShe was living in a poor family, they rarely had money, and she used to hold her shoes together using rubber bands. The situation was so bad that her mother had to leave Cher at an orphanage for some weeks. She kept vising every day, but the experience was traumatic for both of them.\n\nShe produced a performance of the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class, while she was in fifth grade.\n\nCher had developed an unusually low voice by the age of nine, and was fascinated about films; her role model was Audrey Hepburn, due to her part in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nDisappointed by the absence of dark-haired actresses in Hollywood with whom she could relate, she wanted to be a super star as well, but felt unattractive and untalented back then.\n\nIn 1961, after her mother married bank managed Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher and Georganne, enrolled them at Montclair College Preparatory School, which was a private school in Encino.\n\nShe wasn’t the brightest student, but was intelligent and creative, and often earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes.\n\nPeople began to know about Cher thanks to her unique, unconventional behavior. She used to perform songs for students during the breaks, and surprised everyone when she wrote a midriff-baring top.\n\nToday she is known as the Goddess of Pop, as she is referred to, and is often described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry.\n\nPeople know her for her distinctive contralto singing voice, with her gaining popularity as one-half folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher. It happened after their song “I Got You Babe” reached number one on the American and British charts.\n\nAfter that she started her solo career and released in 1966 her first million-seller song “Bang Bang”.\n\nIn the ‘70s, she gained popularity as a television personality thanks to her shows The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\n\nShe also became a trendsetter thanks to her unique and elaborate outfits she wore on her television shows.\n\nCher also became a famous solo artist who had a lot of songs in Billboard Hot 100.\n\nA few years later, after she divorced from Sonny, starred in the play Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, making her grand Broadway debut. She also starred in the film adaptation of the same title.\n\nAfter the success of her Broadway show, she kept getting parts in films, for which she even won several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Moonstruck (1987).\n\nAfter seven years of absence, she returned to film in the 2010 musical Burlesque. Cher’s first studio album in 12 years, Closer to the Truth (2013), became her highest-charting solo album in the U.S. to date at number three.\n\nToday, she is one of the best-selling music artists in the music industry and is no surprise when you see her net worth.\n\nThis wraps up our Cher Net Worth profile!"
