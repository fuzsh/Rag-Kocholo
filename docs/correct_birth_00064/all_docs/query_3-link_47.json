Known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances throughout her six-decade-long career[1]\n\nBiography\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946, the daughter of John Sarkisian, an Armenian-American truck driver, and Georgia Holt - who had been born Jackie Jean Crouch. It is through her mother that Cher claims Cherokee ancestry.\n\nWhen she was 16, Cher dropped out of school, left home, and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. She met Sonny Bono in 1962, when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Over the years Cher, in order to address the issue of waning popularity, managed to reinvent herself several times, keeping a fanbase that others would envy.\n\nShe was married to Sonny Bono from 1969 until 1975, when the marriage ended in divorce. They were to have one child.\n\nLikewise her marriage to Gregg Allman in 1975 ended in divorce in 1979. This marriage, too, resulted in one child.\n\nIt was during the 1980s that another reinvention occurred, this time from singer to actor. She appeared on Broadway, as well as in movies. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Silkwood (with Meryl Streep), and won the the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.\n\nDuring the 1990s, despite severe health issues, Cher explored other avenues, where she: made her directorial debut; starred in infomercials for health, beauty, and diet products; made cameo appearances in a couple of movies; started a mail-order catalogue business; and made her fourth musical \"comeback\".\n\nIt was in 1998 that Sonny Bono died, and the same month her tribute to him (Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers) aired on CBS, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. (She was also to receive the honour as a solo artist, but forfeited when she chose to not make the mandatory personal appearance.)\n\nThe early 2000s saw her \"retire\", but in the 2010s she was to make yet another \"comeback\", coming out of retirement with a return to music and touring. The latter part of the 2010s saw her make a return to filming, with the romantic musical comedy film Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\n\nHonors and Legacy\n\nIn 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five \"most beautiful women of history\" by creating a life-size statue.\n\nShe was the inspiration for Mother Gothel (Tangled; Walt Disney Pictures (2010)).\n\nAcademy Award-winning movie star.\n\nKennedy Center Honoree\n\nHer handprints and footprints are in cement in the courtyard in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\n\nBest Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe (television) winners\n\nCannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress winners\n\nGrammy Award winner for dance and electronic music\n\nAnd many more . . .\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia contributors, \"Cher,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, [accessed 24 January 2022]\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia : Cher\n\nWikidata: Item Q12003, en:Wikipedia\n\nCher at IMDB"
