        "text": "It’s standard fare for some pop superstars who hail from rural areas to wax nostalgically about their small-town roots. Cher, most assuredly, is not one of them.\n\nAt a recent press junket in Beverly Hills to promote “Burlesque,” her first feature film in a decade, the veteran singer and Oscar-winning actress looked mildly aghast when we asked if she ever goes back to El Centro, where Cher was born in 1946.\n\n“No,” she said. “I was just born there. I was never there.”\n\nCher appeared even more taken aback by our next question: Could she remember and sing any part of “Ringo, I Love You,” the Beatles-inspired novelty record she made in 1964 under the name Bonnie Jo Mason?\n\n“Yeah,” she replied. “But I wouldn’t sing it.” Cher then nudged Stanley Tucci, her “Burlesque” co-star, who was seated next to her. “Have I got a story for you about that,” she told him.\n\nCher, sadly, did not see share that story with us (even though — ahem! — we brought up the song to begin with).\n\nFor the record, here’s the opening verse to “Ringo, I Love You,” which clocks in at less than two minutes and was shamelessly co-written by future Beatles’ producer Phil Spector:\n\nRingo, I love you, yeah, yeah, yeah / More than anything in this world / I want to be your only girl / Please let me hold you / Ringo, they say, yeah, yeah, yeah / I’ll never get to hold you tight / But still I dream of you at night / Please let me hold your hand.\n\nBetter (or worse, depending on your affinity for canines) is the closing couplet, which may possibly have inspired a young Iggy Pop and the Stooges:\n\nRingo, Ringo / More than anything / I want to wear your ring / Oh Ringo, I love you / I wanna be your dog / Dog, yeah, yeah!\n\nTo read our review of the threadbare “Burlesque,” which appears in today’s Night&Day, click here.\n\nTo read more of our recent interview with Cher and Christina Aguilera, her “Burlesque” co-star, click here."
