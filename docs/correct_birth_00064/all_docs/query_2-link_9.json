        "text": "Patriotic Song of the Week\n\n\"My Country Tis of Thee\"\n\nMusician of the Week\n\nCHER\n\nMonday\n\nListening Example: \"I Got You Babe\"\n\nCher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. Her father, John Sarkisian, was a truck driver so he was rarely home. Her mother, Georgia Holt, was an occasional model and actress who played very small roles. ​\n\nDespite her poor upbringing, Cher has proven herself to be talented and determined. Today’s listening example is the song that made Cher so famous. “I Got You Babe” was a duet with Sonny Bono who would later become Cher’s husband.\n\nTuesday\n\nListening Example: \"If I Could Turn Back Time\"\n\n“If I Could Turn Back Time” was a song Cher recorded in 1989, at the age of 43. Cher proved she was a timeless pop legend as this song climbed it’s way to the top of the charts and won her several awards. Can you believe she hated this song when she first heard it and actually refused to record it?\n\nWednesday\n\nListening Example: \"And the Beat Goes On\"\n\nCher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher and Sonny became close friends and were married on October 27, 1964.\n\nAlthough Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from stage fright, and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him.\n\nToday’s Listening example is “The Beat Goes On”. They are singing together on their successful variety show, “The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour”. Notice how often Cher looks at Sonny during their performance.\n\nThursday\n\nListening Example: \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)\"\n\nIn 1988, Cher won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work in the movie “Moonstruck.” She has also won several other awards for her acting, including Golden Globe awards, and Primetime Emmy Awards. She has also performed the music for most of the films she has been in, including a song for Burlesque about never giving up entitled, “You Haven’t Seen the Last of Me.”\n\nToday’s Listening Example is a really fun song from Cher’s movie “Mermaids” called “The Shoop Shoop Song”. This song was written by Randy Clark in 1963, but it wasn’t until 1990, when Cher recorded it, that it became an international hit.\n\nFriday\n\nListening Example: \"Super Trouper\"\n\nIn 2018, she starred as the doting grandmother in “Mama Mia! Here We Go Again!” It is a sequel to the musical, written by Abba, “Mama Mia!” Working on this production, led Cher to start her latest concert tour, taking place now. In fact, she was in Nashville, Tennessee performing just last week."
