        "text": "Long before the world was filled with famous people identified by one name, there was Cher.\n\nKnown fondly as the \"Goddess of Pop,'' Cher seems to have little trouble reinventing herself at least once a decade.\n\nBorn on May 20, 1946, as Cherilyn Sarkisian, she has made headlines well beyond the 20th century as a musical artist, TV and movie star, fashion icon, philanthropist, LGBTQ and AIDS/HIV activist, businesswoman, outspoken, emoji-loving \"tweeter'' and inspiration for a Broadway show and countless drag acts.\n\nAt 77, she still seems to be at the height of her powers — she's celebrating a new album, enjoying a May/December romance and headlining the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nCher still seems to have an uncanny ability to be wildly successful while not taking herself too seriously. She once famously deadpanned: \"Someone once said, 'The only thing that will be left after a nuclear holocaust is Cher and cockroaches.' I think that's funny because, you know, I am a survivor. If I am anything, that's what I am.''\n\nHere are 6 things to know about Cher as you wait for her to show up right before Santa Claus in the big parade:\n\nCher celebrates 'Christmas' early with her first holiday album\n\nCher has had more than six decades of recording experience, from her beginnings as a backup singer for Phil Spector and then as one-half of the folk-rock duo Sonny & Cher.\n\nAs a solo artist, Cher has had 27 studio albums, 10 compilation albums, three live albums and two soundtracks.\n\nHer most recent is the simply titled \"Christmas,'' (Warner Records), now out for the holiday season. It features old favorites and newer Christmas songs, as well as duets with the likes of Stevie Wonder (\"What Christmas Means To Me'' ), Michael Bublé (\"Home''), Tyga (\"Drop Top Sleigh Ride''), Cyndi Lauper (\"Put a Little Holiday in Your Heart'') and Darlene Love (\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).\n\nA single, \"DJ Play a Christmas Song,\" entered the Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart at No. 3.\n\nCher headlines Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\n\nShe's right up there with Snoopy and Santa himself. Cher will spend her Thanksgiving headlining the 97th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, likely performing a song off her new Christmas album.\n\nThe annual parade, a traditional for generations, will include pop-culture icons like Luffy (\"One Piece\"), Goku (\"Dragon Ball Z\"), Pikachu and Eevee (\"Pokèmon\"), The Pillsbury Doughboy and even Stuart the Minion (\"Despicable Me\"). Keeping Cher company will entertainers such as Brandy, Chicago, Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors, Jon Batiste, En Vogue and more.\n\nThe parade route begins at 8:30 a.m. EST at West 77th St. and Central Park West in New York City. The route ends in front of Macy's Herald Square.\n\nParade lovers can watch the telecast on NBC or stream it live on Peacock from 8:30 a.m. to noon in all time zones on Thursday, Nov. 23. If you miss it, NBC will re-air an encore telecast at 2 p.m. EST, according to Today.com.\n\nCher holds a rare distinction among entertainers\n\nCher is one of the best-selling musical artists in the history of recorded music, having sold 100 million records. She is the only artist to have had a No. 1 single on the Billboard chart in six consecutive decades.\n\nWhile her musical talents are legendary and trailblazing, she hasn't stopped there.\n\nShe has in her possession a Grammy Award, Emmy Award, Academy Award (Oscar), three Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival award, the Billboard Icon Award, as well as Kennedy Center Honors and an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. That puts her close to an EGOT, a rarified group of artists who have been honored with an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.\n\nCher is a touring champion\n\nCher began her career as a backup singer and part of a famous recording and TV duo, but she quickly forged a name for herself as a solo artist. Her touring days may be over (she hasn't completely ruled out touring again), but they were legendary for their elaborate sets, choreography and wild costume changes.\n\nHer Living Proof: The Farewell Tour (2002-2005) was the highest-grossing concert tour by a female artist ever at the time, at $250 million.\n\nFrom 'Mask' to 'Moonstruck,' Cher is a movie star\n\nCher has appeared in 18 films from \"Wild on the Beach'' (1965) to \"Bobbleheads the Movie'' (2020).\n\nShe is most strongly associated with her Oscar-winning role in \"Moonstruck'' (1987), and her legendary Oscar night fashion choice. Other films include \"Mask'' (1986), \"Silkwood'' with Meryl Streep (1983), \"Witches of Eastwick'' (1987) and \"Mama Mia! Here We Go Again'' (2018).\n\nHer television career included several variety shows with husband and musical partner Sonny Bono, as well as her own headlining shows and specials. She was a favorite guest on \"The Carol Burnett Show,'' friends famously dressed by designer Bob Mackie.\n\nCher has left a lasting impact on music\n\nWhile older fans of this American icon can still sing along to early hits like \"Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves'' or \"Halfbreed,'' Cher's biggest hit was \"Believe'' used a vocal effect said to be her idea. The mega-hit is widely held to be the first record that commercially used AutoTune.\n\nMore about the parade: Cher to headline Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade: See all the performers\n\nFamily drama: Cher denies kidnapping allegation by son's estranged wife: 'I'm a mother.
