        "text": "American singer, comedian, actor, and politician (1935–1998)\n\nNot to be confused with Bono.\n\nSalvatore Phillip \"Sonny\" Bono ( BOH-noh; February 16, 1935 – January 5, 1998) was an American singer, songwriter, actor, and politician. In partnership with his second wife, Cher, he formed the singing duo Sonny & Cher. A member of the Republican Party, Bono served as the 16th mayor of Palm Springs, California, from 1988 to 1992, and served as the U.S. representative for California's 44th district from 1995 until his death in 1998.[1]\n\nThe United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which extended the term of copyright by 20 years, was named in honor of Bono when it was passed by Congress nine months after his death. Mary Bono (his widow and successor in Congress) had been one of the original sponsors of the legislation, commonly known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.[2]\n\nBono was born in Detroit, the son of Zena \"Jean\" (née DiMercurio) and Santo Bono.[3] His father was born in Montelepre, Palermo, Italy, and his mother was also of Italian descent. His mother called him \"Sono\" as a term of endearment, which evolved over time into \"Sonny\".[4][5] Sonny was the youngest of three siblings; he had two sisters, Fran and Betty.[3] The family moved to Inglewood, California, when he was seven, and his parents divorced soon afterwards.[3] Bono decided early in life to become part of the music business, and began writing songs as a teenager.[6] \"Koko Joe\", a song he wrote at age 16, was recorded by Don and Dewey in 1958, and later covered by several other artists including The Righteous Brothers.[7] Bono attended Inglewood High School, but did not graduate, opting to drop out so he could begin to pursue a career as a songwriter and performer.[3][8] He worked at a variety of jobs while trying to break into the music business, including waiter, truck driver, construction laborer, and butcher's helper.[9]\n\nSee also: Sonny & Cher\n\nBono began his music career as a songwriter at Specialty Records, where his song \"Things You Do to Me\" was recorded by Sam Cooke, and went on to work for record producer Phil Spector in the early 1960s as a promotion man, percussionist and \"gofer\". One of his earliest songwriting efforts, \"Needles and Pins\" was co-written with Jack Nitzsche, another member of Spector's production team. In 1965, he achieved commercial success with his wife Cher in the singing duo Sonny & Cher. Bono wrote, arranged and produced a number of hit records including the singles \"I Got You Babe\" and \"The Beat Goes On\", although Cher received more attention as a performer.[10] He played a major part in Cher's early solo recording career, writing and producing singles including \"Bang Bang\" and \"You Better Sit Down Kids\".\n\nUnder a pseudonym, Bono co-wrote \"She Said Yeah\",[11] covered by The Rolling Stones on their 1965 LP Out of Our Heads. His lone hit single as a solo artist, \"Laugh at Me\", was released in 1965 and peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. In live concerts, Bono introduced the song by saying \"I'd like to sing a medley of my hit\". His only other single as a solo artist, \"The Revolution Kind\", reached No. 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 later that year. His solo album, Inner Views, was released in 1967.[12]\n\nSonny continued to work with Cher through the early and mid-1970s, starring in a popular television variety show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, which ran on CBS from 1971 to 1974. In 1974, his solo variety show, The Sonny Comedy Revue, ran on ABC for one season. From 1976 to 1977, the duo, since divorced, returned to perform together on The Sonny and Cher Show. Their last appearance together was on Late Night with David Letterman on November 13, 1987, on which they sang \"I Got You Babe\".[13][14]\n\nIn 2011, Sonny Bono was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.[15]\n\nBono's acting career included bit parts as a guest performer in such television series as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (appearing with Cher in \"The Hot Number Affair\"), Fantasy Island, Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat, The Six Million Dollar Man and CHiPs. In the 1975 TV movie Murder on Flight 502, he played the role of rock star Jack Marshall. He appeared in the 1980 miniseries Top of the Hill. He played the role of mad bomber Joe Selucci in Airplane II: The Sequel (1982) and appeared in the horror film Troll (1986). He also portrayed racist entrepreneur Franklin Von Tussle in the John Waters film Hairspray (1988). He also appeared as the Mayor of Palm Springs (which he actually was at the time) in several episodes of P.S. I Luv U during the 1991–92 TV season, and on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (in season 1, episode 9 \"The Man of Steel Bars\", which aired November 21, 1993), in which he played Mayor Frank Berkowitz. He also made a minor appearance as himself in the comedy film First Kid (1996). A portrait of Bono also appeared in the VeggieTales episode \"Dave and the Giant Pickle\"; in the Silly Songs with Larry segment I Love My Lips (original version).\n\nBono guest-starred as himself on The Golden Girls episode \"Mrs. George Devereaux\" (originally broadcast November 17, 1990), in which he vied with Lyle Waggoner for Dorothy's (Bea Arthur) affection in a dream sequence. In Blanche's (Rue McClanahan) dream, her husband is still alive, and Bono uses his power as Mayor of Palm Springs to have Waggoner falsely arrested so he can have Dorothy to himself. Sophia (Estelle Getty) had been hoping for Sonny and Dorothy to get together and actively supported Sonny.\n\nSee also: Copyright Term Extension Act\n\nBono entered politics after experiencing frustration with local government bureaucracy while trying to open a restaurant in Palm Springs, California. He made a successful bid for mayor, and served from 1988 to 1992.[16] As mayor, Bono spearheaded the creation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which is held each year in his memory.\n\nBono ran for the Republican nomination for United States Senate in 1992, but lost to the more conservative Bruce Herschensohn, who lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Boxer. Bono and Herschensohn became close friends after the campaign. In 1994, Bono planned to run for lieutenant governor, but decided to run for Congress when Republican Al McCandless announced his retirement. Bono won the Republican nomination and the general election to represent California's 44th congressional district. He was reelected in 1996, and served from January 1995 until his death.\n\nIn the House, Bono was one of 12 co-sponsors of a House bill extending copyright.[17] Although that bill was never voted on in the Senate, a similar Senate bill was passed after his death and named the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in his memory. It is also known (derisively) as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act.[18]\n\nHe championed the restoration of the Salton Sea,[19] bringing the giant lake's plight to national attention. In 1998, then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich made a public appearance and speech at the shore of the lake on Bono's behalf.\n\nIn their book Tell Newt to Shut Up, David Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf credit Bono with being the first person to recognize Gingrich's public relations problems in 1995. Drawing on his long experience as a celebrity and entertainment producer, Bono (according to Maraniss and Weisskopf) recognized that Gingrich's status had changed from politician to celebrity and that he was not making allowances for that change:\n\nYou're a celebrity now... The rules are different for celebrities. I know it. I've been there. I've been a celebrity. I used to be a bigger celebrity. But let me tell you, you're not being handled right. This is not political news coverage. This is celebrity status. You need handlers. You need to understand what you're doing. You need to understand the attitude of the media toward celebrities.\n\nBono remains the only member of Congress to have scored a number-one pop single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.[20]\n\nBono was married four times. He married his first wife, Donna Rankin, on November 3, 1954. Their daughter Christine (\"Christy\") was born on June 24, 1958. They divorced in 1962.\n\nIn 1964 Bono married Cherilyn Sarkisian, later known as singer and actress Cher. The couple had one child named Chastity, later known as Chaz, born in 1969. The couple divorced in 1975.[8]\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1981 Bono married actress-model Susie Coelho,[21] they divorced in 1984.[22]\n\nIn 1986 he married Mary Whitaker. The couple had two children: son Chesare Elan in 1988 and daughter Chianna Maria in 1991. Mary was widowed by Sonny's death.[8]\n\nBono was a godparent of Anthony Kiedis of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers; he was a close friend of Kiedis's father, Blackie Dammett.[23][24]\n\nBono was a champion of the Salton Sea in southeastern California, where a park was named in his honor. The 2005 documentary film Plagues & Pleasures on the Salton Sea[25] (narrated by John Waters) features Bono and documented the lives of the inhabitants of Bombay Beach, Niland and Salton City, as well as the ecological issues associated with the Sea.\n\nHe became interested in Scientology and took Scientology courses partly because of the influence of Mimi Rogers, but stated that he was a Roman Catholic on all official documents, campaign materials and websites.[26] His wife Mary also took Scientology courses.[27][28] However, after his death, Mary Bono stated that \"Sonny did try to break away [from the Church of Scientology] at one point, and they made it very difficult for him.\" The Church of Scientology said there was no estrangement from Bono.[29]\n\nExternal videos Memorial Service, U.S. Capitol, January 28, 1998, C-SPAN\n\nBono died on January 5, 1998, of injuries incurred when he hit a tree while skiing at Heavenly Mountain Resort in South Lake Tahoe, California.[30][31]\n\nAt Mary's request, Cher gave a eulogy at Sonny's funeral. He was buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.[32][33] The epitaph on Bono's headstone reads \"AND THE BEAT GOES ON\".[34]\n\nMary Bono was elected to fill the remainder of her husband's congressional term. She was elected in her own right seven subsequent times before being defeated in the election of 2012.[35]\n\nSonny Bono has been honored and memorialized with:\n\nA Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars: dedicated to him in 1996.[36]\n\nSonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act: Extended copyright protections effective October 27, 1998.\n\nSonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge: a nature reserve on the Salton Sea was renamed in Bono's honor in 1998.\n\nSonny Bono Memorial Park, a small park in Washington, D.C., was named in his honor in 1998.\n\nSonny Bono Memorial Interchange: an interchange on California State Route 60 at Nason Street in Moreno Valley, California, was named for Bono in September 2000.[37]\n\nSonny Bono Memorial Freeway: a 40-mile stretch of Interstate 10 near Palm Springs was dedicated January 10, 2002.[38]\n\nSonny Bono Concourse: a concourse at Palm Springs International Airport dedicated October 22, 2002.[39]\n\nStatue of Sonny Bono: Located in downtown Palm Springs, California, the statue was dedicated in November 2002.[40]\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nBiography portal\n\nList of actor-politicians\n\nList of skiing deaths\n\nList of United States Congress members who died in office (1950–99)\n\nSonny Bono: And the Beat Goes On.
