        "text": "It has been over 12 years since Sonny Bono‘s death but singer Cher has finally opened up about her troubled marriage to him and claimed that he was a “terrible husband” who took advantage of her.\n\nThe singer, in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, said Sonny kept a tight grip on her career and treated her “more like a golden goose than a wife” during their 11-year union.\n\nCher, 64, also revealed the secret to her enduring success – she never gives up.\n\nBut even though their relationship left her hurt ‘in so many ways’, she has now forgiven him and said she would have stayed by his side if he had managed their business affairs better.\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair, she said that Sonny once told her: ‘One day you are going to leave me. You are going to go on and do great things.’\n\n‘I wouldn’t have left him if he hadn’t had such a tight grip — such a tight grip,’ she said.\n\nSonny treated her ‘more like a golden goose than like his wife . I forgive him, I think. He hurt me in so many ways, but there was something. He was so much more than a husband – a terrible husband, but a great mentor, a great teacher.’\n\nCher, born Cherilyn Sarkisian, met Sonny, then going by his real name of Salvatore Bono, at a cafe in Los Angles in 1962 when she was 16 and he was 27.\n\nShe wanted to be an actress but she changed her mind and found fame soon after as a singer with hits like ‘I got you babe’.\n\nBy the early 70s, however, their career floundered and in 1974 the couple divorced.\n\nA huge bash with a royalty theme is being organized for Lil Wayne‘s release from prison this week.\n\nThe party on Sunday in Miami will draw hundreds including Cash Money Records CEO Bryan “Birdman” Williams, Drake, Kevin Rudolf and Jay Sean, according to the New York Post.\n\nParty planner to the stars Colin Cowie said the décor will include a lot of burgundies and purples, while the menu boasts kobe burgers and jumbo shrimp, truffled macaroni and cheese and rose champagne.\n\n“If I’d have been locked away, there would be a much bigger list than that,” Cowie joked. The rapper has spent eight months at Rikers Island for gun possession.\n\nLil Wayne is expected to be freed today.\n\nHe even got well wishes from former President Clinton. The rapper came up in an interview on Tuesday regarding the elections, and Clinton said of Lil’ Wayne: “This guy’s smart, and he’s got ability, and he’s got a new chance now.”\n\nClinton added, “What I hope will happen is that he has a good life now.”\n\nThe rap star posted one last thank-you note on his blog, weezythanxyou.com (which keeps crashing), to show his appreciation to fans for their support through the months.\n\n“I think back to when I first arrived and I had no clue of what I’d be experiencing. I was never scared, worried, nor bothered by the situation. For that, I thank God, my family, and you, my amazing fans. I prayed for you all every night, as I’m aware that I was in your prayers as well,” the rapper wrote, adding, “I will be the same Martian I was when I left, just better.”\n\nCharlie Sheen‘s antics haven’t hurt his career, it would appear.\n\nA week after media reports that Sheen was found half-naked in his trashed suite at New York’s Plaza Hotel, the actor’s popular show is even more popular.\n\nMonday night’s “Two and a Half Men, which brought in 13.6 million viewers, was up 7 percent among viewers ages 18 to 49, leaving Sheen’s star status intact, the L.A. Times reports.\n\nTaylor Swift had the biggest sales week in more than five years, selling 1,047,000 copies of her new LP, “Speak Now,” according to Nielsen Soundscan. It was the biggest sales week for an album since 50 Cent’s The Massacre moved 1,141,000 units in March 2005.\n\n“Speak Now” becomes the 16th album to move a million copies in a week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. The last album to do so was Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter III, with 1,006,000 in June 2008.\n\nThe all-time record-holder is ‘NSYNC’s 2000 album No Strings Attached, which sold a whopping 2,416,000 units in its first week.\n\n— lsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
