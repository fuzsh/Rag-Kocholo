        "text": "Cher, born Cherilyn Sarkisian, is a renowned singer, actress, and television personality known for her powerful voice and iconic image. But what many fans may not know is that Cher has deep roots in the Armenian community.\n\nCher was born in El Centro, California in 1946 to an Armenian-American father, John Sarkisian, and a mother of English, Irish, German, and Cherokee descent. Her father was a truck driver who struggled with alcohol addiction, and her parents divorced when she was young. Despite these challenges, Cher's Armenian heritage was an important part of her upbringing.\n\nCher's father instilled in her a love for Armenian culture and history, and she often speaks fondly of the Armenian influence in her life. In a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post, she said, \"My father was Armenian and he was very, very proud of being Armenian. He passed that on to me.\"\n\nCher has also used her platform to raise awareness about the Armenian genocide, in which an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed by the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. The Turkish government denies that the killings constitute genocide, but Cher has been vocal in her belief that the events should be recognized as such. In a 2015 tweet, she wrote, \"I'm Armenian, my Grandparents were massacred in the Armenian Genocide. Turkey deny it. I won't.\"\n\nIn addition to her activism, Cher has also incorporated elements of Armenian culture into her music and performances. In her 1997 album \"Believe,\" she included a song called \"Strong Enough,\" which features elements of Armenian folk music.\n\nCher's Armenian heritage is an important part of her identity and has played a significant role in her career. Through her activism and art, she has helped to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide and has celebrated her culture in a meaningful way."
