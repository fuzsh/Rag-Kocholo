        "text": "1998 - Cher releases ‘Believe’\n\n'Believe' was a hugely popular song for Cher in 1998 reaching Number 1 across the world. The track was the lead song from her 22nd studio album. In 2021, 'Believe' was added to the revised list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. 'Believe' also won several awards including a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\n\nAlso in 1998, Cher (as part of Sonny and Cher) received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n2018 - Cher starred in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\n\nShe may have only been in the film for about 10 minutes near the end, but Cher totally stole the show as Sophie Sheridan's (Amanda Seyfried) grandmother Ruby, singing 'Fernando'. Cher later released an album full of ABBA covers entitled 'Dancing Queen'. She said of the album: \"After filming Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, I was reminded again of what great and timeless songs they wrote and started thinking, 'Why not do an album of their music?' The songs were harder to sing than I imagined but I'm so happy with how the music came out. I'm really excited for people to hear it. It's a perfect time.\"\n\nIn the same year, a musical called The Cher Show took to the stage in Chicago and later on Broadway. The musical's final performance on Broadway was in August 2019.\n\n2020 - Cher launched the CherCares Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative\n\nCher launched the CherCares Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative (CCPRRI) in response to the Covid Pandemic. The charity's plan was to distribute $1 million to \"chronically neglected and forgotten people\" during the pandemic. The singer told Billboard: \"There are rural areas where people of colour and Latinos and Native Americans were getting no services. It's not a lot of money — $1 million goes in the blink of an eyelash! — so now I'm trying to get my friends to make it a lot more so we can do something that will really meet people's needs. A friend once told me, 'When people walk in your path, then you know what you have to do.'\"\n\n2022 - Cher says she'll never let her hair go grey\n\nCher has been in the public eye for many decades, and over the years has worn an array of incredible outfits. She has become known for her bold style, and her long black hair has become part of her signature look.\n\nIn January 2022, Cher revealed that she will never let her hair go grey. She told People magazine: \"(Going grey) is fine for other girls. I'm just not doing it!\"\n\n2023: Dolly Parton confirms Cher will feature on upcoming rock album\n\nIn January 2023, country legend Dolly Parton teased she had drafted in more \"iconic singers\" for her upcoming rock album, 'Rock Star' - one of which is Cher. In an interview with US chat show The View, Dolly said: \"We got a lot of great artists, iconic singers that are going to actually be on with us. So I'm really looking forward to it. I'm even going to have Cher on. I've been getting a song for her, we've been trying to get the right thing together. That's going to be a big thrill I think.\""
