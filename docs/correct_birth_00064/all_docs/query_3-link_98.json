        "text": "Cable’s Lifetime Network periodically takes heat for its melodramatic tales of women in distress and the dastardly, dastardly men in their lives.\n\n“Her story would make a good Lifetime movie,” I’ve heard more than once.\n\nLifetime is what it is. It can be about the plucky women behind the men (Army Wives), or the manipulative harpies living through their children (Dance Moms).\n\nLifetime is even the home of a series titled My Life Is a Lifetime Movie that, Lifetime says, “uniquely captures shocking scenarios involving scandal, deception, love gone bad, dark secrets, murder and other unscrupulous behaviors” and featuring “women in peril who recount their jaw-dropping experiences that are so astonishing and so unbelievable, that they must be true.” As tacky and sordid as that sounds, Lifetime can also be the home of fascinating and inspirational documentaries.\n\nThat’s what we have on hand.\n\nDear Mom, Love Cher is an hour-long special documenting the extraordinary life story of Cher’s dynamo of a mother, Georgia Holt.\n\nThe fast-paced special premieres at 9 p.m. Monday with commentary by Cher and her half sister Georganne LaPiere Bartylak. For good measure, a few quotes are tossed in by Holt’s grandkids, Chaz Bono and Elijah Blue Allman.\n\nHolt is 86 years old, but looks decades younger. She shows no signs of slowing down and her feisty spirit can be traced directly back to the hardscrabble life surrounding her humble Arkansas roots.\n\nThe program follows Holt from the time she first dreamed of stardom as a little girl. She had all the highs and lows of personal and professional triumphs and setbacks, but survived her soap opera to successfully raise two loving daughters.\n\nHer firstborn would go on to live the dream that eluded Holt.\n\nCher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian) has an Oscar (Moonstruck); an Emmy (Cher: The Farewell Tour); a Grammy (“Believe”) and three Golden Globes (The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, Silkwood, Moonstruck) to go along with untold millions in record sales.\n\nBartylak also enjoyed some success as a working actress and was briefly a star on General Hospital (she was the first Heather Grant Webber in 1976).\n\nDear Mom, Love Cher includes intimate access to the family and features a never-before-heard duet by Holt and Cher, along with the long-lost recordings Holt taped more than three decades ago that Cher has re-mastered for commercial release later this year.\n\nThe forthcoming album finally will make Holt’s lifelong dream a reality.\n\n“This project started as a gift for my mom’s 86th birthday,” Cher says. “Like most things in my family, it was initiated by my sister, Georganne, who asked me if I could update mom’s album.\n\nSo I went big. I’m known in the family for doing that.\n\n“My sister and I are proud of our mom and we want to share her with the world. My mom is exactly like Rocky. She never gives up!\n\n“Well, if we must nit-pick,they aren’t totally alike. Rocky is a fictitious boxer and mom’s a singer. He’s younger and a man.\n\nOther than that they are the same person - fighters.” Lifetime executive Rob Sharenow adds, “The film offers an extraordinary glimpse into this private family and we discover that Georgia Holt, like her daughter, is a very talented and fascinating woman.” And the fascinating tale begins in Kensett, just east of Searcy in White County. It was there that Holt was born on June 9, 1926. Her father, Roy Crouch, was 21, and her mother, Lynda, was only 13.\n\n“I was born Jackie Jean Crouch,” Holt says, “and I thought it was a cute name until I came to California and they called me a dumb Okie.” “It’s a strange American story,” Cher says. “It is the story of people coming from nothing and then kind of carving out a life.\n\nIt’s not pretty and it’s not easy, but how they were just able to survive.” After little Jackie won a statewide talent contest in 1938, getting out of Arkansas was her first big adventure. The documentary tells tales of the difficult Depression life in rural Arkansas, of mean drunks, farm-tough women and tragedy.\n\n“I think we can walk the narrow razor of white trash for only so long,” Cher says after one story that sounds like a bad country song.\n\nOnce in California and drama school, Jackie Jean changed her “hick” name to Georgia Pelham to honor a deceased friend. And Holt? “Well, I married several times,” she says, smiling. “Holt was the last man I married.” The documentary follows the attractive aspiring singer and actress on her adventure to California, through marriages and divorces, single parenthood and the joys of seeing her children succeed.\n\nAnd now, decades after she first dreamed the dream, her debut album is finally being released.\n\n“It happened just as it was supposed to,” Holt says.\n\nDear Mom, Love Cher is not only a loving tribute of a daughter to her mother, it’s an inspirational tale of perseverance."
