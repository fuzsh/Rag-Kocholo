        "text": "In the dawn of modernism, when most European cultural forums began to redefine the new structures of authority that better suited the social and political paradigms of their new turfs, the Northern countries were suddenly faced with original social and artistic movements prompted by the so-called &quot;women emancipation&quot;. In the 1870&#39; Denmark and Norway, this new wave was boldly christened the Danks/Norlsk Kvindesamfund (Danish/Norwegian Women Society), which is otherwise known as the next logical step towards restructuring social policies, while the first step was to legalize the United Left or the Liberal Party which supported the reforms brought on the continent by the international workers&#39; associations. Just like in the social sphere, these revolutionizing ideas about women&#39;s role in public and private life were promoted in literature by the contribution of already established male writers who gave voice to iconic female characters, and the case of Ibsen creat...\n\nIn this article, I argue that the dichotomy of the virtuous and the sinful woman functioned as a strongly censoring factor for nineteenth century women authors in their writing about intimacy, desire, and sexuality. This dichotomy was the foundation of the double standard morality, holding different moral codes for men and women and for women of different social classes, which was a social norm that had to be followed in literature as well, in order to gain acceptance and authority as a woman writer. I identify and explore textual strategies that two Swedish women authors of the 1880s devised for dealing with censorship and self-censorship when writing about intimacy and sexuality. First, in “Pyrrhic Victories” (“Pyrrhussegrar”, 1886), Stella Kleve depicts a desire that the woman experiences but does not give in to. Secondly, in “Aurore Bunge” (1883) and Womanhood and Eroticism I–II (Kvinnlighet och erotik I–II, 1883 and 1890 respectively), Anne Charlotte Leffler describes a moral w...\n\nEddic heroic poetry is known for its striking women: many are formidable, scheming, disobedient and uncompromising characters who frequently manage to follow their own agendas rather than those thrust upon them by men. Brynhildr is the primary example but characters who have received less attention, such as Oddrún and Borgný of Oddrúnargrátr, deviate in other ways, pursuing covert extra-marital sexual relationships. Principally, women use language rather than actions to carve out their roles and to subvert gender norms; speech acts (as defined by J. L. Austin and developed by John Searle and others) such as laments, prophesies, incitements and oaths, uttered by women and mainly directed at men, are used to claim female subjectivity and autonomy. Brynhildr, typically viewed in terms of whetting, is the archetypal ‘speaker’ and her identity is constructed through her speech throughout the Poetic Edda. Brynhildr’s oath-taking (e.g. in Sigurðarkviða in skamma), opens up the question whether she thus appropriates a masculine subject position and performs a male-coded speech act, and consequently, whether her vows are for this reason ‘infelicitous’ in Austin’s terms. In addition to uttering oaths, Brynhildr must frequently, particularly in Guðrúnarkviða I and after her death in Helreið Brynhildar, defend herself against accusations of social deviance and immorality. Rather than subscribing to a notion of female solidarity, women often quarrel about appropriate female conduct; Brynhildr’s excessive language and behaviour after Sigurðr’s death is juxtaposed with other women’s indictments of her but their attempts to silence her unrestrained retorts are futile. In Guðrún’s laments, she more subtly calls attention to the grief her family have caused her, and her refusal to act or speak after Sigurðr’s death as well as her attempts to resist the machinations of her deceitful family signal her later deviance. Making use of feminist and poststructuralist theory, especially on language and subjectivity, female characters will be examined as sites of struggle over appropriate behaviour: women’s words and deeds are seen as an outlet for social critique with the potential to subvert the dominant order and express anxieties about their power.\n\nThough many have recently attempted either to locate Arendt within feminism or feminism within the great body of Arendt&#39;s work, these efforts have proven only modestly successful. Even a cursory examination of Arendt&#39;s work should suggest that these efforts would prove frustrating. None of her voluminous writings deal specifically with gender, though some of her work certainly deals with notable women. Her interest is not in gender as such, but in woman as assimilated Jew or woman as social and political revolutionary. In this paper, I argue that Arendt recognized that what frequently passes for a gender question is not essentially a matter of gender at all, but rather an idiosyncratic form of loneliness that typically affects, though is by no means limited to, women. In her work one finds the conceptual tools necessary to understand the “woman problem” rather than an explicit argument or a solution to it."
