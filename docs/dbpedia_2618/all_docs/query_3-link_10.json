        "text": "I am adding a different genre to my reviews, that of classics. I will add in a book review of some classic that has occupied my shelf, and my mind for some time, that I will make time to read (or re-read) and write about here. These are books that have either long been on my TBR list, or books that impacted my mind long ago, and deserved revisiting at this time.\n\nKristin Lavransdatter is a trilogy of books written by Norwegian author Sigrid Undset, for which she won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. The three novels are The Bridal Wreath (published in 1920), The Mistress of Husaby (1921) and The Cross (1922.) The first translation into English from Norwegian was by Charles Archer and J.S. Scott, published by Knopf. Some readers may find this a difficult translation to read, and may prefer the more modern American translation by Tiina Nunnally, for Penguin, from 1997-2000. I liked the archaic, stiffer translation by Archer, but sometimes the meaning was hard to decipher. I liked the effort, as it felt appropriate for the period when the story took place, mid-fourteenth century Norway. If you think the language could prove a barrier, by all means read the more modern translation. There are many rewards for plowing through this classic work.\n\nThe three novels move though the life of Kristin Lavransdatter, beginning at about age four, on the manor farm, Jorundgaard, of her father, Lavrans Bjorgulfson and mother, Ragnfrid. Medieval Norwegian custom of naming appears to have been a surname reflective of your father; hence Kristin’s surname her whole life was Lavaransdatter (daughter of Lavrans). Her father’s surname, Bjogulfson, the son of Bjorgulf. This will help you to understand who is related to whom as you dive in. I will insert here a chart I found online that lays out the cast and their relationships. In broad strokes, Kristin grows up, has romances, then marries her husband in book one; in book two, her life as wife and mother of seven sons takes place; and finally in book three we learn the fate of her husband, her children, then finally the end of Kristin’s life.\n\nUndset received special praise for her accuracy of depiction of medieval life in Norway, with respect to daily life and customs. This is a valid reason to read these stories, to learn more about the lives of people at different social strata, the expectations, limitations, and hardships of men and women. Undset weaves in ancient, pre-Church mythology and practices, medical beliefs and practices, demands and expectations of rulers, knights, clergy, tradesmen, and farmers. This was pre-Reformation Norway, a time when the Roman Catholic Church was the faith of the land. Marriages were important for both possession and inheritance of land and wealth, as well as certainty of parentage. Undset is a gifted author both in terms of these various details, as well as getting into the psychology of her characters. She creates real, distinct people, getting into the heads of most of our principal characters, conveying a sense of their motivation, strengths, and weaknesses. There are few cardboard cutouts here. I especially enjoyed the fact that you knew characters over long periods of time, could see how they would grow, or get stunted by life’s hard knocks, reflect on examples of others, and adapt and try to improve their behavior and treatment of others. Undset is so good at giving character sketches, allowing situations to reveal character, people’s talents, and shortcomings.\n\nAnother enjoyable aspect to her writing is her beautiful descriptions of nature. Most of the time we see the world through Kristin’s eyes, and she is always a sharp observer of the natural world. Since this pre-technological, agrarian, Christian world brought people much closer to living in harmony with nature, as well as their livelihood, health, and survival often determined by their ability to understand the rhythms of the natural world, careful observation and appreciation of nature was paramount. The reader will feel the joys of spring bursting forth after a long Norwegian winter, the cold and beauty of deep, dark winter, and the pleasure of being tucked in to your warm cabin by a roaring fire, drinking home brewed ale, snug in animal skin blankets. Undset portrays the majesty of the snow-covered mountains, great green valleys, and the sharp freshness of the waters of the fjord and rivers.\n\nI especially liked Undset’s descriptions of the interior religious experiences of Kristin: her awesome view of the interiors of great churches, her prayer life for her pregnancies and children’s lives, and her reflections on the lives of her parents, especially her father, who was described as a strongly faithful, giving, beloved man by his community. Kristin views his example as her North Star, at first harshly judging her husband for how far short of this model he falls, then later judging her own life against this example.\n\nI did not dive into plot details too much in this review, although there are many places where I could, and would, describe and urge you to read and enjoy. The entire arc of Kristin’s romance and marriage with Erland Nikulausson is fascinating and enjoyable on many levels. Kristin’s relationships with her parents, and how this impacts her later choices is interesting. Kristin’s experiences during each of her eight pregnancies and childbirths, her parenting choices, and her self-reflections when later seeing her children’s life choices, is fascinating. These are just some highlights of character and plot you may find intriguing. Do not choose to read only one or two of this series. If you embark, go on the entire journey to really reap the benefits. So much is to be gained and enjoyed from this historical fiction trilogy. I highly recommend it to you."
