        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nby SVERRE ARESTAD 7 Hamsun and America The in translation modest purpose four short of this stories contribution and a summary is to present of a in translation four short stories and a summary of a fifth - whose length precludes its inclusion - which set forth in fictional form some of the experiences of Knut Hamsun in America. First, however, it is best to place this well-known author in the larger context of Norwegian-American literary relations from about 1880 to the present. The nature and variety of this literary relationship can be suggested without exhausting the subject. Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen (1848-1895) , novelist, poet, critic, and professor of Germanic literature at Cornell and Columbia universities, enjoys the distinction of being the first Norwegian-born writer to win recognition in America. Before the end of the century, he had made his contribution as a realistic novelist with the American rather than the immigrant scene as his province. Distinction of another kind came to O. E. R0lvaag (18791931 ) , also Norwegian-born, who has long been identified as the American novelist who had the Norwegian immigrant as his subject. Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) also has some small claim to recognition in this context, because he was the only major Norwegian writer who produced fictional works about American as distinguished from Norwegian- American life. These include five short stories whose locale is Chicago, the Dakotas, and Minnesota, and parts of such novels as Land 148 HAMSUN AND AMERICA strykere (The Vagabonds) , published in 1927, and his last book, Pâ gjengrodde stier (On Overgrown Paths) , which appeared in 1949. Several other well-known Norwegian writers established relationships with America during the half century following 1880, notably Bj0rnstjerne Bj0rnson, Sigbjprn Obstfelder, and Herman Wildenvey. Kristofer Janson, an author of lesser merit, had settled in Minneapolis in 1881 as a Unitarian minister, and Hamsun had Uved at his home during a part of the time he stayed in that city. Later, Johan Bojer and Sigrid Undset were to remain for varying lengths of time in this country. Bj0rnson spent parts of 1880 and 1881 in New England , principally in Boston, and in the Middle West. Hamsun arrived in 1882, returned to Norway in 1885, and made a second visit from 1886 to 1888. Obstfelder came in the summer of 1890 and returned home in August, 1891. Wildenvey 's first visit was from 1903 to 1905, his second in 1935, and his third in 1950. Bojer made a single trip to the United States in 1923, specifically to the Middle West and Alaska. I suspect that Sigrid Undset should be termed a refugee from the Nazis during a part of World War II. With the exception of Janson and Undset, a variety of reasons brought these writers to America. The American-born Sara Thorp, Ole Bull's second wife, had been widowed in 1880. In his funeral oration for the famous Norwegian violinist , Bj0rnson made reference to Miss Thorp, obviously with the purpose of ameliorating the feeling against her that was shared by Ole Bull's children and members of their mother's family. Exceedingly grateful for the gesture made in her behalf by the most popular literary figure in Norway, she invited Bj0rnson to visit Cambridge, where under her aegis and management he would meet the literary élite of New England . Bj0rnson came, but after a short period of conformity with the wishes of his hostess, he fled to the Middle West. He made his headquarters in Madison, Wisconsin, and from there set out on a lecture tour - during one of the worst 149 Sverre Atestad winters on record - to address his former countrymen throughout the Midwest. He returned to Norway with $10,000 , which he sorely needed to apply against his huge personal debt. Knut Hamsun, who had already dedicated himself to a literary career, came, at the exhortation and advice of Bj0rnson , whom he had visited at Aulestad after the latter's trip to America. At the time Hamsun hoped to become the poet of the Norwegians in the United States. This advice may well be the poorest ever offered an untested author by a seasoned one. Obstfelder, on the other hand, did not..."
