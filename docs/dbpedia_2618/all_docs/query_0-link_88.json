        "text": "May 20, 1982, wIll mark the centenary of the birth of one of the greatest Catholic writers of the twentieth century, the Norwegian novelist Sigrid Undset. It is important that we honor her memory on this occasion, not only because such homage to a significant modern witness to the Faith is in every way fitting, but also because the profound wisdom and power of her work can be of such benefit to our troubled Church in these times. Regrettably, there is little likelihood that the hundredth anniversary of her birth will generate for her literary achievement the degree of attention it deserves among scholarly and literary circles, even of catholic orientation. In some measure this neglect is the result of accidents of birth. Norway is hardly the cultural center of europe; and, although her major novels have been translated into all the principal european languages and some non-european languages, literary scholars do not generally work with translations. Moreover, such scholarly attention as Norwegian literature has received in Europe and America is usually devoted to Henrik Ibsen-a figure far more agreeable to the modern climate of opinion. To compound the error of her place of birth, Undset also chose a bad year: 1982 is also the centenary of the birth of James Joyce, and it is doubtful whether most journals specializing in modern literature will notice much else at this time.\n\nWe believe that the novels of Sigrid Undset merit continued attention merely as works of literature judged by literary standards. still, they are of particular value to catholics and deserve to be remembered and-above all-read by the faithful. as a part of the apostolate of scholarship discussed in this space in our previous number, we propose to devote a forthcoming number in the 1982 volume of Faith & Reason to essays about Sigrid Undset; and we wish to take this opportunity to issue a “call for papers” for this special purpose. Obviously we are hoping to receive submissions from scholars with expertise in Scandinavian literature, but we also plan to consider critical essays, or essays of general scholarly interest, which treat Undset’s works in translation. Send all manuscripts for this special number of F&R to the associate editor; R.V. Young, Jr. / Department of English / N.C. State University, P.o. box 5308 / Raleigh, N.C. 27650.\n\nIn the meantime we wish to urge our readers who are unfamiliar with the works of Sigrid Undset to make a point of reading at least one between now and the centenary. Her generally acknowledged masterpiece is the trilogy dealing with medieval Norway, Kristin Lavransdatter (1920-22), which is still available in a one-volume hardbound edi- tion from knopf, and has been recently reissued in three inexpensive paperbound volumes (with rather lurid covers). her later and equally brilliant medieval tetralogy, The Master of Hestviken (1925-27), is likewise available from Knopf in a one-volume edition. Daughter of one of Norway’s most distinguished nineteenth-century archaeologists, Sigrid Undset displays remarkable erudition in her re-creation of the details of medieval life; but the achievement of her novels is by no means limited to antiquarian reconstruction, nor is there a trace of romanticization or sentimentality in her depiction of the great age of faith in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. (It is worth noting that Kristin Lavransdatter was published more than two years before Undset was received into the church late in 1924.) Instead, Undset gives a portrayal of an age in which the church labored with a violent and barbaric people, ever ready to lapse into paganism or sensuality. In her individual characters we see doubt, anguish, and obstinacy; lust, ambition, and greed, which remind us, perhaps, all too easily of ourselves. and yet the dynamic center of all her work is a fierce love of truth and a profound conviction of the goodness of God and his creation."
