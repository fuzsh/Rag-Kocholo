        "text": "Biography\n\nSigrid Undset was born in Kalundborg, Denmark in 1882. Her father was an archeologist. The family moved to Norway when she was two. She grew up in Oslo. Her father died when she was eleven, meaning the family could not afford to send her to university. She took a secretarial course and worked for an engineering company for ten years. While employed at office work, Undset wrote and studied. She started writing a historical novel when she was sixteen. She finished it when she was twenty-two but it was turned down for publication. She then wrote a shorter, contemporary novel which was at first turned down and then accepted. This wasFru Marta Oulie (Marta Oulie). It created something of a stir, dealing with adultery.\n\nShe went on to write books set in contemporary Oslo. She quit her job and travelled around Europe, spending nine months in Rome. There she met the Norwegian painter Anders Castus Svarstad who was married. After he was divorced, the couple married, spending time in London and Rome.\n\nAfter World War I, she moved to Lillehammer. The couple divorced and she and her children stayed in Lillehammer. She now started work on her best-known work, the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy, followed by Olav Audunssøn i Hestviken (OlavAudunssøn 1. The Vows) and the subsequent volumes in the four-part book. She continued writing both contemporary and historical books, as well as her memoirs. She won the Nobel Prize in 1928.\n\nAfter the German invasion, she fled to neutral Sweden and then to the United States, returning at the end of the war. She did not publish another word. She died in 1949.\n\nOther links\n\nSigrid Undset\n\nSigrid Undset\n\nSigrid Undset\n\nSigrid Undset\n\nLook to Norway An affectionate account of a national hero\n\nBjerkebækt (her home, now a museum)\n\nSigrid Undset (in Norwegian)\n\nBibliography\n\n1907 Fru Marta Oulie (Marta Oulie) (novel)\n\n1908 Den lykkelige alder (stories)\n\n1909 Fortællingen om Viga-Ljot og Vigdis (Gunnar’s Daughter) (novel)\n\n1910 Ungdom (poetry)\n\n1911 Jenny (Jenny))(novel)\n\n1912 Fattige skjebner (stories)\n\n1914 Våren (novel)\n\n1915 Fortellinger om Kong Artur og ridderne av Det runde bord, retelling of Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur\n\n1917 Splinten av troldspeilet (contains Fru Hjelde (Images in a Mirror (stories)\n\n1918 De kloge jomfruer (stories)\n\n1919 Et kvindesynspunkt (essays)\n\n1920 Vårskyer (stories)\n\n1920 Sankt Halvards liv, død og jærtegn, fortelling\n\n1920–22 Kristin Lavransdatter (Kristin Lavransdatter) (novel trilogy)\n\n1920 Kransen (The Wreath; later The Garland)\n\n1921 Husfrue (The Mistress of Husaby’later: The Wife)\n\n1922 Korset (The Cross)\n\n1925 Olav Audunssøn i Hestviken (The Axe); later: (OlavAudunssøn. 1.
