        "text": "Norwegian novelist Sigrid Undset addressed contemporary issues but also produced historical novels in which the Scandinavian Middle Ages figure prominently. Her texts often explore women’s identity as a struggle between a true self and prescribed sexual and social roles. Her novels include Fru Marta Oulie (1907), Jenny (1911), Kristin Lavransdotter (1920–22), and The Wild Orchard (1929). She was honored with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928."
