        "text": "More Scandinavian literature, this time from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. I won’t read it all, I am no kind of expert, I am stuck with English, etc. But it is easy to get me excited about literature, so suggestions are most welcome. And if anything looks appealing, perhaps we can read it together.\n\nDenmark\n\nAt the forefront are Hans Christian Andersen and Søren Kierkegaard. The former I read in some quantity just before I started Wuthering Expectations, which was a while ago, I admit, but close enough that I doubt I will revisit him now. The latter is, I fear, a philosopher, and thus spinach. In real life, I like spinach, so that is just a metaphor.\n\nMore to the point are two short books by Jens Peter Jacobsen, the 1880 novel Niels Lyhne and the 1882 collection Mogens and Other Stories. Jacobsen has had a strange career in English, kept alive by the glowing testimony of Rainer Maria Rilke in Letters to a Young Poet, where Rilke seems to rank Jacobsen with the Bible. I should see for myself.\n\nAnother novel, Pelle the Conqueror (1910) by Martin Andersen Nexø, I have meant to read for twenty-five years since I saw the magnificent 1987 Bille August film adaptation. The novel will unfortunately not feature Max von Sydow, but it likely has other virtues. It is long – the film only covered a fraction of the book – and grim. I have no idea how it is written.\n\nIsak Dinesen’s work is from the 1930s and later, but so many of her stories are set in Denmark’s past that she would fit well with the older writers. I am thinking of Seven Gothic Tales (1934) and Winter’s Tales (1942) in particular.\n\nBy chance, unconnected to this project, I began reading the contemporary conceptual poet Inger Christensen, and I would like to continue my study of her work. And I mean study – anyone want to help me work on her cosmic long 1969 poem it? It (it) features elaborate mathematical patterns – tempting, yes?\n\nSweden\n\nEven poking around, I still know nothing about Swedish literature. August Strindberg obviously tops the list, and I hope to read a number of his plays, ranging from the 1888 Miss Julie to the strange 1907 Ghost Sonata. But there are also novels, stories, essays, some freshly translated. Please, I beg you, recommendations, guidance.\n\nThe Queen’s Diadem (1834) by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist is a novel I encountered a year ago in this post by seraillon. It is either deeply original, or a knockoff of E. T. A. Hoffmann, or something in between. The Hoffmann connection by itself would give me something to write about.\n\nHjalmar Söderberg is another novelist I met through book blogs. I have read a number of convincing posts about his short, intense 1905 novel Doctor Glas. If I like it, there are a couple of other Söderberg books in English.\n\nNorway\n\nHenrik Ibsen, of course. I have read six Ibsen plays, I realize, yet I still feel at sea. I want to read or re-read a good chunk of them, although I will likely follow conventional opinion and ignore his early phase. Critics are always dividing Ibsen’s work into phases. Expect lots of Ibsen.\n\nKnut Hamsun had a long, complicated career, but I know him from his early novels Hunger (1890) and Pan (1894). Talk about intense. I would like to revisit those and also read another from the same run, Mysteries (1892). Then – then I don’t know. Hunger would likely make my Top 50 Novels of the 19th Century list, if I were to make such a thing.\n\nOff the track – far, far off – is Farthest North (1897) by Fridtjof Nansen, a favorite of min kone, the account of his insane attempt to reach the North Pole by freezing his ship in the winter ice. Eventually, he just decided to walk. Utterly nuts. Sounds wonderful.\n\nNow, some trouble. Henrik Pontoppidan, Karl Gjellerup, Selma Lagerlöf, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, Verner von Heidenstam, Frans Eemil Sillanpää – the early Scandinavian Nobelists, the ones who, unlike Hamsun or Sigrid Undset lost their place in English, or never had one. I gaze upon these names in ignorant awe.\n\nI have often thought that it would be a great book blog project to sort through these and other old prize winners. I do not believe it is my project. Yet already comments in the previous post have me warily eying a long, recently translated Pontoppidan novel, the 1904 Lucky Per, which sounds either like a standard attempt to move Naturalism into Danish, or else something much stranger. Hmm hmm hmm.\n\nPlease feel free to correct my errors and recommend more books."
