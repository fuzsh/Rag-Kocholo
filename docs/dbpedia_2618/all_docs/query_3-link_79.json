        "text": "Sigrid Undset is best known for her novel Kristin Lavransdatter, which earned her the Nobel Prize in 1928. Although she is acclaimed for the historical and psychological realism of this portrait of a 14th Norwegian woman, her novels also contain a deeper layer of richness that can only properly be appreciated through a theological lens. In this lecture, Fr. Snyder will present some of Undset’s stories of conversion in light of St. Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of grace. Undset’s writings illustrate to modern readers the beauty of a heart transformed by the God who is ever ancient and ever new."
