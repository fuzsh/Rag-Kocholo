        "text": "The Royal Medal is a silver-gilt medal, of which three are awarded each year by the Royal Society. It is also known as The King's Medal and The Queen's Medal (depending on the monarch at the time of the award),\n\nThe awards are for work done within the Commonwealth of Nations. The award was created by George IV and awarded first in 1826.\n\nAt present, three medals are awarded each year. Two are for fundamental research (\"the advancement of natural knowledge\") in the physical and biological sciences). One is for applied research (\"distinguished contributions in the applied sciences\").\n\nImages for kids\n\nDowling: Professor, Cambridge University, 2019.\n\nWolpert: Professor, UCL, UK, 2018.\n\nHunter: Professor, Salk Institute, USA, 2014.\n\nKibble: Professor, Imperial College, UK, 2012.\n\nSee also"
