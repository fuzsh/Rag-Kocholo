        "text": "Nevil Maskelyne (born Oct. 6, 1732, London—died Feb. 9, 1811, Greenwich, London) was a British astronomer noted for his contribution to the science of navigation.\n\nMaskelyne was ordained a minister in 1755, but his interest in astronomy had been aroused by the eclipse of July 25, 1748. In 1758 he was admitted to the Royal Society of London, which in 1761 sent him to the island of St. Helena to observe a transit of Venus. During the voyage he experimented with the determination of longitude by observations of the Moon’s position and introduced this method into navigation by publishing The British Mariner’s Guide (1763). Succeeding Nathaniel Bliss as astronomer royal in 1765, he published the first volume of the Nautical Almanac in 1766 and continued the supervision of the almanac until his death.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAstronomy and Space Quiz"
