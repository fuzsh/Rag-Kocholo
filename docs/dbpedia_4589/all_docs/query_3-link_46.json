        "text": "Time Period: Pre-WW1\n\nInstitution: 4 September 1865\n\nCountry: Denmark\n\nThe Royal Medal of Recompense (or Den Kongelige Belønningsmedalje in Danish) is a prestigious Danish medal awarded at the discretion of the Monarch. Established by King Christian IX, the medal is currently given to individuals who have dedicated 40 or 50 years of service to the same private employer.\n\nThis honor was created by King Christian IX through an ordinance on 4 September 1865. The statutes governing the medal are updated with each new Danish monarch, with the latest statutes adopted on 1 November 1972 and minor amendments made on 28 November 1986 and 25 January 1988.\n\nProduced by the Royal Mint of Denmark, the medal is round and measures 28 millimeters in diameter. It is available in gilded silver (gold medals) or plain silver and comes in versions with or without a crown surmounting the medal.\n\nThe obverse features a profile effigy of Queen Margrethe II, encircled by the inscription “Margareta II – Regina Daniæ.” The reverse displays a wreath of oak leaves. Each recipient’s name is engraved on the edge, signifying that the medal is their personal property and does not need to be returned upon their death, unlike some chivalric orders.\n\nThe medal is suspended from a red ribbon with a white cross."
