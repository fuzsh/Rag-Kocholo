        "text": "Michele was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award during Reunion June 2023.\n\nMichele E. Fabrizio C’73 is the 2023 recipient of the Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award. She entered Drew in 1969 and became editor-in-chief of The Acorn. While working on an anti-war committee, she met fellow Drew student Bob Kopech, who became her husband. After graduation, she began a career in book and magazine publishing.\n\nAfter doing some professional work for the University, she became involved in the Alumni Association, served as its president and in 1989 was elected to the Drew Board of Trustees, the youngest Board member at that time.\n\nShortly after joining the Board, Michele and Bob were transferred to London with their children, but she did not pause her involvement with Drew. She attended Board meetings on campus and began hosting the successive groups of London Semester students for a literary tour of Hampstead, followed by a reception at their Hampstead Village home. She also worked with the Fulbright Foundation on the largest college fair in Europe, and with the help of Drew students in London, sent a number of international students to Madison.\n\nNow a trustee Emerita, her service spanned three presidents, two interims, the renovation of the Shakespeare Theatre, and the construction of the Dorothy Young Center for the Arts.\n\nThroughout her service, Michele was known as a champion of the entirety of Drew, from students to faculty, and for selflessly and sincerely presenting her views.\n\nDianne was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award during a virtual ceremony in June 2020.\n\nWhen visiting potential colleges during her senior year of high school, Dianne immediately felt that Drew would be the perfect choice for her. Although the number of required courses for a major in chemistry at Drew were extensive, she was still able to enjoy courses in French, German, literature and art. Her extracurricular activities included water ballet, Drew-Eds, Green Key, Oak Leaf art editor, Acorn staff, dormitory council, freshman orientation committee, Sigma Tau Sigma, Kappa Pi, Sigma Phi and social chair of her junior and senior classes. She held part time jobs as a life guard, library staffer and chemistry department student assistant, and gave 50 cent haircuts to dorm mates. These were four wonderful years!\n\nAs graduation approached, Dianne had to choose between applying to medical or graduate school. She finally decided to major in biochemistry at the Duke University Medical School. Dianne earned her PhD with a National Institute of Health fellowship. During her final semester, she took an elective course, taught by a team of biochemists and physicians that examined the biochemical basis of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). This sparked an interest that informed the rest of her professional career.\n\nDianne accepted a two year post-doctoral fellowship at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in pediatric biochemistry. Her laboratory work involved developing methodology and procedures for newborn screening for rare IEM. She was also assigned to re-design the biochemistry course taught to first year medical students. Dianne began using the pathology of rare IEM to illustrate biochemical pathways. Student evaluations of the revised course led to her first teaching award. As interest and experience with IEM grew, Dianne received her first large research grant, began recruiting graduate students, continued to develop newborn screening methodology and teach.\n\nDianne soon realized that the most rewarding aspect of studying IEM was direct patient contact so she enrolled in the MPH program at UNC School of Public Health. Eventually, Dianne was promoted to Professor of Pediatrics at the UNC Medical School where she had a patient load of approximately 300 children and adults with rare IEM treated via dietary/nutritional intervention. She continued to develop protocols for newborn screening for these IEM and helped North Carolina become the first state to implement a program for screening > 20 IEM. During her academic career, she authored more than 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters and presented over 100 invited lectures, nationally and internationally. She was tapped for membership to the Drew University Silver Tower Society, honored by the Southeastern Genetics Group for her service, received the Lifetime Contribution Award by the Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International and was granted the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, the highest civilian recognition for service to the people of N.C, by the N.C. governor.\n\nDuring these years, Dianne and her husband, Jim, raised two lovely daughters: Becky (deceased) and Jenny (Drew C’97). Jenny is now a senior vice president at Nielsen and has two lovely daughters of her own. Dianne has taught Sunday school, was a Girl Scout leader and volunteer, is a church volunteer, is trying to reach her goal of reading 100 books per year, and is finishing the course work for a certificate/master’s degree in botanical illustration. Antiquing, hiking and travelling have been Jim’s and Dianne’s favorite leisure time activities.\n\nDianne credits her wonderful training and experiences at Drew for her enthusiasm for seeking answers to life’s mysteries.\n\nRobert was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award during Reunion 2010.\n\nRobert Drew Simpson has been involved with Drew for most of his life, but his roots here go even deeper—back to his great-great uncle, Daniel Drew. Bob himself visited the campus with church groups, entered with the class of 1945, and has been engaged with Drew ever since.\n\nAfter graduating with a religion major, Bob followed the call to Christian ministry. He immediately went to nearby Mt. Tabor United Methodist Church, where he led the congregation in constructing their first church building. Fourteen years later, after earning a B.D. degree and a Ph.D. from Drew, he moved to Nutley, N.J., again leading a congregation in church-building. In 1965 he began a 25-year ministry at the Chatham United Methodist Church, even closer to Drew.\n\nHis Chatham congregation named him Pastor Emeritus upon his retirement in 1990, and named their Christian education building for Bob and his wife, Megan; in 2008 they created the Simpson Christian Education Fund to assist church members who attend theological seminary. Members of the congregation have created two named scholarships at Drew Theological School to honor the Simpsons: the Robert Drew Simpson Scholarship, and the Dr. Robert Drew Simpson and Dr. Megan Demarest Simpson Scholarship. Bob assisted a third member in initiating the Betty H. Welsh Scholarship here.\n\nAs Bob says, he has always been involved with Drew. He served on the Advancement and Executive Committees of the Theological School Alumni Association, and remains a honorary member of the Executive Board. He also served on the Theological Editorial Board, the Theological Planned Giving Committee, and the Dean’s Advisory Board, and was Honorary Grand Marshal at President Weisbuch’s inauguration. A Drew Trustee from 1977 to 1997, he was chair of the Student Affairs and Campus Life Committee, and vice-chair of the Honorary Degrees Committee. He is a 1994 recipient of the Drew Theological School Alumni Distinguished Service Award.\n\nBob also taught pastoral ministry in the Theological School, and was an archivist in the Methodist Archives on campus for 14 years after his retirement. He and Megan have produced six books and numerous articles on history and biography.\n\nBob did not initially favor Drew’s admission of women in the 40s. He remembers inveighing against coeducation, only to meet and fall in love with Megan Demarest C’46 a few days later. They have now been married for 64 years, and have three children, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Bob and Megan, who received her Ph.D. from Drew in 1980 and taught English literature in the College, live in the United Methodist home, Bristol Glen, in Newton, New Jersey, still within reach of Drew.\n\nJohn was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award during Reunion 2008.\n\nWe all know that some of Drew’s most notable faculty members have become living legends. Drew also has legendary alumni/ae, and one of them is John Cunningham, who has become a legend in his own time by bringing us the facts.\n\nJohn has always seen himself as a journalist. He began writing for the Morris County Daily Record as a Morristown High School student, continuing while he was at Drew, and later spent 23 years as a reporter for the Newark Sunday News. He approaches history with a journalist’s quest for truth and a style that engages non-historians. His accuracy, his knowledge of New Jersey, and his appealing style have earned him recognition as “New Jersey’s popular historian,” as he was named by the New Jersey Historical Association.\n\nIt is hard to imagine an aspect of New Jersey history untouched by John’s pen. He is now preparing the fifth revision of his first book, This is New Jersey (1953), which has never gone out of print. Other popular titles include New Jersey: America’s Main Road; The New Jersey Sampler; NEWARK; and Railroads in New Jersey. His magazine articles, including a cover story in National Geographic, have covered the state’s natural wonders. Thousands of young people have learned their New Jersey history from You, New Jersey and the World and On the Go in New Jersey, written for third and fourth graders. New Jersey: A Mirror on America is widely used in secondary schools and colleges. He has made over 20 documentary films, receiving an Emmy for his film on immigration, Dreams of Distant Shores, and he has been honored by the American Association for State and Local History, the New Jersey Audubon Society, and the Great Swamp Watershed Association. He co-founded the New Jersey Historical Commission, and has served as its chair and as president of the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\nJohn has not forgotten that Drew is an integral part of New Jersey. His University in the Forest, first published in 1990, has been revised twice. He and Regina Diverio G’96 published a pictorial survey of Drew in The College History Series (Arcadia, 2000). This past April he held a Drew audience spellbound on the subject of his 50th and latest book, The Uncertain Revolution: Washington and the Continental Army at Morristown. His planned gift to Drew will fund a College of Liberal Arts scholarship in his name and that of his late wife, Dorothy.\n\nNor has Drew been unaware of John. This is his third Alumni/ae Achievement Award, following the Award in the Arts in 1955 and the Service Award in 1980. He was the first alumnus to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and received one of his eight honorary degrees from Drew in 1976. Rutgers has called John “Mr. Jersey,” but as we present him with the Lifetime Achievement Award, we are proud to call him “Mr. Drew.”\n\nClint will be honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2024.\n\nClint Bolick C’79 is the 2024 recipient of the Alumni Award for Achievement in Liberal Arts. After graduating from Drew with a major in Political Science and History, Clint went on to study law at University of California–Davis. He currently serves as an Associate Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, first elected in 2016, then re-elected in 2018 for a six-year term.\n\nOver the span of 40 years, Clint has had a remarkable and prominent legal career, which he always credits back to Drew, and more specifically to political science courses with Professor Robert Smith C’36. He has litigated constitutional cases in state and federal courts from coast to coast, including the United States Supreme Court, and has held several leadership positions, including Vice President for Litigation at the Goldwater Institute; Co-founder and Vice President for Litigation at the Institute for Justice; and Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n\nAmong his many honors, Clint was named one of the 90 Greatest DC Lawyers in the Last 30 Years by Legal Times in 2008; received a Bradley Prize in 2006; and was recognized as one of the nation’s three Lawyers of the Year by American Lawyer in 2002 for his successful defense of school vouchers in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris.\n\nClint is a prolific author of a dozen books and hundreds of articles. He teaches constitutional law every fall at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor School of Law and lectures at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\nCathy was be honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during a virtual ceremony in June 2021.\n\nGrowing up in Jersey City, Catherine “Cathy” Zbyszynski Brennan’s concept of the public sector was one of rough and tumble politics. But after earning a Master’s Degree in Economics from the Graduate Faculty Division of the New School for Social Research, eight years after graduating from Drew, she discovered the world of professional public service.\n\nNearly three decades later, Cathy now serves as New Jersey’s Deputy State Treasurer in the Administration of Governor Phil Murphy, following almost 25 years with the Office of Legislative Services, the professional, non-partisan staff of the New Jersey State Legislature. Throughout her tenure, Cathy has played a role of increasing responsibility for every annual State appropriations act since Christie Todd Whitman’s first budget in 1994. Tapped for her current role at the beginning of the Murphy Administration by State Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio, Cathy transitioned to the Executive branch in 2018 where, among other responsibilities, she oversees the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Revenue and Economic Analysis within the New Jersey Department of the Treasury.\n\nA first-generation college graduate, Cathy has remained an engaged alumna, grateful for the transformational experience the “University in The Forest” afforded. She’s conducted admissions interviews and attended college fairs on Drew’s behalf, connected Drew students with jobs and internship opportunities and last year hosted Professor McGuinn’s PoliSci class in Trenton where students had the opportunity to meet with Governor Murphy and State Treasurer Muoio.\n\nWorking on State budget legislation, Cathy has had to pull her share of “all-nighters” under the State House dome, requiring a very supportive spouse. Fortunately, Cathy met and married Dan Brennan, the high school best friend of fellow Drew alum Neil Sheridan (C’86). Together, they have raised two sons, Connor and Colin, Cathy’s greatest sources of joy and accomplishment.\n\nBen was posthumously honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award at Reunion 2019.\n\nBenjamin D. Davol, 58, of Mystic, Connecticut passed away unexpectedly on Saturday, September 8, 2018 at Yale New Haven Hospital. Ben studied political science at Drew and pursued a career in political consulting. Ben’s father was a career naval officer who knew John McCain’s father. From age seven, Ben was aware of McCain’s imprisonment in Vietnam and eventually watched his 1973 release on television. Ben went on to run McCain’s successful 2000 presidential primary campaign efforts in Connecticut and New Hampshire. The campaign relied upon the tireless efforts of hundreds of volunteers, and Ben was credited with coordinating the troops with no money. McCain died in August 2018, and Ben was interviewed about him on National Public Radio. It was not anticipated that Ben would outlive him by only two weeks. Ben was also a writer, contributing to The Hartford Courant, The New London Day and other periodicals. The good qualities that were evident during Ben’s time at Drew—those of a caring and loyal friend—persisted into his career, setting Ben apart. He is remembered for the increasingly rare quality of spanning all politics, having friends of every political stripe. Of Ben’s many accomplishments, he was proudest of his role as father to Emily (of Washington, D.C.) and Charles (of Edgartown, Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts), who survive him.\n\nBarry was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award at Reunion 2019.\n\nBarry Fenstermacher graduated from Drew in 1969 with a religion major. He also was the College social chair and assisted his roommate in producing several notable rock concerts at Drew, including The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Chuck Berry, and Blood, Sweat and Tears.\n\nBarry briefly attended Yale Divinity School. During the 1970s, he taught, had an insurance business and qualified for the Million Dollar Roundtable, an industry award. Barry was also committed to social service work in Brooklyn and Queens, and he started a program to place developmentally disabled adults in small residential homes instead of larger state institutions.\n\nFrom 1980-2016, Barry worked at two independent schools in Westchester County, New York, serving as headmaster of The Harvey School in Katonah for thirty years (1986-2016). Barry also volunteered at the Bedford Correctional Center for women for 12 years and was trustee of three organizations: the New York State Association (NYSAIS), the Glenholme School in Connecticut and The National Sports Academy in Lake Placid, New York. Barry directed the NYSAIS Experienced Teachers Institute and Beginning Teachers Institute and conducted numerous accreditation/evaluation visits to over 16 NYSAIS member schools.\n\nAfter graduation from Drew, Barry served as president of the College Alumni Association Board for four years, was a trustee for eight years and assisted the Admissions Office in recruiting independent school graduates from Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York. Barry also arranged a speaking engagement for Drew President, Governor Tom Kean, as keynote at the NYSAIS annual meeting and hosted a luncheon at The Harvey School for President Kean to meet with more than 25 local independent school heads. Over time, Barry has successfully recruited approximately 15 students to enroll at Drew from the schools he served.\n\nBarry is married to Rowena Fenstermacher, a retired classics teacher and author. They divide their time between their home in Dutchess County, New York and Rose Bay, Nova Scotia. He is an avid boater in Nova Scotia and a local community volunteer in New York.\n\nKaren was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2017.\n\nAfter graduating from Drew in 1968, James Freeman, together with several Drew classmates, entered the Graduate School at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received a Master’s degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1973, both in philosophy. He then taught at IU Bloomington, Butler University in Indianapolis, and Bloomfield College in New Jersey. In 1975, he went to the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia as a research associate. In 1978, he joined the faculty of Hunter College of The City University of New York and became a professor there in 1993. He served as acting chair of the department, 1989-90, and chair, 1992-1998.\n\nKaren Hunter C’87 can only be described as one of Drew’s hardest working, distinguished and most visible alumni—and is a testament to the power of a liberal arts education. She is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist, a celebrated radio talk-show host, is the co-author of numerous New York Times bestsellers and hosts the Karen Hunter Show on SiriusXM.\n\nAfter graduating from Drew with a degree in English, she began her career as a sports writer for the New York Daily News in 1988, becoming the paper’s first African-American female columnist. She served four years on the Daily News’ four-member editorial board and, in 1999, was a member of news teams that won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Polk Award. In 2002, she became a professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies at Hunter College, where she is currently a distinguished lecturer. In 2007 she founded Karen Hunter Publishing, an imprint of Pocket Books/Simon & Schuster.\n\nKaren is also an advocate for social change: She initiated the petition that led to the South Carolina legislature’s vote to remove the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina Statehouse.\n\nMaryann was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2016.\n\nAfter graduating from Drew in 1968, James Freeman, together with several Drew classmates, entered the Graduate School at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received a Master’s degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1973, both in philosophy.

He immersed himself in his political science major, benefiting from the inspired teaching of “Prof” Smith and Julius Mastro, and began to explore the world. He not only enrolled in the London and Washington Semesters, but in 1961–62, he and six other students spent 13 months in a 28,000-mile goodwill tour of Latin American universities, postponing George’s graduation for a year.\n\nKaren Hunter C’87 can only be described as one of Drew’s hardest working, distinguished and most visible alumni—and is a testament to the power of a liberal arts education.

It was a difficult time to decide on one’s life, but to Barry, coming to Drew from his home in Peapack-Gladstone, N.J., studying the liberal arts was a perfect choice. He fully benefited from the close community and individual attention from the faculty, especially from Julius Mastro, John von der Heide and Perry Leavell in political science and history.\n\nBarry expected to go to law school after graduation, but working in a Wall Street law firm persuaded him to look elsewhere for satisfy the interests he had developed at Drew. He was recommended to the Woolworth Corporation for a legal matter, and there he found satisfying work. At Woolworth, he initially worked on special projects before becoming corporate secretary and then vice president for public affairs, and finally became the company’s youngest senior vice president, chief administrative officer and member of the five-person chairman’s group. He was never pigeonholed at work, he says, because he was a generalist by education, and that suited him perfectly. While at Woolworth, he was selected as a David Rockefeller Fellow, exposing him to leaders and issues in the private, public and nonprofit sectors of New York City.\n\nThen changes at Woolworth, and opportunities closer to home, convinced Barry that he would prefer a change himself. Leaving Woolworth in 1996, he spent a summer in architecture and urban planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Since then he has been a consultant on management and corporate governance; a trustee, director and officer of nonprofit organizations; and a student, writer and lecturer in historical preservation and architectural history.\n\nHis deep interest in architectural history led Barry back to the Somerset County, N.J., area where he grew up. As a founder and director of two nonprofit organizations, the Blairsden Association and the Natirar Association, he worked with government officials and private donors to preserve two architecturally, historically and culturally significant large estates in Somerset County. During this time he met a local realtor, the late John K. Turpin, who shared his interest in Somerset history and architecture. Their work together culminated in a two-volume work, New Jersey Country Houses: The Somerset Hills, in 2004–2005. Barry has contributed articles on various historical topics to several area journals.\n\nBarry has been active in New York City, serving on the boards of trustees of the Downtown Alliance, Friends of P.S. 165, the Bruno Walter Foundation, the New York Choral Society, and also with New Jersey ARC, for which he produced a documentary film on the advantages of employing persons with developmental disabilities.\n\nRobert was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2010.\n\nMany people don’t think of the military in conjunction with the liberal arts, but Major General Robert Schmidle can prove them wrong any day. His life has continued to include scholarship, as he has progressed from a history major at Drew to high-ranking service in the U.S. Marines.\n\nA short stint in the business world after graduation did not inspire Robert; he had always wanted to serve his country; and he wanted to fly. After his first assignment to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 333, he served as instructor pilot, Operations Officer, Aircraft Maintenance Officer, and, in 1990, as Executive Officer in Southwest Asia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In 1993 he deployed to Aviano, Italy, as the Commanding Officer of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 251. He led the squadron flying missions in support of Operations Deny Flight, preventing the Serbians from flying in Bosnia, and Provide Promise, delivering goods to Bosnian Serbs in snow-bound mountains. In 1998 he commanded the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force, responsible for conducting warfighting experiments.\n\nHis staff appointments have included Military Secretary to both the 32nd and 33rd Commandants of the Marine Corps, and Director of the Expeditionary Force Development Center. He served as Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing from June 2007 to July 2008, before becoming Assistant Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources and the Marines’ lead for the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. He has received numerous medals and commendations.\n\nScholarship is a continuing part of Robert’s life. He is a distinguished graduate and former faculty member of the Marine Corps Command and Staff College—where he realized how well Drew taught him to write. He is also a distinguished graduate of the Marine Corps War College. The author of numerous publications, he earned an M.A. in philosophy from American University, and is now pursuing a interdisciplinary doctorate combining social psychology, philosophy, and literature at Georgetown University. His greatest satisfactions, aside from family, have come from the challenges of command; from reading, writing, and publishing; and from serving our country.\n\nRobert and Pamela Jutkus Schmidle C’74 live in Washington, D.C. Pamela, a special education teacher, is now on the faculty of George Washington University. They have two sons: Nicholas (married to Rikki), a prize-winning journalist specializing in terrorism and Middle Eastern affairs, and Captain Christian Schmidle, USMC, who is moving to the Special Forces after serving two tours in Iraq. It’s clear that “Drew and Do” has been vital to Bob’s and Pam’s lives, and they have passed on the ideal of thoughtful public service to their children.\n\nKevin was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2009.\n\nWhen Kevin Murphy graduated magna cum laude from Drew with honors in Theatre Arts, people in The Forest thought he was a creative young man who would do well. His two musicals had been produced on Drew’s mainstage, and he had written two television scripts. Drew was right—he has expanded upon his College theatre experience with great success. And Kevin is especially grateful to Drew because he has continued to work with two classmates: his television writing partner, Ed Ferrara C’89, and his musical theatre partner, Dan Studney C’89.\n\nKevin spent nine months waiting tables in Los Angeles before he landed his first television staff writing job. Since then, he has spent 19 years as a writer/producer of television series and TV movies. He was co-executive producer and head writer for the first three seasons of the smash hit “Desperate Housewives,” which won two Golden Globes, an Emmy nomination, a People’s Choice Award, and a Satellite Award, all for Best Comedy; Kevin’s individual contributions were singled out with a Prism Award and two consecutive Writers Guild Award nominations for television comedy script of the year. He co-created the syndicated TV version of Disney’s “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” and the CW’s “Valentine,” and his credits also include the CW’s “Reaper,” NBC’s “Ed,” “Get Real,” “Jack & Jill,” “Weird Science,” “So Weird,” “Dennis the Menace,” and a revival of the “Munsters” TV franchise for Fox.\n\nMuch as he enjoys writing for television, Kevin’s first love is musical theatre. In 1998 he and Dan Studney co-wrote the book and provided lyrics for a musical adaptation of the 1936 movie Reefer Madness. Kevin and Dan produced Reefer Madness: The Musical in Los Angeles in 1999 and off-Broadway in New York two years later, and also produced a film version for Showtime. The stage productions have won five Ovation Awards, seven Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards, seven Garland Awards, the Helen Hayes Award for Best Musical, and a Drama Desk nomination for lyrics. The film version, which premiered at the 2005 Sundance Festival, won two Satellite Awards, was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards (winning in the category of Outstanding Music and Lyrics), and won the Audience Award at the Deauville Festival. He is currently workshopping two new stage musicals: an adaptation of the beloved comic strip “Dennis the Menace,” and an adaptation of the seminal 1989 black comedy “Heathers.”\n\nKevin was awarded an honorary degree by Drew in 2006. He and his wife Noreen, a television producer, live in Los Angeles with their 21-month-old son, Carter.\n\nPaul was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2008.\n\nPaul Boren loves public and community service, and working in national security. He says he owes his success to a liberal arts education, which taught him to think and communicate in a variety of situations, and to appreciate the arts.\n\nAfter Paul graduated cum laude with honors in history, double majoring in history and political science, he went on to George Washington University (M.A. 1984), American University, National Defense University, and Defense Acquisition University.\n\nPaul has had a 25-year Department of Defense career dedicated to national security, with emphasis on combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD). His jobs included arms control, international disarmament, non-proliferation, strategy, construction, program management, international development, and supporting combatant commanders. From 1992 to 2006, he worked cooperatively with other countries to secure or eliminate nuclear storage bunkers, bio labs, strategic bombers, submarines, and cruise and ballistic missiles. He helped secure Russian nuclear weapons and destroy bio-agents in the former Soviet Union, constructed chemical demilitarization and missile elimination plants, built over 1000 housing units in Ukraine and Belarus to help demobilize the 43rd Strategic Rocket Army (the largest nuclear force aimed at the United States), converted over 20 WMD firms into commercial fields, and negotiated with commercial, political and military leaders.\n\nPaul is currently deputy associate director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, where he provides planning, assessments, and technical support for combatant commanders and other government agencies as they combat WMD around the world.\n\nPaul is committed to Drew and to community service. In 2004 he was the first alumnus to speak at Drew’s Janet T. Siler International Affairs Forum, and two years later became the first alumnus to teach at Alumni/ae College. Also in 2006, he organized a reunion in London of Drew London semester students and faculty. He has served Drew as class secretary, on Reunion Committees, and in Alumni/ae in Admissions and other Drew posts. At home in Vienna, Virginia, he has led and volunteered in Scouting, sports, theatre, and many other community efforts.\n\nPaul is very happily married to Drew classmate, Marla Friedman Boren (C’78), and they are incredibly proud of their two sons. David (24) and Mike (18), grew up thinking it was absolutely normal for Dad to go to Siberia or Belarus for a week or two, as long as he made it back in time for the Cub Scout meeting. After all, Dad was the Den Leader, and that’s a really important job.\n\nLiz was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2007.\n\nThe theater has claimed Liz Timperman’s allegiance since childhood. She fell in love with Drew’s campus at first sight, but what really lured her to The Forest from Manhasset, New York, was Drew’s excellent Theatre Arts department.\n\nThe 80s and early 90s were an exciting time to be at Drew, where the arts gained from then-President Thomas H. Kean’s enthusiasm for the arts and his keen interest in the theater. Liz, who was the first recipient of the President’s Award in Theatre Arts, majored in theatre arts and political science and was active in the Drew University Dramatic Society (DUDS). She has wonderful memories of the late Joseph Patenaude’s inspired teaching and mentoring.\n\nIt was not long before Liz began to make a difference in the theater world in a series of award-winning companies. By 1995 she and two friends had founded Pure Orange Productions, a non-profit theater production company committed to staging new plays by emerging playwrights at affordable prices. A year later, Liz joined Danny DeVito’s Jersey Films to manage their New York office. In 1998 she produced a short film, Why Don’t You Dance, which was selected for the Hamptons Film Festival. After major production responsibilities with The New Group and the Signature Theater Company, she began a five-year stint as executive director of New York Stage and Film in 2002. There she managed all operations, from script selection to fundraising, marketing, and hiring all artistic, production, and administrative staff, to produce 12 to 20 new plays and musicals by emerging and established artists annually. She recently became executive director of Olympus Theatricals, where she looks forward to continuing her work as a theater producer.\n\nLiz has stayed in touch with Drew, serving first on a Theatre Arts panel and then, in 2004, speaking on performance theory and regional theatre differences as a Traphagen Distinguished Alumni Series speaker. She and her husband, attorney Benjamin Malin C’90, live in New York City with their one-year-old daughter, Sally Rose.\n\nDavid was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2006.\n\nWhen David Audretsch came to Drew from Poughkeepsie, New York, he hoped to be a physicist –until Professor Jerome Cranmer introduced him to economic thought. Thirty years after graduation, as an award-winning economist and prolific scholar, he is outspoken in thanking Drew for preparing him for an impressive career.\n\nAfter graduating magna cum laude, David went on to the University of Wisconsin. In 1980, after earning M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in economics, he joined the faculty of Middlebury College. In his career he has constantly handled multiple responsibilities involving teaching, research, publication, and consulting.\n\nWhile at Middlebury David became involved with the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin fuer Sozialforschung; David lived in Berlin for 12 years and served as acting director of the organization from 1989 to 1991. Since 1998 he has held Indiana University’s Ameritech Chair of Economic Development and directed Indiana’s Institute for Development Strategies, to which he has added the directorship of the Entrepreneurship, Growth and Public Policy Group of the Max Planck Institute of Economics (since 2003). He also teaches geography at Indiana, and is actively involved with three other organizations in Germany, London, and The Netherlands. In addition, he serves as consultant to the Science, Technology and Economic Policy Board of the National Research Council at the National Academy of Sciences and consultant at the World Bank. He has consulted with a wide range of corporations and government agencies at home and abroad. His most recent book, Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth, was just published in April 2006 by Oxford University Press. His list of publications is extensive.\n\nDavid takes great satisfaction in having introduced a new field in economics: the study of entrepreneurs. And he is quick to praise the liberal arts at Drew for equipping him to reason, to question, to make new connections, to think creatively in a way that has enabled him to develop new areas of economic thought and to be a positive force all around the globe. Most significant among his awards was the 2001 International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research, given by the Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research. But if you ask him his greatest professional satisfaction, he is quick to mention his selection as an outstanding teaching assistant when he was a graduate student. And as Traphagen Speaker at Drew in 2003, he brought his expertise back to The Forest.\n\nOther satisfactions include music, hiking, and, above all, his family. David and his wife, Joanne, live in Bloomington, Indiana with their three sons, Alex (15), James (11), and Christopher (7).\n\nKirk was honored with the Achievement in the Liberal Arts Award during Reunion 2003.\n\nKirk Igler’s life was marked by great integrity and great enthusiasm, and his death has been a loss to his family, his profession, and the Drew community.\n\nKirk, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, came to The Forest because Drew offered excellence without requiring mathematics. An allergy to numbers did not keep him from studying science, and Robert and Florence Zuck guided his botany major. He was also close to Julius Mastro and worked in Mastro’s shoe store during and after college. A brief return to science, as an entomologist for Penick Drugs in Orange, New Jersey, ended with a call from Ward Landrigan C’63.\n\nLandrigan lured him to Parke-Bernet Galleries (now Sotheby’s) to manage antique and classic car sales; Kirk then branched out, heading Sotheby’s European furniture and oriental rug departments after gaining experience in London. In 1974 he left Sotheby’s to become a retail dealer of English furniture and related decorative arts with Vernay & Jussell. The next year he went on to a partnership with Landrigan and John Stair, and ultimately worked on his own as Kirk A. Igler, Inc., specializing in fine and decorative arts, appraisals, and advising private clients on purchases. He continued his association with Sotheby’s as a consultant and senior appraiser. His knowledge, amazing memory, “good eye,” sense of style, delight in his work, and absolute integrity earned him the trust and respect of all.\n\nKirk and Roberta Acocella C’66 married in their junior year. They lived in New Providence and Mendham, New Jersey, for many years, and kept in touch with Drew friends through Jared McDavit C’64’s annual Bastille Day picnic. Kirk’s enthusiasm for his work was mirrored in his private life by a love of family, cars, motorcycles, his dogs, and golf. Golf was a passion; he played, practiced, and read golf, built golf clubs, and collected antique clubs. The Iglers moved to Vermont and semi-retirement in 2000 to be near family and to play golf in a quieter setting.\n\nKirk died on December 11, 2001, at the age of 57, in an automobile accident. He is survived by Roberta, their sons Keith and Matthew, and their granddaughter Anna, all of whom Kirk adored. A second grandchild, born after Kirk’s death, bears his name. We honor Kirk for his character and achievements and wish he could have been with us today.\n\nJames will be honored with the Achievement in the Arts Award during Reunion 2024.\n\nJames Fiorentino C’99 is the 2024 recipient of the Alumni Award for Achievement in the Arts. An internationally recognized watercolor artist, James majored in Studio Art at Drew and played starting shortstop for Drew’s baseball team all four years of his college career.\n\nHe has been recognized for his artwork from an early age. At 15, James became the youngest artist ever to be featured in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for his likeness of Reggie Jackson. In 1998, he became the youngest artist to be inducted into the prestigious New York Society of Illustrators, sharing the honor with such artists as Norman Rockwell and Andrew Wyeth.\n\nHe has painted many sports legends of the past as well as stars of today, including Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Cal Ripken Jr., Arnold Palmer, Muhammad Ali, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, and Tiger Woods. James has also painted and illustrated some of the world’s most recognized faces including presidents, Nobel Peace Prize winners, CEOs and political icons. His full body of work includes landscapes, portraits, seascapes, still lifes, and animals, and has been showcased in museums, galleries, and private collections across the globe. His portraits have also been featured on national consumer products, including trading cards for Topps, Upper Deck and Kelloggs.\n\nCurrently, James is a member of the New Jersey Watercolor Society, the Garden State Watercolor Society, American Watercolor Society, National Watercolor Society, Society of Animal Artists, and Artists for Conservation, as well as the Salmagundi Club of New York City. He also serves on the Board of Trustees for the Raptor Trust of NJ and D&R Greenway Land Trust.\n\nDrew was honored with the Achievement Award in the Arts at Reunion 2019.\n\nAfter graduating from Drew, Drew Martorella stage-managed for Paul and Ellen Barry at the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, now the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey.\n\nLike the previous award recipient, Dan Studney, he was lured out to Los Angeles and joined a house full of Drewids, yes, including Dan, to seek fame and a bit of fortune. Finding neither, he set to work as a freelance production assistant for commercials and the odd feature. He fetched Ellen DeGeneres’ coffee, wrangled a giraffe, opened a bottle of water for Andie McDowell, parked in Kevin Costner’s parking space (mistake), and drove a truck all…over…Los Angeles.\n\nAching to return to theatre, he called the production manager of the Mark Taper Forum about a stage-managing job. Finding none, he decided to call again. And again. And again. And about a dozen more times before landing a gig with Oscar-winning producer, Roy Conli who was producing for Peter Brosius, then the director of the Improvisational Theatre Project. This led to stage-managing Woman in Mind at the Tiffany Theatre in Los Angeles starring Helen Mirren.\n\nHe moved to Santa Fe in 1992 to stage-manage for the New Mexico Repertory Theatre where Martin Platt had been hired as the artistic director. He was then promoted to Producing Director and worked with one of his early mentors and former general manager of the Public Theatre, Bob MacDonald. He also served as the general manager and producer for the Institute for Spanish Arts’ national tour of Maria Benitez Teatro Flamenco.\n\nIn 1995 he moved to Colorado Springs and joined the University of Colorado–Colorado Springs as Producing Director and later Executive Director of Theatreworks. Here he worked with his dear friend and colleague, artistic director Murray Ross.\n\nIn 2013 the university honored him with the staff Thomas Jefferson Award. One of the university’s most distinguished service award, winners are those who embody and advance the ideals of Jefferson. The Jefferson Award recognizes CU faculty, staff and students who demonstrate excellence in the performance of regular responsibilities while contributing outstanding service to the broader community.\n\nIn 2015 he was promoted to Executive Director of UCCS Presents and was one of the key figures in helping lead the construction of the $60 million Ent Center for the Arts. This new arts center has changed the cultural landscape in the region. As Executive Director, Drew leads a unit that includes the University Center and Event Services, the Artist Series, Theatreworks and the Galleries of Contemporary Art.\n\nHe credits whatever modest success he’s had to his many friends from Drew who are still among the most important people in his life as well as faculty members Dan LaPenta, Gary Benson, Buzz McLaughlin, Janice Paran and John Knox. All have helped him develop, grow and be a little bit better. Now he’s married to his best friend Caitlin and father of the two best, most hilarious kids on the planet, Jack and Matt. He credits Drew University for setting him on the path on which he is still traveling and for teaching him that quality and values matter as well as instilling in him that the arts can and should be central to civic life.\n\nDevyani will be honored with the Achievement Award in Business during a virtual ceremony in June 2021.\n\nDevyani Gupta Morris is Principal of Cronheim Mortgage Corporation, the largest privately owned real estate investment banking firm in the Northeast. Her role as a producer has led to the placement of over $2 billion of commercial debt for all income-producing property types. She is also a managing member of the firm’s affiliated Channel Real Estate Funds, which secures leveraged investment capital for value-add real estate opportunities. Having joined the firm in 1996, as an entry-level analyst, Dev learned the commercial real estate investment business from the ground up. Within 3 years she quickly became a major contributor to the firm’s revenue and continues to play a key role in the firm’s leadership and development. Dev has also been integral to the firm’s growth as an asset manager for its institutional clients. Although most of her time is spent in new production, she spends considerable effort training and mentoring associates, most of whom are taking a similar career path in learning the industry from the ground up.\n\nDev holds a Master’s Degree in Real Estate Finance from New York University and graduated magna cum laude from Drew University, which she attended on a full academic scholarship, with a B.A. in Economics and French. Ms. Morris resides in Mendham, NJ with her husband, two children, and two dogs.\n\nChip was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2018.\n\nKnown by his friends as “Chip,” Lewis Andrews graduated from Drew in 1968 with a BA in political science and spent the next 40 years working with the state and federal government or trade associations. Chip’s last position was Associate Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. During his tenure, he successfully executed space realignment which in fiscal year 2006 saved more than $2.2 million, developed and completed the agency’s competitive sourcing plan (part of President George W. Bush’s management agenda), and transformed the agency’s executive secretariat into one of the federal government’s best.\n\nPrior to Chip’s appointment to the SBA, he served as President of Glass Packaging Institute, an international trade association representing manufacturers of glass containers, successfully leading the association through industry consolidations, globalization and downsizing of the industry. During his time at Glass Packaging, Chip improved efficiencies, saving over $500,000 annually by replacing bloated and costly committee structures with task force systems and outsourcing specific staff functions. Additionally, Chip created an effective grassroots lobbying system, repositioned glass package as environmentally friendly by building a national recycling network, and improved the glass packaging image as the national media spokesperson and through award winning public relations/advertising campaigns.\n\nEarlier in his career, Chip held increasingly important positions in state and federal government, including serving as Special Assistant to Rogers Morton (Secretary of the Interior under Presidents Nixon and Ford), as Deputy Commissioner, Department of Commerce, Connecticut Development Authority, and as a key advisor to Thomas Meskill during his campaigns and terms of office as a member of the U.S. House of Representative and Governor of Connecticut.\n\nChip was a member of Drew’s Board of Trustees for over twenty years, serving as Chair for five years. He and his wife, Christina, reside in Venice, Florida and Alexandria, Virginia. They have two children, four grandchildren, and a standard poodle.\n\nPaul was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2017.\n\nMany Drew graduates begin their careers the moment they walk off stage at Commencement, but Paul began his investment career even before that. As a senior, he secured an internship at Merrill Lynch, turning that into a position at a newly opened Merrill Lynch Futures office in Washington, D.C.\n\nA few years into his financial career, Paul moved from the futures market into more traditional banking and investment, and in 1993 he joined R. Seelaus & Co., where he continues to meet the financial planning and investment management needs of high–net worth individuals, business owners and corporations. Since 2013, he has served as the executive vice president of Granite Springs Asset Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of R. Seelaus, and has been recognized as a FIVE STAR Professional Wealth Manager for the past five years.\n\nPaul graduated from Drew in 1982 with a degree in economics. He remains active in the Drew community, particularly with the Center for Civic Engagement, serving both as an adviser and as a participant in its Civically Focused Alumni Networking program. He is also active in his community, as a former board trustee and current adviser for Furniture Assist and as a trustee for the Henry S. & Agnes M. Truzack Foundation. He met his wife of 31 years, Valerie (Russo) C’85, while on campus, and lives in Westfield, New Jersey, with his three children, Matt, Drew and Emma.\n\nChris was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2016.\n\nChristopher Smith didn’t go far from home to Drew, and he still lives a few miles from Madison, but his talent and his education are taking him around the world.\n\nChris chose Drew for its close community of students and faculty and its proximity to New York City. His freshman seminar with Professor Don Cole not only involved him in critical thinking but helped him to see economics as his chosen field. While at Drew, he also took advantage of many opportunities the College offers, including internships; served as advertising manager of the Acorn; and was a resident assistant for two years.\n\nDuring the next few years after graduation, Chris joined MetLife, then worked with several other firms while pursuing a graduate degree. He earned an MBA with honors, with a concentration in computer and information systems, at Rutgers Graduate School of Management in 1998, and he is also qualified as a chartered financial analyst. He returned to MetLife Investments in a variety of positions with increasing responsibilities, excelling in this leading insurance company which extends worldwide. He became vice president and chief of staff to the chief investment officer in 2006 and led the department’s communications during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nBy 2010, Chris was vice president and chief enterprise strategy officer. The next year, he became senior vice president and chief of staff to MetLife’s chairman, president and CEO, while also chairing the Board of MetLife Foundation. Since 2013, Chris has been executive vice president and head of global operations, founding this company division by uniting over 40 independent operating groups, leading over 14,000 associates, to transform MetLife’s operations into one unified global organization to be a powerful advocate for its customers while creating the capacity for the company’s growth.\n\nChris has been an increasingly involved Drew alumnus, and he has hosted Drew’s Wall Street Semester’s year-end reception at MetLife. Since 2014, he has been a member of the Board of Trustees, serving on several committees including Student Affairs, where he enjoys interacting with current students.\n\nSummit, New Jersey, is still home. He and his wife, Heidi, a nurse in St. Barnabas Hospital’s neonatal ICU, enjoy living in the small city where Chris grew up. Their son, Josh (21), is a senior majoring in graphic design at Boston University, while their daughter, Abby (18), will enter Lafayette University in the fall. Chris’s greatest interest is his family, and he enjoys his work with Drew.\n\nLeo was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2015.\n\nIt’s not every day that Drew is grateful for sports injuries, but that is what brought Leo Grohowski to the Forest. We’d hate to have missed him.\n\nWhen Leo graduated from New Jersey’s Livingston High School, he thought that Drew was just too close to home. But at Franklin and Marshall, he had athletic injuries severe enough to bring him home to recuperate. While he healed, he visited high school friends at Drew, and transferred during his sophomore year. Leo gained a solid education that determined his career, and became a two-year baseball co-captain and MVP in his senior year. Drew gained a committed alumnus.\n\nLeo’s interest in economics preceded his arrival at Drew, but he says that Vivian Bull kickstarted his career, inspiring him in the classroom and finding internships that helped him to relate his studies to real life. Following his magna cum laude graduation at Drew, Leo earned his MBA at New York University’s Stern School of Business in 1985. He began his career at the Princeton Bank and Trust, then moved to the Marine Midland Bank (which soon became HSBC), where he became chief investment officer in 1993. In 1996 he joined Bankers Trust as senior trust investment officer of the Private Bank and head of the U.S. Investment Strategy group. He served as CIO at Deutsche Bank and U.S. Trust Company. By 2007, he was at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, where he is currently executive vice president and CIO, overseeing $200 billion in assets while serving on the Operating Committee, the Benefits Investment Committee, and Compliance, Ethics and Conflicts.\n\nDespite his significant career responsibilities, Leo has been very active at Drew and in his community—so active that he received Drew’s Volunteer Award in 1994. He served on Drew’s Board of Trustees for 12 years and chaired the Investment Committee; has lectured in Drew’s Wall Street Semester, has been active with admissions and is a frequent attendee at Drew functions. His strong support includes the Grohowski Family Scholarship for economics majors, The Fund (which allows economics majors to experience real investment decisions), the Ehinger Center, the Thomas H. Kean Visiting Professorship of History and Political Science and Drew’s baseball facilities.\n\nIn addition to his Drew activities, Leo was a trustee at the Far Hills Country Day School for six years, was involved in coaching his children’s sports and is currently on the Investment Committee at Blair Academy. He is grateful that he has been able to maintain balance and perspective, enjoying family, friends, volunteer work and a demanding career.\n\nLeo and Nancy, who met at Marine Midland Bank, live in Far Hills, New Jersey, with their three sons: 18-year-old twins Andrew and Matthew, who are seniors at Morristown-Beard School, and Evan, 15, now at Blair Academy.\n\nPaul was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2014.\n\nThe chance to play baseball in a liberal arts college brought Paul Cunningham to Drew. Who would have guessed that years later he would start a new career making unique balls?\n\nPaul grew up in Cooperstown, N.Y., home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, so you might say that baseball was in his blood. He played baseball for three years at Drew, and his summer break job at the Hall of Fame’s library related well to his American studies major.\n\nAfter graduation, Paul worked as a photo researcher with FPG International, in the days when stock photography was in great demand. His experience in photography and baseball allowed him to move to Major League Baseball Properties in 1995, as a photo editor.\n\nBy 2006, Paul was yearning to make something tangible; he enjoyed working with his hands, having worked for many years with leather as a hobby. He began to make baseballs, “Lemon Balls,” named for the lemon-shaped cross-stitched balls used in the 19th century, and they sold well. But could he base an entire business on a unique baseball?\n\nHe started to think hard about the NFL’s official football. It was too large and too firm for Paul to enjoy throwing. What would happen if he made a new football? So he designed a ball that was smaller and easier to grip, using soft leather that was a joy to work with and to handle in play. It was an immediate success. By 2011, Paul’s Leather Head Sports company came to the attention of the Wall Street Journal, which featured it just before Christmas; so many orders came in that Paul was unable to fill them all in time for Christmas.\n\nHow many of us would have voluntarily left a steady job in 2008, when Paul did, to become an independent craftsman and create a unique business? Lehman Brothers vanished, real estate foundered, Wall Street was crumbling. But Leather Head Sports meshed with a renewed craft movement and a worldwide appreciation for sports. Paul provides unique products—some with exotic leathers—and continues to expand his line, which now includes basketballs, medicine balls, rugby balls and baseball gloves. He sees his products as boutique items, not just sports equipment, and his public appreciates them (President Obama has approved their sale in the White House gift shop). He now has five employees and several part-timers. He is delighted that he can create jobs, and that he and his staff can take pride in their work.\n\nPaul and Michelle Cunningham, and their daughters Grace, 15, and Lucy, 11, live in Glen Rock, N.J. The demands of Leather Head Sports keep Paul busy, but he has volunteered in local baseball, while Michelle works at Bayer Corporation and coaches their girls’ softball teams.\n\nSusan was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2013.\n\nWhen Susan Crowley arrived on campus from New Lenox, Illinois, Drew saw a brilliant student with a very promising future. Her achievements so far prove the wisdom of those early assessments.\n\nSusan, a Drew Scholar, was already interested in international affairs in high school, and her interest inspired her to major in political science and Russian area studies. An enthusiastic student of Douglas Simon’s courses, she participated in the United Nations Semester and studied in Moscow with a Dickinson College summer program. By the time she graduated summa cum laude, she had been elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to honor societies in both her majors, and had been active in The Forest, especially in the Gibbons Pre-Law Society, the Russian Studies club, events on campus, and intramurals as captain of Women’s Ultimate Frisbee.\n\nFrom Drew, Susan went to Georgetown University Law Center, where she earned a J.D. cum laude in 1996. Her next step was the law firm Foley & Lardner LLP, where she was an associate in the Washington D.C. office, and became senior counsel in 2003 and partner two years later. In February 2007, Susan joined the law firm of Bryan Cave LLP and was elected partner in January 2011. At Bryan Cave, Susan specializes in international trade.\n\nFor her clients, Susan interprets the legal complexities of international trade laws and regulations and the means of complying with them. Her work includes matters concerning International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Export Administration Regulations, trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. anti-boycott laws, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. She designs and implements compliance programs, holds training sessions, designs and leads internal audits and reviews to ensure compliance, and conducts due diligence reviews related to export controls, trade sanctions, and anti-corruption matters. She represents clients in civil and criminal enforcement proceedings. She is a frequent speaker on compliance issues, and she has published articles in her field.\n\nMost of Susan’s volunteer activities are centered on professional organizations. Among others, she has been active in the International Law Section of the District of Columbia Bar Association, where she has chaired the Steering Committee; the International Practice Section of the Virginia Bar Association, where she is a member of the Board of Governors; and the Women’s Bar Association of the District of Columbia. She has been a board member and treasurer of the Women’s Bar Association Foundation.\n\nSusan is married to Scott Kovarovics, who works in conservation and outdoor recreation as executive director of the Izaak Walton League of America. They live in Arlington, Virginia, with their children, Ryan (12) and Kara (10). Outside of the office, Susan enjoys cooking, baking, hiking, and keeping up with her family.\n\nGale was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2012.\n\nDrew gave Gale Eisner everything she wanted in a college. It was close – but not too close – to her home in Roslyn, Long Island, and convenient to New York City. Above all, Drew offered the opportunity to learn from dedicated, accessible professors who could provide genuine mentorship. She emerged from Drew with majors in political science and psychology, an exciting London Semester experience, memories of tennis as team captain, and lifelong friends.\n\nGale’s family’s work on Wall Street caught her interest, and she began her career in investment banking with Gruntal & Co. shortly after graduation. In the early 1980s women did not find it easy to advance in the field; Gale found that a female “sales assistant” was basically a secretary. It was not until her third position, at McKinley Allsop Inc., that she found a company that would sponsor her license, allowing her to be a full sales person. There she was able to demonstrate her abilities, creating a significant amount of new business as vice president of institutional sales in the southeastern territory.\n\nWith an M.B.A. in Marketing and Finance from the Fordham Graduate School of Business (1988), Gale moved to increasingly responsible positions in alternative investments. Her career has included 14 years with Citigroup, where she was director of sales for all Citi Wealth Management financial advisors, institutional consultants and family office advisors in New York and New England from 2002 to 2009. She is currently co-head of alternative investments at Corinthian Partners LLC, where she specializes in hedge funds in a firm that stresses individualized service. She is a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst and is a member of 100 Women in Hedge Funds.\n\nA demanding career has not prevented Gale from pursuing additional interests. She has volunteered with cancer services at City of Hope and young people’s welfare at Inwood House, fed the homeless at Yorkville Pantry, and facilitated charity events in her synagogue. At Drew, she has been a 1982 Class Host, is on the 2012 Reunion Committee, and has been active in fundraising, serving on the Gift Committee in 2007.\n\nAsked the greatest satisfaction in her life, Gale says, “My children, of course!” She and her husband, Robert Blum, who owns and operates a medical sales and marketing company, live in New York City with their two sons. Andrew (14) and Evan (5) are enrolled in the brand-new Avenues: The World School that stresses international learning and prepares its students for globalization.\n\nSo far as her career goes, Gale is proud to be a woman who has achieved recognition in a largely male-dominated field. She is even more proud that she has accomplished all her efforts with integrity, and that she is able to educate her clients: “My most memorable moments are when I can teach people the information that I have learned and see it have a positive impact on their lives.”\n\nSanjay was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2011.\n\nSanjay Mirchandani, who studied math and computer science at Drew University, started his career developing new technology—but he quickly realized that wasn’t exactly where he wanted to be. “I found I got more satisfaction in helping customers use technology than I did from creating it,” he says. Armed with graduate degrees in both business and engineering, he headed off down a new path.\n\n“The best opportunities in life are not always defined. Go with it and see where it takes you,” says Mirchandani. He went with it—and today he is the chief information officer and chief operating officer with the Global Centers of Excellence of EMC Corporation, the world’s leading developer and provider of information infrastructure and technology.\n\nMirchandani thinks understanding how the customer interacts with technology is key. That’s why he launched the EMC IT Proven program to chronicle the company’s experiences testing, deploying and managing EMC’s industry-leading technologies.\n\nBefore EMC, Mirchandani spent 11 years with Microsoft, working throughout Asia and holding multiple management positions, including president, Asia Pacific Region; president, South Asia; and managing director, India.\n\nWhen Mirchandani came to the States from his home in India to attend Drew University, it was his first overseas experience. “I immediately felt like I belonged,” he says, “There were only a handful of us from other countries, and the school really embraced us. I felt like I had a new home.” He felt that Drew brought out the very best in him—and that’s what he’s encouraging his teenagers daughters to think about as they choose which colleges to attend.\n\nThat positive experience of being brought together at Drew left a lasting impact on him. In his career, Mirchandani takes great pride in his ability to build teams. “I’ve always had a global role,” he remarks. “Being able to bring really diverse people from all over the globe together as a team and really accomplish things has been the most fulfilling part of my career.”\n\nMirchandani says his Drew education has been paramount to his success, and it has encouraged him to never stop learning. A self-proclaimed “technology geek,” he loves experimenting with new “toys,” and he’s passionate about the impact technology can make. “If something makes you more productive, I’m interested in it,” he says. In an effort to keep up with the day-to-day changes in the IT world, he challenges himself to write new computer programs from time to time—using new programming languages and building new skills.\n\nWith an already successful technology career under his belt, Mirchandani won’t speculate what his future holds. But he does know that it’s all about learning. “With everything I do,” he says, “I ask myself, ‘What can I learn from this?’ It’s all about gaining competencies and experiences.”\n\nMirchandani lives in Massachusetts and has two teenage daughters, Pooja and Simran. He also likes reading and sports—cricket and soccer—and hopes to learn to play golf.\n\nD\n\nAnthony was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2008.\n\nIn the course of creating exceptional living environments for his clients, Anthony Ingrao has created a considerable reputation for talent and imagination. His interest in the decorative arts has provided him with an absorbing career on two continents.\n\nTony came to Drew from Bronxville, New York, majored in economics, and took advantage of Drew’s opportunities for European study by participating in the London and Brussels semesters. A winter session course in water color revealed his gift for the arts and made a major change in his career direction. Following his instructor’s recommendation, Tony pursued graduate studies, with a concentration in architecture, at the Rhode Island School of Design. He set up his own studio upon graduation, and then headed to Paris. There he started a branch of his design business and educated himself in what would be a lifelong quest for fine European antiques. Twelve years of work in France, restoring a variety of grand houses and chateaux and deciphering the intricacies of European design, shaped his design philosophy. His favorite project there was the restoration and decoration of an 11th-century monastery in the Luberon Valley.\n\nIn the 90s, Tony returned to the Upper East Side of New York. He established his business, which provides unique architectural and design services to a select group of private clients. From there he has built and decorated many great estates in California, Connecticut, Florida, Long Island, Maine, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. He has completed architecture and interiors for clients including Howard Stern, actresses Goldie Hawn and Kim Cattrall, producer Marty Richards, and businesspersons Jack and Suzy Welch, Richard Rainwater and Darla Moore, Steven and Alex Cohen, and Dan and Jane Och, as well as the chairman of The Related Group, and Steve and Kara Ross. Tony’s work is frequently featured in art and design periodicals.\n\nA designer who is equally adept with homes, commercial sites, and landscapes and gardens, Tony works in a variety of styles, from traditional French, English, and American to contemporary and modern. He is known for intriguing and often playful designs, and is never afraid to combine seemingly disparate elements to achieve a result that combines the client’s taste with his own intuitions and expertise. His designs blend a fresh, contemporary approach with old-world classicism, and he succeeds in uniting the timeless with the practical in an integrated environment.\n\nThe opening of the Ingrao Antiques & Fine Arts gallery on Manhattan’s East 64th Street was one of the Manhattan design world’s major events of 2003. In the gallery, Tony has brought new drama to the antiques field by displaying fine art and antiques in a stark, minimalist setting, a move which the art world has found both startling and refreshing. His expressed aim is “to present important works of art in a non-museum setting, and to open a fresh dialogue between art and objects with architecture.”\n\nJoseph was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2007.\n\nJoe Beneducci has achieved major success in the insurance business, but his greatest priority is the same as his greatest pride—his family.\n\nAfter growing up in Staten Island and attending North Hunterdon Regional High School in Annandale, New Jersey, Joe was being recruited for soccer by Division I schools. He just happened to stop by Drew, and it was a natural: strong academics, a beautiful campus, and a good soccer program. Joe majored in political science, minored in business management, and played soccer and basketball. Seeking business experience, he applied for an internship with Chubb and Son, Inc., then stayed on in commercial underwriting and marketing for eight years after graduation.\n\nIn 1998, Joe began a nine-year association with the Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company in California. Beginning as senior vice president, he became executive vice president in 2002 (with a title change to president in 2006), serving also as chief administrative officer and then as chief operating officer. By 2004 he was responsible for the strategic direction, business strategies, and most operations of all the company’s business units (personal, commercial, and specialty insurance), with a total of $6 billion in premiums written and over one million customers nationwide. By 2007 he was president and chief executive officer, responsible for all aspects of the company’s performance and success. His efforts to modernize the insurance industry have included testimony before the United States Senate.\n\nWorking with the Fireman’s Fund was a special opportunity for Joe, the son of a New York City firefighter. It also gave him a unique way to put his strong feelings about corporate philanthropy into practice—the Fireman’s Fund had been known in the past for its social mission to disabled firefighters and their families. Today’s firefighters’ families are better provided for, but the firefighter’s greatest need now is professional support. Joe is proud that he revived the Fireman’s Fund’s commitment to philanthropy and oversaw donations of more than $12 million to local fire departments for equipment, tools, and training.\n\nAs the next step in his career, Joe hopes to fulfill his dream of founding his own company. In the meantime he is, and always has been, adamant about putting family first. He and his wife, Bonnie (Ethridge) C’88, live in Santa Rosa, California, with their children, Joseph (11), Jason (10), Jared (8), and Jessica (6). The whole family enjoys a variety of sports, especially skiing from their second home in Lake Tahoe.\n\nThomas was honored with the Achievement in Business Award during Reunion 2006.\n\nTom Collamore began his career in public service. In the corporate world, he still concentrates on serving the public good.\n\nA native of Bloomfield, Connecticut, Tom was hooked on political science early in life. As a student of Julius Mastro, Douglas Simon, David Cowell, and Perry Leavell, he pursued his love of American history and his political science major, and was active in political campaigns. He worked in the George H. W. Bush campaign in 1979 and arranged for Bush’s visit to Drew in 1980. After completing his degree magna cum laude—also with four years of baseball—he was invited to join the new Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldridge, in Washington, D.C. In 1985, after four years as Baldridge’s special assistant, Tom received the Commerce Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Achievement. He then served in the White House on Vice President Bush’s senior staff for four years. He traveled extensively with the Vice President and was senior traveling aide during the campaign that led to Mr. Bush’s election as President in 1988. In the George H. W. Bush administration, he served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Administration and later as Chief of Staff and Assistant Secretary of Commerce.\n\nThe 1992 national election results marked the time for Tom to join the private sector, and he has made a graceful transition from success in public service to success in business. In 1992 he joined Philip Morris Companies Inc.—now Altria Group Inc.—as Vice President for Corporate Affairs Policy and Administration, and became Vice President for Corporate Public Affairs three years later. At Altria he is responsible for the strategy, direction, and management of the company’s public policy, public affairs, charitable and political giving programs, and outreach. He develops and manages efforts that exemplify Altria’s commitment to corporate responsibility, including programs on hunger and domestic violence, support of the arts, and promotion of employee volunteerism. He finds the ability to steward Altria’s philanthropy exciting, and is enthusiastic about applying his public service experience in a different sphere.\n\nTom’s commitment to public affairs does not end when he leaves Altria’s doors. He is a former Drew trustee and currently serves on Drew’s Board of Visitors, and has also been active in the College Alumni/ae Association and in admissions support. He serves on the boards of organizations involved in hunger, health, the arts, and domestic violence in several states and is on the advisory board of the George Bush Presidential Library in College, Station, Texas. He and his wife, Jacqueline, live in Chevy Chase, Maryland with their four children, Thomas Jr. (11), Pauline (10), Sally Ann (9), and Katherine (6).\n\nKen will be honored with the Achievement in the Sciences Award during Reunion 2024.\n\nDr. Kenneth Vega C’84 is the 2024 recipient of the Alumni Award for Achievement in the Sciences. Born and raised in The Bronx, Ken graduated from Drew with a major in Zoology and obtained his MD degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1988. Upon graduation, he completed an internship/residency in Internal Medicine at the Boston City Hospital in 1991 and fellowship training in Gastroenterology at Temple University in 1995. In 2022, Ken received a Master of Health Administration degree from the University of North Florida\n\nPresently, he is Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Augusta University–Medical College of Georgia, where he has been on the faculty since 2018\n\nKen has been on the Gastroenterology faculty at the Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School, the University of New Mexico, the University of Florida–Jacksonville, the University of Oklahoma, and National Jewish Health.\n\nIn 2013, he retired from the US Army National Guard with the rank of Colonel, following three overseas deployments providing medical support for Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.\n\nKen’s research focuses on gastrointestinal reflux disease, Barrett’s esophagus in groups other than non-Hispanic whites, esophageal stem cells, and epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancers along with ethnic/gender disparities in gastrointestinal diseases, treatment, and outcome. He is the author of more than 80 original articles, reviews, and book chapters and has presented original research at local, regional, national, and international scientific meetings.\n\nKathleen was honored with the Achievement in the Sciences Award during a virtual ceremony in June 2021.\n\nLooking back, Kathleen’s two influential professors at Drew were Dr. Joy Phillips for Anatomy and Embryology, and Dr. Harold Rohrs for Physiology. Can you tell she was a Zoology major? She recalls when students came to embryology class, Dr. Phillips required them to have colored pencils to mark the three cell layers – she taught them how a fertilized egg becomes a chicken by drawing the movements of the cell layers with the yellow, blue, and red colors, which they copied with their pencils. They visually learned how the numerous migrations of cells and their interactions all precisely occurred within 21 days to create a perfect hatchling. Quite an amazing story.\n\nAfter some years of working at startup company in Massachusetts on a project developing an optical cell sorter instrument, Kathy learned that a PhD was necessary if one wanted to be in the lead and win grants. She funded her PhD studies in Cell Biology at Tufts Medical School by instructing medical students in the Anatomy Lab. Actually, Dr. Phillip’s class came in handy, because if you can recall some embryology, less memorization is needed; it’s all connected. She earned her PhD with research in cellular biology, studying cells in the immune system. To get a PhD in Science, it’s not a matter of taking more courses. Instead, you must discover something nobody else has ever known before! And that’s what makes the science so interesting.\n\nAfterwards, Kathy did go back to working at another R & D company but was beginning to get interested in teaching. At that time, the Harvard Graduate School of Education had a program designed for retooling scientists into science teachers, so she attended while working part-time. Now with a master’s in science education at the age of 40, she decided that 6th grade was the most important grade to teach, not high school. Why? Because 6th grade is the first year that kids experience “science” as course. It’s typically the time a student decides whether or not they “like” science. So, 16 years later, working at a public school where educational innovation was supported, Kathy was very glad she did make the move to teaching. It was extremely rewarding. She also received a lifetime achievement award by being Inducted into the Massachusetts Science Educators Hall of Fame by the Massachusetts Association of Science Teachers (MAST) November, 2011.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, teaching sixth grade science helped qualify her for her next career, working at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Here, being able to explain complex scientific information in an understandable way was a requirement for the position of Community Engagement Core Director for the Center for Environmental Health Sciences (CEHS). This Center is a collection of researchers studying how the environment affects human health. For example, some chemicals from the environment can get stuck on a cell’s DNA, damaging the DNA. To help explain these concepts, she created tactile educational models to show both what molecules look like and how these molecules function. The audience for these patented, hands-on models include secondary school and collegiate classes (https://edgerton.mit.edu/DNA-proteins-sets). For middle school and for informal science learning, she also has created a way to model the chemistry of climate change (https://edgerton.mit.edu/molecule-set), a change that will profoundly impact human health.\n\nKathy wishes to thank her husband J. Kim Vandiver and children Amy, Ben, and Alex for their support, as they have contributed greatly to these accomplishments, and Drew University for an excellent academic start in the field of Biology.\n\nKathleen Finley also received a 4 year Rose Memorial Scholarship and would like to thank Drew University for this support.\n\nBryon was honored with the Achievement Award in the Sciences during a virtual ceremony in June 2020.\n\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, epidemiology has become a national fascination. But in 1989, discussion of epidemiology was rare. Bryon Backenson, a junior biology major, spent spring break visiting graduate ecology programs at several universities, but Professor Linda Van Blerkom’s spring semester medical anthropology class introduced Bryon to epidemiology–and he was hooked.\n\nHe attended the School of Public Health at the University at Albany because of its partnership with the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) which provided internships and experience in the practical (as opposed to academic) side of public health.\n\nWorking on tracking the spread of Lyme disease in ticks and wildlife for NYSDOH, he experienced vector-borne diseases and moved on to working on basic pathology of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, discovering an emerging relapsing fever pathogen in Spain, developing novel statewide surveillance systems to collect and test ticks for several pathogens and streamline the reporting of human cases of Lyme disease.\n\nHe authored the national Lyme disease surveillance case definition and sits on several panels that advise the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on issues regarding tick and mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nIn 2009, coinciding with the discovery of H1N1 pandemic influenza in New York, his role at NYSDOH expanded to cover investigation of all communicable diseases and their outbreaks in the state. He coordinated efforts to respond to H1N1, Ebola, Zika, vaping illnesses and novel coronavirus.\n\nThe part of epidemiology and public health he enjoys most is communication—the teaching and translating of data and principles. He often speaks with the media and gives numerous seminars.\n\nBackenson has been an assistant professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Albany since 2005, teaching Infectious Disease Epidemiology. He lives in Clifton Park, NY with his wife, and his fantasy baseball league that started with classmates at Drew in 1988 is still going strong in its 34th year!\n\nSteve was honored with the Achievement Award in the Sciences at Reunion 2019.\n\nStephen Casey is a professor of mathematics and affiliate professor of computer science at American University (AU). He also currently serves as the chairman of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Steve graduated from Drew University in 1979 with a major in mathematics. He also studied physics, philosophy and classical studies at Drew.\n\nAfter college, Steve taught physics for a year at the Delbarton School in Mendham, NJ and then decided to attend the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, based on the advice of his advisor at Drew, the late Dr. Norma Gilbert.\n\nSteve pursued his doctorate under the guidance of David Hamilton. His doctoral thesis, The boundary of the universal Teichm ̈uller space and the Bers space of Schwarzians, developed mathematics that is used in string and superstring theory. He received tenure-track job offers from 12 schools, and chose American University in Washington, D.C.\n\nSteve’s research focuses on complex analysis, harmonic analysis and number theory with applications to signal and image processing. He is a founding member of the Editorial Board for Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing and an associate editor of The Journal of Signal and Image Processing. He was also unanimously selected by the SampTA Steering Committee to be the chair of SampTA 2015, the 11th biennial international conference on Sampling Theory and its Applications, and was named guest editor-in-chief of Sampling Theory in Signal and Image Processing from 2015-2017.

Larry graduated from Drew as an Applied Mathematics major in 1983 with the late Dr. Alan Candiotti as his first academic advisor. He stayed an additional year at Drew taking all the physics courses required for graduate school with Dr. Bob Fenstermacher C’63, his second academic advisor. After Drew, Larry was accepted into and attended The Pennsylvania State University Department of Physics Ph.D. Program, but after 5 consecutive years of undergraduate studies and then 2.5 years of graduate work, he decided to hit the “off ramp”, completing instead the Master’s Degree with Thesis Option in 1986. Larry is a Chartered Engineer in the United Kingdom (closest to a PE or Professional Engineer in the U.S.) and a Member of the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing.\n\nAfter Penn State, Larry returned to Delbarton, becoming the Chair of the Science Department after only one formal year of teaching and at the ripe old age of 26. While he loved teaching, his real passion was for hands-on lab work, research and experimental development, so after 4 years at Delbarton and with deep emotional attachment to his alma mater, he painfully departed Delbarton when the US Army came calling and entered US Government service in 1991. Larry’s first assignment was as a Health Physicist protecting on-post radiation workers from harm. After having mastered this in about 5 years, an opportunity arose to work alongside Dr. Paul Willson, a renowned and respected physicist at Picatinny Arsenal doing development of x-ray based technology, sources and detectors to better serve our war fighters who put themselves in harm’s way every day.\n\nIn 2006, when troop strength in Iraq and Afghanistan was over 100,000 and still growing, the lab was approached to determine the feasibility of creating a capability that at that time did not yet exist–an inspection system to test the ballistic integrity of the ceramic body armor insert plates that were issued to our soldiers. What would under any other circumstances be a 5-10 year project from conception to deployment was completed within 18 months, at which time the first prototype Armor Inspection System (AIS) was deployed into Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait in 2008. Following great success, some 15 additional units were purchased by the US Marine Corps, US Navy and US Air Force and were deployed the world over by 2011 with units in South Korea, Japan, Germany and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThis particular program was a project of a lifetime–a career capstone–to be able to have an unlimited budget, personnel, access to technology and deep sense of commitment from all involved because of the very nature of the goal here: to ensure that if or when our troops are fired upon in battle they would be assured that their body armor would not fail them. This program and these systems are now in sustainment mode with no further R&D required, but there is, and always will be, a new program. Currently, that program is the detection and identification of roadside bombs, better known as IEDs (improvised explosive devises). With a new application of an old method, Larry is very much involved in the new challenge. When the history books are finally written on the war on terror, we will look back and realize that the greatest single threat to the United States’ security is the current inability to detect energetic materials when they are well hidden, but the new program means there will be an end to that threat once and for all.\n\nRhonda was honored with the Achievement in the Sciences Award during Reunion 2016.\n\nAfter growing up in a peripatetic Navy family, Rhonda Rush wanted stability, and she looked for a school where she could pursue her educational goals. She says her choice of Drew was “random,” but there were two reasons that informed her choice: Drew was a place where she could stay for all four years, and its community would see her as a scholar as well as a woman.\n\nRhonda greatly enjoyed her chemistry major and received the freshman chemistry award. She was also active in student governance – as president of Hoyt-Bowne, she made many visits to the legendary Vice President John Pepin, when she requested improvements in the dorm. As a member of a military family, she was uncomfortable with the campus unrest in 1970.\n\nFrom Drew, Rhonda gained a fellowship at Iowa State University, where she earned the Ph.D. in chemistry in 1975. A semester at Argonne National Laboratories encouraged her interest in industrial chemistry. She began her career as a researcher at Proctor and Gamble, moved on to Perkin-Elmer as an engineer, and then spent the rest of her career at S&C Electric Company, first as an analytical chemist and finally as a senior materials scientist. In mid-career, she also earned an MBA at Northwestern University. She says that not only did Drew prepare her for graduate study, but gave her a “window on knowledge” that has always helped her relate to non-scientific activities.\n\nRhonda’s work was chiefly in plastic engineering, a challenging field, and she is an expert in the analysis of plastics, rubbers and greases. She published numerous articles in her field, and twice received a membership award in the Society of Plastic Engineering. She has been active in several professional societies.\n\nWorking in a strongly male-dominated field was always a challenge, and Rhonda is keenly interested in assisting young women scientists. As a member of Drew’s New Founders Society, she has created the Women in Chemistry and Physics Scholarship, for women preparing for a non-medical career in industrial science. She has also created the Chemistry Scholarship for Women at Iowa State; the scholarship’s first award was made in 2015.\n\nRhonda’s retirement in 2011 has brought her some special joys. She and retired elementary school teacher Rosemary Casey were married in 2012, and they immensely enjoy their house and garden in Chicago, Illinois. Rhonda volunteers in the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and, as Flotilla Commander, she is very busy in recreational boater safety in the Chicago/Lake Michigan area.\n\nKathryn was honored with the Achievement in the Sciences Award during Reunion 2015.\n\nKathy Cottingham’s parents never told her that they wanted their daughter to attend Drew. Thanks to the Governor’s School in the Sciences, they didn’t need to.\n\nKathy arrived from Medford Lakes, New Jersey, in July 1985 for the Governor’s School, which has now brought talented New Jersey high school students to Drew each summer for 30 years. For Kathy, the experience set her life on a different trajectory. Once admitted as a Drew Scholar, she plunged into academics and athletics, and assisted with the Governor’s School in the summers as a student counselor. She majored in biology and mathematics—she says she enjoys biology’s “messiness,” meaning that there are no definite answers, always leaving something more to learn, while math is “clean,” appealing to her appreciation of order. Kathy earned a prestigious Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude; she also received numerous awards as a scholar-athlete in both lacrosse and field hockey. She was elected to Drew’s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nKathy is grateful to Drew’s science faculty, and is particularly thankful for Lee Pollock’s guidance that took her to the University of Wisconsin at Madison for graduate school in zoology. At Wisconsin, Kathy earned her MS in 1993 and PhD in 1996, and went on to the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis for two years of postdoctoral work. In 1998 Kathy was appointed assistant professor at Dartmouth College, where she has been co-chair of the graduate program in ecology and evolutionary biology since 2009 and professor of biological sciences since 2011. She is enthusiastic about her students in Dartmouth’s undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nKathy has received many fellowships and research grants. Her list of publications and presentations is impressive, as is her record of service to professional organizations. Her awards include Dartmouth’s Graduate Faculty Mentor Award in 2013. Her scholarly interests are diverse, centering on ecology and limnology (the study of freshwater lakes) but also include projects in environmental microbiology, epidemiology and public environmental health. One of her public health interests is the occurrence of arsenic in nature, and in rice consumption in particular, with consequent effects in utero, in breast milk and in infant foods; a publication she co-led in this area was named the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences’ “2011 Paper of the Year.” She enjoys doing research that can directly affect people’s lives.\n\nKathy and her husband, Bob Mosdal, enjoy living in Hanover, New Hampshire. Bob, a professional librarian, currently concentrates on home and family, including their two sons, Thomas, 10, and Martin, 7. They all enjoy the local hiking trails. In her limited spare time, Kathy coaches and cheers for the boys’ soccer teams, and is active in the Lake Sunapee Protective Association.\n\nCarrie was honored with the Achievement in the Sciences Award during Reunion 2014.\n\nAs a senior at Drew, Carrie Hendrickson chaired the Student Government Association’s Food Service Committee. Now she is a Consumer Safety Officer in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, making sure that our food is safe. Could there be a connection?\n\nCarrie came to Drew from Aliquippa, Pa., but she lived “all over” in her childhood while her family moved six times with the Air Force. She found Drew when visiting a friend on campus. Drew gained an excellent student: a Drew Scholar who was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude, with a major in biology and a minor in biochemistry. Carrie appreciated Drew’s science faculty and the opportunities for research, especially in RISE, and her involvement in two Governor’s School summers. She says that Drew always provided her with a “learning summer.”\n\nAfter Drew, graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania occupied Carrie until she earned her PhD in cell and molecular biology in 2002. After Penn, she interned with several federal organizations during her tenure in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ two-year Emerging Leaders program. Upon graduation from the program, she began her current position.\n\nCarrie’s role as a regulatory scientist is to ensure that new food ingredients, especially foods from bioengineered crops and those “generally recognized as safe” (or GRAS), are not only safe but meet regulatory standards.
