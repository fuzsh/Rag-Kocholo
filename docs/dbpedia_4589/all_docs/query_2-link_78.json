        "text": "Passed away on March 5, 2019\n\nJudy Louise Bolton (1962-2019) received both her B.Sc. in Chemistry (1984) and her Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry (1988) from University of Toronto. She trained in the areas of drug metabolism and chemical toxicology at the University of Colorado, first as a Postdoctoral Fellow (1988-1990) and then as a Research Assistant Professor (1990-1992). She joined the Department of Chemistry at Queen's University at the rank of Assistant Professor (1992-1994) and was subsequently recruited to the University of Illinois Chicago as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy (1994). She was quickly promoted to Associate (1998) and then Full (2002) Professor. Just three years later, Judy was offered the responsibility of Department Head, a post that she held up until her death. Dr. Bolton was a preeminent medicinal chemist whose focused research program has made a decided impact on postmenopausal women’s health. Judy first gained international recognition for her discovery that Premarin® and other estrogen replacement drugs are metabolized to reactive catechols/quinones/quinone methides with the potential to damage DNA and proteins, thereby increasing cancer risk in women. Her laboratory showcased these findings in a series of papers published in Journal of the American Chemical Society, Carcinogenesis, and Chemical Research in Toxicology. Subsequently, her team showed that selective estrogen receptor modulators are converted to quinones and quinone methides, which could explain the cytotoxic side effects of these important women’s health pharmaceuticals. Detailed investigations into the mechanisms of action of estrogen and antiestrogen metabolism and carcinogenesis define a large portion of Dr. Bolton’s body of work. In 1999, before the release of the findings of the Women’s Health Initiative – a watershed study that demonstrated an increased risk of developing hormone-dependent cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke among women on hormone replacement therapy – Dr. Bolton and her colleagues were awarded funding to establish the UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research for Women’s Health (2000-2022). The Center investigated whether and how dietary supplements with claims of hot flash relief for postmenopausal women have any efficacy, toxicity, or chemopreventive benefits. The group published extensively on the chemical and biological mechanisms of phytoestrogens and chemopreventive compounds in the top supplements consumed by women. This multidisciplinary team also established a paradigm for the chemical and biological standardization of botanical extracts that has been adopted by the National Institutes of Health and is now incorporated into the review process for NIH-funded projects. During her prolific career, Dr. Bolton authored over ten book chapters and 150 peer-reviewed publications, and her extensive authorship has garnered over 12,600 citations. She was appointed to the editorial advisory boards of Chemical Research in Toxicology, Toxicology Letters, and Drug Metabolism and Disposition, serving as an associate editor for Chemical Research in Toxicology for 18 years. She was a permanent member of the NIH Chemical Pathology Study Section and served a term as Chair of the Cancer Etiology Study Section. Her service on national committees included those of the American Chemical Society, Society of Toxicology, and American Association for Cancer Research. She was appointed a Fellow of the American Chemical Society (2011) and received the Founders Award of the ACS Division of Chemical Toxicology (2018). After a career of service to academia and the broader scientific community, Judy’s legacy lives on in the dozens of PhDs whom she mentored or inspired in the biomedical sciences.\n\nPatrick M.

Sofia, Ph.D. received his BA in chemistry with honors from Cornell University in 1980. He went onto receive his Ph.D. in organic chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1984 working for Prof. John Katzenellenbogen where he was an NIH Trainee. His thesis work focused on the design, synthesis and study of mechanism based inhibitors of serine proteases. At the University of Illinois, he received the R.C. Fuson Memorial Award for Superior Performance in Graduate Research. In 1984 he joined the laboratory of Prof. Gilbert Stork at Columbia University as an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow and worked on radical cyclization chemistry and vitamin D total synthesis.\n\nDr. Sofia began his industrial career in 1986 at E.R. Squibb & Sons where he developed inhibitors of squalene synthetase and HMG-CoA reductase for the treatment of atherosclerosis. His work lead to the identification of the first potent substrate-based inhibitor of squalene synthetase.\n\nIn 1989 Dr. Sofia joined Eli Lilly & Company as a Research Scientist. He spearheaded work in the area of leukotriene B4 receptor antagonists for the treatment of inflammation associated with asthma and delivered the clinical candidate LY293111 which progressed to phase II clinical trials. For this effort he was awarded the Lilly Discovery Team Award in 1991. Dr. Sofia also led the PLA2 discovery project team during his tenure at Lilly.\n\nIn 1993 Dr. Sofia took his first leap into biotech when he joined Transcell Technologies as the founding Director of Chemistry. He eventually was promoted to Vice President of Research. At Transcell Dr. Sofia pioneered the development of carbohydrate-based technologies for combinatorial chemistry and anti-infective drug discovery. This work led to the development of the first library of a complex anti-infective oligosaccharide and the use of monosaccharides as chemical diversity templates.\n\nSubsequently in 1999, Dr. Sofia joined Bristol-Myers Squibb where he became Group Director of New Leads Chemistry. At BMS, Dr. Sofia built a lead discovery chemistry organization and global research capability that supported all research programs and that led to a dramatic improvement in the identification of new chemical matter to initiate lead optimization programs.\n\nDr. Sofia left BMS in 2005 to join Pharmasset, Inc. as Vice President of Chemistry and was later promoted to Senior Vice President of Chemistry. There he built the companies capability and programs around novel antiviral agents. His work led to multiple clinical candidates including a number of agents targeting the hepatitis C virus (HCV). His work on HCV resulted in the development of the HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir that utilized a novel liver-targeted prodrug strategy. In 2013 sofosbuvir became the first interferon-free HCV cure therapy approved by both the US FDA and the European EMEA and was marketed as Sovaldi®. It quickly became the most successful drug launched in history and was designated by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine. It soon became the backbone of HCV-cure combination therapies and is part of the fixed-dose combination regimens Harvoni®, and Epclusa® and is used in combination with many other HCV targeted agents. Today over 1.2 million individuals have been cured of HCV using sofosbuvir-based therapeutic regimens.\n\nWith the acquisition of Pharmasset by Gilead Sciences in 2012, Dr. Sofia remained with Gilead for a period of time as Sr. V.P. of Chemistry but soon founded OnCore Biopharma to search for a cure for hepatitis B (HBV). OnCore Biopharma became Arbutus Biopharma, Inc. where Dr. Sofia is currently the Chief Scientific Officer and leads the discovery research and preclinical development efforts in search of an HBV cure.\n\nDr. Sofia has authored over 100 publications, 12 book chapters and numerous abstracts and is an inventor on more than 53 US patents and numerous patent applications.

Miller, PhD\n\nProfessor Miller received his B.S. in chemistry from North Dakota State University in 1971, and had the pleasure of participating in undergraduate research with Prof. Socretes Peter Pappas. He obtained his Ph.D. in bioorganic chemistry from Cornell University in 1976 under the direction of G. Marc Loudon, was a National Institutes of Health fellow postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Prof. Henry Rapoport at the University of California at Berkeley (1975-77). Currently, he is the he George & Winifred Clark Chair Professor of Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry. He has spent his entire academic career at Notre Dame, starting as an Assistant Professor in 1977. He served as chair of the department from 2002-2005.\n\nThe primary interests in Professor Miller's laboratory are in synthetic and bioorganic chemistry. Most effort is directed toward the development of new methodology and its incorporation into the syntheses and study of biologically important compounds. Special emphasis is given to asymmetric syntheses and studies of hydroxamic acid containing microbial iron transport agents (siderophores), amino acids, peptides, b-lactam antibiotics and carbocyclic analogs of antifungal and anticancer nucleosides. Much effort has addressed the syntheses of functionalized b-lactams, the core unit of an important class of antibiotics. The result has been the development of an efficient, and generally applicable, synthetic approach based on a biomimetic N-C4 closure. This process and subsequent chemistry has facilitated the synthesis of several novel antibiotics and b-lactamase inhibitors. The chemical versatility of the methods indicates that a variety of new b-lactams may be synthesized for studying important structure-activity relationships. Studies of acylnitroso cycloadditions by oxidation of hydroxamic acids led to the development of new methods for the asymmetric syntheses of a variety of biologically interesting compounds. Longstanding efforts have been directed toward the syntheses and study of siderophore-antibiotic conjugates (sideromycins) in a program designed to develop iron transport-mediated drug delivery agents, including those with potential microbe-triggered release processes.\n\nProfessor Miller has directly mentored 80 graduate students and more than 70 postdoctoral fellows and research associates. His group has collaborated with interdisciplinary research groups around the world, with notable interactions through sabbatical opportunities in Australia, Germany and New Zealand. The combined studies have produced more than 300 scientific publications, numerous patents and presentations at hundreds of scientific meetings and invited lectureships. Research in the Miller group has been consistently supported by the NIH and several industrial grants. Dr. Miller has served on numerous, editorial boards, including Organic Syntheses and review panels and advisory boards.. He is an active consultant for a number of biotechnology and major pharmaceutical companies, having served 37 continuous years as a consultant at Eli Lilly and Co. He is the co-founder of PracticaChem, LLC that subsequently merged with Hsiri Therapeutics, LLC which he co-founded with Notre Dame alumni to develop technologies discovered in his laboratories.\n\nMajor support throughout Prof. Miller’s life has been provided by his wife, Patty. They met while undergraduates at North Dakota State University. They are the proud parents of four grown children, Chris, Katie, Joe and Carl, who, with their wonderful spouses have produced 10 grandchildren as of July, 2016.\n\nNicholas A. Meanwell, Ph.D., FRSC\n\nNicholas A. Meanwell received his B.Sc. in Special Honors chemistry from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England in 1976. In 1979, he earned a Ph.D. degree from the University of Sheffield under the direction of Dr. D. Neville Jones for studies of the application of alkenyl sulfoxides as key intermediates in the synthesis of a series of 9-deoxyprostaglandin and 9-thiaprostaglandin derivatives and the fragrance dihydrojasmone.\n\nFrom 1979-1982, Dr. Meanwell conducted post-doctoral training under the supervision of Professor Carl R. Johnson at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, where he devised a general synthetic approach to sulfoximine derivatives via sulfonimidoyl fluorides, completed the synthesis and sulfoximine-mediated resolution of the ginseng constituent β-panasinsene and devised a synthetic approach to a series of cyclopentane-containing natural products including hop ether, cis-jasmone, sarkomycin and known synthetic precursors to 11-deoxy-prostaglandins and PGE2 from a common intermediate.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Meanwell joined Bristol-Myers Squibb where he led teams in the cardiovascular therapeutic area that developed a series of imidazo[4,5-b]quinolin-2-ones as selective phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, potential antithrombotic agents based on blood platelet aggregation inhibition. His team also mapped the non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetic pharmacophore, defined most effectively by BMY-45778, a potent partial agonist that inhibited blood platelet aggregation induced by a range of activators, and contributed to the design of inhibitors of thrombin.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Dr. Meanwell contributed to CNS drug discovery efforts, leading the early phase team that explored the potential of Ca2+-dependent potassium channel modulators, a program that ultimately produced the Maxi K ion channel opener flindokalner (MaxiPostTM) which was advanced into Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of stroke.\n\nIn 1994, Dr. Meanwell assumed responsibility for antiviral drug discovery chemistry with the objective of establishing programs directed toward the discovery and development of inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). From this initiative, a series of RSV fusion inhibitors were characterized as the first small molecules to interfere with the association of the 6 helical peptide bundle that is a critical step in the virus entry process, with BMS-433771 nominated as a clinical candidate.\n\nA series of HIV-1 attachment inhibitors, the first small molecules described to function by interfering with the interaction between virus gp120 and the host cell CD4 receptor, were identified and optimized, with several compounds advanced into clinical trials from which BMS-488043 established clinical proof-of-concept for this mechanism. Fostemsavir, the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of temsavir, was approved by the FDA in 2020 and by the EMA in 2021 and is marketed as RukobiaTM.\n\nIn the arena of HCV inhibition, key discoveries to emerge from the group include the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir (DaklinzaTM), a first-in-class molecule that established this protein as a clinically-relevant target, and the HCV NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir (SunvepraTM), which incorporates the cyclopropyl acylsulfonamide moiety that has been widely adopted. The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in a clinical trial conducted in HCV-infected subjects who had failed pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy established for the first time that an HCV infection could be cured by direct acting antiviral agents in the absence of immune stimulation. The combination of DaklinzaTM and SunvepraTM was approved in Japan in 2014 for the treatment of genotype 1b HCV infection and DaklinzaTM was approved for marketing by the EMA in 2014 and by the FDA in 2015. In addition, beclabuvir, a thumb site inhibitor of HCV NS5B polymerase, was approved in Japan in 2016 as a fixed-dose combination therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir.\n\nDr. Meanwell is the author/co-author of more than 315 publications, review articles, book chapters and editorials and more than 200 meeting abstracts. He is named as an inventor/co-inventor of 145 granted U.S. Patents and has delivered more than 200 lectures at National and International meetings and schools on Medicinal Chemistry.\n\nDr. Meanwell was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1999, was admitted as a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering in 2014 and was elected as a Fellow of the American Chemical Society in August 2022.\n\nDr. Meanwell was a co-recipient of a PhRMA Research and Hope Award for Biopharmaceutical Industry Research in2014 for outstanding research in the area of HIV/AIDS and was a co-recipient of Heroes of Chemistry Awards sponsored by the American Chemical Society in 2017 and 2023.\n\nDr. Meanwell was the recipient of the 2015 Philip S. Portoghese Medicinal Chemistry Lectureship Award administered jointly by the ACS Division of Medicinal Chemistry and the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the 2022 Alfred Burger Award in Medicinal Chemistry sponsored by the American Chemical Society and the 2024 Antonín Holý Memorial Award sponsored by the International Society for Antiviral Research.\n\nRichard A. Gibbs\n\nPassed away on February 10, 2014\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Professor of Medicinal Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology\n\nProfessor Richard A. Gibbs graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1983 with a BS in Natural Sciences. Rich obtained his Ph. D. in 1988 from University of California - Riverside for work on Vitamin D analogs and the development of new synthetic methods with Professor Bill Okamura. He was an NSF postdoctoral fellow at Penn State University from 1988-1991, where he performed catalytic antibody research with Professor Steve Benkovic. Rich began his academic career in 1992 in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Wayne State University. As an Assistant and Associate Professor Rich made seminal contributions to the areas of medicinal and bioorganic chemistry, and the synthesis and mechanistic evaluation of anticancer drugs. Rich continued this research throughout his tenure at Wayne State and at Purdue University, where he moved to in 2001 as a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. He also served as the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the College of Pharmacy at Purdue.\n\nRich’s research was focused on mechanistic and inhibitory studies of protein prenyltransferases and related enzyme targets, and the design and synthesis of chemical probes of protein prenylation. Many key signal transduction proteins are modified by prenylation of a cysteine residue, followed by a specific proteolytic cleavage step and finally methylation. This has led to intense interest in protein-farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors as potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and such compounds are currently in human clinical trials. Rich’s laboratory employed chemical biology approaches to address two key questions in the field of protein prenylation. They explored the substrate specificity of FTase, with the goal of developing potential isoprenoid-based inhibitors or modulators of protein prenylation. Secondly, they used synthetic isoprenoid analogues and labeled derivatives as probes of the biological function of protein prenylation. Rich also developed a new stereospecific route to isoprenoids to synthesize novel, specifically substituted analogues of FPP, the isoprenoid substrate of FTase. This program led to the development of a series of potent inhibitors of FTase and farnesol analogues that are potent inhibitors of the growth of certain human tumor cells in vitro.\n\nIn one example of this research program, Rich explored the posttranslational modifications of the signaling protein K-Ras, a protein that is modified post-translationally via sequential prenylation, proteolysis, and α-carboxyl methylation reactions. Both prenylation, which is catalyzed by a soluble prenyltransferase, and methylation, which is catalyzed by a membrane-associated isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt), are key modifications for the proper localization and biological function of K-Ras. Since mutant K-Ras proteins are key drivers in several human cancers, including ~90% of human pancreatic carcinomas, Rich was very interested in developing inhibitors of the human Icmt-dependent methylation of K-Ras as a way to block its activity in tumor cells. In collaboration with Professor Christine Hrycyna, Rich developed a readily-synthesized class of nanomolar human Icmt (hIcmt) inhibitors based on the substrate N-acetyl-farnesyl cysteine. Structure activity relationship studies led to led to a lead compound, sTAB-F3-Diol, which has a Ki of approximately 50 nM against hIcmt. sTAB-F3-Diol also blocked cellular Ras activation, interfered with Ras signaling through Erk, and exhibited nanomolar to low micromolar IC50 values versus pancreatic tumor cells in both 2D and 3D cell culture systems. Further optimization of the biochemical activity and drug-like characteristics of this promising agent resulted in a new molecule with a Ki value of ~25 nM against human Icmt in in vitro enzymatic assays.\n\nRich’s awards for research include an American Cancer Society Junior Faculty Research Award, the PhRMA Foundation Research Award, the Lions Club Purdue Cancer Center Research Award and the University Faculty Scholar Award from Purdue University, and for his excellence in teaching he was awarded the Instructor of the Year in the College of Pharmacy, and the College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions Excellence in Teaching Award at Wayne State. Rich was always very interested in the application of his work to cancer treatment and was awarded a number of patents focused on his designed inhibitors.\n\nRich’s service to the medicinal chemistry community was truly exemplary. Highlights of this dedicated service include: Chair, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, American Chemical Society (2006); Vice Chair, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, American Chemical Society (2005); Academic Councilor, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, American Chemical Society (2008-2013); Member, Long Range Planning Committee, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, American Chemical Society (2003-2005); Chair, Awards Symposium, 231st National Meeting of American Chemical Society (2006); Chair, Medicinal Chemistry Award Symposium, National Medicinal Chemistry Symposium (2006); Chair and Organizer, Robertson and MEDI Fellowship Awards Symposium (2006); Member, Organizing Committee – First Annual Indiana Medicinal Chemistry Symposium (2010); Member, Organizing Committee – 3rd Frontiers in Medicinal Chemistry Meeting (2013); Editorial Advisory Board Member, Seventh Edition of Burger’s Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery (2007); Program Leader, Medicinal Chemistry Program, Purdue Cancer Center (2006-2013); Chair, PULSe Executive Committee, Purdue University (2010-2012); Co-chair, National ACS meeting in Anaheim \"SERMS\" Symposium (2004); Co-chair, National ACS meeting in Philadelphia \"Pharmacoproteomics\" Symposium (2004); Co-chair, National ACS meeting \"Druggable Targets in Functional Lipidomics\" symposium (2005); and Program Chair of the 2004 Midwest Enzyme Chemistry Conference.\n\nThe field of medicinal chemistry lost one of its cherished colleagues when Rich passed away in February of 2014 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his wife Barbara (Schuster) Gibbs.\n\nJohn E. Macor, Ph.D.\n\nJohn Macor earned his B.S. degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1982 doing undergraduate research with Professor Marvin Miller (a 2016 inductee of the MEDI HOF) and earned his Ph.D. degree at Princeton University with Professor E. C. Taylor (a 2011 inductee of the MEDI HOF) in 1986. Dr. Macor’s career has spanned five different decades and five different pharmaceutical companies with significant contributions in each of them. He began his career at Pfizer (Groton, CT) in 1986 where he was engaged in a variety of CNS drug discovery efforts, moved to Astra Arcus (Rochester, NY) in 1994 focusing on cholinergic drug discovery, and then moved to Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1997 (Princeton, NJ), starting in cardiovascular and moving to neuroscience in 2001 and immunoscience in 2013. He assumed the role as Executive Director of Neuroscience Discovery Chemistry in 2002 (Wallingford, CT), and he was appointed Executive Director of Immunosciences Discovery Chemistry in 2013 (Lawrenceville, NJ). In October 2016, he accepted the role as Global Head of Integrated Drug Discovery for Sanofi with groups in Paris, Frankfurt and Waltham, MA. In 2022, he moved to Sionna Therapeutics as its Chief Scientific Officer (CSO). In 2024, John focused his efforts on his consulting company, JEM Pharma Consulting LLC. John has led more than 25 different teams to successful outcomes, i.e., compounds brought to Development for patients with serious unmet medical needs, culminating thus far in four marketed drugs.\n\nJohn is a co-inventor of Relpax® (eletriptan), an anti-migraine agent (5HT1D­ receptor agonist) discovered during his time at Pfizer. At BMS, he was also a co-inventor of Nurtec ODT® (rimegepant), an oral CGRP receptor antagonist, and Zavzpret® (zavegepant), an intranasally delivered CGRP receptor antagonist, both for the treatment of migraine. Biohaven developed the drugs, and Pfizer acquired both for $11.6 billion in 2022. Also, while at BMS, he was also a co-inventor of Filspari® (sparsentan, a dual AT1/ETA receptor antagonist). Filspari® (sparsentan) was developed by Travere Therapeutics and received accelerated approval in February 2023 for the treatment of IgA nephropathy. John was a co-inventor of BMS-708163 (avagecestat, a γ-secretase inhibitor for Alzheimer’s Disease) that reached Phase 2. At Astra he was co-inventor of AZD0328, an α7 neuronal nicotinic receptor agonist, which advanced to Phase 2 trials for schizophrenia. Dr. Macor is also a co-inventor of LX9211 (an AAK1 inhibitor for neuropathic pain with positive results in Phase 2). Lastly, John is a co-inventor of a number of immunoscience compounds presently in early-stage clinical trials.\n\nDr. Macor has authored/co-authored more than 220 peer-reviewed publications, is an inventor on more than 140 granted US patents, has given more than 115 invited lectures, and has over 580 publications, issued US patents, invited lectures, and external meeting presentations. His contributions in the syntheses of heterocyclic compounds, intramolecular 1,2,4-triazine Diels-Alder reactions, indole chemistry, and conformation restriction using heterocycles as bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry are widely cited in the literature. He has participated in, and led teams in neuroscience, cardiovascular, metabolic, oncology, immunology, and rare disease projects, indicative of expansive expertise, creativity and impact in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Dr. Macor chaired the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on Medicinal Chemistry and the 2006 Gordon Research Conference on Heterocyclic Compounds. Dr. Macor served as Editor-in-Chief of Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry for Volumes 42 – 46 (2006 – 2011). Dr. Macor was awarded the 2009 Scarborough Award in Medicinal Chemistry for medicinal chemistry accomplishments under the age of 50 and was honored as an American Society Fellow in 2011. Dr. Macor served as Chair of the Medicinal Chemistry Division (MEDI) of the American Chemical Society in 2015 and served a total of ten years on the Executive Committee of MEDI in various roles. Dr. Macor was awarded the 2014 Alfred Burger Award in Medicinal Chemistry (a National Award from the American Chemical Society) “to recognize outstanding contributions to research in medicinal chemistry,” and was inducted into the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame in August 2014. He was designated as the 2019 Smissman awardee from the MEDI Division of the ACS “given to a living scientist whose research, teaching or service has had a substantial impact on the intellectual and theoretical development of the field of Medicinal Chemistry.” In 2020, he was awarded the IUPAC-Richter Prize in medicinal chemistry “in recognition of his outstanding creative contributions in the field of medicinal chemistry research on drugs for the treatment of migraine.”\n\nArun K. Ghosh, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Arun K. Ghosh is the Ian P. Rothwell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology at Purdue University. He was born in Calcutta, India and obtained his B.S. degree in Chemistry (1979) and his M.S. degree in Chemistry (1981) from the Calcutta University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India respectively. He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry (1985) from University of Pittsburgh. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University (1985-1988) where he worked in Professor E. J. Corey’s laboratories. Following his postdoctoral studies, he joined Merck Research laboratories at West Point, Pennsylvania as a medicinal chemist in late 1988. He worked on a number of research areas including inhibitor design against HIV protease and HIV reverse transcriptase. He also worked on the design of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype-selective antagonists for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. In summer of 1994, he began his independent academic career as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois, Chicago. He became a tenured Associate Professor in 1997 and then Professor of Chemistry, in 1998. In 2005, he moved to Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana as a Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Chemistry and Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology.\n\nOver the years, Professor Ghosh’s research interests have bridged the areas of bioorganic, medicinal and synthetic chemistry. He has made notable contributions in the structure-based design and development of human medicine. Noteworthy is his creative development of Darunavir, the first FDA approved treatment for drug resistant HIV in 2006. Darunavir has now emerged as frontline therapy for HIV/AIDS. His research efforts on Alzheimer’s Disease set the stage for structure-based drug design efforts on beta-secretase inhibitors. His work on natural product syntheses and subsequent biological studies opened up new promise for treatment of resistant cancers. Ghosh’s research efforts in medicinal chemistry have led to the development of numerous conceptual tools for protein-structure-based drug-design, drug optimization and development. These include, backbone binding concept for designing of HIV-1 protease inhibitors to combat drug resistance, introduction of urethanes of stereochemically defined cyclic ethers and cyclic sulfones in drug design, protein-structure-based design of selectivity for beta-secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer’s Disease and design of reversible and irreversible inhibitors against corona virus proteases. His extensive work in synthetic chemistry resulted in chemical syntheses of numerous targets, covering over three dozen or so different structural families, including bioactive targets such as Laulimalide, Peloruside, Doliculide, Zapanolide, Lasanolide, Platensin and Platensomycin and others. He has been active in the determination of biological mechanisms of action of several anticancer natural products and conceptual design of molecular probes for in-depth studies, as well. These agents were isolated in miniscule quantity and in-depth biological studies could not be carried out. His syntheses and subsequent studies led to the discovery that both laulimalide and pelorusides are potent against taxol resistant cell lines, they bind to a novel drug-binding site on tubulin and show a synergistic effect with taxol. More recently, in collaboration with researchers at the NCI, lasonolide was shown to have a novel chromosome condensing ability. His research is also involved in the development of many new synthetic methodologies including asymmetric syn- and anti-selective adol reactions, asymmetric catalytic Diels-Alder, hetero Diel-Alder, Prins cyclization and asymmetric multicomponent reactions where multiple chiral centers are set in a single one-pot operation. His broad medicinal chemistry research efforts continue to improve the design of HIV protease inhibitors for combating drug-resistant-HIV, but also make significant contribution through the design and development of beta-secretase (memapsin 2) inhibitors for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, and design of cysteine protease inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus proteases. His research efforts also led to the design and synthesis of the first potent beta-secretase inhibitors, and determination of the first X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor-bound beta-secretase-1, development of tools for selectivity design against beta-secretase 2 (memapsin 1) and Cathepsin D and also creation of inhibitors for clinical development.\n\nArun Ghosh has been awarded the Chemical Research Society of India Medal (2012); MERIT Award, National Institutes of Health (2011); IUPAC-Richter Prize in Medicinal Chemistry (2010); American Chemical Society’s Arthur C. Cope Senior Scholar Award (2010); Jeananne D. and James B. Chaney Research and Scholarship Achievement Award (2010). He received the ACS Robert Scarborough Excellence in Medicinal Chemistry Award (2008) and has received Novartis Chemistry Lectureship (2010-2011). He was elected as a member of American Association for the Advancement of Science (2005). He is on the current editorial advisory boards of numerous organic and medicinal chemistry international journals including ChemMedChem (2010-2013), ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2010-2013), Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (2010-2013), Letters in Drug Design and Discovery (2010-2013), Reports in Organic Chemistry (2010-2013), Future Medicinal Chemistry (2008-2013) and Virus, Adaptation & Treatment (2008-2013). He is one of the scientific founders of Athenagen, Oklahoma City (2002), an Alzheimer’s drug-development company. Other honors include University Scholar, University of Illinois (1998-2001), National MERIT Scholar, Government of India (1976 - 1981). Professor Ghosh is the author of over 245 scientific research publications in leading international journals and over 50 US patents and patent applications in the fields of inhibitors of HIV-1 protease, beta-secretase inhibitors, SARS protease inhibitors and anti-cancer agents. He edited a book entitled, ‘Aspartic Acid Proteases as Therapeutic Targets’ published by Wiley-VCH in 2010.\n\nHe is married to his wife, Jody, an emergency physician and lives in West Lafayette, IN with their three children.\n\nNicholas Bodor, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Nicholas Bodor is a Graduate Research Professor Emeritus (active) at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Gainesville. He joined the university in 1979 as Professor and Chairman of the Medicinal Chemistry Department, and was promoted to Graduate Research Professor in 1983. He is the Executive Director of the college’s Center for Drug Discovery, founded by him in 1986. During his tenure at the University of Florida, Dr. Bodor has supervised the training of more than 50 doctoral students and over 100 postdoctoral level research associates and fellows. In February 2000, he took a leave of absence from his academic posts at the University of Florida in order to accept a position as Senior Vice President of Basic Research and Drug Discovery at the IVAX Corporation. Dr. Bodor then served as Chief Scientific Officer of the IVAX Corporation, Managing Director of the IVAX Drug Research Institute, Budapest, Hungary, as well as President of the IVAX Research Institute until October 2005.\n\nDr. Bodor's main research interests include design of drugs with improved therapeutic index, design of new chemical delivery systems, computer-assisted drug design, drug transport and metabolism, and theoretical and mechanistic organic chemistry. He has published more than 520 research articles, has over 200 patents, and is on the editorial boards of several international scientific journals. An internationally recognized leader in drug discovery, design and delivery, he has introduced revolutionary, general, comprehensive drug design and drug targeting concepts known as retrometabolic drug design approaches. These concepts strategically combine chemical and enzymatic (metabolic) processes to achieve drug targeting and to produce safe drugs and safe environmental chemicals. The two major classes of the retrometabolic drug design concepts contain “chemical drug targeting systems” (CDS) and the “soft drugs” (SD). Each of these large classes contains various subclasses, based on the different design rules. The design concepts incorporated in the soft drug approaches were used by Dr. Bodor to develop a general and comprehensive program, including a computerized expert system which can be used to design all potential and possible metabolites and the corresponding safe active soft drugs or chemical delivery systems. The soft steroid Loteprednol Etabonate, designed by Dr. Bodor, is on the market in the U.S. and other countries. Other drugs designed by him using the retrometabolic concepts are in advanced clinical development. The progress in these various related fields is reviewed biennially at an international series of symposia Dr. Bodor has founded and organizes entitled, The Retrometabolism Based Drug Design and Targeting Conference. The ninth meeting of this series is scheduled for May 2013 in Orlando; in addition to Florida, venues of the previous eight conferences have included Japan, Hungary and Austria.\n\nDr. Bodor received his B.S./M.S. degree in Organic Chemistry in 1959 at Bolyai University in Transylvania, and his Ph.D. degree in 1965 from the University of Babes-Bolyai, Cluj and the Romanian National Academy of Sciences. He was a Group Leader at the Pharmacochemical Research Institute in Romania until 1968, when he was offered an R. A. Welch Fellowship at the University of Texas in Austin, where he worked in the field of theoretical organic chemistry with Dr. Michael J. S. Dewar, the first Robert A. Welch Research Chair. In 1972 he became a Senior Research Scientist at ALZA Laboratories in Lawrence, Kansas, which later became INTERx Research Corporation, where he was Director of Research, as well as an Adjunct Professor at the University of Kansas until 1978.\n\nAmong his many honors, Dr. Bodor is an elected Fellow of the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and American College of Clinical Pharmacology. He is also an Honorary Member of the Hungarian Chemical Society and the Panhellenic Society of Pharmacists.

In 1994 he was named the first recipient of the Nagai Foundation Tokyo International Fellowship. He was named by the American Chemical Society as the 1996 recipient of the Leo Friend Award in recognition of his article entitled, \"Design of Biologically Safer Chemicals,\" published in Chemtech, October 1995. He is the first College of Pharmacy faculty member to receive a Professorial Excellence Award, given by the University of Florida in 1996. The AACP selected Dr. Bodor as the recipient of the 1997 Volwiler Research Achievement Award. In April 2000, Dr. Bodor was named the V. Ravi Chandran Professor in Drug Design and Targeting of the UF College of Pharmacy, the first recipient of this endowed professorship. In February 2002, he was elected a Fellow of the World Innovation Foundation. An honorary Doctor of Science degree was conferred upon Dr. Bodor by the University of Florida in 2005. In 2007, the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists awarded Dr. Bodor with the Distinguished Pharmaceutical Scientist Award.\n\nIn addition to the awards above, Dr. Bodor has received the highest levels of recognition from his home country of Hungary for his scientific achievements and leadership of the Budapest-based Institute for Drug Research. In 1989 he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the Technical University of Budapest, and then was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa degree from the Medical University of Debrecen in 1990. In 1995 he was elected to the Hungarian National Academy of Sciences. Ferenc Madl, President of Hungary, awarded Dr. Bodor the Gold Cross of Merit of the Hungarian Republic in 2004. In 2010 he received the prestigious Fabinyi Prize of the Hungarian Chemical Society, which is given to scientists living outside Hungary whose outstanding scientific accomplishment have contributed to the reputation of the HCS. In August 2010 at the national celebration of Hungary’s over 1000 years statehood and its canonized first king, St. Stephen, Dr. Bodor was awarded at the Hungarian Parliament, the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic, a prestigious award of civil merit.\n\nDr. Bodor and his wife Sheryl call Miami their primary residence. He founded Bodor Laboratories, Inc. in 2006, and works there with his son Erik and daughter Nicole (who hold PhD/MBA and PhD degrees, respectively, in the relevant fields) to further develop his drug design strategies to the marketplace. His oldest son Miklós (an MD, PhD) is Chairman of the Clinical Pharmacology Department at the Medical University in Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nIn 2012 he was named to the ACS Division of Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame.\n\nVictor J. Hruby, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor Victor J. Hruby is Regents Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arizona. Dr. Hruby was born in Valley City, North Dakota and received his B.S. and M.S., with A. William Johnson, at the University of North Dakota. He then went to Cornell University where he received his Ph.D. with A. T. Blomquist, and then was an Instructor at Cornell University Medical College with Vincent duVigneaud, Nobel Laureate. He moved to the University of Arizona in 1968 as an Assistant Professor. He became Associate Professor with Tenure in 1972, Full Professor in 1977 and Regents Professor in 1989.\n\nProfessor Hruby’s research has been primarily in the chemistry, conformation-biological activity relationships, and molecular mechanisms of information transduction and of molecular diseases associated with peptide hormones and neurotransmitters and their receptors that modulate health, disease and human behavior. Specific hormones and neurotransmitters of interest include the opioids, the melanotropins, CCK, glucagon, substance P, oxytocin and related compounds and receptors. Specific methods and approaches used in this research include: de novo design of biologically active peptides and peptidomimetics; asymmetric synthesis; design and asymmetric synthesis of novel chi constrained amino acids; computational chemistry; conformational analysis using NMR, X-ray crystallography and other biophysical tools; combinatorial chemistry; conformation-biological activity relationships, especially as they relate to the design of conformationally and topographically constrained peptide, peptidomimetic and peptide mimetic hormone and neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists for exploring the chemical-physical basis for information transduction in biological systems; the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of peptide and peptide mimetic ligands that affect pain, addictions, feeding behaviors, pigmentation, sexual behavior and motivation, glucose homeostasis, cancer and other biological effects; the chemical-physical basis for behavior; the mechanisms of hormone and neurotransmitter action; peptide mimetic design; and the structure-function of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\nThe Hruby group has developed new synthetic methodologies for the assembly of multimeric ligands for the detection and treatment of pain, cancer and other diseases; a new approach to design of ligands for disease states involving the concept of overlapping pharmacophores to address several receptors simultaneously in a single small molecular ligand for the treatment of neuropathic pain without tolerance or addiction and which cross the blood-brain-barrier; and a new biophysical method, plasmon waveguide resonance spectroscopy, which allows one for the first time to examine the structures, thermodynamics and kinetics of GPCRs and other integral membrane proteins on interactions with ligands, modulatory proteins, enzymes, parallel and perpendicular to the membrane bilayer independently. Professor Hruby has published over 1000 articles, reviews, chapters, commentaries and editorials and has over 25 patents and patent filings.\n\nVictor Hruby has received numerous awards and honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship (1984), the Alan E. Pierce Award (now the Merrifield Award) (1993), a Senior Humboldt Fellowship (1999-2000) and the American Chemical Society Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award (2009). He was awarded a Doctor of Science, Honous Causa from the Free University of Brussels (1989) and was named Regents Professor at the University of Arizona (1989). Additional awards include the American Chemical Society Ralph F. Hirschmann Award (2002), The Jacob Javits Neuroscience Award (1987), the NIH MERIT Award (1988), Sommer Award (2003), Arizona Innovator of the Year (2009), and the Goodman Scientific Excellence and Mentorship Award (2011).\n\nIn 2012 he was named to the ACS Division of Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame.\n\nJoseph H. Burckhalter, Ph.D.\n\nPassed away on May 9, 2004\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Research professor of medicinal chemistry at the Medical Research Institute, Florida Institute of Technology\n\nThe below biography was provided at the time of the award.\n\nJoseph H. Burckhalter was born in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1912. He earned a B.S. in chemistry from the University of South Carolina in 1934 and an M.S. in organic chemistry from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1938. In 1942, he received his doctorate in medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan, where he had been a graduate student of the legendary Frederick Blicke.\n\nUpon earning his doctorate, Burckhalter went to work for Parke Davis & Co. in Detroit, MI. From the pain-relieving drug now Tylenol, he derived Camoquin, a curative agent for the treatment of malaria. Subsequently, Burckhalter went to the University of Kansas College of Pharmacy, where he initiated the school's doctoral program in medicinal chemistry. He also served at the National Defense Medical Center in Taiwan, and as a Fulbright professor in Germany. In 1960, Burckhalter moved to the University of Michigan, where he took over the department chairmanship from his former mentor, Frederick Blicke. He chaired Michigan's program until Albert B. Prescott Professor Emeritus of Medicinal Chemistry Leroy Townsend was recruited, at which point Burckhalter turned over the reins. Burckhalter, who was a professor of medicinal chemistry at the College of Pharmacy from 1960-82, had a distinguished career in biomedical research as a scientist, teacher and administrator dedicated to utilizing medicinal chemistry for the discovery of new drugs, particularly those to treat cancer and infectious diseases. Although Burckhalter retired from the University of Michigan in 1982 at age 70, he continued to be active in scientific research for a number of years. He served as a research professor of medicinal chemistry at the Medical Research Institute, Florida Institute of Technology, where he continued an active interest in drug development in the areas of cancer and virus diseases such as AIDS. He was a recipient of the American Innovator Award from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Distinguished Alumni Award at the Universities of South Carolina and Illinois, and the Order of the Palmetto, given by the governor of South Carolina. He is listed in \"Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare.\"\n\nAmong his many achievements, Burckhalter was largely responsible for building the interdepartmental graduate programs in medicinal chemistry at both the University of Kansas and the University of Michigan. In collaboration with Robert Seiwald, he made an essential contribution to the identification of antigens through the synthesis of fluorescein isothiocyanate, better known as FITC. This provided the first practical and first patented antibody labeling agent, and the stable, yellow-green-fluorescent compound has become widely used for rapid, accurate, and economic diagnosis of infectious diseases. FITC has played an important role in identifying the cause of AIDS and can be used to distinguish between different strains of streptococci. It has proved infallible in tests for syphilis. FITC and red RITC (rhodamine isothiocyanate) are used together to quickly diagnose leukemia and lymphoma. FITC also paved the way for the development of other labeling procedures, such as radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immosorbent assay (ELISA). Although he passed away in 2004, Burckhalter continues to contribute to drug discovery. The University of Kansas high-throughput screening laboratory maintains a very valuable collection of more than 15,000 unique natural compounds, including a set of information rich molecules developed years ago through the intuition and experience of world-class medicinal chemist Joseph Burckhalter.\n\nGertrude B. Elion, M.S.\n\nPassed away on February 21, 1999\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy at Burroughs-Wellcome\n\nThe following biography appears on the Academy of Achievement web site\n\n(see also her autobiography at Nobel.org):\n\nGertrude Elion was born in New York City. She entered Hunter College at the age of 15 and graduated summa cum laude with a BS in chemistry in 1937, when she was only 19. In her first years after college, Elion had difficulty finding work as a chemist. There were few women working in the field, and many laboratories refused to hire women altogether. She acquired experience working in part-time and temporary jobs. While working, she earned an M.S. in chemistry from New York University. She taught high school for a few years, until the Second World War created more opportunities for women in industry.\n\nHired by Burroughs-Wellcome in 1944, she embarked on a 40-year scientific partnership with Dr. George Hitchings. They set themselves an unorthodox course, attempting to create new medicines by studying the chemical composition of disease cells. Within a few years, this approach had borne fruit with the development of the first two successful drugs for the treatment of acute leukemia: Purinethol and Thioguanine.\n\nElion's responsibilities expanded, and she began to lead larger and larger teams of her own, discovering compounds such as allopurinol, used for the treatment of gout and to relieve the side effects of chemotherapy. Her discovery of azathioprine, which suppresses the immune system's rejection of foreign tissue made kidney transplants between unrelated donors possible. More than half a million people worldwide have benefited from this discovery since 1963.\n\nIn 1967, she was named Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy at Burroughs-Wellcome. Over the following decade, Elion's team at Burroughs-Wellcome entered a field which pharmaceutical companies had previously shunned. They attempted to create compounds which would block viral infections. It was widely believed that any compound capable of suppressing viral activity would be hopelessly toxic. Elion's patience was rewarded with the creation of acyclovir, the world's first successful anti-viral medication. It is often used in the treatment of herpes.\n\nGertrude Elion officially retired in 1983, but remained active in the scientific world, as a consultant with her old firm, now known as Glaxo-Wellcome, and as an advisor to the World Health Organization and the American Association for Cancer Research. Her name appears on 45 patents.\n\nIn 1988, she shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine with her old colleague George Hitchings and researcher Sir James Black. She was one of only ten women to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences, and one of the very few recipients to earn a science Nobel without a doctorate. In 1991, she became the first woman to be inducted into the national Inventor's Hall of Fame, and was presented with the National Medal of Science by President George Bush.\n\nHans-Jurgen Hess, Ph.D.\n\nPassed away on May 28, 2023\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Research Chemist at Pfizer’s Medical Research Laboratories in Groton, Connecticut\n\nThe below biography was provided at the time of the award.\n\nHans-Jürgen Hess received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1957, working with Professor Hans Herloff Inhoffen at the Technical University Braunschweig, Germany. After postdoctoral work with Professor Randolph T. Major at the University of Virginia and Professor E.J. Corey at the University of Illinois, he joined Pfizer’s Medical Research Laboratories in Groton, Connecticut, as a Research Chemist in 1959. Hans Hess has a distinguished record in drug discovery and development. He was responsible for all Pfizer Medicinal Chemistry Research and affiliated functions in the US and Japan during a period of steady internal growth and productivity.\n\nIn 1963, he conceived and implemented a program for the discovery of a peripherally acting antihypertensive agent, work that culminated in the discovery of prazosin (Minipress®). At the time of its US introduction in 1976, Minipress® was a major advance in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and was mechanistically distinguished from any other antihypertensive agent. As a selective α1-adrenergic blocker, it was free of unfavorable effects on blood lipid profiles of other types of antihypertensive drugs in use. In 1988, Minipress® ranked third in the worldwide antihypertensive market. The drug was also shown effective in the treatment of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), and is the prototype of a class of structural analogs (doxazosin, terazosin, alfuzosin) developed and marketed for this indication. Prazosin became the laboratory standard in adrenergic receptor research and was the key to the α1-subclassification of adrenergic receptors. In 1991, Hans Hess received the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA) Discovery Award for the discovery of prazosin.\n\nHans Hess’s research interests and expertise range over a wide area of medicinal chemistry. He led the discovery efforts resulting in pirbuterol (Maxair®), a tissue selective ß-adrenergic agonist bronchodilator, sulprostone (Nalador®), a tissue selective prostaglandin analog for obstetric and gynecological uses, and the first potent, non-peptidic neurokinin-1 (substance P) antagonist. In parallel with his responsibilities in the US, he established in 1983 fully integrated Pfizer drug discovery operations in Japan, involving medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, biochemistry, molecular biology, drug metabolism, state-of-the-art microbial natural product screening and structure determination, and development functions. Building on the experience of automating microbial natural product screening in Japan, he subsequently established high throughput screening (HTS) of chemical compound libraries in receptor, enzyme, and cellular assays, Pfizer being one of the first companies in the industry implementing this technology for lead discovery. Hans Hess’s achievements have been chronicled in about 100 issued US patents and 70 publications and abstracts.\n\nThroughout his scientific career, Hans has been actively involved in professional activities contributing to the advancement of Medicinal Chemistry in numerous ways.

Mertes, Ph.D.\n\nPassed away on April 6, 1989\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Professor at the University of Kansas & Chair of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry\n\nMathias P. Mertes was born in Chicago on April 22, 1932. He was raised in Chicago and prepared early for a career in pharmacy, having delivered prescription drugs on his bicycle for his father's neighborhood pharmacy. He received a B.S. degree in pharmacy from the University of Illinois in 1954. Because of a keen interest in research he entered graduate school at the University of Texas, where he received an M.S. degree in medicinal chemistry with C. O. Wilson in 1956. He subsequently earned a Ph.D. degree with Ole Gisvold from the University of Minnesota in 1960. Upon completion of his Ph.D., Matt accepted a position at the University of Kansas as an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry. There he joined Ed Smissman, who had just moved to Kansas as Chair of medicinal chemistry, and who had been an undergraduate instructor of Matt's at the University of Illinois. Matt advanced rapidly in his career, reaching the rank of Professor in 1968. Together, Matt and Ed Smissman built a strong and vigorous department and established many traditions that still persist to this day. Matt continued this legacy after Ed's death in 1974, serving as Chair of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry from 1974-1975.\n\nAs a teacher Matt was extremely dedicated, being popular with graduate and undergraduate students alike. He won several teaching awards, including the University of Kansas EXXON Award in 1986 and the Rho Chi Teaching Award presented by students of the School of Pharmacy. Matt was also a finalist for the prestigious H.O.P.E. (Honor for the Outstanding Progressive Educator) Award, an award given annually by the University's senior class. He was also one of the pioneers in advocating and providing continuing education for practicing pharmacists in Kansas, participating with great enthusiasm in continuing education seminar trips around the state. He was also one of the founders of the highly successful medicinal chemistry meeting-in-miniature known affectionately as the MIKI meeting. Since 1963, this meeting has been held annually on a rotating basis among the Universities of Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and Illinois.\n\nAs a research scholar Matt's interests varied widely. They included: 1) development of methodology for the synthesis of nucleoside, nucleotide, and nucleic acid analogs, 2) studies on thymidylate synthetase model systems and reaction mechanisms including the design and synthesis of thymidylate synthetase inhibitors, 3) the design, synthesis and evaluation of glutamate receptor probes that discriminate between glutamate receptor subtypes, and 4) with his wife, Kristin, University Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at the University of Kansas, polyammonium macrocycle synthesis, ligand complexation, and mechanism of catalysis of formyl phosphate and ATP hydrolysis. Matt received an NIH Career Development Award (1967-72) enabling him to spend one year in the laboratory of F. Sorm at the Czechoslovakian Academy of Sciences in Prague (nucleic acid chemistry). He also spent six months at the University of Colorado studying in vitro mRNA translation. In 1983, he and Kristin spent a sabbatical in the laboratory of 1987 Nobel laureate Jean-Marie Lehn at Strasbourg. During his career Matt published over 100 scientific papers and directed 23 graduate students to the Ph.D. degree, in addition to training five M.S. students and a number of postdocs. Matt served as Chair of the Division of Medicinal Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 1978, as Vice-chair in 1977, and served on the Division's membership, long-range planning and membership directory committees. He also served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry and Nucleosides and Nucleotides. His service also included a four-year term on the Medicinal Chemistry A Study Section at NIH and another four-year term on the NIH Biomedical Research Support Committee.\n\nAfter Matt's untimely death from a heart attack on Thursday, April 6, 1989, Frances Degan Horowitz, Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Studies at Kansas, remarked, \"He was always available to help on projects that transcended his lab, his department, his school and his adopted state. He did all this with personal grace, with uncommon gentleness and with generous spirit. Such personal qualities ensure that our memories of an exceptional friend and colleague will remain vivid, inspiring and enduring.\"\n\nThe Mathias P. Mertes Memorial Fund was established by the University of Kansas Endowment Association with contributions from his family, friends, colleagues, students and co-workers to memorialize Matt's dedication to excellence in research and scholarship through a student-initiated lecture series.\n\nUsed with permission of the University of Kansas Department of Medicinal Chemistry.\n\nEdward C.

Abraham, Ph.D.\n\nPassed away on March 29, 2021\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Alfred and Francis Burger Emeritus Professor of Medicinal Chemistry & Biological Chemistry, & Emeritus Director of the Institute for Structural Biology and Drug Discovery at Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nThe below biography was provided at the time of the award.\n\nDr. Donald J. Abraham is the Alfred and Francis Burger Emeritus Professor of Medicinal Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, and Emeritus Director of the Institute for Structural Biology and Drug Discovery at Virginia Commonwealth University. Prof. Abraham received his BS degree in Chemistry from Penn State University (1958), an MS in Chemistry at Marshall University (1959) and his Ph.D. degree at Purdue (1963). Following the completion of his degree, he completed postdoctoral studies with Prof. Alfred Burger at the University of Virginia. He joined the faculty in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964, and rapidly rose through the ranks, becoming a full professor in 1972. Don assumed the chairmanship of the department in 1969, and served in that capacity until 1988. In that year, Don was appointed chair of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University, a position he held until 2007. During his academic career, Don held affiliate appointments in several departments, including physics, crystallography, psychiatry, pharmacology, biomedical engineering and biophysics; these appointments are a testament to his versatility and breadth of expertise in science, and to the interdisciplinary nature of his drug discovery research.\n\nProf. Abraham has conducted research in a variety of therapeutic areas, but he is perhaps best known as a pioneer in the area of structure-based design. His studies of the structure of hemoglobin and the use of that structure to design specific allosteric ligands represent seminal advances in computer-based drug design. He is recognized as the first medicinal chemist who applied protein crystallography to drug design, after proposing this concept to Alfred Burger in 1963. He presented a paper at the Alfred Burger retirement symposium that is regarded as the first reported use of crystallography in medicinal chemistry. Working with Peter Goodford from Wellcome UK and Nobel laureate Max Perutz, Don applied structure-based design methodologies to discover novel allosteric modulators of hemoglobin function. He published a landmark paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science U.S.A. (1983) that describes the first successful use of fragment-based drug design. His efforts ultimately resulted in the discovery of a hemoglobin allosteric effector, RSR-13, that was advanced to human clinical trials for hypoxic disease. Another analogue resulting from this work, 5-HMF, is currently in a phase 1 trial jointly administered by NIH and AesRX Inc.\n\nDuring his career, Don founded or co-founded three successful companies: Allos Therapeutics, which produced an FDA-approved anticancer drug, eduSoft, a software company that markets the structure-based design program HINT, and kSERO that specializes in teaching children science through game playing. He also founded and was the first director of the Institute of Structural Biology and Drug Discovery at the Virginia Commonwealth University. This has been acknowledged as the first such institute in academia. In addition to these achievements, he has provided outstanding service to the field of medicinal chemistry, including serving as chair of the National Medicinal Chemistry Symposium, a member of numerous NIH study sections and as chair of the ACS Division of Medicinal Chemistry. Don has published more than 175 peer-reviewed articles, has been awarded $12.5 million in external funding, and has 35 awarded or pending patents. Notably, Don edited the 6th Edition of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry, and co-edited the 7th Edition of that series. He is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, including the Humboldt Prize (1973), the Virginia Outstanding Scientists of the Year (2001), the Amgen Paul Dawson award in Biotechnology (2002), an honorary doctorate from the University of Parma (2005) and many others. He is also an elected Fellow of AAAS.\n\nVictor E. Marquez, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Victor E. Marquez was born in Caracas, Venezuela. He obtained a B.S. degree in Pharmacy in 1966 from Universidad Central de Venezuela and Master and Ph.D. degrees in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Michigan in 1988 and 1970, respectively, under the tutelage of Professor Joseph H. Burckhalter. His career at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) started in 1971 when he joined as Visiting Fellow in the Medicinal Chemistry Section of the Developmental Therapeutics Program. During his NIH fellowship (1971-1972), while working under the supervision of Dr. John S. Driscoll, Dr. Marquez developed a novel hydantoin template for the delivery of nitrogen mustards specifically to the CNS. This research led to the design of the active brain antitumor agent, spiromustine. Phase I evaluation of spiromustine commenced in 1987, but neurotoxicity presented as alterations in cortical integrative functions led to its eventual withdrawal from further clinical use. Dr. Marquez then returned to Venezuela for a five-year period (1972-1976) where he worked as Director of Research in Laboratorios Cosmos, S.A. in Caracas. There, he developed a new class of orally active anaphylactic inhibitor, which was patented under U.S. pat. No. 4,167,577 in 1979. In 1977, Dr. Marquez rejoined the NCI as a Visiting Scientist and was awarded tenure as a Principal Investigator in 1987 after becoming a naturalized citizen. In 1988 he became Deputy Laboratory Chief and in 2000 he was promoted to Laboratory Chief. Dr. Marquez retired as Lab Chief on September 1, 2009 and is now Scientist Emeritus at the NCI. During his career at the NCI his discoveries have helped translate elements of basic research into solutions for specific medical problems as exemplified by cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPE-C) and 9-(2’,3’-dideoxy-2’-fluoro-beta-D-threo-pentofuranosyl)adenine, the latter also known as lodenosine. These drugs entered clinical trials in the late 1990’s and early 2000 as antitumor and anti-HIV drugs, respectively. They were later suspended from further clinical use due to unexpected toxicity. Currently, North-methanocarba thymidine, a potent antiherpes drug is schedule to enter phase I clinical trials. In addition, zebularine, a DNA methylase inhibitor, and 3-deazaneplanocin A, a histone methylase inhibitor, are important candidates under study for the epigenetic treatment of cancer. Other important discoveries that have resulted from his work in the area of nucleosides and nucleotides have been based on mechanistic approaches to inhibit key enzymatic reactions. Some of the most important highlights in this area are: (1) Design and synthesis of the most potent transition-state analogue inhibitors of cytidine deaminase based on a novel 5-hydroxy-perhydro-1,3-diazepin-2-one nucleoside system; (2) synthesis of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD) and the corresponding metabolically stable phosphonate analogue (beta-methylene TAD), two of the most potent inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase; (3) synthesis and discovery of 3-deazaneplanocin A, the most potent inhibitor known against S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; (4) synthesis and discovery of cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPE-C), the most potent inhibitor known to date against cytidine triphosphate synthase; (5) design and synthesis of the first, acid-stable dideoxypurine inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase; (6) design and synthesis of conformationally locked carbocyclic nucleosides as important biological probes; (7) design and synthesis of zebularine, an orally active DNA methylase inhibitor; and (8) design and synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides containing conformationally restricted abasic sites as potent inhibitors of cytosine DNA methyltransferase. Concomitant to the work performed above, theoretical studies with conformationally locked nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing locked units have helped understand the role of sugar conformation in determining the affinity of nucleosides and nucleotides for kinases and polymerases. These studies have also set the basis for the design of delayed polymerase chain terminators effective against the scission repair mechanisms of resistant HIV reverse transcriptase. In a second line of research, Dr. Marquez developed a series of diacylglycerol mimetics, dubbed DAG-lactones that bind to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C (PKC) at nanomolar concentrations. Some DAG-lactones display isozyme selectivity for specific members of the PKC family and have shown potent antitumor activity in the NCI 60 cell line screen as well as exceptional apoptosis inducing properties. Dr. Marquez has received many awards and distinctions during his career, including the U.S. Department of Commerce Inventor’s award (1979); Medical Research Council Visiting Professorship at the Universities of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada (1984-85); NIH Merit Award (1992); Vice-chair and Chair of Gordon Research Conference on Purines, Pyrimidines and Related Compounds (1993 and 1995); National Cancer Institute, Division of Basic Sciences Intramural Research Award (1997); Pharmazie-Wissenschaftpreiss 2001 (Pharmazeutische Chemie) sponsored by Phoenix Pharmahandel AG & Co (2001); Senior Biological Research Scientist appointment (2002); Member of the Medicinal Chemistry Division Long Range Planning Committee (2003-2005); Belleau Memorial Lecturer, McGill Chemical Society, McGill University (2003); Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Program (IATAP) award (2005 and 2006); Leopoldo García-Colín-Scherer Medal, Mexico City, Mexico (2007); Symposium Honoring Victor Marquez for His Contributions to Conformational Analysis, Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Oligonucleotides, Division of Carbohydrate Chemistry, American Chemical Society, 236th National Meeting, Philadelphia, PA (2008); Elected Vice-President of the International Society for Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids (2008); Maryland Chemist of the Year (2008); and Raymond U. Lemieux Lecture On Biotechnology, University of Alberta (2009). To date, the entire portfolio of his research is contained in more than 340 publications (71 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry with over 2476 citations), 11 book chapters, and 30 patents. Dr. Marquez has received over 120 invitations as a speaker to various symposia, universities and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nKenneth A. Jacobson, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Kenneth A. Jacobson received his B.A. in Liberal Arts from Reed College in Portland, Oregon and his M.S. and Ph.D. (1981) in Chemistry with Prof. Murray Goodman at the University of California, San Diego. After completing his Postdoctoral work with Professor A. Patchornik at the Dept. of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute in Israel, he joined the National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive and Kidney Diseases at NIH in Bethesda, MD in 1983. He currently serves as Chief of the Molecular Recognition Section, which he founded in 1993, in the Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry. He began the NIDDK Chemical Biology Core Laboratory as Director in 2003.\n\nHis creativity and his ability to combine the field of chemistry with those of pharmacology and molecular biology have had a major impact on biomedical research and therapeutic development. Over the course of >three decades at NIH, Dr. Jacobson has made major contributions to the pharmacology of cell surface receptors, in particular purinergic receptors. He has studied recognition at the binding sites of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by structural modification, both from the perspective of the small molecular ligands and of their protein targets. His group began the computer modeling of adenosine receptors as a tool for interpreting site-directed mutagenesis data soon after their cloning. Early in his career he pioneered the concept of “functionalized congeners,” a now widely used approach in drug development, which has recently led to the design of multivalent conjugates of GPCR ligands using dendrimers as nanocarriers. He also introduced the concept of “neoceptors” as a strategy for re-engineering the binding site of a GPCR for activation by chemically tailored small molecules. His research has led to agents in clinical trials for cystic fibrosis, cancer, degenerative diseases, and ischemic and inflammatory conditions. Four nucleosides from the Jacobson laboratory that act as A3 adenosine receptor agonists are currently in clinical trials for psoriasis, hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma, MASH, glaucoma and stroke/TBI. Dozens of ligands used as pharmacological probes in research on adenosine receptors and P2 (nucleotide) receptors were introduced by Dr. Jacobson and colleagues. Many of these substances bear the designation “MRS” after the name of his Section.\n\nDr. Jacobson has authored or co-authored over 800 scientific publications and is an inventor on >40 issued U.S. patents. He has served the ACS Division of Medicinal Chemistry as Chair in 2004 and has planned and chaired numerous symposia at ACS National Meetings. Dr. Jacobson is or has been on the editorial advisory boards of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters, ACS Pharmacology and Translational Science, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology, Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry, Medicinal Research Reviews, and Future Medicinal Chemistry, and he is an Associate Editor ofPurinergic Signalling. He has mentored >70 postdoctoral fellows, both chemists and biologists. He received the 2003 Hillebrand Prize, the 2008 Sato International Memorial Prize from the Pharmaceutical Soc. of Japan, and the 2014 Goodman and Gilman Award from the American Soc. for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and the 2023 ACS E.B. Hershberg Award for Important Discoveries in Medicinally Active Substances.\n\nMalcolm MacCoss, Ph.D., FRSC\n\nDr. Malcolm MacCoss obtained his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Birmingham in the U.K. in 1971, working with Professors A.S. Jones and R.T. Walker and then carried out a post-doctoral fellowship and a research associateship at the University of Alberta in Canada from 1972-1976 working with Professor M.J. Robins. During those times he worked in the field of nucleoside and nucleic acid chemistry, including synthetic and hybridization studies on oligonucleotides that contained a non-ionic backbone, as well as developing novel synthetic methods in nucleoside chemistry. He then moved to the U.S.A. and took up an appointment at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois where he continued to work on nucleic acid chemistry and the solution structures of nucleic acid components by NMR spectroscopy. In particular, he studied the synthesis and solution conformation of a number of rigid nucleoside cyclic monophosphates. In 1980, also while at Argonne, he won the University of Chicago Medal for Distinguished Performance at Argonne National Laboratory (awarded to scientists under 40) for his work on novel phospholipid-nucleoside conjugates as prodrugs for anticancer agents.\n\nDr. Malcolm MacCoss began his pharma career at Merck as a Research Fellow in 1982 and he was promoted to Assistant Director, Exploratory Chemistry in 1986; to Director, Medicinal Chemical Research in 1991; to Senior Director and Head of Medicinal Chemical Research in 1993; to Executive Director, Medicinal Chemistry in 1995; and to Vice President Basic Chemistry-Rahway in 1999. In 2003, he became the Vice President of Basic Chemistry and Drug Discovery Sciences, and the Deputy Site-Head of the Rahway Site; he was also Chairman of the Merck World-Wide Chemistry Council. During his time as Head of the Merck Rahway Chemistry Department, the Department produced approximately 100 preclinical drug candidates.
