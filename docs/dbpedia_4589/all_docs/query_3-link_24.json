        "text": "Our president, Professor Dame Carol Robinson, met Professor John B Goodenough, at a celebratory event held by the UK's academy of science, the Royal Society.\n\nAs we announced on Wednesday, the 2019 chemistry Nobel was awarded to John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino, for their pioneering work in developing lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThat Professor Goodenough should be in London on the day of his long deserved Nobel recognition meant the Royal Society's annual prize giving ceremony took on an extra dimension of celebration.\n\nAt the age of 97, Professor Goodenough becomes the oldest ever recipient of a Nobel Prize, somewhat coincidentally, on the day that he received the oldest scientific prize in the world.\n\nRoyal Society Awards\n\nThe Royal Medals are one of the Royal Society’s premier awards and are made on behalf of the Queen each year. Awarded annually since 1825, this year’s recipients of the Royal Medals join the ranks of Fred Sanger, Francis Crick, and Mary Lyon.\n\nThe Royal Medals were founded by HM King George IV in 1825. Between 1826 and 1964 two medals were awarded each year. In 1965 the third medal, covering the applied sciences, was introduced on behalf of HM The Queen."
