        "text": "FDA Approves CAR T Therapy for Large B-Cell Lymphoma Developed at University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded approval for a personalized cellular therapy developed at the University of Pennsylvania’s Abramson Cancer Center, this time for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This approval includes treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)—the most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)—as well as high-grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. The approval was granted to Novartis for the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel, formerly CTL019), making it the second indication for the nation’s first personalized cellular therapy for cancer.\n\nDLBCL affects approximately 30 percent of patients with NHL, and there are an estimated 27,000 newly diagnosed cases of DLBCL in the U.S. each year. About 6,500 of those patients have relapsed or refractory disease after two or more therapies and may now be eligible for Kymriah.\n\n“This is an exciting event—seeing this lifesaving therapy become available widely to a large patient population with an unmet medical need,” said Stephen J. Schuster, the Robert and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus Professor in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Lymphoma Clinical Care and Research and director of the Lymphoma Program at Penn’s Abramson Cancer Center. “Many lives may be saved.”\n\nIn August 2017, Kymriah became the first therapy based on gene transfer ever approved by the FDA when it was authorized for children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The FDA’s action is the latest accomplishment in the alliance between Penn and Novartis, which entered into a global collaboration in 2012 to further research, develop and commercialize Kymriah and other CAR T-cell therapies for the treatment of cancers.\n\nInvestigators at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine who led research, development and clinical trials of CAR T therapy, in collaboration with Novartis, called this approval a massive step with potentially life-saving implications for patients.\n\nDr. Schuster led two studies examining CAR T therapy in DLBCL, including research published in the New England Journal of Medicine detailing long-term follow-up of the first cohort of these patients treated with the therapy at Penn and the global, multi-center, Novartis-sponsored trial known as JULIET. At the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, the data presented from the JULIET trial showed an overall response of 53 percent, with 40 percent of patients achieving a complete response, among the 81 infused patients with three or more months of follow-up or earlier discontinuation. At six-month analysis, the median duration of response was not reached.\n\n“We’re proud to have developed this therapy through all phases of development and clinical trials right here at Penn and in collaboration with Novartis,” said Carl June, the Richard W. Vague Professor in Immunotherapy in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine in the Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies in the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nKymriah will be available through a network of certified treatment centers throughout the United States, including the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe treatment modifies patients’ own immune T cells, which are collected and reprogrammed at the Novartis manufacturing facility to potentially seek and destroy the patients’ lymphoma cells. Once they are infused back into patients’ bodies, these newly built cells both multiply and attack, targeting cells that express a protein called CD19. Tests reveal the army of hunter cells can grow to more than 10,000 new cells for each single engineered cell patients receive—producing durable remission rates in refractory lymphoma—and can survive in the body for years.\n\n“Our collaboration with Penn has delivered Kymriah, a transformational therapy and first CAR T to be approved, initially for pediatric and young adult patients with ALL and today for adult patients with DLBCL,” said Liz Barrett, CEO, Novartis Oncology. “We are grateful to Penn for their leadership and to the courageous patients who participated in the clinical trials that have advanced Kymriah to be one of the most exciting technologies ever developed to fight cancer.”\n\nKymriah was first tested at Penn in 2010 in adult patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The first DLBCL trial, including double hit lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, opened at Penn in February 2014.\n\nMany patients in the DLBCL trials experienced a side effect called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a toxicity associated with CAR T therapy, which includes varying degrees of flu-like symptoms, with fevers, nausea and muscle pain, and can require ICU-level care. According to the data presented at ASH, 58 percent of patients in the DLBCL global study experienced CRS, including some who experienced moderate or severe toxicities. Twenty-one of those patients (26 percent) required treatment with tocilizumab, a therapy approved for CAR T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS, or corticosteroids. All of those patients recovered from their CRS. Other toxicities included infections (34 percent of patients), cytopenias or low blood count (36 percent), neurologic events (21 percent), febrile neutropenia (13 percent), and a metabolic abnormality called tumor lysis syndrome (one percent). All of the toxicities resolved on their own or with treatment, and there were no treatment-related deaths.\n\nNovartis will create a registry to follow patients for 15 years after being treated to monitor their progress and any potential, future side effects.\n\nThe Novartis-Penn Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics (CACT) opened in 2016 and hosted Vice President Joe Biden at the launch of his Cancer Moonshot initiative, cementing Penn’s role as international innovator in the development and manufacturing of personalized cellular therapies.\n\nAdditional leaders of the DLBCL research include Jakub Svoboda, an assistant professor of hematology oncology, Daniel J Landsburg, an assistant professor of hematology oncology, and Sunita D. Nasta, an associate professor of hematology oncology.\n\nBoth of Dr. Schuster’s studies were supported by Novartis. The single-site trial was also supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA165206), as well as through philanthropic support for the Lymphoma Program at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania from James and Frances Maguire and the Frances Maguire Lymphoma Research Fund, Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and Sharyn Berman and the Richard Berman Family Funds for CLL and Lymphomas.\n\nPatients who are interested in T-cell therapies at Penn Medicine can call (215) 316-5127 for more information.\n\nConstantia Constantinou: Vice Provost and Director of Penn Libraries\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Provost Wendell Pritchett recently announced the appointment of Constantia Constantinou as the H. Carton Rogers III Vice Provost and Director of the Penn Libraries, effective August 1.\n\nMs. Constantinou will replace Mr. Rogers, who has led the Penn Libraries since 2004 and is retiring after a 43-year career at Penn.\n\n“Constantia is a global leader in integrating the work of a large university library system with the wider academic mission of a university,” Provost Pritchett said. “In particular, she has been a pioneer throughout her career in developing digital, multimedia and technology initiatives in large university library systems and in advancing partnerships among libraries, museums and universities.”\n\nFor the past five years, Ms. Constantinou has been Dean of University Libraries at Stony Brook University of The State University of New York (SUNY), as well as a SUNY Distinguished Librarian. She was the Director of the Stephen B. Luce Library at SUNY-Maritime College the previous 12 years.\n\nShe created an ambitious strategic plan for the Stony Brook Libraries, redefining the libraries as a hub of collaboration in scholarly and digital initiatives and working with students, faculty, researchers and staff across the university, especially in developing the digital humanities, open access and a Center for Scholarly Communication.\n\nMs. Constantinou began her career at New York University’s Elmer Holmes Bobst Library and has brought her focus on digital and multimedia technology to leadership positions at the City University of New York, at Rutgers University Libraries, and as Director of the Helen T. Arrigoni Technology Library at Iona College.\n\nTwice named a Fulbright Scholar, she is an active member of the global university library community, publishing articles and reviews, delivering conference presentations around the world, and serving in leadership positions for the Association of Research Libraries, Online Computer Library Catalogue, and International Federation of Library Associations, among others.\n\nIn addition, she is an accomplished classical guitarist who studied at the Royal School of Music in London before earning a bachelor’s degree in music and a master’s degree in music theory from Queens College of the City University of New York, where she also earned her master’s of library science degree.\n\n“I am confident that Constantia will bring tremendous energy and vision to her work at the Penn Libraries, building on Carton’s legacy and collaborating with the many wonderful partners that she will meet across our university,” Provost Pritchett said. “I am grateful to the Board of Overseers, who has recognized Carton’s tenure with a generous gift that names the Directorship in his honor, and to the members of the ad hoc consultative committee who helped us arrive at this outstanding result.”\n\nPenn Dental Medicine 2018 Teaching Awards\n\nPenn Dental Medicine faculty/staff members were honored for excellence in teaching by the School’s graduating class of DMD students with the 2018 teaching awards. Each year, these awards are presented by students as part of Senior Farewell, an annual event that celebrates the passage of students to professional dentistry and welcomes them into the Penn Dental Medicine Alumni Society. This year’s event was held May 8 at The Bellevue in Center City Philadelphia. The awards and recipients included the following:\n\nBasic Science Award\n\nThe Basic Science Award is presented for excellence in teaching within the basic sciences. This year’s recipient is Mel Mupparapu (D’96), professor of oral medicine and director of radiology. Dr. Mupparapu has been part of the School’s faculty for 13 years, presently teaching radiology and oral medicine in nine courses, including three for which he serves as course director. In addition, Dr. Mupparapu also directs the radiology honors program and the radiology fellowship program. In selecting the recipient of this award, the students noted, “The basic sciences are the cornerstone of our dental education and our teachers have fostered in us an appreciation of how clinical practice is continually advanced by the discoveries made at the bench.”\n\nRobert E. DeRevere Award\n\nThe Robert E. DeRevere Award is presented for excellence in preclinical teaching by a part-time faculty member.

The 3401 Walnut Data Center, which houses a number of critical University applications and services, will be taken off-line for activities associated with the migration and decommissioning of the facility. It is expected that the full 48-hour maintenance window will be necessary: August 4, 12 a.m. through August 5, 11:59 p.m.\n\nDuring this 48-hour maintenance window, please note:\n\nClients potentially impacted by the outage will be contacted by the appropriate ISC service owner. The availability during the outage of a number of important and widely used applications and services will be posted at https://www.isc.upenn.edu/alerts-outages/planned-3401-walnut-data-center-outage-842018-852018 This list will be updated as we approach the outage date.\n\nApplications and services that will be taken off-line or that may experience brief disruptions will be dependent on their migration status. Clients should contact the appropriate ISC service owner for the migration status of their applications housed at 3401.\n\nOnline mainframe applications and services that will not be available during the outage are: Payroll, Salary Management (SALMGMT), Student Financial Subsystems (SFSEASI), Student Aid Management (SAM, SAMS), Student Records System (SRS), Table and Data Dictionary (TADD). This is not a definitive list. Additional applications may be unavailable as we approach the outage date.\n\nAll regularly scheduled production batch jobs and sequences will be held during this time.\n\nPlanned outages are required for maintenance of the technology infrastructure that supports University systems. Postponing these activities is not an option, as it carries the risk of an unplanned disruption that would require extensive emergency recovery time and could have severe consequences for service availability. While there is never a perfect time for the data center to be off-line, we have scheduled all outages for weekends and on dates that are the least disruptive to significant campus events in the University’s calendars.\n\nAs in similar outages, we ask that you do not schedule system-dependent events during this time.\n\nISC will hold two information sessions for the August outage. Look for details about the sessions, including registration, at https://www.isc.upenn.edu/alerts-outages/planned-3401-walnut-data-center-outage-842018-852018\n\nFor questions, contact your regular application support resource or Local Support Provider (LSP). If you don’t know who your LSP is, see https://www.isc.upenn.edu/get-it-help\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to improve ISC services at Penn.\n\n—Tom Murphy, Vice President of Information Technology & University Chief Information Officer, Information Systems & Computing\n\nPenn Association of Senior and Emeritus Faculty (PASEF) 2017–2018 Annual Report\n\nOverview\n\nPASEF’s members are senior (age 55 and over) and retired standing faculty at Penn. Its mission is to organize programs and activities for its members and encourage them to continue to remain active in the intellectual and social life of the University and to provide service to the University and the community. A major function of PASEF is to assist senior faculty in their transition to retirement by providing retirement planning seminars and information.\n\nPASEF was founded in 2004, and its current membership numbers approximately 900 senior faculty and 600 retired faculty. The Association of Senior and Emeritus Faculty (ASEF–PSOM) is an analogous organization for faculty at the Perelman School of Medicine. The two organizations each have their own Council, but they regularly cooperate in planning joint programs and activities, most recently through a newly established joint Program Committee.\n\nPASEF is a member organization of AROHE, the Association of Retirement Organizations in Higher Education.\n\nAdministration\n\nGovernance and administration. PASEF operates under a set of bylaws and is governed by a Council which meets monthly during the academic year. The President, President-Elect, and Past President form the Steering Committee (Council members for 2017-2018 are listed in Appendix A).\n\nPASEF receives an annual budget from the Provost and reports to Vice Provost for Faculty Anita Allen, who has been especially supportive. During the past year, excellent assistance has been provided by members of the Provost’s staff, including Jillian Powell, Julie Shuttleworth, and Kathy Swartz. We are also participating with the staff of the Provost’s Office on the redesign of our PASEF website.\n\nFacilities. PASEF has an office in Duhring Wing, next to the office of the Faculty Senate. Staff support is provided by a half-time employee, the PASEF Coordinator, Sarah Barr. Through the efforts of Vice Provost Allen, PASEF has acquired a room adjacent to its current office which is now fully furnished and operational. Both the current office and the new space can accommodate meetings of small groups.\n\nPASEF’s website is www.upenn.edu/emeritus\n\nRetirement\n\nPASEF and ASEF–PSOM provide resources and give presentations to aid senior faculty in planning their transition to retirement. During the past year four informational events were held, also receptions to recognize newly emeritus faculty.\n\nReception for newly emeritus faculty. Recently between 50 and 60 standing faculty have taken emeritus status each year, and PASEF and ASEF–PSOM have co-sponsored a reception in the Fall to honor the retirees.\n\nThis past year’s event in October 2017 was held at the Sweeten Center with Vice Provost Allen as the featured speaker. Attendance at the event was surprisingly low, due in large part to the fact that many AY 2017 retirees had already relocated. After discussions by both PASEF and ASEF Councils, a joint decision was made to shift the ceremony to the end of the spring semester 2018, initially as an experiment. Thus, a second retirement reception (with honorees’ photographs continually displayed on a large screen, and, again, with Vice Provost Allen as featured speaker) was held on May 16, 2018 (with much greater participation). If, as seems likely in view of the response to the spring ceremony, this scheduling turns out to be more popular, then the annual retirement reception for that year’s retirees will henceforth be held each May. The PASEF Council decided at its May 2018 meeting not to hold a retirees event in the fall.\n\nRoad to Retirement programs and Hitchhiker’s Guide. Each spring PASEF presents two Road to Retirement information programs and, with ASEF–PSOM, partners with Human Resources for a third presentation.\n\nIn March, a panel of senior and retired faculty spoke in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library about their retirement decisions and experiences in emeritus status. The session included a presentation on continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). PASEF proposes to hold a separate panel discussion on CCRCs in fall 2018.\n\nIn April, Hilary Lopez and Vicki Mulhern, University staff experts on retirement, discussed retirement options and the details of retiree benefits. Some 53 potential retirees attended the event (in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library), and many general and specific questions were addressed.\n\nRepresentatives from Social Security and Medicare spoke in May at the event organized by Human Resources.\n\nIn January 2018 PASEF published the eleventh edition of its Hitchhiker’s Guide to Faculty Retirement under the able editorship of Martin Pring. Sections on financial planning for retirement, transition to emeritus status and retiree relations with the University are included, and the publication is available on the PASEF and ASEF–PSOM websites.\n\nActivities and Events\n\nMonthly lectures. PASEF sponsors lectures throughout the academic year. These are open to all members of the University community and span a wide range of topics of general interest. ASEF-PSOM also sponsors monthly lectures and two special lectures in fall and spring. This year PASEF’s Program Committee was jointly chaired by Paul Shaman and Jerry Porter. Further, a joint Program Committee for ASEF-PSOM and PASEF has also been established this year to coordinate the timing of joint events and lectures.\n\nThe PASEF Program Committee arranges eight monthly lectures and a featured lecture each semester. The Fall Lecture, given each year in October in conjunction with the 25-Year Club Dinner, was presented by Jane Golden, Director of Mural Arts Philadelphia (entitled “Public Art and Social Change”), and the Spring Lecture speaker was Kathleen Jamieson of the Annenberg School (How Russian Hackers and Trolls Exploited U.S. Media In 2016). In addition, the Library Committee (headed by Vivian Seltzer) arranged four lectures on a variety of topics.\n\nLinks to video recordings of some of the lectures are available on the PASEF website.\n\nOutings. PASEF and ASEF-PSOM together organize two outings a year, one in the fall (organized by ASEF-PSOM), and another in the spring (organized by PASEF). In fall 2017 we visited the Hagley Museum in Wilmington, and in April there was a visit to the Michener Museum in Doylestown, where a guided tour took us through a special exhibit of works of the Wyeth family.\n\nMembership initiatives. The Membership Committee, chaired by Anita Summers, presented several recommendations, which were approved by the Council. These include organization of special events such as attendance at concerts, which has been extremely popular and successful; reserving a table at the University Club where members can meet for lunch and conversation on a regular schedule, which has not, thus far, attracted a sufficient clientele; a second annual cultural outing in the fall (yet to be implemented); and additional planning for retirement presentations, including a special session devoted to CCRCs (the first of which is planned for fall 2018).\n\nCommunity Involvement. Following up on an enthusiastic presentation by members of the Council concerning community involvement initiatives at the final meeting of the PASEF Council in May 2017, Ira Harkavy, the Director of Penn’s Netter Center, was invited to attend the PASEF Council’s September 2017 meeting. Members of the ASEF-PSOM Council also attended.\n\nHe described to us the various community-based initiatives in which the Center and members of the Penn faculty are currently involved. As a result of that meeting and the discussions that followed, a PASEF ad-hoc committee on community involvement, chaired by Joan Goodman, was established. The committee made regular presentations to subsequent PASEF Council meetings during the year, including results from its survey of member interest. In March 2018 it was proposed and accepted that the ad-hoc committee should become a standing committee, requiring a change to the PASEF by-laws. A resolution to that effect was passed at the May 2018 meeting.\n\nSpeakers Bureau. With encouragement and funding from Vice Provost Allen, PASEF launched its Speakers Bureau in the spring of 2016. This work was spearheaded by Jack Nagel as initial chair of the Speakers Bureau Committee; Roger Allen has since taken over as coordinator of the bureau’s activities. The Bureau enables community groups, including retirement communities, civic and religious organizations and high schools, to identify and invite PASEF members to speak to audiences in the Philadelphia area. The current roster of speakers numbers 25 and includes both senior and retired Penn faculty from Schools across the University. Information about the Bureau and the speakers and their topics is available on the PASEF website at www.upenn.edu/emeritus\n\nFaculty Senate and University Council\n\nFor the last 10 years, PASEF has sent a non-voting representative to the Senate Executive Committee (SEC). After discussions last year, the Senate leadership granted PASEF non-voting membership on four Senate Committees, starting in 2016–2017. The committees are the Senate Committee on Faculty and the Administration; the Senate Committee on Faculty and the Academic Mission; the Senate Committee on Students and Educational Policy; and the Senate Committee on Faculty Development, Diversity, and Equity. PASEF also has a member on the University Council’s Committee on Personnel Benefits.\n\nPASEF Annual Election\n\nGino Segrè chaired the AY2017-2018 PASEF Nominating Committee. The Committee’s proposed slate was approved by email voting following the March Council meeting.\n\nJames Ferguson was elected President-Elect, Paul Shaman Secretary, and Martin Pring the SEC Representative. New at-large Council members who will serve three-year terms are Marc Dichter, Joretha Bourjolly and Jorge Santiago-Avriles.\n\n—Roger Allen, PASEF President (2017–2018)\n\nAppendix A: PASEF Council Members, 2017-2018\n\nRoger M.A. Allen, Professor Emeritus, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (SAS).

T cell exhaustion can arise during chronic infections and cancer; it prevents optimal control of infections and tumors. Durable reprogramming of exhausted T cells is a fundamental goal of cancer researchers.\n\nPenn Law Students: Williams Institute Moot Court Winners\n\nPenn Law students Jesse McGleughlin, L’20, Ian Wahrenbrock, L’19, and Andrew Wilson, L’19, won the Williams Institute Moot Court Competition held in Los Angeles on April 13. The Williams Institute Moot Court Competition at UCLA School of Law is the only moot court in the country focusing on legal issues facing the LGBT community. This was the first win for Penn Law at this competition.\n\nAfter participating in several earlier rounds, the Penn Law team and a team of Yale Law students competed in the final round, in which they argued a case about a transgender high school student seeking to use restroom facilities in accordance with her gender identity, against the backdrop of the shift in federal policy from the U.S. Department of Education. The Penn Law finalists advocated for the transgender student.\n\nStatus, Not Economic Hardship, Drove Voters in 2016\n\nNew evidence published in April in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences supports the idea that many Trump voters are feeling left behind, but not for reasons related to personal financial problems or economic anxiety about the future.\n\nBased on survey data from a nationally representative panel of the same 1,200 American voters polled in both 2012 and 2016, Penn professor Diana C. Mutz found that traditionally high-status Americans, namely whites, feel their status in America and the world is threatened by America’s growing racial diversity and a perceived loss of U.S. global dominance. Under threat by these engines of change, America’s socially dominant groups increased their support in 2016 for the candidate who most emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past.\n\nDr. Mutz, the Samuel A. Stouffer Professor of Political Science and Communication and Director of the Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics, followed voters over a four-year period to assess their changing views of trade, the threat posed by China, their sense of group threat, and perceptions of their own personal finances, as well as experiences of unemployment and the economic conditions in their local communities.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric during the 2016 election capitalized on the fears of Americans who currently enjoy dominant status in society, most notably those who were white, Christian, male, or some combination of the three. Many of those Americans, Dr. Mutz found, switched from voting for the Democrat in 2012 to the Republican in 2016. Particularly those who found societal changes threatening voted for Trump in an effort to maintain their perceived social dominance in the country and the world.\n\nDespite exhaustive data analysis, the study did not show any relationship between financial hardship and voting for Trump. Meanwhile, lack of a college education was noted as a strong predictor of support for Trump. Education, Dr. Mutz explains, is also the strongest predictor of support for international trade. Negative attitudes toward racial and ethnic diversity, she points out, are also correlated with low levels of education.\n\n“Elected officials who embrace the ‘left behind’ narrative may feel compelled to pursue policies that will do little to assuage fears of less educated Americans,” Dr. Mutz writes. In other words, addressing economic anxieties may not be the path to winning future elections.\n\n“The 2016 election was a result of anxiety about dominant groups’ future status rather than a result of being overlooked in the past,” she writes. “Given current demographic trends within the United States, minority influence will only increase with time, thus heightening this source of perceived status threat.”\n\nHow to Stop Teens from Texting While Driving\n\nTeens who admit to texting while driving may be convinced to reduce risky cellphone use behind the wheel when presented with financial incentives, according to a new survey conducted by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine and CHOP. The researchers asked students to consider strategies or factors that would help them refrain from texting while operating a vehicle, especially measures that could be implemented through technology-assisted controls or incentives.\n\nThe vast majority of the teens indicated that they were “willing” or “somewhat willing” to give up reading emails (99 percent), social media apps (99 percent), sending texts (96 percent), reading texts (91 percent), and making or receiving non-hands-free calls (94 and 91 percent, respectively) while driving. Far fewer of them were willing or somewhat willing to give up music apps (55 percent) or navigation apps (40 percent).\n\nThe researchers asked participants to consider several possible factors or strategies that could discourage them from texting while driving, such as an annual insurance premium discount, or a cash reward for every week in which they don’t text and drive. Most of the teens indicated that financial incentives would be “very effective,” but many (54 percent) also indicated that automatic phone locking while driving would work.\n\n“More than half of teens in the United States admit to texting while driving, and this has become a significant public health issue leading to preventable deaths and disabling injuries,” said study lead author M. Kit Delgado, Penn assistant professor of emergency medicine. “Our study suggests a promising strategy to curb this epidemic would include enabling a phone setting or third party app with automatic responses to incoming texts, but with navigation and music functions accessible, combined with financial incentives to sustain use.”\n\nWhen asked why they wouldn’t want to use cellphone apps that monitor driving behavior, the survey participants cited an aversion to letting parents monitor their behavior as their top reason. A modest financial incentive may be enough to outweigh such concerns, Dr. Delgado said, though he noted “we need a better understanding of how to design interventions that optimally balance parental engagement and acceptance by teens.”\n\nGun Violence in Movies\n\nA new study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center reveals how parents determine what makes intense gun violence in PG-13 movies acceptable for teens. The lead author was Daniel Romer, research director of the APPC. The authors of the study also included Kathleen Hall Jamieson, APPC director; Patrick E. Jamieson, director of APPC’s Adolescent Health and Risk Communication Institute; Azeez Adebimpe, an APPC postdoc fellow; and Robert Lull, a former APPC postdoc fellow at California State University, Fresno.\n\nThe study, “Parental Desensitization to Gun Violence in PG-13 Movies,” was published online in the journal Pediatrics on May 14 and will be in the June issue. It measured responses of 610 parents in the United States to scenes of gun violence in popular PG-13 movies to determine how upsetting they were to watch and at what age parents would consider it appropriate for teens to view those scenes.\n\nPrevious research suggested that parents were growing emotionally desensitized to violence on film in response to the increase in gun violence, especially in PG-13 films.\n\nThe study found that parents were not emotionally desensitized to gun violence but were far more willing to expose their teens to such scenes if they found the violence to be “justified.” Violence that is perpetrated in self-defense or to protect loved ones was considered less upsetting and more appropriate for teens than unjustified violence. Nevertheless, most parents thought that even justified gun violence was more appropriate for children starting at age 15 rather than 13, as the PG-13 rating category suggests.\n\nSince 1984, when the PG-13 rating was introduced, scenes of gun violence have doubled in movies. The rating was introduced as a way to warn parents about emotionally upsetting content for younger viewers. A PG-13 rating from the MPAA’s Classification and Ratings Administration (CARA) currently means that parents are strongly cautioned as some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\nThe result of this most recent study suggests that parents would favor a new rating, PG-15, that would more accurately warn of the violent content in some movies.\n\nGold Nanorods Measure Squishiness at the Nanoscale\n\nRheology is the science of studying how soft materials and complex fluids deform and flow under stress. These materials are everywhere in biology, and since their relative stiffness or squishiness is relevant to diseases, such as cancer, there is a need to accurately measure just how squishy they are.\n\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science have made advances in the field of “microrheology,” developing a microscopy system able to make such measurements at previously impossible length scales.\n\nBy embedding cigar-shaped gold nanorods in the material to be studied and observing them with a stereoscopic, laser-based microscope, the researchers are able to make measurements on the order of 100 nanometers or smaller. This is small enough for the researchers’ microrheology technique to be used on the membranes of cancer cells.\n\nThey plan to apply this technique to ongoing research at Penn’s Physical Sciences Oncology Center (PSOC), which aims to connect the stiffening of liver cells in cirrhosis to the progression of liver cancer.\n\nThe researchers, John C. Crocker, professor in Penn Engineering’s department of chemical and biomolecular engineering, along with lab members Mehdi Molaei and Ehsan Atefi, published a study detailing this system in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n“Our technique provides a unique way of probing the fluctuations and rheology of soft materials at the nanoscale for the first time,” Dr. Crocker said. “This has the potential to revolutionize experiments in soft matter and interfacial science, and provides experimental verification of dynamics that could only previously be observed in computer simulations.”\n\nThe researchers tested their technique on a model polymer with well-understood rheological properties, using a laser-illuminated dark-field microscope with two different polarizations to track the nanorods. Somewhat like a 3D movie, contrasting the data from the two polarizations allowed the researchers to calculate the rods’ orientation in space.\n\n“The result turns out to be orders of magnitude superior to previous methods in several important metrics, including working on volumes of goo as small as an attoliter, or a quadrillionth of a milliliter,” Dr. Crocker said. “Still, the rods are way smaller than what can actually be resolved in an optical microscope; thousands could fit inside a single E. Coli. We had to solve a lot of optics calculations in order to quantitatively convert optical polarization to orientation.”\n\nNew research in collaboration with PSOC Director Dennis Discher, Robert D. Bent Professor of Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering, is already underway. Dr. Molaei is measuring the stiffness of liver cell membranes in vitro."
