        "text": "The Royal Society today announced a slew of medal and award winners. I wrote previously about the curious history of the Society’s oldest prize medal, awarded earlier this year, but today press focus is on their next most prestigious, the Royal Medals. While the illustrious list of past winners may be recalled, few recognise the medals’ origin in a period of concern for British science and sustained attack on the Society.\n\nAs the Society’s website tells us, the Royal Medals were founded by George IV in 1825, to be offered annually for the two “most important contributions to the advancement of Natural Knowledge” in the physical and biological sciences. In the 20th century a third medal was added, for applied sciences. A full list of winners – boasting names like Dalton, Davy, Herschel, Faraday, Darwin, Crookes, Eddington, Dirac and Perutz – can be found here.\n\nThe story of the Royal Medals is, however, only understood in the context of early 19th-century concern that British science was in “decline”, at least relative to its apparent advance in France and Germany. Such claims are hard to quantify, but it was clear that the laissez faire British state had been less active in supporting scientific research and recognising its practitioners. The criticisms of Declinists like John Playfair, Henry Brougham, David Brewster and Charles Babbage, were, partly if not entirely, a call for positions, patronage and prizes.\n\nThere was some sympathy to their cause within the British government, particularly from Robert Peel. As Prime Minister (1834-35 and 1841-46) he ensured a few men of science were recognised with civil list pensions and knighthoods, but as Home Secretary (1822-27 and 1828-30) he responded to the Declinists’ agitation by suggesting to George IV that he found a medal for “scientific work of exceptional merit”, done in Britain, if not by Britons.\n\nBabbage called it “a most unexpected occurrence” but Peel wisely persuaded George that such a move would ensure that the Society – a Royal foundation – retained its significance relative to Continental academies. George even saw fit to increase the proposed value of the medals from 20 to 50 guineas (far outweighing, literally, the older Copley Medal, which contained around £5 of gold).\n\nPleased though the reformers were by the medals’ foundation, there was immediate controversy about the way they were managed and awarded. The Royal Society’s first awards broke their own rule that the work should have been communicated within the previous year and Babbage criticised them bitterly for undoing any potential positive effect by shifting rules behind doors. Rather than inspiring today’s young researchers (like the 35-year-old Babbage) they appeared to be rewarding old, if worthy, work and friends.\n\nThis was not, of course, to be the last criticism, whether from disappointed researchers or those concerned more broadly for the reform of the Society (and society). No medals were awarded in 1831 and 1832, as attacks mounted, and they were effectively relaunched in 1833 with appointed prize committees and an intended three-year rotation around six subjects (astronomy, physiology, geology, physics, mathematics and chemistry), promoted by issuing prize questions. Yet this policy was quickly abandoned, giving largely free reign to a small number of influential committeemen.\n\nThe hope of the Declinists was that rewards such as pensions and medals would excite a competitive spirit among researchers and stop the apparent slippage of British scientific reputation. Any appearance of opaque practices could work against this but, even if scrupulously fair, the scheme did nothing to address the crucial issue of funding. Only gentlemen, or those employed and with sufficient funds and leisure to pursue research in their own time, need apply. The much-revered John Herschel, independently wealthy and hardly in need of encouragement, was awarded the medal no less than three times.\n\nA further threat appeared with the ruling that the Royal Medals would only be awarded for papers published in the Society’s journal, Philosophical Transactions. According to George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, this meant the medals were viewed “with contempt”. The medals’ purpose – raising the esteem of the Society and encouraging “competition with the world” – entirely failed, becoming merely inward looking. Herschel suggested that one of the medals should always be awarded to someone outside the Society but, in fact, the vast majority in the scheme’s first century went to Fellows or Foreign Members, often of long standing.\n\nMuch has changed in the way science is supported, in the Royal Society’s workings and in the internationalism of both since then. The Royal Medals, however, remain largely about British science, the Society’s Fellowship, senior researchers and work done over many years. As to whether such awards offer an inducement and/or an important means of recognising individuals and their work, I leave to commenters to debate."
