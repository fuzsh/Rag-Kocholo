        "text": "The Royal Medals were established by King George IV and then continued, with certain changes to their conditions, by King William IV and Queen Victoria.\n\nOriginally they were awarded for the most important discoveries in the previous year. The time period was changed to five years then shortened to three years. When Victoria came to the throne in 1837 the conditions for the Royal Medals changed to operate on a three year cycle with Mathematics being one of the subjects for which a Medal could be awarded every third year.\n\nIn 1850, however, the conditions were changed again as follows:-\n\n... the Royal Medals in each year should be awarded for the two most important contributions to the advancement of Natural Knowledge, published originally in Her Majesty's dominions within a period of not more than ten years and not less than one year of the date of the award, subject, of course, to Her Majesty's approval. ... in the award of the Royal Medals, one should be given in each of the two great divisions of Natural Knowledge.\n\nThe list of Royal Medal winners is long, and most, of course, are not mathematicians.
