        "text": "Floating Gate Neural Network Memory Cells My research in the early 1990s appears to have become relevant again!! I got my Ph.D. many years ago and, aside from teaching as an adjunct, I have worked in industry ever since. I recently have gone back to doing research part time with university colleagues (in the brain science area) and they eventually asked what I did for my Ph.D. research. I mentioned that I did work on floating gate memories for analog neural networks but never continued work in that area post-graduation. My hope was to create a true analog neural network with floating gates. Since most of the “flash” memory technologies used proprietary processes, I thought that if it could be done with a standard process it might jump start university research in that area. At the time of my work in the late 80s and 90s there was a spark of interest in neural networks. I felt it would be important to have small memory cells to support analog neural network chips. (If I were to continue in academics, my next step was to create a method of programming so that the analog memory could be considered a “standard cell” for others to used in integrated neural networks.) It seems like the interest in neural networks slowly died, basically because there was not enough compute power to implement real time networks that could do useful things. Here we are now in the 2020s with Nvidia chips and now the same sort of work has been re-branded as Machine Learning (presumably to avoid the negative connotation that Neural Networks developed years ago??) My research colleagues informed me of a contemporary researcher that has been working in the area of floating gates. I’m excited that it is making my efforts back then be relevant again. (I had feared they would have been ignored forever.) Here is a paper I wrote with my advisor (unfortunately it is copyrighted by the IEEE so I can’t post it). Durfee, D.A., and F.S. Shoucair. “Comparison of Floating Gate Neural Network Memory Cells in Standard VLSI CMOS Technology.” IEEE transactions on neural networks 3.3 (1992): 347–353. Web. The person who has given new life to this work is Dr. Jennifer Hasler <jennifer.hasler@ece.gatech.edu> https://lnkd.in/dGv9wRDh David Durfee ddurfee@baycomp.com\n\nWe would like to advertise a new innovation related to EUSIPCO-2023 and related video presentations. Esa Ollila together with his colleagues Nora O., Sergio Cruces, and Filip Elvander are organizing two special issues (SI) in ScienceTalks journal published by Elsevier: 1. 31st European Signal Processing Conference - 3 Minutes Thesis (3MT) contest collection (Submission Due Date: 15 February 2024) This video collection in Science Talks aims at archiving the presentations of the event, while making them citable with a permanent DOI. All participants to 3MT thesis competition are invited participate to this call. 2. EUSIPCO 2023 – selected video-articles in Signal Processing (Submission Due Date: 31 January 2024) This special issue brings together presentations from EUSIPCO-2023 into a video collection with a permanent DOI. All authors with accepted papers in EUSIPCO-2023 are invited participate to this call. More details about both special issues are given at the call: https://lnkd.in/dKTvniHF We hope to see many of you (authors, 3MT presenters) participating to this call! #Sciencetalks #eurasip #eusipco #elsevier #signalprocessing\n\nWe may end up reverting back to a Republic of Letters until we can get the growing mess of science under control. Expanding problems with peer review, increasing incentivization towards fraud, and amplification of these issues with genAI have created a perfect storm of challenge to the academic-publishing complex and the very foundation of what we \"know\" as a society. Because biomedical science has such a long tail (i.e. decades) of refinement and implementation - the infection will spread with little signal until we find ourselves training the next generation of clinicians with fabricated snake oil recipes and homogenized nonsense. Given the discussions I have been privy to as an journal editor and a uniquely positioned scientist-technologist, I can safely say that this article understates the level of the risk and immediacy of the problem. Without a better system of governance for science, we will be allowing the spread of an infection of bad information that already will take decades and billions, maybe trillions, to clean up. AI as a tool properly built and applied might be able to help, but the present applications are accelerating some long existing problems with science. #science #knowledge #epistemology #republicofletters Heather Leigh Flannery Amicia D.
