        "text": "Facts and Events\n\nName Emeric of Hungary Gender Male Birth[1] Alt Birth Of, Esztergom, Komarom-Esztergom, Hungary Marriage to Constance of Aragon Death[1] Reference Number Q86953?\n\nthe text in this section is copied from an article in Wikipedia\n\nEmeric, also known as Henry or Imre (, ; 117430 November 1204), was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1196 and 1204. In 1184, his father, Béla III of Hungary, ordered that he be crowned king, and appointed him as ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia around 1195. Emeric ascended the throne after the death of his father. During the first four years of his reign, he fought his rebellious brother, Andrew, who forced Emeric to make him ruler of Croatia and Dalmatia as appanage.\n\nEmeric cooperated with the Holy See against the Bosnian Church, which the Catholic Church considered to be heretics. Taking advantage of a civil war, Emeric expanded his suzerainty over Serbia. He failed to prevent the Republic of Venice, which was assisted by crusaders of the Fourth Crusade, from seizing Zadar in 1202. He also could not impede the rise of Bulgaria along the southern frontiers of his kingdom. Emeric was the first Hungarian monarch to use the \"Árpád stripes\" as his personal coat of arms and to adopt the title of King of Serbia. Before his death, Emeric had his four-year-old son, Ladislaus III, crowned king.\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia. The original content was at Emeric of Hungary.
