        "text": "Under the English common law doctrine of jure uxoris, the property and titles belonging to a woman became her husband’s upon marriage, and it was feared that any man she married would thereby become King of England in fact and name.\n\nBecause of this common law, and with Mary being England’s first Queen Regnant of England, it was necessary for Parliament to pass an Act for her marriage to Infante Felipe to establish the legal parameters of their union.\n\nWhile Mary’s grandparents King Fernando II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile had retained sovereignty of their respective realms during their marriage, there was no precedent to follow in England.\n\nUnder the terms of Queen Mary’s Marriage Act, Infante Felipe was to be styled “King of England”, all official documents (including Acts of Parliament) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for Mary’s lifetime only.\n\nThis made Infante Felipe more than a King Consort of England but not a full King Regnant of England either. They were co-sovereigns as apposed to joint-sovereigns as King William III and Queen Mary II would be in the future.\n\nUnder the Act England would not be obliged to provide military support to Felipe’s father in any war, and Felipe could not act without his wife’s consent or appoint foreigners to office in England. Infante Feilpe was unhappy with these conditions but ready to agree for the sake of securing the marriage.\n\nInfante Felipe had no amorous feelings for Mary and sought the marriage for its political and strategic gains; his aide Ruy Gómez de Silva wrote to a correspondent in Brussels, “the marriage was concluded for no fleshly consideration, but in order to remedy the disorders of this kingdom and to preserve the Low Countries.”\n\nTo elevate his son to Queen Mary’s rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Felipe the Crown of Naples as well as his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Queen Mary thus became Queen of Naples and titular Queen of Jerusalem along with becoming both an Infanta of Spain and an Archduchess of Austria, upon marriage.\n\nTheir wedding at Winchester Cathedral on July 25, 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Infante Felipe could not speak English, and so they spoke a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.\n\nThe marriage was unpopular with the English; Lord Chancellor Gardiner and his allies opposed it on the basis of patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear of Catholicism.\n\nLouis VII (1120 – September 18, 1180), called the Younger, or the Young was King of the Franks from 1137 to 1180. He was the son and successor of King Louis VI of the Franks (hence the epithet “the Young”) and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe. Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine was the eldest child of be Guillaume X, Duke of Aquitaine, and Aénor de Châtellerault.\n\nShe became duchess upon her father’s death in April 1137, and three months later she married Prince Louis, son of her guardian King Louis VI of France. Shortly afterwards, Louis VI died and Eleanor’s husband ascended the throne, as King Louis VII of the Franks making Eleanor Queen Consort. The marriage temporarily extended the Capetian lands to the Pyrenees.\n\nAs part of the Second Crusade in 1147, King Louis VII stayed at the court of King Géza II of Hungary on the way to Jerusalem. During his stay in the Holy Land disagreements with his wife led to a deterioration in their marriage. She persuaded him to stay in Antioch but King Louis VII instead wanted to fulfil his vows of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He was later involved in the failed siege of Damascus and eventually returned to France in 1149.\n\nLouis’ reign saw the founding of the University of Paris. He and his counsellor Abbot Suger, pushed for greater centralisation of the state and favoured the development of French Gothic architecture, notably the construction of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\nKing Louis VII marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine was annulled in 1152 after no male heir was produced. Immediately after their annulment, Eleanor married Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou, to whom she conveyed Aquitaine, which following Henry’s ascension to the English throne as King Henry II of England he created an Angevin Empire.\n\nLater, King Louis VII supported King HenryII’s rebellious sons to foment further disunity in the Angevin realms.\n\nKing Louis VII went on to marry his second cousin, Infanta Constance of Castile, but still failed to produce a male heir. Infanta Constance of Castile was a daughter of King Alfonso VII of Castile and León and Infanta Berengaria of Barcelona, but her year of birth is not known.\n\nInfanta Constance died in childbirth with their second daughter.\n\nWhen King Louis VII’s second wife, Infanta Constance of Castile, died in childbirth in 1160, he was devastated and became convinced that he would die young as well, fearing that the country would fall into chaos as he had no male heir. As he was desperate for a son, the 40 year-old King Louis VII married 20-year-old Adela of Champagne five weeks later, on November 13, 1160.\n\nAdela of Champagne was the third child and first daughter of Theobald II, Count of Champagne and Matilda of Carinthia, and had nine brothers and sisters. Adela of Champagne was named after her paternal grandmother Adela of Normandy, a daughter of William the Conqueror, King of England, and Matilda of Flanders who later became the countess of Blois, Chartres, and Meaux by marriage to Count Stephen II of Blois. Adela of Normandy was the mother of King Stephen of England and Bishop Henry of Winchester.\n\nAdela of Champagne’s coronation was held the same day. She went on to give birth to Louis VII’s only son, later King Philippe II Augusté of France and to the future Byzantine Empress Agnes.\n\nAgnes of France first married Alexios II Komnenos, Byzantine Emperor from 1180 to 1183. In the Byzantine Empire Princess Agnes of France was renamed Anna. In 1183 Maria of Antioch was displaced by a new power behind the throne, Andronikos I Komnenos. Andronikos was crowned co-ruler with Emperor Alexios II; then, in October of the same year, he had Emperor Alexios II strangled. Anna was now 12, and the approximately 65-year-old new Byzantine Emperor Andronikos married her. The union remained childless.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia and Empress Maria Alexandrovna had grown fond of Dagmar, and they wanted her to marry their new heir, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich. In an affectionate letter, Emperor Alexander II told Dagmar that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family.\n\nEmpress Maria Alexandrovna tried to convince Louise of Hesse-Cassel to send Dagmar to Russia immediately, but Louise insisted that Dagmar must “strengthen her nerves… [and] avoid emotional upsets.” Dagmar, who sincerely mourned Nicholas, and Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich, who was in love with his mother’s lady-in-waiting Mariya Meshcherskaya, and attempted to renounce his place as heir to the throne in order to marry her, were both initially reluctant. However, under pressure from his parents, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich decided to go to Denmark.\n\nIn June 1866, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich arrived in Copenhagen with his brothers Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. While looking over photographs of Nicholas, Alexander asked Dagmar if “she could love him after having loved Nixa, to whom they were both devoted.” She answered that she could love no one but him, because he had been so close to his brother.\n\nTsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich recalled that “we both burst into tears… [and] I told her that my dear Nixa helped us much in this situation and that now of course he prays about our happiness.” On June 17, he proposed to her during a picnic to the beach at Hellebæk by the coast of the Øresund strait near Elsinore and received a yes.\n\nThe engagement was announced on June 23rd at Fredensborg Palace. Both Dagmar and Alexander quickly embraced the prospect of marrying each other, and were soon described as genuinely enthusiastic.\n\nIn the time leading up to Dagmar’s departure to Russia, many festive events took place in Copenhagen, On September 22, 1866, Dagmar left Copenhagen on board the Danish royal yacht Slesvig escorted by the armoured frigate Peder Skram, and accompanied by her brother, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nHans Christian Andersen, who had occasionally been invited to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay in order to see her off. The writer remarked in his diary, “Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped and took me by the hand.\n\nMy eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar’s family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side.”\n\nDagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by the emperor’s brother Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich of Russia and escorted to St. Petersburg, where she was greeted by her future mother-in-law and sister-in-law on September 24th.\n\nThe weather on this September day was almost summery with temperatures of more than 20 degrees, which was noted by the poet Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev in the welcome poem dedicated to the arrival of the princess: The sky is light blue… On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she was introduced to the Russian public on a balcony.\n\nCatherine Radziwill described the occasion: “rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment she set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity”\n\nIn the following weeks, Dagmar was educated in Russian court etiquette. She converted to Russian Orthodoxy on October 24, 1866 and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia the following day. However, at the Russian court, where French was practically the first language, she was often called “Marie”.\n\nThe lavish wedding took place on November 9 , 1866 in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederik. Her brother-in-law, Prince Albert Edward of the United Kingdom, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had Prevented Princess Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, from attending.\n\nAfter the wedding night, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich wrote in his diary, “I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine… How I felt then, I do not wish to describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time.”\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: Before I address the wedding of Princess Dagmar of Denmark and Emperor Alexander III of Russia, I will cover Dagmar’s engagement to Alexander’s brother, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia.\n\nPrincess Dagmar of Denmark [Maria Feodorovna] (November 26, 1847 – October 13, 1928), known before her marriage as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was Empress of Russia from 1881 to 1894 as the wife of Emperor Alexander III.\n\nShe was the fourth child and second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark, a daughter of Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Denmark’s father was a younger son of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway, while her mother was a daughter of Duke Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nAt birth she had two older siblings, Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark and Norway (who later became King Christian Frederik of Norway in 1814 and was King Christian VIII of Denmark from 1839) and Princess Juliane Sophie. She later had a younger brother, Prince Frederik Ferdinand.\n\nGrowing up, she was known by the name Dagmar. Most of her adult life, however, she was known as Maria Feodorovna, the name which she took when she converted to Russian Orthodoxy immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor Alexander III. Within her family, she was known as “Minnie” throughout her life.\n\nAt the end of 1863, as the daughter and sister of the kings of Denmark and Greece and sister-in-law of the Prince of Wales, Dagmar was now considered one of Europe’s most coveted princesses. She received a proposal from Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, but was reluctant to marry him because she found him unattractive.\n\nHer mother was also reluctant to support such a marriage as she saw a greater status in the prospect of Dagmar marrying into the Russian imperial family. Due to the rise of Slavophile ideology in the Russian Empire, Alexander II of Russia searched for a bride for the heir apparent, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia, in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars.\n\nPrincess Dagmar was one of the candidates, and as early as 1860 the emperor had made his first inquiries about a possible engagement. There were also already family ties between the two families, as Dagmar’s uncle, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel, had been married to the Emperor’s sister, Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia.\n\nIn 1864, the Russian Empress Maria Alexandrovna announced that her son would visit Denmark, and during the summer Nicholas, or “Nixa” as he was known in his family, arrived at Fredensborg Palace, where the Danish royal family was staying. Nicholas had never met Dagmar, but had for a number of years collected photographs of her, and both families wanted the marriage. When they met, Dagmar and Nicholas were mutually attracted, and Nicholas wrote to his mother:\n\nI came here as if in a fever (…) I can not describe to you what came over me, when we approached Fredenborg and I finally saw the sweet Dagmar. How can I describe it? She is so beautiful, direct, intelligent, experienced, and yet shy at the same time. She is even more beautiful in reality than in the pictures we have seen so far.\n\nAfter returning to Russia to obtain his father’s permission, Nicholas proposed to Dagmar on September 28, 1864 in the Bernstorff Palace Gardens and received a yes. The engagement was announced at Bernstorff Palace later the same day. Her future mother-in-law Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse and By Rhine) gave her a six-strand pearl necklace and Nicholas gave her a diamond bracelet. In total, the betrothal gifts Dagmar received from her future in-laws cost 1.5 million rubles.\n\nThe engagement was popular in both countries and at the same time ensured the Danish royal family even better connections. The engagement took place right during the Second Schleswig War between Denmark on one side and Prussia and Austria on the other, and during the peace negotiations after the war in October 1864, Dagmar unsuccessfully asked her future father-in-law to help Denmark against Prussia over the disputed territory of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn a letter, she asked Emperor Alexander II of Russia: “Use your power to mitigate the terrible conditions which the Germans have brutally forced Papa to accept… the sad plight of my fatherland, which makes my heart heavy, has inspired me to turn to you.” It is believed that she did it with the consent of her parents, but it is not known if it was at their request. Her appeal was in vain, but from that moment on she became known for her anti-Prussian views.\n\nDeathbed of Tsarevich Nicholas.\n\nAs Nicholas continued on his journey to Florence, Dagmar and Nicholas exchanged daily love letters for months. When he grew ill, Nicholas sent fewer letters and Dagmar teasingly asked him if he had fallen in love with “a dark-eyed Italian”. In April, Nicholas grew gravely ill with cerebrospinal meningitis.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia sent a telegram to Dagmar: “Nicholas has received the Last Rites. Pray for us and come if you can.” On April 22, 1865, Nicholas died in the presence of his parents, brothers, and Dagmar. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III.\n\nDagmar was devastated by Nicholas’ death. Nicholas’ parents struggled to “pull Princess Dagmar away from the corpse and carry her out.” She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health. She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her home.\n\nMany were sympathetic towards Dagmar. Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge wrote of “poor dear Minny’s sorrow and the blight which has fallen upon her young life.” Queen Victoria wrote “how terrible for poor Dagmar… the poor parents and bride are most deeply to be pitied.”\n\nPrincess Mary of England and Scotland, was born at St James’s Palace in London on April 30, 1662, and she was the eldest daughter of Prince James, the Duke of York (the future King James II-VII of England, Scotland and Ireland), and his first wife, Anne Hyde.\n\nMary’s uncle was King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland; her maternal grandfather, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, served for a lengthy period as King Charles II’s chief advisor. She was baptised into the Anglican faith in the Chapel Royal at St James’s, and was named after her ancestor, Mary I, Queen of Scots.\n\nWillem III (November 4, 1650 – March 8, 1702) was the sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from the 1670s, and King William III of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death in 1702. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He ruled Britain and Ireland alongside his wife, Queen Mary II, and their joint reign is known as that of William and Mary.\n\nWillem was the only child of Willem II, Prince of Orange, and Mary, Princess Royal, the daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland and his wife Princess Henrietta Maria de Bourbon of France the daughter of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and Maria de Medici. His father died a week before his birth, making Willem III the Prince of Orange from birth.\n\nDuring the war with France, Willem III tried to improve his position by marrying. Prince Willem III desired to marry , in 1677, his first cousin Princess Mary of England and Scotland, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and Willem III believed that marrying her would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles’s kingdoms, and would draw England’s monarch away from his pro-French policies.\n\nWhen Princess Mary of England became betrothed to her cousin, Prince Willem III of Orange, he was 26 and she was the age of fifteen. At first, King Charles II opposed the alliance with the Dutch ruler—he preferred that Mary wed the heir to the French throne, the Grand Dauphin Louis de Bourbon of France the eldest son and heir apparent of King Louis XIV and his spouse, Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain.\n\nKing Charles II believed a marriage between Mary and Louis would ally his realms with Catholic France and strengthening the odds of an eventual Catholic successor in Britain—but later, under pressure from Parliament and with a coalition with the Catholic French no longer politically favourable, he approved the proposed union.\n\nMary’s father, Prince James, the Duke of York, agreed to the marriage, after pressure from chief minister Lord Danby and the King, who incorrectly assumed that it would improve James’s popularity among Protestants. When James, Duke of York told Mary that she was to marry her cousin, “she wept all that afternoon and all the following day”.\n\nMarriage\n\nPrince Willem III and a tearful Princess Mary were married in St James’s Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on November 4, 1677, the Prince of Oranges birthday. The bedding ceremony to publicly establish the consummation of the marriage was attended by the royal family, with her uncle the King himself drawing the bed curtains.\n\nMary accompanied her husband on a rough sea crossing to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and they were forced to land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and walk through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On December 14, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.\n\nAfter his marriage Prince Willem became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father-in-law (and uncle) Prince James be excluded because of his Catholicism.\n\nDuring the crisis concerning the Exclusion Bill in 1680, Charles at first invited Willem to come to England to bolster the king’s position against the exclusionists, then withdrew his invitation—after which Lord Sunderland also tried unsuccessfully to bring Willem over, but now to put pressure on Charles.\n\nNevertheless, Willem secretly induced the States General to send Charles the “Insinuation”, a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him, without explicitly naming James. After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James, Willem denied any involvement.\n\nPrincess María de las Mercedes of Orléans (June 24, 1860 – June 26, 1878) was Queen of Spain as the first wife of King Alfonso XII of Spain. She was born in Madrid, the daughter of Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nHer father, Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, was her first cousin once removed, and the youngest son of King Louis-Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nHer mother, Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, was the younger daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his fourth wife and niece, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain was the sister King Fernando VII of Spain, the father of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nInfanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain elder sister was Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBorn at the Palacio Real in Madrid on June 24, 1860, Mercedes was the sixth of her parents’ nine children. Her mother’s elder sister, Queen Isabella II, and brother-in-law, King Francisco, served as Mercedes’ godparents at her christening, when she was given the names: María de las Mercedes Isabel Francisca de Asís Antonia Luisa Fernanda Felipa Amalia Cristina Francisca de Paula Ramona Rita Cayetana Manuela Juana Josefa Joaquina Ana Rafaela Filomena Teresa Santísima Trinidad Gaspara Melchora Baltasara et omni sancti.\n\nAlthough Mercedes was patrilineally a French Princess, she was also a Spanish infanta and spent the first eight years of her life in Spain. Her childhood was spent at the Palace of San Telmo in Andalusia, her father’s rumoured aspirations to obtain his sister-in-law’s crown periodically rendering him unwelcome at the royal court in Madrid.\n\nMarriage and reign\n\nWhen Queen Isabella II was deposed in 1868, Mercedes’ family left Spain for exile. It was reportedly during that banishment in 1872 that she met her first cousin Infante Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, also living in exile. Queen Isabella II opposed a marriage between the two due to the hostilities between Mercedes’ father and the former Queen.\n\nUpon restoration, King Alfonso XII of Spain married María de las Mercedes at the church of Atocha in Madrid on January 23, 1878, following a huge ball in December 1877. Allegedly, the King’s choice dashed the hopes of his still-exiled mother Queen Isabella for Alfonso’s marriage to Infanta Blanca de Bourbon, daughter of his Carlist rival Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid.\n\nInfanta Blanca of Spain (1868 – 1949) was the eldest child of Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain and his wife Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma. Blanca was a member of the House of Bourbon and – according to the Carlists – an Infanta of Spain by birth.\n\nIn 1889 she married Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria. The couple had ten children. The family left Austria after the end of the Monarchy and finally settled in Barcelona. When the male line of Blanca’s family died out at the death of her uncle, Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, some of the Carlists recognized her as the legitimate heiress to the Spanish throne.\n\nQueen Mercedes helped build a new temple after the Church of Santa María de la Almudena was demolished in 1868.\n\nDeath\n\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on June 26, 1878, just two days after her 18th birthday.\n\nWhen the King’s minister Cánovas del Castillo suggested that he take a new wife, King Alfonso XII acquiesced, choosing Mercedes’ sister Infanta María Cristina. For a few months he courted Infanta María Cristina, who was willing to replace her late sister, but it soon became clear that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Maria Cristina died at the age of 26 on April 28, 1879 in her native Seville\n\nIn late 1879, the King married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen; a daughter of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria (grandson of Emperor Leopold II) and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).\n\nPalatine Joseph of Hungary, Archduke of Austria, was the ninth child and seventh son of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of parents, King Carlos III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily, and Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nThe eldest child, of King Alfonso XII and Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria-Teschen was Infanta María de las Mercedes (1880 – 1904) was named in honour of Queen Mercedes. She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.\n\nHad her younger sibling, unborn at the death of King Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been Queen of Spain. The sibling proved to be a boy, King Alfonso XIII, a King upon his birth in 1886, and Mercedes turned out not to be queen.\n\nShe resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Prince Alfonso of the Two Sicilies, King Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.\n\nMercedes married in Madrid on February 14, 1901, to her second cousin, Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of the King of the then-defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law’s ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.\n\nMarie Antoinette (November 2, 1755 – October 16, 1793) was the last Queen of France and Navarre before the French Revolution. She was born an Archduchess of Austria, and was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nMarie Antoinette was earlier in life known by the German version of her name, Maria Antonia, and was raised together with her sister, Archduchess Maria Carolina, who was three years older, and with whom she had a lifelong close relationship.\n\nHer sister Maria Carolina also married a Bourbon Prince, and was was Queen of Naples and Sicily as the wife of King Ferdinand IV-III, who later became King of the Two Sicilies. Maria Carolina was also the de facto ruler of her husband’s kingdoms,\n\nMarie Antoinette had a difficult but ultimately loving relationship with her mother, who referred to her as “the little Madame Antoine”.\n\nMarie Antoinette spent her formative years between the Hofburg Palace and Schönbrunn, the imperial summer residence in Vienna, where on October 13, 1762, when she was seven, she met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two months her junior and a child prodigy.\n\nMarie Antoinette formally renounced her rights to Habsburg domains, and on April 19th when she was married, by proxy, to the Dauphin of France at the Augustinian Church in Vienna, with her brother Archduke Ferdinand standing in for the Dauphin.\n\nShe became Dauphine of France in May 1770 at the age 14 upon her marriage to Prince Louis-Augusté de Bourbon of France heir apparent to the French throne. On May 10, 1774, her husband ascended the throne as King Louis XVI of France and Navarre and she became Queen.\n\nKing Louis XVI reigned as King of France and Navarre until September 4, 1791, when he received the title of King of the French, and continued reigning as King until the monarchy was abolished.\n\nMarie Antoinette’s position at court improved when, after eight years of marriage, she started having children. She became increasingly unpopular among the people, however, with the French libelles accusing her of being profligate, promiscuous, allegedly having illegitimate children, and harboring sympathies for France’s perceived enemies—particularly her native Austria.\n\nThe false accusations of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace damaged her reputation further. During the Revolution, she became known as Madame Déficit because the country’s financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of Turgot and Necker.\n\nSeveral events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government had placed the royal family under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted flight to Varennes and her role in the War of the First Coalition had disastrous effects on French popular opinion.\n\nOn August 10, 1792, the attack on the Tuileries Palace forced the royal family to take refuge at the Assembly, and they were imprisoned in the Temple Prison on August 13th.\n\nOn that same day, August 10, 1792, in the context of civil and international war, King Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the Insurrection. One month later, the monarchy was abolished and the First French Republic was proclaimed on 21 September 1792.\n\nThe former King became a desacralized French citizen, addressed as Citizen Louis Capét in reference to his ancestor Hugh Capét. Louis was tried by the National Convention (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of high treason and executed by guillotine on January 21, 1793. Louis XVI was the only king of France ever to be executed, and his death brought an end to more than a thousand years of continuous French monarchy.\n\nEarly on October 16, 1793 Marie Antoinette was declared guilty of the three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against the internal and external security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities in the interest of the enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death.\n\nAt worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Her will was part of the collection of papers of Robespierre found under his bed and was published by Edme-Bonaventure Courtois.\n\nPreparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She wanted to wear a black dress but was forced to wear a plain white dress, white being the colour worn by widowed Queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash.\n\nUnlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution (the present-day Place de la Concorde).\n\nShe maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold as he had pledged his allegiance to the Republic.\n\nMarie Antoinette was guillotined at 12:15 p.m. on October 16, 1793. Her last words are recorded as, “Pardonnez-moi, monsieur. Je ne l’ai pas fait exprès” or “Pardon me, sir, I did not do it on purpose”, after accidentally stepping on her executioner’s shoe.\n\nMarie Tussaud was employed to make a death mask of her head. Her body was thrown into an unmarked grave in the Madeleine cemetery, located close by in rue d’Anjou. Because its capacity was exhausted the cemetery was closed the following year, on March 25, 1794.\n\nThe phrase “Let them eat cake” is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, but there is no evidence that she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a journalistic cliché. This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s autobiographical work Les Confessions, finished in 1767 and published in 1782. Rousseau ascribes these words to a “great princess”, but the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette’s arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.\n\nBoth Marie Antoinette’s and Louis XVI’s bodies were exhumed on January 18, 1815, during the Bourbon Restoration, when Prince Louis Stanislas de Bourbon, Count of Provence ascended the newly reestablished throne as King Louis XVIII of France and of Navarre. Christian burial of the royal remains took place three days later, o January 21, in the necropolis of French kings at the Basilica of St Denis.\n\nPrince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (July 31, 1824 – February 4, 1890), was a member of the French royal family from the House of Orléans.\n\nHRH Prince Antoine Marie Philippe Louis d’Orléans was the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, the tenth of eighteen children of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nPrince Antoine’s grandmother, Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, the thirteenth child of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine and his wife Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia in her own right.\n\nPrince Antoine was styled as HRH The Duke of Montpensier. He was born on July 31, 1824 at the château de Neuilly and died February 4, 1890 at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain.\n\nOn October 10, 1846 at Madrid, Spain, he married Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain, the daughter of King Fernando VII of Spain and his wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies by his second wife, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain had ten children (one stillborn in 1857):\n\n1. Maria Isabel (1848–1919), who married her first cousin Philippe, comte de Paris (1838–94), the French claimant, and became known as Marie Isabelle, comtesse de Paris. She had several children.\n\n2. Maria Amelia (1851–1870)\n\n3. Maria Cristina (1852–1879)\n\n4. Maria de la Regla (1856–1861)\n\n5. Fernando (1859–1873)\n\n6. Mercedes (1860–1878), otherwise Princess Marie des Graces d’Orleans-Montpensier, who married her first cousin Alfonso XII and is historically known as Mercedes of Orleans, Queen of Spain. No children.\n\n7. Felipe Raimundo Maria (1862–1864)\n\n8. Antonio (1866–1930), became Duke of Galliera in Italy. He married his first cousin Infanta Eulalia of Spain (1864–1958), daughter of Queen Isabella II, and had two sons.\n\n9. Luis Maria Felipe Antonio (1867–1874)\n\nCandidate for the Spanish throne\n\nPrince Antoine de Montpensier lived in Spain from 1848 when he and his family had to leave France after the Revolution of 1848. During the Spanish revolution of 1868, he supported the insurgents under Juan Prim against Queen Isabel II, his own sister-in-law.\n\nIn 1870 he fought a duel against Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, the brother of King Francisco of Spain, and killed him.\n\nInfante Enrique, Duke of Seville was the grandson of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife, Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies (1804–1844), who was the daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain.\n\nInfante Enrique of Spain became the first Duke of Seville in 1823. He was known for his progressive, even revolutionary, ideas during the reign of his double first cousin and sister-in-law, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1870, Enrique published several pamphlets and articles hostile to his cousin, Antoine, Duke of Montpensier for the duke’s alleged aspirations on the Spanish throne. Enrique challenged Montpensier to a duel, which took place near La Fortuna in Leganés, Madrid, on March 12, 1870. Enrique was shot and killed, removing him as a public critic of the Duke of Montpensier.\n\nPrince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier was convicted and sentenced to one month in prison.\n\nEnrique’s eldest son, Enrique de Borbón y Castellví, 2nd Duke of Seville, refused to accept the 30,000 pesetas that the Duke of Montpensier offered as compensation.\n\nEnrique, who was no longer an Infante of Spain, could not be buried in El Escorial, but was buried in the Saint Isidore Cemetery, in Madrid.\n\nAfter the marriage of Queen Isabella II of Spain and his brother, Infante Francisco de Asís, Infante Enrique went into a self imposed exile into Belgium. While in France, Infante Enrique several times proclaimed himself a revolutionary, and was asked to join the International Workingmen’s Association.\n\nOn May 13, 1848 he was stripped of his Royal Rank and titles (his children, being born of a morganatic marriage to, Elena María de Castellví y Shelly, were untitled). In 1849 he asked the Queen’s forgiveness in order to return from exile. Enrique’s ducal title was restored, but not the title and style of HRH Infante of Spain.\n\nOn November 16, 1870 the Cortes voted for the next king and chose Prince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, with 191 votes.\n\nPrince Amadeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta was the third child and second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia, who would later become the first King of a unified Italy, and of Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Prince Amadeo was granted the hereditary title of Duke of Aosta from birth.\n\nPrince Antoine only received 27 votes, and left Spain, only to return in 1874. His ambitions were fulfilled by his daughter Princess Mercedes of Orléans, who became Queen of Spain after her marriage to King Alfonso XII, son of Queen Isabella II. However, she died at the age of 18 without issue.\n\nDespite never reaching the throne, however, through cognates, he is an ancestor of all Spanish monarchs since Juan Carlos I. His great granddaughter Mercedes, Countess of Barcelona, was the mother of King Juan Carlos of Spain who assumed the throne in 1975 and later abdicated in favor of his son, King Felipe VI of Spain in 2014.\n\nEarly collector of photography\n\nThe Duke of Montpensier was an early collector of photography. His collection consisted of dozens of albums and hundreds of early photographs, mainly of Spanish, French and British photographers. The collection was dispersed after his death.\n\nFrederik I (October 7, 1471 – April 10, 1533) was King of Denmark and Norway. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAs King of Norway, Frederik is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as King of Norway. Therefore, he was styled King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway.\n\nFrederik’s reign began the enduring tradition of calling Kings of Denmark alternatively by the names Christian and Frederick, which has continued up to the reign of the current monarch, Margrethe II.\n\nFrederik was the younger son of the first Danish king of the House of Oldenburg, King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95), a Hohenzollern Princess and the daughter of Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg became a Scandinavian Queen by marriage under the Kalmar Union. She was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from her marriage to King Christopher III of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1445 until King Christopher III died in 1448.\n\nQueen Dorothea was given a proposal from King Casimir IV of Poland and Albrecht VI, Archduke of Austria, but she chose to remain in Denmark and marry the newly elected king, Christian I of Denmark.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg had three children:\n\n1. Johann, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Christina of Saxony.\n\n2. Margaret. She married King James III of Scotland\n\n3. Friedrich I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\n\nThe dynasty King Christian founded, the House of Oldenburg, remains on the throne of Denmark through the collateral branch, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (also known as Glücksburg). This royal house was on the throne of Norway until 1818, returning there again from 1905, and also on the throne of Sweden during Christian’s reign there and those of his son and grandson, but also 1751–1818.\n\nSoon after the death of his father, the underage Frederik was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King Johann of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederik’s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.\n\nIn 1500, he had convinced his brother King Johann to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one-third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.\n\nReign\n\nWhen his brother, King Johann, died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederik the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew King Christian II.\n\nIn 1523, King Christian II was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate as King of Denmark and Norway, and Frederik took the throne of Denmark in 1523 and was elected King of Norway in 1524.\n\nIt is not certain that Frederik ever learned to speak Danish. After becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.\n\nIn 1524 and 1525, King Frederik had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of King Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (statholder) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power.\n\nHe raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (Helsingborgs slott), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederick’s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.\n\nKing Frederik played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teaching throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (værner) of Roman Catholicism in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Roman Catholic dioceses in the country.\n\nKing Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but King Frederik took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Lutherans and Roman Catholics share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language. In 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, King Frederik appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.\n\nStarting in 1527, King Frederik authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Roman Catholic nobles.\n\nDuring his reign, King Frederik was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1532, he succeeded in capturing King Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country.\n\nKing Frederik died on April 10, 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederik’s death, tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count’s Feud (Grevens Fejde).\n\nKing Frederik I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden was succeeded by King Christian III of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Archduchess Isabella of Austria (18 July 1501 – 19 January 1526), also known as Elizabeth, the daughter of Archduke Philipp of Austria, Duke of Burgundy (also King Felipe I of Castile) and his wife Queen Joanna of Castile and the sister of Emperor Charles V. She ruled Denmark as regent in 1520.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1500 Prince Frederick of Denmark was betrothed to Princess Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia, the daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia and Archduchess Anne of Austria, Duchess of Luxembourg suo jure. Archduchess Anne of Austria, was the eldest daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/King of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the sole descendant of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBecause they were second cousins (Frederik’s mother Dorothea of Brandenburg was the cousin of Anna’s father, Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg) their marriage required a Papal dispensation by Pope Alexander VI.\n\nIn addition, the marriage was not held until April 10, 1502 due to Princess Anna’s youth. In 1500 the year of their betrothal Princess Anna was 13 and Prince Frederik was 29. Two years later Princess Anna was 15 and Prince Frederik was 31 respectively.\n\nThe marriage, held in Stendal, was a double one: on the same day, Anna’s brother Joachim and Frederick’s niece Elisabeth were married.\n\nThe couple had two children:\n\n1. Christian III, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1503 – 1559)\n\n2. Dorothea of Denmark (1504 – 1547), married Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke of Prussia. Prior to her marriage to Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach a marriage was suggested to the English claimant to the throne, Richard de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, who was supported by King François I of France, but without success.\n\nFrederick’s wife Anna died on May 5, 1514, aged 26 years old.\n\nFour years later on October 9, 1518 at Kiel, the 47 year-old Prince Frederik married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw “the Great”, Duke of Pomerania and the Polish princess, Anna Jagiellon, the fifth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nSophie and Frederick had six children:\n\n1. Johann II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (1521 – 1580)\n\n2. Elizabeth of Denmark (14 October 1524 – 15 October 1586), married:\n\na) Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nb) Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\n3. Adolph of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1526 – 1586)\n\n4. Anna of Denmark (1527 – 1535)\n\n5. Dorothea of Denmark (1528 – 1575), married to Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.\n\n6. Frederik of Denmark (1532 – 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.\n\nThe title of Tsar (alternatively Czar, Tzar or Csar) was a title used by Slavic monarchs. The term is derived from the Latin word Caesar.\n\nCaesar was a Cognomen which was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome, under Roman naming conventions. Initially, a Cognomen was a nickname, but lost that purpose when it became an hereditary name. Hereditary cognomen were used to augment the second name, the family name, or clan name in order to identify a particular branch within a family or family within a clan.\n\nIn Eastern European languages Caesar eventually evolved to mean “Emperor” in the European medieval sense of the term—a ruler with the same rank as a Roman Emperor, holding it by the approval of another Emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official such as the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the term Tsar was usually considered by Western Europeans to be equivalent to “King”. It lends its name to a system of government, Tsarit, Autocracy or Tsarism.\n\nThat is how I interpret the title of Tsar. I interpret the title of Tsar to mean King. In my view, from the time when Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, adopted the title of Tsar in 1484 until Tsar Peter I the Great was created Emperor of Russia on October 22, 1721, the monarchs of Russia that held the title of Tsar were actually Kings of Russia and not Emperors.\n\nIf the title of Tsar already meant “Emperor” prior to Peter the Great being created Emperor in 1721, then why was it necessary to grant the title of Emperor to Peter the Great?\n\nThat is what I see is the problem. In many English language publications both since the time when Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, adopted the title of Tsar in 1484 and even after Peter I the Great was created Emperor of Russia in 1721 the title of Tsar is translated as Emperor.\n\nTo restate it, Emperors and Empresses of Russia after Peter the Great are still refered to as Tsars of Russia in English publications. I’ve read where Nicholas II, proud of his Russian heritage, preferred the title of Tsar.\n\nLet’s examine how the title of Tsar was regarded in Russia.\n\nIn his dealings with the Habsburg Emperors, Ivan was offered the title of King (Rex) if he would join the alliance against Turkey, but he rejected such offers and continued his own policy, laying claim to the Kievan legacy and adopting the title of Autocrat, Sovereign of the Russian Land, and Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia.\n\nHowever, beginning in 1484, Ivan began to use the title of Tsar in his foreign correspondence with secondary powers in Europe including the Livonian Order.\n\nAt times the title was translated as “Imperator” such as in a 1493 treaty with Denmark where Ivan was called “domino Johanne totius Rutzie imperator”. Ivan also began insisting on the title to the Habsburgs in 1489, and he continued to portray himself to his subjects and foreign states as the Orthodox Emperor of Russia.\n\nWhenever it was possible in diplomatic situations, Ivan and his representatives would refer to him as Tsar. According to Isabel de Madariaga, had the title of Russian monarchs continued to be translated as Rex, Russia’s assimilation into the ranking order of states in Europe would have been much easier.\n\nTherefore in Russia the Tsar did see themselves as Emperors while the rest of Europe saw the Russian rulers as Kings.\n\nThe problem of recognizing the Russian ruler as an Emperor lies in the concept of how the title of Emperor was seen and regarded in Western Europe.\n\nWe will examine that next in part II."
