        "text": "The 1989 Chacmool Conference on the Archaeology of Gender resulted in a ground-breaking volume with the same title, one of the first attempts to present the work of scholars interested in the archaeology of gender in a single publication. I published a critique of the state of Iron Age gender studies in west-central Europe (Arnold 1991) in that volume, focusing particularly on the elite burial of the so-called Vix “princess” and its androcentric interpretation as a “transvestite male priest”. Revisiting the topic of the archaeology of gender in Iron Age Europe after two decades suggests that significant progress has been made since 1989. An overview of recent approaches to Iron Age gender archaeology in the context of mortuary analysis is presented, including a discussion of more recent work on the Vix burial itself (Knüsel, 2002; Rolley, 2003).\n\nThe front matter for a book which examines the medieval queens of Hungary primarily through their material culture and through the spaces they built, renovated, or restored. Showcases common features with the west as well as how the queens had to deal with court structures unique to Hungary. Argues that queens used material culture and space to prop up their own position when it was weakened by external circumstances\n\nThis dissertation analyzes the grave good assemblages in 222 burial contexts from Hallstatt D (c. 600-400 BCE) tumulus cemeteries in west-central Europe to test the hypothesis that certain combinations of grave goods were associated with particular categories of persons based on an intersectional marking of gender, status, age and social role. The primary data set consists of high-status graves – male, female, ungendered/pre-gendered subadults, and those of indeterminate gender – in the Heuneburg interaction sphere in southwest Germany. The results of this analysis are compared to a secondary data set of comparable burials from other west-central European locations, to determine whether discernible patterns are due to regional traditions or may reflect deeper conceptions of gender ideology. The posthumous portraiture provided by these mortuary contexts is discussed in relation to identity and role, including gender, age, kin relations, and childbearing status. The distinction between lifestyles and deathstyles in identity marking and the relevance of these costume elements for accessing gender ideology in this preliterate society are presented using a visual body mapping approach that reveals the complexity of archaeologically accessing intersectional identities in the past.\n\nThe investigation of elite girls’ burials in the Italian peninsula is part of a broader doctoral research project that aims to outline the territorial distribution of Early Mediaeval elite women and girls in the Italian peninsula and analyse the strategies of their funerary self-representation in a short but significant period. Altogether 24 elite girls’ burials have been identified in Roman-Byzantine and Lombard territories between the second half of the sixth and the end of the seventh centuries AD. Our analysis focuses on the most significant elements: find context, burial topography, the quality of the funerary goods, and funerary construction. In Byzantine territories, elite children were given ad sanctos burial, but with significant differences in purchasing power between the cities and the countryside. The urban elite was willing to spend huge amounts of money for the burial of their girls inside churches, while the same level of wealth has not been detected in the countryside so far. On the other hand, in the Lombard Kingdom and the Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, funerals given to elite Lombard girls did not differ from those of older age groups and involved handing over important family brooches between generations. By the mid-seventh century AD, elite girl’s burials were frequently near or inside churches and rural oratories, contributing in a significant way to a gradual narrowing of the cultural gap between Lombards and the local population."
