        "text": "Nestled behind Cleveland's culinary landmark, the West Side Market, is a spiritual landmark that for years has had a parish as vibrant as the ornate Gothic architecture inside St. Emeric Church.\n\nBut on this Sunday, church pews were filled for a solemn reason – to say goodbye to longtime pastor, Rev. Sandor Siklodi.\n\nSiklodi was first ordained for the Diocese of Transylvania in 1971. He came to St. Emeric Church, a Hungarian parish of about 350 families, in 1985, and served as an assistant pastor until 1988, when he became pastor.\n\nTwenty-five years later, he succumbed to a brief but ultimately fatal illness on July 31. He was 66 years old.\n\nVesper Services were held at 3 p.m. at the West 22nd Street church, with the Mass of Christian burial to take place at the church 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nHis parishioners remembered Siklodi as kind, approachable and personable. But it was his ability to connect with the church's elderly members – many of whom spoke only Hungarian – that exemplified his priesthood.\n\n\"We need a Hungarian priest to keep the heritage going,\" Mary Foldesi, whose been in the parish for 62 years, said. \"It's a big loss for us all.\"\n\nSiklodi's death leaves a vacuum in the city's west-side Hungarian community. But that community is no stranger to holes in their hearts.\n\nSt. Emeric's was one of 50 Catholic churches to close in 2010, after an order from Bishop Richard Lennon of the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland to downsize the Church's footprint due to shrinking parishes and cash collections.\n\nFor the next two years, while many parishioners had been attending the Rev. Bob Begin's Hungarian mass at St. Colman on West 65th Street, the church's volunteer organist, Miklos Peller, appealed Lennon's decision to the Vatican along with 11 other Cleveland area churches.\n\nThe decision was reversed, and Lennon agreed to let St. Emeric's bring Siklodi back from his reassignment at a Hungarian parish in Chicago. St. Emeric was the last of the 11 churches to reopen; the first mass was held again on Nov. 4.\n\nLess than nine-months after the church's spiritual rebirth, it's lost its pastor.\n\nFinding a Hungarian pastor to replace Siklodi could be as challenging as it is important, said Ildiko Peller, president of the parish council and Miklos' wife.\n\n\"Our parishioners have reached a point in their life where their heart, their inner spirit speaks in Hungarian,\" Ildiko Peller said. \"They need the comfort of the spiritual life in that Hungarian language.\"\n\nSiklodi was a pastor who got to know those parishioners.\n\n\"We were more than just a number on an envelope to him,\" Peller said.\n\nAnn Gyorky said she saw that first hand in 2010, when the family was preparing to give her son, John first communion.\n\nJohn has Down's Syndrome, and Ann said she was concerned he wouldn't grasp the gravity of his first communion.\n\n\"Father Sandor took the time to work with him and get him ready, and he ended up making his first communion at the last mass they had here before it closed,\" Gyorky said, starting to tear up.\n\nPeller, Foldesi and others said Siklodi's death leaves a void in the church and in the community, who is without a Hungarian pastor.\n\nWhile St. Elizabeth of Hungary sits on Buckeye Road near East 89th Street, many of St. Emeric's members wouldn't want to commute that far to go to church,\n\n\"For the older generation it's a little difficult to be traveling that far from their west side residences and south side,\" said Michael Horvath, executive secretary for the American Hungarian Friends of Scouting.\n\nThere are four Hungarian Scout troops in Cleveland, and two of them are run out of St. Emeric's, Horvath said. Sandor had a major hand in helping the Scouts revitalize an old warehouse on the church's grounds to use as the organization's headquarters.\n\n\"Father Sandor was a very good friend of Hungarian Scouts and to everyone here in the Hungarian community,\" he said.\n\nBishop Lennon has appointed an administrator to handle the clerical duties taken by a pastor, and is working to find a new head for St. Emeric.\n\nIn the meantime, the Rev. Andras Antal from St. Elizabeth's will traverse the city to give a 12:30 p.m. mass on Sundays in Hungarian at St. Emeric's. But there will be no more mass through the week.\n\n\"We're all stung,\" Peller said. \"We can't imagine what it will be like without him.\""
