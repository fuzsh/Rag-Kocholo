BONA: (1) On August 15, we celebrate the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven is the bodily taking up of the Virgin Mary into Heaven at the end of her earthly life. This solemnity is a Holy Day of Obligation, meaning that we are required to attend Mass. I know that many of you will probably attend near your workplace or your home, but at St. Elizabeth and St. Emeric and we will have the following schedule: on Monday evening at 6:00PM the Mass will be in English (St. Emeric), on Tuesday at 9AM (the language depends on those present) at St. Emeric, at 12 Noon (bilingual) at St. Elizabeth, and at 6:00PM (in Hungarian) at St. Emeric. I have highlighted the schedule for this solemnity in the above box.\n\n(2) Unfortunately, the Issue 1 did not pass and we saw how the abortion lobby was celebrating it. Let us redouble our efforts and prayers in preparation for the November elections where the opponents of human dignity of the unborn children will attempt to enshrine abortion up until birth with zero restrictions in Ohio’s constitution.\n\n(3) The effect of merger of St. Elizabeth and St. Emeric will take place this Monday. The establishment of the shrine at St. Elizabeth Church will take place on Tuesday. For the few weeks, we will keep the same schedule. We will also begin to merge the operations, but that will take some time. If you have any questions or comments as we go through this, please do not hesitate to approach me. Thank you for your patience in this regard.\n\nHELENA (august 18) was the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great and an Empress of the Roman Empire. She was born into a poor family and lower class in the Roman culture of the day. Despite her background, Helena married Constantius Chlorus. With him she birthed her only son, Constantine around the year 274. In 292, Constantius divorced Helena for Theodora. It is believed he did this to advance his own reputation and standing in the Roman society. In 306, Constantine became Emperor and he summoned his mother to the imperial court and bestowed the title of Augusta on her. Through her son’s influence, Helena began to embrace Christianity. Later she was tasked with locating relics of Christian tradition. She did find one of the most precious relics we have, the True Cross of our Lord. St. Helena died in 330.\n\nEUCHARISTIC PROCESSION: Legion of Mary of the Diocese of Cleveland invites you to a traditional Eucharistic Procession on Saturday, September 2, 2023 beginning with Holy Mass at 11am at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland.
