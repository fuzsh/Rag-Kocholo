By fulfilling your duty in this way you will reach the highest state of happiness. Be merciful to all who are suffering violence, keeping always in your heart the example of the Lord who said, \"I desire mercy and not sacrifice.\" Be patient with everyone, not only with the powerful, but also with the weak. Finally be strong lest prosperity lift you up to much or adversity cast you down. Be humble in this life, that God may raise you up in the next. Be truly moderate and do not punish or condemn anyone immoderately. Be gentle so that you may never oppose justice. Be honorable so that you may never voluntarily bring disgrace upon anyone. Be chaste so that ;you may avoid all the foulness of lust like the pangs of death. All these virtues I have noted above make up the royal crown, and without them no one is fit to rule here on earth or attain to the heavenly kingdom. - from Saint Stephen's advice to his son\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-stephen-of-hungary/\n\nSaint Roch\n\nAlso known as\n\nRoc, Rocco, Roche, Rochus, Rock, Rocke, Rollock, Rollox, Roque, Seemirookie\n\nProfile\n\nFrench noble who early developed a sympathy for the poor and sick; reported to have been born with the image of a red cross on his breast.
