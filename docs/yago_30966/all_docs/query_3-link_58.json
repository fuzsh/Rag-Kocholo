Born around 975; died in 1033; daughter of Henry II the Wrangler (951–995), duke of Bavaria (r. 985–995), and Gisela of Burgundy (d. 1006); sister of Henry II (972–1024), Holy Roman emperor (r. 1002–1024); aunt of Agatha of Hungary ; married Stephen I (c. 975–1038), first king of Hungary (r. 1000–1038), in 1008 (some sources cite 995); children: eldest son St. Emeric (also known as Imre) died young (as did all her other children).\n\nA Bavarian princess, Gisela of Bavaria was born around 975, the daughter of Henry II the Wrangler, duke of Bavaria, and Gisela of Burgundy . She married Stephen I, king of Hungary, around 1008, though some sources cite 995. Stephen was faced with great problems as he began the task of organizing, defending, and Christianizing his nation and bringing it into the European fold. One such problem was the revolt of a cousin, Koppàny, who ruled in Transylvania. Koppàny had claimed not only the throne, but the hand of Stephen's widowed mother Sarolta . Immediately moving against him, Stephen eventually defeated Koppàny, executing him in 1003. Then another Magyar—known only by the title Gyula—claimed the rule in Transylvania and usurped it. He, too, was disposed of by the new king Stephen, who was actively supported by German knights in the service of his wife and queen, Gisela."
