        "text": "Gisela of Hungary is a beatified woman, meaning that she is on the road to sainthood but has not been canonized yet. However, it would not be surprising if that happened soon. She is someone who all can look up to, one who took risks for her faith and was willing to give up all she had to devote herself to God.\n\nShe was born in Bavaria around 980 A.D. and was the daughter of Henry II, Duke of Hungary, and Gisela of Burgundy. She was educated by St. Wolfgang of Regensburg, who was a Benedictine monk. As a young child, Gisela was very religious.\n\nAround the year 1000, Gisela married St. Stephan I, the first king of Hungary and became the Queen Consort. This marriage was part of his plan to westernize and Christianize Hungary. Militarily speaking, this plan worked very well because German knights came and helped him fight battles on account of Gisela.\n\nThe marriage made a big difference on a religious aspect as well. When Gisela was in Hungary, she opened Catholic convents and churches, which she helped to furnish. Gisela led a life of good Christian examples, which gave the rest of Hungary a model to follow. She also took care of the orphan sons of the king of England, whose position was taken over by an opponent.\n\nGisela’s own son, St. Emeric (b. 1007), who helped Christianize Hungary alongside his parents, died on a hunting trip in 1031. His death was soon followed by the death of his father, St. Stephen (b. 975), who died in 1038. They were canonized in the 11th century, at around the same time.\n\nAfter St. Stephen’s death, it was a hard time for Catholics in Hungary. There were many people who opposed Hungary becoming a Catholic country. Gisela and many other compatriots had to return to their homeland. Once Gisela and her servants were in Bavaria, Gisela joined a convent where she lived until she died around 1060 and was beatified in 1975. (Please note that, since Gisela of Hungary lived roughly 1000 years ago, dates will vary from source to source.)\n\nEven after the many years that have passed since her death, the life of Gisela of Hungary is still relevant today. She is someone Catholics everywhere can look up to as a model for living a good life and an inspiration to keep on loving God. This is one woman who I would love to see canonized within my lifespan, and I have no doubts that it will happen.\n\nBy Elisabeth Smith ‘28, Staff Writer"
