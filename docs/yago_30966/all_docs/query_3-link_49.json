He made the Hungarian monarchy hereditary by naming his infant son, Imre, his successor. He also made his court among the most brilliant in Europe. Béla adopted Roman Catholicism, sought the assistance of Rome, and established close ties with France. Upon the death of his first wife, Anne of Châtillon, he married Margaret, sister of Philip II Augustus of France. Many leading Hungarian diplomats were educated in Paris during his reign, and the Cistercian and Premonstratensian monks he invited to Hungary introduced advanced agricultural methods there.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
