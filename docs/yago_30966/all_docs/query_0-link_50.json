        "text": "Frederik I (October 7, 1471 – April 10, 1533) was King of Denmark and Norway. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch to reign over Denmark and Norway, when subsequent monarchs embraced Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation.\n\nAs King of Norway, Frederik is most remarkable in never having visited the country and was never crowned as King of Norway. Therefore, he was styled King of Denmark, the Vends and the Goths, elected King of Norway.\n\nFrederik’s reign began the enduring tradition of calling Kings of Denmark alternatively by the names Christian and Frederick, which has continued up to the reign of the current monarch, Margrethe II.\n\nFrederik was the younger son of the first Danish king of the House of Oldenburg, King Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1426–81) and of Dorothea of Brandenburg (1430–95), a Hohenzollern Princess and the daughter of Johann, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg became a Scandinavian Queen by marriage under the Kalmar Union. She was Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden from her marriage to King Christopher III of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1445 until King Christopher III died in 1448.\n\nQueen Dorothea was given a proposal from King Casimir IV of Poland and Albrecht VI, Archduke of Austria, but she chose to remain in Denmark and marry the newly elected king, Christian I of Denmark.\n\nKing Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg had three children:\n\n1. Johann, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Christina of Saxony.\n\n2. Margaret. She married King James III of Scotland\n\n3. Friedrich I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\n\nThe dynasty King Christian founded, the House of Oldenburg, remains on the throne of Denmark through the collateral branch, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (also known as Glücksburg). This royal house was on the throne of Norway until 1818, returning there again from 1905, and also on the throne of Sweden during Christian’s reign there and those of his son and grandson, but also 1751–1818.\n\nSoon after the death of his father, the underage Frederik was elected co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein in 1482, the other co-duke being his elder brother, King Johann of Denmark. In 1490 at Frederik’s majority, both duchies were divided between the brothers.\n\nIn 1500, he had convinced his brother King Johann to conquer Dithmarschen. A great army was called from not only the duchies, but with additions from all of the Kalmar Union for which his brother briefly was king. In addition, numerous German mercenaries took part. The expedition failed miserably, however, in the Battle of Hemmingstedt, where one-third of all knights of Schleswig and Holstein lost their lives.\n\nReign\n\nWhen his brother, King Johann, died, a group of Jutish nobles had offered Frederik the throne as early as 1513, but he had declined, rightly believing that the majority of the Danish nobility would be loyal to his nephew King Christian II.\n\nIn 1523, King Christian II was forced by disloyal nobles to abdicate as King of Denmark and Norway, and Frederik took the throne of Denmark in 1523 and was elected King of Norway in 1524.\n\nIt is not certain that Frederik ever learned to speak Danish. After becoming king, he continued spending most of his time at Gottorp, a castle and estate in the city of Schleswig.\n\nIn 1524 and 1525, King Frederik had to suppress revolts among the peasants in Agder, Jutland and Scania who demanded the restoration of King Christian II. The high point of the rebellion came in 1525 when Søren Norby, the governor (statholder) of Gotland, invaded Blekinge in an attempt to restore Christian II to power.\n\nHe raised 8000 men who besieged Kärnan (Helsingborgs slott), a castle in Helsingborg. Frederick’s general, Johann Rantzau, moved his army to Scania and defeated the peasants soundly in April and May 1525.\n\nKing Frederik played a central role in the spread of Lutheran teaching throughout Denmark. In his coronation charter, he was made the solemn protector (værner) of Roman Catholicism in Denmark. In that role, he asserted his right to select bishops for the Roman Catholic dioceses in the country.\n\nKing Christian II had been intolerant of Protestant teaching, but King Frederik took a more opportunist approach. For example, he ordered that Lutherans and Roman Catholics share the same churches and encouraged the first publication of the Bible in the Danish language. In 1526, when Lutheran Reformer Hans Tausen was threatened with arrest and trial for heresy, King Frederik appointed him his personal chaplain to give him immunity.\n\nStarting in 1527, King Frederik authorized the closure of Franciscan houses and monasteries in 28 Danish cities. He used the popular anti-establishment feelings that ran against some persons of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and nobility of Denmark as well as keen propaganda to decrease the power of bishops and Roman Catholic nobles.\n\nDuring his reign, King Frederik was skillful enough to prevent all-out warfare between Protestants and Roman Catholics. In 1532, he succeeded in capturing King Christian II who had tried to invade Norway, and to make himself king of the country.\n\nKing Frederik died on April 10, 1533 in Gottorp, at the age of 61, and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. Upon Frederik’s death, tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants rose to a fever pitch which would result in the Count’s Feud (Grevens Fejde).\n\nKing Frederik I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden was succeeded by King Christian III of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. He married Archduchess Isabella of Austria (18 July 1501 – 19 January 1526), also known as Elizabeth, the daughter of Archduke Philipp of Austria, Duke of Burgundy (also King Felipe I of Castile) and his wife Queen Joanna of Castile and the sister of Emperor Charles V. She ruled Denmark as regent in 1520.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1500 Prince Frederick of Denmark was betrothed to Princess Anna of Brandenburg (1487–1514), the daughter of Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg and Margaret of Thuringia, the daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia and Archduchess Anne of Austria, Duchess of Luxembourg suo jure. Archduchess Anne of Austria, was the eldest daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/King of Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the sole descendant of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBecause they were second cousins (Frederik’s mother Dorothea of Brandenburg was the cousin of Anna’s father, Johann Cicero, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg) their marriage required a Papal dispensation by Pope Alexander VI.\n\nIn addition, the marriage was not held until April 10, 1502 due to Princess Anna’s youth. In 1500 the year of their betrothal Princess Anna was 13 and Prince Frederik was 29. Two years later Princess Anna was 15 and Prince Frederik was 31 respectively.\n\nThe marriage, held in Stendal, was a double one: on the same day, Anna’s brother Joachim and Frederick’s niece Elisabeth were married.\n\nThe couple had two children:\n\n1. Christian III, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1503 – 1559)\n\n2. Dorothea of Denmark (1504 – 1547), married Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke of Prussia. Prior to her marriage to Prince Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach a marriage was suggested to the English claimant to the throne, Richard de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, who was supported by King François I of France, but without success.\n\nFrederick’s wife Anna died on May 5, 1514, aged 26 years old.\n\nFour years later on October 9, 1518 at Kiel, the 47 year-old Prince Frederik married Sophie of Pomerania (20 years old; 1498–1568), a daughter of Bogislaw “the Great”, Duke of Pomerania and the Polish princess, Anna Jagiellon, the fifth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans/Germany, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nSophie and Frederick had six children:\n\n1. Johann II of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev (1521 – 1580)\n\n2. Elizabeth of Denmark (14 October 1524 – 15 October 1586), married:\n\na) Duke Magnus III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nb) Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\n3. Adolph of Denmark, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (1526 – 1586)\n\n4. Anna of Denmark (1527 – 1535)\n\n5. Dorothea of Denmark (1528 – 1575), married to Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch.\n\n6. Frederik of Denmark (1532 – 1556), Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim and Bishop of Schleswig.\n\nJoan and her husband were together crowned in Pamplona Cathedral on March 5, 1329 as Queen Joan II and King Philippe III of of Navarre.\n\nBoth were raised up on a shield and both threw money during the ceremony. They signed a coronation oath, establishing their royal prerogatives. The charter underlined that Joan was the “true and natural heir” of Navarre, but also declared that “all of the Kingdom of Navarre would obey her consort”.\n\nHowever, the Navarrese also specified that both Joan and Philippe were to renounce the crown as soon as their heir reached twenty-one, or they were obliged to pay a fine of 100,000 livres. Joan also compensated her husband for his expenses connected to the acquisition of Navarre.\n\nReign\n\nJoan II and Philippe III of Navarre closely cooperated during their joint reign. Out of the eighty-five royal decrees preserved from the period of their joint rule, forty-one documents were issued in both names.\n\nHowever, the sources suggest that Philippe was more active in several fields of government, especially legislation. He signed thirty-eight decrees alone, without referring to his wife. Only six documents were issued exclusively in Joan’s name.\n\nAfter the coronation, the royal couple ordered the punishment of the perpetrators of the anti-Jewish riots and the paying of compensation to the victims. The royal fortresses were repaired and a new castle was built at Castelrenault during their reign.\n\nIrrigation system of the arid fields around Tudela was also constructed with the royal couple’s financial support. They also wanted to maintain peaceful relationship with the neighboring states. They opened negotiations about the betrothal of their firstborn daughter, Joan, to Infanta Pedro the heir of Aragon, already in 1329. A peace treaty with Castile was signed at Salamance on 15 March 1330.\n\nJoan and Philippe left Navarre in September 1331. Historian Elena Woodacre notes, the “royal couple had to balance the needs of their French territories alongside the rule of Navarre”, which forced them to split their time between all of their domains.\n\nJoan and Philippe could hardly get accustomed to the “tastes and customs of the Navarrese, and were alien to their language”, according to historian José María Lacarra, for which they were often absent from the kingdom. During the monarchs’ absence, French governors administered Navarre on their behalf.\n\nA border dispute over the ownership of the Monastery of Fitero developed into a war with Castille in 1335. King Pedro IV of Aragon supported the Navarrese and a new peace treaty with Castile was signed on February 28, 1336. Joan and Philippe returned to Navarre in April 1336. Their second visit lasted till October 1337. Philippe twice returned to the realm, but Joan did not accompany him.\n\nKing Philip III of Navarre died in September 1343. She soon replaced Philippe of Melun, who had administered Navarre in the royal couple’s name, with Guillaume of Brahe. Before long, she also dismissed Guillaume of Brahe, replacing him with Jean de Conflans.\n\nThese changes may have reflected a disagreement with Philippe of Melun over administration of Navarre, according to historian Elena Woodacre. In 1344, a copy of the Fueros of Navarre was arranged for the queen in the local Romance language (in ydiomate Navarre), providing a spare column for its translation to the ydioma galicanum (a French variant) eventually left a blank.\n\nFrench was probably the natural language used by Joan, even to deal with matters related with Navarre. Joan established the convent of San Francisco in Olite in 1345.\n\nJoan decided to again visit Navarre, but she never returned, most probably because of the possibility of an invasion of her family’s domains in France during the Hundred Years War.\n\nShe and her husband had supported King Philippe VI of France against King Edward III of England, who claimed the French throne as the son of Joan’s aunt Isabella. By 1346, however, Joan was disappointed by Philippe VI’s failures as military leader.\n\nIn November she boldly concluded a truce with the Earl of Lancaster, granting Edward’s troops free passage through her county of Angoulême in return for protection of her lands. She also promised not to build new fortification or allow Philippe VI’s army to use the existing ones. Philippe VI was unable to take action against her.\n\nQueen Joan II of Navarre died of Black Death on October 6, 1349. In her last will, she requested that her son finance a chapel in Santa Maria of Olite. She was buried in the Basilica of St Denis, though her heart was buried at the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris alongside that of her husband’s.\n\nFamily\n\nJoan’s husband, Philip of Évreux, was a grandson of King Philippe III of France. They were efficient as co-rulers but no evidence attests to the closeness of their personal relationship, in contrast to the well-documented marriages of Joan’s grandparents, father and uncles. This indicates that their marriage was marked neither by particular affection nor difficulty. They were very rarely apart, however, and had nine children together.\n\nJoan was succeeded by her eldest surviving son as King Charles II of Navarre (1349–1387), called Charles the Bad, who was Count of Évreux (1343–1387) from the death of his father.\n\nJoan II (January 28, 1312 – October 6, 1349) was Queen of Navarre from 1328 until her death. She was the only surviving child of King Louis X of France and Navarre, and Margaret of Burgundy, the second daughter of Robert II, Duke of Burgundy (1248–1306) and Agnes of France (1260–1327), the youngest daughter of King Louis IX of France and Margaret of Provence. As such, she was a member of House of Burgundy, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty.\n\nThe future King Louis X of France was born in Paris, the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre, daughter of King Henri I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois who was the elder child and only daughter of Robert I, Count of Artois, and Matilda of Brabant. Robert I, Count of Artois was the fifth (and second surviving) son of King Louis VIII of France and Infanta Blanche of Castile.\n\nKing Louis X inherited the Kingdom of Navarre on the death of his mother, on April 4, 1305, and was crowned on October 1, 1307. On September 21, 1305, at age 15, he married Margaret of Burgundy and they had a daughter, Joan.\n\nLouis’ first wife, Margaret of Burgundy implicated in the Tour de Nesle affair, was found guilty of infidelity and was imprisoned until her death on August 14, 1315. Louis and Clémentina of Hungary were married that same year. Clémentina of Hungary was the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou, the titular King of Hungary, and Clémentina of Austria, daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg. She was a member of the House of Habsburg.\n\nKing Louis X died within a year of his marriage on June 5, 1316 leaving a pregnant wife. According to an agreement of the most powerful French lords, which was completed on July 16, if Clémentina gave birth to a son, the son was to be crowned King of France, but if a daughter was born, she and Joan could only inherit the Kingdom of Navarre and the counties of Champagne and Brie (the three realms that Louis X had inherited from his mother, Joan I of Navarre).\n\nIt was also agreed that Joan was to be sent to her mother’s relatives in Burgundy, but her marriage could not be decided without the consent of the members of the French royal family.\n\nQueen Clémentina gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as Jean I of France but the infant King lived only five days. His death precipitate a succession crisis.\n\nKing Louis X’s only other child was Princess Joan from his first marriage to Margaret of Burgundy. However, Joan’s paternity was dubious because her mother was involved in a scandal, but King Louis X declared her his legitimate daughter before he died in 1316.\n\nJoan’s mother, Margaret of Burgundy, and the other daughters-in-law of King Philippe IV of France, Joan and Blanche of Burgundy, were involved in the Tour de Nesle affair, were accused of adultery and were arrested in 1314. They were charged with adultery with two knights, the brothers Philippe and Walter of Aunay.\n\nAfter being tortured, one of the brothers confessed that they had been the lovers of Margaret and Blanche for three years. The Aunay brothers were soon executed, and Margaret and Blanche were imprisoned. After the scandal, the legitimacy of Joan of France became dubious, because her mother was accused of having had an extramarital affair around the year of Joan’s birth.\n\nWith the death of the infant King Jean I of France the French lords were opposed to the idea of a female monarch and elected Louis X’s brother, Philippe, as King Philippe V of France. King Philippe immediately had himself crowned at Reims. However, his legitimacy was challenged by the party of Louis X’s daughter Joan.\n\nKing Philippe V successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General’s determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne. The succession of Philippe, instead of Joan, set the precedent for the French royal succession that would be known as the Salic law.\n\nThe Navarrese noblemen also paid homage to King Philippe V. Joan’s maternal grandmother, Agnes of France, and uncle, Odo IV of Burgundy, made attempts to secure the counties of Champagne and Brie (which had been the patrimony of Louis X’s mother, Joan I of Navarre) to Joan, but the French royal troops defeated her supporters.\n\nAfter Philippe V married his daughter to Odo IV of Burgundy and granted him two counties as her dowry, Odo renounced Joan’s claim to Champagne and Brie in exchange for a compensation in March 1318. Joan married Philippe of Évreux, who was also a member of the French royal family.\n\nPhilippe of Évreux was the son of Louis, Count of Évreux, a younger son of King Philippe III of France by his second wife, Marie of Brabant, a daughter of Henri III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.\n\nPhilippe’s father was the founder of the Capetian House of Évreux, while his mother, Margaret (d. 1311), belonged to another Capetian branch, the House of Artois.\n\nKing Philippe V was succeeded by his brother, Charles IV, in both France and Navarre in 1322, but most Navarrese lords refused to swear loyalty to him. After Charles IV died in 1328, the Navarrese expelled the French governor and declared Joan the rightful monarch of Navarre as Queen Joan II of Navarre. Her husband, Philippe of Évreux, became King Philippe III of Navarre by right of his wife. They ruled Navarre jointly.\n\nIn France, Philippe of Valois was crowned king as King Philippe VI of France. He concluded an agreement with Joan and her husband, who renounced Joan’s claims to Champagne and Brie in exchange for three counties, while Philip acknowledged their right to Navarre. Joan and her husband were together crowned in Pamplona Cathedral on March 5, 1329.\n\nThe royal couple closely cooperated during their joint reign, but Philippe of Évreux was more active. However, they mostly lived in their French domains, with Navarre being administered by governors during their absences.\n\nCharles the Bald (June 13, 823 – October 6 , 877), also known as Charles II, was a 9th-century king of West Francia (843–877), King of Italy (875–877) and Emperor of the Carolingian Empire (875–877). After a series of civil wars during the reign of his father, Louis the Pious, Charles succeeded, by the Treaty of Verdun (843), in acquiring the western third of the Empire.\n\nCharles the Bald was a grandson of Charlemagne and the youngest son of Louis the Pious by his second wife, Judith of Bavaria the daughter of Count Welf of Bavaria and Saxon noblewoman Hedwig. No surviving sources provide a record of Judith’s exact date and year of birth. Judith was probably born around 797.\n\nMost girls in the Carolingian world were married in adolescence, with twelve years as the minimum age, though her marriage to the 41-year-old King Louis occurred in 819, when she was probably around 22 years old.\n\nCharles the Bad was born on June 13, 823 in Frankfurt, when his elder brothers were already adults and had been assigned their own regna, or subkingdoms, by their father. The attempts made by Louis the Pious to assign Charles a subkingdom, first Alemannia and then the country between the Meuse and the Pyrenees (in 832, after the rising of Pepin I of Aquitaine) were unsuccessful.\n\nThe numerous reconciliations with the rebellious Lothair and Pepin, as well as their brother Louis the German, King of Bavaria, made Charles’s share in Aquitaine and Italy only temporary, but his father did not give up and made Charles the heir of the entire land which was once Gaul.\n\nAt a diet in Aachen in 837, Louis the Pious bade the nobles do homage to Charles as his heir. Pepin of Aquitaine died in 838, whereupon Charles at last received that kingdom, which angered Pepin’s heirs and the Aquitainian nobles.\n\nThe death of Emperor Louis I the Pious in 840 led to the outbreak of war between his sons. Charles allied himself with his brother Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the new Emperor Lothair I, and the two allies defeated Lothair at the Battle of Fontenoy-en-Puisaye on June 25, 841. In the following year, the two brothers confirmed their alliance by the celebrated Oaths of Strasbourg.\n\nThe war was brought to an end by the Treaty of Verdun in August 843. The settlement gave Charles the Bald the Kingdom of West Francia, which he had been up until then governing and which practically corresponded with what is now France, as far as the Meuse, the Saône, and the Rhône, with the addition of the Spanish March as far as the Ebro.\n\nLouis II the German received the eastern part of the Carolingian Empire, known then as East Francia and later evolved into the Kingdom of Germany which formed the core of what would become the holy Roman Empire.\n\nLothair retained the imperial title and the Kingdom of Italy. He also received the central regions from Flanders through the Rhineland and Burgundy Known as the Kingdom of Middle Francia.\n\nIn 875, after the death of the Emperor Louis II (son of his half-brother Emperor Lothair I), Charles the Bald, supported by Pope John VIII, traveled to Italy, receiving the Royal Crown at Pavia and the Imperial title in Rome on December 25th.\n\nAs Emperor, Charles combined the mottoes that had been used by his grandfather and father into a single formula: renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum, “renewal of the empire of the Romans and Franks”. These words appeared on his seal.\n\nLouis II the German, also a candidate for the succession of Emperor Louis II, revenged himself by invading and devastating Charles’s domains, and Charles had to return hastily to West Francia. After the death of Louis the German (August 28, 876), Charles in his turn attempted to seize Louis’s Kingdom of East Francia, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Andernach on October 8, 876.\n\nDeath and Burial\n\nIn the meantime, Pope John VIII, menaced by the Saracens, was urging Charles to come to his defence in Italy. Charles again crossed the Alps, but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his regent in Lombardy, Boso, and they refused to join his army.\n\nAt the same time Carloman, son of Louis II the German, entered northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of Mont Cenis at Brides-les-Bains, on October 6, 877.\n\nAccording to the Annals of St-Bertin, Charles was hastily buried at the Abbey of Nantua, Burgundy, because the bearers were unable to withstand the stench of his decaying body. A few years later, his remains were transferred to the Abbey of Saint-Denis where he had long wished to be buried, in a porphyry tub which may be the same one known as “Dagobert’s tub” (cuve de Dagobert), now in the Louvre. It was recorded that there was a memorial brass there that was melted down at the Revolution.\n\nCharles was succeeded by his son, who became King Louis III of West Francia. Charles was a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors from among the higher clergy, as in the case of Guenelon of Sens, who betrayed him, and of Hincmar of Reims.\n\nLouis I, the Pious (778 – June 20, 840) was King of the Franks and co-Emperor with his father, Charlemagne, from 813. He was also King of Aquitaine from 781. As the only surviving son of Charlemagne and Hildegard of the Vinzgau, he became the sole Carolingian Emperor and King of the Franks after his father’s death in 814, a position that he held until his death except from 833 to 834, when he was deposed.\n\nLouis was born in 778 while his father Charlemagne was on campaign in Spain, at the Carolingian villa of Cassinogilum, according to Einhard and the anonymous chronicler called Astronomus; the place is usually identified with Chasseneuil, near Poitiers.\n\nAt the time of Louis’ birth his father Charlemagne was King of the Franks since 768, and King of the Lombards since 774.\n\nHe was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife Hildegard of the Vinzgau (c. 754 – 783). Little is known about her life because like all other women related to Charlemagne, she became notable only from a political background with records on her parentage, wedding, death and role as a mother.\n\nLouis I had a twin brother named Lothair, who died young. Louis and Lothair were given names from the old Merovingian dynasty, possibly to suggest a connection.\n\nLouis is the French form of the Old Frankish given name Chlodowig (Clovis) and Clovis is the modern conventional French (and thence English) form of the Old Frankish name ᚺᛚᛟᛞᛟᚹᛁᚷ (in runic alphabet) or *”Hlōdowik” or “Hlōdowig” (in Latin alphabet), equivalent to the modern forms Louis (French), Lodewijk (Dutch), Lewis (English), and Ludwig (German).\n\nLouis was crowned King of Aquitaine as a three-year-old child in 781. In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by regents and a court.\n\nWhile at his palace of Doué, Anjou, Louis received news of his father’s death in 814. He rushed to Aachen and crowned himself emperor to shouts of Vivat Imperator Ludovicus by the attending nobles.\n\nLouis received a Papal coronation by Pope Stephen IV in Reims on October 5, 816. Pope Stephen IV Stephen belonged to a noble Roman family. When crowned Louis the Pious as Emperor he persuaded him to release some Roman political prisoners he held in custody. He returned to Rome, by way of Ravenna, sometime in November and died the following January.\n\nUpon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen in an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety on both sides, Emperor Louis’s first act was to purge the palace of what he considered undesirable. He destroyed the old Germanic pagan tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally “dissolute”, including some of his own relatives.\n\nHe quickly sent all of his many unmarried (half-)sisters and nieces to nunneries in order to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law. Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers Drogo, Hugh and Theoderic, he forced his father’s cousins, Adalard and Wala to be tonsured, sending them into monastic exile at St-Philibert on the island of Noirmoutier and Corbie, respectively, despite the latter’s initial loyalty.\n\nAlthough technically Louis the Pious was neither the King of France nor a Holy Roman Emperor, he did reign over both of the states that did eventually evolved into those entities and is therefore numbered as Louis I of France and as Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig I.\n\nAlso, since his name derives from the name Clovis it is possible he could have rained as King Clovis V of the Franks, given the fact that the last King of the Franks with that name, was Clovis IV of the Merovingian Dynasty, who reigned from circa 690/69 to circa 694/695.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: Oops, I meant to post this yesterday. 😊\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg (October 4, 1826 – December 3, 1898) was a daughter of King Wilhelm I of Württemberg and his wife, Princess Pauline Therese of Württemberg.\n\nHer father, King Wilhelm I of Württemberg was named Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Württemberg (known as “Fritz” until the beginning of his reign) and was the eldest son Prince Friedrich of Württemberg (1754–1816) who was the last Duke of Württemberg from 1797 to 1803, then the first and only Prince-Elector of Württemberg from 1803 to 1806, and then the first King of Württemberg when Württemberg was raised to a kingdom in 1806 with the approval of Napoleon I. King Friedrich was known for his size, 6 ft 11 in and about 440 lb.\n\nKing Wilhelm I of Württemberg’s mother was Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1764–1788), was the eldest child of Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and reigning Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his wife Princess Augusta of Great Britain, the first born child of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales and his wife Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg daughter of Friedrich II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1676–1732) and Magdalena Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst (1679–1740).\n\nPrincess Augusta of Great Britain was the first born grandchild of George II of Great Britain and Princess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the elder sister of King George III of the United Kingdom.\n\nDuchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was named in honour of her mother and grandmother. Augusta’s younger sister, Duchess Caroline, would marry her first cousin and the future King George IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg’s mother, Princess Pauline Therese of Württemberg was born in Riga, one of the five children of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and his wife, Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg, a daughter of Prince Charles Christian of Nassau-Weilburg and Carolina of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Willem IV, Prince of Orange and his wife Anne of Great Britain, Princess Royal and the second child and eldest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and his consort Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg’s siblings included Maria Dorothea, Archduchess of Austria; Amelia, Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen; Elisabeth Alexandrine, Princess of Baden, and Duke Alexander of Württemberg himself the founder of the Teck branch of the family.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg’s paternal grandparents were Friedrich II Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, and Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt, daughter of Margrave Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Prussia.\n\nShe was tutored by her governess, the known memoirist Alexandrine des Écherolles, who described her pupils in her memoirs.\n\nOn April 15, 1820 in Stuttgart, Pauline Therese married her first cousin King Wilhelm I of Württemberg. Pauline thus became Queen conrsort of Württemberg. As his third wife, their marriage was unhappy, particularly because of the deep attachment King Wilhelm showed to his mistress, the actress Amalia Stubenrauch.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg was the third and last child of her parents’ marriage. She was described as unattractive, but cheerful and wise.\n\nOn June 17, 1851, she married Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Hermann was the third son of Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792-1862) from his marriage to Ida of Saxe-Meiningen (1794–1852), the daughter of Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Prince Hermann was a nephew of Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the wife of King William IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrincess Augusta and Prince Hermann we’re the same age and he served in the Cavalry of Württemberg as an officer. Later that year, he was promoted from Rittmeister to lieutenant colonel. In 1853, he was promoted to commander of the guards regiment.\n\nWeimar Palace at Neckarstraße 25 was, for many years, the center of an artistically oriented social life. In 1865, Hermann left the army with the rank of lieutenant general, because he was denied further promotions. He had tried to become King Charles’s adjutant general and imperial governor of Alsace-Lorraine but was unsuccessful. For lack of other activities, Prince Weimar, as he was called in Stuttgart, supported social, patriotic and artistic societies.\n\nPrincess Augusta of Württemberg, Princess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach died on December 3, 1898, aged 72.\n\nPrincess Augusta and Prince Hermann had six children:\n\n1, Princess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1852-1904)\n\nmarried in 1873 to Hereditary Grand Duke Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1844-1894)\n\n2. Prince Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1853-1924)\n\nmarried in 1885 to Princess Gerta of Isenburg-Büdingen-Wächtersbach (1863-1945)\n\n3. Prince Bernhard Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1855-1907),\n\nin 1900 to Marie Louise Brockmüller (1866-1903)\n\nin 1905 to Countess Elisabeth von der Schulenburg (1869-1940)\n\n4. Prince Alexander of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1857-1891)\n\n5. Prince Ernest of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1859-1909)\n\n6. Princess Olga of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1869-1924)\n\nmarried in 1902 to Prince Leopold of Isenburg-Büdingen (1866-1933), eldest son of Charles, Prince of Isenburg-Büdingen.\n\nThe significance of the title of Emperor in Western Europe.\n\nFrom the time of Roman Emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337), the Roman Emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian Emperor in the Church.\n\nEmperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The Emperor’s role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.\n\nBoth the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.\n\nIn Western Europe, the title of Emperor in the West lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor, at least nominally well into the 6th century.\n\nWhile the reconquest of Emperor Justinian I had reestablished Byzantine presence in Italy, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Constantinople Church. Toward the end of the 8th century the Papacy still recognised the Emperor at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection.\n\nIn 800 Pope Leo III owed a great debt to Charlemagne, the King of the Franks and King of the Lombards, for securing his life and position. By this time, the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI has been deposed in 797 and replaced as monarch by his mother, Empress Irene.\n\nIrene of Athens was Byzantine Empress Consort to Emperor Leo IV from 775 to 780, regent during the childhood of their son Emperor Constantine VI from 780 until 790, co-ruler from 792 until 797, and finally Empress Regnant and sole ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire from 797 to 802.\n\nUnder the pretext that a woman could not rule the Empire, Pope Leo III declared the Imperial throne vacant and crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum), the successor of Constantine VI as Roman Emperor, using the concept of translatio imperii.\n\nTranslatio imperii (Latin for “transfer of rule”) is a historiographical concept that originated from the Middle Ages, in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an imperium that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an “emperor” (or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Holy Roman Empire).\n\nThe concept is closely linked to translatio studii (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (verses 39–40).\n\nThe Eastern Roman Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as Emperors, but as “Frankish” and “German Emperors”, at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.\n\nThe title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor title provided the highest prestige among medieval Roman Catholic monarchs, because the empire was considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. Thus, in theory and diplomacy, the Emperors were considered primus inter pares, regarded as first among equals among other Roman Catholic monarchs across Europe.\n\nWith the adoption of the title Emperor by the Grand Princes of Moscow this was perceived as a challenge, and threat, to the role and authority of the Holy Roman Emperors who were the only Emperors in Western Europe, and as we have seen, the defenders of Christianity and only successors of the Roman Empire.\n\nPart III will be about Peter the Great’s assumption of the Imperial designation.\n\nThe title of Tsar (alternatively Czar, Tzar or Csar) was a title used by Slavic monarchs. The term is derived from the Latin word Caesar.\n\nCaesar was a Cognomen which was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome, under Roman naming conventions. Initially, a Cognomen was a nickname, but lost that purpose when it became an hereditary name. Hereditary cognomen were used to augment the second name, the family name, or clan name in order to identify a particular branch within a family or family within a clan.\n\nIn Eastern European languages Caesar eventually evolved to mean “Emperor” in the European medieval sense of the term—a ruler with the same rank as a Roman Emperor, holding it by the approval of another Emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official such as the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the term Tsar was usually considered by Western Europeans to be equivalent to “King”. It lends its name to a system of government, Tsarit, Autocracy or Tsarism.\n\nThat is how I interpret the title of Tsar. I interpret the title of Tsar to mean King. In my view, from the time when Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, adopted the title of Tsar in 1484 until Tsar Peter I the Great was created Emperor of Russia on October 22, 1721, the monarchs of Russia that held the title of Tsar were actually Kings of Russia and not Emperors.\n\nIf the title of Tsar already meant “Emperor” prior to Peter the Great being created Emperor in 1721, then why was it necessary to grant the title of Emperor to Peter the Great?\n\nThat is what I see is the problem. In many English language publications both since the time when Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, adopted the title of Tsar in 1484 and even after Peter I the Great was created Emperor of Russia in 1721 the title of Tsar is translated as Emperor.\n\nTo restate it, Emperors and Empresses of Russia after Peter the Great are still refered to as Tsars of Russia in English publications. I’ve read where Nicholas II, proud of his Russian heritage, preferred the title of Tsar.\n\nLet’s examine how the title of Tsar was regarded in Russia.\n\nIn his dealings with the Habsburg Emperors, Ivan was offered the title of King (Rex) if he would join the alliance against Turkey, but he rejected such offers and continued his own policy, laying claim to the Kievan legacy and adopting the title of Autocrat, Sovereign of the Russian Land, and Grand Prince of Moscow and all Russia.\n\nHowever, beginning in 1484, Ivan began to use the title of Tsar in his foreign correspondence with secondary powers in Europe including the Livonian Order.\n\nAt times the title was translated as “Imperator” such as in a 1493 treaty with Denmark where Ivan was called “domino Johanne totius Rutzie imperator”. Ivan also began insisting on the title to the Habsburgs in 1489, and he continued to portray himself to his subjects and foreign states as the Orthodox Emperor of Russia.\n\nWhenever it was possible in diplomatic situations, Ivan and his representatives would refer to him as Tsar. According to Isabel de Madariaga, had the title of Russian monarchs continued to be translated as Rex, Russia’s assimilation into the ranking order of states in Europe would have been much easier.\n\nTherefore in Russia the Tsar did see themselves as Emperors while the rest of Europe saw the Russian rulers as Kings.\n\nThe problem of recognizing the Russian ruler as an Emperor lies in the concept of how the title of Emperor was seen and regarded in Western Europe.\n\nWe will examine that next in part II.\n\nAlys of the Franks, Countess of Vexin (October 4, 1160 – c. 1220), known in English as “Alice”, was a Frankish Princess, the daughter of Louis VII, King of the Franks and his second wife, Infanta Constance of Castile, a daughter of King Alfonso VII of Castile and León and Berengaria of Barcelona, but her year of birth is not known.\n\nBerengaria of Barcelona was the daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, and Douce I, Countess of Provence. Ramon Berenguer III was Count of Provence in the Holy Roman Empire through Jure uxoris (a Latin phrase meaning “by right of (his) wife”).\n\nLife\n\nAlys was the half-sister of Marie and Alix of the Franks, Louis VII’s children by Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the younger sister of Margaret of France. Just five weeks after Constance died giving birth to Alys, King Louis VII married Adèle of Champagne, by whom he had two further children, including the future King Philippe II Augusté of France.\n\nAdèle of Champagne was the third child and first daughter of Theobald II, Count of Champagne and Matilda of Carinthia, and had nine brothers and sisters. She was named after her paternal grandmother Adela of Normandy who was a daughter of King William I the Conqueror of England and his wife Matilda of Flanders.\n\nIn January 1169, King Louis VII and King Henry II of England signed a contract for the marriage between Alys and Henry’s son Richard the Lionheart. The 8-year-old Alys was then sent to England as Henry’s ward.\n\nIn 1177, Cardinal Peter of Saint Chrysogonus, on behalf of Pope Alexander III, threatened to place England’s continental possessions under an interdict if King Henry II did not proceed with the marriage.\n\nThere were widespread rumors that Henry had not only made Alys his mistress, but that she had a child with him. King Henry II died in 1189, and Richard, his eldest surviving son, ascended the English throne.\n\nKing Richard broke off Alys’ betrothal in 1190, during personal talks with her brother the French King, Philippe II Augusté, on their way towards the Holy Land during the Third Crusade, by appealing to the Christian limitations on affinity. Richard married Berengaria of Navarre on May 12, 1191.\n\nBerengaria of Navarre was the eldest daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre and Infanta Sancha of Castile, who was a daughter of King Alfonso VII of Castile and León and his first wife Infanta Berengaria of Barcelona. Infanta Sancha was the fifth child of seven born to her parents, and the sister of Infanta Constance of Castile, wife of King Louis VII of the Franks parents of Princess Alys of the Franks.\n\nThis means that Princess Alys of the Franks, first fiancé of Richard the Lionheart, was the first cousin of Richard’s eventual spouse, Berengaria of Navarre.\n\nKing Philippe II Augusté had offered Alys to Prince John of England, but Queen Eleanor (of Aquitaine) prevented the match. Alys married Guillaume IV Talvas, Count of Ponthieu, on August 20, 1195. They had two daughters: Marie, Countess of Ponthieu, and Isabelle; and a stillborn son named Jean."
