        "text": "Saint Stephen\n\nStephen Iᵉʳ or Saint Stephen, born around 975 and died on August 15, 1038, founded the Kingdom of Hungary, of which he became king in 1000 or 1001. Canonized in 1083 for the evangelization of his country, he is today considered a the patron saint of Hungary and celebrated by the Catholic Church on August 16.\n\nKing St Etienne consecrated his country to the Virgin Mary. Hungary was the first country to be consecrated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Hungary was surely touched by the Heart of God, because He chose this country to give his Flame of Love to the world.\n\nWe are all proud to see Hungary being at the forefront of the Flame of Love Movement. Elizabeth was therefore the first to be worthy of this marvelous gift for humanity.\n\nDuring their trip to Hungary on August 11, 2011,\n\nChristine Le Beau and Marcel Dufour the Canadian coordinator visited the historic places of Budapest during an international congress with the international coordinators Guilerme Morais and Rosalia his wife. Here is a photo of the crown of King Stephen of Hungary kept in the historic royal palace.\n\n1914 - 1918\n\nHungary was very hard hit during the First World War by losing two thirds of its territory.\n\n1939 - 1945\n\nDuring the Second World War it was the terrible invasion by Germany. After the war, the Soviet Union occupied Hungary until 1990. Although communism was established throughout the country, Hungary never lost its faith.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nThe Incredible Story\n\nOf Hungary and its people who have lived through so many hardships for more than a thousand years\n\nand who nevertheless knew how to keep his Catholic faith.\n\nHungarians or Magyars, Ugric people living in Hungary, nearly 9.75 million and constituting significant minorities in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine; in Canada there are nearly 28,000 and in the United States nearly 1.5 million. Hungarians are Christians, mostly Catholics; they speak Hungarian. Hungary is called the pearl of the Danube.\n\nThe history of Hungary dates back to the High Middle Ages when the Pannonian plain was colonized by the Magyars, a nomadic people from the center-north of present-day Russia.\n\n_______________________________\n\nThe Ottomans (Muslims) of Turkey, eternal conquerors, had set their sights on Eastern and Central Europe, the invasion of Hungary was inevitable.\n\nCrowned, Suleiman the Magnificent (Muslim), equipped a large army of almost 400,000 men and 30,000 camels, 40,000 horses and 300 cannons.\n\n1526\n\nHe marched on Catholic Hungary and despite the heroism of his defenders, he disintegrated the army in less than 48 hours. Then he arrived in Buda, present-day Budapest, He set fire to it. The Hungarian ruler \"Louis ll\" was martyred in the Battle of the Mohacs. (Left photo) The reason for this battle was the Hungarians' refusal to accept the Islamic religion. Louis had asked the Ottomans why they attacked Hungary; they replied that it is because Hungarians are disbelievers or kafirs. Suleiman the Magnificent completed the occupation, and Hungarians (men, women and children) were soon sold in the Istanbul slave market, numbering 100,000.\n\n_______________________________\n\n1527\n\nIn the slave markets which competed with that of Istanbul, that is to say in the bazaars of Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo and Algiers, three million Hungarian slaves were also sold. But was not even satisfied with that. In fact, to create the Islamic State of Europe, he equipped a second army, and 400 new guns.\n\n1529\n\nSuleiman the Magnificent set out from Hungary to conquer Austria. The ultra-Catholic Austria, which was now considered the bulwark of Christianity. He failed to conquer her. After 5 weeks of vain attacks, he preferred to beat a retreat. But in withdrawing, he massacred 30,000 peasants. …\n\nHungary had no hate interest towards the Turks, they did nothing towards the Ottomans. It took them 500 years before Hungary got rid of Islam. Today there are nearly 32,000 Muslims in Hungary, their history is largely based on the ancient occupation of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire, Islam, coming from Turkey.\n\n_______________________________\n\n1962 – 1982\n\nThe Lord Jesus and the Virgin Mary choose a Hungarian, Elisabeth Kindelmann, to give the messages of the Flame of Love to the whole world.\n\n1962\n\nApril 13\n\n“I am your gentle and understanding Mother, and in union with you I will save you.\n\nKing Saint Stephen consecrated his country to me, and I promised him that I would welcome into my heart his intercession and that of the Hungarian saints.\n\nI would like to put a new instrument in your hands. I urge you to accept it, understanding its importance, for my Heart looks upon my country with affliction.\"\n\n1962\n\n1st of August\n\n“My little one, there are many souls like yours in my country (Hungary). But, united to you, I cover them with my maternal mantle and I hide their beggar souls from the eyes of my holy Son for fear. lest He be sad because of you.\"\n\n_______________________________\n\nNovember 4\n\n\"The Hungarian saints beg me with ineffable joy, my little Carmelite, so that my Flame of Love should be kindled as soon as possible in their country.\"\n\n\"My little one, the intercession of Saint Emeric for the youth is the most moving prayer of all the Hu00ngarian saints.\"\n\n(Saint Emeric was the son of Saint Stephen, first king of Hungary. Educated with great care in the Christian faith, he died while still young during a hunting party, in the year 1031. His feast day is celebrated on November 5 .)"
