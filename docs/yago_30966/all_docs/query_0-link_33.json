        "text": "For other people named Constance of Aragon, see Constance of Aragon (disambiguation).\n\nConstance of Aragon (1318–Montpellier, 1346) was the eldest daughter of Alfonso IV of Aragon and his first wife Teresa d'Entença. She was born into the House of Aragon. She married James III of Majorca, she married into the House of Barcelona and became Queen consort of Majorca as a result.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nConstance was born in 1318 and was not only the eldest daughter but also the eldest child that survived to adulthood. Constance had two surviving brothers Peter IV of Aragon and James I of Urgell.\n\nWhen Constance was nine years old in 1327, her mother Teresa died in childbirth, the son called Sancho only lived a few days. In 1329 Constance's father remarried to Eleanor of Castile, from this marriage Constance gained two half-siblings Ferdinand, Marquis of Tortosa and John of Aragon.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were James II of Aragon and Blanche of Anjou, daughter of Charles II of Naples and his wife Maria of Hungary. Constance's maternal grandparents were Gombaldo, Baron of Enteça and Constanza de Antillòn.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1324, James III of Majorca became King of Majorca upon the death of his uncle Sancho of Majorca. James wished to make friendly relations with Aragon, in order to do this he married Constance. Though the kings of Majorca traditionally swore an oath of fealty to the kings of Aragon, James claimed that no king could have lordship over any other king.\n\nThe couple were married at Perpignan on 24 September 1336.[1]\n\nIn 1342 James refused to render the oath of fealty to Constance's brother Peter IV of Aragon. He was supported, however, by the doctors of the University of Montpellier and by an Aragonese troubadour, Thomàs Périz de Fozes, who wrote a poem in his defence.\n\nJames and Constance were married for ten years in this time they had two children:\n\nJames (c. 1336 – January 20, 1375), pretender to Majorca. He married Joan I of Naples, he died childless.\n\nIsabella (1337–1406), claimed her rights to Majorca after the death of her brother but abandoned claim. Married firstly to John II, Marquess of Montferrat, had issue. Married secondly to Baron Konrad von Reischach zu Jungnau, had issue.\n\nIn a short war (1343–44) James (and supposedly Constance) was driven out of Majorca by Constance's brother King Peter, who reannexed the Balearic Islands to the Crown.\n\nTwo years later in 1346, Constance died at Montpellier. She was outlived by James and her two children. Her husband remarried the following year to Violante of Vilaragut, who gave him one short-lived daughter. Violante helped arrange Isabella's marriage to John II[2]\n\nReferences\n\nConstance of Aragon, Queen of Majorca\n\nBorn: circa 1318 Died: circa 1346 Royal titles Preceded by\n\nMaria of Anjou Queen consort of Majorca\n\n1336–1344 Succeeded by\n\nMaria of Navarre Countess consort of Roussillon\n\n1336–1344 Countess consort of Cerdanya\n\n1336–1344 Lady of Montpellier\n\n1336–1346 Succeeded by\n\nViolante of Vilaragut Titles in pretence Loss of title\n\nKingdom annexed\n\nQueen consort of Majorca\n\n1344–1346 Succeeded by\n\nViolante de Vilaragut Loss of title\n\nPrincipality annexed\n\nPrincess consort of Achaea\n\n1336–1346"
