        "text": "London, October 1201\n\nJohn I of England\n\n\"I would want my niece, Eleanor to marry Alfonso of Portugal now that she is no longer a threat if her brother disappears, this alliance is important to England as my marriage to Isabella of Angouleme is important as well.\"\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine\n\n\"Yes, you can use her as an alliance bait as Constance of Brittany already has another son, she is not a threat if Arthur dies since she will have no lands to inherit.\"\n\nJohn I of England\n\n\"I know that Philippe wants to marry my niece, Eleanor and this would block his plans to marry her and I don't think I can allow that to happen, I had plans to marry, a Portuguese Princess but now I will use my beloved niece as the treaty and marriage bait with Portugal, my niece is not the heiress of Brittany, she can be used for a marriage alliance since the heir of Brittany at this point is Conan, the younger brother of Arthur.”\n\nEleanor of Brittany\n\nJohn I would send emissaries to Portugal in order to advance an alliance and betrothal between Eleanor of Brittany and Alfonso II of Portugal, John would send a retinue to Brittany and Anjou to fetch Eleanor of Brittany to Portugal for her to meet Alfonso II of Portugal, she would not see her brother, her sister or step-father again, nor know about the death of her full-blooded brother due to his defeat and death in the battle of Mirabeau, the marriage was a diplomatic success as she would be distanced away from the crown of England and would not be married to Philippe Auguste as he is said to be trying.\n\nOn her arrival in Portugal before the spring of 1202, the King and Queen of Portugal would gladly see her as she would be ready to give birth to heirs with her husband, however, her English retinue were dismissed.\n\nIn 1212 her husband became king and she became queen. Afonso II indicated in his will in 1214 that Eleanor of Brittany should be the regent for his heir should he pre-decease her, which she would not do as when her husband had died her son would be in the age of Majority.\n\nIssue\n\nSancho II of Portugal b. 1203\n\nEnrique of Portugal, Duke of Boulogne and Evreux b. 1204 m.

It concerned bringing an end to the war over the Duchy of Normandy and finalizing the new borders of what was left of the duchy. The treaty was a victory for Philip in asserting his legal claims to over lordship over John's French lands. A consequence of the treaty was the separation of the Channel Islands from Normandy.\n\nThe terms of the treaty signed at Le Goulet, an island in the middle of the Seine river near Vernon in Normandy, included clarifications of the feudal relationships binding the monarchs. Philip recognized John as King of England, heir to his brother Richard I, and thus formally abandoned his prior support for Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the son of John's late brother, Geoffrey II of Brittany. John, meanwhile, formally recognized the new status of the lost Norman territories by acknowledging the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders as vassals of the kings of France, not those of England, and recognized Philip as the suzerain of the continental lands in the Angevin Empire. John also bound himself not to support any rebellions on the part of the counts of Boulogne and Flanders.\n\nPhilip had previously recognized John as suzerain of Anjou and the Duchy of Brittany, but with the treaty of le Goulet he extorted 20,000 marks sterling as \"relief\" in payment for recognition of John's sovereignty of Brittany.\n\nThe treaty also included territorial concessions by John to Philip. The Vexin (except for Les Andelys, where Château Gaillard, vital to the defence of the region, was located) and the Évrécin in Normandy, as well as Issoudun, Graçay, and the fief of André de Chauvigny in Berry were to be removed from Angevin suzerainty and put directly into that of France.\n\nThe Duchy of Aquitaine was not included in the treaty. It was still held by John as heir to his still-living mother, Eleanor. The treaty would confirm the earlier agreement made by Richard wherein Urraca of Castile, who took the name Eleanor, his niece from Eleanor, Queen of Castile, married Philip's eldest son, Louis VIII of France (to be eventually known as Louis the Lion). Philip declared John deposed from his fiefs for failure to obey a summons in 1202 and war broke out again. Philip moved quickly to seize John's lands in Normandy, strengthening the French throne in the process.\n\nChildren of Urraca of Castile and Louis VIII\n\nEleanor b. 1204 married to Theobald I of Navarre\n\nPhilip III of France b.

However, he later became suspicious of John and fled back to Angers. Some unidentified source said that in April 1203, Arthur was again betrothed, this time to Marie of France, a daughter of Philip II and Agnes of Andechs-Merania due to him being unsatisfied with the possible arrangement with John in the division of inheritance concerning of Anjou and Normandy.\n\nAfter his return to France, and with the support of Philip II, Arthur planned to cooperate against John in 1203 and have a betrothal with Philip II’s daughter, Marie of France, however, he would die in action during the war of John I with Philipp Auguste, Conan V of Brittany would take over over the Duchy and Eleanor of Brittany would be distanced from the crown of England due to her marriage with the King of Portugal herself and this would solidify the reign of John I of England until 1216 as well as his alliance with the Portuguese.\n\nSanchia of Aragon\n\nOn 1204, Constance of Aragon would give birth to a daughter named Constance of Hungary and her husband, Emeric of Hungary would recover which would be followed by another son named Emeric on 1206, named after her husband.\n\nSanchia of Aragon on 1208 would get a betrothal with Frederick II of Sicily and the marriage treaty between the Kingdom of Sicily and Aragon was signed in order to aid the annulment of Peter II’s marriage with Maria of Montpellier, however, Maria of Montpellier herself would die on 1211 which would mean that Peter II would be able to arrange a marriage with a heiress of Jerusalem, however, it is Alice of Jerusalem who would be available to marry him, the marriage would bring an Aquitainian alliance for Peter II.\n\nOn 1209, the ships carrying Sanchia of Aragon would arrive in Sicily and she would marry Frederick II, she would be able to give birth to three children, namely, Henry of Swabia b. 1210, Constance of Swabia b. 1212 and Frederick of Swabia b. 1216, she would die of Malaria on 1220, allowing Frederick II to remarry to Isabella of England, one of the daughters of the king of Leon.\n\nCoronation of Henry III of England\n\nMathew de Paris: “On 1214, John I and Louis VIII of France would battle regarding the throne due to the invitation of the Barons.”\n\nPhilip III: ‘’My father, Louis VIII and Henry III of England would continue the war between Louis VIII and John I.”\n\nMathew de Paris: “yes, my majesty! And Henry III would be chosen by the barons..”\n\nMathew de Paris: “I also remember there is a rumor that one of the crowns was given by one of the regents to the King of England to the Queen of Portugal, Leonor.”\n\nPhilip III: “A part of the rumor is that Leonor, the Queen of Portugal would give the crown to her daughter along with her claims to England and the Angevin lands to Constance of Portugal who embarked towards England on 1220 and it is the crown that she is using right now.”\n\nMathew de Paris: “Leonor has two other daughters, Matilda, the wife of Philip, duke of Swabia(1206) and Eleanor, the Queen of Denmark, wife of Valdemar III of Denmark, however there is still a claim to Gascony by the Castilians led by Henry I of Castile”\n\nChildren of Eleanor of England\n\nBerengaria of England b. 1180\n\n-Eleanor, Countess of Toulouse b. 1198 m.
