        "text": "There was a short Interregnum after the Imperial title became extinct within the Carolingian Dynasty before being resurrected by King Otto I the Great of East Francia. As mentioned in my last blog entry, the Holy Roman Empire is seen as having had its start with the Coronation of King Otto I the Great of East Francia by Pope John XII on February 2, 962.\n\nDuring the period of the Holy Roman Empire (936 – 1806) there were three Emperors by the name of Friedrich as follows below.\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa (December 1122 – June 10, 1190), was a member of the Hohenstaufen Dynasty and was, by inheritance, Duke of Swabia as Duke Friedrich III 1147–1152. Friedrich Barbarossa was elected King of Germany-Romans in Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152.\n\nHe was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia and crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV on June 18, 1155 in Rome. He was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1155 until his death 35 years later in 1190.\n\nTwo years later, the term sacrum (“Holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his Empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178.\n\nEmperor Friedrich I also was given the secondary name Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which in English means “Emperor Redbeard.” The prevalence of the Italian nickname, even in later German usage, reflects the centrality of the Italian campaigns to his career.\n\n~~\n\nFriedrich II (December 26, 1194 – December 13, 1250) was King of Sicily from 1198, King of Germany from 1212, King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 and King of Jerusalem from 1225. He was the son of Emperor Heinrich VI of the Hohenstaufen Dynasty and Queen Constance I of Sicily of the Hauteville dynasty.\n\nHe ruled a vast area, beginning with Sicily and stretching through Italy all the way north to Germany. As the Crusades progressed, he acquired control of Jerusalem and styled himself its king. However, the Papacy became his enemy, and it eventually prevailed.\n\nViewing himself as a direct successor to the Roman Emperors of antiquity, he was Emperor of the Romans from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death; he was also a claimant to the title of King of the Romans from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. As such, he was King of Germany, of Italy, and of Burgundy.\n\nAfter the death of Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV (of Brunswick) the German princes, supported by Pope Innocent III, again elected Friedrich, King of Germany in 1215, and he was crowned king in Aachen on July 23, 1215 by one of the three German archbishops.\n\nIt was not until another five years had passed, and only after further negotiations between Friedrich II, Pope Innocent III, and Pope Honorius III – who succeeded to the papacy after Innocent’s death in 1216 – that Friedrich was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Pope Honorius III, on November 22, 1220. At the same time, Emperor Friedrich’s oldest son, Prince Heinrich, took the title of King of the Romans.\n\nUnlike most Holy Roman emperors, Emperor Friedrich II spent only a few years in Germany.\n\nAfter his death, his line did not survive, and the House of Hohenstaufen came to an end.\n\n~~\n\nFriedrich III (September 21, 1415 – August 19, 1493) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death in 1493.\n\nPreviously there had been two members of the House of Habsburg to rule over German lands: they were, Rudolph I (1273 –1291) and Albrecht I (1298 — 1308). However, they both ruled as Kings of Germany and none of them were crowned Emperors.\n\nFriedrich III was the first member of the House of Habsburg to bear the Imperial Title. He was the penultimate Emperor to be crowned by Pope Paul II and the last to be crowned in Rome.\n\nFriedrich III was the eldest son of the Inner Austrian Duke Ernst the Iron, a member of the Leopoldian line of the Habsburg Dynasty, and his second wife Cymburgis of Masovia. Prior to his imperial coronation and according to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, the Leopoldinian branch ruled over the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or what was referred to as Inner Austria.\n\nFriedrich III was elected and crowned King of Germany-Romans in 1440. His reign of 53 years is the longest in the history of the Holy Roman Empire or the German monarchy. Upon his death in 1493 he was succeeded by his son Archduke Maximilian, as Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nConstance of Aragon (1179 – 23 June 1222) was an Aragonese infanta who was by marriage firstly Queen of Hungary, and secondly Queen of Germany-the Romans and Sicily and Holy Roman Empress. She was regent of Sicily from 1212 to 1220.\n\nShe was the second child and eldest daughter of the nine children of King Alfonso II of Aragon and Infanta Sancha of Castile, who was was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of Castile by his second wife, Richeza of Poland.\n\nQueen of Hungary\n\nKing Alfonso II of Aragon died in 1196 and Infanta Constance’s fate was decided by the new King, her brother King Pedro II of Aragon, who arranged her marriage with King Emeric of Hungary. The wedding took place in 1198. Two years later, in 1200, the Queen gave birth to a son, called Ladislaus.\n\nWhen King Emeric was dying, he crowned his son Ladislaus co-ruler on August 26, 1204. The King wanted to secure his succession and had his brother Andrew promise to protect the child and help him govern the Kingdom of Hungary until reaching adulthood. King Emeric died three months later, on November 30, 1204.\n\nLadislaus succeeded his father as King Ladislaus III of Hungary while Prince Andrew became his Regent. Prince Andrew soon took over all regal authority while King Ladislaus III and Queen Constance were little more than his prisoners. Queen Constance managed to escape to Vienna with Ladislaus.\n\nThe two found refuge in the court of Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, but King Ladislaus III would soon die (May 7, 1205). The former Regent and now King Andrew II of Hungary took the body of his nephew and buried him in the Royal Crypt of Székesfehérvár. Duke Leopold VI of Austria sent Queen Constance back to Aragon.\n\nQueen of Sicily and Holy Roman Empress\n\nWhen Queen Constance returned to Aragon, she took up residence with her mother, Queen Sancha, in the Abbey of Nuestra Senora, at Sijena; Queen Sancha had founded the abbey after her husband’s death, and now lived there in retirement. Queen Constance spent the next three years in the abbey with her mother, until her fate, again, was changed by her brother.\n\nKing Pedro II of Aragon wanted to be on good terms with Pope Innocent III, since he wanted an annulment of his marriage with Maria of Montpellier, and needed the blessing of the Pope. Pope Innocent III solicited the hand of the Dowager Queen Constance of Hungary for his pupil, the young Friedrich II, King of the Romans and Sicily.\n\nThe Aragonese King accepted the proposal; Constance left her mother and the abbey of Nuestra Senora and began her trip to Sicily (1208). She never returned to Aragon or saw her mother again. Queen Sancha died shortly after the departure of her daughter.\n\nConstance and Friedich were married in the Sicilian city of Messina on August 15, 1209. In the ceremony, she was crowned Queen of Sicily. By this time, Constance was thirty years old and her new husband only fourteen. Two years later, in 1211, Constance gave birth to a son, called Heinrich, who later had a tragic end.\n\nOn December 9, 1212, Friedrich was crowned King of Germany in opposition to Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor. During the absence of her husband, Constance stayed in Sicily as Regent of the Kingdom until 1220.\n\nAt first Friedich controlled Southern Germany and Otto IV was effectively deposed on 5 July 1215. This time Constance was crowned German Queen with her husband.\n\nPope Honorius III crowned Friedrich as Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II on November 22, 1220. Queen Constance was crowned Holy Roman Empress while their son Heinrich became the new King of Germany-Romans. She died of malaria less than two years later in Catania and was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo, in a Roman sarcophagus with a crown, the Crown of Constance.\n\nEmperor Heinrich VI tried to make the imperial crown hereditary. Heinrich VI tried to secure the Imperial election for his son infant Friedrich as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop Adolf of Cologne.\n\nSpending the winter in Hagenau Castle, the Emperor and his ministeriales evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular Princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary too and also to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Heinrich agreed to consider these demands.\n\nAt the Diet of Würzburg, held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolph of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several Princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.\n\nWhile in July 1196 Emperor Heinrich VI proceeded to Burgundy and Italy in order to negotiate with Pope Celestine III, the resistance in Germany grew.\n\nAt the following diet at Erfurt in October, a majority of the Princes rejected the Emperor’s plans. Furthermore, the Pope, still concerned in view of the Hohenstaufen rule over Sicily, broke off the talks.\n\nNevertheless, on Christmas Day Emperor Heinrich VI’s son Friedrich II was elected King of the Romans in Frankfurt.\n\nEmperor Heinrich VI pledged to go on crusade in 1195 and began preparations. A revolt in Sicily was crushed in 1197. The Crusaders set sail for the Holy Land that same year but Emperor Heinrich VI who was just 32 years old, died unexpectedly at Messina on September 28, 1197 before he could join them.\n\nHis untimely death created an unrest in the circles of the princes about the future direction of the Empire.\n\nThe significance of creating Heinrich’s minor son King of the Romans was to indicate that Friedrich II was to inherit both the Kingdom of Sicily and the Imperial crown.\n\nBut with the death of Emperor Heinrich VI Friedrich’s accession was contested.\n\nA number of princes around Archbishop Adolf of Cologne elected the Welf Otto of Brunswick, son of Duke Henry III-XII the Lion, of Saxony and Bavaria as anti-king of the Romans.\n\nTo defend the claims of the Hohenstaufen Dynasty, Friedrich’s uncle Prince Philipp of Swabia had himself elected King of the Romans in March 1198.\n\nThere were now opposing forces to the hitherto stable position of the Hohenstaufens, as had already been demonstrated by the failure of the Henry VI’s Erbreichsplan or “plan for hereditary succession”.\n\nThe princes were now faced with the question as to whether they would recognize Henry’s son, Frederick II, now only three years old, as successor.\n\nAlthough Friedrich had already been elected King of the Romans at the end of 1196 in Frankfurt under the heavy influence of the Archbishop of Mainz, Konrad von Wittelsbach, and Duke Philipp of Swabia, the temptation to switch support away from the former ruling house grew.\n\nFriedrich’s rise to power was completed on 25 July 25, 1215, in Aachen, when he once again crowned himself king; this time at the right place. He had long before paid the price for Pope Innocent III’s support of his bid for the throne.\n\nOn July 12, 1213, he had granted a great privilege to the Church: the Golden Bull of Eger, in which he once again recorded in writing the concessions he had already made to the Curia.\n\nIt included recognition of the freedom of episcopal elections, the lands recovered by the Papacy, the Pope’s sovereignty over Sicily, and the assurance of aid against heretics. This was now no longer a secret agreement, but was reiterated in the form of a solemn privilege signed by princes and imperial ministeriales.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily\n\nBy the 11th century, mainland southern Lombard and Byzantine powers were hiring Norman mercenaries, who were descendants of Vikings in northern France; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily, taking it away from the Sicilian Muslims.\n\nAfter taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of Sicily and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but the most crucial battle was the Siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.\n\nSicily was granted, pending its Christian reconquest, to Robert Guiscard as “duke” in 1059 by Pope Nicholas II. Then Guiscard granted it as a County to his brother Roger, who became Grand Count Roger I of Sicily, from 1071 to 1101. Roger I was succeeded as Grand Count of Sicily by his son, Roger II, from his third wife Adelaide del Vasto.\n\nThe Norman Kingdom of Sicily was created on Christmas Day, 1130, by Grand Count Roger II of Sicily, with the agreement of Pope Innocent II. Roger II united the lands he had inherited from his father, Roger I of Sicily.\n\nKing Roger II’s son and successor was King William I of Sicily, known as “William the Bad”, though his nickname derived primarily from his lack of popularity with the chroniclers, who supported the baronial revolts which William suppressed. His reign ended in peace in 1166.\n\nHis elder son Roger IV, Duke of Apulia had been killed in previous revolts, and his son and successor, King William II, was a minor. Until the end of the boy’s regency by his mother Margaret of Navarre in 1172, turmoil in the kingdom almost brought the ruling family down.\n\nThe reign of William II is remembered as two decades of almost continual peace and prosperity. For this more than anything, he is nicknamed “the Good”. However, he had no issue, which led to a succession crisis: his aunt Constance, the sole heir to the throne as the daughter of King Roger II, was long confined in a monastery as a nun, with her marriage beyond consideration due to a prediction that “her marriage would destroy Sicily”.\n\nNevertheless, in 1184, she was betrothed to Henry, the eldest son of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor and the future Emperor Henry VI. William named Constance and Henry the heirs to the throne and had the noblemen swear oath, but the officials did not want to be ruled by a German, so the death of King William II in 1189 led the kingdom to decline.\n\nWith the support of the officials, Tancred of Lecce seized the throne. In the same year, he had to contend with the revolt of his distant cousin Roger of Andria, a former contender who supported Henry and Constance but was tricked to execution in 1190, as well as the invasion of Henry VI, King of Germany and Holy Roman Emperor since 1191, who invaded on behalf of his wife.\n\nHenry had to retreat after his attack failed, with Empress Constance captured and only released under the pressure of the Pope. Tancred died in 1194, and Constance and Henry prevailed: the kingdom fell in 1194 to the House of Hohenstaufen.\n\nKing William III of Sicily, the young son of Tancred, was deposed, and Henry and Constance were crowned as King and queen of Sicily. Through Constance, the Hauteville blood was passed to their son, Frederick, who reigned in Sicily as Frederick I.\n\nHohenstaufen kingdom\n\nIn 1197, the accession of King Frederick I of Sicily, a child who would also become Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II in 1220, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily.\n\nFor a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king’s young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick’s inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198.\n\nMeanwhile, Pope Innocent III had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick’s rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily over the next decade and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm.\n\nThe Great Moravian realm was was the first major state that was predominantly West Slavic to emerge in the area of Central Europe, possibly including territories which are today part of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Ukraine.\n\nBohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to Arnulf of Corinthia, King of East Francia in 895. Arnulf of Corinthia was also the disputed King of Italy from 894 and the disputed Emperor from February 22, 896, until his death at Regensburg, Bavaria.\n\nBohemia was at first ruled by the Přemyslid Dynasty. The dynasty’s origin dates back to the 9th century, when the Přemyslids ruled a tiny territory around Prague, populated by a tribe of the Western Slavs. Gradually they expanded, conquering much of the region of Bohemia, located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by the expansion of the Frankish Empire. The first historically-documented Přemyslid duke was Bořivoj I (867). DNA testing on the remains of his son, Spytihněv I, reveal the family’s Y-haplogroup to be R1b, second most common haplogroup in Czech republic.\n\nWhile the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dyntasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I the Great. Late Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in 935, became the land’s patron saint.\n\nWhile the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid Dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of Emperor Heinrich II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.\n\nAlthough some former rulers of Bohemia had enjoyed a non-hereditary royal title during the 11th and 12th centuries (Vratislaus II, Vladislaus II), the kingdom was formally established in 1198 by Přemysl Ottokar I, who had his status acknowledged by Philipp of Swabia, elected King of the Romans, in return for his support against the rival Emperor Otto IV.\n\nIn 1204 Ottokar’s royal status was accepted by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. It was officially recognized in 1212 by the Golden Bull of Sicily issued by Emperor Friedrich II, elevating the Duchy of Bohemia to Kingdom status and proclaiming its independence which was also later bolstered by future king of Bohemia and emperor Charles IV, with his golden bull in 1356.\n\nUnder these terms, the King of Bohemia was to be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the bishop of Prague was revoked. The king’s successor was his son Wenceslaus I, from his second marriage.\n\nThe King of Bohemia was a Prince-Elector of the Empire. The Kings of Bohemia, besides the region of Bohemia itself, also ruled other lands belonging to the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg, and Bavaria.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bohemia was later ruled by the House of Luxembourg, the Jagiellonian Dynasty, and from 1526 the House of Habsburg and its successor, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. From 1526 until the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the Kingdom of Bohemia was part of the greater Habsburg Hereditary Lands.\n\nNumerous kinrgs of Bohemia were also elected Holy Roman Emperors, and the capital, Prague, was the imperial seat in the late 14th century, and again at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the territory became part of the Habsburg Austrian Empire, and subsequently the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867. Bohemia retained its name and formal status as a separate Kingdom of Bohemia until 1918, known as a Crown Land within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and its capital Prague was one of the empire’s leading cities.\n\nThe Czech language (called the Bohemian language in English usage until the 19th century) was the main language of the Diet and the nobility until 1627 (after the Bohemian Revolt was suppressed).\n\nGerman was then formally made equal with Czech and eventually prevailed as the language of the Diet until the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. German was also widely used as the language of administration in many towns after the Germans immigrated and populated some areas of the country in the 13th century. The royal court used the Czech, Latin, and German languages, depending on the ruler and period.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, both the Kingdom and Empire were dissolved. Bohemia became the core part of the newly formed Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1989, as Marxist–Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia peacefully deposed their communist government during the Velvet Revolution, which began on November 17, 1989 and ended 11 days later on November 28th when all of the top Communist leaders and Communist party itself resigned. On December 31, 1992 Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nPhilipp of Swabia (February/March 1177 – June 21, 1208) was a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and King of the Romans/Germans from 1198 until his assassination.\n\nPhilipp was born in or near Pavia in the Imperial Kingdom of Italy as the tenth child and eighth (but fifth and youngest surviving) son of Friedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy, the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine.\n\nHis paternal family was the noble House of Hohenstaufen, the name given to the dynasty by historians since the 15th century. The origins of the family are still unclear today; the ancestors on the paternal side were minor nobles and their names have not been preserved. All that is known about Barbarossa’s great-grandfather Friedrich of Büren is that he married a woman named Hildegard (whose own parentage was disputed: she was a member of either the Comital family of Egisheim–Dagsburg or the obscure Schlettstadt family).\n\nA few years ago it was assumed that the Schlettstadt property did not belong to Hildegard but to her husband himself and the Hohenstaufen were therefore not a Swabian but an Alsatian family. It wasn’t until around 1100 that the family under Duke Friedrich I of Swabia located into the East Swabian Rems valley.\n\nThe death of Philip’s older brother Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1197 meant that the Hohenstaufen rule (which reached as far as the Kingdom of Sicily) collapsed in imperial Italy and created a power vacuum to the north of the Alps. Reservations about the kingship of Heinrich’s underage son, Friedrich, led to two royal elections in 1198, which resulted in the German throne dispute: the two elected kings, Philipp of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, claimed the throne for themselves,\n\nOtto was the third son of Heinrich XII the Lion, Duke of Bavaria and Duke of Saxony, by his wife Matilda of England, third child and eldest daughter of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine Otto’s exact birthplace is not given by any original source. He grew up in England in the care of his maternal grandfather, King Henry II of England.\n\nBoth opponents tried in the following years through European and papal support, with the help of money and gifts, through demonstrative public appearances and rituals, to decide the conflict for oneself by raising ranks or by military and diplomatic measures. Philipp was able to increasingly assert his kingship against Otto in the north part of the Alps.\n\nMarriage\n\nIrene Angelina of Byzantium (c. 1181 – August 27, 1208) was a Byzantine princess and member of the Angelos dynasty and by her two marriages Queen of Sicily in 1193 and Queen of the Romans/Germans from 1198 to 1208.\n\nIrene was born in Constantinople, the second daughter of Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos and his first wife, quite possibly an unknown Palaiologina with a non-Greek mother, who became a nun with the name Irene.\n\nIn 1193 her father and King Tancred of Sicily arranged Irene’s marriage with Tancred’s eldest son, Roger. Her husband was declared co-king, but he died on December 24, 1193, shortly before his father’s death on February 20, 1194. Sicily was claimed by Tancred’s aunt Constance and her husband, Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich VI. Irene was captured December 29, 1194 during the conquest of Sicily. To improve relationships with the Byzantine Empire, in April 1195 Henry VI betrothed Philip to Irene Angelina.\n\nShe was married on May 25, 1197 to Henry’s younger brother, Duke Philip of Swabia, and took the name Maria. After the Emperor Heinrich VI had died on September 28, Philipp was elected King of the Romans in Mühlhausen on March 8, 1198. Queen Irene’s father, who had been deposed in 1195, urged her to get Philip’s support for his reinstatement. Irene Angelina was renamed Maria upon her wedding.\n\nAssassination\n\nSince the end of May 1208, Philip had been preparing for a campaign against Otto IV and his allies. He interrupted the planning to attend the wedding of his niece Countess Beatrice II of Burgundy with Duke Otto of Merania on June 21, 1208 in Bamberg. After the marriage, the King retired to his private apartments. In the afternoon he was murdered by Count Otto VIII of Wittelsbach. After the murder, Count Otto VIII was able to flee with his followers. Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and his brother, Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, were suspected of having known about the plans. Other medieval historians expressed doubts about complicity or ignored other possible perpetrators.\n\nFor the first time since the end of the Merovingian dynasty a king had been murdered. Besides Albert I of Habsburg (1308), Philip is the only Roman-German ruler to be assassinated. No chronicler witnessed the murder. In contemporary sources there is little agreement about the course of the murder. Most medieval chroniclers saw the withdrawal of the promise of marriage as a motive for murder. Even in distant Piacenza, Philip’s murder was still associated with a failed marriage project. Allegedly the Wittelsbach scion, already known for his unstable character, had fallen into a rage when he learned of the dissolution of his betrothal to Gertrude of Silesia by her father, the Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded, who was apparently informed of Count Otto VIII’s cruel tendencies and in an act of concern for his young daughter decided to terminate the marriage agreement.\n\nLater, after an unfortunate campaign to Thuringia, Philipp had betrothed his third daughter Kunigunde to Count Otto VIII in the summer of 1203 in order to make him a reliable ally in the fight against Landgrave Hermann I of Thuringia. In the following years Philipp increasingly succeeded in gaining acceptance for his kingship, so the betrothal with the Wittelsbach became without purpose to him; in November 1207 the King engaged Kunigunde to Wenceslaus, son and heir of King Ottokar I of Bohemia, on the Hoftag in Augsburg. Philipp hoped that this alliance would gain permanent support from Bohemia. For Count Otto VIII this behavior was an act of treason and also felt that his social status was threatened; he swore revenge on the German King, whom he blame for both spurned betrothals, culminating in the murder at Bamberg.\n\nSince historian Eduard Winkelmann’s careful analysis in the 19th century, research has assumed that Otto VIII of Wittelsbach acted as a lone perpetrator. In contrast, historian Bernd Ulrich Hucker made a “comprehensive conspiratorial plan” in 1998 and suspected a “coup d’état”. The Andechs Dukes of Merania, King Philippe II of France and Duke Henry I of Brabant should have been involved in this comprehensive plot; allegedly, the conspirators had planned to put the Duke of Brabant on the German throne. But Hucker’s coup hypothesis did not prevail. It remains to be seen what use the French king would have had from the removal of Philipp and his replacement by the Duke of Brabant. The House of Andechs, as loyal followers of Philipp, who often stayed at his court and were protected by him, had no interest in his death.\n\nAftermath\n\nPhilipp was initially buried in Bamberg Cathedral, the burial place of Emperor Heinrich II and King Conrad III. His rival Otto IV let the assassins be persecuted relentlessly and wanted to prove his innocence. Only the Annales Pegaviensis (chronicle of the Pegau Abbey) held Otto IV’s supporters responsible for the murder. Philip’s widow, Irene-Maria, pregnant at that time, took refuge in Hohenstaufen Castle, dying only two months after the Bamberg regicide as a result of a miscarriage.\n\nAfter Philip’s death, Otto IV quickly prevailed against the remaining Hohenstaufen supporters, was acknowledged as German monarch at an Imperial Diet in Frankfurt in November 1208 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year. For the new fully recognized German King, the most important goal was to restore order in the realm. A Landfrieden was established for this purpose and the Imperial ban on Philipp’s murderer and alleged accomplices, the Andechs brothers Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg and Margrave Heinrich II of Istria, was imposed.\n\nAs a result, they lost all offices, rights and property. In addition, Otto IV’s engagement to Beatrix, Philipp’s eldest daughter, was agreed. Philipp’s murderer Otto VIII of Wittelsbach (now condemned as vogelfrei) was found in March 1209 by Reichsmarschall Heinrich of Kalden in a granary on the Danube near Regensburg and beheaded. The Andechs brothers, however, were politically rehabilitated three years later.\n\nPhilipp was the first German king to be murdered during his reign. In posterity, Philip is one of the little-noticed Hohenstaufen rulers.\n\nBerengaria of Navarre (1165–1170 – December 23, 1230) was Queen of the English as the wife of King Richard I of England. She was the eldest daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre and Infanta Sancha of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VII of León and Castile and his first wife Berengaria of Barcelona.\n\nAs is the case with many of the medieval English queens, little is known of her life.\n\nTraditionally known as “the only English queen never to set foot in the country”, she may in fact have visited England after her husband’s death, but did not do so before, nor did she see much of Richard during her marriage, which was childless. She did (unusually for the wife of a crusader) accompany him on the start of the Third Crusade, but mostly lived in his French possessions, where she gave generously to the church, despite difficulties in collecting the pension she was due from Richard’s brother and successor John after she became a widow.\n\nEarly years\n\nIn 1185, Berengaria was given the fief of Monreal by her father. Eleanor of Aquitaine promoted the engagement of Berengaria to her son Richard the Lionheart. An alliance with Navarre meant protection for the southern borders of Eleanor’s Duchy of Aquitaine and helped create better relations with neighbouring Castile, whose queen was Richard’s sister Eleanor, the wife of King Alfonso VIII of Castile.\n\nAlso, Navarre had assimilated the troubadour culture of Aquitaine and Berengaria’s reputation was unbesmirched. It seems that Berengaria and Richard did in fact meet once, years before their marriage, and writers have claimed that there was an attraction between them at that time.\n\nIn 1190, Eleanor met King Sancho VI in Pamplona, and he hosted a banquet in the Royal Palace of Olite in her honour. The betrothal could not be celebrated openly, for Richard had been betrothed for many years to Alys of France, half-sister of King Philippe II of France. Alys of France, Countess of Vexin (1160 – c. 1220), known in English as “Alice”, was a French princess, the daughter of King Louis VII of the Franks and his second wife, Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso VII of León and Berengaria of Barcelona, but her year of birth is not known.\n\nRichard terminated his betrothal to Alys in 1190 while at Messina. It has been suggested that Alys had become the mistress of Richard’s own father, Henry II of England, and possibly the mother of an illegitimate child; a marriage between Richard and Alys therefore would have been technically impossible for religious reasons of affinity.\n\nMarriage\n\nRichard had Berengaria brought to him by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine. Because Richard was already on the Third Crusade, having wasted no time in setting off after his coronation, the two women had a long and difficult journey to catch up with him. They arrived at Messina in Sicily in 1191 during Lent (when the marriage could not take place) and were joined by Richard’s sister Joan, the widowed Queen of Sicily, wife of King Guglielmo II of Sicily.\n\nBerengaria was left in Joan’s custody. En route to the Holy Land, the ship carrying Berengaria and Joan ran aground off the coast of Cyprus, and they were threatened by the island’s ruler, Isaac Comnenus. Richard came to their rescue, captured the island, and overthrew Comnenus. Berengaria married Richard the Lionheart on May 12, 1191 in the Chapel of St. George at Limassol on Cyprus and was crowned the same day by the archbishop of Bordeaux and the bishops of Évreux and Bayonne.\n\nQueen consort\n\nWhether the marriage was ever even consummated is a matter for conjecture. In any case, Richard certainly took his new wife with him for the first part of the Third Crusade. This was unusual (although Richard’s mother and Berengaria’s predecessor, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had, when Queen of the Franks, been with her husband throughout the Second Crusade). Berengaria returned well before Richard left the Holy Land; on his return to Europe, he was captured and imprisoned. Berengaria remained in Europe, based at Beaufort-en-Vallée, attempting to raise money for his ransom.\n\nAfter his release, Richard returned to England and was not joined by his wife. Richard then set about reclaiming the territories in France that had been lost by his brother John or taken by King Philippe II. His focus was on his kingdom, not his queen. He was ordered by Pope Celestine III to reunite with Queen Berengaria and to show fidelity to her in the future.\n\nRichard, now mostly spending his time in France, obeyed and took Berengaria to church every week thereafter. When he died in 1199, she was distressed, perhaps more so at deliberately being overlooked as queen of England and Cyprus. Some historians believe that Berengaria honestly loved her husband, and Richard’s feelings for her were merely formal because the marriage was a political rather than a romantic union.\n\nQueen dowager\n\nBerengaria never visited England during King Richard’s lifetime, and Richard spent less than six months in England while they were married. There is evidence, however, that she may have done so in the years following his death, since she is believed to have been present at the translation of St Thomas Becket’s remains at Canterbury in 1220.\n\nThe traditional description of her as “the only English queen never to set foot in the country” still would be true because she did not visit England during the time she was Richard’s consort. She certainly sent envoys to England several times, mainly to inquire about the pension she was due as dowager queen and Richard’s widow, which King John failed to pay. Although Queen Eleanor intervened and Pope Innocent III threatened him with an interdict if he did not pay Berengaria what was due, King John still owed her more than £4000 when he died. During the reign of his son King Henry III of England, however, her payments were made.\n\nBerengaria eventually settled in Le Mans, one of her dower properties. She founded L’Épau Abbey in Le Mans in 1229, where she was buried. In 1240, Archbishop Rodrigo Jimenez de Rada of Toledo wrote of Berengaria that she lived “as a most praiseworthy widow and stayed for the most part in the city of Le Mans, which she held as part of her marriage dower, devoting herself to almsgiving, prayer and good works, witnessing as an example to all women of chastity and religion and in the same city she came to the end of her days with a happy death.” A skeleton thought to be hers was rediscovered in 1960 during the restoration of the abbey. These remains are preserved beneath the stone effigy of the queen, which is now to be found in the chapter house of the abbey.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nHistorian Ann Trindade says about Berengaria that she “is remembered as a benefactor of several…religious congregations and institutions and was regarded as a model of piety.” She also states that “Berengaria’s life illustrates very clearly the constraints under which medieval women, even aristocratic ones, were obliged to live.”\n\nBerengaria’s struggles are a good example of what many women faced in the thirteenth century, and “those long years of widowhood reveal, on the basis of record, a strong courageous woman, independent, solitary, battling against difficult political and economic circumstances, with little interest in the trappings of courtly existence, sustained by her faith in Christianity and her loyalty to the See of St. Peter, not afraid to assert her rights against powerful enemies, both lay and clerical.”\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: I wanted to include a mention of King Philippe II Augusté’s next marriage after the death of his first wife, but I thought it deserved its own post.\n\nAfter the early death of Isabella of Hainaut in childbirth in 1190, King Philippe II Augusté of France decided to marry again. He married Ingebog of Denmark a daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark and Sofia of Minsk.\n\nSophia of Minsk was the daughter of Richeza of Poland, Dowager Queen of Sweden, from her second marriage to a man called “Valador”, King in Poloni Land. The identity of her father is uncertain, it was either Volodar of Minsk or Vladimir Vsevolodich, Prince of Novgorod and son of Vsevolod of Pskov. Both of them are of the Rurikid dynasty.\n\nPolitical reasons for this royal marriage are disputed, but Philippe probably wanted to gain better relations with Denmark because the countries had been on different sides in the schism of the future succession to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nKing Philippe II Augusté received 10,000 marks of silver as a dowry and the King met her at Amiens on August 15, 1193 and they were married that same day. At the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin, Archbishop Guillaume of Reims crowned both Philippe II Augusté and Ingeborg King and Queen of France.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Philippe was pale, nervous, and could not wait for the ceremony to end. Following the ceremony, he had Ingeborg sent to the convent of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses and asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non-consummation. Philippe had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful queen of France.\n\nThe Franco-Danish churchman William of Æbelholt intervened on Ingeborg’s side, drawing up a genealogy of the Danish kings to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity.\n\nIn the meantime, Philippe had sought a new bride. Initial agreement had been reached for him to marry Margaret, daughter of Count William I of Geneva, but the young bride’s journey to Paris was interrupted by Thomas, Count of Savoy, who kidnapped Philippe’s intended new wife and married her instead, claiming that Philippe was already bound in marriage. Philippe finally achieved a third marriage in June 1196, when he was married to Agnes of Merania from Dalmatia. Their children were Marie and Philippe, Count of Clermont.\n\nPope Innocent III declared Philippe Augusté’s marriage to Agnes of Merania null and void, as he was still married to Ingeborg. He ordered the king to part from Agnes, and when he did not, the pope placed France under an interdict in 1199. This continued until September 7, 1200. Due to pressure from the pope, Ingeborg’s brother King Valdemar II of Denmark and ultimately Agnes’ death in 1201, Philippe finally took Ingeborg back as his wife, but it would not be until 1213 that she would be recognized at court as Queen.\n\nPhilippe’s reconciliation with Ingeborg was not out of altruism because he wished to press his claims to the throne of the Kingdom of England through his ties to the Danish crown. Later, on his deathbed in 1223, he is said to have told his son King Louis VIII to treat her well. Later, both King Louis VIII and King Louis IX acknowledged Ingeborg as a legitimate queen.\n\nAfter this time, Ingeborg spent most of her time in a priory of Saint-Jean-de-l’Ile which she had founded. It was close to Corbeil on an island in Essonne. She survived her husband by more than 14 years. Ingeborg of Denmark died in either 1237 or 1238 and was buried in the Church of the Order of St John in Corbeil.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: Eastern European Royalty is a weak era for me. So I’ve been working on rectifying this problem. So today I offer the life of King Béla IV of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nBéla IV (1206 – May 3, 1270) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1235 and 1270, and Duke of Styria from 1254 to 1258.\n\nBéla was the oldest son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He was born in the second half of 1206, although the exact date is unknown. Upon King Andrew II’s initiative, Pope Innocent III had already appealed to the Hungarian prelates and barons on June 7 to swear an oath of loyalty to the King’s future son.\n\nAndrew II betrothed Béla to an unnamed daughter of King Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken. In 1214, the King requested Pope Innocent III to excommunicate some unnamed lords who were planning to crown Béla king.\n\nEven so, the eight-year-old Béla was crowned in the same year, but his father did not grant him a province to rule. Furthermore, when leaving for a Crusade to the Holy Land in August 1217, King Andrew II appointed John, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him during his absence.\n\nDuring this period, Béla stayed with his maternal uncle Berthold of Merania in Steyr in the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew II returned from the Holy Land in late 1218. He had arranged the engagement of Béla and Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. She accompanied King Andrew II to Hungary and Béla married her in 1220.\n\nFrom 1226, Béla governed Transylvania as duke. He supported Christian missions among the pagan Cumans who dwelled in the plains to the east of his province. Some Cuman chieftains acknowledged his suzerainty and he adopted the title of King of Cumania in 1233.\n\nKing Andrew II died on September 21, 1235 and Béla succeeded him as King Béla IV of Hungary and Croatia. He attempted to restore royal authority, which had diminished under his father. For this purpose, he revised his predecessors’ land grants and reclaimed former royal estates, causing discontent among the noblemen and the prelates.\n\nThe Mongols invaded Hungary and annihilated Béla’s army in the Battle of Mohi on April 11, 1241. He escaped from the battlefield, but a Mongol detachment chased him from town to town as far as Trogir on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Although he survived the invasion, the Mongols devastated the country before their unexpected withdrawal in March 1242.\n\nKing Béla IV introduced radical reforms in order to prepare his kingdom for a second Mongol invasion. He allowed the barons and the prelates to erect stone fortresses and to set up their private armed forces. He promoted the development of fortified towns.\n\nDuring his reign, thousands of colonists arrived from the Holy Roman Empire, Poland and other neighboring regions to settle in the depopulated lands. Béla’s efforts to rebuild his devastated country won him the epithet of “second founder of the state”\n\nKing Béla IV set up a defensive alliance against the Mongols, which included Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Halych, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow and other Ruthenian and Polish princes. His allies supported him in occupying the Duchy of Styria in 1254, but it was lost to King Ottokar II of Bohemia six years later.\n\nDuring Béla IV’s reign, a wide buffer zone—which included Bosnia, Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) and other newly conquered regions—was established along the southern frontier of Hungary in the 1250s.\n\nBéla’s relationship with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia.\n\nHe was forced to cede the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary east of the river Danube to Stephen, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. Nevertheless, Béla’s family was famed for his piety.\n\nKing Béla IV died on May 3, 1270 as a Franciscan tertiary, and the veneration of his three saintly daughters—Kunigunda, Yolanda, and Margaret—was confirmed by the Holy See.\n\nHis eldest son succeeded him as King Stephen V of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nThere are actually two rulers of the Holy Roman Empire named Heinrich VII. One was actually Emperor while the other was King of the Romans the title generally held by the heir to the throne of the Empire.\n\nThe Heinrich VII that was the actual Emperor, for only one year (1312 — 1313), and lived from the late 13th century until the early 14th century, while the other Heinrich VII lived earlier in the 13th century (1211 – 1242).\n\nThe Heinrich VII who held the imperial title (c. 1273–August 24, 1313), was also known as Heinrich of Luxembourg, who was Count of Luxembourg, King of the Romans (or Rex Romanorum) from 1308 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1312. He was the first Emperor of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nHe was the first emperor since the death of Friedrich II in 1250, ending the Great Interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire; however, his premature death and brief reign threatened to undo his life’s work.\n\nHis son, Johann of Bohemia, failed to be elected as his successor, and there was briefly another anti-king, Friedrich the Fair, contesting the rule of Emperor Ludwig IV.\n\nThe other Heinrich (VII) (1211 – February 12?, 1242), was a member of the long ruling Hohenstaufen dynasty and was the son of Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II and his first wife Infanta Constance of Aragon the second child and eldest daughter of the nine children of Alfonso II of Aragon and Infanta Sancha of Castile.\n\nWhile Friedrich sought to be elected King of the Romans against his Welf rival Otto IV, he had his new-born son Heinrich crowned King of Sicily (as Heinrich II) by Pope Innocent III in March 1212, since an agreement between Friedrich and the Pope stated that the kingdoms of Germany and Sicily should not be united under one ruler. For this, the regency of the Sicilian kingdom went to his mother Constance and not to his father.\n\nHeinrich (VII)’s father, Friedrich II, was eventually elected King of the Romans in 1215, by the German princes, and supported by Pope Innocent III. Friedrich II was crowned King of the Romans in Aachen on July 23, 1215 by one of the three German archbishops.\n\nIt wasn’t until another five years had passed, and only after further negotiations between Friedrich II and Pope Innocent III, and Pope Honorius III – who succeeded to the papacy after Innocent’s death in 1216 – that Friedrich was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Honorius III, on November 22, 1220.\n\nAt the same time, Friedrich’s oldest son Heinrich (VII) took the title of King of the Romans.\n\nIn 1228, Heinrich (VII) took over the rule in the German kingdom and tried to limit the powers of the princes, thereby disturbing the Imperial policies of his father who made him pay homage under the threat of excommunication.\n\nIn 1235, Heinrich (VII) allied with the princely opposition and openly rebelled against his father the emperor, however, was defeated by his father’s forces and dethroned. Friedrich II had him confined in several castles in Apulia, where he died on February 12, 1242 (according to other sources February 10) after a fall from his horse.\n\nSome chroniclers report that his fall from his horse had been an attempted suicide. His father had him buried with royal honours in the cathedral of Cosenza, in an antique Roman sarcophagus.\n\nAlthough he had been the seventh Heinrich to rule over German lands, technically the Holy Roman Empire, he is usually numbered with his ordinal number in parentheses (VII) in order to avoid confusion with the Luxembourg emperor Heinrich VII who, as previously mentioned, actually held the imperial title.\n\nHowever, among the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Heinrich is numbered only in parentheses, because he did not exercise the sole kingship.\n\nHis ordinal number in parentheses was not contemporary with Heinrich’s reign as King of the Romans it was a later invention by historians in order not to confuse him with the later Emperor Heinrich VII who actually ruled the Empire from 1308 onwards (first as King of the Romans then as Holy Roman Emperor in 1312).\n\nHeinrich (VII) was for a long time in his father’s shadow and disparaged as “Parentheses Henry”, several historians in recent years have adopted a more positive view of his Hohenstaufen policies.\n\nAfter the death of Heinrich (VII) his half-brother Conrad IV was elected King of the Romans.\n\nConrad IV (April 25, 1228 – May 21, 1254) was the only son of Emperor Friedrich II from his second marriage with Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem. He inherited the title of King of Jerusalem (as Conrad II) upon the death of his mother in childbirth.\n\nAppointed Duke of Swabia in 1235, his father had him elected King of the Romans and crowned King of Italy (as Conrad IV) in 1237. After the emperor was deposed and died in 1250, he ruled as King of Sicily (Conrad I) until his death.\n\nWith the death of Friedrich II in 1250 the Holy Roman Empire entered the period known as the Great Interregnum which is a whole other topic I will cover tomorrow in this blog."
