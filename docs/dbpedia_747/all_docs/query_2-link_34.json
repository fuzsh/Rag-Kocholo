        "text": "I’ve been waiting for this movie for a while and it finally premiered in Portugal so I went to see immediately.\n\nThis movie as a amazing cast that includes Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and the two leads from Silverlinings Playbook Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper and even Robert De Niro appears for a while. I don’t remember to see a cast as good as this for a long time.\n\nDavid O. Russell directs this movie and does a great job turning a true story into a movie even considering the changes.\n\nPart of the reason I wanted to see this movie was the triple Russell, Lawrence and Cooper. Bale, Adams and Renner were there to make it even more interesting.\n\nHere’s the plot from Wikipedia:\n\nIn 1978, con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) have met, started a relationship, and are working together. Sydney has improved Irving’s scams, posing as British aristocrat “Lady Edith Greensley”. They are a well-matched couple, but Irving refuses to divorce his unstable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) because she would keep her son Danny (whom Irving adopted).\n\nFBI agent Richard “Richie” DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Sydney opposes the agreement. Richie believes Sydney is British but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. Sydney tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.\n\nIrving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab Sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving’s suggests that the Sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) of Camden, New Jersey. The popular mayor is campaigning to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City but has struggled to raise the necessary funds. Richie devises a plan to entrap Carmine despite the objections of his boss Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) and Irving. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2,000,000. When Stoddard’s boss, Anthony Amado (Alessandro Nivola), hears of the operation, he praises Richie’s initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue the operation.\n\nRichie’s over-eagerness to catch Carmine causes the mayor to leave their meeting. Irving convinces Carmine that the Sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike toward Richie, and the two become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the Sheikh at an airfield, forcing Stoddard into further expenses. Without consulting the others, Richie has a Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez (Michael Peña) play the part of the Sheikh.\n\nCarmine brings the Sheikh to a casino party, telling him that mobsters are there and it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to see that the violent Mafia overlord Victor Tellegio (Robert De Niro), second-in-command to Meyer Lansky, is there, and wants to meet the Sheikh. Tellegio explains the business will need the Sheikh to become an American citizen, and Carmine will need to expedite the process, bribing officials if necessary. Tellegio also requires a $10 million wire transfer, to prove the Sheikh’s legitimacy. Richie agrees, eager to bring down Tellegio, while Irving realizes the operation is out of control.\n\nRichie, who is attracted to Sydney, tells Sydney he loves her, but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her British accent and admits to being American. Irving arrives to protect Sydney and tries to call off their deal with Richie. Richie says that if they back out, Tellegio will learn of the scam and murder Irving, Sydney, Rosalyn, and Danny.\n\nRosalyn starts an affair with Pete Musane (Jack Huston), a mobster she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is possibly working with the Internal Revenue Service, so Pete threatens Irving, who promises to prove the Sheikh’s investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete because she feels unloved. Rosalyn agrees to keep quiet about the plan but now wants a divorce.\n\nWith Carmine’s help, Richie and Irving entrap members of Congress into receiving bribes on videotape. Richie goes over Stoddard, convincing Amado that $10,000,000 is needed to entrap Tellegio, but only gets $2 million. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Alfonse Simone (Paul Herman), Tellegio’s lawyer, but Tellegio does not show up. The operation continues, and Richie records an admission of criminal activities when the lawyer accepts the transfer.\n\nIrving visits Carmine’s house and admits to the scam. Carmine blames Irving, saying he only wanted to improve New Jersey. The money is missing, but an anonymous source offers to return it in exchange for immunity for Irving and Sydney and a reduced sentence for Carmine. Amado is willing to make the deal, but Richie objects. Irving suggests Richie either has the money or is incompetent for losing it. Irving actually had a friend pose as Tellegio’s lawyer to con Richie, to give him leverage, and to keep them away from the mob. Amado accepts the deal and removes Richie from the case, dropping him back into obscurity.\n\nIrving and Sydney move in together and open an art gallery, putting their conning days behind them. Rosalyn divorces Irving, marries Pete, and shares custody of her son with Irving. The mob accepts that Irving deflected attention from them, and they let him get on with his life, though he regrets what happened to Carmine.\n\nThe story is interesting and the characters are well developed with some comedy moments in between the more intense scenes.\n\nThe movie is set in the 80’s and the movie does a great job referencing that era. I liked the scene with the microwave being described as a science oven and later watching it explode.\n\nSeveral of the characters are fictional versions of specific real-life counterparts:\n\nChristian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld (based on Melvin Weinberg)\n\nBradley Cooper as FBI Agent Richard “Richie” DiMaso (based on Anthony Amoroso, Jr.)\n\nAmy Adams as Sydney Prosser / Lady Edith Greensly (based on Evelyn Knight)\n\nJeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine Polito (based on Angelo Errichetti)\n\nJennifer Lawrence as Rosalyn Rosenfeld (based on Cynthia Marie Weinberg)\n\nLouis C.K. as Stoddard Thorsen\n\nJack Huston as Pete Musane\n\nSaïd Taghmaoui as Irving’s Sheik Plant\n\nMichael Peña as Paco Hernandez / Sheik Abdullah\n\nShea Whigham as Carl Elway\n\nAlessandro Nivola as Anthony Amado\n\nElisabeth Röhm as Dolly Polito (based on Dolores “Dodie” Errichetti)\n\nColleen Camp as Brenda\n\nPaul Herman as Alfonse Simone\n\nAnthony Zerbe as a US Senator from New Jersey (based on US Senator Harrison A. ‘Pete’ Williams)\n\nRobert De Niro (uncredited) as Victor Tellegio (based on mobster Vincent Alo)\n\nThe Abscam happen before I was born and I never heard of it before this movie so I can’t tell for sure what is real and what isn’t.\n\nThis historicity from Wikipedia helped to understand things:\n\nAmerican Hustle makes no great attempt at directly documenting the Abscam storyline: the names are changed, and the film begins with the unusual on-screen message, “Some of this actually happened”. Major differences from reality include:\n\n– In the film, Irving Rosenfeld begins a life of criminality when he smashes storefront windows as a child in order to provide more work for his father’s glass-installation business. In real life, Melvin Weinberg began working for his father only as an adult. He did smash windows at that point, and according to one article after Abscam was revealed, it was indeed done to shore up business for Weinberg’s father. A later report, however, states that it was done at the behest of the local union, to punish businesses who used non-union glaziers.\n\n– In the film, Camden mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs to his constituents; Irving feels so bad for Carmine that he engineers a reduced sentence for him. In reality, though Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti was widely praised for caring about the people of Camden, he also had a reputation for criminality, and during the Abscam operation offered to get the fake sheik into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling. Though Weinberg developed a fondness for Errichetti as a man who “didn’t beat around the bush”, he made no attempt to protect Errichetti from prosecution.\n\n– Evelyn Knight, Weinberg’s mistress on whom the character of Sydney Prosser is based, was involved in Weinberg’s scams, though to a lesser extent than shown in the film; and she was not involved in Abscam. She was also English, not an American impersonating an Englishwoman as shown in the film.\n\n– Weinberg’s wife Cynthia Marie Weinberg, the basis for Rosalyn Rosenfeld, is not known to have had an affair with someone from the mafia, nor did she nearly blow Weinberg’s cover.\n\n– The character of Richie DiMaso is based to some extent on federal agent Tony Amoroso, although in real life Amoroso was just one of a number of agents involved in setting up and executing the scam.\n\n– In the film, the sheik is played by a Mexican-American FBI agent with very limited Arabic. In real life, the sheik was played by two different agents: first briefly by an American, Mike Denehy, who spoke no Arabic, then by a Lebanese-American.\n\nThough some of the film’s changes have the effect of increasing the sense of moral ambiguity around Abscam, it was indeed a controversial operation, with some critics calling it entrapment, and others decrying the operation’s cost, the fact that it was headed by a convicted criminal, and its effect of reducing public trust in the government only a few years after the Watergate scandal.\n\nOverall the movie works perfectly and the actors did a fantastic job so it’s realy no surprise that 4 of them got Oscar nominations Cooper and Lawrence for supporting roles and Bale and Adams for lead roles. Russell is nominated for best director and the movie is nominated for best picture and best original screenplay."
