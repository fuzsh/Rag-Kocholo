        "text": "The Evolution of urban space in the 21st century - Smart city, between new economy and environmental sustainability (Masters of Art Thesis Abstract) Dott.Marco Spagnuolo Graduation date: January 2017 The objective of this work consists in showing a description of the concept of Smart city and Smart community, where the indispensable protagonist of the progressive and qualitative development of the urban environment is the citizen. The present commitment aims to move the city dweller from a technical and static role to an active role in the field of urban governance. An anthropocentric vision of the urban environment, in which the rapid development of ICT is the means available to the citizen to realize his skills and competences, acquiring greater importance towards administrative institutions. A new role capable of revolutionizing both urban planning and housing architecture. The focus of urban governance is to work to overcome the technocratic urban vision, in which financial power and technological giants act as Deus ex Machina, moving towards an \"socio-cratic\" urban dimension, where individuals and institutions are strongly interconnected in a spirit of complicity in facing challenges; • socio-cultural integration and loss of place identity; • economic due to the financial crisis and the greater demand for competitiveness in the globalized world; • environmental consequences of air and water pollution, excessive energy consumption in urban areas. The following paper aims to examine in detail the various perspectives emerged in recent years on the topic of smart cities. The \"smart\" design indicates a remarkable commitment of the technology; from sophisticated digital devices, three-dimensional processing, powerful management software and modern energy supply technologies; from this point of view the term \"smart\" may appear misleading and too tied to the major technological groups (Siemens Ag - Microsoft - Lenovo etc.). This work aims to focus on the more complex meaning of smart, addressed not only to construction techniques but to a way of living and taking over a space, configuring it as a place. The goal I propose is to consider the term smart as a presupposition for a new social paradigm in which the identity of the place finds its perfect applicability in an urban space.The paper is divided into four parts; in the first two are analyzed both the social evolution of smart city & communities and the technical applications, demonstrating how the community is the mind and the apps are the arm of sustainable development in the urban environment. The third part provides the overview of the emerging hyper-technological but totally uninhabited cities, and of European \"soft technology\" projects characterized by less architectural and engineering unscrupulousness, but by a wiser and respectful vision towards aspects linked to the citizen and his needs. In Europe the word smart is mostly related to redevelopment actions contained in districts and neighborhoods in a state of degradation and / or abandonment, rather than urban renewal works. The last chapter of the paper, divided into two macro-themes, intends to give voice to the citizen and his works \"from below\", involving the reader in the so-called social innovation, a phenomenon expressed in the spread of creative communities redefining development local, focusing on the cultural dimension to recognize and emphasize the identity of a territory, a real Cultural Planning. The second macro-theme concerns the European situation, analyzing the most significant institutional projects and the commitment of citizens and their \"bottom up\" initiatives, illustrating the inventive capacity of the fablabs and urban living labs as well as the management and recovery capacities of deserta loca (De Rosa, Nocca et al., 2013). Cities are the key elements for the future of humanity; play a role of primary importance both as regards socio-economic aspects and natural resources, as they are omnivorous consumers of elements of all kinds (Ratti, 2012). The city is an organism, which ingests goods and produces garbage with enormous amounts of negative externalities, which amplify economic and environmental problems. In this scenario the importance towards urban sustainability grows exponentially, and the objective of urban development policies tend to search for new methodologies and new balances able to combine economic progress and environmental sustainability. Every Western city is equipping itself with a specific environmental plan as a huge range of growth opportunities. The European urban areas are preparing actions and projects of great value characterized by high investments in innovation of services and integrated technologies, aimed at improving buildings, air conditioning systems, public / private transport, 360° diffusion of wi-fi and other services . In 2009, world urbanization has reached a historical and critical moment: the population present in urban areas has surpassed that which lives in the countryside; the urban phenomenon is well represented by this figure: 3.42 billion inhabitants compared to 3.21 in rural areas. The 84% increase is attributable to the least developed countries, which urban areas will have a population of about 5.2 billion, in practice more than double that shown by the various forecasts, calculated for the first decade of 2010. In the western area instead, the increase will be more contained (from the current 900 million to just over 1 billion in 2050), due to the presence of a much older population, a birth rate slightly above 0% (slightly attenuated from the arrival of numerous immigrants from the Middle East) and the greater possibility of study and work for the feminine world that delays marriage and conception (UN, 2008). The problems that most afflict contemporary cities, administrations and inhabitants are related to air pollution caused mainly by road traffic and the energy supply of buildings. Road traffic is one of the main causes of the alarming growth of atmospheric and acoustic pollution, and its effects are particularly deleterious. Public opinion, after decades of excessive tolerance due to the lack of information and a new position, suddenly becomes demanding, demands firm and practicable solutions. The consequent effects of congestion, pollution and health benefits are so serious as to require immediate \"buffer interventions\", but it is essential to start programs and methodologies that allow the rebalancing of a healthier atmosphere. Today urban governance brings into play a whole series of analyzes and simulation models that allow the maximum compression of the phenomenon. It is now possible to know in advance the effects on traffic, congestion, public health, public transport, or rather it is possible to identify the necessary infrastructural and management interventions. Italy has the second highest motorization rate of the 28 EU states and the number of cars in circulation in relation to the population is at the very top of the list even in the world rankings (UN, 2008). The years we live are those determined by the phenomenon of the globalization of the economy and of communication, this has allowed urban areas to be networked with the whole world; has extended to the global scale all the production circuits and the exchange of goods and information. The economy is made up of flows, in turn composed of people, information, money. In the scenario built on the dictates of globalization, cities have become a fundamental meeting ground between public and social actors that interact to achieve adequate development. The consequence, on a purely social level, it is the reinforcement or rebirth of an urban social identity whose goal is to avoid the specter of creative standardization and depletion. A sort of urban guerrilla that aims to bring out and show its specificity to the world. The formation of an active creativity capable of translating into competitive advantages (Porter, 1999). The extreme and disruptive competition of this century, risks giving space only to the productive processes with an economic return and \"false colors\" image of a city, losing those intangible assets born from the sense of belonging, culture and quality of life . (Governa and Memoli, 2012). The central issue is to create virtuous competition that makes one competitive city and at the same time make the whole participant. Achieving this goal is only possible with the sharing between private and public actors, opening up communities to develop all kinds of relationships on ever larger scales and complex (Dematteis, 1995)."
