Joining the company in this role in June of 2015, he oversees all of the company’s operations. During his year helming Fender, Andy has shepherded a myriad of key product launches, fostering exponential growth. In addition, he’s focused on building a team that’s continually growing as well as galvanizing the company’s digital approach to speak directly to the next generation of guitarists.\n\nThroughout his career, he has consistently exemplified what it means to be a modern maverick, disruptor and\n\ntrailblazer. However, he personally prefers a rather unexpected, though nevertheless revealing characterization,\n\ndescribing himself as a “guitar geek with big company experience.” That “big company experience,” as he puts it, is something of a humble understatement. Andy worked at Nike for 20 years, starting in the UK as Chief Financial Officer before seguing into Marketing and eventually the role of Chief Marketing Officer in the United States during 1994. He headed the $3 billion global apparel organization, overseeing all things Nike and Jordan while implementing legendary advertising campaigns. Following Nike, Andy spent 11 years at Disney, becoming the Chairman of Disney Consumer Products in 2000. Among other achievements, he personally envisioned and spearheaded the launch of the monumental Disney Princess Franchise, which was recently valued at over $4 billion, when he was struck with inspiration after a Disney on Ice performance. A true enigma, he’s just as quick to quote Metallica lyrics as he is to espouse his love for iconic brands.\n\nJoining Fender as CEO would complete the circle for the lifelong guitar aficionado and music fan, since he’s proudly played guitar for over 50 years. Growing up in Whitburn, which he describes as “a small mining village in Scotland, halfway between Edinburgh and Glasgow,” Andy lived in a house filled with music. His father played piano daily and encouraged him to pick up an instrument; the guitar called to him. Inspired by the legendary Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple, he immersed himself in woodshedding, playing in multiple bands. By the time he joined Fender, his impressive collection encompassed nearly 50 guitars, most of them Fender including a ‘52 Telecaster® and ‘55 Stratocaster®. As a devout hard rock and heavy metal fan, lately he’s been jamming on his John 5 Signature Telecaster, along with a HSS version of the new Fender Elite Stratocaster. Among the highlights in his guitar collection is also a Jackson Custom Shop Randy Rhoads made from Korina wood.\n\nOutside of music, Andy remains a devout family man, cooking breakfast for his daughter every morning—though he admits to skipping the chocolate chips “which occasionally find their way into her waffles.” He works out every day, maintains a positive outlook, and loves discovering new music at The Roxy and Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. His passions fuel everything he does and continues to lead him towards innovation at every turn.\n\nDamian Ornani\n\nFisher Investments\n\nDamian Ornani is Chief Executive Officer for Fisher Investments.\n\nRead More\n\nDamian Ornani\n\nDamian Ornani is the Chief Executive Officer of Fisher Investments—a role he has held since 2016.

He discovered how little data we have about the important assets that power our daily lives. As an engineer, he saw this as a solvable problem, and his initial robot helped that power plant drastically reduce its downtime, saving the plant money and preventing power outages for thousands of families.\n\nAt 22 years old, after graduating from Grove City College near Pittsburgh, Jake bootstrapped and launched Gecko Robotics in 2013. In 2016, Jake, down to his last few dollars, turned down an acquisition offer to join up with YCombinator, the world’s most prestigious startup incubator. While many of his peers built apps or solutions to day-to-day business challenges, Jake had a different path in mind. He chose to look at how advanced robotics and digitalization could help tackle an industry in critical need of modernization: our global infrastructure.\n\nToday, Gecko’s business model of creating data with robots, and building enterprise software with it, is pioneering an emerging business model for the real world. The business model focuses on data that has never been accessible before: from pipelines, boilers, tanks, ship hulls, missile silos and other critical asset types. Gecko’s AI-driven software platform enables human experts to improve sustainability metrics of those assets, determine optimal performance and ensure predictive maintenance by creating digital twins. Beyond Gecko’s work with energy, oil and gas, and manufacturing companies around the world, Gecko also works with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy to protect and optimize maintenance plans for critical infrastructure.\n\nJake currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his wife, and four kids.
