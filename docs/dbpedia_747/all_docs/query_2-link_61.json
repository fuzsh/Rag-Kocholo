        "text": "We will be visiting Campbell’s museum in San Francisco for the AFC Trip October 17-October 20, 2024. There are still spaces available for this unique long weekend experience that includes attending the exclusive opening and a private tour of the exhibition with Campbell. We will also be honoring Director Emeritus Sylvain Bellenger. For more information about the trip: visit our website. A $500 nonrefundable contribution to AFC is tax deductible and reserves your spot.\n\nDirector Sylvain Bellenger’s historic tenure at Capodimonte came to a close in November, 2023. Eike Schmidt, the former director of Florence’s famed Uffizi Gallery, was appointed as Sylvain’s successor and took the reins in January, 2024. Dir. Schmidt is now running for Mayor of Florence. His directorship at Capodimonte will remain suspended until the outcome of the election in June, 2024. In the meantime, Massimo Osanna, Director General of Museums in Italy, will oversee Capodimonte’s administration. Rest assured that our intrepid AFC Fellow, Emma de Jong, continues to make huge progress.\n\nOur AFC Fellow reports on Ottocento Napoli, an exhibition at the Scuderie del Quirinale, Rome, featuring 19th-century objects from Capodimonte’s collection. The exhibition is curated by none other than Director Emeritus Sylvain Bellenger.\n\nIn other news, Naples in Paris, which opened at the Louvre last June and closed in January is now open in Turin under the title Capodimonte da Reggia a Museo.\n\nThank you for your continued support and we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are about the fact that one of Italy’s most culturally significant treasures is coming to the United States for a year. Subscribe to our trip to San Francisco for exclusive access to the exhibition and learn about the battle in 1525 that changed the course of history.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCristina Del Sesto, AFC Board President\n\nUpdate from Current AFC Fellow Emma C. de Jong\n\nJust five months into her fellowship, Emma has already cataloged over seven hundred individual art works from the Carlo Firmian print collection. Once the prints have been photographed, the information she has gathered will be incorporated into the online museum catalog. This digitization project will make the Firmian Collection easily accessible worldwide. She has also been writing a new guide to the Firmian collection in order to improve in-person visits to the print cabinet. She intends for her research to result in several articles on different aspects of the Firmian collection. The prints at Capodimonte have hardly been studied, which means there is still a lot to be discovered! Promoting this collection among print scholars and enthusiasts is one of the aims of her tenure.\n\nAt the end of January Emma received the final proofs for her entry in the catalog Art and War in the Renaissance: The Battle of Pavia Tapestries, which will accompany the U.S. traveling exhibition. Her contribution focuses on the preparatory drawings, which are today housed in the Louvre.\n\nTogether with the fellows from La Capraia (The Center for the Art and Architectural History of Port Cities), Emma has been visiting the many libraries and archives of Naples. All are located in beautiful historic buildings, from castles and palaces to monasteries.\n\nThe best way to stay up to date with the AFC fellow’s latest activities is by following our Instagram account, where Emma regularly posts updates about her work and AFC events.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Capodimonte is about to undergo extensive renovations that will result in improved visitor services spaces, a visible storage gallery, updated climate control systems, and increased energy efficiency, among other facilities upgrades. The museum will remain open during construction, with the intermittent closure of certain galleries as the works progress.\n\nWe recommend visitors consult the museum’s website to find the most up-to-date visitor hours and accessible galleries.\n\nThe Bosco and the Stufa dei Fiori teahouse will remain open for the duration of the construction.\n\nThe Bosco of Capodimonte is one of the largest public parks in Italy. It spans 300 acres and contains more than 400 species of plants and flowers. It is open to the public every day. Check the Capodimonte website for current opening hours, including those for the Chapel of San Gennaro, recently reimagined by the architect Santiago Calatrava. Stroll or jog through the Bosco’s numerous trails, including the wellness path, or take in a game of soccer or rugby played by locals on the sports fields. You can also admire the historical trees and plants brought to Naples as early as the eighteenth century in the Sino-English Garden located next to the Stufa dei Fiori.\n\nThe Stufa dei Fiori had been used since 1843 as a greenhouse until it was turned into a teahouse and cafe in May 2022. It is the perfect place for a snack or coffee. The rotating, seasonal menu features daily specials using only the freshest local ingredients. Hours: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Closed Wednesdays.\n\nI am grateful to my fellow board members for entrusting me with not just the title of president but all the responsibilities that come along with it. I would like to thank Nancy Vespoli for leading us for four years and bringing in a cohort of friends who have made our trips so much fun while simultaneously supporting our mission of sending an American post-doctoral curator to the Capodimonte Museum for two years.\n\nFollowing in her footsteps is my ambitious plan.\n\nTo kick off 2023, the AFC met in Washington, D.C. for the first time on January 14 and January 15. We were received on Saturday at The Phillips Collection by outgoing Director, Dorothy Kosinski, and Renato Miracco, curator of the exhibition An Italian Impressionist in Paris: Giuseppe De Nittis. Miracco, a native Neapolitan, gave us an informative and entertaining tour of the exhibition. We were delighted to see two major loans from Museo e Real Bosco di Capodimonte in the show: Crossing the Appenines and Farmhouse near Naples. De Nittis (1846-1884) was just 20 when he painted them. The first King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel, acquired both for the royal collection. De Nittis was one of the few artists—and arguably the best—to have documented the eruption of Vesuvius on April 26, 1872.\n\nWhile art fed our souls all weekend we were also fortunate enough to have eaten very well. Sette Osteria is just around the corner from the Phillips, and Fabio Trabocchi’s Bar Piccolo at Fiola Mare was a fitting setting along the Potomac River. It was no substitute for the Bay of Naples, but still.\n\nNearly 20 people participated, coming from Houston, London, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York City, Rhode Island, and D.C.\n\nThe next AFC trip will take place in Paris in early June for the opening of the Louvre exhibition Naples à Paris. Le Louvre invite le musée de Capodimonte. It will be at least three days of events. If you want to come, don’t wait or you’ll be too late! Email your pledge to: americanfriendsofcapoidmonte@info.com. The AFC contribution minimum to be able to participate in this trip and its exciting events is $2,500 pp, excluding lodging and airfare.\n\nIn the meantime, we debuted a robust speaking series at the end of last year and the lectures continue in 2023.\n\nWith so much going on, one might forget that the application deadline for the AFC Fellow (2023-2025) closed on January 15. The posting for the fellowship received more than 1,000 views and we are confident we have attracted yet another competitive applicant pool. We will be announcing the next AFC Fellow soon.\n\nWhen the AFC was founded in 2016, the Capodimonte museum did not have any English didactics (wall text). It made the museum almost inaccessible to all but Italians and Italian-speakers. In the almost two years since Caroline began her post, she has more than doubled the amount of didactics the AFC produced. As of right now, there are over 90 bilingual wall texts in the Neapolitan painting galleries alone. And, this is the least of what Caroline has accomplished. She has been instrumental in the organization of a touring exhibition to Hong Kong, The Road to the Baroque: Masterpieces from the Capodimonte Museum, she has worked on the forthcoming exhibition on Capodimonte at the Louvre, and she is supporting the museum’s ongoing digitization efforts, bringing the collections catalog online. She has done her own scholarship, published essays, spoken at conferences, given VIP tours, and more. She has far exceeded our expectations and I know the Director is most pleased.\n\nThere are more than 300 people on our mailing list, but only 40 people have made contributions. It’s something to consider for 2023. Contributions are tax deductible as we are a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit. We have no overhead. No staff. Everything goes towards the support of the AFC Fellow. I’d like to thank loyal and major donors such as Vincent Buonanno, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, Julie and Bart Livolsi, Nancy and Mike Vespoli, and our entire board for their tireless work, especially James Anno and Gretchen Hirschauer who are fulltime curators at major U.S. art institutions. I would like to give a special thanks to Giovanni Lombardi for his generous support of the Fellow, as well as Errico di Lorenzo, president of the Amici di Capodimonte, our sister organization. Finally, I’d like to thank Giuditta Giorgio at the Italian Embassy, Washington for her encouragement.\n\nTo have articulated a mission and have fulfilled it is incredibly rewarding.\n\nThanks to you all, we are able and at the ready. Andiamo!\n\nCristina Del Sesto\n\nEmail: americanfriendsofcapodimonte@info.com"
