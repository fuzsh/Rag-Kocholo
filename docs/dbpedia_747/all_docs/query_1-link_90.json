The antimicrobial activities were evaluated by paper diffusion method.\n\nActinomadura amylolytica sp. nov. and Actinomadura cellulosilytica sp. nov., isolated from geothermally heated soil.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJiao, Jian-Yu; Liu, Lan; Zhou, En-Min; Wei, Da-Qiao; Ming, Hong; Xian, Wen-Dong; Yuan, Chang-Guo; Zhong, Jing-Mei; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTwo aerobic, Gram-positive actinomycetes, designated YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T), were isolated from geothermally heated soil of Tengchong county, Yunnan province, south-west China. The taxonomic position of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) belong to the genus Actinomadura. Both strains form extensively-branched substrate and aerial mycelia which differentiated into short spore chains. The cell wall of the two strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid, while the whole-cell sugars detected were glucose, madurose, mannose and rhamnose. The polar lipid profile of strain YIM 77502(T) was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified phospholipids and an unidentified polar lipid, while strain YIM 77510(T) consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and phosphatidylinositol. The respiratory quinones of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The major fatty acids (>10 %) of strain YIM 77502(T) were C17:0, iso-C16:0, C17:010-methyl and iso-C18:0, and those of strain YIM 77510(T) were iso-C16:0, C17:010-methyl and iso-C18:0. The G+C contents of strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) were determined to be 71.3 and 70.2 mol%, respectively. The DNA-DNA hybridization values of strains YIM 77502(T), YIM 77510(T) and their closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinomadura echinospora BCRC 12547(T) and Actinomadura umbrina KCTC 9343(T) were less than 70 %. Based on the morphological and physiological properties, and phylogenetic analyses, strains YIM 77502(T) and YIM 77510(T) are considered to represent two novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the names Actinomadura amylolytica sp. nov. (type strain YIM 77502(T) = DSM 45822(T) = CCTCC AA 2012024(T)) and Actinomadura cellulosilytica sp. nov.

The novel isolates were observed to be Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and yellow-pigmented bacteria. The strains were found to be able to grow at 37-65 Â°C, pH 6.0-9.0 and with a NaCl tolerance up to 1.0 % (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed these two isolates in the genus Meiothermus. They were found to be closely related to Meiothermus timidus DSM 17022(T) (98.6 % similarity), and formed a cluster with this species. The predominant menaquinone was identified as MK-8 and the major fatty acids (>10 %) as anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, iso-C16:0 and C16:0. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 71031(T) and YIM 71039 were determined to be 64.0 and 65.4 mol%, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridizations showed low values between strains YIM 71031(T) and YIM 71039 and their closely related neighbour M. timidus DSM 17022(T). Morphological phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results suggest that strains YIM 71031(T) and YIM 71039 are representatives of a new species within the genus Meiothermus, for which the name Meiothermus roseus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 71031(T) (=KCTC 42495(T) =NBRC 110900(T)).\n\nHaladaptatus pallidirubidus sp. nov., a halophilic archaeon isolated from saline soil samples in Yunnan and Xinjiang, China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Bing-Bing; Zhao, Wan-Yu; Chu, Xiao; Hozzein, Wael N; Prabhu, Deene Manik; Wadaan, Mohammed A M; Tang, Shu-Kun; Zhang, Li-Li; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTwo extremely halophilic archaea, designated YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T), were isolated from saline soils in Yunnan province and Lup nur region in Xinjiang province, western China, respectively. Colonies of the two strains were observed to be pink-pigmented. The cells were found to be Gram-stain negative, coccoid and non-motile. The organisms were found to be aerobic and could grow in an NaCl range of 6-35Â % (optimum 18Â %), temperatures ranging from 25 to 50Â Â°C (optimum 37-42Â Â°C), pH range from 6.0-8.5 (optimum pH 7.0-7.5) and Mg(2+) range from 0 to 1.5Â M (optimum 0.5-1.0Â M); Mg(2+) was not necessary for growth. Cells were not observed to lyse in distilled water. Strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Haladaptatus cibarius JCM 15962(T) (97.6 and 97.9Â %, respectively). In addition, the DNA-DNA hybridizations of strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) with type strains H. cibarius JCM 15962(T), Haladaptatus litoreus JCM 15771(T) and Haladaptatus paucihalophilus JCM 13897(T) were 37.2 and 38.2Â %, 36.6 and 39.0Â % and 27.9 and 27.7Â %, respectively. The DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) were determined to be 56.0 and 57.4Â mol%. The major polar lipids of the two strains were identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate methyl ester, phosphatidylglycerol sulfate, sulfated mannosyl glucosyl diether and other four unidentified glycolipids. On the basis of physiological, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic analysis, the strains YIM 90917 and YIM 93656(T) can be classified as a novel species of the genus Haladaptatus, for which the name Haladaptatus pallidirubidus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 93656(T) (=JCM 17504(T)Â =Â CCTCC AB2010454(T)).\n\nGlycomyces scopariae sp. nov. and Glycomyces mayteni sp. nov., isolated from medicinal plants in China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQin, Sheng; Chen, Hua-Hong; Klenk, Hans-Peter; Zhao, Guo-Zhen; Li, Jie; Xu, Li-Hua; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2009-05-01\n\nTwo actinomycete strains, designated YIM 56256(T) and YIM 61331(T), were isolated from the roots of Scoparia dulcis and Maytenus austroyunnanensis, two Chinese medicinal plants, and their taxonomic status was established based on a polyphasic investigation. The organisms were found to have chemical and morphological markers typical of members of the genus Glycomyces. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that they were closely related to each other and to Glycomyces sambucus E71(T). A battery of physiological characteristics and levels of DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that strains YIM 56256(T) and YIM 61331(T) represent two novel species, clearly different from the related known Glycomyces species. On the basis of the data presented, it is evident that each of these strains represents a novel species of the genus Glycomyces, for which the names Glycomyces scopariae sp. nov. (type strain YIM 56256(T) =KCTC 19158(T) =DSM 44968(T)) and Glycomyces mayteni sp. nov. (type strain YIM 61331(T) =KCTC 19527(T) =CCTCC AA 208004(T)) are proposed.\n\nThermus caliditerrae sp. nov., a novel thermophilic species isolated from a geothermal area.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMing, Hong; Yin, Yi-Rui; Li, Shuai; Nie, Guo-Xing; Yu, Tian-Tian; Zhou, En-Min; Liu, Lan; Dong, Lei; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTwo thermophilic bacterial strains, designated YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777, were isolated from two hot springs, one in the Hydrothermal Explosion (Shuirebaozhaqu) area and Frog Mouth Spring in Tengchong county, Yunnan province, south-western China. The taxonomic positions of the two isolates were investigated by a polyphasic approach. Cells of the two strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped. They were able to grow at 50-70 Â°C, pH 6.0-8.0 and with a NaCl tolerance up to 0.5% (w/v). Colonies are circular, convex, non-transparent and produce yellow pigment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences comparison clearly demonstrated that strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 represent members of the genus Thermus, and they also detected low-level similarities of 16S rRNA gene sequences (below 97%) compared with all other species in this genus. Their predominant menaquinone was MK-8. The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 were 65.6 mol% and 67.2 mol%, respectively. Based on the results of physiological and biochemical tests and phylogenetic analyses, strains YIM 77925(T) and YIM 77777 could not be classified as representing any species of the genus Thermus with a validly published name. Thus the two strains are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Thermus, for which the name Thermus caliditerrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 77925(T) (â=âDSM 25901(T)â=âCCTCC 2012061(T)).\n\nStreptomyces zhihengii sp. nov., isolated from rhizospheric soil of Psammosilene tunicoides.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuang, Mei-Juan; Fei, Jing-Jing; Salam, Nimaichand; Kim, Chang-Jin; Hozzein, Wael N; Xiao, Min; Huang, Hai-Quan; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2016-10-01\n\nAn actinomycete strain, designated YIM T102(T), was isolated from the rhizospheric soil of Psammosilene tunicoides W. C. Wu et C. Y. Wu collected from Lijiang, YunnanÂ Province, China. The taxonomic position of the new isolate was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM T102(T) belongs to the genus Streptomyces. Strain YIM T102(T) was most closely related to Streptomyces eurocidicus NRRL B-1676(T) with a pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.9Â %. However, DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain YIM T102(T) and S. eurocidicus NBRC 13491(T) was found to be 37.8Â Â±Â 1.8Â %. The menaquinone composition detected for strain YIM T102(T) was MK-9 (H6) and MK-9 (H8), while the major fatty acids were summed feature 4 (38.0Â %), anteiso-C15:0 (13.1Â %), iso-C16:0 (10.1Â %), summed feature 3 (9.8Â %) and C16:0 (9.0Â %) and iso-C15:0 (5.2Â %). The whole-cell hydrolysates contained galactose, glucose, ribose and mannose, along with LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 70.7Â mol%. Strain YIM T102(T) also exhibited antagonistic activity against Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicae and Colletotrichum nicotianae Averna, based on the findings from the comparative analyses of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics; it is proposed that strain YIM T102 represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces zhihengii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM T102(T) (=KCTC 39115(T)Â =Â DSM 42176(T)Â =Â CGMCC 4.7248(T)).\n\nMicrolunatus cavernae sp. nov., a novel actinobacterium isolated from Alu ancient cave, Yunnan, South-West China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Juan; Chen, Wei; Huo-Zhang, Bing; Nimaichand, Salam; Zhou, En-Min; Lu, Xin-Hua; Klenk, Hans-Peter; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2013-07-01\n\nA Gram-positive, coccoid, non-endospore-forming actinobacterium, designated YIM C01117(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from Alu ancient cave, Yunnan province, south-west China. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain YIM C01117(T) was shown to belong to the genus Microlunatus, with highest sequence similarity of 97.4Â % to Microlunatus soli DSM 21800(T). The whole genomic DNA relatedness as shown by the DNA-DNA hybridization study between YIM C01117(T) and M. soli DSM 21800(T) had a low value (47Â Â±Â 2Â %). Strain YIM C01117(T) was determined to contain LL-diaminopimelic acid with Gly, Glu and Ala amino acids (A3Î³' type) in the cell wall. Whole-cell hydrolysates were found to contain glucose, galactose, mannose and ribose. The major polar lipids were determined to be phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant menaquinone system present is MK-9(H4), while the major fatty acids were identified to be anteiso-C15:0 (24.1Â %), iso-C16:0 (22.3Â %) and iso-C15:0 (11.4Â %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 65.9Â mol%. The chemotaxonomic and genotypic data support the affiliation of the strain YIM C01117(T) to the genus Microlunatus. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allow strain YIM C01117(T) to be differentiated phenotypically from recognized Microlunatus species. Strain YIM C01117(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microlunatus, for which the name Microlunatus cavernae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM C01117(T) (=Â DSM 26248(T)Â =Â JCM 18536(T)).\n\nRoseomonas alkaliterrae sp. nov., isolated from an alkali geothermal soil sample in Tengchong, Yunnan, South-West China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDong, Lei; Ming, Hong; Yin, Yi-Rui; Duan, Yan-Yan; Zhou, En-Min; Nie, Guo-Xing; Feng, Hui-Geng; Liu, Lan; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAn alkalitolerant, thermotolerant and Gram-stain negative bacterium, designated strain YIM 78007(T), was isolated from an alkaline geothermal soil sample from Hehua hot spring, Tengchong, Yunnan province, south-west China. Cells of strain YIM 78007(T) were observed to be aerobic and short rod-shaped. The colonies were observed to be orange-red, convex and circular. 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain YIM 78007(T) clustered with members of the genus Roseomonas (with similarities from 97.2 to 92.2Â %). Optimal growth of strain YIM 78007 occurs at 40-50Â Â°C and pH 8.0-10.0. The predominant ubiquinone was identified as Q-10 and the major fatty acids were identified as C18:1 Ï7c and C16:0. The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified aminolipids and one unknown phospholipid. The GÂ +Â C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 63Â molÂ %. The levels of DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness between strain YIM 78007(T) and its closet neighbours (Roseomonas lacus JCM 13283(T) and Roseomonas terrae JCM 14592(T)) were well below the threshold required for the proposal of a novel species. The results of physiological and biochemical characteristics, the phylogenetic analysis, as well as low DNA-DNA hybridization values, allowed the phenotypic and genotypic differentiation of strain YIM 78007(T) from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Therefore, strain YIM 78007(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Roseomonas, for which the name Roseomonas alkaliterrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 78007(T) (=BCRC 80644(T)Â =Â JCM 19656(T)).\n\nKocuria halotolerans sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from a saline soil in China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTang, Shu-Kun; Wang, Yun; Lou, Kai; Mao, Pei-Hong; Xu, Li-Hua; Jiang, Cheng-Lin; Kim, Chang-Jin; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2009-06-01\n\nA Gram-positive actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 90716(T), was isolated from a saline soil sample collected from Ganjiahu Suosuo Forest National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. The new isolate contained lysine, glutamic acid and alanine with peptidoglycan type Lys-Ala(3) (variation A3alpha). The major phospholipids were phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant menaqinone was MK-7(H(2)). The major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The DNA G+C content of strain YIM 90716(T) was 68.0 mol%. Chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain YIM 90716(T) to the genus Kocuria. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was related most closely to Kocuria kristinae DSM 20032(T) (96.8 % similarity) and showed lower levels of 16S rRNA gene similarity (Kocuria. The results of fatty acid analysis and physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain YIM 90716(T) from its closest relatives. On the basis of data from the present polyphasic study, strain YIM 90716(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Kocuria, for which the name Kocuria halotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 90716(T) (=DSM 18442(T)=KCTC 19172(T)=CCTCC AB 206069(T)).\n\nLysobacter thermophilus sp. nov., isolated from a geothermal soil sample in Tengchong, south-west China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWei, Da-Qiao; Yu, Tian-Tian; Yao, Ji-Cheng; Zhou, En-Min; Song, Zhao-Qi; Yin, Yi-Rui; Ming, Hong; Tang, Shu-Kun; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2012-11-01\n\nA Gram-negative and aerobic bacterium, designated YIM 77875(T), was isolated from a geothermal soil sample collected at Rehai National Park, Tengchong, Yunnan Province, south-west China. Bacterial growth occurred from 37 to 65Â Â°C (optimum 50Â Â°C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and 0-1Â % NaCl (w/v). Cells were rod-shaped and colonies were convex, circular, smooth, yellow and non-transparent. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM 77875(T) belongs to the genus Lysobacter. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between strain YIM 77875(T) and other species of the genus Lysobacter were all below 94.7Â %. The polar lipids of strain YIM 77875(T) were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and five unknown phospholipids. The predominant respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the G+C content was 68.8Â mol%. Major fatty acids were iso-C(16:0), iso-C(15:0) and iso-C(11:0). On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, as well as genotypic data, strain YIM 77875(T) represents a novel species, Lysobacter thermophilus sp. nov., in the genus Lysobacter. The type strain is YIM 77875(T) (CCTCC AB 2012064(T)Â =Â KCTC 32020(T)).\n\nMicrococcus endophyticus sp. nov., isolated from surface-sterilized Aquilaria sinensis roots.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Hua-Hong; Zhao, Guo-Zhen; Park, Dong-Jin; Zhang, Yu-Qin; Xu, Li-Hua; Lee, Jae-Chan; Kim, Chang-Jin; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2009-05-01\n\nA Gram-positive bacterial strain, designated YIM 56238(T), was isolated from plant roots (Aquilaria sinensis), and characterized by using a polyphasic approach. Strain YIM 56238(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0 and at 28 degrees C. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain YIM 56238(T) indicated that it belongs to the genus Micrococcus. Chemotaxonomic data strongly supported the classification of this strain within the genus Micrococcus: the cell-wall peptidoglycan contained lysine, glutamic acid, alanine and glycine; the predominant menaquinones were MK-8(H(2)) (63.6 %) and MK-7(H(2)) (21.1 %); the phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown ninhydrin-negative phospholipid; and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) (30.95 %) and anteiso-C(15 : 0) (53.75 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 72.9 mol%. A number of physiological features were found that clearly distinguished strain YIM 56238(T) from recognized species of the genus Micrococcus. DNA-DNA hybridization studies suggested that the novel strain represents a separate genomic species. On the basis of the data, therefore, strain YIM 56238(T) represents a novel species of the genus Micrococcus, for which the name Micrococcus endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 56238(T) (=DSM 17945(T)=KCTC 19156(T)).\n\nThermus tengchongensis sp. nov., isolated from a geothermally heated soil sample in Tengchong, Yunnan, south-west China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYu, Tian-Tian; Yao, Ji-Cheng; Ming, Hong; Yin, Yi-Rui; Zhou, En-Min; Liu, Min-Jiao; Tang, Shu-Kun; Li, Wen-Jun\n\n2013-03-01\n\nA Gram-stain negative aerobic bacterium, designated YIM 77924(T), was isolated from a geothermally heated soil sample collected at Rehai National Park, Tengchong, Yunnan province, south-west China. Growth was found to occur from 55 to 75 Â°C (optimum 65 Â°C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and 0-1 % NaCl (w/v). Cells were observed to be rod-shaped and the colonies convex, circular, smooth, yellow and non-transparent. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM 77924(T) belongs to the genus Thermus. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between strain YIM 77924(T) and other species of the genus Thermus were all below 97 %. The polar lipids of strain YIM 77924(T) were determined to be aminophospholipid, phospholipid and glycolipid.

Chemotaxonomic data gathered for peptidoglycan type, menaquinones, phospholipids and fatty acids strongly supported the classification of this strain within the genus Micrococcus: the cell-wall peptidoglycan contained lysine, glutamic acid, alanine, glycine and aspartic acid, the predominant menaquinones were MK-8(H(2)) (66.97 %) and MK-7(H(2)) (23.26 %), the phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unknown ninhydrin-negative phospholipid, and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0) (61.98 %), iso-C(16 : 0) (14.25 %) and iso-C(15 : 0) (13.04 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.7 mol%. A number of physiological features were found that clearly distinguished strain YIM 65004(T) from recognized Micrococcus species. DNA-DNA hybridization studies suggested that the novel strain represents a separate genomic species. Based on the above data, a novel species of the genus Micrococcus, Micrococcus yunnanensis sp. nov., is proposed, with the type strain YIM 65004(T) (=CCTCC AA 208060(T)=DSM 21948(T)).\n\nNocardiopsis akesuensis sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from a salt water beach.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGao, Guang-Bin; Luo, Xiao-Xia; Xia, Zhan-Feng; Zhang, Yao; Wan, Chuan-Xing; Zhang, Li-Li\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe taxonomic position of a novel actinomycete, strain TRM 46250T, isolated from the sediment of a salt water beach at Baicheng, Xinjiang, China, was determined by a polyphasic approach. Strain TRM 46250T grew optimally in the presence of 2â% (w/v) NaCl and an optimum temperature range for growth of 28-37âÂ°C. The whole-cell sugars of strain TRM 46250T were ribose, xylose, mannose and galactose. The diagnostic diamino acid was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipids were phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethyl ethanolamine and six unidentified phospholipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-10, MK-10(H6) and MK-10(H8). The major fatty acids were 10-methyl C18â:â0,âiso-C16â:â0, C16â:â0,âiso-G C16â:â1 and C18â:â1Ï9c. Based on morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics the isolate was determined to belong to the genus Nocardiopsis. The phylogenetic tree based on its nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1493 nt) with those of representative strains showed that the strain consistently falls into a distinct phyletic line together with Nocardiopsis gilva YIM 90087T (97.68â% similarity) and a subclade consisting of Nocardiopsis composta KS9T (97.52â%), Nocardiopsis rosea YIM 90094T (97.44â%) and Nocardiopsis rhodophaea YIM 90096T (97.16â%). However, DNA-DNA hybridization studies between strain TRM 46250T and N. gilva YIM 90087T showed only 36.94â% relatedness. On the basis of these data, strain TRM 46250T should be designated as a representative of a novel species of the genus Nocardiopsis, for which the name Nocardiopsis akesuensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 46250T (=CCTCC AA 2015027T=KCTC 39725T).\n\n48 CFR 434.004 - Acquisition strategy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 48 Federal Acquisition Regulations System 4 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Acquisition strategy. 434.004 Section 434.004 Federal Acquisition Regulations System DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF CONTRACTING MAJOR SYSTEM ACQUISITION General 434.004 Acquisition strategy.

Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been approved for head and neck and colorectal cancer treatment, but many patients treated with cetuximab don't respond or eventually acquire resistance. To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to cetuximab, we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. These cetuximab-resistant (CtxR) cells exhibit increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in EGFR trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on EGFR signaling for enhanced growth potential. Here, we examined Sym004, a novel mixture of antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, as an alternative therapy for CtxR tumor cells. Sym004 treatment of CtxR clones resulted in rapid EGFR degradation, followed by robust inhibition of cell proliferation and down-regulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. To determine whether Sym004 could have therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo CtxR NCI-H226 mouse xenografts and subsequently treated CtxR tumors with Sym004. Sym004 treatment of mice harboring CtxR tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Levels of total and phospho-EGFR were robustly decreased in CtxR tumors treated with Sym004. Immunohistochemical analysis of these Sym004-treated xenograft tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of Ki67, and phospho-rpS6, as well as a modest increase in cleaved caspase-3. These results indicate that Sym004 may be an effective targeted therapy for CtxR tumors.

Strain AE-6(T) grew at high salt concentrations [10% (w/v) NaCl], temperatures of 15-41 Â°C and a pH range of 5-12. It showed highest (99.7%) 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Micrococcus yunnanensis YIM 65004(T) followed by Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665(T) (99.6%) and Micrococcus endophyticus YIM 56238(T) (99.0%). Ribosomal protein profiling by MALDI-TOF/MS also showed it was most closely related to M. yunnanensis YIM 65004(T) and M. luteus NCTC 2665(T). Like other members of the genus Micrococcus, strain AE-6(T) had a high content of branched chain fatty acids (iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0). MK-8(H2) and MK-8 were the predominant isoprenoid quinones. Cell wall analysis showed an 'A2 L-Lys-peptide subunit' type of peptidoglycan and ribose to be the major cell wall sugar. The DNA G+C content was 70 mol%. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization of AE-6(T) with its closest relatives from the genus Micrococcus produced a value of less than 70%. Based on the results of this study, strain AE-6(T) could be clearly differentiated from other members of the genus Micrococcus. We propose that it represents a novel species of the genus Micrococcus and suggest the name Micrococcus aloeverae sp. nov., with strain AE-6(T) ( = MCC 2184(T) = DSM 27472(T)) as the type strain of the species.

Thermal annealing with temperatures of 780, 800 and 820 C has been investigated to improve electrical properties of the films. All the samples are shown along the (00l) orientation in rhombohedral structure with R anti 3c space group. With thermal annealing temperature increasing, insulator-metal transition temperature (T{sub p}) and resistivity at T{sub p} (Ï{sub T{sub p}}) of the epilayer reach optimal value of 288 K and 0.03 Î©.cm, respectively. The electrical properties improvement of the LBMO:Ag{sub 0.04} films is due to an improved film crystallization, oxygen balance and photon scattering suppression. The fitting curves show that the region of ferro-magnetic metallic (FM, T < T{sub p}) is fitted with grain/domain boundary, electron-electron and magnon scattering mechanism, as well as the region of para-magnetic insulating (PI, T > T{sub p}) is fitted with adiabatic small polaron hopping mechanism.

These materials are three-dimensional analogue of graphene. The present work is motivated by the recent prediction of Weyl semi-metallic phase in Bi1-xSbx alloys. In this paper we present the electronic transport properties studied under high applied magnetic fields in Bi0.96Sb0.04 alloys. The sample exhibits extremely high magneto-resistance; MR(5 K, 8 T) = 9.8Ã104 %. This value is comparable to the MR observed in recently discovered other members of these emergent materials. Most importantly, this composition shows large MR at room temperature, MR (300 K, 8 T) = 435%, which is almost twice to that observed in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 (= 200 % at 14.5 T) and Weyl semimetal NbP (= 250% at 9 T).

A polyphasic study was carried out to establish the taxonomic position of this strain. The organism formed single spores with rough surfaces on substrate mycelia. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain NEAU-QY2T belonged to the genus Plantactinospora and formed a monophyletic clade with its closest related strains Plantactinospora endophytica YIM 68255T (99.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Plantactinospora veratri NEAU-FHS4T (98.8 %) and Plantactinospora mayteni YIM 61359T(98.7 %), an association that was supported by a bootstrap value of 90 % in the neighbor-joining tree and also recovered with the maximum-likelihood algorithm. However, DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain NEAU-QY2T and the three closely related strains were below 70 %. With reference to phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA hybridization results, strain NEAU-QY2T was distinguished from closely related strains and is classified as representing a novel species of the genus Plantactinospora, for which the name Plantactinospora sonchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-QY2T (=CGMCC4.7216T=JCM 30345T).\n\n48 CFR 34.004 - Acquisition strategy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 48 Federal Acquisition Regulations System 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Acquisition strategy. 34...

The tunnel spectra show significant spatial inhomogeneity below T{sub C}, which reduces significantly as the temperature goes above the T{sub C}. We discuss these results in terms of an inhomogeneous electronic phase that may exist due to the vicinity of this composition to the quantum critical point.\n\nAndrographis paniculata extract (HMPL-004) for active ulcerative colitis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSandborn, William J; Targan, Stephan R; Byers, Vera S; Rutty, Dean A; Mu, Hua; Zhang, Xun; Tang, Tom\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAndrographis paniculata has in vitro inhibitory activity against TNF-Î±, IL-1Î² and NF-ÎºB. A pilot study of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) suggested similar efficacy to mesalamine for ulcerative colitis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) in 224 adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized to A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) 1,200 mg or 1,800 mg daily or placebo for 8 weeks. In total, 45 and 60% of patients receiving A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily, respectively, were in clinical response at week 8, compared with 40% of those who received placebo (P=0.5924 for 1,200 mg vs. placebo and P=0.0183 for 1,800 mg vs. placebo). In all, 34 and 38% of patients receiving A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily, respectively, were in clinical remission at week 8, compared with 25% of those who received placebo (P=0.2582 for 1,200 mg vs. placebo and P=0.1011 for 1,800 mg vs. placebo). Adverse events developed in 60 and 53% of patients in the A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily groups, respectively, and 60% in the placebo group. Patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis treated with A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) at a dose of 1,800 mg daily were more likely to achieve clinical response than those receiving placebo.\n\n41 CFR 101-39.004 - Optional operations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...-INTERAGENCY FLEET MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 39.0-General Provisions Â§ 101-39.004 Optional operations.

The organism formed single spores with smooth surface on substrate mycelia. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the strain had a close association with the genus Verrucosispora and shared the highest sequence similarity with Verrucosispora qiuiae RtIII47T (99.17â%), an association that was supported by a bootstrap value of 94â% in the neighbour-joining tree and also recovered with the maximum-likelihood algorithm. The strain also showed high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Xiangella phaseoli NEAU-J5T (98.78â%), Jishengella endophytica 202201T (98.51â%), Micromonospora eburnea LK2-10T (98.28â%), Verrucosispora lutea YIM 013T (98.23â%) and Salinispora pacifica CNR-114T (98.23â%). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on the gyrB gene sequences supported the conclusion that strain NEAU-QY3T should be assigned to the genus Verrucosispora. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization relatedness values between strain NEAU-QY3T and V. qiuiae RtIII47T and V. lutea YIM 013T were below 70â%. With reference to phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA hybridization results, strain NEAU-QY3T was readily distinguished from its most closely related strains and classified as a new species, for which the name Verrucosispora sonchi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-QY3T (=CGMCC 4.7312T=DSM 101530T).\n\n48 CFR 1910.004-73 - Offer evaluation and award, brand name or equal descriptions.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n..., brand name or equal descriptions. 1910.004-73 Section 1910.004-73 Federal Acquisition Regulations System... 1910.004-73 Offer evaluation and award, brand name or equal descriptions.

Good quality Ag{sub 0.96}Li{sub 0.04}NbO{sub 3} ceramics were obtained. Dielectric and DSC studies showed that, in comparison to AgNbO{sub 3,} temperatures of phase transitions slightly decrease. Dielectric studies pointed to enhancement of polar properties. Remnant polarisations achieves value of 0.6 Î¼C/cm{sup 2}. Maximum of Ïµ(T) dependences related to the relaxor-like ferroelectric/ferrielectric M{sub 1}âM{sub 2} transition becomes higher and more frequency dependent. Analysis of Raman spectra showed that two modes at 50 and 194 cm{sup â1} exhibit significant softening. Low frequency part of the Raman spectra which involve central peak and soft mode were analysed using two models. CP was assumed as relaxational vibration and described by Debye function. The slope of temperature dependences of relaxational frequency Î³{sub R}(T) changes at approximately 470 and 330 K, indicating that slowing down process of relaxational vibrations changes in the vicinity of partial freezing of Nb-ion dynamics T{sub f} and further freezing at ferroelectric/ferrielectric phase transition.\n\nZn influence on the plasticity of Cdo{0.96}Zn{0.04}Te\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nImhoff, D.; Zozime, A.; Triboulet, R.\n\n1991-11-01\n\nCompression tests were performed on CdTe and Cd{0.96}Zn{0.04}Te to elucidate the mechanism through which Zn inhibits dislocation formation and motion during CdTe crystal growth, thus leading to a decreasing of the dislocation density. Uniaxial deformation experiments performed with CdTe and CdZnTe at constant strain rate within a wide temperature range (0. 14;T_m le T le 0.87;T_m,;T_m = 1 365; K), have revealed a strong hardening effect of Zn within the whole temperature range. They also showed in CdZnTe a Portevin Le Chatelier effect between 770 K and 920 K confirmed by static strain aging experiments. Critical resolved shear stress (C.R.S.S.) values at T = 195; K and static strain aging results with CdZnTe point to size effect as the dominant interaction between Zn and dislocations. Thermal activation parameters were estimated in both materials. La dÃ©formation plastique a Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©e comme approche des mÃ©canismes par lesquels le zinc entrave le mouvement des dislocations au cours du processus de croissance cristalline de CdTe massif, rÃ©duisant ainsi la densitÃ© de dislocations. Les expÃ©riences de compression uniaxiale Ã vitesse constante, rÃ©alisÃ©es dans CdTe et CdZnTe entre 0,14 T_f et 0,87 T_f ont montrÃ© que le zinc est responsable d'un fort durcissement sur tout le domaine de tempÃ©ratures Ã©tudiÃ©. Les expÃ©riences de dÃ©formation dans CdZnTe ont mis en Ã©vidence un phÃ©nomÃ¨ne du type Portevin Le Chatelier entre 770 K et 920 K, confirmÃ© par des expÃ©riences de vieillissement statique. Les valeurs de scission critique tau_c Ã 195 K et les rÃ©sultats des expÃ©riences de vieillissement statique dans CdZnTe sont compatibles avec un effet de taille dominant pour les interactions Zndislocations.

Fibroblast activation is the hallmark of scleroderma, and disrupting the intracellular TGFÎ² signaling may provide a novel approach to controlling fibrosis. Because of its potential role in modulating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, both PPARÎ³ and CB2 receptors represent attractive targets for the development of cannabinoid-based therapies. We have developed a non-thiophilic and chemically stable derivative of the CBD quinol (VCE-004.8) that behaves as a dual agonist of PPARÎ³ and CB2 receptors, VCE-004.8 inhibited TGFÎ²-induced Col1A2 gene transcription and collagen synthesis. Moreover, VCE-004.8 inhibited TGFÎ²-mediated myofibroblast differentiation and impaired wound-healing activity. The anti-fibrotic efficacy in vivo was investigated in a murine model of dermal fibrosis induced by bleomycin. VCE-004.8 reduced dermal thickness, blood vessels collagen accumulation and prevented mast cell degranulation and macrophage infiltration in the skin. These effects were impaired by the PPARÎ³ antagonist T0070907 and the CB2 antagonist AM630. In addition, VCE-004.8 downregulated the expression of several key genes associated with fibrosis, qualifying this semi-synthetic cannabinoid as a novel compound for the management of scleroderma and, potentially, other fibrotic diseases.\n\nEstudio del D-004 sobre la defensa antioxidante endÃ³gena en ratas con hiperplasia prostÃ¡tica inducida por inyecciÃ³n de testosterona Study of D-004 on the endogenous antioxidant defence in rats presenting with prostate hyperplasia induced by testosterone injection\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYohani PÃ©rez Guerra\n\n2010-06-01\n\nprostatic hyperplasia induced by testosterone in rodents and to produce in vitro and in vivo antioxidant effects nut its effects on endogenous antioxidant4e system enzymes haven't been studied. Present paper researched the effects of D-004 oral treatment over 14 days on dismutase and catalase superoxide enzymes in rats with prostatic hyperplasia induced by testosterone. Animals were randomized distributed into 4 groups: a negative control ant three-testosterone injected: one treated with the vehicle (positive control and two with D-004 (400 and 800 mg/kg, respectively. The plasma total antioxidant ability was determined as well as the activity of catalase and dismutase superoxide enzymes in lysed erythrocyte and plasma, respectively.

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled pilot study, patients applied TMG 0.04% pump or vehicle once daily to the face for 12 weeks. Efficacy measures were changes in facial lesion counts, Investigator Global Evaluation of acne severity using two scales, and Investigator Global Assessment of Improvement from baseline to week 12. Of the 110 patients enrolled, 55 received TMG 0.04% pump, and 55 received vehicle. At week 12, there was significantly greater improvement in the least-squares mean change in noninflammatory lesions with TMG 0.04% than with vehicle (-19.9 vs -9.7, p = 0.04) and a significant difference in Investigator Global Assessment of improvement at week 12 between the children treated with TMG 0.04% pump and those treated with vehicle (p = 0.02), but there were no discernible differences in static acne severity scales. Change from baseline in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation were similar between the active and vehicle arms at week 12. This study demonstrated statistically significant differences in the reduction of noninflammatory lesions between TMG 0.04% pump and vehicle in patients aged 9-11 with acne vulgaris. Additional studies are warranted to further characterize the safety and efficacy of TMG 0.04% pump for the treatment of acne in the preadolescent population.

At ambient P, CO ordering transition and spin-canting in the AFM are observed at 223 K and 55 K respectively in M(T) and Ï(T) measurements. Application of P increases simultaneously the magnitude of magnetization (M) and transition temperature, and weakens the CO ordering in M(T) measurements up to 0.98 GPa. During Ï(T) measurements, P induces an insulatorâmetallic transition (T{sub IM}) at 1.02 GPa, and further increase of P up to 2.84 GPa leads to increase of T{sub IM} (dT{sub IM}/dP =21.6 K/GPa). Ï at T{sub IM} is reduced about three orders of magnitude at 2.84 GPa, and leads to the giant negative piezoresistance (~98%). These results are analyzed separately in two temperature regions i.e., below and above T{sub IM} by power function equation and small polaronic hopping model respectively. It is understood from these analyses that the application of P suppresses the JahnâTeller distortions, electronâelectron and electronâmagnon scattering factors, and induces the insulatorâmetal transition in Pr{sub 0.6}Ca{sub 0.4}Mn{sub 0.96}Al{sub 0.04}O{sub 3} system. - Highlights: â¢ Application of P on Pr{sub 0.6}Ca{sub 0.4}Mn{sub 0.96}Al{sub 0.04}O{sub 3} reduces resistivity (Ï) remarkably at low-temperatures, and exhibits an insulator to metallic transition at 1.02 GPa. â¢ The reduction in Ï by P is about three orders of magnitude at 2.84 GPa, leads to the giant negative piezoresistance about 98%. â¢ The effect of the suppression of JahnâTeller distortions, electronâelectron and electronâmagnon scattering under an applied P exhibits to the metal-Insulator transition. â¢ The phase-separation in this system has been tuned by both internal and external perturbations.\n\n76 FR 66940 - Privacy Act of 1974; Department of Homeland Security/United States Secret Service-004 Protection...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-10-28\n\n...

M.; Bysakh, S.; Sundararajan, G.; Chattopadhyay, K.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nNanoparticle agglomerates of passivated Fe ( n-Fe) and Fe0.96Cu0.04 ( n-Fe0.96Cu0.04), synthesized through the levitational gas condensation (LGC) process, were compacted and sintered using the conventional powder metallurgy method. The n-Fe0.96Cu0.04 agglomerates produced lower green density than n-Fe, and when compacted under pressure beyond 200 MPa, they underwent lateral cracking during ejection attributed to the presence of a passive oxide layer. Sintering under dynamic hydrogen atmosphere can produce a higher density of compact in n-Fe0.96Cu0.04 in comparison to n-Fe. Both the results of dilatometry and thermogravimetric (TG) measurements of the samples under flowing hydrogen revealed enhancement of the sintering process as soon as the reduction of oxide layers could be accomplished. The shrinkage rate of n-Fe0.96Cu0.04 reached a value three times higher than n-Fe at a low temperature of 723 K (450 Â°C) during heating. This enhanced shrinkage rate was the manifestation of accumulation of Cu at the surface of the particles. The formation of a thin-surface melted layer enriched with copper during heating to isothermal holding facilitated as a medium of transport for diffusion of the elements. The compacts produced by sintering at 773 K (500 Â°C), with relative density 82 pct, were found to be unstable and oxidized instantly when exposed to ambient atmosphere. The stable compacts of density more than 92 pct with 300- to 450-nm grain size could only be produced when sintering was carried out at 973 K (700 Â°C) and beyond. The 0.22 wt pct residual oxygen obtained in the sintered compact is similar to what is used for conventional ferrous powder metallurgy products.\n\nEvaluaciÃ³n genotÃ³xica del D-004, extracto del fruto de Roystonea regia, mediante el ensayo de micronÃºcleos Genotoxic assessment of D-004, extract from Roystonea regia fruit, by means of micronuclei assays\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaniel Francisco Arencibia Arrebola\n\n2009-08-01\n\nFull Text Available El D-004 es un extracto lipÃ­dico del fruto de la palma real (Roystonea regia, que ha demostrado ser eficaz en prevenir la hiperplasia prostÃ¡tica inducida por testosterona y por fenilefrina en modelos experimentales en ratas.

X-ray diffraction analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the structural, optical and surface properties of the films. By using the less reported TiCl4 solution, the optical band gap values falling into the visible region (between 2.70 eV and 2.92 eV) have been obtained for all films. Spectroscopic ellipsometry technique has been used to determine the dispersive refractive index and extinction coefficient of TiO2 films. Possible electrical conduction mechanisms in TiO2 films have been examined using temperature dependent conductivity measurements in the temperature range of 78-300 K. At room temperature, electrical resistivity values of TiO2 films change between 1.68 Ã 104 Î© cm and 5.88 Ã 104 Î© cm. Considering the analyzed parameters with respect to substrate temperature, this work refers to the properties of anatase TiO2 films that are strongly correlated to the growth direction, namely (004). As a result, (004) oriented anatase TiO2 films with appropriate optical band gap values are promising materials for technological applications, especially for photocatalysts.\n\nComparaciÃ³n de los efectos del D-004, imipramina y sertralina en el modelo de nado forzado en ratones Comparative effects of D-004, Imipramine and Sertraline in the forced swimming test in mice\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaisy Carbajal Quintana\n\n2012-09-01\n\nFull Text Available IntroducciÃ³n: La finasterida, inhibidor de la 5 a-reductasa, se emplea en el tratamiento de la hiperplasia prostÃ¡tica benigna, y ocasiona entre sus efectos adversos un aumento de cuadros de depresiÃ³n.

Jr.; Landow, M.P.; Pasupathi, V.; Klingensmith, R.W.\n\n1982-09-01\n\nA Connecticut Yankee fuel assembly (S004) was tested nondestructively and destructively. It was concluded that no obvious degradation of the 304L stainless steel-clad spent fuel from assembly S004 occurred during 5 y of storage in borated water. Furthermore, no obvious degradation due to the pool environment occurred on 304 stainless steel-clad rods in assemblies H07 and G11, which were stored for shorter periods but contained operationally induced cladding defects. The seam welds in the cladding on fuel rods from assembly S004, H07, and G11 were similar in that they showed a wrought microstructure with grains noticeably smaller than those in the cladding base metal. The end cap welds showed a dendritically cored structure, typical of rapidly quenched austenitic weld metal. Some intergranular melting may have occurred in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in the cladding adjacent to the end cap welds in rods from assemblies S004 and H07. However, the weld areas did not show evidence of corrosion-induced degradation\n\nDevelopment and validation of a GC method for the determination of D004 in emulsions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSierra Perez, Roxana; Rodriguez Leyes, Eduardo; Gonzalez Canavaciolo, Victor; Marrero Delange, David; Vicente Murillo, Roxanay; Velazquez Gomez Caridad\n\n2008-01-01\n\nD004 is a new active ingredient, composed of a mixture of fatty acids between 8 y 18 carbons atoms, with proved efficacy in experimental models of benig prostatic hyperplasia. With the aim to make the quality control of the emulsions used in pharmacological and toxicological studies (containing 20 - 300 mg/mL of active ingredient), a capillary gas chromatographic analytical method was developed and validated. The method was based on the extraction of the D004 active ingredient with n-hexane, and previous to the chromatographic analysis, a methylation process with 10 % acetyl chloride in methanol was carried out. The quantitative analysis, using tridecanoic acid as internal standard, was based on the determination of lauric acid. This is one of the majority acids in D004 and it was not affected by the interferences of the vehicle employed in emulsion preparation, fact that was demonstrated in the specificity assay. Good linearity (r = 0.999) and accuracy were proved over a range 10 - 500 mg/mL, with mean recoveries between 98 and 103 % that were not significantly different from 100 %, for p = 0.05. The coefficient of variation (CV = 0.71 %) of the precision study was < 2 %. According to these results, the method was suitable for quality control of D004 emulsions\n\nEleventh Hour Network+ Exam N10-004 Study Guide\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAlpern, Naomi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe 11th Hour Network+ Study Guide is keyed to theÂ N10-004 revision of the CompTIA Network+ exam.

All the samples show along the (00l) orientation in rhombohedral structure with R3c space group. The surface roughness (Ra), insulator-metal transition temperature (Tp) and resistivity at Tp (Ï{sub Tp}) of the LBMO:Ag{sub 0.04} films reached optimal values of 3.29 nm, 288 K and 0.033 Î© cm at 740 Â°C, respectively. The improvement of electrical transport properties in the films are attributed to the optimal growth temperature and Ag-doping improve the microstructure of the surfaces, grain boundaries (GBs) in connectivity and better crystallization. In addition, the electrical conduction behaviors can be well fitted with the grain/domain boundary, electronâelectron and magnon scattering mechanisms in the ferromagnetic metallic region (TT>Tp).\n\nAssociation of CISH -292A/T genetic variant with hepatitis B virus infection.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTong, Hoang V; Toan, Nguyen L; Song, Le H; Kremsner, Peter G; Kun, JÃ¼rgen F J; Tp, Velavan\n\n2012-04-01\n\nCytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 domain protein (CISH) is a suppressor of cytokine signaling that controls interleukin-2 signaling pathway. We investigated the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -292A>T in 473 Vietnamese hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers and 416 healthy controls. CISH variants at -292A>T were associated to HBV infection (Allelic: OR, 1.22 95% CI, 1-1.49; Pâ=â0.04; Recessive: OR, 1.69 95% CI 1.23-2.54; Pâ=â0.007).

This multicenter, randomized, doublemasked, active-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted at 32 centers across Latin America. Patients aged > or =18 years with OAG or OH were randomly assigned to receive topical travoprost 0.004% or latanoprost 0.005% 1 drop QD (9 PM) for 6 weeks (masked phase). At 6 weeks, all patients were assigned to receive open-label travoprost 0.004% 1 drop QD (9 PM) for 6 additional weeks (open-label phase). Study visits were scheduled at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. At each study visit, IOP was measured at 5 PM (+/-1 hour; approximately 20 hours after study drug administration). IOP changes from baseline were combined (pooled) from the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-week data to provide a comparison between the 2 treatment groups. Ocular adverse events (AEs) were monitored using slit-lamp examination. A total of 302 patients were enrolled (travoprost group, 155 patients; latanoprost group, 147 patients). The mean (SD) age of the travoprost group was 61.9 (10.6) years; 60.6% were female; and 47.1% were white. The mean (SD) age of the latanoprost group was 60.5 (12.4) years; 62.6% were female; and 49.0% were white. Mean IOP values were not significantly different between the travoprost and latanoprost groups at baseline (24.7 vs 24.2 mm Hg) or 6 weeks; however, the between-group difference in reductions from baseline in pooled IOP during the masked phase of the study was statistically significant (-8.3 vs -7.5 mm Hg; P = 0.009). At weeks 6 and 12, mean lOP levels were 16.1 and 16.2 mm Hg, respectively, in the travoprost group and 16.4 and 16.1 mm Hg in the group that was switched from latanoprost to travoprost (all, P = NS).

We investigated the time course of deep GM T2 hypointensity and its relationship with disability at 3T in 8 stable relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients treated with minocycline over 3years. MRI and disability measurements were compared at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36months. Grand mean deep GM T2 hypointensity was negatively correlated with EDSS over time (r=-0.94, P=0.02). This correlation was strongest in the head of caudate (r=-0.95, P=0.01) and putamen (r=-0.89, P=0.04). Additionally, baseline grand mean deep GM T2 hypointensity appears to predict third year EDSS (r=-0.72, P=0.04). These results suggest that iron associated deep GM injury correlates with patient disability in stable RRMS. Measurements of deep GM T2 hypointensity at high field MRI may prove to be useful in monitoring individuals with MS. Further studies are required to confirm these results in a large sample and to determine if T2 hypointensity changes in clinically active MS patients. Copyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The as-spun nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning technique. Nanofibers of the as-spun and calcined samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The XRD and TEM with selected electron diffraction (SEAD) analysis results indicate that the Ce{sub 0.96}Fe{sub 0.04}O{sub 2} nanofibers have a cubic perovskite structure without any secondary phase. The as-spun samples exhibit a diamagnetic behavior, whereas the calcined Ce{sub 0.96}Fe{sub 0.04}O{sub 2} samples are ferromagnetic having the specific magnetizations of 0.002â0.923 emu/g at 10 kOe. The results from XAS spectra show the valence state of Fe{sup 3+} and Fe{sup 2+} mixed in the Ce{sub 0.96}Fe{sub 0.04}O{sub 2} samples indicating oxygen vacancies in the nanofibers. Similarly, the results XPS spectra show that there are oxygen vacancies in the nanofibers as a result of Ce{sup 3+} on the surface. These oxygen vacancies play an important role to induce room temperature ferromagnetism (RT-FM) in the calcined Ce{sub 0.96}Fe{sub 0.04}O{sub 2} nanofibers. Our results indicate that the ferromagnetic properties of Ce{sub 0.96}Fe{sub 0.04}O{sub 2} system are intrinsic and are not a result of\n\nRole of Admission Troponin-T and Serial Troponin-T Testing in Predicting Outcomes in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVallabhajosyula, Saraschandra; Sakhuja, Ankit; Geske, Jeffrey B; Kumar, Mukesh; Poterucha, Joseph T; Kashyap, Rahul; Kashani, Kianoush; Jaffe, Allan S; Jentzer, Jacob C\n\n2017-09-09\n\nTroponin-T elevation is seen commonly in sepsis and septic shock patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We sought to evaluate the role of admission and serial troponin-T testing in the prognostication of these patients. This was a retrospective cohort study from 2007 to 2014 on patients admitted to the intensive care units at the Mayo Clinic with severe sepsis and septic shock. Elevated admission troponin-T and significant delta troponin-T were defined as â¥0.01Â ng/mL and â¥0.03Â ng/mL in 3Â hours, respectively. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1-year mortality and lengths of stay. During this 8-year period, 944 patients met the inclusion criteria with 845 (90%) having an admission troponin-T â¥0.01Â ng/mL. Serial troponin-T values were available in 732 (78%) patients. Elevated admission troponin-T was associated with older age, higher baseline comorbidity, and severity of illness, whereas significant delta troponin-T was associated with higher severity of illness. Admission log 10 troponin-T was associated with unadjusted in-hospital (odds ratio 1.6; P =0.003) and 1-year mortality (odds ratio 1.3; P =0.04), but did not correlate with length of stay. Elevated delta troponin-T and log 10 delta troponin-T were not significantly associated with any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Admission log 10 troponin-T remained an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.4; P =0.04) and 1-year survival (hazard ratio 1.3; P =0.008). In patients with sepsis and septic shock, elevated admission troponin-T was associated with higher short- and long-term mortality. Routine serial troponin-T testing did not add incremental prognostic value in these patients. Â© 2017 The Authors.

The analyzed dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. An inclusive and three differential measurements of the t t-bar charge asymmetry as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum, and invariant mass of the t t-bar system are presented. The measured inclusive t t-bar charge asymmetry is A(C) = 0.004 +/- 0.010 (stat.) +/- 0.011 (syst.). This result and the three differential measurements are consistent with zero asymmetry as well as with the predictions of the standard model.\n\n75 FR 26916 - Federal Acquisition Regulation: FAR Case 2009-004, Enhancing Contract Transparency\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-05-13\n\n...
