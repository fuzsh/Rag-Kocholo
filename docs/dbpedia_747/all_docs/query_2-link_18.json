        "text": "Fishkill, France Partner to Honor Lafayette\n\nAUGUST 27, 2023 - The American and French flags flew side-by-side on Sunday, August 27, 2023 as Fishkill took its place on the global stage for a ceremony in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette.\n\nDozens of residents and those with a passion for history came out under sunny skies to the Lafayette Monument located at the Rombout Rural Cemetery on Route 52, just a stone's throw from the Arrowhead where last year the Town dedicated a statue of Fishkill's native son Daniel Nimham.\n\npromptly commissioned him as a Major General in the Continental Army.\n\nWashington's faith in the teenage phenom would have a massive effect on the outcome of the war, as Lafayette would go on to become one of Washington's most trusted officers and led the Continental Army to victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781, effectively securing American independence.\n\n​\n\n​After the war, Lafayette returned to France, which was in the infancy of its own Revolution. Lafayette carried with him the principles found in the American Declaration of Independence, and penned a similar document for the French: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen - the document on which France's overthrow of its long-standing monarchy was based, paving the way for the modern Republic of France, which has been America's continual ally since.\n\nTown resident Elizabeth Baecher, who was born in France and escaped with her family as a small child upon the outbreak of World War II, delivered special welcoming remarks en francaise in a nod of respect to the Town's prestigious guest.\n\nM. Laban was preceded directly by County Executive William F.X. O'Neil, who spoke of Lafayette as a man before his time, whose ideas of equality for all were considered radical in certain circles, especially in Europe where centuries of monarchies and aristocratic rule had impressed ideas contrary to the equality of all people, but who persevered and voluntarily renounced his noble title, choosing instead to be known as we know him today - Lafayette.\n\n​After M. Laban's remarks, he and Supervisor Albra laid a wreath beside the monument before taps were played on the trumpet by Town secretary Greg Totino.\n\n​After the conclusion of the ceremony, Supervisor Albra, M. Laban and County Executive O'Neil joined other dignitaries for a tour of the Brinckerhoff Inn, located directly adjacent to the cemetery. Both properties date to the Revolution and beyond, and owner Bob Chiuli provided refreshments and offered M. Laban a tour of this historic house which now serves as a popular bed and breakfast. The visit was completed with an emotional tour of the very room in which Lafayette rested and recuperated for several weeks after falling gravely ill while traveling in the rain. M. Laban described the event as an honor and thanked the Town for its hospitality.\n\nSupervisor Albra and the Town Board extend their thanks to the Rombout Rural Cemetery and the Melzingah Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution for their partnership in staging this event, Councilman Carmine Istvan for donating his time and materials to provide landscaping around the Lafayette Monument, Eastern View Landscaping and Lee's Tree Service, the Fishkill and Dutchess County Historical Societies, the Brinckerhoff Inn and owner Bob Chiuli for their hospitality, Stephano's and Antonella's for catering, the Town of Fishkill Police Department for providing traffic service, the Town of Fishkill Police Cadets and Sgt. Murtagh for providing a snappy color guard, JM Party Tent Rentals, and the Town of Fishkill Buildings, Grounds and Parks Department team led by Brandon and Brian for their fantastic work setting up for the ceremony.\n\n​Fishkill History Preserved Ahead of America 250\n\nThe Town of Fishkill was able to obtain and scan a copy of an old Daughters of the American Revolution scrapbook dating to the 1890s, which contains newspaper clippings, handwritten DAR notes, and old photographs, detailing important events in Fishkill history, including the commemoration of the Revolutionary War Burial Grounds at the Fishkill Supply Depot and the dedication of the Lafayette Monument at the Rombout Rural Cemetery.\n\nFishkill Celebrates Daniel Nimham Statue Dedication\n\nJUNE 11, 2022 - More than 300 Fishkill residents, dignitaries, representatives of the Native American community and historical re-enactors gathered Saturday for a celebration as the Town dedicated a statue to its greatest native son, Sachem Daniel Nimham.\n\n​\n\nThe ceremony was held at The Arrowhead intersection of Routes 52 and 82, where the statue was installed last month. Town Supervisor Ozzy Albra and the Town Board hosted the event, which featured comments from local leaders, special presentations from the Native American community, and remarks from statue sculptor and world-renowned artist Michael Keropian.\n\nDutchess County Sheriff Kirk A. Imperati spoke about the significance of Saturday's event as an opportunity to unite behind our shared history as Americans.\n\n\"On the surface we all look different, but at our core we are the same,\" Sheriff Imperati said. \"Everyone here today, is Daniel Nimham's legacy.\"\n\nSheriff Imperati noted the progress our nation has made in the 250 years since Nimham and others fought and died in the American Revolution.\n\n​\n\n\"Daniel Nimham strived during his life to ensure the equal dignity of his people among the colonists who populated our area,\" he said. \"More than two centuries later, my solemn oath as Dutchess County Sheriff is to protect the dignity, equality, and the natural rights of everyone I encounter.\"\n\nTown Board to Host \"On-the-Run\" Meeting at Mount Gulian\n\n​Town Supervisor Ozzy Albra and the Town Board will hold a unique “On-the-Run” meeting on June 16, 2021 at 7pm at the Mount Gulian Historic Site on Sterling Street. This meeting will be a full Town Board meeting identical those held at Town Hall, including multiple opportunities for residents to speak to the Board about Town matters.\n\nSupervisor Albra said the “On-the-Run” meeting is part of his administration’s larger initiative to make local government open, transparent, and fully accessible for residents.\n\n“We’ve created the most transparent government in the history of the Town of Fishkill,” Albra said. “In the past year-and-a-half, we’ve taken the power away from developers and given it back to the citizens.”\n\nThe current Town Board, comprising Supervisor Albra and Councilmembers Jacqueline Bardini, Ori Brachfeld, Louise Daniele and Kenya Gadsden, has adopted several items of legislation aimed at creating and maintaining a transparent, accessible system where residents’ voices are heard and civic-minded citizens are invited to be part of the process.\n\n​Supervisor Albra’s administration has constantly been striving to make voices heard. Beginning with the very first regular meeting of the Town Board, Supervisor Albra changed the structure of Town Board meetings to permit residents to address the Board at the beginning of the meeting, breaking from the previous administration’s procedure which often required residents to wait through two to three hours of Board discussion before being permitted to speak.\n\nWithin three months of taking office, the Town Board unanimously voted to keep Supervisor Albra’s campaign promise to enact a law establishing term limits, limiting the Town Supervisor and Town Councilmembers to serve no more than two four-year terms. Of the more than 900 towns in New York, fewer than 10 have similar term limit laws, and none are as strict as the Town of Fishkill’s.\n\nUpon taking office, Supervisor Albra set about making changes in Town Hall which increase access and opportunity for Town Board members. While Town Board members had no place in Town Hall under the previous administration, Supervisor Albra took space from his own office to create an office space for Town Board members to use at their convenience, equipped with a computer, phone and printer.\n\nSupervisor Albra also gave Town Board members freedom to communicate with Town staff as well as the Town attorney and engineer and to request information at any time, a break from the previous administration.\n\n“As Supervisor, I want to work with a Town Board that is engaged, informed and ready to get to work,” Albra said. “The Councilmembers are free to come and go as they please and to ask any questions at any time, which did not happen previously.”\n\nOther modifications in Town Hall included the installation of safety glass at every service window at Town Hall, an action taken by the Town Board to enable Fishkill to be the only municipality in Dutchess County to remain open and serving the public throughout the entirety of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupervisor Albra’s administration has not stopped there. In the past year, the Town Board has worked with the Planning Board to restructure Planning Board procedure to follow the Town Board’s example and allow residents to offer informal comments at the beginning of Planning Board review of proposed projects. This is an unprecedented but necessary decision for the Town, as it enables residents to be heard and to offer ideas and concerns throughout the planning process, instead of remaining silent until a Public Hearing is held. Supervisor Albra applauded the Planning Board’s decision.\n\n“The citizens of the Town of Fishkill have a right to voice their opinions and be a part of the process when their quality of life is at stake,” Albra said.\n\nSupervisor Albra and the Town Board have likewise moved to improve the publication of Public Hearings, by extending the guidelines for public notice to the Town Board. These guidelines had previously only existed to govern the Planning Board.\n\nThroughout his administration, Supervisor Albra has prioritized improving and revamping the Town Code to make the Town’s laws straightforward and easy to understand. For months, Supervisor Albra has consulted with the Town Building Inspector, Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals, the Town engineer and the Town Attorney to update Chapters 150 and 132 of the Town Code, which relate to Zoning and the Subdivision of Land.\n\n“We’re talking about two very important sections of code which are also very technical and can be difficult to understand,” Albra said. “These revisions are removing a lot of ambiguity and streamlining the process so residents can both understand the regulations and navigate them more easily.”\n\nThe Town Board held a Public Hearing on the revisions to Chapters 150 and 132 at the May 5, 2021 Town Board meeting. To encourage further public comment, the Board continued that public hearing to Wednesday’s meeting at Mount Gulian. Residents can review the proposed changes on the Town website at www.fishkill-ny.gov and will be allowed to offer their opinions or ask any questions at the Public Hearing on Wednesday.\n\nThe Mount Gulian Historic site is located at 145 Sterling Street. Signs posted by the Town along Route 9D will guide residents to the site, which was the location of General Friedrich von Steuben’s headquarters during the American Revolution, where he played a pivotal role in assisting George Washington and the Continental Army in their victory over the British. For more information about the historic site, which is one of Fishkill’s numerous historical resources, visit https://www.mountgulian.org\n\nTown of Fishkill Observes Memorial Day 2021\n\n​Monday was a day full of solemn remembrance as the Town of Fishkill observed Memorial Day. The day began with a wreath-laying at the Town War Memorial Park, attended by Supervisor Ozzy Albra, Councilwomen Jackie Bardini, Kenya Gadsden and Louise Daniele, Town Clerk Rebecca Tompkins and Police Commissioner Dennis Zack. A wreath was given to the Town for the occasion by the Verplanck Garden Club, and the wreath was placed by Councilwoman Daniele's son Charlie, in remembrance of all Fishkill's heroes who have given their lives in service of our nation.\n\nTown officials then went to the Fishkill Rural Cemetery for a Memorial Day Ceremony, capped with a stirring graveside dedication at the grave of Civil War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Elijah A. Briggs, 2nd Connecticut Heavy Artillery. Supervisor Albra spoke about Sgt. Briggs and his regiment, and their remarkable journey from guard duty at forts near Washington DC to storming Confederate trenches in some of the Civil War's deadliest battles, including Cold Harbor and Petersburg. Sgt. Briggs earned the Medal of Honor for his actions on April 6, 1865 when he captured a Confederate battle flag at Petersburg. He settled in Fishkill after the war, and lived to the age of 78 before passing away in 1922.\n\nSupervisor Albra Memorial Day Speech from Peter Skorewicz/Video Ventures on Vimeo.\n\nKeynote remarks were given by DAR General President Denise Van Buren, who offered a stirring tribute to Congressman Hamilton Fish, who was the driving force behind the creation of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was erected at Arlington National Cemetery 100 years ago. A graveside ceremony at Sgt. Briggs' grave brought proceedings to an end at the cemetery.\n\nThe day ended in spirited fashion as Town officials joined other dignitaries, including Village of Fishkill Mayor Jim Miccio, County Legislator Doug McHoul, County Executive Marcus Molinaro and Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney for a parade through the streets of the village, followed by a ceremony at the Village War Memorial.\n\nSupervisor Albra wishes to thank all the Town officials and dignitaries who attended Monday's events, the Fishkill Rural Cemetery Board of Trustees and President Sterling Gaston, Denise Van Buren, Mayor Jim Miccio, and the Town of Fishkill Police Department for providing a color guard for Monday's ceremonies.\n\nFishkill, Dutchess County Welcome Tesla\n\nSupervisor Ozzy Albra and other dignitaries met Thursday to officially welcome Tesla to the Town of Fishkill at the ribbon-cutting of the new Tesla Supercharger station at 18 Westage Drive.\n\n“I’m proud to welcome Tesla to Fishkill, and I congratulate them on this occasion,” Albra said before cutting a ribbon fashioned to a Tesla vehicle, officially opening the charging site.\n\nThe Tesla Supercharger station features 12 Tesla Supercharger units which run on V3 technology, and can supply Tesla vehicles with power for up to 180 miles of driving range in only 15 minutes. An additional generic charging unit at the station can accommodate other electric car models. This accommodation was done free-of-charge by Tesla at the request of Supervisor Albra.\n\nTesla rep Shiva Krishna brought a Tesla Model Y to the station to demonstrate the vehicle’s features and the capabilities of Tesla’s Supercharger unit. Krishna explained what separates a Supercharger unit from other electric vehicle charging units.\n\n“The difference is that the Supercharger can fully charge a vehicle in 25 minutes,” Krishna said.\n\nAlbra said Tesla’s arrival in Fishkill is in keeping with his ambitions for the Town.\n\n“As Town Supervisor, I’ve prioritized making Fishkill an example of being on the cutting edge, and Fishkill is moving to the front and taking a leadership role here in our area,” Albra said. “Tesla is a company that’s also on the cutting edge, with their space program and innovations in green technology through electric cars that are changing the game. This represents the future.”\n\nDavid Livshin is the President and CEO of the Dagar Group, which manages the Hudson Valley Towne Center at 18 Westage Drive. Livshin said the station promises to be a boon for businesses in the area.\n\nWe were very pleased to have the ribbon cutting of the Tesla super charger and generic stations today, Livshin said. “We feel this location will attract more people to this Southern Dutchess location. I want to thank Tesla for sending up their representative and a Tesla for the event.”\n\nSupervisor Albra was joined by Town Clerk Rebecca Tompkins, East Fishkill Supervisor Nicholas D’Alessandro, County Legislator Doug McHoul, and Lynne Versaci. McHoul and Versaci presented proclamations on behalf of County Executive Marcus Molinaro and State Senator Sue Serino, respectively.\n\n​\n\n“Congratulations to Fishkill and Tesla, on behalf of Dutchess County,” McHoul said.\n\nSupervisor Albra's 2021 State of the Town Remarks\n\nClick below to read Supervisor Albra's remarks on the State of the Town as we move into 2021\n\nCommending a Local Girl Scout\n\nSupervisor Albra and the Town Board extended their congratulations and thanks to Fishkill Girl Scout Kelly See. Kelly recently completed work on a shade structure at the Town of Fishkill Friendly Paws Dog Park. This shade structure will keep our furry friends and their human companions cool from the heat and dry from the rain for years to come. The shade structure is Kelly's Girl Scout Silver Award project, and Kelly was presented with a Proclamation from the Town for her good work, presented by Town Clerk Rebecca Tompkins, Councilwoman Kenya Gadsden and Councilwoman Louise Daniele - all former Girl Scouts."
