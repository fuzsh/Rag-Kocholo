        "text": "Effects of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) form and administration mode on PABA recovery in 24-hour urine collections.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Rashmi S; Joy, Raechel C; Boushey, Carol J; Ferruzzi, Mario G; Leonov, Alexei P; McCrory, Megan A\n\n2014-03-01\n\nPara-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) has long been used as an objective measure to assess completeness of 24-hour urine collections. However, pharmaceutical-grade PABA for human ingestion is not available in the United States. An alternative, the potassium salt of PABA, aminobenzoate potassium, can be obtained for clinical use, although it has not yet been validated in this role. Both PABA and aminobenzoate potassium can be directly ingested in their tablet or capsule forms or added to food before consumption. Our aim was to investigate the effect of form (PABA vs aminobenzoate potassium) and administration mode (directly ingested as a tablet/capsule vs added to food) on urinary PABA recovery levels. Twenty healthy participants underwent 3 test days separated by two 24-hour wash-out periods. Three test conditions, one on each test day, were investigated in randomized order: PABA tablet, aminobenzoate potassium capsule, and PABA or aminobenzoate potassium in food. Ingestion of each dose was supervised and participants performed the 24-hour urine collections while free-living. The 24-hour urine collections were analyzed for PABA recovery (%R) levels using a colorimetric assay. Recoveries 85% to 110% were deemed complete and those >110% were reanalyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Only complete collections (>85%R) were included in analyses. The recovery for the PABA tablet, aminobenzoate potassium capsule, and PABA/aminobenzoate potassium in food were similar at 98.8%RÂ±2.0%R, 95.1%RÂ±2.3%R, and 93.2%RÂ±2.1%R, respectively, and did not differ significantly. These results suggest that aminobenzoate potassium may be used as an alternative to PABA for assessing the completeness of 24-hour urine collections and to track compliance with consuming provided diets in community-dwelling studies.

Understanding mushroomâs innate heat-tolerance mechanisms may facilitate genetic improvements of their thermotolerance. Agaricus bisporus strain 02 is a relatively thermotolerant mushroom strain, while strain 8213 is quite thermo-sensitive. Here, we compared their responses at proteomic level to heat treatment at 33Â°C. We identified 73 proteins that are differentially expressed between 02 and 8213 or induced upon heat stress in strain 02 itself, 48 of which with a known identity. Among them, 4 proteins are constitutively more highly expressed in 02 than 8213; and they can be further upregulated in response to heat stress in 02, but not in 8213. One protein is encoded by the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) synthase gene Pabs, which has been shown to scavenge the reactive oxygen species in vitro. Pabs mRNA and its chemical product PABA show similar heat stress induction pattern as PABA synthase protein and are more abundant in 02, indicating transcriptional level upregulation of Pabs upon heat stress. A specific inhibitor of PABA synthesis impaired thermotolerance of 02, while exogenous PABA or transgenic overexpression of 02 derived PABA synthase enhanced thermotolerance of 8213. Furthermore, compared to 8213, 02 accumulated less H2O2 but more defense-related proteins (e.g., HSPs and Chitinase) under heat stress. Together, these results demonstrate a role of PABA in enhancing mushroom thermotolerance by removing H2O2 and elevating defense-related proteins.

In this work, homogeneous photocatalysis has been applied for the degradation of UV filter para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which exists in several types of PCPs, in order to identify the optimum degradation conditions. The oxidation of PABA by photo-Fenton and oxalate-induced photo-Fenton (ferrioxalate) processes was investigated, and the effect of various operating variables has been assessed, i.e., Fe 3+ (0.0035-0.014Â gÂ L -1 ), H 2 O 2 (0.025-0.2Â gÂ L -1 ), T (280-323Â K), and type of radiation (UV-A, visible). Furthermore, experiments under optimal conditions have been performed in order to evaluate the transformation pathways and phytotoxicity of the treated PABA solution.\n\n[Vitamin para-aminobenzoic acid inhibits development of SOS function in tif-1 mutants of Escherichia coli at nonpermissive temperatures].\n\nPubMed\n\nVasil'eva, S V; Gorb, T E; Rapoport, I A\n\n1983-12-01\n\nThe development of \"SOS\" inducible functions in lysogenic and non-lysogenic strains of Escherichia coli tif-1 sfiA11 (lambda) at nonpermissive temperature of 42 degrees C was strongly suppressed by para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The rate of prophage lambda induction decreased 400 times, as compared to the control level; the efficiency of W-reactivation of UV-irradiated phage lambda decreased 37.5 to 16%. PABA also inhibited to some extent (1.5 times) the process of inducible recombination on the RecF pathway. The processes of spontaneous lambda induction and W-reactivation, as well as spontaneous recombination on RecBC and RecF pathways, were not influenced by PABA. The above data are in accordance with previous studies of PABA action when the manifestation of \"SOS\" functions was induced by chemical mutagens. The action of PABA has been tentatively interpreted on the basis of negative control of \"SOS\" repair pathway.\n\nThe influence of solution environment on the nucleation kinetics and crystallisability of para-aminobenzoic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurner, T D; Corzo, D M C; Toroz, D; Curtis, A; Dos Santos, M M; Hammond, R B; Lai, X; Roberts, K J\n\n2016-10-05\n\nThe influence of solvent type on the solution thermodynamics, nucleation-kinetics and crystal growth of alpha para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) crystallising from supersaturated ethanol, acetonitrile and water solutions, is examined using poly-thermal analysis of the metastable zone width. Application of a recently proposed model for analysis of crystallisation kinetics (J. Cryst. Growth, 2010, 312, 698-704) indicates a solvent and concentration dependence of the nucleation mechanism and key nucleation parameters for the alpha form of PABA. The mechanism of nucleation is found to change from instantaneous to progressive with decreasing concentration and also when changing the solvent from ethanol to acetonitrile to water. The dependence of the nucleation mechanism is correlated to the kinetic component of the nucleation rate through calculated values of instantaneously nucleated crystallites, which increase from 1.40 Ã 10 9 m -3 in ethanol to 1.08 Ã 10 10 m -3 in acetonitrile to 2.58 Ã 10 10 m -3 in water. This in combination with low calculated number concentrations of interfacial tension between 1.13 and 2.71 mJ m -2 , supports the conclusion that the kinetic component of the nucleation rate is more limiting when crystallising PABA from ethanol solutions in comparison to water solutions. This finding is further supported by molecular dynamics simulations of the solvation free energy of PABA, which is found to be greatest in water, -42.4 kJ mol -1 and lowest in ethanol, -58.5 kJ mol -1 .\n\nUVA-potentiated damage to calf thymus DNA by Fenton reaction system and protection by para-aminobenzoic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nShih, M K; Hu, M L\n\n1996-03-01\n\nCalf thymus DNA was irradiated with low-intensity UVA (main output at 365 nm, 2 mW cm-2 or 36 kJ m-2 for 30 min), and the role of metal ions, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was examined. DNA damage was measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (possibly from degradation of deoxyribose) and as changes in ethidium bromide-DNA fluorescence due to unwinding from strand breaks. Under the present experimental conditions, UVA alone or in the presence of H2O2 had no effect on DNA but slightly enhanced the damage by iron/EDTA. Ultraviolet A strongly enhanced DNA damage (ca four- to five-fold) by the Fenton reaction system (50 microM Fe2+/100 microM EDTA + 0.5 mM H2O2). The results suggest that the Fenton reaction system was \"photosensitized\" to damage DNA by low-intensity UVA radiation. The enhanced damage by UVA was attributed in part to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Ultraviolet A had no effect when iron (ferric or ferrous) ions were replaced by Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ or Cd2+. The ROS involved in the UVA-enhanced damage to DNA by the Fenton reagents were OH and, to a lesser extent, superoxide anions. The UVA-potentiated DNA damage by the Fenton reaction system was then used to examine the protective effect of para-aminobenzoate (PABA), a UVB-absorbing sunscreen that protects against photocarcinogenesis in hairless mice. The results show that PABA and mannitol dose-dependently inhibited the damage with concentrations required for 50% inhibition at 0.1 mM and 3 mM, respectively. The protection by PABA was attributed to its radical-scavenging ability because PABA does not absorb light in the UVA region. These findings may be relevant to the biological damage by UVA and suggest that PABA is useful in protection against photocarcinogenesis by wide-range UV radiation.\n\n[Photodegradation of UV filter PABA in nitrate solution].\n\nPubMed\n\nMeng, Cui; Ji, Yue-Fei; Zeng, Chao; Yang, Xi\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe aqueous photolysis of a UV filter p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) using Xe lamp as simulated solar irradiation source was investigated in the presence of nitrate ions. The effects of pH, concentration of nitrate ions and concentration of humic substance in natural water on the photodegradation of PABA were studied. The results showed that photodegradation of PABA in nitrate solution followed the first order kinetics. The increasing concentration of nitrate ion increased favored the photodegradaton of PABA, of which the first order constant increased from 0.002 2 min(-10 to 0.017 9 min(-1). The photodegradation of PABA promoted with the increase of pH while the increasing concentration of humic substance showed inhibiting effect. Hydroxyl radicals determined by the molecular probe method played a very importnant role in the photolysis process of PABA. Photoproducts upon irradiation of PABA in nitrate solution were isolated by means of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and identified by LC-MS techniques. The probable photoinduced degradation pathways in nitrate solution were proposed.\n\nBinding Isotope Effects for para-Aminobenzoic Acid with Dihydropteroate Synthase from Staphylococcus aureus and Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nPubMed\n\nStratton, Christopher F; Namanja-Magliano, Hilda A; Cameron, Scott A; Schramm, Vern L\n\n2015-10-16\n\nDihydropteroate synthase is a key enzyme in folate biosynthesis and is the target of the sulfonamide class of antimicrobials. Equilibrium binding isotope effects and density functional theory calculations indicate that the substrate binding sites for para-aminobenzoic acid on the dihydropteroate synthase enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus and Plasmodium falciparum present distinct chemical environments. Specifically, we show that para-aminobenzoic acid occupies a more sterically constrained vibrational environment when bound to dihydropteroate synthase from P. falciparum relative to that of S. aureus. Deletion of a nonhomologous, parasite-specific insert from the plasmodial dihydropteroate synthase abrogated the binding of para-aminobenzoic acid. The loop specific to P. falciparum is important for effective substrate binding and therefore plays a role in modulating the chemical environment at the substrate binding site.\n\nCatalytic Photodegradation of p-aminobenzoic Acid on TiO 2 Nanowires with High Surface Area.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSoto, Loraine; RodrÃ­guez, Tracey; MÃ¡rquez, Francisco\n\nPharmaceutical personal care products (PPCPâs) production and consumption have increased exponentially in recent years due to medicine and technology advances related to the development of dangerous skin diseases such as cancer. These PPCPâs usually are found in wastewaters and their removal represents a very important environmental issue. With the aim of studying the possible degradation of these compounds, we have synthesized TiO 2 nanowires (rutile phase) that have been fully characterized by BET measurements, XRD and SEM and used in the photodegradation reaction of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Furthermore, we studied the photocatalytic degradation of PABA under different experimental conditions (i.e.moreÂ Â» catalyst loading). The photocatalytic reaction was monitored as a function of time by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The highest degradation rate occurred with 1.0 g L-1 of catalyst while the reaction does not proceed without radiation or in absence of the catalyst. Our present work demonstrates that p-aminobenzoic acid could be successfully degraded in a relatively short time period with high degradation percentages.Â«Â less\n\nCatalytic Photodegradation of p-aminobenzoic Acid on TiO 2 Nanowires with High Surface Area.\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSoto, Loraine; RodrÃ­guez, Tracey; MÃ¡rquez, Francisco\n\n2014-06-10\n\nPharmaceutical personal care products (PPCPâs) production and consumption have increased exponentially in recent years due to medicine and technology advances related to the development of dangerous skin diseases such as cancer.

Both the ortho-isomer (anthranilate) and PABA derive from the central shikimate pathway metabolite chorismate while the meta-isomer is not available by that route and starts from UDP-3-aminoglucose. PABA is largely funnelled into folate biosynthesis while anthranilate is the scaffold for biosynthetic elaboration into many natural heterocycles, most notably with its role in indole formation for tryptophan biosynthesis. Anthranilate is also converted to benzodiazepinones, fumiquinazolines, quinoxalines, phenoxazines, benzoxazolinates, quinolones, and phenazines, often with redox enzyme participation. The 5-hydroxy form of 3-aminobenzaote is the starter unit for ansa-bridged rifamycins, ansamitocins, and geldanamycins, whereas regioisomers 2-hydroxy, 4-hydroxy and 2,4-dihydroxy-3-aminobenzoate are key components of antimycin, grixazone, and platencin and platensimycin biosynthesis, respectively. The enzymatic mechanisms for generation of the aminobenzoate regioisomers and their subsequent utilization for diverse heterocycle and macrocycle construction are examined.\n\nUnveiling self-sensitized photodegradation pathways by DFT calculations: A case of sunscreen p-aminobenzoic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Siyu; Chen, Jingwen; Zhao, Qing; Xie, Qing; Wei, Xiaoxuan\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSelf-sensitized photodegradation has been observed for diverse aquatic organic pollutants. However, photodegradation pathways have not been clarified in previous experimental studies. Here, we attempted to probe self-sensitized photodegradation pathways of organic pollutants employing both photolytic experiments and density functional theory calculations. By performing photolytic experiments, we found that singlet state oxygen ((1)O2) play an essential role in photodegradation of a sunscreen p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA can photogenerate (1)O2 and react fast with (1)O2. We hypothesized that PABA underwent (1)O2 induced self-sensitized photodegradation. By calculating transition states, intermediates and reaction barriers, we found that (1)O2 can oxidize PABA through electrophilic attacks on the benzene ring to abstract one H atom of the amino group following a 1,3-addition mechanism or to induce decarboxylation. Either pathway produces a hydroperoxide. O-O bond cleavage of the hydroperoxides occurring at ground states or the lowest triplet excited states can produce phenoxyl radical precursors of 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminophenol, which are photodegradation products detected in experiments. Thus, a viable (1)O2 self-sensitized photodegradation mechanism was unveiled for PABA. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In some systems, an API can form cocrystals in multiple stoichiometries with the same coformer. However, it remains unclear how coformer stoichiometry influences solubility. This paper investigates the pharmaceutical:coformer pair carbamazepine (CBZ)/p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA); both CBZ/PABA 1:1 and 2:1 cocrystals are known, and a novel 4:1 CBZ/PABA cocrystal is reported here. The 4:1 cocrystal is structurally characterized, and phase stability data suggest that it is a thermodynamically unstable form. Dissolution experiments show that there is no correlation between the cocrystal stoichiometry and dissolution rate in this system. On the other hand, with the relatively weak intermolecular interactions, metastable forms can be beneficial to dissolution rate, which suggests that more effort should be devoted to cocrystal production with kinetic growth methods.\n\nInfluence of Coformer Stoichiometric Ratio on Pharmaceutical Cocrystal Dissolution: Three Cocrystals of Carbamazepine/4-Aminobenzoic Acid\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Zi; Matzger, Adam J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCocrystallization is a technique to optimize solid forms that shows great potential to improve the solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

The aromatic ring 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB) is commonly depicted as the sole aromatic ring precursor in Q biosynthesis despite the recent finding that para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) also serves as a ring precursor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Q biosynthesis. In this study, we employed aromatic 13C6-ring-labeled compounds including 13C6-4HB, 13C6-pABA, 13C6-resveratrol, and 13C6-coumarate to investigate the role of these small molecules as aromatic ring precursors in Q biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, S. cerevisiae, and human and mouse cells. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, neither E. coli nor the mammalian cells tested were able to form 13C6-Q when cultured in the presence of 13C6-pABA. However, E. coli cells treated with 13C6-pABA generated 13C6-ring-labeled forms of 3-octaprenyl-4-aminobenzoic acid, 2-octaprenyl-aniline, and 3-octaprenyl-2-aminophenol, suggesting UbiA, UbiD, UbiX, and UbiI are capable of using pABA or pABA-derived intermediates as substrates. E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and human and mouse cells cultured in the presence of 13C6-resveratrol or 13C6-coumarate were able to synthesize 13C6-Q. Future evaluation of the physiological and pharmacological responses to dietary polyphenols should consider their metabolism to Q.

G.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nPotentiating combinations of 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) competitors, such as sulfadoxine, sulfalene, or dapsone, and dihydrofolate dehydrogenasea (1.5.1.4) inhibitors, such as pyrimethamine or proguanil, have been subjected to various trials over the last decade. By and large they have proved to be effective agents against drug-resistant strains of malaria parasites, and with the small doses required they have been free of toxic effects. Parasite resistance to such combinations has seldom occurred but may be associated with cross-resistance to other combinations. These combinations should be reserved for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant infections and for use as adjuvants in organized malaria eradication campaigns.

However, bioconcentration testing rarely accounts for the influence of natural aquatic environmental factors. In order to better assess the ecological risk of organic UV filters (OUV-Fs) in an actual water environment, this study determined the influences of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (0, 1, 10, and 20Â mg/L) and feeding (0, 0.5, 1, and 2% body weight/d) on bioconcentration of ethylhexyl dimethyl p-aminobenzoate (OD-PABA) in various tissues of crucian carp (Carassius auratus). Moreover, oxidative stress in the fish liver caused by the OD-PABA was also investigated by measuring activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), and levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The bioconcentration of OD-PABA in the fish tissues was significantly decreased with the presence of DOM indicating a reduction of OD-PABA bioavailability caused by DOM. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) decreased by 28.00~50.93% in the muscle, 72.67~96.74% in the gill, 37.84~87.72% in the liver, and 10.32~79.38% in the kidney at different DOM concentrations compared to those of the non-DOM treatments. Significant changes in SOD, CAT, GST, GSH, and MDA levels were found in the DOM- and OD-PABA-alone treatments. However, there were no significant differences in the SOD, CAT, GST, and MDA levels found when co-exposure to OD-PABA and DOM. Feeding led to lower OD-PABA concentrations in the fish tissues, and the concentrations were decreased with increasing feeding ratios. BCFs in various tissues reduced by 39.75~72.52% in the muscle, 56.86~79.73% in the gill, 66.41~87.50% in the liver, and 75.88~89.10% in the kidney, respectively. In the unfed treatments, the levels of SOD and MDA were significantly higher than those of the fed ones while GST and GSH levels were remarkably inhibited indicating the enhanced effect of starvation\n\nIdentification of N-Hydroxy-para-aminobenzoic acid in a cyanotic child after benzocaine exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpiller, H A; Russell, J L; Casavant, M J; Ho, R Y; Gerona, R R\n\n2014-11-01\n\nMethemoglobinemia (MetHb) after exposure to benzocaine (BZC) has been reported for more than 50 years, however the pathophysiologic mechanism has not been previously established. Direct administration of BZC to blood does not produce MetHb. After topical use, due to the lipophilicity and rapid acetylation in the tissue, little BZC reaches the liver for hepatic biotransformation. However, isolated human livers have been shown to produce MetHb forming N-hydroxyl metabolites from BZC. We report a case of BZC-induced MetHb with the first identification and quantification of the reactive metabolite responsible for the oxidative stress: N-Hydroxy-Para-amino benzoic acid (N-OH-PABA). An 8 year old male was admitted to a hospital for an appendectomy. Several applications of BZC spray were used during multiple attempts at nasogastric tube placement. In various attempts to achieve local anesthesia, benzocaine spray was used in both nares and through the mouth aimed at the posterior oropharynx. The patient subsequently became cyanotic with an initial MetHb level of 32.9 %. Methylene blue was administered and the patient promptly responded with resolution of cyanosis. Blood taken within 20 min of the initial symptoms contained benzocaine (5.2ug/mL), bupivacaine (740ng/mL), lidocaine (530ng/mL), acetaminophen (12ug/mL), midazolam (60ng/mL), PABA and N-OH-PABA (35ng/mL). Serum was analyzed using Liquid Chromatography- Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Mass spectrometry was done using an electrospray ionization source run in negative and positive polarities. A reference standard for N-OH-PABA was synthesized for confirmation and quantification. The rare and idiopathic nature of methemoglobinemia after benzocaine use has made study of the pathophysiologic mechanism in humans difficult. Lack of understanding has brought calls for restriction of use of the widely used medication that may not be based on evidence. Our case presents several unique features: 1) benzocaine\n\n40 CFR 721.2900 - Substituted aminobenzoic acid ester (generic name).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 40 Protection of Environment 30 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Substituted aminobenzoic acid ester...

In plant tissues, however, pABA is known to occur predominantly as its glucose ester (pABA-Glc), and the role of this metabolite in folate synthesis has not been defined. In this study, the UDP-glucose:pABA acyl-glucosyltransferase (pAGT) activity in Arabidopsis extracts was found to reside principally (95%) in one isoform with an apparent Km for pABA of 0.12 mm. Screening of recombinant Arabidopsis UDP-glycosyltransferases identified only three that recognized pABA. One of these (UGT75B1) exhibited a far higher kcat/Km value than the others and a far lower apparent Km for pABA (0.12 mm), suggesting its identity with the principal enzyme in vivo. Supporting this possibility, ablation of UGT75B1 reduced extractable pAGT activity by 95%, in vivo [14C]pABA glucosylation by 77%, and the endogenous pABA-Glc/pABA ratio by 9-fold. The Keq for the pABA esterification reaction was found to be 3 Ã 10-3. Taken with literature data on the cytosolic location of pAGT activity and on cytosolic UDP-glucose/UDP ratios, this Keq value allowed estimation that only 4% of cytosolic pABA is esterified. That pABA-Glc predominates in planta therefore implies that it is sequestered away from the cytosol and, consistent with this possibility, vacuoles isolated from [14C]pABA-fed pea leaves were estimated to containâ¥88% of the [14C]pABA-Glc formed. In total, these data and the fact that isolated mitochondria did not take up [3H]pABA-Glc, suggest that the glucose ester represents a storage form of pABA that does not contribute directly to folate synthesis.

From the complete genome, major genes responsible for the catabolism of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate in strain PBC are clustered in two distinct genomic regions. Although the catabolic genes for 4-sulfocatechol, the deaminated product of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate, are only found in H. intermedia , the sad operon responsible for the first deamination step of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate is conserved in various Hydrogenophaga strains. The absence of pabB gene in the complete genome of H. intermedia PBC is consistent with its p -aminobenzoic acid (pABA) auxotrophy but surprisingly comparative genomics analysis of 14 Hydrogenophaga genomes indicate that pABA auxotrophy is not an uncommon feature among members of this genus. Of even more interest, several Hydrogenophaga strains do not possess the genomic potential for hydrogen oxidation, calling for a revision to the taxonomic description of Hydrogenophaga as \"hydrogen eating bacteria.\"\n\nMolecular complex of lumiflavin and 2-aminobenzoic acid: crystal structure, crystal spectra, and solution properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nShieh, H S; Ghisla, S; Hanson, L K; Ludwig, M L; Nordman, C E\n\n1981-08-04\n\nThe molecular complex lumiflavin-2-aminobenzoic acid monohydrate (C13H12N4O2.C7H7NO2.H2O) crystallizes from from aqueous solution as red triclinic prisms. The space group is P1 with cell dimensions a = 9.660 A, b = 14.866 A, c = 7.045 A, alpha = 95.44 degrees , beta = 95.86 degrees, and gamma = 105.66 degrees . The crystal structure was solved by direct methods and refined by block-diagonal least-squares procedures to an R value of 0.050 on the basis of 1338 observed reflections. The structure is composed of stacks of alternating lumiflavin adn un-ionized (neutral) 2-aminobenzoic acid molecules. Two different modes of stacking interaction are observed. In one, 2-aminobenzoic acid overlaps all three of the isoalloxazine rings, at a mean distance of 3.36 A; in the other, 2-aminobenzoic acid interacts distance of 3.36 A; in the other, 2-aminobenzoic acid interacts with the pyrazine and dimethylbenzene moieties, at a distance of 3.42 A. Perpendicular to the stacking direction, the molecules form a continuous sheet. Each flavin is hydrogen bonded via O(2) and NH(3) to two symmetrically related aminobenzoates; the water of crystallization forms three hydrogen bonds, bridging two flavins, via O(4) and N(5), and one aminobenzoic acid. The red color of the crystals results from a charge-transfer transition involving stacked flavin and 2-aminobenzoic acid. The red color of the crystals results from a charge-transfer transition involving stacked flavin and 2-aminobenzoic acid molecules. Measurements of the polarized optical absorption spectra of crystals show that the transition moment direction for the long wavelength absorbance (beyond 530 nm) contains an out-of-plane component which can only arise from a charge-transfer interaction. Since the amino N does not make exceptionally close interactions with isoalloxazine atoms in either stacking mode (minimum interatomic distance 3.52 A), the charge transfer is presumed to involve pi orbitals of the 2-aminobenzoic acid donor.\n\nNovel Chemical and Optical Diagnostic Techniques\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-03-01\n\nhydroxy-4- methoxybenzophenone ( oxybenzone ), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), naphthoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4- naphthoquinone (HINQ), hydroquinone, 2,6-di...Additive Pre-UV Sunlight Post UV Color Color Exposure Time (s) 3 oxybenzone white 1.3 yellow I PABA yellow 2 1 yellow 2.5-3 3 hydroquinone white 1 gold\n\nEvaluation of a Simple in-House Test to Presumptively Differentiate Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex from Nontuberculous Mycobacteria by Detection of p-Nitrobenzoic Acid Metabolites\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Guirong; Yu, Xia; Liang, Qian; Chen, Suting; Wilson, Stuart; Huang, Hairong\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe timely differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and non-tubercular mycobacterium (NTM) species is urgently needed in patient care since the routine laboratory method is time consuming and cumbersome. An easy and cheap method which can successfully distinguish MTC from NTM was established and evaluated. 38 mycobacterial type and reference strains and 65 clinical isolates representing 10 species of mycobacterium were included in this study. Metabolites of p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB) reduction were identified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). A spectrophotometric method was developed to detect these metabolites, which was evaluated on a number of MTC and NTM species. All of the tested NTM species and strains reduced PNB to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), while none of the MTC strains showed a similar activity. Spectrophotometric detection of PABA had 100% sensitivity and specificity for MTC and NTM differentiation among the type strains and the clinical isolates tested. PABA was identified as one of the metabolites of PNB reduction. All the tested NTM species metabolized PNB to PABA whereas the MTC members lacked this activity. A simple, specific and cost-effective method based on PABA production was established in order to discriminate MTC from NTM from cultured organisms.

There are two alternate conventions which are employed to eliminate this term. The first assumes that the term involving delta Cp, or delta Cp itself, is zero. The alternate assumption assigns the value of the entropy of fusion to the differential heat capacity. The relative validity of these two assumptions was evaluated using the straight-chain alkyl para-aminobenzoates as test compounds. The heat capacities of the solid and liquid forms of each of the para-aminobenzoates, near the respective melting point, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The data lead one to conclude that the assumption that the differential heat capacity is not usually negligible and is better approximated by the entropy of fusion.\n\nNovel Isoniazid cocrystals with aromatic carboxylic acids: Crystal engineering, spectroscopy and thermochemical investigations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDiniz, Luan F.; Souza, Matheus S.; Carvalho, Paulo S.; da Silva, Cecilia C. P.; D'Vries, Richard F.; Ellena, Javier\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFour novel cocrystals of the anti-tuberculosis drug Isoniazid (INH), including two polymorphs, with the aromatic carboxylic acids p-nitrobenzoic (PNBA), p-cyanobenzoic (PCNBA) and p-aminobenzoic (PABA) were rationally designed and synthesized by solvent evaporation. Aiming to explore the possible supramolecular synthons of this API, these cocrystals were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), spectroscopic (FT-IR) and thermal (TGA, DSC, HSM) techniques. The cocrystal formation was found to be mainly driven by the synthons formed by the pyridine and hydrazide moieties. In both INH-PABA polymorphs, the COOH acid groups are H-bonded to pyridine and hydrazide groups giving rise to the acid&ctdot;pyridine and acid&ctdot;hydrazide heterosynthons. In INH-PNBA and INH-PCNBA cocrystals these acid groups are only related to the pyridine moiety. In addition to the structural study, supramolecular and Hirshfeld surface analysis were also performed based on the structural data. The cocrystals were identified from the FT-IR spectra and their thermal behaviors were studied by a combination of DSC, TGA and HSM techniques.\n\nSulfonamide Resistance of Propionibacteria: Nutrition and Transporta\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReddy, M. S.; Williams, F. D.; Reinbold, G. W.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThree variations of a synthetic growth medium were used to study the folic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) requirements of Propionibacterium. P. shermanii, P. freudenreichii, P. thoenii, and P. arabinosum synthesize folic acid and do not require PABA or folic acid. P. pentosaceum, P. jensenii, and P. rubrum are stimulated by folic acid or PABA, but do not show an absolute requirement. P. peterssonii shows a requirement for either PABA or folic acid. The addition of 300 Î¼g of sulfadiazine per ml did not inhibit growth of propionibacteria in the synthetic medium, synthetic medium plus PABA, or synthetic medium plus folic acid. P. freudenreichii was not inhibited even when 500 Î¼g of sulfadiazine per ml was added to the synthetic medium, nor did it degrade sulfadiazine significantly. Trimethoprim totally inhibited the growth of Propionibacterium. Radioactive sulfadiazine was transported by sulfadiazine-sensitive Escherichia coli but not by P. freudenreichii, indicating that the sulfadiazine resistance of propionibacteria could be mainly due to their inability to transport sulfonamides.

However, the constituent molecules of the polymorph that crystallizes from aqueous solutions are zwitterionic. This study reports atomistic simulations of the events surrounding the early stage of crystal nucleation of meta-aminobenzoic acid from aqueous solutions. Ab initio molecular dynamics was used to simulate the hydration of mABAÂ± and mABA and to quantify the interaction of these molecules with the surrounding water molecules. Density functional theory calculations were conducted to determine the low-lying energy conformers of meta-aminobenzoic acid dimers and to compute the Gibbs free energies in water of nonionic, (mABA)2, zwitterionic, (mABAÂ±)2, and nonionic-zwitterionic, (mABA)(mABAÂ±), species. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of mixed mABAâmABAÂ± aqueous solutions were carried out to examine the aggregation of meta-aminobenzoic acid. According to these simulations, the selective crystallization of the polymorphs whose constituent molecules are zwitterionic is driven by the formation of zwitterionic dimers in solution, which are thermodynamically more stable than (mABA)2 and (mABA)(mABAÂ±) pairs. This work represents a paradigm of the role of molecular processes during the early stages of crystal nucleation in affecting polymorph selection during crystallization from solution.

To gain insights into the genetic basis for the syntrophic interaction between this symbiotic pair and also another recently reported Hydrogenophaga associated co-culture, Hydrogenophaga sp. PBC and Ralstonia sp. PBA, we performed detailed genetic analysis of these four strains focusing on the metabolic pathways associated with biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and protocatechuate metabolism. Both assembled Hydrogenophaga draft genomes are missing a majority of the genetic components associated in the biosynthetic pathway of pABA and biotin. Interestingly, a fused pABA synthase was found in R. sp PBA but not in A. radiobacter S2. Furthermore, using whole genome data, the taxonomic classification of R. sp. PBA and A. radiobacter S2 (both previously inferred from 16S rRNA gene) was re-investigated, providing new evidence to propose for their re-classification at the genus and species level, respectively PMID:28775791\n\nAnaerobic degradation of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) via benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA in a denitrifying bacterium.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLochmeyer, C; Koch, J; Fuchs, G\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe enzymes catalyzing the initial reactions in the anaerobic degradation of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) were studied with a denitrifying Pseudomonas sp. anaerobically grown with 2-aminobenzoate and nitrate as the sole carbon and energy sources. Cells grown on 2-aminobenzoate are simultaneously adapted to growth with benzoate, whereas cells grown on benzoate degrade 2-aminobenzoate several times less efficiently than benzoate. Evidence for a new reductive pathway of aromatic metabolism and for four enzymes catalyzing the initial steps is presented. The organism contains 2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. 2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant [Ti(III)]. The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7. The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only. Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions. Two of them were identified preliminarily. One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA. The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, benzoyl-CoA reductase (aromatic ring reducing) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase. The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein). In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive. This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.

The recent pilot-scale production of PTM from S. platensis SB12026 has set the stage for the facile semi-synthesis of a focused library of PTM analogues. In this study, gram-quantity of platensic acid (PTMA) was prepared by the sulfuric acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of PTM, followed by a mild hydrolysis in aqueous lithium hydroxide. Three PTMA esters were also obtained in near quantitative yields in a single step, suggesting a facile route to make PTMA aliphatic esters. 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU)-catalyzed coupling of PTMA and 33 aminobenzoates resulted in the synthesis of 28 substituted aminobenzoate analogues of PTM, among which 26 of them were reported for the first time. Several of the PTM analogues showed weak antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The main lipid classes in this lipid matrix are ceramides (CERs), cholesterol (CHOL) and free fatty acids (FFAs). The aim of this study was to determine whether a variation in CER subclass composition and chain length distribution of FFAs affect the permeability of this matrix. To examine this, we make use of lipid model membranes, referred to as stratum corneum substitute (SCS). We prepared SCS containing i) single CER subclass with either a single FFA or a mixture of FFAs and CHOL, or ii) a mixture of various CER subclasses with either a single FFA or a mixture of FFAs and CHOL. In vitro permeation studies were performed using ethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (E-PABA) as a model drug. The flux of E-PABA across the SCS containing the mixture of FFAs was higher than that across the SCS containing a single FA with a chain length of 24 C atoms (FA C24), while the E-PABA flux was not effected by the CER composition. To select the underlying factors for the changes in permeability, the SCSs were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). All lipid models demonstrated a similar phase behavior. However, when focusing on the conformational ordering of the individual FFA chains, the shorter chain FFA (with a chain length of 16, 18 or 20 C atoms forming only 11m/m% of the total FFA level) had a higher conformational disordering, while the conformational ordering of the chains of the CER and FA C24 and FA C22 hardly did not change irrespective of the composition of the SCS. In conclusion, the conformational mobility of the short chain FFAs present only at low levels in the model SC lipid membranes has a great impact on the permeability of E-PABA.

Next to artificial fluorescent substrates, more physiological chito-oligomers are commonly used in chitinase assays. Analysis of chito-oligosaccharides products is generally accomplished by UV detection. However, the relatively poor sensitivity poses a serious limitation. Here we report on a novel, much more sensitive assay for the detection of chito-oligosaccharide reaction products released by chitinases, based on fluorescent detection, following chemical labeling by 2-aminobenzoic acid. Comparison with existing UV-based assays, shows that the novel assay offers the same advantages yet allows detection of chito-oligosaccharides in the low picomolar range.\n\nMagnetic whiskers of p-aminobenzoic acid and their use for preparation of filled and microchannel silicone rubbers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSemenov, V.

Alternatively, the second derivatives of the spectra can be recorded; the peak-to-peak height between the first maximum (330 nm) and the first minimum (317 nm) was shown to be proportional to the cyanate content. This method is suitable for the estimation of cyanate in aqueous solutions in the concentration range 0.01 to 2 mM. When added to blood plasma, cyanate could be detected down to 0.1 mM.\n\nCoq6 Is Responsible for the C4-deamination Reaction in Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOzeir, Mohammad; Pelosi, Ludovic; Ismail, Alexandre; Mellot-Draznieks, Caroline; Fontecave, Marc; Pierrel, Fabien\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to use para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in addition to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as a precursor of coenzyme Q, a redox lipid essential to the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q from pABA requires a deamination reaction at position C4 of the benzene ring to substitute the amino group with an hydroxyl group. We show here that the FAD-dependent monooxygenase Coq6, which is known to hydroxylate position C5, also deaminates position C4 in a reaction implicating molecular oxygen, as demonstrated with labeling experiments. We identify mutations in Coq6 that abrogate the C4-deamination activity, whereas preserving the C5-hydroxylation activity. Several results support that the deletion of Coq9 impacts Coq6, thus explaining the C4-deamination defect observed in Îcoq9 cells. The vast majority of flavin monooxygenases catalyze hydroxylation reactions on a single position of their substrate. Coq6 is thus a rare example of a flavin monooxygenase that is able to act on two different carbon atoms of its C4-aminated substrate, allowing its deamination and ultimately its conversion into coenzyme Q by the other proteins constituting the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway.

The cocrystals exhibit faster dissolution rates and higher pharmacokinetic properties compared to the reference drug, and surprisingly the cocrystal alloy NTZ-PABAâ:âNTZ-PASA (0.75â:â0.25) exhibited 4 fold higher bioavailability of NTZ in Sprague Dawley rats. This study opens the opportunity for cocrystal alloys as improved medicines.\n\nEffects of in vivo exposure to UV filters (4-MBC, OMC, BP-3, 4-HB, OC, OD-PABA) on endocrine signaling genes in the insect Chironomus riparius.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzÃ¡ez, Irene; MartÃ­nez-Guitarte, JosÃ© Luis; Morcillo, Gloria\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThere is increasing evidence indicating that several UV filters might have endocrine disruptive effects. Numerous studies have evaluated hormonal effects in vertebrates, mainly reporting estrogenic and androgenic activities in mammals and fishes. There is only limited knowledge about potential endocrine activity in invertebrate hormonal systems. In this work, the effects on endocrine signaling genes of six frequently used UV filters were investigated in Chironomus riparius, a reference organism in aquatic toxicology. The UV filters studied were: octyl-p-methoxycinnamate (OMC) also called 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC); 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC); benzophenone-3 (BP-3); 4-hidroxybenzophenone (4-HB); octocrylene (OC); and octyldimethyl-p-aminobenzoate (OD-PABA). After in vivo exposure at different dosages, expression levels of the genes coding for the ecdysone receptor (EcR), the ultraspiracle (usp, ortholog of the RXR) and the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) were quantified by Real Time PCR. The EcR gene was significantly upregulated by 4-MBC, OMC/EHMC and OD-PABA, with a dose-related response following 24h exposure. In contrast, the benzophenones, BP-3 and 4-HB, as well as OC did not alter this gene at the same exposure conditions. The transcription profiles of the usp and ERR genes were not significantly affected, except for BP-3 that inhibited the usp gene at the highest concentration. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence in invertebrates of a direct effect of UV filters on endocrine-related genes, and is consistent with the known effects on vertebrate hormonal receptor genes. The capability of 4-MBC, OMC/EHMC and OD-PABA to stimulate the expression of the ecdysone receptor, a key transcription factor for the ecdysone-genomic response in arthropods, suggests the possibility of a broad and long-term effect on this hormonal pathway. These findings strengthen the need for further research about the ecotoxicological implications\n\nOverexpression of folate biosynthesis genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and evaluation of their impact on seed folate content.\n\nPubMed\n\nDong, Wei; Cheng, Zhi-jun; Lei, Cai-lin; Wang, Xiao-le; Wang, Jiu-lin; Wang, Jie; Wu, Fu-qing; Zhang, Xin; Guo, Xiu-ping; Zhai, Hu-qu; Wan, Jian-min\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFolate (vitamin B9) deficiency is a global health problem especially in developing countries where the major staple foods such as rice contain extremely low folates. Biofortification of rice could be an alternative complement way to fight folate deficiency. In this study, we evaluated the availability of the genes in each step of folate biosynthesis pathway for rice folate enhancement in the japonica variety kitaake genetic background. The first enzymes GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) and aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) in the pterin and para-aminobenzoate branches resulted in significant increase in seed folate content, respectively (Pâ<â0.01). Overexpression of two closely related enzymes dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS) and folypolyglutamate synthase (FPGS), which perform the first and further additions of glutamates, produced slightly increase in seed folate content separately. The GTPCHI transgene was combined with each of the other transgenes except ADCS to investigate the effects of gene stacking on seed folate accumulation. Seed folate contents in the gene-stacked plants were higher than the individual low-folate transgenic parents, but lower than the high-folate GTPCHI transgenic lines, pointing to an inadequate supply of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) precursor initiated by ADCS in constraining folate overproduction in gene-stacked plants.\n\nSeparation of 2-aminobenzoic acid-derivatized glycosaminoglycans and asparagine-linked glycans by capillary electrophoresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Kae; Sato, Kiichi; Okubo, Akira; Yamazaki, Sunao\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA capillary electrophoresis method was developed for the analysis of oligosaccharides combined with derivatization with 2-aminobenzoic acid. Glycosaminoglycan delta-disaccharides were effectively resolved on a fused-silica capillary tube using 150 mM borate, pH 8.5, as a running electrolyte solution. This analytical method was applied to the identification of glycosaminoglycan in combination with enzymatic digestion. The separation of N-glycans or glucose-oligomers was performed with a phosphate buffer containing polyethylene glycol or borate as an electrolyte solution. This method is expected to be useful in the determination of oligosaccharide structures in a glycoprotein.\n\nHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography of anthranilic acid-labelled oligosaccharides with a 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester-labelled dextran hydrolysate internal standard.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeville, David C A; Alonzi, Dominic S; Butters, Terry D\n\n2012-04-13\n\nHydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) of fluorescently labelled oligosaccharides is used in many laboratories to analyse complex oligosaccharide mixtures. Separations are routinely performed using a TSK gel-Amide 80 HPLC column, and retention times of different oligosaccharide species are converted to glucose unit (GU) values that are determined with reference to an external standard. However, if retention times were to be compared with an internal standard, consistent and more accurate GU values would be obtained. We present a method to perform internal standard-calibrated HILIC of fluorescently labelled oligosaccharides. The method relies on co-injection of 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (4-ABEE)-labelled internal standard and detection by UV absorption, with 2-AA (2-aminobenzoic acid)-labelled oligosaccharides. 4-ABEE is a UV chromophore and a fluorophore, but there is no overlap of the fluorescent spectrum of 4-ABEE with the commonly used fluorescent reagents. The dual nature of 4-ABEE allows for accurate calculation of the delay between UV and fluorescent signals when determining the GU values of individual oligosaccharides. The GU values obtained are inherently more accurate as slight differences in gradients that can influence retention are negated by use of an internal standard. Therefore, this paper provides the first method for determination of HPLC-derived GU values of fluorescently labelled oligosaccharides using an internal calibrant. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Analytes such as peptides or proteins may undergo ISD and this method can therefore be exploited for top-down sequencing. When performed on peptides, radical-induced ISD results in production of c- and z-ions, as also found in ETD and ECD activation. Here, we describe two new compounds which, when used as MALDI matrices, are able to efficiently induce ISD of peptides and proteins: 2-aminobenzamide and 2-aminobenzoic acid. In-source reduction of the disulfide bridge containing peptide Calcitonin further confirmed the radicalar mechanism of the ISD process. ISD of peptides led, in addition to c- and z-ions, to the generation of a-, x-, and y-ions both in positive and in negative ion modes.

PABA/NO has proven active in several cancer models in vitro and in vivo, but its tendency to be metabolized via a variety of pathways, some that generate inactive metabolites and hydrolysis products, limits its potential as a drug. Here we show that a simple replacement of cyano for nitro at the 4 position to give compound 4b ('p-cyano-PABA/NO') has the dual effect of slowing the undesired side reactions while enhancing the proportion of NO release and arylating activity on catalysis by GSTP1. Compound 4b showed increased resistance to hydrolysis and uncatalyzed reaction with GSH, along with a more favorable product distribution in the presence of GSTP1. It also showed significant proapoptotic activity. The data suggest p-cyano-PABA/NO to be a more promising prodrug than PABA/NO, with better selectivity toward cancer cells.

Neurological involvement is frequently observed in CoQ(10) deficiency, typically presenting as cerebellar ataxia and/or seizures. The aetiology of the neurological presentation of CoQ(10) deficiency has yet to be fully elucidated and therefore in order to investigate these phenomena we have established a neuronal cell model of CoQ(10) deficiency by treatment of neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is a competitive inhibitor of the CoQ(10) biosynthetic pathway enzyme, COQ2. PABA treatment (1 mM) resulted in a 54 % decrease (46 % residual CoQ(10)) decrease in neuronal CoQ(10) status (p < 0.01). Reduction of neuronal CoQ(10) status was accompanied by a progressive decrease in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities, with a 67.5 % decrease in cellular ATP production at 46 % residual CoQ(10). Mitochondrial oxidative stress increased four-fold at 77 % and 46 % residual CoQ(10). A 40 % increase in mitochondrial membrane potential was detected at 46 % residual CoQ(10) with depolarisation following oligomycin treatment suggesting a reversal of complex V activity. This neuronal cell model provides insights into the effects of CoQ(10) deficiency on neuronal mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, and will be an important tool to evaluate candidate therapies for neurological conditions associated with CoQ(10) deficiency.\n\nChemical Speciation and Bond Lengths of Organic Solutes by Core-Level Spectroscopy: pH and Solvent Influence on p-Aminobenzoic Acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevens, Joanna S; Gainar, Adrian; Suljoti, Edlira; Xiao, Jie; Golnak, Ronny; Aziz, Emad F; Schroeder, Sven L M\n\n2015-05-04\n\nThrough X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies, the chemical, electronic and structural properties of organic species in solution can be observed.

Nucleotide sequences of the pabA genes from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaplan, J B; Merkel, W K; Nichols, B P\n\n1985-06-05\n\nThe amide group of glutamine is a source of nitrogen in the biosynthesis of a variety of compounds. These reactions are catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as glutamine amidotransferases; two of these, the glutamine amidotransferase subunits of p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase have been studied in detail and have been shown to be structurally and functionally related. In some micro-organisms, p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase share a common glutamine amidotransferase subunit. We report here the primary DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the p-aminobenzoate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens. A comparison of these glutamine amidotransferase sequences to the sequences of ten others, including some that function specifically in either the p-aminobenzoate synthase or anthranilate synthase complexes and some that are shared by both synthase complexes, has revealed several interesting features of the structure and organization of these genes, and has allowed us to speculate as to the evolutionary history of this family of enzymes. We propose a model for the evolution of the p-aminobenzoate synthase and anthranilate synthase glutamine amidotransferase subunits in which the duplication and subsequent divergence of the genetic information encoding a shared glutamine amidotransferase subunit led to the evolution of two new pathway-specific enzymes.\n\nReversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of unsubstituted aminobenzoic acids\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAbidi, S.L.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nHigh-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) characteristics of three position isomers of aminobenzoic acids (potential metabolites of important anesthetic drugs), were delineated with respect to their interactions with various mobile phases and stationary phases. HPLC with five hydrocarbonaceous phase, I?-cyclodextrin silica (CDS), macrophase MP-1 polymer (MP), macroporous polystyrene/divinylbenzene (MPD), octadecylsilica (ODS), and propylphenylsilica (PPS), yielded results explicable in terms of substituent effects derived from the bifunctional amino- and carboxy groups. For cases where mobile phases contained sulfonates or quaternary ammonium salts both having longer chain alkyls, retention of analytes on all but CDS appeared to proceed predominantly via an ion-pairing mechanism. The extent of the corresponding counter-ion effects decreased in the order: MPD > ODS > PPS > MP, while the analyte retention order paralleled thier pH2 values. On the other hand, an inverse relationship between the magnitude of capacity factors (k') and pK1 values of the title compounds was observed in experiments that produced retention data incompatible with ion-pair interaction rationales. The unique HPLC results obtained with the CDS phase are compared with those obtained with other phases.\n\nVitamin Requirements of Several Cellulolytic Rumen Bacteria1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nScott, H. W.; Dehority, B. A.\n\n1965-01-01\n\nScott, H. W. (Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station, Wooster), and B. A. Dehority. Vitamin requirements of several cellulolytic rumen bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 89:1169â1175. 1965.âFour strains of cellulolytic bacteria recently isolated from in vitro rumen fermentations were used in this study. Nine water-soluble vitamins were tested in single-deletion and single-addition plus biotin experiments, each with and without charcoal-extracted casein hydrolysate. Bacteroides succinogenes A3C and B21a required only biotin under the above experimental conditions. Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b showed an absolute requirement for biotin and was stimulated by p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the single-deletion experiments. In the single-addition plus biotin experiments, PABA and, to a lesser extent, vitamin B12 appeared to be required for maximal growth. The presence or absence of casein hydrolysate did not affect the vitamin requirements for the aforementioned three strains. In the single-deletion experiments, R. flavefaciens Cla showed an absolute requirement for biotin and, when casein hydrolysate was omitted, for B12. When casein hydrolysate was present, no requirement for B12 could be observed. In the single-addition experiments where the basal medium contained biotin and casein hydrolysate or B12, PABA was required for maximal growth; however, the single deletion of PABA caused only slight retardation of growth. Investigation of the B12 or casein hydrolysate requirement of Cla revealed that a mixture of purified amino acids simulating casein hydrolysate satisfied this requirement. Subsequent work indicated that this requirement could be satisfied by the amino acid methionine.

Fragmentation of both types of ions gave prominent singly charged glycosidic cleavage ions containing the derivatised reducing terminus and ions from the non-reducing terminus that appeared to be products of cross-ring cleavages. Differentiation of these two groups of ions was conveniently achieved in a single spectrum by use of chloro- or bromo-substituted benzoic acids in order to label ions containing the derivative with an atom with a distinctive isotope pattern. Fragmentation of the doubly charged ions gave more abundant fragments, both singly and doubly charged, than did fragmentation of the singly charged ions, but information of chain branching was masked by the appearance of prominent ions produced by internal cleavages.

The vibrational (FT-IR, FT-Raman) and NMR ( 1H and 13C) spectra for 2-aminobenzoic acid and its alkali metal salts were recorded. The assignment of vibrational spectra was done on the basis of literature data, theoretical calculations and our previous experience. Characteristic shifts of bands and changes in intensities of bands along the metal series were observed. The changes of chemical shifts of protons ( 1H NMR) and carbons ( 13C NMR) in the series of studied alkali metal 2-aminobenzoates were observed too. Optimized geometrical structures of studied compounds were calculated by B3LYP method using 6-311++G ââ basis set. Geometric aromaticity indices, dipole moments and energies were also calculated. The theoretical wavenumbers and intensities of IR and Raman spectra were obtained. The calculated parameters were compared to experimental characteristic of studied compounds.\n\nCharacterization of carbohydrates using highly fluorescent 2-aminobenzoic acid tag following gel electrophoresis of glycoproteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnumula, K R; Du, P\n\n1999-11-15\n\nApplication of the most sensitive fluorescent label 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid, AA) for characterization of carbohydrates from the glycoproteins ( approximately 15 pmol) separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is described. AA label is used for the determination of both monosaccharide composition and oligosaccharide map. For the monosaccharide determination, bands containing the glycoprotein of interest are excised from the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane blots, hydrolyzed in 20% trifluoroacetic acid, derivatized, and analyzed by C-18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. For the oligosaccharide mapping, bands were digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) in order to release the N-linked oligosaccharides, derivatized, and analyzed by normal-phase anion-exchange chromatography. For convenience, the PNGase F digestion was performed in 1:100 diluted ammonium hydroxide overnight. The oligosaccharide yield from ammonium hydroxide-PNGase F digestion was better or equal to all the other reported procedures, and the presumed \"oligosaccharide-amine\" product formed in the reaction mixture did not interfere with labeling of the oligosaccharides under the conditions used for derivatization. Sequencing of oligosaccharides can be performed using the same mapping method following treatment with an array of glycosidases. In addition, the mapping method is useful for determining the relative and simultaneous distribution of sialic acid and fucose.

Obviously it is great to introduce predictable structural motifs to an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) by design. One widely used approach to cocrystal design is based on the consideration of Îp Ka, which can represent the propensity of molecular species to form a cocrystal or a salt. In this work, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was mixed with sulfamerazine (SMZ) or sulfamethazine (STH) by use of neat cogrinding and solvent-drop cogrinding. It was found that PABA and SMZ with a Îp Ka of 2.13 would form a binary eutectic, while PABA and STH with a larger Îp Ka of 2.59 can form a cocrystal in the ratio of 1:1. The phenomenon indicates that not only the Îp Ka but also the stereo-hindrance effect (geometric fit) should be considered during the design of pharmaceutical cocrystals.\n\nCollision-induced fragmentation of negative ions from N-linked glycans derivatized with 2-aminobenzoic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarvey, David J\n\n2005-05-01\n\nN-Linked glycans from bovine ribonuclease B, chicken ovalbumin, bovine fetuin, porcine thyroglobulin and human alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were derivatized with 2-aminobenzoic acid by reductive amination and their tandem mass spectra were recorded by negative ion electrospray ionization with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Derivatives were also prepared from 2-amino-5-methyl- and 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid in order to confirm the identity of fragment ions containing the reducing terminus. Major fragments from the [M - H](-) ions from the neutral glycans retained the derivative (Y-type cleavages) and provided information on sequence and branching. Other major fragments were products of A-type cross-ring cleavages giving information on antenna structure. Singly doubly and triply charged ions were formed from sialylated glycans. They produced major fragments by loss of sialic acid and a series of singly charged ions that were similar to those from the neutral analogues. Doubly charge ions were also produced by the neutral glycans and were fragmented to form product ions with one and two charges. Again, the fragment ions with a single charge were similar to those from the singly charged parents, but branching information was less obvious because of the occurrence of more abundant ions produced by multiple cleavages. Detection limits were around 200 fmol (3 : 1 signal-to-noise ratio).

Direct photolysis is shown to play a key role in phototransformation, and this fast process is expected to be the main attenuation route of OD-PABA in sunlit surface waters. The generation of transformation products (TPs) was followed via HPLC/HRMS. Five (or four) TPs were detected in the samples exposed to UVB (or UVA) radiation, respectively. The main detected TPs of OD-PABA, at least as far as HPLC-HRMS peak areas are concerned, would involve a dealkylation or hydroxylation/oxidation process in both direct photolysis and indirect phototransformation. The latter was simulated by using TiO2-based heterogeneous photocatalysis, involving the formation of nine additional TPs. Most of them resulted from the further degradation of the primary TPs that can also be formed by direct photolysis. Therefore, these secondary TPs might also occur as later transformation intermediates in natural aquatic systems. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional glycan screening involves chromatographic or electrophoretic separation-based methods, and, although reproducible, these methods can be time-consuming. Even ultrahigh-performance chromatographic and microfluidic integrated LC/MS systems, which work on the tens of minute time scale, become lengthy when hundreds of samples are to be analyzed. Comparatively, a direct infusion mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycan screening method acquires data on a millisecond time scale, exhibits exquisite sensitivity and reproducibility, and is amenable to automated peak annotation. In addition, characterization of glycan species via sequential mass spectrometry can be performed simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative high-throughput MS-based mapping approach using stable isotope 2-aminobenzoic acid (2-AA) for rapid \"high-level\" glycan screening.\n\n[Analysis of monosaccharides and uronic acids in polysaccharides by pre-column derivatization with p-aminobenzoic acid and high performance liquid chromatography].\n\nPubMed\n\nHao, Guitang; Chen, Shangwei; Zhu, Song; Yin, Hongping; Dai, Jun; Cao, Yuhua\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAn ion-pair reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous determination of carbohydrate and uronic acids was developed. p-Aminobenzoic acid (p-AMBA) was used for pre-column derivatization of the analytes, enabling fluorescence (lambda(ex) = 313 nm, lambda(em) = 358 nm) or ultraviolet (UV at 303 nm) detection. Reaction conditions such as reaction temperature and reaction time were optimized. Atlantis dC18 column with hydrophilic end capping was selected for the separation of derivatives. Effects of mobile phase compositions such as ion pairs and their concentrations and pH on the retention behaviors and separation results of 9 monosaccharides and 2 uronic acids were investigated. Derivatives of fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, ribose, galacturonic acid, fucose, glucuronic acid and rhamnose were separated within 42 min, applying tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen bisulfate (TBAHSO4) as the ion pair reagent. The detection limits were between 3.38 x 10(-8) mol/L and 176 x 10(-8) mol/L for fluorescence detection and between 2.55 x 10(-7) mol/L and 13.4 x 10(-7) mol/L for UV detection. Good linearities were obtained with correlation coefficients (r2) above 0.99. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the peak area of the derivatives in 12 - 51 h after derivatization were from 2.5% to 3.9%. This method has been applied for the determination of mono-/disaccharides and uronic acids in spirulina polysaccharide after dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid solution (2 mol/L). The results showed this method is suitable for the analysis of monosaccharide compositions in polysaccharides.\n\nContact urticaria, allergic contact dermatitis, and photoallergic contact dermatitis from oxybenzone.\n\nPubMed\n\nLanders, Maeran; Law, Sandra; Storrs, Frances J\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThere is little literature regarding conventional patch tests and photopatch tests to oxybenzone resulting in both immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. A patient was patch-tested and photopatch-tested to various sunscreen chemicals. Both immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions were observed with oxybenzone. The positive patch tests were also photoaccentuated. Oxybenzone, a common sunscreen allergen, can result in both contact urticaria and delayed-type hypersensitivity on both conventional patch testing and photopatch testing. Allergic contact dermatitis to sunscreen chemicals has traditionally included contact urticaria, allergic contact dermatitis, and photoallergic contact dermatitis. Due to the recognition of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and its esters as sensitizers, the presence of benzophenones in \"PABA-free\" sunscreens has become more prevalent, especially in sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) greater than 8. In our patient, immediate- and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions were seen to oxybenzone (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, 2-benzoyl-5-methoxyphenol, benzophenone-3, Eusolex 4360, Escalol 567, EUSORB 228, Spectra-Sorb UV-9, Uvinul M-40) upon conventional patch testing and photopatch testing.\n\nPortable electrochemical sensor based on 4-aminobenzoic acid-functionalized herringbone carbon nanotubes for the determination of ascorbic acid and uric acid in human fluids.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbellÃ¡n-Llobregat, A; GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n, C; Vidal, L; Canals, A; MorallÃ³n, E\n\n2018-06-30\n\nA new portable electrochemical sensor based on 4-aminobenzoic acid-modified herringbone carbon nanotubes (hCNTs-4ABA/Au-IDA) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) in physiological fluids. AA and UA were quantified by chronoamperometry at 0.1 and 0.32â¯V, respectively, in phosphate buffer solution (PBS 0.25â¯M, pH 7.0). Significant results were obtained for the separate quantification of AA and UA, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.65â¯Î¼M for both analytes, and sensitivities of (9.0â¯Â±â¯0.4)â¯Aâ¯g -1 mM -1 and (8.8â¯Â±â¯0.3)â¯Aâ¯g -1 mM -1 for AA and UA, respectively. Repeatability was studied at 50â¯Î¼M for AA and UA, providing relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 9%. Additions of glucose, dopamine and epinephrine did not interfere with the AA and UA determination. Furthermore, UA did not interfere with AA determination at 0.1â¯V, although AA additions increased the current recorded at 0.32â¯V. The method has been successfully applied to human urine, perspiration and serum samples, without significant matrix effects, which allows for the use of an external calibration and the analysis of all the matrices investigated.

These compounds exhibit antimalarial, antimicrobial, anti-cancer and anti-viral activities, among other beneficial properties. On the other hand, treatment of bacterial infections remains a challenging therapeutic problem because of the emerging infectious diseases and the increasing number of multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens. As multidrug-resistant bacterial strains proliferate, the necessity for effective therapy has stimulated research into the design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial molecules. 1,3,5-Triazine 4-aminobenzoic acid derivatives were prepared by conventional method or by using microwave irradiation. Using microwave irradiation gave the desired products in less time, good yield and higher purity. Esterification of the 4-aminobenzoic acid moiety afforded methyl ester analogues. The s-triazine derivatives and their methyl ester analogues were fully characterized by FT-IR, NMR ( 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR), mass spectra and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Some tested compounds showed promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Three series of mono-, di- and trisubstituted s-triazine derivatives and their methyl ester analogues were synthesized and fully characterized. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Compounds (10), (16), (25) and (30) have antimicrobial activity against S. aureus comparable to that of ampicillin, while the activity of compound (13) is about 50% of that of ampicillin. Compounds (13) and (14) have antimicrobial activity against E. coli comparable to that of ampicillin, while the activity of compounds (9-12) and (15) is about 50% of that of ampicillin. Furthermore, minimum inhibitory concentrations values for clinical isolates of\n\nHuman COQ9 Rescues a coq9 Yeast Mutant by Enhancing Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis from 4-Hydroxybenzoic Acid and Stabilizing the CoQ-Synthome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHe, Cuiwen H.; Black, Dylan S.; Allan, Christopher M.; Meunier, Brigitte; Rahman, Shamima; Clarke, Catherine F.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCoq9 is required for the stability of a mitochondrial multi-subunit complex, termed the CoQ-synthome, and the deamination step of Q intermediates that derive from para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) in yeast. In human, mutations in the COQ9 gene cause neonatal-onset primary Q10 deficiency. In this study, we determined whether expression of human COQ9 could complement yeast coq9 point or null mutants. We found that expression of human COQ9 rescues the growth of the temperature-sensitive yeast mutant, coq9-ts19, on a non-fermentable carbon source and increases the content of Q6, by enhancing Q biosynthesis from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB). To study the mechanism for the rescue by human COQ9, we determined the steady-state levels of yeast Coq polypeptides in the mitochondria of the temperature-sensitive yeast coq9 mutant expressing human COQ9. We show that the expression of human COQ9 significantly increased steady-state levels of yeast Coq4, Coq6, Coq7, and Coq9 at permissive temperature. Human COQ9 polypeptide levels persisted at non-permissive temperature. A small amount of the human COQ9 co-purified with tagged Coq6, Coq6-CNAP, indicating that human COQ9 interacts with the yeast Q-biosynthetic complex. These finding"
