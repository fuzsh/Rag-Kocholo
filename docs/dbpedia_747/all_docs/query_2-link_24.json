        "text": "HELP. PLEASE SHARE THIS TO ASK LINKEDIN TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. üíØ It is ruining the platform! As most of you out there have confirmed, I am, we are, getting inundated with connection requests and messages with cold, AI-generated, useless pitches. trying to sort the out discerning if within the junk there is a serious message, then deleting or ignoring them is a huge waste of time. üíØ It is ruining the platform! and this is bad for all of us. it's the only social media really worth having and we cannot afford it to go rotten. LinkedIn, please, allow us to at least flag these profiles as unsolicited pitches and create a score so that once a profile reaches a certain number of flags they are banned.\n\nLast week was excellent for Italian tech! I met some interesting Italian founders and VCs at the launch event for the week-long visit of the #Italian_Delegation at the #Yale_Innovation_Summit in CT and NYC. Organized by AdvanceCT, Connecticut Innovations, the Italian Consolato d'Italia a New York, and the Italian Tech Alliance. Thank you, and congrats to John Pavia, Francesco Ricigliano, Francesco Cerruti, and Italian Consul Fabrizio Di Michele for making the whole week a success. Looking forward to future collaboration and success! The Italian ecosystem is still small and young. I have criticized policies that have hindered rather than helped its growth. However, it is now at an inflection point. Talent is tremendous and second to nowhere else, and policies have improved, thanks especially to CDP Venture Capital SGR (more strides are needed to reach critical mass). Being in a catch-up phase, it is poised to grow much faster than other EU ecosystems, presenting a great opportunity for investors, entrepreneurs, and institutions. The road ahead looks promising! I'd like to reiterate 3 points: 1) Policy makes a huge difference in the success of an innovation ecosystem and has little to do with the amount of money you put in. Subsidies: Bad. Government-run venture funds: Bad. 2) Italy should prioritize policies that build an ecosystem. While ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù is overused, it has deep meaning. Creating demand and talent pipelines for startups and leveraging procurement to source solutions is better than providing capital. Capital is useless without sales. 3) Italy is Europe‚Äôs last bastion with a Silicon Valley obsession. While SV is number one, the NY Metro Area (which includes a chunk of CT) is better for scaling globally. NY is the second-largest ecosystem in the world, with 30,000 startups valued at $650B, 146 unicorns, and $179B in VC invested from 2018-2023 (compared to London‚Äôs $99.8B). Many Euro growth-stage startups are headquartered in NYC: UK 407, France 146, Germany 94, Ireland 70. With a $1.7T economy, the NY Metro Area is home to the most Fortune 500 companies in the US: your clients are here. Geography and historical links matter. A LOT. Thanks again to everyone involved for making this happen. #Innovation #GlobalMarket #ItalianInnovation #AdvanceCT #CTInnovation #CrossPollination #StartupEcosystem #GlobalGrowth Simone Tarantino, Caroline Simmons, Fabio Pirovano, Jacopo Drudi, Luca Pignatti, Paul Marino, Andrea Gumina, Matteo Bogana, Lorenzo Seritti\n\nIt was a heartwarming experience to see the Smart Cities conference return to the vibrant streets of New York City despite having lost most of my voice! As my friend David Gilford aptly put it, it felt like a family reunion. I had the pleasure of reconnecting with long-time friends and esteemed colleagues from the NYC Office of the Mayor, #Partnership_for_NYC, New York City Economic Development Corporation, #NYC_Office_of_Technology_and_Innovation, #Smart_Cities_New_York and more. Special thanks and congratulations to Aarti Tandon and her team for delivering this! A Special mention to the great team at Smart City Expo World Congress (Ricard Zapatero, Pilar Conesa, Ugo Valenti, Cristina Garrido) My role in the event was diverse and engaging. I hosted and introduced the program on stage II, which featured several thought-provoking panels, including those on Modern PPPs and the Public Realm (with examples from NYC #Brooklyn_Navy_Yard_Development_Corporation and #Trust_for_Governors_Island, the first-ever NYC Chief Public Realm Officer and #LinkNYC), Public Sector AI, Modern Procurement, Emission Free Cities, and many more. I also enjoyed working alongside Robinson Hernandez in the #Startup_Central program and moderating a series of matchmaking conversations between startups and city leaders. This allowed me to learn about other cities and states, such as #Charlotte, #Boston, #Atlanta, and the state of #North_Carolina, which are also making great strides in the urban tech and smart city sectors, and about startups and incubators such as Guava, WeThrive, Jotto AI (although I am cheating here, because I know these guys very being one of my best clients/advisee ever!). I may have been a little too blunt, especially when I asked city leaders how they would plan to hire or start a partnership with the startups. But that was the purpose of the matchmaking, wasn't it??

Michael Short, Rachel S., Nick Colvin, Kody Kinsley #SmartCityExpoUSA #SmartCityExpoWolrdCongress #urbantech #infrastructure #startups #VentureCapital\n\nü•≥I‚Äôm excited about speaking at the first Smart City Expo USA in NYC this week, May 22-23rd. It will be hosted by Aarti Tandon and #Mayor_Eric_Adams, two people I admire and have worked with in the past in different capacities. You can find me at Stage II‚Äîwhere I will be hosting‚Äîand here and there at #StartupCentral and other ‚Äúlocations\" in the expo. üßçIn 2014, I was honored to represent NYC at Smart City Expo World Congress in #Barcelona with my then City Hall colleagues, Minerva Tantoco, Jeff Merritt, and Julie Stein, AICP. Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen was tied up at the last minute (it's always so tricky for NYC Mayors and Deputies to travel, and a lot of this has to do with a certain parochialism among constituents and press corps, but this is another story). That is where I met great people like Pilar Conesa, Luis Gomez, Cristina Garrido, Ugo Valenti, and the rest of the minds behind what today is undoubtedly the most important gathering on anything urban. Not to mention the elected officials, entrepreneurs, thought leaders worldwide, and even former Mayor Ada Colau, whom I greatly respect. üèôÔ∏èI fell hopelessly in love with the world of urban innovation, and it has been a highly enriching learning experience ever since and the birthplace of many beautiful friendships. I missed it only once! Jerry Hultin, Jeremy M. Goldberg, Dr Hila Oren, Jonathan Reichental, Ph.D., Nicola Villa, Robinson Hernandez, Johann Beelen, to name a few. \"Smart City‚Äù in the title may induce you to think of data, software, and IoT to run city services. Well, it's enormously more than that. It's about the 360¬∞ prosperity of urban areas. Aarti, a group of other colleagues, and I tried to get the city directly involved and support an event like this in the past with minimal success, so I cannot praise Mayor Adams enough for having stepped in and Aarti for her relentless advocacy. #SCEUSA is good for NYC. Yes, we all like to say it is the greatest city in the world, but it still needs to be adequately recognized as the world capital of urban innovation. SCEUSA promotes the city to the world, while it is a gigantic opportunity for leaders from everywhere to learn about each other, source new solutions from the private and public sectors, and for established companies, startups, and investors to do business with each other. If you are a startup founder, especially in climate tech, which is dearest to me, pitching to city leaders is a golden opportunity (cit. Donnel Baird.) Cities produce 80% of all emissions, so if we want to help our climate fight, they need to be SMART! DM me for discounted tickets! Register here: https://lnkd.in/eeCz9iTD.
