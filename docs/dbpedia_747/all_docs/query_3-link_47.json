        "text": "Correction to: Clinical and Experimental Medicine 10.1007/s10238-020-00679-4\n\nThe original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake. The correct information is given below.\n\nThe co-authorship of the members of ‘‘Internal Medicine Covid-19 Collaborators” was inadvertently not clearly indicated. The names of these members should have been clearly linked to the author line of the article, to ensure that the article can be found under each of their names in PubMed and other databases.\n\nIn order to rectify this situation, this erratum provides a corrected author line, found above, that includes the names of the members of ‘‘Internal Medicine Covid-19 Collaborators”.\n\nThe given name and family name of the second author was incorrectly tagged in the xml data, therefore it is abbreviated wrongly as ‘‘de Andreis FB’’. The correct given name is Federica and family name is Borrelli de Andreis.\n\nThe original article has been corrected."
