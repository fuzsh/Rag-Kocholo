        "text": "Thank you for joining us at the Community College of Baltimore County’s Risk Management and Insurance Career Day Fair! Here is some information to help you explore the many career options within the insurance industry.\n\nThe insurance industry offers outstanding job security and stability. Business Insurance found that according to the Bureau of Labor, “the median tenure in the insurance sector was 5.5 years. The industry’s average tenure is among the highest in both the private and public sector occupations.” The article also mentions that this strong retention rate may be due to higher job satisfaction, better benefits, and a better work/life balance.\n\nBelow, click on the appropriate tab for the date you’re attending to see the insurance companies scheduled to be in attendance and the career fields represented for each Career Fair date.\n\nInformation about the wide array of careers in the insurance industry can be found below."
