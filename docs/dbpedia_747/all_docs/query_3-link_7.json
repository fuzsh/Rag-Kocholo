Step inside their history and be immersed in an exhibit of revolutionary plans for their future in the Country House, City House exhibition.\n\nThe AIA Foundation (which operates The Octagon House) and The Menokin Foundation share a common mission: to encourage and educate the public and the architecture profession about the preservation of great design of the past, and the creation of great design for the future. That mission is made tangible through this collaborative exhibit.\n\nThe exhibit is comprised of three parts:\n\nExhibit Hours:\n\nSelf-guided tours:\n\nThursday – Saturday, 1-4pm\n\nAdmission: FREE\n\nPrivate guided tours are available during other times by appointment. Tours last approximately one hour, and are $10/adults and $5/students.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRuins, Memory, and The Imagination: Menokin Revealed\n\nAn Exhibition of the\n\nHarvard Graduate School of Design Projects\n\nat the Virginia Center for Architecture\n\nIn the spring of 2013, architecture professor Jorge Silvetti led twelve Harvard Graduate School of Design students through an exploration of the complex design and interpretive questions surrounding the c. 1769 Menokin site.\n\nDiscover the students’ innovative solutions for the evocative crumbling ruins and surrounding landscape at this 500-acre site in Virginia’s Northern Neck.\n\nThis exhibit will feature images of the final concept presentations of the students of the spring studio course. Curated by Jorge Silvetti, the show will feature graphics designed by Carmine D’Alessandro and custom exhibit panels designed and produced by Forrest French.\n\nVisitors will be introduced to the exhibition with an overview of The Menokin Project, putting the work of the students into context of the revolutionary thinking that Menokin inspires. It’s easy to understand that inspiration when reading the observations of the students during their time here…\n\nBios of the students and descriptions of the Design Program at Harvard in which they participate will also be highlighted.\n\nThe exhibit will run from January 30th until April 27th at the Virginia Center for Architecture in Richmond, VA.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Reveal\n\nI hope you have enjoyed seeing the progress of The Menokin Project model as it has evolved from a sketch to a finished piece of art.\n\nHarvard Graduate School of Design students Carmine D’Alessandro and Alex Jacobson, and Machado and Silvetti Project Manager Jayne Kang – under the supervision of lead architect, Jorge Silvetti – have delivered a masterpiece of model making that will undoubtedly help The Menokin Foundation take this project to the next level.\n\nWe would like to once again express our boundless appreciation to Union First Market Bank for their generous gift that made this all possible.\n\nWith no further ado, may I present to you……………….The Model.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDrum Roll, Please\n\nThe model is finished.\n\n!!!!\n\nIt was delivered to Menokin this morning by Alex Jacobson and Carmine D’Alessandro, the Harvard Graduate School of Design students, who constructed it under the supervision of Jorge Silvetti. They drove it down, under the cover of darkness, from Boston arriving late last night in Tappahannock.\n\nHere is a sneak peak. But you’ll have to wait until next week to see the model. Why? Because I’m mean. And I want you to salivate!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
