        "text": "Archivi\n\nSerrapetrona\n\nCity of Serrapetrona\n\nVia G. Leopardi, 18-0733 908321\n\nThe origins of Serrapetrona totaled around the eleventh century, when the castrum appeared belonging to the Benedictine Abbey of Farfa.\n\nAlthough it is reasonable to think back to Lombard, the oldest artifacts lead to appropriations of Roman and even acquaintances Neolithic and Paleolithic age. With the privilege issued in 1270 Serra Filiorum Petroni (so the full name that is often read in the papers) passes under the rule of Camerino, from which you will emancipate only in the early nineteenth century. The name means “closing” or “locking a mountain valley” as it can be seen from the position that the country occupies on the right of Cesolone.\n\nDean Church: inside a Crucifixion on the table (the second half of the thirteenth century. Anonymous Marche); the “Marriage of St. Catherine” (fresco of the end ‘400); a cross stational (sec. XV); a painting attributed to Louis camerte Valeri and especially the “Resurrection of Christ”, eight figures fresco discovered during the removal of the Altarpiece (1961), dated to the second quarter of the fourteenth century.\n\nPenna San Giovanni\n\nPenna San Giovanni\n\nPiazza Hall – 0733 669119\n\nShrouded in mystery is the origin of Penna San Giovanni. The first and oldest memory goes back to 1248, attested by the “Diplomatic Code”. This legal act is somewhat suggestive content. With it the notables of the Castle of Monte San Giovanni result in the sale of the fortress allowing that the population was erected precisely to community. In etymology, we trace the word “Fin” in the Hebrew language, meaning “corner”. Similarly we find in Latin, meaning space more appropriate than “offshore steep” which accurately represents the position of Penna. But the prevailing opinion wants to reconnect the pen name to Celtic: language spoken by populations Spanish-British. Several locations still called by the term pen are placed exactly in the steep hills, in Spain, in Britain and also in northern Italy. On the other hand the name of Apennins would derive from the same linguistic root. The reference to Saint John, made use to differentiate between other “pens”, born from the first temple that Pennesi erected on the height.\n\nONE OF THE MOST CONTRADE SUGGESTIVE: Villa Saline\n\nIt extends to the river itself. On the banks of the Saline spring water, mineral water salt, bromine and iodine-sulfur natural, whose healing properties were discovered as early as 1876. At the beginning of the twentieth century began to use the waters for therapeutic purposes, but the onset of the war ended exploitation. For several years, thanks to the city administration, is attempting a revival of the spa.\n\nFiordimonte\n\nCity of Fiordimonte\n\nVia Roma, 21-0737 644115\n\nIn 1435 Nicolò Fortebraccio besieged castle Cornacuna that formed the core of the country, but is scared away from Camerino and Alessandro Sforza. Fiordimonte in 1528 was the subject of retaliation the Duchess Caterina Cibo, which however failed to conquer it as the troops were engaged in decision-Pievebovigliana that resisted the passage.\n\nThe town owes its fame to the eponymous company wildlife and hunting “Valley Fiordimonte” which covers an area of ​​3000 hectares, which the particular topography of the area and the ideal habitat for hunting, make it one of the best known and equipped of Italy.\n\nCHURCHES, GUARDIAN OF ART …\n\nCastle church: preserves an imposing Crucifixion attributed to Girolamo di Giovanni (1455).\n\nNemi Church (XIII century) has a number of images due to Paul from Visso (1447) and a table of Boccati considered his masterpiece.\n\nChurch of Alfi: preserves one of the few works dated (1513) and signed by Noble from Lucca.\n\nChurch of Villanova: inside a precious polychrome wooden statue of St. Sebastian of the fifteenth century.\n\nApiro\n\nTown of Apiro\n\nPiazza Baldini, 1-0733 611 131\n\nOriginally, this small town in the Marches had different names: Pire, Piro, Lapiro. The current Apiro dates back to before the twelfth century, derived from greek PJR, pjros (fire).\n\nCollegiate Church of St. Urban dedicated to the patron, was built in 1632 for the work of Giangiacomo Baldini. The church in the Baroque style, is divided into three naves: the main altar houses an altarpiece of the seventeenth century, depicting the coronation of the Virgin and St. Urban I Pope with a majestic wooden frame carved and gilded. Keep a prestigious organ of Venetian Gaetano Callido, built in 1771. The sacristy, with wooden furniture of the ‘700, is home to a valuable collection called “Treasure of the Collegiate” and consists of paintings, busts of saints in silver, vestments and sacred.\n\nMunicipal building massive quadrangular building, identified with the ancient Palazzo dei Priori, built in 1246. The council chamber preserves a work of great artistic value in the history of painting Gothic-friendly Marche: the “Altarpiece” Allegretto Nuzi of 1366.\n\nSefro\n\nCity of Sefro\n\nPiazza Bellanti, 1-0737 45118\n\nThe origin of Sefro is very old and dates back to ancient times, as witnessed by the numerous prehistoric settlements found in the mountains surrounding it.\n\nIt is not documented, on the contrary, any Roman settlement, while his story really begins thanks to the close relationship created with Camerino after the sacking of the city by the Ghibelline troops of Manfredi of Swabia in 1259. The fact Camerinesi found refuge in Sefro and hence they were able to return to their city dipo short time. In the same period, in a cave on Mount Crestaio, he found refuge Blessed Bernard of Quintavalle, one of the first companions of St. Francis of Assisi.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages Sefro was linked to the town of Camerino and then to the Da Varano, before passing directly under the papal state.\n\nMuccia\n\nCity of Muccia\n\nVia Roma, 5-0737 646135\n\nFounded as a center of passage of the road Flaminia and legend has it that it was founded by Muzio Scaevola.\n\nDuring the lordship of Da Varano, Muccia was home to a major mill from which people drew sustenance. Also during the same lordship, the castle was expanded after numerous sacks. The castle of Jupiter has been totally destroyed, while the Massaprofoglio, which in those days was an important farm, is now being restructured. The first municipal charter believed to date back to the Napoleonic era; News about are not certain because of a fire that destroyed the archives of the City.\n\nHermitage Sanctuary of Blessed Rizzerio: favorite companion of St. Francis.

Archaeological finds unearthed at various times, testify human settlements since the Neolithic age.\n\nRomanesque age dating the names of Poggio, Trebbio, Fiegni and perhaps Podalla. In the Middle Ages, there was a certain prosperity to the prosperity of pastoralism and the art of wool and being available on-site construction materials, land thickened solids castles. Breathe it soon became the center of scenic geographical and political. IlCastrum Fiastrae, whose origins are remote, however, before the eleventh century, stood on the hill of San Paolo. In the following years Fiastra passed under the rule of King Manfred (1259), the Da Varano (1262), the Sforza (1443) and finally in 1545 under the direct jurisdiction of the Papal States which followed the fortunes.\n\nthe landscape\n\nLake Fiastra, to almost 650 m. of altitude, it is a reservoir created for the production of electrical energy. Its narrow and elongated position, wedged between the Monte Fiegni and the Sibillini, makes it very attractive from the point of view of landscape. It helps make the whole environment lovable, popular with tourists and fishing enthusiasts. The best view of the lake can be enjoyed from the area Delmonte Coglia.

In particular stands out immediately in the eyes basil (Cachrys ferulacea) that dominates all others, Umbellifers by erect stem and striatum and the many fruits rounded with coasts extended into wings.\n\nAcquacanina\n\nThe name probably derives from the merger of two elements: the abundance of water in the territories and the clear reference to the dog to indicate the place to guard the valley of the High Fiastrone.\n\nE ‘documented that Acquacanina was feud of the Count of Manardo Sigfredo, of which there is memory in a document of 977. It was subsequently submitted to the Benedictine monks, before these they built the Abbey of Rio Sacro, until sec. XV when freed free municipality while under the influence of Camerino.\n\nAbbey Church of St. Mary in Rio Sacred built by the Benedictines, has the century bell tower.

The more realistic the Carolingian period as a defense in the fight against their enemies.\n\nThe first document, however, mentions that this territory is about Ministerium de Valle: the next one in 1335 in Murri de Valli and later Castrum de Murro: always in a fortification. It was the center of some importance, as to be between the civitates superiorem not cognoscentes: like a small sovereign state, with the right to coin money and to elect, since 1300, its official. It was among the first municipalities to think of a pawnbroker and since 1447 it was equipped with its own statutes.
