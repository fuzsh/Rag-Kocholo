By Elizabeth Evans

The violinist Carmine DeLeo, 93, a member of Local 802 since 1953, died of congestive heart failure on May 13, 2020 in The Woodlands, Texas.

Carmine was born on October 23, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York to parents Elisabetta and Luigi DiLeo. He was a first generation American and proudly served as a Corporal in the US Army during World War II. He was stationed in Japan as a medic. After the war, he graduated from Julius Hartt College of Music in 1952 with a Bachelor of Music and a Major in Violin. He was a member of the National Symphony in Washington, D.C. and then a member of the New Orleans Symphony in Louisiana. He married Mary Dâ€™Alessandro in 1954. In 1958, they moved back to New York and he joined Radio City Music Hall where he worked for over 40 years.

He enjoyed his family, music and the arts, and bird watching. His family and friends will always remember him as a loving family man, with a great sense of humor.

Carmine is survived by his wife, Mary, of 65 years; his children, Liz and Lou of Texas and Florida, respectively; his 6 grandchildren and his 5 great-grandchildren.

The family would like to thank their family and friends for their support during this sad time.
