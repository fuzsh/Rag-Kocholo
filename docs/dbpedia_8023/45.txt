Obituary

Sue Jane Wall, 71, of Springfield, MO passed away at her home on Tuesday, March 28, 2023. She was born on Friday, October 12, 1951 in El Paso, TX to Sarah Louise Griffin and Hugh James Henley.

Sue was happily married for over 50 years to Phillip Wall. Together they raised two children, Russell and Stacie. She adored her grandchildren and always made them feel welcome, special and loved. Sue was a great cook and a talented seamstress. She made sure no one went hungry in her home, especially during a family celebration. The majority of Sueâ€™s time was spent in the garden; she loved all plants and flowers. She provided great care to the neighborhood birds with countless bird feeders and bird houses. She loved her robins, hummingbirds and orioles and took joy in caring for them.

Most of all, Sue loved her family; there was nothing more important or held a higher value in her eyes. Her family will love and miss her tremendously.

Sue was preceded in death by her parents, two brothers Hugh and James, her sister and brother-in-law Bonnie and Bill Rogers; her father-in-law James Wall and mother-in-law Ila Wall and one granddaughter Jayden Ling.

She is survived by her husband, two children Russell Wall (wife Paula) and Stacie Ling and three grandchildren Cameron, Jackson and Sophia Ling.

Following cremation, Celebration of Life services will be held at a later date and time. Online condolences may be made at www.klingnerfuneralhome.com
