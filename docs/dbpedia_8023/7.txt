Biography

Mary "Jane" Wall was born in 1628 in Warwickshire, England. Mary was the daughter of Captain John Wall (1588-1644) and Mary Webb Wall (1590-1644).

Research Notes

Ann, the widow of John Price (born c1627) and mother of his children John and Daniel, married John Rowen, who left bequests to the orphans of John Price in his will, dated 1 May 1662.[1] That Ann's maiden name was Wall lacks support, so this profile has been detached as wife of John Price and mother of his sons John and Daniel. (Daughter Margery was not detached, as John & Ann are not known to have had a daughter and her profile cites a baptism record in FamilySearch that is attached to a John Price born in 1609. ~ FamilySearch Record: N53W-6HL, FamilySearch Person: KD11-28X)

The death location/date appeared to be based on John Rowen's will - 1662, proved in Henrico County, Virginia[2] - and was removed from the datafields, as were the surnames Price and Rowen.
