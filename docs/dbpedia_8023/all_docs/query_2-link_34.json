        "text": "[one of Brian Clarke’s beach boys]\n\nI’ve been greatly enjoying August. It is often seen as a dead month, but it has its compensations when spent at home and not on the beach.\n\nDahlias, sunflowers, and cosmos from the allotment. Ditto vast quantities of French beans - including a startlingly purple variety which is delicious - runner beans, courgettes, and now sweetcorn.\n\nBaking, too. I’ve made oaty vanilla biscuits which took me back to the days when the children were at school and I’d often bake something for when they got home. These are in a book I bought in 1983 which tells you they have been a fixture for a long, long time. The tea towel is from a hembageri in Sweden; the word means ‘small bakery’, but I like to think it means ‘home bakery’.\n\nMany an evening has been spent watching the World Athletics Championships; what some people can do with their bodies never ceases to amaze me. But also the fantastically large false eyelashes worn by some of the fastest female runners in the world - surely they cause problems?\n\nToo late now, but I wouldn’t mind a pair of the fabulous neon-pink Nike running shoes which were everywhere.\n\n[not obsessed at all]\n\nThere’s been a lot of reading, too. My Beatles book pile seems to increase in size faster than I can get through it, such is my ongoing ‘research’. In a bid to borrow and not buy, I went to the Cambridge University Library to read some of the less available/affordable titles and felt very low-brow looking at photos by Norman Parkinson and Robert Freeman in the hushed and rather intimidating music library there. I imagined various eye-rolls at having to go to the stacks to find my pop music requests when they’d probably much rather be searching for an esoteric piece of C17 Baroque music by an obscure composer. (I did order a couple of very highbrow books on the Beatles, too, and quickly realised once again that an academic approach can suck all the joy and life and energy and even reality from a good subject.)\n\n[Burnage, M19]\n\nOther reading includes a very good book on council housing which features Burnage Garden Village (early 1900s). This was just down the road from my Nana’s council house which was built later (inter-war) but benefitted from similarly high standards of design and building. It exemplified ideas of lagom in Swedish and Norwegian and I loved it as a child - it was all I ever wanted in a house and was a major influence on my thinking about domesticity.\n\n[my favourite Mme Yevonde photo]\n\nDespite London being packed with tourists, August is a pretty good month for going to lesser-known and smaller exhibitions so I’ve made an effort to get to as many in as a short a time as possible. Yevonde at the NPG is as good as I’d imagined; colour, wit, beauty, technical brilliance (although I can’t say I was drawn to all the ultra-posh society women dressed up as goddesses). The Garden Museum, however, is back on my do-not-bother list (apologies to all who do rate it - I just don’t).\n\n[‘Ardath’ by Brian Clarke]\n\nIt may be big egos all round, but Damien Hirst’s huge Newport Street Gallery was worth a trip to see the recent work in glass and collage by Brian Clarke (self-styled ‘rock star of stained glass’). It’s free, and the stained glass rock star’s massive works look great in the massive galleries.\n\n[part of wall of 210 collages by Brian Clarke]\n\nI made it to the South London Gallery in Camberwell - not the easiest place to reach on public transport - after years and years of passing it on the way to and from New Cross/Peckham/Brockley/Catford/Lewisham when Alice was at Goldsmiths then living in the area.\n\n[Fire Station annexe, not my photo]\n\nI like the old Passmore Edwards building, but I also wanted to see the annexe in the converted former Fire Station (2018) on the other side of the road. I love a good repurposing/adaptive reuse, and this is excellent. The current exhibition is brilliant; conceptual without the bollocks, with a well written guide which uses clear, meaningful language, and it’s a colourful and creative consideration of the cultural links between Peckham and Lagos.\n\nAlso now ticked off my to-get-inside list which it has been on for years, is the Peckham Rye Waiting Room. I enjoy Rye Lane the place, and highly recommend Rye Lane the film, and don’t need much of an excuse to get off a train at Peckham Rye which is one of the loveliest of all place names (I also think The Ballad of Peckham Rye is a wonderful title but I couldn’t actually finish it). So I went to see the Sarah Sze installation there and sat mesmerised while birds and colours floated and flickered on walls, a clock ticked, and multiple images deliberately created sensory overload. Again, very conceptual but accessible, beautiful, and in the perfect location. (Good review here.)\n\nFinally, there is a nicely modest subject and approach at the Brunei Gallery at SOAS in the heart of Bloomsbury. Japanese Aesthetics of Recycling is absolutely worth a (free) visit for the stunning, creative mending and reuse, and for the enormous range of fibres involved (I’d never even heard of using wisteria or elm bark).\n\nObvs wherever possible, an exhibition has to be paired with a cafe or bakery, and the Brunei Gallery is very close to Fortitude Bakehouse. Would that all galleries were that fortuitous.*\n\nHappy Sunday!"
