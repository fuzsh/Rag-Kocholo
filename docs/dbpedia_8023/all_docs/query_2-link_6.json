        "text": "Hugo Weaving, an English-Australian actor, was born on April 4, 1960, in Ibadan, Nigeria to British parents. His family moved extensively during his early years. By the time he was 13 years old, they had lived in England, Australia, and South Africa. This nomadic lifestyle would later influence his diverse, international acting career. Weaving attended The Downs School in Worcester and later Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School in Bristol. He completed his education at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Sydney, where he honed his skills for a career in acting. Weaving's professional debut came in 1981 with an Australian television series called Bodyline. However, his breakthrough role came with the 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, where he portrayed a drag queen, a performance that won him worldwide recognition. He further gained international acclaim for his roles in blockbuster franchises such as The Matrix trilogy, where he played the iconic role of Agent Smith, and The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, where he embodied the character of Elrond. Off screen, Weaving has remained committed to theater throughout his career, often returning to the stage between film projects. He has been part of various productions at the Sydney Theatre Company and won multiple awards for his theatrical performances. In 2005, he received the Australian Film Institute's Best Actor award for his role in Little Fish. Despite the fame and recognition, Weaving is known for his humility and down-to-earth nature. He is a dedicated environmentalist and an advocate for human rights, lending his voice and influence to several charitable causes.\n\nJames Ikechukwu Esomugha, popularly known as Jim Iyke, is a Nigerian actor in Nigeria's movie industry and one of the stars of the movie Last Flight to Abuja alongside Omotola Jalade Ekeinde and Hakeem Kae-Kazim. He was born on September 25, 1976 in Libreville, Gabon. His parents are Mr and Mrs Stephen Okolue, whose last name changed to Esomugha from Enugu Agidi village in Anambra State. He is the only boy in a family of eight children. Jim Iyke studied at the University of Jos, Plateau State where he got a diploma in Banking and Finance and then a B.Sc. in Philosophy."
