        "text": "MARY ADELINE KIMBLER, 85, of Port Jefferson, passed away at 1:02 P.M. Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at her residence surrounded by family. She was born on October 25, 1938 in Mason County, West Virginia, the daughter of the late Roy and Lona (Casto) Cain.\n\nOn August 18, 1956 she married Danny Lee Kimbler, who survives along with their 8 children, Brenda (Doyle Jr.) Stiver of Port Jefferson, Glenda (Mike Driscoll) Barret of Houston, Aaron (Sheila) Kimbler of Sidney, Regina (Rick) Phelps of Sidney, Jefferson Kimbler of Port Jefferson, Mary Jane Kimbler of Urbana, Carrie Nation of Sidney, and Sherry Kimbler of Anna; 18 grandchildren; 28 great-grandchildren; and 3 siblings, Alice Bennet of Bloomingburg, Sam Cain of Howell, MI; and Barbara Gray of Maplewood. She was preceded in death by son, Mark Kimbler; granddaughters, Tosha Barrett and Sherry Renee Kimbler; grandson, Trenton Gent; and brothers, Bert Hess, Lee Casto, Charlie Cain, and Henry Cain; and sisters, May Lewis, Margaruite Twohig, and Earnestine DeVault.\n\nMary was a homemaker. She attended Northtowne Church of God. Mary enjoyed crocheting, playing bingo and listening to gospel-bluegrass music. She especially enjoyed listening to her husband play his banjo and guitar. Any reason to get the family together was a good reason, and she loved spending time with and cooking for her family. She is greatly loved and will be dearly missed.\n\nA funeral service will be held on Tuesday, August 13, 2024 at 1 P.M. at Northtowne Church of God with Pastor Carl McNeill officiating. The family will receive friends at the church on Tuesday from 11 A.M. until the time of service. Burial will follow at Glen Cemetery in Port Jefferson. Arrangements are in the care of Cromes-Edwards Funeral Home. Condolences may be expressed to the Kimbler family at our website, www.cromesfh.com"
