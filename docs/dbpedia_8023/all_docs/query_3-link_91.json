        "text": "Welcome to the “motherhood club!” You knew you were going to be exhausted. You just didn’t know how depleted you were going to feel. You are giving so much to someone else, and you have nothing left for yourself. This is supposed to be one of the happiest times of your life, and you feel guilty when you realize that you are struggling. You know you need support, but you may not even know what to ask for.\n\nYou deserve to feel supported, not judged, as you navigate the twists and turns of motherhood. It’s time for you to put your “oxygen mask” on first, focusing on yourself and your needs. If you don't prioritize yourself, no one will. You deserve some of the care you so readily give to others (and your family will be better for it!)\n\nI am a marriage and family therapist, licensed in CA, MA, RI, and FL. I provide telehealth sessions for women at all stages of motherhood. Virtual sessions provide easier accessibility to what you need.\n\nI know that the decision to pursue therapy is not an easy one. We often find ourselves looking for a therapist when we are feeling most vulnerable. I would be honored to share in your journey. My interaction style is relaxed & open, and I can guarantee some laughs during every session. Please feel free to email me any questions about working together."
