        "text": "Stanley G. “Stan” Kass, 70, of Dubuque, passed away on Thursday, August 1st, at home with the love of his life by his side.\n\nVisitation will be from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, August 4th, 2024, at Leonard Funeral Home & Crematory, 2595 Rockdale Road with a wake service at 1:45 p.m.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, August 5th, 2024, at St. Columbkille Catholic Church with Fr. David Schatz officiating. Committal prayers and burial will follow at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\nStan was born on September 21st, 1953, in Dubuque, Iowa, the son of Paul and Adele (Kutsch) Kass. He married, Deb Vyverberg, on September 4th, 1976, at St. Columbkille Church. Together they built a beautiful life together.\n\nStan enjoyed watching his favorite sports teams, the St. Louis Cardinals and Iowa Hawkeyes. In his younger years he spent his time playing softball, basketball, bowling, and fishing. With the arrival of his four children his enjoyment moved from the field to coaching or cheering from the sidelines.\n\nFamily was the cornerstone of Stan’s life. He took immense pleasure in his role as “papa,” finding endless pride in their accomplishments. He was generous with his wisdom and sense of humor. He was quick to find a laugh antagonizing and “tormenting” those he loved.\n\nSurviving are his wife, Deb; four children, Nate (Katie) Kass, Caleb (Kari) Kass, Alex (Annie) Kass and Mackenzie (Jason) Sertle. His grandchildren, Dylan (Allison), Rae and Drake Reed and Braycen Kass; Kylie and Keegan Kass; Grace, Conner, Ben and Elsie Kass; Thomas, Theo and Charley Sertle. One great granddaughter Mavis Reed, to arrive this August. His siblings: Sue (Ron) Schemmel, Jane (Kevin) Kutsch, Dave (Lisa) Kass, Bonnie Kass, Cathy (Mike) Aten, Mark (Peggy) Kass, Paul (Barb) Kass and Brian (Kelly) Kass. Brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law: Barb (Dave) Biedler, Eddie (Julie) Vyverberg, Rick (Joyce) Vyverberg, Laurie (Jeff) Trannel, Lisa (David) Zboril, along with many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; his brothers, Robert and Charles Kass; and his mother- and father-in-law, Melvin and Marguerite Vyverberg.\n\nMany thanks to the doctors and nurses who have cared for Stan over the years, especially Dr. Johnson, Dr. Bland and Dr. Stille. We would also like to thank our friends and family for the outpouring of love and support at this time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a Stan Kass Memorial Fund has been established."
