        "text": "Lisa Underwood, 63, of Combined Locks, WI passed away quietly in her sleep at her home on August 5, 2024, leaving behind her beloved family who will miss her with all their hearts.\n\nLisa was born to the late Sharon Biefeld and is a graduate of Watertown High School, class of 1979, and the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. She married her college sweetheart, Greg Underwood, on September 28, 1985, and they had two daughters, Erin and Rachael.\n\nLisa devoted her life to her family and was blessed to be surrounded by many brothers and sisters from a young age. She often shared stories of her big family growing up on the farm and all the funny antics they pulled just to get by. She maintained very close relationships with her siblings and found herself the most at home when they were all together. She looked forward to her days at the family cabin in Eagle River, holiday parties, and the annual “girl’s weekend” get together. Her greatest joy was in being the most wonderful, kind, and caring wife, mother, sister, aunt, and friend she could be.\n\nIn her professional life, Lisa was a dedicated social worker and took pride in being able to give back to her community. Even in her retirement, Lisa took on part-time jobs caring for elderly clients who needed a helping hand. She spent her free time attending baseball games with her husband and long-time friends, visiting with her neighbors, walking her dogs, and traveling to California to see her daughter and brother. Lisa radiated kindness and brought so much happiness to all the lives she touched. Her legacy of warmth and generosity will be carried on through her loved ones.\n\nShe is survived by her beloved husband, Greg Underwood, daughters Erin (Chase Dekker) and Rachael Underwood, sisters Vicky Ruppert, Cheryl (Charles) Pasewald, Rebecca Gigl, and Erica (Peter) Bothe; brothers Scott (Wendy) Umland, Jeremy Umland, and Matthew English; sisters-in-law Cheryl Dotterweich and Lisa (Tim) Converse; many nieces and nephews, as well as friends.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her mother, Sharon Biefeld, brother Craig Umland, sister Holly Umland, mother-in-law Shirley Underwood; brother-in-law Terrance Marks and sister-in-law JoAnn Zubke.\n\nA Funeral Service will be held on Saturday, August 10, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. at Immanuel United Church of Christ, 510 Sullivan Ave., Kaukauna. Visitation will begin at church at 9:00 a.m. and will continue until the time of the service. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the non-profit Jane’s Journey Home for Dogs (https://www.journeyhome4dogs.com/) where proceeds will assist senior dogs and special needs pets.
