        "text": "Documentaries about the rise and fall of media company Vice, former Republican U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger and disability rights activist Patrice Jetter are heading to the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nTIFF’s Docs program gets underway Sept. 5 and will feature 21 nonfiction films from 24 countries. The program will open with the world premiere of Eddie Huang’s “Vice Is Broke,” an investigation into the once high-flying digital news outlet that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year after boasting a valuation of $5.7 billion in 2017.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nCinephil Acquires Toronto Title 'The Wolves Always Come at Night,' About Herding Family in Mongolia, Clip Debuts (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nRushlake Media Takes World Sales Rights to Nigerian Collective's 'Vagabond Queen' Ahead of Toronto World Premiere (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nRachel Maddow Banner's First Documentary Feature 'From Russia With Lev' to Debut at 'MSNBC Live: Democracy 2024'\n\nHuang, the former host of Vice’s “Huang’s World” has a unique perspective on the story, said Thom Powers, lead TIFF documentary programmer. “Eddie gives an insider account of what happened at Vice Media,” said Powers. ” He has a personal axe to grind because when the company filed for bankruptcy, he was one of its many creditors. The film is both funny and poignant as he interviews other people who made Vice into a significant cultural force.\n\nIn “The Last Republican,” director Steve Pink Kinzinger (“Hot Tub Time Machine”) profiles conservative politician Kinzinger as he breaks ranks with the GOP to criticize Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“Kinzinger, who remains a staunch conservative, let Steve Pink, who is a Hollywood left winger, make a film about him because Kinzinger is a big fan of ‘Hot Tub Time Machine,'” explained Powers.\n\n“The Last Republican” is one of several political docus heading to TIFF. Billy Corben and Jen Gatien’s “Men of War,” about former U.S. Green Beret Jordan Goudreau, who was arrested on July 31 in connection to his failed 2020 coup to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, will make its world debut in Toronto. Another ripped-from-the-headlines documentary, “No Other Land,” about the resistance of Palestinian activists against forced displacement and settler expansion in the West Bank community of Masafer Yatta will make its Canadian premiere at TIFF. The film won the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival in February.\n\n“No Other Land” is one the most powerful films of the year,” said Powers. “I would be shocked if it doesn’t enter deep into the awards conversation this year.”\n\nOther notable titles in this year’s TIFF docu lineup include Raoul Peck’s “Ernest Cole: Lost and Found,” about the life, work, and legacy of the late South African photographer who chronicled the inhumanity of apartheid for the world. In May the documentary won the the L’Oeil d’or prize – the top award for documentary at the Cannes Film Festival. Magnolia Pictures will release “Ernest Cole: Lost and Found” this fall.\n\nPowers winnowed the list of 21 docs from over 900 submissions. The lineup consists of 17 films, including “Vice is Broke,” “The Last Republican” and “No Other Land,” that are seeking distribution.\n\nThe recent collapse of Participant Media and Disney’s decision to remove the Afghan war documentary “Retrograde” from all its streaming platforms, combined with streaming giants’ general disinterest in controversial social issue films, make doc sales out of TIFF a tenuous prospect.\n\n“We have the privilege to be putting forward what we think are the most powerful films we saw this year,” said Powers. “The people who come to TIFF have a privilege to see those films. We all collectively advocate as loudly as we can for opportunities for other people to see those films, whether those opportunities come at other festivals or on global streamers. I can pick the films that I think most people want people to see, and then it’s up to the people who run those distribution companies to choose which films they can be an advocate for.”\n\nThis year’s TIFF Doc lineup also features films profiling women, including Sinéad O’Shea’s “Blue Road – The Edna O’Brien Story,” about the late Irish novelist, memoirist, playwright, poet and short-story writer; Leila Amini’s “A Sisters’ Tale,” about the director’s sister; and Ted Passon’s “Patrice: The Movie” about disability rights activist Patrice Jetter.\n\nThose TIFF doc titles join a number of documentaries already announced as part of the gala and platform programs, including the world premieres of “Elton John: Never Too Late,” “Andrea Bocelli: Because I Believe,” “Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band,” “Will & Harper,” “The Wolves Always Come at Night,” “Viktor” and “Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara.”\n\nThe full list of the TIFF Docs lineup follows:\n\n“A Sisters’ Tale”\n\nLeila Amini\n\nSwitzerland/France/Iran\n\nInternational Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story”\n\nSinéad O’Shea\n\nIreland/United Kingdom\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Ernest Cole: Lost and Found”\n\nRaoul Peck\n\nFrance\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\n“From Ground Zero”\n\nWissam Moussa, Nidal Damo, Ahmed Hassouna, Alaa Ayoub, Karim Satoum, Bashar Al Babisi, Khamis Masharawi, Nida’A Abu Hasna, Tamer Nijim, Ahmed Al Danaf, Rima Mahmoud, Muhammad Al Sharif, Basil El Maqousi, Mustafa Al Nabih, Rabab Khamis, Mustafa Kulab, Alaa Damo, Hana Eleiwa, Mahdi Kreirah, Aws Al Banna, Islam Al Zeriei, Etimad Washah\n\nPalestine/France/Qatar/Jordan\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Living Together”\n\nHalima Elkhatabi\n\nCanada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\n“Men of War”\n\nJen Gatien, Billy Corben\n\nUSA/Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Mistress Dispeller”\n\nElizabeth Lo\n\nChina/USA\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“No Other Land”\n\nYuval Abraham, Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Rachel Szor\n\nPalestine/Norway\n\nCanadian Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Patrice: The Movie”\n\nTed Passon\n\nUSA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\n“Russians at War”\n\nAnastasia Trofimova\n\nCanada/France\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“So Surreal: Behind the Masks\n\nNeil Diamond, Joanne Robertson | Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Space Cowboy”\n\nMarah Strauch, Bryce Leavitt\n\nUSA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Sudan, Remember Us\n\nHind Meddeb\n\nFrance/Tunisia/Qatar\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Tata Lina Vdovîi”\n\nRadu Ciorniciuc\n\nRomania/Germany/Netherlands\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Temporary Shelter”\n\nAnastasiia Bortuali\n\nIceland\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“The Freedom of Fierro”\n\nSantiago Esteinou\n\nMexico/Canada/Greece\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“The Last of The Sea Women”\n\nSue Kim\n\nUSA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\n“The Last Republican”\n\nSteve Pink\n\nUSA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Vice Is Broke”\n\nEddie Huang\n\nUSA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Wishing on a Star”\n\nPeter Kerekes\n\nItaly/Slovakia/Czech Republic/Austria/Croatia\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\n“Your Tomorrow”\n\nAli Weinstein\n\nCanada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024"
