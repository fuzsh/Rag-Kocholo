        "text": "This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on the art world’s expanded view of what art is and who can make it.\n\nThe multimedia British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare made his name with work that tackled colonialism, the subjugation of peoples that enabled the global slave trade and carved a callous cartography across Africa and other continents.\n\nFor more than three decades, Mr. Shonibare’s sculptures, paintings, videos, photography, films and installations have often employed Dutch wax fabric, the colorfully patterned textiles that are widely associated with Africa.\n\nBut for Mr. Shonibare, the fabric is also the embodiment of colonialism: Dutch colonists in the 1800s copied the batiks they found in Indonesia and mass-produced the fabrics in Holland. Finding no market in Europe, they sold the textiles in West Africa, where the fabric became ubiquitous.\n\nMr. Shonibare’s more recent works, including some on view in New York later this month, explore a different kind of colonialism — in his words, “the African contribution to Modernism,” which is how European artists in the 20th century developed Cubism and Abstraction, in part by adopting and adapting African aesthetics found in masks, instruments, carved figures and other objects they had encountered in museums or collected as artifacts from galleries or street markets in Europe.\n\nMr. Shonibare said his fascination with this part of art history “evolved from looking closely at Picasso’s collection of African art,” and later that of others, including André Derain, Constantin Brancusi and Francis Picabia. Even as these white male artists were lionized by Western art history, the African men and women who contributed to such a key part of Western visual culture remain nameless.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
