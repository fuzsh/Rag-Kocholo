The pyramidal calendar is organized by the fifth palindromic triangular number, 666—a number with myriad positive and negative connotations. For BAMPFA’s Art Wall, Jane centered and enlarged the portion of the three-part calendar that refers to the time period when the work will be on view at BAMPFA. A black grid outlines the color-coded days of the week, while hand-drawn notations mark full moons, equinoxes, and solstices to queer and cross-reference the relationship of natural cycles with European constructions of time. The center form on the wall is flanked by the two complementary triangles from the calendar, which have been rotated and set at unique scales that suggest a sense of disjointed movement...\n\nKnown for detailed and colorful representations of numerical patterns and sequences, Xylor Jane has created an art wall based on her calendar #11, 1/6/21–6/26/26 for her first museum presentation in Northern California.

The center form on the wall is flanked by the two complementary triangles from the calendar, which have been rotated and set at unique scales that suggest a sense of disjointed movement much like the relationships between the many types of time the calendar represents.\n\nBorn in Long Beach, California, Jane moved to the Bay Area to attend the now-closed San Francisco Art Institute in the early 1990s, after which she became an active participant in the art scene centered in the Mission neighborhood and alternative venues such as The Lab and the Luggage Store Gallery. Her work has been shown in solo exhibitions nationally and internationally. Jane lives and works in Greenfield, Massachusetts."
