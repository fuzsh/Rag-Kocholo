        "text": "Scott G. Munson, 63, formerly of Watertown, New York, passed away peacefully on July 30, 2024, at University Hospital in Syracuse, NY after his heroic fight with cancer.\n\nScott was born to Reginald G. and Jane H. (Hall) Munson on May 7, 1961, in Watertown, NY. He was a graduate of Watertown High School and later moved to Syracuse, NY. Scott was a man of all trades until he was forced to retire early due to disability.\n\nIn his free time, Scott enjoyed bowling, boating and fishing. His daily walks through Syracuse made him a friendly, familiar face in his neighborhood. He could make friends anywhere he went and his friendly presence will be missed in his community.\n\nScott is survived by his former partner, Bonnie Saparito, children, Ashlee (Christopher) Darrow of Cortland, NY, Sean (Nicole) Munson of Hiram, GA, and Brittany Munson of Liverpool, NY; 6 grandchildren (Elaina, Connor, Kayleigh, Ashton, Caleb, Aalayah); his brother and sister-in-law, Steven & Sherri Munson of Watertown, NY; his sister, Susan Munson, and her husband, Roy Fulkerson, Jr. of Watertown, NY; a brother-in-law, Dale Schnoor of Iowa; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nBesides his parents he is predeceased by his sister, Sandra Schnoor.\n\nArrangements are with the Johnson Funeral Home. A graveside service will be held August 9th at 10am at the Dexter Cemetery.\n\nDonations in Scott’s memory may be made to Hospice of Jefferson County, 1398 Gotham Street, Watertown, NY, 13601.
