After traveling throughout Europe and the Middle East, he led Birthright trips through Israel, fully strengthening his affinity for travel. A native New Yorker, Mike graduated with a B.A. in Sociology from the University of Vermont.\n\nMike is a food and action-adventure enthusiast: There’s no activity he won’t try, no sport he won’t watch and no food he won’t eat. Some of his favorite experiences include bike riding through a small Portuguese town at midnight, watching Nelson Mandela’s funeral from a cafe in Soweto (Johannesburg), watching the World Cup with locals in Marrakesh, swimming in the Dead Sea, knife-making in Japan and hot-air ballooning in Cappadocia.\n\nSince 2016, Mike has been listed as a Conde Nast Traveler Top Travel Specialist for his expertise in Morocco, Portugal and other destinations.
