        "text": "I found a baptism for Jane Wall on Family Search\n\nJane Wall, baptised 22 November 1840, St Peter, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, parents: Thomas and Sarah.\n\nI also found her siblings, baptised at the same place.\n\nCharlotte Wall, baptised 7 August 1834\n\nJob Wall, baptised 13 December 1837\n\nMary Ann Wall, baptised 20 March 1839\n\nThomas Wall, baptised 26 September 1841\n\nHenry Wall, baptised 14 August 1842\n\nMatilda Wall, baptised 18 March 1844\n\nThere are earlier baptisms in what are described as St Peter or Collegiate, Wolverhampton, that I'm not certain are the children of the same Thomas and Sarah.\n\nWilliam Wall, baptised 22 August 1821\n\nJulia Wall, baptised 12 July 1825\n\nPamelia Wall, baptised 9 May 1825\n\nThomas Wall, baptised 11 May 1829\n\nGeorge Wall, baptised 30 January 1831.\n\nI found a marriage of a Thomas Wall and a Sarah Hill at St Peters, Wolverhampton on 5 March 1820. I'm just not sure if the later baptisms belong to this marriage.\n\nI found the 1851 census for your Wall family. So, it looks like the earlier baptisms are part of your family, too, meaning the the 1820 marriage is that of Jane's parents. It's odd, though that the age is three years out.\n\nBell Street, Wolverhampton\n\nHO107 piece 2018 folio 133 page 27\n\nSarah Wall. Head. Widow. 52. born 1799. Sweeps widow. born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nWilliam Wall. Son. Widower. 29. born 1822. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nJohn Wall. Son. Unmarried. 27. born 1824. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nGeorge Wall. Son. Unmarried. 20. born 1831. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nHenry Wall. Son. Unmarried. 7. born 1844. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nJohn Wall. Nephew. Unmarried. 14. born 1837. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nJulia Wall. Daughter. Unmarried. 28. born 1823, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nSharlotte Wall. Daughter. Unmarried. 16. born 1835. Stover at Japan, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nMary A. Wall. Daughter. Unmarried. 11. born 1840. Stover at Japan, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nJane Wall. Daughter. Unmarried. 8. born 1843. Stover at Japan, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nEdward Hickestone. Servant. Unmarried. 14. born 1837. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nHenry Pards. Servant. Unmarried. 14. born 1837. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nSamuel Hardwick. Servant. Unmarried. 28. born 1823. Sweep, born Wolverhampton, Staffordshire\n\nI didn't find Sarah in any later censuses.\n\nHere are a couple of possibilities for her death, all in Wolverhampton.\n\nI only found one possibility for her death. Q1. 1865. Wolverhampton. No age is given. The other Sarah Walls who died in that time period were the wrong age.\n\nEdit: I found an index of Wolverhampton parish registers online. I'll go through them and try to find Thomas and Sarah's parents for you.\n\nhttps://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org....ources/indexes\n\nI found the most likely baptism for Thomas.\n\nThomas Wall, baptised 21 January 1801, St Peter, Wolverhampton, son of George and Sarah.\n\nAnd his siblings.\n\nSarah Wall, baptised 8 January 1797\n\nJohn Wall, baptised 30 December 1798\n\nThomas Wall, baptised 21 January 1801\n\nGeorge Wall, baptised 27 February 1803\n\nAlso Thomas' parents marriage.\n\nGeorge Wall married Sarah Hanks, 10 November 1794, St Peter, Wolverhampton\n\nThe most likely baptism for Sarah\n\nSarah Hill, baptised 4 April 1802, St Peter, Wolverhampton. daughter of Elijah and Elizabeth\n\nHer siblings.\n\nMary Hill, baptised 17 October 1803\n\nElijah Hill, baptised 4 August 1806\n\nEdward Hill, baptised 16 October 1808\n\nSarah's parents' marriage\n\nElijah Hill married Elizabeth Hands, 30 July 1800, St Peter, Wolverhampton\n\nI didn't find the burial of either Thomas or Sarah in the indexes.\n\nI did find Job Wall, infant, buried 11 November 1838, St Peter, Wolverhampton and\n\nMatilda Wall, infant, buried 28 July 1844, St Peter, Wolverhampton\n\nNote: the indexes go back to the 16th century so you can keep tracing your family lines for some time, as long as they remained there. You'll want to check the originals some time, though. There's like a lot more information there, not only in the 18th century, but the 19th. The indexes go up to 1837 for marriages, 1875 for baptisms, and and 1862 for burials."
