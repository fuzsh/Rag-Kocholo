        "text": "A Texas native, I grew up under the wide-open skies of west Texas and stayed relatively close to home to pursue higher education at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, TX. There I received a Bachelor's degree in psychology in 1999 and Master's degree in counseling psychology in 2001. My pursuit for higher education took me further as I moved to the metroplex in 2001 and began working at Cook Children's. A few years later I began a doctoral program at the University of North Texas in Denton, TX, where I earned a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology with an emphasis in Cognitive Neuroscience in 2013. During my graduate training, I spent a two and a half years working in the Neurotherapy Program conducting neurofeedback, where I learned to interpret EEGs and quantitative EEGs.\n\nMy career at Cook Children's began in 2002, working in the Life After Cancer Program in the Hematology & Oncology Center, where I conducted research in the areas of quality of life and cognitive outcomes of cancer therapy in pediatric cancer survivors for eight years. I then transitioned to the Research department where I spent several years conducting research in the areas of epilepsy, movement disorder, and neurosurgery while working with neurologists and neurosurgeons in the Jane and John Justin Neurosciences Center. My role in the research department continued to expand and in 2014, I moved into a manager role. While still providing services directly to Neurosciences, I also began to focus on increasing the investigator-initiated research support service line at Cook Children's. In my new role, I provided direct and indirect support and oversight of scientists focused on internally developed, investigator-initiated and Sponsor-Investigator IND clinical research protocols. In 2015, in an effort to fully develop a collaborative program to offer a research experience during medical school, I was appointed Adjunct Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Since that time, we have hosted numerous medical students through the Pediatric Research Program.\n\nAs part of my ongoing effort to continually expand the breadth and depth of investigator-initiated research at Cook Children's, I accepted the role of Director in the newly formed division of Research Data Science & Analytics in 2019. This division was developed to accelerate data-driven research, promote collaboration, and train future leaders. The division connects data science experts with investigators in all fields to spark discovery and pairs research scientists with investigators to provide comprehensive research support for investigators pursuing investigator-initiated research at Cook Children's.\n\nOutside of my work, I serve on a couple of boards for non-profits. One focused on innovative primary care and public health research and the other is focused on providing childhood experiences to children who come from hard places. My free time is often spent at camps and retreats for these children or with my son at the pool, at the movies, working on computers, or just doing what he wants to do. I enjoy music, cooking, and doing anything that allows me to work with power tools.\n\nMyNCBI\n\nResearch Gate\n\nLinkedIn\n\nI was raised outside of Houston in Magnolia, Texas. I then attended Texas A&M University in College Station, TX as a 3rd generation Aggie. During my time there I was involved with Aggies for Christ, Reed Rowdies (Basketball club), an avid attender of A&M football games, as well as an undergrad research assistant in an evolutionary genetics lab. In 2018 I graduated with my bachelors degree in Genetics with a minor in public health. I started my career at ST Genetics, where I was a laboratory technician and later became a data analyst. While there I began pursuing my masters in Statistics, which I would later complete in 2022. In 2023, my wife and I spent time teaching English abroad in Argentina through Let's Start Talking. Later that year I began my time here at Cook Children's Hospital as a Research Scientist with the neuroscience department. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and our standard poodle Theo. I also love camping, just about all outdoor activities, playing basketball, and studying the word of God!\n\nI was born in the beautiful Caribbean island of Jamaica W.I. I migrated to the US as an international student at Prairie View A&M University where I completed my BBA-Management (2005). I later completed my Masters of Business Administration-Finance and Masters in Healthcare Administration (2008), and Doctorate in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies (2015) at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). After completing my doctoral studies, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the LINK Research Lab, UTA for one year (2016) where I further pursued research on college graduates' career transitions. My personal career path later transitioned to the Oakwood University as Assistant Professor, Finance and Strategic Management, where I taught and continued my research (2016 – 2019).\n\nIn February 2020, my career took another turn when I joined Cook Children's Health Care System in Fort Worth, Texas as Research Project Manager. My time has been with both the Genetics and Pain Management research teams. Within each respective department, our emerging research focuses on pharmacogenetic variability in pediatric patients with depression and the usage of massage therapy and virtual reality to help mitigate patients' anxiety and pain.\n\nIn my spare time, I like reading spiritual books, swimming, and above all enjoying my family.\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nLinkedIn\n\nI was born in Frankfurt, Germany, but consider myself a native of San Antonio, Texas. I attended the University of Oklahoma where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Health and Exercise Sciences. Prior to joining Cook Children's, I worked at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) for 16 years. During my career at OUHSC I held various roles from a Research Assistant and Exercise Physiologist for both the General Clinical Research Center and the Children's Metabolic Research Institute and most recently as a Research Program Coordinator for the Adult and Pediatric Urology departments. My proudest accomplishment at OUHSC was being selected to implement Oklahoma's only Pediatric Bone Clinic at OU Children's Physicians Endocrinology Clinic. I was responsible for clinically administering and analyzing bone density and body composition scans of patients using a GE Luna DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) machine.\n\nIn 2016, I joined Cook Children's Medical Center as a certified Clinical Research Coordinator for the newly established Pediatric Urology clinic. I'm assigned as the Lead Research Coordinator for the department's primary study titled, DSD Long-Term Outcomes of Interventions for Reproductive Dysfunction: Continence, Behavioral Outcomes, and Novel Predictors of Brain Masculinization (STUDY 1 - 4); a 10-year project which consist of thirteen national sites and is sponsored by the National Institute of Health (NIH). Since arriving at Cook Children's I have expanded to working with investigators from the Emergency Medicine, Orthopedics, Pain Medicine and Trauma departments to initiate new research projects. In 2019, I earned the Cook Children's Medical Center Team Peak Performer Award for my work with the Aim for Safety team regarding Gun Safety and our intervention project, Increasing Utilization of Gun Safety Devices. To date, I have 27 peer-reviewed research articles as well as numerous conference presentations.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, working out, watching college football, vacationing, and cheering for my favorite teams – Oklahoma Sooners, Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nResearchGate\n\nLinkedIn\n\nI was born in Honolulu, Hawaii but have called Texas home since I was 2 years old. I attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and earned a BS in Life Sciences. With that came 5 years of service in the US Army as an infantry officer. During this time I had the honor of leading soldiers on two combat deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After my military service, I decided to dive into research and earned a master's degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio as well as a PhD from Rice University both majoring in bioengineering. Prior to coming to Cook Children's, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Houston Methodist Research Institute where I conducted research in tissue engineering for congenital heart defects. My research focused on the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into functional beating cardiomyocytes as well as developing biomimetic materials for full cardiac wall repair. While at Cook Children's I have been able to continue my interests in pediatric cardiovascular research as a project manager in the Heart Center assisting cardiologists and surgeons in their clinical research endeavors. In my free time, you'll either find me spending time with the family, smoking meat or building stuff, anything from furniture to fly rods.\n\nGoogle Scholar\n\nLinkedIn\n\nI received my Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from Baylor University. My graduate research investigated the neurobiological correlates of alcohol use and its impact on memory and motor function throughout different life stages, including adolescence, adulthood, and aging. My research during my NIH T32-funded postdoctoral fellowship at the Barshop Institute of Longevity and Aging Studies focused on the brain's vascular system and its role in age-related cognitive decline during healthy aging and in Alzheimer's disease. I identified a specific pathway, mTOR, which could be targeted to treat age-related cognitive impairment by restoring several different aspects of brain vascular function. After this, I transitioned to clinical research, specializing in data analysis for a medical device company in San Antonio that provides innovative solutions for non-compressible hemorrhage.\n\nAt Cook Children's, I am a Research Scientist who is partnered with the medical director of neuro-oncology, Dr. Sibo Zhao. Together, our goal is to bring low-intensity focused ultrasound, a cutting-edge non-invasive treatment option, to neuro-oncology patients at Cook Children's. In current neuro-oncology clinical trials, acoustic energy is delivered to a specific location in the brain without damaging the surrounding brain tissue, which can be used to enhance the delivery of therapeutics through targeted drug activation and/or blood-brain barrier opening. Low-intensity focused ultrasound in pediatric neuro-oncology is currently limited to clinical trials and is not an FDA-approved treatment. Please reach out to learn more about the current and upcoming clinical trials with low-intensity focused ultrasound at Cook Children's."
