        "text": "Jerry Douglas “Poppa Jerry” Hughes, age 81, of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, left this earth for his heavenly reward on Sunday, August 4, 2024. To know him was to love him. His positive attitude was infectious and if you ever met him, he knew your entire life’s story and you knew his before you parted ways. He made sure everyone around him felt his love. Even though his truck drivers and employees may have seen a slightly tougher side of Jerry, his grandchildren always saw Poppa Jerry waiting with a hug and something new for them to learn. He began his life as the son of a tenant farmer. The hard work ethic instilled in him by his parents enabled him to have the fighting spirit which he used to build a successful transportation company from which he retired in 2020.\n\nWhen you ran into Jerry on the street, you had better be prepared to have a lengthy conversation. His chosen topics were usually Tennessee Volunteer sports, politics, his golf game, what new things his grandkids were up to, or a conversation that centered around Jesus. On Friday nights, he would be cheering on the Lawrence County Wildcats. On Saturdays, he would have on his orange and white while proudly yelling, “GO BIG ORANGE”. And on Sundays, he would be praising God and studying His word with his brothers and sisters at Immanuel Baptist Church.\n\nJerry was the only son and middle of 5 children born to Douglas Readus and Mary Charlyn Welch Hughes. He was preceded in death by both of his parents and 3 of his sisters, Mauveline Idell Hughes Purcell, Jane Elizabeth Hughes Smith, and Mary Carolyn Hughes Gobble. He was also preceded in death by his only son, Douglas Crowder Hughes.\n\nSurviving Jerry is his wife, Mary Ann Pennington Jones Hughes of Lawrenceburg. His sister, Joyce Marie Hughes Clark of Lawrenceburg. His 2 daughters and their families: Kenneth and Sally Hughes Coultas and Mary Susan Hughes Carvell all of Lawrenceburg, his grandchildren: Maggie Carvell Curtis (Ben) of Daphne, Alabama, Anna Claire Carvell O’Rourke of Knoxville, Isaac Carvell (Nellie), Ian Coultas, and Evan Coultas, all of Lawrenceburg. And his great-grandchildren: Ava, Mac, Poppy, Nora, Odin, and Vaan.\n\n23 years ago with his marriage to Mary Ann, Jerry was blessed to add 3 more beautiful daughters and their families to his family. Don and Sherry Jones Dull of Batavia, Ohio, Michael and Leisa Jones Dunn of St. Simones, Georgia, and Tracy and Kim Jones McDow of Hendersonville, Tennessee. Grandchildren: Kassie Tice Toungette and Taft Tice (Jessica), all of Batavia, Ohio, Alexandria Dunn of Miami, Florida, and Brandon Dunn of St. Simones, Georgia, Brantson Story, Koby Hinojosa and Peyton Hinojosa all of Hendersonville, Tennessee, and great-grandchildren Archer, Atticus, and Taft.\n\nArrangements are being handled by Neal Funeral Home, 231 N. Military Avenue, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. The family will receive friends from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM Thursday, August 8, 2024, at Neal Funeral Home. Funeral services will be conducted at Neal Funeral Home at 2:00 PM Friday, August 9, 2024, with Chad Clanton and Reggie Coleman officiating. Interment will follow at Lawrence County Memorial Gardens in Lawrenceburg, TN. The family suggests memorials be made to the American Heart Association or the American Cancer Society."
