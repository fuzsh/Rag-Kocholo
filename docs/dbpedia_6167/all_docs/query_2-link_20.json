Stay tuned for exciting initiatives and events! ðŸŒŸ\n\nYesterday in Washington, DC, CAAHEP President Donald Balasa, JD, MBA, delivered an enlightening session on \"Beyond Gainful Employment: Other Title IV Rule Revisions that Impact Quality and Eligibility\" at the prestigious CHEA/CIQG Annual Conference. The landscape of higher education and the implications of Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) are evolving, and Balasa's talk shed light on crucial changes every professional program must be aware of. Key takeaways include: -Ensuring graduates are eligible for mandatory state licensing/certification exams. -Avoiding the inclusion of courses that are unnecessary for meeting state licensing/certification requirements. For students to benefit from Title IV assistance, these stipulations underscore the dual necessity for compliance and quality in the curriculum of our professional programs. This conversation is vital for maintaining the integrity of our educational frameworks. Join the dialogue and share your perspectives on how these revisions may shape the future of professional education!\n\nWondering if a career in Education is right for you?

Please send me a message and let's try to connect. One of my major efforts this year is developing a professional development template and plan for student services staffers at SPH.

Best, JR #NASPA #studentdevelopment #studentaffairs #studentservices #graduatestudents #professionaldevelopment\n\nPresenters Needed for Virtual Professional Development The NASPA Faculty Council is accepting proposals from higher education and student affairs instructors to share effective teaching practices as part of our virtual professional development offerings for Spring 2024. We have identified three specific areas that we would like to offer professional development in, but will also consider other topical areas: 1. Centering Black liberation thought in higher education and student affairs coursework 2. Infusing Indigenous learning theory throughout higher education and student affairs coursework 3. Sentipensante theory in higher education and student affairs work 4. Other (such as, effective engagement strategies, uses of instructional technology, course design, learning assessments that prioritize equity in the classroom, etc.) We are seeking presenters with expertise in these areas to describe how to effectively utilize these approaches in higher education and student affairs teaching. A $1000 honorarium will be provided to the presenter for their time and labor. If more than one presenter is included in your proposal, the honorarium will be split evenly among all presenters. Please use the following form to provide a brief overview of your proposed professional development session and available dates to present by February 15th, 2024. The NASPA Faculty Council Professional Development subcommittee will review the submissions and follow up with selected presenters by February 29, 2024. #naspa #facultydevelopment #facultycouncil #highered https://lnkd.in/gzxdAJhQ\n\nðŸŒ¿ Did you know Seattle's enchanting nickname, \"The Emerald City,\" is inspired by its lush greenery that flourishes throughout the year?
