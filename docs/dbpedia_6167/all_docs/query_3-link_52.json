        "text": "HIGH POWER DC POWER SUPPLY WITH AUTORANGING OUTPUT\n\nMax Voltage: 80V to 1500V\n\nMax Current: 60A to 4080A\n\nMax Power: 30kW to 120kW\n\nSpace saving\n\nHigh power up to 120kw in a slim rack\n\nPRTM series, a high power DC power supply integrated the PRT series models in a single rack cabinet, offering at least three times the output range more than the previous ones.\n\nThis DC power supply employs a total current display and also provides elaborated protection as standard equipment. Accordingly, it provides strong support, especially for customers' research and development requiring high current and high power.\n\nRefer to the PRT series for base model details. PRT series\n\nNote: The PRT series disassembled from the PRTM series can be used as a stand-alone PRT unit. However, wiring and settings must be done by the customer, and they are out of warranty.\n\nFEATURES\n\n1. MORE SPACE SAVING FOR BETTER WORKPLACE\n\nIntroducing the extremely compact PRTM makes more effective use of your workspace. We have developed the smaller regeneration DC power supply for space saving aimed at installing other measuring tools, which makes effective use of the space at the workplace.\n\n2. HOW TO COMPACT\n\nState-of-the-art semiconductor\n\nIn order to minimize the heat generation itself inside the power supply, we adopted the latest device including semiconductor elements of high efficiency via thorough examination. This enables the product to provide a sufficient cooling function to maximize high performance.\n\nAir-through circuit block technology\n\nWith the improvement of the air-through circuit block, the product has been made smaller, and we also have put more focus on the improvement of block arrangement contributing to excellent space efficiency by extremely reducing the dead space. Consequently, we achieved the significant development of high-density mounting technology. While extra spaces inside the device had been required to release the heat so far, we successfully made the product even smaller to ensure the total amount of height of a mere 133 mm.\n\n3.

Once the power supply units are installed, no operation of the rated output is checked.\n\nFunctions\n\nFunctions with Front USB Port and Standard Attached Software\n\n(1) Sequence program function: MSS (Matsusada Sequence Software)\n\nEasy to use for beginners\n\nMSS allows you to create sequence program data using the main unit or a computer with the dedicated software (MSS).\n\nThe software makes it easier and more convenient to create sequence program data. The created sequence program data can be saved to USB memory, and up to 1,024 steps of the sequence program can be loaded.\n\n(2) Operation log display: MLV (Matsusada Log Viewer)\n\nInstant graphing of operation logs\n\nOperation log display function: MLV, the dedicated software can read and graph the operation log.\n\nLogging to USB memory is available not only during the sequence operation as described in (1) above but also during the local/external control.\n\nEasy editing of operation logs\n\nMLV can select items you need and save them in CSV format, so you can also edit the data in spreadsheet software with no problem.\n\n[Display items]\n\nElapsed time\n\nCC/CV mode\n\nOutput value (Voltage, Current, and Power)\n\nStatus\n\nOther information on errors, etc.\n\nLarge Color Touch Panel\n\nPRT/PRTM series comes with a large color touch panel, realizing its operability and visibility improvement.\n\nEasy setting of output voltage, current, power, and other parameters !\n\nSimple setting to complex sequence program !\n\nNew feature with more selectable error detections !\n\nEqually available in a conventional configuration with the setting dial\n\nSequence Programming Function\n\nThe sequence programming function allows the programming of parameters such as step time, step amplitude, ramp, CV/CC mode, sequence program end-setting, step jump, and jump count by simply operating on the front panel. This option enables you to generate customized original waveforms, and you can use a great variety of applications including testing evaluation, and verification.\n\nStep setting time 0.0 to 3,600 s\n\nFor one program, a maximum of 1,024 steps can be configured and saved.\n\nCV/CC mode can be set for each program.\n\nRepetition frequency: infinity, or 1 to 999 Program as Image\n\nCV/CC Priority Setting Function\n\nCV (constant voltage) priority/CC (constant current) priority mode can be selected and set. As is the case with diodes, a load tends to suddenly change the resistance at certain points. When the device is started in CV mode, the current will be momentarily overshot. In the PRT series, select the CC priority mode to suppress the occurrence of overshoot. The function can reduce the risk of damaging expensive loads such as high-power laser diodes.\n\n* In the CC priority mode, do not by releasing the voltage setting and setting the CC value to the lowest within the range where the CC state can be maintained.\n\nVariable Internal Resistance Function (in CV mode)\n\nSet the internal resistance to any value to generate a voltage drop when the load current flows.\n\nBatteries, photovoltaic cells, and fuel cells can be simulated.\n\n(The setting range of the internal resistance value is from 0 Ω to the rated voltage/rated current.)\n\nPreset Memory Function\n\nWith the preset memory function, the preset values are automatically saved when the power turns off.\n\nFurthermore, up to three different voltage, current, and power settings are also memorized respectively.\n\nSink current prevention function\n\nThe function is suitable for supplying power to loads with capacities like batteries and capacitors. It reduces the reverse current flowing from the load to the unit in order to prevent a voltage drop on the load as the output is OFF or the set voltage is lowered.\n\nNote: Reverse current cannot be controlled and stabilized. In order to protect the power supply unit, connect a dummy resistor or reverse current prevention diode if the load of the reverse voltage is equal to or higher than the rated voltage (inductive loads, regenerative motors, etc.).\n\nTwo-mode Lock Function\n\nThe locking is selectable from two setting modes: One is \"Full LOCK\" to lock all front panel operations, and the other is \"Normal LOCK\" to lock all operations except the ON/OFF switch.\n\nThe function is so user-friendly that the \"Full LOCK\" mode is provided to ensure the prevention of erroneous operation, and the \"Normal LOCK\" function facilitates the emergency stop while preventing erroneous operation. Emergency stop operation using the POWER ON/OFF switch is possible in either mode.\n\nPassword Function New\n\nIn this function, to cancel the two-mode lock function, input a 4-digit PIN code. (Enable/Disable is selectable.)\n\nExternal Analog Control\n\nExternal output ON/OFF\n\nRemote sensing\n\nRemote/Local mode setting\n\nStatus output\n\nOutput monitor\n\nOutput control\n\n(Voltage, Current, Power, Overvoltage protection, Overcurrent protection, Overpower protection)\n\nResidual Voltage Detection LED\n\nUse for checking residual voltage\n\nThe LED on the rear panel blinks when there is voltage remaining on the DC output terminal in output or at output off. it is useful for reference to check if the voltage remains. Be sure to check the voltage before the operation of the unit.\n\nConstant Power Control Function (CP mode)\n\nIn addition to constant voltage control (CV mode) and constant current control (CC mode), a constant power control (CP mode) is provided.\n\nWith CP mode, a constant power supply is provided depending on loads, such as resistors (heaters) whose resistance changes with temperature. It is available without monitoring voltage/current or attaching external control devices (temperature regulators).\n\nSpecifications\n\nFor details, download the datasheet below.\n\nOptions\n\n-LBr\n\nProtective breaker\n\nOne overcurrent protection device with a circuit breaker is installed in each rack.\n\nThis option is only available for models with six or fewer installed power supplies.\n\n-LCa *1 *2\n\nCAN interface port\n\nUsing CAN communications, output controlling and operation status monitoring of these devices can be performed.\n\n-LEb\n\nEye bolts\n\nFour eyebolts mounted to the top side allow you to move the product using cranes.\n\n-LGob *1 *2\n\nOptical interface port\n\n-LGob: Optical interface + optical cable 2 meters\n\n-LGob(Fc5): Optical interface + optical cable 5 meters\n\n-LGob(Fc10): Optical interface + optical cable 10 meters\n\n-LGob(Fc20): Optical interface + optical cable 20 meters\n\n-LGob(Fc40): Optical interface + optical cable 40 meters\n\nThe unit is remotely controlled by isolating with optical communication.
