        "text": "The PrTMS treatment process is more thorough and detailed than traditional TMS Therapy and involves the following steps.\n\nInitial Brainwave Assessment\n\nThe initial phase begins with a thorough brainwave and neurocognitive assessment. The assessment identifies any irregular brainwave patterns that may be causing the patient’s condition or symptoms.\n\nTreatment Plan\n\nBased on the initial assessment, a personalized treatment plan is created that outlines the frequency and intensity of the magnetic pulses to be used, as well as the duration of recommended treatment sessions.\n\nReview and Approval\n\nThe personalized treatment plan is reviewed and approved by a qualified PrTMS provider to ensure it is safe and appropriate for each patient’s condition.\n\nTreatment Sessions\n\nWhen the PrTMS sessions begin, magnetic pulses are delivered to targeted areas of the brain as outlined by the treatment plan recommendations. The treatment sessions are typically performed over a period of several weeks.\n\nContinuous Monitoring and Adjustment\n\nThroughout the treatment process, the patient’s response to therapy is closely monitored and the treatment plan is adjusted as needed to optimize the results.\n\nPrTMS uses technologies and questionnaires to provide a comprehensive assessment of each person’s brainwave patterns, mental health condition, and areas of improvement to focus on during treatment.\n\nEEG Brain Mapping\n\nPrTMS uses EEG Brain Mapping technology to evaluate and assess each person’s unique brainwave patterns and activity. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) reviews 19 areas of the brain related to emotions and cognitive function.\n\nAn EEG brain map is quick, painless, and noninvasive, and it measures brainwave activity through sensors placed on the scalp.\n\nDiagnosing Irregular Brainwave Activity\n\nThe EEG assessment will identify areas of the brain associated with abnormal brainwave patterns and activity that may be causing mental health conditions and symptoms. This data will be used for developing a treatment plan.\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nEach patient completes a written questionnaire to provide information about their condition and symptoms. This information, combined with the EEG mapping results, is necessary for creating a customized treatment plan.\n\nProprietary Software Analysis\n\nPrTMS uses proprietary software and algorithms developed by PeakLogic to analyze the brainwave assessment data. This analysis creates an individualized treatment plan that is customized for each person’s unique brain function.\n\nThe treatment plan identifies the specific areas of the brain to target during treatment, as well as the frequency and intensity of magnetic stimulation during treatment.\n\nContinuous Monitoring and Adjustment\n\nDuring the course of PrTMS, the sessions are continuously monitored, and new EEGs are performed to evaluate changes in brainwave patterns and activity related to treatment. The brain location targeting, frequency, and intensity are all adjusted accordingly to optimize the results and further improve cognitive function.\n\nThe patient remains awake during the entire session and can wear earplugs while sitting comfortably in a chair as the PrTMS technician places the magnetic coil over the head.\n\nThe PrTMS device is positioned against the scalp at the precise locations determined by the EEG assessment to target specific areas of the brain that require stimulation.\n\nThe device makes clicking sounds and the client will feel a faint tapping sensation on the scalp while the coil is transmitting magnetic pulses, followed by a pause, and then tapping will resume.\n\nPrTMS sessions generally last for 20 to 60 minutes depending on the treatment plan, the condition being treated, and the individual needs of each patient.\n\nMost patients receive five PrTMS sessions per week as outlined in the treatment plan. After approximately five sessions, a new EEG assessment will be performed to evaluate the patient’s response to treatment and adjust the targeting location, frequency, and intensity of the next round of sessions.\n\nMany people notice an improvement of symptoms within a few sessions, and this continues as therapy progresses.\n\nThere is no downtime from the procedure and normal activities can be resumed immediately after each session."
