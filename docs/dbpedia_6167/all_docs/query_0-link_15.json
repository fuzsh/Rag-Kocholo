The WebAwards is the standards-defining competition that sets benchmarks for 90 industries, including travel, airline and hotel & lodging websites, based on the seven criteria of a successful web site. The deadline for the best travel web sites to enter to be judged is May 31, 2024.\n\n“Travel websites serve as a crucial portal, opening up the world to millions and sparking the desire for exploration,” stated William Rice, President of the Web Marketing Association. “In an era where the internet has revolutionized travel, eliminating traditional agents as the primary source of information, travel websites have risen to the challenge, embodying innovation and user-friendliness. Our judges particularly commend the exemplary use of design, engaging content, and interactive features in these sites. The WebAward Competition not only highlights the industry’s finest achievements in website development but also provides invaluable feedback and marketing opportunities, setting the stage for future innovations and attracting a new wave of adventurers.”\n\nWebsites are judged on seven criteria including design, innovation, content, technology, interactivity, copy writing and ease of use. Each WebAward entry in the Travel category is judged against other travel entries and then against an overall standard of excellence.\n\nAll travel entrants benefit from receiving valuable feedback in terms of their specific criteria scores compared against the average scores for their industry.
