The ePortfolio is a digital collection of artifacts from 7 Core Classes and 3 Electives required for graduation. Along with the presentation of artifacts, I will reflect on my experiences through critical analysis from each class.\n\nCurrently, I am working at NC State University in the Department of Parks, Recreation, Tourism Management for the PGA Golf Management Program, serving as the Internship Coordinator. This Masters degree has opened my eyes to many different items which will assist in the preparation of becoming a Director at one of the 18 Accredited PGA Golf Management Programs across the country."
