        "text": "PRT 508: Risk Management for Parks, Recreation Tourism & Sport– Michael Kanters, PhD\n\nCourse Description:\n\nRisk Management for parks, recreation, tourism, and sport organizations with an emphasis on ethical managerial strategies. Students will learn how legal concepts relate to specific managerial functions and how a knowledge of law and its impact on functions of recreation environments can help build a more efficient and successful operation that better serves the needs of its constituents and protects its ability to provide products and services. Students will also learn how effective strategies for risk management in parks, recreation, tourism and sport organizations can facilitate active-healthy lifestyles and sustainable communities.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nSummarize principals of risk management within the context of basic management functions such as governance, human resource management, and organizational operations. Identify and describe policies and practices for managing program and service risks. Emphasis on employee selection & qualifications, supervision issues, training considerations, safety and security issues, appropriate documentation.\n\nAdvanced analysis of policies and practices for managing recreation facility, built environments, trails & open space risks such as maintenance/inspection issues, OSHA guidelines and compliance, and contract negotiation and management.\n\nIdentify and describe policies for managing human resource risks (e.g., constitutional law issues, EEO, OSHA, discrimination, fair labor standards, working conditions)\n\nDiscussion how effective strategies for risk management in parks, recreation, tourism and sport organizations can facilitate active-healthy lifestyles and sustainable communities.\n\nCritically evaluate the risks inherent in a selected parks, recreation, sport or tourism operations and discuss strategies for managing risks.\n\nReflections and Summary of my work toward developing these competencies:\n\nPRT 508 offered a well rounded view of all aspects of risk management from both a legal and management perspective. Each week we were assigned readings from the textbook (Collten, D. J., & Wolohan, J. T. (2010). Law for Recreation and Sport Manager (5th ed). Dubuque, IA: Kendall Hunt.) which covered different elements of risk management including risk management theory, standards of practice, crisis management, crowd management, and evacuation planning. In addition to the readings we had the opportunity to watch interviews with Larry Perkins vice president and assistant general manager of PNC Arena, and Michael Kirschman Deputy Director for Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation Department who talk about issues related to risk management including human resources,safety and security issues, and strategies for managing risk. Each week we were given a quiz to test our knowledge of the assigned readings."
