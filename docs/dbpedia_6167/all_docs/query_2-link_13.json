        "text": "Why it’s important to prioritize your mental health\n\nIt is important to prioritize your mental health because when your mental well-being is balanced, you can function at higher levels and find true joy in life. Taking time out of our busy schedules to focus on ourselves is essential to remain emotionally stable and happy. This can include various activities like meditating, getting enough sleep, or exercising.\n\nIt can also include seeking mental health services, such as talk therapy or PrTMS. One of the biggest misconceptions about mental health treatment is that you must be in crisis or your symptoms really severe before seeking help. Luckily this is not the case! You don’t have to wait until things get really bad before getting help with your mental health.\n\nTherapy can help you learn how to manage stress and difficult emotions while also helping you to identify and develop strategies for coping with life’s challenges. PrTMS can help with brain fog, a common problem, even for those without mental health challenges. PrTMS helps regulate the brain’s activity, allowing it to function more efficiently. This can help improve the clarity of thought, focus, memory, and decision-making.\n\nWho can benefit from PrTMS treatment?\n\nPersonalized repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (PrTMS) has the potential to help those suffering from:\n\nDepression\n\nAnxiety\n\nConcussion\n\nBrain fog\n\nMemory issues\n\nSleep issues\n\nPTSD\n\nADHD\n\nIt can also help with focus & performance enhancement. It is a safe, non-invasive approach that can help alleviate symptoms and improve overall functioning for many individuals—especially those unable to achieve adequate symptom management with existing treatments such as pharmaceuticals or psychotherapy.\n\nHow do I know if PrTMS is the right treatment for me or my loved one?\n\nConsidering PrTMS as part of your healthcare plan can be a big decision that requires careful consideration. You should always check with your medical team and discuss the potential side effects in detail first. If you are unsure if this treatment is right for you, there are a few steps you can take.\n\nTaking the time to do some research, such as reading up on testimonials from people who have used it and talking with others who have undergone the treatment, can help you make an informed decision about what’s best for your particular situation. In addition, your doctor may also be able to provide some insight on whether or not this therapy might work for you. By understanding all the facts and discussing them with those in the know, hopefully, you’ll be able to make the best decision for yourself.\n\nWhat are the side effects of PrTMS treatment, and how long do they last?\n\nPersonalized repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (PrTMS) can be a safe and effective way to treat mental health conditions in certain individuals, but just like any other medical procedure, it does come with some side effects, though most are minimal. If complications do occur, they may include mild headaches, scalp pain, neck pain, tingling sensation, lightheadedness, or sleepiness.\n\nSymptoms like headaches and lightheadedness typically go away after several treatments. There is also the risk of seizures, but this side effect is rare. Although these side effects are typically mild and short-lasting, it’s important to speak to your clinician immediately if you experience any of them in an extreme way. It’s also essential to keep your doctor up-to-date on any new medications or medical issues that may arise while you are undergoing treatment. With proper care and precautions, PtTMS can be an invaluable tool for relieving mental health struggles.\n\nWhat should I expect after starting PrTMS treatments for mental health issues?\n\nStarting PrTMS sessions can be intimidating, especially if you’re unsure what to expect. It’s important to remember that every person responds differently to treatment, so the effects you experience could vary significantly from another person’s. Generally speaking, you can expect a warm and friendly atmosphere while in your appointment, with trained staff ensuring that your well-being is taken care of throughout your session.\n\nWe understand that your health and wellness are of top priority. We use a wireless electroencephalograph (EEG) to create a tailored treatment plan just for you. This EEG allows us to map 19 areas of your brain in only 4 minutes, providing us with the quantitative and qualitative information necessary to create your unique patient-specific plan.\n\nPrTMS is an extremely safe, painless, drug-free, and non-invasive process that typically lasts between 25-35 minutes over 6-8 weeks. We want to ensure that you get the best care possible, so let us know if there is anything we can do to support you throughout this journey.

We also offer many other behavioral health and mental health services, including appointments through our Telehealth platform, so you can speak to a therapist online from wherever you choose.
