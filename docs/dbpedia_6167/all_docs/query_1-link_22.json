        "text": "Introduction to ArcGIS Online\n\nArcGIS Online is a web-based GIS platform that allows for collaborative creation and sharing of GIS data, maps, and web mapping applications. Many geospatial analytical capabilities of ArcGIS Desktop are integrated in ArcGIS Online, with the difference that the only software needed is a web browser (and Internet connection!).\n\nIn this lecture, we will use your crowd-sourcing efforts with Collector and create exciting interactive mash-up maps. We will embed these maps in your own website and also create powerful web mapping applications, 3D scenes, and interactive presentations.\n\nCreating a map in ArcGIS Online\n\nTo access ArcGIS Online, open up a web browser (Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer) and type the following URL:www.arcgis.com. On the top right corner, click Sign in. In the screen that appears, type the Username and Password that Palak gave you last Tuesday. Click the Sign In button.\n\nIn the top menu, click MY CONTENT to see the data and maps created by you. You should see a Feature Layer named fauna_by_YourInitials, and a web map titled Fauna by YourInitials. We will open the Web Map to create a mash-up for Clemson. Click the inverse triangle next to Web Map and select Open in map viewer. You should see your map document with two layers:\n\n- Fauna by Yourname\n\n- Clemson Fishnet 50m\n\nIf you don't have the tree layer in your map, let's add it. On the top left menu, go to the Add button, and select Search for layers.\n\n- In the Find box type trees.\n\n- In: My Organization.\n\nClick Enter. The first result is the ClemsonTrees layer. Click the Add button next to it. Click DONE ADDING LAYERS to leave this window and return to your map. This is the layer that you all collaborative collected with your cellphones. Impressive!\n\nAdding data from ArcGIS Online\n\nYou can mash-up the data you have collected with data that other organizations (USGS, NASA, ESRI) and users have created and uploaded to the cloud. Click the Add button again, Search for layers, and follow these settings:\n\n- Find: fire potential\n\n- In: ArcGIS Online\n\nSelect the USA Wildland Fire Potential (by esri) by clicking Add.\n\nRepeat the same process for soils and add the USA Soil Survey. Zoom out to see the extent of these layers.\n\nChange the Contents view to Legend. You will see the classifications for the Soil and Widland Fire data. Go back to Content so we can manipulate the data.\n\nChanging the basemap\n\nZoom into the extent of the Fishnet layer by clicking its inverse triangle and selecting Zoom to. Uncheck the soil and wildland layers so we can see the imagery underneath.\n\nAt the top menu, click Basemap, and select OpenStreetMap to be able to see buildings and paths more clearly. Select other basemaps to see the different options available to you. Change your Basemap to Imagery.\n\nGeospatial Analysis in ArcGIS Online\n\nMany of the geoprocessing tools available at ArcGIS Desktop are also available in ArcGIS Online. For example, to look at the most prolific data collectors, we are going to aggregate the number of trees in each fishnet cell and calculate the average diameter at the same time.\n\nTo do this, click on the inverse triangle next to ClemsonTrees. Select Perform Analysis. Expand the Summarize Data section by clicking on it. Choose Aggregate Points and follow these settings:\n\n1. Choose area: Clemson Fishnet 50m\n\n2. Add statistic: Field - Diameter; Statistic - Average. Repeat the same procedure for adding minimum and maximum diameter.\n\n3. Choose filed to group by (leave defaults)\n\n4. Result layer name: Aggregation of ClemsonTrees to Clemson Fishnet by YourInitials.\n\n5. Click RUN ANALYSIS. The aggregation process will start grouping trees by fishnet cell and storing its results in the new aggregation layer. To learn more about this layer, click the inverse triangle next to it and select Show Table. Notice the first field: Count of Points. This is the total number of trees surveyed in that cell. You will also discover the average, minimum and maximum values for all the trees in that cell. It also combined all the attributes from the Fishnet original layer.\n\nTo close the table, click on the X button on the bottom right corner of your screen.\n\nChanging the symbology\n\nLet's look at changing the symbology for your Aggregation layer. Click on the Legend view to understand the current symbology. As you can see, it is using the same color and different sizes depending on the total number of trees within that square. Let's change that based on color as well as size.\n\nReturn to the Content view and click the inverse triangle next to the Aggregation layer. Press Change Style. In the Change Style window, notice the attribute to show is Count of Points. For drawing style, choose the first option: Counts and Amounts (Size), by clicking on OPTIONS. Let's change the symbology to a color ramp, where more trees is darker and bigger and less tress is lighter and smaller.\n\nClick on the Symbols option to the top right. There you can change your base symbol. If you click on Use an Image, you can bring any image or drawing using its URL (for example, open up a browser, do a search for images and type: palmetto tree png clemson). You will see that you can use it as your symbol for this layer. Cancel that so we go back to the previous symbology.\n\nClick on the Legend button on the right. You will see the different classes created for each group of values. Let's change the symbology for the class 1-2. Click on the circle to the left of that class (change symbol). In the window that appears, go to the FILL tab and select the lightest purple at the top of the rectangle, second from the right (#E8BEFF). Click OK. Repeat the same process for each upper class, changing the color to a darker hue in the purple column.\n\nIn the Size section, change the Min to 10px and the Max to 44 pixels.\n\nUncheck the box next to Draw features with out of range or no value. Click OK, then DONE and observe your changes.\n\nPractice changing the symbology of your fauna and your tree layer.\n\nConfiguring the pop-up window\n\nOn your map, click on any of the Aggregation circles. Notice the pop-up window displays all the fields in its attribute table. Not all of this information is necessary in the pop-up window. To change this, click on the inverse triangle next to the Aggregation layer and select Configure Pop-Up. A new window appears where you can customize the contents of the pop-up window for this layer.\n\nPop-up Title is where you change the Title of the window. Change it to \"Tree Collection Summary\"\n\nPop-up Contents is where you can select and format the attributes that get displayed. To change this, click on Configure Attributes. In the new window that appears, do the following:\n\n- Change the Field Alias for:\n\n- Count of Points to \"Total number of trees surveyed\"\n\n- Taken by to \"Collector\"\n\n- Uncheck from Display the following fields: Minimum Diameter, Maximum Diameter, Taken, and GlobalID.\n\nClick OK.\n\nPop-up Media is where you can add images that you collected with your data or charts that read numeric information from your attribute table. Click on the ADD tab and select Column Chart. In the window that appears, add the following:\n\n- Title: Diameter Statistics\n\n- Chart Fields: check Minimum Diameter and Maximum Diameter.\n\nClick OK to save this setting. Click SAVE POP-UP to save all the settings for your configuration window.\n\nCheck out your results.\n\nPractice changing the configuration window for your tree layer and your fauna layer. If you took photos, add them as pop-up media and check out the results!\n\nSaving your map\n\nOn the top menu, click Save - Save.\n\n- Title: Fauna and trees at Clemson by (Your Initials)\n\n- Tags: Clemson, fauna, trees\n\n- Summary: Learning ArcGIS Online at Clemson!\n\nClick SAVE MAP.\n\nCreating your own website\n\nIt is important that you communicate what you have accomplished and learned during this session with your friends, family, and the world! In order to do this, you are going to create your own website using Google Sites using your gmail account. If you don't have a gmail account, open up your browser and type: gmail.com.
