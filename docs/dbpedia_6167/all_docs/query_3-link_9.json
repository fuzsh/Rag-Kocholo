Once the decision to transition from a sole focus on VP-level technology leaders to a C-suite sell was made, exciting new possibilities came into view.\n\nTogether we leveraged the firm’s strong heritage in product development and supply chain consulting to reposition PRTM as the leader in an emerging space they were uniquely qualified to claim: operational strategy. A new North Star positioning statement staked out this valuable high ground, declaring PRTM “the premier operational strategy firm, delivering operational innovations that change markets.”\n\nThe hardest thing about re-positioning a longstanding business like PRTM is getting leadership to see the company in a new light. You need to convince them that the brand has earned permission to stand for more than it did in the past. That team tends to be their own worst critic."
