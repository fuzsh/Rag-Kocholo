        "text": "The coronavirus quickly made the high-touch in-person model used for insurance in the past untenable. Traffk's AI-assisted data analysis identifies optimized risk opportunities that get missed by those not using the latest insurance technology, and it is ideal for insurance during COVID. AI assisted reinsurance can help increase profits, by doing the necessary calculations to aid insurers analytical capabilities.(2)\n\n\"Technology is changing the way insurance companies do business to make it better for the end-users, whether they are prepared for that change or not,\" says Helms. \"Traffk is leading that necessary change.\"\n\nAbout JOTO PR Disruptors ™\n\nAfter doing marketing research on a cross-section majority of 5,000 CEOs of fast-growth trajectory companies and finding out exactly how they used PR, how they measure it and how they wanted the PR industry to be different, PR veteran and innovator Karla Jo Helms created JoTo PR™ and established its entire business model on those research findings. Astute in recognizing industry changes since its launch in 2009, JoTo PRTM's team utilizes newly established patterns to create timely PR campaigns comprising both traditional and the latest proven media methods. This unique skill enables them to continue to increase the market share and improve return on investment (ROI) for their clients, year after year—beating usual industry standards. Based in Tampa Bay, Florida, JoTo PRTM is an established international public relations agency. Today, all processes of JOTO are streamlined PR services that have become the hallmark of the JoTo PR™ name.
