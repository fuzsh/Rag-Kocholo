        "text": "\"DS9 Capital are problem solvers,\" Karla Jo Helms, Chief Evangelist and Anti-PRTM Strategist for JoTo PR said. \"And by focusing on funding founders with less than $2M in profit, start-ups, and small business that want to digitize or rebrand, they are embodying the disruptive approach that our new economy is all about.\"\n\nThe larger goal when it comes to creating a new economy aligns with JoTo's mission—to make a significant impact on the economy and positively disrupt the entire news industry by helping businesses take control of their narratives and utilize the news to expand markets and commerce.\n\nThe disparity between the millions of dollars big legacy Venture Capital/Private Equity firms invest versus the smaller businesses is representative of a huge disconnect in the investment world. Despite being smaller, SMBs still have solid business plans and prove to be economically successful. However, without the benefit of an infusion of investment cash, too many SMBs may never reach their full potential. DS9's mission is to help these smaller companies overcome that stumbling block.\n\nThere is little doubt that small businesses play a vital role in the economy of the United States and the world economy. In the U.S. alone, small businesses represent 99.9% of all businesses.(4) According to the World Trade Organization, the U.S. is not the only economy built on SMBs. More than 90% of the business population, 60-70% of employment, and 55% of gross domestic product (GDP) in developed economies around the globe are comprised of small- to medium-sized companies.(5) Simply put, all the world is built on and dependent upon the success of smaller businesses.\n\nHaving a communication strategy that will disrupt the status quo to reach these small businesses so they are aware of new opportunities is essential. JoTo PR's Anti-PRTM approach addresses this need by showcasing how DS9's innovative technique will disrupt the investment industry. This community has been wary of the perceived risks associated with investing in many SMBs. DS9 is prepared to capitalize on investment opportunities that for decades were considered \"small potatoes.\" Through JoTo PR, DS9 Capital will zero in on today's hyper-connected network society—the new media, influencers, and content creators disrupting the way to reach the super-targeted audiences that antiquated, traditional firms have eschewed for years.\n\n\"Financial innovators like DS9 Capital are giving attention and opportunity to smaller businesses that represent the true fabric of America,\" Helms says. \"Just as the old model of PR is outdated, the old model in venture capital is outdated, and DS9 is addressing that.\"\n\nAbout JOTO PR Disruptors(TM):\n\nAfter doing marketing research on a cross-section majority of 5,000 CEOs of fast-growth trajectory companies and finding out exactly how they used PR, how they measure it, and how they wanted the PR industry to be different, PR veteran and innovator Karla Jo Helms created JoTo PR(TM) and established its entire business model on those research findings. Astute in recognizing industry changes since its launch in 2009, JoTo PR's team utilizes newly established patterns to create timely Anti-PR(TM) campaigns comprising both traditional and the latest proven media methods. This unique skill enables them to continue to increase the market share and improve return on investment (ROI) for their clients, year after year—beating usual industry standards. Based in Tampa Bay, Florida, JoTo PR is an established international public relations agency. Today, all processes of JoTo are streamlined Anti-PR services that have become the hallmark of the JoTo PR name.
