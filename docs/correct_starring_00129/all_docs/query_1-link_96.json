        "text": "Sometimes actors have great chemistry on screen, but don't get along great in real life. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling fought a lot while filming The Notebook. During the original run of The X-Files, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson had a very cold relationship. And rumor has it while shooting The Lion King, Timon and Pumbaa hated each other's guts.\n\nIt's nice to see that actors remain friends, years after they last worked with each other. And one of the best on-screen friendships in recent memory was between Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in Superbad. Eleven years ago, they starred in the classic coming-of-age teen comedy, about two guys who want to lose their virginities before they graduate. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wrote the movie when they were teenagers, and named the two main characters after themselves. Originally, Seth was going to play the character Seth, but by the time the movie got greenlit, he was too old, so they cast Jonah Hill. At the time, Michael Cera was 18, and Jonah Hill was 23.\n\nIn an interview, Jonah Hill spoke about the whirlwind experience of being cast:\n\n\"They were casting Superbad while we were filming [Knocked Up] and couldn't figure out who would play opposite Michael Cera. Judd looked at me one day and said, 'Jonah-shave. Here's a camcorder. Read this scene with Seth Rogen.' We shot it right there in Seth's trailer, and I got the part.\n\n\"It happened in 20 minutes. It was crazy. Within literally three seconds my agents and everyone started calling me. If those guys need me, I'm there. They've been there for me as people. I support them in whatever they do. They are just guys who work hard, have so much talent and are good people, and that's rare.\"\n\nEleven years later, the two actors remain friends. Recently Jonah Hill and Michael Cera were spotted walking together in Tribeca, a trendy neighborhood in New York City. Michael, 29, is wearing a Canada Goose jacket, sunglasses and an orange stocking cap. Jonah, 34, is smoking a cigarette, wearing jeans, a green stocking cap and one of those weird hipster coats. But considering the area, they probably blend right in.\n\nThe movie catapulted both actors into stardom. Michael Cera starred in a ton of comedies, like Juno and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. And Jonah has successfully transitioned to Oscar-nominated movies like Moneyball and The Wolf Of Wall Street. But while their careers have diverged a bit, the bond created from shooting Superbad will last a lifetime. In an interview describing the experience, Jonah said, \"Michael and I had an arranged marriage all summer. We would hang out at my apartment, go to Canter's. We played video games, macked on girls at the mall.\" Now maybe they're 'macking on girls' at Tribeca.\n\nThere's no sign of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, though. Why didn't you guys invite McLovin'?\n\nSometimes actors have great chemistry on screen, but don't get along great in real life.
