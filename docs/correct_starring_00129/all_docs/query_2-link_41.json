        "text": "Baby-faced Michael Cera is one of the most sought-after young actors in Hollywood after starring in the hit films Superbad and Juno. But the 20-year-old, who grew up in Brampton, Ont., insists fame hasn't changed his life all that much.\n\n\"Same friends, same family, same clothes, same car, same house,\" Cera said Saturday while promoting his new movie, Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\"People just, you know, people feel like they know you … that's the only difference.\"\n\nThe sandy-haired actor (who drives a Toyota Corolla, by the way) is being typically modest.\n\nHe's earned legions of female fans since breaking out on the big screen, including one who boldly proposed to him during a news conference last year at pop culture convention Comic-con.\n\n\"That's it, that's the only way [life has changed],\" the soft-spoken Cera insisted of the random marriage offer.\n\nNick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, which hits theatres on Oct. 3, is a comedy about two teens (played by Cera and Kat Dennings) who unite over their love of music during an overnight adventure with their pals on Manhattan's indie rock scene.\n\nWith co-stars including fellow Canuck Jay Baruchel, cameos from Saturday Night Live stars Seth Meyers and Andy Samberg and a soundtrack packed with indie acts, the film is sure to please many teens and fans of sweet and smart romantic comedies.\n\nBut is it the Juno of this year's Toronto film festival?\n\nIt's a question on the minds of many who saw the teen pregnancy flick at last year's fest and watched it go on to earn four Oscar nominations, ultimately winning a best screenplay trophy for Diablo Cody.\n\nCera, dressed remarkably like his onscreen characters — in a canary yellow T-shirt, navy blue pants and carrying a bright red retro knapsack — says he doesn't see a connection between the two films.\n\n\"I think it's a totally different thing and I don't associate them,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, I don't know. I hope the movie's good and people like it. I think it's irrelevant how much glory it goes on to — to me anyway. To some people I guess that's everything but I just hope it's something I'm happy with. I mean, I loved working on it and I loved the experience.\"\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, but removes much of the book's boozing, drugging and swearing.\n\nDirector Peter Sollett called himself \"an extraordinarily lucky director\" to have the Canadian star in his movie.\n\n\"He's an amazing improvisational comedian who did a lot of improvisation on the film,\" said New York-born Sollett, who made his directing debut with Raising Victor Vargas.\n\n\"[Cera] just makes wonderful things all the time, so I'm very lucky to have him.\""
