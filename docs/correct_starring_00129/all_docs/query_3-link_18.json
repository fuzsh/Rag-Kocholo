        "text": "The feature film “Sacramento,” currently being shot in Sacramento, is wrapping up its final week of production.\n\nKristen Stewart, Michael Cera and Michael Angarano star in the movie about two friends’ road trip to Sacramento. Angarano wrote the script and is also directing the movie.\n\nThe movie centers around Rickey (Angarano), an energetic and free-spirited young man who convinces Glenn (Cera), his long-time friend who’s settled into domestic life, to go on an impromptu road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento, according to the films IMDb page.\n\nThe City of Sacramento’s Film + Media Office worked with the production to secure locations and permits. The office also served as a liaison with neighborhoods and coordinated other details including parking, security and street closures.\n\n“I’m thrilled that Michael Angarano chose to film part of his film in Sacramento,” said Sacramento Film Commissioner Jennifer West. “With a wonderful cast and script, this movie is sure to bring Sacramento attention the likes of ‘Lady Bird.’ Independent films like this can have a large impact on the local community and tourism.”\n\nThe movie has brought in $100,000 to the region in hotels, local hires, van rentals and catering, West said.\n\n“Sacramento” has shot scenes in Old Sacramento, Gunther’s Ice Cream shop, East Sacramento and R Street Corridor and downtown.\n\nA release date for the film has yet to be announced."
