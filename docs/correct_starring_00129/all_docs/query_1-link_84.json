        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Amidst one of the most creatively fertile periods in his career to date, actor Michael Cera has taken on new agents at CAA.\n\nThe in-demand Canadian actor is coming off of a standout role in Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s triumphant live-action take on the Mattel doll for Warner Bros, which has thus far grossed over $1.4B worldwide and seems likely to figure heavily in the awards race to come.\n\nIn addition to the highest-grossing film of the year, the fantasy comedy penned by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach has set records as the top-grossing title ever released by Warner Bros, and the highest-grossing film from a solo female director. Starring alongside Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Cera portrayed Allan, the lovably awkward best friend of Ken who, unlike the central characters, has no counterpart in his universe.\n\nAlso recently making a memorable appearance on Black Mirror and starring in the experimental sci-fi comedy webseries Command Z for Steven Soderbergh, the comedic talent will next be seen starring opposite Nicolas Cage in Dream Scenario, the surreal A24 comedy produced by Ari Aster’s Square Peg, which broke out of Toronto as one of the buzziest titles of the fall season. That film, marking the English-language debut of Norway’s Kristoffer Borgli, about a man who one day finds himself invading the dreams of others, hits theaters November 10th.\n\nCera additionally co-stars with Amy Schumer in Hulu’s Life & Beth, which has been renewed for a second season, there portraying the love interest of the comedian. He broke out as part of the all-star cast of Mitchell Hurwitz’s sitcom Arrested Development, before going on to much greater recognition via films like Superbad and Juno. Additional film credits include Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Youth in Revolt, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, This Is the End, Sausage Party, and The Lego Batman Movie, to name just a few.\n\nCera continues to be represented by Thruline Entertainment and Jamie Feldman at Lichter, Grossman, Nichols."
