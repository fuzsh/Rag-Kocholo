        "text": "Lovable loser Michael Cera is getting dolled up for the new “Barbie” movie, in which he’ll portray a discontinued and long-forgotten character in the toy line.\n\nThe Brampton, Ont. actor, known for roles in “Superbad” and “Arrested Development,” has been announced as part of the extended cast for the summer comedy, playing a role simply known as “Allan.”\n\n“Barbie” is a spin on the popular children’s toy franchise with Margot Robbie in the titular role and London, Ont.-born Ryan Gosling as Ken.\n\n“Kim’s Convenience” actor Simu Liu, who was raised in Mississauga, Ont., plays another version of Ken who clashes with Gosling’s Ken in the latest trailer released Tuesday.\n\nWhile the specifics of Cera’s character haven’t been revealed, a discontinued Barbie character named Allan was introduced in the 1960s.\n\nThe red-haired Allan was marketed as Ken’s “buddy” who was dressed in a beach jacket and swimming trunks. He could also fit into Ken’s clothes.\n\nAllan was introduced during an expansion of the Barbie product line, which included the addition of Barbie’s sister Skipper and best friend Midge, who is Allan’s girlfriend.\n\nThe Allan dolls were sold for a few years before toy manufacturer Mattel replaced him with a new character named Brad.\n\nOther cast members newly confirmed include pop singer Dua Lipa as mermaid Barbie, Issa Rae as president Barbie and Kate McKinnon as rock star Barbie.\n\n“Barbie,” directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig, arrives in theatres July 21.\n\n—David Friend, The Canadian Press"
