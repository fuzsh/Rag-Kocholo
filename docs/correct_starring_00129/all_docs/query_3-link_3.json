        "text": "Canadian actor Michael Cera made his first major impact on American comedy audiences with his role as teenager George Michael Bluth who, at first blush, seemed the most normal of the terminally dysfunctional Bluth clan, on the cult TV comedy \"Arrested Development\" (Fox, 2003-06). As the series unfolded, however, his character's burning and inappropriate crush on his own cousin proved the actor's willingness to explore the most uncomfortable comic situations imaginable, and paved the way for future film roles as painfully awkward types. Cera's first leading film role was the broad comedy \"Superbad\" (2007), which paired him to great success with Jonah Hill as a pair of teenage outcasts. Following major critical kudos for the surprising indie breakout \"Juno\" (2007), Cera had officially arrived as a new kind of dry-witted comic lead. He further cemented his growing reputation as a Gen-Y Woody Allen in projects like \"Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist\" (2008), although such disappointments as \"Year One\" (2009) and \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" (2010) took some of the shine off his glowing résumé. His return to \"Arrested Development\" (Netflix, 2013- ), however, gave fans of the actor cause to celebrate and portended a second act to his still-young career. Clearly more than a comedic flash-in-the-pan, Cera was a talent whose true range had yet to be explored in any number of mediums and genres."
