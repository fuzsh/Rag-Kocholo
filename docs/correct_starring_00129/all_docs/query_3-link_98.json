        "text": "Michael Cera has been announced to star in a new sci-fi series from director Steven Soderbergh.\n\nCommand Z sees the actor take on the role of a project leader in the future who sends three people (Roy Wood Jr., Chloe Radcliffe and J.J. Maley) back to 2023 to infiltrate the minds of a number of people and change the course of the future.\n\nThe series, which sees Soderbergh direct and produce, is available to watch now on the director’s website Extension765 – which also has a trailer.\n\nCommand Z has also been promoted with a meta letter written by a likely fictional character called Fabrizia del Dongo, which confirms it consists of eight episodes and runs for a total of 90 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This very morning, our fearful leader explained that in three days (July 17th for those who don’t want to do the math) we will be ‘dropping’ a series of some sort called COMMAND Z,” it begins.\n\n“If I seem hedgy, it’s because A) None of us have seen it; and B) it’s apparently about ninety minutes long, but there are eight episodes of varying length, so is it an actual series or just a movie cut up into pieces?”\n\nRecommended\n\nIt adds of the secrecy of the project: “When I asked Mr/Dr Soderbergh why he’d done this, why he’d made this project and why he’d made it in secret, he said, ‘Hope, Fabrizia. Hope and laughter.’ Honestly, I don’t even know where to start with this guy.”\n\nAs well as the aforementioned stars, Command Z will also see Liev Schrieber appear, while the series has been written by Kurt Andersen, according to The Playlist."
