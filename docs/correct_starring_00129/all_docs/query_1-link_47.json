        "text": "Let's go back to a simpler time in the history of the humble comedy. 2007. Five years after Jackass: The Movie. Two before The Hangover. Which laugh-fest punctuated that year, you ask?\n\nSuperbad. The film that flipped the nerds-go-to-a-party-and-get-fucked-up on its head, introducing most of us to the likes of Jonah Hill, Emma Stone, and Michael Cera. 15 (!) years later, we're all still clamoring for the now-famous trio to return to their roles. (Hell, don't forget that Bill Hader and Seth Rogen showed up in this movie too.) Earlier this year, Hill revealed his pitch for Superbad 2. “What I want to do is, when we’re like 80, do a Superbad 2. Like, old-folks-home Superbad,’” Hill told W. “Our spouses die, and we’re single again. That’s what I want Superbad 2 to be, and that’s the only way I would ever make it.”\n\nHow does Cera feel? Thanks to our new \"Explain This\" interview, we know that the actor isn't as hot on returning to his dweeby alter ego as his co-star. We'll break the news to you up front: it's not gonna happen. \"I mean, I would be open to just doing anything with that group of people,\" he said. \"I think that everybody is pretty staunchly against this, just because we feel good about the movie. It could only tarnish something that is a good memory. That said, I would just love to do something with the same group of people, even if it's not Superbad.\" Listen, if not getting Superbad 2 means we'll get another Cera-Hill-Stone team-up, we'll take it.\n\nYou can watch the full \"Explain This\" interview above, where Cera talks about Arrested Development, his music career, and his new Hulu series with Amy Schumer, Life & Beth.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
