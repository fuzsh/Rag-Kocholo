        "text": "Watch the trailer for Superbad (2007)\n\nJonah Hill “immediately hated” his Superbad co-star Christopher Mintz-Plasse - and told the film’s co-writer that he simply “couldn’t perform with that guy” as he was “f***ing with my rhythm”.\n\nSeth recalled the actors’ squabbles 15 years after the iconic movie hit screens in a roundtable with Vanity Fair and other pivotal members of Superbad’s cast and crew.\n\nExecutive producer Judd Apatow added that Jonah’s dislike for Christopher was rooted in the 17-year-old’s “very caustic” personality and claimed he “attacked Jonah” with insulting improv during his third callback.\n\nJonah became adamant that he didn’t want Christopher on the movie, but this just furthered Judd’s resolve.\n\nThe founder of Apatow Productions declared: “I said; ‘That’s exactly why we’re hiring him. It couldn’t be more perfect. The fact that it bothers you is exactly what we want’.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Jonah Hill has spent nearly two decades 'experiencing anxiety attacks' [LATEST]\n\nChristopher on the other hand seemingly didn’t hold back on his auditions as he simply felt he would never get the role.\n\nSuperbad was the actor’s very first movie role and he recalled asking Seth to sign his script at the auditions because he thought he wouldn’t be back.\n\nLooking back now, Jonah admitted that Christopher got under his skin simply because he was “really amazing off the bat”, which he found quite “annoying at the time”.\n\nDespite their earlier scruples, Jonah and Christopher would go on to work together on a myriad of other shows and movies over the years, including more box office hits like How to Train Your Dragon and This Is The End.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nJaney Godley gives update on incurable cancer as celebrity pals send support [LATEST]\n\nPrince Harry set to ‘take step back’ from spotlight of Meghan's showbiz world [LATEST]\n\nEmmy win could catapult Meghan and Harry to new heights [LATEST]\n\nHarry appears 'ill-suited and uncomfortable' with showbiz life, expert says [LATEST]\n\nAnton du Beke swaps Strictly for DIY as he joins Nick Knowles for big project [LATEST]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m not! I can do this with makeup and hair’.”\n\nDetermined to prove his point, the actor taped himself doing some scenes using every tool at his disposal to visibly look younger.\n\nThe tape instantly made it clear to the filmmakers that he “should’ve been cast a long time ago”, with Judd declaring it “ridiculous” that they thought they would find another actor to fit the role like Jonah had."
