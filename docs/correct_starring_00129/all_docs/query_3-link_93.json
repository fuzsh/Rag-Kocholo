So what's it gonna be?\n\nI am McLovin.\n\nYah.\n\nNo, you're not. No one's McLovin.\n\nMcLovin's never existed\n\n'cause that's a made up dumb fuckin' fairytale name,\n\nyou fuck!\n\nWhen we made the movie,\n\nI think it cost like $20-million to make\n\nand so it didn't feel like a small movie to me.\n\nI mean, it already felt\n\nlike the biggest thing that had ever happened to me,\n\njust getting the job\n\nand getting to make it,\n\nso it kind of felt to me\n\nlike a bit of a given\n\nthat it would be a big movie\n\nor else it would've been a big failure.\n\nIt was so popular\n\nand I was so recognizable suddenly,\n\nand so were all of us,\n\nand it's a strange adjustment to make,\n\nyou know,\n\nbut it was kind of helpful to do it all together\n\nand we sort of just had our heads down\n\nand were going on this giant press tour\n\nand it all just felt like this big,\n\nyou know, tumble dry cycle of craziness.\n\nIt was helpful to go through it together\n\nand figure it out as we went.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World.\n\n[acoustic guitar music]\n\n♪ Ramona ♪\n\n♪ Ramona ♪\n\n♪ On my mind ♪\n\n♪ Ramona ♪\n\nCan't wait to hear it when it's finished.\n\nI was such a fan of Edgar's\n\nfrom Spaced and Shaun of the Dead\n\nand Hot Fuzz.\n\nWell, Edgar actually had visited the set\n\nof Arrested Development\n\nand was friends with, I think,\n\nwith David and Jason and Will,\n\nand I didn't get a chance to meet him when he came\n\nand I was kind of disappointed.\n\nBut when I, just,\n\nyou know, when Edgar reached out,\n\nwhen I was even just in contact with him,\n\nI was really excited because I was a big fan.\n\nI knew he was incredibly talented.\n\nIt was exciting to me.\n\nIt was sort of like too good to be true\n\nbecause I also loved the graphic novels.\n\nIt just felt\n\nfortunate to be the right age,\n\nthe right time.\n\nYeah.

Fight!\n\n[Matthew yelling]\n\n[video game sounds]\n\n[fist landing]\n\n[video game sounds]\n\nIt was so much fun.\n\nIt was a long shoot, I think.\n\nI mean, for me in particular,\n\nbecause other people kind of came and went, you know?\n\nBut I was there for, I think, nine months or something,\n\nwhich is an enormous amount of time\n\nto work on something.\n\nBut it was so much fun all the time\n\nbecause we just had the greatest vibe with everybody.\n\nI think that basically trickled down from Edgar\n\nand the energy that he was creating\n\nand we all got to rehearse together\n\nand spend a lot of time together\n\nbefore we even started making the movie.\n\nBy the end of the movie,\n\nI felt like, This is my world.\n\nThis is my group of friends.\n\nIt kind of feels like,\n\nOh, it's always gonna be this way.\n\nAnd honestly,\n\nI kind of was a little depressed\n\nwhen we were done\n\nbecause\n\nit all,\n\nyou know, it all just goes away,\n\nand you're like, Where did everybody go?\n\nYou know?\n\nSo you kind of get used to that as you get older\n\nand as you're acting for a while.\n\nBut I was sad to lose it.\n\nI could have kept making that forever,\n\neven though it was exhausting.\n\n[energetic music]\n\n[Scott grunting]\n\n[coins falling]\n\n[energetic music]\n\n[coins falling]\n\n[video game sounds]\n\nWe were kind of doing endurance training\n\nmore than anything,\n\nmore than bodybuilding or something.\n\nAnd fight training,\n\nyou know, choreography,\n\nwhich is just so unnatural to me\n\nand sometimes hurt.\n\nThere were a couple times where I got hurt.\n\nLike I...\n\nJust even blocking a kick,\n\ntrying to block over and over\n\nand find the right point in space to put your hand.\n\nAnd one time I just went too low\n\nand received the full blow of this guy's kick,\n\none of the stuntmen\n\nwho was just kicking at a point in air,\n\nand it's an insane feeling\n\nyou can't believe is happening in your hand.\n\nLike you didn't know\n\nthat you had these muscles in your hand.\n\nNow they're throbbing\n\nfor like a week.\n\nLike a train hit me in the hand, you know?\n\nVery weird.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nArrested Development.\n\nThe thing is that the year before Arrested Development,\n\nI had done a sitcom that never aired\n\ncalled The Grubbs,\n\nwhich was a Fox multi-cam sitcom\n\nstarring Randy Quaid and Carol Kane.\n\nYou know, it was sort of,\n\nit just didn't,\n\nit never aired.\n\nWe shot eight episodes of it.\n\nIt was maybe sort of formulaic,\n\nlike family,\n\ndysfunctional family sitcom.\n\nIt was really funny.\n\nIt was written by really funny writers,\n\nbut it was sort of situational\n\nand I was playing sort of a stock teenage part, maybe.\n\nAnd then when I got the role in Arrested Development\n\nand had this whole storyline\n\nthat was really insane\n\nof being in love with my,\n\nsecretly in love with my first cousin...\n\nI should go to my mom tonight\n\nand be like, I met the cutest guy.\n\nAnd then she'll see you and me totally making out.\n\nYeah. [George laughs]\n\nBut not really, right?\n\nI just remember being really grateful as a kid\n\nto have such a strange through-line storyline\n\nin a show as a kid.\n\nBecause I feel like teenage roles in TV shows\n\nare sort of stock\n\nand you don't get too much to sink your teeth into\n\nother than being precocious or being whatever.\n\nSo I was excited about that,\n\nand saw a lot of humor in it and, you know,\n\nI just thought it was always really so funnily handled\n\nthat Jason Bateman is just completely oblivious to it.\n\nYou stay on top of her, buddy.\n\nDo not be afraid to ride her.\n\nHard.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI was just so excited\n\nto be a part of such a great troupe of actors, too,\n\nand be around these people all the time.\n\nIt was the greatest thing.\n\nDo you know the last time\n\nthat I made love to my wife?\n\nNo.\n\nI'll tell you when. No, don't.\n\nSee, nothing has ever been easy for us.\n\nI mean, the only reason she went out with me\n\nwas to piss off her boyfriend.\n\nThe only reason she ever married me\n\nwas to piss off her mother.\n\nAnd then, of course, we couldn't conceive.\n\nSo there was that famous ordeal.\n\nWhat do you mean you couldn't conceive?\n\n[phone ringing] Was Maeby adopted?\n\nIs she not really related to me?\n\nIs she just some girl I know?\n\nI was really excited\n\nwhen they started writing\n\nsort of these side storylines\n\nthat involved myself and David Cross,\n\nlike having one-on-one scenes together,\n\nbecause I loved David\n\nand I worshiped David, actually,\n\nbefore ever getting to meet him\n\nor work with him.\n\n'Cause I watched Mr. Show growing up.\n\nWhere I grew up,\n\nevery Friday night there was The Tom Green Show\n\nand Mr. Show\n\nslotted as an hour,\n\nand me and my friend watched it,\n\nlike, religiously.\n\nSo when I heard David was potentially gonna be in the pilot,\n\nI was incredibly excited.\n\nAnd then they started writing scenes\n\nwith David and I,\n\nwhen he becomes kind of my roommate.\n\nWe're sharing the bunk bed at some point\n\nin one of the earlier seasons.\n\nAnd those were always so much fun to film\n\nand really hard for me to keep it together.\n\nI have to wear it all the time.\n\nYou'd never understand.\n\nOh, please.\n\nI'll never un...\n\nI'll never understand?\n\nThat you can never be nude?\n\n[robe hits floor]\n\nI understand more than you'll\n\nnever know.\n\nYeah, it was completely intimidating.\n\nThey were completely encouraging\n\nand supportive with me and Alia,\n\nwho's my cousin on the show,\n\nwho, you know, we were the two children on the show.\n\nAnd it's like,\n\nit just is intimidating\n\nbecause they're all operating\n\non this insanely high level of intellect\n\nand humor\n\nand they're so fast\n\nand they're so brilliant.\n\nBut even though it was intimidating,\n\nI feel like we just benefited enormously\n\nby getting to be around it and soak them up\n\nand be part of it, and just,\n\nyou know, be part of the fun\n\nthat they were creating.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nBarbie.\n\nIt was a kind of very last-minute casting.\n\nMy manager got a call\n\nchecking on my availability for it.\n\nAnd he called me and he said,\n\nI got a call about this movie.\n\nIt's the Barbie movie.\n\nGreta Gerwig's directing it\n\nand it's filming in London\n\nfor, you know, four months or something.\n\nSo I told them you probably wouldn't want to do it\n\n'cause you probably don't want to go to London.\n\n[Michael laughs] I was like, What?!\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nCall them back.\n\nI mean, he didn't, like,\n\nblow it or anything,\n\nbut he's like,\n\nI managed their expectations\n\nthat you might not wanna do it.\n\nAnd I was like, How can I not do it?\n\nI need to do it.\n\nSo I somehow got Greta's email address,\n\nI think through a common friend of ours,\n\nand I emailed her.\n\nI was like, Can I be,\n\n[Michael laughs] Can I do that part?\n\nAnd she was like, Let's get on a Zoom right now.\n\nHere's a Zoom link.\n\nI'll be on there for the next hour.\n\nSo she was just hanging out on the Zoom.\n\nShe's like, Just click that link whenever you're ready.\n\nAnd then we talked about it\n\nand it just all happened really fast from there.\n\nHi, Barbie.\n\nOh, hi, Allan.\n\n[Narrator] There are no multiples of Allan.\n\nHe's just Allan.\n\nYeah, I'm,\n\nI'm confused about that.\n\nI mean, Allan is\n\na sad, you know,\n\nfigure.\n\nHe's just a person\n\nthat just doesn't really have any place in the world.\n\nYou know, Allan is actually based on a real doll\n\nthat enjoyed a very short production run, I think,\n\nin, like, the year 1967.\n\nIt just wasn't selling.\n\nI think the world just didn't need\n\nfor Ken to have a friend,\n\nlike, to supplement that wing of the collection.\n\nIt was like,\n\nBarbie is good.\n\nWe can get a lot more Barbies in here\n\nand friends of hers,\n\nbut we've got Ken\n\nand we don't need to go deeper in that direction.\n\nHe can hold it down.\n\nSo Allan kind of,\n\nyou know,\n\nfell by the wayside a little bit.\n\nHonestly, there's been so much anticipation for the movie\n\never since it was even,\n\nwe even started working on it.\n\nI think it's just very infectious.\n\nMaybe there's just something in the world right now\n\nthat people are ready for a Barbie movie.\n\nThey just,\n\nit feels like just the right time\n\nto have a Barbie movie.\n\nI mean, even on the set,\n\neverything was very infectious.\n\nEverybody was wearing pink shoelaces and everything\n\nand it was fun.\n\nIt was a good spirit right from the start.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nJuno.\n\nWhat should we do?\n\nWell, you know, I was just,\n\nI was thinking I'd just nip it in the bud\n\nbefore it gets worse\n\nbecause they were talking about in health class\n\nhow pregnancy,\n\nit can often lead to an infant.\n\nTypically, yeah. Yeah.\n\nThat's what happens\n\nwhen our moms and teachers get pregnant.\n\nWhen I read the script the first time,\n\nthe thing that really grabs you\n\nis the rhythm of it and the dialogue.\n\nSo you're cool with that then?\n\nYeah. Yeah. Wizard.\n\nI mean, you know,\n\njust, I guess,\n\ndo whatever you think you should do, you know?\n\nIt's very distinct in its voice, you know,\n\nwhich I think Diablo Cody\n\nhas kind of made her,\n\nyou know, her hallmark in a way.\n\nBut I don't think anybody knew who she was when,\n\nyou know, that script came out of nowhere\n\nand she just kind of wrote it\n\nin a sandwich shop or something\n\nand really carved this voice\n\nout of nothing.\n\nAnd I think actually she had a blog\n\nthat she was kind of a little famous for at the time.\n\nBut, yeah,\n\nreading it for the first time,\n\nthat's just the thing that really knocks you out\n\nis kind of the voice,\n\nthe voice of it.\n\nI think I'm in love with you.\n\nYou mean as friends?\n\nNo.\n\nI mean for real.\n\n'Cause you're, like,\n\nthe coolest person I've ever met\n\nand you don't even have to try,\n\nyou know?\n\nI try really hard, actually.\n\nI remember when the movie came out,\n\nthere was some,\n\nI dunno,\n\npromotional effort\n\nthat involved a bunch of guys\n\ndressed in those track\n\nsuits\n\nor the running, you know, outfit,\n\nrunning around Hollywood in a cluster,\n\nwhich was just,\n\nyou know, kind of funny and uncanny.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nNick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.\n\nThe thing that most drew me to it\n\nwas Pete Sollett,\n\nwho directed it.\n\nHe had made this incredible movie, Raising Victor Vargas.\n\nIt was stunningly great, that movie,\n\nand I just wanted to do anything with him.\n\nAnd then there was an amazing script\n\nby Lorene Scarfaria, who,\n\nyeah, had adapted it from the book\n\nbut did this great job\n\nwith the script.\n\nSo it just felt like it was gonna be good.\n\nSo that's it, Tris.\n\nThe breakup mix.\n\nTen songs from my broken...\n\nThat's not even real.\n\nCan we go straight to laughing about this?\n\nI have to pee.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt was a month or longer\n\nof night shoots,\n\nwhich is,\n\nyou know, strange,\n\nlike,\n\nstrange biological experience,\n\nsleeping with the sun up\n\nand garbage trucks going by\n\nand life outside your window,\n\nand not sleeping very well.\n\nBut I was,\n\nI think, 19 when I made that movie,\n\nhaving the greatest time.\n\n'Cause we would wrap at like 6:00 AM\n\nand then we would go get soup at Veselka\n\nor go, you know, hang out.\n\nHonestly, it's probably the reason I live in New York today\n\nbecause I really fell in love with the city\n\nand the feeling of just wandering through it\n\nand how alive it is\n\nand how generous it is\n\nas far as like a texture of life.\n\nYou just,\n\nthere's just always something of interest\n\nhappening all over the place\n\nand sometimes you have to guard yourself against it.\n\nIt can be a lot.\n\nBut, like, I was just so drawn to it.\n\nI got this.\n\nHey.\n\nWhat's up, friend? How you doing?\n\nHey, I was just gonna go in the...\n\nHey. You walked right in here, didn't you, little bird?\n\nI didn't mean to.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYou're like a little canary in skinny jeans, huh?\n\nWell, I was gonna go in there\n\njust to look for my friend.\n\nOh. You got friends right here.\n\nMe and Switzerland are here for you, baby.\n\nHey, thanks for coming by.\n\nLet me ask you a question.\n\nYou ever hook up with a dog?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat? Like an...\n\nA dog, like a pet?\n\nNo.\n\nDon't.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nI like you so much.\n\nI'm running away.\n\nWith that era,\n\nthere's like,\n\nthere was like a studio independent movie genre almost,\n\nwhere they weren't really independent.\n\nI mean, you know,\n\nthey were financed by studios\n\nand they cost a lot of money,\n\nbut they sort of are labeled independent.\n\nThere's sort of a flavor,\n\nlike a lane that they found,\n\na genre\n\nor something.\n\nIt seems like it's gone.\n\nI mean, it seems like it's an era\n\nwhere that model doesn't work anymore,\n\nwhere movies being made at that level\n\nor at that budget\n\nthat aren't, you know, superhero movies\n\nor something that will be guaranteed to have an audience -\n\nit just seems like\n\na sort of relic of that time.\n\nI'm not sure if it'll come back,\n\nbut a $10-million movie or something,\n\nyou know, which used to be kind of normal\n\nto get made,\n\nand now,\n\nI don't think they're being made anymore.\n\nI think you either make, now,\n\na very small movie\n\nthat we can go make with this crew\n\nor a giant movie.\n\nSo it's a little weird.\n\nIt's changed.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nThis Is The End.\n\nHey. What's going on?\n\nHey, does this coke smell funny?\n\nOh, fuck, Michael!\n\nFuck!\n\n[both yelling]\n\nSome shit, motherfucker.\n\nI've never fucking done cocaine, dude!\n\nWell, you did the best shit possible for your first time.\n\n'Cause that's good...\n\nI'm not sure whose idea it was.\n\nI guess it was Seth and Evan.\n\nAnd, you know,\n\nthe thing that was,\n\nwas hugely beneficial for me\n\non that movie\n\nwas that I kind kind of came in late.\n\nThey had been shooting\n\nand they'd been shooting that house party sequence\n\nin particular\n\nfor, you know,\n\nat least a week or so\n\nbefore I got in.\n\nI kind of had to come in late\n\n'cause I was just finishing another job.\n\nSo when I got there,\n\nthey filled me in\n\non what everybody had been saying about me.\n\nThey had all been kind of describing me,\n\ncreating a character, really,\n\nfor me to step into.\n\nAnd so they told me all that,\n\nwhich was hilarious.\n\nAnd then it was really just all there for me.\n\nI just have to live up to what they're saying.\n\nI have to be weird.\n\n[Michael laughs]\n\nSo that was,\n\nyeah.\n\n[slap lands]\n\n[slap lands] [Michael exclaims]\n\n[Jason] That's not cool.\n\nDon't touch my butt.\n\nMichael, that's not cool, man.\n\nFuck off, Jason. We're playing a game, man.\n\nYeah, I mean she definitely hit me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I really,\n\nI wanted that, you know.\n\nI mean,\n\nI think it's a lot funnier\n\nand a lot more convincing.\n\nI mean, a fake slap just doesn't look good.\n\nSo she hit me hard.\n\nI mean, yeah,\n\nshe really sent me flying,\n\nand it was great.\n\nAnd now it's\n\non film forever,\n\nthis pain that I experienced.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nTwin Peaks.\n\nLook who's here.\n\nIt's Wally.\n\nWe're so excited. He came in unannounced.\n\nGood to see you again, Wally.\n\nIt's good to see you too, Sheriff Truman.\n\nAs you know,\n\nyour brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather.\n\nWell, the full story, actually,\n\nis that I met David Lynch,\n\nI don't know,\n\na year or two earlier\n\nbecause I had done a transcendental meditation course\n\nwhere you go to the center,\n\nthey teach you how to do it,\n\nthey give you your mantra.\n\nYou go for like an hour over four days.\n\nThey just kind of make sure you've got a handle on it.\n\nAnd the fourth day,\n\nwhen I was leaving,\n\nI was with a few friends of mine.\n\nThis woman just appeared,\n\nand she was a young woman.\n\nShe said, My name is Pookie.\n\nI work with David Lynch.\n\nWould you guys like to meditate with David sometime?\n\nAnd we were like, What?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI mean, just unbelievable invitation\n\nand, you know,\n\ncame out of outer space,\n\nand we were like, That's insane.\n\nI can't even say how profoundly important he is\n\nto me.\n\nI got there first.\n\nI was the first one there.\n\nI went up and met David alone\n\nfor like five minutes\n\nand he was just so sweet.\n\nI was like, What is this gonna be like?\n\nI'm coming to his home. Is he gonna be annoyed?\n\nIs he just kind of eyerollingly allotting this time to us\n\nbecause someone convinced him to?\n\nWhat is the situation?\n\nBut he was so welcoming,\n\nso warm, so happy that we were there.\n\nIt was the four of us.\n\nAnd we sat in his art studio at the back of his house\n\nand meditated with him\n\nand talked for a while.\n\nA friend of mine who was there,\n\nJocelyn, was about to make her first film\n\nand just had questions for him.\n\nLike, Do you have any advice on directing?\n\nAnd he gave great advice, very practical advice.\n\nAnd that felt like it was gonna be it, you know?\n\nAnd I was grateful to ever have met him.\n\nAnd then a few years later,\n\ngot this invitation to come work with him\n\non this show,\n\nfor, you know, one day.\n\nI think I was on that set for, like, two hours, tops.\n\nAnd that was just the greatest experience.\n\nI've crisscrossed this great land of ours\n\ncountless times.\n\nI hold the map of it here,\n\nin my heart,\n\nnext to the joyful memories\n\nof the carefree days I spent\n\nas a young boy.\n\nThat was just,\n\nit was very specifically written.\n\nIt was a monologue.\n\nThey said, in the script, I think,\n\nhow I was dressed\n\nand that I speak like Marlon Brando.\n\nThat was basically all\n\nthat was provided to me.\n\nAnd so I prepared myself\n\nand wanted to show up completely prepared,\n\nbut open to whatever he would want to adjust\n\nor do or whatever.\n\nBut we hardly talked about it on set.\n\nWe did it a couple times.\n\nHe came over.\n\nI think mostly he gave me notes\n\non some of the punctuations\n\nin the monologue.\n\nLike, Really hit that comma,\n\nor whatever, you know,\n\nsmall things like that.\n\nShaping the rhythm of it.\n\nBut just,\n\nand then just very supportive.\n\nAnd we did it just a few times and it was done.\n\nAnd I really wish I could've spent much more time\n\nworking with him.\n\n'Cause it was really,\n\nit's really a joy.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nThe Adults.\n\nIt is sort of a very mysterious character\n\nas written\n\nbecause\n\na lot is withheld.\n\nThe ambiguity, actually,\n\nis sort of what the driving force of the story is,\n\nactually -\n\nthe ambiguity that's happening between the characters.\n\nThis distance,\n\nthis gulf that's happening between them.\n\nBut that was,\n\nI think, what was compelling to me\n\nabout reading the script, actually,\n\nis everything that's living in the darkness\n\nof the characters\n\nand of their history\n\nand that we don't know.\n\nAnd the little pieces that we do see\n\nare what we have to draw our conclusions from.\n\nI have a hand.\n\nYeah?\n\nAny good?\n\nI think it's good.\n\nHmm.\n\nYeah, I have a hand.\n\nI don't have the nuts or anything, but...\n\nI'd played poker, you know,\n\nbefore doing the movie.\n\nI used to play in a home game,\n\na weekly home game\n\nat my friend's house,\n\nwhich, the game still stands,\n\nbut I don't live in Los Angeles anymore.\n\nBut they still play.\n\nI used to love playing, just,\n\nyou know, just for the social aspect of it,\n\njust to be there,\n\njoke around,\n\nand I would kind of just throw my money away\n\nand lose.\n\nI would lo...\n\nAnd then there are some people\n\nthat were playing at a different level,\n\nthat seemed to have\n\nan understanding of the game\n\nand the fundamentals of it.\n\nAnd so I knew\n\nthat they were playing on a different level than me,\n\nbut I was never really too curious\n\nto go deeper with it\n\nuntil I got cast in Molly's Game.\n\nAnd then I thought, Maybe I should read a book,\n\na poker book,\n\nand see what they know that I don't know.\n\nThere's something going on that I don't know.\n\nBut maybe I should just get interested in it.\n\nAnd then once I did, I found it so bottomlessly fascinating.\n\nI really love poker\n\nto this day.\n\nLove playing it.\n\nI have kind of seasons\n\nwhere I'm good at it\n\nand then other times where I'm just terrible\n\nand just can't get a handle on it.\n\nBut it's fun."
