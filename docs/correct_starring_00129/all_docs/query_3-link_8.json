        "text": "Michael Cera rose to fame playing the delightfully awkward George Michael on the cult comedy series Arrested Development 20 years ago. Although mostly known for his comedic performances, Cera has shown incredible range throughout his acting career.\n\nBorn and raised in Canada, Cera scored his first role in a Tim Horton’s commercial before making his feature film debut in 2000’s Frequency. He later appeared in the George Clooney-directed Confessions of a Dangerous Mind as the young Chuck Barris. Cera also lent his voice to the animated realm, most notably as Brother Bear in the series The Berenstain Bears.\n\nIn 2003, he landed the role of George Michael Bluth, the son of Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth, in the ensemble faux-documentary series Arrested Development, also starring Will Arnett, Tony Hale, Portia de Rossi, Jeffrey Tambor, Alia Shawkat, David Cross and the late Jessica Walter. Though originally short-lived, the series was and remains beloved by fans, and later spawned two rebooted seasons on Netflix.\n\nFollowing the first three seasons of Arrested Development, Cera played a string of coming-of-age teen roles in films, including Superbad, Juno, Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Youth in Revolt and, in something of a culmination of that progression, Scott Pilgrim vs The World. Though he's never left comedy behind, Cera has also shown serious dramatic skills in films like The End of Love, Molly’s Game and Gloria Bell.\n\nThis summer, Cera has earned praise for his role as Allan in Barbie, showcasing an alternative to the Kens dominating the film and proving to be a hilarious secret weapon for the film. His latest effort, The Adults, sees him returning to the indie world as a young man on a trip home that he’s determined to keep brief, even as he strives to manage the relationship between his sisters, played by Sophia Lillis and Hannah Gross.\n\nBelow, A.frame presents 10 essential films showcasing Cera's on-screen journey."
