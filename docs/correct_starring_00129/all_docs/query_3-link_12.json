        "text": "The Daughter Also Rises\n\nLisa meets a boy who seems to be the reincarnation of Ernest Hemingway, but turns out to be less than he appears. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse debunk myths at school, to the dismay of their fellow students.\n\nThe Rapes of Graff\n\nWhile touring Hearst College with Wallace, Veronica is stunned to run into her shady ex-boyfriend Troy Vandergraff (recurring guest star AARON ASHMORE). But the real surprise comes when Troy is accused of date rape on campus and calls Veronica for help. Meanwhile, Logan's legal troubles and his relationship with Hannah (recurring guest star JESSY SCHRAM) both reach important turning points. Later, after receiving a call for help, Keith arrives at a hotel and finds his attorney buddy Cliff (DARAN NORRIS) in a compromising position. MICHAEL CERA and ALIA SHAWKAT (both of \"Arrested Development\") guest star as Hearst College students Dean and Stacy."
