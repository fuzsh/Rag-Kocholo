I was kind of having a bit of a crisis … I was really not enjoying the level of heat,\" Cera said. \"I really didn't know if I was going to keep being an actor.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nCera stuck with acting because he was signed on to play the lead role in \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" which came out in 2010. He said that he is now \"so grateful\" that he \"committed\" to that role and continued his career.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor also said that at 19, he found it hard to establish boundaries between himself and his fans.\n\n\"Drunk people would be a classic example,\" he said. \"You know, if people are drunk, and they recognize you, and they're very enthusiastic, but it can be kind of toxic too. When you're a kid, people also feel they can kind of grab you – they're not that respectful of you or your physical space. I didn't know how to respectfully establish my own boundaries.\"\n\nCera went on to recall one moment when he went to a bar with friends the same weekend \"Superbad\" came out.\n\n\"It was like a burning feeling the whole time, just like everybody was so aware of me,\" the \"Arrested Development\" star said. \"It was a mistake.\""
