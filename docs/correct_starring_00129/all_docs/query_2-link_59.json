        "text": "Michael Austin Cera was born on June 7, 1988 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. He is a Tony Award nominee and is perhaps best known for his starring roles in movies such as Juno, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Superbad.\n\nUp until grade nine, Cera attended Conestoga Public School, Robert H. Lagerquist Senior Public School and Heart Lake Secondary School, but then continued his schooling through to grade 12 online. He also took improvisation classes at The Second City in Toronoto.\n\nAfter appearing in a handful of TV commercials, Cera's first breakthrough came when he landed the role of Larrabe Hicks in the TV series My Best Friend is an Alien in 1999. His next major appearance would come in 2002, playing the young Chuck Barris in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. This led to Cera being cast as George Michael Bluth in the hit series Arrested Development in 2003. He portrayed the character for three seasons and reprised him again in 2013 and 2018.\n\nAfter playing the role of Michael in the TV series Clark and Michael in 2007, Cera's international breakthrough came after being cast as Evan in the popular teen flick Superbad. He instantly became a Hollywood regular and starring roles in high-profile movies such as Juno, Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist, Extreme Movie, Year One, and Youth in Revolt would follow. His next major hit was the 2010 box office smash Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in which he played the titular character. Since then, his most notable screen credits include Burning Love, This is the End, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Person to Person, and Molly's Game.\n\nHe has also worked regularly as a voice actor over the course of his career, voicing characters in The Beranstein Bears, Braceface, Sausage Party, Childrens Hospital, and The LEGO Batman Movie, among others. He is also a keen musician, having toured as the bass player of indie rock band Mister Heavenly and having released his debut studio album \"True That\" in August 2014."
