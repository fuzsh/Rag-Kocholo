        "text": "Hollywood star Michael Cera is taking a road trip to “Sacramento.”\n\nThe capital city gets a starring role in the movie “Sacramento,” which will make its world premiere at the Tribeca Festival in New York City in June, according to the prominent film festival’s website.\n\nDescribed as a buddy comedy, “Sacramento” follows two former best friends — free-spirited Ricky and father-to-be Glenn — who embark on a spontaneous road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento.\n\nThe movie is directed and co-written by Michael Angarano, who stars in the feature film along with Cera, Kristen Stewart and Maya Erskine.\n\nAt Tribeca, “Sacramento” will compete in the U.S. Narrative Competition, screening alongside Delaney Buffett’s “Adult Best Friends,” Vera Brunner-Sung’s “Bitterroot” and Morrisa Maltz’s “Jazzy.”\n\nIndiewire reported that the movie is currently seeking distribution.\n\nWhere did new movie ‘Sacramento’ film in city?\n\n“Sacramento” fittingly features scenes shot and around in the capital city.\n\nAccording to a city news release in May 2023, crews filmed in Old Sacramento, Gunther’s Ice Cream, East Sacramento, R Street Corridor and the downtown area.\n\n“I’m thrilled that Michael Angarano chose to film part of his film in Sacramento,” Sacramento Film Commissioner Jennifer West said in the release. “With a wonderful cast and script, this movie is sure to bring Sacramento attention the likes of ‘Lady Bird.’ Independent films like this can have a large impact on the local community and tourism.”\n\nWest said the movie brought $100,000 to the region in terms of hotels, local hires, van rentals and catering.\n\n“Sacramento” isn’t the only new movie to highlight the Sacramento area.\n\nIn February, crews spent time in downtown Sacramento filming a new movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Teyana Taylor.\n\nThe movie, which is written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, does not have an official name, yet. It’s tentatively called “BC Project.”\n\nThe film is set to open in theaters on Aug. 8, 2025."
