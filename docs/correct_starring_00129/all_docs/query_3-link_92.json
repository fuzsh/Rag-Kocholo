Sacramento&nbsp;tells the story of best friends Ricky (Michael Angarano) and Glenn (Michael Cera) as they set out on a California road trip. During their journey the two reflect on the history of their friendship, past mistakes they've made, and how they can navigate the future through personal growth and overcoming the fears of maturity. Also written and directed by Angarano, the film shows audiences that growing up is not linear, and that every new chapter of life is an evolution.",
