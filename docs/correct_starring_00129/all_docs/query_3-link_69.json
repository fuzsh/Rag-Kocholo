        "text": "Kristen Stewart continues her 2024 indie reign following the Sundance premieres of “Love Lies Bleeding” and “Love Me.”\n\nNow, Stewart has a supporting role in “Sacramento,” directed by “Minx” star Michael Angarano, his second feature behind the camera after 2017’s “Avenues.” The road trip buddy comedy premieres at the 2024 Tribeca Festival in the U.S. Narrative Competition alongside Morrisa Maltz’s “The Unknown Country” follow-up “Jazzy,” Mark Duplass-produced “The Knife,” and more.\n\nStewart co-stars alongside Angarano, Michael Cera, and “PEN15” co-creator and “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” star Maya Erskine, who is also Angarano’s real-life partner.\n\nThe official logline reads: “When free-spirited Ricky suddenly reappears in father-to-be Glenn’s life, the two former best friends embark on a spontaneous road trip from LA to Sacramento in Michael Angarano’s original take on the buddy comedy.”\n\nActor/director Angarano co-wrote the script with Chris Smith, with the duo also producing along with Stephen Braun, Chris Abernathy, and Eric Fleischman.\n\nAngarano is not the only actor-turned-filmmaker behind “Sacramento”: Stewart is still prepping her directorial debut with the adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir “Chronology of Water.” Stewart has been attached to direct the film since 2018 and co-wrote the script with Andy Mingo. Imogen Poots is confirmed to lead the feature. Stewart recently told IndieWire’s Anne Thompson that taking on her own directorial project with “The Chronology of Water” has been a “body-ripping” and “overwhelming” experience. She is also set to pen a stoner comedy."
