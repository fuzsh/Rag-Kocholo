        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n18 Jul 2023, 07:52\n\nCredit: Rex\n\nHe’s a much-loved star who plays an important role in the new Barbie movie, but Michael Cera has admitted that he came close to giving up acting.\n\nThe Arrested Development actor - who plays Allan alongside Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in the hotly-anticipated Barbie film which lands this week - has explained that the fame he experienced after starring in movies such as Superbad and Juno, was “overwhelming”.\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, Cera spoke about his breakthrough rise to stardom at the age of 19, saying: “I didn’t know how to handle walking down the street. Fame makes you very uncomfortable in your own skin, and makes you paranoid and weird. There were lots of great things about it, and I met a lot of amazing people, but there’s lots of bad energies, too, ones that I was not equipped to handle.”\n\nHe continued: “If people are drunk, and they recognise you, and they’re very enthusiastic, but it can be kind of toxic too.”\n\nThe comedy star explained that some people were not “that respectful of you or your physical space”.\n\nOn how it affected him, Cera said: “There was a point where I wanted to stop taking jobs that would make me more famous. I was kind of having a bit of a crisis.”\n\nHe added: “I really didn’t know if I was going to keep being an actor.”\n\nHowever, having already committed to play the lead in Edgar Wright’s Scott Pilgrim vs The World in 2010, he said that he “went and did it, and obviously feel so grateful that that happened.”\n\nWith the new Barbie film set to land this Friday (21st July), its stars spoke to virginradio.co.uk and other press at the European premiere in London's Leicester Square last week.\n\nMargot Robbie, who plays the titular character, told us: \"It’s so exciting. I feel like it's been a long time coming. Five years in the works. I’m really thrilled.\"\n\nThe former Neighbours actor also gave her thoughts on the future of a Barbie Cinematic Universe."
