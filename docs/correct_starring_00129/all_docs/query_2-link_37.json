        "text": "The way Michael Cera tells it, making Barbie sounds like a surreal experience. “The first time I was on the set, I couldn't believe what I was seeing,” he says. At the behest of director Greta Gerwig, the film’s crew recreated the Barbie Dream House and its surrounding neighbourhoods as incredibly detailed real-life models on set in Leavesden. “It was stunning to see it,” says Cera. “It was full of the most minute attention to detail. Every single tiny little element, even if it would never be seen on camera, was perfect and brought you into this world.” The result looks like the toybox of every little kid’s dream. “It didn't feel like playtime,” says Cera, laughing. “It felt like the biggest amount of money I've ever seen spent.”\n\nOn the surface, Barbie feels like an odd fit for Cera, an actor known for playing the kind of awkward guy who might be the exact antithesis of a Ken. That turns out to be the whole point: Cera stars as Allan, a doll who was designed as a friend for Ken in the 1960s – a singular figure in a Barbie world where the men were all rippling, macho beach dudes. “The joke of my character is that he’s the only Allan in the world,” says Cera. The real-life Allan doll was discontinued after proving commercially unsuccessful. “Nobody was really interested in building out their Ken world that much,” Cera says. “It’s like, Ken is already just an accessory. We don't need him to have an accessory. That's kind of the tragic humour of this character. He’s sort of an anomaly in the world.” Cera laughs. “He’s a very marginalised figure. He has no function. No place, really.”\n\nCera is something of an anomaly himself. He began acting in TV shows and made-for-TV films when he was 11, and had his big break with a role on Arrested Development when he was just 15. But Cera is best known for his roles in Superbad and Juno, which both came out in 2007, when he was 19. This is the work most people still know him from, he says, when we speak on Zoom.\n\nJuno was an earnest and heartwarming indie comedy about teenage pregnancy; Superbad was a gross-out quest about a group of socially unsavvy teenage boys trying to buy alcohol and lose their virginities. Tonally these were such different teen films that, in hindsight, it’s strange to think that they were both huge hits at the same time. In a Hollywood that tended to show teens on film as ripped, athletic jocks, Cera brought what felt like an authentic embodiment of adolescent anxiety. Often his characters’ unifying characteristics were being awkward, sweet, and self-effacing.\n\nIn real life, Michael Cera is similarly scrupulously polite. The very first thing he does on our Zoom call is apologise for the sound of the dehumidifier in the basement where he is sitting (any noise it makes is imperceptible to me). Cera seems so down to earth that it can be easy to forget that he started out as a child actor, a trajectory that can so often seem to warp and distort careers. Cera didn’t come from a famous family, or have pushy stage parents. Instead, growing up in Canada, he started acting via weekend improv classes. “[Acting] was the thing I was sort of able to be good at, a little bit,” he says. “I felt really good in that environment. I was terrible at most other things. All my friends were like star hockey players at age nine, you know. And I couldn’t really skate that well.”\n\nHis obsession with movies started as a three-year-old, when he first saw Ghostbusters. “I was fascinated by the machinations of it, when you’re lost in the magic of it because you don't understand you're watching people performing,” he says “When you get your head around that as a concept… I was just like: I want to do that.”\n\nActing comes to Cera much more naturally than being famous does. He found the level of fame he experienced after the success of Superbad and Juno to be disorientating. “I had started when I was quite young, and I felt ready to take the job,” he says. “I was 19. I was not mature enough or secure enough in myself to handle such strange circumstances.” Cera, who describes himself as an introvert, felt “bombarded” by the attention. “I was living in LA at the time, and I felt very,” he says – he pauses for a few seconds to choose the right word – “paranoid walking around.”\n\nAs Cera has gotten older and had a child, he has tempered his slightly obsessive relationship with acting, to an extent. He has realised that in any film, each actor has only a limited amount of power over what the final film will look like. “You sort of have to make peace with that and relinquish a sense of control over your work,” he says. “I feel like I'm starting to change the way I think of myself, to be more and more like a contractor or something, just working on one aspect of a house. I’m not controlling the whole result, so I can’t really feel responsible for it.”\n\nOne example is Arrested Development, the critically beloved comedy that Cera landed when he was 15. After three seasons on Fox, Arrested Development was cancelled, and then revived by Netflix for a fourth season in 2013, followed by a fifth released in two halves in 2018 and 2019. The Netflix revival was broadly considered disappointing. Cera attributes this in part to the different ways of making a TV show for network television and for Netflix, where the process is more similar to shooting a film. The first time around, he says, they would spend one week filming a certain episode, then it would be edited and aired as they were working on later episodes. The Netflix version, on the other hand, involved filming scenes from disjointed episodes back to back. “It got a little, honestly, confusing,” he says, “because we were working on the scripts as we were shooting them, so the scripts were changing as we were shooting. Nobody could really keep the whole thing in their head.”\n\nIn the post-Superbad years, Cera took time off major projects (he recently told The Guardian that he considered quitting acting entirely), instead choosing to work on smaller, more personal projects: plays, independent films, joining a band. But when he heard about Barbie, something was different.\n\n“I reached out to Greta directly,” he says. “She immediately replied and said ‘Here, let's get on a Zoom’, and we got on a zoom right away.” He speaks highly of Gerwig, who helped to bring her particular vision to what should be a summer popcorn movie. “Greta has a great exuberance and spirit as a director. That really affects the atmosphere in a very positive way.”\n\nIn Gerwig’s film, Barbieland is a matriarchy. When Ken and Barbie transport into the real world, Ken (played by Ryan Gosling) discovers that reality is a patriarchy, and tries to remake Barbieland in this image. Allan doesn’t agree with the new regime (well, he was never much like the Kens anyway) and sides with the Barbies. Allan explicitly signifies a kind of “anti-toxic masculinity” figure.\n\nSince Barbie was announced, the film has served as a hook for rehashing some familiar debates about feminism. There has been discourse about whether the film, and Barbie as a symbol, is regressive for its celebration of hyperfemininity, or whether that could instead be viewed as empowering. Elsewhere, the debate has been said to ruin the fun of the film. This discussion is folded into the film itself, too. “That was one of the things I was impressed by when reading the script, that they’re tackling that conversation of what Barbie represents now,” says Cera. “I thought that was interesting, that a Mattel-endorsed Barbie movie would have that discussion about their massively high-selling product,” he adds. “But I feel that to skirt that conversation would be missing a big opportunity.”\n\nOf course, the huge market that has developed for pop feminism (and other entry-level social justice) books and branded products demonstrates how lucrative reopening this debate can be. In a culture in which radical sentiments of all kinds are routinely and repeatedly commodified, another strand of discourse about Barbie has seemed oddly quaint. There has been much conversation about whether Greta Gerwig making the film in conjunction with Mattel constitutes “selling out”. I ask Cera if he has any views on this. “A film is a product. A film is a capitalist venture, isn’t it?” he says. “I mean, they don't put them out for our health; they’re trying to make a return on them.” He laughs. “That’s a bit confusing.”\n\nOur conversation takes place about a week before SAG will call the actor’s strike that shuts down Hollywood. Even so, the changes wrought on the business by streaming are clearly on Cera’s mind. “The industry has changed so much in the last few years with streaming,” says Cera. “It’s created conditions where people work for like, no money. It feels like everything just got spread really thin.”\n\nLike most of Hollywood, Cera’s plans for what is next are now being put on hold. “We’re in unfortunate timing with the whole industry going on strike,” he says. He has a project currently in the works with Ari Aster’s production company Square Peg. He hopes to move into directing, as a way to have more influence on the final product – something you can lose as an actor. “You can take all of that hope you have for something and what you want it to be,” he says optimistically, “and actually be the person who is more in control.”\n\nArtwork by Matt Dartford\n\nStyling by Angelo Mitakos\n\nSAG-AFTRA members are currently on strike; as part of this action, union actors are not promoting their film and TV projects.
