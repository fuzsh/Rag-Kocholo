        "text": "Michael Cera\n\nCanadian actor\n\nMichael Cera (born June 7, 1988, Brampton, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian actor especially known for his comedic portrayals of offbeat and often awkward characters. Cera first garnered attention as George-Michael Bluth in the acclaimed sitcom Arrested Development (2003–06, 2013, 2018–19), and he later starred in such popular comedies as Superbad and Juno (both 2007).\n\nEarly life and career\n\nCera is one of three children born to Linda Cera and Luigi Cera, both of whom worked at Xerox. He developed an interest in acting at age three, when he repeatedly watched the classic comedy Ghostbusters (1984). At age eight he landed his first role, an unpaid appearance in an ad for Tim Hortons restaurants. A year later he did a commercial for Pillsbury, which was his first part with spoken lines.\n\nIn 1999 Cera graduated to TV series. His credits that year include I Was a Sixth Grade Alien, a Canadian children’s program that aired for two seasons, and Switching Goals, an episode of The Wonderful World of Disney; the latter starred Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen. In 2000 Cera made his first feature films, the crime drama Frequency and Steal This Movie!, a biopic about American activist Abbie Hoffman. More work followed, and Cera’s other notable credits from this period include George Clooney’s directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002).\n\nStardom: Arrested Development, Superbad, and Juno\n\nAt age 15 Cera landed the breakout role of George-Michael Bluth in Arrested Development, an irreverent comedy about a dysfunctional family. The show began airing in 2003, and it quickly became a favorite of critics. Cera earned particular acclaim for his portrayal of the sweet, easily flustered son of Michael Bluth, played by Jason Bateman. The two characters’ awkward attempts at father-son bonding were especially memorable. Despite glowing reviews, Arrested Development failed to find a wide audience, and the series was canceled in 2006 after three seasons. However, it developed a cult following in subsequent years.\n\nWith his elevated profile, Cera began to land major roles. In 2007 he starred with Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad, a comedy about socially inept high-school seniors and their misadventures while trying to lose their virginity. The movie was hugely popular, and it showcased Cera’s awkward comedic style, which critics singled out for praise. Later that year he had another box-office hit with the indie comedy Juno. Cera was cast as an earnest teenager who accidentally impregnates his best friend (played by Elliot Page). Other castmates included J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, and Jennifer Garner.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World and This Is the End\n\nIn 2008 Cera starred in the romantic comedy Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, a film about music fans searching for a band’s secret show over the course of one night. His credits the following year highlight Cera’s tendency to balance major studio releases with smaller films. He first appeared in the indie movie Paper Heart, which told the story of a filmmaker (Charlyne Yi) working on a documentary about love; Cera and Yi also composed the movie’s score. He then starred with Jack Black in Harold Ramis’s Year One, a comedy about Paleolithic buddies.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Cera portrayed a slacker guitarist who is also a video game character. Although well received, the film struggled at the box office; Cera later lent his voice to the animated TV miniseries Scott Pilgrim Takes Off (2023). In 2012 Netflix announced that it was reviving Arrested Development, and Cera reprised his role as George-Michael Bluth for two additional seasons (2013, 2018–19). During this time he continued to pursue other projects, and in 2013 he played a debauched version of himself in This Is the End, a film about a group of celebrities dealing with an apocalyptic event. The all-star cast includes James Franco, Seth Rogen, Rihanna, and Mindy Kaling.\n\nLater credits and voice work\n\nCera subsequently eschewed high-profile parts for a series of supporting—yet memorable—roles. In 2015 he made a guest appearance as a clueless lawyer in the TV miniseries Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp. He later portrayed a celebrity gambler in Aaron Sorkin’s Molly’s Game (2017), a biopic about a woman who runs a high-stakes poker game. In 2022 Cera began appearing on the dramedy series Life & Beth, playing the love interest of star Amy Schumer.\n\nCera was especially busy in 2023, and he drew particular attention for his turn as the discontinued Allan doll in Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster Barbie, a dramedy about the iconic toy; the film starred Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. That year he also played an opportunistic agent in Dream Scenario, a surreal comedy about a professor (Nicolas Cage) who becomes famous after appearing in random people’s dreams. His other credits from 2023 include The Adults, a well-received comedy about three unfulfilled siblings.\n\nIn addition, Cera has lent his voice to a number of projects, including the films Sausage Party (2016), The Lego Batman Movie (2017), Cryptozoo (2021), and Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank (2022). He also directed, wrote or cowrote, and starred in such short films as Brazzaville Teen-Ager and Failure (both 2013).\n\nTheater\n\nCera’s busy schedule has also included appearances on the stage. In 2012 he made his theater debut in a Sydney production of This Is Our Youth, Kenneth Lonergan’s acclaimed play about three troubled young adults. He continued with the drama when it transferred to Broadway in 2014. His later Broadways credits include two other Lonergan plays. In 2018 he starred with Chris Evans in Lobby Hero, playing a security guard trying to get his life together after being kicked out of the U.S. Navy. Cera earned praise—as well as his first Tony Award nomination—for his performance. He also appeared in Lonergan’s The Waverly Gallery (2018–19), which starred Elaine May as a woman struggling with advanced age.\n\nMusic and writing\n\nIn addition to acting, Cera has pursued a musical career. He was the touring bassist of the rock band Mister Heavenly and cofounded the band The Long Goodbye. He also contributed music to Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2014 he released his debut solo album, the folksy True That. Cera’s other activities include fiction writing, and in 2009 he published his first short story, “Pinecone,” in McSweeney’s.\n\nJacob Stovall"
