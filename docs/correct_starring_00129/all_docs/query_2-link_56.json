        "text": "Skin care brand CeraVe has bemused consumers by placing Canadian film star Michael Cera in the centre of a brand partner video on TikTok.\n\nThe Superbad and Barbie Movie star was \"spotted\" by influencer Haley Kalil, a CeraVe brand partner, at a pharmacy placing stickers of his face on CeraVe cream bottles, in a now viral guerilla marketing-style clip.\n\nThe post, which has over 250,000 views, then shows Cera signing his name on the bottles above the CeraVe logo.\n\nWhen Kalil approaches he turns to leave, pointing to the shelf of creams and saying “some lovely cream here” before walking out of the store.\n\n“Guys run to this pharmacy in BK, I just saw Michael Cera signing bottles,” Kalil wrote on Instagram.\n\n“I’m a #ceravepartner, and I’m asking @cerave what is going on.”\n\nInstagram account michaelcerasource, which provides updates on the actor, posted an image of Cera holding two bags filled with CeraVe creams shortly after the video's release.\n\n“Michael & CeraVe’s collaboration in the works. More updates soon,” the Instagram caption read.\n\nThe content has received largely positive reception on social media.\n\n“I’ve had this thought before while using my cerave cleanser lol,” wrote one commenter on Instagram.\n\n“I want Micheal Cera to hand me a cerave lotion bottle too,” said another.\n\nAnother posted: “Those signed bottles are going to be worth a fortune.”\n\nGuerilla marketing refers to brands creating unconventional interactions and situations to surprise its audience and promote its products.\n\nExamples of this include a lookalike model of supermodel Kate Moss being spotted having a coffee in Manchester with Aldi supermarket ahead of a Chanel show.\n\nMaybelline's CGI Lash Sensational Sky mascara advert also went viral last year.\n\nThe campaign from the L'Oréal-owned brand featured a tube carriage adorned with eyelashes driving under a Sky High Mascara wand for fluttery results.\n\nAnother clip featured a similar scene that showed a red double-decker bus with a similar set of big lashes above the front top window."
