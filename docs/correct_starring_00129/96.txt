It’s been over 15 the years since the world was introduced to the Superbad cast. The movie, starring Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Bill Hader, came out in 2007. The film was a coming-of-age comedy directed by Greg Mottola and written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. It pretty much put Jonah Hill on the map.

Here, we look at the Superbad cast and where they are now.

Jonah Hill as Seth

Jonah Hill had bit parts in several movies including I Heart Huckabees (2004), 10 Items or Less (2006) and Knocked Up before landing the lead role as Seth in Superbad.

After that, he landed roles in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Funny People (2009), Get Him to the Greek (2010), Moneyball (2011), the 21 Jump Street franchise (2012 and 2014), and War Dogs (2016).

He received his first Oscar nomination for portraying Peter Brand in Moneyball and his next Oscar nomination came for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. In 2018, Hill made his directorial debut with the drama Mid90s, which he also wrote. He also released a documentary titled Stutz in 2022, and he cowrote and starred in 2023’s You People.

Next up he plans to direct and star in the movie, Outcome, which he cowrote. The movie will also star Cameron Diaz and Keanu Reeves.

Michael Cera as Evan

Canadian born Michael Cera started acting at a young age. He had a regular spot in the series I Was a Sixth Grade Alien from 1999-2000. He then landed a regular spot on the series Braceface as the voice of Josh (from 2001-2005).

Then came the career defining role as George-Michael Bluth in Arrested Development (he also was in the reboot) where he starred alongside Jason Bateman, Portia de Rossi and Will Arnett. He was also a fan favorite in the role of Evan in Superbad. That same year he starred in the critically-acclaimed movie Juno. He starred in several movies after that including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist (2008), Year One (2009), and Youth in Revolt (2009).

Cera also appeared with Hill in several more movies including This Is the End, Sausage Party, and The LEGO Batman Movie (2017). Most recently he’s been in the series Life & Beth (2022-24).

Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fogell

Audiences will always recognize Christopher Mintz-Plasse as McLovin, the fake-ID alter ego of Superbad geek Fogell. The actor exploded onto the Hollywood scene when he played the memorable role in the hit comedy. He told Page Six that the sudden fame was a hard adjustment. “It was very alarming; it was very intense. There was a lot of anxiety, a lot of breakdowns. It wasn’t like I was a working actor that worked my way up to a certain level of fame. It was zero to 100 very fast.”

After Superbad, Mintz-Plasse appeared in Role Models (2008), Kick-Ass (2010), Pitch Perfect (2012), Neighbors (2014), Trolls (2016), The Disaster Artist (2017), Promising Young Woman (2020), and Honor Society (2022).

Emma Stone as Jules

Emma Stone got her start with small bits in shows like Malcom in the Middle, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and Medium. Then she got her big break when she was cast at Jules in the Superbad cast. After the movie, she continued to get steady roles in films including The House Bunny (2008), Zombieland (2009), and Easy A (2010).

She became a household name thanks to parts in The Help (2011), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), La La Land (2016) and the starring role in 2021’s Cruella. Most recently she’s starred in the series The Curse (2023-24) and Poor Things (2024), which earned her an Oscar.

Martha MacIsaac as Becca in the Superbad Cast

Martha MacIsaac had bit parts in movies including Ice Princess (2005) and Tv shows like This is Wonderland (2006) before landing the part of Becca in the Superbad cast. After that movie MacIsaac was in several TV series including Greek, 1600 Penn, The Pinkertons and the Family Guy. She also appeared in Battle of the Sexes opposite Superbad co-star Emma Stone.

Seth Rogen as Officer Michaels in the Superbad Cast

Prior to being in the Superbad cast, Seth Rogen was in Freaks and Geeks, The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), and his breakout role in Knocked Up (2007), released just weeks before Superbad. Rogen continued his successful streak with Pineapple Express (2008), Funny People, The Green Hornet (2011), The Guilt Trip (2012), The Interview (2014), and The Fabelmans (2022).
