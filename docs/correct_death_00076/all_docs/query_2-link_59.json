        "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (KPHO/Gray News) - A 13-year-old Arizona boy who was struck by a driver in a hit-and-run while riding his bike nearly two weeks ago has died.\n\nGlendale Police and the family of 13-year-old Elias Bizzle confirmed the teenager died from his injuries Tuesday. On April 11, he and some friends were out riding their bikes. Police say the group was crossing an intersection using the crosswalk when Elias was hit, KPHO reports.\n\nThe suspected driver, identified by police as 27-year-old Joshua Holbert, allegedly fled the scene in his Chevrolet Trailblazer, as friends and bystanders attempted to save Elias. The teenager was rushed to the hospital and put on life support but ultimately succumbed to his injuries.\n\nFamily gathered at the crash site last Saturday to pray for Elias. The teen’s mother, Victoria Bizzle, told KPHO at that time he suffered brain damage, road rash and a broken jaw and femur.\n\n“It is pure torture to see your 13-year-old laying so helpless, and you can’t do nothing about it. You can’t do anything about it, just pray,” Bizzle said.\n\nShe added there was no excuse for the suspect to not stop and help her son.\n\n“This monster turned my world upside down, and all I want is my son. I just want my son,” Bizzle said. “He didn’t deserve this. No one deserves this.”\n\nIn the days after the crash, police used traffic cameras and surveillance videos to track Holbert’s Trailblazer to an apartment complex. Court documents say the American flag that was attached to the vehicle at the time of the crash had been removed, and the vehicle was parked in such a way as to hide the damage.\n\nHolbert eventually turned himself in, allegedly stating he was involved in the crash, didn’t help the victim and fled the scene, returning to his apartment, police said. He faces charges of leaving the scene of an accident involving death or injury."
