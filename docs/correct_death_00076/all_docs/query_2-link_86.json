Coe, 81, for 56 years a practicing dentist of Theresa and Watertown until his retirement five years ago, died at about 5:20 Wednesday afternoon at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. Ray G. Pollard, 352 West Second street, Fulton, where he had been critically ill for about six weeks. Death was attributed to a stroke and the infirmities of old age.\n\nNews of the death of Dr. Coe was received from Mrs. Pollard by Dr. Coes son, Dr. Glenn E.

Burial will be made in the family plot at Theresa.\n\nDr. Coe, who since his retirement had resided part of the time with his son here and the rest of the time with his daughter at Fulton, suffered a stroke at his daughters home Feb. 7 and since that time he had been critically ill there. His left side was paralyzed and his speech was impaired.\n\n(A photo of Dr. George A. Coe was inserted within the text at this point.)\n\nHe was unconscious much of the time, although some times he rallied and indicated that he recognized his daughter. He had been blind for more than a year, having completely lost his sight because of infirmities. No hope had been held for his recovery since the time he suffered the stroke.\n\nDr. Coe had been in fairly good health before the time of his fatal illness, although about two years ago he was slightly injured in an automobile accident at Fulton. He was able to go out of doors daily for exercise even after he became blind, someone always accompanying him after he lost his sight.\n\nBefore his retirement, Dr. Coe was the oldest active dentist of Watertown and one of the oldest of northern New York.\n\nFrom Family of Dentists\n\nThe doctor came from a family of dentists. His father, his son and a brother, Dr. David L. Coe, all chose to follow the same profession. The latter, who practiced at Theresa, died there in April, 1932.\n\nDr. George A. Coe was born at Theresa, Nov. 28, 1853, a son of Dr. Horace A. and Mary Etta Carpenter Coe. The father was born in Oneida county in 1827 and when he was ten moved with his parents to Ohio, but after the death of Horaces father the family returned to Ridge Mills, N. Y.\n\nDr. Horace Coe then finished his education at the Whitestown seminary. For two years he taught school in Oneida county and then began the study of dentistry, later being graduated from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery.\n\nIn 1849 he began the active practice of his profession in Theresa. (Typists The volume of his business increased to such an extent that he established branch offices in Depauville, Lafargeville, Alexandria Bay, Redwood, Philadelphia, Black River and Evans Mills, being the first dentist to locate north of the Black river in Jefferson county. He enjoyed a wide practice and at times the services of three men were required to aid him in his work.\n\nDr. Horace Coe instructed a number of students in dentistry at his offices. He was the owner of a fine 300-acre farm, which was devoted to dairying. He was a delegate to the state dental society for years and was a member of Theresa lodge, No. 174, F. & A. M.\n\nDr. Horace Coe in 1849 married Miss Mary Etta Carpenter, who was born in 1826 in Floyd, Oneida county, a daughter of David and Mary Gardner Carpenter.\n\nFive children were born to Dr. and Mrs. Horace Coe: Mrs. Lodema Crabb of Cape Vincent; Dr. George A. Coe; Dr. David L. Coe, a graduate of the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery; Carrie, who became the wife of D. J. Alton of Antwerp, and Miss Ida J. Coe, who died in 1902. Dr. Horace Coe died in Augusta, Ga., in 1874, when he was only 47 years old.\n\nDavid Carpenter, father of Mrs. Horace Coe, was a native of Oneida county and a farmer by occupation. He died at the age of 84 years. His wife, Mary Gardner Carpenter, was also a native of Oneida county and was a daughter of Daniel Gardner, a pioneer settler of that section of the state. The mother of Dr. George Coe was one of a family of 13 children.\n\nWas Prepared for Law.\n\nDr. George Coe, the eldest son of the family, spent his early life in the town of Theresa, where he attended the common schools, completing his literary education at Falley seminary at Fulton. Dr. Horace Coe was determined that his son become a lawyer and not a dentist and so George A. Coe was sent to boarding school for three years. He had passed his entrance examinations for Yale to take up the law course, but he was determined to become a dentist.\n\nHe told his father of his ambition, and said that if his father would not permit him to study in the family office, he would go to the office of Dr. S. N. Robinson, then a dentist in Watertown, to study. The elder Coe finally relented, allowed the son to enter his office and then sent him to the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery at Philadelphia, Pa., now part of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Coe, who was 17 when he began to study dentistry under his fathers instruction, was graduated from the Pennsylvania dental college in 1874. At the time of his graduation he was 20 years and nine months old. There was a college rule that no one could receive a diploma until he was 21, but Dr. Coe allowed his whiskers to grow and his appearance was such that he was readily believed to be more than 21.\n\nSix weeks before Dr. Coe was graduated from college his father died. The young doctor then returned to Theresa shortly after his graduation and began active practice in the town of Theresa and adjoining towns, continuing the long-established practice of his father. The senior Dr. Coes dental practice was considered the oldest established in northern New York.\n\nFor 30 years, from 1874 to 1904, Dr. Coe followed his profession in the Theresa area. During that period the pioneer dentist was accustomed to driving to the villages of the Theresa territory to serve dentistry needs of that section of the county. Eight months of the years were spent in traveling to serve his patients of that region.\n\nI had a long spring wagon and a good team of horses in those days, recalled Dr. Coe at the time of his retirement, and the wagon carried my dental chair, three or four trunks of my equipment, my dental machine and all the necessary fixtures for my work. It took a good half day to unload the wagon when I arrived in town.\n\nFor a time his brother, the late Dr. David L. Coe of Theresa, was associated with him, having given up his business as a merchant to become a dentist. He, like his father and his brother, was graduated from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. The other dentist in the family, Dr. Glenn E. Coe of this city, son of Dr. George Coe, is a graduate of the same institution.\n\nDr. Glenn Coe, who had begun the study of dentistry as a student in his fathers office at Theresa, was graduated from dental college in 1900, the president of his class. Dr. George Coe had planned that his son should not continue the same itinerary he had for years followed. Consequently, on their way back from the graduation exercises at Philadelphia, Pa., they stopped in Watertown and the younger Dr. Coe purchased the practice of Dr. E. L. Sargent in the old Taggart building. There the son began his professional career.\n\nThe senior Dr. Coe came to Watertown to practice in 1904 and on Jan. 1 of that year admitted his son into partnership. Father and son practiced under the firm name of George A. & Glenn E. Coe with offices both in Watertown and Theresa. The son permanently remained in the local office in the Taggart building, while Dr. George Coe spent the first seven days of the month in the Theresa office and the remainder of the time in the Watertown office.\n\nPartnership Dissolved.\n\nThe partnership consisting of father and son continued for about 14 years. Then they decided to have separate offices. The father continued to occupy the suite of offices in the Taggart building, which stood on the site of the present chamber of commerce building, while the son in March, 1918, moved to the Light & Power building.\n\nIn 1919 the Taggart building was burned to the ground. Much of Dr. Coes equipment was destroyed in the disastrous fire, but he salvaged enough to sell the remainder for $400. He saved his diploma, the charred remnants being framed on the wall of his next office.\n\nAt that time a Dr. Wilbur of New York, a summer resident of the St. Lawrence river, had opened offices in the Elks building here. Deciding to discontinue, he sold out to Dr. George Coe. The offices, consisting of eight rooms, was the largest dental suite in the city. There Dr. George Coe continued his profession until 1930 when he retired after 56 years of practice, disposing of his equipment and closing his suite of offices.\n\nThe son, Dr. Glenn Coe, is still practicing in the Light & Power building.\n\nSince his retirement Dr. Coe resided with his daughter, Mrs. Ray G. Pollard, at Fulton, spending part of the time at the home of his son here.\n\nDr. George Coe inherited from his father his large farm at Theresa, which was devoted to dairying purposes and the breeding of high grade stock. Dr. Coe had had in his possession a large number of registered Holsteins and for many years dealt extensively in thoroughbred Berkshire hogs.\n\nOne of Countys Oldest Masons.\n\nDr. Coe was a Democrat in politics. He was one of the oldest Masons in point of years of membership in Jefferson county, having joined Theresa lodge, No. 174, F. & A. M., when he had just passed his 21st birthday. He was also a member of Theresa chapter, R. A. M.; Watertown Commandery, No. 11, Knights Templar, and Media Temple, A. A. O. N. M. S. He had been placed on the honorary list of those bodies. Dr. Coe was one of the early members of the Jefferson County Dental society.\n\nOn June 7, 1876, Dr. Coe married Miss Jennie L. Landon, who was born at Belleville, N. Y., in July, 1856, but who moved to Theresa in early life. She was a daughter of Samuel G. and Elizabeth Hamilton Landon. Dr. and Mrs. Coe were married at Theresa by Rev. B. F. Wood. Before his marriage Mrs. Coe was a schoolteacher at Theresa and Lafargeville.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Coe had two children, Dr. Glenn E. Coe of this city and Florence E., wife of Ray G. Pollard of Fulton. Mrs. Coe died at the family residence then 1022 Boyd street, in June, 1913.\n\nDuring the World war Drs. George and Glenn Coe offered their services as dentists to the government and volunteered to treat the teeth of any applicants for enlistment in the army who might otherwise have been rejected for defective teeth. At the time several applicants for the army had been rejected because their teeth were defective.\n\nA firm adherent to physical culture, Dr. Coe celebrated his 70th birthday by walking 26 miles. Starting at 8 a.m. from his home, then 1102 Boyd street, he walked out State street for four miles until he reached the summit of the steep second State street hill and then started back. When he reached Public Square, he decided to walk for a few more miles so he continued down Court street, out Coffeen street and over the big hill and beyond the Jefferson County Tuberculosis sanatorium until he was tow and a half miles away from Public square.\n\nReturning, he went to his office in the Elks building. In the afternoon he duplicated his mornings performance. The State street hike was one of his favorites because the hill is a vantage point to view the city. In the evening he again walked to the crest of the same hill.\n\nNever Owned An Automobile.\n\nDr. Coe never owned an automobile and had been a walker for 50 years. He began his habit of extensive walking for exercise when he started practicing dentistry at Theresa. His farm was three miles from the village and he walked to and from the office daily. He boasted that he walked from four to eight miles every day. His hikes of eight consecutive Sundays in the fall of 1923 rolled up a total of 150 miles, an average of more than 18 miles for each Sunday. Another of his boasts when he reached the 70-year mark was that he had not been away from his office 50 office days because of illness, attributing his good health to his habit of walking.\n\nFishing was one of his chief sources of recreation and during his vacations he spent the greater part of his time on fishing trips.\n\nDeploring the riding habit of the younger generation and urging that there be more walking, the veteran dentist once remarked: Long life, barring accidents, is merely good health. Walking preserves and prolongs health.\n\nDr. Coe was the last survivor of the family of Dr. and Mrs. Horace Coe. Surviving him, besides his son, Dr. Glenn Coe, city, and daughter, Mrs. Ray G. Pollard, Fulton, are a grandson and two great-grandchildren.\n\n~~*~~\n\nNATIVE OF PLESSIS DIES\n\nNorman S. Hind, 76, Dies in Hospital In Wilmington, Del.\n\nNorman S.
