        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.; Photograph was edited for publication purposes.Harold Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard Nebraska. He was an American actor, comedian, film director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his silent comedy films. He was also a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was one of the most popular actors of the silent film era along with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Lloyd's performance hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most iconic images in all of cinema. Lloyd began acting at the age of 20 and became friends with filmmaker Hal Roach. In 1919 he was seriously injured while holding what he thought was a prop bomb. It exploded, causing him to lose the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. By 1921 Lloyd and Roach moved from short films to feature length comedies. The films were popular and highly profitable, making him one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood. Lloyd married actress Mildred Davis on Saturday, February 10, 1923 in Los Angeles. The couple had three children (one adopted). After the silent film era, his popularity waned and he basically retired from film. In 1944 he became director and host of a radio anthology series that lasted only one season. He became involved in civic and charity work and experimented with photography. He died on March 8, 1971.; Harold Lloyd, Jr. was born in 1931 and as an adult sang, acted in a few films and worked in production in some of his father's compilation films. He was gay, which his parents accepted, but he led a troubled life, finding it difficult to live in the shadow of his famous dad. He died in 1971, not long after his father.Photograph caption dated December 8, 1933 reads \"Hollywood has a new hobby, the collecting of agates. Harold Lloyd and his 3-year-old son, 'Bud' Harold jr., are shown with a collection of cat's eyes, bull's eyes, greenies, etc., assembled from all over the world. There are 200 rare specimens in the collection, some valued as high as $10.\" Father and son are pictured outdoors, playing with the marbles, held in several boxes.",
