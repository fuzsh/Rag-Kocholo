The general and personal correspondence includes interoffice communications and fan mail. The financial files include cancelled checks, material on investments in stocks and bonds, and vouchers. There is also financial material on Paramount Pictures, including monthly reports and statements. There are 85 scrapbooks spanning the years from 1920 to 1938, and 1949. The volumes are dedicated to specific films, general publicity, or family. Included are clippings and reviews, ads, letters and telegrams, publicity items, and photographs. Leslie F. Whelan, Lloydâ€™s press agent and a specialist in foreign publicity, compiled some of the volumes. There are two Mildred Davis scrapbooks dating from 1919 to 1921.
