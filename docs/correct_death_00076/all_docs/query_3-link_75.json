The slapstick legend reprises his “Glasses Character,” this time as a good-natured but scatterbrained New Yorker who can’t keep a jobs until he finally finds his true calling saving the city’s last horse-drawn streetcar. From its joyous visit to Coney Island to its incredible Babe Ruth cameo (also Lou Gehrig for keen eyes) to its hair-raising climactic stunts on the city’s streets, Speedy is an out-of-control love letter to New York that will have you grinning from ear to ear.\n\nPresented here with a rollicking live score on synth-piano by virtuosos accompanist Jeff Rapsis. Jeff (a silent film expert) will introduce the film and conduct a Q&A afterward.\n\nChronically unemployed Yankees & Babe Ruth fan Harold “Speedy” Swift (Harold Lloyd) dates Jane Dillon (Ann Christy), a girl whose beloved grandfather, Pop (Bert Woodruff), runs a failing horse-drawn trolley business, in a rapidly changing city where the railway is becoming king. When a crooked railroad official steals Pop’s last car, hoping to force him into a shutdown, Speedy must race against the clock to find the culprits, return the car in time, and keep the service running on schedule.\".",
