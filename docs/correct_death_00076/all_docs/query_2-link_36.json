He was duputy clerk of the County Court during the judicial terms of Prendergast and Scabes, and is now the attorney for the Board of Education. Aside from his public duties, he has a large and renumerative practice.\n\nMr. McMahon was married Nov. 11, 1890, to Susie J. Crowe. They have one daughter, Dorothy. They are members of the jesuit Parish. Though not connected with any of the church societies, these institutions receive his hearty approval in all their endeavors for good.\n\nMr. McMahon has a large circle of friends in the city. Mr. McMahon resides in the new Eleventh Ward, and is strongly backed for the Democratic nomination for City Attorney.\n\nNew Registered Pharmacists\n\nEighteen Out of the Class of Forty-seven Pass the Examination.\n\nAt the January meeting of the Illinois state board of pharmacy in Springfiled, eighteen out of a class of forty-seven applicants for registered pharmacist and twelve out of sixteen candidates for assistant pharrmacist passed the examinations.
