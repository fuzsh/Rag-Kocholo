        "text": "HAROLD LLOYD FERGUSON\n\nHarold Ferguson was reunited with the love of his life, Marie, in heaven on February 16, 2023.\n\nHarold was born in Harrison County on April 1, 1931. He was a son of the late Howard and Marguerite Ferguson of Deersville. He served in the Korean War, where he was a prisoner of war and received three Bronze Star Medals. He married Marie Stahl in 1952 and they enjoyed being a part of the wonderful Stillwater community for over 67 years. Harold loved being a Rush Township trustee, vice president of the local Gideons, and a deacon and trustee at Park Christian Church.\n\nHe was an expert in his knowledge of trees and owned and operated Ferguson Lumber Company for over 60 years, and he eventually retired from Gardner Lumber in 2017 at the age of 85. Harold was a power saw champion throughout the state of Ohio, “famously” beating the world champion at the Paul Bunyan Show. Harold and his father planted over a million trees for the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District in the 1960’s. He was an avid reader and loved watching old westerns, gardening, playing cards, horse racing, playing the lottery and spending time with his family.\n\nThose left to cherish his memory are his children Howard Ferguson, Karen Nelms, Mark and Lisa Ferguson, grandchildren Chantil (Justin) Milam, Brooke (Matt) Wilson, Connor Ferguson and great grandchildren Blake and Harper Milam. He is preceded in death by his loving wife Marie, brothers John, Delmar and Kenneth Ferguson and son in law, Brett Nelms.\n\nA funeral service will be held Saturday, February 18, 2023 at 12 pm at the Uhrich-Hostettler English Funeral Home, Inc. in Uhrichsville. Calling hours will be before the service from 10-12 am. Interment will be at Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Stillwater.\n\nIn lieu of flowers donations can be made to local Gideons at PO Box 261 Dover, Ohio 44622 or Truman Hospice House in New Philadelphia, Ohio."
