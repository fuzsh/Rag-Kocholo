        "meta_description": "HAROLD LLOYD&nbsp;d1971. American film actor and producer most famous for his silent comedies during the 1920s.&nbsp;He ranks alongside&nbsp;Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton&nbsp;as one of the most popular and influential film comedians of the&nbsp;silent film era&nbsp;. He made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and &quot;talkies&quot; between 1914 and 1947 ;&nbsp;best known for his &quot;Glasses Character&quot;, a resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who was perfectly in tune with 1920s era America. His films frequently contained &quot;thrill sequences&quot; of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, for which he is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in &quot;Safety Last&quot; (1923) is one of the most enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd did many of these dangerous stunts himself, despite having injured himself in 1919 during the filming of&nbsp;Haunted Spooks &nbsp;when an accident with a prop bomb resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand . Although Lloyd&#39;s individual films were not as commercially successful as Charlie Chaplin&#39;s on average, he was far more prolific (releasing twelve&nbsp;feature films&nbsp;in the 1920s while Chaplin released just three), and made more money overall ($15.7 million to Chaplin&#39;s $10.5 million). He died aged 77 of prostrate cancer. He has two stars on The Hollywood Walk Of Fame.",
