His wife and four children, three boys and one girl, survive him. He was a Mason and was laid to rest by members of that order. He had been in wretched health for the past year. Being careful and prudent he left his affairs in good shape. His will, which was made several years ago, urges the payment of all his past debts and gives the residue of his property to his wife and children.\n\nJ. H.

Rainwater, Widely Known Arkansas, Dies\n\nFuneral for Retured Banker, Merchant to be Held Sunday\n\nWood Rainwater, aged 64, widely known throughout Arkansas and the nation as a banker, merchant and writer, died at a local hospital at 1:30 a.m. Saturday. He was stricken with a cerebral hemorrhage on December 16. Ten days later he was removed to the hospital where he remained until his death.\n\nFuneral services will be held at the home, 1709 North Spruce Street, at 2 p.m. Sunday in the charge of Rev. Hay Watson Smith and the Rev. John Van Lear. Burial will be in Roselawn Memorial Park in charge of P. H. Ruebel & Co.\n\nMr. Rainwater retired from active business in 1928 after 40 years as a banker and merchant at Morrilton, coming to Little Rock to live. He went to Morrilton in 1897 as a bookkeeper for the firm of Doyle & Henley. Three years later he went into business for himself, becoming a member of the firm of Earle & Rainwater. Still later, this general mercantile business became Rainwater Bros., Mr. Rainwater being associated in it with a brother, Mr. Knight Rainwater, now dead.\n\nWhen the Rainwater Bank was formed, Mr. Rainwater became president, continuing in this post for 15 years, or until his retirement.\n\nAbout five years ago, he and the late Charles Frauenthal and R. E. Earle formed the Merchants Plant Food Company of North Little Rock, a firm dealing in Fertilizer. Mr. Rainwater was elected president and retained this post even after his retirement from his other business.\n\nIn addition to these activities, Mr. Rainwater was a leader in many other business enterprises. He aided in the formation of a ginning company, a cotton compress and other concerns at Morrilton.\n\nMr. Rainwater became widely known, however, probably more through his writings than through his business enterprises. His articles, published in newspapers and magazines and reprinted throughout the country, gained wide attention. He steadfastly refused to accept payment for these humorous, philosophical articles, although several attractive offers to write professionally were made him. His writings and his spoken wit gained him the title of \"Will Rogers of Arkansas\".\n\nMr. Rainwater was a native of Oakland, Miss. He graduated from the Mississippi Male and Female College at Sardis and attended Goodman’s Business College at Nashville, Tenn. before going to Morrilton.\n\nSurviving him are his widow and two daughters, Miss Margaret Rainwater of Little Rock and Mrs. Ralph Farris of Fort Smith; his mother, Mrs. J.

Rainwater, was born in Benton County, Oregon, January 12, 1866, and was the first of seven children to meet death. The family removed to this place in 1869 where they have since resided and where Lizzie, as she was called by loved ones, attended school, grew to womanhood, was wooed and won, being united in marriage to Charles R. Dorr on the 22nd day of October, 1884. She was taken sick on the second of this month and from the first had a presentiment that she would not recover. Worn with watching and nursing her little son through a severe attack of typho-malaria, she was unable to withstand the rapid inroads of a complication of diseases, and with a perfect smile of trust, sank peacefully to rest at half past one o’ clock Monday afternoon.\n\nThe funeral was held at the opera house on Wednesday under the direction of Rainbow Chapter No. 1, Order of the Eastern Star, of which she was a worthy member, and the first to cross the dark river.

Her mother’s home was directly in the path of Sherman’s march to the sea, and was used by General Sherman as headquarters for his officers while in that section. The courteous treatment of the \"little rebel\" and her mother by these officers, the booming cannon, and the pall of smoke from burning villages and cities which marked the course taken by the invader as he crossed Georgia on his famous march all made a vivid impression on the young schoolgirl’s mind, which never faded. The impression made by the Yankee officers did not go very deep, however, as she married Captain James H. Webb, a young office in General Joseph E. Johnston’s army, when she was 17.\n\nFollowing the death of her husband, Mrs. Webb moved to Dallas in December, 1886, and had lived here ever since, celebrating her 80th birthday, June 24.
