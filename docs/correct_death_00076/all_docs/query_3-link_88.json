        "text": "Czech and Jewish (from Bohemia) (TÃ¡bor): habitational name from the city of TÃ¡bor in southern Bohemia, founded in 1420 by Hussites as their fortification and named after the Mount Tabor near Nazareth in the Palestine, an important Biblical site. The city's name came to denote a Taborite, a member of the radical wing of the Hussite movement. Compare 3 below.\n\nSlovenian, Croatian, and Polish: topographic name from tabor, a word of Czech (ultimately Biblical; see 2 above) or Turkish origin (from tabor âmilitary campâ, also âbattalionâ), today meaning âcampâ (in Polish âcamp of nomadsâ), but in Slovenian originally denoting a fortification, built in the times of the Turkish plunderage (15thâ16th century) around a church atop a hill."
