Logue, Esq., an old citizen of Columbus, and a gentleman universally esteemed. He died suddenly at his residence in this city at 6 oclock this morning, of congestion. We have merely time to announce the sad news. Promising an appropriate notice in next issue.\n\nColorado Citizen, May 15, 1884\n\nOBITUARY\n\nDied, at his residence in this city, Thursday morning last, at six oclock, Lyle J. Logue, Esq, of congestion of the lungs. Mr. Logue, having spent the greater portion of his life in this place, was well known far and near, and the announcement of his death vibrated the chords of sorrow and sympathy in every heart. HIs severe illness was very brief, and so unexpected was the dread event that friends and relatives were alike paralyzed. He was born in Columbus, Miss., Nov. 21, 1849.. When only a few months old his mother was removed to her eternal home, but her place was abundantly supplied by his adopted mother, the present Mrs. Mattie Cook, (relic of the late R. V. Cook,) who became his fathers wife when Lyle was three years, three months and twelve days old. When he had attained eleven years and twenty-one days, his father paid the great debt of nature, and his mother was left his sole guardian. Faithfully and lovingly she performed her duty in molding his infant mind, and developing his character; while ever between them existed a link of affection fervent, holy, indissoluble, and to her he accorded palms of victory for the rearing of the noblest work of God, an honest man.\n\nHe was admitted to the practice of law at an early age, for which he was eminently qualified, and creditably filled the offices of County and City Attorney, which he assumed by the voice of the people. In April 1880, he married Miss Hattie Cook of this city, a young lady superior in every respect, and who cast a glow of happiness over his life that could emanate from no other source. Three little darlings came to claim their love,but the first, a little girl, was recalled to the spirit land after a stay of a few short weeks. Two little boys--one aged two years, the other two weeks--were strong ties to bind him to earth. While his inanimate form was reposing under his own roof, little Johnny said, Papa is sleeping, tomorrow he will wake and talk to me. Dear little innocent prattler! they words are prophetic. Assuredly he is sleeping the last, the long, the dreamless sleep, but in the bright tomorrow of eternity you shall hold sweet converse with him.\n\nColumns could be written upon the vacuum his loss occasions. His old familiar haunts drearily miss him, and even the streets that resounded to his clastic[sic] tread seem lonesome and drear. As a citizen he was enterprising, as a business man prompt and energetic, as an official fearless and just, in the circles of pleasure social and urbane, in appearance prepossessing, as a friend reliable, a dutiful and tender son, a kind brother, a loving, thoughtful and devoted husband, and indulgent father. In the summer of life, while the vernal freshness lingered around him, and the expanding buds exhaled sweet incense, joyfully foretelling of honors yet to be reaped, he has been summoned to the bar of Heavens high chancery.\n\nThursday afternoon at 5 oclock the Rev. J. B. Armstrong, Pastor of the Columbus Baptist Church, made some feeling and appropriate remarks of sympathy and consolation to the bereaved ones, in the funeral service at their residence,after which the mortal remains, bearing a floral cross at the feet, a crown at the head, symbolical of the triumph of death over life, were conveyed to the city cemetery where reverently committed by his brother Odd Fellows to the dust, the Knights of Honor, Knights and Ladies of Honor and Legion of Honor Lodges attending in a body. The long cortege and sad countenances fully attested the proud position he held in the hearts of the people, and a deep pulse of pain throbs through the entire community for the afflicted relatives. The Citizen sadly extends heartfelt condolences.\n\nHis mother is deprived of a needed solace and staff, his children have suffered an irreparable loss, but words are impotent to paint the dark abyss of grief into which his young widow is plunged.\n\nCould all her pain but quiver up\n\nFrom its sad depths, twould pierce the gates of heaven,\n\nAnd angels een might stay their songs to shed\n\nThe dew of pity on her agony.\n\nThe willow and cypress cast their shadows over her pathway, but may the golden, sacred light of resignation form a divine halo round her, for--\n\n“Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot beat.:’\n\nColorado Citizen, May 22, 1884\n\nLoner, Bonnie (Bennett)\n\nLoner\n\nBonnie Loner, 77, of Sheridan died Wednesday, Dec. 13, 1995 at Columbus Community Hospital\n\nBorn April 5, 1918 in Iola, she was the daughter of Thomas and Eva (Taylor) Bennett.

God has transplanted it, and its fruitage is in Heaven. The prologue of suffering—the wail of earth's anguish and pain, is changed into the harping symphonies of endless bliss—the __ed epilogue of peace. Death is not death, but life. The grave is an illumined temple of apotheosis—a shrine of immortality—into which the loved one has gone to put on the vestments of Heaven. Saved by virtue of the atonement, the beautiful has been taken from the evil to come, earth's sorrows, and introduced to an eternity of progressive glory. May the mourning father and the grief-stricken mother, and the sorrowing friends and kindred, meet with the loved, the beautiful, the departed, up there in the starry sky, where the angels are. K. H.

S. Steve Lowrey at Columbus.\n\nRobert Dunlavy, near relative of the Holloway families and W. S. Shaver of this city died at Eagle Lake Saturday morning of last week. He had been in ill health for some time past, we understand. Mr. Dunlavy in previous years had often visited Weimar, and was well and favorably known to many of our people. He leaves a widow (formerly Miss Flora Secrest) one daughter, Miss Thelma Blanche, and one son, Clyde. He was 59 years of age at time of death. He was born and raised at Fayetteville. The remains were laid to rest in the Odd Fellows' Cemetery at Columbus, Rev. J. C. Wilson officiating. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his bereaved ones.\n\nThe other death referred to was Mr. A. S. (Steve) Lowrey, whose death occurred at the family home in Columbus Wednesday of last week. Mr. Lowrey had been in feeble health for some time past, but was able to be up and down town the Saturday preceding his death. He was taken seriously ill on Sunday, we understand, and the decline came so quickly he was unable to be present at the funeral of his brother, Mr. John A. Lowery, his own death following that of his brother John by two days. The remains were buried at Eagle Lake.\n\nA. S. Lowrey was born in Webster county, Georgia in 1849. His family came to Texas in 1869. He lived in Weimar for many years, and it was here while engaged in carpenter work in one of the brick buildings now occupied by the Boettcher Company that he sustained a fall which crippled him for life. He was on a scaffold engaged in work on the ceiling when he lost his balance and fell to the floor beneath, sustaining an awful break of one of his legs, the bones being splintered and protruding through the flesh. Mr. Lowrey later moved to Columbus, and had resided there some twenty-three years prior to his death. He was a good man, true as steel to his friends, honest, upright, a devoted husband and father, and his death is sincerely deplored.\n\nHe leaves his widow, two sons, Walker of Houston and Charles of Columbus, three brothers, Joe R. Lowrey of Alabama, Frank Lowrey of North Texas and George Lowrey of Houston and one sister, Mrs. Henry C. Thomas of Ramsey, to whom the heartfelt sympathy of many old time citizens and neighbors is extended.\n\nWeimar Mercury, October 10, 1930\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nMr. A. S.

Mr. Lowrey walked down town last Saturday and had been confined to his bed since Sunday. Funeral services will be held at the residence this (Thursday) afternoon at 2:30 and interment will take place at the Eagle Lake cemetery. Mr. A. S. Lowrey was born in Webster County, Georgia, March 23rd, 1849. He came to Texas with his parents in 1869 and to Columbus some twenty three years ago. During the past years he has conducted a boarding house here. He was a prominent and loyal citizen, entering into local matters and always doing his duty to his community and country.

Sr.\n\nProminent Citizen Goes To His Reward\n\nAfter a lingering illness that lasted for many months, the poor, tired spirit of our good friend and fellow-townsman, Mr. Walter B. Lowrey, Sr., succumbed to the inevitable early Tuesday morning and winged its flight Heavenward, for in our mind, knowing Walter Lowrey since early boyhood and knowing the life he led, we know that Heaven was his destination. He led a good, clean life always, was never known to speak ill of his fellow-man, always anxious to do all the good he could in this life, an exemplary husband and father, law abiding citizen, Christian gentleman, none knew him but to admire and praise his upright character and sturdy manhood. He will indeed be missed by his large circle of friends throughout this section.\n\nThe funeral took place at 5:30 Tuesday afternoon, the services being conducted at the family home by Rev. J. H. E. Willmann, his late pastor. It was largely attended and there were many beautiful floral offerings, attesting the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow-men. [Interment in Weimar Masonic Cemetery]\n\nIf we are not mistaken, he was born and raised in this section or community. The writer knew him from the time he was quite a young boy, and he filled various positions of trust during his life-time. For many years he was carrier of mail on old Rural Route No. 4. and among the patrons along he was greatly beloved. A few years ago he was retired by the postoffice department, and since that time he had no regular occupation. However, ill health beset him soon after his retirement, so he was really unable to do much in the way of work.\n\nWalter Lowrey was one of the cleanest, steadiest, best men we ever knew. He was strictly honest, a quiet, lawabiding citizen, a devoted husband and father....\n\nHe is survived by his widow, three sons, Wiley of Hillsboro, Walter B. and Kent of Houston, and several grandchildren, to whom our heartfelt sympathy is extended.\n\nWeimar Mercury, May 14, 1937\n\nFrom the files of Dorothy Albrecht.
