When firefighters arrived, heavy smoke was billowing from the structure upon arrival, but no visible fire. After forcible entry, they encountered high heat, and extreme smoke conditions. They found multiple remote rooms all heavily involved in fire. Additional companies were requested by command. Engineer Mark Langvardt of Truck 16 was performing truck operations on the second floor when he became separated from his partner. With a subsequent partial floor collapse of the second floor, Langvardt found himself in a room measuring 6 feet by 11 feet filled with filing cabinets and business equipment, with an aisle only 28 inches wide. The only window was 20 inches wide with a sill height of 42 inches and covered by a security grate. Engineer Langvardt was trapped and low on air. He was able to break a small hole in the window with his flash light, which alerted command and firefighters out front that he was in trouble. A second alarm was transmitted to dispatch and surrounding fire crews, and they initiated an intense rescue operation. The confined space of the room proved to be a challenge. Simultaneously, while attempts were being made to get Langvardt out through the window, they attempted a breaching of the room wall. The advancing fire required hand lines to be directed into the room, which complicated the rescue attempts. Rescuers could not raise Langvardt up and out the window because of the narrow space, the distance to the sill, and his weight in full bunking gear. After a 55-minute rescue operation, access to Langvardt was achieved through the breached wall. Langvardt was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead from smoke inhalation. Engineer Mark Langvardt became the 50th Denver Firefighter to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Firefighters and Police attempted to make contact with the party without avail. Fearing the party in the home was in distress and seeing a partially open window on the second floor, a ladder was raised to the window. A police officer started to approach the ladder when Firefighter Doug Konecny, dressed in a bunking coat, day boots and helmet, said he would climb up and enter the residence. When Doug was approximately three quarters the way up the ladder, a handgun appeared in the window and a single shot rang out. Doug climbed back down the ladder, where it became obvious that he had been shot. The Truck 10 crew members grabbed Doug, took him to a safe location, and instituted immediate life-saving procedures. Doug was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the throat. With the suicidal party now barricaded in the residence, Denver Police called for additional backup and SWAT. Negotiations for surrender with the party broke down after almost four hours, when the barricaded party set fire to the second story of the residence. As smoke and flames poured from the residence, the party, later identified as Lamar Edwards, exited the rear of the structure and shot himself. Edwards was taken to the hospital where he died several hours later. Firefighters then began to cautiously attack the fire, fearing the house might be booby trapped. The fire was extinguished with no further injuries. Firefighter Doug Konecny, age 48, was a 26-year veteran of the Department. Doug left behind two sons and a daughter.
