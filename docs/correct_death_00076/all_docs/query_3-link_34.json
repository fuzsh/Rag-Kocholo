        "text": "July 7, 1931 – February 16, 2023\n\nHarold Lloyd Whitaker, 91, of Friendswood, Texas passed away on Thursday, February 16, 2023. He was born in Southport, Indiana into a family of 10 children. The family farmed various crops and raised livestock during their lifetime.\n\nHarold served in the U.S. Airforce during the time of the Korean War. His working career began with Union Carbide (which later became PraxAir Surface Technologies) in Indianapolis, moving to North Haven, Connecticut and finally Houston, Texas. Those who knew him, knew he was a “detail” person and had a memory like a steel trap.\n\nHarold’s life was one of service to his community. Some of his accomplishments included serving on the Friendswood ISD Board, on several committees and boards for the City of Friendswood and as Mayor for the City from 1997 – 2003. He served on the Galveston County Central Appraisal District and the Galveston County Consolidated Drainage District Board.\n\nHarold and his wife, Ann, were partners in opening and operating the first Western Wear store, Boots ‘N Britches, in Friendswood in the mid 1970’s.\n\nSome of his favorite pastimes were watching Friendswood High School sports and college sports.\n\nHarold was preceded in death by his parents and 8 siblings and survived by his wife of 72 years, Ann, brother Donald Whitaker and 5 children: Ralph (Vickie) Whitaker, Dawn (Herschel) Glasgow, Sharon Collier, Karen (Darryl, Jr.) McDonald, Greg (Diane) Whitaker, 10 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family suggest a donation to your favorite charity or a contribution of the Friendswood Education Foundation at fef.myfisd.com.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Thursday, February 23, 2023 at 11:00 A.M. at Friendswood Friends Church, 502 S. Friendswood Drive, Friendswood Texas 77546 with Rev. David Bridges officiating."
