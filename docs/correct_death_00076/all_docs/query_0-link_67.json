Funeral services were held at the residence at three o'clock Tuesday, Rev. W. A. Flachmeier officiating, and the body was laid to rest by the local American Legion Post, interment taking place at Odd Fellows Rest.\n\nMr. Riehs was born in La Grange on December 12th, 1892 and was married to Miss Ophelia Saxon on October 21st, 1919.\n\nHe enlisted in the army on April 28th, 1918 and served in Co. L of the 360th Inf., 90th Div. until discharged at Camp Travis on June 2nd, 1919. During this service Mr. Riehs saw front line trench service in two engagements, and was with the army of occupation in Germany.\n\nSince the war he has worked in the bridge and building department of the Southern Pacific until some six months ago when he became ill from a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis and ulcer of the stomach from which he died.\n\nHe is survived by the wife, six small children, his mother, two brothers and three sisters, to whom our sincere sympathy is extended.\n\nColorado County Citizen, April 14, 1932\n\nTranscribed by Dennis Boatright\n\nRiehs, Robert Karl\n\nRiehs Is Suicide; Wife Wounded\n\nRobert Karl Riehs, 60-year-old janitor of Parkview Manor retirement home, killed himself with a 12-gauge shotgun Sunday in a daybreak incident that almost cost the life of his wife also.\n\nShe is recovering in Youens Memorial Hospital with a badly mangled hand, resulting from her trying to wrest the suicide weapon, an ancient single-shot piece, from her berserk husband.\n\nMr. Riehs, a native of Mullins Prairie who had done janitor and yard work during most of his 16 years in Weimar, was found dead by City Marshal Fred Vornsand in the dining room of the home the couple rented in the 100 block of West Main, a few minutes after Mrs. Riehs had been wounded and had run to a friends home two blocks away for help.\n\nThe family told Officer Vornsand Mr. Riehs had been increasingly despondent during the past few months.\n\nIt was shortly after 5 a.m. Sunday when the situation erupted in tragedy. Mr. Riehs had had a wakeful night and had dressed before dawn but was asleep on the bed again, clothed except for his shoes, when Mrs. Riehs arose and began getting ready to go to work. She worked part-time at Parkview Manor as an attendant.\n\nTried to Take Gun\n\nShe was in the bathroom when Mr. Riehs appeared with the shotgun which he normally kept on the bedroom wall, along with a rifle. Fearful, she tried to take it away from him and it discharged, hitting her hand.\n\nShe ran next door to the Emil Neiser home, banging on the door and calling, but was unable to rouse them. Years ago she had lived across the street from Mr. and Mrs. George Sander, and her next thought was to go to them for help. She was just at the railroad track, about a block from home, when she heard the second shot from the shotgun. She ran on to the Sander home, where Mrs. Sander called Mr. Vornsand.\n\nThe officer, after checking on Mrs. Riehs safety at the Sander home, went on to the Riehs home and through a window saw the dead man on the dining room floor. Evidence indicated he had been in the bedroom a few steps away when he shot himself in the chest.\n\nPliers to Remove Cartridge\n\nThe old shotguns condition wasnt typical of the way Tex Riehs, as so many friend knew him, kept his possessions. He was an exceptionally neat person, but the shotgun was so rusted that it was with some difficulty that Officer Vornsand was able to open it. He had to use pliers to removed the empty cartridge. This, said the officer, probably explained the long lapse of time between the first and second shots.\n\nJustice of the Peace Henry Hasse Sr. held the inquest and returned a verdict of death by self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nMr. Riehs had been yardman and janitor at St. Michaels Church, and then at Weimar Public School for several years before they moved to Columbus, where he took a job as custodian of Columbus Convalescent Home. When Parkview Manor opened here in January he was hired as its custodian and they moved back to Weimar.\n\nBorn Jan. 21, 1909, at Mullins Prairie, he was a son of Karl and Pauline Fritsch Riehs. He married Miss Birdie Erna Hoffmann and they continued living at Mullins Prairie, where he worked as a farm hand. After they moved to Weimar he became a member of Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church at New Bielau.\n\nSon, Daughter Survive\n\nSurviving in addition to his wife are a son, Larry Riehs of Schulenburg; a daughter, Mrs. James R. (Elenora) Kessler of Austin; two grandchildren; two brothers Louis of La Grange and Englebert of Hallettsville; and two sisters, Mrs. Annie Fein and Mrs. Norie Knigge of Houston.

Riehs. On May 4th, 1932, she was received into the Christian Church by Holy Baptism, only a few weeks after she had lost her father. She died of ptomaine poisoning early on June 9th.

E. D. Rivenburgh died in Weimar at his family residence at 5 oclock, p.m., October 1, 1885, in his fortieth year. Mr. Rivenburgh was born in the state of Illinois; came to Texas a poor young man just after the late war, and in 1874 was happily married to Miss M. J. Lowrey, near Borden, in this county, by whom he had five children, two of whom are now dead. He joined the Baptist church in 1878. By industry and economy he had accumulated quite a nice little property. He leaves a wife and three small children to mourn the loss of a protector. Mr. R. was a kind husband, devoted father, and a good neighbor. His remains were followed to the grave [Weimar Odd Fellows Cemetery] by a large concourse of friends, and buried by the Knights of Honor, of which order he was a member. Religious services were held by the Rev. P. H. Hensley. May the blessings of high heaven rest upon the orphan children and lonely wife and mother in this hour of sore trial and bereavement.\n\nColorado Citizen, October 8, 1886\n\nTribute of Respect\n\nThe undersigned committee having been appointed to draft suitable resolutions respecting the death of Brother E. D. Rivenburgh, a member of Thomas Q. Mullin Lodge No 1500 Knights of Honor beg to report the following;\n\nWhereas God in his wisdom did see proper by death to remove from among us at five oclock p. m. on the first day of October our dearly beloved brother, friend and neighbor E. D. Rivenburgh.\n\nBe it Resolved That in the death of Brother Rivenburgh our Lodge has lost one of its most zealous members, the county of her best citizens, the wife (now widow) a kind husband and the three little orphan children an affectionate father. [Interment in Weimar Odd Fellows Cemetery]\n\nNow, be it Resolved, That while we submissively bow to this dispensation of providence we sincerely feel our loss and acknowledge our brothers virtues and will endeavor to emulate them in our practices.\n\nResolved, That this Lodge wear the usual badge of mourning for the space of thirty days.\n\nResolved further, That a copy of these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of this Lodge, and that a copy be sent to the Weimar Gimlet for publication, and one furnished the bereaved family.\n\nThis 14th day of October, 1885,\n\nS. McCORMICK,\n\nA. F. ROSE,\n\nB. HEFNER,\n\nCommittee.\n\nWeimar Gimlet, October 15, 1885\n\nLast Friday Mrs. E. D. Rivenburgh, of this place, received $2000 from the Knights of Honor, being the amount of insurance on the life of her husband, who died a short time ago. Within the last few years several members of the Knights of Honor have died in Weimar, and in each instance that lodge has paid the insurance promptly. This speaks well for the association, and is a practical showing of its merits as a life-insurance agency. It is not only an insurance agency, but its members are bound together in mutual ties of friendship. The lodge here is a creditable one, and no doubt the institution is a nobel one.\n\nWeimar Gimlet, December 17, 1885\n\nRivenburgh, Lewis A.\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nLewis, only son of Mr. and Mrs. E. D. Rivensburgh, died Thursday evening last, at 56 oclock, of congestion of the bowels, aged seven years and eighteen[six] month, after about one weeks intense suffering; and was buried June the 1st, in the Odd Fellows Rest. Rev. P. H. Hensley performed the funeral obsequies. Little Lewis is gone, the one that gave has taken him to His own tender care. The little fellow had had much sickness during his short pilgrimage upon this earth. None but God can tell how the devoted parents miss his childish prattling. May Gods mercy sustain them in this sad hour of bereavement. How consoling that though their darling cant come to them they can go to him, in just a little while.\n\nColorado Citizen, June 7, 1883\n\nRivera, Joshua Peter\n\nRivera\n\nInfant Joshua Peter Rivera, age 10 days, passed away December 28, at the Hermann Hospital in Houston.\n\nFuneral services were held December 31, at the Wallis Bible Church with Reverend Jerry McKinney officiating.

Robson. Mr. Robson was born in Dumfrees, Scotland, in 1828, where he was raised and educated. In 1847, he left Scotland, and came to seek a home in the sunny land of Texas. He arrived in Columbus the following year. He subsequently read law, obtained license and located in this place.\n\nMr. Robson was a man of high social qualities, splendid talent a highly cultivated mind, and was eminently worthy the position he occupied in social circles. He had his faults, who has not?\n\nMr. Robson was a true patriot, and loved his adopted country.\n\nIn his death, society has lost one of its brightest ornaments, our State one if its most useful citizens and the Bar one of its most accomplished and learned members.\n\nMay he who “tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,” be a husband and a father to the sorrowing wife and his cherub boys.

Nita Sue worked for Houston Oil and Minerals, Tenneco, and had in recent years, retired from Vinson & Elkins Law Firm, all in Houston, Texas.\n\nHer favorite job was working the door at Fitzgerald's Night Club in the Heights where she got paid for embracing one of her foremost passions, music. Not only did she get to meet many of her idols from her youth, like James Brown, Bo Diddley, Ruth Brown, and BB King, she befriended Stevie Ray Vaughan. His music, above all others, resonated with her and theirs was a special friendship that lasted until his untimely passing. Some of her happiest times were when she had Stevie Ray, band and crew over for a home-cooked meal.\n\nShe will be remembered most for her quickness to laugh, many times so hard she would cry, for her willingness to help others, for her work at The Nesbitt Memorial Library and The Live Oak Art Center, for her fastidious ways, for her collections of thousands of cookbooks, \"lp record albums\" and CDs, for her love of \"weird\" movies, for her love of Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers, for her love of Native American Indian history, for her love of Elizabet Ney's life and sculpture, for her love for her friends, and especially for her love for her daughter Amy and her three cats.\n\nIt is a comfort to think how at peace she must be now, reunited with her parents and daughter and probably getting to hear Stevie Ray play once more.
