        "text": "“Hollywood is a place where either you ride in a Rolls Royce or are run over by one.” (Gene Fowler Jr.)\n\nAny aficionado of the early films of Charlie Chaplin can’t fail to notice the ‘heavy’ presence of Eric Campbell in the comedian’s outstanding Mutual series of comedy shorts. Campbell plays a variety of bullies and rogues including a jewel thief, a larcenous shop manager, and an intimidating waiter. Yet the 6ft 5’ 300lb giant is noticeably absent from any of the films Chaplin subsequently made for First National. One might conclude that the actor and the notoriously mercurial filmmaker had a falling out, perhaps over pay, or that he had simply moved to another studio. The truth is rather more tragic; Campbell was one of Hollywood’s earliest victims of the automobile. Although James Dean and Jane Mansfield may be the most famous film stars to have died behind the wheel of the car, as this article reveals, they followed a long line of movie people who’d met similarly sad endings.\n\nCars and films developed simultaneously. In the 1890s, experimental engineers in both nascent industries came up with the first practical devices; the internal combustion engine and the movie camera respectively. In 1908, when film pioneers such as D.W. Griffith and Alice Guy Blaché were exploring the potentialities of narrative film-making, Henry Ford opened his first car-making assembly line. By 1915, there were as many car manufacturing companies in America as there were movie studios – well over a hundred. And by the end of the silent era, when more than 50 million Americans were going to the cinema each week, more than a quarter of that number owned a Ford motor vehicle. Aspiring actor-directors John and Francis Feeney even adopted the company name as their own!\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Model T became an extra and, in some cases, the star of many early motion pictures, especially those of the comedy studios of Mack Sennett and Hal Roach. Many of these films ended in a spectacular car chases. The flimsiness of the ‘Tin Lizzie’ was repeatedly lampooned by comedians, most notably Buster Keaton and Laurel & Hardy, in scenes where the vehicle they are travelling in simply falls apart. In fact, the use of cars in film comedy reflected the inherent dangers in early 20th century motoring – cars losing control or running over pedestrians and policemen, cars sinking into huge pot holes, exploding engines, and even road rage.\n\nEarly motion pictures also featured more exotic racing cars. For example, in Barney Oldfield’s Race for a Life, a 1913 Mack Sennett short, one of the era’s most renowned racing drivers and his machine help rescue Mabel Normand from the clutches of villainous Ford Sterling, who is attempting to run her over with a locomotive. Automotive racing fans Mack and Mabel would make at least two other films featuring professional race drivers. The most famous driver-actor of all was Wallace Reid, who before his untimely death in 1923 appeared in at least five racing films including Too Much Speed, and The Roaring Road.\n\nAt least part of the Roaring Twenties ‘roar’ was that of automobile engines. In 1927, two thirds of these belonged to the Model T, which was being produced at the rate of 1,000 a day and sold through a network of 10,000 Ford dealerships. However, the Model T was now having to compete against increasingly powerful and luxurious car makes such as Chrysler, Chevrolet, LaSalle, and Cadillac. Consequently, the decade also saw explosive growth in highway construction, based on the Pershing Map[1], as well as ancillary services such as gas stations, motels and roadside ‘drive-ins’. Promoted from within by its film community, California led the way in the country’s automobilization.\n\nThere was no greater screen chronicler of America’s burgeoning car culture, and the nascent problems attached to it than Harold Lloyd. In Get Out and Get Under (1920), he keeps his beloved Model T locked in a heated garage under canvas. In Hot Water (1924), he wrecks his brand new ‘Butterfly Six’ on its first outing, and in For Heaven’s Sake (1926), he writes off two $10,000 limousines in 48 hours; one of which he drives straight out of the showroom and into the path on an oncoming train.\n\nLloyd, like many of his contemporaries, was an avid collector of luxury cars. In the 1920s he owned an enclosed Pierce-Arrow, a soft-top Cunningham V8 ‘touring car’, A Rolls Royce Silver Ghost phaeton, and a red Buick roadster, bought for his wife Mildred and later traded in for a Packard. Arguably the most luxurious of all cars in this era was the Duesenberg; Lloyd had seriously considered buying a ‘Duesy’ before opting for the cheaper Packard.\n\nFew stars were never photographed beside their luxury cars. One of the first was Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, pictured next to his 1919 custom-built Pierce Arrow, estimated to have cost $32,000. While most stars favoured US brands; Douglas Fairbanks owned a V16 Cadillac; Gary Cooper, Joe E. Brown, and Clark Gable preferred ‘Duesies’; others opted for European makes; Al Jolson had a Mercedes S Model; Anita Page, a Isotta Fraschini roadster. In his film career, black actor Steppin Fetchit invariably portrayed servants. In real life, he owned a Cadillac Phaeton and employed his own chauffeur to drive it!\n\nFlorence Lawrence, the actress now widely acknowledged as the movie industry’s first recognised film star, was also arguably its earliest automobile fan. In fact, Lawrence is credited with designing some of the first automatic stop and turning indicators, features that would later become standard to all car models. In an era before brake and indicator lights, road traffic signals, and enforced driving regulations, it was unsurprising that traffic accidents became increasingly common during the 1910s. Over the course of the decade, the number of recorded deaths on American roads increased ten-fold to over 12,000 per annum. This figure had in turn doubled by 1927, the year the road mortality rate first rose above 20 per 100,000 of the population.\n\nUS Road fatalities had jumped by 50% alone between 1914 and 1915, a period that witnessed the first notable accidents involving movie people. The first casualty was Charles Hite, CEO of Thanhouser Corporation, one of the most successful of the east-coast film studios. The accident took place on 21st August 1914 at the height of his career and his company’s fortunes. Hite was heading to his home in New Rochelle at around 9pm when he lost control of his vehicle on or near 155th Street in Manhattan. The machine reportedly plunged 50ft off a section of viaduct, landing ‘wheels up’ on a sidewalk close to the Central Casino. Hite died of his injuries later that night in Harlem Hospital.\n\nThe accident that cost the life of actor Elmer Booth in Los Angeles on 16th June 1915 is remembered today primarily because of his co-passenger who survived; the future ‘horror’ director Tod Browning. The two men and another passenger, George Seigmann, were all at the time employed by D. W. Griffith at the Mutual Film Corporation. According to Motion Picture World, the accident occurred in fog, the vehicle driven by Browning running into the back of ‘a street-work car loaded with iron rails’. Booth was a popular Broadway comedian who’d acted in film alongside Mary Pickford. The extent of Browning’s physical injuries were not recorded but the accident may have left deep psychological scars and contributed to his later alcoholism.\n\nThe same year ended with the death of another movie-related individual, 24-year-old Charles Harron. According to one newspaper report, ‘moving picture actor’ Harron was killed while ‘speeding up his machine’ in an attempt to escape after having run down and ‘perhaps fatally’ injured a young woman. Two male passengers were also seriously injured in the accident, which occurred in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve.[2] In fact, Charles was the relatively unknown brother of Robert Harron, then one of the Biograph Company’s biggest stars. This tragedy probably contributed to the latter’s own death by suicide in 1920. He’d also lost his sister Tessie to Spanish Flu two years earlier.\n\nFlorence La Badie was arguably the first major movie star to die in a road traffic accident. She had started her film career at Biograph in 1909 before later signing with Thanhouser, where she became the studio’s most popular female star. Before her death, she’d made more than 160 films for the company, including serials and features in which she often performed her own stunts, earning her the studio epithet ‘Fearless Flo’. In 1916, she’d become one of the first female movie stars to own a custom-built automobile – an ivory-white Pullman “Junior” Deluxe Coupe – reportedly a gift from her grateful studio. On 28th August 1917, Florence was driving back to New York from Albany where she’d been to pick up her fiancé, the screenwriter Daniel Carson Goodman. Her car overturned at the bottom of a steep hill, the brakes evidently having failed. Goodman suffered only a broken leg, but Florence sustained more serious injuries when she was thrown out of the vehicle. The actress eventually succumbed to these injuries in hospital on 13th October. She was just 29. Her funeral in New York attracted hundreds of mourners, many from the east-coast film colony.\n\nThanks to his association with Charlie Chaplin, Eric Campbell may actually be better remembered today than the once top-billed La Badie. Alcohol seems to have played a major part in the actor’s death on 20th December 1917. Although his career was on the up; he had been chosen to appear in a forthcoming Mary Pickford production, Campbell’s personal life was in crisis. In the previous six months, he’d lost his wife to a sudden heart attack, and his 16-year-old daughter had been hit and seriously injured by a car. Struggling to come to terms with these personal tragedies, Campbell had hastily remarried, his choice of bride a supposedly notorious gold-digger named Pearl Gilman. Their marriage had lasted only two months before she sued for divorce.\n\nIt was not long afterwards that Eric had his fatal accident. He was driving along Wiltshire Boulevard in Beverley Hills with three other occupants at around 4am, evidently after a party. The car was traveling at more than 60mph when it crashed near the corner of Vermont, killing Campbell instantly. Had Campbell lived, he may well have had a role in Chaplin’s A Day’s Pleasure, in which the comedian lampooned the tribulations of downtown driving. As this film suggests, traffic lights had not yet been widely introduced in America, and turning at major intersections was still signaled manually by traffic police.\n\nA newspaper report about Franklin Ritchie’s death on 26th January 1918 described the 52-year-old as ‘a local automobile dealer and formerly a motion picture actor’ (The San Bernardino County Sun, 27 January 1918). Ritchie had in fact featured in dozens of movies between 1913 and 1917, his last being a Mary Miles Minter drama titled The Gentle Intruder. It seems Ritchie’s young wife Bertha (Herman) had also perished when their car had ‘skidded off a mountain road’ near Santa Barbara.\n\nAlthough road traffic accidents continued to increase nationally after the Great War, there were no further fatal incidents involving prominent members of the movie industry until 1926. That year saw the death of Harold Marvin Shaw. After a career on the stage, Tennessee-born Shaw had become a modestly successful motion picture director, making shorts for the Edison and Imp companies. In 1913, he’d moved to England to become chief producer for London Film Studios. During a nine-year stint with the company he’d worked on a number of interesting projects including wartime propaganda pictures and some of the earliest features made in South Africa.\n\nShaw was well-connected in the movie industry. His actress wife Edna Flugarth, whom he’d married in 1917, had been one of his regular leading ladies. Flugrath’s sisters, Viola Dana and Shirley Mason, were both recognized stars, and his two brothers-in-law were also former Edison film directors.[3] Shaw’s most recent film-work had been on A Fool’s Awakening for Metro Pictures, released in January 1924. At the time of his death, he was employed as Secretary of the Motion Picture Directors Association, whose members included John Ford, Allan Dwan, and William DeMille. Shaw was killed in Los Angeles on 30th January when the car he was travelling collided head on with another vehicle. He was 48 years old.\n\nOnly days later, while travelling between Lordsburg New Mexico and Palm Beach Florida, a car belonging to the actress Vera Steadman lost control and overturned. Also aboard was Steadman’s boss, the independent producer Al Christie, and Hughina Prevost, the mother of the starlet Marie Prevost. Steadman and Christie were not seriously hurt, but Mrs Prevost sustained a fatal back injury. The loss of her mother greatly affected Marie, who had recently had her lucrative contract with Warner Bros terminated, and whose marriage to her actor husband Kenneth Harlan was on the skids. These events contributed to Marie’s death from alcoholism in 1937, aged just 40.\n\nCharles Emmet Mack was barely as old as the century when killed on 17th March 1927. The young actor had started out in films as D. W. Griffiths’ ‘prop man’, before the director decided to try him out in front of the camera for his 1922 production Dream Street. By the time Mack signed for Warner Bros. in 1926, he was an established leading man, having starred alongside the likes of Pola Negri and Norma Shearer. In one of his last films, The First Auto, Mack had prophetically played a car-mad individual who enters a race and is seriously injured after his vehicle is sabotaged. To ensure authenticity and safety during the making of this film, the studio had signed Barney Oldfield as an adviser. Unfortunately, Oldfield could not advise the actors in their private motoring. Towards the end of filming, Mack was killed in a collision with another vehicle on a country road in Riverside County, California. Some reports say he was driving to the studio at the time.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the death of Gladys Brockwell. Although largely forgotten today, Gladys had appeared in Hollywood’s first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, released in July 1928. The veteran Brooklyn-born actress had begun her film career in the east with Lubin Studios in 1913. By 1918 she was a leading lady, being featured on the May cover of Motion Picture Classic. By the time of her death, age had reduced her acting work to supporting and character roles. Nevertheless, she was still a busy actress, appearing in more than 20 films during the last three years of her life. Notable among these was Harry Langdon’s Long Pants (1927), in which she played the comedian’s mother, and Twinkletoes (1926), a Colleen Moore drama in which she plays the wife of the prize-fighter ‘Twinks’ falls for."
