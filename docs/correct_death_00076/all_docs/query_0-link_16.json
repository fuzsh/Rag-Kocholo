Indeed, almost everyone has heard of a “second cousin once removed,” but many people cannot explain that relationship. Of course, a person might be more than once removed, as in third cousin, four times removed.\n\nIn short, the definition of cousins is two people who share a common ancestor. Here are a few definitions of cousin relationships:\n\nFirst Cousin: Your first cousins are the people in your family who have at least one of the same grandparents as you. In other words, they are the children of your aunts and uncles.\n\nSecond Cousin: Your second cousins are the people in your family who share the same great-grandparent with you.\n\nThird, Fourth, and Fifth Cousins: Your third cousins share at least one great-great-grandparent, fourth cousins share a great-great-great-grandparent, and so on.\n\nRemoved: When the word “removed” is used to describe a relationship, it indicates that the two people are from different generations. “Once removed” indicates a difference of one generation, “twice removed” indicates a difference of two generations, and so forth.\n\nFor example, the child of your first cousin is your first cousin, once removed. That is, your cousin’s child would be “almost” your first cousin, except that he or she is one generation removed from that relationship. Likewise, the grandchild of your first cousin is your first cousin, twice removed (two generations removed from being a first cousin).\n\nMany people confuse the term “first cousin, once removed” with “second cousin.” The two are not the same.\n\nThe descendants of A.V. and Gertrude Smith\n\nI.

April 12, 1932, Los Angeles, California, Wed: March 21, 1952, Los Angeles, California to: Roberta “Bobbi” Grace Hardeman, b. July 22, 1930, Ventura, California\n\nKen and Bobbi Wold – Lifetime of Service Award from Life Pacific College – March, 2009 Ken and Bobbi Wold graduated from L.I.F.E. Bible College in Los Angeles in 1952 and have been in active public ministry since. They pastured churches in Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, California, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon until 1992.\n\nIn 1992 they were asked by Foursquare Missions International to serve as missionaries to Papua New Guinea (PNG). While in PNG, Ken served as the FMI Representative and Advisor to the newly emerging national church. Ken and Bobbi taught in PNG Bible Colleges and traveled though out the country teaching pastoral and leadership development.\n\nFMI’s policy of bringing missionaries home from the field at age 65 brought the Wolds back to the United States in January of 1997. Not being quite ready to retire however, Ken and Bobbi were asked to continue serving as field representatives for Foursquare Missions International, a position they have served in ever since. They have ministered in countries such as England, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Myanmar on short-term assignments, as well as speaking in U.S. churches on behalf of FMI.\n\nKen and Bobbi Wold have purposed to leave an inheritance for future generations.

They eloped two weeks after her graduation and were married in Salmon City, Idaho, on June 10, 1935; but they returned to Kalispell, and in the stuff of family legend, told no-one for six months.\n\nRuby and Elmer moved to the Rogue Valley from Southern California in 1946, and purchased twelve acres on the outskirts of Phoenix, Oregon. There they built three houses, raised their children, and educated and entertained their grandchildren and great-grandchildren for the next six decades.\n\nRuby faced her final illness with grace, courage and humor, presiding from her bed, and welcoming many dozens of visitors, friends and family. She will be remembered as her husband’s most precious jewel, a warm and loving mother and grandmother, a faithful friend, a gracious hostess, an avid emailer, and an enthusiastic blogger (ggsmith.blogspot.com).\n\nA memorial service will be held Saturday, February 9, at 2:00 pm at Calvary Church Assembly of God in Jacksonville, 525 North 5th Street (541-899-1015). There will be a visitation on Friday from 4:00 – 8:00 pm, and on Saturday from 9:00 – 11:00 am, at Conger Morris in Medford, 715 West Main Street (541-772-7111).\n\nElmer’s final remarks read by grandson Kenneth:\n\nEven though this has been by far the most heart-crushing experience I have ever had to go through, if it will help my loved ones to remember their promises that they will meet my darling and me in heaven, it will be worth any temporary pain that I have to endure. If my blessed Lord Jesus will get any glory from it all, I can only say, “Thank you Jesus.” And though the best half of me has been taken away, I know that my Redeemer lives and I will see my sweetheart again. She promised me that she would meet me at the gate and we would worship Him together.\n\nEpitaph for Ruby Smith\n\nGiven by Kenneth Smith, February 9, 2008 – Calvary Church, Jacksonville, Oregon\n\nIn the days since my grandmother died, I’ve been meditating on a poem by C. S. Lewis, written after the death of his wife, and now carved on her gravestone in Oxford, England. C. S. Lewis writes,\n\nHere the whole world (stars, water, air\n\nReflected in a single mind)\n\nLike cast-off clothes was left behind\n\nIn ashes, yet with hope that she\n\nRe-born from holy poverty,\n\nIn Lenten lands, hereafter may,\n\nResume them on her easter day.\n\nEarly in the morning of February 4th, Ruby Helen Lucille Smith left behind, like cast-off clothes, the mortal body she had carried with grace since 1917. The husband with whom she had shared a bed and a life for 72 years was with her, and held her hand, and felt the Holy Spirit fill the room even as her own spirit departed.\n\nSeveral hours later, as our family gathered around her deathbed to say one last good-bye, my mind was flooded with the memories of how that mortal body had served her over those years, and how she had used that body to serve others. So many meals: so many wounds bandaged, tears dried, cookies baked, diapers changed, grandchildren hugged, emails sent and demanded. How one quiet woman could represent so much activity and goodness is one of the mysteries of love.\n\nWe are gathered here today to celebrate the life, mourn the death, and rejoice in the homecoming of an extraordinary woman. Whether we knew her as friend, aunt, grandmother, mother or loving wife, I can think of no better way to honor her than to take a few moments to look through her eyes, to see the whole world as it was reflected in the single mind of Ruby Smith.\n\nHer Friends\n\nDeep and lasting friendships formed a constant background to my grandmother’s world. Ruby Smith did not establish temporary relationships, or make friends out of convenience. The friends she made when she worked at Harry and David’s in the 1940’s, or when she attended Ashland Christian Center in the 1950’s, or when she worked at the orthopedic clinic in the 60’s and 70’s, remained her friends for life. The number of these friendships necessarily diminished over the years, as she and Elmer remained healthy and vigorous, while more and more of their friends passed on.\n\nBut as anyone who was a recipient of her emails can testify, her days, and Elmer’s, were passed in frequent communication with old friends, visiting those who had grown sick, and helping those no longer able to fend for themselves. I do not believe that any friend of Ruby’s could ever have complained of neglect or inattention; and a great many people in Ruby’s world had cause to be thankful for her consistent hospitality and quiet kindness.\n\nHer Twins\n\nMy grandmother’s world revolved around her family. When my grandfather rushed her to the hospital on a warm July day in 1940, the two of them had little idea what was in store. The labor drugs knocked her out, and when she awoke, the nurse asked, “Did you know that you had twins?” Still groggy, Ruby responded, “I didn’t know I had any.”\n\nRuby assumed her new role as the mother of twin boys with gusto. For the next 18 years, she cooked, cleaned, mended, kissed, coddled, scolded, and chased her boys into adulthood. In 1957, my famously frugal grandparents splurged on a brand-new ’57 Chevy for their two sons, and this was typical: they rarely bought anything for themselves, but nothing was too good for their boys.\n\nHer Family\n\nWhen Larry and Lloyd left home, married and had families of their own, Ruby found her world expanding once again. As the decades passed, through marriages, births, adoptions and virtual adoptions, she found herself the matriarch of a substantial and growing tribe. And again, although they rarely bought anything for themselves, they helped their grandchildren in any way that they could. Numerous house down payments, new cars, new computers, or college tuition payments had their origin in the bank account of a retired couple who never made more than $8 / hour.\n\nHer Email\n\nAs the years passed, keeping the scattered and sundry members of her family connected became a substantial challenge. But many decades ago, she had instituted a tradition of regular letters to all and sundry, a tradition which she maintained until her 91st birthday. They started as hand-written letters, copied at the local post office, and sent out manually. About 15 years ago, we bought her an electric typewriter; her letters were perhaps longer after that, and of course typewritten, but otherwise unchanged.\n\nIt was probably 10 years ago that we pitched in and bought her first computer. She was horrified at the thought, and even called Larry in a panic: “They’ve bought me a computer, and they’re bringing it over, and I need you to make them stop!” Nevertheless, we set it up for her, and walked her through turning it on. We showed her how to point and click with a mouse, showed her how to use a word processor, and how to access the Internet with a browser. She remained unimpressed.\n\nThen we showed her email.\n\nWe had no idea we were about to create a monster. We should have known by the way her breath quickened when she saw us adding email addresses to the “To:” line. She watched us change fonts, and then email backgrounds, her eyes narrowing. She sat down. We showed her how easy it was to reply to her emails, and how easily she could reply to ours. The look on her face grew sharp, and hungry. She wanted this.\n\nThe monster was born.\n\nTen years, three computers, two printers, and many thousands of emails later, we learned that the monster must be fed. If Grandma didn’t get twenty or thirty emails a day, she felt neglected. She forwarded emails like a fiend. She kept track of who had sent her emails recently and who hadn’t. Woe betide the grandson who neglected to email his grandmother, for his neglect should be broadcast to the entire family, and then some.\n\nAs to the letters: they were just the daily life of a woman who had seen 90 summers in her lifetime, and 90 winters; who had watched three generations grow up in her house; who had cooked more meals than I know how to count and fed more hungry descendants than I care to; who watched the husband she loved dearly for 75 years grow old alongside her. It was just life; but it was life.\n\nHer Husband\n\nRuby’s world held nothing of greater worth than a skinny red-haired refugee from the Depression, fresh off the Salmon River, with an empty wallet and few prospects for filling it. Since their first walk home, and their first kiss under a Montana sky, Ruby had eyes for little else in this world. Most of you know that two weeks after she graduated from high school, Ruby and Elmer eloped – and that when they returned to Kalispell, they kept their marriage a secret for six months. It is the stuff of family legend that Ruby’s mother began to suspect something amiss only when Elmer began coming down from Ruby’s bedroom for breakfast.\n\nRuby and her husband were inseparable. One story of many will suffice. Until this week, I believe that the last time my grandparents spent a night apart was twelve years ago, in 1996. I was moving up to Oregon from Southern California, and it seemed entirely natural to me to ask my blind 83-year old grandfather to come down and help me pack. We left Los Angeles late, after many delays, and my grandfather kept me company as I drove the moving van through the night. We arrived in Phoenix early the next morning, and were both exhausted as we drove up to their house, parked and climbed out.\n\nAs the eldest grandchild, I had grown used to my grandmother rushing out of the house to hug me whenever I came to visit, so I wasn’t surprised to see the door fly open and Ruby run down the driveway. But this time she ran right past me and practically leaped into her husband’s waiting arms. Only after some minutes of fussing over him did she manage a quick hug for me; and then immediately returned to Elmer’s arm, hardly to be shook off. An eldest grandchild was a poor substitute for the husband she had missed so badly.\n\nThese stories are typical of their relationship: they loved each other passionately, unreasonably, completely. The Great Depression, wars and rumors of wars, social revolutions and real ones, passed by in the outside world, leaving their love untouched. Children were born, then grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; even age itself began to take its toll, but the strength of their love was renewed like the eagle’s.\n\nHer Death\n\nFor the Christian, death will always have two faces. It is true – it is blessedly true – that we rejoice, because Ruby is now with her Lord; and so long as the Lord tarries, the beatific vision which Ruby is now experiencing can be achieved in no other way than by walking the lonely valley of death. But make no mistake: death is an enemy, and we fool ourselves if we think otherwise, or belittle its importance. If death is not important, neither is birth. Death rips us apart from the world which God made good, and in which God placed us.\n\nAnd Ruby’s death was in this respect no exception. My grandmother did not want to die. “I never expected this,” I heard her say repeatedly during her final weeks. “This is so sudden.” Until three weeks ago, she had not seen a doctor for six years, and had never so much as taken an antibiotic. Her perpetual good health made the sudden weakness that took her all the more alarming. She worried about her dumpy, her house, the sudden flood of guests. Ruby’s world was full of friends, family, and a husband whom she loved dearly, and it was not a world that she wished to leave behind.\n\nEven so, even as her weakness grew and her own death grew more imminent, my grandmother revealed a grace that we had always suspected, and a sense of humor that we had not. She kept us laughing through our tears as she retold old stories, and a few new ones. She harangued her eldest great-grandchild into getting his hair cut. She refused to put to rest the rumor that she had actually proposed to Elmer. She revealed the existence of a stash of coffee she had long kept secret from my grandfather.\n\nWhen her husband was being stubborn about something, she turned to him, wagged her finger, and said, “In a few days, you’ll be the boss, but for right now, it’s still me!”\n\nAt one point, as her illness dragged on, and her family refused to budge from her bedside, she said, “I can just imagine the headline on my obituary: ‘FINALLY’.”\n\nMy grandmother’s death came three weeks after her diagnosis, and it was a blessing; but after 91 years, it was too soon. She died as she lived: much loved, surrounded by family, and fussing just a little.\n\nHer New World\n\nThe whole world, as reflected in the single mind of Ruby Helen Lucille Smith, was as clear as daybreak, as simple as a stream, profound as the stars. If you had looked through her eyes, you would have seen a world as broad as a lifetime of friendship, as narrow and focused as her family, and as plain as the ten acres of earth on which she and her husband built a lifetime together. This is the world that Ruby Smith has cast off; but she cast it off in hope, with the faith that one day, when the world is made new, she will clothe herself with it anew: when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality.\n\nIn that reborn world, we know that God will wipe every tear from our eyes. But that world is not this world, and in this world, our tears are appropriate. So let us grieve for our loss; but Lord, do not let us grieve as those who have no hope. “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first; and then, we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Therefore, comfort one another with these words.”\n\nA. Larry Bennett Smith, born July 3, 1940, Los Angeles, California.

I waited until after Logan’s birth to inform Helen that I loved the name because my son is named after Canada’s highest mountain, and the second highest peak in North America. J In my mind, both of my son’s are named after big mountains.\n\nNow that I have climbed my eldest son’s namesake, I have a new project to dream about for some time in the future. Maybe Everest can climb Mt. Logan with me? I don’t have a lot of years left for extreme climbing, so I might have to climb Logan sooner, rather than later…\n\n2. Amber Lee Smith, b.

Adopted.\n\n“Caedmon” is obviously a unique name these days, but it has a long and distinguished history. Specifically, Cædmon was the name of a 7th century English monk who wrote the earliest extant English poetry. The work for which he is chiefly known is Caedmon’s Hymn\n\nNow let me praise the keeper of Heaven’s kingdom,\n\nthe might of the Creator, and his thought,\n\nthe work of the Father of glory, how each of wonders\n\nthe Eternal Lord established in the beginning.\n\nHe first created for the sons of men\n\nHeaven as a roof, the holy Creator,\n\nthen Middle-earth the keeper of mankind,\n\nthe Eternal Lord, afterwards made,\n\nthe earth for men, the Almighty Lord.\n\nGalena has liked that name ever since she first heard it (in the Sunday school class where she and I first met). So it seemed appropriate for our son. Against its many benefits, we do acknowledge that the name has two chief disadvantages: (1) We and our son will forever be spelling it out to folks the first time they hear it, and (2) it sounds like “cave man”. Oh well. We figure that Caedmon’s cousin Everest will suffer similar indignities, in having to explain, “No, not Everett like the city: Everest, like the mountain. (Sigh.)”\n\nAs for why he has two middle names, it’s because we couldn’t agree on what it should be. Galena wanted “Dante”, because it was a name that Dorothy had chosen, and I wanted “Christian”, because it was a family name on my side. We compromised by choosing both. We figured that being a little ornery was also a family tradition.\n\nThe name – Brendan: Caedmon was named after a 7th century English monk, so we decided to continue the monk theme, and went with Brendan, a 6th century Irish monk who was famous for his nautical travels (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan). Javier – Galena has always liked the name Javier, and we thought that picking a Hispanic name would be a way to honor the Latino part of his heritage. Michael – Michael was the name of his birth father.\n\n3. Keith Lloyd Smith, born – b. May 2, 1971, Grants Pass, Oregon.\n\na. Kaitlyn Rhianna Smith, b. Feb. 21, 1997, Pasadena, California\n\nb.
