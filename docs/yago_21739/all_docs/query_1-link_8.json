        "text": "Mistakenly referring to the title as Track 39, the 22 Jul 1983 DV reported that principal photography would take place in Dallas, TX, with director Joseph Losey, and featuring actress Vanessa Redgrave, actor Lee Marvin, and actress Louise Fletcher. The 26 Jul 1983 DV announced the film would begin principal photography on 15 Aug 1983 in Dallas, TX, on an estimated budget of $2,100,000. The drama department of the British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) and Pennies From Heaven Co. were listed as the film’s production companies. The 29 Jul 1983 DV production chart stated filming was to start on 16 Aug 1983, one day later than previously reported. Also attached to the production were director of photography Ken Westbury and executive producer Kenith Trodd. A month later, the 24 Aug 1983 Var, again referring to the film as Track 39, reported that “financing fell apart,” and Joseph Losey had moved on to direct the British film Steaming (1985), starring Redgrave. However, an article in the 14 Dec 1983 Var reported that filming on the picture “was shelved” due to a disagreement between the BBC and their “rule that all BBC films be made in 16m[m],” and the film’s producers wanting to shoot 35mm film.\n\nThree years later, a 19 Nov 1986 DV item reported principal photography on Track 29 would begin in early 1987 in Texas with Nicolas Roeg directing and featuring Roeg’s wife, actress Theresa Russell. While the 24 Feb 1987 HR announced that filming would begin in Apr 1987, an article in the 7 Apr 1987 HR reported a start date of 5 May 1987 at “a yet-to-be decided U.S. location,” with a tentative release scheduled for Feb 1988.\n\nFilming began on 7 May 1987 in North Carolina, as stated in the 28 Apr 1987 HR production chart. Production notes in AMPAS library files state filming took place on locations around Wilmington, NC, as well as at the Dino De Laurentiis Studios. Filming also took place at the North Carolina Trainorama, an annual railroad train-themed festival, on 21 Jun 1987. The 29 Jul 1987 Var reported that the picture would film in London, England “after North Carolina locations.” According to production notes, filming lasted approximately seven weeks on an accelerated “six-day” week schedule. The 8 Sep 1987 HR announced that principal photography was complete. The 15 Sep 1988 LAT reported the film’s budget to be approximately $3 million.\n\nThe film was screened on 15 May 1988 at the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France, as noted in the 25 May 1988 Var review. An article in the 18 May 1988 Var reported that producer Rick McCallum believed the film would be released in the U.S. in late Jul 1988. However, the picture was released on 9 Sep 1988 in New York City, as noted in the NYT review published that day. The following week, an advertisement in the 9-15 Sep 1988 LA Weekly announced the picture was opening on 14 Sep 1988 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe 25 May 1988 Var review noted the film was eighty-six minutes long, while reviews in the 14 Sep 1988 HR and 9 Sep 1988 NYT listed the film’s running time as ninety minutes. The print viewed for this record was ninety minutes.\n\nAn article in the 15 Sep 1988 LAT noted that the film was based on a television play called Schmoedipus, written by screenwriter Dennis Potter in 1974 for the BBC.\n\nEnd credits state “Special Thanks to: Hans Zimmer and Allan Corduner.” End credits list the following the clips used in the film: “Dangermouse,” created by Cosgrove Hall Productions of Great Britain; “Cape Fear,” courtesy of Universal City Studios; “Rocky & Bullwinkle, Tennessee Tuxedo, Underdog, King Leonardo,” courtesy of Filmtel International Corporation; “Azalea Festival,” courtesy of WWAY-TV Wilmington N.C. End credits also state: “The Producer gratefully acknowledges the assistance of everyone at Deg, Nelly Nugiel, Bobby Blues, Compaq Computer Ltd., David & Ann Caudle, Neil Harrison, Carol at Crimpers, the Pinnacle Care Center, PM Promotions, D.A.R.E. Inc., the cities of Wilmington & Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, and all at 26 Cadogan Square.” The picture concludes with the following: “Made at Deg Film Studios, Wilmington, North Carolina.”\n\nLess\n\nHousewife Linda Henry lives in a small Southern town with her husband, Dr. Henry Henry, a gerontologist physician and model railroad train enthusiast.

In the morning, Linda tells Henry she wants to have a child, but Henry tells her that it would be impossible. Linda believes he is being selfish, loving his model trains more than her. Frustrated, Henry leaves for work, with Linda yelling that she will drown herself in their swimming pool. She dives into the water, but floats to the surface. Suddenly, Martin appears and asks if her maiden name was “Linda Alice Carter.” When Linda says it was, Martin announces that he is her son. To convince her, Martin tells her that he was born on the seventh of May, and adopted by a cleaning woman employed by Linda’s mother, who moved to England. Linda believes him and says she has always thought about what would have happened if she had raised Martin. Later, Linda gets into her car and Martin appears in the backseat. When she tells him they are going to the clinic to see Henry, Martin gets upset and begs her not to go. At a restaurant, Linda drinks and tells Martin she used to dream about telling him fairy tales. When the waiter asks if anything is the wrong, Linda responds she was not talking to him. After the waiter excuses himself, Linda tells Martin her story about going to the traveling carnival on her fifteenth birthday: after flirting with the man in charge of the bumper cars, who had “MOTHER” tattooed on his chest, she was taken into the woods and raped. As Linda cries over the memory, the waiter and bartender watch as she talks to herself. Elsewhere, Henry and his mistress, Nurse Stein, flirt with each other as they give an injection to Mr. Ennis, a patient. Afterward, alone in an examination room, Henry lies face down on a bed as Nurse Stein slaps his backside. Later, Henry meets with Dr. Bernard Fairmont, who informs Henry that he gave Mr. Ennis the wrong medication. Henry claims it was an accident, but Fairmont knows about Henry and Nurse Stein’s illicit affair, and fires them. Leaving the clinic, Henry and Nurse Stein arrive at the annual model train convention, Trainorama, where Henry is nervous about presenting the keynote address. However, Henry is revitalized when the speech is a success. After the convention, Henry tells Nurse Stein that he has been offered a new job and wants her leave town with him. Meanwhile, Linda and Martin return home. Martin begins to act childish, but when Linda yells at him, he kisses her. In her bedroom, Linda continues drinking while Martin writes “MOTHER” across his chest with a permanent marker and announces he plans to start reliving his childhood with his real mother. Finding Henry’s model train set in another room, Martin destroys it. Afterward, he kisses Linda, but when she opens her eyes, no one is there. Pouring herself another drink, Linda passes out and hears Martin saying goodbye. Later, Linda awakens in a panic and telephones Arlanda, asking her to come over. When Arlanda arrives, Linda tells her that she may be losing her mind and thinks Martin is still inside the house. As Arlanda checks for an intruder, Henry arrives. Seeing how Linda is acting, Henry tells Arlanda she is not mentally stable. Frustrated, Henry hits Linda across the face, but Arlanda stops him. Worried that Linda may have done something to his model trains, Henry goes upstairs, but finds the trains untouched. Linda walks Arlanda to the door and, though confused, Arlanda leaves. As Henry calls for Linda in his train room, she grabs a butcher knife. Inside the room, Martin jumps out of a closet and repeatedly stabs Henry with a butcher knife. Later in her bedroom, Linda tells herself she always knew her son would come back. In the morning, Linda drives away from the house with a suitcase, while a bloodstain spreads across the ceiling under the model train room.\n\nLess"
