        "text": "Making his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg (1928 - 2018) quickly became known for directing about 14 big screen films between 1970 and 2007. The films include: \"Performance\" (1970), \" Walkabout\" (1971), \"Glastonbury Fayre\" (1972), \"Don't Look Now\" (1973), \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976), \"Bad Timing\" (1980), \"Eureka\" (1983), \"Insignificance\" (1985), \"Castaway\" (1986), \"Track 29\" (1988), \"The Witches\" (1990), \"Cold Heaven\" (1991), \"Two Deaths\" (1995), and \"Puffball\" (2007).\n\nAfter starting his career as a cinematographer — Roeg worked the second unit camera on the film \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962). After that experience, he soon found himself in the director’s chair. With a dynamic visual style, Roeg made a name for himself in 1970s - 1990s by producing a diverse number of slick, clever, and somewhat uniquely off-kilter types of films, at least if you believe what his film critics wrote about him.\n\nRoeg died on November 23, 2018, in London, England of natural causes at the age of 90."
