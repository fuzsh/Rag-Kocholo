        "text": "Director Nicolas Roeg has passed away at the age of 90. He started off as an immaculate DP in the early '60s — responsible for two of the very best photographed big studio films of that era (\"Lawrence of Arabia,\" and \"Doctor Zhivago\"). However, he truly made a name for himself as the director of some significant groundbreakers the following decade. His terrific artistic streak of films as a director in the early to mid ’70s (\"Don't Look Now,\" \"Walkabout\" and \"The Man Who Feel to Earth\") was impressive, especially \"Don't Look Now,\" a film which has had significant impact on horror films. It proved that they could be more than just slash and dash narratives — the film evoked a psychology and instinctive surrealism that all but changed the genre and is still highly influential for directors today.\n\nIn the '80s and '90s he took a bit of a nosedive, artistically speaking, with \"Bad Timing,\" \"Eureka,\" and \"Insignificance\" the latter of which was a questionable, light-hearted Albert Einstein movie. Those three failures basically doomed him in the industry, especially with producers tightening the noose on directors more and more after the '70s maverick era, to the point where it was practically impossible for Roeg to continue making the live-wire risk-takers of the 70s. Although, his 1990 adaptation of Roal Dahl's \"The Witches\" has gained a small cult-following over the years. Regardless, his legacy was built, and will remain intact, for the body of work he created between the years 1970-1976.\n\nFilms as director"
