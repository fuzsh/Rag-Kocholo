        "text": "Nic Roeg was born in London (1928) and from the fifties onwards moved through the (international) film world as an assistant, cameraman, screenwriter and, ultimately, director.\n\nThe technically virtuoso style of his greatest films (Performance, 1970, with Donald Cammell; Walkabout, 1971; The Man Who Fell to Earth, 1976 and Bad Timing, 1980) was a result of his experience as (second unit) cameraman for sixty-eight productions such as Lawrence of Arabia, the Poe adaptation The Masque of the Red Death, Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 and Bond film Casino Royale.\n\ndon't look now\n\nA married couple grieving the recent death of their little daughter are in Venice when they encounter two elderly sisters, one of whom claims to be psychic and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger.\n\nThe husband at first dismisses their claims but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself."
