Sometime later, the \"Actress” (Marilyn Monroe) visits the Professor in his hotel room, at three in the morning. Upon their first meeting, she goes to great lengths to prove to him that she understands his Theory of Relativity. After a night of conversation, she admits she would like to make love to him. He allows her to spend the night, but turns down her offer. Meanwhile, the Senator spends the night with a prostitute who looks like the Actress, and elsewhere, the \"Ballplayer” (Joe DiMaggio) drinks alone at a bar, surrounded by images of his wife, the Actress. The Professor finally agrees to have sex with the Actress, but as she disrobes, her husband knocks on the door and interrupts them. She reluctantly lets him into the room, and he fails to recognize the well-known professor, thinking he is a therapist. The Actress is embarrassed by her ignorant husband, and refuses to leave with him. When he asks if she wants to end their marriage, she denies it, and agrees to return home with him, but first locks herself in the bathroom, as the Ballplayer tells the Professor about his jealousy. When she passes out in the bathroom, her husband carries her to the bed, and the Professor leaves them alone in his room. Later, the Actress awakens, and professes her love for her husband. She asks him to have a baby, and after he falls asleep, she whispers that she believes she is already pregnant. She falls asleep next to him, but he leaves her sometime later. In the morning, the Senator enters the Professor’s room to deliver a search warrant, and finds the Actress alone in his bed. He threatens to destroy the Professor’s work, and she begs him not to, offering to sleep with him. However, he responds by punching her in the stomach. The Professor returns, refusing to cooperate with the Senator, and throws his work out the hotel window. In the other room, the Actress suffers a miscarriage. The Ballplayer returns to make amends with his wife, appealing to her through the bathroom door, but she says it is over between them. Later, the Professor cheerfully tells the Actress that he threw his papers out the window. She cannot understand why he would destroy his life’s work, and accuses him of hiding something, prompting to him to admit guilt over the atomic bomb that his theories helped create. The Actress consoles him, and argues that the worst is over. Before she leaves, the Professor imagines another bomb going off, destroying the hotel room, and burning her alive.\n\nLess"
