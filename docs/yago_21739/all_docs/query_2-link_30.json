        "text": "Critically acclaimed English director and cinematographer Nicolas Roeg passed away on Friday night. He was 90 years old. Famous for his offbeat—and sometimes controversial—horror and sci-fi films, he was best known for his films The Man Who Fell to Earth, The Witches, and Don’t Look Now. The news of his death was confirmed by his son, Nicolas Roeg Jr., to the BBC.\n\nRoeg was born in London. After briefly serving in the military as a projectionist, he began his career in the film industry in 1947, where he worked his way up in MGM’s London Studios as a clapper boy, assistant operator, and lighting cameraman. Eventually, he was the cinematographer on smaller-budget films, and then a second-unit lenser on films such as Lawrence of Arabia. His first film was 1970’s Performance, starring Mick Jagger, a project that Variety recalled was almost nixed by Warner Bros. when studio execs found the gangster thriller “incomprehensible”—it went on to become a widely acclaimed classic. It wasn’t his only controversy: Roeg’s 1973 thriller Don’t Look Now caused uproar for its controversial sex scene, and his 1990 film The Witches is considered to be one of the most terrifying children’s movies ever.\n\nRoeg’s works were renowned for his distinctive cinematography style, which was often nontraditionally moody and beautifully dark. He also directed some of the biggest stars of his time period, including Jagger, Anjelica Huston, and David Bowie, whom he worked with on 1976’s The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which the star plays an alien who has come to Earth in search of water to save his home planet."
