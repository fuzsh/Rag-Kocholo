        "text": "Perusing films is something that even the greatest filmmakers need to keep doing. Using other people’s art as a touchstone allows filmmakers to get familiar with their likes, dislikes, and personal motivations in their filmmaking. As true as it may be of any director, this rings true with Wes Anderson, whose love of movies is apparent in his work with actors and visuals in every production, no matter the runtime.\n\nAs a visual storyteller with features and shorts under his belt, Anderson’s taste is wide and varied. He has, of course, singled out a few that stand out the most to him. Anderson took to Letterboxd to list 24 short films that are on his must-watch list.\n\nFrom an old-school cartoon that has charmed millions since the 1950s to various collections of shorts from directors across the ages, this list of works is well worth watching. Don’t take our word for it—take it from Anderson!\n\nRead More: The Fascinatingly Small Worlds in Wes Anderson Films\n\nShort Films Recommended By Wes Anderson\n\nSimon of the Desert (1965) | Directed by Luis Buñuel, Written by Luis Buñuel, Julio Alejandro\n\nThe Postmaster (1961) | Written and Directed by Satyajit Ray\n\nVive Le Tour (1962) | Written and Directed by Louis Malle\n\nThe House Is Black (1963) | Written and Directed by Forugh Farrokhzad\n\nThe Gold of Naples (1954) | Directed by Vittorio De Sica, Written by Vittorio De Sica, Cesare Zavattini, Giuseppe Marotta\n\nChristo’s Valley Curtain (1974) | Directed by Albert Maysles, Ellen Giffard, and David Maysles\n\nThe Girl Chewing Gum (1976) | Directed by John Smith\n\nReady… Set..

Some are closer to recognizable narratives, while others are experimental vignettes or bordering the line of documentary work. Those differences help to enrich a storyteller, and Wes Anderson—like other filmmakers—chooses to celebrate those enrichments, using them to inform and inspire his work.\n\nIf you are looking for something new, something fun, or something to inspire your filmmaking, start by sitting down with the shorts on this list!"
