Eli explains his love for his deep cut pick of a film that breaks its own rules and complicates its horror elements.

Eli digs into the film’s comedic sensibilities, finding similarities with fellow Japanese director Takeshi Kitano, while Wilson finds himself “so sad” contending with Kurosawa’s trend of nihilism across his body of work.

The DC Trio are in for a treat this week as we savor Frederick Wiseman’s latest documentary, MENUS PLAISIRS - LES TROIGROS, a scrumptious looking film about three French restaurants, and the family that runs it. From the bustling kitchen to the tense moments shared between members of the Troigros dynasty, the trio immerses themselves in this four-hour culinary exploration. Ben and Eli ponder the central question of the work and Wilson finds a strong appreciation of Wiseman’s perspective on the food industry.\n\nMENUS PLAISIRS - LES TROIGROS is out now in theaters.

In the first episode, Wilson shares his love for a national cinema that is deeply tied to his roots. What better way to be introduced to Pinoy cinema than through a biopic of one of the nation's most infamous historical figures? Eli's intrigue in José Rizal's life and his choices add to the discussion, while Ben brings his own perspectives with nostalgic \"watched this in class\" vibes from the flick.\n\nWhat is your deep cut historical biopic?

Mani Ratnam completes his magnum opus with Ponniyin Selvan: Part II and we're back in the theatre again for more palace intrigue, romantic entanglements, and some of that signature Ratnam flair. Can Ratnam one-up himself with part two?

Rajamouli worldwide phenom RRR, and it’s a doozy. Hear the Deep Cut Trio talk about why Rajamouli’s brand of action filmmaking has entranced audiences, and why Ben and Wilson have this film at the top of their 2022 year end lists, while Eli explains why he prefers Rajamouli’s previous outings. Most importantly, they discuss the important and dangerous imagery and narrative co-opting that Rajamouli deploys in this film, and how it is used to fuel the fire of right wing Hindu nationalists in India.\n\nRead Ritesh Babu’s writeup on RRR.\n\nRead Wang Bing’s State of Cinema 2022 writeup:\n\nJoin our ⁠DiscoRRRd⁠⁠⁠⁠ server⁠!

Just in time for the 2023 Oscars, Ben, Wilson, and Eli mop up the mess left by superheroes and conductors, stop motion shells and Na’vi, interdimensional travelers and cannibals, mourners and partiers. By breaking down the year’s big trends–– directors fictionalizing their autobiographies, Marvel sinking slowly, rich filmmakers attempting to pillory wealth inequality–– the Deep Cut trio gets a handle on what made 2022 so weird. The boys get personal, too, talking about the movies and moments from last year that shaped who they are as moviegoers and friends.

You might even call them quirky. We begin our series by learning about her long list of artistic endeavours and discuss the connotations of \"quirk\" in the context of July's films before diving in to her most recent and most critically acclaimed work yet: Kajillionaire. Ben highlights Evan Rachel Wood's physically specific performance as \"Old Dolio\", Wilson celebrates Emile Mossieri's emotionally vibrant soundtrack to July's little \"heist of the heart,\" while Eli tries his best to understand what makes the movie so special to his fellow co-hosts.\n\nGet riled up in our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\nWilson, Ben, and Eli are once again joined by director and friend of the podcast Russell Goldman to talk about his experience and the best movies he saw at this year’s Sundance Film Festival!

Our first Mani Ratnam Deep Cut Upkeep episode gets heated, and battle lines are drawn between hosts.

The DC Trio welcomes back distinguished guest and friend Thanmye Lagudu to launch a discussion on the legendary Masala blockbuster director S. S. Rajamouli (of this year’s international hit, RRR). There’s no better a popular pick than the renowned historical fantasy duology, Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion, based on the Sanskrit epic poem Mahabharata. In their epic conversation, Thanmye shares his deep connection to the movies of Rajamouli, Wilson breaks down what makes the action so spectacular, Ben notes the benefits of non-photorealistic CGI, and Eli explains how Rajamouli writes truly smart characters. Ultimately, Thanmye hopes for a new path forward in cinephilia that fully respects the depth and goals of Indian popular cinema.\n\nFight alongside your best friends in our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\nAbderrahmane Sissako sets his late father’s backyard as a courtroom for the injustices of economic neocolonialism in his 2006 drama Bamako, our second of three forays into the work of the Malian/Mauritanian master director.

Wilson opens up about how his Deep Cut Pick is a forlorn love letter to Hong Kong, his \"city of heartbreak.\" Meanwhile, Eli shares the pop music playlist that Wilson made the DC trio, and Ben shocks them both with his opinion on what may be Wong's last great film.

After splitting from his brother Ethan last year, Joel Coen went back to the book and then threw it out the window with his divisive, postmodern take on Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Glorious set design, gorgeous cinematography, but methinks that none of the Deep Cut Trio are convinced: Wilson isn’t moved by Denzel Washington’s lead performance, Ben finds the heightened artifice pointless, and Eli finds Coen’s examination of the themes in the text to be lacking.

How did Eli meet Jane Campion, director of The Power of the Dog? Why is there neither pizza nor licorice in Licorice Pizza? Do Disney and Marvel own our eyeballs? Are we getting Succession burnout?

On this episode, Wilson, Ben, and Eli ask one simple question: what the heck happened here? Ben sees it as a narrative problem, where we don’t get access to Diana’s perspective. Eli thinks it’s a lack of empathy for a real-life figure, where the movie gawks at Diana. And Wilson? He’s got a thought or two about the color timing.\n\nWe only talk about beloved British character actor Timothy Spall on our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\nThings heat up in our most divisive episode to date! Lana Wachowski returns to the Matrix franchise after nearly two decades to put out her most personal work to date. Does it pay off? We’ll have to see as Ben, Eli and Wilson duke it out.

As they skirt the perils of accursed Film Twitter Discourse (where'd unironically horny cinema go???), Ben explores each type of thrill sequence that coheres into a tight script, Eli is wowed by the Wachowskis' subversion of the noir genre, and Wilson can’t keep the words \"Paul Verhoeven\" from escaping his mouth.

Ben compares his Deep Cut Pick to Haynes’ critically acclaimed, subsequent melodrama Carol to show the breadth of the director’s approach to melodrama, but Eli and Wilson aren’t so convinced. Wilson feels that it’s a shallow imitation of the Women’s Picture auteur Douglas Sirk, while Eli questions the movie’s sociopolitical outlook from the early 2000’s. Can Ben open the discussion to the movie’s merits? What’s a color score? And will Eli ever shut up about Psycho (1998)?\n\nWistfully contemplate your loves of yore in our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\nRead Scott Higgins’ essay on the color score in Far From Heaven (Chapter 9, pages 101-113).\n\nStep right up as we guess The Price of Salt in our coverage of Todd Hayne’s Carol (2015). Recently crowned by BFI as the “best LGBT film of all time”, the Deep Cut Trio revisit this critical favorite and find its place in the New Queer Cinema Canon. Ben gets lost in the eyes of leading ladies Blanchett and Mara, Wilson considers the film’s legacy in the wake of recent LGBT film standouts, and Eli feels personally attacked for all of us by the characterization of a certain John Magaro character...\n\nGet flung out of space in our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n\nJust in time for the release of Spencer, the Deep Cut trio revisits Jackie, the dreamy 2016 biopic that made Chilean director Pablo Larraín an (art)household name. Eli entrees the film by looking at construction of Jackie the character as purposefully distinct from the real Jackie Kennedy-Onassis, while Wilson remarks on Larraín’s use of physical space to reflect the character’s emotions. Ben goes into the felt pleasures of the score, production design, and compelling performances. Come for the Jackie Kennedy-Onassis voices, stay for the tangent about Doctor Who.\n\nTake a live, televised tour of our free Patreon, discord server, and all our links @ ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠www.deepcutpod.com⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ –– it’s the people’s house, after all.\n\nWhat would you choose? Love…… or terrorism? The trio are joined by special guest Thanmye Lagudu to talk about Mani Ratnam’s most popular film, Dil Se, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Manisha Koirala. Wilson marvels at Ratnam’s ability to trojan horse a radical ideology into mainstream Bollywood screens, Eli wraps his head around the audience’s critical distance from the leading man, and Ben pushes against the film’s allegorical layering of meaning through musical numbers. Whether you love Dil Se or hate it, Thanmye encourages cinephiles to explore the work of the master, Mani Ratnam.\n\nFollow Thanmye on Twitter!\n\nIs Mani Ratnam your OG number 1?
