        "text": "1986 film by Nicolas Roeg\n\nFor the 2000 film starring Tom Hanks, see Cast Away.\n\nCastawayDirected byNicolas RoegScreenplay byAllan ScottBased onCastaway\n\nby Lucy IrvineProduced byRick McCallumStarringCinematographyHarvey HarrisonEdited byTony LawsonMusic byStanley Myers and Hans Zimmer\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nCannon Screen Entertainment\n\nUnited British Artists\n\nCastaway Films Ltd.\n\nDistributed byColumbia-Cannon-Warner Distributors[1]\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n117 minutesCountryUnited KingdomLanguageEnglishBox office$1 million (UK/US)\n\nCastaway is a 1986 British biographical-drama film directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Amanda Donohoe and Oliver Reed.[2] It was adapted from the eponymous 1984 book by Lucy Irvine, telling of her experiences of staying for a year with writer Gerald Kingsland on the isolated island of Tuin, between New Guinea and Australia.\n\nReal life inspiration\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1981, Lucy Irvine responded to an advertisement placed by writer Gerald Kingsland, and they became self-imposed castaways for a year on the isolated and uninhabited island of Tuin, in the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia. Chosen by Kingsland from over 50 applicants, Irvine agreed to marry him to satisfy immigration restrictions before they travelled to Tuin. She was 25 years old, and he was 49. After a year, they returned home, and in 1983, she published her account of the experience in Castaway, which was later used as the basis for the film.\n\nWhen Irvine met director Nicolas Roeg, he felt her story was perfect material for telling a relationship between an older man and a younger woman. It never was intended to be exactly like her experience, as Roeg felt Irvine would be too personally involved then. Irvine was positive about the film, stating she was pleased with Donohoe, Reed and Roeg.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nOliver Reed as Gerald Kingsland\n\nAmanda Donohoe as Lucy Irvine\n\nGeorgina Hale as Sister Saint Margaret\n\nFrances Barber as Sister Saint Winifred\n\nTony Rickards as Jason\n\nTodd Rippon as Rod\n\nVirginia Hey as Janice\n\nIn 2011, Donohoe recalled her experience working with Reed, stating: 'Well, naked on a desert island with Oliver Reed – it was a tabloid fantasy, wasn't it? He was an alcoholic and his behaviour was erratic, but he was always a courteous and good actor. His personal life wasn't working but he never crossed any lines professionally.'[4]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film opens with a song by English artist Kate Bush, \"Be Kind to My Mistakes\". A slightly edited version later appeared on the 1997 re-release of her album Hounds of Love. The soundtrack begins with a different version of the same song, which was also released as a 7-inch single. The rest of the soundtrack album is instrumental and composed by Stanley Myers. It received a limited CD release in 2013.[citation needed]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film grossed £440,281 in the United Kingdom.[5] Including its gross from the United States, the film grossed over $1 million.\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nThe movie received a mixed reception from critics.[6][7][8][9]\n\nLeslie Halliwell said: \"Extended absurdity uncharacteristic of its director.\"[10]\n\nThe Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"Both Amanda Donohoe and Oliver Reed cope well with their roles as the castaway and the sex-mad, middle-aged man who is her companion, but in the end you can't help feeling the nudity is only there to spice up a tale of two selfish people who probably deserved each other.\"[11]\n\nVariety wrote: \"Newcomer Amanda Donohoe spends most of the pic displaying the absence of bikini marks on her body (palm trees always seem to obscure the vital parts of Oliver Reed as Gerald Kingsland), and she copes well with a character whose motives and methods for going to the tiny desert island remain dubious. Reed gives the performance of his career as a sexually frustrated middle-aged man in search of sun and sex, and is admirably complemented by Amanda Donohoe as the determined but fickle object of his lust. Photography is excellent (especially underwater scenes) but though Castaway is a great ad for the tropical Seychelles, it won’t be remembered as a Nicolas Roeg classic.\"[12]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
