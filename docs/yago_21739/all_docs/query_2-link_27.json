        "text": "Director Nicolas Roeg, whose films include Don't Look Now and Performance, has died at the age of 90.\n\nIn a career spanning six decades, he was celebrated for his original and controversial film-making.\n\nHis 1973 psychological thriller Don't Look Now caused controversy for its graphic sex scenes.\n\nRoeg also directed Mick Jagger in the crime drama Performance and David Bowie in the science fiction movie The Man Who Fell To Earth.\n\nHis son, Nicolas Roeg Jr, said his father died on Friday night. \"He was a genuine dad,\" he said.\n\n\"He just had his 90th birthday in August,\" he added.\n\nDonald Sutherland, who starred in Don't Look Now and named one of his sons Roeg, paid tribute to him.\n\n\"He is a fearless visionary, always was, always will be,\" he said.\n\n\"He was a liberating joy to work for. I fell in love with him then and will love him forever.\"\n\n'Roeg bewitched and bewildered'\n\nNicolas Roeg was one of the most original film-makers the UK has ever produced.\n\nHis early experience as a cinematographer brought a stunning visual quality to his work.\n\nHe often exasperated the critics and gained a reputation as being hard on his actors.\n\nAnd he took a delight in jumbling scenes and time to both bewitch and bewilder his audiences.\n\nRead the full obituary here\n\nBorn in St John's Wood in north London in 1928, Roeg started in the film industry making tea and operating the clapper board at Marylebone Studios.\n\nHis directorial debut came in 1970 when he filmed Performance, sharing the director's role with Donald Cammell.\n\nThe explicit scenes of violence and drug-taking caused the film's release to be delayed by two years.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Front Row in 2013, he said false rumours that Don't Look Now included a real sex scene were \"very flattering\" because it meant audiences thought the film was authentic.\n\n\"What you are looking for in anything is some sort of truth,\" he said.\n\nEdgar Wright, the British director of Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver, was among those who paid tribute to \"a master of the art\".\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
