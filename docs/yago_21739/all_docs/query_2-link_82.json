        "text": "Next January, the American Cinematheque and BAFTA Los Angeles will present Nicolas Roeg Remembered, a seven-film retrospective of the British director, who died this November. Noted for his adult depictions of sexuality (explicit but not exploitative), Roeg was more an art-house icon than a genre filmmaker, but many of his films dabbled in horror, fantasy, and science fiction themes. Don’t Look Now is a highbrow horror film starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie that builds to a devastating finale. Cold Heaven is a bizarre religious thriller in which Catholicism is presented as another of the many alternate realities visible in Roeg’s oeuvre. The Man Who Fell to Earth, starring David Bowie as an alien, is perhaps the director’s best-known work, but The Witches, produced by Jim Henson’s company, is Roeg’s most accessible film – a wicked, funny, scary adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s book, intended for family audiences. Even Roeg’s non-genre titles suggest a certain psychedelic mysticism: his stock-in-trade was using montage to suggest connections between events separated by time and space, hinting at some sort of subliminal awareness beyond our usual perceptions.\n\nNicolas Roeg Remembered will run from Thursday, January 17 through Sunday, January 20, at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. The complete schedule of screenings includes:\n\nWalkabout/The Man Who Fell to Earth with cinematographer Tony Richmond in person- January 17\n\nThe Witches with actress Anjelica Huston in person – January 18\n\nDon’t Look Now/Cold Heaven – January 19\n\nBad Timing/Eureka – January 20\n\nAll presentations start at 7:30pm\n\nGet more info at the American Cinemathque’s webpage for the event."
