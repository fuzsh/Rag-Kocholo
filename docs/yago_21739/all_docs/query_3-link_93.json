        "text": "Reading more about the new Criterion release of PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID I am cheered by the presence of the Sam Peckinpah Vault Cut, and though I’m saddened that the film elements couldn’t be rendered in 4K — the decayed image would simply fall apart on the screen at that resolution — I’m excited about the prospect of a cut arguably closer to Peckinpah’s intentions than the restoration and certainly the studio release. Above is a framegrab.\n\nIl Cinema Ritrovato sparked some thoughts about restorations. I’m all for them, of course. But I have this fear…\n\n(Christopher Challis, in his eighties, introducing OH… ROSALINDA!! said, “I understand this is a restored film… I don’t quite know what that means, but when I look in the shaving mirror each morning I do wish there was a restoration programme for ageing cameramen…”)\n\nAt the end of Truffaut’s FAHRENHEIT 451 we meet the book people, who memorise the books that are being burned. One dying man is teaching a child RL Stevenson’s The Weir of Hermiston. In an interview, ageing cinematographer pointed out that already the boy is making mistakes, “So you know that it’s all going to be lost.”\n\nI always felt that I *didn’t* quite know that, that maybe they hadn’t made it obvious enough, but as I looked at the (beautiful) scene again I realised I was an idiot. The boy makes many noticeable flubs. Also, brilliantly, they seem to be genuine accidents. The kid is making all these freakish facial expression as he tries to retrieve the words from his memory bank, and these are obvious real child things — not the kind of faces anyone would pull while ACTING. You’d be ashamed.\n\nThe eyes rolling UP is a real physiological/psychological thing — looking for the information which ought to be UP HERE SOMEWHERE.\n\nIt reminds me quite strongly of Jean-Pierre Leaud’s audition footage for THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS, where his face is all over the place in a beautiful unselfconscious display of randomly firing neurons and shrugging muscles:\n\nAnyway, the FAHRENHEIT kid, whose name is Earl Younger (hi, Earl!) is getting the words wrong, and progressively more wrong. The last line, “And he died as he thought he would, while the first snows of winter fell,” is an addition, and perhaps a mistake by Truffaut. It takes advantage of the accidental snowfall which began during filming and which totally MAKES THE SCENE, along with Bernard Herrmann’s lovely score, but that seems too on-the-nose. We don’t need the book to connect with the snow AND the father’s death.\n\nAnyway, at Il Cinema Ritrovato, I had the pleasure of seeing Truffaut’s SHOOT THE PIANIST, a film I’ve always liked. I think Truffaut’s first three films are great and it’s probably only with FAHRENHEIT 451 that he begins to show the unevenness that would make him an off-again-on-again filmmaker for the rest of his career.\n\nYou can see Raoul Coutard fulfilling Howard Hawks’ advice to his cinematographers: give me three great scenes and you can have two dull ones and one bad one. The final closeup of Charles Aznavour is out of focus. But look at the shot above, which lasts scant seconds…\n\nSTP is based on a novel by David Goodis, almost a version of Conrad’s Victory. As far as I can tell, Goodis tells the same story all the time — a man has a chance at a great life, but he blows it. He winds up in the gutter. He gets a chance of a new love — and again, tragedy overtakes him.\n\nEarly in the film there’s a song, and Truffaut does a nouvelle vague whimsical gimmick, subtitling the lyrics one word at a time:\n\nI remember watching this as a teenager and my dad got very annoyed at the subs, which were kind of too fast to read. “How are we supposed to read THAT?” “You’re not, really… it’s in French, you see?” He couldn’t see the point of that nonsense and got even more annoyed.\n\nAnyway, I thought of FAHRENHEIT 451’s depiction of creeping errors in Bologna when the film played, and the subtitles WERE GONE. Scrubbed away by some restorer who couldn’t see the point of them either.\n\nSo I have this fear… restoration after restoration eating away at the individuality of movies, “correcting” mistakes, “improving” things, doing stuff the filmmaker “would surely have done if he’d been able,” or just making silly mistakes. So that one day we will press PLAY (just by thinking it) and CASABLANCA will come on, in colour and widescreen and 3D and Odorama and starring Yul Brynner and Buddy Hackett.\n\nAnd what will the alien archaeologists make of that?\n\nTo the extent that most film criticism discusses the lens at all, you’re more likely to find discussions of Orson Welles and Gregg Toland’s use of the wide angle lens combined with deep focus in CITIZEN KANE, than any discussion of the properties of the long lens. This is partly because fairly long lenses were fairly standard for close-ups before KANE came along and changed the rules, and partly because Toland and Welles successfully publicised their work, so that the ideas behind it were out there, accessible to critics.\n\nThe ideas behind the long-lens closeup were far less discussed, because the approach had been commonplace for a long time. It’s easy to see why: the long lens both flattens and flatters the subject, avoiding any of the fish-eye distortion of the wide angle, which tends to warp and uglify the face, making mountains out of moles (notable exception: AMELIE. Camera tests established that Audrey Tatou’s face could look quirkily attractive through a wide lens, provided the camera was slightly above eye-level, so that her big forehead got the emphasis).\n\nAlso, unless you have massive amounts of light so you can stop down (as in the infinite, sun-blasted spaces of Leone’s westerns), the long lens tends to result in a shallow depth of field, useful for separating the subject from the background. Since the movie screen is flat, anything that produces an illusion of depth can be handy (deep focus has a contradictory quality of flatness, since everything is equally sharp).\n\nBut beauty is hard to talk about, and the idea that deep focus results in the illusion of depth is ingrained.\n\nThese shots of Julie Christie, taken by cinematographer Nicholas Roeg for Richard Lester’s bleakly romantic chronicle of a near-miss love affair in 1967 San Francisco, PETULIA, show another possibility of the long lens. Lester is fond (going at least as far back as THE KNACK, his 4th film) of using out-of-focus foreground material as well as background, situating the face, partially eclipsed, within layers of gleaming blur. It contributes to the kaleidoscopic quality of his work (often remarked upon, seldom analysed in detail) and strikes me as a purely photographic conceit, like the starburst filter, rather than a realistic one. You CAN get a shot like the above with the human eye, by sticking something between you and what you’re looking at, and then mentally “cropping” the image so as to enlarge one detail of your view, but would you? The effect achieved here has little of nothing to do with realism, which is probably why it wasn’t much used before the ’60s and all that mucking about with zoom lenses (Sternberg may be an exception, since he loved filming through layers of smoke and streamers and veils and branches and rain and whatever else he could think of).\n\nIn the same way that golden age Hollywood films didn’t like to show people talking in extreme longshot but with closeup sound (an approach which probably came in thanks to the radio mic, although dubbing could have produced the same result earlier), and felt that car scenes needed to be shot from INSIDE the windscreen, hence all those process shots whenever anybody went for a drive, a subconscious sense of naturalism probably stopped directors and cinematographers from exploiting the long lens in just this way (so it makes sense that Sternberg wouldn’t be put off).\n\nThanks to Chris Schneider, who suggested I write something about PETULIA. I wasn’t sure where to start (it’s a very rich film), but zooming through it in search of frame-grabs inspired these musings).\n\nGround-breaking sexual shenanigans from Jules Dassin’s PHAEDRA. Faced with the challenging task of manufacturing sexual chemistry between his wife, Melina Mercouri, and Anthony Perkins, Dassin pulls out all the stops. The result is like a MOVIE MASH-UP of love scene clichés — soft focus; roaring fireplace; clenching hands; rain battering on window; the sweeping music of Mikis Theodorakis on the gramophone (there will be NO remarks about Anthony Perkins and Greek love in this post. Apart from this one). By the end it’s a wonder there’s a stick of furniture intact in that apartment.\n\nDavid Thomson in his BioDic of Film, writes, “In good company, and a little drunk, HE WHO MUST DIE, PHAEDRA and 10.30PM SUMMER might cure would-be suicides.” I’ll allow that Dassin skirts the edges of absurdity in 10.30, and PHAEDRA looks like it plunges headlong into a basin of ludicrous pomp, but I still get a kick out of this scene. The effect is overdone but the individual elements are orchestrated with great skill — I like the compositions and editing and music.\n\nI heard of an English teacher one time who would object to purple passages of sexual action in DH Lawrence with the words, “But it’s not LIKE that!” which is a good argument, though not necessarily one that should take precedence over all other concerns. I don’t think it applies to Dassin — taken metaphorically, his sex scene could be seen as quite authentic. Unless what you’re after is complete authenticity (which would mean SOUND EFFECTS, and none of us wants THAT) evoking the corny (there’s rarely anything ORIGINAL about sex) but overwhelming emotions of what General Ripper calls “the physical act of love” seems reasonable, and doing it without fear of looking silly seems at least commendable.\n\nKubrick told Michel Ciment that the exhilerating and goofy William Tell Overture time-lapse threesome in CLOCKWORK ORANGE was in part a reaction to the way movies tend to solemnize sex, and he had a point there, but sex is very often quite humourless. There’s plenty of room for giggling at the start, but there comes a point where that could be OFF-PUTTING.\n\nSo, if sex is overwhelming, serious, and best treated in a stylised way — Dassin is surely the man for the job. He was dismissed for his “strained seriousness” by Andrew Sarris, but that seems somehow wrong: it’s no strain for Dassin to be serious. His lighter films from this period, TOPKAPI and NEVER ON SUNDAY, seem far more effortful (though I love TOPKAPI and make allowances for NOS).\n\nDassin was a Sexual Pioneer! The bisexual triangle of 10.30PM SUMMER must have been strong stuff for 1966. I also think there’s enough textual evidence in his work to deduce a keen interest in sado-masochism (whippings abound in THE LAW, RIFIFI…)\n\nSex, in the movies, is fraught with difficulty. Maybe because it’s universal but also distinctly personal. There’s a cringe-making story of a well-known actor who, in his first sex scene, grabbed his partner by the hair and began slamming her head off the pillow. “Cut! What are you doing?” He was totally perplexed. What’s the problem? Doesn’t everybody do it this way?\n\nEverybody does it every which way! The first sex scene in a mainstream movie is supposed to be in ECSTASY, in 1933. Director Gustav Machatý attempted to evoke an orgasmic reaction from his star Hedy Lamarr by pricking her feet with a pin. “That would just be really annoying,” says my partner. “Maybe everybody Gustav Machatý slept with found him really annoying.”\n\nAnother technique — in RED ROAD, an actress appears to receive oral sex. In reality she was holding half a peach between her thighs for her co-star to munch on. Hey, it’s a system!\n\nIn SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, Barbet Schroeder wanted to film a more than usually convincing blow-job, so he purchased a dildo for Jennifer Jason Leigh to fellate: the hope was to show she had SOMETHING in her mouth without offending the censor by showing WHAT. But, perhaps fearful of insulting his male lead, Schroeder acquired a jaw-breakingly enormous plastic dinosaur appendage…\n\nDON’T LOOK NOW is justly famous for it’s cinematically beautiful love scene. One story I heard, from former producer/director turned educationalist Brent MacGregor, who heard it from an assistant editor, casts an interesting light on the scene. Supposedly, Donald Sutherland was more “into” the sex scene than co-star Julie Christie, which resulted in (a) her walking off the set after one take and (b) Warren Beatty bursting into the cutting room and attempting to beat up director Nicolas Roeg.\n\nI don’t generally credit such gossip, but a couple of aspects of it at least make sense — if you look at the actual lovemaking, MOST of what you see is consistent with a single hand-held shot. But bits of the shot were unusable as the cameraman was clambering over the bed, etc. With only one continuous take, partly no good, Roeg was forced to intercut, and all he could intercut WITH was neutral material, the couple dressing to go out (which would have to have been shot deliberately for the purpose, later, if we buy this version of events). And thus is born a thing of immense beauty and poetic resonance.\n\nDonald Sutherland reports being locked in that bedroom “for hours” with Roeg, Christie, and an extremely noisy unblimped camera. But what’s seen in the film isn’t consistent with such a prolonged shoot. And what’s been rumoured about Roeg’s swinging lifestyle might be consistent with the desire to go a little further than usual in the name of realism…\n\n(Also — looking through the scene for not-too-explicit frame grabs, I realised that it’s quite a bit more explicit than I’d previously thought. Much of the “stronger stuff” is compositionally decentred and hard to spot due to the pace of cutting, but… let’s just say I hope Julie Christie remembered to bring half a peach to the set…)"
