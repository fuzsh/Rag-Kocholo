        "text": "This interview was first published in 2013, and has been republished following Nicolas Roeg’s death at the age of 90\n\nAll over Nicolas Roeg’s desk, covering every inch of its surface, are yellow Post-it notes with thoughts and observations written on them. “Man’s creativity has been the dominant force in his destruction,” says one. “Is the period of time it took to be recognised the same as it takes to be forgotten?’ reads another.\n\nWhen Roeg’s wife comes in with a cup of coffee, she gives a despairing laugh as she looks for somewhere to put it down. Roeg’s conversation turns out to be rather like his desk – scattered. Wisps of conversation come along and after a while you realise you’d better grab anything you can, even if the next one is unlikely to bear any relation to it.\n\nMuch the same could be said of his films. Everything is fractured, topsy-turvy. Time hurtles about, sometimes forwards, sometimes backwards, sometimes leapfrogging wildly. In the best of his films – Performance, Walkabout, Don’t Look Now, The Man Who Fell to Earth – the effect is so unsettling that the viewer stumbles out feeling as if the world has been blown apart and reassembled before their eyes.\n\nHe is 85 now, a small, gnomish-looking man with sticky-out ears. He sits surrounded by books in the study of his house in Notting Hill, a stone’s throw from Powis Square, where he shot Performance back in 1969. It’s several years since Roeg made his last feature – an adaptation of Fay Weldon’s novel Puffball – but he insists he hasn’t given up directing. Indeed, he says he’s working on a script right now.\n\nIn the meantime he’s written a book, or a kind of book, called The World Is Ever Changing. He finds it a lot easier to say what it isn’t than what it is — it’s not an autobiography, or a book of philosophy, or a guide to how to make movies. Rather, it’s a series of reflections on his life and work.\n\nWhat really excites him, though, isn’t the printed version, but the ebook. This comes complete with clips from his films, shots of Roeg talking and even photos of the Post-it notes on his desk. Typically, it’s not designed to be read in sequential order. Instead, readers can dip in and out, letting themselves be guided by the two factors that Roeg says have governed his life – accident and chance.\n\nBoth started buffeting him about almost from the moment he was born. In the book, he alludes – in characteristically glancing style – to the fact that his father was a very distant man who suffered some (unspecified) disaster when Roeg was a child. “My father was an extraordinary man,” Roeg says, staring fixedly at a point over my left shoulder. “He had some investments in South Africa and they went…”\n\nHe pauses, and gives a lengthy sigh. “I find this very difficult to talk about… It’s a very private thing.” There’s another long pause. Time passes – sequentially – and then he says, “When my sister and I were very young, my father used to tell us fairy stories that he’d made up. My mother was always telling him that he should write them down, but he would say, 'Well, they’ve all been done before. There are so many blooming books in the world – why should I write another one?’”\n\nIt’s tempting to think this remark must have had a profound effect on Roeg. Certainly, when he started directing, he was determined to carve out his own distinct furrow. It was pure chance, he says, that he ever got into the film business. There was a studio opposite his parents’ house in Marylebone and he got a casual job there after he left school.\n\nRoeg went on to become a highly distinguished lighting cameraman – most notably for David Lean, first on Lawrence of Arabia, then on Dr Zhivago. However, his zeal for experimentation didn’t go down well with Lean. Matters came to a head when they were shooting a battle sequence on Dr Zhivago. “I remember David turning to me and saying, 'You think I’m old-fashioned, don’t you?’ I said no, I didn’t – and actually I meant it. Even so, I knew that a curtain had come down.” Shortly after, he was sacked.\n\nRoeg insists that he had no idea what sort of films he wanted to make when he became a director. Instead he fell into directing when Donald Cammell, who’d written the original script for Performance, needed someone with visual flair to collaborate with.\n\nEventually, the film made legends of Roeg and Cammell, but at the time it almost finished them both. At an early screening, one Warner Bros executive was reportedly so appalled by the sight of Mick Jagger and James Fox exchanging sexual partners, clothes and identities that he threw up. On the film’s release, the critic of Life magazine described Performance as “the most completely worthless film I have ever seen since I began reviewing”.\n\n“I’ve still got that somewhere,” says Roeg. “It’s one of the few cuttings I’ve ever kept. Warner Bros threatened to sue me for not delivering the film they were expecting. It affected me very badly. It was difficult to hang onto self-belief. Self-belief needs a bit of camaraderie and there wasn’t much of that about. What made it worst of all was that the people criticising the film clearly didn’t get it at all.”\n\nNow, of course, the wheel has come full circle and, as Roeg notes drily, he’s lost count of the people who claim to have played a critical role in Performance’s success. Is it a film you look back on with fondness and pride? I wonder. “I don’t look back on any film I’ve done with fondness or pride,” he says promptly. “I look back on my films, and on the past generally…” He shakes his head in a bewildered sort of way. “I can only use the phrase, 'Well, I’m damned’.”\n\nAfter the Performance furore, the sensible thing might have been to play it safe – except that’s not Roeg’s style. “I’ve never tried to enhance my reputation,” he says. “Never moved upwards from one thing to another. That sort of thing is of no interest to me at all.” Instead he collaborated with the playwright Edward Bond on a film about a brother and sister who get lost in the Australian outback. When Bond delivered the script, Roeg thought it was the best thing he’d ever read. The one snag was that it was 14 pages long – a normal script is around 90 pages.\n\nThe film’s producers thought Roeg was having them on when they saw it, and were only appeased when he bulked it out with waffly descriptions – “I remember 'Clouds like bruises on a virgin’s arm’ was one of them.”\n\nWalkabout is the film in which Roeg’s fondness for playing around with time really comes to the fore. In one sequence the boy – played by Roeg’s son, Luc – sees a buffalo falling over and dying. Roeg then runs the film backwards so that the buffalo is seen getting back to its feet. “It seemed perfectly natural to me that the boy should want to bring the animal back to life in his head.”\n\nThen came what many consider to be his masterpiece – his adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s short story “Don’t Look Now”, with Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as the grief-struck parents who think they see their dead daughter on a trip to Venice.\n\n“After we’d finished the film, Daphne du Maurier asked to see it. I remember the producer telling me not to come along to the screening because I’d changed it so much. I said I hadn’t changed it – I’d changed some details, but not the heart of the piece. Anyway, I didn’t go along for some reason. Then a week or so later I got a very nice letter from du Maurier saying how much she’d enjoyed it.”\n\nIn all his films Roeg has tended to be pretty unsparing towards his actors. In Performance, James Fox was so disturbed by the experience that he became a Christian evangelist for almost 10 years. On Bad Timing – a film which the boss of its distributors, Rank, called “a sick film made by sick people for sick people” – almost everyone threatened to walk off, including its star, Art Garfunkel. This was after Roeg shot for 24 hours without a break.\n\nDid he think of himself as a ruthless director? One who relishes taking actors to the brink? Roeg looks surprised. “No,” he says slowly. “No, I don’t think I’m like that at all. All I’ve ever tried to do is be truthful to the work I’m doing.”\n\nArt Garfunkel may have run for the hills as soon as Bad Timing was over, but Roeg went on to marry his co-star, Theresa Russell. They divorced some years later, although there are still lots of pictures of her in the house – including one large Cubist-style nude photograph.\n\nLooking at it, I find myself wondering what Roeg must be like to be married to. Challenging, I would have thought, if only for the fact that he deals almost exclusively in tangents. And while he doesn’t appear egotistical he does seem to live in a strangely solipsistic, sealed universe, so obsessed by film that it’s almost as if he’s trussed up in it.\n\nAccident and chance may have shaped his life – but neither can explain why Roeg has worked with rock stars on three of his four greatest films. He did so, he says, because they have a greater ability to light up the screen than actors. Indeed, during the filming of The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which David Bowie played an extraterrestrial who goes by the name of Mr Newton, Roeg says he “really came to believe that Bowie was a man who had come to Earth from another galaxy. His actual social behaviour was extraordinary – he hardly mixed with anyone at all. He seemed to be alone – which is what Newton is in the film – isolated and alone.”\n\nAs well as being obsessed by film, Roeg has had a lifelong interest in mysticism – something that’s most apparent in Don’t Look Now. Once, he was visited by a medium who told him that she believed Roeg had been her mother in a past life. What’s more, the medium said, she had witnessed him giving birth to her in a vision. Far from being alarmed, Roeg was intrigued. “In that moment,” he recalls, “my own sense of awareness seemed dislocated and I was conscious of being in the presence of the scene she was describing, as though I was dreaming it.” Does his belief, or partial belief, in past lives, make him more sanguine about the thought of dying?, I ask. He gives me another surprised look.\n\n“No, no, I’m very anxious about it. But the other day an extraordinary thing happened. I was in here looking for a book and I pulled one out by mistake. As I had it in my hands, a page fell to the floor. When I picked it up, I saw that it said, 'Mysteries of Life, Death and Futurity. Things not generally known’. Then I saw that the book had my father’s name written on the flyleaf. Now, that’s just too mystical for me to think it’s coincidence.”\n\nRoeg won’t reveal what his latest film project is about, but he does say that he’s been thinking about fairy tales a lot lately – perhaps because this too goes back to his father. “In particular, I’ve been thinking about the way fairy tales end: 'They went off hand in hand to live happily ever after’. It’s a fantastic way to end a story, isn’t it? Maybe that’ll be the ending of the last movie I ever make.\n\n“But of course you never know if the couple will actually be happy or not. They might, or they might be getting divorced 18 months later.” Roeg peers glassily into the middle distance. “You just don’t know,” he says. “You just don’t know at all.”"
