Theresa Russell stars in regal drag for then-husband Roeg in Verdi’s “Un ballo in maschera;” Bridget Fonda and James Mathers powerfully channel Wagner’s “Liebestod” (from “Tristan and Isolde”) for Roddam; Godard goes to the gym for Lully’s “Armide;” and, in Bryden’s portion, threaded throughout, John Hurt interprets Leoncavallo’s “I pagliacci” as a faded actor."
