        "text": "I remember watching 'THE LONG DISTANCE PIANO PLAYER' as a highlight of a fan club meeting, many years ago (mid '90s I guess).\n\nArthur and Kinks in the 60s:\n\nI’ve followed this thread closely, but I haven’t much to add that hasn’t already been so well articulated by Mark and others. When I started following it, Face to Face was my favorite Kinks album, but it was replaced as we explored each successive album. My top three are virtually interchangeable; Arthur tops the list at the moment because it has fewer skippable tracks for me.\n\nArthur\n\nSomething Else\n\nVGPS\n\nFace to Face\n\nKink Kontroversy\n\nKinda Kinks\n\nKinks\n\nArthur strikes me as a transitional album: Ray is taking one more look backwards, while starting to develop the Kinks sound of the early 70s. Arthur has less stylistic variety than the previous two albums, but the \"mini-suite\" nature of some of the tracks keeps things interesting musically.\n\nIt is often noted that even as a young man, Ray wrote from the perspective of a much older person and expressed a yearning for earlier, simpler times. But it makes sense: by the time he was 21, he had lost two sisters (one to sudden death, one to Australia), was under constant pressure to deliver hits and album tracks, was embroiled in a lawsuit that kept his songwriting earnings in escrow, was constantly touring with a rowdy, fractious band in order to make money (but had been banned from the lucrative U.S. market), and was in a marriage that he had not planned on, with a family to support. For someone who wasn’t “like everybody else” and had fought to avoid a structured, conventional life, he must have felt trapped in many ways. It’s no wonder he wanted to escape into a simpler past, and that his resentment against the Establishment and the music business increasingly became a common theme in his writing.\n\nAs far as favorite Kinks songs of the 60s, I was initially going to limit to 10 but singles took most of the slots, so I too did 25. It was a tough exercise, and could change with the next track I play!\n\nYou Really Got Me\n\nAll Day and All of the Night\n\nTired of Waiting for You\n\nSee My Friends\n\nTill the End of the Day\n\nSunny Afternoon\n\nDandy\n\nToo Much on My Mind\n\nRainy Day in June\n\nDavid Watts\n\nDeath of a Clown\n\nSituation Vacant\n\nWaterloo Sunset\n\nDays\n\nDo You Remember Walter\n\nPicture Book\n\nAnimal Farm\n\nPeople Take Pictures of Each Other\n\nBerkeley Mews\n\nTill Death Us Do Part\n\nVictoria\n\nSome Mother's Son\n\nBrainwashed\n\nAustralia (Edit)\n\nShangri-La\n\nToday I hope you'll indulge me in a bit of a diversion to talk a bit about the director of The Long Distance Piano Player, Philip Saville* (1927-2016) as co incidentally I've just finished his posthumously published autobiography, They Shoot Directors, Don't They? - a hugely entertaining and very recommended read, although despite it's title referring to the same 1935 book that inspired TLDPP (as mentioned by @All Down The Line above), the Ray Davies play doesn't merit one word within: however what does come across greatly is that despite not being a household name what a storied scene hopping Zelig of the 60s era he was, being among many other things the director of the lost early 1963 BBC Play Madhouse On Castle Street, now considered of huge historical import for it's incongruous appearance by a pre-fame Bob Dylan, as well as the man behind the only production of Hamlet ever to be filmed on location at Kronburg Castle (and starring Christopher Plummer and Michael Caine), not to mention (something he goes on at great length about, and I guess why not) dating Diana Rigg for 7 years at the time when she was close to being the ideal woman of collective Western male desires! Later in the 80s he would hit further artistic and popular highs with the esteemed Tv series Boys From The Blackstuff, and The Lives And Loves Of A She-Devil , as well as the 1987 Mandela biopic with Danny Glover. Despite directing several feature films he always seemed to have a preference for TV work, which is why he was still happy to do Play For Todays for the BBC in the early 70s when he'd already graduated to making Oedipus Rex with Orson Welles a few years before.\n\nSo again this guy is a fairly heavy talent for Ray to get involved with here, even if ultimately their collab didn't merit any ink in his memoirs. A shame cos even though it's a minor work in his ouvre, it'd have be interesting to read about how working with Ray compared with his experience with Dylan 8 years earlier, being the man who directed both of them in their first dramatic roles.\n\n*I spelled his name slightly wrong in my initial post, apologies!\n\nI take it you didn't read this due solely to his link to Ray?"
