        "text": "Gregory Peck is Arch Deans, a small-time outlaw who has robbed a bank with two partners and made off with $420, killing a man in the process.\n\nJack Warden is Sheriff Henry Gifford, determined to bring in Deans and his partners, partly because they killed a man over just $420.\n\nIn a small southwest town, Gifford manages to kill one of the outlaws and captures a second, a half-breed named Billy Two Hats (Dezi Arnaz Jr.).\n\nBut Deans makes a clean getaway with the money, and Gifford figures that will be the last he sees of him. After all, he reasons, no one’s going to come back for a half-breed.\n\nNo one, perhaps, except Deans, who values his friendship with the young boy. He rescues him from Gifford’s grip and the two start a desperate trek toward the border.\n\nThe journey is made more desperate because an old-timer with a Buffalo gun has managed to kill one of their horses. And in the fall from that horse, Deans has broken his leg.\n\nThen there’s the small band of aging Apache warriors who haven’t been sapped of all their fight.\n\nReview:\n\nWell-done little film — certainly different enough to be effective — if you can get past Peck with a thick Irish accent.\n\nDavid Huddleston plays the old-timer who lends the sheriff a hand, and comes to realize he doesn’t value friendship nearly as much as Deans.\n\nSian Barbara Allen is a mail-order bride, stuck on a lonely ranch far from her home, who sees a chance for a fresh start in Billy, not knowing of his outlaw past.\n\nThis marked one of just a handful of appearances for Dezi Arnaz Jr. — son of Dezi Arnaz and Lucille Ball — in a feature film. It was his only Western.\n\nBut he turns in a solid performance as a young man who knows the drawback of the color of his skin and values the relationship he has with Deans.\n\nThe story behind the film’s title, shared by Billy with Esther, is pretty clever too.\n\nDirected by:\n\nTed Kotcheff\n\nCast:\n\nGregory Peck … Arch Deans\n\nDezi Arnaz Jr. … Billy Two Hats\n\nJack Warden … Sheriff Henry Gifford\n\nDavid Huddleston … Copeland\n\nSian Barbara Allen … Esther Spencer\n\nJohn Pearce … Spencer\n\nDawn Little Sky … Copeland’s squaw\n\nW. Vincent St. Cyr … Indian leader\n\nHenry Medicine Hat … Indian\n\nZev Berlinsky … Indian\n\nAntony Scott … Indian\n\nVic Armstrong … Henry Sweets Bradley\n\nRuntime: 99 min.\n\nMemorable lines:\n\nSheriff Henry Gifford to Billy: “I don’t like no kind of law breaker, breed. But the kind I hate worst are the cheap ones. Cheaper than you and your friends, they just don’t come.”\n\nArch Deans: “Ah, never look back, Billy, when you’re leaving somewhere you don’t want to see again. Remember what happened to Lot’s wife.”\n\nSpencer, explaining why he hit his wife: “Once she gets excited, she can’t hardly speak. So I give her a whack. Shakes her brain box up a bit.”\n\nSpencer of his wife: “Damn woman. Enough to give a man a sore head just listenin’ to her.”\n\nSpencer, pinned under a wagon with Arch by Apaches: “How many do you think there are?”\n\nArch: “Four, I think.:\n\nSpencer: “How do you know there are four?”\n\nArch, wryly: “I counted their feet and divided by two.”"
