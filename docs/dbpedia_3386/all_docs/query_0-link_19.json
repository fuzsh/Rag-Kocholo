        "text": "This season of films, by a neglected figure who worked with Hollywood’s greatest directors and became one of Scotland’s most important transnational authors, has been specifically devised to restore Sharp’s work to the prominence it deserves. Featuring films directed by legendary auteurs such as Peter Fonda, Robert Aldrich and Arthur Penn, and including actors such as Burt Lancaster, Melanie Griffith, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Warren, Verna Bloom and James Woods, it illustrates the astonishing career of a self-taught, working-class man who made it all the way to the top just because he believed in himself.\n\nThe season is curated by Dave Manderson, whose book ‘The Anti-hero’s Journey: the Work and Life of Alan Sharp’ (Peter Lang publishers) is published this year. A post-screening discussion will follow the 35mm screening of Night Moves on Thursday, 28 September. The season is the first time any of Sharp’s American films have been seen on the big screen in Glasgow in almost fifty years."
