He is an award-winning teacher and script consultant, author of The Screenwriter’s Bible, and friendly host of keepwriting.com.\n\nMARCH 2024\n\nOPPENHEIMER\n\nQUESTION\n\nRead the script Oppenheimer and explain to us what Christopher Nolan was trying to do with his first-person action descriptions.\n\nANSWER\n\nThe script is a shooting script written by the director for the director. He is also an established force in the industry. For all those reasons, Nolan doesn’t have to please anyone or abide by any spec formatting guidelines.\n\nBy “first person,” I assume you refer to the many uses of WE as in WE SEE, WE HEAR, WE FOLLOW, WE STAY. Let’s tackle that in the next section.\n\n“WE”\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow does the industry feel about the use of WE in scripts? I love Eric Roth scripts.\n\nANSWER\n\nMany have no problem at all. And even in a spec script, there are times when it may be the best way to express an action. I suggest you use it sparingly if you use it all; I don’t think anyone will complain. However, keep the following in mind as you make your writing decision.\n\nWE is first person. Scripts are written in third person. In addition, Eric Roth scripts are shooting scripts. It’s hard to get your hands on a spec script. Finally, the use of WE is usually a camera direction, which is something we generally like to avoid. Even so, it may work when there is an overriding dramatic reason for it. There’s no rule against it, but be wise and judicious in its use.\n\nDID INDY JONES MIS-DIAL?\n\nQUESTION\n\nI didn’t like the ending of the recent Indiana Jones movie? What are your thoughts?\n\nANSWER\n\nI’m sure you’ve read that The Dial of Destiny flopped or at least did not perform up to expectations. There are a variety of reasons for that, most of which are out of the writer’s hands. Let’s look at just one reason that is in the writer’s hands and derive a useful lesson doing our A-B-C’s. (Warning: spoiler alert.)\n\nA. This is the fifth movie in the esteemed franchise. What is one reason most people wanted to view this film? To see Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) do Indy things (like race a horse through a parade) and save the day at the end.\n\nB. What is a key character and story maxim for the final (third) act of any movie? The central character (protagonist) should be the most active character in the final act with rare exception.\n\nC. Who is the most active character in the final act of The Dial of Destiny? Helena, Indy’s goddaughter. She’s a wonderful character, but I’m betting most fans would prefer to see Indy chase down that plane and jump onto the landing gear. Helena takes over the movie at the end to the point that she punches out Indy’s lights and brings him home. It’s a nice twist, but perhaps not as fulfilling as seeing Indiana Jones save the day just one last time.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nFEBRUARY 2024\n\nOVERLAPPING THE ACTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nI’m writing an action sequence – cops come in the front while a fight takes place inside. Do I tell the reader that the “action overlaps”?\n\nANSWER\n\nNo. Just write the action as it happens. If one action takes place at the same time as another action, then use “SAME” in your second scene heading. Note the example above in the previous section and the example below.\n\nEXT. BAR – NIGHT\n\nThe cops barge through the front door.\n\nINT. BAR – SAME\n\nJim throws a chair over Chuck’s head.\n\nFREEZING THE ACTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am uncertain of how to use the FREEZE FRAME in my script. Is the following correct:\n\nTobias punches Roman, who falls to the floor. He grabs Roman’s scarf.\n\nFREEZE FRAME:\n\nTobias wraps it around Roman’s neck.\n\nTOBIAS (V.O.)\n\nStop. Let’s go back to how this\n\nall began.\n\nANSWER\n\nYou have the right idea, but you cannot describe action after you freeze the action. Describe the action you want to freeze on, and then freeze it. In addition, omit the colon after the words “FREEZE FRAME.” For example:\n\nHe grabs Roman’s scarf and wraps it around his neck.\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\nThen go ahead with your voiced-over speech and keep writing.\n\nJANUARY 2024\n\nHOW LONG IS TOO LONG?\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow long should a [spec] screenplay be?\n\nANSWER\n\nAbout 100-110 pages, but certainly not more than 120 pages. Ideally, a comedy will come in at about 100 pages and a drama or action story at 105-110. The minimum is 90.\n\nYou may wonder why the 120-page limit when you've seen produced screenplays that are much longer than that. In virtually every case, those long screenplays were both shooting scripts and were developed within the system; they were not spec screenplays.\n\nThe central theme that runs through this issue's column is to make your spec screenplay an \"easy but fascinating read.\"\n\nFIRST PERSON/THIRD PERSON\n\nQUESTION\n\nIn the screenplay I am working on, I have a sequence where the camera is the character's eye. During this sequence, the story is told in first person. I would be interesting in knowing how to insert this sequence into a screenplay written in third person without [using] technical intrusions.\n\nANSWER\n\nWhen you say the \"story is told in first person,\" I assume you mean that the character (whose eye is the camera) talks to or describes what he/she is sees. Thus, that character's viewpoint dominates in that scene. However, the narrative description would still be written in third person. Narrative description is always written in third person, present tense language. (First person would involve the use of the pronouns \"I\" or \"me.\" Second person would use \"you.\" And third person would use \"he,\" \"she,\" \"they,\" and so on.) The fact that the eye is the camera changes nothing in terms of how you write description and dialogue.\n\nThat leaves the issue of communicating to the reader that the \"camera is the character's eye.\" I assume that you mean that the camera takes the point-of-view of the character--what he/she sees, we see. You are right to want to write this without the camera directions, if possible. In cases like this, we are all tempted to write something like the following:\n\nPOV JANE -- A man walks towards her.\n\nIf your character (let’s call him Zep) speaks while we see the flashback, then use the voice over (V.O.) extension.\n\nYou can (and should) write the same thing without the camera direction, as follows:\n\nJane sees a man walking towards her.\n\nS-S-STUTTERING AND D-D-DIALECTING\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am writing a screenplay where the main character stutters almost all the time. How should I indicate that in the dialogue? I find it annoying to indicate it in parenthesis before every line of dialogue, so I came up with something like the following:\n\nZEP (V.O.)\n\nW-what? I-I d-don't understand.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\nANSWER\n\nJust show a flavor of stuttering; that is, occasional stuttering to remind us that this character stutters. Don't overdo it or, as you rightly said, the reader will be annoyed. Also, when you first introduce the character, indicate that he/she stutters. The same holds true for accents and dialects--just give us a flavor. Don't adjust the spelling of every word to show precisely how each and every word would be pronounced in a certain dialect or with a certain accent. It will be too difficult to read. .\n\nIn THE KING’S SPEECH, the following paragraph appears in narrative description:\n\n(For ease of reading, Bertie’s stammer will not be indicated from this point in the script.)\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nDECEMBER 2023\n\nINTERCUTTING THE ACTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nIn my screenplay I have two scenes that take place at the same time but at different locations, and I switch back and forth between settings. Should I just keep switching back and forth between the locations, or should I type the following:\n\nINTERCUT BETWEEN FOOTBALL FIELD AND HOSPITAL ROOM\n\nANSWER\n\nThe INTERCUT is usually used for phone conversations. You can use the INTERCUT for action, but only if you’re sure the reader will not get confused as to where a specific action is taking place. The following is correct format:\n\nINTERCUT – FOOTBALL FIELD/HOSPITAL ROOM\n\nThe players huddle on the field.\n\nSurgeons huddle around the operating table.\n\nIf you want to intercut between quick shots, consider using the MONTAGE instead. That way, you can easily highlight the locations:\n\nMONTAGE – FOOTBALL GAME/SURGERY\n\n-- FOOTBALL FIELD – The players huddle on the field.\n\n-- HOSPITAL ROOM – Surgeons huddle around the operating table.\n\nIf you wish, you can use scene headings in that MONTAGE:\n\nMONTAGE – FOOTBALL GAME/SURGERY\n\n-- INT. FOOTBALL FIELD – The players huddle on the field.\n\n-- INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – Surgeons huddle around the operating table.\n\nIf neither the MONTAGE nor the INTERCUT seem appropriate, just cross-cut between scene headings:\n\nEXT. FOOTBALL FIELD – DAY\n\nThe players huddle on the field.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM – SAME\n\nSurgeons huddle around the operating table.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nNOVEMBER 2023\n\nTWO KINDS OF FLASHBACKS\n\nQUESTION\n\nAre there any special format rules for writing a flashback?\n\nANSWER\n\nSince the FLASHBACK is often abused by beginning writers, make sure that your use of it pays off dramatically.\n\nIn terms of formatting, there are numerous correct methods. The overriding principle is to be clear. I will highlight the two main methods, one for flashbacks of one scene, and the second for flashbacks of more than one scene.\n\nMethod 1\n\nIn the example below designed for flashbacks of just one scene, we label the flashback like we would a montage, with the concept of the flashback in the flashback scene heading.\n\nFLASHBACK – TRAIN ACCIDENT\n\nBarry sees the train speeding toward him and leaps from the tracks, but his foot catches on a rail tie.\n\nBACK TO PRESENT DAY\n\nThus, the scene begins in the hospital (INT. HOSPITAL ROOM – DAY) and then a character at the hospital recalled the past, giving rise to the FLASHBACK, and then we returned to that character at the hospital room (BACK TO THE HOSPITAL ROOM).\n\nMethod 2\n\nGiven the same situation as above, let’s assume that the flashback is more than one scene. Although there are many correct ways to handle this situation, the following is what I suggest:\n\nBEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE\n\nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS – NIGHT\n\nBarry sees the train speeding toward him.\n\nINT. LOCOMOTIVE\n\nThe engineer sees Barry and pulls the brakes.\n\nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS\n\nBarry leaps from the tracks, but his foot catches on a rail tie.\n\nEND FLASHBACK SEQUENCE\n\nINT. HOSPITAL – CONTINUOUS\n\nAnd then keep writing!\n\nOCTOBER 2023\n\nWHAT’S YOUR POV?\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have in mind a scene whereby what is envisioned by the reader (and viewed by the cinema audience) would be Black & White video feed (live or recorded) from a covert security camera.\n\nFor example:\n\nINT. BASEMENT – NIGHT\n\nBlack and white POV of the secret agent dialing the safe's combination\n\nI had previously read that for a spec script, \"POV\" could be considered a camera direction and, therefore, should not be used. Suggestions on a way to write the above?\n\nANSWER\n\nSometimes a POV can be used, but usually you can avoid it. For example, rather than:\n\nJOHN’S POV – The monster licks his chops.\n\nYou can write:\n\nJohn sees the monster lick his chops.\n\nThat has to be a POV shot, and it’s a bit more readable. In the original Raiders of the Lost Arc script, the writer uses the following device:\n\nWhat Indy sees: A snake crawls towards him.\n\nThat’s a POV shot. In addition, keep in mind that CAPS are a little hard on the eyes of readers that read tons of scripts. However, if you use POV once or twice in your screenplay, no one is going to scream or slit their wrists. Relax.\n\nConcerning your specific example, it seems to me that it could be handled as a separate scene.\n\nINT. FBI OFFICE - DAY\n\nJohn plays the video.\n\nON THE MONITOR – BLACK & WHITE\n\nIn a basement, the secret agent dials the safe’s combination.\n\nBACK TO FBI OFFICE\n\nIf you want that to be a live video stream, you could write, “John watches the live video stream.” Here’s another method for handling this.\n\nINT. FBI OFFICE - DAY\n\nJohn plays the video.\n\nINT. BASEMENT – NIGHT – BLACK & WHITE\n\nThe secret agent dials the safe’s combination.\n\nThen keyboard in another master scene heading and keep writing!\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023\n\nQUICK FLASHES—SITUATION #1\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do you handle a series of quick flashbacks?\n\nANSWER\n\nUse the same format that you would use for MONTAGE. Here’s an example:\n\nQUICK FLASHES – DUKE’S BASEBALL MEMORIES\n\n-- Duke slides home safe. Jubilant teammates scramble to congratulate him.\n\n-- Duke, playing shortstop, snags a hot grounder, and tosses the man out at first.\n\n-- Duke swings at a fast ball and watches it sail over the left-field fence.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nIf you have just one quick flashback, use the following format:\n\nQUICK FLASHBACK\n\nDuke strikes out.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nQUICK FLASHES—SITUATION #2\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have a series of quick flashbacks at the end of a script that reference a character’s memories of three different people. Do I create three flashback headings, one for each flashback?\n\nANSWER\n\nYou could, but I recommend you use my answer to Situation #1 above as your guide and create a MONTAGE of QUICK FLASHES.\n\nAnother option is to create an EPILOGUE at the very end of the script; for example\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n-- Image of first Joe pranking someone.\n\nALBERT (V.O.)\n\nJoe was always a jokester.\n\nAnd so on for the other two characters.\n\nGood luck and keep writing.\n\nAUGUST 2023\n\nINSIDE OR OUTSIDE—SITUATION #1\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have a question about the INT. [Interior] and EXT. [Exterior] in a car scene. Which should I use if there’s action in the car interior, but we also need to know what’s happening outside the car.\n\nANSWER\n\nThere’s a half dozen ways to handle this depending on your dramatic purpose for the scene. I’ll illustrate just two approaches.\n\nOne method is to establish the exterior location and action first, and then cut to the car. For example:\n\nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD – DAY\n\nCows line the road wearing menacing expressions.\n\nINT. CAR\n\nJoe cautiously rolls up his window.\n\nThat was inspired by a comic from Gary Larson’s The Far Side. :)\n\nAnother method is to simply use Exterior and Interior together as follows:\n\nEXT./INT. CAR – DAY\n\nThat informs the reader that the camera can be anywhere the director wants it—inside or outside the car.\n\nINSIDE OR OUTSIDE—SITUATION #2\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do you write out scenes that take place in three different locations? I have three characters, two of which are at outside locations and one is in his bedroom talking on the phone. Do I write down INT. and EXT. every time I go to another location?\n\nANSWER\n\nIf these three locations are in three separate places—for example, Jim’s bathroom, a public park, and a city street—then you will need a new master scene heading (including the INT. or EXT.) each time you go to a new location.\n\nHowever, if these three locations are all part of a master (primary) location, you could establish a master scene heading and follow it with secondary headings. Assuming the master location is Jim’s house, we can first establish that master location and then cut to secondary locations that are part of the master location, as follows:\n\nEXT./INT. JIM’S HOUSE – NIGHT\n\nON THE BACK PATIO\n\nSelma jimmies open the patio door.\n\nIN THE BACKYARD\n\nLonnie opens a back window and nods to Selma.\n\nIN JIM’S BEDROOM\n\nJim talks on the phone.\n\nIf you use the above method, make sure you don’t lose the reader. In other words, the reader should always know if he/she is outside or inside.\n\nWhether you are inside or outside, keep writing!\n\nJULY 2023\n\nCOOL CAT DIALOGUE\n\nQUESTION\n\nI was curious as to how you could specify in a script that animals can talk to each other but humans generally do not understand; for example, in a movie like Garfield where the cat talks but humans don’t hear him talking.\n\nANSWER\n\nThe example below “speaks” for itself:\n\nGarfield speaks, but the humans can’t hear him.\n\nGARFIELD\n\nHumans are dumb.\n\nOnce you establish that humans can’t hear animals, you don’t have to continually repeat it throughout your script, but you may wish to casually remind us once or twice more.\n\nPOLITICALLY CORRECT NARRATIVE\n\nQUESTION\n\nI’m stumped about an issue in my screenplay which deals with racial discrimination in Harlem during the 1930s and 1940s. What is the correct way to address folks now called African-Americans if the story took place before that term was used? Obviously, the term used in my source material is Negro, but modern usage dictates either Black or African-American. I want to be true to the spirit of the times, but I also don’t want to use terminology that is offensive. How would you handle that in a screenplay?\n\nANSWER\n\nUse modern terms in your narrative description (action) and period terms in your dialogue.\n\nCHARACTERS WITH AN ALIAS\n\nQUESTION\n\nIn my script, my heroine travels under an alias. In prior drafts, I used the following: JANE CAMERON/VALENTINA DE MARIA. This is a bit clumsy, so I am considering a note; for example:\n\nNOTE: From this point forward, JANE CAMERON will use the name VALENTINA DE MARIA.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe note is a possible solution, but it still might be easy for a reader to get confused. I suggest that you use JANE as her name in the character cue (character name in the dialogue block), and then when she is impersonating, write JANE AS VALENTINA or JANE/VALENTINA. And then keep writing!\n\nJune 2023\n\nLOST IN TRANSLATION\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhile dealing with one-on-one translations in a scene (in my case, the protagonist asks another character to translate what he says to another character in Chinese), should I write duplicate dialogue for the translator, like this:\n\nCHUCK\n\nHey, brother...\n\nSIU-MING\n\n(in Chinese)\n\nHey brother....\n\nANSWER\n\nThe above seems redundant. In addition, if you use that method, an entire conversation can take up a lot of space. Try the following strategy.\n\nCHUCK\n\nHey, brother...\n\nSiu-Ming translates into Chinese.\n\nLet’s turn this around and assume someone (Ja-kee Chan) is speaking to Chuck and Sui-Ling is translating.\n\nJa-kee Chan speaks to Chuck in Chinese. Sui-Ling translates.\n\nSUI-LING\n\nHe say, Hey brother.\n\nHANDLING COOKIE REQUESTS\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have a question about the following example:\n\nBob takes a cookie and eats it. Junior opens his mouth and points -- ME TOO.\n\nIn the above, I’m trying to highlight and clarify the action of him pointing. Does it work?\n\nANSWER\n\nYou can probably get away with that, but it may not read clearly to some readers. In addition, you would not place “Me too” in all-CAPS. Perhaps the following represents a cleaner approach:\n\nBob takes a cookie and eats it. Junior points to his open mouth.\n\nHere’s another possibility:\n\nBob takes a cookie and eats it. Junior tugs at Bob’s shirt and mouths “Me, too?”\n\nThis goes back to the old rule for description, \"Describe what we see.\" Good luck and keep writing!\n\nMay 2023\n\nFLUFFY SPEAKS AT LAST\n\nQUESTION\n\nMy story features an adult male who takes Angel, a six-year-old girl, to Fun Park. At the park, she holds up a stuffed animal and changes her voice to speak for the stuffed animal. How do I differentiate between the two voices?\n\nANSWER\n\nWhen Angel is speaking as herself, put the name ANGEL in the character cue, and when she speaks as the stuffed animal (which we will call Fluffy), put ANGEL AS FLUFFY in the character cue. Let’s assume in the following example that the adult male is Angel’s dad and that Angel plays a little joke on him.\n\nANGEL\n\nI wanna go home.\n\nShe looks at Fluffy and changes her voice.\n\nANGEL AS FLUFFY\n\nMe, too.\n\nDAD\n\nAre you talking to me?\n\nANGEL\n\n(to fluffy)\n\nWho’s that?\n\nANGEL AS FLUFFY\n\nI dunno, but we shouldn’t talk to\n\nstrangers.\n\nELLIPSICAL ALLUSION\n\nQUESTION\n\nDo you space before an ellipsis and also after an ellipsis, or is there no spacing before and after?\n\nANSWER\n\nDo not space before an ellipsis but do space after. This “rule” of a space after the ellipsis only applies to screenwriting. (In other forms of writing, there is not a space before or after the ellipsis.)\n\nSince we are on the subject, an ellipsis is usually used in dialogue to show continuity, a pause, or a character trailing off, as Marlene does in the example below\n\n. MARLENE\n\nI’m not sure... well, I think\n\nknow... what you mean. You\n\nthink I’m a....\n\nAn introspective expression comes over Marlene’s face.\n\nA dash is normally used to show interruption. Good luck and keep writing!\n\nApril 2023\n\nTRACKING BOB\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat do you do when you have a character walking from one area to the next, say a kitchen into a hallway? Is the following format correct?\n\nINT. HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. Vicki continues to drink. Bob rushes to answer the phone.\n\nINT. KITCHEN/HALLWAY - TRACKING\n\nBob pounces on the phone.\n\nANSWER\n\nWhen you present two locations in one scene heading, list the larger (or master) location first (which you do) and separate them with a dash (which you don’t). Also, omit the camera direction (TRACKING). There are several ways you can handle this. I’ll present just three.\n\nMethod #1:\n\nINT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. Vicki continues to drink, but Bob rushes into the\n\nHALLWAY\n\nand pounces on the phone.\n\nMethod #2:\n\nINT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. Vicki continues to drink. Bob darts away from her.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nBob races in and pounces on the phone.\n\nMethod #3:\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. Vicki continues to drink. Bob darts away from her.\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\nBob races in and pounces on the phone.\n\nNormally, you would write CONTINOUS after HALLWAY, but we don’t need to because it’s already obvious that the scene follows the previous scene CONTINOUSLY.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nMarch 2023\n\nTHE CAT'S PAJAMAS\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhen an animal utters its natural sounds, how do I indicate English subtitles? My specific example is for a cat that is meowing to a person, with the English translation appearing as subtitles.\n\nMy best guess would be something like the following where TABBY is a cat and BOB is a person.\n\nBOB\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nTabby MEOWS adamantly.\n\nSUBTITLE reads:\n\n\"Where are my pajamas?\"\n\nEND OF SUBTITLES\n\nANSWER\n\nYou could do that, but I suggest you handle it like a foreign language:\n\nBOB\n\n(meows; subtitled)\n\nWhere are my pajamas?\n\nIf Tabby talks throughout the screenplay, then the constant addition of the parenthetical can be laborious. In such a case, I suggest a clarifying note when Tabby is first introduced. It could look something like this:\n\nNOTE: When Tabby meows, subtitles will appear with the meaning of her words in English.\n\nPerhaps a better option is to use a special extension for just this situation. In either case, the extension would look something like this:\n\nTABBY (SUBTITLED)\n\nWhere are my pajamas?\n\nLet's pose another question that does not involve subtitles. What if a cat meows or a dog barks? These are sounds and should be written as narrative description and not as dialogue.\n\nHow about human screams? For example, I often see something like this:\n\nBART\n\nArhhfffff!\n\nSince that is a sound and not a word, it should be written as narrative description. For example:\n\nBART SCREAMS.\n\nHowever, if you want to write out the scream for some comedic or dramatic reason, then please do so. No reader will scream.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMY FAVORITE FORMATTING FLUB\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat is the most common formatting error that you see?\n\nANSWER\n\nOh, that's easy—scene headings, sometimes called slug lines. As a script consultant, I often find myself saying while reading a script, \"Where am I?\" For example:\n\nINT. CHRISTMAS DAY – DAY\n\n\"Christmas Day\" is not a location. Where am I? Here's another goof.\n\nEXT. SWAMP – DAY\n\nLarry trudges out of the swamp.\n\nBATHROOM\n\nLarry washes his face at the sink.\n\nHow can a bathroom be part of a swamp, and how did we get from an exterior camera placement to an interior camera placement?\n\nBegin a scene with a master scene heading, which names the master (or primary) location; for example, EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY. Other locations (such as BEDROOM or HALLWAY) that are part of the master location are called secondary locations; the resulting heading is called a secondary heading. In addition, it's okay to add a secondary location to a master (primary) location in a master scene heading. I'll illustrate all of these points below.\n\nFirst, we'll begin with the master scene heading that includes a secondary location and then move to other secondary locations.\n\nINT. SMITH HOUSE – LIVING ROOM – DAY\n\nJohn slams the front door and races down the\n\nHALLWAY\n\nand into his\n\nBEDROOM\n\nwhere he dives on top of his bed and sobs.\n\nThe above is correct, but it could have just as easily been written like this, which is also correct:\n\nEXT. SMITH HOUSE – DAY\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nJohn slams the front door and races out.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nHe runs past pictures of his family.\n\nBEDROOM\n\nHe stumbles in and falls on his bed sobbing.\n\nAs you can see, any number of secondary headings can follow as long as the locations are part of the master (primary) location. Once we change the camera placement to an exterior location or to a location that is not part of the master location, we must create a new master scene heading.\n\nThe above could also have been written as one master scene heading and a paragraph.\n\nIf I may, I'll mention one other common formatting fumble—including description in the scene heading. To wit:\n\nEXT. A WINDY NIGHT WITH A PALE MOON SHINING THROUGH TREES IN THE WOODS\n\nThat should actually be written as follows:\n\nEXT. WOODS – NIGHT\n\nA pale moon shines through trees buffeted by a stiff wind.\n\nSave the description for the description (action) sections of your script.\n\nNIGHT AND DAY\n\nQUESTION\n\nI heard at a seminar that you no longer have to include DAY or NIGHT at the end of a scene heading. Is that so?\n\nANSWER\n\nNo. The reader really needs to know if it's night or day. I suspect that the seminar leader was referring to instances where the time is already clearly understood. For example, the following would be perfectly okay:\n\nEXT. HOTEL – DAY\n\nLilith slithers into the hotel.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY\n\nShe glides up to the elevator.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nARTISTIC DIFFERENCES\n\nQUESTION\n\nIn the past, you have cautioned against defining certain particulars—a specific song, for instance—as they are areas that a director or producer might want control over, which is understandable. But are you saying that a good script could potentially be tossed over a minor artistic difference?\n\nMy real question is: wouldn't a potential producer at least attempt to talk to the screenwriter to see if he's amenable to changes in the script?\n\nANSWER\n\nIf it's a minor artistic difference, why include it? Why take a chance of giving a negative impression? If you don't control the rights to the piece of music, then you are asking the producer to not only buy the script but to buy the music rights as well. So, if you want a specific piece of music, make sure it's going to pay off dramatically.\n\nCertainly, a script will not be tossed simply because of a couple of formatting errors or the inclusion of a musical reference. However, if enough little things add up to become distractions, then your script may not get the reading attention it deserves. Since there are so many scripts vying for attention, it pays to give yours a fighting chance.\n\nOnce your script is sold, feel free to discuss with the producer more of your vision for the eventual movie.\n\nTHE INDUSTRY STANDARD\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhy is there so much confusion around the \"industry standard\" for formatting? And what is the \"industry standard\"? How important is it to adhere to it?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe industry standard consists of generally accepted formatting conventions for spec screenplays. It differs from the standard for shooting scripts. The difficulty lies in the fact that virtually every script available to read is a shooting script. It's hard to get your hands on a spec, which is why I included two successful spec scripts in my book Two Screenplays (https://keepwriting.com/tsc/2screenplays.htm).\n\nWhen you finish that wonderful script and send it to the agent or producer who requests it, what does that agent or producer do? He or she does not read it, but instead hands it off to reader to write coverage. In that coverage, if the reader passes on your script, the producer or agent is very unlikely to read it. The reader is the gatekeeper, so what does he or she want as tribute?\n\nA spec that is readable and entertaining without technical intrusions like camera directions, props in all-CAPS, and so on. That's why a spec is different. Good luck with yours and keep writing!\n\nDecember 2022\n\nFISHING FOR A LOCATION\n\nQUESTION\n\nIf a scene takes place on the deck of a small fishing boat, is the heading INT. or EXT. What if the scene is in the galley or down below?\n\nANSWER\n\nIf the camera is outside the boat, then use EXT for exterior. If the camera is inside the boat—in the galley, for example—then use INT for interior.\n\nWHAT ABOUT OUTER SPACE?\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat should a writer indicate for the time of day in the slug line [scene heading] when the time of day is not relevant? For example, if a scene takes place in space, such as on a spaceship, then the normal concepts of night and day do not apply. Similarly, a scene might take place in a subterranean cavern so deep that the time of day isn't relevant since no sunlight can reach it.\n\nANSWER\n\nThere are two schools of thought on this. One is that the time of day is, as you say, irrelevant. Thus, a scene heading might be written as follows:\n\nEXT. OUTER SPACE\n\nAnd certainly, that is all you need for that scene heading. Another school of thought holds that since people behave as if it is night or day (sleeping or working, for example), those terms should be used in INTERIOR scenes, such as inside the spaceship or cave. Usually, that \"assumed\" time of day would already be obvious to the reader, so I lean towards the first school of thought—they usually aren't needed. However, I don't see a problem writing DAY or NIGHT, where doing so would clarify the situation.\n\nFAST AND SLOW MOTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am writing a comedy script and there is an action sequence which is about a page that I would like to be done in FAST MOTION. There are a few bits of dialogue in the mix of it, but I'm not sure how to go about formatting it.\n\nANSWER\n\nHandle FAST MOTION exactly the way you do SLOW MOTION. If the speeded-up action takes place within a scene, then use the following special heading:\n\nIN FAST MOTION\n\nHOSPITAL ROOM\n\nMary chases John across the yard like a dog chases a squirrel. John scampers up a tree for safety.\n\nBACK TO NORMAL TIME\n\nMARY\n\nSo that's where you've been\n\nhiding.\n\nIf the speeded-up action is a sequence containing several scenes, then handle it as follows:\n\nBEGIN FAST MOTION SEQUENCE\n\nEXT. BACK YARD - DAY\n\nWrite out the scene and the other scenes in the sequence, just as you would if they weren't written in fast motion. You can include dialogue just as you would for any scene; however, the reader will assume that the dialogue is also speeded-up, making the characters sound something like Alvin's Chipmunks. You can see how I avoided that in my example above; in that example, Mary says her line in \"normal time.\"\n\nAfter the last scene that is in FAST MOTION ends, write:\n\nEND FAST MOTION SEQUENCE\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nNovember 2022\n\nSPLITTING THE SCREEN\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow does one write a split screen in a spec?\n\nANSWER\n\nBecause the split screen device is a special heading (like the MONTAGE, FLASHBACK, or INTERCUT), there is more than one way to format it, and each way is simple and makes sense. I’ll use the beginning of the Kill Bill split screen scene and present four methods.\n\nMethod #1\n\nDo you recall how to write an INTERCUT, which is another special heading? Here’s an example:\n\nINTERCUT – HOSPITAL ROOM/HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nIn the hospital room, the bride likes in unblinking comatose sleep.\n\nElle, in a nurse’s uniform, strides down the hospital corridor carrying a syringe on a tray.\n\nNow, what if you want the INTERCUT to be a SPLIT SCREEN so that we see both things happening at the same time? Simply replace the word INTERCUT with SPLIT SCREEN:\n\nSPLIT SCREEN – HOSPITAL ROOM/HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nMethod #2\n\nWhat if you want to be clearer about location to enhance the read? In that case, use secondary scene headings. By using secondary scene headings, you probably can use SPLIT SCREEN as the sole item in the scene heading, since it is also a technical direction. Thus, we have the following:\n\nSPLIT SCREEN\n\nHOSPITAL ROOM\n\nThe bride likes in unblinking comatose sleep.\n\nHOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nElle, in a nurse’s uniform, strides down carrying a syringe on a tray.\n\nMethod #3\n\nWhat if you want to be clearer about what’s on the left and what’s on the right? Do this:\n\nSPLIT SCREEN\n\nHOSPITAL ROOM (ON LEFT)\n\nThe bride likes in unblinking comatose sleep.\n\nHOSPITAL CORRIDOR (ON RIGHT)\n\nElle, in a nurse’s uniform, strides down carrying a syringe on a tray.\n\nMethod #4\n\nWhat if you are writing a shooting script, or simply do not want to use secondary scene headings? Then the following is one way to go:\n\nSPLIT SCREEN\n\nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM\n\nThe bride likes in unblinking comatose sleep.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nElle, in a nurse’s uniform, strides down carrying a syringe on a tray.\n\nIn the actual shooting script, Tarantino created two columns for the split screen, left and right.\n\nWhich method should you use? Use the method that is most consistent with what you want the split screen scene to accomplish. And keep writing!\n\nOctober 2022\n\nBOLD AND ITALICS\n\nQUESTION\n\nIs it okay to use bold and italics when writing screenplays, or should everything be written normally without any emphasis?\n\nANSWER\n\nFirst, I should mention that my response is for spec screenplays.\n\nLet’s start with italics.\n\nUse italics for words of dialogue that are not spoken. For example, when someone sings a song, the lyrics should be written in italics because they are not spoken words (the lyrics are sung rather than spoken).\n\nLikewise, if you have a text conversation written in dialogue blocks, handle it like this:\n\nJULIE (TEXT)\n\nI luv U.\n\nYou can even include the emojis.\n\nIt’s acceptable, but not necessary to write foreign words in italics.\n\nThere is no reason to use bold, although there is an acceptable fad of writing scene headings (slug lines) and special headings in bold and underscored.\n\nLETTERS AND VOICE-OVERS\n\nQUESTION\n\nIf a character writes something on a piece of paper, and the audience can hear the character’s voice saying the same words he is writing, how do I format that?\n\nANSWER\n\nJust voice-over the words he is writing.\n\nINT. HOME OFFICE – DAY\n\nBen sits at his desk and starts writing on a piece of paper.\n\nBEN (V.O.)\n\nDear Jerry. Let’s start an ice\n\ncream company with flavors that\n\nhave unusual names.\n\nBen smiles dreamily and licks his lips.\n\nGood luck, have some ice cream, and keep writing!\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nSEQUELS AND SUPERHEROES\n\nQUESTION\n\nIf I wanted to write the sequel to a popular early ‘90s box office feature, how would I go about it? Could I write it and shop it to the original producer to see if there is an interest? Or do I have to obtain legal rights before I even begin writing? Similarly, if I wanted to write the next big Marvel superhero feature, could I write it and then see if I can get a deal?\n\nANSWER\n\nYou can write anything you want. The problems and legal issues enter when you try to sell it. You would only be able to sell your script to the owners of the rights, and you would be in a weak negotiating position. After all, you can only sell it to them.\n\nIn addition, you should know that your completed script would not serve well as a sample of your writing ability because you did not create the characters from scratch.\n\nFor those reasons, it seldom makes sense to write a script that contains material and/or characters that you do not control the rights to. As a general guideline, create your own original characters and write an original screenplay.\n\nTRUE STORIES AND ADAPTATIONS\n\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO THE ABOVE DISCUSSION\n\nWhat about true stories and adaptations?\n\nANSWER\n\nWithout getting into a long legal discussion (which I am not qualified to lead), I'll focus on the marketing issues related to your question.\n\nIf you do not control the rights to the true story or novel, then you are asking the producer to not only buy your script, but to also purchase the necessary rights to the original material. If both the true story and your rendition of it via a screenplay are particularly strong, you may be able to make a deal. After all, there are a few producers in the business of producing true stories, and they are well-equipped to handle the associated legal issues.\n\nHowever, if you have optioned or purchased the rights to someone's true story or novel, then you are in a stronger negotiating position. That's because you have a \"package\"; that is, a script plus the rights to the original material.\n\nKeep in mind that if you decide to take the latter route that you could end up incurring some legal costs and right acquisition costs (even if you only pay for an option to the rights).\n\nIt is nearly impossible to get the rights to national stories; the rights to those are immediately bought by established production companies. Your best bet is a true story that most people are unaware of.\n\nI see this as purely a business decision: do I write an original screenplay without any legal encumbrances, or do I believe enough in the marketability of the novel or true story to go ahead and write the script? And if I believe in the material enough to write the script, do I try to sell the completed script without having acquired any rights, or do I spend the bucks for rights before writing the script in order to put myself in a stronger negotiating position once the script is completed?\n\nANOTHER FOLLOW-UP QUESTION\n\nWhat if the true story is about me?\n\nANSWER\n\nThen you own the rights to your story, although you don't own the rights of other participants. Nevertheless, consider writing the script. It will be therapeutic, plus the writing will likely flush your creative pipes so that you're better able to write other screenplays. You might even be able to sell your completed script without securing any rights, and leave that task to the eventual producer. Keep in mind that in all issues involving possible legal issues, it is usually wise to consult an intellectual property attorney (entertainment lawyer). If you have an agent, your agent will guide you.\n\nMy general advice is to keep writing your original screenplay and avoid legal issues.\n\nNOTE: My books are all discounted right now. See https://www.keepwriting.com/store.htm.\n\nAugust 2022\n\nTEXTING IN THE MOVIES\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do I format a character receiving a text message in my script?\n\nANSWER\n\nThere are several methods depending on your dramatic purpose. I will give examples of the most common.\n\nIn the first example, Sharon texts Cynthia.\n\nINT. SHARON’S ROOM – DAY\n\nSharon posts on her smart phone. The text message reads: “I’m engaged!”\n\nIt’s important to put quotation marks around anything in narrative description that you want the movie-going audience to see and read. If the text message is misspelled, show the misspelling. It’s okay to include an emoji. If you want to emphasize the message so that the reader doesn’t miss it, then you might use the following approach:\n\nON SHARON’S SMART PHONE SCREEN\n\nHer text message reads:\n\n“I’m engaged! ♥”\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nOr:\n\nBACK TO SHARON’S ROOM\n\nAs you can see, I indented the text message just I would dialogue. However, I could have written:\n\nHer text message reads: “I’m engaged! ♥”\n\nHandle email conversations in the same way. Here’s an example.\n\nSharon types an email on her laptop. The message reads: “I’m engaged!”\n\nWhat if you have a long text message conversation? You can write that as dialogue, but italicize the text messages (since they are not the spoken word) and indicate TEXT adjacent to the character name, as follows:\n\nSHARON (TEXT)\n\nI’m engaged!\n\nCYNTHIA (TEXT)\n\nCongratulations!\n\nAs you can see, in formatting, there is often more than one way to present a situation, depending on your purpose and the amount of space you have. Use the method or methods that best suit you...and keep writing!\n\nJuly 2022\n\nMY FORMATTING PET PEEVE\n\nQUESTION\n\nDave, what is your formatting pet peeve?\n\nANSWER\n\nDo not refer to a character as WOMAN on one page and then share her actual name (let's use JANE) a page later (or half-page later, or ten pages later) without a dramatic reason for doing so. The reader may guess that there are actually two different characters, a woman and Jane. Or, the reader may have to stop reading to figure things out or reread the original introduction. Make it easy on your reader and be clear; call your character Jane from the moment she first appears or speaks.\n\nLikewise, if Jane speaks just before we see her, refer to her as JANE (not WOMAN or WOMAN'S VOICE) in the character cue. Here is an example.\n\nTarzan faces a pride of lions looking scared.\n\nJANE (O.S.)\n\nHey, Big Guy.\n\nTarzan turns to see JANE, 25, a beauty wearing a leopard skin. She tosses him the end of a swinging vine and feigns a yawn.\n\nESTABLISHING SHOTS\n\nQUESTION\n\nDo I need to use an ESTABLSHING SHOT to establish a location??\n\nANSWER\n\nYes, if it is important to orient the audience.\n\nHowever, do not use the term ESTABLISHING SHOT or type ESTABLISHING in parentheses after the scene heading. Just write the scene heading followed by some narrative description, as follows:\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING – DAY\n\nAn old three-story brick building.\n\nINT. SARAH'S APARTMENT – SAME\n\nOr, you could replace \"SAME\" with \"CONTINOUS\" or just omit it. The main thing is to be—you guessed it!—clear.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nJune 2022\n\nCLARITY VS. DRAMATIC PAYOFF\n\nQUESTION\n\nIs it okay to withhold information for dramatic purposes, or should you write with absolute clarity? For example, would you refer to a character as SHADOWY FIGURE and then later, at a dramatic moment, reveal that the SHADOWY FIGURE is actually BOB? Or should you call him BOB from the get-go?\n\nANSWER\n\nWhen in doubt, opt for clarity. There are two reasons for this.\n\nYou can't afford to lose or confuse your reader who is not going to read your script carefully. Professional readers face piles of scripts every day and are paid next to nothing, so they tend to read quickly.\n\nProfessional readers will be able to see your dramatic intent, even though you've opted for clarity.\n\nTherefore, your general guideline is to choose clarity and name the character BOB, but there may be exceptions in certain specific circumstances.\n\nOne possible exception might be where the “revelation” that the Shadowy Figure's identity follows immediately after the Shadowy Figure's first appearance. Here's an example:\n\nEXT. ALLEY – NIGHT\n\nSandy hurries past a garbage bin. Suddenly, a SHADOWY FIGURE approaches her from the side.\n\nSHADOWY FIGURE\n\nSandy!\n\nSandy nearly screams until she sees that the Shadowy Figure is actually Bob.\n\nThere's a dramatic payoff in that we initially believe the Shadowy Figure intends harm. If you want to be absolutely clear, just underscore the phrase “...the Shadowy Figure is actually Bob.”\n\n(By the way, the above example assumes that we have seen Bob earlier in the script; thus, his name does not need to be placed in all-CAPS.)\n\nFrankly, I would prefer the following treatment so that the correct name appears above a speech Bob makes:\n\nSuddenly, a shadowy figure approaches her from the side.\n\nBOB\n\nSandy!\n\nSandy nearly screams until she sees that the shadowy figure is actually Bob.\n\nNow, let's look at a second possible exception to our general guideline: the revelation follows the character's introduction by several pages.\n\nPotential problems arise when the first appearance of the Shadowy Figure precedes the revelation of the Shadowy Figure's identity by several pages or even dozens of pages. In such cases, it's usually best to choose clarity. Perhaps you could refer to the character as BOB AS SHADOWY FIGURE.\n\nHowever, if you choose to keep the Shadowy Figure's identity a secret, then make sure that the revelation of the Shadowy Figure's identity pops out to the reader. For example, I would consider a separate paragraph that reads something like this:\n\nThe Shadowy Figure is Bob.\n\nThat dramatic strategy might be appropriate in movies like JAGGED EDGE where it is essential to keep the identity of the killer a secret until the end.\n\nIncidentally, underscore key points in narrative description only rarely, maybe once or twice in a screenplay, if at all. Of course, the main thing is to be—you guessed it!—clear. Keep writing!\n\nMay 2022\n\nIT'S READY WHEN IT'S READY\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhen do you know when your script is ready to send somewhere? Is it always a guessing game? I've been published, but I've never sold a script, so I don't have the faintest idea.\n\nANSWER\n\nSince you've been published, I might ask you, \"When did you know your piece was ready to submit to be published?\" That answer will help you with your script. Here are a couple of additional ideas.\n\nFor some screenwriters, it's the writer's \"inner voice that knows\" that tells them.\n\nFor many screenwriters, when they find themselves reviewing their script and only making a word change here and a word change there, they know that 1) they need to have their writers group or script consultant give them the go-ahead to market it, or 2) they can now begin to market it without the additional feedback.\n\nA VICTORIAN NOTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow would one format a scene that is in black and white or in a vintage style of photography that then cuts (in the following scene) to regular color photography? My opening scene is set in Victorian England, 1800s, and once the credits roll, it will pick up in modern times.\n\nANSWER\n\nYou could include a note after your first scene heading (slug line):\n\nNOTE: This scene is in black and white.\n\nOr, you could open your screenplay as follows:\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. LONDON – DAY – BLACK & WHITE\n\nA dirty, gray city.\n\nSUPER: \"LONDON, 1876\"\n\nAt the very end of the scene, write:\n\nNOTE: The remainder of the movie is in color.\n\nIncidentally, don't refer to CREDITS in a spec screenplay.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nApril 2022\n\nCROWD REACTIONS\n\nQUESTION\n\nIn my final scene, the protagonist has a chance meeting with the antagonist on a busy street corner. At the moment they meet, both characters are taken by surprise and each emotes loudly drawing the attention of the crowd who exclaim in shock, surprise, disbelief, and curiosity. Example: \"Did you see that?\" \"Holy cow!\" \"It's on now!\" \"Oh, hell no!\" \"Dude, you messed up,\" and \"Kick his butt.\"\n\nHow can I best format these various exclamations by the crowd, when in essence there are many voices speaking at a given moment in time?\n\nANSWER\n\nSince it doesn't matter who says these lines, you could simply write them as one speech as follows:\n\nVOICES IN THE CROWD\n\n(overlapping)\n\nDid you see that? Holy cow! It's\n\non now! Dude, you messed up. Kick\n\nhis butt!\n\nHowever, these are all throwaway lines, and I suspect it hardly matters what anyone says. This kind of dialogue is usually created ad lib at the shoot. Unless one or more of the specific crowd comments are important, you can probably get away with a line of description, something like the following:\n\nThe passers-by, sensing a coming fight, make room for it and shout at Butch and Bobo, egging them on.\n\nA NUMBERS GAME\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do I write numbers in time? For example, \"I ran the marathon in 3:45:22.\"\n\nANSWER\n\nAs you know, in narrative description, you can write out numbers as numbers. In dialogue, you should write out numbers as words, except for dates (such as July 4, 1776) and names (R2-D2, Agent 99). My suggestion is to write out your speech the way your character would actually say it. Here is one possibility:\n\nSUSAN\n\nDI ran the marathon in three,\n\noforty-five, twenty-two.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nMarch 2022\n\nTWO-HEADED CHARACTERS\n\nQUESTION\n\nI was wondering what would be the proper way to introduce a character under an assumed identity. Angela, a young television reporter, meets Brightman, her new cameraman, while on their way to shoot a story in Baghdad. In a later scene, Angela contacts her boss in New York to find out that \"Brightman can't get out of Toronto,\" and the person identifying himself as Brightman is actually an NSA operative. Should I introduce him as Brightman (to keep the level of suspense) or as an NSA agent?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe last thing you want is a reader who gets confused and thinks there are two characters, where in fact there is one character with two heads (or identities). Thus, there are two general guidelines to keep in mind in situations like this one:\n\nBe consistent in the character cue.\n\nBe clear. In other words, be absolutely clear so that you don't lose or confuse the reader, and refer to the character in exactly the same way in the character cue throughout your script.\n\nOf course, you can refer to the character in a variety of ways in narrative description and in speeches.\n\nIf your character's real name is actually Brightman, then this is a no-brainer; refer to him as BRIGHTMAN in the character cue throughout the script. However, if his name is not actually Brightman, but Jones (the NSA operative), then you have two options:\n\nRefer to him as JONES throughout the script, even though everyone thinks he is BRIGHTMAN for the first little while. That option will kill the suspense in your particular script.\n\nCall him BRIGHTMAN, but begin to refer to him as BRIGHTMAN/JONES or JONES/BRIGHTMAN or JONES AS BRIGHTMAN at the moment his true name is revealed.\n\nFor example, if the character is called BRIGHTMAN until the very end, I would refer to him as BRIGHTMAN throughout the script and maybe go to BRIGHTMAN/JONES at the end. However, if we learn that his name is JONES on page 10, then I would probably use JONES in the character cue throughout the script with the early explanation that people call him Brightman even though his name is Jones. Choose the option that makes the most sense and which will be clearly understood by the reader.\n\nBy the way, I do not see a reason to refer to him as NSA AGENT since he is apparently an important character, and, as such, should be referred to by name.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nA VICTORIAN NOTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow would one format a scene that is in black and white or in a vintage style of photography that then cuts (in the following scene) to regular color? My opening scene is set in.\n\nANSWER\n\nYou could include a note after your first scene heading (slug line):\n\nNOTE: This scene is in black and white.\n\nOr, you could open your screenplay as follows:\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. LONDON – DAY – BLACK & WHITE\n\nA dirty, gray city.\n\nSUPER: \"LONDON, 1876\n\nAt the very end of the scene, write:\n\nNOTE: The remainder of the movie is in color.\n\nIncidentally, don't refer to CREDITS in a spec screenplay.\n\nCITING SOURCES\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am entering a contest regarding family abuse by writing a small script for a commercial. I am wondering, though, if I have an image and then FADE OUT and have a spoken quote regarding the abuse, do I cite my source within the spoken quote, or do I include it as part of the shot?\n\nANSWER\n\nI think you're smart to cite your source, since doing so will likely give your commercial more credibility. The same could be done in a spec feature script for a particular quote. You could have the narrator cite the source as long as that didn't seem intrusive. Certainly, that's done a lot in documentaries.\n\nFor your commercial, since you will FADE OUT and the quote will be spoken, why not superimpose the citation over the black screen while or after the narrator speaks, as follows:\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\nNARRATOR\n\nAmerica's Foster Care system is\n\na quagmire that is spawning a\n\ngeneration of forgotten and\n\nforsaken children.\n\nSUPER: \"Time Magazine, November 13, 2020.\"\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nGETTING ANIMATED\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am working on a script for a film that would contain several short animated segments. How should these be worked into the script? Is there a standard format for this?\n\nANSWER\n\nHandle it with a special scene heading, just the way you'd handle a DREAM or FLASHBACK or MONTAGE that you need to work into the script. For example, here's one possible way:\n\nANIMATION -- SILLY BILLY MEETS THE MONKEY MAN\n\nAnd then describe your scene or sequence of shots, just as you would with a MONTAGE or DREAM SEQUENCE.\n\nWe often forget that there are basic principles behind formatting. These aren't just a bunch of arbitrary rules. So don't be afraid to extrapolate from some known principle if you come up with a new screenwriting situation. What if the above were a dream? Handle it like this:\n\nDREAM -- SILLY BILLY MEETS THE MONKEY MAN\n\nor...\n\nEXT. AMAZON JUNGLE - DREAM\n\nSilly Billy and his friends hike the jungle trail. Suddenly, the Monkey Man drops out of a tree.\n\n...And so on.\n\nWhat if you have an animated dream? Just call it that, an ANIMATED DREAM, in your special scene heading.\n\nIf it is a full scene, use this scene heading:\n\nEXT. AMAZON JUNGLE – DAY - ANIMATION\n\nAnd then write out the scene just as you would for any other scene.\n\nSimply apply fundamental formatting principles. As screenwriters, we must understand formatting to fully understand spec writing. This is something I really get animated about.\n\nNOTE: The new 2022 printing of Dr. Format Tells All will be available sometime in January. If you want to be totally up-to-date, order the book at keepwriting.com and then email me directly (dave@keepwriting.com) that you want the 2022 printing. I hope the new year will be a productive one for you.\n\nDecember 2021\n\nVOICE OVER ACTION\n\nQUESTION\n\nIs the following correct? It's the only way I can figure out how to format it:\n\nINT. COURTHOUSE – DAY\n\nThe judge looks doubtful.\n\nJUDGE\n\nI need to know more about\n\nthe incident.\n\nPROSECUTOR (V.O.)\n\nWell, your honor, according to the\n\nproprietor, the defendant blah,\n\nblah, blah...\n\nSERIES OF COORDINATED SHOTS TO (V.O.) ABOVE\n\n-- Night life along the beach [to set tone].\n\n-- Inside building, lots of noise, music, smoke....\n\n-- At other end of the building, patrons....\n\n-- A fight breaks out and bouncers pounce....\n\nBACK TO PRESENT COURT SCENE\n\nJUDGE\n\nGood Lord! Anything else?\n\nANSWER\n\nI realize that the above is purposely brief to save space. Naturally, you would want your descriptions of shots to be more specific and visually clear. And, of course, you would write out every word the prosecutor says. Having noted that, let's discuss your problem.\n\nThe above is poor format. If you are going to have the prosecutor speak while we see visual images, then you should write in that fashion. Don’t worry about “coordinate shots”; the coordination will be clear by how your place the action and dialogue. Here's a partial revision to illustrate what I mean:\n\nPROSECUTOR (V.O.)\n\nWell, your honor, according to the\n\nproprietor...\n\nEXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT\n\nThe defendant runs by and glances at the building.\n\nAnd then you would continue the narration over the visual description. The idea is to describe what we will visually see on the movie screen. At the end of this scene, you could write:\n\nINT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThere is a potential problem in proceeding in the above manner. As a general rule, the narration should not repeat what the audience is already seeing on the silver screen. Perhaps a more effective approach to this scene would be to let the prosecutor begin his explanation, and then cut to the boardwalk along the beach and show us what happened without any voice over narration. In any case, good luck and keep writing!\n\nNovember 2021\n\nSILENCE IS GOLDEN\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat does MOS mean?\n\nANSWER\n\nIt means \"without sound.\" The reason it is MOS instead of WOS (for without sound) is because it originates with Austrian-born director Eric von Stroheim, who would say, \"Ve’ll shoot dis mid out sound.\" Thus, MOS\n\nWith MOS, we see the characters’ lips moving, but we don’t hear their voices or the sounds around them. What follows is a paragraph written without the use of the MOS device:\n\nThe van rumbles along. Inside, two twenty-something parents, BUSTER and CAROL shout at each other but their words cannot be heard.\n\nHere is the same paragraph using the MOS device:\n\nThe van rumbles along. Inside, two twenty-something parents, BUSTER and CAROL shout at each other MOS.\n\nBoth paragraphs have the exact same meaning and both are correct.\n\nKARAOKE KATIE\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat is the proper format when writing the dialogue of a character singing a karaoke song?\n\nANSWER\n\nJust describe your character picking up the microphone, and then write out the lyrics that he sings in italics, as in the example below.\n\nIf you wish, you can indicate that the character is \"singing\" in parentheses, as I do below, or you can omit the parenthetical entirely:\n\nDELBERT\n\n(singing)\n\nKatie, Katie\n\nGive me your answer do.\n\nI’m half crazy\n\nall for the love of you.\n\nAnd keep singing…er…writing!\n\nOctober 2021\n\nTV TROUBLES\n\nQUESTION\n\nLet’s say I want to use the television as a secondary scene. Should I use a scene heading like the following?\n\nNEWS REPORTER ON TV\n\nOr should I use this one:\n\nON TV\n\nWhat if I want the person watching TV to be interrupted by the voice of someone else in the room? How should I write that?\n\nANSWER\n\nSince the reporter on TV will be speaking, I suggest you use him or her as a character rather than a scene heading (slug line). Here’s my suggestion, and we’ll create Mark who is off screen on the phone:\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM – DAY\n\nJessica grasps her lottery ticket while watching TV. The phone RINGS.\n\nTV REPORTER\n\nToday’s lottery numbers are....\n\nMARK (O.S.)\n\nHoney, it’s Jimmy the Thumb. Your\n\nloan is due.\n\nYou could use the TV as a scene heading if the audience needs to see what is playing on the TV monitor. For example:\n\nON TV\n\nAn ANNOUNCER with a plaid suit and bow tie waves his hand like a magician.\n\nTV REPORTER\n\nToday’s lottery numbers are....\n\nBACK IN THE LIVING ROOM\n\nJessica grasps her lottery ticket.\n\nKeep writing.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\nWRESTLING WITH ACTION DESCRIPTIONS\n\nQUESTION\n\nI'm writing a screenplay about the world of professional wrestling, and I'm wondering how specific I have to be in wrestling and fight scenes. Do I need to write them out move by move, or is that considered amateurish? Is it enough to give a general description and maybe specify only key moves?\n\nANSWER\n\nI think you have the right idea in that last question. You don't usually need to describe every specific action, but you need to describe enough of the action that the reader can \"see\" what is happening. Thus, you will use specific language and describe specific details, but you will not usually need to describe every detail.\n\nIn dramatic moments, such as the end of the fight, you might want to describe all of those last specific moves. To be honest, there's an element of subjectivity here, and you must decide how much description is enough for your particular screenplay.\n\nIn reading the wonderful sword fight scene in William Goldman's The Princess Bride, you'll notice that many specific actions are described, and that there are sections of summary descriptions.\n\nWhat follows is the description of specific moves:\n\nInigo dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword.\n\nThe Man in Black casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks perfectly.\n\nThen, the Man in Black copies Inigo. Not copies exactly, improves. He dives for the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a 9.7 backflip.\n\nThen, a little later, we have a summary description that, although a summary, describes specific details:\n\nInigo, moving like lightning, thrusts forward, slashes, darts back, all in almost a single movement and...\n\nThe Man in Black dodges, blocks, and again thrusts forward, faster than ever before, and again he slashes.\n\nNotice the use of action verbs.\n\nEarlier in the scene, the following summary description appears:\n\nAnd in a frenzy, the Man in Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails. Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing.\n\nIn the above example, we don't see any specific moves, but we get a good sense of what is happening, especially in the context of the action that has preceded this moment (which I have not provided).\n\nThe bottom line is to help the reader visualize the action, and to keep the reader excited, enthralled, and intrigued without confusing her. Good luck and keep writing.\n\nAUGUST 2021\n\nMUST FORMATTING BE PERFECT?\n\nQUESTION\n\nIs it true that if you violate screenplay format in any way, you're immediately rejected?\n\nANSWER\n\nNo.\n\nIf you've written a riveting story, but there are a few minor errors in formatting, the script is not going to be tossed into the can, in most cases. The problem comes when your errors in formatting become confusing or distracting to the reader. When a writer pays insufficient attention to formatting conventions or uses his or her own inimitable formatting style, the resulting script is usually both confusing and distracting.\n\nYour goal, therefore, is to strive for correct format and be consistent in how you apply formatting tools, but not to obsess over it to the point that you buy a hand gun.\n\nPerfection is not the goal; excellence is.\n\nTO FORMAT OR NOT TO FORMAT....\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhy must a script be formatted, if the point is to tell a good story?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe short answer is because you want to sell your script. It's possible to sell your story in treatment form, but it will be for a lot less money…unless you are an established writer. A treatment is just an idea. A producer and agent want to see a completed script.\n\nAs a developing writer, it's normal to view formatting conventions as a kind of an arbitrary rigid box that you must force the content of your story into, but that's missing the point. It's time to re-frame.\n\nFormatting is the language of screenplays. It's a flexible communication guide for expressing your story in a way that other professional collaborators (producers, directors, cinematographers, readers, agents, and others) can clearly understand. In reality, formatting guidelines truly are a friend.\n\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTION\n\nBut isn't the story more important?\n\nANSWER\n\nYes, but properly formatting your story is like dressing it up for a job interview; it makes a positive first impression. In addition, a properly formatted script demonstrates that you are serious and professional. And that you want to keep writing!\n\nJUNE 2021\n\nTIME STANDS STILL\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have two questions please.\n\nFirst, how would I format someone's dialogue if her voice fades away in the middle of her speech and becomes just background noise because the attention is elsewhere?\n\nFor example, I have a scene in a museum where the guide is speaking to the crowd about the display, and at first we hear her speech very clearly and John, the main character, is focused on what she [the guide] is saying; but then, John sees someone in the crowd he used to be in love with, and time slows. The guide's speech becomes background noise.\n\nMy next question is, if you have a slow motion sequence of shots, but you want several different camera angles on it, like in the above scene, and you want the action around them to continue in regular time, as if they are in their own dimension (like The Matrix action scenes, only everything else around them keeps moving as usual) what would be the slug line [scene heading] for that?\n\nANSWER\n\nHere's an example to answer your first question:\n\nJohn listens to the museum guide.\n\nGUIDE\n\nAnd this is T-Rex. It’s probably....\n\nThe Guide’s voice FADES into silence and all motion SLOWS at the moment John spots Debi standing in the distance.\n\nIn answer to your second question:\n\nThe Guide's voice FADES at the moment that John spots Debi in the distance.\n\nWhen he catches her gaze, they move in SLOW MOTION towards each other while everything around them moves in REAL TIME.\n\nAnd then describe more of what we see. You don't need a new scene heading (slug line). I placed the technical directions in all-CAPS.\n\nIn your second question, you refer to several different camera angles. I worry that you are getting so technically involved that you are acting as the director rather than the writer and are missing opportunities to improve the content of your story.\n\nAs an alternative, I suggest that you describe different facial expressions, gestures, or small actions to reveal what the characters might be thinking or feeling at this key moment and/or to characterize them. Keep your focus on the story and characters, and keep writing.\n\nMAY 2021\n\nTV TRANSITION\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat is the correct way to describe the situation where video-taped footage is shown on a monitor in a television studio before cutting to an interviewer with an interviewee who discuss what was in the video footage just shown?\n\nANSWER\n\nWhat you describe could be visualized in a number of ways. That means there are a variety of ways to approach the situation. In any case, the formatting problem is really about how to make the transition from the monitor to the interviewer. Here is what I see:\n\nEXT. BURNING HOUSE – DAY\n\nThe house is completely engulfed. Firefighters battle the blaze.\n\nINT. TV STUDIO – DAY\n\nVideo of the same burning house plays on a TV monitor.\n\nBelow on an interview couch sit Chester Bolt and a uniformed Fire Captain who watch the TV monitor.\n\nChester turns his head towards the studio cameras.\n\nIf Chester and the Fire Captain are appearing in the screenplay for the first time, then their names above would appear in all-CAPS.\n\nIf Chester and the Fire Captain are watching a live broadcast of the burning building from the TV studio, I would show that using the term SAME (meaning \"at the same time\"), as follows:\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - SAME\n\nI would then adjust the description accordingly.\n\nCAN I USE SPECIAL SLUGS?\n\nQUESTION\n\nI know I should avoid camera directions, close-ups, and so on, but what about slug lines for phone conversations and words that appear on the movie screen?\n\nANSWER\n\nCertainly, you will use special headings (or slug lines) for FLASHBACKS, MONTAGES, INSERTS, INTERCUTS for telephone conversations, and other special situations.\n\nBut above all, focus on the story and characters, and keep writing.\n\nAPRIL 2021\n\n3 QUICK SCENES IN A ROW\n\nQUESTION\n\nPlease help with a scene that involves my character Melanie, sitting at a table, who talks with three men in sequence during a speed dating session. Here is what I have written so far:\n\nINT. BLUES BAR – NIGHT\n\nDuring the whole sequence the camera stays on the men's face, like an interrogation/interview.\n\nA nervous MAN sits at Table 4.\n\nMAN #1\n\nSamantha?\n\nMELANIE\n\nExcuse me?\n\nMAN #1\n\nYou're not Samantha? Oh, I see\n\nyour badge now. Sorry. Then I\n\ncannot talk. I'm only here for\n\nSamantha.\n\nMELANIE\n\nWhat?\n\nThe dialogue continues until....\n\nMAN #1\n\nThree minutes! Times up.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA MAN older than Man #1 sits at Table 4.\n\nAnd so on,\n\nANSWER\n\nLet's avoid the editing direction (CUT TO) and write this using one master scene heading along with three secondary headings. Also, to keep the camera on the three men, we'll simply put Melanie off screen (O.S.). Also, let's give each man a bit more personality and provide some description of the master location:\n\nINT. BLUES BAR – NIGHT\n\nDark and smoky. Sultry music. Ten couples sit at ten tables.\n\nAT TABLE 4\n\nsits TWITCHY MAN fumbling with a cigarette.\n\nTWITCHY MAN\n\nSamantha?\n\nMELANIE\n\nExcuse me?\n\nTWITCHY MAN\n\nYou're not Samantha? Oh, I see\n\nyour badge now. Sorry. Then I\n\ncannot talk. I'm only here for\n\nSamantha.\n\nMELANIE\n\nWhat?\n\nThe dialogue continues until....\n\nTWITCHY MAN\n\nThree minutes! Times up.\n\nMOMENTS LATER\n\nAGED HIPPIE sits at the same table.\n\nAnd so on, until we've seen all three men. The above, of course, is not the only way to handle the above situation, but it is one way. Have fun and keep writing!\n\nMARCH 2021\n\nSLUG LINE ISSUES\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhen writing slug lines, when do I have to include the EXT. and INT.? In some scripts, I see slug lines with them and others without them. What gives?\n\nANSWER\n\nAlthough the term \"slug line\" has its origins in journalism, it is used extensively in screenwriting to refer to scene headings. There are two kinds of scene headings (or slug lines) that we are dealing with in your question.\n\nA master scene heading contains the master (or primary) location. A secondary scene heading refers to a secondary location within the master location. In the scene below, the master location is the interior of the convenience store. Secondary locations that are part of the master location include the counter and the aisle.\n\nMaster scene headings generally have three parts: camera placement (EXT. or INT.), the master (or primary) location, and the time (DAY or NIGHT). Since secondary locations are part of the master location, secondary scene headings are more abbreviated. Let's look at an example:\n\nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NIGHT\n\nA man wearing a werewolf Halloween mask enters.\n\nAT THE COUNTER\n\nthe clerk freezes in fear.\n\nIN THE AISLE\n\na young couple huddles together.\n\nBACK AT THE COUNTER\n\nthe masked man opens a large paper sack.\n\nMASKED MAN\n\nTrick or treat.\n\nThese secondary headings could have been written as follows, if preferred:\n\nCOUNTER\n\nAISLE\n\nThe important thing to remember is you don't use a secondary scene heading unless that secondary location is part of the master location. This technique is usually used where you have a long scene, such as an important action scene; the secondary scene headings help break that long scene into shorter units. For example, in CASABLANCA, a master scene heading might look like this.\n\nINT. RICK'S PLACE – NIGHT\n\nSecondary locations might include the following:\n\nBAR\n\nGAMING ROOM\n\nRICK'S TABLE\n\nIn some cases, you may want to include both a master location and a secondary location in the same scene heading, as follows:\n\nINT. SMITH HOME – KITCHEN – DAY\n\nNaturally, there can be a number of other secondary locations at the Smith home; for example, the living room, a bedroom, a hallway, the stairs, and so on.\n\nKeep in mind that secondary scene headings are seldom used in shooting scripts, and occasionally, you’ll find a producer who prefers all master scene headings.\n\nOften in spec writing, secondary scene headings are not necessary. Simplicity is a spec writing virtue. To demonstrate, let's revise that first scene at the convenience store without the secondary headings.\n\nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NIGHT\n\nA man wearing a werewolf Halloween mask enters. The clerk at the counter freezes in fear.\n\nIn one of the aisles, a couple huddles together.\n\nThe masked man steps toward the clerk and opens a Halloween sack.\n\nMASKED MAN\n\nTrick or treat.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nFEBRUARY 2021\n\nCAMERA MOVEMENT\n\nQUESTION\n\nYou preach that screenwriters should direct the camera without using camera directions. How would I do that for an opening scene where the camera pans the inside of a room, indicating various objects that help establish the character?\n\nANSWER\n\nOne way is to have a character walk through the room and look at each object. Another way is to describe the objects one by one, as follows:\n\nINT. JUDD'S ROOM – DAY\n\nThe door is painted purple in contrast to the bright green walls littered with posters of science stars —- Einstein, Hawking, Newton.\n\nAstrology charts and books sit on an old desk. Behind the desk is a large book case overflowing with books.\n\n...And so on.\n\nKeep in mind that most scenes you write will not be shot the way you write them anyway. Once your spec script is sold, a budget is created. The production manager must find the location or set, which will be \"decorated\" within the limits of the budget and may not match what you have written. Then, the director will block the scene and decide on how many \"set ups\" he or she needs, considering time and money limitations.\n\nCAMERA ANGLES\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do you handle changing the camera angle in a scene when doing so is important to the drama of the scene? I need to do this in a scene where a man is in his office talking on the phone with the camera showing the man. And then I want the camera to show what's out the window that the man was looking at.\n\nANSWER\n\nHow about this?\n\nJohn, phone to ear, laughs heartily as he gazes out the window. He suddenly stops, his expression a mask of terror. He drops the phone and steps back.\n\nOutside the window, John sees a window washer... with a gun.\n\nAnd yes, that last paragraph is a POV shot, but I didn’t need to use a camera direction.\n\nThere are probably a dozen ways to write the above. And there may be rare situations where you will use a camera direction or a camera angle or a technical direction in a spec screenplay. But first explore more creative ways, and then, if you feel you must use camera directions, do so very sparingly. Camera directions are for shooting (production) scripts, not the spec script you are writing.\n\nREADERS AND THE CAMERA\n\nQUESTION\n\nIf you could only name one thing that a reader [story analyst] wants, what would it be?\n\nANSWER\n\nMay I name more than one? I'll be brief.\n\nReaders want a wonderful story and original characters. And readers want a screenplay that is clear and easy to read. That's one reason for the exclusion of camera directions and other technical intrusions. Words and phrases in all-CAPS are more difficult to read, and slow down the reading process.\n\nYour narrative should describe visual images and sounds in clear, specific terms. It is more important to be clear than to be literary, and more effective to be readable than technical. Strive for short paragraphs; as a general guideline, limit long paragraphs to four lines in length. And keep writing!\n\nJANUARY 2021\n\nIF HIPPOS COULD FLY\n\nQUESTION\n\nI am writing a script that needs to have a certain person's POV [point of view]. Think along the lines of The Sixth Sense where the character sees \"things.\" My question is, whenever my character sees these \"things,\" should I put:\n\nJOE BLOW'S POV – A flying hippo.\n\nANSWER\n\nAvoid technical intrusions in a spec script. Try to direct the camera without using camera directions. In this case, just write:\n\nJoe Blow sees a flying hippo.\n\nThat has to be a POV shot.\n\nTHE CAMERA AS A CHARACTER\n\nQUESTION\n\nI'm writing a fictional documentary in the style of Waiting For Guffman, Bob Roberts, Man Bites Dog, etc., and I am wondering how to write scenes where the \"cameraman\" is an actual participant in the scene. Specifically, let's say the cameraman is interviewing someone, when suddenly an explosion occurs and everyone, including the cameraman, runs in terror. If I write \"Cameraman flees the area like a scared rabbit,\" that implies that we actually SEE him running, but in reality I want him running with the camera still rolling. What's the best way to do this?\n\nANSWER\n\nThere are many ways to handle this situation. Here's just one. Let's cross-cut between what is happening and what the camera sees. Let's say Nancy Cameraperson is filming teen sensation Rock Jock, who is being interviewed at the moment of the explosion:\n\nA nearby explosion rocks the area. andemonium.\n\nPeople run every direction.\n\nTHROUGH NANCY'S CAMERA\n\nRock Jock's plastic smile withers into a white mask of horror. He flees.\n\nImages of people fly by at awkward angles. There is no up or down.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nNancy runs, her camera bouncing awkwardly from her hand. Debris begins to fall from the sky.\n\nTHROUGH NANCY'S CAMERA\n\nA man trips and falls hard on the sidewalk. The image blurs from sidewalk to sky. A black and white plume of smoke billows into the blue.\n\nA uniformed man falls from somewhere right on us. Blackness.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nNancy is on the ground looking up. The uniformed man has fallen on her and on the camera. A siren wails. Nancy struggles to her feet.\n\nAnd then, keep cutting back and forth until the scene ends, and keep writing!\n\nDECEMBER 2020\n\nCAR SHOTS\n\nQUESTION\n\nShould the slug line [scene heading] for a scene showing a man inside a car that is outdoors say INT or EXT?\n\nANSWER\n\nFirst, let's clearly understand what INT. and EXT. mean. The references (INT. and EXT.) are to the camera location. INT. CAR means the camera is inside the car with the man. EXT. CAR means the camera is outside the car looking through the windshield or the car windows to the man. For that reason, many writers write something like this:\n\nINT./EXT. CAR – DAY\n\nThat means that the camera can be inside or outside the car, giving the option to the director. It also makes it easier for you, the writer; you won't have to CUT back and forth between interior (INT.) and exterior (EXT.) shots.\n\nPLAYBACK\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do you handle showing a conversation being heard when a character plays back an audio recording?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe dialogue on a taped recording is voiced over (V.O.); thus, it would be formatted as follows:\n\nDetective Lu flicks \"Play\" on his micro cassette and listens.\n\nFIONA (V.O.)\n\nI hid it in the desk drawer.\n\nThis principle applies to voices heard through the telephone, radio, or similar device, or any dialogue that is voiced over; meaning, any dialogue that is not spoken at the scene location.\n\nBy comparison, dialogue spoken by a character who is at the camera location, but who is not on screen (in the camera's view), is called off screen dialogue (O.S.).\n\nNOVEMBER 2020\n\nIT DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT-OF-VIEW\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow to I write a scene that shows what my character Bob sees through a pair of binoculars?\n\nANSWER\n\nYou appear to be describing a point-of-view (POV) shot through binoculars. What follows is one of many ways to handle the situation in a spec script. It’s the version I personally prefer because of its simplicity:\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY\n\nBob sits next to his hotel window and picks up his binoculars.\n\nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS\n\nBob sees a crowded corner newsstand, where hundreds of people purchase copies of Screenwriter software.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nBob drops the binoculars and dashes out of the room.\n\nThe notation \"BACK TO SCENE\" can be replaced with \"BACK TO HOTEL ROOM\" if you prefer. Notice that I did not use the camera direction POV; even so, it’s clearly a POV shot.\n\nThe following version is also correct, but a little clunky:\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY\n\nBob sits next to his hotel window and picks up his binoculars.\n\nEXT. CORNER NEWSTAND – THROUGH THE BINOCULARS\n\nHundreds of people purchase copies of Screenwriter software.\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM\n\nBob drops the binoculars and dashes out of the room.\n\nThe following third version is also correct, but I don't think it flows quite as well as the first two:\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM – DAY\n\nBob sits next to his hotel window and picks up his binoculars.\n\nTHROUGH THE BINOCULARS\n\nEXT. CORNER NEWSTAND\n\nHundreds of people purchase copies of Script magazine.\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM\n\nBob drops the binoculars and dashes out of the room.\n\nWhichever version you use, make sure you keep writing!\n\nOCTOBER 2020\n\nHEADLINE HEADINGS\n\nQUESTION\n\nI have no idea how to insert various news headlines. There are four headlines I want to use and I just don't know how to go about it.\n\nANSWER\n\nIf there was just one headline, you would simply include it in narrative description, as follows:\n\nThe news headline reads: \"Red Sox Win!\"\n\nThe following would work for more than one headline. (I'm using actual headlines that have appeared in newspapers.)\n\nMONTAGE – NEWSPAPER HEADLINES\n\nNewspapers drop on a table in succession with the following headlines:\n\n-- \"Milk Drinkers Turn to Powder\"\n\n-- \"New Housing for Elderly Not yet Dead\"\n\n-- \"Man Fatally Slain\"\n\n-- \"Convict Evades Noose; Jury Hung\"\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nTHE MESSAGE IS IN THE TEXT\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow would I format an e-mail conversation between two people?\n\nANSWER\n\nMy answer applies to text messaging, instant messaging, e-mailing, and the like. What follows assumes the entire scene is handled at one location, Burt's room. Also, instead of using BURT as a secondary scene heading, I could write BACK TO SCENE or BACK TO BURT:\n\nBurt types on his laptop.\n\nON BURT'S LAPTOP SCREEN\n\n\"Jan, come with me to Paris.\"\n\nBURT\n\nstands up and paces around his desk until he hears a little PING. He scrambles to his laptop.\n\nON BURT'S LAPTOP SCREEN\n\nJan's words appear:\n\n\"Was gonna break it off, but since\n\nyou mention Paris... okay.\"\n\nBURT\n\nscreams for joy.\n\nHere is an alternate method that is simpler, takes less space, and, in my eyes, is preferred:\n\nBurt types on his laptop: \"Jan, come with me to Paris.\"\n\nHe stands up and paces around his desk until he hears a little PING. He scrambles to his laptop.\n\nJan's words appear: \"Was gonna break it off, but since you mention Paris... okay.\"\n\nBurt screams for joy, then types with a flourish: “Continue d’ecrire.” [Keep writing.]\n\nNOTICE: “Write a Showcase Spec Script”—my series of 4 online courses—begins soon!

In this scene, Henry wants to find a book and so we cut to him in his room searching for the book and then come back to the Zoom platform.\n\nANSWER\n\nThis is a timely question, since Zoom and similar platforms are used a lot in our current pandemic.\n\nThe short answer is this: Zoom and Skype and other platforms are handled just like a TV set in the room. Since we see everyone who appears on the screen, they are \"in the scene.\" That means you do not need to label their dialogue as \"voice over\" (V.O.).\n\nHowever, if a character in the scene leaves her computer for a moment, but she can still hear the voices from her computer, those speeches would be marked \"off screen\" (O.S.). The characters are there in the scene, but are off screen (we can't see them). For example:\n\nINT. PEGGY'S ROOM – DAY\n\nPeggy keyboards and the meeting platform \"Zoom\" appears on her computer screen. She sees three faces in individual boxes, including Henry's.\n\nPEGGY\n\nI'm in, guys. Just a second. I need\n\na water.\n\nPeggy steps over to a table. Henry jokes.\n\nHENRY (O.S.)\n\nGet one for me, too.\n\nPeggy returns to her desk and holds up her water.\n\nPEGGY\n\nHa, ha. Here, drink up.\n\nNow, if you want to feature the computer screen so that it's the only thing we see (in other words, the computer screen becomes the movie screen), then write:\n\nPEGGY'S COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nOr, if you prefer:\n\nON PEGGY'S COMPUTER MONITOR\n\nThe meeting platform \"Zoom\" appears. Three faces in individual boxes appear.\n\nPEGGY\n\nI'm in, guys. Just a second. I need\n\na water.\n\nAnd then when you want to break away from the screen back to Peggy's room so that the audience can see Peggy again, just write:\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nOr:\n\nBACK TO PEGGY'S ROOM\n\nFinally, to answer your specific question, let's have Henry retrieve a book.\n\nINT. PEGGY'S ROOM – DAY\n\nPeggy keyboards and the meeting platform \"Zoom\" appears on her computer screen. She sees three faces in individual boxes, including Henry's.\n\nPEGGY\n\nI'm in, guys. Hey, Henry, go get\n\nyour copy of The Screenwriter's Bible.\n\nINT. HENRY'S LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS\n\nHenry races to the bookshelf and grabs the book.\n\nHENRY\n\nGot it!\n\nINT. PEGGY'S ROOM – CONTINUOUS\n\nPeggy scoots her chair closer to her desk and computer.\n\nPEGGY'S COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nAnd now write out their conversation. You already know how to break away from the computer monitor if you want to. Incidentally, you don't need to describe every change on the computer screen.\n\nFinally, I used the term CONTINUOUS in the above scene to show that the scenes are continuous (one after the other with no jump in time); however, since that is already obvious, you could omit CONTINUOUS if you prefer.

There are four headlines I want to use and I just don't know how to go about it.\n\nANSWER\n\nIf there was just one headline, you would use the INSERT heading and indent the headline as you would dialogue:\n\nINSERT – NEWS HEADLINE, which reads:\n\n\"Red Sox Win!\"\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nOr, probably better, simply write:\n\nThe news headline reads: \"Red Sox Win!\"\n\nThe quotation marks are essential in the above example.\n\nFor a series of four headlines, use the MONTAGE, as follows. (In the example below, I'm using actual headlines that have appeared in newspapers.)\n\nMONTAGE – NEWSPAPER HEADLINESS\n\n-- \"Milk Drinkers Turn to Powder\"\n\n-- \"New Housing for Elderly Not yet Dead\"\n\n-- \"Man Fatally Slain\"\n\n-- \"Convict Evades Noose; Jury Hung\"\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nOptions abound. Another idea is to create your own special heading:\n\nSERIES OF HEADLINES\n\nNewspapers drop on a table in succession.\n\nAnd then list your headlines as with the MONTAGE above.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nJULY 2020\n\nTALKING WITHOUT HEARING\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do I format a scene where the characters talk, but we don't hear what they say (muted conversation as background music is playing)? Do I just write, A and B in a heated argument, etc.?\n\nANSWER\n\nUse MOS. MOS means \"without sound.\" Thus, you could write something like this:\n\nAndrea and Roberto argue MOS.\n\nWHAT IF I BARELY HEAR HIM?\n\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTION\n\nHow do I format a scene where the conversation is heard in very low volume? Do I just write the dialogue or should I mention that the conversation is heard feebly on screen?\n\nANSWER\n\nJust describe what we hear, and if the audience hears the words, then write them out as dialogue. For example:\n\nSkinny speaks so softly, the words can be barely heard.\n\nSKINNY\n\nThere's a g-ghost behind you.\n\nOr, write:\n\nSKINNY\n\n(whispers)\n\nThere's a g-ghost behind you.\n\nOr, let's assume the speaker begins speaking, but our attention turns to something else so that we don't hear the entire speech. This is one way to handle that.\n\nMC\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, it's been\n\nmany years since...\n\nAs the MC drones on, John gives Fiona a peck on the cheek.\n\nAnd then John and Fiona can have a conversation or slip out of the convention hall or whatever. The ellipsis at the end of the speech implies that the MC continues with his speech, but you will still want to clarify that in narrative description. Before the actual shoot, the MC's entire speech will be written out so that the MC will speak, although his words will be barely perceptible.\n\nVAGUE LOCATIONS\n\nQUESTION\n\nCan I use the word \"some\" in scene heading like \"SOME HELIPAD\" or \"SOME RESTAURANT\" where it is not absolutely essential to mention the exact town or city name?\n\nANSWER\n\nMention the exact town or place if that's important, or give it a fictitious name. Otherwise, just write HELIPAD or RESTAURANT; for example:\n\nEXT. HELIPAD – DAY\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nJUNE 2020\n\nWRYLIES FOR READERS\n\nQUESTION\n\nI've been told that I should not write any wrylies at all. That's because actors just cross them out; they consider them an insult. Is that true? (Note: Wrylies is another term for the parentheticals or actor's direction found in dialogue blocks.)\n\nANSWER\n\nIf you are writing a spec script, you are not writing for actors. You are writing primarily for readers. Once a producer or agent receives your script, he or she hands it off to a reader who writes a coverage and either recommends your script or doesn’t recommend it. If it’s not recommended, it’s not read by the producer, agent, or any actors.\n\nOnce the spec script is sold, it will be converted into a shooting script. It's perfectly alright to include wrylies in your spec script. However, use them only when necessary. I often see redundant writing, such as the following.\n\nJim looked mad as hell.\n\nJIM\n\n(angrily)\n\nYou're making me mad!\n\nIn the above example, the description, the wryly, and the exclamation point are all unnecessary. Consider using a wryly when the subtext is not already clear from the content of the words or the context of the situation.\n\nYou can also use wrylies to describe small actions associated with the dialogue. For example:\n\nJIM\n\n(tips his hat)\n\nIf you're waiting for me,\n\nyou're going backwards.\n\nNotice I wrote \"tips his hat,\" not \"tipping his hat.\" This is not a big deal, but as a general guideline avoid the \"ing\" word in a wryly.\n\nFORMATTING OF WRYLIES\n\nQUESTION\n\nAm I correct that the following parenthetical is incorrectly formatted?\n\nDOLLY\n\nI'm Dolly Duncan. (Twirling her\n\ngolden hair.) My father owns HG\n\nHummers.\n\nANSWER\n\nYou're right that it's wrong. Wrylies should not be capitalized, and the period is unnecessary. Also, wrylies should be given their own place in the dialogue block. The following is correct:\n\nDOLLY\n\nI'm Dolly Duncan.\n\n(twirling her golden\n\nhair)\n\nMy father owns HG Hummers.\n\nGood luck and keep writing!\n\nMAY 2020\n\nO.C.D ABOUT O.S., O.C., AND V.O.\n\nQUESTION\n\nCould you please clearly explain O.S. and V.O.? I hear different things from different people, and sometimes I see O.C. in older scripts. I'm starting to get obsessed about this.\n\nANSWER\n\nIn addition to your question above, I have received three other emailed questions in the last couple of days asking me to explain O.S. and V.O., so let's relax and get into it.\n\nO.S. means \"off screen\" – the character is physically there at the scene location, but is not in the camera view; in the produced movie, we would hear her voice but not see her, even though she is there at the master (or primary) scene location.\n\nSuppose the scene takes place at SAL'S HOUSE and she is cooking in the KITCHEN while JOE watches TV in the LIVING ROOM. If the camera is on Sal in the KITCHEN, anything Joe says would be marked as O.S. because he is at the master or primary location (SAL'S HOUSE) but is not in the camera view.\n\nO.C. means \"off camera\" – it is an archaic term that means the same thing as O.S. Don't worry about O.C. and don't use it.\n\nV.O. means \"voice over\" – a voice originates from outside the scene location. Here are common situations where you would use this notation:\n\nA voice originates from outside the scene location through a phone or walkie-talkie or radio or some other device.\n\nA character in the scene recalls a speech he heard earlier in the screenplay, such as his mother reminding him to wear a coat. The speech is the mother's, but she is not there at the scene location. Thus, her speech originates from another location, and so it's marked V.O.\n\nA character begins to explain what happened a year ago. You cut to a FLASHBACK, but we still hear the character's voice from PRESENT DAY explaining what happened. The voice originates from outside the FLASHBACK location and is marked V.O.\n\nWe hear a disembodied voice: \"Luke, reach out with your feelings\" (Obi-wan in Star Wars IV). Whisperings from another world are marked V.O.\n\nWe hear the character's own thoughts at the moment; that is, the audience sees him and hears his voice, but his lips aren't moving. Thus, the speech originates from another location (probably a recording studio or looping studio). Incidentally, I don't recommend this application; it usually comes off as obvious exposition except in rare instances in broad comedies.\n\nA character narrates the story. The voice does not original from any of the scene locations and so it is marked V.O. If you use the term NARRATOR in the character cue (that is, the character name in the dialogue block), then V.O. is assumed and you don't have to use the term.\n\nO.S. and V.O. exceptions\n\nSuppose there is a TV in the scene, and the TV screen is in full view (within the camera frame or view). Technically, the person on the TV screen is at the scene location since the TV is at the scene location. Thus, the character that we see speaking on TV is like any other character in the room. Since we see him speaking, his speech is normal dialogue without any special notation.\n\nHowever, if the TV is at the scene location, but is turned away from the camera view and we don't see the character on the TV screen, her speech should be marked O.S. because she is technically there at the scene location, but she is not in the camera view.\n\nThe same goes for a Skype conversation on the computer or a FaceTime conversation on a smart phone.\n\nHolograms as in Star Wars IV: \"Help me Obi-wan. You're my only hope.\" Princess Leia's words would have no special notation since her image is there in the room (at the scene location) and we see her speaking.\n\nDid I miss anything? If you believe I did, then zip me off an email. Meanwhile, keep writing!\n\nNOTE: The above topic and hundreds of others are discussed in the new 7th edition of The Screenwriter's Bible, now available for purchase at www.amazon.com and www.keepwriting.com.\n\nAPRIL 2020\n\nIS IT INSERTABLE?\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhy do you go BACK TO SCENE again after an INSERT? Aren't we already in the scene?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe INSERT is a special heading that interrupts the scene, and BACK TO SCENE tells us we are now back to the main action. If you didn't write BACK TO SCENE, you probably wouldn't confuse anyone, but that's how all special headings of one scene in length work. Thus, a MONTAGE or a FLASHBACK or a DREAM would follow the same convention:\n\nINT. BEDROOM – DAY\n\nLittle Joey falls asleep.\n\nDREAM – THE MONSTER\n\nLittle Joey hears movement under his bed. He sits up, trembles, and then leans over his bedside to take a peek.\n\nIt's the Post Golden Crisp Sugar Bear who slides out from under the bed, puts his hands behind his head, crosses his legs, and starts crooning his cereal jingle.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nLittle Joey sits up in bed and starts singing the jingle.\n\nRather than BACK TO SCENE, I could have written BACK TO THE BEDROOM.\n\nHandle an INSERT in exactly the same way. The purpose of the INSERT is to draw attention to something specific, often an object, a note, or a letter.\n\n(I should mention that in an actual script, I wouldn't rely on the Post Golden Crisp Sugar Bear because I don't own the rights to that character. I'd make up something original. The above example is just to illustrate.)\n\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTION\n\nWhy use an INSERT in the first place?\n\nANSWER\n\nThese days, INSERTs are seldom used, and when they are used, it's usually for a long note or letter. Thus, you don't have to use the INSERT at all in your spec script.\n\nHere's an example of the INSERT as it was used in the past:\n\nBig Mack opens the note.\n\nINSERT – THE NOTE\n\n\"It's over, Baby.\"\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nYes, you should indent the content of a note or letter just like you would dialogue.\n\nWhat follows is what you are most likely to see in a screenplay today.\n\nBig Mack opens the note. It reads: \"It's over, Baby.\"\n\nIf you want the content of the note to pop out better to a reader, write it as a separate paragraph. And keep writing!\n\nMARCH 2020\n\nBUT I LOVE THAT SHOT!\n\nQUESTION\n\n[This question comes from a client after reading my evaluation of his script.] But Dave, that’s the way I want the scene shot!\n\nANSWER\n\nI realize that is what you want, but you’ll make a better impression on readers and producers if you avoid camera directions and special shots. Only use them if you have an overriding dramatic or comedic purpose for them. I suggest you look for a more readable way to present your material to a reader (who is almost always the first person to read your script and recommend it or not recommend it to producers, agents, and talent).\n\nBut there is other reason: the scene is not going to be shot that way anyway.\n\nThat’s the odds. Why? Here are the reasons:\n\nAfter your spec script is converted into a shooting script, the production manager or others will try to find locations that fit their budget. The location or set they choose will not likely match exactly what you had in mind, which could result in some changes to the scene.\n\nThe budget may not allow for certain shots or for many \"set-ups\" that involve changing camera position and lighting.\n\nThe director will need to block the scene in accordance with the location or sound stage (and set decoration) he or she is using.\n\nActors may add their two cents.\n\nFinally, some dialogue may need to be cut or changed; some lines may need to be added to fill out the scene.\n\nSometimes what is written on paper doesn’t translate to the silver screen. May I give you an example?\n\nThe thematic pier scene in Little Miss Sunshine was originally written for Dwayne and Frank to float on the ocean to add the symbolism of a baptism (new birth) when a wave crashes over them, but it didn’t work when they tried to shoot it that way. In fact, with the waves crashing over them became humorous. Thus, in the movie, the scene takes place on a pier overlooking the ocean. The essence of the scene remains unchanged; it still achieves the purpose the writer intended, but not in the way the writer envisioned.\n\nYour goal is to make sure the narrative description and dialogue are written wonderfully so that the scene’s purpose isn’t lost. After all, movie-making is a collaborative effort.\n\nIt's true that many movie scenes are shot the way they are written, but in reality, the spec script is not a blueprint for the eventual movie, but a guide to it. Its main purpose is to emotionally involve a reader who can recommend it. Present enough specific detail in your scene that the reader can \"see\" the action, \"feel\" the emotion, and \"get\" the scene, but don’t try to direct the scene with camera directions or through other means which are not acceptable anyway. And keep writing!\n\nFEBRUARY 2020\n\nPITCHING YOUR SCRIPT\n\nQUESTION\n\nWe continue to use Movie Magic Screenwriter software and enjoy it very much. We have completed a feature-length script and are looking to promote it. During our online travels, education, and feedback, it has been suggested that one way to promote the script is to send via email the tagline, logline and short background to producers to gain interest. Is this something you might recommend or is there another presentation process or form you might suggest?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe logline or concept statement that you mention is generally how you open a pitch. A logline is the complete story in one sentence; for example, here is the logline for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial:\n\nAn alien child is accidentally left behind on earth, but some earth children help him find his way home.\n\nA concept statement or tagline focus on the core concept of the story, and it can often be used as a logline. Here's an example from Air Force One:\n\nTerrorists hijack Air Force One.\n\nMost pitches benefit from a strong Big Event, as does the example above. The hijacking is the Big Event. (The Big Event is the major plot point that changes the central characters life at the end of Act 1 at about pages 20-30.)\n\nA premise is usually expressed as a \"what if\" question. For example:\n\nWhat if Peter Pan grew up?\n\nThat's the hook for Hook. And, incidentally, a hook is any brief statement (logline, concept, or premise) that hooks the reader or listener into the story.\n\nYou approach producers with a pitch, but that pitch can come in different forms:\n\nA written query letter, which is one page with about 3-4 short paragraphs that present the story concept and enough of the story to entice the reader to ask for the script. It seldom gives away the ending. This is mailed or emailed.\n\nA written one-sheet, which is essentially a one-page synopsis that contains beginning, middle, and end of your story, and will likely open with the logline or concept statement. The one-sheet is usually left behind after a pitching session at a pitch fest or pitch meeting. Think of it as your business card. It can be mailed or emailed just like a query.\n\nInciden"
