        "text": "An occasional series on eminent Scots undervalued by the public or forgotten\n\nAlan Sharp (1934 – 2013)\n\nLooking at the life and times of Alan Sharp, author and screenwriter, leaves me with an edgy feeling he would have made a great pal in short bursts, but not as a life-long friend. His lifestyle was too peripatetic for my habits, too restless, too boozy. I suspect he’d have a drink and a natter with me in the pub, go to the toilet, and never come back.\n\nIn appearance and quirks and even choice of some subject matter he had a remarkable similarity with the younger television playwright Peter McDougall. Though a generation separated, both spent time as Greenock shipyard workers. But Sharp’s curly head of hair and his career achievements will long outlast those of barfly McDougall.\n\nSharp came to prominence with an explosion, his first novel, A Green Tree in Gedde, (1965), an immensely mature work for a first time author. It seemed a reawakening of the Scottish literary tradition after a decade or more of stagnation. Frustratingly, the trilogy Sharp promised petered out after the second, less stirring work, The Wind Shifts. The third novel never materialised. Sharp got seduced by Hollywood and its easy money.\n\nA Green Tree in Gedde, written in affection for Greenock was much admired its day. A tough story of four young people searching for their identities, sexual and social, it won a Scottish Arts Council award, but soon after was withdrawn from public libraries because of the incestuous relationship at its centre.\n\nMy bookshelves hold a well worn copy. Today your attention is drawn to some of the dialogue which often wallows in the fashion of the time, self-analysis, but overcome by the long, poetic passages.\n\n“The roofs, slate blue slopes, everywhere; and chimneys crowned and capped with cans, coloured lustrous bronzes and yellow orange and mocha and cream, soot layered, rust red, and out of them lunging up in the duns and greys and dimble blues, uplanguors of slow emotion, colly spindills, culms of soft ruth, smoke psalms, lum plumes, purled prayer drifts, and everywhere enormously high great azure pend of heaven in which with its golden effulgence unimpaired by cloud the sun shone magnificently, heraldic blazon of day’s dominion.”\n\nBesides Green Tree, Sharp is best known for two great accomplishments: rekindling his career with the movie Rob Roy, and being the only writer to have four thrillers in cinemas on every side of London’s Leicester Square at the same time.\n\nThat has to be a Guinness World Record. Night Moves (1975) starring Gene Hackman was one of the four films, directed by Arthur Penn of Bonnie and Clyde fame.\n\nNight Moves demands multiple viewings. This modest but highly sophisticated noir is the story of an LA private detective hired to find a missing teenager, struggling to understand the overwhelming unconnected events he encounters, cuckolded by his wife, crippled by his old-school sleuthing methods that keep him back from his goal. Sharp’s gumshoe protagonist serves as a complete opposite of all those ingenious private eyes we’d seen in classic film noir, from Sam Spade onwards. It flopped at the box office, later realised by critics as a jewel of its kind.\n\nMoral ambiguity, mixed motives, irony and sex. Sharp felt those were the basic ingredients to make a decent screenplay, adding candidly:\n\n‘All the things I’ve written are pastiche. I get work because I’m a reliable craftsman. It’s like being a plumber: you come in, do a tidy job, and you’re not a prick to deal with, so people hire you again.’\n\nOthers had a far higher opinion of Sharp’s achievements. British film critic Trevor Johnston, declared him ‘Britain’s greatest living screenwriter,’ a man so gifted that his first five scripts were filmed back-to-back during the early 70s.\n\nSharp entered British television at just about the best time in 20th century history for a writer to do so, though unlike so many of his contemporaries he did none of his best work there.\n\nHe won a Prix Italia for his radio play The Long Distance Piano Player in 1962, later turned into a television play starring the saturnine Ray Davies as a man attempting to beat the world record for non-stop piano playing. It received a lukewarm reception. Sharp realised small-scale movies were his metier.\n\nSharp found his natural home in Hollywood with The Last Run (1971), a chase thriller starring George C. Scott. He followed it with the then fashionable Easy Rider actor as star, Peter Fonda, contract-hot but uncharismatic, in his screenplay The Hired Hand, (1971). Fonda directed and starred.\n\nIn line with Hollywood serendipity – my own experience included – Sharp’s befriending of Fonda coincided with Fonda’s marriage break-up reflected in the script’s story, giving Fonda the motivation he needed to express his feelings through the main character.\n\nSharp felt that Fonda’s obsession with the story and his heavy drug use led to an over-complicating of the piece, and the end result was largely ignored by the critics though it has since won reappraisal for its study of the clash between machismo, male to female affection. Sharp relied less on an understanding of politics to compose his stories and more on his own life, husband to four wives and six children.\n\nBy this point in his burgeoning film career a student of his work will spot many of his stories were constructed like the classic western. Sharp himself was minded to describe his film scripts as “existential melodramas”. In fact, there are so many memorable filmed dramas about Scotland and out of Scotland one could lump them all into that single category of the western genre. You can see why so many central belt Glaswegians enjoy square dancing!\n\nSharp’s Billy Two Hats, (1974) and his earlier Burt Lancaster vehicle in which hero and villain are indistinguishable, Ulzana’s Raid, (1972) based on the exploits of a real life Apache warrior, proclaim a consistently high output. An aged apache and an aged scout sensing death is imminent decide to break free and live life as they would want to. Ulzana’s Raid is one of his few works still shown on late night television.\n\nHis last big success, Rob Roy, (1995) was produced on the back of Braveheart’s massive worldwide publicity – a common Hollywood method of hitching your wagon to an event movie. It is conventional in construction and presentation but all the better for it. The film’s existence is due to the unswerving devotion of fellow Scot and producer, Peter Broughan, a man like myself who found Scotland’s support of filmmaking not conducive to sustaining creative work.\n\nWith a little too much emphasis on honour and pride as a man’s guiding morality when pragmatism will solve most man-made predicaments, the script of Rob Roy is superior to Braveheart’s, the latter written by ubiquitous pulp fiction novelist, the American Randall Wallace, Braveheart inspired by his namesake’s life. Rob Roy includes a scene of buggery to emphasis how evil is the chief villain, head of the English regiment.\n\nRob Roy’s superiority is in large part due to Sharp’s deft hand at classic western plotting and Broughan’s experience of script editing. Unfortunately it had a less than competent director at its helm, the sullen and plodding Michael Caton-Jones – later to junk the ‘Jones’ when he divorced his wife. Nevertheless, reviews were universally excellent for script, acting, and photography, and the lead star Liam Neeson when on to greater things. Neither Sharp nor Broughan were honoured properly in their homeland.\n\nRob Roy had an estimated budget of $28 million US dollars managing to gross $31 million at the US box office, not quite enough to convince investors Scottish historical themes are a rich vein of gold unexhausted.\n\nAs for his other films, readers are encouraged to search out The Osterman Weekend, (1983), an adaptation of a Robert Ludlum novel directed by Sam Peckinpah, and Little Treasure, (1985), starring Margot Kidder, which Mr. Sharp directed himself. Hollywood rewards good writers with a directing commission. You get one chance.\n\nAlan Sharp was born on January 12th, 1934, in Alyth, to a single mother. He was adopted at six weeks by Margaret and Joseph Sharp, who belonged to a local Salvation Army church. His adoptive father was a dockworker.\n\nSharp told the tale how he had fantasized as a child “that Humphrey Bogart was ma faither and Katharine Hepburn ma mither.” He left school at 14 and took a series of jobs, described in 2004:\n\n“Apprentice in local shipyards; worked as assistant to a private detective, English teacher in Germany, construction laborer, dishwasher, night switchboard operator for burglar alarm firm, and a packer for a carpet company; worked for I.B.M.; bummed around. Writer. Military service: British National Service, 1952-54.”\n\nSharp had a few idiosyncrasies. He sported a trademark walrus moustache. He had a fondness for white shoes; a creature of habit in his eating when ordering restaurant meals, an inveterate pub crawler – “let’s go somewhere different” usually meant the next pub – and a willingness to throw good money keeping his 1967 Oldsmobile on the road. Women found Sharp irresistible. (Yes, I asked a few.)\n\nSharp insisted on handwriting letters but also scripts in longhand. He loved sailing. He owned a flat-bottomed craft. His attachment to Scotland was absolute, though I never heard him speak of its independence. His movie fees gave him the choice of a warm corner of the planet in New Zealand, Kawau Island to be precise, his quiet refuge where he spent his time writing, sailing, and “workin’ on ma wee boat”.\n\nOne of his wives was the British novelist Beryl Bainbridge. Besides his daughter Louise, his survivors include his wife, Harriet Sharp; two sons, Mike and Daniel; three other daughters, Nola and Minnie Sharp and Ruth Davies; two stepsons, Rashan Hall and William Lewis; and 14 grandchildren. After writing procreation was another career.\n\nHow any woman managed to stay with him any length of time is a mystery, then again he married four times. But by penning Rob Roy for Liam Neeson he proved he had not lost a romantic connection with his Scottish roots. By the last years of his life he talked a good movie, a film of James Hogg’s Confessions of a Justified Sinner and a biopic of Rabbie Burns, but sadly they never appeared.\n\nFootball and a can of lager could be more important to Sharp than his current wife or the studio commission. To my eye tennis is athletically and aesthetically superior; he’d scoff at that as namby-pamby in comparison. When the world cup was on in Brazil he bought a motorised caravan and travelled south to the games from California. Months afterwards he was still travelling back stopping wherever took his fancy. That disconnect from whatever he knew yesterday seemed to be his hallmark.\n\nI had bumped into him once. It was as I turned a corner from Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica around a corner restaurant. He sat behind the waist-high screen at an outdoor table with his then wife Harriet. He looked older than his years, shoulders hunched, arms sprawled by his sides, his narrow-eyed gaze off into the distance at the sea beyond. He had only weeks to live, and I wonder now if he had been told then he had a brain tumour.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the online journal Writer’s Room, Sharp was asked his advice for novice writers. “If there’s a story you like, just write it up and see how it feels,” he replied. “It’s not illegal until you do something with it.” To that he added a coda: “Whatever ye dae, persevere.”\n\nYou can’t do otherwise than admire Sharp for the quality of his work and his love of life. His love of woman is questionable. His love of the bottle, sad. His attitude to life, to let it take you wherever it wants, contributed to the loss of a potentially fine novelist for Scotland but we gained a fine screenwriter."
