Only occasionally did I ﬁnd myself in front of the camera, and when I did my efforts usually wound up carpeting the ﬂoor of the cutting room. Nevertheless, those auditions were my ﬁrst introduction to screenplays, which seemed to me at the time to differ only slightly from theatrical stage plays. When I began to write, I considered the screenplay just as viable a literary form as the novel, the short story, and the stage play, and I approached screenplays with the same interest that I approached other narratives. It was not until I began my graduate studies in English that I discovered how much the screenplay and screenwriter were marginalized by the ﬁlm industry, the academy, and the literati. Literary scholarship, while fully absorbed with drama, ignored the screenplay, and ﬁlm studies, though aware of the screenplay as an interstitial cog in the ﬁlmmaking process, only occasionally cast a critical eye toward the written text, which had been the controlling narrative voice in most contemporary American ﬁlm production for nearly a century. Even Peter Brunette and David Wills’s engaging Screen/Play (Princeton University Press, 1989), which effectively argues that ﬁlm is a “type of writing” (61), avoids discussion of the writing that prescribes ﬁlm. In light of the screenplay’s pervasive inﬂuence over the twentieth century, the limited mention of the screenplay in both ﬁlm and literary studies struck me as curious. In the absence of adequate critical scholarship, screenplay analysis has fallen primarily under the auspices of vocational instruction. Much of what has been written about the screenplay over the last twenty-ﬁve years can be classiﬁed into three general types: books on the business of screenwriting, how-to books on screenwriting, and books on the vii\n\nEG:;68: structure of storytelling. There are exceptions, such as Kristen Thompson’s Storytelling in the New Hollywood, which critiques storytelling and its relationship to Hollywood ﬁlms, Lance Lee’s A Poetics for Screenwriters, which attempts to establish aesthetic principles for screenwriting, Marsha McCreadie’s The Women Who Write the Movies, which chronicles the shifting role of women screenwriters in the ﬁlm industry, and Andrew Horton’s Screenwriting for a Global Market1 (perhaps the closest example of screenplay scholarship to date), but most screenwriting books are instructional. Books such as Jennifer Lerch’s 500 Ways to Beat the Hollywood Script Reader and Carlos de Abreu and Howard Jay Smith’s Opening the Doors to Hollywood focus on the business of screenwriting, the how and where of selling a screenplay. Books such as Syd Field’s inﬂuential Screenplay, Linda J. Cowgill’s Secrets of Screenplay Structure, Alan A. Armer’s Writing the Screenplay, Robin U. Russin and William Missouri Downs’s Screenplay: Writing the Picture, and Tudor Gates’s Scenario: The Craft of Screenwriting, among myriad others, focus on practical methods for writing a screenplay. Books such as Mark Axelrod’s Aspects of the Screenplay and Lajos Egri’s The Art of Dramatic Writing focus on the craft of storytelling. These three categories denote general trends in the works; however, inevitable overlap occurs within works as books that focus on storytelling also offer some practical writing advice and technical books necessarily touch on storytelling. Books, such as Christopher Keane’s How to Write a Selling Screenplay and David Trottier’s The Screenwriter’s Bible, intentionally combine categories. The lack of critical attention paid to screenplays has not been lost on screenwriters, many of whom expected screenwriters to achieve more status than they actually have. Jeanie Macpherson, who enjoyed a forty-year collaboration with Cecil B. DeMille in the early days of ﬁlm, predicted in 1917 that “photo-dramatists” would become “as well known and as distinguished as the dramatists of the speaking stage . . . [and that] photodramatic writers . . . [would] be given their proper place and . . . be remembered for their contributions toward this new art” (qtd. in Francke 18). Ninety years later, we still ﬁnd screenwriters, such as Guillermo Arriaga, author of Babel (2006) and 21 Grams\n\n1. See also Horton’s Laughing Out Loud: Writing the Comedy-Centered Screenplay, which, despite its title, offers more than mere writing tips.\n\nviii\n\nEG:;68: (2003), struggling for adequate recognition. Arriaga aggravated director Alejandro González Iñárritu by claiming that he, as the writer of 21 Grams, deserved much of the credit for that ﬁlm’s success. Arriaga explains, “When they say it’s an auteur ﬁlm, I say auteurs ﬁlm. I have always been against the ‘ﬁlm by’ credit on a movie. It’s a collaborative process and it deserves several authors” (Rafferty 13). Actors frequently acknowledge the overarching signiﬁcance of the screenplay and its critical contribution to ﬁlm. William H. Macy, in an interview for The Cooler (2003), credits the screenplay for the establishment of character, claiming, “as an actor you need to go out and learn some skills, but in terms of preparation for understanding the character, it’s all on the page, and if it’s not on the page, you’re in trouble. If it ain’t on the page, the audience isn’t going to understand it” (Mitchell n.p.). Directors, too, often acknowledge the indispensable importance of the screenplay. Director Brett Ratner admits, “If it’s not on the page, then I’m not going to do it. I can’t create it” (Stack n.p.). Macy’s and Ratner’s comments echo a belief that can be traced back to the early days of ﬁlm: If it’s not on the page, it’s not on the stage. Screenplays occupy a space somewhere between literary studies and ﬁlm studies. Because they are written texts, they share an afﬁnity with other written forms. The dramatic principles at work in screenplays are the same as those in ﬁction and stage plays, thus they share a common literary heritage tracing back to Hellenistic theater, and are amenable to the earliest literary criticism—Aristotle’s Poetics. Because they are an integral part of the ﬁlmmaking process, screenplays are important to our understanding of the complex dynamic that embodies ﬁlm production. Three characteristics distinguish screenplay studies from traditional ﬁlm studies. First and foremost, the primary object under examination in screenplay studies should be the written text. This does not preclude reference or discussion of the ﬁlm. A screenplay and its resultant ﬁlm are intimately linked, which often makes reference to the ﬁlm unavoidable in the same way the ﬁlm studies scholars are sometimes compelled to make reference to a ﬁlm’s screenplay. Second, screenplay studies posit the writer (or writers) as the author of the work (i.e., the screenplay), and, at least, an author of the ﬁlm, as Arriaga argues. The dynamic interplay between a screenwriter’s vision and a director’s vision are ultimately what we see on a screen, and the interaction beix\n\nEG:;68: tween writing and ﬁlming are worthy of critical inquiry. This is no less true when directors author their own screenplays, as a director’s vision as a writer may differ from his or her vision as a director. Third, screenplay studies, like literary studies, should illuminate a reader’s understanding of a text, and thereby differentiate itself from pedagogy. The primary objective of screenplay studies should not be to help readers write screenplays any more than the primary objective of Hemingway scholarship is to help the reader write novels and short stories. Script Culture and the American Screenplay is an attempt to partially redress the dearth of scholarship involving the screenplay and argue for the importance of the screenplay as worthy of critical examination in both literary and ﬁlm studies. The book is divided into two sections. Part 1 (Foundations) offers three foundational discussions of the screenplay, tracing its evolution and emergence, examining its relationship to performance, and viewing it in light of Aristotle’s Poetics. Part 2 (Critiques) examines speciﬁc screenplays in its discussions of rhetoric, gender, and race. Chapters 6 and 7 look at screenplay adaptation and screenplays originally written for the screen. I have chosen to work with mainstream American screenplays, excluding, for the most part, screenplays for foreign, independent, and experimental ﬁlms. I have done so for a number of reasons, not the least of which are the difﬁculties inherent in obtaining and translating foreign screenplays and the fact that mainstream American ﬁlms dominate the worldwide ﬁlm industry. I am working under the assumption that most, if not all, of the screenplays I discuss in Script Culture and the American Screenplay are either widely known or readily accessible to readers. My hope is that this will make what follows accessible to a broad readership.\n\nx\n\nFoundations\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nForm and Function The Evolution of the Screenplay\n\nPrehistory The history of the screenplay begins about sixteen years after the birth of ﬁlm, in the 1910s, around the time Thomas Harper Ince began making ﬁlms.1 Jean-Pierre Geuens credits Ince as the one who ﬁrst “successfully managed to codify and standardize the entire practice of ﬁlmmaking” (82). Under Ince’s guidance, “writing for ﬁlm became truly efﬁcient for the ﬁrst time . . . and developed into the indispensable core” (82) of the ﬁlmmaking system. The written text that guided a ﬁlm’s production became a literary form. The text rendered the shots that the director later realized. Geuens points out that “screenplays . . . became detailed shooting scripts that were given to the director for implementation” (83). As with all shifts in power, when creative control increased in the screenplay, it decreased for production personnel, most signiﬁcantly, the director. Directors were forced to surrender much of their domain to writers. Some directors resisted the loss of control and Ince’s focus on the written word. Barry Salt argues that Ince’s inﬂuence may have temporarily stunted ﬁlm technique, deducing from the absence of multiple-angle cuts in An Apache Father’s Vengeance (1912)—\n\n1. Ince began writing and directing shorts in 1911, but it is perhaps best to mark the beginning of the screenplay around the middle of the decade when Ince moved into producing, around 1916 when he directed Civilization.\n\n3\n\n8=6EI:G a technique found in director Reginald Barker’s earlier ﬁlms for Reliance2—that “when Ince took over the Reliance company at the end of 1912 he also took over the director who knew how to” piece together shots from different angles (293). Nevertheless, many directors adopted the “Ince style” of ﬁlmmaking and Ince avoided conﬂicts with directors who were reluctant to adapt by employing directors “willing to work into his scheme of production” (Geuens 143). Screenplay form, which is bound by function and intimately linked to the ﬁlm performance, evolved quickly from the mid-1910s until sound and the introduction of dialogue around the end of the 1920s, when it settled into a format similar to the one still found in contemporary screenplays. The formation of the screenplay and its increasing signiﬁcance to ﬁlm during the silent era is the result of ﬁlm’s early transformation from an arcade novelty into a narrative medium. Complex storylines, multiple-shot scenes, and budget concerns forced ﬁlmmakers to plan the shape and structure of a ﬁlm before the start of principal photography. As Lewis Jacobs notes, “stories ended the production of the triﬂing ‘report’ or ‘incident’ ﬁlms” and reframed the motion picture as a complex narrative construction (67). Cameramen could no longer wander cities and scenic countrysides merely looking for something to capture on ﬁlm. They needed narratives on which to hang their visual images, and they needed a method for planning, recording, and recalling these narratives. Early producers, spurred by the popularity of narrative ﬁlm, scrambled for ideas, ﬁlming “half-remembered anecdotes, newspaper headlines, cartoons, jokes, domestic affairs, social issues, economic tribulations—all sorts of everyday American ideas and activities” (67), any shred of narrative that could be adapted to ﬁlm. Text, which was the primary repository of story at the turn of the century, became an attractive source of inspiration. Early predecessors of the screenplay did little more than frame the narrative context for a scene. One of the ﬁrst major infusions of story into ﬁlmmaking was Georges Méliès’s A Trip to the Moon (Le voyage dans la lune, 1902), which astounded American audiences and ﬁlm producers and involved a great deal of preparation from Méliès. One part of this preparation was the writing of a sparse scenario, which provided the\n\n2. Cf. Wheels of Destiny (1911).\n\n4\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay backbone for the ﬁnished ﬁlm. No more than a primitive list, Méliès’s scenario represents one of the earliest predecessors to the modern screenplay. The following is the complete text of Méliès’s original scenario for A Trip to the Moon. 1. The scientific congress at the Astronomic Club. 2. Planning the trip. Appointing the explorers and servants. Farewell. 3. The workshops. Constructing the projectile. 4. The foundries. The chimney-stacks. The casting of the monster gun. 5. The astronomers enter the shell. 6. Loading the gun. 7. The monster gun. March past the gunners. Fire!!! Saluting the flag. 8. The flight through space. Approaching the moon. 9. Landed right in the eye!!! 10. Flight of the shell into the moon. Appearance of the earth from the moon. 11. The plain of craters. Volcanic eruption. 12. The dream (the Solies, the Great Bear, Phoebus, the Twin Sisters, Saturna). 13. The snowstorm. 14. 40 degreees below zero. Descending a lunar crater. 15. Into the interior of the moon. The giant mushroom grotto. 16. Encounter with the Selenites. Homeric flight. 17. Prisoners!!! 18. The kingdom of the moon. The Selenite army. 19. The flight. 20. Wild pursuit. 21. The astronomers find the shell again. Departure from the moon. 22. Vertical drop into space. 23. Splashing into the open sea. 24. At the bottom of the ocean. 25. The rescue. Return to port. 26. The great fete. Triumphal march past. 27. Crowning and decorating the heroes of the trip. 28. Procession of Marines and the Fire Brigade. 29. Inauguration of the commemorative statue by the manager and the council. 30. Public rejoicings. (Jacobs 27–28)\n\nMéliès’s list is simply an enumeration of scenes, but as ﬁlmmakers, such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Grifﬁth, began to concentrate more 5\n\n8=6EI:G on individual shots, more narrative detail was added to each item. Scenes acquired headings, which marked location, and descriptive passages were placed beneath each heading, as seen in the following excerpt from Edwin S. Porter’s scenario for The Great Train Robbery (1903) as it appeared in the Edison Catalogue in 1904. Scene 1: Interior of railroad telegraph office. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to get the “signal block” to stop the approaching train, and make him write a fictitious order to the engineer to take water at this station, instead of “Red Lodge,” the regular watering stop. The train comes to a standstill (seen through window of office); the conductor comes to the window, and the frightened operator delivers the order while the bandits crouch out of sight, at the same time keeping him covered with their revolvers. As soon as the conductor leaves, they fall upon the operator, bind and gag him, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. Scene 2: Railroad water tower. The bandits are hiding behind the tank as the train, under the false order, stops to take water. Just before she pulls out they stealthily board the train between the express car and the tender. Scene 3: Interior of express car. Messenger is busily engaged. An unusual sound alarms him. He goes to the door, peeps through the keyhole and discovers two men trying to break in. He starts back bewildered, but, quickly recovering, he hastily locks the strong box containing the valuables and throws the key through the open side door. Drawing his revolver, he crouches behind a desk. In the meantime, the two robbers have succeeded in breaking in the door and enter cautiously. The messenger opens fire, and a desperate pistol duel takes place in which the messenger is killed. One of the robbers stands watch while the other tries to open the treasure box. Finding it locked, he vainly searches the messenger for the key, and blows the safe open with dynamite. Securing the valuables and mail bags they leave the car. (rpt. Jacobs 43–44)\n\n6\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay Technical details were added to the scene headings and descriptions, as needed, to identify interior and exterior scenes, close-ups, long shots, titles, and such. Eventually, most information about the proposed ﬁlm found its way into the scenario, and the scenario became a centralized guide to the proposed ﬁlm performance.\n\nScenario to Screenplay: The Silent Era A silent ﬁlm scenario consists of four main parts: a synopsis, a cast of characters, a scene plot, and the continuity (or the plot of the action). All four are still in use today in slightly different forms. The synopsis is comparable to a contemporary ﬁlm treatment; the cast of characters and the scene plot are similar to documents used to facilitate production; and the continuity is much like the contemporary screenplay. The Synopsis The synopsis is straight narrative, although greatly condensed from what we would ﬁnd in novels or short stories. As with contemporary treatments, synopses were used to pitch ﬁlm ideas to producers, but they also served as an overview of the story. It is common to ﬁnd one writer credited for the synopsis and another for the story, but the writer credited for the scenario usually wrote the synopsis, as is the case in the following synopsis for Metro Pictures’ Her Inspiration (1918), story and scenario by George D. Baker and Thomas J. Geraghty. “Her Inspiration” Synopsis Harold Montague, a young playwright, is told by the manager that his latest opus lacks proper atmosphere and as it is a moonshine story, Harold takes himself off to the Kentucky mountains, there to meet the originals of the counterparts of his play. He becomes acquainted with such denizens of the mountains as Curt Moots, Big Hank and Loony Lige—at last, but not by any manner of means least, with Kate Kendall—a wild mountain crew all of them—just the right people to contribute to Harold that atmosphere he needs to put his play over. Of course, the moonshiners regard him suspiciously, particularly Big Hank, who sees him making progress in a romance with Kate and doesn’t like it at all. Big Hank tries to interpret every move made by Harold as that of\n\n7\n\n8=6EI:G a revenue officer. The others, however, accept him for what he is. Loony Lige, a half-witted and self-constituted guardian of Kate, nurses a hatred for Big Hank that is augmented into a fury when he sees him trying to kiss the girl. He threatens to go for the revenue officers and give away the secrets of the illicit still. Soon after, twelve revenue officers arrive. Harold, not knowing who they are, directs them to the hiding place of the moonshines. Big Hank sees him and decides that he must hang. He is only prevented by the arrival of Looney Lige at the head of the band of officers. After this, Harold decides that he has atmosphere enough and that he must return to the city, because it would never do to marry an uncouth girl of the mountains, no matter how much he loves her. As he is watching the rehearsal of his play the manager requests that he meet the leading lady—Kate Kendall, who strange enough, was also seeking atmosphere. (Palmer and Howard 99–100)\n\nDespite its abbreviated nature, the synopsis adheres to principles of storytelling, employing dramatic techniques such as conﬂict, irony, and resolution, and is historically signiﬁcant and important as a source for the ﬁlm performance. But the ﬁlm synopsis is too limited by its focus on plot to be read as a fully realized literary piece. It subserves the ﬁlmed work and offers little of critical signiﬁcance when viewed as an autonomous work. A Cast of Characters The cast of characters in a scenario is seldom more than a list of the characters involved in the photoplay. Similar in function to a cast listing in a theatrical play (although sometimes the cast of characters would include a list of scenes in which each character appeared), the cast of characters fulﬁlled the same need as a cast list (and sometimes, call sheets) in use today. It provided an overview of the number of actors needed for a production. Although a cast of characters was commonly included in a scenario, it was eventually separated from the script and became a preproduction document. This change parallels the evolution of the screenplay and reﬂects the screenplay’s increased literary status. The more cohesive and complete the scenario became, the less it was marked as a preliminary document by its inclusion of other production-related documents. 8\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay A Scene Plot The scene plot, like the cast of characters, is another production-related document that was originally included in the script, but that is now separate. The scene plot is a list of interior and exterior locations that chronicles the scenes taking place at each location. Like all production documents, the scene plot aids in the scheduling of principle photography, making it possible to schedule together all scenes taking place in a particular location regardless of their position in the photoplay. “Witchcraft” SCENE PLOT Interiors STRUBLE’S OFFICE 1—20—61—102—104—107—108—109—110—111—129 NOKOMIS’ HUT 3—35—101—123—127—139—145—147—154 [. . . and so on] Exteriors and Locations SUZETTE’S COTTAGE 8—9—10—12—14—16—19—32—58—76—78 DOOR—SUZETTE’S COTTAGE 4—70—72—80—87—91—95 [. . . and so on] (Turnbull and Reed 197–98)\n\nAs with the cast of characters, the scene plot became a separate document as the screenplay became more uniﬁed and literary. The Continuity The continuity is where story elements are arranged in cinematic form. It is the section of the scenario that most parallels contemporary screenplay format, and it is where the script enters the realm of art.3 Frances Taylor Patterson, in her 1928 book on the scenario, claims that it is the continuity that “lifts the script out of the category of mere mechanical hack work” (Scenario 36). Patterson goes on to say,\n\n3. The term “script,” although interchangeable with the term “screenplay” in contemporary jargon and implicative of the continuity in the late 1920s, was originally synonymous with “scenario.”\n\n9\n\n8=6EI:G The continuity writer should really have a vivid imagination and an ingenious mind; in fact, it is not too exalted a notion of his calling to say he must be half poet and half musician. Continuity writing is not by any means merely a matter of reproducing other people’s ideas. It is a matter of improvising pictures which will render these ideas visible. It must make mental processes graphic. It must give tangibility to the abstract. . . . In the continuity writer, as in the director, there should be combined the artist, the dramatist, the actor, and the mechanic. (Scenario 36)\n\nThe continuity shapes the story, complete with characters, settings, and emotional context. It is the ﬁrst ﬁlm document to fully articulate what is to be performed and the earliest literary form of the screenplay.4 Various forms were used for the continuity in the early days of ﬁlm as ﬁlmmakers wrestled with the young industry. The hand-drawn continuities used by the Douglas Fairbanks Company, for example, served as production schedules, listing the settings and the days the sets would be needed on the left of the page and the characters and the action they would perform on the right (ﬁg. 1).\n\nSET\n\nSTREET OUTSIDE DeYAYO GARDEN\n\n{\n\nACTION 1st DAY CAESER CLIMBS WALL & FAREWELLS GIRL CAESER FALLS AMONG SOLDIERS\n\nSTREET DAY\n\n1st NIGHT CAESER ARRIVES IN VICTORIA & CLIMBS TO WALL CAESER DESCENDS FROM WALL\n\nFig. 1. Example of one bracketed segment from the continuity for the Douglas Fairbanks Company’s 1925 production of Don Q Son of Zorro (Rpt. Patterson Scenario 52).\n\n4. Whether or not a screenplay is ultimately produced (read: performed) is a matter of consequence, not necessity.\n\n10\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay Eventually, it became necessary to standardize the form of the continuity in order to assure consistency. As ﬁlm grew away from its primitive beginning, during which time cameramen, directors, actors, and even “ofﬁce staff ” (Hampton 30) would extemporaneously compose the content of ﬁlm, power shifted to the screenwriter. Studios developed scenario departments to craft stories prior to ﬁlming. The continuities in these early works left quite a bit of interpretive and creative power in the hands of the production team. As a result, “critics at the time complained a lot about sloppy continuity” (Geuens 82). Objects would unintentionally disappear and reappear from scene to scene. Wardrobe and sets would change. People would jump positions on the screen. To solve this problem, writers and studios reﬁned screenplay format to accommodate the increased function a screenplay was expected to perform. As a result, more power shifted to the screenplay and more creative control ﬂowed to the screenwriter. By the end of the silent era, the form of the continuity had become highly literary. Ole Storm, in his introduction to the 1970 publication of Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Four Screenplays, says of Dreyer’s scripts: Comprehensively, the scripts reﬂect the integral nature of Carl Dreyer’s vision. He commits to paper not only pictorial effects, but even the most transient moods and impalpable atmospheres. All those elements which coalesce into an artistic whole only on the shootingﬂoor and in the cutting-room, he ﬁnds it natural to epitomize in the novelistic form that best enables him to abide by his primary intentions: the development of the plot, the atmosphere, and the feelings that each shot is intended to evoke in the spectator. Of the practical details of procedure the scripts say next to nothing. (Storm 10)\n\nBy the mid-1920s the screenplay had risen from the simplicity of practical necessity to a literary form in its own right. Note the literary quality of the following excerpt from Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc. At to of of\n\nthe Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris it is possible see one of the most famous documents in the history the world—the official record of the trial of Joan Arc.\n\nThe Bibliothèque Nationale’s original record of the\n\n11\n\n8=6EI:G trial of Joan of Arc is shown on the screen. An invisible hand turns over the manuscript pages. If you turn over the pages, yellow with age, which contain the account of her martyrdom . . . Page after page is shown of this unique document with its lines as straight as arrows, its marginal annotations, and the naïve miniature drawings for which the notaries have found time and space. . . . you will find Joan herself . . . not the military genius who inflicted on the enemy defeat after defeat, but a simple and natural young girl . . . who died for her country. The last pages are turned. Then the picture disappears and gives way to the first scene of the film, which shows 1 The prison, where Joan is sitting, praying. The flagstones, the floor in Joan’s cell. We see two straws and a hand, Joan’s hand, which lays the straws on the floor in the form of a cross. 2 Scenes from the church are shown: the chalice is brought out. 3 In the prison we see Joan kneeling before her straw cross—this most fragile and exalted of crosses. She prays in ecstatic joy, at one moment bending right forward so that her forehead touches the flagstones, the next moment kneeling with her hands folded and her eyes raised to heaven as if she saw beings visible only to her. From time to time she mutters a short prayer. 4 THE CHURCH A young monk makes his way through rows of kneeling priests. He is the Usher Massieu, who is on his way to summon Joan and conduct her to her first examination. 5 THE PRISON Joan in front of her little cross. Suddenly the two straws spin round in a mysterious gust of wind. What is it? Joan sits for a moment, overcome with astonishment, then puts the straws back in the form of a cross. Again a hostile power attacks this cross and scatters it over the flagstones. Joan doesn’t know what to believe. Can\n\n12\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay it be one of her voices? A divine intervention? Once again she replaces the cross. Then there is a roar of laughter from the door behind her. Joan turns and sees three soldiers, who have been standing in the half-open door, blowing at her straw cross through a long tube. Enter the soldiers. They are tormentors and bullies of the worst kind. They continue to jeer at her. 6 Now the jailer appears, an elderly man, followed by a blacksmith. Joan turns in terror and looks up at them. When she sees the chains in the blacksmith’s hands, her eyes fill with tears, and she shrinks back a step. The jailer seizes her by the foot, and the blacksmith puts the ankle-chains on her. 7 While he is thus occupied, Massieu enters. He is an engaging young man of twenty-five, healthy, vivacious and open; he radiates youth, health and life. He remains standing by the door until the others have left the cell. The jailer, who goes out last, certifies that the prisoner is the Maid. The door closes behind the jailer. And now that Massieu is alone with this woman, whom he has heard described as a dangerous witch and an object of fear-he is afraid. He prays inaudibly and crosses himself. He has brought with him a small stoup and aspergillum, and as he stands by the door he sprinkles Joan eagerly with holy water. Joan, who has dragged herself over to the boards which serve as her bed, looks at him in gay surprise, and with a slight smile says: Come a little nearer, I shan’t fly away! Massieu, astonished, approaches her, asks if she is Joan, the Maid, and when she confirms this begins to read the summons: . . . that you summon the aforesaid Joan, commonly called the Maid, to appear before us . . . Joan declares herself ready to follow him. Massieu calls for the jailer. They lead Joan out. 8 THE CHAPEL Bishop Cauchon takes the chair for the trial. To either side of him sit the Inquisitor, Lemaître, and Jean d’Estivet, who is to present the case against Joan. These three men are surrounded by the other forty-one clerics, all men of learning, thoroughly versed in the art of dragging confessions out of accused persons. A special table is reserved for the notaries. Cauchon gives orders for the accused to be brought in.\n\n13\n\n8=6EI:G 9 Every face turns towards the entrance. They all see Joan for the first time. It is so quiet in the chapel that you can hear the grating noise of the chains round Joan’s ankles. 10 Joan comes forward. Through the pointed, colored windows the sunlight falls obliquely into the room in long shafts. Suddenly Joan finds herself in the middle of one of these shafts and stops for a moment. She becomes aware that every eye is turned towards her; she sees that they are hard, cold and uncomprehending. For a few seconds it seems as if she is going to collapse, overcome by the cold, remorseless atmosphere. On one side a completely human, simple, young country girl; on the other the flower of this century’s talents, learned doctors, the fine fruits of the university, every prodigy in Christendom . . . the instruments of reason—and of death. The personification on one side of innocence, on the other of magnificence. The terrible, relentless way in which they look at this girl in man’s clothes, all these bishops, all these ascetics and members of orders with their newly cropped tonsures! These learned gentlemen regard her man’s shoes and short hair as something loathsome and indecent. They believe as one man that it will be all easy matter to get the upper hand over this child. (Dreyer 27–30)\n\nStorm notes that Dreyer’s “original scripts are annotated on the blank left-hand pages with manuscript jottings about properties, lighting, sound effects, panning shots, plot and similar practical manners” (10). This bifurcation of content implies distinctions between the literary and the practical, exposing the presence of literary content in a form that was born of practical necessity. What had begun for Méliès as a mnemonic device had grown into a literary form. Dreyer recognized the importance of the script, realized the signiﬁcant creative contribution the script represented, and so advocated that directors write their own continuities. As is clear in the opening from Dreyer’s script for The Passion of Joan of Arc, the engendering of the cinematic is already present within the text. When Joan sits in prison watching bits of straw disrupted by the wind, Dreyer fulﬁlls Patterson’s mandate and renders ideas visible. The scene is complete with emotional content for the reader. We do not need the camera to realize the visual. In fact, the ﬁrst seven scenes of Dreyer’s script were cut just prior to shooting, so these 14\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay scenes exist only as literature and would be lost if the literary value of Dreyer’s writing were discarded in presumed appreciation of his art as a director. With the introduction of sound (thus spoken dialogue) at the end of the 1920s, screenplay format stabilized, but dialogue was present in the continuity prior to sound, in the form of titles. Titles, which were indented in the scenario, shifted away from mere descriptions of actions or explanatory textual inserts and “became substitutes for the missing voices of the players, telling us in effect what the characters were saying to each other” (Geuens 84). They presented dialogue that was not yet technically possible, but was nonetheless presumed to be necessary. Note the dominance of dialogue in the following excerpt from Alfred A. Cohn’s scenario for The Jazz Singer. 270. CLOSE-UP LEE AND DILLINGS Dillings has finished saying something to him as Lee’s jaw drops. He looks at him in surprise and blurts out: TITLE 108:\n\n“You don’t mean you’d take your money out of the show the last minute?”\n\nBack to scene. Dillings nods firmly. Lee demands to know the reason for this sudden determination. Dillings points in the direction of Mary’s room and then to Jack. He says: TITLE 109:\n\n“Just the idea of Mary’s interest in this jazz singer of yours.”\n\nBack to scene. Lee starts to argue with Dillings, telling him that it is nothing serious. Dillings, however, has guessed the true state of affairs. He adds: TITLE 110:\n\n“I have no further interest in her career. Just mail me a check today.”\n\nHe starts to leave.\n\n(Cohn and Raphaelson 107)\n\nThe form of the continuity was obliged to accommodate dialogue, a logical result of the increasing narrative demands placed on ﬁlm in the ﬁrst three decades of the twentieth century. Wordless ﬁlms may 15\n\n8=6EI:G have been the ideal for Sergei Eisenstein and others, including Patterson (who lectured on ﬁlm at Columbia University in the 1920s), who claimed, “The motion picture should be a story told without words” (Cinema 102). But even Patterson admitted in 1920 that the form had not yet achieved that objective, as it was “almost impossible to construct a photoplay without calling in the assistance of words” (102), but envisioned wordless ﬁlms as the ultimate realization of the art form. But ﬁlm did not evolve as Patterson imagined it would. Instead of shaking its dependence on words, ﬁlm embraced them. As it turned out, ﬁlm’s evolution was more than the advancement of the visual image; it was also the incorporation of sound (nonvisual language) and thus the photoplay did not evolve into a story told through a series of juxtaposed moving images; it evolved into a story told through visual and auditory modes. Film, which was often touted as a medium under the exclusive providence of the eye, ultimately fell under the providence of the eye and the ear. Aesthetic philosophies touting the visual purity of the art suffered beneath the weight of popular opinion. Once sound became possible, it quickly became inevitable, and dialogue moved from the title cards to the soundtrack. According to Geuens, Ince’s system had “located the essence of the movies inside the screenplays” and divided ﬁlm into “two distinct movements, two discrete labors, the writing and the execution” (85). Cinema was “essentially . . . dominated by the story” and “the visualization process remained entirely subservient to the drama described by the script” (85). Although some (Geuens included) complained that Ince’s system, in disempowering the director, resulted in dull, commercial productions, which were rescued midcentury from banality by the artistic brilliance of New Wave directors (e.g., François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, Claude Chabrol), these arguments are more attempts at privilege than assessments of aesthetic content, as they overlook the work of directors such as Preston Sturges, John Ford, Ernst Lubitsch, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles, and many others. The battle to attribute authorship waged by the Cahiers du Cinéma critics presumes an exclusivity that does not in fact exist.5 To credit a director is not to discredit a screenwriter; and to credit 5. This debate is discussed in more detail in Harvard Film Studies’ Cahiers du Cinéma: 1960–1968, edited by Jim Hillier.\n\n16\n\nThe Evolution of the Screenplay a screenwriter is not to dismiss the vision of a director, anymore than praising a stage production of Macbeth diminishes Shakespeare’s literary art. Despite paradoxical attacks on the artistic value of scripts, the screenplay in the 1930s assumed the basic form it has maintained (with only minor changes) throughout the remainder of the twentieth and into the twenty-ﬁrst century.\n\nThe Screenplay after Sound Screenplays after sound are similar in form to theatrical plays. Dialogue is pervasive, although often more terse than theatrical dialogue. Narrative sections between passages of dialogue describe movement and setting much in the way stage directions do for theatrical plays. The entire screenplay is divided into scenes, which can often be subdivided into shots or visual sequences. The language throughout is concise and connotative. All of these elements are evident in the following excerpt from Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allen Woolf ’s 1939 screenplay for The Wizard of Oz. FADE IN—Title: For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy out of fashion.

Speciﬁc camera shots were prevalent in early screenplays. Over time writers began to imply particular shots rather than explicitly state them. By the 1970s it was common practice to leave out speciﬁc references to the camera (although screenplays written by directors often include them). By the end of the twentieth century, scene transitions (e.g., DISSOLVE TO:, CUT TO:) began to disappear, but the staccato narrative style, the visual focus, and the unadorned dialogue have remained. I contend that over time fewer technical terms were needed because the screenplay became increasingly more literary and more able to shape visual imagery for readers.\n\n17\n\n8=6EI:G him—then runs down road to b.g.—Toto following— DOROTHY She isn’t coming yet, Toto.

(Langley et al. 1)\n\nMore contemporary examples, such as Jim Uhls’s highly stylized 1999 screenplay for Fight Club, resemble the form of Langley and collaborators’ 1939 screenplay for The Wizard of Oz.

(Uhls 2–3)\n\nSince the introduction of sound, the American screenplay’s form has remained relatively constant. Its function, at a superﬁcial level, has also remained the same: to inform its own performance and guide the execution of a motion picture. Film has undergone more changes to its form since the introduction of sound than the screenplay, new technologies and cinematic innovations being responsible for the majority of the changes. While the Steadicam, computer-generated imagery (CGI), improved audio recording and tracking, 24P video, increased camera mobility, and other innovations have greatly altered the visual/auditory experience of ﬁlm, the screenplay has experienced only a few changes to its form. Among these are fewer direct camera references, less cinema-graphic marginalia, and more concise scene descriptions. For example, note the prevalence of camera directions in the opening of Peter Stone’s 1 October 1962 draft for Charade (1963). FADE IN (BEFORE TITLES) 1. EXT.

(Stone n.p.)\n\nReference to the camera is common throughout Stone’s screenplay, yet when we compare Stone’s writing in 1962 to the opening of Robert Towne’s third draft (9 October 1973) for Chinatown, written only eleven years later, we ﬁnd that pervasive references to the camera have begun to disappear. 1\n\nFULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love.

He starts to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos of several movie stars askew.

When you’re right, you’re right, and you’re right. (Towne n.p.)\n\n23\n\n8=6EI:G The camera, which is explicitly referenced in Stone’s writing, is adequately implied in Towne’s. We may attribute many of the structural changes, such as this, that we ﬁnd in screenplays during the last thirty years to the screenplay’s shaking off of the inﬂuences of staged theater that shaped the early days of ﬁlm, and the establishment of the screenplay as a more autonomous literary form. Screenwriting, as it turned out, could sufﬁciently convey directions to ﬁlmmakers that were previously—and wrongly—considered necessary. The result was the more reﬁned style we ﬁnd in contemporary screenplays.\n\n24\n\nParallel Forms The Architecture of Performance\n\nI appeal to all film critics . . . to remember that a film begins with a screenplay. —Ernest Lehman\n\nWhen Ernest Lehman accepted an honorary Oscar in 2001 for his impressive body of work as a screenwriter, producer, and director, he stressed the importance of the screenplay to ﬁlm, restating what directors, producers, actors, writers, and other professionals have been saying for the last century—that the screenplay is of central importance in the ﬁlm industry. What is surprising about Lehman’s comment is that it still needed to be said. In 1935 screenwriter Dudley Nichols, who won a Best Writer award for his screenplay The Informer, became the ﬁrst person to boycott the Academy Awards in his efforts to draw more attention to screenwriters.1 Throughout the history of the American screenplay, screenwriters have been ﬁghting for recognition as the screenplay’s merits have been undervalued. One difﬁculty lies in the fact that screenplays are written for ﬁlmmakers and have no other intended audience; therefore, they adhere to a rigid form that presumes its own performance, and their audience is substantially smaller than a ﬁlm’s audience. Millions of people have seen Sidney Lumet’s Network (1976), but only a few hundred students\n\n1. Nichols’s primary objective in boycotting the event was to garner support for the Writers Guild.\n\n25\n\n8=6EI:G of ﬁlm and ﬁlm industry professionals (actors, directors, cinematographers, set designers, and so on; and professionals involved in the business of ﬁlmmaking: agents, entertainment lawyers, managers, accountants, etc.) have read Paddy Chayefsky’s screenplay. The primary function of a screenplay is to facilitate production of the ﬁlm in the same way that a stage play’s primary function is to facilitate the stage production.2 The only people who read a screenplay are those who have an interest in its production and those who intentionally track down a copy. The latter group has grown in the last three decades to include a large number of would-be screenwriters, students of the screenplay, professors teaching screenwriting courses for ﬁlm, communication and English departments, and entrepreneurs marketing screenwriting courses and related services. Kristen Thompson credits this increase to the “rise in package production since the 1970s” and a resurgence of “freelance scriptwriting” that resulted in a “ﬂood of manuals . . . cater[ing] to aspiring authors” (11). Interest in screenwriting among the general population continued to blossom through the 1980s. In 1990 screenwriter Shane Black sold his spec script called The Last Boy Scout for $1.75 million, an unprecedented amount for an unsolicited screenplay bought on speculation and a substantially larger amount than studios paid in the early days of ﬁlm when studios such as Edison, Vitagraph, Imperial, and Biograph paid screenwriters $20 per reel for their work. Black’s sale drew national attention and set off another ﬂurry of interest among nonprofessionals wanting to become screenwriters. This broad-based interest in screenwriting stimulated a thriving screenwriting culture. Syd Field, one of the ﬁrst to write a popular book on the craft of screenwriting (Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting, 1982), became a central ﬁgure in the emergent ﬁeld of screenplay training materials. Numerous books appeared, such as Robert McKee’s Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting (1997), David Trottier’s The Screenwriter’s Bible (originally published in 1994, published as a general trade book in 1995, and revised in 2005), Linda Seger’s Making a Good Script Great\n\n2. To a lesser degree, the screenplay can, and often does, function as a sales piece used to acquire funding for a project or to attract important talent to a project, thus improving its chances of being produced.\n\n26\n\nThe Architecture of Performance (1994), and myriad others. Periodicals dealing with screenwriting and the screenplay appeared, among them Creative Screenwriting, Script, Screentalk, Screenwriter’s Monthly, and Written By. In 2001 Matt Damon and Ben Afﬂeck participated in the formation of Project Greenlight, a Web site that offered unknown screenwriters entry into a contest that could result in the production of their screenplays. Thousands of amateur writers entered screenplays into Project Greenlight’s screenwriting contests.3 Despite a booming script culture, the screenplay and the screenwriter remain undervalued, a point Washington Post ﬁlm critic Desson Thomson stressed in a 2004 live online discussion: “How on earth would Anthony Hopkins be effective in Silence of the Lambs without words in his mouth? Without the situation set up which makes him the only person who can help Clarice Starling? Hollywood has always had a hate-hate relationship with the writer. Bafﬂing. People like Joe Eszterhas and Shane Black broke the impasse, luckily, with million dollar-plus salaries for their scripts. But let’s face it, compared to the lowest star in Hollywood it’s still nothing” (n.p.). The screenplay has received far less attention in scholarly circles than in popular culture. Some mention of the screenplay occasionally makes its way into ﬁlm scholarship, but this inclusion is frequently sparse and overpowered by examinations of the ﬁlm or a preceding work, such as a novel or a play that the screenplay has adapted for ﬁlm. For example, Rick Worland’s 2002 examination of Hitchcock’s Suspicion considers the screenplay,4 but focuses primarily on Anthony Berkeley’s novel, Before the Fact, on which the screenplay is based, and Hitchcock’s ﬁlm, with the screenplay functioning as a link between the two, rather than a creative work of equivalent value. Worland is not to be faulted for this, as his primary objective in the article is to redress the critical reception of the ﬁlm; however, it is a measure of\n\n3. Project Greenlight’s ﬁrst contest received 7,000 entries and resulted in the ﬁlm Stolen Summer (2002), which was written and directed by Pete Jones. Its second contest produced The Battle for Shaker Heights (2003), written by Erica Beeney and codirected by Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin. The third contest paired the screenplay Feast (2005), cowritten by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, with ﬁrst-time director John Gulager. 4. Cf. Rick Worland, “Before and after the Fact: Writing and Reading Hitchcock’s Suspicion,” Cinema Journal 41 (Summer 2002).\n\n27\n\n8=6EI:G the limited coverage screenplays receive on those rare occasions when they are addressed at all. It would be fallacious to argue that the screenplay as a literary form has been wholly ignored. On occasion, the screenplay has been recognized in scholarly and popular discourses. One of the earliest acknowledgments of the screenplay as a viable literary form was Otto Rank’s use of The Student of Prague (1913) as the narrative source for his book on the double in literature (Der Doppelgänger [The Double]). Rank’s argument privileges Hanns Heinz Ewers’s screenplay over the Edgar Allan Poe story (“William Wilson”) that inspired the screenplay and the ﬁlm that resulted from the screenplay. Rank claims that in The Student of Prague “we can . . . trace back the developmental and semantic history of an old, traditional folk-concept which has stimulated imaginative and thoughtful writers to use it in their works” (3). He further argues that “those whose concern is with literature may be reassured by the fact that the scenarist of this ﬁlm, The Student of Prague, is an author currently in vogue and that he has adhered to prominent patterns, the effectiveness of which has been tested by time” (3–4). Rank’s comments are signiﬁcant for two reasons. First, Rank, in a work speciﬁcally focused on literature, identiﬁes Ewers, the scenarist, as the author of the work—not Poe, whose story preceded Ewers’s work, or Stellan Rye and Paul Wegener who directed the ﬁlm. Second, Rank wrote The Double in 1914 (though the work was ﬁrst published in 1925), one year after Ewers wrote The Student of Prague. More recent acknowledgments of the importance of screenplays also exist. The January 2005 issue of Vanity Fair includes a twelve-page excerpt from John Logan’s screenplay for The Aviator. The introduction to the piece states: “In Vanity Fair’s continuing endeavor to celebrate the craft of superb screenwriting, we offer an extended excerpt from Logan’s The Aviator, a spirited, sumptuous, and psychologically astute portrait of one of the titanic characters in the annals of 20th-century wealth and power” (Logan 3). One reason for the scant critical attention to the screenplay as a literary form involves how we deﬁne “ﬁlm” as it is used in terms such as “ﬁlm studies,” and in how critics and scholars have presumed the term required little or no deﬁnition. Most criticism up until the 1970s focused on the ﬁlm tableau—the projected rectangle with its accouterments: sound and story. Since the 1970s, an increased interest in ﬁlm’s relation28\n\nThe Architecture of Performance ship to the representation and construction of culture, gender, ethnicity, and social class stretched the boundaries of the discipline but retained the object of its original focus. We should not be surprised that ﬁlm studies focuses primarily on the screen text instead of the screenplay text; however, when we consider the extent to which that ﬁlm text has been expanded to include the spectator, as in Jean-Luis Baudry’s work in the 1970s on the ideological effect of the cinematic apparatus, and the application of Jacques Lacan to ﬁlm studies in the works of Laura Mulvey, Christian Metz, and Slavoj Žižek, we realize that critical ﬁlm studies have extended the discussion of ﬁlm proper beyond the borders of the reel into its broader cultural context. Why then has the screenplay failed to become an integral part of the mix? One likely explanation is a privileging of performance over text. In a similar manner to the way speech was long privileged over writing (until Jacques Derrida in Of Grammatology demonstrated that such privilege was untenable), the articulation of the screenplay is privileged over the written document. At the core of this problem is the metaphysical notion of presence. The ﬁlm proper—the light and sound show experience—creates an illusion of presence that the screenplay does not. Jean-Louis Baudry, in “Ideological Effects of the Basic Cinematographic Apparatus,” for example, points out that “the image is not reducible to language” (40). However, signifying production is no less present in written text. Just as image is text, text is image. Text is more symbolic than ﬁlm, but no less capable of signiﬁcation and no less dependent on a viewer for meaning. What varies between the two is the level of subjectivity. Film is one imaginary remove from the screenplay. Ingmar Bergman begins The Seventh Seal: The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep.\n\nThis text, when interpreted, is mutated into imaginary representations; a reader must imagine a dawn preceded by a hot night, how a “hot gust of wind” looks when it “blows across a colorless sea.” Even more necessary to the narrative, a reader must imagine the prostrate knight. 29\n\n8=6EI:G However, these textual details, once ﬁlmed, shift the locus of subjective creation from the reader to the ﬁlmmakers (and not to the ﬁlm audience). The opening shots of the ﬁlm remove the necessity for an audience to imagine these particular details (though, as Baudry, among others, points out, the audience is still engaged in the imaginary by the ﬁlm apparatus). The knight looks like Max von Sydow and cannot be imagined any other way because von Sydow was cast in the role. The ocean is the ocean Bergman chose to shoot, not the ocean that a reader would have necessarily imagined from the text. Thus, the imaginary is rendered more rigid and less subjective by the translation of text to ﬁlm. This increased rigidity engenders the illusion of presence that to some degree accounts for ﬁlm’s predominance over text. Interestingly, this relationship is often inverted for drama. Scholars generally approach Shakespeare’s plays as written documents, not performances. That is, the written play is privileged over its performance. The issue of privilege we may attribute to the notion of permanence. The most seemingly permanent manifestation of a work is often the one that is privileged. A dramatic staging of a play is transient and mutable, while the written text, though subject to interpretation, is unchanging. In ﬁlm, however, the performance of the screenplay—the ﬁlm proper—is permanent (relatively), and the screenplay, which often involves numerous drafts and revisions, is seemingly impermanent, in that it is difﬁcult to arrive at an authoritative version. The ﬁlm proper usually offers a single, consistent ﬁlm text (excepting remakes). But just as theater includes more than a staged production, ﬁlm encompasses more than a cinematic performance. Film as a medium involves many elements, including lighting, set design, blocking, sound effects, storyboards, costume design, marketing, and writing. Of all of these, which contribute in varying degrees to the ﬁlm performance, the screenplay contributes the most, as Alan A. Armer points out when he claims that “a well-written screenplay is the single most important ingredient in the making of a successful motion picture” (xvi). Even the screenplays of literary luminaries such as William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Vladimir Nabokov are ranked somewhere below their personal correspondence, and are often mentioned only out of historical curiosity. Those who wrote almost exclusively for ﬁlm found their works marginalized almost as soon as the corresponding ﬁlms were complete. While some writers, such as Preston Sturges 30\n\nThe Architecture of Performance and Paddy Chayefsky, have received attention, many writers, such as Frances Marion (whom Mary Pickford called “the pillar of my career” [Beauchamp 9]), Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur, Jules Furthman, Sidney Joseph Perelman, Nedrick Young, Wendell Mayes (among many others) and their works have yet to receive the scholarly attention their literary accomplishments warrant, despite their contributions to the history, art, and evolution of ﬁlm. As William Froug aptly puts it: “The screenwriter is beaten, battered, and belittled by ﬁlm esthetes, critics, scholars, and historians whose unshakeable adherence to the auteur theory goes against all logic and veriﬁable fact, particularly when applied to the American motion picture” (vii). The denigration of the screenplay and the devaluation of the screenwriter persist today more out of habit than any critical judgment. Froug is right to point out the damaging effects of auteur theory. By supplanting the author of the screenplay with the ﬁlm director, auteur theory has contributed (albeit unintentionally) more to the continued dismissal of the screenplay’s merit than any other factor. The irony is unmistakable. In employing the literary term “author,” advocates of auteur theory inadvertently privilege the literary while paradoxically diminishing the contributions of the literary to the ﬁlm text. As Donald E. Staples points out in his 1966 reexamination of François Truffaut’s article, “Une certaine tendance du cinéma français,” the foundational article was not intended to establish a “framework of criticism” (Staples 1), although auteur theory in many circles has become just that. Truffaut’s article was “more of an anti-screen-writers article” (2). Truffaut objected to the stranglehold that psychological realism exercised over the work of French screenwriters. Truffaut viewed these works as too literary and argued that they enclosed “beings in a closed world, barricaded by formulas, plays on words, [and] maxims instead of letting us see them for ourselves with our own eyes” (Truffaut 24). But it was not writing, per se, to which Truffaut raised objection, it was the particular writing of French screenwriters of the time. His privileging of directors, such as Jean Renoir, Jean Cocteau, Abel Gance, Robert Bresson, Max Ophüls, Roger Leenhardt, and Jacques Tati, acknowledges that “these are auteurs who often write their dialogue and some of them invent themselves the stories that they direct” (26). Thus, auteur theory as outlined by Truffaut and André Bazin’s “De la politique des auteurs” does not, de facto, dismiss screenwriting or 31\n\n8=6EI:G the signiﬁcance of the writing of the screenplay; although, as Graham Petrie notes, the Cahiers double issue of December 1963–January 1964 classiﬁes directors “with not a scriptwriter . . . being deemed worthy of mention” (61). Robert Self points out that “the success of auteur theory, which presupposes a unity of meaning and of authorial style and theme, is everywhere apparent—in the public media, in the university classroom, in academic publishing, in ﬁlm festival retrospectives, in professional ﬁlm conferences” (“Theory of Authorship” 3). The theory’s proliferation (in all various forms) has diminished both screenwriter and screenplay. Despite critical attempts to lesson the import of auteur theory, its inﬂuence continues to dominate the general aesthetics of ﬁlm culture. Michael Patrick Allen and Anne E. Lincoln’s recent study of 1,277 revered ﬁlms concludes that “the retrospective consecration of ﬁlms is affected by the discourse produced by ﬁlm critics and scholars who function, in effect, as reputational entrepreneurs. However, this discourse is inﬂuence by the availability of certain cultural schemas. Speciﬁcally, the ascendancy of ‘auteur theory’ as a discourse of value within ﬁlm studies serves to privilege the director as the primary creative agent in ﬁlm production. It also serves to privilege certain directors over others” (871). Despite these aftereffects, we must acknowledge that Truffaut’s work on auteur theory was printed ﬁfty-nine years after the Lumière brothers debuted their ﬁrst ﬁlms to a paying audience in Paris, and that criticizing auteur theory does nothing to explain the screenplay’s nearly sixty years of diminished status prior to the theory’s critical arrival. A number of dynamically interactive factors have helped to marginalize the screenplay among ﬁlm scholars. First among these is the nature of early ﬁlm. During its emergent days at the end of the nineteenth century, ﬁlm did not adhere to the oft-chimed saw about being a story told with pictures. The early ﬁlms of Thomas Edison and Lumière were not stories at all, but moving pictures—literally, pictures that moved. This was not only their function but also the way they were perceived. The process of capturing still images with wet-plate photography had led to Eadweard Muybridge’s serial photographs, which in turn led to William Dickson and Edison’s Kinetograph. The Kinetograph was an extension of photography, a device designed to make pictures move. It was not originally conceived of or employed as a medium for storytelling, which joined ﬁlm later. Prior to the inclu32\n\nThe Architecture of Performance sion of stories, no writing was needed. The handful of cameramen who produced the earliest ﬁlms lugged their cameras around cities and across the countryside with the single aim to get the shot, whatever that might be: Madison Avenue, New York Harbor, people dancing, and so on, anything that might amuse audiences. The early work of American cameramen, such as Edwin S. Porter with Edison Studios, J. Stuart Blackton with Vitagraph, and Billy Bitzer with Biograph, was about the image of motion and paralleled still photography more than theater. All they needed for their one-shot productions were interesting visuals. It was only a matter of months before Lumière’s L’arroseur arrose (1895) demonstrated the effect story could have on an audience, but those few months were enough to establish the primacy of ﬁlm. The issue of the screenplay was further complicated by the genre’s slow birth.5 The connection between ﬁlm and writing evolved slowly, out of necessity. Written predecessors to the screenplay drew scant attention because they were little more than notes, often merely a list of scenes jotted down to remind a ﬁlmmaker of what needed to be shot. However, when ﬁlms grew in length and became more complex, writing gained in importance: existing ﬁrst as a simple mnemonic device, then as a preproduction list of the ﬁlm’s imagined structure, and ﬁnally as the guiding force in the ﬁlm’s execution. The screenplay (or script) became the accumulation site of much of the information surrounding the production of a ﬁlm, including technical details—lighting, wardrobe, and so on—all of which made it difﬁcult to see the screenplay as an artistic form. Part of the cold reception the screenplay has received from critical circles over the past century is a result of the ancillary nature of writing’s early role in ﬁlm production. Early ﬁlm commentary focuses primarily on establishing ﬁlm’s autonomy, particularly distinguishing it from vaudeville and the theatrical stage. Hugo Münsterberg’s claim that ﬁlm is incomparable to drama because the “view of dramatic events” it gives us is “completely shaped by the mind” (401) and similar claims by others, such as Béla Balázs who argues in Theory of the Film\n\n5. I use the term “genre” here, and throughout, out of convenience, as a placeholder for an ignored segment of literature, and do not intend to imply that the boundaries traditionally presumed between works are unproblematical.\n\n33\n\n8=6EI:G that ﬁlm differs from theater in the way it manipulates an audience’s point of view, represent attempts to deﬁne ﬁlm by articulating how it differs from other artistic mediums (passim). This agenda is obvious in V. I. Pudovkin’s later claim that the “path to a real art will be found only when it has been freed from the dictates of an art-form foreign to it— that is, the Theatre” (27). This goal in early ﬁlm criticism served practical ends. The medium was new and needed to establish itself ﬁrst as a creative enterprise and then as an art form on a par with theater and the novel. It may very well be that the later tendency to aggressively deny the screenplay’s literary merit is linked to attempts at establishing the artistic legitimacy of ﬁlm. Film was for many critics, as Vachel Lindsay claimed, “the new universal alphabet” (203), and much effort was invested in characterizing its grammar and syntax. Lev Kuleshov, for example, compared it to poetry: “A poet places one word after another, in a deﬁnite rhythm, as one brick after another. Cemented by him, the word-images produce a complex conception as a result. So it is that shots, like conventionalized meanings, like the ideograms in Chinese writings, produce images and concepts” (91). These attempts to posit ﬁlm as visual literature were largely successful and led to claims, such as André Bazin’s, that “the director writes in ﬁlm” (39), and also led to the establishment of auteur theory and the dominance of semiotics in ﬁlm studies. Auteur theory did much to elevate the stature of ﬁlm by promoting the perception of ﬁlm as text and the director as author, but further supplanted the literary signiﬁcance of the screenplay. The problem is largely semantic. If the ﬁlm proper is deﬁned as the text of the ﬁlm, how are we to deﬁne the screenplay? No one would deny that a screenplay is text, but when the same term is applied to the stream of images in a ﬁlm, “text” connotes an irreconcilable ambiguity. Instead of addressing this issue, scholarship appears to have sidestepped it by ignoring the screenplay altogether, enabling theorists to apply linguistic terms to images without equivocating. Stuart M. Kaminsky, in his 1974 study of ﬁlm genres, admits that “authorship studies are of great value in understanding ﬁlm,” but claims that “it may be of even more importance at the present state of ﬁlm study to encourage additional descriptive generic studies” (10). Kaminsky’s point is valid, but he fails in his call for a broader understanding of ﬁlm to mention the possibility that the screenplay might be worthy of examination. Peter Brunette and David Wills, in their well-conceived 1989 34\n\nThe Architecture of Performance work on Derrida and ﬁlm theory, ironically titled Screen/Play, discuss at length the applicability of Derrida’s theories about writing to studies of ﬁlm, extending the boundaries of previous studies. They articulate clear distinctions between speech and writing, as Derrida does, yet eschew mention of the screenplay—the written text of nearly every ﬁlm since the start of the twentieth century. This is particularly disappointing since much of their discussion could have added a great deal to our understanding of the screenplay and its function in ﬁlm. Derrida’s concept of invagination,6 for example, which Brunette and Wills use to illuminate genre, could have been used to denote the interaction between the screenplay and the ﬁlm proper—to show how the screenplay is both external and internal to the ﬁlm. Some scholars might argue that the screenplay falls outside the parameters of their particular study. This would be an adequate defense if not for the dearth of scholarship on the screenplay in ﬁlm studies and the fact that less signiﬁcant factors, such as on-set antics and the private lives of actors, have received more critical attention than screenplays and screenwriters. Despite observations, such as Andrew Sarris’s, that “writing and directing are fundamentally the same function” (Corliss xv), auteur advocacy (even Sarris’s) continues to valorize the director at the expense of the screenwriter (even if the director also wrote the screenplay). The essential core of ﬁlm is the image in motion; thus the image is the essential core of ﬁlm studies (though not its limit)—but ﬁlms, although they can, rarely do exist without other factors. Even during the silent era, ﬁlms were often accompanied by music, and dialogue was supplied by title cards. Purely visual storytelling in ﬁlm was rare even in ﬁlms such as Buster Keaton’s Sherlock, Jr. (1924). Keaton’s masterpiece is mainly visual storytelling; however, note the following title card from the ﬁlm: By the next day the master mind had completely solved the\n\n6. Brunette and Wills offer the following summation of Derrida’s term: “Brieﬂy, invagination destroys the notion of a clearly identiﬁable and intact inside easily distinguishable from an outside, since the vagina (or the mouth or the anus or the ear, for that matter) can be seen in a sense as exterior tissue that has been folded inside, and thus as exterior and interior at the same time” (46).\n\n35\n\n8=6EI:G mystery—with the exception of locating the pearls and finding the thief.7\n\nThis title card functions as a transitional device to move the story to the next day (which could have been handled visually), but it also contains a joke wholly unavailable anywhere else in the ﬁlm; it is purely literary. Even in silent ﬁlm, images and sound signiﬁed together. The fact that Charlie Chaplin composed music for his ﬁlms acknowledges that he recognized the joint signiﬁcation of image and sound. We may rightly call Chaplin an auteur ﬁlmmaker, because he directed and also wrote, performed in, edited, produced, and scored his ﬁlms. The creation of his works and the performance of his works are inextricably bound. But few directors were directly responsible for as many facets of their ﬁlms as Chaplin. Hitchcock’s ﬁlms are marked by his unique cinematic presence, but Hitchcock did not write Vertigo or The Birds. The same is true for John Ford’s Stagecoach, Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven,8 and scores of other ﬁlms. Acknowledging writers and their works does not diminish the contributions of directors. Writers and directors are both integral to a ﬁlm. The contributions of a writer and a director to a performance of a work should be recognized in a manner similar to theater. A writer writes a play; a director guides its performance. A screenwriter writes a screenplay; a director guides its performance. Ironically, playwrights garner more attention than screenwriters. When Barefoot in the Park opened at the Biltmore Theatre in New York City in 1963, Mike Nichols directed the production, but the work was attributed to its author, Neil Simon. When Hud opened in movie theaters that same year, it was attributed to its director Martin Ritt, not the writers, Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch.\n\n7. Transcribed from the ﬁlm (line breaks are original to the title card). 8. Vertigo was written by Samuel A. Taylor and Alec Coppel, who adapted Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac’s novel D’entre les morts for the screen. Daphne du Maurier wrote the source for The Birds and Evan Hunter wrote the screenplay adaptation. Dudley Nichols and Ernest Haycox wrote Stagecoach. Paul Schrader wrote Taxi Driver. David Webb Peoples wrote Unforgiven.\n\n36\n\nThe Architecture of Performance The writer and the director are collaborators, and the writer’s contributions are already inseparable from the director’s production. Attending to the screenplay does not diminish the status of the director or undermine existing trends in ﬁlm criticism (even auteur theory is useful when applied appropriately). Published or unpublished, produced or unproduced, the screenplay’s importance to the ﬁlm is second only to the importance of photography, and a rich cache of works worthy of critical examination are waiting to be brought into the light of intellectual critique.\n\nStory and Montage We may with some conﬁdence parallel the beginning of the screenplay to the introduction of dramatic elements into ﬁlm, although we can ﬁnd earlier snippets of writing that foreshadow the screenplay. Entries in Edison’s catalogues, for instance, strongly resemble scene descriptions we ﬁnd in modern screenplays: New York in a Blizzard . . . Our camera is revolved from right to left and takes in Madison Square, Madison Square Garden, looks up Broadway from South to North, passes the Fifth Avenue Hotel and ends looking down 23rd Street West. (Jacobs 10)\n\nThis passage from the 1901–2 Edison Catalogue shares several characteristics with contemporary scene descriptions: It is written in the present tense. It tracks the action. It implies mood. Yet descriptions such as this hardly qualify as screenplays. Story made screenwriting necessary, and the work of Georges Méliès, more than any other single ﬁlmmaker, helped transform ﬁlm into a storytelling medium. When Méliès’s works were imported to America, American ﬁlm producers saw the “theatrical potential of the new medium” ( Jacobs 11), and turned to narrative as a means of regaining audiences’ waning interest in the novelty of moving pictures. This shift altered the medium’s potential by transforming each image into a contextually driven signiﬁer with an unlimited potential for reference. Prior to the introduction of story, ﬁlm was little more than a descendent of Muybridge’s serial photography. After the introduction of story, ﬁlm images could be applied in an inﬁnite number of 37\n\n8=6EI:G ways, their meaning determined by the narrative context into which they were placed rather than merely the content of the shot. Edwin S. Porter glimpsed this potential—D. W. Grifﬁth even more so—but of the early silent ﬁlmmakers, it was Pudovkin, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, and other students of the Kuleshov Workshop who most experimented with the placement of image within narrative context and the effect that placement had on signiﬁcation. Méliès’s work made possible the work of those who followed: Porter, Grifﬁth, Eisenstein, Chaplin, Mack Sennett, and so on. The shot, which previously had been primarily about what was being shot, became about why it was being shot; it came under the controlling inﬂuence of narrative. The arrangement of these shots made up what Méliès labeled artiﬁcially arranged scenes. The artiﬁcially arranged scene was the predecessor to montage. With the juxtaposition of two shots, interpretation becomes not only possible, but necessary. This is what Eisenstein refers to when he claims “montage is not an idea composed of successive shots stuck together but an idea that 9:G>K:H from the collision between two shots that are independent of one another” (“Dramaturgy” 28).9 As Eisenstein was aware, the dialectic between two diverse shots inspires interpretive thought. Audiences attempt to discern signiﬁcance in the collision of signifying images by questioning their relationship to the story. The shot is the smallest unit of ﬁlm (and competent ﬁlmmakers weigh each shot against the story), but montage requires a minimum of two shots, which prompt the reader to engage abstract thought, and moves ﬁlm further into the realm of art. Eisenstein pointed out that “a constant evolution from the interaction between two contradictory opposites” creates a “dynamic conception of objects” (“Dramaturgy” 25), and that “in the realm of art this dialectical principle of the dynamic is embodied in 8DC;A>8I as the essential basic principle of existence of every work of art and every form” (26). Since the story controls how images are sequenced in narrative ﬁlm, the construction of ﬁlmic signs is at least partly a performance of the written word. Even the purely visual elements of ﬁlms, such as those found in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), George Dunning’s Yellow\n\n9. Eisenstein takes issue with Pudovkin and others who claim that “montage is a means of unrolling an idea through single shots” (“Dramaturgy” 28).\n\n38\n\nThe Architecture of Performance Submarine (1968), or Adrian Lyne’s Jacob’s Ladder (1990), serve the narrative. Eisenstein was aware of the relationships between ﬁlm and narrative when he said, “There is no doubt that the treatment of an event is primarily determined by the author’s attitude to the content. But [ﬁlm] composition, as we understand it, is the means of expressing the author’s attitude and inﬂuencing the spectators” (Potemkin 13). Eisenstein, for all his formalistic validations, recognized that the treatment of the story must be part and parcel of any “exhaustive analysis of all the ﬁlm’s aspects” (Potemkin 7). Most ﬁlms are not manifestations of, but translations of, literary works.10 Visual narrative is not autonomous of literary narrative. When we date the emergence of the screenplay as a literary object—that is, a literary form in its own right—depends greatly on how we deﬁne “literary.” Formalism might look to early screenplays that defamiliarize conventions. Poststructuralists might consider the nascent forms as marginal texts within the form. Historicists might look to the ﬁrst screenplay to reﬂect (and possibly contribute to) its social milieu. No deﬁnitive determination is likely; however, within the motion picture industry, the nature of a screenplay remained in question until sometime after the introduction of sound. In a 1929 lecture, Benjamin Glazer (supervisor of sound for Pathé and F.B.O. Studios) articulates the difﬁculty in early deﬁnitions of the form: In the old days, a director was rather the master of the situation. If what he had down on the paper did not seem to suit the needs of the situation, he could improvise something that did seem to ﬁt. But even a motion picture director hesitates to improvise dialogue. Some tried it, and the results were lamentable. Others were wiser. “If it is dialogue we need,” they said, “let’s get some playwrights, and have dialogue written.” But even that did not work out so well, because, boiled down, a mere factual statement, like the old printed movie title, is not convincing in talk because it is not life-like.\n\n10. My discussion and claims here and throughout are exclusive of experimental, improvised ﬁlms without story. This is not an attempt to diminish their signiﬁcance to ﬁlm studies, but as my argument focuses on the screenplay, I am restricting my discussion to mainstream ﬁlms, including independent and experimental ﬁlms that begin as text.\n\n39\n\n8=6EI:G On the other hand, picture audiences are not interested in common-places, such as “Good Morning,” and “How do you do?” and “Won’t you please sit down?” and such like. They are accustomed to the bare essentials of scene and story. And so we producers are forced back on the conclusion that we have got to have picture and dialogue that go together, that contribute each to the telling of the story, that together make a complete artistic unity. (Glazer 46)\n\nGlazer goes on to point out that in 1929 New York had “a whole army . . . trained to write silent pictures, but . . . none trained to write talking pictures,” and though playwrights and screen-writers were writing screenplays, they were “fumbling in the dark” (46). Glazer admits that “if the talking picture is to be a true art form, its form is yet to be invented” (46).\n\nInherent Difﬁculties in the Study and Perception of the Screenplay Several factors make the screenplay a difﬁcult object for literary study. For one, screenplays usually pass through many hands and many revisions before reaching the screen. This results in a boggling number of versions, often by a number of different writers, some credited and some not. The screenplay for Pierre Boulle’s novel La planète des singes was written by Rod Serling and revised several times by Michael Wilson, with input from the director Franklin J. Schaffner. The Franklin J. Schaffner Collection housed at the Franklin and Marshall College Library in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, includes all of the following manuscripts: Planet of the Apes screenplay by Rod Serling, dated March 1, 1965 Revision of Planet of the Apes screenplay, by Michael Wilson, dated January 17, 1967 Revision of Planet of the Apes screenplay, by Michael Wilson, dated March 23, 1967 Final Draft (1st half ) of further revision of Planet of the Apes screenplay by Michael Wilson, dated March 31, 1967 Final Revised Screenplay for Planet of the Apes, by Michael Wilson, dated April 18, 1967\n\n40\n\nThe Architecture of Performance Shooting Script for Planet of the Apes, by Michael Wilson, dated May 5, 1967 (photoreproduction with later revisions) Shooting Script for Planet of the Apes, by Michael Wilson, dated May 5, 1967 (photoreproduction of copy with Schaffner’s notes)\n\nWhich is the authoritative text? Which should we study? Identifying the most authoritative text for a screenplay is more difﬁcult than identifying the most authoritative text for a novel or a play. Unlike novels, for which the published ﬁnal draft is usually considered authoritative, and plays, for which the version performed at the play’s debut is usually privileged, screenplays are seldom published, resulting in a daunting number of versions. Even when screenplays are published, the published versions often merely transcribe the ﬁlms (tran-scripts rather than scripts), and bear only a passing resemblance to the shooting script used in production. Determining which version to examine may appear daunting until we recognize that the notion of an authoritative text for any written work is a matter of critical consensus. An individual screenplay may have more extant versions than a novel or a play, in part because of the lengthy production process and in part because the various drafts of a novel or play are often discarded. But the ease with which authoritative versions of a novel or play can be identiﬁed is a function of the works being published and studied by large numbers of scholars and lay readers. One possibility is that, if screenplays were analyzed to the extent that novels and plays have been for hundreds of years, consensus would develop about them as it has for the others. Another more likely possibility is that critics and scholars might reevaluate critical approaches that privilege an individual text, acknowledging and sometimes incorporating the multiplicity of texts into their analyses. The numerous incarnations and transformations of a screenplay make the process of textual construction more obvious, but they do not roadblock analysis; they merely expose a truth about text that has long been obscured by wishful thinking. Which version of a screenplay we examine depends on which version seems most suited to our examination. More often than not, that will be the shooting script or the continuity script, which are usually the closest versions to what is ﬁlmed. But there are plenty of exceptions to that general guideline. For example, we might prefer to examine Quentin Tarantino’s screenplay for Natural Born Killers over Oliver Stone’s revision (or, as I do in 41\n\n8=6EI:G this book, compare both), or Rod Serling’s version of Planet of the Apes before Michael Wilson began revisions. The only version of any screenplay that begs to be discounted is the version that is transcribed from the ﬁlm, because these are too far removed from the screenwriter and, other than dialogue, carry none of his or her language. Another inherent difﬁculty is the relative inaccessibility of screenplays. Screenplays for recent, popular ﬁlms are plentiful. You can download them off the Internet and purchase them from bookstores specializing in the sale of screenplays. Screenplays from early ﬁlms and independent, experimental, foreign, and other marginalized ﬁlms are much more difﬁcult to locate. The largest collection is housed at the Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study in Beverly Hills, California, which includes the Margaret Herrick Library and the Academy Film Archive. The center contains over 6,000 early screenplays from the silent and sound era. The American Film Institute’s Louis B. Mayer Library, the Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Regional Library, UCLA’s special collections, University of Southern California’s Cinema and Television Library, and the Writers Guild–West all maintain screenplay collections. In 1998, the Margaret Herrick Library began publication of Motion Picture Scripts: A Union List, which contains location information for over 23,000 screenplays housed in various collections around Southern California. The Union List is the most concentrated source of screenplays, treatments, drafts, and so on, though screenplays can be found in special collections throughout the country. For example, the University of Iowa Libraries has ten screenplays by Louis Buñuel, which are located in the special collections of the University of Iowa Libraries, including copies of the scripts for Un chien andalou and L’age d’or. Many of the screenplays from American movies still exist, but their copies are held in private collections and libraries. It is particularly difﬁcult to locate photoplays from the silent era.11 Specialized works are scattered all across the country and locating a copy of a particular\n\n11. The most extensive collections of screenplays in English are housed in libraries at the American Film Institute (AFI); the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences (AMPAS); the Frances Howard Goldwyn Hollywood Regional Library; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Southern California; and the Writers Guild of America, West.\n\n42\n\nThe Architecture of Performance screenplay (or a particular copy of a screenplay) often involves travel and a great deal of effort. A third factor, and perhaps the most difﬁcult for literary scholars to overcome, is the formulaic nature of the screenplay. Screenplay format has evolved from its primitive beginnings, but even contemporary screenplays are written for an audience of ﬁlmmakers. Nearly all screenplays are laid out with scene headings, setting markers, dialogue markers, transitions, and other technical production information, which might lead some to dismiss their literary merit, but these notations are not substantially different from the stage directions we ﬁnd in stage plays. In fact, the screenplay has much in common with the stage play. Both are written to be performed. Both employ dramatic elements: conﬂict, resolution, irony, paradox, and so on. For both, the story and the dialogue are the central focus of the writer’s art. Both imply the direction a production should take. Both include technical information about sets, costumes, props, sound effects, visual effects, and movement. Other than the fact that stage plays have existed much longer than screenplays, it is difﬁcult to come up with objective criteria that would enable us to embrace one and eschew the other.\n\nWriting about the Screenplay Most of what is written in praise of screenplays exists in publications oriented toward future screenwriters. Aimed at students of the craft, these articles are more instructional than critical. A few qualify as scholarly works, but most suffer from a vocational slant. Frances Taylor Patterson, who taught photoplay composition at Columbia University during the silent era, wrote the ﬁrst books on screenwriting in the 1920s. Patterson admits that a screenplay (then called a “scenario”) is “composed upon the typewriter, and its merit, or lack of merit, is judged while the idea is still clothed in words, not in celluloid” (Scenario 8) and that “writing for the screen is an art” (Cinema 2); nevertheless, he makes depreciatory comments about the screenplay’s place in literature: A photoplay has no objective reality until it reaches the screen. Closet drama may exist, if you will—the plays of Tennyson and Swinburne may be read with the deepest enjoyment in the library—but there\n\n43\n\n8=6EI:G can be no closet photodrama. A stage play in manuscript form may be literature, although not necessarily so. The dialogue exists exactly as it is to be upon the stage with only the voices and mannerisms of the actors and actresses lacking. The action is usually written in. The plays of Shaw, Galsworthy, Barrie, Pinero, Jones, are almost as popular as reading matter in the libraries as are novels and short stories of a like literary ﬂavor. Not so with the photoplay. A photoplay does not actually become one until it exists in ﬁlm. (Cinema 2)\n\nPatterson’s dismissal of the screenplay’s literary merit foreshadows contemporary opinion. He, like those who follow, confuses popular apprehension with literary merit. Whether or not a screenplay is popular as reading matter is irrelevant to its value as a written work. Employing that criterion to judge the value of written works would result in the decanonization of many masterpieces (Finnegans Wake, for example), which also are not popular parlor reading. Although dismissals like Patterson’s can be unearthed well into the twentieth century, most scholars do not actively deny the screenplay’s literary merit; they simply don’t consider it, which is far more damaging than critical dismissal. As William Horne notes, “There will be no substantive study of the script, until and unless it is afforded its own legitimate aesthetic existence—not merely as a set of interim production notes or as a substitute ﬁlm—but as a separate work . . . it is crucially important that the screenplay be viewed not only as a shooting script but as an independent text” (53). To judge works as unworthy of critical attention requires some critical attention, at least enough to make a reasoned judgment. But the screenplay has been, for the most part, ignored, making critical redemption difﬁcult. The lack of scholarship on the screenplay is more oversight than verdict. Wherever one chooses to situate the analysis of the screenplay (e.g., ﬁlm studies, literary studies, cultural studies), it merits serious inquiry. The screenplay is of historical and literary signiﬁcance to studies in ﬁlm, literature, and culture, and it is amenable to the same critical approaches.\n\n44\n\nAristotle, Aesthetics, and Critical Approaches to the Screenplay\n\nIn constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction, the poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his eyes. In this way, seeing everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a spectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping with it, and be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies. —Aristotle, Poetics (87)\n\nCritical examinations of screenplays summon the longer critical histories of drama and literary studies, the earliest being those of Plato and Aristotle, that are founded on the view of art as reproduction. Both Plato and Aristotle equate ﬁdelity to ideal forms with aesthetic value and argue that the further a work of art is removed from its ideal, the more its aesthetic qualities diminish. This raises some interesting questions. How, for example, do we judge the aesthetic merits of a screenplay if the ﬁlm is always"
