        "text": "Alan Sharp, a screenwriter whose brand of dark, lyrical and densely plotted work, including the screenplay for Arthur Penn’s “Night Moves,” made him a critically admired if largely unknown figure in Hollywood, died on Friday in Los Angeles. He was 79.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said his daughter Louise Sharp.\n\nMr. Sharp, who was born in Scotland, specialized in scripts that turned the tables on movie conventions. In the 1970s, his best-known narratives created and then disassembled audience expectations about all the usual Hollywood verities, especially the triumph of justice, love and friendship.\n\nIn “The Hired Hand” (1971), starring and directed by Peter Fonda in his first film after “Easy Rider,” Mr. Sharp constructed what the film critic J. Hoberman called a hippie western, in which true love is put through its paces only to stumble at the finish line. For the director Robert Aldrich’s “Ulzana’s Raid” (1972), starring Burt Lancaster, Mr. Sharp’s descriptions of torture and killing are so overwhelming that the line between good guys and bad guys seems irrelevant.\n\nIn “Night Moves” (1975) Gene Hackman plays a private eye who cannot figure out the whodunit of his own crumbling marriage. An often-quoted exchange from the film encapsulated Mr. Sharp’s dark vision and caustic wit."
