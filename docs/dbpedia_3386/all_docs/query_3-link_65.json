        "text": "Scriptwriting requires not just knowledge of story, character, and theme, but also an understanding of the professional screenplay format (more on this in a moment). It helps to read scripts and watch movies you’ve read the scripts for (seeing how one translates into the other can be immeasurably educational).\n\n1. Craft a logline\n\nA logline is a one or two sentence description of a movie that hooks the reader through efficient and careful wording. The trick here is to be descriptive without being too wordhy. You want to give your reader a sense of the movie they’re in for and ideally leave them with a desire to know more about it.\n\n2. Build a beat sheet\n\nA beat sheet identifies a screenplay’s key characters and moments, mapping out events in the order they’ll unfold in the film.\n\n3. Write an outline\n\nAn outline is a more detailed version of the beat sheet. Essentially the beats in this iteration will be fleshed out with details, adding weight to the characters and story.\n\n4. Compose a treatment\n\nOnce an outline is complete, the document can be converted into a treatment. This is where all the elements that had been delineated in the outline are set in a synopsis form. Here, the story should seem less mechanical and possess its own narrative flow.\n\n5. Write the first draft\n\nThis is the first (of many) version of the screenplay. Here, the treatment is turned into a fully formatted screenplay. First drafts (sometimes referred to as “kitchen sink drafts”) tend to run longer than subsequent drafts, as they’re meant to incorporate all the ideas that existed in the prior iterations of the story.\n\n6. Rewrite (and then rewrite some more)\n\nOnce the draft is done and the screenwriter is able to take a bit of time away from the piece, it’s time to rewrite. Sometimes writers will give scripts to colleagues for feedback. Screenplays can go through many, many drafts before they’re ready for sale (and then even more before they’re ready for production – it’s extremely rare for a screenplay to survive the production process with no rewrites).\n\n7. Submit\n\nWhether that be to an Agent, manager, studio head or competition, once a script is ready to go out, a writer should have a strategy in mind for where – and to whom – they’re sending their work.\n\nI think there’s no right way to write a screenplay. You usually want to have a sense of where you’re going. You probably should read a book or two. Save the Cat! . . . is a good resource for showing beginners how a movie is structured. It doesn’t have to be structured the way he does it, but it’s a good starting-off point to get you thinking.\n\nSome people write their scenes out on notecards or white boards and piece it together like a puzzle before they start. Others like to outline. I like a rough outline, so I know where I’m going–but I like to leave a lot for discovery and surprise along the way. That’s the real fun part for me. Coming up with ideas and scenes that you didn’t even know were in you. Painting characters into a corner and figuring out an interesting way for them to get out of it.\n\nI would advise against charging into the writing process for a beginner, because most of the time you’ll hit a wall and not know why you’re stuck. Then it’s harder to go back and try to untangle why you’ve gotten there.\n\nI would also say, not to let anybody read your script until you’ve hit the end of your first draft. Once you’re done, give it to as many Writers or Teachers or industry people as you can. Everyday friends can’t give you real valuable screenwriting feedback–just because you like movies doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to quantify how a screenplay isn’t working or how to make it better. And when you get feedback, you have to let yourself be open to criticism and know that it’ll only make it better in the end. You need to be thick-skinned to be a Screenwriter and willing to kill your darlings. Writing is rewriting.\n\nTo me, you should start by reading as many screenplays as you can. Read the type of work, and the genres, you love and resonate with–and hope to stylistically write. You can Google search for screenplay PDFs, or order them online. Read books about screenwriting, such as Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, Screenplay by Syd Field, and Story by Robert McKee.\n\nLearning about structure is essential, and will ultimately free you creatively once you learn more about how a screenplay is more formally constructed. Write spec scripts. You will probably throw out most of them later on, but that’s okay. You must work, and write, to develop your style. And that will take years. It is an ever-evolving process.\n\nPersonally, when I sit down to write a screenplay, I have gestated the idea for a long time. Before I put my fingertips to the keys, I do quite a bit of thinking, walking around in nature, listening to classical music (I have an ever-growing “writing” playlist). I work through beat sheets and outlines.\n\nIf I am writing something original, I spend hours upon hours imbuing meanings behind my character names. I have days where I feel like I’ve failed, others when I feel like I’ve succeeded. Over the years I’ve become less afraid to throw bad pages out or start all over again. Once I have a draft, I speak the dialogue aloud, feeling out how it sounds in the air–does it sound truthful, real, authentic?\n\nThat whole process can sometimes take a long time–weeks, months, years–every project is different. But once I am ready to write, it feels like a little bell going off. And then there is a settled feeling, and I personally tend to write a first draft quite quickly. After that initial draft is out, however (which is so exciting) the work has only just begun.\n\nFrom there I re-write like crazy. Later, if I am lucky enough for that project to go somewhere and transform from a hundred or so black and white pages into a living, breathing film or another medium, and I begin working with the Producers, Actors, and other creatives, I re-write again.\n\nScreenplays and stories are ever-changing, ever-evolving, and I love the collaboration that comes from that, especially getting to know the characters once they are alive and in front of me. I enjoy studying speech patterns and idiosyncrasies. And when you’re sitting in that first table read, hearing your words aloud for the very first time–it is truly surreal. All the hard work is worth it.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is decide what you want to write. You’re always going to have a lot of ideas competing for bandwidth inside your head and you have to pick the one that’s going to be the right one.\n\nI apply a really simple litmus test. It’s the idea I wake up thinking about. If I don’t wake up thinking about an idea—if there isn’t something inside me subconsciously trying to claw its way out—I won’t do my most inspired work. So that’s the first thing.\n\nOnce you decide what it is you want to write, ask yourself, “What does that movie or TV show feel like tonally? Does it feel like an action movie? Does it feel like a drama? Does it feel like a horror?”\n\nOnce I’ve settled on a tone, then I think about other movies that have already been made in that tone. I will go out and get the soundtrack from one of those movies, play it and get myself in the emotional headspace of what that tone feels like. Then the ideas come to me.\n\nAs the ideas come to me, I’m constantly writing them down. I open a file on my computer where I start putting together a treatment. Just random ideas about scenes, characters, what the world looks like, what the theme should be. Any idea I can come up with at that moment gets thrown in there. I don’t edit myself during that process. I don’t judge myself in any way. I know some of the ideas are going to be dumb. That’s absolutely fine.\n\nIt’s just letting yourself have a certain consciousness about it at that time. Anything that sounds intriguing, just write it down. Once you’ve been doing that for a while–it takes a couple of weeks–then you step back.\n\nDo you know how to do a sculpture of an elephant? You start with a block of granite and you chip away everything that’s not an elephant, right? All these ideas are your block of granite. You step back and say, “What’s the story in here? What’s the simple, emotional journey I’m trying to tell?” Anything that isn’t that just falls out of the treatment and now you’re left with your elephant, which is the story you’re supposed to be telling.\n\nI never write a script without starting with a treatment first. It usually ends up being 30 or 40 pages with a bit of dialogue but it’s just scratch-track dialogue.\n\nWhen I wrote the script for Captain Phillips, I was working off a treatment that was 65 pages because I had so much information I had learned about the Merchant Marine and how it worked. When I wrote The Comey Rule, the treatment was 144 pages. It was every note I had taken from every interview. It was every note I had taken from every book, the IG report, available recordings. So treatments can vary in size.\n\nBut when I start to write the script, I stay inside that same treatment. The scenes that I write cannibalize the ideas that I have in the treatment, so pretty soon the treatment stops being ideas and starts being scenes.\n\nThe reason I do that is that it takes the terror out of writing. You’re not going to start your screenplay by staring at a blank page and a blinking cursor telling you that you don’t have any talent. By the time you sit down to write the first draft, you’ve got 30 pages of treatment in front of you and it just makes you more confident.\n\nIt is very hard to write a screenplay. It should be hard to write a screenplay. It’s a wonderful way to make a living–telling stories all day long. It beats digging a ditch. It beats working in an emergency room and getting COVID. It’s a great job and therefore it shouldn’t be available to everybody.\n\nIt’s hard because we collectively, as a culture, have seen a lot of movies and a lot of TV shows. We’ve seen many stories play out and so our standards are very tough to beat.\n\nBy that, I mean stories that surprise us. We’ve seen just about every twist there is. We’ve seen lots of different characters and lots of different conflicts, so what’s difficult is staying within the rules of good screenwriting and yet breaking them in a way that is unexpected and perhaps paradigm-shifting.\n\nThe fact that it’s hard doesn’t mean it cannot be done. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try. You become a writer by writing. You don’t become a writer by thinking. You have to sit down and do it.\n\nWhat I would say to a 15-year-old wanting to write a screenplay is that a goal without a plan is just a wish. Start applying your plan to your goal, and that plan should involve reading screenplays. They are very easy to get online. Or watching movies that you’ve seen two times. Watch them three more times and see what makes them work.\n\nAsk yourself at what point of the story do you become engaged or at what point in the story do you fall out of that engagement? When do you stop caring and why? It could be that a moment sixty minutes into the movie is supposed to make you cry and it didn’t. Ask yourself why. Chances are it’s because you weren’t engaged enough on page five.\n\nWhen I was first coming up, I was interning for these two TV Producers when I was still at UCLA. It was a big internship and I read every script that came through that office. And I would ask myself, “This script is working. Why? This script is not working. Why?” And you start to do that kind of analysis and you learn right where you want to be.\n\nThere are a lot of things. One is the Writer having a unique voice. A screenplay that feels like only one person in the world could have written it. One thing that inexperienced Writers always forget is that there is no one in the world that has your voice. Nobody has your past, your history, your talent, your pain, your energy, your joy–that’s unique to you.\n\nIt’s like a snowflake in that way. No one can write the screenplay that you can write, including me. But I want to see that translate on the page. I don’t want to see a screenplay that anybody could have written. So that’s one of the things that I look at first.\n\nDoes the person develop characters in a way that’s interesting? Does the person pick a world that’s really specific and detailed? Do people behave in an idiosyncratic way? (Which is a very good thing.) Can they write a scene? Can they actually keep my interest for a scene?\n\nThe most important thing of all of it is, do they make me care? Screenplays are an intellectual exercise designed to elicit an emotional response. If I write a script and someone calls me and says, “This is the smartest script I’ve ever read,” I have failed 100 percent. Because I’m reaching them in their head instead of their guts. Belief and love are the ones that hit you in your guts. They’re the ones that make you feel. They make you root for something.\n\n“God, I hope Dorothy makes it home. God, I hope Chief Brody catches the shark. God, I hope Rocky wins the fight.” That’s because you’re invested. The primary job of a Screenwriter is to make sure the audience is going to be invested. You want to do the thinking so they can just do the feeling. That’s the thing I’m looking for most.\n\nAshley Avis\n\nAshley Avis is an award-winning American filmmaker.
