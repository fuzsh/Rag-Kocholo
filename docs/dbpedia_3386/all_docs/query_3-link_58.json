        "text": "What is your name?\n\nNick Leidl\n\nWhat is your genre of music?\n\nI am a singer/songwriter & comedian. My style of music is Country meets a lil 90’s rock.\n\nGive us a little bio about you.\n\nI have worn many hats in the entertainment business. Music has always been a huge part of my life.. I started as a DJ at the age of 14 and, to this day, I still consistently DJ events, weddings and nightclubs, etc. I spent many years as a stand up comedian as well and enjoyed some success. But the interesting thing is, my journey as a singer/songwriter started in 2020. When covid shut things down, I used my quarantine time to start writing music, something I always felt I could do. As I gained more and more momentum, I continued to push harder and harder with it. I released 3 singles in 2021, and all 3 charted well on the Itunes charts. Not only does creating music feel right, but it has been well received on top of it.\n\nWhat made you go into music?\n\nI have always been a passionate writer. I’ve written several screenplays and done a lot of creative writing. But the emphasis of my writing was usually meant to be funny. So when I decided to shift my focus to song-writing, I knew I had something to say. There was a pain I wanted to let out. The arts have always given me an outlet from the brain noise in my head and truly express myself. For years I had expressed myself thru my stand up comedy, but when I started writing songs, I felt a catharsis. Ultimately, Comedy was about making people laugh. But with music, it was about true expression. In the past few years I had hardship in my life and I found that making jokes about it was not really very satisfying to my soul. But in the songs, I could be genuine every step of the way as to how I was really feeling. I am not afraid to admit to the world that I feel things very heavily. I’m extremely emotional. As for singing, well I have come to learn quick, that there is nothing more vulnerable that singing, especially when you are singing words that you wrote and you are held to those words. Simply put, I don’t quite know how I got here, but I’ve never felt this good.\n\nWho are your influences?\n\nBob Dylan, Billy Joel, Noel Gallagher, Garth Brooks, Chris Stapleton, Adele. The list seems to change for me but these are some of the big ones recently.\n\nAre you signed?\n\nI am 100% independent.\n\nYou released your new single ‘Something About Her’, tell us more about the single.\n\nI released the song on 12/3. I was so excited to see it chart #32 on the Itunes Country Chart and #152 on the Itunes All-Genre charts. I wrote the song about a year and a half ago during covid quarantine. I tested it out on the Instagram Live feeds that I have been consistently doing since 2016 for a loyal group of supporters. It was a big favorite of my fan base, who have since come to be known as the #LeidlsIdols. I do a lot of LIVE feeds on Instagram and people had been asking me to play it over and over for the last year. Then they started asking me to record it. Then a few fans started sending money and various resources to cover all of the recording and promotional costs. It just felt like the right song to record at this time and I’m so glad I did. It’s a song that really means something to me because I pretty much lived every line of it.\n\nWhat is the meaning behind the single?\n\nThe song is an emotional one for me. I wrote it during Quarantine, when I was mostly alone and had a lot of time to reflect. Originally it was more of a humorous song, but as it evolved, it became a song about exactly how I was feeling when I had met my (now ex-wife) years earlier. I put myself in a mental time machine and remembered how I felt as we were moving towards marriage. I had doubts, there were red flags (on my part as well), but for some reason we went for it. And in the end, when it didn’t work out, I often asked myself what made me do it. Hence the title. There was Something About Her, then the chorus flowed from there. Even the tone is so reflective of how I felt during it. You can feel the pain and passion but at the same time there is a cheekiness to the lyrics and the details that I’m quite proud of.\n\nWhat was the writing and recording process like?\n\nIt took a while to record this one in a way that I was truly happy with it. There were several drafts, several lyric changes, several melody changes. Early on it had a very 90s feel to it. But we kept going over it and eventually it took more of a country shape. I also did extensive vocal training over the last 8 months after the success of my first single. I trained every day 5-6 hours. So we kept recutting the vocals as I seemed to be getting better and more consistent by the week. Eventually myself and my producer, Bryan Kuban, got it to where it felt right.\n\nDescribe the track in two words.\n\nI’m way too talkative to say anything in 2 words so I’m struggling with this question, but I’m gonna go with “Blind Love”\n\nWho did you work with on the single?\n\nI worked with my producer and friend, Bryan Kuban, and my vocal coach and friend, Tracie Jones. They spent so much time with me getting it right and I’m very grateful to both of them. Not only are they awesome at what they do, but they both have dedicated their lives to music and I’ve learned so much from being in their presence.\n\nWill we see a Music video for ‘Something About Her’ and if so, what can we expect from it?\n\nNo plans just yet, but since the song is being well received, I’m considering it. I’m leaning more toward doing a LIVE acoustic music video version of it.\n\nWill we see a EP or Album and if so what can we expect from it.\n\nI have so many songs written but I’m really trying to slow down and make sure everything I put out is of the highest quality and something that I can be proud. For the time being, I will continue to regularly drop singles.\n\nDo you have any live shows or a tour coming up and if so let us know where we can catch you at?\n\nCurrently I’m playing local shows and doing a ton of rehearsing as I’m getting myself set to hit the road in 2022.\n\nWhat else can we expect at the end of 2021/ Early 2022?\n\nI will hands down be releasing some of the most vulnerable tunes that I have written. I want people to hear my stuff and say, “ that guy feels stuff hard” – Look out for tracks such as “Damaged Goods”; “Fix Me” ; “Second Wave of Pain” ; “Fell 4 U” ; “Sex is My Drug” and many many more.\n\nWhere do you see yourself now in 5 Years?\n\nI see myself very proud and comfortable with the choices that I made to go ‘all in’ with my music in 2020. I see myself looking back, at a guy with no training, who started doing music later in his life on a whim, and being extremely proud that I trusted my gut and went for it and worked and trained so ridiculously hard to reach my goals. I’m confident that I’m gonna carve out a spot for myself in the music world, all long as I always stay true to who I am..\n\nWhat quote or saying do you always stick by?\n\n“It’s never too late to start something new” It’s written on my fridge.\n\nAnother one is “F with the people who F with you.” Surround yourself by people who believe in what you are doing. That’s critical.\n\nFinal quote, and I say to so many people I meet, ‘the working man knows no shame” – Never feel shame about what it takes to put food on your table and continue to strive toward your goals.\n\nWhen you are at a gig, what are 5 things you cannot forget?\n\nCough drops, a guitar pick, a massive bottle of water, my hair gel, my anti nail-biting polish 🙂"
