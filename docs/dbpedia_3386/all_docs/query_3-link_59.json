        "text": "1.1.2. Antecedents. [Back to Page Topics]\n\nIf we cannot trace a direct lineage for the screenplay, we can survey a history of scripting practices. Motion pictures began as novelty, not narrative, but even some of the earliest filmmakers found scripting practices useful in the conception of their products. These early “scripts” were little more than brief synopses. “From 1896 to 1901,” writes Isabelle Raynauld, “scenarios were written in synopsis form and rarely were longer than one paragraph. Many, in fact, were even shorter: they included a title and a one-line description of the action to be seen.” She goes on to note how these early protoscripts also served a marketing function:\n\nFor example, it was a common practice to print the screenplays in full (long mistakenly considered to be merely summaries) in company catalogues. In fact, early scripts were not only used as publicity material but also helped exhibitors explain the story to new, inexperienced spectators. For the first ten years or so, exhibitors would often hire a lecturer or bonimenteur to comment on and clarify the story during the projection of the film.”\n\nExcerpts from the Edison Studios catalog offer examples of such synopses, such as 1897’s “Pillow Fight” (“Four young ladies, in their nightgowns, are having a romp. One of the pillows gets torn, and the feathers fly all over the room.”) and the decidedly more racist “A Morning Bath” (“Mammy is washing her little pickaninny. She thrusts him, kicking and struggling, into a tub full of foaming suds.”) , the original text of which is censored in the Library of Congress’s online archive.\n\nAfter 1901, as films grew in length and narrative concerns grew more prominent, the importance of scripting as a conceptual tool increased. Out of this need for narrative coherence, the scenario proper was born. “The film script was born,” observes Béla Balázs, “when the film had already developed into an independent new art and it was no longer possible to improvise its new subtle visual effects in front of the camera; these had to be planned carefully in advance.”\n\nIn his Script Culture and the American Screenplay, Kevin Alexander Boon draws from several early scenario examples, including Georges Melies’s A Trip to the Moon and Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery, to demonstrate the rapid development of scripting practices at the turn of the century. “Early predecessors of the screenplay did little more than frame the narrative context for a scene,” writes Boon. “One of the first major infusions of story into filmmaking was Georges Melies’s A Trip to the Moon (Le voyage dans la lune, 1902), which [. . .] involved a great deal of preparation from Melies. One part of this preparation was the writing of a sparse scenario [. . .]” The complete text of the Melies scenario follows:\n\nThe Scientific Congress at the Astronomic Club.\n\nPlanning the Trip. Appointing the Explorers and Servants. Farewell.\n\nThe Workshops. Constructing the Projectile.\n\nThe Foundries. The Chimney-stack. The Casting of the Monster Gun/Cannon.\n\nThe Astronomers-Scientists Enter the Shell.\n\nLoading the Gun.\n\nThe Monster Gun. March Past the Gunners. Fire!!! Saluting the Flag.\n\nThe Flight Through Space. Approaching the Moon.\n\nLanding Right in the Moon’s Eye!!!\n\nFlight of the Rocket Shell into the Moon. Appearance of the Earth From the Moon.\n\nThe Plain of Craters. Volcanic Eruption.\n\nThe Dream of ‘Stars’ (the Bolies, the Great Bear, Phoebus, the Twin Stars, Saturn).\n\nThe Snowstorm.\n\n40 Degrees Below Zero. Descent Into a Lunar Crater.\n\nIn the Interior of the Moon. The Giant Mushroom Grotto.\n\nEncounter and Fight with the Selenites.\n\nTaken Prisoners!!\n\nThe Kingdom of the Moon. The Selenite Army.\n\nThe Flight or Escape.\n\nWild Pursuit.\n\nThe Astronomers Find the Shell Again. Departure from the Moon in the Rocket.\n\nThe Rocket’s Vertical Drop into Space.\n\nSplashing into the Open Sea.\n\nSubmerged At the Bottom of the Ocean.\n\nThe Rescue.

Triumphal March Past.\n\nErection of the Commemorative Statue by the Mayor and Council.\n\nPublic Rejoicings.\n\n“The first scripts were in fact mere technical aids,” writes Balázs, “nothing but lists of the scenes and shots for the convenience of the director. They merely indicated what was to be in the picture, and in what order, but said nothing about how it was to be presented.” Melies’ primitive list fits this description, bearing little resemblance to the contemporary screenplay form, but it succeeds in clearly ordering the narrative discourse of the motion picture.\n\nBy 1903, Scott Marble’s scenario for Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery already exhibits elements of what will come to be known as the Master Scene Format, only without dialogue. Here is Marble’s scenario reprinted in its entirety:\n\n1 INTERIOR OF RAILROAD TELEGRAPH OFFICE. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to get the \"signal block\" to stop the approaching train, and make him write a fictitious order to the engineer to take water at this station, instead of \"Red Lodge,\" the regular watering stop. The train comes to a standstill (seen through window of office); the conductor comes to the window, and the frightened operator delivers the order while the bandits crouch out of sight, at the same time keeping him covered with their revolvers. As soon as the conductor leaves, they fall upon the operator, bind and gag him, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. 2 RAILROAD WATER TOWER. The bandits are hiding behind the tank as the train, under the false order, stops to take water. Just before she pulls out they stealthily board the train between the express car and the tender. 3 INTERIOR OF EXPRESS CAR. Messenger is busily engaged. An unusual sound alarms him. He goes to the door, peeps through the keyhole and discovers two men trying to break in. He starts back bewildered, but, quickly recovering, he hastily locks the strong box containing the valuables and throws the key through the open side door. Drawing his revolver, he crouches behind a desk. In the meantime, the two robbers have succeeded in breaking in the door and enter cautiously. The messenger opens fire, and a desperate pistol duel takes place in which the messenger is killed. One of the robbers stands watch while the other tries to open the treasure box. Finding it locked, he vainly searches the messenger for the key, and blows the safe open with dynamite. Securing the valuables and mail bags they leave the car. 4 THE TENDER AND INTERIOR OF THE LOCOMOTIVE CAB This thrilling scene shows THE TENDER AND INTERIOR OF THE LOCOMOTIVE CAB, while the the train is running forty miles an hour. While two of the bandits have been robbing the mail car, two others climb over the tender. One of them holds up the engineer while the other covers the fireman, who seizes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender, where a desperate fight takes place. They struggle fiercely all over the tank and narrowly escape being hurled over the side of the tender. Finally they fall, with the robber on top. He seizes a lump of coal, and strikes the fireman on the head until he becomes senseless. He then hurls the body from the swiftly moving train. The bandits then compel the engineer to bring the train to a stop. 5 SHOWS THE TRAIN COMING TO A STOP Shows THE TRAIN coming to a stop. The engineer leaves the locomotive, uncouples it from the train, and pulls ahead about 100 feet while the robbers hold their pistols to his face. 6 EXTERIOR SCENE SHOWING TRAIN. The bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches, \"hands up,\" and line up along the tracks. One of the robbers covers them with a revolver in each hand, while the others relieve the passengers of their valuables. A passenger attempts to escape, and is instantly shot down. Securing everything of value, the band terrorize the passengers by firing their revolvers in the air, while they make their escape to the locomotive. 7 LOCOMOTIVE. The desperadoes board the locomotive with this booty, compel the engineer to start, and disappear in the distance. 8 THE ROBBERS Bring the engine to a stop several miles from the scene of the \"hold up,\" and take to the mountains. 9 VALLEY A beautiful scene in A VALLEY. The bandits come down the side of a hill, across a narrow stream, mounting their horses, and make for the wilderness. 10 INTERIOR OF TELEGRAPH OFFICE. The operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After struggling to his feet, he leans on the table, and telegraphs for assistance by manipulating the key with his chin, and then faints from exhaustion. His little daughter enters with his dinner pail. She cuts the rope, throws a glass of water in his face, restores him to consciousness, and, recalling his thrilling experience, he rushes out to give the alarm. 11 INTERIOR OF A TYPICAL WESTERN DANCE HALL. Shows a number of men and women in a lively quadrille. A \"tenderfoot\" is quickly spotted and pushed to the center of the hall, and compelled to do a jig, while bystanders amuse themselves by shooting dangerously close to his feet. Suddenly the door opens and the half-dead telegraph operator staggers in. The dance breaks up in confusion. The men secure their rifles and hastily leave the room. 12 RUGGED HILL Shows the mounted robbers dashing down A RUGGED HILL at a terrific pace, followed closely by a large posse, both parties firing as they ride. One of the desperadoes is shot and plunges headlong from his horse. Staggering to his feet, he fires at the nearest pursuer, only to be shot dead a moment later. 13 THE THREE REMAINING BANDITS Thinking they have eluded the pursuers, have dismounted from their horses, and after carefully surveying their surroundings, they start to examine the contents of the mail pouches. They are so grossly engaged in their work that they do not realize the approaching danger until too late. The pursuers, having left their horses, steal noiselessly down upon them until they are completely surrounded. A desperate battle then takes place, and after a brave stand all the robbers and some of the posse bite the dust. 14 BARNES A life-size [close-up] picture of Barnes, leader of the outlaw band, taking aim and firing point-blank at the audience. The resulting excitement is great. This scene can be used to begin or end the picture.\n\nHere scene headings begin to emerge, along with detailed scene text that explicates the action. As with contemporary screenplays, Marble’s scenario is divided into master scenes, not individual shots. This itself should not be viewed as a formatting decision, however, as motion pictures had yet to innovate the language of cutting within the scene to multiple shots. Indeed, “scene 14” in The Great Train Robbery — the closeup of Barnes — was a sensational experiment in its time. It would be years before filmmakers began to routinely cut within a scene to closeups and other angles.\n\nWhile the scenario format proved adequate in scripting for narrative coherence, the development of a new film grammar of cutting to multiple shots within a single scene provoked the need for a different scripting practice that addressed a more complex problem: visual coherence. “A major identifying difference between the scenario script and the continuity script,” observes Maras, “is that in the former, scenes are listed as ‘scenes’, whereas in the latter a ‘scene’ consists of a number of shots, each of which are listed in the script.”\n\nIndustrial changes also preceded the shift between scripting practices. In the first 18 years of film production, directors and cameramen were given varying degrees of independence to shoot their pictures in the manner they preferred. As demand for multiple reel pictures increased, however, production companies grew in size and the cost of production became more expensive. With increased capital investment came the need for a new Central Producer System of production management that shifted authority away from directors to powerful studio executives.\n\nJanet Staiger outlines how the incorporation of Frederick Winslow Taylor’s scientific management theories led to a detailed division of labor and the need for a Central Producer to approve all scripts. “It was cheaper,” writes Staiger, “to pay a few workers to prepare scripts and solve continuity problems at that stage than it was to let a whole crew of laborers work it out on the set or by retakes later. Because the scripts provided the means to ensure the conventions of continuous action, they soon became known as ‘continuities.'” These documents made it possible for the Central Producer to predict and approve a detailed budget for each production.\n\nAccording to Staiger, the continuity had become more or less standard practice by 1914, and according to Marc Norman, this standard “evolved from multiple sources but mostly from Thomas Ince.” Boon also credits Ince:\n\nThe history of the screenplay begins [. . .] in the 1910s, around the time Thomas Harper Ince began making films. [. . .] Under Ince’s guidance, ‘writing for film became truly efficient for the first time . . . and developed into the indispensable core’ (82) of the filmmaking system. The written text that guided a film’s production became a literary form. The text rendered the shots that the director later realized.”\n\nInce, according to Norman, “invented the movie studio.” Establishing his Inceville studio on an 18,000 acre ranch in California, Ince applied classical management theory and “assembly-line techniques, perfected by manufacturing giants like Henry Ford” to the making of motion pictures. In this context, the conventions of writing for the screen solidified. “In fact,” Norman observes, “the key to Ince’s method was the screenplay itself, under him no longer simply a one-page precis of the film’s narrative but the blueprint for the entire production.” What follows is a continuity excerpt from Satan McAllister’s Heir, written by C. Gardner Sullivan and Thomas H. Ince in 1914:\n\n25. CLOSE UP ON SATAN, BOB AND HATTIE AT SCHOONER Satan is coldly telling them they will have to get out -- they look at him and at each other apprehensively -- he speaks -- INSERT TITLE -- \"I AIN'T WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SOCIABLE CUSS AND I AIN'T ENCOURAGIN' NEIGHBORS.\" BACK TO ACTION -- Satan continues to gaze at Bob with a deadly contempt -- the latter looks at him but says nothing -- 26. CLOSE UP ON DOLLY AT CREEK BANK She has filled her canteen and is leaning over drinking from the creek -- Rags is fussing about her and she cups her hands and fills them with water that he may drink -- see if he won't drink -- make a cute scene of it -- 27. CLOSE UP ON SATAN, BOB AND HATTIE AT SCHOONER Cut back to Satan ordering them to leave -- Bob starts to speak but Satan interrupts him and says -- INSERT TITLE -- \"WHEN THEY DON'T TAKE THE HINT AND MOVE ON, I ANNOY THEM PLUM SCANDALOUS\" BACK TO ACTION -- he drops his hands suggestively on the handles of his pistols and holds the pose for the moral effect on them -- they stare at him and show they are frightened and discouraged by his attitude --\n\nNorman repeats the myth that Ince stamped his scripts, “Produce exactly as written,” something Maras argues “has not been supported by the evidence.” Nevertheless, the shot-by-shot detail of Ince’s continuity, along with specific instructions for the filmmaker such as, “make a cute scene of it,” do suggest a blueprint role for the text, with production reduced to its execution.\n\nStaiger notes that Ince’s continuities were not merely scripts but, in fact, complex packages comprised of multiple production documents:\n\nEach script has a number assigned to it which provides a method of tracing the film even though its title might shift. A cover page indicates who wrote the scenario, who directed the shooting, when shooting began and ended, when the film was shipped to the distributors, and when the film was released. The entire history on paper records the production process for efficiency and waste control.\n\nThe next part is a list of all intertitles and an indication as to where they are to be inserted in the final print. The location page follows that. It lists all exterior and interior sites along with their scene numbers, providing efficiency and preventing waste in time and labor. […]\n\nThe cast of characters follows. The typed portions list the roles for the story and penciled in are the names of the people assigned to play each part.\n\nA one-page synopsis follows and then the script itself. Each scene is numbered consecutively and its location is given. Intertitles are typed in, often in red ink, where they are to be inserted in the final version. The description of mise-en-scene and action is detailed. […]\n\nOccasionally there is the typed injunction: ‘It is earnestly requested by Mr. Ince that no change of any nature be made in the scenario either by elimination of any scenes or the addition of any scenes or changing any of the action as described, or titles, without first consulting him.’ […]\n\nFinally, and very significantly, attached to the continuity is the entire cost of the film, which is analyzed in a standard accounting format.”\n\nClearly, Ince was interested in separating conception from execution.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that while Ince was elevating the importance of the script, D. W. Griffith was shooting The Birth of a Nation without one. The Hollywood industrial system had embraced the written text as an important guiding force in the production of entertainment properties, but one of early cinema’s most important and innovative artists saw no need for one. The process of scripting for the screen did not so much emerge naturally from other literary forms such as the play script, the novel, or poetry nor to meet the artistic needs of filmmakers but developed primarily to address the manufacturing needs of industrial production."
