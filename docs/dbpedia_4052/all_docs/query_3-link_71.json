        "text": "In recent years, much has been made of the phenomenon of “outsider art,” or art brut. These terms, created respectively by art critic Roger Cardinal and artist Jean Dubuffet, refer to the creations of artists who work outside of the mainstream, such as psychiatric patients.\n\nNow, the term applies to visual art, but if we shift the definition to include the written word, I can think of no more prominent standard-bearer for lit brut than dive bar janitor Charlie Kelly of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n\nCharlie’s illiteracy is one of the show’s most dependable running gags, but in spite of his inability to read or write, he creates. Constantly. Whether it be songs, poems, or plays, Charlie is far and away the most artistic and literary member of the Sunny gang.\n\nAfter I recently passed off one of Charlie’s creations as an e.e. cummings poem, to great success and over a thousand notes on Tumblr from kids tagging it #poetry and #words and #this is so beautiful, I’ve decided to conduct a little experiment.\n\nBelow you’ll find excerpts of several poems – some by Charles Bukowski, and some by Charlie Kelly. Can you guess which is which without peeking at the answer key?\n\nI’ve taken the liberty of removing capitalization and most punctuation to level the playing field, but all wording and line breaks remain the same.\n\nGood luck!\n\n1.\n\nthen i got up and took a crap\n\nthere was a big spider in marie’s bathroom\n\nbut i crapped\n\n2.\n\nwhat we need is more\n\nbeer\n\n3.\n\nthere’s a spider\n\nhe’s deep in my soul\n\nhe’s lived here for years\n\n4.\n\ni remember the cows\n\ni once painted in art class\n\nand they looked good\n\n5.\n\ni run and run and run and run\n\nand run and run and run\n\nhe guns and guns and\n\nguns and guns and guns\n\nand guns and guns\n\n6.\n\nspeaks like zeus\n\nsmells like poops\n\nrage all over\n\nfrom his head\n\ndown to his shoes\n\n7.\n\nthe most horrible thing\n\ni could think of\n\nwas part of me being\n\nwhat ejaculated out of the\n\nend of his\n\nstupid penis\n\n8.\n\ndon’t be a whore\n\ntonight\n\nbecause i got\n\nnothing left\n\ni’m spent\n\ni’m really exhausted\n\ntoo much sex\n\nand too much stuff\n\n9.\n\ni could start\n\nknocking cans from the shelves and\n\nalso rolls of towels, toilet paper,\n\nsilver foil,\n\ni could throw oranges, bananas, tomatoes\n\nthrough the air, i could take cans of\n\nbeer from the refrigerated section and\n\nstart gulping them\n\n10.\n\nthey keep making them\n\nand everybody keeps buying them\n\nand wearing them\n\nand the faces are just like\n\nthe american flag shirt\n\n11.\n\nour words\n\nour passion that flows\n\nlike beer\n\nmisery chains\n\nthunder rain\n\n12.\n\nthack thack thack thack\n\nand then i hear birds\n\nand thack thack thack\n\nand i go to bed\n\n13.\n\ngod damn, it’s almost like being shot in the ass\n\n14.\n\non his bed made for kings\n\non his toilet made out of gold\n\n15.\n\ni’ll bet you sucked your mother’s nipples until you were\n\ntwelve years old\n\n16.\n\nif here by now then bad place be\n\ntrouble time for you\n\nwhen heat comes\n\n17.\n\nhave you hugged your rat today?\n\nsuddenly i have the urge to urinate\n\n18.\n\nwe’re gonna do all the drugs\n\nand then we’re gonna try\n\nto fix the lights\n\n19.\n\nbut she still looked good to me, she still looked good\n\nand all thanks to an ugly horse\n\n20.\n\nwhen i am feeling\n\nlow\n\nall i have to do is\n\nwatch my cats\n\nand my\n\ncourage\n\nreturns\n\ni study these\n\ncreatures\n\nthey are my\n\nteachers"
