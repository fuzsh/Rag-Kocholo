        "text": "By Abel Debritto.\n\nHappy accidents\n\nI began researching into Charles Bukowski’s work back in 2007. A couple of years later, I vividly remember talking to one of my Ph.D.’s committee members. He had written his dissertation on Moby Dick in 1992, and fifteen years down the road he was still publishing pieces about that book and Melville. I was quite naïve on academic grounds, and taking that information in was not easy. How could anyone spend fifteen years of their lives working on the same subject? Was there anything left to say? Were there any stones unturned? Really?\n\nReally. There I was, fifteen years later, still researching into Bukowski’s work. True, most research was done on and off, between trips, break-ups, bringing up kids, moving to new places, taking up new jobs, and so on. The usual. It was never my mainstay, but it was always a clear, unavoidable presence. It was kind of a magical breeding ground that kept producing books, articles, chapbooks, talks, lovers, and who knows what else. A godsend for sure. And, oh, yes, there was a bio-bibliography, too. A mammoth of a project that I had been working on for quite some time. A book full of insightful stories and tons of boring data that it was almost impossible to finish off. Blame it on Bukowski’s prolific nature.\n\nAfter we were allowed to somewhat resume our lives after the pandemic, I felt it was one of those “now or never” moments. It was either pushing that project to its conclusion right away or pushing daisies before long. Long hours at night, insane weekends hunching over the laptop, and, then, bam!, all of a sudden it was done. Or so I thought. I had already given up on finding Bukowski’s two most elusive items, Write and the pro-Nazi letters he had published in right-wing newspapers in the early 1940s. A cursory search in mid-2023, though, hit the jackpot quite unexpectedly. For a minute, I couldn’t quite believe my eyes. Were the letters I was reading by the same Bukowski I had been working on for some fifteen years? Or was it one of those mirages that researchers stumble upon at the end of a long, uneventful day — drained and blurry-eyed?\n\nThing is, I gasped in astonishment. I realized that I had been chasing the wrong newspaper for more than ten years! Whenever I talked to anyone about the infamous pro-Nazi letters, I was told I should double-check old issues of the Los Angeles Examiner. And that I did. I spent countless hours at the Los Angeles Public Library going through hundreds of microfilm reels, getting dizzier by the minute. After a couple of hours, each new reel was just a huge blot of distorted ink. Names and places became impossible puzzles. I took short breaks, went out, walked around the block, and came back only to get dizzy again. Out once again. In for the umpteenth time. No luck at all. In the editorial page, next to columns by Helen Rowland, Edwin C. Hill and Elsie Robinson, I triple-checked dozens and dozens of “Editor’s Mail Box” columns to no avail. No Bukowski whatsoever.\n\nAbout that time, I mentioned the letters to Bukowski’s long-time editor John Martin, and he said, “I think Bukowski was dreaming. I doubt that such published letters exist.” I kind of gave up on that search. Too many dead-ends. It was becoming an unhealthy obsession. I closed that door and moved on. Shortly after that, I began working in the Digital Humanities. I digitized hundreds of periodicals, including the very early issues of Poetry magazine. It was fun to see Ezra Pound being published all over the place, much like Bukowski decades later. I became familiar with OCR, metadata, and tagging. Massive digitization projects began to take place in libraries all across the country. Things that up to then required expensive trips were suddenly a click away. Sometime in mid-2023, while putting the finishing touches to my never-ending Bukowski bio-bibliography, I took a deep breath and decided to give it a shot again. That’s the nature of researchers. They never ever throw in the towel, much to the chagrin of everyone and anyone around.\n\nI double-checked all the major databases: Proquest, EBSCO, Newsbank, JSTOR, you name it. Nothing. I tried the Internet Archives, with thousands of newly digitized pages every day. Not a peep. Hours and hours wasted away. No wonder those letters were the Holy Grail. Still, biographer Howard Sounes had claimed that Bukowski “wrote to newspapers expressing his extreme views”, and author Barry Miles had concluded that Bukowski “wrote letters supporting Hitler to the Los Angeles Examiner”. They must be real, then, I thought. Surprisingly, when asked about those letters, Sounes said that “I don’t think I ever saw Bukowski’s Nazi letters, rather I was taking his word — in his other writings and in his interviews — for having written them”, while Miles admitted that “I certainly never saw the papers themselves”. Maybe it was a mirage, after all.\n\nAccidents do happen, though. As luck would have it, I came across a relatively tiny database with a large number of Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Herald Examiner issues. A perfunctory search yielded no results at all. I remembered that Bukowski’s father was mad at him for signing his piece as “Henry Bukowski” in a 1940 Los Angeles Collegian issue, his first known publication ever. I tried several variations of the Bukowski name and, lo and behold, there they were, three letters by a “Henry C. Bukowski, Jr.” I clicked on them and sure enough those were the elusive letters Bukowski had mentioned in interviews and poems, lying dormant for God knows how long in that small database no one had ever heard of.\n\nFunnily enough, when I took a close look at the front cover of those three issues, I couldn’t help but notice they were not Los Angeles Examiner nor Los Angeles Herald Examiner, even though I was positive that’s how they were called in the database. I retraced my steps and clicked again on those Los Angeles Examiner issues, only to be taken to yet another newspaper called Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express. But of course! A classic tagging mistake! All the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express issues had been mislabeled Los Angeles Examiner. The only way to find those letters was by accident. Blame it on the Digital Humanities’ race to digitize all books known to mankind in the blink of an eye. That, and sketchy OCR at best were the main culprits of many unproductive hours in front of the computer. And how naïve of me to think that Bukowski would have submitted his letters to Los Angeles Examiner, which was the morning edition of the paper. He tried the evening edition, when he was sober enough to read it. Funny how these things make perfect sense in retrospect only.\n\nIt all had been worth the effort. Those controversial letters were no longer some sort of mythical creature mockingly teasing me in the distance, putting my patience to the test. They were right there up for grabs, waiting to be scrutinized, analyzed, and dissected. Oh, the joys ahead!\n\nLet’s have some fun\n\nBut first things first. Although claims about those Nazi sympathies had been made by Sounes in 1998, Miles in 2005, and, above all, Ben Pleasants in his Visceral Bukowski in 2004 — all of them when Bukowski was long gone — the hard truth is that the first person to happily spread the gospel was none other than Bukowski himself. In interviews, poems, stories, and novels, Bukowski didn’t shy away from talking about what he called the “Nazi trip,” especially in the infamous Pleasants tapes — I say infamous because when Pleasants was attacked for proclaiming Bukowski was a Nazi at core, he always maintained that everything he said was sourced from the tapes he recorded in the mid-to-late 1970s, when he was working on a Bukowski biography that never came to fruition. For years, it was thought that Pleasants had made that up and that those tapes were pure fabrication, but after Pleasants passed away in 2013, I was able to track them down and, indeed, I could hear Bukowski droning on and on about his Nazi persona.\n\nWhat Pleasants failed to mention was that it was all said in jest. In the tapes, Bukowski is very clear about that. His Nazi trip was a giant put-on, as simple as that. Perhaps, in a perverse sort of way, it was just another instance of his self-deprecating humor. Pleasants, who had been researching into Bukowski’s work as early as 1970, was fully aware of Bukowski’s public statements. And yet, what Bukowski remembered half-jokingly in those tapes and elsewhere, Pleasants turned into radical, deeply-rooted Nazi beliefs. Striking, to say the least. Sometimes I couldn’t help but wonder if it was just his personal vendetta over the canceled biography. It didn’t help matters that Bukowski wrote a short-story in 1978 where he made fun of Pleasants’ overbearing, self-centered demeanour.\n\nOther than the occasional brief reference, there are no known records of Bukowski discussing Nazism before the 1970s. The first time he elaborated on the subject was in an interview published in Stonecloud magazine in 1972: “I pretended I was a Nazi out of sheer boredom […] I remember one time I ended up in this place in Glendale in a big, dark cellar. We all stood up and saluted the flag, and this guy got up very seriously and said how we were going to destroy communism. But I wasn’t one of them; it was just a show […] Boyd Cole [president of L.A. City College] came up and said ‘Hey, Bukowski, I don’t believe in what you’re preaching, but let me tell you something: if you guys win, I’ll come over to your side.’ I told him, ‘Boyd, you’re a hunk of shit, get away from me.’” Years later, Bukowski recounted again this encounter with president Cole in Ham on Rye.\n\nIn the short-story “Politics,” written in December 1972, Bukowski expressed a similar view: “At L.A. City College just before World War II, I posed as a Nazi. I hardly knew Hitler from Hercules and cared less […] I didn’t even bother to read up on Adolf, I simply spouted anything that I felt was evil or maniacal […] I played Nazi for some time longer, while caring for neither the Nazis nor the Communists nor the Americans.” In 1963, the little magazine The Outsider had given Bukowski the “Outsider of the Year” award, and almost a decade later he still seemed to be on the fringes of pretty much everything, especially politics.\n\nIn one of the Pleasants tapes, recorded in 1976, Bukowski admitted that he even had some followers; they all were “weak, fucked-up” college students who, much like his high-school friend “Baldy,” were drawn to his pseudo-Nazi antics. Bukowski went on to explain that they played Russian roulette with a real gun. They all solemnly pledged alliance to the American flag, having every intention of saving their country from communism, although Bukowski “did not care” at all — I soon realized the Pleasants tapes were a treasure trove. True, Pleasants cunningly twisted what Bukowski said in those tapes to fit his own narrative, making some contentions that sounded downright fanciful to me. For instance, he quoted Bukowski as saying that he read the Los Angeles Examiner because William Randolph Hearst published Hitler and Mussolini, though Hearst fired Hitler because he missed his deadlines. Another Pleasants whopper, I thought. How could anyone fire Hitler? But historian and author David Nasaw set me straight: “Hearst tried Hitler and Mussolini and many other world leaders, and fired them when they didn’t deliver.” I stood corrected, and from then on, I gave Pleasants the benefit of the doubt, always triple-checking his claims.\n\nIn what many consider his best novel, Ham on Rye (1982), Bukowski also commented on his longing for his homeland all the while blaming his college instructors for his Nazi inclinations: “Having been born in Germany, there was a natural loyalty and I didn’t like to see the whole German nation, the people, depicted everywhere as monsters and idiots […] I wasn’t a nazi by temperament or choice; the teachers more or less forced it on me by being so much alike and thinking so much alike and with their anti-German prejudice.” Again, much like in interviews and short stories, Bukowski chose to stand apart from those who did as told, recalling the title of one of his earliest chapbooks, Run With the Hunted (1962). Bukowski’s recollection was corroborated by historian Kathryn Olmsted: “Most teachers in 1941 were probably anti-Nazi. At that point, Hitler was waging war against most of the democracies of Europe.” Nasaw, however, painted a slightly different picture: “I somehow doubt that all the teachers were left-wing and anti-German. In 1940-41, Americans generally hated and feared Hitler, but they weren’t ready to go to war against him.” Anti-interventionism seemed to be standard fare before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941.\n\nIn late 1991, when Bukowski was 71, he wrote “What Will the Neighbors Think?”, a poem where he summed up most of the Nazi-related notions he had already discussed in his work, stressing he backed “unpopular causes” in his letters to conservative newspapers. Scrounging drinks off his right-wing acolytes, Bukowski was able to fool them into believing he was a genuine Nazi sympathizer. This was the poem that Sounes and Miles used as a source for their claims, skipping over previous instances where Bukowski had made it abundantly clear it all was a complete farce. Despite the pro-Nazi accusations by Sounes, Miles, and Pleasants, I was ready to believe Bukowski. After many years of research, I knew he was a self-mythologizing creature who loved being controversial. Causing a stir by championing ideas that today are considered non-politically correct was one of his fortes. The jury was no longer out for me, all charges were unsubstantiated and were unceremoniously dropped.\n\nAnd then I met Norma Almquist. We were both doing research at The Huntington Library. Almquist had published a few Bukowski poems in Ante, a little magazine she had co-edited in the 1960s. While having lunch in a quiet, shadowy spot near the gardens, she confided to me that she had studied with Bukowski at Los Angeles City College. She told me that he always sat in the back row, frowning, never mingling with anyone in the classroom. In typical Bukowski fashion, I thought. And then she dropped the bomb on me: “He was silently aggressive, wore a swastika on his jacket sleeve. Since World War II had already started, we all perceived the Nazi swastika as a slap in the face. I doubt that he sympathized with the Nazi propaganda. I think he wore the swastika on his jacket only to be noticed.” Although unverifiable, Almquist’s narrative and timing were solid: Bukowski’s provocative nature was already taking shape. Almquist was almost 90 years old at the time, so I took her words with the proverbial grain of salt, keeping in mind she had repeatedly stressed it was an act on Bukowski’s end.\n\nIt did cross my mind that Bukowski could have actually expressed his extreme views supporting Hitler in the early 1940s only to change his mind in the 1970s, saying it all was a joke. Disguising his youth eccentricities under the veil of black humor seemed to be the smartest way out. The only way to figure that out was by delving into the three letters I’d unearthed quite by accident.\n\nCounting to ten\n\nAmongst the many letters published in the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express by recurrent readers such as Charles Geduld, Michael Crowley, Albert Burki, “A Mother,” “A Taxpayer,” and a “Loyal American,” I came across those three letters by a very young Bukowski. Printed in 1941 before the attack on Pearl Harbor, they were titled by the editors “A Modern Fable,” “Question and Answer,” and “What Worries Him.” The first two letters were published when Bukowski was still attending L.A. City College and living with his parents, and the third one came out a few months after he dropped out of college and shortly before he began what he called his years “on the bum.”\n\nIn “A Modern Fable,” the 20-year-old Bukowski shows his dissatisfaction with Bear Sammy, Bear Limey, and Bear Heinie, especially with the way Bear Sammy mistreats Bear Heinie. After all, Bukowski was born in Germany and he always felt a tinge of nostalgia for his homeland. As biographer David Calonne noted after reading the letters for the first time, Bukowski “must have had some pro-German feelings because of his ancestry.” All three bears are depicted as devilish creatures, but Bear Heinie seems to be the lesser of those three evils. Even so, as Calonne elaborated, “Bukowski appears to be basically arguing for non-intervention because all three ‘bears’ have their hands dirty.” So much so that Bukowski himself acknowledges the bears are all “fighting over the colony porridge” all the while pretending to save Democracy.\n\nInterestingly, Bukowski’s first short-story was published in Whit Burnett’s Story magazine in 1944, but this “unfinished fairy tale”, as Bukowski calls it, was written in early 1941 as a fable of sorts and it definitely reads like a short story. Bukowski was aware of that, noting at the end of the letter that “the number of people crying for war against Hitler is growing larger every day. This tale is dedicated to them and is written in this childish form because if they are foolish enough to fall for the same wile twice, they are surely too simple to understand anything else.” If anything, this first letter in the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express shows that his knack for writing was already in the works.\n\n“Question and Answer” is a short, straightforward letter where Bukowski wonders about the contradictions of war, blaming them on the USA administration. “A strange case, my friends, of eating your cake and having it too,” he wryly concludes the second letter. In the final letter, “What Worries Him,” Bukowski begins by saying “I’m not half as worried about Hitler coming over here as I am about us going over there,” this time putting President Franklin D. Roosevelt down for not keeping his pre-electoral promises. Not mincing his words, he ironically settles the issue by claiming that Roosevelt’s “eight points of peace” are actually “eight causes to count to 10” because they could cause “future wars” instead of solving the issues at hand.\n\nThe sceptical in me reread the letters several times, trying to find arguments supporting Hitler’s regime. Both the Los Angeles Examiner and the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express were conservative newspapers in the 1940s, boycotted by many liberals. As Olmsted told me, those “populist ultra-nationalist” newspapers were clearly “anti-intervention, anti-New Deal, and anti-FDR.” Bukowski did not have to express his views in disguise, he had the chance to say what he actually thought, and these letters reflect as much. His anti-interventionist stance couldn’t be any more eloquent. Bukowski was “against the war and not really for any side of the war. He was pro-Germany culturally, but basically anti-war,” Calonne concluded. Poet S.A. Griffin fully agreed with this view: “Bukowski could no doubt be quietly split in his loyalties to both America and Germany,” further elaborating that Bukowski “was prime draft material having a ROTC background. Maybe he was feeling some fear about having to serve, pick up a gun and defend the country … He was obviously paying attention and deeply concerned. He was speaking very loudly to empire building and ongoing western colonization.” Despite the pro-Nazi accusations, the German ties did not turn Bukowski into a Hitler devotee.\n\nIndeed, as biographer Neeli Cherkovski noted, “Hank pretended to be pro-Nazi as WWII began, but it was only pretence with his friends. He certainly didn’t believe in any of the right-wing stuff coming out before, during or after the war. He didn’t have an antisemitic bone in his body.” Not only that, author Jeff Weddle categorically denied any Nazi inclinations in these letters: “He’s not endorsing Hitler, fascism, or genocide, which I think some extreme Buk haters might want to pin on him.” So much for Bukowski the Nazi sympathizer.\n\nHistorians couldn’t agree more. Both Olmsted and Nasaw didn’t find a hint of Nazism in these letters, claiming Bukowski’s isolationism was not even radical at the time. Olmsted said that the letters were in line with “Hearst’s general editorial policy. Most Hearst readers would be very familiar with these sentiments,” while Nasaw concluded that the letters were not “pro-Nazi, but simply anti-interventionist, and anti-British … We had no business fighting war in Europe, to save the British Empire. And that fighting this war, either by supporting the British or by going into the war directly, would succeed only in wrecking the economy. The letters are simply anti-war.” Bukowski was the product of an American culture where millions of his fellow countrymen openly expressed their pro-isolationist take on war. It definitely was not a position unique to him, especially because the horrors of WWI were still fresh in the world’s psyche. “What Bukowski said in those letters,” Olmsted argued, “would not be considered extreme for the time. There’s a big difference between saying the US should not enter the war and saying that the Nazis were right.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Bukowski, the ever-self-mythologizing creature, exaggerated his views five decades after the fact in the poem “What Will the Neighbors Think?” Although there’s a good chance that he wrote these letters in 1941 to be heard and read — much like he did in his work for the rest of his life — his nonconformist attitude was actually quite common before Pearl Harbor. Calling his parents “deluded patriotic fools” fifty years later, glorifying the supposed unpopularity of his beliefs in the 1940s, pointed in the same direction: he was aggrandizing in retrospect the hostile reaction towards those letters. For the young Bukowski, upsetting his parents was as imperative as the compulsion to write. The older Bukowski was only too happy to fictionalize those youth exploits.\n\nUnless further letters turn up showing solid evidence of Bukowski’s commitment to the Nazi cause, all claims in that regard are no longer credible and should be put to rest. After years of research, second-guessing myself and everyone else in the process, I couldn’t help but think that Bukowski was the smartest guy around. While most people took his words as if written in stone, either idolizing him or throwing their arms up in horror, he was simply having a good time, unencumbered by all that brouhaha. If anything, he was amused by the trail of confusion he had caused in the first place by claiming he pretended to be a Nazi in college. In the Pleasants tapes, you can hear him laughing out loud while talking about the Nazi trip. He was poking fun at himself, probably hoping no one would take him too seriously.\n\nIt is about time."
