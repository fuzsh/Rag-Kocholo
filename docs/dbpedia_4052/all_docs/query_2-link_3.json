He was the only one in Venice at the time with a studio, I believe. I grew up next door in Santa Monica, and worked at American International Pictures (AIP) cleaning up sometimes after school. The studio was nicknamed \"The Lumberyard,\" because that's what it was before Corman took over the property. Plus, Roger was *definitely* the only one in Venice with a screening room staffed with a bartender. I vacuumed that floor, and stole Cokes from that bar refrigerator, more than a few times. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've lived here all my life and I can't figure another studio/screening room in Venice back then. It was just a short ride north from Marina Del Rey.\n\nIt's different now, of course. No \"studios,\" but plush screening rooms are everywhere.\n\ngood guess, but nope.\n\nIF this has been a real person in Bukowskis life, it had to be someone from the 40s or at least very early 50s.\n\nWe 'know', that the question Tully asks in the movie: \"Who are you?\" was originally asked by Caresse Crosby. So obviously he has merged different persons into one here. Still it makes no sense at all to pick Liza. sorry.\n\nI think you're mixing up his life and his works roni.\n\nIF you think he lived (briefly) with a high powered executive (who shared her place in Hollywood with another high powered female) in the 40s then I'm going to disagree. Barfly was a mixture of various periods of Bukowski's life and some stuff he made up!\n\nYes, the Tully character in Barfly is a composite but there in the novel Hollywood he's describing Liza Williams, even their trip to Catalina. So for your Hollywood list, Liza is right.\n\n[...] Barfly was a mixture of various periods [...]\n\nI agree on this. But it's definitely Not a mixture of periods throughout his Whole life.\n\nHe merged together his Philly-years with his time, when he was with Jane. That's a wide span, I admit. We're talking about a decade.\n\nNow, Liza Williams falls into a totally different time and period of his life. All the circumstances were different. Plus: I don't see him (throughout the whole screenplay) to intermix ANY other time of his life with the mentioned above.\n\nLiza Williams?\n\nThe character would work, yes.\n\nThe happenings would work, yes.\n\nIt just doesn't fit into the time he's capturing in that screenplay.\n\np.s.:\n\nI think you're mixing up his life and his works\n\nI sure am not. I know that much about literature (and you know that I know).\n\nEvidence shows, that the whole novel 'Hollywood' is based on the very facts. That's what all this searching for the 'real' names is about. We sure can assume, that he was making up what he stated in 'Hollywood' about the character of 'Tully'. Possible. I'm not claiming, that there IS/WAS a real person like her, but IF there was, it can not possibly be Liza Williams\n\nhey roni, I'm not trying to suggest that you don't know what I know you know, you know?\n\nBut do you really believe that it is more likely that he had a relationship with a real-life Tully in the 40s than that he simply created that character for Barfly using elements from his Women period?\n\nWhat I think you are discounting is this: - in my opinion there is a difference in the ratio of fiction to fact between Barfly and Hollywood.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that Tully in Barfly and Tully in Hollywood are not exactly the same. Tully is a character in Barfly but in Hollywood he only uses Tully to refer to the woman who the character is (partly) based upon.\n\nI think that for Barfly, Bukowski took his experience of being published as a young man in Portfolio and expanded it out to include an intimate encounter with a successful female business woman. I don't believe he had that sort of relationship with Caresse Crosby!!\n\nThe only mention of 'Tully' in Hollywood is where Bukowski is clearly describing the elements of his relationship with Liza Williams which were transposed to the character in Barfly.\n\nI'm going cross-eyed... Even Bukowski seems to get himself tied up in Hollywood with his references to himself as the scriptwriter and his other self as the character...\n\nPeace\n\nON THE CHARACTER OF 'TULLY' IN 'BARFLY' AND 'HOLLYWOOD'\n\nyep hanksolo. That's not an easy nut to crack.\n\n(and right now, I'm beyond real rational thought due to C2H5OH, so sorry if I'll make obvious mistakes in the logic structure of my following post,)\n\ndo you really believe that it is more likely that he had a relationship with a real-life Tully in the 40s than that he simply created that character for Barfly using elements from his Women period?\n\nyes, I do.\n\nThe reason: throughout the whole novel we don't have a single hint that he as the author has been doing this, (Either in the screenplay Nor in the novel).\n\nI'd admit, it would be Very possible, that he used the later experience with Liza in the screenplay. But the way he descripes Tully in 'Hollywood' - and that's what we're talking about - kills that idea. There's no other part in that novel (to my knowledge) that would have been written this way. He usually sticks to the facts there and only changes names or small issues.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that Tully in Barfly and Tully in Hollywood are not exactly the same. [...] there is a difference in the ratio of fiction to fact between Barfly and Hollywood.\n\nWe agree here and we know it.\n\nWhat we have as facts about the novel 'Hollywood' are these:\n\n- There are many happenings in the novel, that took place in real life. (I don't know which would NOT.)\n\n- There are a lot of characters in the novel, that represent an actual, individual person in real life. (Most of them)\n\n- Inside the novel he's usually claiming that what he described had really happened. As far as we know, that usually is right.\n\n- In chapter 41 (p.207) he claims that the screenplay-character of 'Tully' was based on an actual person.\n\nThe Tully-character in the screenplay may have been enriched by experiences with Liza, as the famous quotation of Crosby was put in the mouth of that character. Sure. But at the moment in chapt. 41 of Hollywood, when he claims, that there had been a real person, he was talking about, we need to take that serious.\n\nThat's all, I guess.\n\nFor now."
