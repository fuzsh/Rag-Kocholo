But from 1944-1947, he lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked at Fairmount Motors (1501 Fairmount St), the Nabisco plant (1325 West Glenwood Ave), and at the Snap-On Tool warehouse (1601 Fairmount Ave). While in Philadelphia, Bukowski lived at a variety of North Philly and Fairmount addresses, including: 3545 N Camac St, 1623 Green St, 603 N. 17th St, and 2020 Mt. Vernon St. On July 22, 1944, with World War II raging, 23-year-old Charles Bukowski was arrested by F.B.I. agents in Philadelphia on suspicion of draft evasion. The United States was then at war with Germany and many Germans and German-Americans in the U.S. were suspected of disloyalty—and Bukowski’s background troubled the U.S. authorities. (Bukowski was born in Andernach, Germany, on August 16, 1920, and emigrated with his parents to the U.S. on April 29, 1923.) After his arrest, Bukowski was held for 17 days in Philadelphia’s Moyamensing Prison. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a Selective Service Classification of 4-F (unfit for military service).

The building was designed by Samuel Brian Baylinson in 1929, and in 2015 the city’s Historic Commission agreed to list the building in the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places for its distinctive Art Deco architecture.
