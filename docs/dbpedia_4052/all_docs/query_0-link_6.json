        "text": "My right hand looked small and nervous as it knocked on the red front door. A closed peephole stared back at me. My heart raced as I loudly knocked twice more and asked if anyone was home. The air was still as my voice echoed in the silent doorway. No answer. I glanced around the hillside property peeking into the poolside courtyard and lush gardens hoping to spot someone. Even though there were two cars parked, the house appeared empty. Holding the white envelope in my hands, I placed it at the foot of the door propping it up against a pair of green rubber gardening shoes. “Who is it?” asked a woman from deep inside the house. I recognized her voice from all the interviews I had watched. It was her and she was home. Linda Lee Bukowski (formerly Linda Lee Beighle), the woman who braved the longest romance with one of America’s greatest writers, stood on the other side of the door. I wondered if she would open it. “I’m sorry, but I’m not coming to the door,” she said, interrupting my introduction and answering my question. I told her I was leaving an envelope from my editor outside in an effort to make her curious and said goodbye. I walked down the sloped driveway back to my car hopeful she would change her mind. If she wouldn’t talk to me, I would go find her husband.\n\nThe Immortal Bukowski\n\n“How do you spell that again?” asked the cheerful blonde woman in a teal blouse sitting at a large empty wooden desk. “B-u-k-o-w-s-k-i,” I spelled studying her green and white business cards stacked neatly in their holder. “First name?” she asked. “Charles. Henry Charles,” I replied. “Oh yeah, there he is. Lot 875, Space 1. Ocean View,” she said while grabbing a map of the hillside memorial park and highlighting the tiny square space of 875 in neon yellow. Surrounded by hundreds of other interments, the black and neon number sat dead center. “C’mon, I’ll show you where it is. It’s going to be an adventure. It always is, going to his,” she stood up, motioning me to follow.\n\nI almost forgot I was in a cemetery until I drove past the coffin loading dock. A young man wearing a sky blue button-down shirt and a red silk tie draped the shiny caskets in freshly pressed linens. I slowed down near a large pine tree where a small service was ending as families hugged and were swept away in black sedans.\n\nThe blonde got out of the Green Hills Memorial Park van scanning the ground while quickly zigzagging her way through the flowers and headstones. “It’s around here somewhere,” she muttered while circling the graves. Finding the black granite headstone first about three feet away, I inched my way over to Bukowski’s final resting place. “Oh yeah, the one with all the cigarette butts. Well, I’ll leave you to it,” chirped the blonde as she marched back to her office post. A groundskeeper nearby finished stacking white folding chairs and began breaking down a large green tent. Someone else had been put six feet under.\n\n“Henry Charles Bukowski Jr. Hank. Don’t try,” read the engraved font above the dates 1920 and 1994 hyphenated by a symbol of a boxer in an orthodox stance. The gravesite grass was destroyed where many feet had stood before the sometimes profane and profligate poet who succumbed to the perils of leukemia on March 9, 1994. Paying their respects in puffs of smoke and swigs of beer, visitors had scattered relics from Bukowski’s past around the ledger stone. Beer caps, wine corks and guitar picks were left behind as grassy altar offerings to the man who glorified his squalid life.\n\nA sharp sting on my ankle disrupted my thoughts. Ants marched frenetically tracing the outlines of each letter of his name while a small pill-bug tackled the obstacle course of grief debris. The bugs bothered me. They reminded me of decay, the kind that Bukowski would have written about from inside one his roach-infested apartments. In his last novel, Pulp, completed at the age of 73 and published the year of his death, Bukowski wrote in a self-fulfilling prophetic form, saying, “I’m not dead yet, just in a state of rapid decay, who isn’t?” Bukowski was now in fact dead, but his works and legacy were not.\n\nA crinkled love note with sloppy pink hearts and the letters “R.I.P.” was stuffed into the in-ground cemetery flower vase. The Los Angeles postman turned prolific poet now had his own afterlife mailbox where he collected his eternal correspondence. While debating the consequences of reading Bukowski’s mail, I noticed an empty crumpled box of Marlboro Blend No. 27 cigarettes advertising the words “Smooth. Rich. Mellow.”\n\nBukowski was smooth with words, rich in his later years, but never really characterized as mellow. Infamous for boozing, betting, and brawling, Bukowski was an outlaw and a mythic barstool bard who lived on the margins of society.\n\nBefore San Pedro\n\nHeinrich Karl Bukowski, the German-born American poet and author who became known as Charles Bukowski, would have turned 95-years-old this coming August 16. First published at the age of 24, Bukowski is hailed as one of America’s greatest contemporary authors writing more than 1,000 poems, 32 books of poetry, four novels, and five collections of short stories. Bukowski’s gritty and offensive prose first became popular with his column “Notes of a Dirty Old Man” in the underground literary scene during the 1960s.\n\nDiscovered by his future publisher John Martin, also the best man at his second and final wedding, Martin started Black Sparrow Press just to keep Bukowski at the typewriter. Working mostly on-and-off as a filing clerk for the United States Post Office, Bukowski spent his free time writing, bellying up at bars around East Hollywood, or gambling at various Southern California racetracks. Venerated as the vulgar gutter king of Los Angeles, Bukowski’s works celebrate the seedy bars and the kitchen-sink moments of life, while unapologetically writing about the bleak and despairing nature of the human experience. His unpolished and sometimes graphic accounts chronicle his own blue-collar memories on the drudgery of life.\n\nBlurring the lines of reality between his alter ego and semi-autobiographical character Henry Chinaski, Bukowski’s terse writing and poignant stories reflect his own hardbitten life. Traumatized from relentless abuse by his father, Bukowski understood the pain of suffering, remembering his childhood residence as “the house of horrors.” Deeply tormented by his past, he often found consolation in the anesthetics of alcohol. Bukowski was a drifter and often depicted as a ferocious womanizer, yet he demonstrated unrivaled discipline and a fervent passion for writing despite decades of hardship. Life changed though in 1978 when he and then-girlfriend Linda left his seamy friends and rowdy nights behind, relocating to San Pedro. Spending the next 15 years in his harbor-view home, Bukowski would go on to publish some of his greatest works, including Hot Water Music (1983), Hollywood (1989), and the screenplay for Barfly (1987). As part of my quixotic quest to separate fact from fiction, I needed to know more about the real-life Bukowski.\n\nDeconstructing the Poet\n\nI had heard many rumors about Bukowski around San Pedro as everyone seemed to have their own Bukowski story. I decided to meet with Jerry Gusha, former owner of Sixth Street’s famed Williams’ Book Store. As I drove to meet Gusha at the Korean Friendship Bell, the harbor had vanished in the morning haze reminding me of when Bukowski said, “Love is like the fog that burns with the first daylight of reality.” Bukowski had a line for everything.\n\nI saw Gusha wearing a green hoodie from the parking lot. “I haven’t been here in years,” smiled the grey-haired former bookstore owner. Gusha motioned towards the ocean as I followed asking about Bukowski.\n\n“He came in quite a bit and would sign our books and then quietly leave. I never knew how famous he was until one day a camera crew showed up and asked if Bukowski had ever been in the store. We treated him like anyone else. He didn’t like people fawning over him, well except Sean Penn. I remember seeing his limo once or twice,” laughed Gusha.\n\nWorking for his mother, Anne, Gusha recalled how she invited Bukowski to join the San Pedro Library Local Authors event, to which Bukowski declined responding, “If you had dancing girls and wine, then maybe.”\n\nRemembering Bukowski’s craggy face, Gusha added, “It was a face that said he had a hard life… and I guess he did.” Suffering from a violent form of acne causing disfigurement and embarrassment in his early years, Bukowski often referred to himself as a “ravaged lion.” In Ham on Rye, one of his notable works published in 1982, Bukowski remembers watching his Senior Prom rather than attending. “Then I caught a glimpse of my reflection staring in at them — boils and scars on my face, my ragged shirt. I was like some jungle animal drawn to the light and looking in… As I watched them I said to myself, someday my dance will begin. When that day comes I will have something they don’t have.” True to his promise, Bukowski became royalty in the literature kingdom trademarking his animal lifestyle.\n\nIt had been a few days since I tracked down Linda, and with no word yet I called Bukowski’s publisher, Martin. It had been 21 years since Bukowski passed and almost 50 years since they first met in 1965, but Martin still recalled his daily routine as if it were yesterday. “Bukowski would get up around 8 a.m., have breakfast, read the paper, and go to the racetrack. Whether it was Hollywood Park or Santa Anita, he would leave early because he wanted to avoid the crowds. He’d come home, shower and relax and then have dinner. He would go upstairs around 9 p.m. and then write until 1 a.m. almost every night of his life.”\n\nI asked how San Pedro changed Bukowski. “It was a perfect choice. When he lived in Hollywood, the street people would see the light in his window and knock on the door. Three or four hookers would come in and chat with him and he didn’t like it. He moved to San Pedro so he could have his nights to himself, upstairs away from everybody with more time and space to do his writing,” answered Martin.\n\nBukowski went on to mention the port town in nearly 30 poems. He and Linda were regulars at many local San Pedro restaurants, especially Senfuku and Nam’s Red Door Vietnamese. Martin told me that it was the first time Bukowski had lived in a house since the 1940s with his parents and that he loved San Pedro. “He was very happy every day that he lived in that [San Pedro] house. He loved to sit and watch the ships in the harbor,” remembered Martin.\n\n“He could be outrageous, but he was never like that with me or when I was in the room. He really was a perfect gentleman; he had no desire to hurt people’s feelings. He was the most honest man I had ever known. He’s the most truthful man I’ve ever known. He’s one of the nicest men I’ve ever known,” explained Martin, his voice growing sad missing his friend.\n\nHe told me that both Linda and San Pedro added years to Bukowski’s life. He recalled when Bukowski first got sick and Sean Penn took him to a hospital in Beverly Hills where doctors were unable to make a diagnosis. Thankfully, an unexpected visit to a San Pedro veterinary clinic for his cat revealed Bukowski had symptoms of tuberculosis. “Beverly Hills doctors never saw tuberculosis. It’s a disease of the poor,” laughed Martin. San Pedro seemed to be the message of salvation in Bukowski’s gospel.\n\nThe Bukowski Effect\n\nEveryone that was a Bukowski believer told me to watch Bukowski: Born into This, a documentary by filmmaker John Dullaghan named after Bukowski’s well-known existential poem, “Dinosauria, We.” After watching the film on Netflix, I too was converted and became obsessed. Released and featured at Sundance in 2003, Dullaghan delicately captured the dichotomy of Bukowski’s personality by painstakingly collecting the rawest footage recorded and conducting the most exhaustive interviews of Bukowski’s friends, lovers, and family. Dissecting Bukowski, Dullaghan presented a more sensitive and tender side of the man, a side rarely seen by the public. I emailed Dullaghan to see if he wanted to talk and we scheduled a phone call that day. He told me how he first contacted Linda because he wanted to write Bukowski’s biography, but Linda encouraged him to do a documentary instead. With no previous filmmaking experience, he did it anyways.\n\nDullaghan told me he had spent almost eight years making the film. “I worked hard to understand him and he’s a hard person to understand. He’s very contradictory. On one hand, he had an amazing work ethic and on the other hand he was probably an alcoholic. He could be very loyal and compassionate, but he could also be very angry and violent. He was sort of a study in contrast,” Dullaghan explained.\n\nAcknowledging that people are enchanted by the volcanic, hard-drinking and pessimistic person, Dullaghan wanted to expose the part of Bukowski that stood for truth and integrity. “There’s more depth to him and his artistry and his humanity than a lot of people have written about. He wouldn’t have endured if that’s all he was about,” Dullaghan continued. Even Magnolia Pictures, who distributed the film, insisted on an image of a prostitute on the cover, angering Dullaghan by undermining his efforts to redefine Bukowski. Commenting on Bukowski’s undeniable effect, Dullaghan said, “He touched people in San Pedro. Even those who casually knew him, from the car wash guy to the woman who sold him vitamins, he made an impression on them.” Bukowski said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 1987, “The world has shaped me, and I have shaped what I can.”\n\nLoving Bukowski\n\nFinally, the long awaited word from my editor came that Linda Lee Bukowski would talk. After my editor and I drove up the palm-lined street near Holy Trinity School, we soon found ourselves walking up Bukowski’s driveway. Linda was in the front garden watering her plants. “I see people in my driveway,” she sang warmly while waving the green hose. She crouched down to get a better look at us trying to make eye contact through the holes in the lattice fence. A petite woman with short light auburn hair, Linda had bright copper brown eyes and a contagious smile. Waiting by a single white rosebush as she finished watering, I noticed a dark green Acura Legend with the license plate “Buked” parked in the carport. No doubt, a fitting car model for the literary icon.\n\n“Well, hello there,” Linda smiled opening the door ushering us inside. She admitted she wasn’t used to talking to people because her husband was always the one with the voice. Laughing, she confessed, “I have no belief in the myth built up over him.”\n\nWet from the garden, she apologized for her appearance and welcomed us to make ourselves at home while she changed. It was hard not to hypnotically swoon over their beautiful house filled with artifacts from Bukowski’s life. His track hats worn from their sunny days at the races rested on bookshelves lined with his works in different languages while his original self-portraits and colorful artwork decorated the white walls. We stepped down into their living room with wood panels, vaulted ceilings, and carpet the color of pool table felt green. A hand-painted Valentine’s Day card on canvas from Bukowski to Linda had the words “Will ya?” inside a red and blue outlined heart.\n\nShe came downstairs wearing a long-sleeve grey shirt and patterned black neck scarf and invited us to sit on her plush ruby sofa decorated with Indian pillows. She offered us snacks and water repeatedly even though we declined and granted access to the fridge if we changed our mind. Graceful and loving, I could see two of the many reasons why the man she affectionately called “Hank” loved her. She was so attentive and nurturing, giving me the desire to just hug her each time she laughed.\n\nLinda was 25 years younger than Hank when she first met him at a poetry reading in 1976. She said she wasn’t one of his “literary groupies” and enjoyed a platonic friendship with him for many years. While he was working on his novel, Women, detailing his sexual escapades, she heard the sordid stories first-hand. After his research had ended, they finally came together after being such great friends.\n\nShe teased we could visit “Hank’s room,” which she jokingly called the “potala” after the Tibetan palace of peace and power. A follower of the Dalai Lama, Linda practices yoga and said she eventually got Hank into meditation in his later years. But bringing Bukowski to the place of peace in San Pedro was not an easy task. “He was reluctant to get out of the environment that he was accustomed to, it was a safe place for him in whatever hovel he was living in,” Linda added. “When he moved here, we moved here and that was really a big deal. When he came here it all changed. His whole being expanded,” she reminisced about his metamorphosis.\n\nShe gave us a tour of her exotic garden growing everything from papaya to bamboo. She pointed out a giant tangerine tree covered with orange fruit and said, “It’s dying, but still produces so much.” She showed us the Jacuzzi that Hank would sit in after long days at the tracks. We walked past the pool where Linda taught Hank to swim. She emotionally remembered that day fighting tears, saying, “That was the limit, to see him enjoy himself like a child, which he didn’t get to do when he was a child. He was gleeful.” She had returned innocence to a man who had it stolen from him. She gave him safety, love, and security. All of their pictures showed Hank holding her close and hugging her tight. The way she had breathed life into her garden was the same way she had given new life to her beloved Hank.\n\nWe talked about Hank’s learning curve with new technology, moving from the days he pounded on the typewriter to typing on his first Apple computer. “He loved his typewriters. He called them ‘typers.’ That was his main woman. You had to always be second place,” she laughed remembering the different machines throughout his life. She told us how they even took a computer class together. He also even used to write off wine on his taxes, since it was a necessary lubricant for his creative profession.\n\nI asked her about the “Hank” she knew and loved. She told us how people questioned her for being with such a ‘beastly’ man, and said she would always answer, “He’s one of the most honest and most intelligent human beings I’ve ever met in my life and he’s one of the most loyal human beings.” Honest and loyal, the two exact words Martin and Dullaghan had used to describe Bukowski.\n\n“He was able to survive and that’s what hooks people onto his writing,” signaling that it was time to go upstairs to the writer’s room. We leisurely walked up the white staircase through a photographic timeline of his life and stood outside Hank’s private sanctuary. As she opened the door, she turned on the light to reveal a room with yellow walls left untouched since his passing that sweetly smelled of a musty old library. She powered on his radio still tuned to classical music while lifting the Santa Anita Racetrack towel unveiling the Macintosh Apple IISi where Hank spent his nights typing. Next to it, a large ashtray still filled with his last cigarette butts and an empty bottle of Kirin beer. Movie posters hung on the wall and a glass of dried red wine sat on his bookshelf, along with his wallet that contained his last driver’s license and some cash.\n\nBringing his memories to life, she opened the closet pulling out his white wedding suit and tie and handing over his leather shoes. Walking out on the balcony overlooking the port and Vincent Thomas Bridge, she admired the view while I admired her.\n\n“He was quite productive in this house,” said Linda, referring to the 14 poetry books and novels Bukowski wrote in this very room, the most he’d written in one location.\n\nThe tour continued through various rooms of the house back through the kitchen, down into his archives, each room revealing a different layer to Hank and her plans to convert the property into a museum. We could’ve stayed for hours, but our time was done. As we all hugged goodbye on the doorstep, she thanked us for stopping by, but we were the ones who felt grateful.\n\nI sat in my car overwhelmed by getting to know Linda and exploring Hank’s house. I reached for a tangerine from the orange bag of ripe fruit that Linda had given me. I thought of the dying tree still bearing sweet fruit the same way Bukowski’s works are still being printed. I peeled the tangerine apart enjoying the fragrant citrus mist and juicy mess. I swallowed a large piece of the ripe fruit and remembered what Martin had said to me on the phone, “Bukowski wrote so well about common life, the things we all share, that he will live forever.” He was right. As new generations continue to discover him over and over again, I believed it too, Bukowski will live forever."
