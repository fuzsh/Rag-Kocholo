Even without a scrap of make-up on Ashley Tisdale was looking movie star gorgeous as she made a coffee run on Thursday.

But when the High School Musical star got back to her car in Toluca Lake, California, she realized she had made a mistake.

The 29-year-old had locked her keys in her car and was spotted reaching through a crack in her driver's side window to pry her way back into the vehicle.

Wearing comfy Ugg boots, skin tight leggings and a hooded jumper advertising her husband's band Annie Automatic, the star was looking her dressed down best.

Tying her hair into a high knot, she appeared to have some mascara caked around her eyes from the night before - otherwise she was opting to let her skin breathe.

Meanwhile, the actress said in a recent interview with E! Online that she was too busy for kids right now.

'I have a series coming out in June for TBS, called Buzzy's. And I'm really focused on doing stuff in fashion too. I have a lot of stuff in development there. So kids aren't going to come for a while,' she explained.

Ashley's new husband, rocker Christopher French, was likely to be busy as well with his band, Annie Automatic.

With their wedding having just happened on September 8, the newlyweds have needed time to adjust to each other.

'We wake up every morning and I'm like, 'Hi, husband' just to able to feel somewhat different because I married my best friend and it's been so amazing,' Ashley explained.

As for work, Ashley has indeed been busy in the years following her breakout performance in High School Musical.

The former Sharpay starred in The CW's series, Hellcats, in 2010 and 2011, and she provides the voice for the title character in Hub Network's Sabrina: Secrets Of A Teenage Witch.

In addition to those jobs, Ashley has provided the voice for Candace Flynn in Phineas and Ferb since 2007.

A singer as well as an actress, Ashley has hinted that she might have a third album coming out in the near future.
