        "text": "Despite rumors and many fans’ hopes, Quentin Tarantino has said Kill Bill Vol. 3 isn’t happening.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of the film during an interview with DeMorgen, Tarantino replied, “I don’t see that happening.” Tarantino has limited himself to directing 10 films, and his tenth and final film, The Movie Critic, comes out later this year.\n\nIn other words, there is no room within his self-imposed limit for Kill Bill Vol. 3.\n\nSeveral fans had hoped that a third film would be on the way and that Tarantino would cast Uma Thurman’s daughter Maya Hawke in the potential sequel.\n\nThere’s been plenty of talk about a third film since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and Quentin Tarantino reportedly shared ideas for the story with Uma Thurman a few years ago.\n\nIn 2022, Uma Thurman discussed the possibility of Kill Bill Vol. 3, saying, “There was real thought about it happening” but it wasn’t something “immediately on the horizon.”\n\n“I hate to disappoint people. Everybody wishes it would be the case, but I think it’s not immediately on the horizon,” Thurman said.\n\nInstead, fans can look forward to The Movie Critic, which takes place in California in 1977. In an interview with Deadline, Tarantino said the film “is based on a guy who really lived, but was never really famous, and he used to write movie reviews for a porno rag.”\n\nAs a teenager, one of Tarantino’s jobs was loading porn magazines into a vending machine.\n\n“All the other stuff was too skanky to read but then there was this porno rag that had a really interesting movie page,” Tarantino said.\n\nHe explained that the critic who inspired the film “wrote about mainstream movies and he was the second-string critic. I think he was a very good critic. He was as cynical as hell.”\n\n—\n\nFollow us on Twitter and on Instagram!\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nRelated"
