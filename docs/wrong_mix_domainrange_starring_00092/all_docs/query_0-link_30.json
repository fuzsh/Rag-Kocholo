Produced and released on October 24, 2008, by Walt Disney Pictures, the film is a sequel to Disney Channel Original Movie 2006 television film High School Musical. It was the only film in the series to be released theatrically. Kenny Ortega returned as director and choreographer, as did all six primary actors.\n\nThe sequel follows the main six high school seniors: Troy, Gabriella, Ryan, Sharpay, Chad, and Taylor as they are faced with the challenging prospect of being separated after graduating from high school. Joined by the rest of their East High Wildcat classmates, they stage an elaborate spring musical reflecting their experiences, hopes, and fears about the future.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, though relatively better than the first installment of the series, and, in its first three days of release, Senior Year grossed $50 million in North America and an additional $40 million overseas, setting a new record for the largest opening weekend for a musical film.\n\nIt was followed up by a spin-off, starring Ashley Tisdale. Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure was released direct-to-DVD on April 19, 2011, and premiered on Disney Channel on May 22, 2011.\n\nParodies & Celebrities (Don't delete, & Do Play. but you can add some more)[]\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008)/Born To Race (2011)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008)/Never Back Down (2008)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008)/Awkward.\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/2 Broke Girls\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/2 Guns (2013)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/2 Stupid Dogs\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/3-2-1 Penguins!\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/6Teen\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/10 Things I Hate About You (1999)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/17 Again (2009)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/20th Century Fox\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/27 Dresses (2008)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/64 Zoo Lane\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/101 Dalmatians\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/102 Dalmatians\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/10,000 BC (2008)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/90210\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Bug's Life\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Christmas Carol\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Girl Like Her (2015)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Goofy Movie\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Prayer for the Dying (1987)\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A Troll in Central Park\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year/A.N.T.
