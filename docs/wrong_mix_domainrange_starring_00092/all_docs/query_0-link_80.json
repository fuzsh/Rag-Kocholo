        "text": "December 3, 2007. Toronto. SPLICE, the dark vision of the world of genetic engineering co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali (Paris, je t¹aime,\n\nCube) starring Adrien Brody (The Darjeeling Limited, King Kong, The Pianist), Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead, Secret Life of Words, Don¹t Come\n\nKnocking) and newcomer Delphine Chanéac (Madame Hollywood, Brice de Nice) begins principal photography today, December 3, 2007 and will run until February 29, 2008 in Toronto, Canada. The release is intended for 2009.\n\nSPLICE a Gaumont and Copperheart Entertainment co-production, produced by Steven Hoban of Copperheart Entertainment and executive produced by Sidonie Dumas, Franck Chorot and Christophe Riandee of Gaumont. Guillermo del Toro, Don Murphy and Susan Montford of Angry Bull will also serve as Executive Producers. The screenplay was co-written by Natali, Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor. Cinematography by Tetsuo Nagata (La vie en rose, Paris, je t'aime), production design by Todd Cherniawsky (Ginger Snaps trilogy), costume design by Alex Kavanagh (Repo! The Genetic Opera!, Young People Fucking), and Visual FX by C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures (The Tudors, X-Men, Silent Hill, Resident Evil: Apocalypse) and Special Makeup FX by Oscar-winning KNB FX Group (The Chronicles of Narnia, Sin City, Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2).\n\nClive and Elsa are superstars of the genetic engineering world. They specialize in splicing together DNA from different animals to create fantastical new hybrids. The charismatic couple wants to use human DNA in a new hybrid ­ something that could yield astronomical medical benefits. The pharmaceutical company that funds their research, however, is more interested in exploiting their earlier triumphs for easier, short-term profit. Clive and Elsa secretly conduct their own experiment. The result is Dren: an amazing creature who exhibits an array of unexpected developments, both physical and intellectual. Dren exceeds their wildest dreamsŠand, ultimately, their most terrifying nightmare.\n\n\"SPLICE is my mutant baby. It's been gestating in my mind and in my heart for ten years. I've watched it grow from the cellular state of early script development through to the embryonic stage of visual conceptualization to the fetal phase of preproduction. Now, at last, it is ready to be born.\n\nLike any expectant father (or mother), I am full of hope and anxiety about what will arrive. Fortunately, I'm surrounded by an incredible team, which includes the Academy Award-winning producer Steve Hoban, our French production partners Gaumont, cinematographer Tetsuo Nagata, Production Designer Todd Cherniawsky and the FX wizards at KNB and C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures. And then there is the extraordinary cast: Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were genetically designed to play Clive and Elsa, the rock-and-roll rebels of bio-engineering. I can't imagine any other two actors who have more complexity, intelligence and charm. These are essential ingredients, because even though my film incorporates very sophisticated effects work, SPLICE is at its core a film about human... and non-human relationships. It is truly a hybrid, a peek into our future and a preview of all the exciting and terrifying creations that await us,\" says Director Vincenzo Natali.\n\nSPLICE is an official Canada-France treaty co-production produced with the financial participation of Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Media Development Corporation. Distribution in Canada by Seville Pictures Inc. International sales are handled by Gaumont.\n\nCopperheart Entertainment is a Toronto-based live-action and animation production company, mo, st recently completing production on the upcoming comedy Young People Fucking. The company is currently developing the feature adaptation of the worldwide bestselling Dragonriders of Pern series of novels.\n\nGaumont has been one of the main European production companies since 1895."
