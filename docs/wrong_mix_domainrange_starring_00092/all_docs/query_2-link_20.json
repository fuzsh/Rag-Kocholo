It was pretty … Continue reading →\n\nHello, Spongey here. Not only am I doing a good one, I’m doing one of my childhood favorites.

Oh sure, real life jerks suck, but you got to love the fictional ones. But much like idiots, you have to do them right. I mean, I’m glad I didn’t have to … Continue reading →\n\nHello, Spongey here. We looked a well known old one, a famous new one, so let’s do a semi-obscure new one. By new, I mean 2008.
