        "text": "You know what time it is! That’s right — it’s time for a fresh list of what’s coming and leaving Netflix in May 2019. In addition to adding TV shows and movies to the streaming platform each month, Netflix also sadly removes some content from their library. We’re particularly excited to see KJ Apa and Maia Mitchell‘s new Netflix original movie, The Last Summer. But sadly, we’re going to have to say goodbye to High School Musical 3: Senior Year — which is a total bummer! It’s hard to keep track, and that’s precisely why we have the list of films and series that are both coming and leaving Netflix in May.
