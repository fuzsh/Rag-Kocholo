The album features original songs performed by the cast of Lemonade Mouth, the band portrayed in the film. \"Lemonade Mouth\" premieres on Disney Channel, Friday, April 15 (8:00 p.m., ET/PT).\n\nThe Lemonade Mouth soundtrack will receive its worldwide broadcast debut on Radio Disney's Planet Premiere feature with host Ernie D and the cast of the movie on Saturday, April 9th (7:00 p.m., ET/ 4:00 p.m., PT) and Sunday, April 10th (12:00 p.m., ET/ 9:00 a.m., PT). In addition, the debut single \"Somebody,\" features a companion music video directed by Brandon Dickerson which makes its world premiere on Disney Channel (8:13 p.m. EST) and Vevo (9:00 p.m. EST) on March 18th.\n\nPerformed by the stars of the film, the music on the soundtrack is a rich blend of rock, dance, hip-hop and pop styles. The debut single, \"Somebody,\" sung by Bridgit Mendler, is a moving, hope-filled power ballad, while \"Determinate\" is an up-tempo dance track. Harmony-rich pop gems like \"Turn Up the Music\" and the rocker \"She's So Gone\" showcase Lemonade Mouth's DIY approach, while funky, hip-hop songs such as \"And the Crowd Goes\" and \"Don't You Wish You Were Us\" emphasize the band's humorous side. Others, like the acoustic-flavored \"More Than a Band\" and the synth-laden dance rocker \"Breakthrough\" boast positive messages and show what Lemonade Mouth is all about. In addition to his role in the movie and six music performances, Adam Hicks also co-wrote three tracks on the album, \"Determinate,\" \"Breakthrough\" and \"Livin' on a High Wire.\"\n\nBased on the book by Mark Peter Hughes, \"Lemonade Mouth\" tells the story of five alienated high school students who ultimately form a powerhouse band. After meeting in detention, they realize their shared passion for music and belief that it's time for their fellow students to stand up and be heard. They start a band -- Lemonade Mouth -- that soon resonates with students sidelined by the school elite. However, not everyone is ready to cheer them on, especially since the popular rock band Mudslide Crush is determined to maintain headline status and win the coveted Rising Star music competition at Mesa High.\n\nParamount Pictures Launches 'SUPER 8' Movie Trailer on Twitter in First of Its Kind Partnership\n\nParamount Pictures launched the movie trailer for its highly anticipated film, SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J.

Essentially everything has been leading up to the big reveal of the machineâs use. With both worlds on the verge of tearing the Earth apart from their inhabitant's actions, the next 3 episodes will show fans even more clearly how the choices we make can affect everyone and everything around us. John tells us that the producers and actors were given good reason to believe they would return for a new season, so they were never gauging this season finale on the end of the series itself, we will get to see this season's storyline arc and then gear up for a whole new set of stories for the upcoming season.\n\nNoble is really looking forward to fans seeing the season finale where he says there is a moment where he as an actor actually felt the character and action affect his mood. According to the veteran performer each day playing âWalterâ and âWalternateâ is exhausting no matter how you look at it but playing either version of the character never really affects him. When talking about Walter, John described this season as one of âaffectionâ for the character. Being strained in his relationship with Peter all season, there will be an emotional arc by the May 6 episode.\n\nWhen not working, John paints and plays music, but says his 14-16 hour workdays keep him pretty busy and focused on the show. To prepare for the scientific nature of the character(s) John said that he always had some kind of fascination with science, and gets his inspiration from reading books. While at university in England Noble studied law before realizing he could become an actor. He views his time on âFringeâ as a gift, giving him the ability to use every trick in the book. John studied acting as soon as he realized he could make a career out of it, and he loves to share his knowledge of the craft by teaching acting classes every now and then.\n\nTune in to âFringeâ Fridays on FOX\n\nChristian Slater Returns to TV with New Comedy \"Breaking In\"\n\nFOX has brought Christian Slater back to television with new comedy \"Breaking In,\" which begins a 7-week run on Wednesday, April 6 right after Idol. The show also stars Bret Harrison, Odette Annable and Alphonso McAuley.\n\nHere's the synopsis: Contra Security, a high-tech security firm that takes extreme â and often questionable â measures to sell its protection services is corporate Americaâs answer to âThe A-Team,â giving clients a sense of security by first ripping it away. In the opener, Contraâs man of mystery owner, Oz, blackmails his newest recruit, computer hacker Cameron, to join his team. Cameron quickly learns that cracking into state-of-the-art security systems is a lot easier than dealing with his co-workers, including the alluring Melanie, prank-pulling Cash and competitive Josh in the âPilotâ series premiere episode of BREAKING IN airing Wednesday, April 6 (9:30-10:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX.\n\nChristian on Being on TV\n\nI like the consistency of it. I like the pace of it. With the first two experiences I had, I really did respond well to the schedule. Itâs a very, very fast moving train. I donât like sitting around. I really like to get in there and do the job and get it done and feel good about it at the end of the day, and that pretty much seems to be the vibe on all the sets that Iâve gotten to be a part of.\n\nChristian on Following \"American Idol\"\n\nWe are all very thrilled and certainly happy with the support from FOX. Iâve been thinking about it a little bit, I kind of feel a little bit like Goldilocks. I mean I tried out the one bed, it didnât fit. I tried out the other bed, it didnât fit. This bed here at FOX feels just right.\n\nChristian on Pranks\n\nBehind the scenes, not yet. So far there have been so many pranks in front of the camera that itâs been difficult to get things going, but Iâm sure over time we will certainly have a lot of fun with each other. Iâve definitely had some good pranks in the past, on other shows that Iâve done. I mean, one prank I pulled kind of lasted even after the show was cancelled. Yes, about six months after, finally, the person found out that they were being pranked.\n\nCheck out \"Breaking In\" beginning Wednesday!\n\nGrab some popcorn and visit the EnterTeenment Cineplex for all your movie news and previews!\n\nDVD Reviews\n\nThe Journey Continues as One of âHigh School Musicalâsâ Favorite Characters Keeps the Music Playing! âSharpayâs Fabulous Adventureâ Dances on to Blu-ray and DVD!\n\nYou loved to hate her in the âHigh School Musicalâ trilogy but âSharpayâ (played by the incredibly talented Ashley Tisdale) will have you singing a different tune in the spin-off called âSharpayâs Fabulous Adventure,â which is now on Blu-ray and DVD.

Connie became my second mum and was always there to help and support me. Aidan is such a fabulous actor, I couldnât help but learn from him and even though he looks like he was really mean to me off set he looked after me and was always helping me develop my character and skills. I learned so much from both of them.\n\nDo you have a favorite scene from the movie?\n\nI loved the scene where I had to make stew for my Dad. I love to cook so learning the traditional way of preparing stew was really fun and all the throwing around of the ingredients with Jack and Tara was a hoot.\n\nWhat do you do in your free time?\n\nI recently took up Snowboarding and spent my free time practicing; I also play the drums and Trumpet, and keyboard so spend a lot of time practicing.\n\nDo you have any other projects coming up that we should watch out for?\n\nI have a couple of offers in the pipeline which I should be filming later on in the year but I canât say what they are yet.\n\nWhat would your dream role be?\n\nI would love to play a villain in a big action movie and try to take over the world.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring young actors?\n\nWork hard, never give up and be prepared for a lot of noâs. When I first started acting, I got the first three auditions I went for and thought this would happen every time. When I got my first no, I was devastated but when my Mum and Dad turned to me and asked do you still want to be an actor and I knew that I did and that made me realize that I would never give up trying for parts and I work hard for every audition, I make sure I have learned my lines and done as much research on the character as possible. That way if it is a no, I know I did my best. Today was just not my day.\n\nWant more news & goodies? Just press the button!"
