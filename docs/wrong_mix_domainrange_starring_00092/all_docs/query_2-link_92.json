        "text": "Things got interesting on Week 6 of DwtS as we saw routines about everything from cheeseburgers to Game of Thrones, along with the first ever Switch-Up Challenge.\n\nThe night started off auspiciously with a stellar opening number choreographed by Lacey Shwimmer and her brother Benjy. I’ve missed having Lacey in the ballroom – a feeling reinforced when she bantered with Tom, calling him an old fart. It also ended on a positive note – voting got screwed up somehow last week, so no one was eliminated this week! We can all laugh about it now, but Bill and Emma looked so sad when they thought they were getting kicked off. Instead, scores will carry over to next week, and now we have two even teams of four for Team Dances.\n\nIn the middle, though, a lot of weird stuff happened, both good and bad. In the bad category was a random performance by Mika and Ariana Grande. Who are these people? She looked about twelve years old, and he looked like her father, as they sang a new-and-not-at-all improved version of “Popular” from Wicked. Everything about this segment confused me.\n\nA new foible this season was the Switch-Up Challenge – think the Marathon from previous seasons, only the music keeps changing and the couples have to adapt, with zero preparation possible. This was done in two heats of four couples each – first couple out gets one point, and so on until the winner gets four points. Snooki barely did anything and got second place in her heat, but otherwise everything went quite well. Corbin and Karina won the first heat, and Amber and Derek won the second. Unfortunately, Derek’s signature head-bobbing move didn’t make an appearance. There was a lot of gyrating, a lot of jumping and clapping, a lot of spinning, some lifts, splits from Jack, and an open shirt from Bill. What more could one want?\n\nIn order of total scores, let’s welcome our stars!\n\nFirst Place (tie), 32 points: Elizabeth and Val (Cha-Cha, 30 + 2). Despite a truly horrific song (there was no cha-cha beat I could discern), Elizabeth and Val performed a perfect cha-cha – and were rewarded with the season’s first perfect score. It was well-deserved – Elizabeth’s movements were flawless, and boy was she moving! She oozed sensuality throughout the entire dance. The story this week was about the backlash following “Showgirls,” but am I ever glad Elizabeth moved past it to give us this dance! She seems to be the perfect partner for Val, and since we’re at the halfway point (as the show incessantly reminded us tonight), I’ll make my first early prediction for the winner: Elizabeth and Val. I think they really might take home the Mirrorball!\n\nFirst Place (tie), 32 points: Amber and Derek (Samba, 28 + 4). I agreed with Len last week about Derek’s messing about, but now he’s complaining about the routine being too repetitive? Sorry, but that’s not on. He is supposed to judge only Amber’s dancing. If there isn’t enough content, then yes, he doesn’t see Amber do what she should be doing. If he doesn’t like the order in which she does steps, what in blazes does that have to do with her? Len was totally in the wrong this week, giving an eight for an essentially perfect dance. Especially when he was the generous judge tonight for everyone else! Not only did Amber do practically every samba move in existence, she did them stupendously. So much so, that her fierceness was a turn-on for Carrie Ann. And she even accomplished a Samba Roll, the bane of ballroom dancers! Not cool, Len.\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nSecond Place, 31 points: Brant and Peta (Tango, 28 + 3). Hallelujah! As Len said, this was “absolutely corking!” For practically the first time all season, Peta actually choreographed a routine full of dancing for Brant – and he rose to the occasion magnificently! Evidently, Len was as thrilled as I am by this, since he gave them a ten despite other judges spotting “stumbles.” Brant’s tango technique was superb. His face was positively furious throughout the dance, looking even angrier than most tangoing dancers. Durign rehearsal, Janel Parrish from Pretty Little Liars stopped by to cheer Brant on and promised to tweet about them, attempting to rally Brant’s Pretty Little Fanbase. Brant is worried because Christina got sent home and she’s “way more famous” than him. Really? Does anyone actually know who she is? Can’t be all that many people who do if she got voted off despite placing first.\n\nThird Place, 30 points: Snooki and Sahsa (Foxtrot, 27 + 3). This dance achieved the maximum level of cutesiness before nausea would have been induced. Even when Snooki and Sasha were swinging around a pole in rehearsal, it turned out to be for an innocuous chase around a lamppost. There wasn’t as much foxtrotting as there was frolicking, but it was still a very good number. I love their backstage banter, and I enjoyed the disparity between the sweetness of the performance and Snooki’s exuberance afterward. Snooki is also getting the Most Improved Award of the this season.\n\nFourth Place, 28 points: Leah and Tony (Quickstep, 27 + 1). After last week’s disappointment, Leah had her best week yet this time around, with a very good quickstep. Was it worthy of nines? Certainly not, but score inflation has set in. I’m getting the feeling it’s time to send Leah home – she doesn’t seem able to deal with the increasing demands of the show. Len finally addressed the fact that you have to do quickstep in hold, and he will start actually holding couples to that. Imagine actually judging the dances based on rules! How novel!\n\nFifth Place (tie), 27 points: Jack and Cheryl (Paso Doble, 25 + 2). The portrait of Val in the rehearsal studio spoke to Jack to give guidance on looking like an arrogant matador. Then a live version of Val popped up in the rehearsal room, before Cheryl sent him away (probably discomfited by Jack being told not to fear her – Cheryl thrives on fear!). I wonder if all the portraits have such magical qualities? If so, DwtS could make a killing selling talking Val portraits. Jack’s Paso was good but not great – his posture wasn’t that good, and his cape-twirling needs work.\n\nFifth Place (tie), 27 points: Corbin and Karina (Viennese Waltz, 23 + 4). A Game of Thrones Viennese waltz?! SQUEE!!! I squeed nearly as much during this as I did during the HSM segment in week 2. Dragons soared at the beginning of the dance, and Karina ended by sitting on the Iron Throne. The rehearsal footage was even better: Karina shouted, “Unleash the dragons!!” and Corbin actually spoke Dothraki after talking in a Khal Drogo accent. Corbin is a total geek, freaking out in the best way upon getting the GoT theme, and declaring it his “all-time favorite show.” I like him more and more each week. Yes, this wasn’t that good a Viennese waltz, but it was a glorious performance! And I spotted HSM’s Ashley Tisdale in the audience. Hopefully we’ll see Zefron there one of these days.\n\nLast Place, 24 points: Bill and Emma (Tango, 23 + 1), brought to you by McDonald’s and Burger King. I loved everything about Bill’s “Cheeseburger in Paradise” tango! The performance focused on a couple’s angry passion for a burger. It was a bizarre combo, but definitely their best number. The dancing was actually quite good. I loved Emma brandishing mustard like a weapon – first at bill, then at Bruno upon getting a seven from him. Between that, and her ideas for corporate sponsorship from burger joints, Emma’s really grown on me as a new pro. The burger puns kept flying, and it really set the tone for a weird and wonderful night.\n\nWould you tango for a cheeseburger? Do you want Dany to waltz to the Iron Throne next season of GoT? How much would you pay for a talking portrait of Val? And what did you think of tonight’s performances? Answer all these important questions in the comments!"
