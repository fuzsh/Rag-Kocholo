        "text": "He is becoming “a little bit more machine” than man: Arnold Schwarzenegger has a pacemaker. The Terminator alum joked about his latest health update on his Arnold’s Pump Club podcast recently. After the 76-year-old actor had his third open-heart surgery, he has been fitted for a pacemaker this month. A pacemaker is a device that can be placed in your body, usually by surgery, to support the electrical system in your heart. They can stabilize abnormal heart rhythms and prevent problems that can disrupt or endanger your life.\n\nAfter getting the surgery last week at the Cleveland Clinic, the former California governor said that by the end of the week, he was “already at a big environmental event with my friend and fellow fitness crusader Jane Fonda,” he said.\n\nRELATED: Danny DeVito And Arnold Schwarzenegger Reunite For Another Movie\n\nThe two public servants joined California’s governor Gavin Newsom for a “sequel” to stop oil executives from drilling. Newsom signed a law to prohibit drilling within 3,200 feet of a housing project, park, school, or hospital. Oil companies want to undo that law in the upcoming November ballot. Not phased by this, Schwarzenegger confidently says in the video, “We have gone through this once before.”\n\nAs pointed out in the video and caption, in 2010, when Schwarzenegger was Governor, oil executives challenged his environmental policies with a ballot initiative, and “We beat them badly.” Taking a dig at Washington, D.C., Arnold says these tactics work there and worldwide, “but it never works in California” because of him, Fonda, and other community leaders.\n\nAs for the upcoming Presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger previously said they’re both too old for the job. Biden is 81, while Trump is 77. They both have also already served presidential terms, so Schwarzenegger hopes that America “finds some really young blood. Because to me, it is a little bit odd that we are having a battle between people today in the late seventies and early eighties rather than people in their forties and fifties or maybe even younger and have them have a chance at this great, great job.”\n\nSchwarzenegger’s Heart Surgeries\n\nSchwarzenegger underwent two open-heart surgeries in 1997 to replace his pulmonic valve and aortic valve. Normally lasting 12 to 15 years, he underwent surgery to get both replaced again in 2018 and 2020. As we previously reported, his most recent open-heart surgery nearly killed him. The Last Action Hero opened up about the procedure’s unexpected problems, waking up during the valve replacement surgery.\n\nThe doctors in front of him said, “‘I’m so sorry, but it was unlike what we planned, which was non-invasive surgery. We made a mistake and poked through the heart wall, and therefore we had to stop [the] bleeding.’ They had to open me up very quickly and to save [my] life.” Despite the surgical mistake, he had no choice but to accept the “disaster” he was in the middle of.\n\nPer Deadline, Schwarzenegger’s next role is in a holiday family comedy titled The Man With The Bag alongside Alan Ritchson. Then, he will be in a “big-budget” action-thriller called Breakout. After a four-year movie hiatus, his most recent work that has been released was Netflix’s 2023 action-comedy series FUBAR.\n\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\n\nPeople born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.\n\nLeos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.\n\nSome of the most iconic actors and comedians were born in the month of July.
