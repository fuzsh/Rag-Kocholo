        "text": "Happy Birthday Princess Diana (1961–1997)\n\nBorn: July 1, 1961 in Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk, England, UK\n\nDied: August 31, 1997 (age 36) in Paris, France\n\nMarried to:\n\nPrince Charles (29 July 1981 – 28 August 1996) (divorced) (2 children)\n\nQUOTES:\n\n[interview in “Panorama” magazine, 1995] There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\n\nAny sane person would have left long ago. But I cannot. I have my sons.\n\nI’d like to be a queen in people’s hearts but I don’t see myself being queen of this country.\n\nMy role is about 80% slog and 20% fantastic.\n\nIf I’m going to comfort the suffering, I have to understand what they’ve been through.\n\n[describing her relationship with the press] Wherever I go, it waits for me, and it tracks me down. Whatever I do, whatever I say, it will always look for controversy and contradiction. It will always criticize me.\n\nMy father always taught me to treat everybody as an equal. I have always done and I am sure that [Prince William and Prince Harry Windsor] are the same.\n\nI was always told by my family that I was the thick one. That I was stupid and my brother was the clever one. And I was always so conscious of that. I used to go to the head mistress crying saying I wish I wasn’t so stupid."
