        "text": "Sofía Vergara is living her best life with the end of her seven-year marriage to Joe Manganiello. A source tells People that the America’s Got Talent judge is “doing excellent” since Manganiello filed for divorce last week. The pair announced in a joint statement to Page Six last Monday (July 17), the pair’s statement reads: “We have made the difficult decision to divorce. As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.”\n\nOn the day of their statement, Sofia posted photos from her birthday vacation in Italy. Speculation around the status of their relationship began when fans noticed the True Blood alum wasn’t with her and that she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring just a few days before the news was confirmed. When Manganiello posted to Instagram for her 51st birthday, he further fueled rumors when he only wrote “¡¡¡Feliz Cumpleaños Sofía!!!” in the caption.\n\nFaking A Happy Marriage\n\nA source tells People that though she is “sad that her marriage didn’t work out,” she feels very fortunate anyway. Vergara is loving her life and staying at her house “for now. Joe is living elsewhere.” The insider adds that “there is no drama” between the former couple, though earlier reports from the publication say they were going through “ups and downs for a long time.” Sofia and Joe just “always put on a good front publicly.” When others were looking, the former couple would “plaster on smiles,” but they’d really be fighting or bickering.\n\nAnother source close to the Magic Mike star shared the same sentiments, explaining that they were “always very different” and lacked other characteristics to keep their marriage going in the long run. “Their physical attraction to each other only carried their marriage that far,” were “often bickering about the small things,” and were “both very stubborn,” the source adds. Towards the end of the relationship, they possessed “very negative energy” that hung around them for the “past few months.”\n\n“They were really trying to make it work, though,” the source added. “They do love each other. No one wants to constantly bicker with their spouse, though. Joe has absolutely nothing bad to say about her. She is a great woman. They were just not great together in the long run.” Vergara and Manganiello began dating in 2014 and got engaged six months later. They tied the knot on November 22, 2015.\n\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\n\nPeople born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.\n\nLeos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.\n\nSome of the most iconic actors and comedians were born in the month of July.
