        "text": "Yes, Pitch Perfect’s Chloe was in a Ghibli movie. As expected from Snow there was a brief acapella interlude, but Country Roads was a switch up from the high energy medleys in Pitch Perfect. Snow plays the female lead Shizuku in Whisper of the Heart, a coming-of-age romance. But listen out for her best friend who is none other than Ashley Tisdale aka Sharpay from High School Musical.\n\nRELATED:\n\nIf the name doesn’t ring a bell, you’ll probably recognise at least one of the characters this iconic voice actor has made famous. Bender from Futurama, Disenchantment’s King Zog, Adventure Time’s Jake, Rico from Madagascar, Saul from Bolt, Dr Drakken in Kim Possible, the list is stupidly long. You can spot him in Ghibli’s environmentally themed Pom Poko as the club owner fox, Ryûtarô. This movie was one of Ghibli’s quirkiest, but the dub also contains Johnathon Taylor Thomas, (who voiced the young Simba in the OG Lion King), and the epic J.K Simmons so it’s worth a watch.\n\nPonyo is packed with Hollywood A-listers. Most remember Liam Neeson and Matt Damon as Kôichi. But did you know that Ponyo’s mother, Gran Mamare, was Cate Blanchett? This was the actor’s first attempt at voice work, but she has gone on to do many more, including How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio.\n\n7. Willem Dafoe\n\nAnother actor to play two roles in the Ghibli universe. Dafoe starred in an old classic (Tales from Earthsea) as Lord Cobb, the evil mage who tries to take over the fantasy world. (It’s also worth looking out for James Bond actor Timothy Dalton as Sparrowhawk.) Eighteen years later, Dafoe is back in a lighter part as the Noble Pelican in The Boy and the Heron. His role as a main character is often forgotten, as Tales from Earthsea was not a Hayao Miyazaki film, but instead directed by his son Gorō Miyazaki.\n\nOkay, it’s not exactly a shocker that voice actor Mark Hamill has worked for Ghibli, but it might surprise to know just how many times he’s featured on their cast list. Recently he’s been added to the English dub of The Boy and the Heron as the Grand Uncle. But Hamill did some of his first voice work for the anime studio. Back in 1986, he voiced the bad guy, Muska in Laputa: Castle in the Sky, and 1984 he played the Mayor of Pejite in Nausicaӓ of the Valley of the Wind.\n\nBut Hamill was also one of Ghibli’s first hires as Laputa: Castle in the Sky was their first official film. Ghibli was not officially formed when Nausicaӓ of the Valley of the Wind was made, but it was the same team (Hayao Miyazaki) and is considered one of their works. The pair have a long and successful relationship.\n\n4. Uma Thurman\n\nScully has worked with Ghibli on no less than three occasions, believe it or not. The first was back in 1997 as the savage wolf Goddess Moro, in the award-winning Princess Mononoke. The versatile actress switched it up when she took on a role in the Japanese war drama, From Up On Poppy Hill (Dr. Miki Hokuto). Not content with assisting the studio in film, Gillian Anderson partnered with Netflix on the series Ronja, the Robber's Daughter acting as narrator for the show. Do we think she’s done? Hopefully not.\n\nChristian Bale reportedly saw Spirited Away and went to Ghibli and asked for a part in one of their films. He expected a small cameo but was offered the title role in their next picture. Yes, that was Howl in Howl’s Moving Castle. Diana Wynne Jones's novel inspired the anime and stars Emily Mortimer, Lauren Bacall, and Billy Crystal.\n\nBut it didn’t end there.\n\nBale is back in The Boy and the Heron, playing Shoichi Maki, Mahito’s father. Incidentally, The Boy and the Heron is bringing together two Batmen (R-Pats and Bale) and a Joker (Mark Hamil).\n\n1. Tom Holland\n\nThere were two dubs of the Ghibli classic The Secret World of Arriety. One for the US Market and another for the United Kingdom and Ireland. If you’ve been living in the United States, you’ve missed out on Tom Holland as Sho all these years. It also features Saoirse Ronan, Mark Strong, and Olivia Coleman. Track it down if you’ve never seen it.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
