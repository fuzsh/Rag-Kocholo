        "text": "Star Wars is a major part of our pop culture. As such, it's often referenced throughout pop culture. This page lists references made to Star Wars in other movies.\n\nAirplane 2: The Sequel (1982)[]\n\nThe movie starts with a Star Wars–style opening crawl.\n\nIn one scene, Stryker is wearing an oxygen mask and his breathing sounds similar to Darth Vader’s breathing regulator.\n\nAlien (1979)[]\n\nRidley Scott has stated that he would not have made Alien if George Lucas hadn't paved the way in showing a \"grunge future\" in Star Wars.\n\nAmerican Pie 2 (2001)[]\n\nThe guys are playing football near the beach and the ball goes over someone’s head and bounces by some girls. Oz (Chris Klein) goes to retrieve it and strikes up a conversation with the girls. Jim (Jason Biggs) says, \"Amazing,\" to which Stifler (Seann William Scott) replies, \"Yes, the Force is strong in that one.\"\n\nAntz (1998)[]\n\nPrincess Balla said to Z \"I hope you know what you're doing.\" And Z said \"Yeah me too.\" Which is just like Princess Leia said to Han Solo when entering into a cave to hide from the Galactic Empire.\n\nAnt-Man (2015)[]\n\nThe sound of Yellow-Jacket's lasers are the same sound effects used for the AT-ATs in The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nArmageddon (1998)[]\n\nHarry Stamper (Bruce Willis) has just briefed his crew on the mission and Chick (Will Patton) cries out, \"Harry, this is some Star Wars shit. This ain't for us.\"'\n\nAt one point, A.J. (Ben Affleck) and Oscar (Owen Wilson) are working on one of the machines:\n\nA.J.: \"If anybody's anybody, I'm Han and you're... you're Chewbacca.\"\n\nOscar: \"Chewie? Have you even seen Star Wars?\"\n\nA.J. says they need to jump the asteroid cavern like Evel Knievel. A.J. asks Andropov (Peter Stormare) if he has ever heard of Evel Knievel and Andropov says, \"No, I've never seen Star Wars.\"\n\nArthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010)[]\n\nAt the end of the film Darkos wears a mask and a cape that look like Darth Vader's. A young George Lucas sees him and ask if he can film it.\n\nAsterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra (2002)[]\n\nThere is a scene in the movie where a black centurion chokes somebody, like Darth Vader did on Tantive IV, and says, \"You won't fail me again.\" When the centurion throws the person away, there is a shot of his head and shoulders, almost identical to Vader's, and the \"Imperial March\" by John Williams plays in the background. Then he says, \"The Empire Strikes Back!\"\n\nAsterix at the Olympic Games (2008)[]\n\nIn one scene, there's a lightsaber from Star Wars.\n\nThe Astronaut Farmer (2006)[]\n\nOne of the FBI agents gets a phone call to his cell phone and his ringtone is The Imperial March.\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)[]\n\nIn the opening scene, the first hovering vehicles that pass by sound like snowspeeders.\n\nAt the end, when all the ships are flying towards Atlantis, you can see a Gungan Bongo in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nBrown Stormtroopers.\n\nAustin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)[]\n\n(Trailer) The camera shows you in space but quickly brings you to a messy planet. You already can hear Darth Vader's breathing sound in the background and a tune similar to the Imperial March. After a while the camera zooms in on a throne room, similar to Darth Sidious'. The throne turns and Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) says, \"Who did you expect?\"\n\n(Trailer) The male voiceover says: \"If you can only see one movie this summer, see Star Wars—but if you can see two, see Austin Powers!\"\n\nThe opening of the film features a space backdrop with yellow text scrolling from top to bottom, an obvious reference to the trademark opening crawl.\n\nDr. Evil had put a superlaser on the moon and this is a scene between Dr. Evil and his son Scott (Seth Green).\n\nDr. Evil: \"You see… I've turned the moon into what I like to call a... 'Death Star.'\"\n\nScott laughs.\n\nDr. Evil: \"What?\"\n\nScott: \"Nothing, Darth!\"\n\nDr. Evil: \"What did you call me?\"\n\nScott: \"Oh, nothing...\"\n\nScott (pretending to sneeze): \"Rip-off!!!\"\n\nDr. Evil: \"Bless you.\"\n\nAustin Powers (Mike Myers) shoots the running Dr. Evil in his spacesuit with a blaster. He turns to Austin and says (with a voice similar to Vader's): \"But, before you kill me... know this... Austin... I am your father\".\n\nAustin: \"Really?\"\n\nDr. Evil: \"No... I can't back that up.\"\n\nAustin: \"Right. Heh-heh. Idiot...\"\n\nDr. Evil's control room looks just like a TIE fighter's cockpit window.\n\nAvengers of Justice: Farce Wars[]\n\nThis movie is a parody of Marvel, DC, and Star Wars.\n\nThe A-Team (2010)[]\n\nAs The A-Team preparing to escape in a Hercules-class aircraft during its launch the \"failing engine\" sound effect heard which was used in The Empire Strikes Back when the Millennium Falcon failed to activate the hyperdrive.\n\nBaby Geniuses (1999)[]\n\nSuper-intelligent talking babies are kept in an observation chamber. During one of their conversations one of the babies refers to Kathleen Turner's character as \"Darth Vader in a skirt.\"\n\nBack to the Future (1985)[]\n\nWhen Marty McFly is trying to convince his father-to-be, George McFly, to ask his mother-to-be, Lorraine Baines, to go to the dance with him to stop Marty from not being born, Marty sneaks into his room with a radiation suit on and a hair dryer-cum-laser weapon, saying, \"Silence Earthling. My name is Darth Vader. I'm an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.\" He also does both the Vulcan and Klingon salutes. The planet Vulcan and Klingon references, however, are references to Star Trek.\n\nThe next day, Marty and George meet up at the Texaco gas station and Marty asks George why he wasn't in school and George says, \"Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Loraine, that he'd melt my brain.\"\n\nBedtime Stories (2008)[]\n\nBobbi has shaving cream in buns on her hair and says \"I'm Princess Leia\".\n\nIn one of the stories, a weapon is similar to that which of a lightsaber which is a hand that tickles the opponent, and makes the same noise of a lightsaber.\n\nThe Benchwarmers (2006)[]\n\nOne of the main characters collects Star Wars memorabilia, some of which can be seen throughout their house.\n\nThe movie has clips that show a Phase I Clone Trooper Lieutenant and a Darth Vader standee in a kitchen while R2-D2 in a sci-fi convention.\n\nBeta House (2007)[]\n\nThe geek pledge engages in the forbidden Greek Olympics on campus and participates in a challenge involving pugil sticks. Their competitor's name is Dan Maul, who wields the stick with deadly accuracy, much like Darth Maul, and wins the challenge.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop II (1987)[]\n\nIn a car-chase scene involving a large truck, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) yells to Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), \"Are you driving with your eyes open, or are you like using the Force?!\"\n\nBeverly Hills Cop III (1994)[]\n\nAlthough not an actual Star Wars reference, George Lucas makes a cameo appearance, as an unhappy customer at a theme park.\n\nBill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)[]\n\nWhile wearing suits of armor in medieval England, Bill & Ted each pick up a sword and start play dueling, complete with lightsaber sound effects from Star Wars.\n\nTed: Hey, Bill?\n\nBill: What?\n\nTed: I'm Darth Ted. [He hits Bill on the head with a sword.]\n\nBill: Yeah, well I'm Luke Bill. And you're not my father.\n\n[They begin to sword fight — sort of.]\n\nBill: Come on!\n\nTed: Hey! I totally conquered you, dude!\n\nBill: No way! Come on! I'll never rule the Universe with you.\n\nTed: Hey Bill . . . you totally know how to sword fight.\n\nDuring this, one of them also speaks like Yoda.\n\nBionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui[]\n\nLhikan's training of Whenua is reminiscent of Obi Wan's earlier teachings to Luke with Whenua's eyes being blindfolded and using a lightsaber.

Jackson) walks up to Townsville Hall and sees the Mayor of Townsville (Tom Kenny), he says \"You dummy, you're a member of the City of Townsville and a traitor!\", in a similar manner to Darth Vader's line from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope by saying \"You are a member of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor, take her away!\"\n\nBlossom, Bubbles and Buttercup is in the asteroids in space in the same way of the opening crawl in the beginning of the Star Wars movies.\n\nThe primates wearing as the other Mojos and starting to take over Townsville during the Primate introduction, they struggling the people of Townsville for their attack and Mojo Jojo yells \"NOOOO!\" This parodies the scene when Luke Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his father from Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nThe \"failing engine\" sound effect heard when Buttercup smashes the Townsville gas station sign was used in The Empire Strikes Back when the Millennium Falcon failed to activate the hyperdrive.\n\nWhen Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup flies back to Townsville as they accelerates in a \"lightspeed\" jump, complete with streaking starfield effect.\n\nBlossom and Buttercup are trapped by Mojo Jojo and Bubbles attempts to rescue them with her laserbeam eyes, X-wing laser sounds are used when she's using her laserbeam eyes.\n\nPokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew[]\n\nIn the animated movie, the titular Pokémon, Lucario, has the ability to sense the \"Aura pattern\" of other organisms, very similar to a Jedi being able to sense others with the Force. Coincidentally, the \"Aura\" is an energy field similar to the Force in itself. When Lucario emerges from the crystal on Sir Aaron's staff, he mistakes the main character of the series, Ash Ketchum, for Sir Aaron, due to his unique \"Aura pattern.\"\n\nLucario had previously believed his Master (Aaron), whom had lived hundreds of years ago, had deserted the kingdom on the brink of the Pokémon War. However, Ash and Lucario stumble upon a \"Time-Flower,\" which captures a moment and can display it later, and are shown what Sir Aaron really had done. Aaron appeared as a blue spirit, similar to Obi-Wan Kenobi in episodes V and VI.\n\nLater, Ash and Lucario use the Aura to heal the injured Pokemon Mew. To save inexperienced Ash from death, Lucario bumps him out of the way and cries, \"The Aura is with me!\" (a play on \"May the Force be with you\").\n\nAsh's apparent \"Aura sensitivity\" has not been brought back in the American version of the series, though it does in the Japanese version.\n\nPoltergeist (1982)[]\n\nThe boy in this Steven Spielberg–produced film had a lot of Star Wars toys.

(Luke says, \"No. you're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you,\" to which Vader replies, \"You already have, Luke.\")\n\nThere are at least three Orcs in Minas Tirith with black and red tattooed faces like Darth Maul.\n\nWhen the Witch-king of Angmar, shortly after Éowyn decapitates his wing rider while defending Théoden, lifts a mace to use it against her, he briefly utters breaths that uses Darth Vader's iconic breathing sound effect.\n\nPeter Jackson has also admitted that George Lucas's talent as a filmaker inspired him to go and create his own movies on the silver screen, mostly from the big impact that Star Wars was.\n\nRecess: School's Out (2001)[]\n\nThe villains try to use a tractor beam (green) to change the moon's orbit.\n\nRobots (2005)[]\n\nWhen Gasket and Wonderbot are fighting with the pipes, and lightsaber sound effects are used.\n\nOne of the voiceboxes Diesel tries on makes him sound like Darth Vader (in fact, James Earl Jones provided the voice; and coincidentally, Ewan McGregor, who plays Rodney, portrays Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequel trilogy).\n\nAlso, the first Episode III trailer was included with the movie, making Ewan McGregor have appearances in the accompanying Trailer and the primary film.\n\nThe Rock (1996)[]\n\nSomeone utters the line, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”\n\nRocketman (1997)[]\n\nHarland Williams’ character tends to the NASA monkeys one of which he refers to as, “My little Ewok.”\n\nRush: Beyond the Lighted Stage (2010)[]\n\nIn this documentury about the band Rush, a section is titled \"Yoda of the Drums,\" in reference to Freddie Gruber, who taught the drummer of Rush, Neil Pert, better drumming techniques later in his career.\n\nHighlighting Rush's tour with the band UFO, a picture of the band is shown with one of the members wearing a Star Wars t-shirt.\n\nRush Hour (1998)[]\n\nThe Chinese consul's name is Han Solon.\n\nSafety Not Guaranteed (2012)[]\n\nAfter Jeff twice defends his ignorance of technical details by saying he isn't a stormtrooper, Arnau points out that stormtroopers are blue-collar workers who don't know the technical details of the technology they use.\n\nSaving Silverman (2001)[]\n\n(J.D.)

Mas-Su Hiro training Shaggy and Scooby to be samurai is similar to Obi-Wan training Luke.\n\nThe Green Dragon Shaggy and Scooby seek can be in many ways similar to Yoda.\n\nThe Black Samurai shares many similarities with both Darth Vader and Darth Sidious; the black armor, the deep voice, the swordsmanship, the ugly white face, and the unmasking and death that follows.\n\nIt's also worth noting that samurai movies helped inspire Star Wars to begin with.\n\nScream 2 (1997)[]\n\nWhen one character argues that sequels are inferior to their original films, one character counters, \"The Empire Strikes Back. Better story, improved effects,\" which is matched with, \"Not a sequel, part of an original planned trilogy.\"\n\nScream 3 (2000)[]\n\nIn the movie, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) leaves Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox-Arquette) a video on how to survive a horror movie trilogy, mentioning Return of the Jedi along with The Godfather Part III as the final trilogy films that revealed \"something we thought was true, that wasn't true.\"\n\nSerendipity (2001)[]\n\nLars (John Corbett) and his agent are watching his latest video when they see an older man in a brown robe.

Satan looks back and forth between the two as Cartman prepares to kill Saddam, though when Saddam urges Satan to save him, Satan kills the victim, rather than, as Darth Vader does, killing the attacker.\n\nSpaceballs (1987)[]\n\nThe entire movie itself is a parody, and the opening crawl recap is briefly shown in the beginning. See the Spaceballs article.\n\nSpace Camp (1986)[]\n\nThis film featured Max (Joaquin Phoenix), a boy who was a huge Star Wars fan and who dropped tons of references to it throughout the movie.\n\nThe score was also composed by John Williams.\n\nSpawn (1997)[]\n\nWhile Spawn is learning about his newfound powers from the old man he says, \"Hold on a sec', Yoda.\"\n\nSpeed Racer: The Next Generatinon[]\n\nWhen Connor says that it's a coincidence that Speed has Speed Racer's things and implies that he might be a relative, Speed replies, \"I have as much of a chance of being related to Speed Racer as you do of being a relative of Darth Vader.\" Robot Chim-Chim puts a bucket on Connor's head and the sound effect of Darth Vader's breathing is used and says, \"Speed, I am your father.\"\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017)[]\n\nNed, Peter Parker's best friend is an avid LEGO builder. In the movie, Ned tries to convince his friend to help him build his LEGO Death Star. In his first on-screen appearance, he holds a LEGO Darth Sidious and imitates his by saying \"Join me...\"\n\nNed's second scene shows that Ned finished the LEGO Death Star only to drop and let it smash on the floor to his shocking discovery of Peter being \"The Spider-Man\".\n\nLater on in the movie Peter and Ned are shown together rebuilding and finishing the shattered LEGO Death Star.\n\nPeter's room is full of Star Wars merchandises, including a plastic toy AT-AT and X-Wings.\n\nThe Spongebob Squarepants Movie (2004)[]\n\nThe sound effect for a TIE fighter can be heard near the end of the wasteland sequence.\n\nSpy Kids (2001)[]\n\nJuni (Daryl Sabara) has a mini lightsaber as one of the gadgets with Carmen Cortez (Alexa Vega).\n\nThe \"failing engine\" sound effect heard when the second wing breaks off from Machete's Spy Plane was used in The Empire Strikes Back when the Millennium Falcon failed to activate the hyperdrive.\n\nStarcrash (1978)[]\n\nNearly a complete ripoff from the first film.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)[]\n\nDarth Vader's helmet can be seen when Spock is spacewalking in V'Ger.\n\n[]\n\nThe Millennium Falcon can be seen during the Battle of Sector 001.\n\nStar Trek (2009)[]\n\nThe actor Chris Pine, who played Captain Kirk, said that his performance was inspired by Han Solo and Indiana Jones.[3]\n\nOn their commentary track on the DVD, the lead production staff freely admitted that they, to some degree, echoed the storytelling of A New Hope, with producer Damon Lindelof calling it the \"great myth of our childhood\" in the tradition of one of George Lucas's heroes, Joseph Campbell. In two scenes from the film (the young Kirk at dawn gazing upon the under-construction Enterprise and the older Spock first seen while scaring off a monster about to eat Kirk), the similarity to a memorable Episode IV scene (Luke gazing at the Tatooine suns-set and Obi-Wan first seen scaring off the Tusken Raiders attacking Luke) is stated to be quite intentional — Lindelof even describes the former as Kirk's \"Tatooine moment.\"\n\nWhen the USS Enterprise warps to Vulcan and meets a field of debris made up of several Starfleet ships destroyed by the Narada, R2-D2 can be vaguely seen among the wreckage.\n\nJust before entering warp to go to Vulcan's aid Captain Christopher Pike orders Sulu to \"Punch it.\"\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness (2013)[]\n\nR2-D2 appears again in the sequel to Star Trek (2009), as part of the debris of an explosive decompression as the USS Enterprise is attacked by the USS Vengeance at warp speed.\n\nStarship Troopers (1997)[]\n\nJohnny Rico is recovering in a medical tank from the Bug invasion on Klendathu which reminds us of Luke Skywalker being healed in the Bacta tank after being frozen in the frozen wastelands of Hoth and being attacked by the Wampa from The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nStep Brothers (2008)[]\n\nIn this movie, Dale has a Chewbacca mask that he sometimes wears. Towards the end of the movie Brennan gets his own mask and says he doesn't care that his is not movie-quality.\n\nWhile playing drums at Brennan's party, Dale is wearing a Yoda t-shirt.\n\nStep Up 2: The Streets (2008)[]\n\nThe character \"Moose\" wears a T-shirt depicting a cartoonish image of Yoda in his early \"School Lunch\" scene.\n\nStrange brew[]\n\nWhile playing hockey, one player says, \"Come to the dark side, eh?\"\n\nSuburban Commando (1991)[]\n\nThe opening scene of this movie shows a large Starship-like battle space station reminiscent of both an Imperial I-class Star Destroyer and the Death Star fighting against several X-wing-esque fighters.\n\nSunshine (2007)[]\n\nWhen Capa (Cillian Murphy) finds Pinbacker (Mark Strong), Pinbacker says, \"Are you an angel?\", which Anakin Skywalker says to Padmé Amidala in The Phantom Menace. In the DVD commentary, director Danny Boyle confirms that this is a Star Wars reference. Also, the character Cassie is played by Rose Byrne, who plays Dormé in Attack of the Clones.\n\nSuperbad (2007)[]\n\nOne of the police officers imitates Yoda, Darth Vader, and Darth Sidious; refers to his junior partner as a Padawan; says that Attack of the Clones is a great movie; and gets into a \"lightsaber\" fight with his partner using flashlights.\n\nThe Swan Princess Christmas (2012)[]\n\nWhile being aggressive and competitive with each other, due to Rothbart's spell, Queen Uberta and Lord Rogers battle against each other using lightsticks as lightsabers.\n\nTeam America: World Police (2004)[]\n\nThe bar scene in Cairo is based upon the Cantina scene in A New Hope. The music and the shots of the customers are very similar. The Arabic dialogue also sounds like the alien voices.\n\nThere is a shot one may assume where two Arabs are smoking, much like two similar aliens from the cantina.\n\nThere is a band which also plays similar instruments as the Modal Nodes — indeed, the music they are playing is the cantina music played backwards. The scene is also reminiscent of Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi because some fat guys are sitting there watching a dancer, much like Jabba watching Oola.\n\nNear the end of the movie, Gary bluffs his way past the North Korean soldiers guarding the front door of Kim Jong Il's Palace by using a Jedi mind trick on them.\n\nKorean: Who the hell you?\n\nGary: I'm with the Film Actors Guild. I'm here to help with the broadcast.\n\nKorean: Then you show credentials!\n\nGary: Hey... you don't need to see my credentials. I left them at home and I'm running late.\n\nKorean: I believe him.\n\nKorean: Yeah, me too.\n\nTinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue (2010)[]\n\nThe tinker fairy, Bobble, is offering instruction on how to lash two cattails together to construct a boat when he quotes Han Solo instructing Chewbacca on Millennium Falcon repairs in The Empire Strikes Back: \"This one goes there, that one goes there, right?\"\n\nTitan A.E. (2000)[]\n\nIt was promoted with, \"This is the movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for.\"\n\nThere is a scene which establishes the drifter colony. At the bottom, towards the right, there is a particular sphere which looks like the Death Star.\n\nAkima quotes Princess Leia's line from The Empire Strikes Back when she asks, \"Would it help if I got out and pushed?\"\n\nTommy Boy (1995)[]\n\nAt one point Tommy (Chris Farley) quoting Darth Vader's famous line by saying, \"Luke, I am your father\" into a fan, which makes his voice sound mechanical.\n\nTomorrowland (2015)[]\n\nGeorge Clooney's character Frank chops off a robot's hand when it was pursuing the main protagonist. This is a nod to when Darth Vader chopped off Luke Skywalker's hand at the end of The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nIn the character Hugo's dramatic entrance the Main Star Wars theme is heard.\n\nThe Blast from the Past store includes many Star Wars references including a life-size, model of Han Solo frozen in carbonite, a poster of Yoda, R2-D2, the Millennium Falcon, X-Wings, TIE Fighters, an AT-ST and a life-size stormtrooper.\n\nThe character Ursula Gernsback has Princess Leia's buns hairstyle from Episode IV.\n\nThe Jetpacks used in the film were insired by the white stormtroopers.\n\nThe director of The Incredibles (2004), Brad Bird was given the opportunity to direct Episode VII but declined.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997)[]\n\nMedia mogul Elliot Carver, referring to the headline \"The Empire WILL Strike Back\" (a reference to the seemingly inevitable Anglo-Chinese war which 007 works to prevent by proving that Carver, and not China, was responsible for the sinking and crew massacre of a British frigate), says, \"I rather like the last one. It isn't even mine.\" This is actually a reference to an infamous Newsweek cover from the Falklands War, showing a British aircraft carrier with the title \"The Empire Strikes Back\", which is a second Star Wars film.\n\nToy Story (1995)[]\n\nWhen Buzz Lightyear is on the bed after Andy placed him there, a pan is seen through his eyes. Then we can hear breathing that is similar to Darth Vader's.\n\nWhen Buzz and Woody are under the truck in the gas station, Buzz tells Woody, \"Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!!! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness....\", which is very similar to what Princess Leia tells Han Solo about the Death Star and Operation Skyhook in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.\n\nWhen Sid \"interrogates\" Woody, he says: \"Oh! A survivor! Where's the Rebel base!? Talk!!!\" and a bit after this: \"Where are your Rebel friends now? Hahahaha!\"\n\nWhen Buzz sees the Buzz Lightyear commercial on the TV, the sound we can hear when Buzz \"shoots\" a laser is a TIE fighter's cannon sound.\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)[]\n\nIn the opening scene with the space backgrounds, the music is very similar to the one we can hear after the Star Wars titles. There is also the moment just after this when Buzz passes by, like after every Star Wars title, a ship passes by.\n\nWhen a camera comes through a trap door in a wall, it is a tribute to Jabba's Palace's camera at the main entrance.\n\nZurg says, \"Come to me, my prey,\" like when Darth Vader says to Luke, \"Come to me, my son\" in The Empire Strikes Back. At the same moment Buzz goes into a hall that lights up when he enters, just like the one Luke takes during his duel against Darth Vader on Cloud City. The room he arrives in has a great pit that looks just like the one in the Emperor's throne room on the second Death Star. When Zurg arrives, he says: \"So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.\" like Darth Vader in the Death Star when he says to Obi-Wan \"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last.\". And of course Emperor Zurg's design is directly made after Darth Vader's armor, especially the helmet.\n\nThe opening scene contains a number of sound effects from Star Wars, including Darth Vader's breathing, TIE Fighter, and X-Wing, AT-AT and lightsaber sounds.\n\nIn their climactic battle, Utility Belt Buzz accuses the robot-like Zurg of having killed his father, to which Zurg responds that he is his father: \"No, Buzz, I am your father!\" causing a horrified Utility Belt Buzz to yell, \"NOOOO!!!\" This is a parody of the famous scene in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, where Luke Skywalker learns that Darth Vader is his father.\n\nAlso, the robot that pops out of a wall-like a camera resembles the Perimeter Droid who pops out of the door to a palace of Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.\n\nCoincidentally, Toy Story 2 was released in theatres the same year as the VHS and DVD release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\n\nToy Story 3 (2010)[]\n\nWhen Buzz is under Lotso's control and takes out his friends, Jessie protests, and he tells her: \"Silence, minions of Zurg! You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance!\", which is a reference to the quote of Darth Vader in A New Hope when he tells Princess Leia: \"You are part of the Rebel Alliance, and a traitor. Take her away!”\n\nAt the end, when Trixie and Rex are playing on the computer, we can hear a typical Star Wars sound when they finish their game. This sound is the one heard when C-3PO and R2-D2 flee from the Tantive IV in an escape pod, or when Mars Guo's podracer's motor explodes after having sucked up the tool Sebulba had thrown to it.\n\nWhen Big Baby throws Lotso the Bear into the dumpster, it's a reference to Darth Vader throwing Darth Sidious into the reactor in Return Of The Jedi.\n\nTransformers: The Movie[]\n\nAfter the initial sequence with Unicron the film's background is established with an Opening Crawl. (This is only in the British release of the film, because Britain was behind in the airings of the series. The American release jumped straight from the opening sequence to the credits.)\n\nThe movie's promotional material mentions that the film was \"conceived in the epic tradition of Star Wars\".\n\nOne of the film's primary characters, Arcee, has a head design styled in the likeness of Princess Leia's famous \"cinnamon bun\" hair from A New Hope.\n\nMegatron, at one point, uses a lightsaber-type weapon on his battle against Optimus Prime. So does Hot Rod during his training just as Luke Skywalker does.\n\nThe villain Unicron is a gigantic planet-destroying robotic spheroid, like the Death Star.\n\nThe sound effect produced when Rodimus Prime opens the Autobot Matrix is a combination of several lightsaber power-up sounds from Star Wars; Nelson Shin, who designed the sound, was also on the sound crew for Transformers: The Movie.\n\nAt the scene where Rodimus Prime receives the Matrix of leadership, the voice of Optimus Prime is heard. This is a reference to Obi-wan Kenobi saying the phrase \"Use the Force, Luke\" to Luke Skywalker in the Battle of Yavin.\n\nUnicron is voiced by the late Orson Welles, who was considered for the voice of Darth Vader.\n\nTraumschiff Surprise – Periode 1 (2004)[]\n\nThe asthmatic character Jens Maul resembles Darth Vader while his name and his moped are a parody on Darth Maul.\n\nRegulator Rogul is an allusion to Emperor Palpatine. The Regulator's guards resemble the Imperial Guards.\n\nThe Space Taxi's flight is very reminiscent of the podrace in Episode I. The Space Taxi's front engines, which are extended just before takeoff, also look like those of a pod racer.\n\nQueen Metapha resembles Princess Leia and Queen Amidala while Rock is reminiscent of Han Solo. Additionally, much of the dialogue between Metapha and Rock in the Wild West town is reminiscent of dialogue between Leia Organa and Han Solo in Episode V: Rock claims the queen needs him because she loves him, she replies that he is important to the mission; in Star Wars, Han says so too, and Leia replies that he's important to the Rebellion because of his leadership skills. Shortly thereafter, Rock tells Metapha that he's not doing this to save the world, he just wants his cab fixed. Han says he's not doing this for the rebellion, but because he wants his money. When Rock shows up on Jens Maul's motorcycle, Metapha declares he's a hero. He replies \"I know\", which is based on the famous dialogue \"I love you\" - \"I know\".\n\nThe city \"City of Government\" looks like Coruscant with its towers while its senate commemorates the government of Naboo and the Jedi Council.\n\nThe Martian starfighters are similar to T-16 airhoppers while the pilots resemble TIE pilots.\n\nLike in Star Wars, there is a communication via holograms.\n\nThe name of the extraterrestrial pilot H2O2 reminds (besides the formula H2O2 = hydrogen peroxide) of the droid R2-D2. The language of H2O2 is reminiscent of that of the Separatist Poggle the Lesser from Episode II - Attack of the Clones.\n\nTreasure Planet (2002)[]\n\nThe television commercial for this animated Disney movie boasted, \"Star Wars meets Treasure Island.\"\n\nTron: Legacy (2010)[]\n\nKevin Flynn looks a lot like Obi-Wan: He has the same hairstyle, also, his clothes look similiar to Obi-wan's.\n\nWhen handed a small metal cylinder that turns into a light cycle, Sam grips it with both hands as though about to begin lightsaber dueling.\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012)[]\n\nJacob Black says to Bella, \"Surprised that you took a break from Jedi training,\" referring to Bella working on developing her new vampire powers.\n\nTwister (1996)[]\n\nDuring the climax of the movie, the ragtag tornado chasers deploy a weather probe called “Dorothy” into a tornado. As the data is streaming into the van one of the scientists yells, “That’s no moon! It’s a space station!”\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)[]\n\nSound effects from the Original Star Wars trilogy appear in this trilogy.\n\nE.g: During the birth of the Urukai army Star Wars sound effects is used for crafting weapons.\n\nPeter Jackson has also admitted that George Lucas's talent as a film-maker inspired him to go and create his own movies on the silver screen, mostly from the big impact that Star Wars was.\n\nUp (2009)[]\n\nThe \"proper\" voice of the chief dog (named Alpha) is Darth Vader's\n\nWhen Muntz first sees the floating house, he says \"You came here in that thing?,\" just as Leia did when she first saw the Millennium Falcon.\n\nAt the end of the movie, when Russell is trying to escape with the flying house, three dogs in airplanes are going after him. The first dog says, \"Raid leader checking in,\" the second says, \"Raid 2 checking in,\" and the third says, \"Raid three checking in,\" which is a reference to the end of A New Hope where the rebels are going to destroy the first Death Star in their X-wings. They are each code named Red Leader, Red Two, Red Three, etc., and when they check in they say, \"Red Leader standing by,\" \"Red Two standing by,\" etc.\n\nWhen the credits are rolling you see a picture of Mr. Fredricksen and Russel who are going to see Star Wars in a movie theater.\n\nWALL-E (2008)[]\n\nWhen Auto shocks WALL•E in order to take back the plant and GO-4 watches, this might be a spin on the near-final scene from Return of the Jedi where Darth Sidious shocks Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader watches, but in this version, Vader (GO-4) doesn't save him.\n\nWhat a Girl Wants (2003)[]\n\nAmanda Bynes, voice of Daphne (played herself in \"The Amanda Show\"), she says to Ian, \"So tell me Obi-Wan, where did you learn your impressive skills?\"\n\nWarGames (1983)[]\n\nWhile hacking the computer of a company called Protovision, David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) says in a deep voice, \"Protovision, I have you now,\" a reference to Darth Vader's line in A New Hope.\n\n[]\n\nKat Ellis says to Nick Mercer, \"You're like the Yoda of escorts.\" Later, she answers Mercer, \"Okay, Yoda.\"\n\nWhat Women Want (2000)[]\n\nDarcy (Helen Hunt) discusses her reputation, “I'm the man-eating bitch Darth Vader of the ad world.”\n\nWhen Good Ghouls Go Bad (2001)[]\n\nChristopher Lloyd's character refers to Ryan Kankel as \"Dark Lord of the Stupid\" in the opening narration.\n\nWithout A Paddle (2004)[]\n\nDan Mott is played by Seth Green who has connections to Star Wars through his work as Chris on the cartoon Family Guy as well as his show Robot Chicken. Green will also be lending his voice to the new Clone Wars animated series.\n\nAt one point Jerry (Matthew Lillard) says, \"Come back to bed, you guys. I’m freezing,\" to which Tom (Dax Shepard) replies, \"Not until he puts Jabba back in his Hutt!\"\n\nAt one point Dan does a C-3PO imitation:\n\nDan: [doing his best C-3PO voice] We are in serious trouble my friends. All data points to us being . . . how do you humans say it? Completely screwed.\n\nDan: Yeah. You know, that is . . . that's a good way to say it. That pretty much sums it up.\n\nDan: [doing his best C-3PO voice] As expected, Tom is . . .drunk.\n\nWolf Creek (2005)[]\n\nIn the car just after realizing the car is dead, the main character turns on the flashlight and waves it like a lightsaber making the noises.\n\nWonder (2017)[]\n\nAugust \"Auggie\" Pullman is a big fanatic of the Star Wars franchise. He often talks about it and even grew his own Padawan braid with his friend Christopher.\n\nDuring Halloween, Auggie was meant to dress up in his Boba Fett costume but his dog threw up on it so he instead wears a GhostFace mask.\n\nAs well as, the actor who plays Auggie, Jacob Tremblay is an avid fanatic of Star Wars.\n\nCoincidentally, the film was released in the same year as Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\n\nWreck-It Ralph (2012)[]\n\nA Star Wars: The Arcade Game cabinet can be seen early in the film.\n\nDuring a scene when Ralph is in the video game \"Sugar Rush,\" he is under a chocolate lake with a snorkel sticking up out of the water. During the time the snorkel is above water, Darth Vader's breathing sound effect can be heard.\n\nWrongfully Accused (1998)[]\n\nWhen the usher of a cinema was accommodating a couple, he extracted a lightsaber to indicate their seats to them.\n\nWhen Ryan Harrison falls (above a table, it looks like carbonite frozen Han Solo's scene.)\n\nX-Men (2000)[]\n\nTowards the end of the movie, Toad's handling of a metal pole is the same manner of Episode I with Darth Maul when he first ignites his double-bladed lightsaber. Both characters were played by Ray Park.\n\nToad is killed by Storm, who uses an electric blast similar in appearance to Force lightning.\n\nX-Men: Apocalypse (2016)[]\n\n4 teenaged mutants, Cyclops, Jubilee, Nightcrawler and Jean Grey are in a mall to go and see Return of the Jedi in a cinema in 1983. After the movie ends, they come to a conclusion that they agree \"that the third is always the worst\".\n\nZen Noir (2004)[]\n\nThe Detective and Master makes a reference to Yoda at one point. Also, references to lightsabers are made.\n\nZenon: The Zequel (2001)[]\n\nAs in Star Wars, at first they explain the situation in ascending letters with a space background.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno (2008)[]\n\nIn the hopes of paying off their bills, Zack and Miri decide to make a Star Wars–themed adult movie.\n\n\"Fett's Vette,\" a song by MC Chris filled with numerous references to Star Wars, is featured in the movie.\n\nZoolander (2001)[]\n\nZoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are in a heated argument when Zoolander challenges him to a walk-off and starting a fight:\n\nZoolander: What say we settle this on the runway . . .Han Solo?\n\nHansel: Are you challenging me to a walk-off . . . Boo-Lander?\n\nGallery[]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of references to Star Wars in television\n\nList of references to Star Wars in music\n\nList of references to Star Wars in video games\n\nList of references to Star Wars in webcomics\n\nList of references to Star Wars in miscellanea"
