        "text": "Kevin Bacon disguised himself as a normal person to remove the mask of a celebrity for a day, but it wasn’t quite what he expected.\n\nIn a new interview with Vanity Fair published Wednesday (July 3), the Footloose alum installed the help of a special effects makeup artist, had consultations, and had a prosthetic disguise made to make his dream come true.\n\n“I’m not complaining, but I have a face that’s pretty recognizable,” the award-winning actor told the publication. Wearing a hat and glasses only goes so far when he has such a famous face.\n\nNormal Person Disguise Fail\n\nBacon wore a prosthetic nose, fake teeth, and glasses to the Los Angeles’ popular The Grove shopping complex. Astounded, the disguise worked — a little too well. No one recognized him, and he recalled they were pushing past him.\n\nHe joked, “Nobody said, ‘I love you.’ I had to wait in line to, I don’t know, buy a f—ing coffee or whatever. I was like, ‘This sucks. I want to go back to being famous.'”\n\nA week ago, the actor posted a video strolling around New York City, wearing a hat. Heading to the subway station, Bacon slipped on a face mask to go further into incognito mode. He added that he is a “subway stander,” while his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, prefers to sit.\n\nAfter he emerged from the train back on to the sidewalk, a fan called out to him and he panned his camera towards the fan, smiling afterwards. One person commented, “Just Kevin Bacon walking around like he’s not famous. Love seeing the people’s reactions to spotting him!”\n\nBacon stars in both Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, which is now streaming on Netflix, and MaXXXine, which hits theaters Friday (July 5). Bacon appearing in an action-comedy and horror film in the same week has him feeling “very grateful for where I happen to be,” he told Vanity Fair. For both completely different films and roles, the actor said he has “fought really long and hard for it.”\n\nWith a whopping 110 acting roles under his belt and a career in acting that began nearly 50 years ago, Bacon shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe actor is also set to star in two television projects, The Bondsman and Sirens, as well as a film titled Connescence. Connescence will also star his wife and marks the first time the couple starred in a role together for 20 years, since they acted alongside each other in 2004’s Cavedweller and The Woodsman.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
