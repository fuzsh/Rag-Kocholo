        "text": "Using his preferred method of communication, Kurt Sutter announced two days ago on Twitter that his wildly popular biker drama, Sons of Anarchy, began shooting its seventh and final season in L.A. What followed was a flurry of casting news including word that Annabeth Gish had been cast as Althea Jarry, the new sheriff in Charming, filling the void left by the exit of both Sheriff Eli Roosevelt (Rockmond Dunbar) and strong-jawed brunette Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff). It was also announced that musician Marilyn Manson would have a role to play in SAMCRO’s final days. We talked to Sutter on the phone about his final season casting choices, why we can give up on a part for Aaron Paul, and the rights to one song that continues to elude him.\n\nV.F. Hollywood: What can we expect from Annabeth Gish as the new sheriff in town? Your show is famous for its tough-as-nails female roles. Can we expect Jarry to hold her own against the likes of Gemma (Katey Sagal)?\n\nKurt Sutter: I think so. Without spoiling it, I think she’ll be a different kind of adversary. You need law enforcement in this community, it’s just a part of the show; you can’t avoid having those characters. So the trick is always how you make them feel unique and different without feeling like you’re just reaching to make someone unique and different. How can they be different from what you’ve seen in the past and still be true to the job and the world so it doesn’t get goofy?\n\nI love Annabeth. I had her in mind from the jump when I was putting this character together who’s strong and has a sense of worldliness and can roll with the guys and knows when to look the other way. She’s come up, we say, she’s had a lot of time in organized crime divisions, so she already has to have a certain amount of confidence and strength and fortitude so as soon as the character opens her mouth, there’s history behind her. And I have no doubt that Annabeth will be as strong as any other ladies on the show.\n\nWhat about casting Marilyn Manson? Where on earth did that come from? What can we expect there?\n\nYou know it’s not a big role. Manson is a friend and we’ve been working on some music together and he’s a mega fan of the show and he’s really been wanting to do more acting. So this role came up for this white supremacist who’s a shot caller in jail who Jax has a relationship with. So right now I think he’s in two or three episodes this season. I just thought it was an interesting idea to have Manson wipe off the mascara and slap on some swastikas.\n\nYou’ve worked with a wide range of actors on Sons from David Hasselhoff to Peter Weller, Jimmy Smits, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, and even Ashley Tisdale. As you head into your final season, is there one actor you always wanted to work with and were never able to get?\n\nI’ve been pretty lucky. I like to do my sort of quirky, out of the box casting each season which we’ve done this year with Marilyn Manson and there might be more coming down the pipe. I’ve had conversations with Aaron Paul. Someone had asked me in a Q&A about who I wanted to work with. I was a fan of Aaron and he was circling another project of mine [Sutter’s feature film Southpaw], so we had some email conversations about his availability. But dude’s booked up to 2048.\n\nBreaking Bad’s Vince Gilligan said he was saving Badfinger’s “Baby Blue” for the season finale. Since music is such a huge part of your show, do you have something already in mind that you’ve been saving for Sons of Anarchy’s final musical montage?\n\nMusic is a huge part of the show and I’m really glad that people have been very aware of that. In terms of the final song, I know I’ll use some kind of piece of music but it’s hard at this point to know exactly what the tone will be at the end. I usually don’t find it or see it until I’m in the writing of it. There have been some songs that we’ve been trying to get for awhile. I’ve been trying to get Springsteen’s “Adam Raised A Cain” for years, it’s just so perfect for the show. It’s impossible, between Sony and Bruce, to get the rights. That’s been a brick wall and I’m assuming that’s not going to change.\n\nSometimes you get lucky. We had chosen, I won’t spoil and say which one, but there was a Queen song we wanted to use this season. We got shot down by management because of the content of the show, and then I was able to reach out individually to the band and I got responses and we we’re able to override the management dictate to use the song. So I have an episode in mind, mid-season, where I want to use it. So sometimes you get lucky and get to navigate around these hurdles, but the Bruce hurdle is pretty high.\n\nWell now I’ll be disappointed if the Queen song isn’t “Bicycle Race.”\n\nHaha, perfect.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace. Plus, Simon Russell Beale drops by Still Watching to discuss the introduction of his new character, the Lord of Harrenhal.\n\nTelevision\n\nHow Princess Diana’s Funeral Inspired House of the Dragon’s Somber Procession\n\nIt’s brother versus brother in “Rhaenyra the Cruel,” which sees Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk come to fatal blows. Plus, House of the Dragon director Clare Kilner drops by to discuss staging the funeral procession and the trickiness inherent in working with identical twins.\n\nStyle\n\nI Taught the Taylor Swift Class at Harvard. Here’s My Thesis\n\nProfessor Stephanie Burt shares what she learned about the singer’s stardom, relatability, and her own course at a college famous for being famous.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ewan Mitchell Is Channeling Tony Soprano and Robert De Niro\n\nMitchell, who plays the one-eyed Prince Aemond, drops by Still Watching to chat about his character’s motivations and surprising vulnerability.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Tom Glynn-Carney Thinks King Aegon Is a “Tragic Case”\n\nIn episode five of House of the Dragon’s second season, Team Black mourns the loss of a matriarch, while Team Green decides who will temporarily rule King’s Landing. Tom Glynn-Carney drops by Still Watching to chat about Aegon’s “boyish vulnerability” and the joy of dragon riding.\n\nHollywood\n\nHere: Robert Zemeckis’s New Movie Spans a Century, but the Camera Never Moves\n\nTom Hanks and Robin Wright reunite the Forrest Gump team for a drama set entirely in one household’s living room.\n\nCelebrity\n\nTowa Bird Wants to Be a New Kind of Rock Star\n\nOn her debut album, American Hero, the 25-year-old queer musician celebrates identity, joins the “lesbian renaissance,” and becomes the representation she never had.\n\nStyle\n\nAs Tensions Continue to Flare Over the War in Gaza, the Upper East Side Is Divided\n\nTalking about the war in Gaza is complicated for Jewish Americans, and in Manhattan’s wealthiest circles, disagreement has created social cloisters.\n\nRoyals\n\nRadhika Jones on Kate Middleton, King Charles, and the Royal Family’s Hard Year\n\nVF’s editor in chief reflects on the Windsors’ challenges, and shares her insights on that Taylor Swift class at Harvard.\n\nBusiness\n\n“I’m Not Naive”: Inside Emma Tucker’s Rocky Wall Street Journal Reboot\n\nThe British-born editor has injected America’s business paper of record with ambition and verve, while unnerving the newsroom with unapologetic cuts. The restructuring “may look callous,” she says. “But it’s so that we get it right, so I don’t have to do it over again.”"
