        "text": "Although Walt Disney Pictures is promoting “Bridge to Terabithia” as a family adventure, not a message picture, its two talented young stars – AnnaSophia Rob, 13, and Josh Hutcherson, 14 – believe it has plenty to say to people of all ages. “There are so many messages in the movie,” said AnnaSophia at her Philadelphia hotel during a publicity stop for “Bridge to Terabithia” (Disney; $29.99, DVD; $34.99, Blu-ray Disc), now in stores. “The big one is about never being too old to use your imagination.\n\n“You can always play pretend.”\n\nFor Josh, the movie also sheds light on a common problem among youths.\n\n“For me, the main message is about bullying,” said the teenage actor, who appeared with Robin Williams in “RV” and Tom Hanks in “The Polar Express.” “Sometimes, bullies have their own personal problems and you just have to wait for them to stop.\n\n“When I first started acting, kids were mean to me in school, because I was doing something different. That was in Kentucky, and it was hard, though I tried to rise above it.”\n\nIn “Bridge to Terabithia,” a teenage boy and girl form a friendship and, to escape from the real world, together create a magical fantasy kingdom that contains strange creatures, beautiful forests and dangerous enemies. The touching PG-rated tale is based on the Newbery Award-winning novel (1978) by Katherine Paterson.\n\n“Bridge to Terabithia” contains a climactic heart-breaking twist that may upset some children.\n\n“I think one thing the film says is that people should keep their minds open,” said AnnaSophia, who appeared opposite Johnny Depp in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” “You must be receptive to others and non-judgmental about them.”\n\nMuch of the film revolves around computer-generated images that were inserted into the film after the live-action scenes were completed.\n\nJosh was accustomed to that approach since he had a similar experience on “The Polar Express.”\n\n“That film was done in a motion-capture process in which you must wear special suits and then imagine what was there,” Josh said. “I learned a lot about patience (while waiting for the special-effects experts to approve the footage). You had to get up early and sit around all day.”\n\nFor AnnaSophia, her first special-effects picture proved a challenge.\n\n“I felt a bit goofy during the shooting because I was looking at nothing and had to pretend that something was there and just do it,” said the teenager, who named Oscar-winner Charlize Theron as her favorite actress. “When I saw the finished version of ‘Bridge to Terabithia,’ I said, ‘So that’s what I was looking at!'”\n\nClassic Collections\n\n“Cult Camp Classics: Volumes 1 to 4” (Warner; $29.99 each, DVD; June 26). “Volume 1: “Sci-Fi Thrillers” with “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,” “Queen of Outer Space” and “The Giant Behemoth;” “Volume 2: Women in Peril” with “The Big Cube,” “Caged” and “Trog;” “Volume 3: Terrorized Travelers” with “Hot Rods to Hell,” “Skyjacked” and “Zero Hour;” and “Volume 4: Historical Epics” with “The Colossus of Rhodes,” “Land of the Pharaohs” and “The Prodigal.”\n\nAll titles in the “Cult Camp Classics” series have been digitally re-mastered and contain the original theatrical trailer. Each title is also available individually ($14.99 each).\n\n“Comedy Classics” series (Fox; $19.99 each, DVD; now available) with “Charley’s Aunt” (1939) starring Jack Benny, “The Three Musketeers” (1941) starring Don Ameche and the double-bill of “Thank You, Jeeves!” (1936) and “Step Lively, Jeeves!” (1937) with Arthur Treacher.\n\n“The Masutatsu Oyama Trilogy” (BCI; $24.99, DVD; June 26) with Quentin Tarantino favorite Sonny Chiba (“Kill Bill, Vol. 1”) in three – “Karate Bull Fighter,” “Karate Bear Fighter” and “Karate For Life” – martial arts titles.\n\nThe trilogy focuses on Chiba’s real-life teacher, Masutatsu Oyama, who founded Kyokushin Karate in Japan. All of the titles are presented in their uncut original versions with anamorphic wide-screen images and in Japanese with subtitles.\n\n“The Stephen King DVD Collector’s Set” (MGM; $39.99, DVD; July 3), which contains “Misery” with Kathy Bates and James Caan, “Needful Things” with Ed Harris,” “The Dark Half” with Timothy Hutton and “Carrie” with Sissy Spacek and John Travolta. The titles will also be individually ($14.99 each).\n\nA ‘Blu’-tiful ‘Rider’\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc version of the box-office hit “Ghost Rider” (Sony; $38.99; now available) must be seen to be believed.\n\nSome people may criticize the offbeat plot, which is based on the Marvel Comic about a daredevil motorcycle rider who sells his soul to the devil, but the image absolutely sparkles and Nicolas Cage (“National Treasure”) delivers an enjoyably eccentric performance. He proves fun to watch, as does this unrated “Extended Cut” on Blu-ray.\n\nEva Mendes (“Hitch”), Sam Elliott (“The Big Lebowski”) and Peter Fonda (“Easy Rider”) co-star in “Ghost Rider.” In the film, Cage’s character sparks into a flaming superhero/ skeleton whenever other demons appear.\n\nThe extras on the sparkling Blu-ray Disc include three making-of featurettes and commentary with writer-director Mark Steven Johnson and other behind-the-scenes talents.\n\nNow Playing!\n\nThe following DVD titles either are coming soon or recently landed at a video store near you.\n\nIf your local outlet doesn’t stock them, the DVD offerings can be mail ordered by calling (800) 523-0823 or going to the Web site moviesunlimited.com or amazon.com, unless otherwise noted.\n\nMovies\n\n“Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon” (Anchor Bay; $26.99, DVD; June 26) with Robert Englund (“A Nightmare on Elm Street”) in an R-rated fright film about a serial killer who allows a documentary filmmaker to chronicle his murderous deeds.\n\n“Black Snake Moan” (Paramount; $29.99, DVD; June 26) with Samuel L.
