        "text": "Following the success of 2023’s Barbie, Mattel has planned its next big-screen film with Bob the Builder. The beloved British animated series, which ran for twelve seasons (from 1999 to 2011), is going to get the movie treatment, with Jennifer Lopez behind the producer’s chair. For those who don’t know, Bob the Builder is a contractor specializing in masonry with a can-do attitude, often asking the audience, “Can we fix it?” Then, egging on the other characters and audience to respond, “Yes, we can!” The new animated feature film has cast Anthony Ramos as the voice of the titular character, who will be Latino in this modern adaptation of the character.\n\nBob the Builder follows Roberto (AKA Bob), who travels to Puerto Rico for a major construction job. According to the official logline, audiences will see Bob as he “takes on issues affecting the island and digs deeper into what it means to build. Bob’s journey will celebrate the vibrant and colorful textures of the Caribbean Latin nations and their people.” No director or release date has been announced as of yet. Ramos tells Variety that Bob the Builder carries an “important message,” adding that his own life inspired elements of the film.\n\nRELATED: Ryan Gosling Calls Out Margot Robbie ‘Barbie’ Oscars Snubs\n\nCo-producer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas says the film will put “a new spin on a beloved brand” with a “completely original story” set in Puerto Rico. She adds that the film will maintain the show’s ability to promote positive thinking, problem-solving, and empowerment. Bob the Builder is the first Mattel film in development following the award-winning Barbie film. Upcoming films include American Girl, a live-action Barney movie starring Daniel Kaluuya, Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots starring Vin Diesel, Polly Pocket starring Lily Collins, Hot Wheels, Magic 8 Ball, Major Matt Mason, Masters of the Universe, Matchbox, Thomas & Friends, Uno, View-Master, and Wishbone. Mattel Films is developing Christmas Balloon, a holiday family drama based on an all-new IP. The company’s first theatrical release was Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which grossed $1.4 billion globally.\n\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\n\nPeople born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.\n\nLeos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.\n\nSome of the most iconic actors and comedians were born in the month of July.
