McKenzie may be a repeat offender indeed: TMZ reported that he previously pleaded guilty to two other counts of trespassing and was arrested several times for lurking around the University of California Los Angeles campus.\n\nKendall isn't the only Jenner with unwanted houseguests.

In December 2015, TMZ reported that a trespasser tried strong-arming his way into Jenner's home in her gated community in Calabasas, Calif.

He left the premises, but police tracked him down after reportedly finding notes from him in her home, including disturbing missives professing his love for Del Rey, as well as a notice to appear citation from a burglary in Kansas.

Self must also stay away from Del Rey for 10 years.\n\nIn January 2016, TMZ reported that Del Rey obtained a restraining order against two other fans, Nataliia Krinitsyna and Iuliia Vladimirovna.

Del Rey claimed to have moved to get away from the girls, who persisted in their campaign to harass her. Now they have to stay at least 150 yards away from the singer and her assistants for three years.\n\nThere was nothing funny about David Letterman's stalker. In 1988, Margaret Mary Ray was arrested for stealing Letterman's Porsche and claiming to be his wife. She was arrested several times for stalking the Late Show host since the first incident, spanning years of trespassing on his property and harassing him. Her actions weren't without consequences. The New York Times reports she spent 10 months in jail and more than a year in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, it was to no avail: in 1998, the troubled Ray committed suicide by kneeling in front of an oncoming train, the Times reported.\n\nConan O'Brien's stalker was actually a priest. CBS News reports that Rev. David Ajemian was arrested in November 2007 for stalking the late-night funnyman over a period of 14 months, often sending him threatening letters on parish letterhead and even contacting O'Brien's parents. Ajemian's letters to O'Brien included references to Harvard University, which O'Brien and Ajemian both attended, as well as demands for \"a spot on [O'Brien's] couch\" and threats like, \"Is this the way you treat your most dangerous fans?\" The final straw was when Ajemian was busted at 30 Rockefeller Center for trying to get into a taping of O'Brien's show. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was ordered to stay away from O'Brien.\n\nThree years later, Ajemian spoke out on the allegations to Fox News. \"I think that if I thought I could get an extra ticket, go into the audience, he would recognize me and perhaps find the whole situation somewhat amusing,\" Ajemian said, adding, \"I think I said 'I'm your most dangerous fan' or something...Meaning was that being a priest and someone who had this inside connection to his life a little bit, there was something dangerous about the idea of having a priest on a show like that. That's actually what I meant by that line.\" Ajemian added that he thinks his actions were influenced by a prescription medication and continued, \"I am not a stalker. That word I take to mean somebody who's hiding around bushes, sending explicitly homicidal or dangerous communications and it's just not the case with me at all.\"\n\nBassey Essien was allegedly convinced that he wasn't actually stalking Beyoncé, but an impostor who killed the real singer. The New York Daily News reported that Essien, a U.K. native, tried giving Beyoncé a book he'd made about religion in 2009. He continued harassing her until she got a protective order against him in 2011. However, that may not have been the end. The Sun reported that Queen Bey increased security at her U.K. performances of the Mrs. Carter Tour in 2013 after she began receiving suspicious letters that were similar to the ones she'd received previously from Essien.\n\nSinger Joss Stone's stalkers were particularly terrifying. E! News reported that in 2011, Junior Bradshaw and Kevin Liverpool were arrested near Stone's home after neighbors called the police on the suspicious characters. Thank heaven they did, because these guys were dangerous: when police apprehended Bradshaw and Liverpool, the men reportedly had a samurai sword, a hammer, knives, black bags, and gloves. They allegedly planned to decapitate the \"Super Duper Love\" singer and leave her body in a river, all supposedly because she was invited to perform at the royal wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William. Bradshaw was sentenced to 18 years in prison (reduced to 10 years on appeal), and Liverpool was sentenced to life (with a minimum of 10 years and eight months behind bars, which was later cut to a minimum of six years.)\n\nStone had a surprisingly levelheaded and calm response to the incident. She told the Mirror in 2015, \"I have no idea what that was about. But I would prefer it if they stayed inside. I'd feel less nervous about being chopped up. That's not something I want on a Monday morning! It is unsafe to have people who want to kill people roaming the streets, I suppose. They didn't do it, but that doesn't mean they didn't want to do it.\"\n\nActress Uma Thurman said in 2008 that she was \"completely freaked out\" by her stalker, Jack Jordan, who had a history of mental illness and was convicted of harassing and stalking the Kill Bill (2003) star from 2005 to 2007. The Daily Mail reported that Jordan reportedly sent Thurman disturbing cards and letters, called her office and cellphone, tried getting into her trailer on a movie set, and even showed up at her New York City apartment.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Jordan was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital in 2005 after he was questioned about his obsession with the actress, telling investigators, \"My intention was for a kind of relationship to develop between us,\" admitting that he'd overstepped legal bounds.\n\nIn 2010, he was arrested again for violating a restraining order after he attempted to contact Thurman's office and assistants. He was reportedly Googling Thurman when police arrived to arrest him, the Daily Mail reported. According to the New York Daily News, Jordan agreed to a mandatory two-year outpatient psychiatric program in 2011 and was living with his parents in Maryland.\n\nIn 2001, a judge ordered Matthew Hooker to leave Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman alone after he repeatedly sent her letters and poems and contacted her at home offering to tutor her kids, take her to the ballet, and buy her ice cream. Kidman claimed his actions made her and her kids \"fearful for [their] safety and security.\"\n\nInstead of dropping it, Hooker flipped out at Kidman in the media. \"This woman has severely wronged me,\" Hooker told ABC News. \"There is no reason at all to have a restraining order against me. I've never threatened anyone. I'm a gentleman.\" He told E! News, \"All I know is, I've never been violent. I've never been angry, I've never harassed anyone,\" adding, \"I tried to meet a woman and date a woman and that's all. I don't want my good name smeared with the name 'stalker.' I don't know why she has told these lies about me but they are very unjust and I deny almost everything on the complaint.\" He continued, \"I was attracted to her. I wrote her a love poem. I wrote her a letter. I went by her house to ask to take her to the ballet and to take her kids out to ice cream. That's it.\"\n\nHooker is apparently such a hopeless romantic that he has a record of this behavior: E! News reported he previously attempted to have an \"Easter holiday\" with model Claudia Schiffer, who promptly told cops he was persona non grata.\n\nIn 2004, Dawnette Knight, an aspiring psychologist (yes, really) was charged with 25 counts of stalking Catherine Zeta-Jones for more than a year. People reported that Knight sent letters threatening to kill the actress to Zeta-Jones, to her husband, Michael Douglas, and to Douglas' father, Kirk Douglas. Knight reportedly even called Michael's mother, Diana Douglas, at a hotel in Bermuda. Knight claimed to be \"infatuated\" with MIchael and to have had an affair with him, alleging he offered to pay her to keep quiet. None of those claims were true, but Knight seemed determined to make Fatal Attraction (1987) a reality.\n\nUSA Today reported that Knight was sentenced to three years in prison in July 2005. That remedy was not necessarily comforting to Zeta-Jones. In a letter her attorney read at Knight's sentencing, the Chicago (2002) star said, \"You have profoundly affected me in how I conduct my life...Your actions will be with me the rest of my life—how I will be constantly observing, looking over my shoulder.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's stalker, Justin Massler, just won't quit. According to the Daily Mail, he was busted in 2010 for stalking Donald Trump's daughter at her jewelry boutique and sending her threatening and disturbing emails, videos, and tweets. Massler reportedly claimed in 2011 that aliens were responsible for his actions, admitting that he \"can't stop bothering her.\" He faced four years in prison on criminal contempt charges after telling the court that his address was \"a volcano in Hawaii,\" the Daily Mail reported. He was sentenced to six months in prison, five years of probation, and mandatory psychiatric care.\n\nIn 2012, Massler was diagnosed with schizophrenia and medicated, at which point he was deemed capable to stand trial, reported the Daily Mail. Unfortunately, the trouble didn't stop: Massler reportedly emailed Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, saying, \"I won't be ignored.\" Page Six reported that in November 2014, Massler violated his probation when he emailed Kushner's brother and traveled to New York without permission. In September 2016, Massler was reportedly released on $10,000 bail and ordered to stay away from the Trumps and all their ilk.\n\nDonald Trump told People, \"He's got really big problems, and the things he wrote and said were really terrible and at the worst level, where the police said they've never seen anything quite as bad. He's a really sick guy...So, we're handling it!\"\n\nJodie Foster's stalker, John Hinckley Jr., was especially terrifying. In 1981, Hinckley reportedly attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in his attempt to impress a then-17-year-old Foster, reported USA Today. Hinckley had followed Foster to college at Yale University and sent her love letters, including one on the day he shot Reagan that read, \"As you well know by now I love you very much. Over the past seven months I've left you dozens of poems, letters and love messages in the faint hope that you could develop an interest in me...At least you know that I'll always love you. Jodie, I would abandon this idea of getting Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out the rest of my life with you, whether it be in total obscurity or whatever...\"\n\nHinckley was declared not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity and spent 35 years in a mental hospital. The Associated Press (via the Los Angeles Times) reports that Hinckley, who had to be sedated when Foster came out of the closet as a lesbian, was released on Sept. 10, 2016, on orders that he remain with his mother in Williamsburg, Va. and have no contact with the Reagans or Fosters.\n\nIn 2005, a homeless man was busted for attempting to swim naked across Biscayne Bay to tennis star Anna Kournikova's seaside home in Miami, allegedly convinced that she'd left her house unlocked and had dry clothes waiting for him. According to The Telegraph, neighbors saw the man, William Lepeska, sitting nude in a lounge chair at the wrong house, screaming, \"Anna, save me!\" Kournikova told a jury that Lepeska had been writing sexually explicit and disturbing letters and messages to her via mail and on her website for quite some time before the incident occurred.\n\nIn court, Lepeska, who showed off a tattoo of Kournikova's name, told the jury, \"I thought Anna possibly had some sincere regard for me. I had all sorts of delusional assumptions about Anna...I don't know what is true and what is not true about the celebrities, the beloveds. I had no idea the letters were being opened by her step-sisters. Had I known, my behaviour would have been different,\" reported The Telegraph. He added that he was once in love with former Spice Girl Melanie \"Mel B.\" Brown for five years, but decided, \"The heck with her, moving on to greener pastures.\" He must now stay 1,000 feet away from the tennis pro forever, The Telegraph said.\n\nIn 2005, a homeless man was sentenced to three years in prison for stalking actor Mel Gibson, reported People. According to the magazine, Zack Sinclair repeatedly showed up uninvited at Gibson's Malibu compound, where the actor has a home, school, and chapel, saying he wanted to have mass with the Oscar winner and chat about The Passion of the Christ (2004). Sinclair represented himself in court, where a judge recommended he get psychiatric care during his sentencing. People reported that Gibson was disturbed, but surprisingly understanding. \"I realized we were probably dealing with someone fairly deluded,\" he said. \"My wife was upset and worried. She didn't want to find him in the living room drinking tea.\"\n\nPaula Goodspeed was reportedly so obsessed with pop star Paula Abdul that in 2006, she auditioned for American Idol when Abdul was on the panel of judges. The tryout didn't go well. In 2008, Goodspeed committed suicide only a few doors down from Abdul's home. After her death, Abdul told Access Hollywood that Goodspeed had pursued her for years. \"When I heard from [Idol creator] Nigel [Lythgoe], 'Wait 'til you see this next girl! Oh my God, she changed her name for you,' and I saw her name, I got really nervous,\" Abdul said. \"She had been a stalker from [awhile back.] And the thing is, that all she could do was get a hold of me through my fan club. Now, there's access to follow me home and I [had] a really scary situation and it's time for me to move. It's not like I'm moving just because of this. My address was announced and [it was shown] how you could get into my house.\"\n\nAbdul did make clear that she did not feel guilt over Goodspeed's death. \"I didn't do anything [to cause the suicide],\" she told Access Hollywood. \"I went through a very rough time of feeling like she wanted my attention so much...I shed a lot of tears. It was tumultuous for me. [I'm] living with security full time now, it's just different.\"\n\nSinger Leona Lewis has had two terrible experiences with unnamed stalkers. Life & Style reported that she had to move to a different house in Los Angeles after a paparazzo wouldn't stop harassing her at home. Then, at a book signing, a crazed fan actually punched the X Factor winner in the face! \"It was very shocking. He attacked me out of the blue. He was very unwell,\" the British belter said. \"It was really random, something that was done by a very ill person. It wasn't fun—I was extremely hurt and upset.\"\n\nActor Alec Baldwin was pestered and pursued for a long time by stalker and wannabe actress Genevieve Sabourin. According to the New York Daily News, Sabourin claimed she had an affair with Baldwin, which the 30 Rock (2006-13) star adamantly denied. When he wouldn't sweep her off of her feet, she reportedly harassed the actor and his wife, Hilaria, and showed up uninvited at their home in New York in 2012. In November 2013, Sabourin was sentenced to seven months in prison for what the judge in the case deemed a \"relentless and escalating campaign of threats and in-person appearances in private spaces served at a minimum to harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Baldwin,\" the New York Daily News reported.\n\nIn March 2014, a stalker who claimed to be reality star Kim Kardashian's boyfriend was arrested after he showed up at her mom Kris Jenner's home in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported. TMZ said the man also claimed to be Kendall Jenner's boyfriend and Justin Bieber's stepbrother. The suspect not only made it onto the property, but got close enough to be able to peek through windows. Since Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in September 2016, chances are her expanded security detail will prevent anyone from getting close enough to do that ever again.\n\nSteven Spielberg had a harrowing experience with a stalker in 1997 when former bodybuilder Jonathan Norman was arrested outside of the legendary director's home for felony stalking. CNN reported that Norman had a litany of sadomasochistic tools in his vehicle at the time of the arrest, which he intended to use on Spielberg. \"No one before has ever come into my life in a way to do me harm,\" Spielberg said at the time, reported CNN. \"I think he's on a mission and he won't be satisfied until he accomplishes the mission, and I think I am the subject of the mission. I didn't want this individual to put me or my family through the anguish, the nightmares I've had because of this.\" Spielberg added, \"I've had fans and I've had people who've been a little pushy before, but not people with handcuffs and duct tape and knives and maps to my home. I feel to this day that I am prey to this individual.\"\n\nNorman, who had two prior felony convictions, had reportedly told police he intended to rape Spielberg. According to the Los Angeles Times, Norman was found guilty of felony stalking and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. At the sentencing, Spielberg said, \"I genuinely in my heart of hearts believe I could have been raped, maimed or killed. The same thing could have happened to my wife or kids. If he's out on the street, I will live in fear that he is prowling around the neighborhood.\"\n\nMark Billingham, the former head of Brangelina's security team, says Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie had a really creepy stalker situation that she didn't even realize. \"We had stalkers in Chicago and New York which I had to deal with,\" Billingham told The Sun. \"Angie was filming in a crowd and everyone's got smiles on their faces except for one guy. He looked angry. A few days later we were coming off set, and this guy came running down the road with photos to be signed. Angie wanted to get out of the vehicle and do it but I said no. I went and got the photos and took them to her. She was like, 'Wow, these are personal photos.' The guy ran off then reappeared days later near the hotel, so I got him arrested.\" Billingham continued. \"He'd been following Angie all over the States. To me, it was a John Lennon classic. Whenever she was on her own in pictures, he was smiling. Then whenever she was with Brad, he had this angry look on his face.\""
