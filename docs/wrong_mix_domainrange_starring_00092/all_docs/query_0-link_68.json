        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nThanks for starting this. I was about to do so myself, as this was one of my favorite PSF threads.\n\nHere's a few:\n\n--I'd rather die in blazing heat than blistering cold. Extreme freezing is the worst feeling there is--the ultimate loneliness as far as your atoms are concerned.\n\n--I've been listening to a lot of the Joe Rogan show lately. Love that guy--great sense of humor, open-minded, great radio voice, willing to let guests talk but respectfully questions them if they make an unfounded claim. I'd highly recommend checking him out.\n\n--Sometimes I wonder if Im on the autistic spectrum, but then other times I feel like that's just me being a hypochondriac and looking for an excuse for my eccentricities.\n\n--I think the way we live today is the exact opposite of how we were meant to. Not just in like a Late Capitalism/\"money is evil!!\" way, but just a bunch of little things. We are on average a lot more lonely, anxious, depressed and insecure these days. I think it's partly because we dont have a big social function like the Romans did with their public bathes anymore. Everything is proprietary and if you're not already meeting people you know there, it's bad for meeting new people. The modern replacement is social media, which just encourages comparisons between your life and other people's highlight reel. Plus it gives away all your data to god knows who and diminishes communication down to image macros and 140 character tweets.\n\nAlso largely due to Social Media is we're more tribalistic and quick to outrage and public shaming someone online. We send children to these schools where they get bullied and left with lifelong emotional scars. To an extent thats always happened but I feel like now it's worse due to cyberbullying, larger class sizes, teachers overwhelmed and without authority and zero tolerance if you fight back.\n\nIn one of the JR episodes, he was talking about how nowadays couples spend more time apart than ever before, and the awkwardness of knowing your wife is probably being hit on at work, maybe pressured for favors by her boss if not getting attracted to him as he's in a position of power, or that sneaky coworker talking shit on you and trying to cozy up to her behind your back. We used to live in supportive tribes where everyone had each other's back, now we separate ourselves into various enclaves where our loved ones are debased and we can do nothing to protect them, or even enjoy their company for most of the day.\n\nThese are just a few examples because this could be a ten paragraph rant in itself. I'm not an advocate of strict Anarcho-Primitivism but I do agree that civilization was a double edged sword. This is why Ian Malcolm's morphine-induced rants at the end of Jurassic Park (the novel, not the dumbed down movie) are one of, if not the greatest monologue in literature.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@iluvleniloud said:\n\n--Sometimes I wonder if Im on the autistic spectrum, but then other times I feel like that's just me being a hypochondriac and looking for an excuse for my eccentricities.\n\nH'mm. Just from what you've said and done on Smiley, PSF and here, I'd put my money on those other times.\n\nYour \"eccentricities\" are what make you stand out from the pack--in a positive sense. You should treasure them.\n\nOK... rant over.\n\nThanks. I wouldnt mind if it turned out I was on the spectrum, but I feel like Im being silly and the only reason I think that is because of my obsessive interests in singular topics which last up to a year each (SMiLE is the one that brought me here) as well as this Leni fanfic. I keep reading and thinking \"dude...that was me.\" But it's not like this random fanfic writer really knows how to depict it accurately.\n\nThis is probably a topic that's too personal to begin a thread like this on. Im sorry.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\njk Thanks\n\nI guess to get things going in a new direction I'll add this: So Ive been reading about quantum field theory lately and apparently the universe could be in a metastable state depending on the mass of the Higgs boson and Up quark particles. If true, this means our universe is temporary and given enough time will revert into a more simplified, stable state where no atoms besides Hydrogen can exist. (Im obviously simplifying it a lot.)\n\nWe still dont know what exactly causes gravity. There's a theory it's guided by a particle in the same way the other 3 fundamental forces are also mediated by 4 different gauge bosons.\n\nThe names of all this quarks (called \"flavors\") makes me feel like physicists chose the most ridiculous names they could just for the fuck of it: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange, Charm. The color charges... Gluons...it's like they were playing a game naming this shit. Speaking of names, I hate that an antimatter electron has a special name (positron) but then antimatter protons and neutrons aren't like... Negatrons and Centrons or something. Just \"antiprotons\" and \"antineutrons.\" Like the rest of particle physics has these bizarre \"we dont give a fuck, we made it up\" names but not these.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIts funny when you see remnants of Christmas in mid January - the clearance aisle at the store or the random house still lit up. Its like seeing the ruins of a lost time.\n\nI know I'm in the minority, but I would like to see the Christmas holiday season go longer! First, you spend so much time putting up the decorations - the Christmas tree, outside lights/fixtures, and sentimental things displayed around the house that you have to unpack/pack - hey, I want to enjoy them for as long as possible before I pack 'em up again. Second, after all of the sometimes exhausting \"hustle and bustle\" of the season, I want to sit back and just chill out (no pun intended) and take it all in more. Third, the day after Christmas, most of the Christmas music disappears from stores, the radio, and homes. Noooooooooo! That music is too great and should continue to be featured. OK, you could filter out some of the specific Christmasey songs featuring Santa Claus, Rudolph, and toys. But there are so many winter/seasonal songs that still sound great in late December, January, and even February.\n\nPost by kds on\n\n@sheriff said:\n\nIts funny when you see remnants of Christmas in mid January - the clearance aisle at the store or the random house still lit up. Its like seeing the ruins of a lost time.\n\nI know I'm in the minority, but I would like to see the Christmas holiday season go longer!

The season goes so fast that I want to stretch it out.\n\nI usually take some time off to relax a bit after Christmas Day, but while my decorations stay up til New Years, I just cant bring myself to listen to the music or watch the shows and movies after the 25th.\n\nPost by drbeachboy (Dirk) on\n\nI didn't \"take it personally\". I say what I see - people prefer to talk with people they either got used to talk with or who they absolutely like. I think it's very limited. Somebody may say they don't have time but then I see they reply - in details to boot - to the other poster. If you don't have time to reply, shouldn't it be equally no time to reply to everybody? Or it just looks like \"time for this & that posters except that & that posters\". This is general example, I'd seen it many times in the Internet.\n\nBut OK. It's not super big deal. Thanks, jk.\n\nSince SJS didn't answer, I shall ask it generally to everybody celebrating Christmas/ New Year - Why you, people, exactly decorate house/ the outside if it's technically not obligation? You may as well not do it, who'd care or frown at you if you don't? & many complain it's such chore to put the decorations back to boxes etc. Then don't decorate, then you'd be free of this additional, let's say, work.\n\nThanks in advance to the answers.\n\nI do it because I like the beauty of it. I enjoy the traditions associated with Christmas. I don't want those traditions to die off as it has with exchanging Christmas cards. There is nothing as special as receiving a card with a hand-written note and signature and knowing that the person who sent it thought you special enough to receive one.\n\nPost by John Manning on\n\nI think this happened many years ago, but never in my lifetime, and Im 38. We've always bought our milk in a plastic bottle or cardboard carton from the supermarket.\n\nBeach Boys Fan: In the UK we used to get our milk delivered to the door in glass bottles until the '60s or at the very latest the '70s. We paid for it but not exorbitantly. I remember the thing was to get the bottles in off the doorstep quickly because the birds used to peck a hole in the silver foil top to get at the cream! The slow-moving vehicle that delivered it was called a milk float.\n\nLast place we lived (Stainforth, where the village hall was cruelly overlooked by the Beach Boys 2012 tour), we got our milk delivered daily in glass bottles on the doorstep. We paid a small premium for the luxury but the milkman, Spike, got through any weather (in his 4x4 pickup) and he’d also bring orange juice (also in glass bottles), yoghurt, eggs and more if you ordered them. You could even adjust your milk order every day, without advance notice. Spike’s real name is Chris Eccleston, same as the actor who played Doctor Who in the 2005 revival: his moto, we’d joke, was “Tomorrow’s milk today” (it’s a time travel joke).\n\nWe live in Ingleton now (18 months +) and reluctantly get our milk in plastic jugs from the Coop convenience store at the petrol station. It’s just not the same. But I believe the local milkie now does deliveries daily so we might go back to that.\n\nWe have eggs delivered Monday evenings by a local farmer. Free range, very good value and delicious with proper orange yolks.\n\nBluetits don’t peck through the foil milk tops to get to the cream anymore, jk, because these days the milk is homogenised, or mixed and filtered so finely that the cream doesn’t separate and rise any more. The idea is that the bacteria’s filtered out to give it a longer shelf life but it’s not the same. Some folk believe that it’s so finely filtered now that the fat passes straight through your gut walk into your blood stream to clog your arteries and kill you faster.\n\nYou can buy non-homogenised, pasteurised organic milk but again at a premium and rarely via doorstep deliveries.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI think this happened many years ago, but never in my lifetime, and Im 38.

The slow-moving vehicle that delivered it was called a milk float.\n\nYeah, when I was a little kid the 1960's, we used to have a milkman. He came every four or five days. I still remember hearing the clinking of the glass bottles as he was putting them on our back porch in the early morning around 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM. We even had this silver metal Wengert's Dairy box/container on the porch where the milkman put the full bottles, then we placed the empties there which he picked up.\n\nI guess it was convenient. This was before convenience stores, though there still were mom & pop corner stores. But I can see why the milkman is a thing of the past. First, there was a delivery fee on top of the price of the milk. Then there was theft of the milk right off the porches. And, of course there were sanitary issues with milk sitting outside for long periods of time. I remember pouring warm milk on my cereal. It was nobody's fault; the milkman dropped the milk off at 5:00 AM but my Mom or Dad might've only brought it in around 7:00 AM. Oh, those were the days.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nTonight I was playing some Kirby's Adventure for my NES emulator and getting nostalgia pangs for playing this series with my little sister growing up.\n\nThe Kirby series is under-appreciated, though admittedly the easy difficulty hasn't helped. But I love how imaginative the series is, between being able to copy your enemies abilities and just the general landscapes you traverse. Mario games are pretty basic in terms of level settings, but in Kirby games you go to (among other places) a flying warship, a strawberry shaped castle floating in the sky and a black pyramid with circuitry running along the walls. It's somewhat hard to describe, but watch some gameplay footage of Kirby Super Star and especially Kirby's Dreamland 3 for the Super Nintendo to get a feel for what I mean. The art direction for that game in particular is beautiful and suitably childlike (the characters could be a child's doodles and some of the textures appear to have been drawn in by crayon.)\n\nWhat's especially relevant to this group is that this game though, is the music. They never seem to get the credit for it, but Kirby games have fantastic soundtracks--at least Dreamland 3 does. I particularly recommend Grass Land 4, Ripple Field 1, Ripple Field 3, Sand Canyons 1, two and three plus Dark Tower, Hyper Zone 1 and finally HZ2.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThe last two days, my girlfriend and I have been watching Neon Genesis Evangelion (first time for me, she's seen it before) and right now we're about halfway thru. For the uninitiated, it's an anime about giant fighting robots piloted by kids...because Japan. But despite the absurd premise it's really entertaining thus far--I like the character interactions, art style and Im told it gets really cerebral and profound later on.\n\nI like Asuka the best because of her adorable character design and loud personality. The other two kids who pilot the mechs are a sad sack boy (Shenji) and stiff as a board girl (Rei.) Asuka just radiates self confidence and sexual energy to a fault where Shenji is repressed and self-loathing. Watching her constantly belittle and emasculate Shinji is hilarious since it's so brazen and he just rolls over and accepts it. It happens almost every scene they're together but it makes me laugh despite myself every time. (I wanted to use different, specific examples of their dynamic but pickings are slim on YouTube.) Their back and forth kind of reminds me of Pip and Estella from Great Expectations as the female half is a remorseless and purposeful heart-breaker while the male half is insecure and feels unworthy of her.\n\nBut all the same, between episodes I told my girlfriend I want Shenji to stand up and assert himself in the face of this endless mockery. I want him to rise to the promise of his manhood and say \"I am man. I kill beasts with sticks. I build pyramids with stones. I fly to the moon and I make women scream my name!\" and then give Asuka and anyone else who dares to question his worth the business. He that slays mammoths was not meant to be dominated by an ornery hen. (She laughed and told me to keep watching...)\n\n(I couldn't decide which tagline was funnier/more applicable, so I edited them both together.)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@iluvleniloud said:\n\nI like Asuka the best because of her adorable character design and loud personality.

There's a real-life version of Pip and Estella here. Curiously, the lady in question is called Estelle.\n\nThanks for your kind words in your earlier reply, and for the interesting story here!\n\nAnother real life tale that somewhat fits the theme is that of George Washington Adams (grandson and son of two Presidents, named for the first). I have yet to hear of another historical figure who led such an unhappy, cuckolded, self-loathing existence. And I say all that with as much empathy as I can, because no one deserves what he went thru and with gentler parents it might not have happened at all.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThanks John.\n\nI dont think BBF did anything wrong. There was one post she made on the forum I thought was a dig at me, but after talking in private I believe she meant no harm. She hasnt said or done anything even half as brazenly confrontational as some other people across all three forums whove never been called out for it.\n\nI also dont think theres anything inherently wrong with not advertising who you are from forum to forum either. I didnt tell anybody I was Mujan at first after coming to PSF. This is because I wasnt sure if Id have been welcome if I had and I just wanted a fresh start--not being boxed in as \"the SMiLE poster\" or made to answer for everything Id ever said from the SS days. Its possible BBF felt similarly. Just food for thought."
