        "text": "The good, the bad, and the downright ugly of sequels to expect in the upcoming future. This list features sequels, but in some cases, we still have no idea what they’re about, or if they will be made into a film. We put an asterisk (*) after those that are rumored or that chances are, they won’t be hitting the big screen.\n\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey– December 14th, 2012\n\nIt’s not really a sequel, but rather a spin-off, which features the cast of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nA Good Day to Die Hard– February 14th, 2013\n\nRumored to be the final in the Die Hard series, Bruce Willis must fight Russian terrorists in Russia with his son.\n\nOz: The Great and Powerful– March 8th, 2013\n\nThis will actually be a prequel to the 1939 classic, depicting the story of how Oz came to be.\n\nG.I. Joe: Retaliation– March 29th, 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarring mostly everyone in the first movie, as well as Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson, the movie does lose a few characters, leaving just Channing Tatum. The plot revolves around the idea that the Joes still have to fight Cobra, while the government tries to shut them down.\n\nScary Movie 5– April 12th, 2013\n\nStarring Ashley Tisdale and Lindsay Lohan as dancers trying to get a raise.. . . (with Charlie Sheen of course)\n\nIron Man 3- May 3rd, 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Stark will go to China to fight Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), and that it will most likely be Robert Downey Jr.’s last time playing Iron Man. Also, Guy Pierce will be villain Aldrich Killian.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness- May 17th, 2013\n\nChris Pine and Zachary Quinto return as Kirk and Spock in this Star Trek sequel, which has rumored it will feature Benedict Cumberbatch (a British actor known for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) as the villain Khan.\n\nThe Hangover 3– May 24th, 2013\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMust I really explain this one?\n\nThe Fast and Furious 6– May 24th, 2013\n\nThe film has been rumored to take place after Tokyo Drift and will bring back the characters of Han and Lefty.\n\nMonsters University– June 21st, 2013\n\nThis could be considered a prequel, since it looks at Mike and Sulley’s friendship during college.\n\nKick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall– June 28th, 2013\n\nYou read that right, they’re making another Kick-Ass movie, and this time, it centers on the identities of the heroes, and the people who knew who they really are. Also, Jim Carrey will be starring as a colonel.\n\nDespicable Me 2– July 3rd, 2013\n\nStarring Al Pachino as the villain, the film is to show Gru’s life with the children.\n\nGrown Ups 2– July 12th, 2013\n\nThe movie will follow the events of the first, and mostly every actor has already signed on.\n\nThe Smurfs 2– July 31st, 2013\n\nThis will also follow the first, and will feature most of the actors in the first movie, as well as Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonathon Winters.\n\nThe Wolverine– July 26th, 2013\n\nThis is another spin-off stating the origins of Logan, where he travels to Japan to train.\n\n300: Rise of An Empire– August 2nd, 2013\n\nPrequel to 300, it stars new British actors Jack O’Connell and Sullivan Stapleton as Calisto and Themistocles.\n\nRed 2– August 2nd, 2013\n\nThis sequel will feature all the characters in the last film as well as Anthony Hopkins as the main villain. It is still rumored that Morgan Freeman will be in the film.\n\nRobocop– August 9th, 2013\n\nThis will be a spin-off-ish type from the original series starring Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nPercy Jackson: Sea of Monsters- August 16th, 2013\n\nThe movie will include most of the characters from the past movie and includes Stanley Tucci as Dionysus. The movie’s premise is that Percy Jackson and his friends travel through the Sea of Monsters so they can find the Golden Fleece.\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For– October 4th, 2013\n\nClive Owen’s character seeks revenge from Ava Lord, the woman who betrayed him, and Nancy must learn to live alone.\n\nThor: The Dark World– November 8th, 2013\n\nAgain, having pretty much all of the characters as the first movie, this sequel takes place after the events of The Avengers.\n\nThe Hunger Games Catching Fire– November 22nd, 2013\n\nI am in great confidence that most of you have read the books, and if not, have at least seen the movie. Well part 2 is basically winners vs. winners.\n\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug- December 13th, 2013\n\nThis takes place after The Hobbit, where Bilbo Baggins finds himself in trouble again.\n\nAnchorman 2– 2013\n\nWill Farrell announced on Conan that they are filming the film, and it the details are pretty well kept.\n\nBad Santa 2– 2013*\n\nThis will follow the events of the first movie and I doubt it will be made Billy Bob Thorton didn’t sign onto it, nor has there been any progress made available.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road –2013\n\nTaking over from Mel Gibson, Tom Hardy plans to play Mad Max in Fury Road, which will also feature Charlize Theron as Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux. There is also a rumor that director George Miller will film another Mad Max sequel after this one.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier– April 4th, 2014\n\nThis time, Captain America is in the modern world (if you don’t remember how the first one ended, he was frozen, melted, and placed in the modern Times Square by Samuel L. Jackson) and must take orders from S.H.I.E.L.D. as well as Nick Fury.\n\nRio 2– April 14th, 2014\n\nThe plot will revolve around the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the three chicks Blu and Jewel have- two boys and a girl who is afraid of flying.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2– May 2nd, 2014\n\nAnnounced before the first movie came out, most of the cast has already signed on, but little is known about the movie.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes– May 23rd, 2014\n\nThe plot is currently unknown at the time but it is certain a sequel will be made since it was a wide success.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2– June 20th, 2014\n\nThe plot is still unknown but most of the characters are back and Kit Harington will play the villain.\n\nTransformers 4– June 27th, 2014 *\n\nWhile we know it will be made, Michael Bay is trying to cut costs on his budget (too little explosions we suppose) and we put the asterisk because we know for sure it will go over. He stated that the film will most likely go into space and that he wants the past three films to be part of the past, and this one to be a totally different idea.\n\nThe Hobbit: There and Back Again– July 18th, 2014\n\nSince they already planned a third Hobbit sequel without the first one being released, and since no one has signed on to be cast in this, we will have to wait to see if it will be made.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past- July 18th, 2014\n\nThis is not the “regular” X-Men series, but the First Class spin-off (where we see the young Professor X and Magneto), and takes place after the events of the previous move. Since the title is also the title of a well-known X-Men comic book, we can somewhat guess that the movie will follow the events of the comic. The comic takes place during the 1980s, where an important government official is assassinated, leading to mutants basically becoming slaves.\n\nCloudy 2: Revenge of the Leftovers– September 27th, 2014\n\nAfter seeing the first movie, I’m ok for a second one, but after reading the title, I realized a terrible thing- either there wasn’t any better idea to milk the movie.. . or I’m getting old. I’ll go with the former.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1- November 21st, 2014\n\nThis will be like an ongoing series ending theme (like the Harry Potter Series or Twilight, they are ending the last book in two parts- just to milk it a bit more). It will be the first part of the (SPOILER) revolts.\n\nBlade Runner 2- 2014\n\nRidley Scott has Hampton Fancher, the original screenwriter of Blade Runner, writing the script for this next sequel, which will take place a few years after the first (try almost 20) and will feature a female hero.\n\nBond 24- 2014\n\nWell, since Bond movies are made 2 years apart, it seems logical that another Bond movie will be made in 2014 (despite disagreements between the last 2008 Bond movie and this year). Danial Craig has signed on to reprise his role, but it still remains untitled with no synopsis.\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Magician’s Nephew– 2014\n\nThat’s right folks, the fourth Narnia movie will come out in 2014, and when it was written, it was considered the first prequel. The book is about a boy and a girl who go exploring through a magician’s attic who has rings that are magical. The rings allow the duo to go into a separate world filled with lakes ( which act as portals) that allow them to go through different worlds.\n\nDumb and Dumber To– 2014 *\n\nWhile some liked it and some hated it, you had to at least smile at the title. The film goes on and off, Jeff Daniels states there will be a sequel while Jim Carrey turned down the role, and the script has never been officially settled on. But both have signed on to reprise their roles, if there is a sequel.\n\nJurassic Park 4– Summer 2014\n\nAgain, nothing is known, but Steven Spielberg has stated at the 2011 SDCC that the film will be made within the next 2-3 years.\n\nToy Story 4- 2014 or After\n\nConfirmed by Tom Hanks, the movie is actually angering fans because they believed the third was the final movie, and when asked, Pixar brings attention to Monster’s University. But most of the actors have signed on.\n\nZoolander 2– 2014\n\nBen Stiller and Owen Wilson return to reprise their roles, with Jonah Hill as a unknown role. And for all you True Blood fans, Alexander Skarsgard will return (yes, return .. . he was one of the models killed in the gas scene), making it seem to be a prequel.\n\nThe Avengers 2– May 1st, 2015\n\nThe movie will definitely be made (nowadays, sequels are made on success, not on creativity), and it has been rumored to take place after Captain America,. . .so doesn’t that make it a prequel?\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2- November 20th 2015\n\nThis will be the part two of the ending of The Hunger Games series.\n\nAvatar 2- 2015\n\nNot much is known, although, knowing just how involved James Cameron is with his movies, he plans to film in the Challenger Deep region of the Marianna Trench, which is 7 miles under water, which is also the deepest place on earth.\n\nAvatar 3 & 4- After the 2015 Sequel *\n\nJames Cameron has stated on and off that he will or will not be making the next 3 sequels. Sigourney Weaver as stated that she is filming all three sequels- but what if one bombs? I personally respect Cameron’s decision- he has stated that he will only be making his movies (the ones that he writes) and it is a good marketing strategy since he is taking success of the first film to make 3 more films, instead of waiting for each individual film’s turnout.\n\nStar Wars: Episode VII– 2015\n\nI’m sure we all heard of the recent events with George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney, so this was a no-brainer. Disney is planning to make 2-3 Lucsafilm movies a year, so let’s just see how that works out.\n\nFinding Nemo 2– 2016 *\n\nWhile we’re down Pixar memory lane, we might as well address the Finding Nemo 2 sequel. Nothing is known, and we’re not even sure if they’re making the rumor, since Pixar does stay quiet about these things.\n\n21 Jump Street 2– No Idea\n\nAll we do know is that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have signed on for the sequel.\n\n28 Months Later- No Idea*\n\nYes, the film will follow 28 Days later and 28 Weeks Later. While we’re pretty sure that it will be made, we also know they will make a “28 Years Later” and a “28 Decades Later,” and who knows, maybe even a “28 Centuries Later.” Anyhow, there is no one affiliated with it and the director of 28 Days Later (the producer of 28 Weeks Later) Danny Boyle has said it might happen.\n\nAustin Powers 4- No Idea*\n\nOk, I know this will be made. I mean, look at the success the past 3 movies kinda had. (Note, by success, I don’t mean if people liked it, I mean the amount of people who went to see it and say they liked/hated it). So of course this will be made, but for now, there is no one attached except Mike Myers himself.\n\nBad Boys 3- No Idea\n\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence have signed on to presumably the last movie in the series. However, Will Smith recently stated that he would only do sequels if the fans persisted and wanted him to do sequels.\n\nBeetlejuice 2– No Idea *\n\nTim Burton has stated that he will make the movie, but only if Michael Keaton will star in it, and only if Seth Grahame-Smith’s script appeals to Burton. Since Smith wrote Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, we can pretty much rule out a second Beetlejuice movie.\n\nThe Departed 2- No Idea*\n\nI only included this one because I really enjoyed the first one- and hopefully one of you will stick to the very end of this post and go find out some more details. Unlike the other times when I say there is no information, I mean this literally for this case- no people are involved, there aren’t any news articles nor an appropriate title or date. (I’m not going to add it, but they’re making The Blair Witch Project 3)\n\nGhostbusters 3- No Idea\n\nDan Aykroyd has basically stated that he’s making this movie so future, younger actors will get to be recast in this series- with a new premise of course. So while it’s being made because of commercial success, Sigourney Weaver stated that her son (in the movie) will grow up to become a Ghost Buster and take over Bill Murray’s spot (since he’s not starring in this one).\n\nGreen Lantern 2– No Idea*\n\nThe movie did fairly ok in theaters, so a sequel is not totally out of the question. But the fact that there is no date nor anyone signed on, we doubt it will be made.\n\nHancock 2– No Idea\n\nLittle is known, but it is confirmed that Will Smith and Charlize Theron will return.\n\nI Am Legend 2- No Idea*\n\nWhat I remember from the first movie is that Will Smith dies saving that mom and son duo who had previously saved him (but also caused him to die in the first place. . so they owe him). While the film will be made and a script is in development, the asterisk is for Smith, since he has stated that he would not like to do a prequel, but if the script is great, than he would do it.\n\nIndiana Jones 5- No Idea *\n\nThe idea has been around for the past 3 years, Harrison Ford believes he is too old, but wouldn’t mind playing one last time, and the script “has been written and reedited” several times- all while George Lucas must ok it and be the overseer. Honestly, as much as I want another Indiana Jones, I very much doubt that it will bring unexpected hype- I just wish they would cover up the mistakes of the fourth one. Also, producer Frank Marshall stated that due to Lucasfilm being sold to Disney, movement will made on Indiana Jones 5 after Star Wars: Episode 7.\n\nJumper 2- No Idea*\n\nJust like the rest, there is no one involved and it has only been rumored to be true.\n\nKill Bill Volume 3– No Idea\n\nQuentin Tarantino returns to end (again, rumored) the Kill Bill series, and the “opening script” on IMDB states that it’s basically a looping revenge story in a looping revenge story. Nikki (the young girl raised) will seek revenge from her mom as The Bride takes revenge from . . Nikki’s mom.\n\nMission Impossible 5- No Idea\n\nOf course this movie is being made! With Ghost Protocal bringing newer audiences to the franchise, Tom Cruise will be Ethan Hawke another time. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are also rumored to star in the movie.\n\nNatural Treasure 3– No Idea *\n\nWhile there is a good chance that the film will be made, there is little known about the film and the only two actors confirmed are Nicholas Cage and Jon Voight.\n\nPrometheus 2– No Idea *\n\nJust like Terminator 5, there is nothing to account for it, not even a person as the director, actor or even a script.\n\nTerminator 5- No Idea *\n\nThe film has no official script, cast or director, and the only person who is affiliated with it is James Cameron.\n\nWanted 2– No Idea*\n\nAgain, nothing is known, but there will probably be a sequel due to the last film’s success.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit 2– No Idea*\n\nLittle is known about the project, and we can’t be sure that it will be made.\n\nxXx: The Return of Xander Cage- No Idea\n\nVin Diesel returns as Xander Cage, where he is left for dead after an “accident.” He returns to get an assignment from Samuel L. Jackson- who plays Augustus Gibbons.\n\nZombieland 2– No Idea*\n\nThe odds of a movie happening are very low, as both Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson have stated it will not happen. The writers however have stated that although a movie sequel probably won’t happen, it could become a TV series."
