Actress, singer and dancer Ashley Tisdale was a popular player on the Disney Channel's buddy comedy "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" (Disney, 2005-08) but it was her role in the ensemble cast of the "High School Musical" movies that transformed her into a superstar of 'tween entertainment. The phenomenal hit musicals led to world concert tours, a top-selling soundtrack, and a solo record deal for the 20-year-old who had been honing her chops as an entertainer since she was three years old. With her simultaneous breakout success on screen, stage, and as a recording artist, Tisdale found herself in the fortunate position of being one of the top paid females on the 'tween circuit who was able to take her career in any direction she chose.
