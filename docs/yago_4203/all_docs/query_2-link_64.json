        "text": "During the period of German occupation that went from 1940 to 1944, French cinema took various shapes and paths – from the sophisticated historical films of Claude Autant-Lara (for instance, 1943’s production of “Douce”), to anti-war drama films (which has its best examples in later works from the 1950s such as 1952’s “Jeux Interdits” or 1956’s “Gervaise”) or the highly praised and original works from influential directors such as Jean Cocteau (1946’s “Beauty and the Beast”), Robert Bresson (1943’s “Angels of Sin”), Jacques Becker (1943’s “It Happened at the Inn”) or Julien Duvivier (1937’s “Pépé Le Moko”) – French cinema manifested many interests and themes.\n\nHowever, influenced by a pessimistic vision over reality brought by the war and its atrocities or perhaps influenced by the noir influences coming from the other side of the Atlantic, French cinema welcomed from the early 1940s and most notably in the later 1950s a new wave of gangster/thriller films that are often referred as the French branch of Film Noir.\n\nThese films were in many aspects influenced by the hard boil American style, presenting a certain closeness to the anti-hero figure and a feeling of disenchantment and at times contempt for society. However, it’s interesting to observe that the “French noirs” place more emphasis on the disposition of a given ‘criminal organization’. Using the values that regulate it – power, money, greed, cruelty, fear and so on – to mimic the ‘outside’ society, that is, the society in which we all live, regulated by finance, law and order and so on.\n\nAnother interesting aspect that French noirs highlight is the importance of the female figure – femme fatale – as a centre or motor for the action. In addition to this, visually speaking, naturally this French crime wave shares many aspects with the American noir, however the most sticking of them all which was (perhaps proportioned because the golden age of French Noir coincided with the standardize use of colour that came with the 1950s) the combining of chiaroscuro techniques with colour. Which to a certain extent is a key element to understand and praise the importance of French noir films. Despite the fact that even today, many of these influential films were also made in black and white.\n\nThis list incorporates a number of films from an early period prior to the German occupation of France, productions from the 1930s and later on it includes titles produced during the occupation period (1940 – 1944), titles from the golden age of “French Noir” (1950s) and neo-noir titles from the 1960s, titles which can be tied to this noir wave despite the fact that these later films incorporate more elements of gangster films and other genres.\n\nEARLY NOIR INFLUENCES\n\nPépé Le Moko (1937)\n\nJulien Duvivier was undoubtedly one of the most important film directors when it comes to classic French cinema. Duvivier, who had been an actor in an early stage of his artistic career, reached stability and a name for himself during the 1920s and had successfully directed prior to Pépé Le Moko, Poil de carotte in 1932 and La Belle Équipe in 1936.\n\nPépé Le Moko is centred on Jean Gabin’s character, a gangster by the name of Pépé, who is wanted by the French police reason why is fled from France to Casbah, Algeria. However, a police inspector found Pépé’s hiding and when he learns that the gangster has fallen in love with a woman name Gaby, he sees in her a mean to lure the gangster out of his refuge and protection. The film had an American remake made a year later by John Cromwell titled “Algiers”.\n\nLe Quai des Brumes (1938)\n\nThis time directed by Marcel Carné, Jean Gabin gives yet another exciting performance as a deserting soldier named Jean who falls in love with Nelly, a run-away teenager. Their relationship mimics the many forbidden relationships seen in many American noir films, however, this time the circumstances of its prohibition is the fact that Nelly’s godfather is also in love with her and concentrates all his efforts into getting Nelly for himself. Additionally, Jean and Nelly’s relationship is also disturbed by the actions of a local gang and its figures who when looking for Nelly’s former boyfriend stumble into Jean and begin to distaste him.\n\nPort of Shadows as it was titled in English is widely associated with French poetic realism, nevertheless, its praise comes also for its brutal ending and its dark atmosphere as Frank S. Nugent describes in his review for the New York Times in 1939: “The film is nothing more than a lament for the living expressed somberly by a camera greedy for shots of rain and fog, by a writer who has looked at life through grey-tinted glasses, seeing nothing but its drabness, its sordidness and the futility of those who expect anything more of it. (…) Its central figure, the unsmiling embodiment of man’s hopelessness (…)”.\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1938)\n\nYet another remarkable performance by Jean Gabin, in this adaptation of Émile Zola’s novel of the same title to the screen by Jean Renoir (and later in an American version by Fritz Lang starring Gloria Grahame and Glenn Ford). It tells the story of a train conductor, troubled by his own murderous desires, who falls in love with a married woman who is equally troubled but for different reasons – she has helped her husband to commit murder.\n\nOnce more recurring to the words of New York Times film critic, Frank S. Nugent, who describes the film as “(…) a hardly pretty picture, dealing as it does with a man whose tainted blood subjects him to fits of homicidal mania, with a woman of warped childhood who shares her husband’s guilty secret of murder…It is simply a story; a macabre, grim and oddly-fascinating story.” These last words serve not only as qualifying adjectives of a film but rather of a sub-genre whose centre is the hypocrisy, the sin, the darkness of human nature, that is film noir.\n\nLe Jour Se Lève (1939)\n\nThe second collaboration between Marcel Carné and Jean Gabin featured on this list, highly praised by its intelligent use of storytelling is Le Jour Se Lève titled in English as Daybreak, a film that revolves around a worker named François who after murdering a man named Valentin, is trapped in his apartment. With the police waiting outside the building, François begins to recollect the circumstances that led to his present disgraceful situation.\n\nLe Jour Se Lève is yet another example of the French poetic realism, a movement that starred in France during the 1930s which is centres its attentions on figures relegated by society such as working class members, petty criminals or unemployed people who come across an opportunity or someone that is able to change the pessimistic course of their lives. However, these main characters often fail at reaching their goals and, sort of like in the classic theatre, see themselves doomed by a darker faith that usually dictates an endless disillusionment towards life or in some cases its end.\n\nDespite this fact, Le Jour Se Lève is often looked by critics and scholars as an example of noir influence due to its crude depiction of reality, the films connection with the underground and criminal activity, as well as, the use it does of contrast and other chiaroscuro techniques often associated with the American film noir movement.\n\nOCCUPATION PERIOD AND GOLDEN AGE OF FRENCH FILM NOIR\n\n1943’s Le Corbeau and other titles by Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot is one of the names that has to be regarded as one of the key figures of French cinema influenced by the American noir wave. Many of his films share many characteristics with film noir, concentrating their attentions on ‘real’ people that find themselves in special circumstances, often connected, with death, robbery or in the middle of other criminal intended actions.\n\nLe Corbeau, titled in English The Raven, released in 1943, is just the first of many films directed by Clouzot to display an interest with darker atmospheres and ideas such as cynicism, greed, lack of morale, detachment and even disenchantment. In Le Corbeau a village doctor named Rémy finds himself the target of mysterious letters sent around the village accusing him of heavy “moral sins” such as adultery, practicing abortion, spreading lies and so on.\n\nOther interesting titles by the director that display a somewhat noir influence are, chronologically: Quai des Orfèvres (1947), Le Salaire de la Peur (1953) and Les Diaboliques (1955). Particularly popular since the 1950s remained Les Diaboliques and Le Salaire de la Peur.\n\nThe first is a tale of two women, the wife and the lover of the same man who plan to murder him. However, after the plan unfolds successfully letting them enjoy a temporary taste of freedom, the two women are confronted with yet a great distress, the disappearance of the victim’s body.\n\nLe Salaire de la Peur, titled in English The Wages of Fear which revolves around the dangerous voyage of four men who risk their safety when transporting a nitro-glycerine shipment across remote south America.\n\nThe film gained an international acclaim due to the performances of French star Yves Montand and Véra Clouzot, as well as, due to its explosive great sequences and also due to the maintenance of the thriller aspect throughout the all film. As described by Bosley Crowther in the New York Times: “The characteristics of the people are not the absorbing thing in this film. The excitement derives entirely from the awareness of nitro-glycerine and the gingerly, breathless handling of it. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode.”\n\nPanique (1946)\n\nAfter directing Pépé Le Moko as described previously, director Julien Duvivier returned to the noir atmosphere with 1946’s production of Panique. The film set in the Parisian suburbs revolves around a man known as Monsieur Hire (portrayed by Michel Simon) who becomes suspected of committing a crime, the murder of a maid. Even though he is not guilty the man starts to be hunted by his neighbours and soon a crowd goes on the streets looking for avenging the young maid they think was murdered by a Hire –a Jew.\n\nDespite its undeniably noir influence, being Monsieur Hire a sort of anti-heroic figure (because of his unfitness within the Parisian community he lives in) and an ordinary man that finds himself under extreme circumstances evolving a great degree of violence, the importance of this film derives from yet another important aspect as justified by author Susan Hayward in her book French National Cinema: “After the war narratives were spent on some kind of revenge. The harrying of a Jew to his death in Duvivier’s Panique (…) attest to a need to project the immediate past on to a different set of narratives that are removed from the immediate arena of guilt (although Panique comes uncomfortably close). Dark social realism is to be found in a considerable number of films during the five-year period after the end of the war. The films of Henri-Georges Clouzot and Henri Decoin are the most remarkable in this context in their fierce, almost cynical pessimism, but the works of Yves Allégret and Julien Duvivier in that period come close on their heels.”\n\nOn a later stage of his career Duvivier also directed another noir influenced film titled Voici le temps des assassins (1956) which tells the story of Monsieur Chatelin, the owner of a Parisian restaurant, who is reunited with the daughter of his former wife Gabrielle. Moved by the girl’s loneliness and lack of financial comfort, Chatelin employs her and has time passes the two began having an affair which is consummated by marriage. However, unbeknownst to old Chatelin is the girl’s true intentions and character which he starts uncovering soon after their marriage.\n\n1948’s Dédée d’Anvers and other titles by Yves Allégret\n\nOne of the names referred before by author Susan Hayward within the context of post-war French cinema was Yves Allégret. And there is a distinctive trait in Allégret’s cinema which can be described as dark social realism.\n\nAfter commencing his career with comedy films, Yves Allégret, embraced dark toned pictures often described as noir films starting with 1948’s production of Dédée d’Anvers. This film stars Simone Signoret as Dédée a prostitute working in a harbouring town who meets an Italian sailor named Francesco, whom she sees not only as a love interest but also as a mean to escape from her present condition and her obligations towards her pimp/manager named Marco.\n\nYves Allégret, who was the former assistant of his brother, famed film director, Marc Allégret, made of his collaborations with scriptwriter Jacques Sigurd, his most remembered films: Dédée d’Anvers, Une si jolie petite plage in 1948 and Manèges in 1950.\n\nAndré Cayette’s tetralogy of Judicial films (1950 – 1955)\n\nChronologically ordered: Justice est faite (1950), Nous sommes tous des assassins (1952), Avant le déluge (1954) and Le dossier noir (1955).\n\nAndré Cayette who once had been a lawyer himself, turned to filmmaking after the war in a studio called Continental Films (which had also been responsible for the production of Le Corbeau), that was under German influence and control. Throughout his career, André Cayette worked around very specific themes such as law and order, justice, morale, guilt and pardon.\n\nThese reveal the predisposition of Cayette’s films to put the human figure under an intense observation which is also revealed through the various elements of the mise-en-scène – use of camera, sets, props and so on – as if even out of the courtroom we feel that his characters and their actions are being put under constant evaluation often with the purpose of focusing on the individual’s morale or lack of it. In this context, naturally, his four most important features present storylines and situations that naturally serve as basis to the exploration of Cayatte’s vision and favoured themes.\n\nIn Justice est faite, a woman named Elsa is accused of murdering her lover, while on court, her case is discussed vividly by various jury members who put under questioning her previous life experiences, as well as, their own which allows them to see in the presented arguments by defence and prosecution, evidences of very distinctive things.\n\nIn 1952’s Nous sommes tous des assassins, the troubled life of René Le Guen is put under focus. Le Guen who had been trained by the French resistance to pursuit and kill Germans and traitors during the war, continues to commit the same crimes in the post-war period. However, once he is caught, his trial begins and so does later his waiting for either the commutation or unfolding of his sentence – death by the guillotine.\n\nAvant le déluge revolves around a gang of teenagers who run away from their parent’s homes in hopes of also leaving the country due to the imminence of a third world war – the atomic war. In Le dossier noir, the mystery revolves around a little black dossier who disappeared from judge Jacques Arnaud’s house which contains information on one of the towns prominent figures and his shady actions.\n\nJacques Becker’s Casque D’Or (1952), Touchez Pas au Grisbi (1954) and Le Trou (1960)\n\nJacques Becker, who was during the 1930s an assistant director to many famed directors such as Jean Renoir’s masterpieces La Grande illusion (1938) and La Règle du Jeu (1939), had in Dernier Atout (1942) and Goupi mains rouges (1943) the first successes of his career as a film director. Both these films are crime pieces with a touch of comedy, however, throughout his career, Jacques Becker developed a style that shared many characteristics with noir films. And Casque D’Or (1952), Touchez Pas au Grisbi (1954) and later Le Trou (1960) serve as the best examples.\n\nCasque D’Or (1952) tells the story of a woman named Marie (Simone Signoret) who finds herself divided between the affections of a gangster named Roland, the leader of the a local gang, and the shy honest love of Manda, a carpenter. As described by David A. Cook the film is a “visually sumptuous tale of doomed love set in turned-of-the-century Paris (…) a work of great formal beauty whose visual texture evokes the films of Louis Feuillade and engravings from la belle époque.”\n\nTouchez Pas au Grisbi (1954) is regarded as an important film mainly because it opened the season for gangster films that in the late fifties evaded French cinema. Grisbi as it was titled in English revolves around an aging gangster who sees himself forced to retire and give up the gang’s leadership once his best friend is kidnapped and a handsome ransom is demanded from him.\n\nMemorable by its black and noir cinematography, Le Trou (1960), it’s a tale of human condition that takes place in Parisian prison where four inmates, facing long sentences, plan an elaborate escape which they unveil to the newest member of their cell – Gaspar. Unbeknownst to them is the fact that Gaspar is not the trustable kind.\n\nJacqueline Audry’s Huis clos (1954) and Mitsou (1956)\n\nJacqueline Audry was what we would call today an indie filmmaker until the end of the 1940s, a period where her adaptations of Collete’s novels became quite popular among French audiences, being its last a subject of this text – Mitsou. However, her best known films are those made during a period of French cinema heavy influenced by American noirs, the 1950s. And in this period, Audry directed an adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre’s play Huis Clos (English Title: No Exit) which revolves around a group of people, two women and a man, who find themselves locked inside a room in Hell.\n\nWhereas in 1956’s adaptation of Collete’s novel, Mitsou, the focus of attention is a singer in a Parisian music-hall which finds herself involved in a love triangle. Being at one end an older wealthy man and at the other end a younger army officer who visits the music hall during one of its shows dedicated to the troops participant in the ongoing World War I.\n\nBob le flambeur (1955)\n\nOne of the leading figures of what this French noir wave was undoubtedly director Jean-Pierre Melville whose films remain quintessential even today. 1955’s Bob le Flambeur revolves around old Bob Montagne, a gangster who also happens to be a gambler that finds himself amidst total bankruptcy. This forces Bob to make a last effort at regaining financial comfort and social prestige by planning a robbery to a gambling casino.\n\nAs noted by film critic Vincent Canby in a New York Times issue, there is a close relationship of influence between Melville’s directorial efforts and the genres that dominated American cinema throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Vincent Canby writes that “Melville’s affection for American gangster movies may have never been as engagingly and wittily demonstrated as in Bob le Flambeur which was only the director’s fourth film made before he had access to the bigger budgets and the bigger stars”.\n\nRififi (1955)\n\nUpon becoming blacklisted by the House of Un-American Activities Committee, American film director Jules Dassin fled to Europe where he then decided to continue his career making some of his most notable films such as Night and the City (1950), The Law (1959) or 10:30 P.M Summer (1966). During this period, another notable achievement was 1955’s production of Rififi.\n\nShot on a modest budget of approximately 200,000$, this film is focused on the planning and unfolding of the perfect heist by a group of gangsters and ex-cons. Being it memorable by its intricate sequences, its exploration of real time and by an editing style that explored the film’s thrilling elements of violence, danger, greed and of course the run against time which naturally maintained everyone held on their seats.\n\nAscenseur pour l’échafaud (1958)\n\nThe second feature film directed by Louis Malle, Ascenseur pour l’échafaud, circles around the macabre plot of Julien Tavernier (portrayed by Maurice Ronet) and Florence Carala (portrayed by Jeanne Moreau), lovers, who plan to kill Florence’s husband. However, things do not happen as the couple had planned and a series of unfortunate events catches up with them.\n\nFeaturing a score by influential jazz musician Miles Davis, the film captures the richness of shooting at night, showing Paris with heavy black and white contrasts and capturing its romantic yet mysterious essence. Noteworthy, is also the scene where Julien Tavernier is being interrogated by the police detectives who became increasingly suspicious of the man’s answers and behaviour.\n\nAscenseur pour l’échafaud is yet, quoting Roger Ebert, another “1950s French noirs (that) abandon the formality of traditional crime films, the almost ritualistic obedience to formula, and show crazy stuff happening to people who seem to be making up their lives as they go along. There is an irony that Julien, trapped in the elevator, has a perfect alibi for the murders he is suspected of, but seems inescapably implicated with the one he might have gotten away with. And observe the way Moreau, wandering the streets, handles her arrest for prostitution. She is so depressed it hardly matters…”.\n\nAs noted by Roger Ebert films such as Bob le flambeur (1955), Rififi (1955) and Ascenseur pour l’échafaud (1958), because of their boldness, should be perceived as keys that opened yet another door in French film noir – neo-noirs. Films that throughout the 1960s and 1970s explored noir influences using different rhythms and formal choices.\n\nLATER AND NOTABLE NOIR INFLUENCED FILMS\n\nPlein Soleil (1960)\n\nInspired by Patricia Highsmith’s novel The Talented Mr. Ripley (who had also written Strangers on a Train adapted by Alfred Hitchcock to the screen), Plein Soleil, directed by René Clément revolves around a man named Tom Ripley, who travels all the way to Italy with the intent of persuading his wealthy friend to take over his father’s estate. However, the friend, whose name is Philippe Greenleaf prefers to spend his time in his luxurious yacht and manages to convince Tom to stay along with him. Tom stays, but for another reason – Marge, Philippe’s girlfriend.\n\nAs Tom becomes increasingly attracted to Philippe’s comfortable lifestyle, Philippe on the other hand becomes infatuated with Tom’s constant submissive attitude and to end that Philippe plans a rather cruel little prank on Tom and when it happens Tom’s response is to elaborate a silent yet even more cruel plan – to kill Philippe and assume his identity.\n\nPreviously to Plein Soleil, René Clément made equally interesting films such as Les Maudits in 1947, Le Mura di Malpaga in 1949, Jeux Interdits in 1952 or Gervaise in 1956.\n\nWithin the same tone and also worthy of your time is La Piscine (1969) directed by Jacques Deray.\n\nTirez sur le pianiste (1960)\n\nOne of the most influential films of the nouvelle vague, Tirez sur le pianiste titled in English Shoot the Piano Player, put under focus the destiny of a man once known as one of the great classical pianists of his time, Edouard Saroyan, who started losing his shine after his wife’s suicide. Due to that event Edouard ended up climbing down the stairs of fame being now employed in small Parisian bar as a band pianist under the name of Charlie Kohler.\n\nOne night Charlie receives a visit from his gangster brother who manages to convince Charlie to help him in order to get out of a complicate scheme he had with some ‘business associates’. Thus, accidentally dragging Charlie into complicated circumstances.\n\nEven though, visually, the film with its modern editing style (which included jump cuts and other elements that broke with Hollywood’s code of transparent editing which had been applied into film noir) may seem quite distant from its American noir ancestry, the truth is that again the focus on real people that find themselves in out of the ordinary circumstances, as well as, the fact that Charlie is a character that literally descended the stairs from a rich past to an ordinary present can account at some extent to draw a relationship between American noirs and the film itself.\n\nAlso important is to note the black and white cinematography by Raoul Coutard that in a way mimics some sequences in noir films, for instance, On Dangerous Ground (1951) directed by Nicholas Ray.\n\n“Classe Tous Risques” and the new wave of French-Italian gangster noirs\n\nAs mentioned before, midway through the 1950s and later in the 1960s and 1970s, the noir influence was extended into yet another specific sub-genre of films that became widely popular in French cinema during the referred decades, gangster films, also known as gangster noirs.\n\nThese films which were often produced in cooperation with Italian production houses and thus being known as French-Italian gangster pictures, put the focus again in the structure and organization of criminal societies and its dominant values. One of the main examples of this idea is Classe Tous Risques released in 1960 and directed by Claude Sautet.\n\nThe film’s protagonist is a gangster that left France before being sentenced to death. In Italy, his new adopted home, he again engages in criminal activities and when the Italian police come closer to him, Abel, returns to France. However, upon returning to France, Abel, his best friend and accomplice, Raymond, as well as, Abel’s family are surprised by the police and, suddenly, Abel sees himself alone while still on the run from the authorities.\n\nAnthony Scott on the New York Times wrote about the importance of Classe Tous Risques, as well as, the significance of gangster films within French cinema of this period: Classe Tous Risques (…) originally released in 1960 was lost in the frenzy of the Nouvelle Vague, which made its straightforward use of genre look a bit old-fashioned. (…) It is worth seeking out, not only because Classe Tous Risques represents a missing piece of film history – a link between the great post-war policiers and the brooding 1960’s gangster dramas of Jean-Pierre Melville – but because it is a tough and touching exploration of honour and friendship among thieves.\n\nOther films regarded as great within this gangster wave were: Les Tontons Flingueurs (1963), Le Clan des Siciliens (1969), Borsalino (1970), Le Cercle Rouge (1970) or Max et Les Ferrailleurs (1971).\n\nLe Septième Juré (1962)\n\nDirected by Georges Lautner in 1962 Le Septième Juré’s protagonist is the once respectable pharmacist named Grégoire Duval, who in an impulse murders a young woman and acts as if nothing happened when the girl’s boyfriend is imprisoned and wrongly accused of committing the deed. Only later once Monsieur Duval becomes a juror in the trial of the wrongly accused boyfriend does his conscience starts to weight and argue against himself.\n\nLe Doulos (1962)\n\nThe second of a series of Jean-Pierre Melville directed films featured in this list, Le Doulos focus on a small time criminal named Maurice Faugel who in the days following his release from prison murders a man who was a receiver from a heist’s profits. Keeping the loot for himself, Faugel plans yet another movement – another robbery. However, this time a small detail will dictate the end of Faugel’s luck, someone he trusts is rumoured and in fact is a police informer.\n\nIn 1964, Bosley Crowther wrote: “(…) the picture, which is one of those feeble attempts to be philosophical and mordant about crime as a chosen career. Jean-Pierre Melville, who wrote and directed it, has so many scenes of mere conversation running through it—so many scenes in which plot is played in talk—that one wonders why his people need firearms. They can talk one another to death. What’s more, it is so extremely plotted—so cluttered with cops’ and criminals’ names and references to robberies that have happened but still are somehow pertinent—that the viewer who tries to follow is bound to get lost in a maze of underworld byways and in-talk that saps one’s interest and strength.”\n\nCompartiment Tueurs (1965)\n\nAs Jean-Luc Godard directed Alphaville (also noir influenced) and Pierrot Le Fou and as in America Sound of Music casted a great impression in audiences, director Costa-Gravas released his first feature film: Compartiment Tueurs.\n\nTitled in English The Sleeping Car Murders, the film follows the path of six people who travel in a train carriage from Marseilles to Paris. As they arrive to their surprised a woman is found dead in a compartment and an investigation commences immediately dictating the rise of suspicion among the six travellers who suspect that among them is the real killer.\n\nLe deuxième souffle (1966)\n\nIn 1966 Jean-Pierre Melville and Lino Ventura return to French screens in Le deuxième souffle, a film remembered for its great use of the many noir elements, as well as, for its opening sequence described in an issue of the New Yorker: (…) a jail break, which Melville films with an extraordinary abstraction. There’s a deadly detail in the sequence that’s worth calling attention to here: the two convicts who manage to escape prison alive run through underbrush along a train track and, when a freight train chugs slowly by, they run to jump aboard and take refuge in an empty car. The sides of the cars, however, all bear a surprising mark—Stars of David, a reminiscence of the fact that French national railway trains (and those who worked, whether as conductors or administrators, on the railroad) were employed, during the Second World War, in the transport of Jews (and other prisoners, whether persecuted for race or politics) from France to concentration camps.”\n\nThe jail break described before is leaded by Gustave Minda, a gangster who manages to arrive in Paris and there participate in a violent shooting. After that Gustave sees his financial capacities diminished and decides to participate in one last heist.\n\nLe Samouraï (1967)\n\nLoner Jef Costello is a methodical hitman whose costumes include involving his girlfriend Jane in his businesses because of her handiness in providing alibis for him. However, the trouble doesn’t begin with several mixed-up witnesses who aren’t sure of having or not having seeing him running away from a crime scene, Jef’s trouble begins once an investigating officer becomes convinced that Jef was indeed the man who committed not only that crime he is now investigating but also numerous previously offenses.\n\nThis is the main plot of Le Samouraï, perhaps Jean-Pierre Melville’s best known film but undoubtedly one of the most acclaimed crime films of all time.\n\nL’armée des ombres (1969)\n\nTitled in English Army of Shadows, its director Jean-Pierre Melville eleventh film and in the words of film critic Roger Ebert is a film “about members of the French Resistance who persist in the face of despair. Rarely has a film shown so truly that place in the heart where hope lives with fatalism. It is not a film about daring raids and exploding trains, but about cold, hungry, desperate men and women who move invisibly through the Nazi occupation of France. Their army is indeed made of shadows: They use false names, they have no addresses, they can be betrayed in an instant by a traitor or an accident. They know they will probably die.” And most importantly this film reflects one of the major qualities of noir films “This is not a war film. It is about a state of mind.”\n\nAs noir films, regardless of plot and respecting all the sub-genre’s elements and codes, above all the film had to bound before an idea – that of being disenchanted with the world.\n\nUn Flic (1972)\n\nAt last, another film by Jean-Pierre Melville, his final film – Un Flic (1972). Once more starring Alain Delon, the film starts with a bank robbery in a small French town, Saint Jean de Monts. Only this time Delon instead of playing the seductive criminal portrays a detective named Edouard Coleman who is in charged with finding the men responsible for the heist.\n\nThis neo-noir film that quotes celebrated French criminal Eugène François Vidocq – “The only feelings mankind has ever inspired in policemen are those of indifference and derision.” – is the last of the series of great crime films made by Jean-Pierre Melville, films that combine the essence of a disenchanted reality with extreme stylization that can be traced back to American film noirs with pictures like “The Stranger on the Third Floor”, to German expressionist films and prior before that early Scandinavian films which shows the need of man in film, that of always inventing or reinventing new forms of delivering us audience, reality."
