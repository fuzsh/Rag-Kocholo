        "text": "Simone Signoret (born March 25, 1921, Wiesbaden, Ger.—died Sept. 30, 1985, Eure, France) was a French actress known for her portrayal of fallen romantic heroines and headstrong older women. Her tumultuous marriage to actor Yves Montand and the couple’s championing of several left-wing causes often provoked controversy and brought her notoriety.\n\nBorn in Germany to French nationals, Signoret was reared from the age of two in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, where she led a sheltered middle-class existence. As a teenager she began to frequent the Café de Flore, a popular meeting place for leftist artists and intellectuals. There she befriended, among others, writer Jacques Prévert and film director Yves Allégret (whom she later married) and decided to become an actress. Unable to obtain an official work permit because her father was Jewish, she took her mother’s maiden name, Signoret, as her professional name and worked primarily as a motion picture extra during the Nazi occupation of France. After World War II she soon graduated to featured roles, typically portraying prostitutes and lovelorn young women in films such as Allégret’s Les Démons de l’aube (1945; “The Demons of Dawn”) and Macadam (1946). She became a star in France playing the title role, another sympathetic prostitute, in Allégret’s Dédée d’Anvers (1948; Dedee).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nSignoret’s career took a significant detour in 1949 when she met Montand, for whom she eventually divorced Allégret. She married Montand in 1951 and began limiting her projects in order to spend more time with him. Among the films she accepted were Jacques Becker’s Casque d’or (1952; Golden Marie, “Golden Helmet”), a romantic love story in which she portrayed the title role with sensitivity, warmth, and passion, and Henri-Georges Clouzot’s classic suspense thriller Les Diaboliques (1955), in which she played a cool, murderous schoolteacher. She also branched out into the theatre, starring opposite Montand in 1954 and 1955 in an acclaimed Parisian production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible (as well as in the 1957 film version, Les Sorcières du Salem [“The Witches of Salem”]).\n\nSignoret secured her status as an international star with her intelligent, sensual portrayal of a jilted older woman in Room at the Top (1958), which won her numerous awards, including the British and American Academy Awards. After that success she appeared in a few Hollywood films but preferred working in France. In her later films, such as Le Chat (1971; The Cat) and La Vie devant soi (1977; Madame Rosa, “The Life in Front of You”), she often played a survivor whose battles were evident in her aging, beautifully ravaged face. She brought the same warmth and sincerity to these older characters that she had to her early roles as a radiant beauty, but she often received more attention for her decision not to conceal her age or glamorize her looks than for her actual performances.\n\nSignoret published her autobiography, La Nostalgie n’est plus ce qu’elle était (Nostalgia Isn’t What It Used to Be), in 1976 and also wrote two popular novels, Le Lendemain, elle était souriante (1979; “The Next Day, She Was Smiling”) and Adieu Volodia (1985)."
