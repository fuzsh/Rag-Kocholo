        "text": "This week, we’re looking back at what I like to call a bonafide treat; Les diaboliques (translates as the devils), directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, shot in gorgeous black and white, and released in France in 1955. Based on a book entitled She Who Was No More, by Boileau-Narcejac (two French crime fiction writers, sharing a nom de plume), the film was adapted, produced, and directed by Clouzot (with Jérôme Géromini as a co-writer). It was a sensation in France when it was released, and international critics adored it as well. Nowadays, it’s a somewhat forgotten film only remembered by fans of the Criterion collection, French horror films, or both. And despite the fact that this film ends with a plea from the filmmaker to not spoil anything about it, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS (don’t worry, I’m not gonna spoil the good stuff).\n\nThe film opens on an all-boys school in just outside Paris. The school is run by headmaster Michel Delasalle (played by Paul Meurisse), an abusive and horrible man. His wife, Christina (played to perfection by the director’s wife, Véra Clouzot), a teacher who inherited the school from her parents, suffers from a heart condition. This, as well as the abuse she receives from her husband, leaves her in a near-constant state of anxiety and fear. She decides to team up with fellow teacher Nicole Horner (played by Simone Signoret) to murder her husband. Nicole’s reasoning for joining in? She’s having an affair with Michel, which has also been quite abusive. Despite Christina’s fears, the plan goes off, and they dump his body in the school pool, hoping it will be found by the groundskeeper, or perhaps a student. But as the days go by, the body goes missing. And Christina’s heart fills with panic.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, the famous master of suspense who worked in Hollywood from the early 40s to the mid 70s, originally attempted to buy the rights to the book. And admittedly, it would’ve been a perfect film for him to make. It’s one of the most suspenseful films of the era I’ve ever seen, and in Hitchcock’s hands, it could’ve been an incredibly famous American film. Alas, he was unsuccessful in buying the rights. Clouzot bought the rights mere hours before Hitchcock could. Did he slow down Hitchcock’s method of travel? Did he bribe the authors to give him the rights? Did he make a deal with the devil? We’ll never know, but we do know is that in the hands of Clouzot, Les diaboliques became a masterpiece of suspenseful horror.\n\nThe audience is made to identify with Christina, a simple innocent women who just wants to teach. She dresses in mostly white, her clothes are modest. Her hair is constantly in pigtails, a symbol of her childlike innocence. Nicole, on the other hand, wears mostly black, and darker colours. Their choice of colour symbolizes their beliefs in regards to the murder. Christina initially doesn’t want to go along with it, thinking of it as a sin. Nicole is determined to murder her lover, not even considering the moral ramifications of committing murder. After the murder, Christina starts to wear black on white, symbolizing her belief that she is a sinner. Nicole starts to wear more white, believing she has done something good in ridding the world of an abusive monster. Christina says at one point, “There is only one possible end. We are monsters, and I don’t like monsters.” She knows that due to their actions, their story can’t end well, and this worries her. She becomes more forceful in the black, and Nicole more worried, especially as the body seems to be missing.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this film is the relationship between the director, and his wife, Véra Clouzot. This was the second film they made together, after 1953’s The Wages of Fear. In both films, Véra plays women who aren’t appreciated by their romantic interests in the way they want. In the former, her love interest just doesn’t appreciate her. Here, Michel also doesn’t appreciate her, but he certainly has other, negative feelings for her. It could be an interesting representation of the relationship between both Clouzots. Henri-Georges would always cast her as women who struggled in their love, and here, she plays a woman who struggles so much she murders her husband. Could this be a therapy-of-sorts for the couple, or did Henri-Georges just think Véra played a certain type of character best? Considering how the film ends, it almost seems as if they were working something out between them. By all accounts, they apparently had a loving relationship. So perhaps, if your relationship is beginning to feel a bit stale, just shoot a horror movie. That’ll invigorate it.\n\nAll in all, the film is perfect if you’re looking for some old-fashioned scares. If it was a Hitchcock film, it would probably be more well-known to native English speakers, but I’m quite glad Clouzot got the rights to it first. Also, Hitchcock ended up getting the rights to a different book by the same authors, one that led to the creation of Vertigo, arguably his best film. The film provides just the right amount of suspense, and if you’re trying to learn French, it certainly can’t hurt to spend a couple of hours with this film. This film is a classic that should be more well-known."
