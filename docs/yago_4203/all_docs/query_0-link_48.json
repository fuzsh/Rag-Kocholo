The two women plot to murder their tormentor, and succeed, but the body of the dead man won't seem to go away. Hitchcock desperately wanted to make Les Diaboliques himself, but was so impressed by Clouzot's version he adapted another story by the same authors, which would become Vertigo.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nAdvance tickets are available."
