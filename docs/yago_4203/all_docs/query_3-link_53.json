        "text": "So astonishing were the rushes of Inferno that Henri-Georges Clouzot (The Wages Of Fear, Diabolique) submitted to Columbia Pictures in 1964, the French director was granted an unlimited budget. Inferno was intended to be a study in jealousy of a hotelier who imagines his young wife betraying him with every man and woman he sees. Clouzot, inspired by Fellini’s 8 ½ and challenged by the French New Wave cinematographers, wanted to show “the improbable colors of madness” of the hotelier’s descent, and he began innovative experimentation with make-up, Op Art–inspired lens effects and early electronic music. Yet after only weeks of shooting, the lead actor packed his bags and Clouzot, who had seemingly descended into madness himself, had a heart attack.\n\nThe documentary is riveting for its remarkable detective work and storytelling, and for the recovered footage of Clouzot’s visual experiments and star Romy Schneider’s sensuality. Co-directors Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea Annonier reconstruct what the film might have been, while chronicling the disintegration of Clouzot and the production.\n\nFilm Forum members, join us Thursday at 7pm for a free screening, followed by a discussion with program director Adam Sekuler.\n\n“A dazzling evocation of what may be one of the greatest films never made” – Catherine Wheatley, Sight & Sound\n\nAbout Pique-nique\n\nNorthwest Film Forum is pleased to partner with Cafe Presse to offer Pique-nique, a delicious new way to enjoy dinner & a movie!"
