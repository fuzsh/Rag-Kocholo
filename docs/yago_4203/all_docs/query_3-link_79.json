It kicked off with “Wages of Fear,’’ which repeats tomorrow night. The series showcases the films of a director who managed to run afoul of both political and movie history. The former handicap he overcame. The latter he didn’t.",

        "text": "The political problem is Clouzot’s having made films in France during the Occupation. Was he a collaborationist? A French court ordered a lifetime ban from filmmaking. The sentence was soon reduced to two years. Among those defending Clouzot were Jean Cocteau, Marcel Carne, and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nClouzot’s second feature, “The Raven’’ (1943), can be read as a denunciation of informing. That’s how the Nazis saw it. He didn’t make another movie until after the Liberation. Or does it show the hypocrisy and decadence of French society, and thus implicitly support the Vichy regime? Either way, its story of the destruction brought by a series of poison-pen letters is superbly handled. It’s a tribute to what a charge the movie still carries that its happy ending seems so implausible. That’s not a mistake Clouzot would make again. “Wages,’’ in fact, has an improbable unhappy ending.\n\nThe movie-history problem is Clouzot’s falling between two eras: the pre-war French cinema of Renoir, Carne, and Julien Duvivier, and the New Wave. This positioning at first worked to his advantage. During much of the ’50s, Clouzot dominated the landscape. Eventually, it meant that his body of work came to be dwarfed both by what had preceded it and what followed.\n\nClouzot’s coldness had made him seem almost shockingly modern. The arrival of the New Wave soon made him seem out of date. Sami Frey, later one of Jean-Luc Godard’s “Band of Outsiders’’ (1965), turns up in the courtroom drama “The Truth’’ (1960). His presence seems even more incongruous than that of Brigitte Bardot. Clouzot’s bemused handling of BB - the movie alternately adores and patronizes her - is another sign of his increasing anachronism.\n\nAnachronism becomes catastrophe with “Inferno’’ (1964). For this story of marital jealousy set in a small town, Clouzot tried to incorporate such up-to-the-minute elements as Op Art and hallucinatory color. Health problems forced him to abandon the production. The fascinating/awful footage in Serge Bromberg and Roxandra Medrea’s 2009 documentary indicates that that abandonment may have been for the best.\n\nThe contrast between Clouzot and the slightly younger Jean-Pierre Melville, whom the New Wave embraced, is instructive. Like Clouzot, Melville is a fatalist. Unlike Clouzot, he romanticizes fate, extracting from inescapability a world-weary poetry. Melville adores his doomed gangsters. Clouzot adore his characters? He doesn’t even pity them - a pitilessness perversely underscored by how harshly he treats the characters played by his second wife, Véra. She appears in “Wages of Fear,’’ “Les Diaboliques’’ (1955, the other famous Clouzot title), and the creakily absurdist spy thriller “Les Espions’’ (1957). “Don’t you believe in hell?’’ her character asks in “Diaboliques.’’ “I do.’’ Of course she does. How could her husband have married anyone who didn’t?\n\nClouzot came by his bleakness naturally. “That balance between light and dark, good and bad,’’ he once told an interviewer, “comes from deep in my heart.’’ During the 1930s, he spent four years in a tuberculosis sanitorium. There’s a uniquely claustral quality to his movies. Having known confinement firsthand, he used the edges of the screen as vise as well as frame.\n\nAt least once, he relaxed the pressure. “Quai des Orfevres’’ (1947) takes its title from the location of Paris police headquarters. It’s a murder mystery, but mostly set amid the city’s music-hall life. Clouzot’s pleasure in this milieu - its raffishness, its theatricality, its sense of community - is palpable. It anticipates Renoir’s even more loving tribute to this world, “French Cancan’’ (1954).\n\nThe most memorable performances in Clouzot films tend to come from leading men who lack the manner (let alone the looks) of standard leading men. Charles Vanel’s over-the-hill Jo steals “Wages of Fear’’ from matinee-idol-in-the-making Yves Montand. Good as Simone Signoret is in “Diaboliques,’’ and that’s scarily good, even better is Paul Meurisse, as Véra Clouzot’s monstrous husband (draw your own conclusions). It’s a treat to see Vanel and Meurisse face off in the courtroom as opposing attorneys in “The Truth.’’\n\nMaybe the most irresistible performance in the Clouzot canon comes from the subject of the documentary “The Mystery of Picasso’’ (1956). The painter may look like a short, bald goblin, but talk about star power!\n\nThen there’s Louis Jouvet’s detective in “Quai.’’ Sour and implacable, Jouvet has the face of a lizard - and an affect to match. Now here is a Clouzot hero. Except this pluperfect Clouzot hero has what must be the most uncharacteristic scene in a Clouzot movie - and thus the most unforgettable. Yes, even more than the climax of “Diaboliques,’’ which is one of move history’s all-time shockeroos. If you’ve seen it, you know. If you haven’t, fasten your seat belt (and prepare for a water landing).\n\nThe scene in “Quai’’ is a moment of absolute tenderness. Jouvet’s in his apartment. It’s so cold in there that he needs to rub his hands to keep them warm (this is a Paris of postwar shortages, remember). He gets his overcoat and carries it to his sleeping son and lays it on the boy’s coverlet. The gesture is all the more startling because the child is black. Suddenly, Jouvet’s assistant arrives, summoning him to investigate the murder. As they head out the door, the assistant reminds Jouvet he’s forgotten his coat. No, Jouvet tells him, it stays on his son. “He’s all I brought back from 15 years in the colonies, him and malaria.’’ Adding “malaria’’ is very Clouzot. His bending down to kiss the sleeping boy goodbye isn’t.\n\nThat’s it, practically a throwaway. A little tighter editing, and no one would ever notice those three minutes were missing. Yet in their depth of humanity and simplicity of feeling they bear comparison with Renoir. Given more such moments, so might have Clouzot.\n\nFor more on “The Complete Henri-Georges Clouzot’’ go to hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2011octdec/clouzot.html."
