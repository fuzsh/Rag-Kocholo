        "text": "In “Les Diaboliques”, translated The Devils, Director Henri-Georges Clouzot gives us a prize winning eerie drama that is one of the best in the genre. As the story unfolds both the mistress and the wife of a mean and controlling husband work together to accomplish his murder. The movie takes manytwists and turns leading to one of the best finales in film.\n\nVéra Clouzot plays the husband’s wife Christina, Simone Signoret is mistress Nicole, the dreadful husband Michel is played by Paul Meurisse, and a private detective and retired senior police official Alfred is played by Charles Vanel. His character seems like a forerunner to television’s Columbo. The excellent cast includes a well-placed student who adds to the mystery. Enjoy what one reviewer called “a pip of a murder thriller…”"
