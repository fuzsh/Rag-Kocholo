What is the Action Genre?

An external story in the Action genre focuses on the protagonist‚Äôs sacrifice for positive movement along the death / life VALUE spectrum while generating feelings of excitement in the reader.

The underlying question in every Action story is:

DOWNLOAD THE ACTION CHEAT SHEET

How do I overcome powerful external forces intent on killing other innocent victims and me?

What is the Controlling Idea of the Action Genre?

The universal theme or CONTROLLING IDEA of an action story is:

Life is preserved when the protagonist makes a sacrifice to overpower or outwit their external and internal antagonists. But death results when the protagonist lacks the courage to sacrifice for the survival of self and others.

The Four Core Framework of the Action Genre

The FOUR CORE FRAMEWORK helps us meet reader expectations by bringing the core of our story into focus to create an irresistible, memorable, and shareable experience for the reader.

1. Core Need

Survival

The core need of the Action genre is our primal need to survive an inciting attack by a force of antagonism. The protagonist wants to defeat the antagonist and save others and themselves.

The protagonist‚Äôs deeper need, which all humans share, is to go beyond survival and make life and death meaningful. We must all find the courage to realize and activate our internal potential.

2. Core Value

Death to Life

The core value of the Action genre spans life and death and all the subtle gradations in between. Damnation, or what we call the ‚Äúnegation of the negation‚Äù on the life-death spectrum, isn‚Äôt usually in play in this genre, but the reader should understand what the fate worse than death would be for the protagonist. The spectrum of values includes the risk of an actual injury, illness, unconsciousness, and death.

3. Core Emotion

Excitement

When the protagonist defeats the villain, we feel the core emotion of excitement because if the protagonist can successfully outwit or overpower an antagonist, perhaps readers might too.

4. Core Event

Hero at the Mercy of the Villain

The CLIMAX of the Action genre is the Hero at the Mercy of the Villain scene when the protagonist outwits or overpowers the villain‚Äîor not. This moment forces the protagonist to choose whether to express their unique gifts by sacrificing to defeat the villain.

9 Conventions of the Action Genre

GENRE CONVENTIONS are specific requirements for the story‚Äôs ALTERNATE WORLD, AVATARS, or circumstances that create conflict and enable solutions. Conventions set up genre reader expectations. Without these, the reader will be confused, unsettled, or bored and quit reading.

The Action genre has nine necessary conventions:

An intense setting. The setting must be a disturbed, unbalanced physical and social environment that gives rise to conflict.

Dueling hierarchies. A growth hierarchy is at odds with a power/dominance hierarchy (or a dueling protagonist and antagonist).

The hero. The hero sets out on a journey or must face a challenge created by the villain and the hero‚Äôs OBJECT OF DESIRE is to stop the force of antagonism and save the victim.

The villain. The villain is much more powerful than the hero and the victim and the villain uses their resources to stop the protagonist and harm the victim.

The victim. The victim is much less powerful than the hero or the villain and requires the hero to save them from the villain.

A speech in praise of the villain. At some point, an AVATAR must discover or point out how the villain appears unbeatable. The villain‚Äôs point‚Äîthe reason the antagonist will not give up‚Äîalso must be revealed.

The deadline. There is a clock that establishes a limited time in which the protagonist must act to save the victim.

Set-piece sequences. Fast-paced sequences show the reader the protagonist strengths and weaknesses as well as help the protagonist gain new skills.

Fast-paced and exciting plot. Characters are put in extreme situations and forced to take risks.

8 Obligatory Moments in the Action Genre

OBLIGATORY MOMENTS are the must-have events, revelations, or decisions and actions that pay off the raised expectations of the CONVENTIONS.

The Action genre has eight obligatory moments:

An inciting attack or threat by the villain.

The hero sidesteps responsibility to take action.

Forced to leave the ordinary world, the hero lashes out.

The protagonist discovers and comes to understand the antagonist‚Äôs MacGuffin (villain‚Äôs OBJECT OF DESIRE).

The hero‚Äôs initial strategy against the villain fails.

Realizing they must change their approach to preserve life, the hero reaches the all is lost moment.

Hero at the Mercy of the Villain. The CORE EVENT of the Action story is when the hero‚Äôs gift is expressed

The hero‚Äôs sacrifice is rewarded.
