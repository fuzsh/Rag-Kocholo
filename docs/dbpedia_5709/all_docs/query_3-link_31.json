        "text": "1. Action Genre Research History of Action Action film’s started in the 1920’s and has become a very popular genre to this day in films and other forms of entertainment like video games and books. Action films used to be easily recognisable by its often \"swashbuckling\" adventure films in which actors, such as Douglas Fairbanks, wielded swords in period pieces or Westerns. In the 1940’s to the 50’s action saw a new form through war and cowboy movies. Alfred Hitchcock ushered in the spy-adventure genre while also establishing the use of action-oriented \"set pieces\" like the famous crop-duster scene and the Mount Rushmore finale in North by Northwest. The film, along with a war- adventure called The Guns of Navarone, inspired producers Alber . Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to invest in their own spy-adventure, based on the novels of Ian Fleming. The 1960’s introduced a long running success of the James Bond films or series. This success introduced a staple of the modern-day film: the resourceful hero. Such larger-than-life characters were a veritable “one-man army”; able to dispatch villainous masterminds after cutting through their disposable henchmen in increasingly creative ways. Such heroes are ready with one-liners, puns, and dry quips. The James Bond films also used fast cutting, car chases, fist fights, High tech Gadgets and weapons. During the 1970s, the Bond films faced competition as gritty detective stories and urban crime dramas began to evolve and fuse themselves with the new action style, leading to a string of maverick police officer films, Japan brought us the first martial arts films The 1990’s started to parody the old Western , spy films and urban action films. With the growing revolution of CGI (computer generated imagery) the real world settings began to give way to increasingly fantastic environments. This new era of action films often had budgets unlike any in the history of motion pictures.\n\n2. Action films are very popular with the audiences as they will draw their attention from the spectacular visuals, special effects, extended fight scenes and the range of actors that they use to keep some audiences intrigued because they may favour a particular actor. Action films as a collective have many attributes and characteristics that are iconic to the genre, these being high- speed camera chases to big explosions . Actions also have common narratives which will include having a villain attacking or threatening the world or the hero. The hero must then stop the villain using any means necessary which in many cases there is load of destruction done to the setting which will tend to be cities in America in big block buster films. Within the action films there are also common character types , for example the villain is usually very smart and manipulative and will usually have some type of conflict with the hero, the hero Leads narrative, is usually looking for something or trying to solve something (mystery) and will tend to be male. The Princess usually the person in love or will fall in love with the hero but will tend to be in some sort of distress due to the villain. The Helper is usually someone who acts as the sidekick . It is almost impossible to find an action movie that hasn't used a firearm or some sort of weapon within the films and this has become a staple of action movies as they connote danger and risk."
