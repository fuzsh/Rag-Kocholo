        "text": "All around, thank you all for the feedback!\n\nWorking on 2 other tracks, and then I think I'll be a bit more versed in mixing to revisit again. Learning a lot right now.\n\nCouple notes and action items I'm going to act on from the feedback -\n\n-Drums where done using MTPower Drum Kit, I've since been working with ez drummer3, I think a rerun with that and some velocity changes would help with the drum sound.\n\n-Dial back on double tracked guitars- I read some advice that said double track everything. After some more practice I think double tracked rhythm is great, melodic only when its a lead part, otherwise a single track may be \"clearer\"\n\n-Dial back on pad to clear up mix, thinking dial down volume some, and do a low shelf.\n\n-Bring up foundation\n\n-Bring vocals out more - Thinking I'll have to do some overall volume rebalancing, and then some small wide EQ cuts in some of instrumentation to make space.\n\nThank you all for the feedback - loving cakewalk right now!\n\nWhen people say double track, it can be a lazy gimmick at times. If you double track you can pan on left and one right to create width. Or parallel comparison is sort of a double track with glue in the back ground brining out second track with colour and harmonics, nice with saturation or tube/tale emulator. Double track is also good to sit one track more in background with a different EQ to make it shine and the forward track more warm so not in your face, send these to buss then that bus glues them if you add some compression saturation or whatever you feels works, you can't replace a good ear lol\n\nWow, I love the track! Great job on the songwriting, playing and vocals! I'm also am a fan of Minus The Bear. Kudos. So many folks here post music where the playing is pretty good, but also nailing the songwriting and vocals, that's rare (I was once a good musician, but never had a very good voice, so I certainly don't have the whole package like you -- I'm completely envious!). You've got it all. Nothing but respect. I'm going to follow you on SoundCloud. If you were playing a show locally, I would absolutely want to go see it with a song like this. Keep it up.\n\nAlso, how am I only the first person to give that excellent track a like??? Come on guys. Mike is super talented. Give him the likes his talent deserves!!!"
