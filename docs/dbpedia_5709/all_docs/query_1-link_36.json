Action films tend to feature a resourceful character struggling against incredible odds, which include life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit which generally concludes in victory for the hero.\n\nEarly Action films: During the 1920s and 1930s, action-based films were often “swashbuckling” adventure films in which actors, such as Douglas Fairbanks, wielded swords in period pieces or Westerns.The 1940s and 1950s saw “action” in a new form through war and cowboy movies.\n\n1970’s: During the 1970s, the Bond films faced competition as gritty detective stories and urban crime dramas began to evolve and fuse themselves with the new style. Inspired by the success of James Bond, Asian-influenced martial-arts-themed action movies, such as Bruce Lee’s Enter the Dragon and Way of the Dragon exploded onto western cinema screens.\n\n1980s: would see the action film take over Hollywood to become a dominant form of summer blockbuster. The action era was popularized by actors such as Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris. Steven Spielberg\n\n1990s: Western genre, spy-movies, as well as urban-action films, were starting to parody themselves, and with the growing revolution in CGI, the real-world settings began to give way to increasingly fantastic environments.\n\n2000s: Action films continue to flourish as the medium-budget genre movies."
