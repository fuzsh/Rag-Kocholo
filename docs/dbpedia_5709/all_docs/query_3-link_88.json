        "text": "Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify key genre conventions, including structure, tone, and mechanics.\n\nImplement common formats and design features for different text types.\n\nDemonstrate how genre conventions vary and are shaped by purpose, culture, and expectation.\n\nThe multimodal genres of writing are based on the idea that modes work in different ways, with different outcomes, to create various vehicles for communication. By layering, or combining, modes, an author can make meaning and communicate through mixed modes what a single mode cannot on its own. Essentially, modes âcooperateâ to communicate the authorâs intent as they interweave meanings captured by each.\n\nFor example, think of a public service announcement about environmental conservation. A composer can create a linguistic text about the dangers of plastic pollution in oceans and support the ideas with knowledge of or expertise in the subject. Yet words alone may not communicate the message forcefully, particularly if the audience consists of people who have never considered the impact of pollution on the oceans. That composer, then, might combine the text with images of massive amounts of human-generated plastic waste littering a shoreline, thus strengthening the argument and enhancing meaning by touching on audience emotions. By using images to convey some of the message, the composer layers modes. The picture alone does not tell the whole story, but when combined with informational text, it enhances the viewerâs understanding of the issue. Modes, therefore, can be combined in various ways to communicate a rhetorical idea effectively.\n\nAudience Awareness\n\nAs with any type of composition, knowing your audience (the readers and viewers for whom you are creating) will help you determine what information to include and what genre, mode(s), or media in which to present it. Consider your audience when choosing a compositionâs tone (composerâs attitude toward the audience or subject), substance, and language. Considering the audience is critical not only in traditional academic writing but also in nearly any genre or mode you choose. Ask yourself these questions when analyzing your audienceâs awareness:\n\nWhat (and how much) does the audience already know about the topic? The amount of background information needed can influence what genre, modes, and media types you include and how you use them. You donât want to bore an audience with information that is common knowledge or overwhelm an audience with information they know nothing about.\n\nWhat is the audienceâs viewpoint on the subject? Are you creating for a skeptical audience or one that largely agrees with your rhetorical arguments?\n\nHow do you relate to your audience? Do you share cultural understanding, or are you presenting information or beliefs that will be unfamiliar? This information will help you shape the message, tone, and structure of the composition.\n\nUnderstanding your audience allows you to choose rhetorical devices that reflect ethos (appeals to ethics: credibility), logos (appeals to logic: reason), and pathos (appeals to sympathy: emotion) to create contextually responsive compositions through multiple modes.\n\nIt important to address audience diversity in all types of composition, but the unique aspects of multimodal composition present particular opportunities and challenges. First, when you compose, you do so through your own cultural filter, formed from your experiences, gender, education, and other factors. Multimodal composition opens up the ability to develop your cultural filter through various methods. Think about images of your lived experiences, videos capturing cultural events, or even gestures in live performances. Also consider the diversity of your audience members and how that affects the content choices you make during composition. Avoiding ethnocentrismâthe assumption that the customs, values, and beliefs of your culture are superior to othersâis an important consideration when addressing your audience, as is using bias-free language, especially regarding ethnicity, gender, and abilities.\n\nBlogs, Vlogs, and Creative Compositions\n\nAmong the modes available to you as a composer, blogs (regularly updated websites, usually run by an individual or a small group) have emerged as a significant genre in digital literature. The term blog, a combination of web and log, was coined in 1999 and gained rapid popularity in the early 2000s. In general, blogs have a relatively narrow focus on a topic or argument and present a distinctive structure that includes these features:\n\nA headline or title draws in potential readers. Headlines are meant to grab attention, be short, and accurately reflect the content of the blog post.\n\nAn introduction hooks the reader, briefly introducing the topic and establishing the authorâs credibility on the subject.\n\nShort paragraphs often are broken up by images, videos, or other media to make meaning and supplement or support the text content.\n\nThe narrative is often composed in a style in which the author claims or demonstrates expertise.\n\nMedia such as images, video, and infographics depict information graphically and break up text.\n\nHyperlinks (links to other internet locations) to related content often serve as evidence supporting the authorâs claim.\n\nA call to action provides clear and actionable instructions that engage the reader.\n\nBlogs offer accessibility and an opportunity to make meaning in new ways. By integrating images and audiovisual media, you can develop a multimodal representation of arguments and ideas. Blogs also provide an outlet for conveying ideas through both personal and formal narratives and are used frequently in industries from entertainment to scientific research to government organizations.\n\nNewer in the family of multimodal composition is the video blog, or vlog, a blog for which the medium is video. Vlogs usually combine video embedded in a website with supporting text, images, or other modes of communication. Vlogging often takes on a narrative structure, similar to other types of storytelling, with the added element of supplementary audio and video, including digital transitions that connect one idea or scene to another. Vlogs offer ample opportunities to mix modalities.\n\nVlogs give a literal voice to a composer, who typically narrates or speaks directly to the camera. Like a blogger, a vlog creator acts as an expert, telling a narrative story or using rhetoric to argue a point. Vlogs often strive to create an authentic and informal tone, similar to published blogs, inviting a stream-of-consciousness or interview-like style. Therefore, they often work well when targeted toward audiences for whom a casual mood is valuable and easily understood.\n\nOther creative compositions include websites, digital or print newsletters, podcasts, and a wide variety of other content. Each composition type has its own best practices regarding structure and organization, often depending on the chosen modalities, the way they are used, and the intended audience. Whatever the mode, however, all multimodal writing has several characteristics in common, beginning with effective, intentional composition.\n\nEffective Writing\n\nExperimenting with modes and media is not an excuse for poorly developed writing that lacks focus, organization, thought, purpose, or attention to mechanics. Although multimodal compositions offer flexibility of expression, the content still must be presented in well-crafted, organized, and purposeful ways that reflect the authorâs purpose and the audienceâs needs.\n\nTo be well-crafted, a composition should reflect the authorâs use of literary devices to convey meaning, use of relevant connections, and acknowledgment of grammar and writing conventions.\n\nTo be organized, a composition should reflect the authorâs use of effective transitions and a logical structure appropriate to the chosen mode.\n\nTo be purposeful, a composition should show that the author addresses the needs of the audience, uses rhetorical devices that advance the argument, and offers insightful understanding of the topic.\n\nOrganization of multimodal compositions refers to the sequence of message elements. You must decide which ideas require attention, how much and in what order, and which modalities create maximum impact on readers. While many types of formal and academic writing follow a prescribed format, or at least the general outline of one, the exciting and sometimes overwhelming features of multimodal possibilities open the door to any number of acceptable formats. Some of these are prescribed, and others more open ended; your job will inevitably be to determine when to follow a template and when to create something new. As the composer, you seek to structure media in ways that will enable the reader, or audience, to derive meaning. Even small changes in media, rhetorical appeal, and organization can alter the ways in which the audience participates in the construction of meaning.\n\nWithin a mediumâfor example, a videoâyou might include images, audio, and text. By shifting the organization, placement, and interaction among the modes, you change the structure of the video and therefore create varieties of meaning. Now, imagine you use that same structure of images, audio, and text, but change the medium to a slideshow. The impact on the audience will likely change with the change in medium. Consider the infamous opening scene of the horror movie The Shining (1980). The primary medium, video, shows a car driving through a mountainous region. After audio is added, however, the meaning of the multimodal composition changes, creating an emphasis on paceâmanagement of dead airâand toneâattitude toward the subjectâthat communicates something new to the audience."
