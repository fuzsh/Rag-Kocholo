        "text": "The few film genres that existed in the early days of Hollywood filmmaking were clearly defined. Now, there are less clearly defined film genres due to the existence of hybrid and crossover films. Filmmakers use viewer assumptions and the philosophy of film genres to tell unique stories.\n\nWhen discussing film theory, it is helpful to have a firm grasp of the many film genres since this allows for more informed comparisons of aspects common to each genre and the individual films of different directors. In this article, we’ll discuss the importance of film genres and present a comprehensive list of the most important subgenres.\n\nWhy are films categorised into Genres?\n\nClassifying films into genres allows for the easy organisation of works with comparable themes and plots.\n\nIf a user is exploring a streaming site, for instance, being able to sort films into categories will make it easier to find ones that they would enjoy. Critics evaluate films’ creative decisions, including the quality of the cinematography, in light of the conventions of their respective genres, which they use to compare films. Discussions of film theory and history can be organised around the various film genres and subgenres.\n\nFilm Genres and Subgenres\n\nAction\n\nThe protagonist of an action film is forced into a series of events, including violence and extraordinary physical prowess. Genre stories typically centre on a heroic protagonist who overcomes enormous obstacles—such as death, an evil villain, or a harrowing chase—to ultimately triumph.\n\nFights, chases, risks, dangers, explosions, gunfire, stunts, and disasters of all kinds are the hallmarks of this genre. Much of the film is devoted to action, which can be further classified by subgenre labels such as martial arts or military action.\n\nSome of the subgenres of action are:\n\nDisaster film\n\nHeroic bloodshed\n\nMartial arts film\n\nSpy film\n\nSuperhero film\n\nWar film\n\nAction comedy\n\nAdventure\n\nExamples of action films:\n\nCommando (1985)\n\nFace/Off (1997)\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nBad Boys (1995)\n\nAbduction (2011)\n\nThe Avengers (2012)\n\nNobody (2021)\n\nYou can read more about the Action Genre here.\n\nAnimated film\n\nIn animation, static images are digitally altered to provide the impression of motion. For the purpose of traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on sheets of transparent celluloid, which are then photographed and shown on film. Virtually all cartoons produced recently have been CGI productions (CGI). Depending on the project’s needs, computer animation can be either highly complex 3D animation or simpler 2D animation (which might resemble traditional animation) for style, bandwidth, or speedier real-time renderings. Stop motion animation is another prevalent approach in which two- or three-dimensional objects, such as puppets or clay figurines, are moved in sequence.\n\nThe subgenres of animated films are:\n\nCGI animation\n\nCutout animation\n\nLive-action animated film\n\nStop motion film\n\nClaymation\n\nTraditional animation\n\nExamples of animated films:\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nThe Flight of Dragons (1982)\n\nA Bug’s Life (1998)\n\nSouth Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999)\n\nWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)\n\nComedy\n\nThe best way to describe a comedy picture is as a hilarious and exciting time. The comedy theme of these films typically involves placing the main character in an absurd or humorous scenario that they are ill-equipped to manage.\n\nRather than relying on a steady stream of jokes, a good comedy film should focus on telling a realistic story about interesting individuals who grow and change during the course of the film.\n\nSubgenres of comedy include mockumentary, dark, romantic, parody/spoof, and slapstick. For example, Steve Martin stars in The Jerk (1979). It is a comedy about a clumsy white man who joins a Black sharecropper family and soon discovers he is not black.\n\nSome of the main subgenres of comedy films include the following:\n\nAction-comedy film\n\nParody film\n\nRomantic comedy\n\nSlapstick film\n\nBuddy comedy\n\nDark/Black comedy film\n\nMockumentary\n\nExamples of comedy films:\n\nSome Like It Hot (1959)\n\nThree Amigos (1986)\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral (1994)\n\nVery Bad Things (1998)\n\nCharlie’s Angels (2000)\n\nDavid Brent: Life on the Road (2016)\n\nYou can read more about the Comedy Genre here.\n\nDrama\n\nThe dramatic stories have a lot of tension and high stakes. Every character and event must serve the plot in some way. Dramas have a well-defined narrative arc, depicting realistic or severe situations and individuals motivated by strong emotions. Sub-genres of drama include historical drama, romantic drama, young adult drama, teen drama, medical drama, docudrama, noir, and neo-noir.\n\nThe following are examples of common subgenres of drama films:\n\nLegal drama\n\nMelodrama\n\nPolitical drama\n\nDocudrama\n\nTeen drama\n\nMedical drama\n\nExamples of drama films:\n\nMarty (1955)\n\nThe Fault in our Stars (2012)\n\nI Heart Huckabees (2004)\n\nKramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\nChangeling (2008)\n\nFantasy\n\nFantasy films often include fantastical elements that are impossible in the actual world. Some films mix real-world settings with magical aspects, but many others build new worlds with their own rules and logic and are populated by made-up species.\n\nFantasy films, like science fiction films, are speculative but have nothing to do with reality or science. There are several subgenres of fantasy fiction, including high fantasy, fairy tales, and magical realism.\n\nDespite its use of non-scientific themes like magic, legendary beings, and the supernatural, the genre frequently adheres to general human psychology and societal behaviour.\n\nThe following are examples of some of the most common subgenres in fantasy films:\n\nContemporary fantasy\n\nDark fantasy\n\nHigh/epic fantasy\n\nUrban fantasy\n\nExamples of fantasy films:\n\nLabyrinth (1986)\n\nDungeons & Dragons (2000)\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (film) (2001)\n\nThe Muppet Movie (1979)\n\nLord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia (2005)\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n\nYou can read more about the Fantasy Genre here.\n\nHistorical film\n\nThere are two distinct subgenres within the historical fiction category. Accurate portrayals of the past are what one must deal with when writing a biography, autobiography, or memoir. The third grouping features fictitious films but is set in a historically realistic environment.\n\nSince there can never be a totally factual description of any event without first-hand experience, the correctness of a historical story is measured against historical accounts, not fact.\n\nExamples of the historical film are:\n\nAlternate history\n\nHistorical event\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nPeriod piece\n\nBiopic\n\nHistorical epic\n\nExamples of historical films:\n\nThe Longest Day (1962)\n\nLincoln (2012)\n\nThe Patriot (2000)\n\nCatch Me If You Can (2002)\n\nO Jerusalem (2006)\n\nThe Butler (2013)\n\nHorror\n\nIt’s common for horror films to induce a profound feeling of dread and terror in the audience. In many horror films, serial killers and monsters are recurring bad guys, preying on the audience’s worst fantasies. Horror fans go to the cinema to get a high from the ghosts, gore, monsters, and jump scares they crave.\n\nHere are a few examples of major subgenres in the horror film genre:\n\nFound footage\n\nGhost films\n\nBody Horror\n\nZombie film\n\nMonster film (i.e., vampire films, werewolf films)\n\nSlasher film\n\nSplatter film\n\nExamples of horror films:\n\nPsycho (1960)\n\nThe Wolfman (1941)\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nHalloween (1978)\n\nThe Others (2001)\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nPumpkinhead (1988)\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nFriday the 13th (1980)\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nYou can read more about the Horror Genre here.\n\nWestern\n\nTypically, a western hero is a cowboy or gunslinger on the trail of a criminal in the American West. It’s not uncommon for the protagonist to have a vendetta against the villain, culminating in a gunfight or a duel.\n\nThe landscapes of the American West, whether desert, mountain, or plain, are often used as inspiration and as backdrops for the stories told in Westerns. There are many subgenres of Westerns, including spaghetti westerns, space westerns, and sci-fi westerns.\n\nThe following are examples of popular Western film subgenres:\n\nMarshal Western\n\nRevisionist Western\n\nEpic Western\n\nOutlaw Western\n\nSpaghetti Western\n\nExamples of western films:\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West (2014)\n\nTrue Grit (1969)\n\nTombstone (1993)\n\nThriller\n\nThe best thrillers include suspenseful elements like a mystery and a tense buildup to a climax. Good thrillers know how to keep the suspense going by dropping hints, exposing new material, and dropping red herrings at just the perfect times. In many thrillers, there is a race against the clock where the stakes are high.\n\nThe following are examples of common subgenres in the thriller film genre:\n\nMystery film\n\nPsychological thriller\n\nTechno-thriller\n\nExamples of thriller films:\n\nJoker (2019)\n\nUnhinged (2020)\n\nFight Club (1999)\n\nRunaway Jury (2003)\n\nMisery (1990)\n\nYou can read more about the Thriller Genre here.\n\nScience fiction\n\nScience fiction frequently creates fantastical settings and alternate dimensions that feature fantastical aspects that do not exist in the real world. Science fiction covers a wide range of topics, including time travel, space travel, the future, and ethical implications.\n\nScience fiction is among the most forward-thinking. The evolution of what we now call science has affected art and society at least as far back as the Renaissance and the Enlightenment periods. It was slow to catch on, but by the time motion pictures appeared, people worldwide were eager to add science fiction to their list of preferred genres.\n\nScience fiction films presumably take place in a future where humanity has mastered such feats of science as interstellar flight, time travel, and the like.\n\nThe following are examples of some of the most common subgenres of science fiction films:\n\nPost-apocalyptic film\n\nUtopian film\n\nMilitary science fiction\n\nTech noir\n\nDystopian film\n\nSteampunk film\n\nSpace opera\n\nExamples of science fiction films:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nBack to the Future (1985)\n\nTotal Recall (1990)\n\nStar Wars (1977)\n\nTomorrowland (2015)\n\nE.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982)\n\nMinority Report (2002)\n\nGravity (2013)\n\nYou can read more about the Science Fiction Genre here.\n\nRomance\n\nIntimate connections are what set romance apart as a genre. Some of these films may take a darker turn than others, but they all rely on the inherent tensions of trying to become close to someone.\n\nAs with action and comedy, the romance genre has become an integral part of virtually every other type of cinema.\n\nHowever, even though the early cinema was rife with classic romance examples and various hybridisations like the rom-com, the genre has surely changed through the years. Nevertheless, it is still a very important genre in the movie industry and among moviegoers.\n\nSome of the main subgenres of romance films include the following:\n\nRomance drama\n\nHistorical romance\n\nRomantic comedy\n\nFantasy romance\n\nRomance thriller\n\nExamples of romance films:\n\nTwilight (2008)\n\nDirty Dancing (1987)\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (1940)\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nWhat are Pure and Hybrid Genres?\n\nThe cinema has varied and derivative roots—inspired by vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography, and novels—meaning that films rarely stick to a single genre.\n\nAccording to American film scholar Janet Staiger, there are four ways to classify a movie’s genre. In the idealist technique, films are evaluated using set criteria. A film’s genre can be determined using the empirical method, which involves comparing it to a canon of like-themed films.\n\nThe apriori technique makes use of predetermined generic components. Film genre can be determined using the social conventions method by looking at what people generally agree is typical of that genre.\n\nSince most Hollywood films combine the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres, Martin Loop argues that Hollywood films are not pure genres. According to Jim Collins, ironic hybridisation has been a trend in Hollywood since the 1980s, inspiring directors to fuse aspects from disparate genres like in Back to the Future Part III’s Western/science fiction mashup.\n\nGenres are more easily detected than defined, and scholars agree there is no way to classify them precisely. Furthermore, genres are defined differently in many countries. However, the act of classifying films in this way gives us a starting point for film discussion and analysis.\n\nMore from Film Genres"
