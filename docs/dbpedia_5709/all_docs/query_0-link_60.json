        "text": "In the 90s there was an influx of bands trying to overlap. With Green Day and Nirvana becoming pioneers in their infancy, there were other acts who showcased their audacious ambitions. These outfits included Blink 182 and The Offspring. The Offspring’s straightforward punk thrills were surprisingly popular, 3 chord structures that excited people and enticed them to buy their records.\n\nWith Nirvana broken, other bands tried to fill the void. Acclaimed singer/songwriter Kurt Cobain ended his own life, so many acts wanted to try to eclipse Nirvana’s brilliance. Green Day did so as they pounded the scene with their major label debut Dookie. Dookie didn’t overpower Nirvana’s seminal record Nevermind, but what it did do, is match it.\n\nAs grunge began to wither, pop punk started to be introduced. A genre which is such a popular mainstay is modern music. Acts such as Green Day and The Offspring took on this sound later in their careers. And musical outfits such as Good Charlotte, should be thankful for a revolution so colossal. These bands now do what they want. They don’t stick to a particular formula or structure. And as punk fizzles out, pop punk takes action.\n\nPop punk is now established as a phenomenon. It matters to people, it kick-starts trends, it fondles with emotions. The disenchanted paint their nails black and they colour their hair, wearing band merch and screaming at the core of the world. And as bands like Neck Deep prosper, so does the genre.\n\nAs an elite musical outlet, pop punk surpasses any other alternative genre. People will disagree, and the metal contingent will be sick on their hallowed guitars, but as a whole, pop punk takes first place. Its impact is groundbreaking, with many bands marching forward and placing their sounds under its umbrella.\n\nOver the years, pop punk has gathered pace. It has overwhelmed emo, a genre which kick-started a goliath trend. Emo is still apparent and well, it still masks the world with its unique darkness, but there’s not many bands participating in this field anymore. Yes, we still have Dashboard Confessional, but My Chemical Romance is no more, they’re famed for a masterstroke which is The Black Parade.\n\nAs genres dwindle, Pop punk elevates. Its stronghold is solid, it’s influence staggering. And as it grows, musicians will stray from the comforts of their own rooms and create sounds reminiscent of their favourite acts. Although it is happening already, as everyday there seems to be a new band on the scene.\n\nThis is where it comes to originality. Is pop punk unique enough? In some cases it is, as there’s bands such as A Day To Remember who are monumental in the scene and who are original in every sense. But, imitation is rife in music. And pop punk is brimming with bands who aren’t bridging the gap. There are far too many who stick to a straight-forward formula; a strategy of quick fired guitar riffs and lackluster lyricism.\n\nThis isn’t the end of the world, far from it. But, we should look for more, we should expect more. Pop punk will not die, it will keep flourishing and sprinkling its infectiousness over the musical divide. As it dances through time, pop punk will gain more followers, it will alter minds and start fresh new trends. People are addicted to it, they’re enthralled by it. They dance to its sugar laced core, singing those lyrics back. And you know what, it isn’t harming music at all, it’s adding body and feeling, fun and guitars. It’s a phenomenon for those reasons.\n\nA genre that will stand the test."
