        "text": "The weather is warming up, and that means the spring concert season is about to be in full swing. It’s sure to be packed, and Boston has a plethora of venues to choose from. For those who aren’t tuned into more popular artists, here’s a list of alternative artists who will be in Boston this upcoming month.\n\nSet It Off has been a pioneer of the emo genre since they became popular in 2011. They’re known for hits such as “Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing” and “Partners in Crime.” They left their record label in 2023, toured the United States last spring and then went on to participate in multiple music festivals around the world.\n\nSet It Off has a very distinct sound. They’ve been around for more than a decade, and their style is always unique and easy to recognize; it’s always clear when a song has been written by them. They mix emo-rock with jazz and funk, incorporating horns, strings and electronic soundboards. The latest era, however, has returned them to their pop-punk roots.\n\nNow, the band shows no signs of slowing down, with their new tour, The Deathless Tour, beginning March 2024. Set It Off will be performing in Boston at Big Night Live on March 22 at 5:30 p.m. They will be joined by artists Crown the Empire, Caskets, and DeathbyRomy. Frontman Cody Carson claims that this is the first time fans will witness the band’s new era come to life, so it’s not a show to be missed.\n\nWhile Set It Off was brewing their greatest hits back in 2011, Waterparks was just getting started. Formed by Awsten Knight and Gage Matthieu, the band has had a massive breakthrough over the past few years. They first came into popularity with the album “Double Dare,” which included the hit single “Stupid for You.” They then toured with the pop-punk sensation All Time Low before releasing the album “Entertainment” in 2018.\n\nWaterparks employs a large mix of genres. They mainly stick to pop-punk and pop-rock—a more upbeat version of the typical rock genre. However, they’ve also been known to incorporate methods that are not often seen in the mainstream rock scene, such as synthesizers and other electronic editing. Their music is fast-paced and loud in all the best ways.\n\nThe band’s latest era is based on the album “Intellectual Property.” They’re touring the United States again this spring for what they claim is the only Waterparks tour this year, so be sure to stop by. They will be playing at MGM Music Hall March 13 at 7 p.m., joined by Loveless, as well as other potential guests who have yet to be named.\n\nThe Beaches is a rock band formed by sisters Jordan and Kylie Miller. Their song “Blame Brett” became an Internet sensation in the summer of 2023, and their most recent tour was packed with sold-out shows. They were just added to the Oceans Calling festival lineup, which will take place in Maryland, and will be performing alongside massive artists such as The Killers and The All-American Rejects.\n\nThis boost in popularity is well-deserved. The group has taken on an alternative rock sound that has resonated with young audiences, especially young women. They are relatable and emotional in all the right ways, and they appeal to a wide audience across the Internet. Being a women-run band in a genre dominated by men is no easy feat, but they are succeeding with inspiring ease.\n\nThe Beaches will be touring for the release of their newest album “Blame My Ex.” They’ll be playing a sold-out show at Royale on March 8 at 7 p.m. They’ll also be opening for Girl in Red at MGM Music Hall on April 16 at 8 p.m.\n\nThis is just three out of the countless concerts that will be happening throughout Boston this spring, so be sure to keep up to date with your favorite bands!"
