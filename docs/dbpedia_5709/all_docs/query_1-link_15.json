        "text": "Books with lots of action are often a home run with readers, especially those who like a plot-driven story. They can cross a wide-range of genres, from spy fiction to murder mysteries.\n\nDefinition:\n\nAction books are often very heavy on the plot with danger pulling the story forward, leaving readers on the edge of their seat desperate to know what happens next. Elements of risk and surprise are key factors in action stories. The events that trigger the action or danger are typically outside the protagonist’s day to day life. Often, at the end of the story, the hero or heroine is never the same.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\n* Fast-paced\n\n* Conflict\n\n* Danger\n\n* Risk\n\n* Double-crossings\n\n* Betrayal\n\n* Villains\n\n* Violence\n\n* Survival\n\n* Plot twists\n\n* Underdogs\n\nAppeal:\n\nWith action novels, readers quickly turn the pages – often reading these novels in a single setting. In a series, there is often an overall arc that ties all the books together, even though the primary plot of the book is resolved.\n\nActions books are perfect escapism reads; this type of story rarely happens in real life.\n\nReaders like rooting for the underdogs. Often times these teen characters go against supposedly smarter more savvy adults and yet, they are victorious in their quest. It’s hard not to root for the underdog.\n\nRecommended Titles:\n\nSure Fire by Jack Higgins\n\nTraitor by Andy McNab\n\nCherub Series by Robert Muchamore\n\nConfessions of a Murder Suspect by James Patterson\n\nHeist Society series by Ally Carter\n\nKiller Instinct by S.
