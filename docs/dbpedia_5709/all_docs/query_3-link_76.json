        "text": "This Interactive workshop aims at exploring the origin of genres, their functions in cinema and their evolution, with particular emphasis on the latest developments. We first ask why we need genres at all and examine the variety of classification criteria that can be used. Then we focus on the specific features of genre films, analysing their conventions and their narrative structures. We then explore how different agents (from producers to audiences, from critics to film scholars) have used and still use genres, and highlight their economic, sociocultural and communicative functions. Finally, by taking a historical perspective, we explore how genres have evolved in the course of time and how modern cinema extensively use genre mixing and hybridization, thus pointing to the future of this important but complex category of film analysis. Part of the www.cinemafocus.eu research materials.\n\nIn this study, the elements of intertextuality in the films of Aki Kaurismaki, who is regarded as the most important director of Finnish cinema, will be evaluated. Developing a unique cinematic language with his Auter identity, Kaurismaki establishes the formal aspect of his cinema by taking the old methods used in the history of cinema and recreating them in his films. He frequently uses the Minimalism method in his films. Especially, Kaurismaki, who is influenced by Robert Bresson's minimalist understanding, can be said to use off-screen space, elliptical expression and expressionless acting in his films. As a sense of humor, it can be argued that Buster Keaton was influenced by his sense of humor and used the understanding of deadpan humor (inexpressive humor). Another noticeable element in movies is the use of color. In this respect, it can be seen that Kaurismaki was influenced by the paintings of Claude Monet, a French impressionist painter, and formed the colors in his films in this way. Another understanding of cinema that Kaurismaki is influenced by and which he frequently refers to in his films is French Poetic Realism. In particular, Kaurismaki is influenced by the leading director of the trend, Marcel Carne. In addition, another French director, Jean Pierre Melvie, who made films in the movie noir, is among the directors that Kaurismaki was affected by and this influence can be traced in his films. In the study to be conducted with descriptive analysis method, the intertextuality approach will be tried to be clarified with examples from films.\n\nThe relation between architecture and cinema has begun with the first steps of the technology of moving images at the beginning of the 20th century and it has continued progressively until now by importing various intellectual, representational, and practical devices from each other in order to reconfigure their own systems of knowledge. In this investigation, the fundamental elements of architectural design and principles of their organization are used in the field of cinema as a methodological tool to analyze the compositional features of narrative, mise-en scene and editing/montage. First of all, the end products of both domains are conceived as a form of composition, and in this respect, the compatibility of their design dynamics is examined. Secondly, the fundamental design elements and principles of both architecture and cinema are defined. Finally, in order to redefine the design process of a film and to reveal the existence of fundamental principles of architectural design i...\n\nBackground: The gratification each person seeks through a movie is different.
