        "text": "When producing a feature film, we all want to ensure our investments are secure and our efforts are rewarded. And one way to do that is by focusing on film genres that sell.\n\nI was recently reminded of the power of genre when a friend recently sent me a feature drama project to review.\n\nI looked at the project and told him the prospects for selling it would be limited unless he got some serious star talent in the film. This is because independently produced dramas can be a tough sell, even with star talent.\n\nWith all this in mind, I devised an idea for my friend's film. I reread the script and realized it wouldn't take too much to turn his edgy indie drama into an action film with a no-star cast. It would make the writing even better.\n\nFinding Film Genres That Sell\n\nThis suggestion came to me for one reason only – Around the world, ACTION sells. And you usually don't need an A-lister to sell it.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of “tough sells,” consider avoiding comedies that are too edgy. Meaning there's a lot of sex, cursing, or drug use.\n\nOutside of appealing to the market, certain international territories (like China) have censored boards. And these countries won't even consider films that touch on subjects they deem too controversial.\n\nGet Movie Distribution\n\nAction films fit into a category referred to as “evergreen.” These films play well internationally because you don't need to know the language to understand the action. And as a result, when I attend film markets, many buyers ask if I have action films.\n\nIn addition to action, other film genres that sell include sci-fi and horror. These films are attractive because they have an easily identifiable, built-in audience.\n\nIf you find these genres are not appealing to you artistically, you might consider making Christmas-themed dog or cat films. Or heck, sometimes non-offensive RomComs tend also to attract buyers.\n\nAll this to say, you must find the balance between art and business. You have to decide your goals for the film. If you aim to get your independent voice out there with an edgy drama, you're welcome to do so. Just know that this may reduce your distribution opportunities.\n\nAnd if your goal is to make money on the film, your best bet would be to focus on film genres that sell.
