        "text": "Action films. What about them seems to suck in an audience so easily? What even makes an action film different from any other? How is action footage shot differently to the likes of a Rom-Com and most importantly what even is Action as a genre? If you were interested in having some of these questions answered – look no further. Below is basically your very own intro to…\n\nAction films are ones that contain continuous motion and action, such as car chases,fighting, and physical stunts. The action takes priority in the story telling. Typically, an action film revolves around the main character (hero) having a goal and having to face incredible odds to obtain it.\n\nEveryone needs excitement and action films do a marvelous job at providing the thrills some people seek from watching this particular genre. Almost everything that happens in an action movie is unlikely to happen in everyone’s own day to day lives therefore they provide people with a simple and effective out allowing the experience of a heightened state with no real risk to the viewer. Thriving off the excitement that action films provide they also give the viewer a sense of “what would I do if put in that situation” which then makes it all seem a bit more real.\n\nNow if you’ve ever watched a an Action movie before (which I’m sure you have) you would have noticed that there is quite a few different styles also known as sub genres. You’ve got everything from Action-Comedy to Action-Horror and there are so many movies that have more than one sub genre a great example being The Avengers; Lets start off that they are first and foremost an Action based film but there are also a few sub genres they seem to fit in. From simply looking at the poster below I can say that they easily fit into Righting the Wronged, Action-Comedy, Superhero, Vigilantes, Protecting the Innocent and from those sub genres they can split off again into War, Chase movie, Kidnapping, Race Against Time and so on.\n\nIt’s easy for movies to continuously split into more and more sub genres because in certain genres one action must happen which leads to another which leads to a sub genre. A simple example of this being every Superhero movie has to have a bad guy and that bad guy usually poses a threat to innocent bystanders the Superhero has to Protect the Innocent bystanders and when the bad guy does something wrong to the bystanders it usually ends in a Chase etc.\n\nAction films don’t often get the recognition that they deserve when it comes down to the actual skill of making one. Action is often viewed as a film you watch when you don’t really wan to think you just want to see things blown up and people punched. However when you really look into things the lighting, camera and sound conventions that filmmaker form a fairly lengthy list not to mention the Mise-en-scéne of the genre.\n\nMise-en-scéne is french for “placing on stage”. It’s a theatrical expression of the way everything appears and is arranged in a frame. This includes everything that the audience can see on the screen, such as the setting, the lighting, the actors, their performances, costumes, makeup and props. These widely influence the Mise-en-scéne making up a genre itself, meaning that when dramatic and hectic it would create the action feel.\n\nEd Sikov’s Film Studies: An Introduction (2010) defined mise-en-scéne as “the expressive totality of what you see in a single film image”. Mise-en-scéne is literally everything that is shot by the camera, therefore editing anything in or out of a scene wouldn’t be part of it.\n\nBelow we have listed the general lighting, camera shots and sound used most often in Action films:\n\nLIGHTING:\n\nPreprodution: look east (morning), look south (mid day), look west (later in the day)\n\nAccent lighting5-EasyDay-BGAccents-web\n\nLocation & props\n\n5-EasyDay-BGAccents-web.jpg\n\nCAM SHOTS:\n\nShakey Cam\n\nSlow motion\n\nZooming in\n\nTracking shots\n\nSplit Screens\n\nQuick cuts\n\nLens flares\n\nStill shots\n\nCrane shots\n\nSOUND:\n\nPounding\n\nIntense guitar\n\nAggressive and rhythmic mystery music\n\nEnergetic electronic tracks with stable beat and synthetic sound effects\n\nIn conclusion, action movies contain continuous motion and action, which we watch to give us a thrill for a source of entertainment; this is accomplished by using a variety of lighting, sound and camera techniques. Action is the cause of many other sub-genres that we all know and love to watch when in need of distraction.\n\n(Written by: Brittany Gray, Angelina Cebic, Urjowan Al-Farsi, Lisa Turner, Josephine Opie and Sara Al-Harrasi)\n\nReference List (that I know of)\n\nBuffam, N.
