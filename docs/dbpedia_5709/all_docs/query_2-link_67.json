        "text": "Genre Explanation Examples 2D Fighting Fighting games usually feature one-on-one combat where opponents battle until a certain outcome, usually the depletion of one fighter's health. Though early 2D Fighting games offered varying interpretations of this concept, Street Fighter II defined the genre at large, featuring a roster of varied characters with a multitude of special moves, which can be chained into combos. This type of highly technical game became the standard for the genre and continues to have a huge worldwide competitive player base today. Despite losing popularity with the death of arcades in the West, Fighting games have made a comeback thanks to online console play. Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike; Garou: Mark of the Wolves; Darkstalkers 3: Jedah's Damnation 3D Fighting After Street Fighter II set the template for 2D Fighting games, titles like Tekken and Virtua Fighter became pioneers of the 3D equivalent. 3D Fighting games have the same basic structure as their 2D counterparts, but combat on a 3D plane allows for more dodging, horizontal attack ranges, and a greater importance for grappling and \"juggling\" enemies in midair. 3D Fighting games also tend to be more slow-paced than 2D Fighting games. SoulCalibur II; Tekken 3; Virtua Fighter 4 4X Strategy A sub-genre of Strategy games focused on the four X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. These games are large-scale and take place over long periods of time, giving the player control over the growth and development of entire civilizations. Usually they feature some type of combat, which may be turn-based or real-time, and a historical or sci-fi setting. These games were very popular on PC in the mid-to-late nineties. Endless Legend; Civilization V; Sins of a Solar Empire Action One of the broadest game genres. Action games usually revolve around some type of combat where the player controls a character or avatar, and require fast reflexes and hand-eye coordination to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Many of the earliest video games are considered Action games, and most modern games contain Action elements as well. However, most modern games fall into one of the many Action sub-genres and should be labeled as such. Hagane: The Final Conflict; Demon's Crest; Clash at Demonhead Action-Adventure A hugely popular game genre that combines the reflex-based gameplay of Action games with the long-term obstacles and narrative of Adventure games. The player goes on a journey while obtaining new items or abilities, overcoming small and great obstacles, and defeating ever-stronger enemies. A lot of games that don't neatly fit into any particular subgenre are labeled Action-Adventures if they have elements of both. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past; Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver; Okami Action-RPG A subgenre of RPGs, Action-RPGs incorporate a combat and gameplay system taken from Action games. This makes gameplay more brisk and exciting than the usually cerebral or slow-paced combat of RPGs. Action-RPGs tend to follow the structure of Action-Adventures, but still contain the stats, leveling, and equipment systems that identify them as RPGs. Kingdom Hearts; Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen; Dark Cloud 2 Adventure Adventure is one of the oldest game genres, and refers to a type of game that doesn't include action gameplay or reflex-based challenges. Rather, players explore their environment, interact with characters, and solve puzzles to progress. Traditional Adventure games usually featured a text-based or \"point-and-click\" interface. In Japan, Visual Novels are a popular sub-genre. Pure Adventure games lost popularity in the late nineties, but have recently experienced a comeback, mainly thanks to indie developers. Grim Fandango; The Last Express; The Secret of Monkey Island Air Combat A sub-genre of Combat games that simulates dogfights betweeen planes, or similar showdowns with airships. These games may vary in their use of first or third-person perspective and their degree of realism. There are some variations, such as space combat games where players pilot spaceships, but the general gameplay is similar. Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War; After Burner; SkyGunner Arena Brawler A sub-genre of Fighting games that usually features larger stages with elements that can be interacted with, Platform game elements, item pick-ups, combat for more than two players at once, and simpler move inputs compared to traditional Fighting games. Arena Brawlers may also be single-player games with progression similar to Beat-'em-ups. This sub-genre was popularized by the Super Smash Bros. series, but pioneered by Power Stone in the previous generation. Many licensed games based on anime series and cartoons are Arena Brawlers. They are often seen as more \"casual\" Fighting games, but may boast deep gameplay. Super Smash Bros.; Power Stone 2; Jump Ultimate Stars Arena Combat A sub-genre of Combat games where players choose a character from a roster like in Fighting games. However, combat takes place in large arenas where players have high mobility and access to a wide arsenal of long-range moves. Many Mech Combat titles are Arena Combat games as well. In the mid-2010s the genre has become quite popular in Japanese arcades for its fast-paced gameplay and potential to be adapted from many franchises. Pokken Tournament; Gundam Extreme Vs.; Dissidia: Final Fantasy Arena Shooter Arena Shooters are a spin-off of Shooting games, and First-Person Shooters in particular. Though FPS games like Halo and 007: GoldenEye boasted prominent multi-player features, Arena Shooters are dedicated multi-player experiences where players usually choose their character from a pre-determined roster (this version is also known as a \"Hero Shooter\"). Arena Shooters are often squad-based and feature characters with different roles and specializations, giving matches a certain degree of tactics. Unreal Tournament 3; Quake Arena; Team Fortress 2 Artillery Artillery games are a very old sub-genre of Strategy, where the player controls tanks or similar vehicles and fires projectiles at opponents. The core of the gameplay is in calculating the trajectories of projectiles in order to successfully hit enemies. The oldest Artillery games were text-based, but they reached a peak of popularity with modern online iterations, like Gunbound, becoming massive hits. Today, Artillery games persist mostly through a handful of established franchises. Scorched Earth; Worms: Armageddon; Hogs of War Atmospheric This is a term used to refer to games that are primarily about atmospheric exploration instead of fulfilling immediate objectives. The game may not even have any specific goals other than soaking up the atmosphere, but in any case the player is encouraged to explore to their heart's content. Games that have atmospheric settings but clear, constant objectives should probably not be classified as Atmospheric games, as a rule. Free-roaming diving games usually fit into this category as well. Yume Nikki; L.S.D: Dream Emulator; Abzu Beat-'em-Up A sub-genre of Action games and a cousin of Fighting games. Players choose their character, with a particular arsenal of moves and abilities, and fight their way through side-scrolling stages full of mooks, while facing the occasional boss, often in an urban setting. Beat-'em-ups usually feature item pick-ups and multi-player action. This last feature made them widely popular on arcades throughout the nineties, after which they lost relevance and now appear mainly as download titles or on the indie market. They continue to hold a devoted fanbase. Streets of Rage 2; Guardian Heroes; Castle Crashers Board Game A game that simulates the experience of playing a board game, whether this is a real and established game such as Monopoly or mahjong, or a fantasy board game such as Mario Party or Fortune Street. These may be faithful recreations of the games they are based on, or take several liberties with the concept. Usually multi-player, obviously. Mario Party 3; Dokapon Kingdom; Fortune Street Bullet Hell Bullet Hell (known as \"Danmaku\" in Japan) games are a specific type of Shoot-'em-up. Like the name implies, Bullet Hell games feature enemies that literally fill the screen with complex, interweaving patterns of projectiles. Thus the player's main challenge consists not in defeating their enemies but in successfully navigating the onslaught of projectiles without dying. Bullet Hell games were established by titles like DoDonpachi and popularized by the Touhou series of indie games, and are noted for their extreme difficulty. Ikaruga; DoDonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou; Mushihime-sama Card Game A game that simulates playing a card game. The most popular and ubiquitous example is Solitaire, available on just about every computer ever. Over the past decade, Card Games have gained new relevance thanks to the rise of online poker. Uno; Blackjack; Texas Hold 'Em Poker Casual Although it has been often used derisively (contrasted with \"hardcore\" games), Casual is an overarching category that describes simple, easy, and accessible games generally on browsers or mobiles, meant for people who generally don't spend much time playing video games. These games may be watered-down versions of established genres or just simple Action games, much like the earliest arcade titles. Casual games are designed to be played on-the-go, and in shot bursts. Angry Birds; Flappy Bird; Fruit Ninja Character Action A recently-defined sub-genre of Action games. In Character Action games, players take control of a character with a huge arsenal of weapons and techniques, and a complex moveset which includes combos and move variations. Though it may have the structure of an Action-Adventure, the focus of Character Action games is the complex combat system, and finishing enemies in the most stylish way possible. Players are usually graded and rewarded for their performance in this regard. Also called Stylish Action or Extreme Action. Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition; God Hand; Bayonetta CMS CMS (Construction and Management Sims) are a type of Sim game where players must build, maintain and expand a community or project while managing limited resources. Success is often measured by the quality of life in the community or similar metrics. There are many sub-types of CMS games, such as business sims, government sims, and theme park sims. Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis; Roller Coaster Tycoon; Harvest Moon 64 Collect-a-thon Platform Collect-a-thon Platform games are a specific type of 3D Platform game that became very popular in the mid-to-late nineties thanks to games like Super Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie. Their defining characteristic is the existence of dozens if not hundreds of collective trinkets spread out all over playground-like stages, and players must find and collect them all. This may be the game's primary goal or simply an optional objective, but in any case the game is crammed with collectibles. Super Mario 64; Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!; Banjo-Tooie Combat Combat is a cousin of the Action genre that focuses specifically on simulated combat in a specific situation. There are many established Combat sub-genres such as Vehicular Combat, Air Combat, and Mech Combat. These games usually aim to give a degree of realism to the experience without turning into Sim games. They often include a degree of customization as well. Combat games in various forms have always had their fanbase on consoles and PC. Twisted Metal 2; Steel Battalion; For Honor Dating Sim Dating Sims are a popular sub-category of Visual Novels, which have the same presentation and gameplay as their parent genre. However, the player's main objective is to pursue a character as romantic interest, usually given the choice from several available ones. The romantic interest that the player chooses will usually determine the story branch that they follow and the ending they get. These games may or may not have erotic elements (known as \"eroge\"). Though Dating Sims usually feature a male pursuing females, there are \"otome\" games that reverse the roles, as well as \"yaoi\" and \"yuri\" games for gay and lesbian relationships, respectively. Tokimeki Memorial; Katawa Shoujo; Mystic Messenger Dungeon Crawler Dungeon Crawlers are a sub-genre of RPG primarily focused on dungeon exploration and combat, mainly inspired by the Wizardry games. Narrative and overarching story may take a back seat to exploring dungeons, killing monsters, and collecting loot or money. Unlike Roguelikes or Hack-n-Slash games, Dungeon Crawlers are defined by usually featuring a first-person perspective and a turn-based combat system, though there are active-time examples as well. Dungeon Crawlers also tend to feature puzzles and stronger Adventure game elements than the other genres mentioned. Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord; Legend of Grimrock; Etrian Odyssey II Edutainment This is a broad category of games that seek to entertain while they educate players or teach them new skills. Edutainment games include Bible story games, language-learning games, history trivia games, problem-solving games, and many others. As long as they're video games and they're expressly designed to teach the player something or improve a real-world skill, they fit into this category. Oregon Trail; Brain Age; Donkey Kong Jr. Math Endless Runner These are games where the player's avatar is constantly running through a procedurally-generated, endless stage. Players can usually jump or turn to avoid obstacles, among other actions, but cannot stop running. Endless Runners also have driving and other equivalents, and have become especially popular on mobiles. Temple Run 2; Super Mario Run; Canabalt Escape the Room A sub-genre of Adventure games that has been popular with the indie development community for decades, Escape the Room games place the player inside a locked room. Predictably, the main challenge consists in using whatever tools are available to escape said room. Whether these sequences are framed within a larger story or exist individually depends on the game. Some Adventure games include Escape the Room segments as part of their puzzles. Crimson Room; DROOM; 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors FPS FPS (First-Person Shooter) games are a sub-genre of Shooting games that became immensely popular. They are basically Shooting games played from the protagonist's perspective, allowing for a higher degree of immersion and realism. Military FPS games are extremely popular, but these games may also take place in fantasy or sci-fi settings. FPS games may also incorporate an optional third-person perspective, limited melee combat, or narrative elements of Action-Adventures. Online multi-player FPS games are also particularly popular. Doom; Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare; Half-Life Grand Strategy A sub-genre of Strategy directly inspired by tabletop wargames. In Grand Strategy games, the player mobilizes an entire community or country's resources, and must consider a multitude of variables when taking action. These games are usually very complex and take place in a real-world historical period, with sessions that can last hours and battles that can last days. However, there are also simplified and more streamlined entries in the genre. Hearts of Iron; Crusader Kings; Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI Hack-n-Slash Hack-n-Slash is a term often used to describe all kinds of Action games today, but originally it was used to describe Diablo and games like it. These are action-RPGs, usually with a multi-player component, where characters explore dungeons, defeat enemies, obtain loot, purchase new weapons and items, and repeat the process ad nauseaum. However, this usually takes place within the larger structure of a traditional RPG story and progression, which differentiates these games from the more barebones Roguelikes. Online Hack-n-Slash games are also very popular. Diablo II; Dungeon Siege 2; Torchlight II Incremental Incremental games, also called idle games, clicker games or clicking games, are video games whose gameplay consists of the player performing simple actions (such as clicking on the screen) repeatedly to gain currency. This can be used to obtain items or abilities that increase the rate at which currency accrues. Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, Sakura Clicker, Time Clickers, AdVenture Capitalist Interactive Fiction Interactive Fiction games refer to early Adventure games which used text-based input for the player to choose their next action. They also refer to more modern games that blur the line between \"games\" and \"interactive storytelling.\" In any case they are Adventure games with a text-based presentation and an overwhelming focus on narrative over everything else, similar to Japanese Visual Novels but often less character-centric. Photophobia; Slouching Towards Bedlam; A Mind Forever Voyaging Interactive Movie Interactive Movies are a sub-genre of Adventure games that feature full-motion animations or live-action sequences, which play out like a movie. At certain points the player will have to input an action in order to progress or fail. Usually the player's only involvement in these games is guessing which action the developers want them to take. While initially maligned thanks to a drove of bad games in the nineties, Interactive Movies have made a comeback thanks to games with more involving and less contrived gameplay structure. Dragon's Lair; Heavy Rain; Until Dawn JRPG JRPGs (Japanese RPGs) are a type of RPG primarily developed by Japanese studios and usually contrasted with Western RPGs for their different characteristics. The trademarks of JRPGs include a pre-determined party of characters with little customization, relatively linear progression, a fixed story with little player agency, a turn-based battle system, and an anime art style. JRPGs were massively popular in the mid-to-late nineties but lost favor in the next decade. Recently JRPGs have evolved beyond their constraints, while more traditional offerings are still available mostly on handheld systems. Final Fantasy VII; Phantasy Star IV; Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne Kart Racing Kart Racing games are a sub-genre of Racing games popularized by Mario Kart. Aside from normally featuring karts instead of other vehicles, these Racing games are less serious, often featuring fantasy characters and settings, unrealistic physics, and item pickups which can be used against opponents. The general structure of Kart Racing games makes them more amenable to casual players than \"serious\" and demanding Racing titles, though that doesn't mean they aren't competitive or complex in gameplay. Mario Kart 64; Crash Team Racing; ModNation Racers Kusoge Kusoge literally means \"shit game\" in Japanese. However, it is not used to refer to all bad games in general. Specifically, a Kusoge is a game that is unquestionably, objectively bad, but still enjoyable or interesting for a number of reasons. Maybe it has personality, an interesting gameplay feature, or is just stupidly ridiculous, but in any case it might be worth a play for the more adventurous gamer. Zero Wing; Chou Aniki; Zelda's Adventure Life Sim Life Sims are a type of Sim game that put the player in the shoes of a character in the real world or a fictional one, who is simply living their life. The focus is on daily micro-management of resources, income earning, and miscellaneous activities. The game may have an ultimate objective or none at all. Life Sims where the player controls the actions and/or environment of multiple people, such as The Sims, are also referred to as \"God Games,\" and generally don't have a fixed primary objective. Animal Crossing; The Sims; Tomodachi Life Light Gun Light Gun games are a sub-genre of Shooting games primarily designed for arcades. Players normally use a gun-like accessory or peripheral to directly shoot at the screen with a sensor. Due to their format, they are usually played from a first-person perspective. Light Gun games lost popularity with the death of arcades in the West, but have experienced a revival thanks to motion controls appearing on consoles. Light Gun games may also be Rail Shooters if movement is on-rails, but this isn't necessarily the case. House of the Dead 2; Time Crisis II; Virtua Cop Matching Puzzle Matching Puzzle games are a sub-genre of Puzzle games established and defined by the ever-popular Tetris. Players have to place blocks or objects into lines as they fall, trying to put objects of the same shape or color together in order to \"clear\" the line and continue playing. Some Matching Puzzle games have a competitive multi-player element, where players try to ruin their opponent's game with specific power-ups or special abilities. Tetris; Puyo Puyo Fever; Magical Drop F Maze Maze games were popularized by Pac-Man and enjoyed a period of ubiquity before more or less disappearing. In Maze games, the player character has to navigate and potentially escape maze-shaped levels, usually while negotiating traps or enemies in pursuit. Some modern games with an isometric or top-down perspective present Action or Shooting gameplay in maze-like environments. Pac-Man; Zombies Ate My Neighbors!; Hotline Miami Mech Combat A specific type of Combat game where the player controls a mecha, a giant robot or power suit that is popular in Japanese anime and pop culture. As such, this is an almost exclusively Japanese genre. Mech Combat games usually play similarly to Arena Combat or Vehicular Combat games, but usually include projectiles, melee combat, fast travel, and flight options. Mech Combat games may take on the structure of Action-Adventures or consist only of one-on-one showdowns. Armored Core 2; Another Century's Episode 3; Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner Metroidvania The term \"Metroidvania,\" a portmanteau of \"Metroid\" and \"Castlevania,\" was originally coined to describe the gameplay of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. These are usually side-scrolling Action-Adventures with RPG elements. They are primarily defined by their large, fully interconnected game world, which allows for non-linear progression, as the player obtains items and abilities that allow them to explore previously inaccessible areas. While both Metroid and Castlevania have since moved away from this style of game, it is very popular in the indie scene. Cave Story; Axiom Verge; Guacamelee Military Sim This type of Sim game tries to realistically simulate the experience of military combat, whether modern or belonging to a certain historical period. While modern Military Sims may superficially look like FPS games, they lack the unrealistic aspects and video game-y mission objectives of those games. Combat is more tactical than twitch-based, and there are many more variables for players to consider. Lately, online Military Sims have become remarkably popular. Arma III; America's Army; Project Reality Mini-games This sub-genre of Action games refers to titles which may have an overarching gameplay system and/or narrative, but their main content is split into scores of mini-games which can be completed in short periods of time. Mini-games are included in all sorts of other game genres, but this genre refers specifically to games with a gameplay mechanic focused on lots of mini-games, played either procedurally or in random bursts. Multi-player games with lots of mini-games are also called \"Party Games.\" Incredible Crisis; WarioWare D.I.Y.; Rhythm Heaven MMO MMO (Massive Multi-player Online) games allow players to connect with dozens, hundreds, or thousands of others in a persistent game world. MMO games are not a genre unto themselves; there are MMORPGs, MMORTS games, MMOFPS games, and so on. Their defining characteristic is that they are primarily games to be played online with others en masse. Games which have an online component but are primarily single-player experiences should not be called MMO games. World of Warcraft; EVE Online; War Thunder MOBA MOBA (Multi-player Online Battle Arena) games were popularized by DOTA 2, which set the template for the genre. Players choose characters from a roster with pre-determined abilities and face off in teams on large arenas, co-operating to win against the opposing team. MOBA games incorporate elements of RPGs (leveling up, purchasing items), and Strategy games (defending towers, managing henchmen). The MOBA competitive scene is especially lucrative and popular. DOTA 2; League of Legends; Smite Monster Collecting Monster Collecting games are a type of RPG that became very popular thanks to the Pokémon series. These games normally progress as typical JRPGs but instead of fighting enemies directly, the player can catch, raise, strengthen, and put together teams of monsters or wild beasts. This sub-genre fuses elements of RPGs with Raising Sims, but normally with a focus on combat. Some RPGs include a monster-collecting side-game or feature, without being full-fledged Monster Collecting games. Pokémon Gold/Silver; Dragon Warrior Monsters 2; Monster Rancher 2; Spectrobes Musou Musou is a type of Action game popularized by the Dynasty Warriors series. Players choose from a roster of pre-determined characters with a number of special attacks, and progress through large areas full of low-level enemies or mooks, occasionally facing a boss. Musou games are distinguished because progress is made by killing hundreds if not thousands of enemies in crowd-clearing super attacks, pushing your way through endless waves of foes. Recently, many Musou games based on established properties have been produced, due to their simple but addictive gameplay. Dynasty Warriors 4; Warriors Orochi Z; Sengoku Basara 4: UTAGE Open World Open World (or \"sandbox\") games are defined by their non-linear progression. They usually make all or nearly all of the game world available to the player from the start, allowing them to go and explore in whatever direction they like. While Open World games usually have an overarching story and objective, these may take a back seat compared to whatever the player wants to do. Open World-style games became hugely popular in the late 2000s, especially for RPGs and Action-Adventures. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; The Witcher: Wild Hunt; The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Paddle Paddle games are a style of early game that was popular in arcades, mostly inspired by the ever-popular Pong and Breakout. Players manipulate some type of paddle or reflector in order to bounce back a ball either at an objective or at their opponent. There are countless Breakout and Pong clones out there, but in any case they all have more or less the same gameplay. Pong; Breakout; FlingSmash Party Party games are multi-player games meant specifically for a social setting. They may be video game versions of real-world game shows or original games. Party games usually feature accessible gameplay and games based on rounds, where players take turns competing to emerge victorious. Wii Party; TV Show King Party; Viva Pinata: Party Animals Physics Puzzle A sub-genre of Puzzle games. Players have to figure out the physics engine of a game in order to take advantage of its properties and complete challenges by manipulating objects. 2D Physics Puzzle games are very popular on mobiles, while their 3D equivalent reached a new level of popularity with the development of open-source physics engines for games like Half-Life 2 and Amnesia. Physics Puzzles are included in many first-person Action-Adventure and FPS games. Portal 2; World of Goo; Kerbal Space Program Platform Platform games are a sub-genre of Action games where the focus is on overcoming physical obstacles through careful maneuvering and jumping. This usually involves hopping on platforms, hence the name. They usually include some kind of combat, and an Action-Adventure game structure. 2D and 3D Platform games are sometimes separated due to their considerably different mechanics, but they operate under the same concepts. A notable sub-genre is the Collect-a-thon Platform game, which gained popularity in the nineties. DuckTales; Super Mario World; Spelunky Puzzle A basic game genre, in Puzzle games players must, obviously, solve puzzles to progress. They may also be video game versions of real-world established types of puzzles, like Sudoku or trivia games. Pure Puzzle games are now rare, but they have been incorporated into all sorts of game genres, including Action-Adventures, RPGs, and even FPS games. The Matching Puzzle sub-genre remains popular, as do Adventure games focused on puzzle-solving, and Platform games with Puzzle elements. Picross 3D; Echochrome; Monument Valley Programming This is a niche type of game that enjoys certain popularity on PC. In single-player Programming games, players must master and use a programming language mainly to solve puzzles; in multi-player Programming games, two players' programs are pitted against each other. The latter category has a wide competitive scene for all types of games, including tournaments for chess-playing programs. Carnage Heart; Hackmud; Pony Island Pro Wrestling Pro Wrestling games are a sub-genre of Sports games that have developed their own conventions and gameplay systems. Due to their nature they are similar to Fighting or Arena Combat games, but focused more on grappling and strategically-timed holds in order to succeed. Pro Wrestling games may be licensed and feature real-world wrestlers, or be entirely fictional. They usually boast very large rosters and character creators. Fire Pro Wrestling Returns; WWE SmackDown!; Virtual Pro Wrestling 2 Racing One of the earliest game genres, in Racing games the player must simply race and beat opponents to the finish line. Racing games usually but not always involve vehicles, and have different degrees of realism. The most realistic ones might qualify as Vehicular Sims, while the more fantastical ones might fall into the Vehicular Combat or Kart Racing sub-genres. At any rate, Racing is a perennially popular genre on arcades, PCs and consoles, and many games of other genres have incorporated Racing or vehicular features. OutRun; F-Zero GX; Gran Turismo 7 Rail Shooter A 3D sub-genre of the Shooting genre. Rail Shooters are close relatives of Light Gun games. Players progress through a mostly pre-determined path while manipulating a cursor to shoot enemies on the screen.

Sin & Punishment: Successor of the Earth; StarFox 64; Rez Raising Sim Raising Sims are a type of Sim game where the player is in charge of raising and taking care of something or someone, usually a pet.

Modern Roguelikes usually feature real-time combat. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon; FTL: Faster Than Light; The Binding of Isaac RPG RPGs (Role-Playing Games) are a wide and popular genre, usually based on the concepts of tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. Players take control of a character or characters in a fictional setting and progress through the game by acquiring equipment, increasing their character's stats, and/or leveling up through experience. Since their appearance, elements of RPGs have been applied to all kinds of games, but \"true\" RPGs usually retain focus on story and character-building.

While Shoot-'em-ups reached peak popularity along with arcades in the nineties, they have since retained a strong cult following, with new entries on PC being quite common. Shoot-'em-ups with cutesy art direction, like Cotton or TwinBee, are affectionately known as \"Cute-'em-ups.\" Einhander; Radiant Silvergun; Soukyuu Gurentai Shooting Shooting is one of the most broad genre descriptors. Basically, players control a character or avatar and shoot enemies or objectives. Shooting games may be in 2D (Run-n-Gun, Shoot-'em-Up) or 3D (FPS, TPS), and feature elements from several other genres (Platform, Action-Adventure, Puzzle).

Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War; Final Fantasy Tactics; XCOM: Enemy Unknown Stealth Stealth games are a sub-genre of Action-Adventures where the player is encouraged to hide, sneak around, and attack enemies by surprise instead of engaging them directly. Aside from their approach to combat, Stealth games are usually very similar to Action-Adventures. Stealth elements have also been incorporated into more action-oriented games, but a game is only considered to fit into this genre if approaching enemies in a non-stealthy way is usually discouraged. Stealth games rose to prominence in the early 2000s.

Many Action-Adventure games have incorporated Survival elements without becoming Survival games. This War of Mine; Don't Starve; Ark: Survival Evolved Survival Horror Survival Horror is a type of Action-Adventure game that was primarily defined by Resident Evil. Players control a character who is relatively helpless against the enemies they will face, which encourages hiding or running away more often than fighting. They are also characterized by scarce items/ammunition, persistent enemies, and control schemes that limit the player's mobility. As the name suggests, these games usually have horror movie settings, which adds to the tension. Although Survival Horror games are not as popular as they used to be, elements of them can be found in many modern Action-Adventures. Resident Evil; Silent Hill 2; Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly TCG TCGs (Trading Card Games) are the video game versions of (usually) established, real-world trading card games.

Vanquish; Max Payne; Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Vehicular Combat Vehicular Combat games are a sub-genre of Combat games where characters control vehicles and use an arsenal of weapons and items, as well as speed, to destroy their opponents.

Some Racing games have elements of Vehicular Combat but the primary goal is still to reach the finish line, not destroy your opponents. Carmageddon; Vigilante 8; Twisted Metal: Black Vehicular Sim Vehicular Sims try to realistically simulate the experience of piloting a vehicle, whether this is a car, tank, train, plane, submarine, bus, spaceship, or other.
