        "text": "Sci-fi fans know the genre’s just as diverse as they are. There are many subgenres, so if you’re a sci-fi author and you go to publish your book on KDP, you’ll have to pick one while entering your metadata. Here’s a breakdown of all the subgenres to choose from when self-publishing your sci-fi novel through KDP.\n\n1. Hard vs. Soft Science Fiction\n\nNot all sci-fi is the same. Science fiction can be broken down into two broad categories: “hard” and “soft” science fiction. KDP lets you classify your novel as “Hard Science Fiction” but not its “soft” alternative; however, I figure it’d be good to explain the difference.\n\nSimply put, hard sci-fi is distinguished from soft sci-fi by its focus on being scientifically accurate. The Martian is hard sci-fi, while Star Wars is an iconic work of soft science fiction. The Martian depicts realistic and logical scenarios that have actual science to back them up. Star Wars, on the other hand, is a fantastic universe with loosely explained faster-than-light travel and artificial gravity; it doesn’t bother to try to rationalize the elements of its universe, but instead relies on the fact that most of the audience won’t question it, anyway.\n\nThere are times when you might feel like your novel falls somewhere between hard and soft science fiction, particularly if you incorporated a bit of pseudoscience – that is, explanations that sound scientific but are really only a façade of science. Those elements might be enough to placate your average reader, but any real-life scientist would know that you’re blowing smoke up their behind. My Aethertales short stories are soft science fiction, but I did my best to explain certain phenomena and technology using superficially scientific points. As an example, in Aethertales 5: The Last Homecoming, I describe the Arterrans’ “ingenious” use of magnetic fields to augment lunar gravity and retain an atmosphere in some of the larger craters. I made it sound reasonably scientific, but anyone with a physics background would know it’s all nonsense. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but it means it’s not hard sci-fi.\n\nKeep in mind that most of the subgenres listed by KDP would actually fall under hard or soft science fiction, so it’s a little strange that “Hard Science Fiction” is its own option. I would choose “Hard Science Fiction” if your novel places an emphasis on logic and scientific accuracy but doesn’t clearly fit into one of the other subgenres. If it’s soft sci-fi, then choose from the other available subgenres, or just put “General Science Fiction” if those don’t work, either.\n\n2. Action & Adventure\n\nThis is a subgenre that can easily overlap with others. A sci-fi novel could be grouped under any of the other subgenres on this list and still be considered “Action & Adventure.” That being said, if action sequences and swashbuckling adventures are the defining elements of your novel, then it’d be best to consider it “Action & Adventure” first and foremost. For me at least, “Action & Adventure” implies a novel that follows in the footsteps of Guardians of the Galaxy – it’s just good, plain fun. So, if your story has a bit of a comic book feel to it, there’s a good chance it’ll fit in well in this subgenre.\n\n3. Alien Contact\n\nWhat would sci-fi be without aliens? Extraterrestrial life is so common in works of science fiction that you might be tempted to list your novel under the “Alien Contact” subgenre just for including non-human characters. However, “Alien Contact” is referring more to first contact with an alien race – the film Arrival is a good example. If your novel follows the story of a biologist who’s tasked with studying the first evidence of extraterrestrial life and comes to encounter a live alien firsthand, then great, you’re writing “Alien Contact” science fiction. But if you’re writing something like my sci-fi novel The Aetherverse, in which human characters routinely interact with aliens, then I’d list it under a different subgenre. They’re already familiar with aliens; this ain’t their first rodeo.\n\n4. Apocalyptic & Post-Apocalyptic\n\nThis seems to be the dominant type of sci-fi these days – a dark, pessimistic view of the future in which the world is falling apart. Given all the insanity going on domestically and abroad, it doesn’t take much of an imagination to imagine that society’s on the verge of collapse. Even just a few decades ago, sci-fi had a generally optimistic take on the future, so much so that they expected people to be living in a utopia with flying cars by the year 2000. Now, we tend to visualize the future differently. So, if your sci-fi novel paints the future in a dismal light and predicts a total societal breakdown, then you should go ahead and list it as “Apocalyptic & Post-Apocalyptic” when you enter your book’s metadata.\n\n5. Cyberpunk\n\nPersonally, this is my vision of the future – a bizarre juxtaposition of extremely advanced technology with absolute, low-class squalor. With the gap between the super-rich and abject poor growing wider by the day, it’s easy to envision a future in which a wealthy, technologically advanced elite are contrasted by commoners living in third-world conditions. That’s what cyberpunk’s all about: an exploration of societal decay and technological possibilities. Like steampunk, there are certain aesthetics that go with cyberpunk (I think of a dystopian Tokyo with lots of neon lights). However, cyberpunk’s not all about the visuals, as cool as they might be. It’s the theme of a cyberpunk novel that defines it as such.\n\n6. Genetic Engineering\n\nThis one’s really specific, so much so that I’m surprised KDP even lists it as a subgenre. Like the “Alien Contact” subgenre, I’d recommend that you list your novel under “Genetic Engineering” only if cloning or gene manipulation is your book’s main plot driver. For example, my sci-fi novel The Aetherverse mentions the alien Procyon’s genetic manipulation of other species, which I used as a means of explaining why there are so many humanoid species out there. However, it’s hardly a central point. But if I had written that Neanderthal cloning story I mentioned in a previous post, then it’d make sense to list it as “Genetic Engineering” sci-fi – if the protagonist had never been cloned, then the story never would have happened.\n\n7. Military\n\nMany works of science fiction depict so-called “space marines” – my own novel The Aetherverse is no exception, given it constantly mentions the Colonial Navy and their special forces, the Deltas. However, just having military elements doesn’t make your sci-fi novel “Military Science Fiction.” To qualify for that subgenre, you’ll need to have at least one POV character be part of a military organization and actively engaged in armed conflict. “Military Science Fiction” novels take place during a time of war, oftentimes off-world, whether in deep space or on a remote, alien planet. So, if you’ve written a novel along the lines of Starship Troopers, you’re writing in the “Military Science Fiction” subgenre.\n\n8. Space Opera\n\nI’ve got a soft spot for space operas – the original tagline for The Aetherverse was “A Space Opera for Troubled Times,” so clearly, this is a subgenre I’m familiar with. It’s the kind of grand-scale sci-fi exemplified by Star Wars and Star Trek, in which you’ve got epic space battles, chivalrous romance, interpersonal drama, and dangerous missions to save the galaxy. Space operas typically focus on the bigger picture; the characters are important, of course, but the story itself is likely to be more plot-driven. If your novel features characters that are caught up in a grand conspiracy or series of momentous events that threaten the security of the galaxy, then you’re probably writing in this subgenre. Throw in a little melodrama and sci-fi romance, and you’ve got yourself a good, old-fashioned space opera.\n\n9. Steampunk\n\nSteampunk is a subgenre based more on aesthetics than theme; it mixes anachronistic technology with imagery reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. I had to do a little research to see how it’s actually defined; for me, steampunk’s just one of those things that you’ll know when you see it. If you see steam-powered machinery and so-called “retrofuturistic” inventions, then yes, you’re probably dealing with steampunk. These stories are often set in an alternative historical timeline, usually (but not always) the Victorian era, but you’ll sometimes see steampunk works set in the American “Wild West.” Just remember, though: steampunk’s identified by its visuals, so if yours fits in with the Industrial Revolution, then you can go ahead and label it as such with KDP.\n\n10. Time Travel\n\nYou don’t see too much “Time Travel” sci-fi these days; there’s Back to the Future, of course, but in terms of sci-fi novels, the most prominent ones I can think of are The Time Machine by H.G. Wells and Timeline by Michael Crichton, and neither of those are hot off the presses. (I’m sure there are more, but I’m not familiar with them – or my memory’s just shot.) So, if you’ve decided to depict a thrilling journey through time, you can list your novel under “Time Travel” and enjoy your relative lack of literary competition. Pretty straightforward.\n\nNot all sci-fi is the same.\n\nScience fiction is far from monolithic. There are many subgenres you can choose from while self-publishing a sci-fi novel with KDP – clearly, it’s a genre that’s just as diverse as its fans. While adding your book’s metadata, you’ll have to decide which subgenre best describes it, so consider the themes, aesthetics and content of your novel and compare them to the options available to you. When you classify your novel correctly, you’ll let readers know just what kind of sci-fi they’re getting. Pretty soon, there’ll be one more sci-fi fan community out there – one centered all around the sci-fi universe you created."
