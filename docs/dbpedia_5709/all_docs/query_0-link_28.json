        "text": "Midwest Emo is a subgenre of emo music that originated in the Midwest region of the United States in the early 2000s. It is characterized by its melodic, often acoustic-driven sound, and its lyrical themes of heartache, longing, and nostalgia. It is often seen as a more mature and refined version of the original emo sound, and is often compared to indie rock. Midwest Emo bands often feature dual male/female vocalists, and often incorporate elements of punk, post-hardcore, and indie rock into their sound. Popular Midwest Emo bands include American Football, The Get Up Kids, and Rainer Maria."
