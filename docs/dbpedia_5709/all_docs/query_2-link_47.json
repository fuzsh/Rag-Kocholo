        "text": "Video games come in an incredible variety of styles and gameplay experiences. Over the decades, distinct genres have emerged that each offer their own flavors of interactivity. Game genres help players understand at a glance what kinds of challenges and experiences a game will offer. In this guide, we’ll explore the most popular video game genres and their subgenres and highlight some notable examples of each.\n\nAdventure\n\nAction\n\nSports\n\nSimulation\n\nPlatformer\n\nRPG\n\nFirst-person shooter\n\nAction-adventure\n\nFighting\n\nReal-time strategy\n\nRacing\n\nShooter\n\nPuzzle\n\nCasual\n\nStrategy game\n\nMassively multiplayer online role-playing\n\nStealth\n\nParty\n\nAction RPG\n\nTactical role-playing\n\nSurvival\n\nBattle Royale\n\nSports games let players experience their favorite sports virtually on the field and as a manager. Controls and rules mirror professional sporting events with varying degrees of realism. Management modes also allow guiding a franchise to championships. This game genre is always a trend in the video game industry.\n\nCinematic Action-Adventure: Heavily scripted, quick time event driven experiences. Ex: Uncharted, The Last of Us\n\nAction RPG: Roleplaying progression and loot with real-time combat. Ex: Batman: Arkham Series, Horizon Zero Dawn\n\nOpen World Action Adventure: Huge sandbox worlds. Ex: Assassin’s Creed, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\n\nTraditional RTS: Base building and unit control. Ex: Starcraft, Command & Conquer\n\nMOBA: Teams of players, each controlling a single powerful hero. Ex: League of Legends, Dota 2\n\nTower Defense: Building defenses to destroy advancing enemy waves. Ex: Plants vs Zombies, Bloons TD\n\nSurvival Sandbox: Open worlds to explore. Ex: Minecraft, Valheim\n\nSurvival Horror: Surviving and escaping nightmares. Ex: The Forest, The Long Dark\n\nSurvival Simulation: Realistic survival mechanics. Ex: SCUM, This War of Mine\n\nBattle royale games pit a large number of players against each other in a last-man-standing deathmatch. Players scavenge for weapons in a shrinking play zone to become the final survivor. Fortnite popularized the genre.\n\nGenres help categorize the diverse range of video game experiences that have emerged over decades. But games frequently blend genres together into new combinations. The labels serve mainly to give players a general idea of a game’s strengths that match their tastes. By understanding different genres, players can more easily discover new games tailored to what they love most. The variety of genres means everyone can find interactive adventures to lose themselves in."
