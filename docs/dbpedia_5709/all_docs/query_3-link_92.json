        "text": "By Grace Lemon\n\nI recently took a course about gender and the horror genre, which opened my eyes to the sexism that has perpetuated the vast majority of classic horror films (with a few notable exceptions). According to Laura Mulvey’s groundbreaking 1975 essay “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” traditional cinema places the spectator in a masculine viewing position, perpetuating a male gaze that forces female characters to maintain passive roles as the objects of desire. In many cases, the horror genre takes this concept to a new level, using female victimization and violence inflicted on female characters as a form of punishment meant to satisfy male spectators. Fortunately, some directors within this genre have provided reinterpretations of the gaze, satirizing the normalization of violence against women and providing films that offer a more progressive understanding of gender.\n\nIn Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 horror classic, Marion falls victim to many of these traditional tropes. Psycho is commonly thought of as a groundbreaking horror film and generally one of the greatest films of all time, setting completely new standards for portrayals of violence and sexuality in cinema and essentially inspiring the slasher film genre. Regardless, it falls short in its depiction of women when viewed through today’s cultural lens. Marion’s infamous murder scene completely blurs the lines between male pleasure and female pain, comprised of close-up shots of her naked body in the shower. Up until her death, Marion is the constant object of the camera’s gaze, in positions of vulnerability brought on by the male characters. This film perfectly encapsulates the tradition of the active male and the passive female, showing the consequences of these strict gender roles in classic cinema and the ways in which they reinforce cultural violence toward women.\n\nWith the arrival of Halloween in 1978 came the arrival of a key character in many horror films to follow: the ‘Final Girl.’ Carol Clover was the first to actually define this term in her 1987 essay titled “Her Body, Himself: Gender in the Slasher Film.” In a traditional sense, the ‘Final Girl’ exists in the slasher genre, which entails “sexualization of motive and action” and a victim who is a “beautifully, sexually active woman.” The ‘Final Girl,’ on the other hand, is masculinized and desexualized, and this allows her to survive, often only with the help of a stronger man. Halloween follows this tradition, with each female victim being murdered either right after she has had sex or right before she is about to. Their nude bodies are often on display throughout the murder sequences, appealing to the male desire for female pain and objectification. Although not explicitly stated, it is implied Laurie only survives because she is the only sexually inactive member of her friend group. However, she is not able to defeat Michael herself, but instead needs the male psychologist to come shoot him so that she can escape.\n\nTesis, a 1999 Spanish thriller directed by Alejandro Amenábar, completely reimagines the ‘Final Girl’ through a much more empowering feminist perspective. This film follows the main character Ángela, a student completing a thesis on audiovisual violence who uncovers a snuff film ring at her university. Snuff films are something of an urban legend, defined as pornographic films of actual murders, generally with women as the victims. Although snuff films inherently appeal to the male gaze in an extreme blending of female pain and male pleasure, Tesis disrupts this pleasure in its filming technique. While the murder scenes in Halloween maintain the female victims as the objects of the camera’s gaze and do not contain any cuts, the snuff scenes in Tesis cut back and forth between Ángela’s horrified expression and the pained expression of the victim. The snuff murder is also devoid of any sexual gratification or motivation, with the victim fully clothed and her sexuality never explored throughout the film. Also unlike Halloween, Ángela kills the snuff ring leader herself, saving her male friend and reimagining a “Final Girl” that takes an active stance against the violence inflicted on the other female characters. In this way, Amenábar shows the consequences of the normalization of violence against women without succumbing to this violence as an entertainment strategy in his own film.\n\n2009’s Jennifer’s Body, a box-office flop that has more recently garnered a feminist cult following, was originally promoted in an ad campaign that focused on the sexualization of Megan Fox to appeal to a straight male audience, despite the directors’ intention of creating a film meant for young women. Some recent critics claim that the film was ahead of its time, exploring themes of violence and assaults inflicted on young women. It follows Jennifer Check, a high school girl who is transformed into a man-eating demon after a band, composed entirely of men, tries to sacrifice her to Satan in exchange for fame. The sacrifice fails because Jennifer is not a virgin, and this scene thus satirizes the classic trope of women being punished for their promiscuity. The film continues to stray from tradition by giving Jennifer the opportunity to become a monster that fights against and from within the ultimate societal villain: the patriarchy. Although critics against the film argue that the friendship between Needy and Jennifer is anti-feminist because they end up turning against each other, they are only ripped apart as a result of the men who victimized Jennifer in the first place. This film perfectly hits on so many of the gender-based issues that are at the forefront of our culture today, including sexual violence and the blaming of women, and it deserves a critical revisit through a modern feminist perspective.\n\nOne of the most stress-inducing parts of Ari Aster’s 2019 horror film Midsommar, aside from the Swedish cult rituals that include old people throwing themselves from cliffs, is its representation of the mental strain of a toxic relationship. Amidst all of the horrifyingly beautiful imagery and haunting sounds, the film thematically emphasizes the emotional burden of a neglecting boyfriend. The final sequence of the film, which cuts back and forth between Christian being burnt alive inside a bear corpse and Dani’s expression slowly turning into a smile as she watches the barn erupt in flames, almost reads as a symbol of female triumph and freedom from male manipulation.\n\nAlthough each of these directors has begun working to transform female representation in their own films, there is still a lot of work to be done in the genre at large. Whether you believe that film reflects culture or culture reflects film, traditional depictions of women within this genre perpetuate violence inflicted toward women and a suppression of female sexuality. This is not to say that we should not enjoy classic films; we should just acknowledge the movement toward gender equality that has taken place since their release and make sure that the current Hollywood film culture aligns itself with these changes. Tesis, Jennifer’s Body, and Midsommar all prove that a film can still be suspenseful, horrifying, and entertaining even when it is not victimizing women, and represent a positive transformation away from traditional cinema."
