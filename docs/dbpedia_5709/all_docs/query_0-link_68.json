        "text": "Uplifting, resilient, hopeful .... these are words that can be used to describe Cliffdiver's latest single \"IKEA Strikes Back.\" But as we've seen, emo is not always an uplifting genre, working out difficult feelings through song. So Cliffdiver's latest track made us stand up and take notice, and we reached out to the band to get their picks for 10 Emo Songs That Are Actually Happy and Positive.\n\nThe band's Briana Wright, Joey Duffy and Matt Ehler were all kind enough to share their picks, offering insight into how each of their choices impacted their own lives.\n\nBut before we turn it over to the band, let's take a listen to \"IKEA Strikes Back.\" The song is featured on their newly released album Exercise Your Demons, which is now available at this location. You can also pick up the song here and catch the band on tour at these dates.\n\nCliffdriver, \"IKEA Strikes Back\"\n\nNow, see Cliffdiver's picks for 10 Emo Songs That Are Actually Happy and Positive below."
