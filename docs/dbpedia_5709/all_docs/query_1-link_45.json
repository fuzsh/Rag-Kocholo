        "text": "Written by Shawn Coyne\n\nEdited by Rachelle Stewart Ramirez\n\nAction Stories speak to ancient human desires. Readers want to experience heart-stopping fear and excitement and learn lessons of survival.\n\nHow can you write a story that satisfies those desires?\n\nIn Action Story: The Primal Genre, Story Grid founder Shawn Coyne takes you on a journey deep into the meaning of the genre. Coyne boils down insights gained through more than 25 years as an editor and writer to teach you Action Story’s fundamental constraints and patterns. He explores subgenres and setting, and proposes a new way of understanding the traditional cast of characters to reveal their power as agents of light and darkness.\n\nIn keeping with Story Grid Publishing’s goal of helping all writers level up their craft, Coyne provides a practical twenty-point game plan, showing how action stories move forward from beginning to end.\n\nAction stories are part of our DNA, fundamental to our humanity. Let’s learn to write them together.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nShawn Coyne\n\nShawn Coyne is a writer, editor, and publishing professional with over 30 years of experience. He has analyzed, acquired, edited, written, marketed, represented, or published 374 books with many dozens of bestsellers across all genres, and generated over $150,000,000 of revenue.\n\nHe graduated in 1986 with a degree in Biology from Harvard College, with a distinction of Magna Cum Laude for his thesis laboratory research work at the Charles A. Dana Laboratory of Toxicology at the Harvard School of Public Health. After Coyne left the laboratory, his findings were acknowledged and served as the inspiration for Mandana Sassanfar and Leona Samson’s Identification and Preliminary Characterization of an 06-Methylguanine DNA Repair Methyltransferase in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae publication in the venerable The Journal of Biological Chemistry (Vol. 265, No. 1, Issue of January 5, pp. 20-25, 1990).\n\nIn 1991, early in his publishing career, Coyne began an independent investigation into the structure, function and organization of narrative, which he has since coined Simulation Synthesis Theory. His synoptic integration of Aristotle’s Poetics, Freytag’s The Technique of the Drama, Campbell’s Hero with a Thousand Faces, McKee’s Story, among many other story structure investigations with contemporary cognitive science, quantum information theory, cybernetics, evolutionary theory, behavioral psychology, Peircean and Jamesian pragmatism, Jungian depth psychology, Theologian and Philosopher Paul Tillich's conception of \"ultimate concern,\" and fighter pilot John Boyd’s OODA loop serves as philosophical, scientific and spiritual foundations for his teaching.\n\nIn 2015, he created Story Grid Methodology to begin teaching and further developing Simulation Synthesis Theory. Since then he has given lectures on the origin of story, the integration of storytelling and science, and the necessity of telling complex stories to thousands of students all over the world.\n\nIn addition to The Story Grid and Mentoring the Machines, he’s authored, coauthored or ghost-written numerous bestselling nonfiction and fiction titles. His most recent lecture series, “Genre Blueprint” applies his Simulation Synthesis Theory to popular works such as The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien and The Matrix by Lara and Lana Wachowski.\n\nABOUT THE EDITOR\n\nRachelle Stewart Ramirez\n\nRachelle Ramirez helps writers develop their stories and believes stories are our most important catalyst for social change. She is the editor of award-winning and bestselling authors, including Shawn Coyne of Story Grid fame, but her favorite work is with first-time novelists and narrative nonfiction writers. Rachelle received an MA in psychology from Goddard College and attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago’s Masters in Creative Writing Program on a merit scholarship. She served as an art therapist for HIV impacted children, a social worker for adults in crisis, and as an executive director for a national writing community before becoming a Story Grid Certified Editor. Rachelle’s forthcoming novel is Hollow Chocolate Bunnies. Her forthcoming nonfiction book is Story Path: Use Story Types to Finish Your Story. She was recently published in Four Core Fiction. She lives in Portland, Oregon, with her family, ridiculous dogs, and a few too many urban chickens."
