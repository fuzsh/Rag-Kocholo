        "text": "“Filmmaking is a chance to live many lifetimes.” -Robert Altman\n\nWhy do we pay monthly fees to cable companies; Direct TV, Netflix, Hulu. Why would we spend hard earned money to go out to the movie theater or rent a film from the local Blockbuster? The obvious answer that comes to mind is the fact that its entertaining, but why is it entertaining?\n\nIf you look at movie genre statistics you start to see something, ever sense the earliest blockbuster films one genre of movie stood out. If you guessed you could probably get it right, its action. Most people think that what they like to watch, eat, read and think are all personal opinions you have worked up over time, but the media influences more things than you would imagine. Advertisement in for instance movies can influence you to watch a movie you would never imagine yourself watching. Blockbuster movies are a great example, advertisements in the media convince you and your friends that the movie is worth watching. Its a great way for the film industry to gain more viewers, and the action/adventure genres tend to advertise the most. The average American would much rather watch a suspenseful, explosion filled action movie rather than an animation.\n\nMany would argue that the only reason action movies are more popular is because they tend to have a bigger budget, better actors, and more exciting story line. But this also ties into the fact that the way action movies received more income to make better more exciting movies was through advertising more and capturing a broader audience. On the topic of capturing a broader audience, i’ve observed something personally from my experiences at the movie theaters. Action seems to appeal to a broader audience than many other forms of film. If you go to an animated movie screening, the majority of the audience is younger children and parents tagging along with their kids. If you observe horror films the general audience is teenagers and males anywhere from 20 to 40. Compare those to action/adventure and you see a major difference. Action attracts teenagers, young adults, middle aged Men and Women and even some younger children, whether they enjoy the genre of movie or not you can see the most diversity of people in action movie screenings because their ads try to appeal to a more general audience. Even if you don’t consider action your favorite genre of film, the majority of Americans have seen more action movies in theaters than any other genre of film.\n\nSo, why are some film genres more entertaining that others? In my opinion it has to do with the hype of the film, the advertisement genius behind it, and the quality they have been able to achieve by using their advertisement ability. what are your thoughts?\n\n-Drake"
