        "text": "The actors dialogue becomes stronger; their vocal extremes are more prominent in every scene up to the climax. This would show to an audience that he is both very arrogant and rude, or the President is not to be trusted and does not deserve your respect. This conflict between the two characters is brilliant, it creates tension and action; also it is compelling to watch. Jack Ryan only respects one thing, the truth. This admirable characteristic gives him his heroic attributes, he is not a Braveheart or a Conan but he is a hero of his own era; the era of the world’s biggest super power America, and Jack confronts them with no fear and on his own terms. The audience would love him, as he emits heroism and charisma. These unique qualities along with Harrison Ford’s well-known acting ability would attract a large audience. Moreover, you might simply want to see the Tom Clancy novel brought to life in cinematic glory. A deep omniscient voice tells you ’from the award winning Tom Clancy novel’. Now the audience knows the books accolades, they are wondering will the film be a good representation and live up to the accolades.\n\nFinally, the trailer has suspense, thrilling moments, extraordinary, explosions, politics and many more. Needless to say all these factors combine to make a great trailer.\n\nI am going to analyse Bad Boys II. We rejoin the heroes from the first film in an exciting sequel. The Narcotics Detectives are back on the streets of Miami. This time detectives Mark Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) have been assigned to a high-tech task force investigating the flow of designer ecstasy into Miami.\n\nThe trailer commences with night-time footage of the Miami skyline. The footage looks very picturesque and beautiful. The shot switches to a room filled with trained and skilled Police Officers. They look as if they are present at a highly confidential operation briefing. This creates a great atmosphere of secrecy and covert operations. This would be intriguing to the audience. The tone is at the same time one of restraint. There has not been any action up to this point but the tension is rising and usually in action trailers, an explosion is imminent to bring the tension to a climax.\n\nThe next piece of dialogue is ‘since 9/11 we have gone high-tech over the water so the drug runners have gone low’ the purpose of this is to induce a dramatic atmosphere and familiarise the audience to the theme. The officer said ‘ the biggest shipment on record is coming overnight’ .The use of the hyperbole emphasises the film is bigger and better than before.\n\nOut of the darkness of the murky water, arises an officer wearing high-tech attire. We are presented with the vision through the eyes of the Policeman wearing the high-tech goggles. He has night vision; green surrounds the screen with white figures scurrying around. The purpose of this is to show the backbone of the movie; high-tech technology at its best to fight a new breed of super villain.\n\nBreaking through the black of the night a man wearing all white appears holding a burning cross. This creates a sinister tone. Up to this point there had been no music, but music is now introduced to indicate change, it is a quick piano cord that does this effect. The shots switch to an array of evil, old, white Ku Klux Klan men stating ‘white power’ repeatedly, this could also cause controversy. They continue shouting until a new music is heard that indicates our heroes Mike and Marcus are about to be unveiled. In a brilliantly orchestrated display of heroism, the duo discard their false identities. It all symbolises from the evil of the burning cross arises the phoenix, in the form of our heroes. To capsulate the moment, it is played in slow motion. The purpose of this is to heighten the excitement behind the hero, and raise their statue by giving them a dramatic entrance. An audience would find this exhilarating due to the contrast of the eerie and sombre tone at the beginning to the present stimulating and exciting tone.\n\nThe camera gyrates around the duo and halts on Marcus who comically says ‘oopsy daisy it’s the negras’. This injects an element of humour into the trailer, it gives a great contrast from the seriousness preceding it and it subdues the tension. This now lets the trailer flow more fluently, it also lets the audience know that there are elements of comedy throughout the film; as both the leading actors are renown for their comedic abilities.\n\nRapid and high tempo music is introduced, this indicates action, and it is proportional to the new speed of the trailer. We are confronted with the generic conflicting working relationship between the unconventional Police Officers and their sergeant, portrayed in the prequel and films like Beverly Hills Cop. The Sergeant wanting the Officer to conform but the boisterous officers do not acknowledge a word he tells them. Peter Stomare plays the role of the stern Sergeant; his distinction in The Matrix has earned him numerous accolades. He is renown for his wit and humour. In the trailer he does not disappoint. In a witty context, he questions the heroes ‘ what is your job description. TNT. Tactical Narcotics Team, displaying skill and finesse. What finesse was displayed in your work today?’ This plants the seed of curiosity into the minds of the audience; they are left wondering what happened. This might make them want to quench their curiosity by watching the film.\n\nThe attitude in the trailer becomes apparent, with quick clips of a flamboyant mansion being exploded and an exciting car chase, and beautiful women. The trailer use scenes of a sexual nature and explosion to entice the audience to come and see the film.\n\nWe end with a car chase, where Mike the cool calm Casanova is driving at high speeds in a brand new Porsche. He is in pursuit of a car transporting armed criminals. Whilst pursuing the assailants he has to avoid an abundance of miscellaneous objects flying into his path, most unusual is a gigantic speedboat. This would attract car lovers, adults, and action fans. The purpose of this is to show the audience that the film has an abundance special effects and exciting moments.\n\nWill Smith has a world wide fan base from his previous films and series. He has starred in non-other than two Academy Award nominated films of the highest esteemed films like sci-fi blockbuster Independence Day, Enemy of the State and he was an Oscar nominee for Ali. With few critics and abundance of fans, he is a popular actor; he would bring bounty of people to see the film just to see him.\n\nMartin Lawrence is a great comedian and a good actor. He holds the uncanny ability to make any situation comical, as shown in the first scene of the trailer. Off screen Lawrence is often in the news for his outrageous antics. He brings a hint of controversy. The trailer is exciting and humorous, and has hard-hitting action.\n\nIn conclusion, the trailer is very funny and appealing. This created with funny and witty acting of the three superstars, along with the special effects and gripping dialogue it creates a fantastic trailer\n\nThe last trailer is too fast for me to take in one go and too furious for me not to be excited at the prospect of watching the film. Literately, it is simply 2 fast and 2 furious. 2 Fast and 2 Furious is the sequel to the unexpected blockbuster The Fast and the Furious. It is an exhilarating, fast and furious extreme car bonanza. Police Officer Brian O’conner () teams up with his ex-con friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) to transport a shipment of \"dirty\" money for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone. While actually working with undercover agent Monica Clemente (Eva Mendes) to bring Verone down.\n\nThe film will attract the majority of the audience from the prequel. With the addition of Tyrese Gibson as the new heartthrob will bring an even bigger audience. Gibson is an established actor from films such as Baby Boy and he is an R&B singer. Gibson makes the film culturally diverse, as he is a prominent black male in the film and he would appeal to a black audience. Looking for a black hero that does not die before the end of the film. Furthermore Women would be attracted to him, as has a muscular physique and sexual allure. Adolescents and adults would enjoy the film, but it would be a predominately male audience due to the prolific technical jargon about automobiles and shots of aesthetically pleasing women. On the other hand, women will probably find the two heartthrobs attractive as well.\n\nThe trailer commences with a black background and blue writing saying ‘this summer’. The purpose of this is to tell the audience when they can expect to see the motion picture at the cinemas. Simultaneous to this, you can hear the rev of an engine, the purpose of this is to raise the expectation of the audience before the scenes from the film are introduced. Also it is a metaphor for the start of the film because if a car is revving up is has not started yet just like the trailer. This is good because it raises expectations.\n\nThe first person you see is famous rapper Ludacris. Ludacris is a worldwide rap icon, this means he will have an immense fan base that might go to see a film. On the other hand, he could bring critics of rappers trying to become actors but it would also be free advertising. The atmosphere is highly charged, the entrance of a leading character is imminent. As expected Brian O’conner appears, in an acceleration towards the screen in a boy racer fashion driving in a flamboyant sports car. His entrance emphasises the tone of the trailer fast and furious; this makes the audience feel excited. Words appear on the screen in the same format as previously, it reads ‘the new models are in!’ this shows models in the form of the high-tech sports cars. The objective of this is to emphasise that the new film still holds the old values of the first.\n\nThe accelerated and exciting pace of the film commences in a car race involving the heartthrob O’Conner. The determination for this is to stop the excitement from reaching an imminent climax. We are introduced to the actress in the motion picture, played by Eva Mendes in her first major role. Her stunning beauty radiates throughout the trailer. This would make men want to see more of her and go and see the film. She displays abundance of attitude and to coin a colloquial phrase ‘girl power’. She says ‘keep your eyes on the road cowboy!’ she is confronting O’conner whilst he is accelerating to speed of excess of 120mph. The incentive for this is to show that the supposed weaker sex in this case is as fearless as her male counterpart. This should evoke pride in a female audience and make them want to see more of the strong, fearless female character. Proceeding that we are introduced to the other half of the new duo.\n\nGibson is introduced simultaneous to O’conner stopping his speeding car. This transfers the energy of one character to the new one. Gibson arrives in an extravagantly flamboyant mauve convertible. This establishes Gibson as a sassy, seductive, suave and dangerous sex symbol. He introduces a ruff and rugged hard edge element to the trailer. To create a rebellious persona for him, Mendes ask ‘what is his problem?’ Gibson replies forthcoming clip, he states ‘I have a problem with authority’ this creates tension, as O’conner is an authority figure. Gibson is a self-proclaimed bad arse; he displays an abundance of male bravado and attitude, this is an interesting contrast to O’conner. O’conner asks Gibson if he is ready for a adventure, Gibson abruptly replies with ‘crooked cops, drugs, gun and murders! I was made for this bruv’ this hard hitting dialogue is captivating and informative as it tells the audience what they can expect if they came to see the film. In the final shot, Gibson rips off his tight shirt to reveal his muscular physique. I female audience would be enchanted by this particular scene because of the sexual nature of the scene.\n\nTo conclude, they have endeavoured to please all eligible audiences. From the cinematic preference of a young male audience; expeditious and flamboyant automobiles to young divine women. Simultaneously, they attempted to accommodate the cinematic preferences of women; good strong dialogue and an emotional story line with character who have the ability to go up and down the emotion spectrum. Let us not forget voluptuous leading men with chiselled physique. All of these preferences have been established, this has resulted in a good trailer.\n\nAfter some long hard deliberation, the jury is back and the best trailer is Bad Boys II.\n\nClear and Present Danger offered a strong storyline and it did have a copious amount of established actors, but it was not charismatic enough and the trailer was dearth in attitude, this rendered it emasculated. 2 fast and 2 furious was a one-sided affair in the trailer, it needed more diversity, it had action, charismatic scenes oozing from plethora of orifices nevertheless its theme was ineffectual. I think Bad Boys II was the perfect article. With a good plot, excellent special effects and amazing acting, it left an imprint in your mind and left the audience augmented to the trailer. It had abundance of attitude and charisma.\n\nThroughout the trailer, the tension was phenomenal, hilarious comical relief frequently broke this. I would go to see it because I thought the first film had enormous potentially that could be released in spectacular sequel. Therefore, I fathomed the final product would receive my seal of approval.\n\nAll of the trailers have immense potential and will most likely achieve success in different audiences. They all have their own individual characteristics that make them auspicious in their own way."
