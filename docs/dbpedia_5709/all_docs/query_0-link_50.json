        "text": "We at The Honey POP are still in our emo phase. (Tbh, we never left.) The genre is still very much alive, and we’re always looking for more bands to listen to and tell you about. We’ve been huge stans of Albuquerque emo band, Savings, for quite some time now. We even had the privilege of premiering their last EP, Get Well Soon, which is still very well-loved. But Savings just dropped their brand new EP, How Do You Feel?, and we’re absolutely obsessed.\n\n“We got stuck in what “we wanted to sound like” & “who we were as musicians”… Something clicked in our brains and we knew that [‘How Do You Feel?’] would be the foundation of the Ep.”\n\nSam Wilmot, lead vocalist of Savings\n\n‘The Summer’\n\nWe are firm believers that the intro track is so important. It sets the vibe for what’s to come, and Savings did just that. It’s the perfect song to kick off the EP because it’s an absolute banger.\n\n‘How Do You Feel?’\n\nThe title track has been out for a while, but it still deserves mentioning because it still goes hard. This is such a high-energy song, and it’s even better when you’re singing it at the top of your lungs. If you haven’t seen it already, the music video for it is so fun. You can watch (or rewatch) it below.\n\n‘Cry With You’\n\nIs it really an emo record if it doesn’t have at least one song about crying? But this track has such a calming vibe, and it’s probably one of our favorites in the EP. We also can’t get over how sweet the lyrics are. “Spill out your thoughts, and I’ll share mine too. When the evening comes, you know I’ll cry with you.”\n\n‘To Be Honest’\n\nTo be honest, this is another excellent song. We love its chill vibe. It’s perfect to listen to any time, whether you’re home by yourself or if you’re in the car with the windows down, enjoying the summer weather with your friends.\n\n‘Temporary’\n\nThis is the perfect closing track for the EP, and it’s a standout one in general. It truly solidifies that there are zero skips on How Do You Feel? and Savings really is that band. The only acceptable reason not to automatically play this record on repeat is if you’re listening to this song instead.\n\nHave you been a fan of Savings for a while, too, or did we just tell you about your new favorite band? What’s your favorite song from Savings’ new EP, How Do You Feel? Let us know in the comments, on Facebook, Instagram, or by tweeting us @thehoneypop!\n\nTO LEARN MORE ABOUT SAVINGS:\n\nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | SPOTIFY | TIKTOK | TWITTER | YOUTUBE"
