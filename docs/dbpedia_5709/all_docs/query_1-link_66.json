        "text": "TH E T E R M ‘ A C T I O N - A D V E N T U R E ’ is nowadays mainly used todescribe what was perceived in the 1980s and 1990s to be a new and dominant trend in Hollywood’s output, a trend exempliﬁed by the Alien ﬁlms (1979, 1986, 1993), the Indiana Jones ﬁlms (1981, 1984, 1993), the Rambo ﬁlms (1982, 1985, 1988), the Die Hard ﬁlms (1988, 1990, 1995) and the Terminator ﬁlms (1984, 1991), as well as by ﬁlms like Total Recall (1990), Point Break (1991), The Last of the Mohicans (1992) and Braveheart (1995). This trend encompasses a range of ﬁlms and genres – from swashbucklers to science ﬁction ﬁlms, from thrillers to westerns to war ﬁlms – and is thus a clear instance of Hollywood’s propensity for generic hybridity and overlap. The term ‘action-adventure’ has been used, though, to pinpoint a number of obvious characteristics common to these genres and ﬁlms: a propensity for spectacular physical action, a narrative structure involving ﬁghts, chases and explosions, and in addition to the deployment of state-of-the-art special effects, an emphasis in performance on athletic feats and stunts. The hyperbolic nature of this emphasis has often been accompanied by an emphasis on the ‘hyperbolic bodies’ and physical skills of the stars involved: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, Brigitte Nielson, Linda Hamilton and others. It is thus not surprising that the two major books published to date on these ﬁlms – Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era by Jeffords1 and Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema by Tasker2 – both focus on the ideological implications of this emphasis and both contain the word ‘bodies’ in their titles."
