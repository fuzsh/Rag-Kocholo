        "text": "Emo developed out of the hardcore punk scene in Washington D.C. in the mid-'80s. Both the allmusic and Wikipedia pages are good primers. I like how the Wikipedia entry separates emo into three waves. The first wave (1985–1994) includes bands like Rites of Spring, Embrace, and Nation of Ulysses, and the sound was much closer to the abrasive hardcore and punk that spawned it than most of today's MTV-approved emo. The second wave (1994–2000), which many emo purists insist is not true emo, includes bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, The Promise Ring, Mineral, Braid, and Jimmy Eat World, and is generally more indie rock and melodic than the first wave. Many people lump Weezer into this second wave, but I'm not so sure. The third wave (2000-Present) is largely a big misconception of the part of the public and record labels. Even after Jimmy Eat World left behind their emo roots, new fans of the band had so often heard them described as \"emo\" that the tag stuck for their current music, even if it really no longer applied (the Wikipedia entry mentions this). Thus, bands that weren't really emo but sounded a bit like Jimmy Eat World were also branded with the emo tag by people who didn't know the style's history, and then the major labels swooped in and started selling it to the masses. This current wave of MTV- and Clear Channel-approved emo includes Fall Out Boy, Dashboard Confessional, Taking Back Sunday, Matchbook Romance, and Thursday -- bands that have very little resemblance to emo forefathers like Rites of Spring and Embrace.\n\nAs for your question: What's the attraction?\n\nThe audience is mostly teenagers; they identify with it. For many of them, it's their punk.\n\nWeezer is not emo. They're pretty much just straight rock. Think of pretty much anything guitar-based, as someone else points out, that you've heard featured in the big teen-dramas. It's usually overwrought, hand-wringing, \"our love has died and now I will too\" type stuff, but with an edge. It's the music that backs pretty much every reality show that MTV shows. If it's got pretty teens suffering massive depression from minor relationship hiccups, it's probably soundtracked by emo.\n\nyou didn't include the UrbanDictionary.com definitions\n\ntop definitions:\n\n5) Emu pronounced correctly\n\n20) How many emos will it take to screw in the light bulb?\n\nnone. they all cry in the dark.\n\n37) The process of conforming\n\n55) An ice-pick through my ear.\n\nOnly their early stuff. Clarity still had shades of emo, but everything from Bleed American (aka self-titled) on hasn't been emo -- at least as defined by emo's first and second waves. Some argue that the second wave wasn't emo, and that JEW was never emo to begin with. Of course, the irony of that is that Jimmy Eat World's post-emo sound came to exemplify the \"emo\" style at the beginning of the third wave, mostly because people continued mis-labeling them as an emo band even after they'd shed their emo roots. Since the major labels got involved, emo has become nothing more than a marketing term.\n\nI was a teenager during the second wave and I got into many of those bands -- Christie Front Drive, Braid, The Appleseed Cast, Cursive, The Promise Ring, Mineral, Texas is the Reason. That second wave is still what I associate with the term emo, purists be damned. And just as many of the first wave's followers dismissed the second wave, I can't find much to embrace in the current wave of pop-punky, overproduced, MTV-approved emo. It all sounds the same to me, and the whiny vocals make me want to claw my eyes out. Of course, critics of emo said similar things about the first couple of waves, so maybe the third wave has more in common with them than I'm giving it credit for.\n\nNot that anyone asked... My second-wave emo reccomendations:\n\nBraid, Frame & Canvas\n\nJimmy Eat World, Singles\n\nThe Promise Ring, 30° Everywhere\n\nSunny Day Real Estate, Diary\n\nTexas is the Reason, Do You Know Who You Are?\n\nA lot of second-wave emo hasn't aged well, but I still listen to these. Good albums.\n\n\"Emo\" originally started as a more complex and musically satisyfying form of punk rock music, with \"emotional\" sounding singers...just another form of trendy \"underground\" punk-influenced music like \"ska\" became. Now \"emo\" has been re-christened by the media to represent an amalgamation of current rock music trends all rolled into one (cheesy pop-punk music, pretty college boy looks, bad guitar tones, over-emotional or whiney singing) along with a goth-meets-70's-style fashion trend where everyone dyes their hair dark black, cuts it with a fringe, puts on eyeliner and wears girl pants...and everyone has \"sensitive\" feelings like Morrisey or Kurt Cobain. It's just another media-created trend like grunge was, and many of the bands are basically just boy bands, and they are treated as though they are huge rock stars and the new saviours of modern rock. This trend has gotten out of hand. Grunge music was a hell of a lot better than this crap and it at least had some musical vailidity to it."
