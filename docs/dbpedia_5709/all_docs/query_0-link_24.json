With an addictive energy, it’s a pop-punk ripper that feels both timeless and contemporary.\n\nGouge Away – “Stuck In A Dream”\n\n– Gouge Away’s return from hiatus is marked by the explosive “Stuck In A Dream.” With an uptempo bounce and Christina Michelle’s shouted hooks, the song is a shot of adrenaline that announces the band’s powerful comeback.\n\nNØ MAN – “Glitter and Spit”\n\n– NØ MAN’s “Glitter and Spit” masterfully displays rage, tension, and release. An offshoot of Majority Rule, the band toes the line between dramatic screamo and blistering hardcore, offering a compelling metaphor for disrupting the status quo.\n\nGreen Day – “Bobby Sox”\n\n– From Green Day’s new album ‘Saviors,’ “Bobby Sox” stands out with its catchy queer anthem vibe. A blend of ’90s sound and present-day flavor, the song celebrates love in all its forms, making a bold statement against political sloganeering.\n\nSpaced – “Landslide”\n\n– Messing with genre boundaries, Spaced combines Gorilla Biscuits and My Bloody Valentine influences in “Landslide.” This hardcore punk rager goes beyond typical sonics, featuring a one-word chorus built for crowd participation.\n\nSwiss Army Wife – “What Nietzsche Wanted”\n\n– Delivering Midwest-style emo in 2024, Swiss Army Wife’s “What Nietzsche Wanted” checks all the boxes. With strained vocals, mathy noodling, punk speed, and shoutalong hooks, it captures the essence of basement emo with a fresh and energetic approach.\n\nFrail Body – “Refrain”\n\n– Screamo takes a captivating turn with Frail Body’s “Refrain.” A mix of post-rock and black metal influences, the song is both gorgeous and harsh, providing a fitting soundtrack for contemplating life’s insignificance.\n\nCall Me Malcolm – “One Cure to the Head, Two to the Chest”\n\n– Continuing their unique musical approach, Call Me Malcolm’s “One Cure to the Head, Two to the Chest” explores mental health struggles. The single, from their upcoming album ‘Echoes and Ghosts,’ is a eulogy for the parts of oneself affected by medication.\n\nCaptain Jazz – “Oh Sussy Life”\n\n– Captain Jazz’s playful approach to their album caught the attention of Emo Twitter. “Oh Sussy Life” stands out as a climactic, suspense-building screamo song that combines humor with intensity, showcasing a deep love for the emo genre.\n\nIn an effort to cover a wide range of bands, this roundup features one single per album cycle. For more updates and singles from upcoming albums, check out past editions of ‘In Defense of the Genre.’\n\nWhether you’re a fan of punk, emo, or any related subgenre, January 2024 has set the tone for an exciting year in alternative music.
