        "text": "Centurion (15 Feb 2010)\n\nA BLOODY GREAT SLICE OF ACTION!\n\nCenturion isa greatchase story. Loved how even the credits are on the move, which (combined with the music and the landscape) starts the movie off with a sense of urgency and adventure.\n\nWALKING GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE\n\nCenturion definitely delivers as a period piece: the ultra-manly Romans in those costumes we all would love to wear for Halloween but which are too complicated to replicate: the bristle brush Roman helmets, the armor, the leather flapped skirts, chin-protecting sandals, and the swords. Nature plays a large part, especially the forest, in taking us back to a primal state of fear. The misty forest setting of the first big battle gives the movie a mystical feel with danger lurking around every tree trunk. Something as commonplace as soldiers marching a trail becomes dangerous when sounds are heard in the distance and mist and trees hide whatever is lurking. The Roman soldiers hurriedly get into a military square formation and present shields in unison (a sound that should strike fear into an enemy when all that metal hits the ground at one time).\n\n\"Whatever comes out of that mist, men, youwillhold the line.\"\n\nYou think after you hear the shields hit the ground, they're protected, they're ready, they'reRomans, but you haven't met the Picts. The Picts roll enormous fireballs downhill from both sides that crash through the ranks. So much for organization and strategy. The sight of these hurtling balls of flame against shades of blue and green in the forest and the mist, alone, isworth seeing the movie for. With the defensive squares broken up, the Picts attack and the fighting begins. The repetitivesound of striking steel and the squishy sounds of stabbingincrease in tempodriving the action and the anticipation to a final beheading.The Picts are vicious savagesâ€”its awesome! Awesome is a word that came too mind all too often, if that tells youhowAWESOME the movie is.BLOOD AND BITCHES\n\nWe action movie freaks must be a blood-thirsty lot!There is a generous and satisfying amount of just throat slitting in that first big attack scene, as well aslots of other ways to die involving sharp metal objects. A line spoken after the slaughter, when there are so many bodies and so much blood on the ground: \"The Gods never get their feet wet\" hints at the outcome of the movie, but nothing prepares you for the brutality of the Pict female characters. Centurion features two fearless and ruthless female characters. We have rage, and they know how to use it. They were both convincing in their intensity and brutality.\n\nIn the General vs. the she-wolf fight, the characterEtain is handy with a spear, and uses it as deftly as a knifeand a fork! LOL Her primal scream (!) after she kills is awesome. There's that word again. I liked how the other Pict warrior girl had yellow hairand yellow teeth. For such a small role, she struck a lot of fear!\n\nLOST IN THE FOREST\n\n\"We live united or die divided.\" A chase movie but with a little of thewho-dies-next of the horror film as they are 'Pict' (sorry had to do it) off, or pick each other off. One of those moments action movie freaks live for comes in the form of death by spear to the mouth. As their numbers dwindle [there were only 7 (I think) to begin with], hope and purpose fade: \"The Gods have forsaken us, we make our own chances.\" \"[Hopelessness is the stuff of legend, and legends will get you laid.]\" If you can stay alive. The chase is a little long (practically the whole movie) and at one point I was wondering where the hell are they? when someone onscreen asked the same thing. How far is too far to run for your life? No such thing. [It was a little like the TV show \"LOST:\" running around the forest with guns, only they run faster and use knives, swords, axes, and hatchets.]\n\nCOLD HARD TRUTH\n\nThe sound of striking steel is heard a lot, andthe atmosphere and cold feel and fear is unrelenting as a blade. At one point, it seems Centurion might turn into a love story where the good girl shows up just in time to save her man. SO glad they didn't go that way. But it was good that they had a likeable female character to balance the two evil Pict bitches.As the original group running for their lives dwindles, when they are down to three, it's great how each of them gives their all. They show what Roman soldiers are made of as they make their last stand. Olga Kurylenko as Etain is good in the hand-to-hand combat scene. There aren't too many convincing fist fights with a girl. Loved it. And when there are only 2 left, after all that running and all that fighting, the Roman soldiers discover they fought for nothing. (Won't tell you how or why.) The opening ties in verbally with the ending in a poetic way, but in the end, it's die united, live divided.\n\nI noticed in the credits, the 2nd and 3rd unit directors were all women! BOO YA!"
