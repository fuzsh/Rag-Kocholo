        "text": "DHARSHAN WEERASEKERA\n\nContinuing my discussion of the idiocies in the Sri Lanka Constitution, in this article I focus on the concept, ‘Sovereignty is in the People’ enshrined in Article 3, purportedly the source from which the constitution draws its legal and moral authority.\n\nI shall briefly discuss what I see as the logical contradiction at the heart of this concept, explain what I think are the present ambitions of the Tamil separatists, and finally, explain the legal consequences if the new constitution gives the Tamils more control over the North and the East, and at some time the Tamils demand a referendum on secession.\n\nTHE CONTRADICTION\n\nThe first question to ask is, ‘What does the phrase, ‘In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable’ (Article 2) really mean?’ The ‘People’ of Sri Lanka consists of roughly twenty million citizens. Therefore, for the said phrase to make logical sense, it must mean that sovereignty is in each of those 20 million citizens, or to put it another way each of those citizens shares equally in the said sovereignty.\n\nThe point is that each citizen has a claim to—which is to say owns—a particular fraction of the sovereignty of the country. It is generally recognized in the law that the right to alienate is an intrinsic attribute of ownership. Therefore, the notion that in Sri Lanka sovereignty is inalienable must be understood as meaning that sovereignty is inalienable by anyone or anything other than by the People themselves.\n\nThe above means that, the only way to alienate sovereignty is if each citizen personally and voluntarily relinquishes their portion of the sovereignty in question. Now, let’s consider the glaring contradiction regarding this concept found in the constitution itself.\n\nArticle 83 sets out the entrenched Articles of the Constitution (in order to amend or repeal an entrenched Article one needs 2/3 majority in Parliament plus a referendum). Not surprisingly, Article 3 heads that list. So, in order to amend or repeal Article 3, it requires both a 2/3 majority in Parliament, plus a referendum.\n\nHow does one win a referendum under our constitution? According to Article 85(3), all that is required is an absolute majority of the valid votes cast at the referendum. So, with a 2/3 majority in Parliament, and 50% +1 majority at a referendum it is possible to change or repeal Article 3, or any provision in the constitution where Article 3 is a factor.\n\nTo make a long story short, with 2/3 majority in Parliament, plus a 50% + 1 win at a referendum, it is possible to alienate the sovereignty of 49.9 percept of the population, sovereignty which is supposedly inalienable!\n\nIn my view, if Article 3 is to make logical sense, it should read: ‘In the Republic of Sri Lanka at any given time sovereignty is in 50% + 1 of the People, and is alienable.’ What does this mean in terms of the constitution as a whole? It means that, as matters stand, the constitution is based on a lie: Sri Lankans have been living a lie for the last 40 years.\n\nTHE PRESENT AMBITIONS OF THE TAMIL SEPARATISTS\n\nWhen the war ended, many Sri Lankans especially Sinhala-Buddhists thought that their headache with respect to Tamil separatism was also over. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The separatists are a resourceful bunch, and they started plotting their comeback almost as soon as the smoke of the battlefield cleared.\n\nThe future plan of the separatists was spelt out candidly and boldly in 2012 by one of their most senior members, R. Sampanthan, at that time the ‘Leader’ of both the TNA as well as the Illangai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) under which all TNA candidates contest elections. In his speech at the 14th Annual Convention of the ITAK held in Batticaloa, he said inter alia:\n\n‘The softening of our stance concerning certain issues, and the compromise we show in other issues, are diplomatic strategies to ensure that we do not alienate the international community. They are not indications that we have abandoned our fundamental objectives.’[1]\n\nHe also said:\n\n‘The current practices of the international community may give us an opportunity to achieve, without the loss of life, the soaring aspirations we were unable to achieve by armed struggle.’[2]\n\nIf the option of an ‘armed struggle’ is eliminated (and Sampanthan himself is conceding this) then the only way to achieve the same goal as the ‘armed struggle,’ i.e. Eelam, is either by way of a referendum of the Tamils in the North and East, or by action of one or more of the Provincial Councils.\n\nIn order for a Provincial Councils to affect a unilateral secession it is necessary that the relationship between the Center and the Provinces be that of a confederation and that is obviously an unrealistic goal in the Sri Lankan context. So, the remaining option is to go for a referendum.\n\nUntil almost the beginning of 2016 Mr. Sampanthan and other stalwarts among the separatists, including Mr. Karunanidhi their bastion of support in Tamil Nadu, explicitly called for a referendum on secession.[3] But, they are at present silent on the subject. However, the fact that Sampanthan and his immediate cohorts are silent on the topic of a referendum does not mean that their overall plan has changed.\n\nThe proof of the above is in the latest statement released by V. Rudhrakumaran, the notorious separatist operating out of the United States. In an interview published in the Huffington Post among other places, he says inter alia:\n\n‘If you look at the peace efforts around the world, the most common mechanism introduced and supported by the international community to resolve national questions has been the holding of a referendum. In the case of Kosovo, in spite of the parent state Serbia’s opposition, the international community decided that only through a referendum could national conflict be resolved. We expect the UN or any state power which is keen to solve the national question in Sri Lanka to propose and support a referendum as the central feature in negotiating a political solution. The referendum proposed by us contains all options such as ‘unitary,’ ‘federal state,’ ‘unitary framework with federal features,’ ad ‘independent state.’[4]\n\nTo digress a moment, the following part of the interview is also important, because it gives an idea of the tactics one might expect from the separatists in the near future, and also the new scheme of devolution that might appear in the new constitution:\n\n‘Q: Short of a separate state, is there a power-sharing arrangement that would satisfy you? If so, would you talk a little abut what that might look like?’\n\n‘A: Due to the rigid ethnocratic nature of the Sri Lankan state, we believe only an independent state can provide dignity and security for the Tamils. For an interim period, the Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA) previously proposed by the LTTE could be the basis for a power-sharing arrangement. The ISGA was received positively at the time by the U.S. and the E.U. among others.’\n\n‘Under the proposed ISGA, human right, secularism, the separation of powers, etc. will be guaranteed. It also provided for both the Sinhalese and Muslims in the Northeast to be members of this body. The ISGA specifically emphasized that the Muslim community had the right to participate in the formulation of a role in the ISGA.’\n\n‘However, I want to emphasize that any type of political resolution would be based on the people’s will to be ascertained through a referendum.’[5]\n\nIn short, if Sri Lankans especially Sinhala-Buddhists think that once the new constitution is enacted it will mollify the separatists, they are sadly mistaken. The moment the new constitution is enacted, the separatists will begin the next phase of their attack, i.e. the clamour for the referendum: the raucous din for Eelam will not abate, it will only grow.\n\nIn my view, the fact that the separatists have gone to such lengths to have their ideas published in a relatively high-profile magazine such as Huffington Post, at this particular point in time, indicates that they are confident their primary goals will be achieved with the enactment of the new constitution, and they are ‘loading up’ for the next phase. (Notice for instance that, as if on cue, Wigneswaran’s ‘Elugu Tamils’ have entered the scene.)\n\nTo return, it is generally accepted in international law that there are 3 elements to a claim of self-determination: historical self-governance in an identifiable territory, a distinct culture and national will, and capacity to govern. If the new constitution devolves power beyond what is already the case, for instance, if it dilutes in any way the control that the central government at present has over the Provinces, the separatists will be in a position to claim all three of the aforesaid elements.\n\nThere is much talk in the Sri Lankan media these days about whether the new constitution will introduce a federal form of government to this country. In my view, talk of federalism is a complete distraction. The separatists don’t need federalism to get to their ‘Eelam’: all they need is to show the international community that they have been ‘governing’ an identified territory in Sri Lanka for some time.\n\n(In my view, with a modified version of the 13th Amendment, for instance with the subjects in the Reserved List reduced, the Provincial List increased, and the Concurrent List either reduced or eliminated, they will be able to do the above.)\n\nLEGAL CONSEQUENCES\n\nI anticipate that, Article 2 (‘unitary’ status of the country) will not be touched. In other words, whatever new arrangement of devolution is introduced, it will be called a ‘unitary’ system. So, the only way to challenge the new system if at all is under Article 3, i.e. as a violation of the sovereignty of the country. I agree that, there are a number of options available under this head, but I will not discuss them here.\n\nThe point is this: even if the new scheme of devolution is successfully challenged in the Supreme Court, the most that will happen is that the court will order the new scheme to be put to a referendum also. But, as I pointed out earlier, a 50% +1 majority is all that is needed to win a referendum, and it appears the Government is confidant it can marshal that kind of support.\n\nTo digress a moment, Mr. Lal Wijenayaka, one of the architects of the new constitution, has explained how the government expects to win a referendum, as follows:\n\n‘Q: What about the public support at a referendum?’\n\n‘A: It would be there as long as the two main parties are together, In case Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is divided, the divided section with the government would get at least half of its vote base. The TNA would fall in line. Janatha Vimukhi Peramna (JVP) would also do the same.’[6]\n\nI have no doubt that Mr. Wijenayake is correct in his assessment. Where does this leave the Sinhala-Buddhists? Unfortunately, in the unenviable position of having to look on helplessly as their country is taken from them. There is much talk these days especially among the Sinhala-Buddhists that what is happening is a repeat of what happened in 1815 with the Kandyan Convention.\n\nThe truth is that, what is about to happen is much worse than the Kandyan Convention. In that Convention, the Sinhala nobles handed over sovereignty of the country to the British: there was no question of the People handing over sovereignty to the British, because the People at that time did not have any such sovereignty to begin with.\n\nThe present situation is completely different: sovereignty is now purportedly in the People. So, if at a referendum the People endorse an expanded devolution of power, an expansion that can conceivably lead to a division of the country, it will be a gift outright that the People will find very difficult to question, renounce, or reject in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the contradiction at the very heart of the concept ‘sovereignty is in the People’ as set out in our constitution, even if 50%+1 of the People endorse the aforesaid gift, it will bind the rest also. The irony not to mention tragedy of it all is that this will happen as a result of a constitution brought by the Sinhalas themselves.\n\nThere are some rudimentary safeguards that can still protect the interests of the Sinhala-Buddhists, as well as that of the country. For instance, the term Unitary’ can be defined in the constitution itself, and a specific clause also inserted to prohibit anyone from calling for a referendum for purposes of secession. What are the chances any such thing will be done in the new constitution? In my view, ‘none.’\n\nDharshan Weerasekera is an Attorney-at-Law.
