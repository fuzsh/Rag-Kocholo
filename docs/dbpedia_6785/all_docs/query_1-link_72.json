        "text": "SRI LANKA PROFILE\n\nSet in the Indian Ocean in South Asia, the tropical island nation of Sri Lanka has a history dating back to the birth of time. It is a place where the original soul of Buddhism still flourishes and where nature’s beauty remains abundant and unspoilt.\n\nFew places in the world can offer the traveller such a remarkable combination of stunning landscapes, pristine beaches, captivating cultural heritage and unique experiences within such a compact location. Within a mere area of 65,610 kilometres lie 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 1,330 kilometres of coastline – much of it pristine beach – 15 national parks showcasing an abundance of wildlife, nearly 500,000 acres of lush tea estates, 250 acres of botanical gardens, 350 waterfalls, 25,000 water bodies, to a culture that extends back to over 2,500 years.\n\nThis is an island of magical proportions, once known as Serendib, Taprobane, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, and Ceylon. Discover refreshingly Sri Lanka!\n\nThe economy is transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services. The country has made significant progress in its socio-economic and human development indicators.Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries.\n\nHistory:\n\nRecent excavations show that even during the Neolithic Age, there were food gatherers and rice cultivators in Sri Lanka. Very little is known of this period documented history began with the arrival of the Aryans from North India. The Aryans introduced the use of iron and an advanced form of agriculture and irrigation. They also introduced the art of government. Of the Aryan settlements, Anuradhapura grew into a powerful kingdom under the rule of king Pandukabhaya. According to traditional history he is accepted as the founder of Anuradhapura.\n\nDuring the reign of King DevanampiyaTissa, a descendent of Pandukabhaya, Buddhism was introduced in 247 B.C. by ArahatMahinda, the son of Emperor Asoka of India. This is the most important event in Sri Lankan history as it set the country on the road to cultural greatness. As a new civilization flourished Sri Lanka became rich and prosperous.\n\nIn the mid 2nd century B.C. a large part of north Sri Lanka came under the rule of an invader from South India. From the beginning of the Christian era and up to the end of the 4th century A.D. Sri Lanka was governed by an unbroken dynasty called Lambakarna, which paid great attention to the development of irrigation. A great king of this dynasty, Mahasen (3rd century A.D.) started the construction of large `tanks’ or irrigation reservoirs. Another great `tank’ builder was Dhatusena, who was put to death by his son Kasyapa who made Sigiriya a royal city with his fortress capital on the summit of the rock.\n\nAs a result of invasions from South India the kingdom of Anuradhapura fell by the end of the 10th century A.D. Vijayabahu 1 repulsed the invaders and established his capital at Polonnaruwa in the 11th century A.D. Other great kings of Polonnaruwa were ParakramaBahu the Great and NissankaMalla both of whom adorned the city with numerous buildings of architectural beauty.\n\nInvasion was intermittent and the capital was moved constantly until the Portuguese arrived in 1505, when the chief city was established at Kotte, in the western lowlands. The Portuguese came to trade in spices but stayed to rule until 1656 in the coastal regions, as did the Dutch thereafter. Dutch rule lasted from 1656 to 1796, in which year they were displaced by the British. During this period the highland Kingdom, with its capital in Kandy, retained its independence despite repeated assaults by foreign powers who ruled the rest of the country. In 1815 the kingdom of Kandy was ceded to the British and thus they established their rule over the whole island. Modern communications, western medical services, education in English, as well as the plantation industry (first coffee then tea, rubber and coconut) developed during British rule. By a process of peaceful, constitutional evolution, Sri Lanka won back her independence in 1948 and is now a sovereign republic, with membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations Organization.\n\nConventional long form\n\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\n\nConventional short form\n\nSri Lanka\n\nFormer\n\nCeylon\n\nGovernment Type\n\nRepublic\n\nIndependence\n\n04 February 1948\n\nDimensions\n\n430km North to South, 225km East to West\n\nArea\n\n65,610 sq km\n\nTerrain Mostly low, flat to rolling plain; mountains in south-central interior Climate & Seasons In the lowlands the climate is typically tropical with an average temperature of 27°C in Colombo.

It features a golden lion in the centre, surrounded by petals of gold representing the blue lotus flower.\n\nThe base of the emblem is a traditional grain vase sprouting sheaves of rice.

The design approved by the committee in February 1950 retained the symbol of the lion with the sword and the bo-leaves from the civil standard of the last king of Sri Lanka, with the inclusion of two vertical stripes green and orange in color.\n\nThe significance of each symbol of the national flag is as follows:\n\nThe lion in the flag represents the Sinhala race.\n\nThe sword of the lion represents the sovereignty of the country.\n\nCurly hair on the lion’s head indicates religious observance, wisdom and meditation.\n\nThe beard denotes purity of words.\n\nThe handle of the sword highlights the elements of water, fire, air and earth.\n\nThe nose indicates intelligence.\n\nThe two front paws purport to purity in handling wealth.\n\nThe vertical stripe of orange represent the minority Tamil race and the green vertical stripe the minority Muslim race.\n\nThe four virtues of kindness: KINDNESS, FRIENDLINESS, HAPPINESS, EQUANIMITY are also represented in the flag.\n\nThe border round the flag, which is yellow in color, represents other minor races.\n\nThe bo-leaves at the four corners of the flag represent Buddhism and it’s influence on the nation. They also stand for the four virtues – Kindness, Friendliness, Happiness and Equanimity.\n\nThe maroon colored portion of the flag manifests the other minor religions.\n\nThe national flag was hoisted for the first time on March 3, 1950.\n\nSri Lanka National Tree:\n\nThe Ironwood (Na Tree), botanically known as ”MesuaNagassarium” was declared the National Tree on 26th February 1986.\n\nIt was chosen as the National Tree for several reasons.\n\nIt is a tree which originated in Sri Lanka\n\nIts utility\n\nHistoric and cultural importance\n\nExterior posture\n\nWide distribution\n\nColour and nature\n\nAbility to draw and sketch it easily\n\nThis rain forest tree grows to about 30 m high and indigenous to the lower wet Zone of Sri Lanka.
