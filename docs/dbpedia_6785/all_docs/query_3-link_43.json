        "text": "During this unprecedented economic tempest battering Sri Lanka, we must choose a captain who can be the steadiest hand on the tiller. Ranil Wickremesinghe has already demonstrated his ability to navigate turbulent waters and make difficult course corrections, while Anura Dissanayake is an unproven sailor. Wickremesinghe secured an IMF lifeline, initiated debt restructuring, and took unpopular steps like raising taxes and slashing expenditure. His experience and pragmatism give him credibility with global institutions and investors that Sri Lanka can ill afford to lose. Meanwhile, Dissanayake proposes radical policies like debt default and nationalization that could completely alienate international partners. His socialist ideology raises concerns about future cooperation. In a crisis, prudent experience often trumps idealistic rhetoric. Wickremesinghe is already underway steering Sri Lanka back from the abyss. Abandoning that steady hand now for an unpredictable newcomer risks capsizing the economy entirely. Evaluate the candidates by who can best guide the ship to calmer seas.\n\nKey CSOs Concerned about Lack of Progress on Anti-Corruption Towards Economic Recovery The Civil Society Initiative on Anti-Corruption Reform for Economic Recovery comprising Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), Verit√© Research, the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA), Sarvodaya, People‚Äôs Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) and the National Peace Council (NPC) (the CSI Core Group) notes the news that the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has this week concluded the first review of the 48-month EFF-supported program for Sri Lanka, and confirmed that Sri Lanka will have access to SDR 254 million (about US$330 million). The CSI Core Group reiterates its view that governance and anti-corruption priorities that have been highlighted by CSOs in Sri Lanka as well as the IMF in their respective governance diagnostics, are a necessary foundation for economic recovery in Sri Lanka. Not giving adequate priority to these actions is likely to set Sri Lanka up for a second round of debt crisis in the next five years.

The event, titled ‚ÄòSri Lanka: Pathways to Debt Sustainability & Governance Reform‚Äô was held on Friday 13 October at the Kenzi Menara Palace in Marrakesh, Morocco. It was hosted by organisations connected to the ‚ÄòSri Lankan Civil Society Initiative on Anti-Corruption Reform for Economic Recovery‚Äô, including Verit√© Research. The speakers included Verit√© Research Executive Director Dr. Nishan de Mel, Transparency International Sri Lanka Executive Director Nadishani Perera and Global Sovereign Advisory Senior Research Analyst Theo Maret. The discussion was moderated by Jorgelina do Rosario from Thomson Reuters. Dr. Nishan de Mel, Executive Director of Verit√© Research, underscored the foundational significance of governance in achieving debt sustainability in Sri Lanka. He emphasised the need for outcome-focused approaches and binding governance commitments from international entities such as the IMF, especially in a status-quo governance scenario like Sri Lanka's. As a case in point, Dr. de Mel cited Sri Lanka's incomplete IMF commitment to creating a fiscal transparency platform. He argued that fulfilling this commitment could serve as a powerful signal that the IMF places a significant focus on governance issues. Such actions, he noted, would be pivotal and key to addressing the foundational problems in Sri Lanka. Transparency was highlighted as a non-negotiable aspect, with Dr. de Mel urging immediate action to prevent moral hazard situations arising from lenient governance commitments.

The country's economy and its people are intrinsically intertwined. The government has to carry out the reforms in a democratic manner. What can the government and people do in a situation like this?

In 2022, the country defaulted on its foreign debt of over $50 billion and saw an estimated 5.8 million people fall into poverty. Signs of recovery have been encouraging under the presidency of Ranil Wickremesinghe, but Sri Lanka is not out of the woods yet. And with presidential elections looming in late 2024, there is uncertainty surrounding the direction of future economic policy. Join us on 20 May, in London or online, as leading experts discuss the nation's journey from debt to sustainable growth, exploring key challenges and policies that will shape Sri Lanka's economic future. Director of our International Economic Development Group Dirk Willem te Velde will chair a discussion with panellists: üîµ Ganeshan Wignaraja (Visiting Senior Fellow, ODI) üîµ Indrajit Coomaraswamy (Former Governor of Central Bank of Sri Lanka) üîµ Sharmini Cooray (Former Director of Institute for Capacity Development, International Monetary Fund) üîµ Phyllis Papadavid (Senior Research Associate, ODI) üîµShanta Devarajan (Professor of the Practice of International Development, Georgetown University‚Äôs Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service) Register here: https://buff.ly/3wq9PAu #SriLanka #EconomicRecovery #DebtRestructuring #EconomicGrowth #SustainableDevelopment #EconomicTransformation\n\nSince the 2022 debt default, Sri Lanka has had significant foreign policy and geopolitical developments, marked by a balancing act between the major powers and regional alliances. The country continued to navigate its relationships with traditional bilateral partners such as India, China and the West while also engaging with emerging partners in the Southeast Asian region. Amidst these diplomatic endeavours, managing domestic political interests remains challenging, particularly in light of past ethnic and religious tensions and social instability during the 2022 economic crisis, write Rajni Gamage and Muhammad Saad Ul Haque.

Join our Visiting Senior Fellow, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, for an insightful guest lecture exploring this critical topic, organised by the Centre for Poverty Analysis. Ganeshan will delve into: ‚ñ™ The root causes behind Sri Lanka's worst economic downturn in over 70 years, including economic mismanagement and policy missteps. ‚ñ™ The early 2024 stabilisation efforts led by the new government and the role of International Monetary Fund support and Indian aid in the recovery. ‚ñ™ Key policy lessons for other countries facing similar challenges. ‚ñ™ The potential risks and opportunities presented by upcoming elections. As Sri Lanka works to move from debt to transformation, ODI is proud to be supporting growth reforms in the country. üåê Don't miss this insightful discussion!
