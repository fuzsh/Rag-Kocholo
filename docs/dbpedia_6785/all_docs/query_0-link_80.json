        "text": "OnâAugustâ26,âAmbassador Qi Zhenhong published a signed article titled âFrom One-China Principle to âYuan Wang 5â:âLetâs Join Hands and Resolutely Safeguard Our Sovereignty, Independence and Territorial Integrityâon theâSriâLankaâGuardian. Here is the full text:â\n\nIn recent days, two pieces of news about China have widely caught the eye in Sri Lanka. Early this month, after the U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosiâs sneaky visit to Chinaâs Taiwan region, the Chinese side responded with firm countermeasures immediately. Over 170 countries around the world have all expressed their firm support for the One-China Principle and strong objection against the US provocation. Iâm grateful to see that H.E. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, many Sri Lankaâs political parties and social groups have also openly spoken up for justice in support of China. Meanwhile, in the middle of this month, with Chinaâand Sri Lanka having altogether resisted the rude and unreasonable interference from third parties, the Chinese scientific research vessel âYuan Wang 5â has successfully docked at the Hambantota Port for replenishment after receiving theâlatest approval from the Sri Lankan government. Those two matters may seem irrelevant and thousands of miles apart, but both share a same great significance between China and Sri Lanka, that is to jointly safeguard each otherâs sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The two matters, both the process and results, have also fully shown a fine tradition in our bilateral relations, that is since the diplomatic ties was established 65 years ago, China and Sri Lanka have always been mutually understanding, respecting and supporting each other on issues of core interests and major concerns.\n\nIn October 1971, the UN Resolution 2758, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) and 22 other countries, was adopted with an overwhelming majority votes in the 26th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Resolution officially acknowledges the One-China Principle and the position that There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory, and the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. It also recognizes PRC as the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. Since then, the One-China Principle has become a common understanding of the international society and a basic norm of international relations, and upon that principle, 181 countries including the US have established diplomatic relations with the Peopleâs Republic of China.\n\nNancy Pelosiâs visit is a serious violation of the One-China Principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiquÃ©s. It seriously infringes on Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. However, I noticed that someâlocal newspapers have forwarded voices from western media, falsely claimed that China âoverreacts, escalates the tension and changes the Taiwan Strait status quoâ, which are just their habitual tactics of standing facts on the heads and of a thief crying \"stop thief\".âItâis the US and the Taiwan separatists that commits irresponsible acts, changes and escalates the Taiwan Strait situation, not China. China has every reason to respond unhesitantly to the severe impacts caused by the Taiwan visit of Speaker Pelosi, second in line to the US presidency and the No. 3 official of the US government.\n\nUpholding the One-China Principle is not only about safeguarding Chinaâs core interests, but also safeguarding the UN Charter and the basic norms of international relations. If China and the international society had not resisted such extremely irresponsible and irrational acts by the US side, the general principle of Non-Interference, National Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity in the international relations would have just become a mere scrap of paper. Moreâseriously, the world might slide back to jungle rules and barbarianâtimes. With separatists and extremists being encouraged, national sovereignty and territorial integrity of medium and small countries might be severely challenged. The peace and stability in the region and the world enjoyed by countries including Sri Lanka would also suffer serious damages.\n\nLooking back at the great history of the island, Sri Lanka who overcome aggression from its northern neighbor for 17 times, colonization by the west for 450 years, and an anti-terrorism war for nearly 3 decades, isânow still standing in the worldâbravelyâand proudly. Any infringement on the national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka shall not be tolerated. Approving a foreign vesselâs port call at Hambantota or any other port for replenishment is a decision made by the Sri Lankan government completely within its sovereignty, not to mention all the scientific research activities of âYuan Wang 5â comply with the international law and common international practice. External obstruction based on so called âsecurity concernsâ but without any evidence from certain forces is de facto a thorough interference into Sri Lankaâs sovereignty and independence. Fortunately, with China and Sri Lankaâs joint efforts, the incident was resolved properly, which not only safeguards Sri Lankaâs sovereignty and independence, but also defend the international fairness and justice once again.\n\nJust like Sri Lanka, China had suffered a hundred years of humiliation from 1840 till 1949. Because of the similar dark experience, China has always been supporting Sri Lanka in the international fora for protecting its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We will continue to do that. Inâcontrast, some countries, far or near, always make various groundless excuses to bully Sri Lanka, and trample on Sri Lankaâs sovereignty and independence repeatedly. Next month, the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council will be held in Geneva where human rights issues in Sri Lanka might probably be stirred up again. As the Sri Lankan people are still grappling with severe economic and humanitarian difficulties, many might wonder what those countries who have been always preaching about human rights will actually do. Will they help Sri Lanka to ease its human rights crisis by providing concrete support? Or will they again use human rights as a cover-up tool to interfere into the island nationâs internal affairs and continue to rub salt into the wound of Sri Lankan people? Just letâs wait and see.\n\nâ"
