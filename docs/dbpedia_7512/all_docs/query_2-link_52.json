        "text": "Literary translation is a love affair. Depending on the context, it could be love at first sight or hot pursuits of a lover’s elusive nodding approval. In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith. Or an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. To think of translation as a love affair does not eliminate the hierarchies that are part of the historical reality. In terms of its symbolic and cultural capital, literary translations always reflect the global order of the centre and the peripheral. Shakespeare remains the most canonical of canonical authors in a language that is now the global lingua franca. Contradictory to the purists’ anxiety that the proliferation of Shakespeare in translation, whether in modern English or foreign languages, will spell the demise of Shakespeare’s oeuvre, the rise of a global industry of translation speaks to the power of Shakespeare’s words—not bound within the limit of one language and historical period but open to a wide spectrum of interpretive possibilities, a common feature shared by great works of art.\n\nOn 23 April, 1616, a man died, but with his death a legacy was born; one which proved so essential not only to the development of drama and literature, but to language, to thoughts and ideas. To how we profess our love to each other, and to how we express our grief; his influence pervades so much in our lives, because his work has become so timeless in its ability to touch upon human nature. We are talking of no one else other than the Father of English Drama William Shakespeare. This year marks the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death; an event which has brought an appreciation to all edges of the cultural sphere. From television to film, theatre to classic music; the simple breadth and variety of the events being held in his honour speak to magnitiude of his influence. Born in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire in 1564, Shakespeare wrote 38 plays, 154 sonnets and many other poems before his death in 1616. We all bow in reverence to the bard of Avon. I am very happy to share the fact that the November 2016 issue of Daath Voyage was appreciated by the world of Academia from all over the world for its richness and versatility; the credit for which goes to the entire team of Daath Voyage. We encourage writings from both experienced professors as well as young scholars. In this endeavour we hope to carry the torch of research as well as writing forward. Warm regards to our esteemed Board of Advisors and Review Editors for their tiresome efforts in reviewing the articles very sincerely and enriching each and every article with their valuable remarks resulting in the shaping up of this issue. I am also grateful to my revered contributors who have made this issue an enriching reality. Happy Reading! Saikat Banerjee\n\nWilliam Shakespeare His Life, Works and Influence William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright who is considered one of the greatest writers to ever use the English language. He is also the most famous playwright in the world, with his plays being translated into over 50 languages and performed across the globe for audiences of all ages. Known colloquially as \"The Bard\" or \"The Bard of Avon,\" Shakespeare was also an actor and the creator of the Globe Theatre, a historical theatre, and company that is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. His works span tragedy, comedy, and historical works, both in poetry and prose. And although the man is the most-recognized playwright in the world, very little of his life is known. No known autobiographical letters or diaries have survived to the modern day, and with no surviving descendants, Shakespeare is a figure both of magnificent genius and mystery. This has led to many interpretations of his life and works, creating a legend out of the commoner from Stratford-upon-Avon who rose to prominence and in the process wrote many of the seminal works that provide the foundation for the current English language. Shakespeare's real name was recorded as Gulielmus Shakspere at his baptism in 1564, which is the Latin word for William. He called himself 'Will' in his Sonnets and most of his contemporaries referred to him as William Shakespeare, so it's safe to say that this was his name\n\nWhen Shakespeare’s plays were introduced to Japan at the end of the nineteenth century, the translators knew that, if the performances were to have any significant impact on the audience, the texts had to be rewritten according to the dramatic conventions of traditional Japanese theatre, especially Kabuki and Bunraku. Since then, Shakespeare’s plays have been appropriated across various literary and media forms, more recently as manga and anime, cross-pollinations of Western and Japanese art forms and ideologies. Drawing on Julie Sanders’s concept of appropriation (2006) and Douglas Lanier’s contention that most contemporary foreignlanguage Shakespeare is “post-textual” and rhizomatic (2010, 2014), this paper discusses the 24-episode TV anime Romeo x Juliet (Studio Gonzo, 2007) as a site of interesting interactions between the Japanese and the Western cultural traditions, storytelling conventions, and old and new ideologies. Imbued with Japanese spirituality, transnational politics,...\n\nPerforming Shakespeare in modern times is an act of mediation between characters and actors, creating channels between geocultural spaces and time periods. The multiplicity of the plural term global Shakespeares helps us push back against deceivingly harmonious images of Shakespeare’s ubiquitous presence. Adaptations accrue nuanced meanings as they move through physical and digital spaces, gaining cultural significance by paying homage to or remediating previous interpretations. As a transhistorical and intermedial practice, global Shakespeares have been deployed to revitalize performance genres, resist colonial appendage, exemplify social reparation. This chapter investigates methodologies for transhistorical inquiry into culturally fluid, contemporary adaptations of early modern texts in relation to digital cultures. In juxtaposing the ways in which localities create site-specific meanings, and the ways in which cultural meanings are dispersed and reframed through ever-evolving forms of digital engagement, this chapter outlines the future challenges and opportunities for contemporary global performances."
