        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nMasters Theses in the Pure and Applied Sciences was first conceived, published, and dis· seminated by the Center for Information and Numerical Data Analysis and Synthesis (CINDAS) *at Purdue University in 1957, starting its coverage of theses with the academic year 1955. Beginning with Volume 13, the printing and dissemination phases of the ac· tivity were transferred to University Microfilms/Xerox of Ann Arbor, Michigan, with the thought that such an arrangement would be more beneficial to the academic and general scientific and technical community. After five years of this joint undertaking we had concluded that it was in the interest of all concerned if the printing and distribution of the volume were handled by an international publishing house to assure improved service and broader dissemination. Hence, starting with Volume 18, Masters Theses in the Pure and Applied Sciences has been disseminated on a worldwide basis by Plenum Publishing Corporation of New York, and in the same year the coverage was broadened to include Canadian universities. All back issues can also be ordered from Plenum. We have reported in Volume 20 (thesis year 1975) a total of 10,374 theses titles from 28 Canadian and 239 United States universities. We are sure that this broader base for theses titles reported will greatly enhance the value of this important annual reference work. The organization of Volume 20 is identical to that of past years. It consists of theses titles arranged by discipline and by university within each discipline.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nE-Book Information"
