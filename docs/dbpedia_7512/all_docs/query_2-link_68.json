In more than 400 articles over more than 550 pages, the Companion offered a compendium of information, observation, and anecdote, arranged alphabetically, and indexed so readers could look up subjects ranging from the University’s history and traditions to its departments and programs, its teams and organ­izations, its personalities and presidents, its defining features and idiosyncrasies. For me, as a long-­time denizen of Nassau Hall, it was a constant companion, and I turned to it often to check a recollection, answer a question, or simply learn something new about some aspect of Prince­ton. The Companion was compiled by Alexander Leitch 1924, then Secretary of the University, Emeritus, who had retired 12 years ­earlier ­after serving for 42 years in vari­ous capacities ­under three presidents, John Grier Hibben 1882 *1893, Harold Dodds *1914, and Robert Goheen ’40 *48. Leitch served as both author and editor, with articles written by some 70 faculty members and alumni in addition to himself. I was one of his authors. As I approached emeritus status in 2019, ­after 47 years serving five presidents—­Goheen, William Bowen *58, Harold Shapiro *64, Shirley Tilghman, and Christopher Eisgruber ’83—­the Press suggested I compile a new, updated Prince­ton Companion, building on the foundation created by my pre­de­ces­sor twice removed. This edition contains 289 entries from the first edition, although not one of them is carried over unchanged. Many had to be updated to incorporate developments since the 1970s; some had to be revised to reflect new discoveries and understandings about Prince­ton’s history; and some ­were trimmed to make room for the 115 entries in this edition that are entirely new. The new entries generally fall into three categories. Some describe new departments, programs, athletic teams, student organ­izations, buildings, and initiatives. Some are devoted to individuals who have\n\nplayed significant roles in shaping the evolution of the University over the past 50 years. The third category includes entries that respond to the call in a 2016 trustee report on the legacy of Woodrow Wilson to be more honest and transparent about aspects of the University that have often been “forgotten, overlooked, subordinated, or suppressed.” This third category includes entries on coeducation, on ­women, and on ­people of color. They include entries on the history of African American, Asian American and Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, Jewish, LGBTQIA, and Native American and Indigenous students at Prince­ton. They also include entries on the Civil War, the Prince­ton and Slavery Proj­ect, the Prince­ton Prize in Race Relations, Protest Activity, and the diversification of campus art, iconography, and portraiture. In some re­spects, the New Companion, like its pre­ de­ces­sor, is a narrative; in other re­spects, it is a reference work. Some of the 404 entries—on winners of Nobel and other major prizes, members of faculty honor socie­ties, Pulitzer Prize winners, governors, members of Congress, and Prince­ ton deans and vice presidents—­provide lists that in large mea­sure do not exist elsewhere. The book also includes a separate section with another dozen lists ranging from Baccalaureate speakers, Behrman Award winners, and honorary degree recipients to Olympians, Pyne Prize recipients, Jacobus fellows, Guggenheim fellows, valedictorians, salutatorians, and winners of the James Madison Medal and the Woodrow Wilson Award. ­There are two other features that are new to this edition. One is a set of three thematic essays that are designed to introduce readers to the overall arc of the history of the University, the development of the physical campus (with maps), and the derivation and manifestations of its commitment to the nation’s ser­ vice and the ser­vice of humanity. The essays are intended to provide a broad overview, which may be especially helpful for readers who are unacquainted vii\n\nviii\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nor newly acquainted with Prince­ton and can benefit from a more global introduction before getting into the details. ­Every development mentioned in the essay on Prince­ton’s history, and many of the structures and initiatives cited in the other two essays, can be explored in more depth in the entries that follow. The other new feature of this edition is a calendar that recalls something that happened in Prince­ton’s history on all 366 days of the year. The calendar includes developments of g ­ reat historical significance, but it also includes entries that help illustrate how much Prince­ton has changed over the years, and some entries that are just for fun. ­There are many challenges in compiling a book of this kind. One is the challenge of what and whom to include. Just as the Prince­ton admission office could compose an excellent class with students fully qualified for admission who had to be turned down ­because t­ here just was not enough room, so could one make a compelling case for topics that had to be set aside ­here for the same reason. With a few exceptions, this edition does not include entries on alumni ­unless they ­were part of the founding of the country or contributed in some special way to Prince­ton’s evolution into the University it is t­oday. Another challenge is deciding what to include in each entry. Many of the topics could be the subjects of se­nior ­theses, dissertations, or entire books; in fact, ­theses, dissertations, and books have been written about some of them. ­Every effort has been made to be timely and accurate as of January 1, 2021, and it was pos­si­ble to update some entries and lists l­ater that year. As in any volume of this kind, errors of both commission and\n\nomission are bound to occur, and for t­hose we apologize. It may be worth saying a few words about two conventions that are followed in the book. When alumni status is known, a gradu­ate’s class numerals are cited. Undergraduate alumni who graduated prior to 1930 are designated by the four numerals of their class year, while gradu­ate alumni from prior to 1930 are designated by an asterisk (*) followed by the four digits. Undergraduate alumni from 1930 on are designated by an apostrophe (’) followed by the last two numerals of the year, and gradu­ate alumni are designated by the asterisk and two numerals. For example, Prince­ton’s 14th president, John Grier Hibben, has numerals 1882 and *1893 to indicate he received his undergraduate degree in 1882 and his gradu­ate degree in 1893. Prince­ton’s 16th president, Robert Goheen, is ’40 and *48. Since the entries on the alumni who have served as president indicate their alumni status, their numerals are omitted in other entries if they are cited in their role as president. When they are cited in their role as alumni, their numerals are included. At Prince­ton’s 250th anniversary cele­bration in 1996, Prince­ton faculty member and Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison delivered a keynote address on “the place of the idea and the idea of the place.” The New Companion aims to shed light on both the place that is Prince­ton and the idea that is Prince­ ton. My fondest hope is that readers w ­ ill find the book useful; they ­will learn from it; they ­will enjoy it; and it ­will become a companion to which they return again and again. Robert K. Durkee\n\nACKNOWL­EDGMENTS\n\nC\n\nonceptual work on the New Prince­ton Companion began in the spring of 2019. On June 30, 2019, I turned to the proj­ect full-­time when I retired from the University a­ fter serving six years (1972–78) as assistant to the president, 30 years (1978–2018) as vice president for public affairs, and 15 years (2004–19) as vice president and secretary. For all 47 years my office was in Nassau Hall. Upon retirement I moved into a carrel in Firestone Library, expecting to remain ­there for the duration of the proj­ect while making active use of the library’s resources and t­hose of the archives. Within nine month the archives ­were closed to permit a thorough renovation of their building and the library was closed ­because of the COVID-19 pandemic. My first thanks go to the members of the library staff who supported me when I was t­here and arranged for me to retrieve materials ­after the shutdown, and to Joseph DeLucia in the office of information technology who helped me set up an office at home, install a new computer, and occasionally get the better of a recalcitrant printer and a mischievous keyboard. ­There would be no book without Joe. ­There also would be no book without the remarkable team at Prince­ton University Press who worked with me from start to finish in conceptualizing the book, obtaining necessary assistance, and providing invaluable guidance and support. My principal contact was Peter Dougherty, director of the Press from 2005 to 2018 and now editor at large for higher education. Peter was unfailingly responsive to my needs and questions, and our periodic conversations always sparked ideas to improve the book. The current director, Christie Henry, was engaged and supportive from day one; Terri O’Prey and Alena Chekanov kept every­thing on schedule; Dimitri Karetnikov worked his magic in figuring out how to prepare hand-­drawn maps for publication; and along with book designer Wanda Espana developed a format for the day-­in-­ history calendar—an idea that arose well a­ fter work on the book had begun.\n\nThe Press engaged an outside firm, MTM Publishing, to assist in proj­ect management. MTM’s president Valerie Tomaselli participated in all the critical planning meetings, but my day-­to-­day contact was with the indefatigable Zach Gajewski. For much of the proj­ect we ­were in touch almost e­ very day and his timely queries and patient oversight provided welcome guidance and support. The Press engaged the cultural historian Jim Ashton as copyeditor for the proj­ect, and I benefited greatly from his careful review of both language and substance. Early in the proj­ect, following its usual practice, the Press asked outside reviewers to make suggestions about the book’s goals and overall design and about drafts of some of the entries. The responses of the reviewers ­were exceedingly helpful, and their suggestions ­shaped and improved the book in numerous ways. While I was the principal author of most of the entries and the final editor of all of them, in many cases I built on the foundation established by Alexander Leitch 1924, editor of the original Prince­ton Companion, and the 70 faculty members and alumni who prepared entries for him. For this edition I was exceedingly fortunate to be able to call upon gifted writers to provide some of the initial drafts. All of the entries on the humanities departments ­were initially prepared by Kathy Taylor ’74, a longtime colleague in the office of alumni affairs and drafter of many an eloquent alumni ser­vice citation and alumni trustee biography. Kathy and another longtime colleague in alumni affairs, Margaret Miller ’80, reviewed the entries related to alumni engagement, and Kathy made valuable editorial suggestions on a number of other entries as well. Wendy Plump, whom I first knew as a local newspaper reporter and who now oversees communications for the Chemistry department, drafted the entries for the natu­ral sciences departments, and Thomas Garling­house, a science writer in the dean for research and communications offices before ix\n\nx\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nr­ elocating to California, drafted the entries on the departments in the school of Engineering and Applied Science. Carol Gould, a longtime member of the University community, helped draft some of the social science entries. In each case they worked closely with members of the faculty in the departments about which they ­were writing and incorporated their suggestions in their drafts. Professors Angela Creager and William Jordan *73 drafted the entry on the History department and Janet Currie *88 drafted the one on Economics. Shirley Tilghman and Tom Shenk reviewed the entry on Molecular Biology and Elisabeth Donohue reviewed the one on the school of Public and International Affairs. Steve Schultz, director of communications for the Engineering school, reviewed the entries on the school and the Engineering Quadrangle. Abby Klionsky ’14, whose se­nior thesis traced the development of Jewish student life at Prince­ton and who as a member of the University staff led a proj­ect developing (In)Vis­i­ble Prince­ton walking tours on African American life, ­Women, Prince­ton Firsts, and Prince­ton traditions, drafted the entries on African American, Asian American and Asian, Hispanic/ Latinx, Jewish, LGBTQIA, and Native American and Indigenous students at Prince­ton, consulting in each case with members of ­those communities. Brett Tomlinson, managing editor of the Prince­ton Alumni Weekly, and Mark Bern­stein ’83, PAW ’s se­nior writer, drafted the entries on the University’s varsity athletic teams. Mark also drafted the entries on Epidemics and the Ivy League. The essay on the evolution of the physical campus and the hand-­drawn maps that illustrate it w ­ ere prepared by University Architect, Emeritus, Jon Hlafter ’61 *63, who retired in 2008 a­ fter 40 years overseeing the development of the campus. The entry on Computing was drafted by vice president for information technology and chief information officer Jay Dominick, and the entries on Residential Colleges and the Se­nior Thesis ­were based on ­earlier drafts by Nancy Weiss Malkiel. University Archivist Dan Linke drafted the entry on the Library. Dan also reviewed several other entries (including the Civil War, the Prince­ton and Slavery Proj­ect, and entries related to the library) and was the final set of eyes on the this-­day-­in-­Princeton-­ history calendar before it went to press. The calendar came about largely through the resourcefulness and per­sis­tence of Helene van Rossum, a former member of the archives staff who shared my determi-\n\nnation that we w ­ ere g ­ oing to find an entry for e­ very day of the year. The calendar and many other entries also owe a debt of gratitude to the archives’ Mudd Manuscript Library Blog, “This Week in Prince­ton History,” a carefully and creatively researched weekly posting u ­ nder the auspices of special collections assistant April Armstrong *14. The calendar was a massive undertaking and it benefited enormously from the painstaking fact-­ checking of Jean Hendry *80. Jean also applied her research skills to the herculean task of compiling lists of winners of the Nobel and other major prizes, members of faculty honor socie­ties, and winners of Pulitzer Prizes and Guggenheim Fellowships. Her patience and passion for accuracy ­were truly inspiring. Jean also helpfully reviewed the entries on Coeducation and ­Women. In deciding which prizes and socie­ties to include, I was guided by an early conversation with former dean of the faculty David Dobkin, and in making a number of other choices and drafting several entries related to the University’s faculty and its academic program I benefited from the guidance of dean of the faculty Sanjeev Kulkarni and members of his staff, including, importantly, Jessica Mathewson ’00. Similarly, dean of the college Jill Dolan and members of her staff ­were exceedingly helpful in reviewing many of the entries in the book that relate to programs overseen by her office. Art museum director James Steward reviewed the entries on the Art Museum, Campus Art, and the Portrait Collection; Prince­ ton University Investment Com­pany president Andrew Golden did the same for entries on the Endowment, Divestment, and Princo; and Aly Kassam-­Remtula, associate provost for international affairs and operations, reviewed the entries on International Initiatives, the Mpala Research Centre, the Princeton-­Ins, and the Prince­ton Institute for International and Regional Studies. Jerry Price, se­nior communications adviser and historian for the department of athletics, reviewed the entry on Athletics and provided the list of Prince­ ton Olympians; Catherine Zandonella and her colleagues in the office of the dean for research reviewed the entries on the University Research Board and Entrepreneurship; Janet Finnie ’84 reviewed the entry on University Health Ser­vices and, along with Karen Fuchs, reviewed the entry on McCosh Infirmary; Alison Boden reviewed the entries on the Chapel and Religious Life; and Kristin Appelget, the University’s director of community and regional affairs, reviewed\n\nAcknowl­edgments\n\nthe entries on the Dinky and the Municipality of Prince­ton. Curt Emmich reviewed the entries on Prince­ton Forrestal Campus and Prince­ton Forrestal Center. Claire Elson, a longtime colleague in the department of h ­ uman resources, helped ensure the accuracy of the entry on University vice presidents, and Steve Runk and his colleagues did the same for the Lewis Center for the Arts. Chris Burkmar ’00 provided helpful background information on ROTC, and Henry von Kohorn ’66, a former chair of the Alumni Council and founder of the Prince­ton Prize in Race Relations, shared information on the history of the Alumni Association. Jennifer Rexford ’91 provided helpful insights on Alan Turing *38. The list of ­others who reviewed individual entries is long, but in each case their assistance was much appreciated. ­Those entries include A cappella (Tom Dunne and Jessica Bailey ’19), Admission (Karen Richardson ’93), African American Studies (Eddie Glaude Jr. *97), Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment (Lynn Loo *01 and Molly Seltzer), Alumni Weekly (Marilyn Marks *86), Annual Giving (Bill Hardt ’63), Anthropology (Carolyn Rouse), Bendheim Center for Finance (Yacine Ait-­Sahalia), Council of the Humanities (Min Pullan, Kathy Crown, and Eric Gregory), Council on Science and Technology (Naomi Leonard ’85), Natalie Davis (Angela Creager), Endowed Professorships (Kevin Heaney and colleagues), the Fields Center (Tennille Haynes), Financial Aid (Robin Moscato), Fundraising (Tracey Storey), General Counsel (Ramona Romero), Gradu­ ate School (Cole Crittenden *05), High Meadows Environmental Institute (Morgan Kelly and colleagues), Institute for Advanced Study (Elizabeth Wood), and Lewis-­Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics (Shirley Tilghman). Other entries include McCarter Theatre Center (Bill Lockwood ’59), University Orchestra (Michael Pratt), Pace Center for Civic Engagement (Kimberly de los Santos), Politics (Brandice Canes-­Wrone ’93), Daily Prince­tonian (Marcia Brown ’19), Prince­ton Neuroscience Institute (Jonathan Cohen), Prince­ ton Plasma Physics Laboratory (David McComas), Prince­ ton Theological Seminary (Anne Stewart), Prince­ ton University Press (Christie Henry and Peter Dougherty), Prince­ton University Store (Jim Sykes), Rhodes and Other Scholarships (Deirdre Moloney), Sustainability (Shana Weber), Triangle Club (Michelle McGorty ’95), University Center for ­Human\n\nxi\n\nValues (Julie Clack and Melissa Lane), and University League/U-­Now (Nancy Lin ’77, who also reviewed the entry on Asian American and Asian Students, Martha Otis, and Carolyn Jones). Two longtime colleagues and friends who tracked down vari­ous materials for me ­were the ever helpful and efficient Cristin Volz and Dan Day. Dan and two other colleagues in the communications office, Laurel Cantor and Iris Rubinstein, spent countless hours locating, obtaining, and assembling most of the photos in the book, and Iris compiled the information for the photo credits. Another colleague in that office, Mahlon Lovett, saved me many hours of research when he managed to unearth files from the 1990s in which some of the entries from the original Companion had been updated. During Prince­ton’s 250th anniversary cele­bration, I served as executive editor of Prince­ton University: The First 250 Years, beautifully written by Don Oberdorfer ’52 and just as beautifully illustrated by J.T. Miller ’70. That book was a helpful resource for me, as was James Axtell’s The Making of Prince­ton University, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker’s Prince­ton 1746–1896; V. Lansing Collins 1892’s Prince­ton Past and Pre­sent; and Bill McCleery’s Conversations on the Character of Prince­ton. I need to make special mention of Robert Spencer Barnett’s Prince­ton University and Neighboring Institutions, which chronicles the history of Prince­ ton’s buildings, pathways, and landscapes. Barnett writes as a perceptive architect, but also as a wise observer of the University’s history and culture. Fi­nally, I want to acknowledge the account of the University’s “prank traditions” that Elizabeth Greenberg ’02 compiled in her thesis “Barely Remembered,” whose title evokes the late-­twentieth-­century tradition of the nude olympics; the work of the Alumni Council’s Prince­toniana committee and ­those responsible for the University’s Prince­toniana website; the archives of the Alumni Weekly and especially the “Rally ’Round the Cannon” columns of longtime P-­rade emcee Gregg Lange ’70; and the digitized Larry Dupraz archives of the Daily Prince­tonian. I close with thanks to my ­daughters and many of my former colleagues for their interest and support throughout the proj­ect, and to Patti Swartz; b ­ ecause she was in Denver for much of the time, more than two dozen of the Companion’s entries ­were drafted during my visits ­there, often with our dog Theo happily napping to the sound of keystrokes on my laptop.\n\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF ENTRIES\n\nA cappella Academic Program Admission Advisory Councils African American Students at Prince­ton African American Studies, The Department of Alexander, Stephen Alexander Hall Alumni Affinity Conferences Alumni Council Alumni Day Alumni Education Programs Alumni Weekly, Prince­ton (PAW) Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment Andlinger Center for the Humanities Anniversary Cele­brations Annual Giving Anthropology, The Department of Architecture, The School of Art and Archaeology, The Department of Art Museum, Prince­ton University Asian American and Asian Students at Prince­ton Astrophysical Sciences, The Department of Athletics Auditing Program Baccalaureate Address Baker Memorial Rink Band, University Baseball Basketball Bayard, Samuel\n\nBeer/Class/Se­nior Jackets Behrman, Howard T., Awards Belcher, Jonathan Bendheim Center for Finance Blair Hall Bowen, William Gordon Brackenridge, Hugh Henry Brackett, Cyrus Fogg Bridge Year Program, Novogratz Brown, J.

The New Prince­ton Companion is rich in history and chock full of ­little nuggets that ­will surprise and delight you. Anyone interested in Prince­ton should own a copy. The book answers thousands of questions and offers unexpected pleasures.” —­Bill Bradley ’65, Basketball Legend, Former United States Senator and Prince­ton Trustee, and Managing Director of Allen & Com­pany\n\n“The New Prince­ton Companion is an invaluable contribution to the university community. With his unique insight into Prince­ton, Bob Durkee has collected an intimate history of the university and the ­people who made this institution what it is t­ oday. Anyone seeking to understand Prince­ton ­will find what ­they’re looking for in this skillfully composed and comprehensive volume.” —­Marcia Brown ’19, Former Editor-­in-­Chief of the Daily Prince­tonian and Correspondent for The Capitol Forum\n\n“I ­can’t think of a better person to update and expand such a massive compendium of material than Bob Durkee. From his days as a Prince reporter through his forty-­seven-­year ­career in Nassau Hall, he has seen (or fact-­checked) it all. His keen eye for editing has resulted in an endearing and useful reference that is a delightful sampling of all ­things Prince­ton. As an emeritus trustee, I especially recommend this book to all current and ­future trustees, as it provides invaluable context for many of the board’s deliberations, and lots of fun facts to share with ­others!” —­Brent Henry ’69, Health Care ­Lawyer, Former Vice Chair of the Prince­ton Board of Trustees, and Former President of the Alumni Association\n\n“In a feat of graceful compression, Bob Durkee locates in one place all the information that anyone interested in Prince­ton might want to consult. A ­labor of love, The New Prince­ton Companion is a careful, serious endeavor in which scholars can have confidence.” —­Randy Kennedy ’77, Harvard Law School Professor and Former Prince­ton Trustee\n\n“Every­thing you ever wanted to know about Prince­ton University is at your fingertips from the man who monitored the pulse of the university for nearly half a c­ entury. The New Prince­ton Companion is an alphabetical reference text of entries from ‘a cappella’ to ‘Wu Hall,’ and also a highly readable series of stories from beginning to end. A must for any Prince­ton aficionado!” —­Nancy Newman ’78, Emory University Professor and Director of Neuro-­Ophthalmology, Former Chair of the Prince­ton Trustee Committee on Alumni Affairs, and Former President of the Prince­ton Alumni Association\n\n“The New Prince­ton Companion is an extraordinary trea­sure trove of insight and information—­past, pre­sent, and even ­future—­that ­will satisfy the curiosity of both the casual reader and the serious scholar with interests in the ‘Best Old Place of All.’ It has been beautifully compiled by Bob Durkee ’69, and it includes impor­tant new additions on topics such as the history of the physical campus, the modifications to the informal motto, and the reconsideration of the legacy of Woodrow Wilson.” —­Shirley Tilghman, Nineteenth President of Prince­ton University and Emeritus Professor of Molecular Biology and Public Affairs\n\nHISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY\n\nL\n\nike the country it helped create, Prince­ton Uni­ versity was founded on noble ideals and aspira­ tions. Over more than 275 years it has expanded its ambitions, deepened its impact, and more fully embraced its commitment to “the nation’s ser­vice and the ser­vice of humanity.” It has developed aca­ demic programs of ­great distinction; created excep­ tional libraries, laboratories, per­for­mance spaces, and one of the world’s leading university art muse­ ums; attracted faculty who are leaders in their fields; and educated students who have gone on to be lead­ ers in theirs. For most of ­those 275 years, it has celebrated this history in words, rituals, and the adornments of a physical space that was the first in the world to be called a “campus.” T ­ here is no other university quite like Prince­ton, and ­there is much to extol. But ­there are aspects of its history that u ­ ntil recently have rarely been acknowledged, including acts of inhumanity and exclusion that are antithetical to the values the University espouses ­today. A 2016 trustee report was unsparing in citing the University’s “failure to acknowledge the pain and sense of exclusion that many p ­ eople of color have ex­ perienced, and in some cases continue to experi­ ence . . . ​partly ­because of the narrow lens through which the University pre­sents its history.” The report called upon the University to be more honest and transparent about its history, and especially about as­ pects that have been “forgotten, overlooked, subor­ dinated, or suppressed.” ­There are entries in this Companion that speak to ­these aspects of Prince­ton’s history, along with en­ tries that speak to its academic accomplishments; its athletic, artistic, cultural, and scientific achievements; and its impact on the world. T ­ here is no way to distill all this history into a single essay, but what follows at­ tempts to provide a broad overview of the evolution of an all-­male, all-­white, colonial undergraduate col­ lege with a narrow classical curriculum into a coedu­ cational, multiracial, multinational research univer­\n\nsity with a curriculum that spans the frontiers of knowledge in the arts and humanities, social sciences, natu­ral sciences, and engineering.\n\nMission Statement In September 2015, the trustees ­adopted the follow­ ing as the University’s mission statement: Prince­ ton University advances learning through scholarship, research, and teaching of unsurpassed quality, with an emphasis on undergraduate and doc­ toral education that is distinctive among the world’s ­great universities, and with a pervasive commitment to serve the nation and the world.\n\nThe trustees also identified 11 “defining characteris­ tics and aspirations” (see page 2). It is striking how few of them pertained at the time of Prince­ton’s found­ ing. The early college certainly had a h ­ uman scale. Its found­ers did establish a liberal arts college rather than a seminary. And they did aspire to prepare stu­ dents to serve the state as well as the church. But the curriculum was narrow and focused solely on undergraduate teaching; the residential experi­ ence was more confining than liberating; and to the extent that t­ here w ­ ere diverse perspectives, they de­ rived largely from the fact that Prince­ton was unique among the early colleges in drawing its students from throughout the colonies. ­There ­were impor­tant early benefactors, but it would be more than a c­ entury be­ fore alumni began to become “intensely engaged and generously supportive.”\n\nThe College of New Jersey, 1746–1768: Two De­cades, Five Presidents The College of New Jersey was founded by three lay Presbyterians and four ministers whose moderate re­ ligious views ­were considered radical if not heretical by the elders of the church. Six of the seven found­ ers graduated from Yale, while one of the ministers 1\n\n2\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nPrince­ton University’s Defining Characteristics and Aspirations The University’s defining characteristics and aspirations include: • a focus on the arts and humanities, the social sciences, the natu­ral sciences, and engineering, with world-­class excellence across all of its departments. • a commitment to innovation, f­ ree inquiry, and the discovery of new knowledge and new ideas, coupled with a commitment to preserve and transmit the intellectual, artistic, and cultural heritage of the past. • a faculty of world-­class scholars who are engaged with and accessible to students and devoted to the thorough integration of teaching and research. • a focus on undergraduate education that is unique for a major research university, with a program of liberal arts that si­mul­ta­neously prepares students for meaningful lives and ­careers, broadens their outlooks, and helps form their characters and values. • a gradu­ate school that is unusual in its emphasis on doctoral education, while also offering high quality masters programs in selected areas. • a ­human scale that nurtures a strong sense of community, invites high levels of engagement, and fosters personal communication. • exceptional student aid programs at the undergraduate and gradu­ate level that ensure Prince­ton is affordable to all. • a commitment to welcome, support, and engage students, faculty, and staff with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, and to encourage all members of the University community to learn from the robust expression of diverse perspectives. • a vibrant and immersive residential experience on a campus with a distinctive sense of place that promotes interaction, reflection, and lifelong attachment. • a commitment to prepare students for lives of ser­vice, civic engagement, and ethical leadership. • an intensely engaged and generously supportive alumni community. ­Adopted by the Board of Trustees, September 26, 2015\n\ngraduated from Harvard. The leader of the group, a pastor in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, was Jonathan Dickinson, who would become the College’s first president. With no college between Yale in Connecticut and William & Mary in V ­ irginia, the found­ers felt it was urgent to establish one in the m ­ iddle colonies. Their charter broke new ground in welcoming students “of ­every religious denomination” and assuring them “­free and equal liberty . . . ​notwithstanding any dif­ fer­ent sentiments in religion.” The College’s loca­ tion in a thinly populated province required it to look elsewhere for students. By drawing its students from 12 of the 13 colonies, the College was poised to become a national institution as soon as t­ here was a nation. The seven found­ers ­were granted a charter on Oc­ tober 22, 1746. They selected five additional trustees and, on April 27, 1747, elected Dickinson as president. The College held its first classes in his parsonage a month ­later. When Dickinson died in October, the College moved to the Newark parsonage of one of its\n\nother found­ers, Aaron Burr Sr., who was elected its second president. When the legitimacy of the initial charter was challenged ­because it had been granted by an acting governor, a new charter was issued on September 14, 1748, by the duly installed royal gover­ nor, Jonathan Belcher. This charter increased the number of trustees to 23. At the time, even in the northern colonies, many landowners, merchants, and ministers owned slaves, and in one of its many findings about the connections between the College and slavery, the Prince­ton and Slavery Proj­ect found that 16 of t­ hese 23 early trust­ ees had “bought, sold, traded, or inherited slaves.” This was also true for its first nine presidents. Eight weeks ­after the new charter was granted, on November 9, the College held its first Commence­ ment, conferring six bachelor’s degrees and its first honorary degree. The honorary degree was pre­ sented to Belcher, an impor­tant early benefactor who gave the College his library of 474 volumes, 10 framed portraits of kings and queens of E ­ ngland (its first art collection), and a portrait of himself.\n\nHistory of the University\n\nAs the College began outgrowing its quarters in Newark, the trustees looked for a location “more se­ questered from the vari­ous temptations attending a promiscuous converse with the world” and nearer to the center of the province. In the winter of 1752–53 they chose the agrarian village of Prince­ton over the town of New Brunswick, ­after Prince­ton more than met the stipulations of the trustees to provide £1,000, 10 acres of cleared land, and 200 acres of woodland for fuel. The citizens of Prince­ton primarily responsible for this ­ were all slaveholding landowners. Principal among them was Nathaniel FitzRandolph who, with his wife Rebeckah, gave the four and a half acres that became the initial campus. The town of Prince­ton had been settled in the late seventeenth ­century on the historic homeland of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans; the FitzRandolphs’ land was along the south edge of a Lenape trail that had connected the Raritan and Delaware rivers. ­Today, FitzRandolph’s gift is commemorated by a ceremonial front campus gate that was long kept closed except during reunions and Commencement ­until the Class of 1970, at its graduation, called for it to be opened permanently “as a symbol of the University’s openness to the local and worldwide community.” The trustees constructed the largest academic building in the colonies, which they proposed nam­ ing for Belcher. He persuaded them to name it Nas­ sau Hall in honor of King William the Third of the royal ­house of Nassau—­a king regarded as a cham­ pion of religious freedom and po­liti­cal liberty. The trustees also constructed a home for the pres­ ident, which is now named Maclean House in honor of Prince­ton’s 10th president, John Maclean Jr. 1816, the first president who never owned slaves. ­Today the names of 16 enslaved African American men, ­women, and ­children who lived and worked t­here between 1756 and 1822 are commemorated on a plaque in front of the ­house. In 1766, six of them ­were sold at an estate sale on the front lawn following the death of President Samuel Finley. One of the other enslaved ­women, Betsey Stockton, became a missionary in Ha­ waii and, l­ater, a beloved teacher in the town of Prince­ton; she is memorialized in a garden between Firestone Library and Nassau Street that the Univer­ sity named for her in 2018. Nassau Hall opened its doors in 1756. Shortly thereafter the trustees bought land to its east, south, and west, widening its frontage on the town’s main street and adding a back campus that reached what\n\n3\n\nl­ater generations came to know as McCosh Walk. ­Today the University’s 600-­acre main campus is part of the 1,000 acres it owns in Prince­ton. In the 1920s the University began to acquire lands in neighboring West Windsor, where it now owns more than 520 acres, and in the 1950s it purchased more than 835 acres in nearby Plainsboro. The Plainsboro lands in­ clude the home of the Prince­ton Plasma Physics Lab­ oratory, the world’s leading center for fusion energy research. Nassau Hall, a national historic landmark since 1960, was designed to h ­ ouse the entire college: it con­ tained rooms for students, tutors, and classes, in ad­ dition to a kitchen and dining room, a library, and a prayer hall. The first state legislature of New Jersey held its inaugural meeting t­ here in 1776. Nassau Hall was a major flashpoint in the B ­ attle of Prince­ton that helped turn the tide of the Revolutionary War in ­favor of the Americans, and, when the town of Prince­ ton briefly became the new country’s provisional capital in the summer of 1783, Nassau Hall served as its capitol building—­the Confederation Congress met in its second floor library. The building would ­later be severely damaged by fire in 1802 and again in 1855. The fledgling college attracted many students who played leading roles in the founding of the country. Around 1765 two debating socie­ties, the Plain Deal­ ing Club and the Well-­Meaning Club, w ­ ere estab­ lished; they w ­ ere succeeded in 1769 and 1770 by the American Whig Society and the Cliosophic Society. In their early days, the socie­ties provided an arena in which ­future leaders of the republic, including James Madison 1771 (Whig) and Aaron Burr Jr. 1772 (Clio), honed their skills of disputation and persuasion. ­Today, Whig Clio remains the country’s oldest college literary and debating society. Over its first 20 years the College had five presi­ dents, all of whom died in office, including Dickinson within a year of becoming president and Jonathan Ed­ wards ­after only six weeks. In 1768 John Wither­ spoon arrived from Scotland as Prince­ton’s sixth pres­ ident, and his presidency of 26 years was longer than all his pre­de­ces­sors combined.\n\nThe “Seedbed” of the Revolution Witherspoon accepted the presidency largely b ­ ecause of the persuasiveness of Benjamin Rush 1760. Rush would become the colonies’ first professor of chem­ istry (at the College of Philadelphia, l­ater the Uni­ versity of Pennsylvania); the founder of the first\n\n4\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nantislavery society; a signer of the Declaration of In­de­pen­dence; an army doctor during the Revolu­ tionary War; the founder of a medical dispensary for the poor and a school for young ­women (both in Philadelphia); and the author of the first textbook on psychiatry in Amer­i­ca. During Witherspoon’s presidency, the College be­ came known as the “seedbed” of the Revolution. Witherspoon was the only college president and the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of In­de­pen­ dence and for six years was a leading member of the Continental Congress. Madison stayed on ­after grad­ uation to study with him, making Madison Prince­ ton’s first gradu­ate student. ­After leaving Prince­ton Madison went on to play a central role in drafting and securing adoption of the Constitution. He served as secretary of state from 1801–09 in the administration of Thomas Jef­ ferson and was then elected the nation’s fourth president. (He also became the first president of Prince­ton’s alumni association when it was formed in 1826.) In addition to Madison (president) and Burr (vice president), Witherspoon taught nine cabinet officers, 21 senators, 39 members of Congress, three justices of the Supreme Court, and 12 governors. Five of the nine Prince­ton gradu­ates among the 55 members of the Constitutional Convention had been his students. Witherspoon added books to the library and ac­ quired “philosophical apparatus,” including the fa­ mous Ritten­house Orrery (still in Peyton Hall), to teach science. He coined the term “campus,” Latin for field, to describe the lawn that separated Nassau Hall from Nassau Street, a departure from the conven­ tional practice in the colonies and Eu­rope of placing academic buildings close to the street. Witherspoon’s eminence and his travels through the south to preach and raise funds resulted in a disproportionate number of southern families sending their sons to Prince­ton. Like other early Prince­ton presidents, Wither­ spoon had a complex relationship to slavery. As a minister in Scotland, he baptized an enslaved man and in the early 1770s he privately tutored two ­free Black men. In 1792 John Chavis, a f­ree Black man from V ­ irginia, began private lessons with him. The Prince­ton and Slavery proj­ect found that his teach­ ings gave a generation of students “a language for challenging slavery.” But Witherspoon also owned slaves, and in 1790 he chaired a committee that rec­ ommended that the state take no action to abolish slavery in New Jersey.\n\nAn Era of Decline, 1794–1868 The American Revolution wreaked havoc with the College’s finances and its enrollment; when Wither­ spoon died in 1794, ­there w ­ ere just over 75 students. This number almost doubled by 1820, but it then plummeted to 87 in 1829 before rebounding to 228 a de­cade ­later. Witherspoon’s immediate successor was Samuel Stanhope Smith 1769, the first gradu­ate of the Col­ lege to serve as president. The high point of his pres­ idency came ­after the Nassau Hall fire of 1802 when he raised funds to reconstruct that building and add two new buildings on the front campus: Geological (­later Stanhope) Hall, and its twin, Philosophical Hall, ­later razed to construct Prince­ton’s first library building, Chancellor Green. The low point occurred when a student riot in 1807 led to the suspension of 125 students (three-­fourths of the student body). In 1812 the trustees gave Smith no choice but to resign, and a de­cade ­later the same fate befell his successor, Ashbel Green 1783. One of Smith’s ideas, to resettle freed slaves in the west, was transformed by two of his students into a plan to relocate freed slaves to a colony in West Af­ rica. This led in 1816 to the founding of the American Colonization Society (ACS), whose adherents believed emancipation would be disruptive to the country ­unless Blacks w ­ ere separated from white society; by 1867 ACS had sent more than 13,000 ­people to Libe­ ria. Prominent supporters of the ACS included many gradu­ates of the College, including John Maclean Jr., President James Carnahan, and Madison, who in 1833 became its president. The first half of the nineteenth c­ entury was a low point in Prince­ton’s history, but a few developments had lasting impact. Early in the c­ entury the College appointed John Maclean Sr. as its first professor of chemistry, and in 1832 two of the leading scientists of the time arrived on campus: physics professor Joseph Henry, l­ ater the founding secretary of the Smithson­ ian Institution, and the astronomer Stephen Alexan­ der. In 1855 the Swiss geographer Arnold Guyot was appointed professor of geology and two years ­later he founded a museum of natu­ral history. Their legacy endures ­today in Prince­ton’s eminence among the leading universities in the world in the natu­ral sci­ ences, including their fields of chemistry, physics, astrophysics, and the geosciences. A second development was the growing presence of students from the south. From 1820 to 1860, 12\n\nHistory of the University\n\nclasses enrolled more southern than northern stu­ dents, and in the Class of 1851 southern enrollment reached 63 ­percent. As early as 1835 southern stu­ dents w ­ ere expressing strong anti-­abolitionist senti­ ments and defenders of slavery frequently won the Whig Clio debates on the subject. On the morning of April 13, 1861, following the Confederacy’s first attack on Fort Sumter, southern students protested on the front lawn ­after northern students raised the stars and stripes over Nassau Hall. With the onset of the Civil War about a third of the students left, dropping enrollment from 314 in 1861 to 221 in 1862. More than 600 Prince­ton students and alumni fought in the war and 86 died, 39 fight­ ing for the north and 47 for the south. A ­ fter the war, alumni classes and the University worked hard to achieve reconciliation; when it engraved the names of its Civil War dead in the memorial atrium in Nas­ sau Hall, Prince­ton made the singular decision to list them without indicating the side for which they died. A third development was the founding in 1826 of the Alumni Association of Nassau Hall. Its first secre­ tary was the College’s vice president, John Maclean Jr., and its first president was James Madison. Creating the alumni association was one of many ways in which Maclean kept the College afloat during Car­ nahan’s lengthy (31 year) and undistinguished pres­ idency. In 1854 Maclean succeeded to the presi­ dency, and ­after his retirement in 1868 he became president of the alumni association, serving ­until his death. Alumni had long returned to campus for Com­ mencement—the centennial Commencement of 1847 drew 700 alumni for a formal dinner—­but individual class reunions did not begin u ­ ntil 1859, with the idea of class gifts following about a de­cade ­later. The first regional alumni association (New York) was formed in 1866 and ­others soon followed. A fourth development of the first half of the nine­ teenth ­century revolved around food and fellowship. In 1843 students for the first time ­were permitted to take their meals off campus, typically at boarding ­houses in town, although some students established what they called “select associations” to provide their meals. By 1856 all students w ­ ere required to make their own arrangements off-­campus, and by 1864 ­these associations ­were being called eating clubs. In 1853 the trustees banned Greek letter fraternities (the first had been founded in 1843 and soon ­there ­were a dozen), which had the effect of driving social\n\n5\n\nlife as well as culinary life to the clubs. In 1879 the first permanent club (Ivy) was formed and by the early 1990s ­there w ­ ere seven; by the 1920s t­ here would be 18 and 75 ­percent of all ju­niors and se­niors would be members. On campus, students began to engage in athletic contests and form student organ­izations in addition to Whig and Clio. As early as 1844 the green ­behind Nassau Hall (now Cannon Green) was the scene of spirited football games. The fall of 1857 brought a cricket club and two baseball clubs. The first baseball game against an outside opponent took place in 1860 (it ended in a 42–42 tie), and Prince­ton’s first inter­ collegiate game was a 27–16 win over Williams in 1864. The first student publications appeared in the 1830s: the Nassau Lit was founded in 1842 and the Nas­ sau Herald in 1864. Prince­ton’s anthem, “Old Nas­ sau,” was composed in 1859, with words written by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck 1862, and m ­ usic com­ posed by Karl Langlotz, an instructor in German who also directed a choral group and taught fencing. In 1987 the words would be changed to make them gender neutral.\n\nThe “Electric Shock” of James McCosh In the aftermath of the Civil War, Prince­ton again in­ stalled a transformative president from Scotland, James McCosh, who took office in 1868, exactly 100 years ­after Witherspoon. Andrew Fleming West 1874, who entered as a freshman in 1870 and would ­later become the first dean of Prince­ton’s gradu­ate school, compared the new president’s influence to “an electric shock . . . ​paralyzing to the opposition and stimulating to all who ­were not para­lyzed.” When McCosh arrived, the College had 20 faculty members (only 10 full-­time) and fewer than 300 stu­ dents. When he retired in 1888, the number of stu­ dents had more than doubled and the size of the fac­ ulty had more than tripled. When he arrived almost none of the faculty had a PhD, but when he left a quar­ ter of them did. McCosh recruited distinguished faculty; modern­ ized the undergraduate plan of study and developed elective courses; and instituted gradu­ate work lead­ ing to master’s and doctoral degrees—by 1877 ­there ­were 42 candidates for advanced degrees and in 1879 Prince­ton awarded its first PhDs. He founded a school of Science, Prince­ton’s first engineering department (Civil Engineering), a department of Art and Archae­ ology, and an art museum. In 1873 Chancellor Green\n\n6\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nwas constructed as the University’s first library. Mc­ Cosh considered the library essential for Prince­ton to become a respected academic institution, and he in­ sisted the building open onto Nassau Street to rein­ force his conviction that the University should face out into the world rather than in on itself. Despite protests from some white students, Mc­ Cosh admitted African American seminarians into his classes and lectures. During his presidency Hikoi­ chi Orita 1876 became the first Asian student to gradu­ate from Prince­ton and 12 years ­later Pedro Rio­ seco 1888 became the first Hispanic/Latino student to gradu­ate. T ­ hese ­were milestone moments, but a ­century would pass before the University would en­ roll significant numbers of minority and international students. The graduations of Orita and Rioseco followed ­those of Prince­ton’s first Native American alumni, which had occurred in the 1840s. Native students had enrolled in the nineteenth c­ entury, beginning with Jacob Woolley, a Lenape, in 1759, but the first to earn a degree was John McDonald Ross 1841. He attended Prince­ton with two other nephews of the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation: William Potter Ross 1842, who succeeded his u ­ ncle as chief in 1861, and Robert Daniel Ross 1843 *1846, who became one of the country’s first Native physicians. McCosh took an active interest in campus land­ scaping and student life. While he was president, the Glee Club, the Banjo and Mandolin clubs, the Prince­ ton College Dramatic Association (precursor to the Triangle Club), the Prince­tonian, and other student organ­izations ­were formed; Prince­ton played in the first intercollegiate football game (1869); and three dormitories (Reunion, Witherspoon, and Edwards halls) w ­ ere built so more students—­including some with lesser means—­could live on campus. McCosh believed strongly in the value to the Col­ lege of lifelong engagement by its alumni, so begin­ ning early in his presidency he started traveling around the country to encourage the development of local and regional associations. By time he left office ­there ­were 17 of them. McCosh prepared the way for the college he inher­ ited from his pre­de­ces­sors to become the university he bequeathed to his successors. In 1885 he proposed changing the institution’s name to Prince­ton Univer­ sity, but the trustees turned him down. The change in name would come 11 years l­ ater, as part of the Uni­ versity’s sesquicentennial in 1896.\n\nPrince­ton University, 1896–1910: Introducing a Gradu­ate School and “Preceptors” The sesquicentennial was a watershed moment for Prince­ton. The University changed its name and shortly thereafter enrolled advanced degree candi­ dates in a gradu­ate school (1901) and ­housed them in a gradu­ate college (1913). Professor Woodrow Wil­ son 1879 gave an address that provided Prince­ton with its first informal motto, “Prince­ton in the Na­ tion’s Ser­vice,” and helped propel him to its presi­ dency. Professor Andrew Fleming West displayed the orga­nizational talents that led to his appointment as the first dean of the gradu­ate school. Scholars from abroad who attended the ceremonies helped Prince­ ton expand the scope and stature of its scholarly pur­ suits, and both during and a­ fter Wilson’s presidency the University created a distinctive undergraduate program that endures ­today. During the post-­McCosh presidency of Francis Patton, the size of the student body more than dou­ bled (from slightly over 600 to more than 1,300) as did the size of the faculty. In 1893 the faculty approved a student-­administered honor system for in-­class exams, and in 1898 the University established an in­ ternational ser­vice initiative that is now called Prince­ ton in Asia. Prince­ton’s first two Collegiate Gothic dormitories ­were constructed (Blair Hall in 1897 and ­Little Hall in 1899) and the Prince­ton Alumni Weekly began publication in 1900. The publication of the Alumni Weekly led to the founding of the Prince­ton University Press, which would publish its first book in 1912 (­today the Press publishes approximately 250 new books each year). In a major departure from pre­ vious practice and in recognition of the growing in­ fluence of alumni, the governing board added five new positions for trustees who would be elected by the alumni (that number is now 13). Even though the University was taking major steps forward, the trustees considered Patton a “wonder­ fully poor” administrator, and like Smith and Green before him he was asked to step down. At a trustee meeting on June 9, 1902, Patton resigned, and Wil­ son was elected immediately to succeed him as Prince­ ton’s first president who had not been a member of the clergy. That fall, Patton would become the first president of the neighboring Prince­ton Theological Seminary. Once when asked by a visitor to the semi­ nary if he had any connection to the University, he\n\nHistory of the University\n\nsaid, “Yes, indeed, I am president of Prince­ ton University—­once removed.” Like McCosh’s, Wilson’s presidency was like an electric shock to the campus. He established an un­ dergraduate curriculum of general studies with dis­ tribution requirements in the first two years followed by concentrated study during the ju­nior and se­nior years. He created new deanships for the departments of science and the college. He shifted the power to make faculty appointments from the trustees to the president and the faculty. In 1904 he imposed an orga­nizational structure by creating 11 academic departments,1 and in 1905 he increased the size of the faculty by about 50 ­percent when he hired 49 as­ sistant professors called “preceptors” to engage with undergraduates through guided reading and small group discussion. One newspaper credited Wilson’s changes in the curriculum and the faculty with transforming Prince­ ton from a “country club . . . ​into an institution of learning.” Long-­time history professor Joseph Strayer 1925 ­later observed that while “McCosh cleared the ground and laid the foundation for the university,” it was Wilson who “completed the structure” of a dis­ tinctive research university uniquely focused on un­ dergraduate education, in which even its most emi­ nent faculty would teach, and students would become active participants in the learning pro­cess. As president, Wilson lost two major ­battles. His “quad plan” aimed to replace the socially exclusive eating clubs with residential colleges where under­ graduates would live and take their meals with resi­ dent faculty, and he sought to locate the gradu­ate college in the center of campus. He lost the first ­battle to stiff alumni opposition and the second to West, who outmaneuvered him to construct the gradu­ate college in his preferred location overlooking the golf course. While Wilson hired Prince­ton’s first Jewish and Catholic faculty members, he stood firm against any enrollment of Black students. In 1909, when a Black student inquired about attending, Wilson said, “it is altogether inadvisable for a colored man to enter Prince­ton.” When Wilson stepped down in 1910, he was elected governor of New Jersey, and in 1912 he won the first 1 Art and Archaeology; Biology; Chemistry; Classics; En­glish; Geol­ ogy; History, Politics, and Economics; Mathe­matics; Modern Lan­ guages; Philosophy; and Physics. Departments of Civil and Electrical Engineering already existed, and Astronomy became a department a few years ­later.\n\n7\n\nof two terms as president of the United States, join­ ing another Virginian, James Madison, as the only Prince­ton alumni to serve in that office. Following Wilson, three alumni would gain their party’s nomi­ nation to run for president: Adlai Stevenson 1922, the Demo­cratic Party candidate against Dwight Eisen­ hower in 1952 and 1956; Norman Thomas 1905, the Socialist Party candidate in six elections from 1928 through 1948; and Ralph Nader ’55, Green Party can­ didate in 1996 and 2000 and an in­de­pen­dent candi­ date in the next two elections. In 2008, almost 100 years a­ fter Wilson’s first inauguration, another Prince­tonian, Michelle Obama ’85, would move into the White House as first lady.\n\nThe Aftermath of World War I: Academic Stature Grows, Policies of Exclusion Persist Wilson’s successor, John Grier Hibben 1882 *1893 (the first of five consecutive presidents with Prince­ ton gradu­ate degrees), steered Prince­ton through an east coast polio outbreak in 1916; an international in­ fluenza pandemic in 1918; the dislocations of World War I (by September 1918 ­there w ­ ere only 60 under­ graduates who w ­ ere not in the military); and the onset of the G ­ reat Depression. Schools of Architec­ ture (1919), Engineering (1921), and Public and Inter­ national Affairs (1930) ­were established, as was a de­ partment of Oriental Languages and Lit­er­a­tures (1927).2 An array of iconic campus buildings w ­ ere constructed during Hibben’s presidency, including 2 In 1969 the department then called Oriental Studies split into East Asian Studies and Near Eastern Studies, joining a long list of departments that merged, split, or changed names. History, Poli­ tics, and Economics became separate departments; Economics spawned Sociology, which in turn gave rise to Anthropology; Mod­ ern Languages split several times—­its descendants are French and Italian, German, Spanish and Portuguese, Slavic Languages and Lit­ er­a­tures, and Comparative Lit­er­a­ture; Biology became Molecular Biology and Ecol­ogy and Evolutionary Biology (and for a time ­there was a department of Biochemistry); Psy­chol­ogy emerged out of Philosophy; Statistics existed for a time a­fter emerging out of Mathe­matics; ­Music began u ­ nder the auspices of Art and Archaeol­ ogy; and Geosciences changed its name several times. In engi­ neering, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering merged; for a time the department of Civil Engineering became Civil and Geo­ logical Engineering, then Civil Engineering and Operations Re­ search, and then Civil and Environmental Engineering ­after Op­ erations Research and Financial Engineering became a separate department; Electrical Engineering became Electrical Engineering and Computer Science before Computer Science became a sepa­ rate department and ­later became Electrical and Computer Engi­ neering; and Chemical Engineering became Chemical and Biologi­ cal Engineering.\n\n8\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nPalmer Stadium (football), Baker Rink (ice hockey), the second McCosh Infirmary, McCarter Theater, and the University Chapel. In 1923 the University ­adopted an “upperclass plan of study” known as the “four-­course plan” that had been conceived by mathe­matics professor and ­later dean of the faculty Luther Eisenhart. The plan re­ duced the number of courses for ju­niors and se­niors from five to four; replaced the fifth course with in­de­ pen­dent thinking, research, and writing; and re­ quired a comprehensive senior-­year examination in the student’s field of concentration. While the plan did not mention a thesis, several departments soon expected one of all their se­niors and by 1930 a se­nior thesis was required of practically all Prince­ton under­ graduates. The four-­course plan applied to all ju­niors and se­niors, not just ­those who elected an “honors program.” A ­century ­later, this all-­honors program remains a distinctive characteristic of Prince­ton; ­every se­nior is still required to submit a thesis or comparable in­de­pen­dent proj­ect, and many students regard the thesis as the capstone of their undergrad­ uate experience. The University archives contain all ­theses from 1924 to the pre­sent, with all since 2013 in digital format. Eisenhart was one of several young mathemati­ cians (Oswald Veblen was another) who ­were brought to Prince­ton by dean of the faculty Henry Fine 1880. Fine and Eisenhart established Prince­ton as one of the world’s leading centers for mathematical research, and as the first professor at the Institute for Advanced Study when it was founded in 1930, Veblen recruited to its faculty some of the best mathematicians and physicists in the world, including Albert Einstein. With the rise of fascism and anti-­Semitism in Eu­rope, Veblen’s initiative and determination made the insti­ tute into a lifeline in the migration of Eu­ro­pean schol­ ars to Prince­ton, and it remains ­today a magnet for some of the world’s leading scholars, now spanning the fields of historical studies, natu­ral sciences, and social sciences, in addition to mathe­matics. While Prince­ton’s academic stature grew, the size of its gradu­ate school remained capped (initially at 200, then at 250) and the fundamental composition of the undergraduate student body remained largely unchanged. In 1922, as the number of undergradu­ ates grew to more than 1,700, the trustees ­adopted a policy of selective admission and appointed En­glish instructor Radcliffe Heermance *1909 to the newly created role of dean of admission, a position he held ­until 1950.\n\nFor its first ­century and a half, Prince­ton accepted almost all students who applied, including students with deficiencies in preparation who w ­ ere admitted “with conditions.” (In 1904, only about a quarter of the class was admitted unconditionally, and when asked early in his presidency how many students ­there w ­ ere at Prince­ton, Wilson’s answer was “about 10 ­percent.”) In the College’s earliest years, admis­ sion required knowledge of Latin, Greek, and “vulgar arithmetick,” and even into the early twen­ tieth ­century ­these subjects ­were part of entrance exams; in 1918 Prince­ton removed Greek as a Bachelor of Arts requirement, and in 1930 it did the same for Latin. In colonial times some financial aid was available— as an undergraduate, James Leslie 1759 received as­ sistance from a “fund for pious youth,” and when he died in 1792, he gave Prince­ton its first endowed scholarship—­but for most of the eigh­teenth and nine­ teenth centuries financial aid remained very ­limited. By 1921 nearly 300 scholarships ­were available, and one of e­ very five students had a job through a Bureau of Self Help that had been founded in 1911. With applications increasing and academic stan­ dards rising, especially ­after the introduction of stan­ dardized tests, Heermance assured alumni that “aver­ age students” with good rec­ords still had an excellent chance of being admitted. He told them that Prince­ ton’s highest priority was not in admitting superior students, but in admitting the “all-­around boy.” President Hibben had come to Prince­ton from a public high school in Illinois, and he pressed for mod­ ified entrance requirements for applicants from schools in the west that did not prepare their students for the College Boards. That and the growth of alumni associations around the country ­eager to send local students to Prince­ton led to a broadening of the geo­graph­i­cal distribution of Prince­ton classes beyond the ­middle Atlantic and the south. Even so, in the 1930s Prince­ton had a more homogeneous student body than most of its peers and it stood alone in drawing more than 80 ­percent of its students from private schools. While Heermance insisted publicly that Prince­ton “did not discriminate against any race, color, or creed,” the fact was that Prince­ton was inaccessible to some, including African Americans, and inhospi­ table to o ­ thers, including Jewish students. The only Black undergraduate admitted (inadvertently) in the first half of the twentieth ­century, Bruce Wright, was asked to leave when his race was discovered as he ar­\n\nHistory of the University\n\nrived in 1935 to register. (In 2001 the se­nior class made him an honorary member.) In 1924 the University ­limited Jewish enrollment to ­under three p ­ ercent: in 1935 when 85 ­percent of all applicants ­were admitted, all but five of 28 Jewish applicants ­were turned down. In 1940 ­there w ­ ere only seven Jewish freshmen in a class of 508. One maga­ zine editor reported that anti-­Semitism was “more dominant at Prince­ton” than at any of 14 other uni­ versities he visited.\n\nThe Dodds Era: Harbingers of Change In 1933 the trustees chose politics professor Harold Dodds *14 to succeed Hibben. An expert on local gov­ ernment, Dodds had chaired the committee that es­ tablished the school of Public and International Af­ fairs. Dodds would remain in office for 24 years, guiding the University through the G ­ reat Depression, World War II, the postwar period of readjustment, and the Korean War. During World War II, some students accelerated their studies, while ­others left hoping to return and finish ­later. In a gesture much appreciated and long remembered, in 1943 Dodds contacted 1,300 Prince­ tonians serving in the armed forces and offered them, at no cost, three books of their choosing—­wherever they might be. Many members of the faculty contrib­ uted to the war effort, instructing soldiers, sailors, and marines on campus, teaching off-­campus courses for industrial chemists, serving in se­nior government positions, and conducting research in fields ranging from sonar technology to atomic weapons. During Dodds’ tenure, the faculty grew from 327 to 582; the number of gradu­ate students more than doubled from 293 to 636; and the number of under­ graduates increased from 2,309 to 2,948, having bulged to more than 3,400 in 1946 as war veterans re­ turned to campus in droves (cots w ­ ere installed in Baker Rink to accommodate them). The University added a program in the Creative Arts in 1939, founded departments of Aeronautical Engineering (1941), Religion (1945), and M ­ usic (1946), and estab­ lished a Special Program in the Humanities, followed by a Council of the Humanities in 1953. A gradu­ate program was added to the school of Public and Inter­ national Affairs, which in 1948 was officially named for Woodrow Wilson. In 1948 Firestone Library opened as a “laboratory for the humanities and social sciences”; ­today it is one of the largest open-­stack libraries in the world and it\n\n9\n\nhas more books per student than any other univer­ sity library in the United States. In 1951 the Univer­ sity purchased 825 acres (now the Prince­ton Forrestal Campus) and 16 laboratory buildings from the Rocke­ fel­ler Center for Medical Research to provide ur­ gently needed space for engineering and the natu­ral sciences; the precursor to the Prince­ton Plasma Phys­ ics Laboratory was founded t­ here in a former rabbit hutch. Alumni volunteers launched an Annual Giving program in 1940 that encouraged classmates to make unrestricted gifts. The program raised $80,000 in its first year. In 1957, the final year of Dodds’ presidency, it raised $1.3 million from more than 70 ­percent of all undergraduate alumni. Between 1940 and 2020, Annual Giving raised a total of more than $1.5 billion; almost 90 ­percent of undergraduate alumni partici­ pated at least once; and many gradu­ate alumni and parents contributed as well. No other university comes close to Prince­ton’s levels of participation. In recent years Annual Giving dollars have provided nearly 10 ­percent of the University’s overall bud­get for educational expenses, providing it with flexibility to meet unanticipated needs and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. In 1942, 23 ­women became the University’s first fe­ male students when they enrolled in a government-­ sponsored course in photogrammetry (making maps from aerial photo­graphs) taught by a Prince­ton fac­ ulty member. Three ­women on the library staff en­ rolled in a Rus­sian language course in 1947. Spouses of returning veterans sat in on courses informally and two wives of members of the Class of 1943 became the first female reporters for the Daily Prince­tonian. In 1942 the Physics department appointed a ­woman, Chien-­Shiung Wu, to its faculty, and beginning in 1943, ­women ­were hired as instructors and lecturers in language courses. In 1948 Helen Baker, associate director of the Industrial Relations Section, became the first w ­ oman at Prince­ton granted “faculty status with the rank of associate professor.” The war years called attention to widespread dis­ crimination throughout American society, and in 1942 the Daily Prince­tonian editorialized in f­ avor of ad­ mitting African American students in a three-­part series entitled “White Supremacy at Prince­ton.” In 1945 four Black students arrived on campus as part of the Navy’s V-12 program, and one of them, John Howard ’47, would become the first Black student to earn a Prince­ton undergraduate degree. Two of the other students, basketball team captain Arthur\n\n10\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\nJewell Wilson and James Ward, would gradu­ate in the Class of 1948. In 1947 Prince­ton admitted a Black undergradu­ ate from the town of Prince­ton, Joseph Ralph Moss ’51; another early Black undergraduate, Robert J. Rivers Jr. ’53, also from the town of Prince­ton, ­later would become the first African American elected by the board to serve as a Prince­ton trustee. He is rec­ ognized on campus ­today by a roadway named in his honor and a portrait in the University’s increasingly diverse portrait collection. In 1955 the University hired its first Black faculty member, assistant profes­ sor of En­glish Charles Davis. In 1946 the Student Hebrew Association was founded, and in 1947 it held its first official ser­vice on campus with Albert Einstein as one of its speakers. By 1948, 6.5 ­percent of the freshman class was Jewish, the highest percentage in any class to that time.\n\nPost-­World War II: The Emergence of ­Today’s Prince­ton ­ hese modest steps t­oward inclusion w T ­ ere a harbin­ ger of what was to come, although it would still take de­cades before Prince­ton became the coeducational, multinational, and multicultural institution it is ­today. By 1948 Prince­ton had more than 5,000 applicants for 725 spaces, and the University was actively seek­ ing students beyond New York, New Jersey, and Penn­ sylvania. The GI Bill helped veterans pay for college and Prince­ton expanded its own commitment to fi­ nancial aid (basing aid solely on need); by the early 1960s almost 40 ­percent of undergraduates ­were re­ ceiving some form of assistance. By 1955 students from public high schools ­were filling half the enter­ ing class; by 1958 they ­were filling more than half; and a de­cade l­ater only 35 ­percent of the Class of 1973 came from private schools. The University was still admitting 80 ­percent of alumni ­children who applied, but in the 1970s this would drop to about 40 ­percent, and it would ­later ­settle in the range of 30 ­percent. In 1950 more than 600 sophomores in the Class of 1952 declared they would not join eating clubs ­unless ­every sophomore who applied (“bickered”) was admitted to at least one club. The concept of “100 ­percent bicker” was largely sustained except for a major setback in the “dirty bicker” of 1958 when 23 students, more than half of whom w ­ ere Jewish, w ­ ere not chosen for any club. ­After 20 years of short-­lived attempts to create al­ ternatives to the clubs, in 1957 students formed\n\nWoodrow Wilson Lodge, with social and dining space in Madison Hall. In 1961 they relocated to Wilcox Hall and the lodge was renamed the Woodrow Wilson So­ ciety; in 1968 the society was transformed into Prince­ ton’s first residential college. In 2020, ­after Wilson College was temporarily renamed First College, it was announced that a gift from Mellody Hobson ’91 would allow the University, beginning in 2023, to replace First College with a new residential college, Hobson College, the first residential college at Prince­ton named for an African American ­woman. In the late 1960s and early 1970s some of the eat­ ing clubs abandoned bicker in f­avor of sign-in poli­ cies and two former eating clubs ­were converted into the University-­operated Stevenson Hall, which in­ cluded a kosher kitchen; the kitchen remained u ­ ntil the opening of a Center for Jewish Life in 1993. The Prince­ton Inn was converted into the University’s sec­ ond residential college, and in 1977 the first dining co-op opened at 2 Dickinson Street. In the 1950s and 1960s gradu­ate school enroll­ ments and Prince­ton’s research capacity increased dramatically as Cold War tensions fueled increased federal investments in science, engineering, and for­ eign language and area studies and national fellow­ ship programs supported advanced training in other fields. Outside support for sponsored research helped increase the University’s bud­get from just ­under $9 million in 1950 to more than $74 million in 1970. While many other universities concentrated their resources on selected departments, Prince­ton’s ap­ proach was to be selective about the fields it of­ fered, but then aim for distinction in e­ very one of them. ­Today the University has world-­class faculty in ­every department and ­every department is highly ranked. The course that Prince­ton charted also differed from its peers in other re­spects: • As it expanded its scholarly eminence, it sustained its unique commitment to undergraduate educa­ tion, with all faculty members expected to teach and with students expected to play an active role in the learning pro­cess; as one admission dean said, “a first-­rate education is not something that happens to you—­rather it is something you your­ self make happen.” • As the gradu­ate school increasingly attracted many of the best students in the world, it remained rela­ tively small; while it offers highly selective mas­ ter’s programs in several fields, its overwhelming\n\nHistory of the University\n\nemphasis is on doctoral education, with 90 ­percent of Prince­ton’s gradu­ate students pursuing PhDs. • Unlike most research universities, Prince­ton does not have professional schools, with separate fac­ ulties, in law, medicine, business, and education; it has a single faculty focused on the liberal arts and sciences, and engineering. • While some of its peers downplayed engineering or chose not to offer it, Prince­ton pursued schol­ arly and professional distinction in engineering, but within the framework of a liberal arts univer­ sity; its engineering programs actively collaborate with the University’s other academic divisions: the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natu­ral sciences. In 2019, three of the University’s most popu­lar undergraduate majors ­were engineering departments. The most popu­lar major, Computer Science3, is the only department at Prince­ ton that offers both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees.\n\nAnother Transformational President On December 7, 1956, the trustees promoted a young assistant professor of classics, Robert Goheen ’40 *48, to full professor and elected him Prince­ton’s 16th president. Like Witherspoon, McCosh, and Wil­ son, he would transform the University in almost ­every dimension. Goheen led the University’s first comprehensive capital campaign, which surpassed its goal of $53 mil­ lion by raising $60.7 million. The funds supported undergraduate financial aid and gradu­ate fellow­ ships; expansion of the gradu­ate program and a new home for the school of Public and International Af­ fairs; a new state-­of-­the-­art complex for Engineering (the E-­Quad); new buildings for Architecture, ­Music, Mathe­matics, Physics, and Astrophysics; and a new gymnasium (Jadwin). In the early 1960s, Goheen committed the Univer­ sity to recruit and enroll significant numbers of Black students. In 1963 Prince­ton had only 10 Black under­ graduates; by 1971 ­there ­were more than 300. In 1964 he hired Carl Fields as the University’s first Black administrator; when he was promoted in 1968, Fields became the first Black dean in the Ivy League. In 1969 3 In 2018 the most popu­lar majors ­were Computer Science (313), Economics (269), Public and International Affairs (240), Politics (147), History (144), Operations Research and Financial Engineer­ ing (139), Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (110), Ecol­ogy and Evolutionary Biology (109), and ­Music (85).\n\n11\n\nGoheen created a program in African American Stud­ ies that in time would become a center (2006) and then a department (2015). In 1971 the University opened a Third World Center to address the needs and con­ cerns of students of color (the center would l­ ater be named for Fields). In 1961 Prince­ton for the first time admitted a ­woman as a degree candidate when Sabra Follett Meservey *64 *66 became a gradu­ate student in the department of Oriental Studies. In 1962 eight more ­women ­were admitted, including T’sai-­Ying Cheng *63 *64, who in 1963 became the first w ­ oman to earn a Prince­ton degree when she received her master’s in Biochemical Sciences; in 1964 she became the first ­woman to receive a Prince­ton PhD. By 1968 ­there ­were 56 female gradu­ate students and by 1976 t­ here ­were 367. In 1963 the University established a Critical Lan­ guages program ­under which students from other colleges, including ­women, became visiting under­ graduates for a year or two to study such languages as Chinese, Japa­nese, Rus­sian, and Arabic. By 1967 an initially skeptical Goheen was ready to ask the trust­ ees to authorize a comprehensive study of the desir­ ability and feasibility of undergraduate coeducation. The study recommended admitting 1,000–1,200 ­women in addition to the existing enrollment of 3,200 men. In January 1969 the trustees approved co­ education “in princi­ple,” and in April they voted to admit ­women undergraduates beginning that fall. That September the University enrolled 101 female first-­year students in the Class of 1973, in addition to 70 female transfer students. The transfer students in­ cluded nine w ­ omen who had studied the previous year in the Critical Languages program (five of them Asian or Asian American) and thus could qualify as se­niors in the Class of 1970, making them Prince­ton’s first undergraduate alumnae. Four years ­later ­there ­were 1,000 ­women undergraduates on campus. In 1974 the trustees a­ dopted a policy of “equal access” that eliminated the guaranteed number of men; by 1976 the number of w ­ omen had increased to 1,395. In 2019, 49.7 ­percent of undergraduates ­were ­women. The Class of 2023, with 50.9 ­percent w ­ omen, was the first Prince­ton class with more ­women than men. In 1968 Suzanne Keller (Sociology) became the first tenured ­woman faculty member. In 1971 Ellen Chances *70 *72 (Slavic Languages and Lit­er­a­tures) was the first w ­ oman with a Prince­ton gradu­ate degree to be appointed to the faculty. In 1973 Sylvia Molloy (Romance Languages and Lit­er­a­tures) was the first\n\n12\n\nThe New Princeton Companion\n\n­ oman promoted to tenure from the assistant pro­ w fessor ranks. In 1979 S. Georgia Nugent ’73 (Classics) became the first undergraduate alumna on the faculty. The first ­woman dean of students (Adele Simmons) was appointed in 1972; she was joined in 1977 by the first ­women deans of the college (Joan Girgus) and the gradu­ate school (Nina Garsoian). A Women*s Center was established in 1971 and a W ­ omen’s Studies program (now Gender and Sexuality Studies) began in 1982. In 1991, following a protracted ­legal ­battle per­sis­tently waged by Sally Frank ’80, the last of the eating clubs (Tiger Inn) fi­nally became coeducational.\n\nAn Era of Activism, Expansion, and New Approaches to Residential Life The late 1960s and early 1970s ­were a turbulent pe­ riod of activism and unrest, on campus and through­ out the country. On May 2, 1968, more than 1,000 stu­ dents rallied in front of Nassau Hall to demand a greater role in University governance, severance of the University’s ties to a think tank that conducted se­ cret military research, divestment from companies ­doing business in South Africa, and removal of aca­ demic credit from ROTC courses.4 Goheen appointed a student-­faculty committee chaired by politics professor Stanley Kelley Jr. that proposed creation of a broadly representative Coun­ cil of the Prince­ton University Community (CPUC), with committees that would advise the University on its operating bud­get, investment policies, rules of campus conduct, and other topics. The Kelley com­ mittee also proposed electing a graduating se­nior each year to the board of trustees. (In 2019 the trust­ ees designated a position on the board for a recent gradu­ate of the gradu­ate school.) On April 30, 1970, following the announcement of American bombing in Cambodia, more than 2,500 students gathered in the chapel to protest this esca­ lation of the Vietnam War. On May 4 more than 4,000 students, faculty, and staff met in Jadwin Gym and en­ dorsed a resolution calling for a “strike against the war.” Most students elected not to take exams and most se­niors chose not to participate in reunions or wear caps and gowns for Commencement.\n\n4 By 1972 ROTC had become a noncredit program and only the Army unit remained on campus; in 2014 a Prince­ton Navy ROTC unit was re-­established.\n\nThe May 4 meeting also voted to create an organ­ ization called the Movement for a New Congress, headquartered in Prince­ton’s Palmer Hall, to encour­ age students nationwide to participate in that fall’s Congressional campaigns. The next day the faculty endorsed a CPUC resolution creating a two-­week fall break so students could return home prior to election day to canvass and vote. A one-­week fall break re­ mains part of Prince­ton’s academic calendar, provid­ ing a welcome respite from classes and time to pur­ sue research and community ser­vice proj­ects. As the draft became a less pressing concern and the war in Vietnam came to an end, campus activism continued, largely focused on issues related to diver­ sity. Students and o ­ thers called for increased recruit­ ment of students of color, fair treatment of LGBTQIA students, support for students with disabilities, and the creation of programs in Latino Studies and Asian American Studies. Other concerns included issues re­ lated to sexual misconduct and divestment. While the initial calls for divestment targeted apartheid in South Africa, ­later issues focused on genocide in Dar­ fur, fossil fuel companies, and private prisons. In 1972 Goheen was succeeded by his provost, Wil­ liam Bowen *58. As provost Bowen had been deeply involved in the implementation of coeducation, ef­ forts to increase the enrollment of minority students, the defense of open inquiry and ­free speech, and an expanded commitment to financial aid. As president ­these remained priorities, along with enhancing the University’s academic strengths and improving the quality of undergraduate life. Bowen recognized that to remain one of the world’s ­great universities, Prince­ton had to be much better than it was in the life sciences. He set out si­mul­ta­neously to create a new department of Molecular Biology, build it a state-­of-­the-­art laboratory, and attract transforma­ tive faculty leaders. The department achieved the level of international distinction he sought and attracted many faculty members who ­were leaders in the field, including Shirley Tilghman, who would become Prince­ ton’s nineteenth president. In 1978 Bowen appointed a committee to make recommendations regarding undergraduate social and dining facilities. The committee proposed creat­ ing a system of five residential colleges to ­house all freshmen and sophomores and a ­limited number of ju­niors and se­niors. In 1982 the colleges opened to freshmen and a year ­later they w ­ ere fully operational. The one new fa­cil­i­ty that was required was given by one of the University’s most generous donors of the\n\nHistory of the University\n\nmodern era, Gordon Wu ’58, who had been an inter­ national student from Hong Kong as an undergrad­ uate and whose name is affixed to the dining hall in Chinese characters as well as in En­glish letters. When the trustees de­cided in 2000 to increase un­ dergraduate enrollment by 10 ­percent (from 4,600 to 5,100), a sixth college (Whitman) was constructed, and three of the colleges, including Whitman, w ­ ere converted to four-­year colleges, housing ju­niors and se­niors along with freshmen and sophomores. In 2016 the trustees approved a further 10 ­percent increase in the number of undergraduates; this time two new colleges ­were to be constructed, one to accommodate the additional 500 students, and one to provide swing space in the short run and capacity for a further in­ crease in undergraduate enrollment in the ­future. In 1996, during the presidency of Harold Shapiro *64, the University made the first change in its motto since Wilson’s address a c­ entury ­earlier, expanding its commitment beyond “the nation’s ser­vice” to the “ser­vice of all nations.” This reflected the growing international reach of the University—­during Shap­ iro’s presidency the percentage of international students in the undergraduate student body dou­ bled to 10 ­percent and the Mpala Research Centre opened in central K ­ enya. Shapiro himself had first come to Prince­ton as a gradu­ate student from Can­ ada, and when elected he was Prince­ton’s first Jewish president. The revised motto also expressed a renewed and expanded commitment to ser­vice. Since 2001 oppor­ tunities for ser­vice have been enhanced and coordi­ nated through one of the legacies of Prince­ton’s 250th anniversary cele­bration, the Pace Center for Civic Engagement. The Pace Center is one of many programs, cen­ ters, and activities located in the Frist Campus Cen­ ter. When it opened in 2000 it brought to fruition an aspiration that traces back to the 1920s. Shapiro de­ scribed it as “the absolute epicenter of campus life” and a “milestone for Prince­ton’s history.” The Frist Center serves so many purposes and brings together so many members of the campus community that it is difficult now to imagine the campus without it. In 1998 the University reduced loan requirements for middle-­income students on financial aid and elim­ inated them entirely for lower-­income students. In 2001 it went further by adopting a policy of meeting the full need of financial aid recipients with grants—­ with no loan requirement, students could gradu­ate debt-­free. The University also excluded the value of\n\n13\n\nthe home from its calculation of need and extended its need-­blind admission policy to include all interna­ tional students. ­These policies secured Prince­ton’s position as the national leader in assuring access and affordability for all admitted students, regardless of financial need.\n\nPrince­ton in the Twenty-­First C ­ entury On June 15, 2001, Shirley Tilghman took office as Prince­ton’s first ­woman president. Like Shapiro, she was a native of Canada. She had been in office only three months when the terrorist attacks of Septem­ ber 11 occurred, just as first-­year students w ­ ere arriv­ ing on campus. The attacks claimed the lives of 14 Prince­ton alumni (more than any other university except one); in 2003 the University dedicated a gar­ den to their memory just outside the west door of Chancellor Green. Over the course of Tilghman’s presidency the per­ centage of undergraduates on financial aid increased from just ­under 40 ­percent to nearly 60 ­percent and the University began a concerted effort to increase the number of students in each class who receive fed­ eral Pell grants, which are awarded to students from lower economic backgrounds. Prince­ ton ranked ­toward the bottom of its peer group when only about 7 ­percent of the Class of 2008 qualified; 15 years l­ ater Prince­ton ranked at the top when 24 ­percent of the Class of 2023 received the grants. Tilghman launched several initiatives to expand Prince­ton’s global presence. The Prince­ton Institute for International and Regional Studies was formed in 2003, and in 2007 it began offering global summer seminars, which allow students to study with faculty in locations around the world. In 2009 the University introduced a novel Bridge Year program that allows a number of admitted stud"
