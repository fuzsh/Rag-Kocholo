Convective cloud systems in the maritime tropics play a critical role in\nglobal climate, but accurately representing aerosol interactions within\nthese clouds persists as a major challenge for weather and climate\nmodelling. We quantify the effect of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) on the\nradiative properties of a complex tropical Atlantic deep convective cloud\nfield using a regional model with an advanced double-moment microphysics\nscheme. Our results show that the domain-mean daylight outgoing radiation\nvaries by up to 18âWâmâ2 depending on the chosen INP parameterisation.\nThe key distinction between different INP parameterisations is the\ntemperature dependence of ice formation, which alters the vertical\ndistribution of cloud microphysical processes. The controlling effect of the\nINP temperature dependence is substantial even in the presence of\nHallettâMossop secondary ice production, and the effects of secondary ice\nformation depend strongly on the chosen INP parameterisation. Our results\nhave implications for climate model simulations of tropical clouds and\nradiation, which currently do not consider a link between INP particle type\nand ice water content. The results also provide a challenge to the INP\nmeasurement community, as we demonstrate that INP concentration\nmeasurements are required over the full mixed-phase temperature regime,\nwhich covers around 10 orders of magnitude.",

In this paper we show that African desert dust that has travelled across the Atlantic to the Caribbean nucleates ice much less well than we might have expected.\n\nMulti-thermals and high concentrations of secondary ice: a modelling study of convective clouds during the Ice in Clouds Experiment â Dust (ICE-D) campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Yahui Huang, Gary Lloyd, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Paul Field, Rachel Hawker, and Lindsay Bennett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1649–1667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh concentrations of ice particles were observed at temperatures greater than about –8 C. The default scheme of the secondary ice production cannot explain the high concentrations. Relaxing the conditions for secondary ice production or considering dust aerosol alone is insufficient to produce the observed amount of ice particles. It is likely that multi-thermals play an important role in producing very high concentrations of secondary ice particles in some tropical clouds.\n\nModel emulation to understand the joint effects of ice-nucleating particles and secondary ice production on deep convective anvil cirrus\n\nRachel E. Hawker, Annette K. Miltenberger, Jill S. Johnson, Jonathan M. Wilkinson, Adrian A. Hill, Ben J. Shipway, Paul R. Field, Benjamin J. Murray, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17315–17343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find that ice-nucleating particles (INPs), aerosols that can initiate the freezing of cloud droplets, cause substantial changes to the properties of radiatively important convectively generated anvil cirrus. The number concentration of INPs had a large effect on ice crystal number concentration while the INP temperature dependence controlled ice crystal size and cloud fraction. The results indicate information on INP number and source is necessary for the representation of cloud glaciation.\n\nQuantifying the impact of global nitrate aerosol on tropospheric composition fields and its production from lightning NOx\n\nAshok K. Luhar, Anthony C. Jones, and Jonathan M. Wilkinson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1363, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrate aerosol is often omitted in global chemistry-climate models due to the chemical complexity of its formation process. Using a global model, we demonstrate that including nitrate aerosol significantly impacts tropospheric composition fields, such as ozone, and radiation. Additionally, lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen influence both nitrate aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution, which has important implications for radiative fluxes and indirect aerosol effects.\n\nImpact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates\n\nWeiyu Zhang, Kwinten Van Weverberg, Cyril J.

We evaluate for the first time the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations.\n\nGaps in our understanding of ice-nucleating particle sources exposed by global simulation of the UK climate model\n\nRoss J.

However, in many weather and climate models cloud ice is not linked to aerosol that are known to nucleate ice. Here we report the first steps towards representing ice-nucleating particles within the UK's Earth System Model. We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils.\n\nAtmospheric ice-nucleating particles in the eastern Mediterranean and the contribution of mineral and biological aerosol\n\nMark D. Tarn, Bethany V. Wyld, Naama Reicher, Matan Alayof, Daniella Gat, Alberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Alexander D. Harrison, Yinon Rudich, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAerosol Research, 2, 161–182, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-161-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-161-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations were measured in Israel, which experiences air masses from a variety of sources. We found that the INP activity is typically dominated by K-feldspar mineral dust but that air masses passing over regions of fertile soils correlated with high INP concentrations and indicators of biological activity. This suggests that these fertile regions could be sporadic sources of warm-temperature biogenic INPs and warrants further study of these areas.\n\nThe first microwave and submillimetre closure study using particle models of oriented ice hydrometeors to simulate polarimetric measurements of ice clouds\n\nKarina McCusker, Anthony J. Baran, Chris Westbrook, Stuart Fox, Patrick Eriksson, Richard Cotton, Julien DelanoÃ«, and Florian Ewald\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 3533–3552, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3533-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-3533-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPolarised radiative transfer simulations are performed using an atmospheric model based on in situ measurements. These are compared to large polarisation measurements to explore whether such measurements can provide information on cloud ice, e.g. particle shape and orientation. We find that using oriented particle models with shapes based on imagery generally allows for accurate simulations. However, results are sensitive to shape assumptions such as the choice of single crystals or aggregates.\n\nDivergent convective outflow in ICON deep-convection-permitting and parameterised deep convection simulations\n\nEdward Groot, Patrick Kuntze, Annette Miltenberger, and Holger Tost\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 779–803, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-779-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-779-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeep convective clouds (thunderstorms), which may cause severe weather, tend to coherently organise into structured cloud systems. Accurate representation of these systems in models is difficult due to their complex dynamics and, in numerical simulations, the dependence of their dynamics on resolution. Here, the effect of convective organisation and geometry on their outflow winds (altitudes of 7–14 km) is investigated. Representation of their dynamics and outflows improves at higher resolution.\n\nHigh ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks\n\nErin N. Raif, Sarah L. Barr, Mark D. Tarn, James B. McQuaid, Martin I. Daily, Steven J. Abel, Paul A. Barrett, Keith N. Bower, Paul R. Field, Kenneth S. Carslaw, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1502,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1502, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particles (INPs) allow ice to form in clouds at temperatures warmer than -35°C. We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic and it is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic.\n\nThe evolution of warm rain in trade-wind cumulus during EUREC4A\n\nGary Lloyd, Alan Blyth, Zhiqiang Cui, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Martin Gallagher, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Leif Denby, and Peter Gallimore\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClouds that develop in the tropical trade-wind regions are extensive and persistent in nature. They are important for understanding how the magnitude of warming by these cloud systems might change in a warming climate. This paper describes measurements of common cloud types in these regions (shallow cumulus clouds) and the way in which they produce rainfall. During different periods, with different amounts of particulate in the air, the characteristics of the clouds were very different.\n\nWarming effects of reduced sulfur emissions from shipping\n\nMasaru Yoshioka, Daniel P. Grosvenor, Ben B. B. Booth, Colin P. Morice, and Kenneth S. Carslaw\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1428,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1428, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSulfur emissions from shipping has been reduced by about 80 % as a result of the new regulation introduced in 2020. This has reduced aerosol in the atmosphere and its cooling effect through interactions with clouds. As a result, our coupled climate model simulations predict a global warming of 0.04 K averaged over three decades, potentially surpassing the Paris target of 1.5 K or contributing to recent temperature spikes, particularly notable in the Arctic with a mean warming of 0.15 K.\n\nDeep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) coordinated aircraft and ground observations: microphysics, aerosol, and dynamics during cumulonimbus development\n\nDeclan L.

The campaign coordinated a broad range of instrumentation measuring aerosol, cloud physics, radar signals, thermodynamics, dynamics, electric fields, and weather. The project's objectives included the utilisation of these data with satellite observations to study the anvil cloud radiative effect.\n\nIce-nucleating particles active below -24 °C in a Finnish boreal forest and their relationship to bioaerosols\n\nFranziska Vogel, Michael P.

We present 2 months INP measurements in a Finnish boreal forest using a new semi-autonomous INP counting device based on gas expansion. These results show strong variability in INP concentrations, and we present a case that the INP we observe are, at least some of the time, of biological origin.\n\nThe Puy de DÃ´me ICe Nucleation Intercomparison Campaign (PICNIC): comparison between online and offline methods in ambient air\n\nLarissa Lacher, Michael P.

Here we compare three cloud chambers and seven methods for collecting aerosol particles on filters for offline analysis at a mountaintop station. A general good agreement of the methods was found when sampling aerosol particles behind a whole air inlet, supporting their use for obtaining data that can be implemented in models.\n\nJet aircraft lubrication oil droplets as contrail ice-forming particles\n\nJoel Ponsonby, Leon King, Benjamin J. Murray, and Marc E. J. Stettler\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2045–2058, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2045-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2045-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol emissions from aircraft engines contribute to the formation of contrails, which have a climate impact as important as that of aviation’s CO2 emissions. For the first time, we experimentally investigate the freezing behaviour of water droplets formed on jet lubrication oil aerosol. We show that they can activate to form water droplets and discuss their potential impact on contrail formation. Our study has implications for contrails produced by future aircraft engine and fuel technologies.\n\nGlobal modeling of aerosol nucleation with an explicit chemical mechanism for highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs)\n\nXinyue Shao, Minghuai Wang, Xinyi Dong, Yaman Liu, Wenxiang Shen, Stephen Arnold, Leighton Regayre, Meinrat Andreae, Mira PÃ¶hlker, Duseong Jo, Man Yue, and Ken Carslaw\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-401,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-401, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHighly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) play an important role in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). By explicitly coupling the chemical mechanism of HOMs and a comprehensive nucleation scheme in a global climate model. The updated model shows better agreement with measurements of nucleation rate, growth rate, NPF event frequency. Our results reveal that HOMs-driven NPF leads to a considerable increase in particle and cloud condensation nuclei burden globally.\n\nMeasurement report: The ice-nucleating activity of lichen sampled in a northern European boreal forest\n\nUlrike Proske, Michael P. Adams, Grace C. E. Porter, Mark Holden, Jaana BÃ¤ck, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2780,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2780, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce nucleating particles aid freezing of water droplets in clouds and thus modify clouds' properties. During a campaign in the boreal forest in Finland, substantial concentrations of biological ice nucleating particles were observed, despite many of their potential biological sources being snow covered. We sampled lichen in this location and tested its ice nculeation ability in the laboratory. We find that indeed the lichen harbours INPs, which may be important in such snow covered environments.\n\nPaulÂ J.Â Crutzen â a pioneer in Earth system science and a founding member of the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics\n\nRolf MÃ¼ller, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, Thomas Koop, Thomas Peter, and Ken Carslaw\n\nAtmos.

Chem. Phys., 23, 14779–14799, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14779-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14779-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examine the impact of the assumed effective height of SO2 injection, SO2 and BC emission seasonality, and the assumed fraction of SO2 emissions injected as SO4 on climate and chemistry model results. We find that the SO2 injection height has a large impact on surface SO2 concentrations and, in some models, radiative flux. These assumptions are a hidden source of inter-model variability and may be leading to bias in some climate model results.\n\nAircraft ice-nucleating particle and aerosol composition measurements in the western North American Arctic\n\nAlberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Sarah L. Barr, Ian T. Burke, James B. McQuaid, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13819–13834, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sources and concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the Arctic are still poorly understood. Here we report aircraft-based INP concentrations and aerosol composition in the western North American Arctic. The concentrations of INPs and all aerosol particles were low. The aerosol samples contained mostly sea salt and dust particles. Dust particles were more relevant for the INP concentrations than sea salt. However, dust alone cannot account for all of the measured INPs.\n\nSimulations of idealised 3D atmospheric flows on terrestrial planets using LFRic-Atmosphere\n\nDenis E. Sergeev, Nathan J.

Here, we apply LFRic-Atmosphere, a new model developed by the Met Office, to seven different scenarios for terrestrial planetary climates, including four for the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1e, a primary target for future observations. LFRic-Atmosphere reproduces these scenarios within the spread of the existing models across a range of key climatic variables, justifying its use in future exoplanet studies.\n\nLife cycle of a flower cloud system during the EUREC4A field campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Ralph Burton, Sandrine Bony, Steven BÃ¶ing, Alan Gadian, and Leif Denby\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1999,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1999, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCumulus clouds near Barbados can influence how much heat and energy reaches the Earth's surface. A cluster of clouds resembling a flower is presented. Satellite images, dropsonde data, and weather data are used to understand how this cloud system developed. A significant feature was the appearance of a large area of rain at the centre of the cloud system during its later stages. The paper also studied the environmental conditions around the cloud system.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A.

We show that structural deficiencies in a climate model are exposed by comprehensively exploring parametric uncertainty and that these deficiencies limit how much the model uncertainty can be reduced through observational constraint. This provides a future pathway towards building models with greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nInteraction of microphysics and dynamics in a warm conveyor belt simulated with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model\n\nAnnika Oertel, Annette K. Miltenberger, Christian M. Grams, and Corinna Hoose\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We analyze cloud formation processes during WCB ascent in a two-moment microphysics scheme. Quantification of individual diabatic heating rates shows the importance of condensation, vapor deposition, rain evaporation, melting, and cloud-top radiative cooling for total heating and WCB-related potential vorticity structure.\n\nEditorial: Aerosol Research â a new diamond open-access journal covering the breadth of aerosol science and technology\n\nJonas Elm, AladÃ¡r Czitrovszky, Andreas Held, Annele Virtanen, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Benjamin J.

Grosvenor and Kenneth S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6743–6773, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6743-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6743-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determine what causes long-term trends in short-wave (SW) radiative fluxes in two climate models. A positive trend occurs between 1850 and 1970 (increasing SW reflection) and a negative trend between 1970 and 2014; the pre-1970 positive trend is mainly driven by an increase in cloud droplet number concentrations due to increases in aerosol, and the 1970–2014 trend is driven by a decrease in cloud fraction, which we attribute to changes in clouds caused by greenhouse gas-induced warming.\n\nParticle shapes and infrared extinction spectra of nitric acid dihydrate (NAD) crystals: optical constants of the Î²-NAD modification\n\nRobert Wagner, Alexander D. James, Victoria L. Frankland, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Benjamin J. Murray, John M. C. Plane, Harald Saathoff, Ralf Weigel, and Martin Schnaiter\n\nAtmos. Chem.

They can consist of different chemical species, including crystalline nitric acid hydrates. We found that mineral dust or meteoric ablation material can efficiently catalyse the formation of a specific phase of nitric acid dihydrate crystals. We determined predominant particle shapes and infrared optical properties of these crystals, which are important inputs for remote sensing detection of PSCs.\n\nSimulating organic aerosol in Delhi with WRF-Chem using the volatility-basis-set approach: exploring model uncertainty with a Gaussian process emulator\n\nErnesto Reyes-Villegas, Douglas Lowe, Jill S.

The volatility basis set (VBS) approach, implemented in air quality models such as WRF-Chem, can be a useful tool to describe primary OA (POA) production and aging. However, the main disadvantage is its complexity. We used a Gaussian process simulator to reproduce model results and to estimate the sources of model uncertainty. We do this by comparing the outputs with OA observations made at Delhi, India, in 2018.\n\nEvaluating Arctic clouds modelled with the Unified Model and Integrated Forecasting System\n\nGillian Young McCusker, Jutta VÃ¼llers, Peggy Achtert, Paul Field, Jonathan J. Day, Richard Forbes, Ruth Price, Ewan O'Connor, Michael TjernstrÃ¶m, John Prytherch, Ryan Neely III, and Ian M. Brooks\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The overabundance of cloud is interlinked with the modelled thermodynamic structure, with strong negative temperature biases coincident with these overestimated cloud layers.\n\nContribution of regional aerosol nucleation to low-level CCN in an Amazonian deep convective environment: results from a regionally nested global model\n\nXuemei Wang, Hamish Gordon, Daniel P. Grosvenor, Meinrat O. Andreae, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4431–4461, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4431-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4431-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew particle formation in the upper troposphere is important for the global boundary layer aerosol population, and they can be transported downward in Amazonia. We use a global and a regional model to quantify the number of aerosols that are formed at high altitude and transported downward in a 1000 km region. We find that the majority of the aerosols are from outside the region. This suggests that the 1000 km region is unlikely to be a closed loop for aerosol formation, transport and growth.\n\nLate summer transition from a free-tropospheric to boundary layer source of Aitken mode aerosol in the high Arctic\n\nRuth Price, Andrea Baccarini, Julia Schmale, Paul Zieger, Ian M. Brooks, Paul Field, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2927–2961, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic clouds can control how much energy is absorbed by the surface or reflected back to space. Using a computer model of the atmosphere we investigated the formation of atmospheric particles that allow cloud droplets to form. We found that particles formed aloft are transported to the lowest part of the Arctic atmosphere and that this is a key source of particles. Our results have implications for the way Arctic clouds will behave in the future as climate change continues to impact the region.\n\nThe importance of acid-processed meteoric smoke relative to meteoric fragments for crystal nucleation in polar stratospheric clouds\n\nAlexander D. James, Finn Pace, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Graham W. Mann, John M. C. Plane, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2215–2233, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2215-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2215-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we examine whether several materials of meteoric origin can nucleate crystallisation in stratospheric cloud droplets which would affect ozone depletion. We find that material which could fragment on atmospheric entry without melting is unlikely to be present in high enough concentration in the stratosphere to contribute to observed crystalline clouds. Material which ablates completely then forms a new solid known as meteoric smoke can provide enough nucleation to explain observed clouds.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A.

We investigated aerosol modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation) separately and were able to show the differences between measured and modeled trends and especially their seasonal patterns. The differences in model results are likely due to complex effects of several processes instead of certain specific model features.\n\nNewly identified climatically and environmentally significant high-latitude dust sources\n\nOuti Meinander, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Pavel Amosov, Elena Aseyeva, Cliff Atkins, Alexander Baklanov, Clarissa Baldo, Sarah L.

Our results suggest a northern HLD belt at 50–58Â° N in Eurasia and 50–55Â° N in Canada and at >60Â° N in Eurasia and >58Â° N in Canada. Our addition to the previously identified global dust belt (GDB) provides crucially needed information on the extent of active HLD sources with both direct and indirect impacts on climate and environment in remote regions, which are often poorly understood and predicted.\n\nBelow-cloud scavenging of aerosol by rain: a review of numerical modelling approaches and sensitivity simulations with mineral dust in the Met Office's Unified Model\n\nAnthony C. Jones, Adrian Hill, John Hemmings, Pascal Lemaitre, Arnaud QuÃ©rel, Claire L. Ryder, and Stephanie Woodward\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Many different BCS schemes are available to climate models, and it is unclear what the impact of selecting one scheme over another is. Here, various BCS models are outlined and then applied to mineral dust in climate model simulations. We find that dust concentrations are highly sensitive to the BCS scheme, with dust atmospheric lifetimes ranging from 5 to 44 d.\n\nEvaluating uncertainty in aerosol forcing of tropical precipitation shifts\n\nAmy H.

However, the interaction of aerosols with climate remains one of the most uncertain aspects of climate modelling and limits our ability to predict future climate change. We use an ensemble of climate model simulations to investigate what impact the large uncertainty in how aerosols interact with climate has on predicting future tropical rainfall shifts.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of African mineral dust in the Caribbean boundary layer\n\nAlexander D.

In this paper we show that African desert dust that has travelled across the Atlantic to the Caribbean nucleates ice much less well than we might have expected.\n\nAn evaluation of the heat test for the ice-nucleating ability of minerals and biological material\n\nMartin I.

Heat treatments are used to detect the presence of biological INPs in samples collected from the environment as the activity of mineral INPs is assumed unchanged, although not fully assessed. We show that the ice-nucleating ability of some minerals can change after heating and discuss how INP heat tests should be interpreted.\n\nMeasurement report: Introduction to the HyICE-2018 campaign for measurements of ice-nucleating particles and instrument inter-comparison in the HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤ boreal forest\n\nZoÃ© Brasseur, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Erik S.

Chem. Phys., 22, 3391–3407, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3391-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3391-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe complex processes involved mean that no simple answer to this question has so far been discovered: do aerosols increase or decrease precipitation? Using high-resolution weather simulations, we find a self-similar property of rainfall that is not affected by aerosols. Using this invariant, we can collapse all our simulations to a single curve. So, although aerosol effects on rain are many, there may be a universal constraint on the number of degrees of freedom needed to represent them.\n\nSynergistic radar and sub-millimeter radiometer retrievals of ice hydrometeors in mid-latitude frontal cloud systems\n\nSimon Pfreundschuh, Stuart Fox, Patrick Eriksson, David Duncan, Stefan A. Buehler, Manfred Brath, Richard Cotton, and Florian Ewald\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This is important because such measurements are required to improve climate and weather models. The method combines a radar with newly developed sensors measuring microwave radiation at very short wavelengths. We use observations made from aircraft flying above the cloud and compare them to real measurements from inside the cloud. This works well given that one can model the ice particles in the cloud sufficiently well.\n\nMulti-thermals and high concentrations of secondary ice: a modelling study of convective clouds during the Ice in Clouds Experiment â Dust (ICE-D) campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Yahui Huang, Gary Lloyd, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Paul Field, Rachel Hawker, and Lindsay Bennett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1649–1667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh concentrations of ice particles were observed at temperatures greater than about –8 C. The default scheme of the secondary ice production cannot explain the high concentrations. Relaxing the conditions for secondary ice production or considering dust aerosol alone is insufficient to produce the observed amount of ice particles. It is likely that multi-thermals play an important role in producing very high concentrations of secondary ice particles in some tropical clouds.\n\nAutomated detection and classification of synoptic-scale fronts from atmospheric data grids\n\nStefan Niebler, Annette Miltenberger, Bertil Schmidt, and Peter Spichtinger\n\nWeather Clim.

We present an application of our method, showing its use case in a scientific context. Additionally, our results show that multiple sources of training data are necessary to perform well on different regions, implying differences within those regions. Qualitative evaluation shows that the results are physically plausible.\n\nDemistify: a large-eddy simulation (LES) and single-column model (SCM) intercomparison of radiation fog\n\nIan Boutle, Wayne Angevine, Jian-Wen Bao, Thierry Bergot, Ritthik Bhattacharya, Andreas Bott, Leo DucongÃ©, Richard Forbes, Tobias Goecke, Evelyn Grell, Adrian Hill, Adele L.

By comparing many models used for fog forecasting with others used for fog research, we hoped to help guide forecast improvements. We show some key processes that, if improved, will help improve fog forecasting, such as how water is deposited on the ground. We also showed that research models were not themselves a suitable baseline for comparison, and we discuss what future observations are required to improve them.\n\nModel emulation to understand the joint effects of ice-nucleating particles and secondary ice production on deep convective anvil cirrus\n\nRachel E.

Phys., 21, 17315–17343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find that ice-nucleating particles (INPs), aerosols that can initiate the freezing of cloud droplets, cause substantial changes to the properties of radiatively important convectively generated anvil cirrus. The number concentration of INPs had a large effect on ice crystal number concentration while the INP temperature dependence controlled ice crystal size and cloud fraction. The results indicate information on INP number and source is necessary for the representation of cloud glaciation.\n\nExploring the sensitivity of atmospheric nitrate concentrations to nitric acid uptake rate using the Met Office's Unified Model\n\nAnthony C. Jones, Adrian Hill, Samuel Remy, N. Luke Abraham, Mohit Dalvi, Catherine Hardacre, Alan J. Hewitt, Ben Johnson, Jane P. Mulcahy, and Steven T. Turnock\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15901–15927, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15901-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15901-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmmonium nitrate is hard to model because it forms and evaporates rapidly. One approach is to relate its equilibrium concentration to temperature, humidity, and the amount of nitric acid and ammonia gases. Using this approach, we limit the rate at which equilibrium is reached using various condensation rates in a climate model. We show that ammonium nitrate concentrations are highly sensitive to the condensation rate. Our results will help improve the representation of nitrate in climate models.\n\nControls on surface aerosol particle number concentrations and aerosol-limited cloud regimes over the central Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nHeather Guy, Ian M. Brooks, Ken S. Carslaw, Benjamin J. Murray, Von P. Walden, Matthew D. Shupe, Claire Pettersen, David D. Turner, Christopher J. Cox, William D. Neff, Ralf Bennartz, and Ryan R. Neely III\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Aerosol concentrations here have a distinct seasonal cycle from those at lower-altitude Arctic sites, which is driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used to help understand the role aerosols might play in Greenland surface melt through the modification of cloud properties. This is crucial in a rapidly changing region where observations are sparse.\n\nThe driving factors of new particle formation and growth in the polluted boundary layer\n\nMao Xiao, Christopher R.

While oxidation products of aromatics can nucleate, they play a minor role in urban NPF. Our experiments span 4 orders of magnitude variation of observed NPF rates in ambient conditions. We provide a framework based on NPF and growth rates to interpret ambient observations.\n\nHeterogeneous ice nucleation ability of aerosol particles generated from Arctic sea surface microlayer and surface seawater samples at cirrus temperatures\n\nRobert Wagner, Luisa Ickes, Allan K. Bertram, Nora Els, Elena Gorokhova, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Benjamin J. Murray, Nsikanabasi Silas Umo, and Matthew E. Salter\n\nAtmos. Chem.

At low temperatures in the upper troposphere, both inorganic and organic constituents can induce the formation of ice crystals and thereby impact cloud properties and climate. In this study, we performed experiments in a cloud simulation chamber with particles produced from Arctic seawater samples to quantify the relative contribution of inorganic and organic species in ice formation.\n\nEUREC4A\n\nBjorn Stevens, Sandrine Bony, David Farrell, Felix Ament, Alan Blyth, Christopher Fairall, Johannes Karstensen, Patricia K.

EUREC4A comprised roughly 5 weeks of measurements in the downstream winter trades of the North Atlantic – eastward and southeastward of Barbados. It was the first campaign that attempted to characterize the full range of processes and scales influencing trade wind clouds.\n\nIce nucleation by viruses and their potential for cloud glaciation\n\nMichael P. Adams, Nina S. Atanasova, Svetlana Sofieva, Janne Ravantti, Aino Heikkinen, ZoÃ© Brasseur, Jonathan Duplissy, Dennis H. Bamford, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4431–4444, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4431-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4431-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe formation of ice in clouds is critically important for the planet's climate. Hence, we need to know which aerosol types nucleate ice and how effectively they do so. Here we show that virus particles, with a range of architectures, nucleate ice when immersed in supercooled water. However, we also show that they only make a minor contribution to the ice-nucleating particle population in the terrestrial atmosphere, but we cannot rule them out as being important in the marine environment.\n\nEvaluation of natural aerosols in CRESCENDO Earth system models (ESMs): mineral dust\n\nRamiro Checa-Garcia, Yves Balkanski, Samuel Albani, Tommi Bergman, Ken Carslaw, Anne Cozic, Chris Dearden, Beatrice Marticorena, Martine Michou, Twan van Noije, Pierre Nabat, Fiona M. O'Connor, Dirk OliviÃ©, Joseph M. Prospero, Philippe Le Sager, Michael Schulz, and Catherine Scott\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, current global climate models are not yet able to reproduce dust emissions, transport and depositions with the desirable accuracy. Our study analyses five different Earth system models to report aspects to be improved to reproduce better available observations, increase the consistency between models and therefore decrease the current uncertainties.\n\nIntroducing Ice Nucleating Particles functionality into the Unified Model and its impact on the Southern Ocean short-wave radiation biases\n\nVidya Varma, Olaf Morgenstern, Kalli Furtado, Paul Field, and Jonny Williams\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-438,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-438, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a simple parametrisation whereby the immersion freezing temperature in the model is linked to the mineral dust distribution through a diagnostic function, thus invoking regional differences in the nucleation temperatures instead of the global default value of −10 °C. This provides a functionality to mimic the role of Ice Nucleating Particles in the atmosphere on influencing the short-wave radiation over the Southern Ocean region by impacting the cloud phase.\n\nIs a more physical representation of aerosol activation needed for simulations of fog?\n\nCraig Poku, Andrew N. Ross, Adrian A. Hill, Alan M. Blyth, and Ben Shipway\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7271–7292, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7271-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7271-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new aerosol activation scheme suitable for modelling both fog and convective clouds. Most current activation schemes are designed for convective clouds, and we demonstrate that using them to model fog can negatively impact its life cycle. Our scheme has been used to model an observed fog case in the UK, where we demonstrate that a more physically based representation of aerosol activation is required to capture the transition to a deeper layer – more in line with observations.\n\nConstraints on global aerosol number concentration, SO2 and condensation sink in UKESM1 using ATomÂ measurements\n\nAnanth Ranjithkumar, Hamish Gordon, Christina Williamson, Andrew Rollins, Kirsty Pringle, Agnieszka Kupc, Nathan Luke Abraham, Charles Brock, and Ken Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We use observation data from the ATom campaign and evaluate the vertical profile of aerosol number concentration, sulfur dioxide and condensation sink using the UKESM (UK Earth System Model). We identify uncertainties in key atmospheric processes that help improve their theoretical representation in global climate models.\n\nThe seasonal cycle of ice-nucleating particles linked to the abundance of biogenic aerosol in boreal forests\n\nJulia Schneider, Kristina HÃ¶hler, Paavo HeikkilÃ¤, Jorma Keskinen, Barbara Bertozzi, Pia Bogert, Tobias Schorr, Nsikanabasi Silas Umo, Franziska Vogel, ZoÃ© Brasseur, Yusheng Wu, Simo Hakala, Jonathan Duplissy, Dmitri Moisseev, Markku Kulmala, Michael P. Adams, Benjamin J. Murray, Kimmo Korhonen, Liqing Hao, Erik S. Thomson, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Thomas Leisner, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, and Ottmar MÃ¶hler\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Continuous, long-term measurements are needed to characterize the atmospheric INP variability. Here, a first long-term time series of INP spectra measured in the boreal forest for more than 1 year is presented, showing a clear seasonal cycle. It is shown that the seasonal dependency of INP concentrations and prevalent INP types is driven by the abundance of biogenic aerosol.\n\nSensitivity of mixed-phase moderately deep convective clouds to parameterizations of ice formation â an ensemble perspective\n\nAnnette K. Miltenberger and Paul R. Field\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3627–3642, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe formation of ice in clouds is an important processes in mixed-phase and ice-phase clouds. However, the representation of ice formation in numerical models is highly uncertain. In the last decade, several new parameterizations for heterogeneous freezing have been proposed. Here, we investigate the impact of the parameterization choice on the representation of the convective cloud field and compare the impact to that of initial condition uncertainty.\n\nCharacterising optical array particle imaging probes: implications for small-ice-crystal observations\n\nSebastian O'Shea, Jonathan Crosier, James Dorsey, Louis Gallagher, Waldemar Schledewitz, Keith Bower, Oliver Schlenczek, Stephan Borrmann, Richard Cotton, Christopher Westbrook, and Zbigniew Ulanowski\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This work suggests that one of the most widely used methods for in situ measurements of these properties has significant uncertainties and biases. We suggest methods that dramatically improve these measurements, which can be applied to past and future datasets from these instruments.\n\nA global model perturbed parameter ensemble study of secondary organic aerosol formation\n\nKamalika Sengupta, Kirsty Pringle, Jill S. Johnson, Carly Reddington, Jo Browse, Catherine E. Scott, and Ken Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 2693–2723, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2693-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2693-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal models consistently underestimate atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which has significant climatic implications. We use a perturbed parameter model ensemble and ground-based observations to reduce the uncertainty in modelling SOA formation from oxidation of volatile organic compounds. We identify plausible parameter spaces for the yields of extremely low-volatility, low-volatility, and semi-volatile organic compounds based on model–observation match for three key model outputs.\n\nThe Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE): a new online instrument for laboratory studies and automated long-term field observations of ice-nucleating particles\n\nOttmar MÃ¶hler, Michael Adams, Larissa Lacher, Franziska Vogel, Jens Nadolny, Romy Ullrich, Cristian Boffo, Tatjana Pfeuffer, Achim Hobl, Maximilian WeiÃ, Hemanth S. K. Vepuri, Naruki Hiranuma, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas.

INPs induce ice formation in clouds and thus often initiate precipitation formation. The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) is the first fully automated instrument to study cloud ice formation and to obtain long-term records of INPs. This is a timely development, and the capabilities it offers for research and atmospheric monitoring are significant.\n\nThe CLoudâAerosolâRadiation Interaction and Forcing: YearÂ 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) measurement campaign\n\nJim M.

This study provides an overview of a measurement campaign called the cloud–aerosol–radiation interaction and forcing for year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) and documents the rationale, deployment strategy, observations, and key results from the campaign which utilized the heavily equipped FAAM atmospheric research aircraft.\n\nOpinion: Cloud-phase climate feedback and the importance of ice-nucleating particles\n\nBenjamin J. Murray, Kenneth S. Carslaw, and Paul R. Field\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 665–679, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-665-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-665-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe balance between the amounts of ice and supercooled water in clouds over the world's oceans strongly influences how much these clouds can dampen or amplify global warming. Aerosol particles which catalyse ice formation can dramatically reduce the amount of supercooled water in clouds; hence we argue that we need a concerted effort to improve our understanding of these ice-nucleating particles if we are to improve our predictions of climate change.\n\nDescription and evaluation of aerosol in UKESM1 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 CMIP6 historical simulations\n\nJane P.

Here, we comprehensively document and evaluate the aerosol schemes as implemented in the physical and Earth system models, HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1. This study provides a useful characterisation of the aerosol climatology in both models, facilitating the understanding of the numerous aerosolâclimate interaction studies that will be conducted for CMIP6 and beyond.\n\nThe decomposition of cloudâaerosol forcing in the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1)\n\nDaniel P. Grosvenor and Kenneth S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15681–15724, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15681-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15681-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParticles arising from human activity interact with clouds and affect how much of the Sun's energy is reflected away. Lack of understanding about how to represent this in models leads to large uncertainties in climate predictions. We quantify cloud responses to particles in the latest UK Met Office climate model over the North Atlantic Ocean, showing that, in contrast to suggestions elsewhere, increases in cloud coverage and thickness are important over large areas.\n\nEvaluating the simulated radiative forcings, aerosol properties, and stratospheric warmings from the 1963 Mt Agung, 1982 El ChichÃ³n, and 1991 Mt Pinatubo volcanic aerosol clouds\n\nSandip S.

Similar adjustment is also needed to simulate the El ChichÃ³n and Agung volcanic cloud, indicating potential missing removal or vertical redistribution process in models. Important inhomogeneities in the CMIP6 forcing datasets after Agung and El ChichÃ³n eruptions are difficult to reconcile. Quasi-biennial oscillation plays an important role in modifying stratospheric warming.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of Arctic sea surface microlayer samples and marine algal cultures\n\nLuisa Ickes, Grace C.

Sea spray might be a potential source of aerosols acting as ice-nucleating particles. We investigate two common phytoplankton species (Melosira arctica and Skeletonema marinoi) and present their ice nucleation activity in comparison with Arctic seawater microlayer samples from different field campaigns. We also aim to understand the aerosolization process of marine biological samples and the potential effect on the ice nucleation activity.\n\nDevelopment of aerosol activation in the double-moment Unified Model and evaluation with CLARIFY measurements\n\nHamish Gordon, Paul R.

Phys., 20, 10997–11024, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10997-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10997-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Met Office's Unified Model is widely used both for weather forecasting and climate prediction. We present the first version of the model in which both aerosol and cloud particle mass and number concentrations are allowed to evolve separately and independently, which is important for studying how aerosols affect weather and climate. We test the model against aircraft observations near Ascension Island in the Atlantic, focusing on how aerosols can \"activate\" to become cloud droplets.\n\nThe value of remote marine aerosol measurements for constraining radiative forcing uncertainty\n\nLeighton A. Regayre, Julia Schmale, Jill S. Johnson, Christian Tatzelt, Andrea Baccarini, Silvia Henning, Masaru Yoshioka, Frank Stratmann, Martin Gysel-Beer, Daniel P. Grosvenor, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 10063–10072, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10063-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10063-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe amount of energy reflected back into space because of man-made particles is highly uncertain. Processes related to naturally occurring particles cause most of the uncertainty, but these processes are poorly constrained by present-day measurements. We show that measurements over the Southern Ocean, far from pollution sources, efficiently reduce climate model uncertainties. Our results pave the way to designing experiments and measurement campaigns that reduce this uncertainty even further.\n\nRobust observational constraint of uncertain aerosol processes and emissions in a climate model and the effect on aerosol radiative forcing\n\nJill S. Johnson, Leighton A. Regayre, Masaru Yoshioka, Kirsty J. Pringle, Steven T. Turnock, Jo Browse, David M. H. Sexton, John W. Rostron, Nick A. J. Schutgens, Daniel G. Partridge, Dantong Liu, James D. Allan, Hugh Coe, Aijun Ding, David D. Cohen, Armand Atanacio, Ville Vakkari, Eija Asmi, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 9491–9524, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-9491-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-9491-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use over 9000 monthly aggregated grid-box measurements of aerosol to constrain the uncertainty in the HadGEM3-UKCA climate model. Measurements of AOD, PM2.5, particle number concentrations, sulfate and organic mass concentrations are compared to 1 million variants of the model using an implausibility metric. Despite many compensating effects in the model, the procedure constrains the probability distributions of many parameters, and direct radiative forcing uncertainty is reduced by 34 %.\n\nVertical redistribution of moisture and aerosol in orographic mixed-phase clouds\n\nAnnette K. Miltenberger, Paul R. Field, Adrian H. Hill, and Andrew J. Heymsfield\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7979–8001, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7979-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7979-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrographic wave clouds offer a natural laboratory to investigate cloud microphysical processes and their representation in atmospheric models. They impact the larger-scale flow by a vertical redistribution of moisture and aerosol. We use detailed observations from the ICE-L campaign to evaluate the representation of these clouds in a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model and explore the impact of environmental conditions on the vertical redistribution of moisture.\n\nImproving the Southern Ocean cloud albedo biases in a general circulation model\n\nVidya Varma, Olaf Morgenstern, Paul Field, Kalli Furtado, Jonny Williams, and Patrick Hyder\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7741–7751, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7741-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7741-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present generation of global climate models has an insufficiently reflected short-wave radiation, especially over the Southern Ocean. This leads to an excessive heating of the ocean surface in the model, creating sea surface temperature biases and subsequent problems with atmospheric dynamics. Misrepresentation of clouds could be attributed to this radiation bias; we try to address this issue by slowing the growth rate of ice crystals and improving the supercooled liquid clouds in the model.\n\nEnhanced growth rate of atmospheric particles from sulfuric acid\n\nDominik Stolzenburg, Mario Simon, Ananth Ranjithkumar, Andreas KÃ¼rten, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Hamish Gordon, Sebastian Ehrhart, Henning Finkenzeller, Lukas Pichelstorfer, Tuomo Nieminen, Xu-Cheng He, Sophia Brilke, Mao Xiao, AntÃ³nio Amorim, Rima Baalbaki, Andrea Baccarini, Lisa Beck, Steffen BrÃ¤kling, LucÃ­a Caudillo Murillo, Dexian Chen, Biwu Chu, Lubna Dada, AntÃ³nio Dias, Josef Dommen, Jonathan Duplissy, Imad El Haddad, Lukas Fischer, Loic Gonzalez Carracedo, Martin Heinritzi, Changhyuk Kim, Theodore K.

Donahue, Richard C. Flagan, Armin Hansel, Markku Kulmala, Jos Lelieveld, Rainer Volkamer, Jasper Kirkby, and Paul M. Winkler\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 7359–7372, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7359-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7359-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSulfuric acid is a major atmospheric vapour for aerosol formation. If new particles grow fast enough, they can act as cloud droplet seeds or affect air quality. In a controlled laboratory set-up, we demonstrate that van der Waals forces enhance growth from sulfuric acid. We disentangle the effects of ammonia, ions and particle hydration, presenting a complete picture of sulfuric acid growth from molecular clusters onwards. In a climate model, we show its influence on the global aerosol budget.\n\nResolving the size of ice-nucleating particles with a balloon deployable aerosol sampler: the SHARK\n\nGrace C. E. Porter, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Michael P. Adams, Ulrike Proske, Alexander D. Harrison, Mark D. Tarn, Ian M. Brooks, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 2905–2921, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-2905-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-2905-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce-nucleating particles affect cloud development, lifetime, and radiative properties. Hence it is important to know the abundance of INPs throughout the atmosphere. Here we present the development and application of a radio-controlled payload capable of collecting size-resolved aerosol from a tethered balloon for the primary purpose of offline INP analysis. Test data are presented from four locations: southern Finland, northern England, Svalbard, and southern England.\n\nThe effects of cloudâaerosol interaction complexity on simulations of presummer rainfall over southern China\n\nKalli Furtado, Paul Field, Yali Luo, Tianjun Zhou, and Adrian Hill\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 5093–5110, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-5093-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-5093-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining observations with simulations from a weather forecasting model, new insights are obtained into extreme rainfall processes. We use a model which includes the effects of aerosols on clouds in a fully consistent way. This greater complexity improves realism but raises the computational cost. We address the cost–benefit relationship of this and show that cloud–aerosol interactions have important, measurable benefits for simulating climate extremes.\n\nThe first Met Office Unified ModelâJULES Regional Atmosphere and Land configuration, RAL1\n\nMike Bush, Tom Allen, Caroline Bain, Ian Boutle, John Edwards, Anke Finnenkoetter, Charmaine Franklin, Kirsty Hanley, Humphrey Lean, Adrian Lock, James Manners, Marion Mittermaier, Cyril Morcrette, Rachel North, Jon Petch, Chris Short, Simon Vosper, David Walters, Stuart Webster, Mark Weeks, Jonathan Wilkinson, Nigel Wood, and Mohamed Zerroukat\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1999–2029, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1999-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1999-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we define the first Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL) science configuration for kilometre-scale modelling using the Unified Model (UM) as the basis for the atmosphere and the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) for the land. RAL1 defines the science configuration of the dynamics and physics schemes of the atmosphere and land. This configuration will provide a model baseline for any future weather or climate model developments to be described against.\n\nUntangling causality in midlatitude aerosolâcloud adjustments\n\nDaniel T. McCoy, Paul Field, Hamish Gordon, Gregory S. Elsaesser, and Daniel P. Grosvenor\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4085–4103, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4085-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4085-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncomplete understanding of how aerosol affects clouds degrades our ability to predict future climate. In particular, it is unclear how aerosol affects the lifetime of clouds. Does it increase or decrease it? This confusion is partially because causality flows from aerosol to clouds and clouds to aerosol, and it is hard to tell what is happening in observations. Here, we use simulations to tell us about how clouds affect aerosol and use this to interpret observations, showing increased lifetime.\n\nSmall ice particles at slightly supercooled temperatures in tropical maritime convection\n\nGary Lloyd, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Jonathan Crosier, Martin Gallagher, Michael Flynn, James Dorsey, Dantong Liu, Jonathan W. Taylor, Oliver Schlenczek, Jacob Fugal, Stephan Borrmann, Richard Cotton, Paul Field, and Alan Blyth\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3895–3904, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3895-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3895-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of liquid and ice cloud particles were made using an aircraft to penetrate fresh growing convective clouds in the tropical Atlantic. We found small ice particles at surprisingly high temperatures just below freezing. At colder temperatures secondary ice processes rapidly generated high concentrations of ice crystals.\n\nComparing the impact of environmental conditions and microphysics on the forecast uncertainty of deep convective clouds and hail\n\nConstanze Wellmann, Andrew I. Barrett, Jill S. Johnson, Michael Kunz, Bernhard Vogel, Ken S. Carslaw, and Corinna Hoose\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 2201–2219, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2201-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2201-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSevere hailstorms may cause damage to buildings and crops. Thus, the forecast of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models should be as reliable as possible. Using statistical emulation, we identify those model input parameters describing environmental conditions and cloud microphysics which lead to large uncertainties in the prediction of deep convection. We find that the impact of the input parameters on the uncertainty depends on the considered output variable.\n\nDiurnal cycle of the semi-direct effect from a persistent absorbing aerosol layer over marine stratocumulus in large-eddy simulations\n\nRoss J. Herbert, Nicolas Bellouin, Ellie J. Highwood, and Adrian A. Hill\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 1317–1340, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1317-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1317-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine stratocumulus clouds cover large regions of the ocean and act to cool the climate. We use high-resolution simulations to understand how observed layers of elevated smoke impact stratocumulus via the solar heating that occurs within the smoke layer. We find that the cloud response is strongest for thin, dense layers of smoke close to the cloud. The response rapidly weakens as the cloud-to-smoke gap increases. Generally, the smoke acts to thicken clouds and enhance their cooling effect.\n\nEffects of aerosol in simulations of realistic shallow cumulus cloud fields in a large domain\n\nGeorge Spill, Philip Stier, Paul R. Field, and Guy Dagan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13507–13517, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13507-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13507-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShallow convective clouds are among the most common and least understood clouds in the atmosphere. Here we present simulations of realistic, shallow cloud fields in a large domain, in contrast to typical idealised simulations, and find that in these simulations the response to aerosol perturbations is different.\n\nCharacterisation of the filter inlet system on the FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft and its use for size-resolved aerosol composition measurements\n\nAlberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Duncan H. P. Hedges, Matthew Hiscock, Simon T. Parker, Philip D. Rosenberg, Jamie Trembath, Richard Walshaw, Ian T. Burke, James B. McQuaid, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 5741–5763, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-5741-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-5741-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSampling coarse-mode aerosol from a fast-moving research aircraft is challenging and can be subject to substantial losses and enhancements. We characterise these losses and enhancements for an inlet system designed to collect aerosol onto filters. We go on to present an application of this inlet system where we use electron microscopy to study the size and composition of the collected aerosol particles.\n\nIn situ constraints on the vertical distribution of global aerosol\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Nick Schutgens, Carly Reddington, Kirsty J. Pringle, Dantong Liu, James D. Allan, Hugh Coe, Ken S. Carslaw, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 11765–11790, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11765-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11765-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe vertical distribution of aerosol in the atmosphere affects its ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei and changes the amount of sunlight it absorbs or reflects. Common global measurements of aerosol provide no information about this vertical distribution. Using a global collection of in situ aircraft measurements to compare with an aerosolâclimate model (ECHAM-HAM), we explore the key processes controlling this distribution and find that wet removal plays a key role.\n\nThe ice-nucleating ability of quartz immersed in water and its atmospheric importance compared to K-feldspar\n\nAlexander D. Harrison, Katherine Lever, Alberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Mark A. Holden, Thomas F. Whale, Mark D. Tarn, James B. McQuaid, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 11343–11361, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11343-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11343-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dusts are a source of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the atmosphere. Here we present a comprehensive survey of the ice-nucleating ability of naturally occurring quartz. We show the ice-nucleating variability of quartz and its sensitivity to time spent in water and air. We propose four new parameterizations for the minerals quartz, K feldspar, albite and plagioclase to predict INP concentrations in the atmosphere and show that K-feldspar is the dominant INP type in mineral dusts.\n\nAn emulator approach to stratocumulus susceptibility\n\nFranziska Glassmeier, Fabian Hoffmann, Jill S. Johnson, Takanobu Yamaguchi, Ken S. Carslaw, and Graham Feingold\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 10191–10203, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-10191-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-10191-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe climatic relevance of aerosol–cloud interactions depends on the sensitivity of the radiative effect of clouds to certain cloud properties. We derive the dependence of cloud fraction, cloud albedo, and the relative cloud radiative effect on the number of cloud droplets and on liquid water path from a large set of detailed simulations of stratocumulus clouds.\n\nEvaluation of global simulations of aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei number, with implications for cloud droplet formation\n\nGeorge S.

This study evaluates the skill of global models to simulate aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs). Model results show reduced spread in CDNC compared to CCN due to the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol number concentration (air pollution) and updraft velocity (atmospheric dynamics).\n\nRevisiting particle sizing using greyscale optical array probes: evaluation using laboratory experiments and synthetic data\n\nSebastian J. O'Shea, Jonathan Crosier, James Dorsey, Waldemar Schledewitz, Ian Crawford, Stephan Borrmann, Richard Cotton, and Aaron Bansemer\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 3067–3079, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3067-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3067-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOptical array probe measurements of clouds are widely used to inform and validate numerical weather and climate models. In this paper, we discuss artefacts which may bias data from these instruments. Using laboratory and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate how greyscale analysis can be used to filter data, constraining the sample volume and improving data quality particularly at small sizes where their measurements are considered unreliable.\n\nAnthropogenic aerosol forcing â insights from multiple estimates from aerosol-climate models with reduced complexity\n\nStephanie Fiedler, Stefan Kinne, Wan Ting Katty Huang, Petri RÃ¤isÃ¤nen, Declan O'Donnell, Nicolas Bellouin, Philip Stier, Joonas Merikanto, Twan van Noije, Risto Makkonen, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nAtmos.

We describe a recent iteration of these configurations, GA7/GL7, which includes new aerosol and snow schemes and addresses the four critical errors identified in GA6. GA7/GL7 will underpin the UK's contributions to CMIP6, and hence their documentation is important.\n\nThe importance of crystalline phases in ice nucleation by volcanic ash\n\nElena C. Maters, Donald B. Dingwell, Corrado Cimarelli, Dirk MÃ¼ller, Thomas F. Whale, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 5451–5465, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-5451-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-5451-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis experimental study investigates the influence of volcanic ash chemical composition, crystallinity, and mineralogy on its ability to promote freezing of supercooled water. The results indicate that crystals in ash play a key role in this process and suggest that feldspars and perhaps pyroxenes in ash may be highly ice-active. These findings contribute to improving understanding of the potential of ash emissions from different explosive eruptions to impact ice formation in the atmosphere.\n\nA comprehensive characterization of ice nucleation by three different types of cellulose particles immersed in water\n\nNaruki Hiranuma, Kouji Adachi, David M.

Our data showed several types of cellulose are able to nucleate ice as efficiently as some mineral dust samples and cellulose has the potential to be an important atmospheric ice-nucleating particle. Continued investigation/collaboration is necessary to obtain further insight into consistency or diversity of ice nucleation measurements.\n\nMineralogy and mixing state of north African mineral dust by online single-particle mass spectrometry\n\nNicholas A. Marsden, Romy Ullrich, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Stine Eriksen Hammer, Konrad Kandler, Zhiqiang Cui, Paul I. Williams, Michael J. Flynn, Dantong Liu, James D. Allan, and Hugh Coe\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Using online single-particle mass spectrometry, we demonstrate differences in mineralogy and mixing state can be detected in real time in both laboratory studies and ambient measurements. The results provide insights into the temporal and spatial evolution of dust properties that will be useful for aerosolâcloud interaction studies and dust cycle modelling.\n\nCloud feedbacks in extratropical cyclones: insight from long-term satellite data and high-resolution global simulations\n\nDaniel T.

Vidale, David Saint-Martin, Aurore Voldoire, Rein Haarsma, Adrian Hill, Ben Shipway, and Jonathan Wilkinson\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Models predict that the amount of liquid within and the brightness of low-altitude clouds increase in the extratropics with warming. We show that increased fluxes of moisture into extratropical storms in the midlatitudes explain the majority of the observed trend and the modeled increase in liquid water within these storms.\n\nCoarse-mode mineral dust size distributions, composition and optical properties from AER-D aircraft measurements over the tropical eastern Atlantic\n\nClaire L.

Their sizes span orders of magnitude, but the largest (over 10 microns â around the width of a human hair) are difficult to measure and few observations exist. Here we show new aircraft observations of large dust particles, finding more than we would expect, and we quantify their properties which allow them to interact with atmospheric radiation.\n\nIn situ measurements of cloud microphysical and aerosol properties during the break-up of stratocumulus cloud layers in cold air outbreaks over the North Atlantic\n\nGary Lloyd, Thomas W.
