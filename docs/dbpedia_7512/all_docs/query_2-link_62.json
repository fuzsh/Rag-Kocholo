        "text": "This paper deals with testing an innovative Jordan River Basin boardgame implemented in various contexts. A short description of hydropolitics in the Jordan River Basin and an overview of the positions of the riparians is given. Secondly, the impact of regional hydropolitics at community level in two case studies and the development of the Jordan River Basin game will be discussed. The paper will then reflect on the testing the boardgame and the results derived from these experiments. The boardgame, played by 5 players or player groups, is a proto-type used as an analytical tool for research. Concluding, the paper gives a preliminary assessment on the use of serious gaming.\n\nNatural resource management, especially of freshwater resources, is highly politicized in the Jordan River Valley, where unrelenting regional conflict has led to persistent inaction in addressing the growing environmental problems that threaten local livelihoods. This study examines how the narratives surrounding the environmental problems related to the Jordan River diverge at the fault line between two types of discourse: analytical discourse and affective discourse. Drawing from environmental anthropology, political ecology, and discourse analysis, the study locates the point of conflict between affective discourses, which include historical and cultural narratives, and analytical discourses, incorporating economic, scientific, and political narratives. The fault line between these discourses is manifest in the debate on environmental issues through (i) top-down approaches to environmental security such as inter-governmental and domestic policymaking; and (ii) bottom-up approaches, such as grassroots activism and civil society engagement. The findings lead to the conclusion that both top-down and bottom-up approaches interweave emotionally driven affective arguments with logic-driven analytical discourse. However, the authors of the discourse on environmental issues do so in selective ways that exhibit Foucault’s concepts of biopower and governmentality. The study provides recommendations that would create pathways to the equitable solutions urgently needed to break the cycle of hostility that prevent substantive progress towards addressing the troubled waters of the Middle East.\n\nNatural resource management, especially of freshwater resources, is highly politicized in the Jordan River Valley, where unrelenting regional conflict has led to persistent inaction in addressing the growing environmental problems that threaten local livelihoods.

We argue that ESCWA's representation of the Jordan Basin is marked by serious technical errors and a systematic bias in favour of one riparian, Israel, and against the Jordan River's four Arab riparians. We demonstrate this in relation to ESCWA's account of the political geography of the Jordan River Basin, which foregrounds Israel and its perspectives and narratives; in relation to hydrology, where Israel's contribution to the basin is overstated, whilst that of Arab riparians is understated; and in relation to development and abstraction, where Israel's transformation and use of the basin are underplayed, while Arab impacts are exaggerated. Taken together, this bundle of misrepresentations conveys the impression that it is Israel which is the main contributor to the Jordan River Basin, Arab riparians its chief exploiters. This impression is, we argue, not just false but also surprising, given that the Inventory is in the name of an organisation of Arab states. The evidence discussed here provides a striking illustration of how hegemonic hydro-political narratives are reproduced, including by actors other than basin hegemons themselves."
