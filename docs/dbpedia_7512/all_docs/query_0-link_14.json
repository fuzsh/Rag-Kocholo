One of the more modest goals was to set up an institution that would create a \"Courant-Hilbert\" for a new age.1 Indeed, our intention here—even though this book is small in scale and only the opening chapter of our Utopian \"Treatise of Analysis\"—is to write just such a \"Courant-Hilbert\" for the new generation. Each re­ searcher in this field may have his own definition of \"algebraic analysis,\" a term included in the title of this book. On the other hand, algebraic analysts may well share a common attitude toward the study of analysis: the essential use of algebraic methods such as cohomology theory. This characterization is, of course, too vague: one can observe such common trends whenever analysis has made serious reformations. Professor K. Oka, for example, once spoke of the \"victory of abstract algebra\" in regard to his theory of ideals of undetermined domains.2 Furthermore, even Leibniz's main interest, in the early days of analysis, seems to have been in the algebraization of infinitesimal calculus. As used in the title of our book, however, \"algebraic analysis\" has a more special meaning, after Professor M. Sato: it is that analysis which holds onto substance and survives the shifts of fashion in the field of analysis, as Euler's mathe­ matics, for example, has done. In this book, as the most fruitful result of our philosophy, we pay particular attention to the microlocal theory of linear partial differential equations, i.e. the new thinking on the local analysis on contangent bundles. We hope that the fundamental ideas that appear in this book will in the near future become the conventional wisdom\n\n1\n\nR. Courant and D.

Cartan and Serre and is now called the theory of coherent sheaves (see Hitotumatu [1]).\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE\n\namong analysts and theoretical physicists, just as the Courant-HiIbert treatise did. Despite our initial determination and sense of purpose, the task of writ­ ing was a heavy burden for us. It has been a time-consuming project, while our first priority has been to be at the front of the daily rapid progress in this field. Thus, we cannot deny the existence of minor areas that do not yet meet with our full satisfaction. Still, a proverb says, \"Striv­ ing for the best is an enemy of the good.\" We are content, then, to publish our book in this form, hoping that the intelligent reader will benefit despite several defects, and expecting that this will become the first part of our \"Treatise of Analysis.\" We would also like to emphasize that our com­ parison of this book with \"Courant-Hilbert\" is only a goal, and that we do not pretend to equate the maturity of this book with that of Courant and Hilbert's. Theirs is the crystallization of the great scholar Courant's extended effort. Therefore, we would appreciate hearing the critical reader's opinions on the content of this book, for the purpose of improvement. Let us turn to the content of each chapter. In Chapter I, §1, a review of cohomology theory is given, with which we define the sheaf of hyperfunctions. Since students of analysis nowadays seem to be given little opportunity to learn cohomology theory, despite its importance, we have prepared a rather comprehensive treatment of sheaf cohomology theory as an introduction to notions and notations used in later chapters. One may skip this material if it is familiar. The main purpose of Chapter I, §2, is to present the mathematical formulation, via the Cech cohomology group, of the idea that \"hyperfunctions are boundary values of holomorphic functions.\" The reader can then obtain the explicit description of a hyperfunction by combining this with the results in §3 of Chapter II. In Chapter II, §1, the sheaf of microfunctions is constructed on a cotangent bundle, by which the stage for our main theme, microlocal analysis, is established. After some preparation of the theory of holomorphic functions of several complex variables, in §2, the properties of micro­ functions will be studied in detail in §3. Furthermore, in §4, specific examples will be treated. In §1 and §2 of Chapter III, where we basically followed Sato, Kawai, and Kashiwara [1] (hereafter SKK [1]), fundamental operations on micro­ functions are discussed. However, the approach taken in SKK [1] may not be suited to the novice; hence the method of description has been changed. There it was necessary to prove a certain lemma (Proposition 3.1.1) directly, which is technical and intricate and could be tiresome for the reader. Because of the introductory nature of this book, therefore, we decided to treat this lemma as an \"axiom,\" so to speak, and to proceed\n\nPREFACE\n\nIX\n\nto what follows from it. In §4 through §6, elliptic and hyperbolic differ­ ential equations are treated explicitly to show how effectively microfunction theory applies to the theory of linear partial differential equations. These three sections also serve as preparation for the theory of microdifferential equations considered in Chapter IV. Prior to these three sections, we discuss (in §3) the analyticity of Feynman integrals. This sec­ tion has a somewhat different flavor than other sections; it is intended as an invitation to a new trend in mathematical physics: namely, the study of theoretical physics through methods of algebraic analysis. We also thought that it might be a good exercise to go through the operations on microfunctions. In §7, we prove the flabbiness of the microfunction sheaf; and, in §8, a hyperfunction containing holomorphic parameters is discussed. The last two sections are intended to take into account some important properties of microfunctions not covered by the previous sections. In Chapter IV, we discuss the theory of microdifferential equations, the most effective application of microfunction theory. In §1, we define a microdifferential operator, and the fundamental properties are given. \"Qauntized contact transformations\" of microdifferential operators are treated in §2. A quantized contact transformation is an extremely im­ portant notion, one that revolutionized the theory of linear differential equations. The reader may be astonished to see how easily one can ob­ tain profound results with the structures of solutions of linear (micro)differential equations by combining microfunction theory with the theory of quantized contact transformations. This point should be considered as the quintessence of microlocal analysis. As in Chapter III, we proceed in Chapter IV in a manner accesible to the reader rather than in the most logical order, which may be less accessible. For example, in §1 we chose the plane-wave decomposition of the ^-function as a starting point for the introduction of microdifferential operators, and in §2 we restricted our discussion to those contact transformations which have generating functions. We decided not to present our more \"algebro-analytic\" treat­ ments of the above topics until we write a treatise on microdifferential equations centered around the theory of holonomic systems. Likewise, so that the essence of the theory might be plain to the reader, we did not aim at full generality in §3. As we close this preface, we would like to express our most sincere gratitude to our teacher Professor Mikio Sato, who indeed provided al­ most all the essential ideas this book contains. We hope that this book will succeed in imparting the emanation of Professor Sato's throbbing mathematics. It is quite fortunate that authors Kashiwara and Kawai, just at the point when they were choosing their specialities, were able to\n\nX\n\nPREFACE\n\nattend Professor Hikosaburo Komatsu's introductory lectures in hyperfunction theory.3 This book might be thought of as a report to Professor Komatsu ten years later. Furthermore, activity centered around Professor Sato and the authors' works has received warm encouragement and support from Professors Kosaku Yosida and Yasuo Akizuki. Two grad­ uate students at Kyoto University, Mr. Kimio Ueno and Mr. Akiyoshi Yonemura, have read our manuscript and have given beneficial advice. Mr. Yonemura and a graduate student at Sophia University, Mr. Masatoshi Noumi, helped us read the proofs; we would like to take this opportunity to offer our sincere thanks. During the preparation of this book, one or another of us was affiliated with the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University; the Department of Mathe­ matics, Nagoya University; the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California-Berkeley; the Mathematics Department, Harvard University; the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton; the Department of Mathematics, Universite Paris-Nord; and the Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We thank these institutions and their members for their hospitality during our stay. Last, but not least, we would like to express our profound gratitude to Professor Seizo Ito, who not only gave us the opportunity to write this book, but also kept us from proceeding too slowly. We would again like to apologize to Professor Ito for our delay. Without his warm encouragement, in fact, it is doubtful that this book could ever have been published.

Let M be an ndimensional real analytic manifold, and let X be a complexification. If an open subset U of M is oriented, then holds over U since Let Q be an open set of X containing U as a closed set. Then one has as we showed in § 1. Furthermore, by Theorem 1.2.3, the open set Q of X can be taken to be a Stein manifold.

This is fundamental when one expresses hyperfunctions explicitly. Hyperfunctions defined over an open set in R\" can be treated similarly.

This implies that the hyperfunction sheaf is locally isomorphic to provided that M is oriented. Some preliminary notions are necessary.\n\nDefinition 1.2.3.
