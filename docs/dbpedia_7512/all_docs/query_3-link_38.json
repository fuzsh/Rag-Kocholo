        "text": "I began in the instrumental education program on flute. I struggled under my TA for 2 1/2 years, worked hard but was devastated when she wouldn't pass me after almost 3 years into the program and 3/4 finished with my music education courses. I recovered and when my first instrument choice did not work out, I went to my class voice teacher Helen Swank — one of the finest educators ever. She told me my gift was my voice. She helped me prepare tirelessly, I auditioned and was accepted into the voice area where I studies under a full professor and flourished. I studied 12 or 13 straight quarters and it took me an extra year to graduate, but in the end, I earned my teaching certificate: K-12, vocal, instrumental and general music.\n\nI enjoyed summers studying with the best guest artists as well as Professor Hickfang, who wanted me to switch to performance, but I just wanted to graduate and teach others to love music. Music heals my soul still... and I thank Ms. Cooper, Mr. Hickfang and all those who believed in my talent. It was the worst of times, it was the best of times, you might say. I am proud to be a graduate of The Ohio State University School of Music.\n\nI spent many hours up in those practice rooms, working every moment I could on both my flute lessons and finally with my vocal accompanist John Kim Bell (for 3 years) rehearsing and preparing to be the best vocalist that I could be. Lots of hours sitting on the floor in those rooms on the fourth floor, practicing and listening to my friends practice... learning all that I could. When I think of Hughes I think of the 4th floor first, and always with joy and pride in perseverance.\n\nKaren Stumpf Lewis\n\nBME 1975\n\nVoice — Irma Cooper\n\nScarlet and Gray Bands, University Choir/Symphonic Choir — Paul Hickfang, director\n\nI was a TA in 1970 teaching a music theory class in one of the upper classrooms facing the Oval. Massive anti-Vietnam riots were breaking out around the country and soon spread to Ohio State where thousands were protesting shortly before the Kent State massacre. Over 500 State Police with tear gas and brigade from the National Guard with fixed bayonets appeared on campus trying to quell the angry crowd while the university continued classes as though nothing was happening. Above the fray on the second floor I diligently sought to engage my students with the wonders of the augmented 6th chord, ignoring the madness outside as it became more disruptive and violent. When I'd turn to the blackboard they'd jump up to watch the clashes and mayhem developing below. Of course I knew what was happening but I was young, keen and for some reason wanted to play a \"macho man\" teacher determined to share the joys of a slick harmonic progression no matter what. As I began to draw the leading tone resolving upwards and the seventh descend, a tear gas canister flew through the open window and started whirling around on the floor. I played calm, cool and collected, clearly out to impress my young audience. I quickly kicked the flaming canister out the door into the hallway and made them sit there, gagging, as l completed the chord's resolution. They were choking with tears streaming down their faces when I quietly uttered, \"class dismissed\" and we all hurled ourselves out of the building as fast as we could, gasping for air. Many years later I ran into one of my students who told me all she remembered about music theory that year was the tear gas resolution of an augmented 6th chord. We had a good laugh, then she went on to say how cool they thought it was until they got outside and realized just how really stupid I'd been. I couldn't agree more. We laughed again and all I could say was \"I was young.\"\n\nIn 1969–72 Hughes Hall became symbolic for me as a young DMA composition student by what the building came to symbolize. It was iconic for me, but perhaps for a different reason than for many of my colleagues in other fields. In the 1960s the School of Music was a very conservative institution with virtually no contemporary music taught or performed when I first arrived. I had come to OSU on a scholarship to dodge the draft and study contemporary music. To its credit The School of Music covered its contemporary music void with an impressive array of outside guest composers and speakers. Guests like Herbert Brün, Zygmunt Krauze and David Behrman inspired us young composers to form a new music group we provocatively called \"The Junta for New Music.\" Our first activity was a concert of recent American avant-garde music. We booked Hughes Auditorium for rehearsals, but when one of the administrative staff heard what he considered ear-splitting cacophony, we were banned from the building and told to rehearse elsewhere. Hughes quickly became the icon for what we young radicals considered stodgy old-fashioned music-making. The music emanating from Hughes was worthy, well done, important, but from another era and Hughes represented that era. For us it came to represent only the noble past and ironically even its address, 1899 North College Road, confirmed it. It didn't look like us, bearded and barefoot, nor did it want us, so we moved our activities to the Dance Department and out into The Oval on sunny days, attracting large crowds. We were young and rebellious with fire in our bellies. Being banned from Hughes was actually a gift and made us more creative, energetic and resourceful. It was something solid to bump up against, challenge and outwit. Now over half a century later it is with great fondness that I look back on those heady times, realizing now how important something like being banned from Hughes was in shaping me as a freelance composer based in London and touring the world.\n\nI take great delight in what went on there and how important it all was in shaping me in a positive way for my lifetime as a freelance composer and wouldn't change anything if I had to do it over.\n\nStephen Montague\n\nDMA 1972\n\nMusic Composition\n\nA new music ensemble called \"The Junta for New Music\"\n\nMiss Eileen Bonney inspired me to become an elementary general music teacher. Until then, I had not considered it. Her Elementary Methods class and her teaching method inspired me. I must add another story. My grad voice recital was May 1, 1970. It had to be moved to an off-campus church due to the riots. I got credit for it, but did not get a reel-to-reel copy of the recital since it was not held in Hughes Hall. Of course Kent State was just three days after my recital.\n\nI enjoyed having Donald Simmons as the Women's Glee Club director (his son J. K. Simmons is the Oscar-winning actor, who is nominated again this year). I was tapped as a piano accompanist for one of the group's songs for an LP record featuring the School of Music students.\n\nI was warned by some that Ohio State was \"too big\" — but the School of Music was like a high school where the music majors took many courses together (as long as they didn't flunk out!). I recall how the practice rooms on the top floor were small and close together, and not soundproof! One of my favorite music courses was Sight Singing and Dictation — I got straight A's; my least favorite was Music History, held at 8 a.m. Monday–Friday for three straight quarters. I like history, but that instructor at that hour was not inspiring to say the least. I did not audition for entry as others, due to a misunderstanding. I entered Ohio State the summer of 1967 right after I graduated from high school. Since I had no voice audition, the school arranged for me to take lessons from none other than the late Paul Hickfang (opera man and a giant way over 6' tall!). He also had red hair. He gave me the thumbs-up to go ahead and major in voice. I remember being scared of him, although he was very nice. I also recall Maurice Casey. I sang in University Choir two quarters with him. The first concert was The Messiah — Casey's conducting methods were unique to say the least. These are memories that I still recall.\n\nSusan Lee (Curry) Winchell\n\nBME 1970\n\nVoice — Irma Cooper (final instructor)\n\nWomen's Glee Club\n\nI was fortunate enough to get a work study position in the instrument room with the incomparable Ray Spillman. His care with the instruments — and especially the students who needed them — helped me quickly find a family in the School of Music. I got to meet so many fellow music students. We had fun study sessions for theory or music history there. We practiced our instruments or just sat and chatted about home or future plans. We discussed the problems of the world and learned we were all better off having each other to share the moments with and Ray was always there with a quick quirky answer or comeback that always made us laugh and brighten our day. I have so many cherished memories from the Instrument Room in Hughes Hall!\n\nHughes Hall 4th floor held many, many hours of practice time for me as a music major! My favorite memories of my time there, are when the cute, young, curly-haired boy — a fellow horn player from our studio — and I would practice together and try to compete for who could play the best! We have now been married for 25 years! We saw 20 years of teaching and now own and operate a set of music stores in northeast Ohio. We still enjoy that healthy competition from time to time, and are grateful for all our days and the lessons we learned in the School of Music at THE Ohio State University.\n\nJulie Anne Curtis Connair\n\nBME 1998\n\nHorn — Charles Waddell\n\nVoice — Loretta Robinson\n\nConcert Band, Symphonic Band\n\nWomen’s Glee, Symphonic Choir\n\nI have so many memories of Hughes Hall, as I spent the majority of my time in this building. From the trek to the 4th floor practice rooms, chatting with Ray Spillman in the instrument repair area to fix my clarinet, countless recitals and classes in Hughes Auditorium, Sigma Alpha Iota meetings, having the same locker for 5 years, and sitting on the floor in the second floor with my voice friends (yes, you, Brian Armbrust) outside of our studios for HOURS — there are just too many to name.\n\nThe smell. Hughes Hall had a certain smell, especially in the basement. I remember sitting out in front on the steps where the benches were on warm sunny days. I always liked the little back center stairs that went from the first floor to the basement by the side stage door entrance. Like it was a little secret area that you only knew if you knew the building. The hum of the elevator, and how slow it was. How creepy the 4th floor practice rooms were at night and how dark it was up there. I always remember all of the receptions we had in the big rounded room on the first floor that looked out into the Oval, this was also where we had large classes, SAI meetings, and Master Singers Rehearsals. There was also a nice big classroom right next to this room that I love practicing in because the acoustics in there were great for singing.\n\nShelly Rose Beaty (McMonigal)\n\nBM 2001\n\nVoice Performance — Loretta Robinson\n\nSymphonic Choir, Women's Glee Club, University Chorus, Master Singers\n\nI think one of my favorite memories of Hughes Hall was when Paul Robinson convinced Victor Wooten to do an in-person master class. This would have been '05 or '06. Victor was in town on tour and had his record release at the Newport. I convinced my Spanish teacher to let me postpone a test to attend, and one of my closest music school friends Adam Maynard had the chance to play his bass! Since this was before the time of smartphones I only have a grainy flip phone photo of it, but I know that was a special moment for all of us.\n\nMy first day walking into Hughes as a student, September 2003. I went to the basement to check out a bass. Another student saw this and said hello, introduced himself, and invited me to a concert that night. We've been friends ever since. The same day, I was sitting on the steps outside Hughes enjoying the weather and thought I saw a familiar face. Sure enough, it was an old friend and bandmate from high school. We hadn't seen each other in years. We stayed close all through undergrad and keep in touch to this day. Oh, and all of the music theory classes! I became friends with Dr. Mark Lomax in Hughes Hall, Dane Terry, Josh Hill, Chad Greenwald, and so many other great people and musicians. I have a lot of great memories in Hughes Hall, and I learned so many great lessons. The greatest of all was from Paul Robinson (of course it was!). On the door to his office, and later on the door to my office (also at OSU!), was a small piece of paper with the simple message - \"We don't have to do this. We get to do this.\" That point of view has stuck with me for almost 20 years now. But for Ohio State...\n\nAnthony D. McCoy\n\nBA 2009 / BS 2009\n\nBass — Paul Robinson, Roger Hines, Andy Woodson\n\nJazz Combo, University Band\n\nHughes Hall was the first building constructed after World War II. Eugene Weigel advocated and lobbied with the Ohio legislator for the building as School of Music Chair. Discover the history of Hughes Hall and the School of Music at music.osu.edu.\n\nMy memories go back to 1970 when I was a master’s student in flute performance. I typically spent almost all day in Hughes Hall as I took classes, practiced, taught lessons on the fourth floor as a graduate teaching assistant, participated in Concert Band rehearsals on the stage of Hughes Auditorium as well as Symphony Orchestra rehearsals in Hughes 109, among other activities. How did we fit 90 musicians on the stage? Once in your seat, you didn’t get up! Faculty studios varied in size. Some were wonderfully big and others so small that you could almost touch the walls, through which you could clearly hear your neighbor’s music-making . The flute studio was next to the bassoon studio in a suite, so you could clearly hear between the two very small studios. The fact that we were squeezed in together did create a wonderful sense of camaraderie, with many fun pranks. Some of you might remember the rubber chicken?\n\nSpecial memories from the early days include faculty recitals, master classes and the Elevator Party in Hughes Auditorium — a fun event attended by most of the School and invited guests, including the elevator company president, who presented the key to the new elevator to our director, Dr. David Meeker. The event was full of fun and clever pieces like Ode to the Elevator, a poem accompanied by autoharp (Dr. Joan Lehr), an elevator cheer, etc. We issued formal invitations to various dignitaries across campus, including those from Facilities. That summer the ceiling fell in (fortunately, no one was hurt). Work was completed quickly, perhaps because of the fun they had at our event!\n\nWe hosted the great French flutist, Jean-Pierre Rampal, for master classes in the '70s and then again in the '90s. I was privileged to play Piece by Jacques Ibert for him. Many guest artists, faculty and students performed on the stage through the years. I presented my master’s recitals in Hughes Auditorium. During one recital, as I was playing the unaccompanied Sequenza by Berio, the elevator came crashing down, adding a percussion effect to my performance. Remember the tiny recording booth, run by students, where in those days reel-to-reel tapes documented our performances? These are but a few events of thousands through the years.\n\nMore current memories (as a faculty member since 1985) include enjoying my large studio, Hughes 208, which has been the home to many legendary voice faculty in previous years. Attending numerous recitals and concerts in Hughes Auditorium provides many special memories. The Flute Studio has enjoyed Monday night studio classes in Hughes Auditorium since 1987. We also rehearse the Ohio State Flute Troupe, a flute choir consisting of all flute majors. These classes provide students with the opportunity to perform for each other in the place where they will present their degree recitals. During the COVID pandemic we were able to continue, with masks and proper spacing. One particular class stands out — after hearing solo performances, we all circled the outskirts of the auditorium to remain distanced and performed the tune, White Coral Bells, in unison and then as a round, with twenty flute players. Making music together in person was a gift I will never forget. So beautiful. We were all transported to the magic of what it means to make music together, to feel the vibrations live. To blend, phrase, play with dynamics and sing the music as one!\n\nIn spite of its look, its lack of a green room and appropriate backstage area, Hughes Auditorium has continually been a wonderfully resonant performance space enjoyed by soloists and ensemble players.\n\nWalking into Hughes Hall every day, I have been reminded of the thousands of musicians, faculty, students, guests and audiences, who have seized the opportunity to make and witness music. Music is art for all, an essential art that heals as it entertains.\n\nKatherine Borst Jones\n\nProfessor of Flute and Area Head of Orchestral Instruments"
