        "meta_description": "Abstract. The contribution of meteorology and emissions to\nlong-term PM2.5 trends is critical for air quality management but has\nnot yet been fully analyzed. Here, we used the combination of a machine learning\nmodel, statistical method, and chemical transport model to quantify the\nmeteorological impacts on PM2.5 pollution during 2000â2018.\nSpecifically, we first developed a two-stage machine learning PM2.5\nprediction model with a synthetic minority oversampling technique to improve\nthe satellite-based PM2.5 estimates over highly polluted days, thus\nallowing us to better characterize the meteorological effects on haze\nevents. Then we used two methods to examine the meteorological contribution to\nPM2.5: a generalized additive model (GAM) driven\nby the satellite-based full-coverage daily PM2.5 retrievals and\nthe Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality\n(WRF/CMAQ) modeling system. We found good agreements between GAM estimations and\nthe CMAQ model estimations of the meteorological contribution to PM2.5 on\na monthly scale (correlation coefficient between 0.53â0.72). Both methods\nrevealed the dominant role of emission changes in the long-term trend of\nPM2.5 concentration in China during 2000â2018, with notable influence\nfrom the meteorological condition. The interannual variabilities in\nmeteorology-associated PM2.5 were dominated by the fall and winter\nmeteorological conditions, when regional stagnant and stable conditions were\nmore likely to happen and when haze events frequently occurred. From 2000 to\n2018, the meteorological contribution became more unfavorable to PM2.5\npollution across the North China Plain and central China but were more\nbeneficial to pollution control across the southern part, e.g., the Yangtze\nRiver Delta. The meteorology-adjusted PM2.5 over eastern China (denoted East China in figures) peaked in\n2006 and 2011, mainly driven by the emission peaks in primary PM2.5 and gas precursors in these years. Although emissions dominated the\nlong-term PM2.5 trends, the meteorology-driven anomalies also\ncontributed â3.9â% to 2.8â% of the annual mean PM2.5\nconcentrations in eastern China estimated from the GAM. The\nmeteorological contributions were even higher regionally, e.g., â6.3â%\nto 4.9â% of the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in the\nBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, â5.1â% to 4.3â% in the Fenwei Plain,\nâ4.8â% to 4.3â% in the Yangtze River Delta, and â25.6â% to 12.3\n% in the Pearl River Delta. Considering the remarkable meteorological\neffects on PM2.5 and the possible worsening trend of meteorological\nconditions in the northern part of China where air pollution is severe and\npopulation is clustered, stricter clean air actions are needed to avoid haze\nevents in the future.",

Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-51,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-51, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn AI-based Nonspherical Aerosol Optical Scheme (AI-NAOS) was developed to improve the estimation of aerosol direct radiation effect (DRE). The AI-NAOS scheme considers BC as fractal aggregates and SD as super-spheroids, encapsulated with hygroscopic aerosols. The AI-NAOS scheme was coupled online with a chemical weather model. Real-case simulations emphasize the necessity of accurately representing nonpsherical and inhomogeneous aerosols in chemical weather models.\n\nMolecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban Beijing: insights from Vocus-PTR measurements\n\nZhaojin An, Rujing Yin, Xinyan Zhao, Xiaoxiao Li, Yi Yuan, Junchen Guo, Yuyang Li, Xue Li, Dandan Li, Yaowei Li, Dongbin Wang, Chao Yan, Kebin He, Douglas R.

With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various sub-ppt level species and organics with multiple oxygens (≥3) were discovered. The fast photooxidation process in summer leads to an increase in both concentration and proportion of organics with multiple oxygens. While in other seasons, the variations of them could be influenced by primary emissions.\n\nExploring the sources of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols by integrating observational and modeling results: insights from Northeast China\n\nYuan Cheng, Xu-bing Cao, Sheng-qiang Zhu, Zhi-qing Zhang, Jiu-meng Liu, Hong-liang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, and Ke-bin He\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1260,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1260, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn agreement between observational and modeling results is essential for the development of efficient air pollution control strategies. Here we constrained the modeling results of carbonaceous aerosols by field observation in Northeast China, a historically overlooked but recently targeted region of national clean air actions. Our results suggested that the estimation of agricultural fire emission and prediction of secondary organic aerosol remain challenging.\n\nModeling fuel-, vehicle type-, and age-specific CO2 emissions from global on-road vehicles, 1970–2020\n\nLiu Yan, Qiang Zhang, Kebin He, and Bo Zheng\n\nEarth Syst.

Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-101,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2024-101, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ESSD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new database of fuel-, vehicle type-, and age-specific CO2 emissions from global on-road vehicles from 1970 to 2020 is developed with the fleet turnover model built in this study. Based on this database, the evolution of the global vehicle stock over 50 years is analyzed, the dominant emission contributors by vehicle and fuel type is identified, and the age distribution of on-road CO2 emissions is further characterized.\n\nMIXv2: a long-term mosaic emission inventory for Asia (2010â2017)\n\nMeng Li, Junichi Kurokawa, Qiang Zhang, Jung-Hun Woo, Tazuko Morikawa, Satoru Chatani, Zifeng Lu, Yu Song, Guannan Geng, Hanwen Hu, Jinseok Kim, Owen R. Cooper, and Brian C. McDonald\n\nAtmos. Chem.

With high spatial (0.1°) and monthly temporal resolution, MIXv2 integrates anthropogenic and open biomass burning emissions across seven sectors following a mosaic methodology. It provides CO2 emissions data alongside nine key pollutants and three chemical mechanisms. Our publicly accessible gridded monthly emissions data can facilitate long-term atmospheric and climate model analyses.\n\nSensitivity of the WRF-Chem v4.4 simulations of ozone and formaldehyde and their precursors to multiple bottom-up emission inventories over East Asia during the KORUS-AQ 2016 field campaign\n\nKyoung-Min Kim, Si-Wan Kim, Seunghwan Seo, Donald R.

The inventories successfully reproduced the daily variations of ozone and nitrogen dioxide. However, the spatial distributions of model ozone did not fully agree with the observations. Additionally, all simulations underestimated carbon monoxide and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels. Increasing VOC emissions over South Korea resulted in improved ozone simulations.\n\nComprehensive evaluation of typical planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes in China â Part 2: Influence of uncertainty factors\n\nWenxing Jia, Xiaoye Zhang, Hong Wang, Yaqiang Wang, Deying Wang, Junting Zhong, Wenjie Zhang, Lei Zhang, Lifeng Guo, Yadong Lei, Jizhi Wang, Yuanqin Yang, and Yi Lin\n\nGeosci.

In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance capability of the PBL scheme in five typical regions of China in different seasons from the mechanism of the scheme and the effects of PBL schemes on the near-surface meteorological parameters, vertical structures of the PBL, PBL height, and turbulent diffusion.\n\nSuperimposed effects of typical local circulations driven by mountainous topography and aerosolâradiation interaction on heavy haze in the BeijingâTianjinâHebei central and southern plains in winter\n\nYue Peng, Hong Wang, Xiaoye Zhang, Zhaodong Liu, Wenjie Zhang, Siting Li, Chen Han, and Huizheng Che\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8325–8339, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study demonstrates a strong link between local circulation, aerosol–radiation interaction (ARI), and haze pollution. Under the weak weather-scale systems, the typical local circulation driven by mountainous topography is the main cause of pollutant distribution in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, and the ARI mechanism amplifies this influence of local circulation on pollutants, making haze pollution aggravated by the superposition of both.\n\nImplementation and application of ensemble optimal interpolation on an operational chemistry weather model for improving PM2.5 and visibility predictions\n\nSiting Li, Ping Wang, Hong Wang, Yue Peng, Zhaodong Liu, Wenjie Zhang, Hongli Liu, Yaqiang Wang, Huizheng Che, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4171–4191, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4171-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4171-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOptimizing the initial state of atmospheric chemistry model input is one of the most essential methods to improve forecast accuracy. Considering the large computational load of the model, we introduce an ensemble optimal interpolation scheme (EnOI) for operational use and efficient updating of the initial fields of chemical components. The results suggest that EnOI provides a practical and cost-effective technique for improving the accuracy of chemical weather numerical forecasts.\n\nCharacterization of dust-related new particle formation events based on long-term measurement in the North China Plain\n\nXiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Huizheng Che, Yangmei Zhang, Chunhong Zhou, Ke Gui, Wanyun Xu, Quan Liu, Junting Zhong, Can Xia, Xinyao Hu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Shuo Liu, Jiayuan Lu, Aoyuan Yu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

Analysis shows that the observed formation and growth rates are approximately 50 % of and 30 % lower than those of other NPF events. As a consequence of the uptake of precursor gases on mineral dust, the physical and chemical properties of submicron particles, as well as the ability to be cloud condensation nuclei, can be changed.\n\nEast Asian methane emissions inferred from high-resolution inversions of GOSAT and TROPOMI observations: a comparative and evaluative analysis\n\nRuosi Liang, Yuzhong Zhang, Wei Chen, Peixuan Zhang, Jingran Liu, Cuihong Chen, Huiqin Mao, Guofeng Shen, Zhen Qu, Zichong Chen, Minqiang Zhou, Pucai Wang, Robert J. Parker, Hartmut Boesch, Alba Lorente, Joannes D. Maasakkers, and Ilse Aben\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The results show discrepancies over northern India and eastern China. Independent ground-based observations are more consistent with TROPOMI-derived emissions in northern India and GOSAT-derived emissions in eastern China.\n\nMeasurement report: Rapid decline of aerosol absorption coefficient and aerosol optical property effects on radiative forcing in an urban area of Beijing from 2018 to 2021\n\nXinyao Hu, Junying Sun, Can Xia, Xiaojing Shen, Yangmei Zhang, Quan Liu, Zhaodong Liu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Aoyuan Yu, Jiayuan Lu, Shuo Liu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5517–5531, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5517-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5517-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe simultaneous measurements under dry conditions of aerosol optical properties were conducted at three wavelengths for PM1 and PM10 in urban Beijing from 2018 to 2021. Considerable reductions in aerosol absorption coefficient and increased single scattering albedo demonstrated that absorbing aerosols were more effectively controlled than scattering aerosols due to pollution control measures. The aerosol radiative effect and the transport's impact on aerosol optical properties were analysed.\n\nCoarse particulate matter air quality in East Asia: implications for fine particulate nitrate\n\nShixian Zhai, Daniel J.

Dibb, Taehyoung Lee, Jin-Seok Han, Bruce E. Anderson, Ke Li, and Hong Liao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4271–4281, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4271-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4271-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnthropogenic fugitive dust in East Asia not only causes severe coarse particulate matter air pollution problems, but also affects fine particulate nitrate. Due to emission control efforts, coarse PM decreased steadily. We find that the decrease of coarse PM is a major driver for a lack of decrease of fine particulate nitrate, as it allows more nitric acid to form fine particulate nitrate. The continuing decrease of coarse PM requires more stringent ammonia and nitrogen oxides emission controls.\n\nImpacts of reductions in non-methane short-lived climate forcers on future climate extremes and the resulting population exposure risks in eastern and southern Asia\n\nYingfang Li, Zhili Wang, Yadong Lei, Huizheng Che, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2499–2523, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2499-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2499-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSince few studies have assessed the impacts of future combined reductions in aerosols, ozone, and their precursors on future climate change, we use models with an interactive representation of tropospheric aerosols and atmospheric chemistry schemes to quantify the impact of their reductions on the Asian climate. Our results suggest that their reductions will exacerbate the warming effect caused by greenhouse gases, increasing future climate extremes and associated population exposure risk.\n\nQuantifying daily NOx and CO2 emissions from Wuhan using satellite observations from TROPOMI and OCO-2\n\nQianqian Zhang, K. Folkert Boersma, Bin Zhao, Henk Eskes, Cuihong Chen, Haotian Zheng, and Xingying Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 551–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-551-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-551-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an improved superposition column model and used the latest released (v2.3.1) TROPOMI satellite NO2 observations to estimate daily city-scale NOx and CO2 emissions. The results are verified against bottom-up emissions and OCO-2 XCO2 observations. We obtained the day-to-day variation of city NOx and CO2 emissions, allowing policymakers to gain real-time information on spatial–temporal emission patterns and the effectiveness of carbon and nitrogen regulation in urban environments.\n\nDevelopment and application of a multi-scale modeling framework for urban high-resolution NO2 pollution mapping\n\nZhaofeng Lv, Zhenyu Luo, Fanyuan Deng, Xiaotong Wang, Junchao Zhao, Lucheng Xu, Tingkun He, Yingzhi Zhang, Huan Liu, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15685–15702, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15685-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15685-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study developed a hybrid model, CMAQ-RLINE_URBAN, to predict the urban NO2 concentrations at a high spatial resolution. To estimate the influence of various street canyons on the dispersion of air pollutants, a new parameterization scheme was established based on computational fluid dynamics and machine learning methods. This work created a new method to identify the characteristics of vehicle-related air pollution at both city and street scales simultaneously and accurately.\n\nAerosolâcloud interaction in the atmospheric chemistry model GRAPES_Meso5.1/CUACE and its impacts on mesoscale numerical weather prediction under haze pollution conditions in JingâJinâJi in China\n\nWenjie Zhang, Hong Wang, Xiaoye Zhang, Liping Huang, Yue Peng, Zhaodong Liu, Xiao Zhang, and Huizheng Che\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15207–15221, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15207-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15207-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) is first implemented in the atmospheric chemistry system GRAPES_Meso5.1/CUACE. ACI can improve the simulated cloud, temperature, and precipitation under haze pollution conditions in Jing-Jin-Ji in China. This paper demonstrates the critical role of ACI in current numerical weather prediction over the severely polluted region.\n\nEffect of tides on river water behavior over the eastern shelf seas of China\n\nLei Lin, Hao Liu, Xiaomeng Huang, Qingjun Fu, and Xinyu Guo\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5207–5225, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5207-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5207-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth system (climate) model is an important instrument for projecting the global water cycle and climate change, in which tides are commonly excluded due to the much small timescales compared to the climate. However, we found that tides significantly impact the river water transport pathways, transport timescales, and concentrations in shelf seas. Thus, the tidal effect should be carefully considered in earth system models to accurately project the global water and biogeochemical cycle.\n\nSpatiotemporal continuous estimates of daily 1 km PM2.5 from 2000 to present under the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP) framework\n\nQingyang Xiao, Guannan Geng, Shigan Liu, Jiajun Liu, Xia Meng, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13229–13242, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13229-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13229-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provided complete coverage PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km resolution from 2000 to the present, carefully considering the significant changes in land use characteristics in China. This high-resolution PM2.5 data successfully revealed the local-scale PM2.5 variations. We noticed changes in PM2.5 spatial patterns in association with the clean air policies, with the pollution hotspots having transferred from urban centers to rural regions with limited air quality monitoring.\n\nImpacts of condensable particulate matter on atmospheric organic aerosols and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in China\n\nMengying Li, Shaocai Yu, Xue Chen, Zhen Li, Yibo Zhang, Zhe Song, Weiping Liu, Pengfei Li, Xiaoye Zhang, Meigen Zhang, Yele Sun, Zirui Liu, Caiping Sun, Jingkun Jiang, Shuxiao Wang, Benjamin N.

The results show that OA emissions are enhanced twofold for the years 2014 and 2017 after the inclusion of CPM in the new inventory. Sensitivity cases demonstrated the significant contributions of CPM emissions from stationary combustion and mobile sources to primary, secondary, and total OA concentrations.\n\nGlobal and regional carbon budget for 2015â2020 inferred from OCO-2 based on an ensemble Kalman filter coupled with GEOS-Chem\n\nYawen Kong, Bo Zheng, Qiang Zhang, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This is the first adaptation of 4D-LETKF to an OCO-2-based global carbon inversion system. We inferred global gridded carbon fluxes and investigated their magnitudes, variations, and partitioning schemes to understand the global and regional carbon budgets for 2015–2020.\n\nClimatology of aerosol component concentrations derived from multi-angular polarimetric POLDER-3 observations using GRASP algorithm\n\nLei Li, Yevgeny Derimian, Cheng Chen, Xindan Zhang, Huizheng Che, Gregory L.

The conceptual specifics of the GRASP/Component approach are in the direct retrieval of aerosol speciation without intermediate retrievals of aerosol optical characteristics. The dataset of satellite-derived components represents scarce but imperative information for validation and potential adjustment of chemical transport models.\n\nReconstructing 6-hourly PM2.5 datasets from 1960 to 2020 in China\n\nJunting Zhong, Xiaoye Zhang, Ke Gui, Jie Liao, Ye Fei, Lipeng Jiang, Lifeng Guo, Liangke Liu, Huizheng Che, Yaqiang Wang, Deying Wang, and Zijiang Zhou\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Here, we reconstruct site-based and gridded PM2.5 datasets at 6-hour intervals from 1960 to 2020 that combine visibility, meteorological data, and emissions based on a machine learning model with extracted spatial features. These two PM2.5 datasets will lay the foundation of research studies associated with air pollution, climate change, and aerosol reanalysis.\n\nSeasonal variations in fire conditions are important drivers in the trend of aerosol optical properties over the south-eastern Atlantic\n\nHaochi Che, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Lu Zhang, Caroline Dang, Paquita Zuidema, Arthur J. Sedlacek III, Xiaoye Zhang, and Connor Flynn\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8767–8785, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8767-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8767-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA 17-month in situ study on Ascension Island found low single-scattering albedo and strong absorption enhancement of the marine boundary layer aerosols during biomass burnings on the African continent, along with apparent patterns of regular monthly variability. We further discuss the characteristics and drivers behind these changes and find that biomass burning conditions in Africa may be the main factor influencing the optical properties of marine boundary aerosols.\n\nImproving NOx emission estimates in Beijing using network observations and a perturbed emissions ensemble\n\nLe Yuan, Olalekan A. M. Popoola, Christina Hood, David Carruthers, Roderic L. Jones, Haitong Zhe Sun, Huan Liu, Qiang Zhang, and Alexander T. Archibald\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8617–8637, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8617-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8617-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission estimates represent a major source of uncertainty in air quality modelling. We developed a novel approach to improve emission estimates from existing inventories using air quality models and routine in situ observations. Using this approach, we derived improved estimates of NOx emissions from the transport sector in Beijing in 2016. This approach has great potential in deriving timely updates of emissions for other pollutants, particularly in regions undergoing rapid emission changes.\n\nDaily evolution of VOCs in Beijing: chemistry, emissions, transport, and policy implications\n\nMarios Panagi, Roberto Sommariva, ZoÃ« L.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-379,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-379, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA dispersion model and a box model were combined to investigate the evolution of VOCs in Beijing once they are emitted from anthropogenic sources. It was determined that during the winter time the VOC concentrations in Beijing are driven predominantly by sources within Beijing and by a combination of transport and chemistry during the summer. Furthermore, the results in the paper highlight the need for a season specific policy.\n\nRecord-breaking dust loading during two mega dust storm events over northern China in March 2021: aerosol optical and radiative properties and meteorological drivers\n\nKe Gui, Wenrui Yao, Huizheng Che, Linchang An, Yu Zheng, Lei Li, Hujia Zhao, Lei Zhang, Junting Zhong, Yaqiang Wang, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

The MODIS-retrieved DOD data registered these two events as the most intense episode in the same period in history over the past 20 years. These two extreme SDS events were associated with both atmospheric circulation extremes and local meteorological anomalies that favor enhanced dust emissions in the Gobi Desert.\n\nEvaluation of aerosol microphysical, optical and radiative properties measured with a multiwavelength photometer\n\nYu Zheng, Huizheng Che, Yupeng Wang, Xiangao Xia, Xiuqing Hu, Xiaochun Zhang, Jun Zhu, Jibiao Zhu, Hujia Zhao, Lei Li, Ke Gui, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

We developed a reduced-complexity air quality Intervention Model for Air Pollution over China (InMAP-China) to rapidly predict the air quality and estimate the health impacts of emission sources in China. We believe that this work will be of great interest to a broad audience, including environmentalists in China and scientists in relevant fields at both national and local institutes.\n\nImpact of modified turbulent diffusion of PM2.5 aerosol in WRF-Chem simulations in eastern China\n\nWenxing Jia and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16827–16841, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16827-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16827-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHeavy aerosol pollution incidents have attracted much attention since 2013, but the temporal and spatial limitations of observations and the inaccuracy of simulation are a stumbling block to assessing pollution mechanisms. The correct simulation of boundary layer mixing process of pollutant is a challenge for mesoscale numerical models. We add the turbulent diffusion term of aerosol to the WRF-Chem model to prove the impact of turbulent diffusion on pollutant concentration.\n\nRelating geostationary satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over East Asia to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): insights from the KORUS-AQ aircraft campaign and GEOS-Chem model simulations\n\nShixian Zhai, Daniel J.

Our study explored the physical relationship between AOD and PM2.5 by integrating data from surface networks, aircraft, and satellites with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We quantitatively showed that accurate simulation of aerosol size distributions, boundary layer depths, relative humidity, coarse particles, and diurnal variations in PM2.5 are essential.\n\nImpacts of emission changes in China from 2010 to 2017 on domestic and intercontinental air quality and health effect\n\nYuqiang Zhang, Drew Shindell, Karl Seltzer, Lu Shen, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Qiang Zhang, Bo Zheng, Jia Xing, Zhe Jiang, and Lei Zhang\n\nAtmos.

By performing sensitivity analysis, we found that the air pollution control policies not only decrease the air pollutant concentration but also bring significant co-benefits in air quality to downwind regions. The benefits for the improved air pollution are dominated by PM2.5.\n\nThree-dimensional climatology, trends, and meteorological drivers of global and regional tropospheric type-dependent aerosols: insights from 13 years (2007â2019) of CALIOP observations\n\nKe Gui, Huizheng Che, Yu Zheng, Hujia Zhao, Wenrui Yao, Lei Li, Lei Zhang, Hong Wang, Yaqiang Wang, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

Results revealed that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the free troposphere contribute 62.08 % and 37.92 %, respectively, of the global tropospheric TAOD. Trends in CALIOP-derived aerosol loading, in particular those partitioned in the PBL, can be explained to a large extent by meteorology.\n\nDramatic changes in Harbin aerosol during 2018â2020: the roles of open burning policy and secondary aerosol formation\n\nYuan Cheng, Qin-qin Yu, Jiu-meng Liu, Xu-bing Cao, Ying-jie Zhong, Zhen-yu Du, Lin-lin Liang, Guan-nan Geng, Wan-li Ma, Hong Qi, Qiang Zhang, and Ke-bin He\n\nAtmos.

This study evaluated the responses of PM2.5 pollution to this transition and suggested that neither of the policies could be considered successful. In addition, heterogeneous reactions were found to be at play in secondary aerosol formation, even in the frigid atmosphere in Heilongjiang.

Phys., 21, 13835–13853, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13835-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13835-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study updates our previous Ship Emission Inventory Model to version 2.0 (SEIM v2.0) and develops high-spatiotemporal ship emission inventories of Chinaâs inland rivers and a 200 nautical mile coastal zone in 2016â2019. The 4-year consecutive daily ship emissions and emission structure changes are analyzed from the national to port levels. The results of this study can provide high-quality datasets for air quality modeling and observation experiment verifications.\n\nAssessment of strict autumn-winter emission controls on air quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region\n\nGongda Lu, Eloise A. Marais, Tuan V. Vu, Jingsha Xu, Zongbo Shi, James D. Lee, Qiang Zhang, Lu Shen, Gan Luo, and Fangqun Yu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-428, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission controls were imposed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in northern China in autumn-winter 2017. We find that regional PM2.5 targets (15 % decrease relative to previous year) were exceeded. Our analysis shows that decline in precursor emissions only leads to less than half (43 %) the improved air quality. Most of the change (57 %) is due to interannual variability in meteorology. Stricter emission controls may be necessary in years with unfavourable meteorology.\n\nReduced light absorption of black carbon (BC) and its influence on BC-boundary-layer interactions during âAPEC Blueâ\n\nMeng Gao, Yang Yang, Hong Liao, Bin Zhu, Yuxuan Zhang, Zirui Liu, Xiao Lu, Chen Wang, Qiming Zhou, Yuesi Wang, Qiang Zhang, Gregory R.

However, there is still large uncertainty in predicting SOA in urban regions. Here, we used data from 11 urban campaigns and show that the variability in SOA production in these regions is predictable and is explained by key emissions. These results are used to estimate the premature mortality associated with SOA in urban regions.\n\nA global CO2 flux dataset (2015–2019) inferred from OCO-2 retrievals using the Tan-Tracker inversion system\n\nZhe Jin, Xiangjun Tian, Rui Han, Yu Fu, Xin Li, Huiqin Mao, and Cuihong Chen\n\nEarth Syst.

Here we developed a sophisticated dynamic projection model to understand 2015–2050 emission pathways under a range of socio-economic, climate policy, and pollution control scenarios. By coupling strong low-carbon transitions and clean air policy, emissions of major air pollutants in China will be reduced by 58–87 % during 2015–2050. This work can support future co-governance policy design.\n\nMeasurement report: Characteristics and sources of non-methane VOCs and their roles in SOA formation during autumn in a central Chinese city\n\nHaixu Zhang, Chunrong Chen, Weijia Yan, Nana Wu, Yu Bo, Qiang Zhang, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-280,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-280, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we provide first-hand information on VOC characters in a central Chinese city. Although benzenoids has the largest SOA formation potential, their weight decline with the aggravation of pollution, while the role of VOCs as oxidant producers of SOA formation is critical, especially in hazy periods. Furthermore, solvent evaporation is estimated as the top source for SOA formation considering the above dual roles of VOCs, which would assist to mitigate pollution in China.\n\nIntercomparison between the aerosol optical properties retrieved by different inversion methods from SKYNET sky radiometer observations over Qionghai and Yucheng in China\n\nZhe Jiang, Minzheng Duan, Huizheng Che, Wenxing Zhang, Teruyuki Nakajima, Makiko Hashimoto, Bin Chen, and Akihiro Yamazaki\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 1195–1212, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-1195-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-1195-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study analyzed the aerosol optical properties derived by SKYRAD.pack versions 5.0 and 4.2 using the radiometer measurements over Qionghai and Yucheng in China, which are two new sites of SKYNET. The seasonal variability of the aerosol properties over the two sites were investigated based on SKYRAD.pack V5.0. The validation results provide valuable references for continued improvement of the retrieval algorithms of SKYNET and other aerosol observational networks.\n\nModeling diurnal variation of surface PM2.5 concentrations over East China with WRF-Chem: impacts from boundary-layer mixing and anthropogenic emission\n\nQiuyan Du, Chun Zhao, Mingshuai Zhang, Xue Dong, Yu Chen, Zhen Liu, Zhiyuan Hu, Qiang Zhang, Yubin Li, Renmin Yuan, and Shiguang Miao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 2839–2863, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2839-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2839-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimulated diurnal PM2.5 with WRF-Chem is primarily controlled by planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing and emission variations. Modeling bias is likely primarily due to inefficient PBL mixing of primary PM2.5 during the night. The increase in PBL mixing strength during the night can significantly reduce biases. This study underscores that more effort is needed to improve the boundary mixing processes of pollutants in models with observations of PBL structure and mixing fluxes besides PBL height.\n\nInvestigating the regional contributions to air pollution in Beijing: aÂ dispersion modelling study using CO as aÂ tracer\n\nMarios Panagi, ZoÃ« L. Fleming, Paul S. Monks, Matthew J. Ashfold, Oliver Wild, Michael Hollaway, Qiang Zhang, Freya A. Squires, and Joshua D. Vande Hey\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 2825–2838, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2825-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2825-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, using dispersion modelling with emission inventories it was determined that on average 45 % of the total CO pollution that affects Beijing is transported from other areas. About half of the CO comes from beyond the immediate surrounding areas. Finally three classification types of pollution were identified and used to analyse the APHH winter campaign. The results can inform targeted control measures to be implemented in Beijing and the other regions to tackle air quality problems.\n\nStreet-scale air quality modelling for Beijing during a winter 2016 measurement campaign\n\nMichael Biggart, Jenny Stocker, Ruth M. Doherty, Oliver Wild, Michael Hollaway, David Carruthers, Jie Li, Qiang Zhang, Ruili Wu, Simone Kotthaus, Sue Grimmond, Freya A. Squires, James Lee, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 2755–2780, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2755-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2755-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient air pollution is a major cause of premature death in China. We examine the street-scale variation of pollutant levels in Beijing using air pollution dispersion and chemistry model ADMS-Urban. Campaign measurements are compared with simulated pollutant levels, providing a valuable means of evaluating the impact of key processes on urban air quality. Air quality modelling at such fine scales is essential for human exposure studies and for informing choices on future emission controls.\n\nChina's emission control strategies have suppressed unfavorable influences of climate on wintertime PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing since 2002\n\nMeng Gao, Zirui Liu, Bo Zheng, Dongsheng Ji, Peter Sherman, Shaojie Song, Jinyuan Xin, Cheng Liu, Yuesi Wang, Qiang Zhang, Jia Xing, Jingkun Jiang, Zifa Wang, Gregory R. Carmichael, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 1497–1505, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1497-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1497-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantified the relative influences of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions on PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing over the winters of 2002–2016. Meteorological conditions over the study period would have led to an increase of haze in Beijing, but the strict emission control measures have suppressed the unfavorable influences of the recent climate.\n\nEffect of changing NOx lifetime on the seasonality and long-term trends of satellite-observed tropospheric NO2 columns over China\n\nViral Shah, Daniel J. Jacob, Ke Li, Rachel F. Silvern, Shixian Zhai, Mengyao Liu, Jintai Lin, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 1483–1495, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1483-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-1483-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze 15 years of satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and use an atmospheric chemistry model to understand the seasonal changes and trends in nitrogen oxides (NOx) over China. We show that the seasonal changes in NO2 occur due to changes in the NOx oxidation lifetime. We find that Chinese NOx emissions peaked in 2011 and had decreased by about 25 % by 2018. But the decrease in NO2 in winter was larger, likely because of a simultaneous decrease in the NOx oxidation lifetime.\n\nChemical characteristics of PM2.5: Impact of biomass burning at an agricultural site of the North China Plain during a season of transition\n\nLinlin Liang, Guenter Engling, Chang Liu, Wanyun Xu, Xuyan Liu, Yuan Cheng, Zhenyu Du, Gen Zhang, Junying Sun, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-19,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-19, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study captured an episode with extreme biomass burning tracer level at an agricultural site in North China, with concentrations of levoglucosan as high as 4.37 μg m−3. Based on comparison of the chemical composition between different biomass burning periods, it appeared that biomass burning can obviously elevate the levels of organic components, but seems to have no significant effect on the production of secondary inorganic ions, although their precursors increased during the episode.\n\nAir quality and climate change, Topic 3 of the Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia PhaseÂ III (MICS-Asia III) â PartÂ 2: aerosol radiative effects and aerosol feedbacks\n\nMeng Gao, Zhiwei Han, Zhining Tao, Jiawei Li, Jeong-Eon Kang, Kan Huang, Xinyi Dong, Bingliang Zhuang, Shu Li, Baozhu Ge, Qizhong Wu, Hyo-Jung Lee, Cheol-Hee Kim, Joshua S.

Besides, the aerosol pollution and aerosol transport processes over the TP are also analyzed by the observations and models. The results in this region could help reduce the assessment uncertainties of aerosol radiative forcing and provide more information on aerosol transportation.\n\nOpenArray v1.0: a simple operator library for the decoupling of ocean modeling and parallel computing\n\nXiaomeng Huang, Xing Huang, Dong Wang, Qi Wu, Yi Li, Shixun Zhang, Yuwen Chen, Mingqing Wang, Yuan Gao, Qiang Tang, Yue Chen, Zheng Fang, Zhenya Song, and Guangwen Yang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 4729–4749, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4729-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4729-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe designed a simple computing library (OpenArray) to decouple ocean modelling and parallel computing. OpenArray provides 12 basic operators featuring user-friendly interfaces and an implicit parallelization ability. Based on OpenArray, we implement a practical ocean model with an enhanced readability and an excellent scalable performance. OpenArray may signal the beginning of a new frontier in future ocean modelling through ingesting basic operators and cutting-edge computing techniques.\n\nRetrieval of aerosol components directly from satellite and ground-based measurements\n\nLei Li, Oleg Dubovik, Yevgeny Derimian, Gregory L. Schuster, Tatyana Lapyonok, Pavel Litvinov, Fabrice Ducos, David Fuertes, Cheng Chen, Zhengqiang Li, Anton Lopatin, Benjamin Torres, and Huizheng Che\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13409–13443, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13409-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13409-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA novel methodology to monitor atmospheric aerosol components using remote sensing is presented. The concept is realized within the GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties) project. Application to POLDER/PARASOL and AERONET observations yielded the spatial and temporal variability of absorbing and non-absorbing insoluble and soluble aerosol species in the fine and coarse size fractions. This presents the global-scale aerosol component derived from satellite measurements.\n\nAerosol vertical mass flux measurements during heavy aerosol pollution episodes at a rural site and an urban site in the Beijing area of the North China Plain\n\nRenmin Yuan, Xiaoye Zhang, Hao Liu, Yu Gui, Bohao Shao, Xiaoping Tao, Yaqiang Wang, Junting Zhong, Yubin Li, and Zhiqiu Gao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 12857–12874, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12857-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12857-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo understand the contribution of ground emission during heavy pollution in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, aerosol fluxes were estimated in Beijing and Gucheng areas. The results show that in the three stages of a heavy pollution process (transport, accumulative and removal stages: TS, AS and RS), the ground emissions in the TS and RS stages are stronger, while the ground discharge in the AS stage is weak. The weakened mass flux indicates that the already weak turbulence would be further weakened.\n\nSpatial distribution of aerosol microphysical and optical properties and direct radiative effect from the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network\n\nHuizheng Che, Xiangao Xia, Hujia Zhao, Oleg Dubovik, Brent N.

SKYNET data retrieved by SR-CEReS analysis package are used to analyze a serious pollution event in winter over Beijing. The AOPs under three weather conditions (clean, dusty, haze) in Beijing are discussed. Measurements from the SKYNET skyradiometer can be used to analyze the AOPs over Beijing reasonably.\n\nRapid transition in winter aerosol composition in Beijing from 2014 to 2017: response to clean air actions\n\nHaiyan Li, Jing Cheng, Qiang Zhang, Bo Zheng, Yuxuan Zhang, Guangjie Zheng, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 11485–11499, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11485-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11485-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combined the online observations of aerosol components and a regional chemical transport model to investigate the response of aerosol chemistry to the stringent clean air actions in Beijing. We found a rapid transition in winter aerosol composition from 2014 to 2017 with decreased sulfate contribution and increased nitrate fraction and evaluated the underlying drivers. The anthropogenic emission reductions in Beijing and its surrounding regions are identified to play a major role.\n\nAssessing the impact of clean air action on air quality trends in Beijing using a machine learning technique\n\nTuan V.

Here, we applied a novel machine-learning-based model to determine the real trend in air quality from 2013 to 2017 in Beijing to assess the efficacy of the plan. We showed that the action plan led to a major reduction in primary emissions and significant improvement in air quality. The marked decrease in PM2.5 and SO2 is largely attributable to a reduction in coal combustion.\n\nLarge contribution of meteorological factors to inter-decadal changes in regional aerosol optical depth\n\nHuizheng Che, Ke Gui, Xiangao Xia, Yaqiang Wang, Brent N. Holben, Philippe Goloub, Emilio Cuevas-AgullÃ³, Hong Wang, Yu Zheng, Hujia Zhao, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem.

AOD observations from both AERONET and CARSNET were used for the first time to assess the performance of the MERRA-2 AOD dataset on a global scale. Based on statistical models, we found the meteorological parameters explained a larger proportion of the regional AOD variability (20.4 %–2.8 %) when compared with emission factors (0 %%–56 %).\n\nOrganic coating on sulfate and soot particles during late summer in the Svalbard Archipelago\n\nHua Yu, Weijun Li, Yangmei Zhang, Peter Tunved, Manuel Dall'Osto, Xiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Xiaoye Zhang, Jianchao Zhang, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos.

The mixing state of different aerosols is a key parameter influencing such interactions. However, little is known of this parameter, preventing an accurate representation of this information in global models. Multi-microscopic techniques were used to find one general core–shell structure in which secondary sulfate particles were covered by organic coating in the Arctic atmosphere.\n\nModeling the aging process of black carbon during atmospheric transport using a new approach: a case study in Beijing\n\nYuxuan Zhang, Meng Li, Yafang Cheng, Guannan Geng, Chaopeng Hong, Haiyan Li, Xin Li, Dan Tong, Nana Wu, Xin Zhang, Bo Zheng, Yixuan Zheng, Yu Bo, Hang Su, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos.

The model tracks the evolution of BC aging degree during atmospheric transport. Our simulations identified the important roles of extensive emission regions in the BC aging process during atmospheric transport, which provided more clues for improving air pollution and climate change.\n\nInvestigations into the development of a satellite-based aerosol climate data record using ATSR-2, AATSR and AVHRR data over north-eastern China from 1987 to 2012\n\nYahui Che, Jie Guang, Gerrit de Leeuw, Yong Xue, Ling Sun, and Huizheng Che\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The study is made over a small area in northern China with a large variation of AOD values. Sun photometer data from AERONET and CARSNET and radiance-derived AOD are used as reference. The results show that all data sets compare well. However, AVHRR underestimates high AOD (mainly occurring in summer) but performs better than (A)ATSR in winter.\n\nPersistent growth of anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions in China during 1990â2017: drivers, speciation and ozone formation potential\n\nMeng Li, Qiang Zhang, Bo Zheng, Dan Tong, Yu Lei, Fei Liu, Chaopeng Hong, Sicong Kang, Liu Yan, Yuxuan Zhang, Yu Bo, Hang Su, Yafang Cheng, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos.

We estimated Chinaâs NMVOCs during 1990–2017 with speciation based on updated databases and investigated the trend of ozone formation potential (OFP) for the same period. Persistent growth of emissions and OFP highlights the need of control measures for solvent use and industrial sources and the importance of designing multi-pollutant control strategies.\n\nExploring 2016â2017 surface ozone pollution over China: source contributions and meteorological influences\n\nXiao Lu, Lin Zhang, Youfan Chen, Mi Zhou, Bo Zheng, Ke Li, Yiming Liu, Jintai Lin, Tzung-May Fu, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos.

It induces that some studies mislead some anthropogenic particles into biological particles through electron microscopy. Here we firstly estimate the full database of individual PBAPs through two microscopic instruments. The database is good for research.\n\nIntroduction to the special issue âIn-depth study of air pollution sources and processes within Beijing and its surrounding region (APHH-Beijing)â\n\nZongbo Shi, Tuan Vu, Simone Kotthaus, Roy M.

To identify both source types and source regions at the same time, this study developed a combined method including receptor model, footprint model, and air quality model for the first time to investigate sources of PM2.5 during haze episodes in Beijing. It is an expansion of the application of the receptor model and is helpful for formulating effective control strategies to improve air quality in this region.\n\nDominant role of emission reduction in PM2.5 air quality improvement in Beijing during 2013â2017: aÂ model-based decomposition analysis\n\nJing Cheng, Jingping Su, Tong Cui, Xiang Li, Xin Dong, Feng Sun, Yanyan Yang, Dan Tong, Yixuan Zheng, Yanshun Li, Jinxiang Li, Qiang Zhang, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6125–6146, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6125-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6125-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe attribute Beijingâs PM2.5 abatement in 2017 (compared to 2013) to the following factors: meteorology changes (3.8 Î¼g m−3, 12.1 % of total), regional emission reduction (7.1 Î¼g m−3, 22.5 %), and seven specific categories of control measures in Beijing (20.6 Î¼g m−3, 65.4 %). Our study confirms the effectiveness of clean air actions in Beijing and its surrounding regions and reveals a new generation of control measures, and strengthened regional joint protection measures should be implemented.\n\nCompliance and port air quality features with respect to ship fuel switching regulation: a field observation campaign, SEISO-Bohai\n\nYanni Zhang, Fanyuan Deng, Hanyang Man, Mingliang Fu, Zhaofeng Lv, Qian Xiao, Xinxin Jin, Shuai Liu, Kebin He, and Huan Liu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 4899–4916, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4899-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4899-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study reports the improvement of air quality in port areas following the implementation of a marine fuel quality regulation. We found that the monitoring of NOx and SO2 concentrations in ship plumes could indicate whether a ship had switched to low-sulphur fuel or not. Results showed that most ships complied with the fuel regulation, which reduced the SO2 emissions by 75 %. After regulation, vanadium, which was used as marker for shipping emissions, decreased significantly (by 97.1 %).\n\nThe two-way feedback mechanism between unfavorable meteorological conditions and cumulative aerosol pollution in various haze regions of China\n\nJunting Zhong, Xiaoye Zhang, Yaqiang Wang, Jizhi Wang, Xiaojing Shen, Hongsheng Zhang, Tijian Wang, Zhouqing Xie, Cheng Liu, Hengde Zhang, Tianliang Zhao, Junying Sun, Shaojia Fan, Zhiqiu Gao, Yubin Li, and Linlin Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 3287–3306, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3287-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3287-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn various haze regions in China, including the Guanzhong Plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Pearl River Delta, the Sichuan Basin, and the Northeast China Plain, heavy aerosol pollution episodes include inter-/trans-regional transport stages and cumulative stages (CSs). During CSs a two-way feedback mechanism exists between unfavorable meteorological conditions and cumulative aerosol pollution. This two-way feedback is further quantified and its magnitude is compared.\n\nThe value of satellite observations in the analysis and short-range prediction of Asian dust\n\nAngela Benedetti, Francesca Di Giuseppe, Luke Jones, Vincent-Henri Peuch, Samuel RÃ©my, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

Chem. Phys., 18, 18063–18078, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-18063-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-18063-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the last decade, four temporal regimes of SO2 in China have been identified. After an initial rise, SO2 undergoes two sharp drops in 2007–2008 and 2014–2016, during which 5-year rebounding is sustained. Different mechanisms are tied to North and South China. The industrial emission is responsible for SO2 variation in North China, while in South China the meteorological conditions make a large contribution. The result is crucial to the understanding of SO2 changes and future polices.\n\nRapid SO2 emission reductions significantly increase tropospheric ammonia concentrations over the North China Plain\n\nMingxu Liu, Xin Huang, Yu Song, Tingting Xu, Shuxiao Wang, Zhijun Wu, Min Hu, Lin Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Yuepeng Pan, Xuejun Liu, and Tong Zhu\n\nAtmos.

Chem. Phys., 18, 17717–17733, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17717-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17717-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe explosive growth (EG) of PM2.5 resulted in a PM2.5 maximum, which was generally underestimated by atmospheric chemical models due to the deficient description of the local turbulence intermittent. The aerosol–radiation feedback (AF) and decrease in turbulence diffusion (DTD) may reduce the underestimation of PM2.5 EG by 20–25% and 14–20%, respectively. The modeled EG stage PM2.5 error was decreased from −40 to −51% to −11 to 2% by the combined effects of AF and DTD in Jing–Jin–Ji.\n\nInsignificant effect of climate change on winter haze pollution in Beijing\n\nLu Shen, Daniel J. Jacob, Loretta J. Mickley, Yuxuan Wang, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17489–17496, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17489-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17489-2018, 2018\n\nEvaluating the performance of two surface layer schemes for the momentum and heat exchange processes during severe haze pollution in Jing-Jin-Ji in eastern China\n\nYue Peng, Hong Wang, Yubin Li, Changwei Liu, Tianliang Zhao, Xiaoye Zhang, Zhiqiu Gao, Tong Jiang, Huizheng Che, and Meng Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17421–17435, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17421-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17421-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo surface layer schemes are evaluated in eastern China based on observational flux data. The results indicate that the Li scheme better describes regional atmosphere stratification compared with the MM5 scheme, especially for the transition stage from unstable to stable atmosphere conditions, corresponding to PM2.5 accumulation. Our research suggests the potential improved possibilities for severe haze prediction in eastern China by coupling Li online into atmosphere chemical models.\n\nImpacts of shipping emissions on PM2.5 pollution in China\n\nZhaofeng Lv, Huan Liu, Qi Ying, Mingliang Fu, Zhihang Meng, Yue Wang, Wei Wei, Huiming Gong, and Kebin He\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 15811–15824, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15811-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15811-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study comprehensively analyzed the impacts of the marine transport sector to the concentrations of PM2.5 and its components in eastern China on multiple temporal and spatial scales. Furthermore, a source-oriented CMAQ was used to identify the contributions of shipping emissions from different maritime areas to the inland air quality. This work supplemented the insufficiency of multi-scale researches on the influences of the shipping sector on the inland air quality.\n\nAdjoint inversion of Chinese non-methane volatile organic compound emissions using space-based observations of formaldehyde and glyoxal\n\nHansen Cao, Tzung-May Fu, Lin Zhang, Daven K. Henze, Christopher Chan Miller, Christophe Lerot, Gonzalo GonzÃ¡lez Abad, Isabelle De Smedt, Qiang Zhang, Michel van Roozendael, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Kelly Chance, Jie Li, Junyu Zheng, and Yuanhong Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 15017–15046, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15017-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15017-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur top-down estimates for annual total Chinese NMVOC emissions was 30.7 to 49.5 Tg y−1, including 16.4 to 23.6 Tg y−1 from anthropogenic sources, 12.2 to 22.8 Tg y−1 from biogenic sources, and 2.08 to 3.13 Tg y−1 from biomass burning. Our four inversions consistently showed that the emissions of Chinese anthropogenic NMVOC precursors of glyoxal were larger than the a priori estimates. The glyoxal and formaldehyde constraints helped distinguish the NMVOC species from different sources.\n\nTrends in China's anthropogenic emissions since 2010 as the consequence of clean air actions\n\nBo Zheng, Dan Tong, Meng Li, Fei Liu, Chaopeng Hong, Guannan Geng, Haiyan Li, Xin Li, Liqun Peng, Ji Qi, Liu Yan, Yuxuan Zhang, Hongyan Zhao, Yixuan Zheng, Kebin He, and Qiang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 14095–14111, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-14095-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-14095-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo tackle the problem of severe air pollution, China has implemented active clean air policies in recent years. We quantified Chinaâs anthropogenic emissions during 2010–2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and index decomposition analysis (IDA) approaches. The major air pollutants have reduced their emissions by 17–62 % during 2010–2017. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers.\n\nSpatiotemporal variability of NO2 and PM2.5 over Eastern China: observational and model analyses with a novel statistical method\n\nMengyao Liu, Jintai Lin, Yuchen Wang, Yang Sun, Bo Zheng, Jingyuan Shao, Lulu Chen, Yixuan Zheng, Jinxuan Chen, Tzung-May Fu, Yingying Yan, Qiang Zhang, and "
