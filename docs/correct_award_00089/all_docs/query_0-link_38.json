This book is his latest work, published in 2018. Mr. Pištalo is one of the best Serbian contemporary writers. He is recipient of many literary awards, among them 2008 NIN Literary Award, for the novel “Tesla: A Portrait with Masks”.\n\nThe Sun of This Day: a letter to Ivo Andri\n\nIvo Andric (1892 – 1975) was a Yugoslav novelist, poet and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. Pištalo's conversation with Ivo Andric is a conversation with the tradition. It shows us a different Andric, more emotional, more playful, more passionate. It is also a dialogue between two moments in history: the decolonization that marked Andric's era, and neocolonialism."
