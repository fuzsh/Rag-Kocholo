        "text": "​About story and storytelling\n\nFirst of all, I would ask you to read the speech here: http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1961/andric-speech.html\n\nIvo Andric was a Yugoslavian novelist, who won Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961 for The Bridge on the Drina. His writings were mainly about life in his native Bosnia during the Ottoman rule. The Bridge on the Drina (original name: Na Drini ćuprija) is a chronicle of Bosnian town of Višegrad spanning four centuries (from the 16th to 20th), revolving around the famous Višegrad bridge.\n\nAndric had held Nobel Prize Banquet speech on December 10th, 1961. in Stockholm. Dr. Andrea Esterling, who was the presenter of the award, states , among other things , that the jury \" followed the principle of fair distribution between different countries , which are valued on the world stage writers of small countries , thereby providing the opportunity to show their work to the general public in various languages of the world .\" ¹\n\nThe speech, slightly longer than four pages, which Andric named O priči i pričanju (translated: About the story and storytelling), gives the impression of completeness the writer's artistic process. In the introduction, the writer indicated two topics on which he will speak, that are both related to his homeland and to the story: \"I am allowed to, by receiving this recognition, say a few words about that country and make a few general observations regarding the narrative work that you rewarded.\" 2\n\nIn the speech we can see that Andric questions stories and storytelling and how do time and circumstances affect them and their changing process. Remembrance is permanent – that is the reason that storytelling has no end. “And one might say that after the fashion of the legendary and eloquent Scheherazade, this story attempts to stave off the executioner, to suspend the ineluctable decree of the fate that threatens us, and to prolong the illusion of life and of time.”2\n\nFurthermore, author justifies his storytelling about the past, tells about the authors of historical novels and connects the past and the present. Andric states that the most important thing is, \" to be a man\". In this manner, the writer should develop human destiny, it must be one “with which he must identify, giving it the strength of his breath and the warmth of his blood, which he must attempt to turn into the living texture of the story that he intends to translate for his readers, in such a way that the result be as beautiful, as simple, and as persuasive as possible.”2\n\n\"The storyteller and his work serve no purpose if you do not serve man and humanity .\"2\n\nReferences: ¹ Politika Online, About the story and storytelling.\n\n2 Citations from speech"
