        "text": "Ivo Andrić\n\nFacts\n\nIvo Andrić\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature 1961\n\nResidence at the time of the award: Yugoslavia (now N/A)\n\nPrize motivation: “for the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from the history of his country”\n\nLanguage: Serbo-Croatian\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nLife\n\nIvo Andrić was born into a craftsman’s family in Dolac in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After schooling in Višegrad and Sarajevo, Andrić studied subjects such as history and philosophy at universities in Zagreb, Vienna, Graz, and Crakow. Andrić worked for an association of southern Slavic countries, and after the formation of Yugoslavia, he served as a diplomat for the country. Beginning in the 1940s, he devoted himself mainly to his writing. Andrić married late and had no children.\n\nWork\n\nIvo Andrić initially wrote poetry, and his ideas were influenced by such philosophers as Kierkegaard. However, it was the historical epic that would become his main literary genre. Andrić’s works, including his novel Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina), illuminate the destinies of individuals against a historical, cultural, and religious background. His stories not only convey great affection for people but also depict violence and cruelty. His stories are rich in astute psychological observations, and his language is characterized by simplicity and a wealth of details.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: Ivo Andrić – Facts.
