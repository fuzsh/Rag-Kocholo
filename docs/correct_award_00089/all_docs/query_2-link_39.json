        "text": "A new Eco-Museum is launched in the city of Herceg Novi in Montenegro, and the house of Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić is the main active point of the museum. The museum was launched as part of the EU funded Co.Co.Tour project.\n\nThe Head of European Integration, Political Affairs, Media and Information Section at the EU Delegation to Montenegro, Plamena Halacheva, pointed out that the Eco-Museum exudes positive energy and that it was an honour for the EU to help revive it. “Andrić was always interested in the motif of bridges; he believed that they were an expression of the eternal human struggle to connect and unite the two opposing sides. Andrić showed that bridges bring peace, connect the past and the future, bring us together and bring prosperity. Just like Andrić, the EU is building bridges between people through our cross-border cooperation programmes. This project is a true example of that. In the spirit of Andrić, continue building bridges and connecting people of all nationalities, religions and cultures “, said Halacheva.\n\nEco-Museum and the house of the Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić – will soon become part of the tourist offer of Herceg Novi. Visitors will be able to see a permanent exhibition related to the life of the Nobel Laureate in Herceg Novi, but also to get acquainted with the 25 key attractions of the Eco-Museum/Community Museum through an electronic smart totem, as well as with other eco-museums in the Mediterranean network of eco-museums.\n\nThe Co.Co.Tour is funded under the EU Interreg cross border cooperation programme between Albania, Italy, and Montenegro. The objective of the project is to ensure a smart and sustainable growth of the coastal communities in the target countries through the development of a cross border eco-museum model and a common strategy focused on community tourism."
