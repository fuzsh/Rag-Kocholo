But what exactly is the Nobel Institution? How does it choose its winners? Has it ever made a mistake? And why does the prize hold such importance? With deft insight and sparkling wit, The Nobel Prize considers these questions while taking us on a fascinating tour of every aspect of Alfred Nobel’s grand legacy: its founder, its aura, its fields of award — literature, physics, chemistry, medicine, peace, and economics — and its laure¬ ates’ personalities and rivalries, as well as its biases, controversies, and blunders. We learn, for example, that a mistaken cure for >\n\ncancer was honored in 1926, and that, just a few years earlier, the renowned physicist Max Planck was overlooked for the 1912 physics prize in favor of a Swedish engineer who improved lighthouse illumination. Leo Tolstoy, James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Bertolt Brecht (among many others)\n\nnever won a Nobel. Nor did\n\nSigmund Freud, although as Feldman stingingly reveals, the Nobel did honor the treatment of mental illness by lobotomy and malaria inocula¬ tions. More generally, we discover how the Nobel Foundation’s shaky finances in the 1920s led it arbitrarily to exclude astrophysics and geophysics from the physics prizes for decades, while in recent years calls have multiplied for abolishing the economics award altogether. The Nobel has reshaped itself over time, as Feldman points out. For example, in a radical departure from Alfred Nobel’s conception, the peace prize has shifted from recognizing global disarmament to honoring social reform within a 10002945\n\nN\n\nThe\n\nNobel Prize\n\nThe Nobel Prize A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige\n\nBurton Feldman\n\nArcade Publishing • New York\n\nCopyright © 2000 by Burton Feldman All rights reserved.

Yet the opposite is true. I began this book because, to my surprise, no comprehensive and critical history of the prizes has yet been written in any language. I soon discovered why. To begin, the account must start with Alfred Nobel himself and his bequest, and then follow the five major prizes from 1901 to the present, as well as the prize in economics beginning in 1969. Additionally, such a book, intended for the general reader who knows something but not enough (someone like myself, for ex¬ ample), must also try to make clear the essence of the prizewinning work of an Einstein and the rest, while maintaining a sense of the relevant lines of scientific research, literary creativity, and peace issues — and cultural outbranchings — across a long century. But the Nobel Prize is more than the sum of its six separate fields: it is a mysterious incarnation of power and authority, an anointed ritual whose claims are accepted as part of the order of things. The Nobel Prize is at once a relic of the past (evidenced by the Swedish king who bestows the awards) and a self-admiring mir¬ ror of our democratized, scientized, secularized modern culture. After a century of existence, the Nobel has become a problematic part of modern history: it helps shape our perception of ourselves, for better or worse. Like monarchy, the Nobel Prize surrounds itself with mystery and extraordinary secretiveness. Indeed, the media have more easily breached the privacy of the British royal family than that of the Nobel institution. The prizes present themselves as if handed down from eternity. But as even a cursory inspection will reveal, the juries that pick the laureates have often shown bias, lapses of judgment, and bitter infighting. In the sciences, a number of quarrels, scandals, and even lawsuits have erupted over claims to priority or credit for collaborations honored by Nobels. And while widely admired, the science prizes have also been charged with swaying research goals\n\nX\n\nPreface\n\nand funding, however inadvertently, and more insidiously with cor¬ rupting scientific ambitions by the lure of Nobel fame. Such contro¬ versies, together with public dissent from several prizes, have been part of the Nobel history since its beginning. All prizes stir argument; the Nobel’s fame simply magnifies this hugely. But to report, as Mon¬ taigne said, “only what is canonical and reverend” is to omit half of any subject. This is the case here: the uncanonical and irreverend need notice if the Nobel institution and its awards are to be approached as the living, changing, and complex things they are. The very glory and stature of the Nobel Prizes prompt some sharp questions. Should such high endeavors of the human spirit as science, literature, and peace be treated as competitions, however exalted? Should these priceless efforts be paid the enormous, though “honorary,” price lavished on the winners? Would it matter if there never had been a Nobel Prize? Or if it vanished tomorrow? The problem is that the prizes are not merely awards and medals but are aspects of power woven into our lives: it was once and future Nobelists who built the nuclear bombs that still hang fate¬ fully over us; Nobelists now play an important part in public and military policy; the cachet of the Nobel Prizes to DNA research gives incalculable support to the possibility of genetic engineering; the Nobel Peace Prizes reverberate today in Israel and the Mideast, in Indonesia, in South Africa, in the civil rights movement in the U.S., and they played a role in the collapse of the USSR. It is also true that the Nobel Prizes show modern fame at its most dignified: the Nobel Prize pays honor to some of the highest human adventures in nature and matter, creativity and justice. Where else, moreover, can both the informed and the general public find a replacement for the authority and coherence, to whatever degree, the Nobel has come to possess? In a world and age as inwardly frac¬ tured as ours, this is a question not lightly dismissed. Such issues thread through this book, though taking them up directly at length would make the book unmanageably large. There is another reason, however, for not addressing them exhaustively. Before judging an institution as complex and formidable as this, one had better first know its history and the achievements it has honored. I have tried to make that history as clear and interesting and full as space permits. I am under no illusions about the problems involved in writing this book. The Nobel Prizes spread across quantum mechanics and\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nmolecular biology, literature in many genres and languages, peace awards from Teddy Roosevelt to Mother Teresa. To dare to survey and, at times, criticize prizes in six such intricate fields is to take one’s life in one’s hands. Specialists will notice imprecisions (or worse) despite every effort to be lucid and accurate. But when it comes to grasping the volatile, elusive, but potent matters of mod¬ ern fame and authority bodied forth in the Nobel Prize, and how they modify and are modified by ourselves and our times, special¬ ists are in the same leaky boat with the rest of us. I owe debts of all kinds to many people. To Tug Yourgrau, first, whose gift for happiness is outdone only by his gift for generosity — I thank him for launching this book in the right direc¬ tion. To Richard Seaver for believing in this book enough to want to publish it, showing that publishing is still an independent and courageous enterprise. To Webster Younce, my wizardly editor, for his wonderfully cheerful patience and benign surgeon’s eye for improving my writing. To my other editor, Ann Marlowe, this book is blessedly in debt to her extraordinary skill, learning, and passion¬ ate dedication. To Baruch Hochman for his buoying humanity and a couple of helpful miracles. To Katherine Williams for a cherished friendship; no one helped as selflessly with this book. To Allen Mandelbaum, Robert Richardson, and Maria Katzenbach for early and lasting encouragement. To Elizabeth Richardson for her staunch support and her skill as a photographer. To David Markson and Werner Dannhauser for going out of their way to help. To Annie Dillard for a kindness and Garry Trudeau for a favor that saved me much work. To Roald Hoffmann, a Nobelist in chemistry, who has helped me understand the poetry of chemistry, and the chemistry of poetry. To Professor Ze’ev Rosenkrantz of the Ein¬ stein Archives at Hebrew University in Jerusalem for granting me permission to use Einstein’s Nobel medal. To Tad Spencer and Tom Kite for help. To the Nobel Foundation for assistance, espe¬ cially to Fredrick Skog. To Professor Milton Wainwright of Sheffield University for cordial assistance about his original research. I am indebted as well to too many others to name. My debt to my wife would take a book longer than this one. I have had to settle for the dedication.\n\nThe\n\nNobel Prize\n\nJ\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nT\n\nhe Nobel Prizes are the most coveted and most potent awards of our time. Only “Nobel Prize winner” bestows instant recognition, lifelong celebrity, and unrivaled authority around the globe. In the media the prizes, along with wars and politics and major disasters, command front-page and prime-time treatment. The public (though not always the experts) accepts the selections as supremely authoritative about the most important scientific dis¬ coveries, the “best” writers, the most significant peace work. To people bewildered by arcane science or strange literary experi¬ ments or “peace” perplexities, the Nobel annually declares with Olympian assurance what is of surpassing importance. In fields that few have the time or ability to follow, the prizes convey a sense that coherence somehow does exist out there. To say “prizes” scarcely conveys the meaning of the Nobel awards. Some view these as only another scramble up the greasy pole of celebrity. But the Nobels are really knighthoods of a new and unusual kind, perhaps the only true aristocracy in our democratic, leveling age. Winning a war for Britain can make you a knight of that realm, but so can being a rich brewer or a winning jockey. To capture the Nobel’s exalted sort of nobility, far greater achievements are needed. And why have an aristocracy unless it is very exclusive? The Nobel group is surely that. From 1901 through 1999 the Nobel Prize has bestowed only 687 awards upon its designees: for peace 87, medicine 169, literature 96, physics 159, chemistry 132, and eco¬ nomics 44. (These figures do not include nineteen awards to peace organizations such as the Red Cross; in many years, no awards were given: see chronology.) Millions may dream of being selected, but few are called and fewer are chosen — in literature and peace an average of one per year, in the sciences an average of fewer than two. The Nobel confers its titles in a ceremony conducted by the king of Sweden. This ritual takes place always on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, its benefactor. Two thou¬ sand dignitaries, tuxedoed and gowned, gather in the Stockholm Concert Hall. At 4 p.m. the ceremony begins. As the Stockholm\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhilharmonic plays selections by Mozart and Mendelssohn (or Grieg and Sibelius), laureates from earlier years enter to applause. The king and queen take their places on the stage while the audience sings the Royal Hymn. Then appear the new laureates, also tuxedoed or gowned. They sit on the left of the stage in a fixed order of precedence, according to how Alfred Nobel listed their fields in his 1895 will — first physics, then chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace — with economics, an award established only in 1968, bring¬ ing up the rear. A great blue carpet covers the stage. At stage center, presiding over all, is an enlarged image of Alfred Nobel. The investiture is brief, its script unchanging. One by one the laureates are named, rise, and come forward. A Swedish aca¬ demician in the appropriate field delivers a brief laudatory descrip¬ tion of the achievement honored, addressed to “Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen.” To the laureate he then intones: “I now invite you to receive your prize from the hands of the king.” The king shakes hands and presents the laureate with a leather box that contains a gold medal bearing a replica of Alfred Nobel’s profile and engraved with the laureate’s name (the eco¬ nomics medal somewhat disdainfully inscribes the laureate’s name only on the rim), a diploma, and a certificate for the prize money, to be exchanged the next day for a check. The laureate steps back. Later, in the Stockholm city hall, the king hosts a banquet where the plates are gold-leafed and decorated with replicas of the Nobel medals; the meat is traditionally venison, provided by the king’s own hunters. Each laureate is toasted and returns the honor, speak¬ ing a few minutes in good spirits (Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Yiddish writer and 1978 Nobelist, said he liked writing Yiddish, that dying language, because he liked to write ghost stories). The next day, the laureates give a major address, in which the scientists explain their technical work and the writers and peace laureates speak as the spirit moves. The Israeli novelist S. Y. Agnon included all the animals in his thanks; the Italian dramatist Dario Fo handed out not the text of an address but a booklet of drawings. On following days there are celebrations in other Swedish towns. All the laureates stay up to a week at the Grand Hotel, as guests of Sweden. The media meanwhile fill us in on what the Nobel institution deco¬ rously omits. We learn that the 1995 economics laureate, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, had agreed to pay half his\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nNobel prize money to his ex-wife if he won within seven years of their divorce, specifically by 31 October 1995; he won in the sev¬ enth year on 10 October, when the announcements are made, and by that thin margin she got half the $600,000 award. All of Ein¬ stein’s Nobel money of 1921 went to his ex-wife by prior agree¬ ment. The Indian government agreed not to tax Mother Teresa’s 1979 Nobel Prize of $193,000, though she was based in Calcutta. But in 1923, when Fritz Pregl won in chemistry, the Austrian gov¬ ernment took two-thirds of his $30,000 award in taxes. In 1986 the U.S. passed a law taxing Nobel awards as ordinary income, thus cut¬ ting heavily into American winners’ receipts since then. The molecular biologist Max Delbruck (Nobel in Medicine, 1969) donated his prize money to Amnesty International. Georg von Bekesy (medicine, 1961) made the Nobel Foundation heir to his art estate worth almost half a million dollars, at least ten times what his actual prize had been worth. Delbruck also at first consid¬ ered rejecting the prize as pointless and distracting, as did the physicists Paul A. M. Dirac and Richard Feynman. They all even¬ tually accepted. Newspaper readers in 1946 learned that James B. Sumner, who shared that year’s chemistry Nobel, had lost his left arm at seventeen while hunting; although left-handed, he trained himself to do laboratory work right-handed. King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden, an ardent tennis player, was very curious about how Sumner managed to serve the ball during a game. In 1980 a reposi¬ tory of sperm from Nobel laureates was proposed for interested women. Three laureates were rumored to have enrolled and one even made his name public. But for lack of Nobelized sperm, the scheme dropped off. Such tidbits, gossip, and a few scandals swirl about the prize. Child molesters do not usually make national news, but they do if one is a Nobel Prize winner: in 1996 a laureate in medicine was convicted of molesting a child he had brought to the U.S. from an overseas research trip that won him the prize. But even the most deserved fame sometimes reaches only so far. A famous football star happened to attend a speech by William Faulkner, was puzzled by the hushed attention, and asked the person next to him why. “He won the Nobel Prize.” “Oh, the Mobil Prize,” said the footballer, impressed. The Nobel judges have also made mistakes. The wrong codis¬ coverer of insulin may have been honored in the Nobel Prize for Medicine of 1923. A mistaken cure for cancer was honored in 1926.\n\n■*V\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1952 the codiscoverer of streptomycin was omitted in the Nobel Prize for Medicine, although the evidence was on legal record and the Nobel jury could easily have obtained it. In 1912 Nils Dalen, a Swedish engineer, won the physics prize for improving lighthouse illumination, chosen over the great physicist Max Planck, among others. But generally the science prizes are greatly admired, by those who understand them, and by the rest precisely because they don’t. The literature awards, however, have sometimes raised gales of complaints, and several peace prizes have set off official repression or dissident protest. And a far more unsettling question haunts all the prizes: Are blue ribbons, no matter how exalted, relevant to intellectual or artistic or even peace work? If the Nobels disappeared tomorrow, would it make the slightest difference? And if prizes are indeed useful, is the Nobel system the way to decide them? How excellent is the Nobel’s own record? How much has it mattered? And whence these prizes that cause so much fuss? The Nobel Prizes’ celebrity is itself extraordinary. When the awards began, no one could have predicted it. Indeed, they have been forced to live up to their own unique success. This has not always been easy, but it has made the inner life of that institution far more interesting than one would have expected. Alfred Nobel himself provoked most of the interest at first. Quite unexpectedly, even to his family, the inventor of dynamite left his entire immense fortune to fund the prizes. That an inventor should bequeath prizes for science might be expected, but a prize for liter¬ ature was surprising, and a peace prize from a “merchant of death” was startling. Nobel died in 1896; five years later, the first Nobel Prizes were awarded. Only a few years after that, they began to spi¬ ral into ever-widening fame. What helped here was an extremely lucky accident in 1903. In 1901 and 1902, what mainly interested the public and laureates was Nobel’s glamorous name and the huge monies he bestowed. The literature and peace prizes drew most of the public attention, at least when one of the winners was a compatriot. But the first sci¬ ence prizes honored either already well-known discoveries, such as immunization against diphtheria and tetanus or Rontgen’s discov¬ ery of X-rays back in 1895, or work like the synthesis of purines or\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nelectromagnetic theory, intelligible only to a few specialists. Much interest was prompted by national competition, as if the prizes were an exalted kind of modern Olympic Games, begun in 1896. But interest of a different kind quickened dramatically in 1903 when the Nobel Physics Prize was shared by Henri Becquerel and Marie and Pierre Curie. Becquerel was a well-known professor in Paris, who had discovered radioactivity in uranium in 1896. But who were these Curies who had discovered two new radioactive elements? The French press took it up partly because this was the first Nobel Prize awarded to French scientists: national pride was grati¬ fied. But the reporters, and then the world press, also found a most satisfying rags-to-riches story, which some then described as a minor national scandal. The Curies turned out to be a devoted couple in early middle age (Pierre was forty-four, Marie thirty-six), shy, unworldly, utterly absorbed in their work. The reporters were captivated. This couple that had just won two-thirds of the munificent Nobel Prize, worth $40,000 in 1903 buying power, absentmindedly took meager meals when they remembered to eat. Marie, too busy with her science, had never bothered to learn to cook; Pierre never looked away from his experiments long enough to notice. She wore the plainest, most drab dresses. They lived in a little garret on the sixth floor, one hundred long steps up, so cold in winter that they had to sleep fully clothed. Both also had drab jobs, though both had doctorates. Pierre taught at a small and obscure technical institute, and Marie in a girls’ academy — a far cry from Becquerel at the grand Sorbonne. The reporters were especially taken with the shabbiness of the lab¬ oratory in which the great discoveries had taken place. It was a small decrepit workshop with greenhouse windows. There was no heat. The old walls and floor were damp, the roof dripped. The lab¬ oratory equipment was primitive and patched together — the ion¬ ization chamber was made from a jelly can, though Marie had luckily been able to borrow a good electrometer.1 She had begun her work asking if the rays given off by Becquerel’s uranium also came from other elements, and coined the word “radioactivity” to describe their common property. To test this, she begged and bor¬ rowed samples of every element she could from other scientists or obliging museums — and finally discovered that thorium was also radioactive. Working furiously, and meanwhile raising an infant\n\n3 6\n\nIntroduction\n\ndaughter, Marie and Pierre also found the new radioactive elements polonium and radium. To get more precise measurements and confirm Marie’s findings, the Curies bought as much pitchblende and chalcite (uranium ores that contain minute traces of other radioactive elements) as they could afford. It was cheap, and so many gunnysacks of the stuff arrived that they had to expand their workshop across the back court¬ yard into a little shack. This shack was in even worse shape than the workshop: the walls were crumbling, drafts whistled through window cracks, the ceiling threatened to tumble down. But it had an old table, a blackboard, and a treasure — a cast-iron stove. The eminent German chemist and later Nobelist Wilhelm Ostwald, who visited this “laboratory” to pay his respects, could hardly believe he was at the right address; he described it as part stable and part potato cellar.2 Marie set out to purify radium. She did all the work herself. She filled iron cauldrons with the black ore, set them boiling, stirred the noxious mess with a long iron rod for hours, and did the tedious dis¬ tillation procedure. The cauldrons were open and gave off nauseat¬ ing fumes, so she moved them outside into the open courtyard. With every heavy rain, she had to push the cauldrons hastily back into the shed. The dirt, dust, and plaster from the shack tainted the purity of the distillations, forcing her to start over. Meanwhile she began to feel constantly fatigued and ill — the effects of radiation, which were of course then unknown. Her fingertips were soon painfully scorched from touching the radium. But she and Pierre finally proved polonium and radium were new radioactive elements. Bits of scientific recognition came to them. In 1898 Marie won the Gegner Prize, worth almost what Pierre earned in a year. Pierre was made a member of the French Academy of Sci¬ ences after being rejected a few years earlier. Marie got the job in the girls’ academy. In 1903, Pierre was appointed to a chair at the Sorbonne, where Marie received her Ph.D. in physics, summa cum laude — the first woman in Europe ever to earn a doctorate in science (first place in the science examinations, second place in mathematics). In 1903, too, came the Nobel Prize. Theirs was a success story to delight any newspaper reader. The prize suddenly made them sev¬ enty thousand francs richer, almost twice their salaries for the next ten years. In 1891 Marie Sklodowska had been a penniless student just arrived from Poland to enroll in the Sorbonne. Now she and her\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nhusband were a pride of France’s scientific community — and the French press insisted she was now entirely French. While praising the Curies, the press could lament the stinginess with which France treated its scientific treasures. Le Figaro said: “We do not know our scientists, foreigners have to discover them for us.”3 The decrepit workshop, shack, and open courtyard were pictured and described over and over again, like icons. In fact, French science had not really stinted in funding the Curies’ work, there was just not enough to buy them a good laboratory. Marie Curie, more than Pierre, attracted attention. She was Pol¬ ish and thus slightly exotic; she was a mother who was raising a daughter despite heroic hours stirring the boiling cauldrons; she was selfless, wholly absorbed in her quest for knowledge. It was not difficult to portray her as a kind of saint of science. At thirty-six, she was also fairly young. Indeed, compared to prizewinners in other fields often in their sixties or even eighties, she was refreshingly young, and a new face. Radium with its mysterious rays and promise of curing any or all diseases helped swell the publicity. It was also recent enough news to compete with Marconi’s new “wireless telegraphy” for popular atten¬ tion.4 Humorous and serious journals took it up. Loie Fuller, the American “art” dancer, performed a popular “radium dance” in Paris. Marie welcomed the prestige from the prize. After Pierre’s death, she was appointed to the Sorbonne to teach Pierre’s courses — the first woman ever to teach at the Sorbonne. Other rich prizes came in, and she later made a successful tour of the United States to raise a large sum for her new laboratory. That Marie was a working scien¬ tist caused defenders of the home to berate her and feminists to defend her. One biographer, Susan Quinn, notes that this ambiva¬ lence about Marie likely was why four French scientists, including the great mathematician Poincare and the 1908 physics laureate Gabriel Lippmann, tried to persuade the Nobel jury to exclude her from the prize by claiming the discoveries were Pierre’s alone — which was untrue: Lippmann knew their joint work intimately.3 Like later laureates, the Curies found the celebrity at times infuri¬ ating, at times amusing. Marie’s great fame from the physics prize was doubled when she won the Nobel chemistry prize in 1911, specifi¬ cally for the discovery of radium and polonium. But her celebrity at that time almost brought her to disastrous public scandal — which in turn fed more publicity to the Nobel Prize.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ns\n\nBy then a widow — Pierre had died in a street accident in 1906 — she had an affair with the renowned French physicist Paul Langevin, whose wife was madly jealous. Some Paris newspapers blared the affair and the wife’s recriminations across their front pages. It was a media dream. Love letters were stolen, Langevin fought a duel with a journalist, the wife threatened Marie’s life. The scandal might have cost Marie her second Nobel. But other newspapers rebuked the sensationmongers, Langevin reconciled with his wife, the threat of scandal faded. Marie kept a dignified silence and slipped away to Stockholm to collect her second prize. Marie Curie thus became the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in both of its familiar aspects: honored for the importance of her work, but also instantly transformed into a worldwide celebrity. Because of her, newspapers around the globe changed their way of reporting the Nobel Prize, generating endless publicity, and thereby finally changing the meaning of the awards. We are by now used to idoliz¬ ing accounts of Einstein. But soon after 1903, the press could be as extravagant about the Curies as later about Einstein. One paper hailed their study of radioactivity with these words: “Voila, perpet¬ ual motion, the eternal sun, the supreme inexhaustible force have been at last found through the geniuses of Monsieur and Madame Curie, whose Nobel Prize fits them like a glove.”6 The Curie story also demonstrated that the Nobel Prizes had been born at a very lucky time, when both science and literature were turning “modern” and thus increasingly incomprehensible to the public, and also when the media began its own great expansion and influence. Journalists began to feature the personalities behind the prize. Interviewers poked into the laureates’ private lives, charms and foibles, work habits, and opinions on all subjects, however unre¬ lated to their special knowledge. This remains as true today. Reporters, expectedly enough, also saw what they chose to see. They habitually described Marie Curie as saintly and selfless, though her close friends saw her as refusing joy in life. “The soul of a herring,” said Einstein, who admired her, sadly. She always wore a widow’s black. From the latest lottery winner to yesterday’s pop star, ephemeral celebrity (Andy Warhol’s “everyone is famous for fifteen minutes”) now seems a fact of life. But the fame of a Nobel Prize is one of the\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nscarcest and therefore most valuable, not only because great talent is rare, but in this race a miss is as good as a mile. Though up to three can share a single prize, the runners-up — however deserving, how¬ ever possessed of true greatness — never appear on any Nobel list. The Nobel Prize does not teach the noble wisdom that the work is its own reward, but the harsher lesson that many may be truly wor¬ thy but very few will be chosen, and sometimes not even the most deserving. In a single century, the unchosen “many” have multiplied many times over. In 1901 there were about a thousand active physicists in the world.7 Today there may be as many as 200,000. So too with chemists and medical researchers. Judging by the vast increase in published matter, the number of poets and fiction writers in the world is immensely greater than in the nineteenth century, too large to count. As the pool of competitors increases, the Nobel Prize obviously becomes more difficult to win, but thus also more desir¬ able as the only distinction by which one can rise above nearly all others. The pre-Nobel nineteenth century perpetuated ancient meth¬ ods for honoring scholars and artists. Princes gave out laurels, riches, titles, political rank. The pianist Franz Liszt, in his sensa¬ tional virtuoso days of the 1840s, was regularly laden with ceremo¬ nial swords, medals, monetary tributes, trophies, keys to cities, not to mention a title of nobility. Scientists and artists also received once-in-a-lifetime celebrations. In 1890 the pioneering organic chemist August Kekule von Stradonitz was grandly feted in Berlin on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his famous discovery of the ben¬ zene ring structure. In 1892 a more stupendous international jubilee was held for the great bacteriologist Pasteur on his seventi¬ eth birthday. Only a few years later, this was outdone by an even more spectacular commemoration for the chemist Marcellin Berthelot at which the president of the French Republic presented a flattering medal.M Kekule and Pasteur died too soon for a Nobel Prize; Berthelot lived long enough, but never won. Compared to these, the Nobel Prize ceremony is a modest and sober affair. Extravaganzas no longer suit science or literature. In the mid-1800s, scientists had often been gentlemen-amateurs, lone entrepreneurs (Alfred Nobel is a prime example), or government employees such as that prince of mathematicians Karl Gauss. Some were professors, but usually suffered low academic and social status.\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt Yale the science students and faculty were not allowed to sit with regular students in chapel.9 But toward the end of the nineteenth century, science became of crucial value to commerce, government, and the military. German and British industries set up research labo¬ ratories. Scientists entered universities as professors with high standing and began to set up that international network we now call “science.” At the same time, literary scholars started becoming pro¬ fessors and launched societies and journals, turning themselves into professionals quite as respectable as lawyers, ministers, or doctors. The Nobel Prize is the child of all this. It is based in Swedish aca¬ demic institutions, plus a Norwegian committee for the peace prize. Eminent professors and scholars dominate the Nobel committees. But the Nobel ceremony is also and intrinsically a royal cere¬ mony. The king’s presence is symbolically indispensable. In 1901, when the first Nobel Prizes were conferred, many European nations still had monarchs. After World War I, the Swedish ruler kept his throne, if without real power, and his small country on the nothern periphery played a small part in a world dominated by the Great Powers. In the modern world, however, a king is a unique thing, and for Nobel purposes an item of incalculable iconic value. The courtly ceremony over which today’s King Carl XVI Gustav presides is, after all, a vestige of the vanished aristocratic past when princes rewarded artists or political favorites. The Nobel rite is per¬ formed for a modernity nostalgic for such older and vanishing glo¬ ries. The king and queen, the gold medals stamped with Alfred Nobel’s profile and his bas-relief dominating the dais, the royal blue carpet, the atmosphere of ancient nobility: all helps magically trans¬ form laboratory experiments and poems into world-commanding achievements, and for a moment makes its honored individuals imaginably heroic. Nothing is more modern than how the Nobel Prizes marry such old-fashioned individual glory with the flatlands of democratic life — esoteric knowledge with popular opinion. As the works hon¬ ored in science and, latterly, economics have grown increasingly remote and arcane to the general public, the Nobels have become the most important bridge between high intellectual achievement and the marketplace. Where comprehension fails, celebrity fills in. The most dramatic novelty, of course, was the sizable fortunes the Nobel Prizes lavished on the laureates. By one estimate, the\n\n/ ntroduction\n\n11\n\nFrench Academy of Sciences was disbursing a total of about 100,000 francs (approximately $20,000) per year from 1901 to 1910. But in 1901 each of the five Nobel Prizes was worth about 210,000 francs or $40,000.10 The Nobels have remained the benchmark in prize money, though their value has gone up and down through the century along with inflations and recessions (see Appendix A). The sudden wealth raining on obscure scholars and impoverished artists also became one of the strongest arguments for the Nobels’ integrity and authority. As early-Nobel historian Elisabeth Craw¬ ford notes, the public was likely to think that only truly worthy achievements could command prizes worth so much money.11 The Nobel here stands as ancestor and prototype to the huge publicity generated by the MacArthur Foundation’s so-called genius awards: why would anyone give five straight years of munificent support to anyone other than a “genius”? The Nobel has its rivals, but none combines the wealth and pres¬ tige of the prize, the range of its subjects, and its century-long record. To be sure, the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, established by a wealthy Briton in 1972, is richer — precisely because its founder decreed that it should always be worth more than the Nobel Prize of the same year: in 1998, for example, the Templeton Prize was worth $1.24 million as against $978,000 per Nobel Prize. Unlike the Nobel, most awards specialize either in sci¬ ence or in the arts, with political honors excluded altogether. The (British) Royal Society is restricted to science. The Pulitzer Prize confines itself to journalism and a few of the arts; the Prix Goncourt, like the British Booker Prize (worth $31,500 in 1995), to literature. No award has the aura of the Nobel in literature or peace, though the Royal Society medals in science or the Fields Medals in mathe¬ matics are in some ways as prestigious or more among scientists than the Nobels — and harder to win, one might add. The Fields Medal, for example, is awarded only every four years, by the Inter¬ national Mathematical Union. Other prizes have been created as alternatives to the Nobel.12 The Wolf Prize, established in Israel in 1978, gives annual winners $100,000 each in physics, chemistry, medicine, mathematics, and the arts. Some awards, such as the Balzan Prize, are specifically set up for fields like sociology or political science for which no Nobel exists. Some specify no field, as with the Right Uivelihood Award, founded in 1980. The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences, which\n\n12\n\nIntroduction \\S\n\nawards the Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, and economics, even administers an alternative to itself: the Schock Prize in Philosophy, which honors philosophy, mathematics, music, and fine arts. This award too is bestowed by the king of Sweden; in 1994 the American logician Willard van Orman Quine was the first recipient. But new or old, the Nobel Prize still outranges them all. It was the first important regular prize to include not only the arts and sci¬ ences but politics in the form of “peace.” It was an international prize. “No consideration whatsoever shall be given to the national¬ ity of the candidates,” commanded Alfred Nobel’s will. Earlier lit¬ erary awards had usually restricted eligibility to citizens of their nations, though the eminent scientific awards were open to foreign¬ ers. The Nobel’s internationalism allowed it to include achieve¬ ments anywhere in the world, to reap the harvest of all nations. Inevitably, this appeal to international harmony — like the Olympics — has roused fierce national rivalries. Science may speak a transnational language, but each year, as the new Nobels are announced, national scorecards and rivalries are anxiously scruti¬ nized. When the U.S. swept the prizes in all fields in 1976, the New York Times triumphantly headlined the event on its front page. When, in 1984, the European experimental physicists at the CERN laboratory outraced the U.S. to find the W and Z bosons, American editorialists lamented and warned of falling behind. The unsuc¬ cessful campaign to build the Superconducting Super Collider — at six billion dollars — involved hopes to regain the lead from the Europeans. Statistics are constantly paraded. Americans won 64% of all medicine Nobels in 1983-93, up from 1963-73, when the U.S. won only 50% of the medicine awards. In 1963-73 Americans took 55% of all prizes, but in 1983-93 only 48%, though the chemistry prizes rose from 33% to 60%. That must be progress, since science makes the technology which makes the “future.” So far, it seems, the country is safe. Uuckily for Nobel celebrity, modern science became an interna¬ tional enterprise around 1900. Crawford describes a period of high international cooperation from the 1880s to 1914, followed by dis¬ ruption from the First War through the Second War, and then coop¬ eration again since 1945.13 And since science speaks a language common to all nations, this helps explain why the Nobel record in the sciences has been so good — and the Nobel in literature not so good. Gauging the worth of writing requires knowing a particular\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nlanguage most fluently and intimately. But the world has scores of languages, though one would not guess this from the few major European languages that have taken almost all the prizes. The peace prizes, of course, cover every part of the globe: human con¬ flict is the same everywhere, only worse. Two other factors helped boost the Nobel to unmatched renown. Nobels will contained a “most recent'1 clause, requiring awards to go only to the latest scientific discovery, invention, or improvement, or to literary works appearing during the “preceding year.” This could clearly have become an unworkable requirement, and it was relaxed when the Nobel Statutes were drawn up in 1900. But this carried a danger. As mordantly stated by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (Nobel in Chemistry, 1903, and a force on the first science commit¬ tees), the “worst thing would be for the prizes to develop into old-age pensions.”14 The literature prizes have come close. Nonetheless, the “recent” requirement helped make the Nobel Prize an annual source of fresh and exciting news. The discovery of radium or the human genetic code or the transistor — or the Israeli/PLO accord — is newsworthy by any standard. Each fall, the public may hope to learn about astonishing breakthroughs, inge¬ nious new techniques, a bold poet or peacemaker. Such novelty was soon expected in all the prize categories: “discoveries awarded the prize were expected to involve surprises, startling effects, leaps into the unknown.”15 But the literature judges, for the first half century or so, actually fought off such excitement by rejecting almost all “provocative” writers” (Ibsen, Joyce, D. H. Lawrence). Of course, startling novelties are rare. No matter. “Amazing” feats in sports also happen far between, yet all fans keep hoping and believing. On the other side, annual awards can quickly wear out the supply of quality goods. The science prizes have an advantage here, since science progresses by refuting or refining its past successes. If par¬ ticle physics stalls, there is still superconductivity, astrophysics, superstrings, and specialties yet aborning. Peace laureates can always be found, since no one has any clear idea how to delimit that category. The Wright brothers were urged as peace laureates in 1909, Kaiser Wilhelm in 1910, Lindbergh after his solo trans-Atlantic flight, the American socialist Eugene Debs in 1924, Baron Pierre de Coubertin who founded the modern Olympic Games in 1896, several of the popes, Stalin’s henchman Maxim\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nLitvinov in 1933. In 1977, U.S. congressman Les Aspin nominated Jerry Lewis for the Nobel Peace Prize for his muscular dystrophy fund-raising on TV; the winner that year was Amnesty Interna¬ tional. Even Hitler! At least, in 1934 the New York Times devoted an entire page, headlined Hitler Nominated for Nobel Prize, to a long essay by Hamilton Fish Armstrong, then editor of the eminent journal Foreign Affairs. His point was that because Hitler had not invaded Austria in 1934 as he threatened, this “helped save the world, in 1934 at any rate, from war.” Armstrong seems to have been writing with heavy-handed irony. But that the sober Times gave it so much space showed that the Nobel Prizes drew public attention. The literature prizes are different. “Great” writers alone should win, but how to determine that? The Nobel abhors a vacuum: each year, a slot opens and another writer must be found to fill it. Nomi¬ nees are of course never lacking. Margaret Mitchell was nominated for Gone with the Wind (and rejected). Charlie Chaplin was nomi¬ nated in 1952 by the prominent Swedish literary critic Olof Lagercrantz, on the grounds that Chaplin was a major “screen author” because he wrote the scripts he acted in his films. Although Chaplin was rejected as primarily an actor rather than a playwright, the 1997 Nobel award went to the Italian Dario Fo, a famous comedian whose playwrighting, like Chaplin’s, mainly consists of scripts for his own performances. Many warn that the economics prize may soon, if not already, face a shortage of worthy candidates. Certainly from Einstein’s prize — in 1922 for the preceding year — the Nobel’s prestige crucially rests on the prestige of its science prizes. Nuclear physics or transfer RNA may puzzle most people, but the wonder and dread inspired by the hydrogen bomb or cloning is inescapably real and obvious. Everyone grasps that these sciences embody vast and revolutionary might of uncertain kind. The violent power crouching in every stick of Mr. Nobel’s dyna¬ mite made this point quite clear earlier. Another reason is that the science juries have long chosen far more impressive laureates than have the literary judges. Planck, Rutherford, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauling, Crick and Watson, Feynman — a steady procession of greatness or the nearest\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nequivalent. Would the Nobel have much of an aura or any at all without those names? The literature prizes, after fifty years of ignoring the likes of Leo Tolstoy, Bertolt Brecht, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf, can never catch up with the prestige of the science lists. The prizes in literature, peace, and economics are not unlike pale fires, shining more brightly in the reflected light of Einstein and company.\n\nThe Nobel Theater of Fame When the Nobel Prize is awarded, no “short list” of top candidates is ever announced. The decision is final. Glaring mistakes or omis¬ sions have been made, but no award is ever reversed or altered, even when disputes inside the committees occasionally erupt into public sight.16 The effect is of magisterial authority and finality. The Bench is not to be approached. The decisions are rendered as if from eter¬ nity and for eternity. Those honored are forever of the Elect. Aes¬ thetically, this is as it should be. Any sign of inner dissension spilling into public squabbling could bring the whole lofty drama abruptly down to earth. One should never look behind the scenes of any good theater. If one must have prizes for science and art, which is entirely debatable, they should come as from on high. The Nobel Foundation has always been shrewd about this. The invisibility of the machinery heightens the majesty of the prizes. \"Phis machinery is so self-effacing that the decisions seem almost to issue not from mere Stockholm but from some timeless Realm of Objective Judgment. The Nobel Foundation has culti¬ vated a very disciplined anonymity, though selecting the laureates is a process that involves hundreds of nominators and evaluators from around the world. The small army of Swedish and Norwegian evaluators who filter this information are sworn to secrecy and have remained extraordi¬ narily tight-lipped for almost a century, and so too the foreign col¬ leagues in whom they doubtless confide. Leaks are extremely rare, and most apt to happen in that highly volatile category called, with unintentional irony, peace. A flagrant breach of Nobel secretiveness came when the 1994 peace committee awarded a share of the prize to the PLO leader Yasir Arafat. A committee member publicly\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\ndenounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned. Two members publicly resigned when the peace prize was awarded to Henry Kissinger and Le Due Tho in 1973 for a cease-fire in the Vietnam War. The most shocking breach of Nobel secrecy has come from out¬ side. In 1995 the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, called the most influential in Sweden, printed seven articles charging the Nobel Prize in Medicine with corruption. Dagens Nyheter claimed that Fidia, an Italian pharmaceutical firm, had paid nine million dollars to the medicine judges to make Rita Levi-Montalcini a lau¬ reate: Fidia had funded her research since 1979 on nerve growth factors, and expected great profits if their researcher was a prizewinner. In fact she shared the prize in 1986. A Nobel commit¬ tee member threatened to sue the newspaper. After two weeks of intense protests, Dagens Nyheter printed an editorial retraction, stat¬ ing that bribery had not taken place. Informed sources speculate that the newspaper was trying to boost circulation.17 In Nobel committees as elsewhere, consensus is often hard to reach, much less unanimity. Friction often runs high, and certain committee members operate as power brokers, able to speed up a prize or delay one, sometimes for decades. So can powerful nomina¬ tors: the great physicist Niels Bohr is reported to have personally stalled the physics prize to Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga for almost fifteen years. The identities of the all-important nominators are not publicly disclosed, nor of candidates. The science archives fifty years or older have been opened to outsiders,18 but it may be a long time before anything very accurate is known about why Gandhi never won the peace prize, or why William Golding did win the literature prize. Still, it can come as a slight shock to peer behind the impassively majestic facade of the Nobel Foundation and catch sight of the pro¬ saic Scandinavian professors who actually oil and run the grand machine. The Nobel Foundation is a fair-sized industry. In 1994 the total expenditures on committees, staff, nominators, consultants, and others ran to six million dollars. The selection process is firmly institutional. The key work is done by committees usually of five or six members each, chosen, for literature, by the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm; for medicine, by the Karolinska Institute (Caroline Institute) in Stockholm; for physics, chemistry, and eco-\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nnomics, by the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm; for peace, by the Norwegian Storting (parliament). These committees invite nominations from an international list of academics, eminent figures, and all former laureates. The Nobel science committees also seek nominations from directors of important laboratories or journals, and the literature committee from some writers. No candi¬ date can be self-nominated, though many try it. Nominations, due before 1 February, are sifted from a few hun¬ dred to about thirty. By summer, the committee elects its winner and sends the choice to the larger groups of the academies involved — in physics, for example, to all the physicists in the Academy of Sciences, then to the entire academy. The full group can overrule the commit¬ tee recommendation and has done so. The final sessions can get rough: “We have finished murdering each other’s candidates,” one scientific member gleefully put it in the early years.19 The literature decisions are perhaps more contentious, but the setting is more elegant. After the committee has made its nomina¬ tion, the eighteen members of the Swedish Academy meet to vote around an antique table.20 Watched over by a bust of King Gustav III, founder of the Swedish Academy, they drop their ballots into a small silver pitcher. Gustav III ruled from 1771 to 1792, when he was assassinated at a masked ball — Sweden was a more romantic place back then. This stately voting is in keeping with the Swedish Academy’s imitation of the brocaded airs of its model and ancestor, the Academie Frangaise. Three members of the Swedish Academy resigned over the Rushdie affair, but have not had their resigna¬ tions accepted, as appointment is for life. These three have not been attending meetings, but their votes still count if they exercise the right. In 1997 they apparently did not, and barely two-thirds of the members decided on the controversial Dario Fo that year. The good news is telephoned to the laureate, to forestall leaks to the media. How well the hushed process works can be seen by how the world’s experts usually guess wrong. For example, in 1995 the Norwegian media, which must be thought in the best position to hear leaks about the peace prize bestowed by the Norwegian peace committee, came up with these leading candidates: the Indonesian Catholic bishop Belo, the Kurdish leader Leyla Zana, former presi¬ dent Jimmy Garter, Mexican bishop Samuel Ruiz, Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalyov, a Chinese dissident, negotiators for\n\n18\n\n/ ntroduction\n\npeace in Northern Ireland, and Doctors without Borders. In fact, the prize was shared by the British physicist-peace activist Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash organization to control nuclear arms.\n\nNobel Monumentalism The Nobel Foundation itself deserves a drama award for the way it glorifies its laureates. Its monumentalizing process begins with the citation that focuses the spotlight on the laureate’s achievements alone — rarely are any colleagues, predecessors, or helpers men¬ tioned. In this, the Nobel sanctions the kind of history that consists of great deeds and high majesty, with the rest of ordinary life ignored. It is true that writers do their work alone. But the Nobels in physics, chemistry, and medicine can leave an unreal and romanti¬ cized impression of science.21 No one can deny the moment of high individual triumph — Rontgen finding X-rays, or Max Planck dis¬ covering the quantum concept in 1900, so excited that he couldn’t resist telling his young son that he had done something of which even Newton would be proud. But if science requires great talent, it also demands a vast collective effort. For a scientist, winning the prize requires working for years with stimulating colleagues and collaborators, and having an incessant exchange of ideas and sug¬ gestions in conferences, seminars, and hallways; scientists are doubtless the best-traveled of all scholars. The Nobel Prize drama¬ tizes only the moment of success, not the perplexity and blunders, tips and hints, that are really the scientist’s daily bread. Nor would one guess from the prizes how relentlessly competitive science is. The difference beween winning a Nobel and not can be a hairline. And the accidental makeup and views of prize committees can often be a decisive factor. As Bertolt Brecht (never a Nobelist) once put it: Alexander the Great conquered the world. What? By himself? Hadn’t he even a cook along? The effect left by the Nobel awards is often like that, the lone heroic explorer on the stage magnified by the limelight, blocking out all else. The Nobel perpetuates the popular view of the lonely genius: Shakespeare, Mozart, Newton, Einstein do not abide our question.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nPrecisely because of this, the molecular biologist Max Delbrtick was tempted to reject his 1969 prize. He relented, but later spoke blunt words about the Nobel Prize: uBy some random selection pro¬ cedure, you pick out a person and you make him an object of a per¬ sonality cult. After all, what does it amount to?”22 Maria Goeppert Mayer must also have asked herself what it amounted to when she shared the 1963 physics prize, and read in a San Diego newspaper — she was then teaching there — the headline: S.D. MOTHER WINS Nobel Prize.\n\nResponding to the Prize During their first ten years, 1901-10, the Nobel Prizes were announced and awarded in Stockholm on the same day, 10 Decem¬ ber. That meant the new laureates had to be secretly notified and then travel to Stockholm on a pretext or incognito. This proved hopelessly impractical and bothersome. And why such secrecy any¬ way? The more publicity, after all, the better. Since then, the new Nobel Prizes have been announced each year in the fall. The usual practice now is that the medicine winners are named on 10 October. On successive days thereafter come the economics award, then physics and chemistry, then literature. The peace prize is usually announced last. The responses follow a well-defined pattern. The new laureates typically declare themselves gratified, astounded, and humbled. The media translate the science awards into digestible terms for the lay audience. In science, colleagues almost always commend the selection for its new benefit to mankind or its deeper understanding of fundamental problems. Very few ever disagree with the choices, at least in public. The literary and political (i.e., peace) communities do not always welcome their new laureates with a choir of approval. A member of the Swedish Academy once publicly resigned when William Gold¬ ing won the literature Nobel. Literary laureates of small countries can become national heroes overnight by winning the prize; they can equally become targets of ideological or religious contempt. The Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz (1988) has been continu¬ ously denounced for his “secularizing” work and status, and in 1994 was stabbed by a religious militant.\n\nx\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe peace prizes, since they involve political matters, naturally cause the most quarrels. Alfred Nobel set up the award to encour¬ age “fraternity among nations . . . abolition or reduction of standing armies, or promotion of peace congresses.” Political disputes regu¬ larly break out, as with the Soviet government’s fury at Sakharov’s peace award, or China’s at the prize to the Dalai Lama for intimat¬ ing that Tibet should regain its freedom from China. Mother Teresa was even accused of pandering to the rich and exploiting the sick for religious purposes. In any case, a rude celebrity springs on every laureate. The media treat the new laureates like universal experts on almost any¬ thing under the sun: scientists are asked to comment on crime or poverty or religion, writers on foreign policy, peace laureates on the arts. In 1988 President Mitterand of France called a conference of laureates to “create an emergency committee with moral authority in crises around the world.” Laureates reported a “pleasant exchange of ideas.”23 Most bow out as quickly as possible, but a few move on to second careers as publicists for favorite causes. Linus Pauling (chemistry, 1954) even won a second Nobel, the peace prize in 1962, for his protests against H-bomb testing. Of course, in the wake of the prize, other rewards stream in. Sci¬ ence laureates soon find their discoveries in up-to-date textbooks, funding gravitates to them, they are invited to endless congresses, conferences, advisory posts, committees, foundations, and insti¬ tutes. The new literary laureates enjoy a certain rise in sales and renown — at least until the next year and the next laureate. But such prestige brings its perils. The great bacteriologist Robert Koch, after winning the 1905 prize in medicine, was made an “Excellenz.” But then, astounding the “entire German nation to whom he appeared almost a god,” he suddenly divorced his wife and married a young actress. He was much reviled; it may even have contributed to his early death.24 Willy-nilly, all winners have the label “Nobelist” affixed to their names in life and in death. In his Humboldt's Gift Saul Bellow, him¬ self a Nobelist in 1976, portrayed a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who laments that his very obituary will become only another adver¬ tisement for that prize: “Pulitzer Prize-Winner Dies.” Obituaries of Nobel laureates invariably make winning the prize the major event of that person’s life.\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nChewing Over the Bones Nobel Prize winners are proudly and greedily claimed by their nations, universities, hometowns, political causes, professional organizations, and any other interested parties. Nations are of course eager to claim winners, but this can often be confusing. Einstein was born in Germany but left there at six¬ teen and moved to Switzerland. He attended the Swiss scientific university, the ETH (Federal Institute of Technology, something like MIT or CalTech), and became a Swiss citizen. In 1914 he joined the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. When he won the physics prize for 1921, what nationality was he? In fact, Swiss: that was his legal citizenship. Switzerland was where he grew up from age sixteen, was educated through his doctorate, worked for several years in the Swiss patent office and began teach¬ ing —- and where he made his first great discoveries, including the one the Nobel honored. He kept lifelong Swiss citizenship even after taking U.S. citizenship. But with his Nobel Prize, Einstein’s prestige was so great that the Germans were anxious to claim him as one of their own. They therefore declared that any member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, by German law, had to be considered a Ger¬ man. The Swiss authorities thought otherwise. The Nobel Founda¬ tion finessed the problem by ignoring both the Swiss and the Germans; the Swedish ambassador to Germany presented the Nobel medal directly to Einstein in his home in Berlin. Nonetheless, Ein¬ stein is almost always described as German or German-American. Like all legends, the image of Einstein as German — thus a counter to the hateful face of Nazism — is destined to remain in the books. National gamesmanship and honest confusion are involved here. Many laureates were refugees or emigres at some point in their careers. The German physicist Max Born, who fled Hitler to Britain, is listed in the official Nobel history as British: he was indeed teach¬ ing in Edinburgh in 1954, the year he was awarded a long-delayed prize for work done almost thirty years before in Germany. T. S. Eliot was born in Saint Louis, Missouri, but moved to England before World War I, and became a British citizen in 1927 at age thirtyfive. His greatest poetry was written in Britain, and the Nobel Prize rightly lists him as British. Mother Teresa was born in Albania; she served as a young nun in Calcutta and became an Indian citizen; by any other criterion, she is “global.” Reference works call her Indian.\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe prize list makes little sense unless one knows not simply where but when the Nobel-winning work was done. Otherwise, topsy-turvy errors can result. One might conclude that the Ameri¬ can novelist Pearl Buck (Nobel, 1938) was older and more famous than T. S. Eliot or Ernest Hemingway, since she became a laureate well before Eliot (1948) and Hemingway (1954). In fact, both were world-famous before she even began publishing. The Nobel that Max Born won in physics in 1954 seems to make him young enough to have been the student of Werner Heisenberg, who won the prize back in 1932. In fact Born was one of Heisenberg’s teachers, a gen¬ eration older, and an important collaborator on the theory that won Heisenberg his prize. The American biochemist Peyton Rous became a laureate in 1966 — for research done in 1911. Schools claim any piece of a laureate they can. If the laureate studied there, taught there, did some research there, or was some¬ how affiliated, plaques or bronze scrolls or even oil portraits are apt to be in sight. Schools take Nobel glory very seriously, since a school’s reputation can rise or fail thereby. The Business School of the University of Chicago advertises itself as having “more Nobel Prize winners than any other school.” In the United States, the Nobelists in science come mainly from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Chicago, MIT, CalTech, and Berkeley. The Bronx High School of Science in 1950 graduated two classmates who later shared the Nobel in physics — Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow — while another graduate is the physics laureate Ueon Cooper. The laureate’s hometown, whether Paris or Sauk Centre, Min¬ nesota (Sinclair Uewis’s birthplace), seizes the opportunity as well, commemorating its illustrious offspring by a bust or museum or street name. Tourist organizations remind all visitors that Nobelist X was born or lived or studied or taught or simply liked to vacation here. Books appear celebrating the Jews or Germans or British or Italians who have won Nobels. But Stockholm itself has no plaques or monuments to Alfred Nobel.\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly Whether all these laureled “discoveries, inventions, and improve¬ ments” have proved themselves contributions “most materially of benefit to mankind” — to quote Alfred Nobel — remains an\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nentirely open question. Science’s contributions to war, pollution, social blight, and other problems have prompted a decline in the socalled religion of science. Literature’s benefit to the world now often seems confined to a few rather than the multitude: film became by far the dominant popular art in the twentieth century. As for peace, little needs to be said about civilization’s success in reining back war and armies. The Nobel’s own influence — whether beneficial or corrupting to science, literature, and peace — is also entirely unsettled. But no one could ever have accused Alfred Nobel of being unduly optimistic about any of this. It is to that unusual man we now turn.\n\n■N\n\nJ\n\n'l\n\n*»\n\nThe Founding Father\n\nA\n\nlfred Nobel’s life is a spectacular example of the new type that emerged in the nineteenth century, the capitalist whose energy, ambition, and ingenuity accepted no limits. Nobel invented a motto for himself: “My home is my work and my work is everywhere.” He had no real homeland during his life. This famous Swede left Sweden at age nine and, for the rest of his life, returned only for very brief stays. Nor did he bother to maintain citizenship there. His brothers, too, were rootless, ever ready to migrate as they followed opportunities for profit. Alfred made his millions in the worldwide explosives industry. His father made his fortune, and lost it, manufacturing munitions for the Russian government. Alfred’s two older brothers pioneered in the modern oil industry. Called the Russian Rockefellers, they opened up Russia’s immense Baku oil fields, built a global enterprise, and became wealthier than Alfred. What needs saying first about Alfred Nobel is that he was a singu¬ larly complicated man. He spoke Swedish, German, English, French, Russian, and Italian fluently, wrote plays and poems in En¬ glish, and read far more widely in several languages than most informed people, to say nothing of millionaire inventors. In its time, his dynamite was the most destructive but also constructive weapon ever invented — indeed, one of the great inventions of the century. He gave a fortune to set up a peace prize. But the same man who created that award to alleviate human suffering had a mor¬ dant streak. He liked telling friends about his plan to set up a lavish mansion in Paris where prospective suicides could die amid luxury, rather than drown in the cold, filthy Seine. “A first-class orchestra” would play only “the most beautiful music.”1\n\n26\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nInventor Becomes Millionaire Alfred Nobel was born in 1833 in Stockholm^ the third of four sons. The family traced itself back to peasants from a small town named Nobbelov, whence the name. But a seventeenth-century ancestor married into the family of an Uppsala University professor named Rudbeck, one of Sweden’s famous early scientists, a researcher into the circulatory system. If the Nobels thereafter were poor, they remained educated. Alfred’s grandfather was an army surgeon. His father, Immanuel (born 1800), went to a technical school and became an inventor just as Sweden began to industrialize. By his middle twenties, Immanuel Nobel had patented a planing machine, a press with ten rollers, and a rotary machine. But nothing worked out. The year Alfred was born, a fire put the father into bankruptcy. He experimented with India rubber for surgical uses, and invented a barge; it sank. He invented a floating backpack for soldiers; the army was not interested. Since 1800 there had been many schemes to cut a canal across the Isthmus of Suez. Another surfaced in the 1830s, and this one indirectly gave birth to the invention of dynamite and Alfred Nobel’s fortune. Gunpowder was then the only means of blasting out the millions of tons of earth that had to be removed. But it was highly ineffective. This set Immanuel — who, like his sons, always thought big — to thinking about explosives. He taught himself a little chemistry and built a workshop, and in 1837 succeeded in making some chemicals explode. But they also blew up the work¬ shop and alarmed the neighbors, and the authorities forbade further work. Heavily in debt, he left his family in Sweden and went off to Russia to begin again. This was a common move for a Swede at that time. Through the seventeenth century, Sweden and Russia had been rivals as the two great powers in the north of Europe (the wars continued to the early 1800s, when Russia seized Finland from Sweden). When Peter the Great built the fortress in Saint Petersburg, his prize new city, he faced the cannon toward Sweden. The famous equestrian statue of the Bronze Horseman in Saint Petersburg grinds a snake, symboliz¬ ing Sweden, under its hooves. But Russia lagged behind Sweden industrially and technically, and foreign experts were needed. One was John Paul Jones, who served Catherine the Great as Kontradmiral Pavel Ivanovich Jones.2\n\nThe Founding Father\n\n27\n\nIn Finland and then Russia, Immanuel kept up his explosives work, successfully inventing an underwater mine. With Russian military backing, he opened a factory in Saint Petersburg to pro¬ duce mines, cannon shells, mortars, and machinery to make wheels. This “Michelin of his time,” as someone called him, expanded into steam engines, iron piping, steam hammers weighing several tons, even window sashes and central heating systems for houses; his own house had the first in Russia. The factory was called Colonel Ogarev’s and Mr. Nobel’s Chartered Mechanical Wheel Factory and Pig Iron Foundry. Ogarev had earlier hired the American engi¬ neer George Washington Whistler — the painter’s father — to build Russia’s first important railroad. In 1842 Immanuel was prosperous enough to bring his family to Saint Petersburg. In Sweden, Alfred had attended school only a year, but was privately tutored. He was quick at languages, soon flu¬ ent in French, German, Russian, but especially in English: as an adolescent he fell in love with Shelley’s poetry and wrote skillful if imitative poems in English throughout his life. He also studied chemistry, mostly on his own. His two older brothers, Ludwig and Robert, went to work in their father’s Russian factory. Alfred, aged seventeen, was sent on a long visit (1850-52) to the United States to work with the famous Swedish engineer Ericsson, already plan¬ ning armored vessels like the Monitor of Civil War fame — perhaps an idea borrowed from Immanuel Nobel. Alfred returned to Saint Petersburg, just in time to take part in his family’s boom in munitions work. Russia’s designs on Turkey were raising war tensions in Britain and France, and the czar wanted to be independent of European war supplies. The Nobel factories thus kept enlarging until they were gigantic by nineteenth-century Rus¬ sian standards, employing a thousand workers — almost all un¬ trained and also not very reliable: all were searched on leaving the premises. When the Crimean War broke out in 1854, Immanuel’s underwater mines helped keep the British fleet away from the naval fortress at Kronstadt, and his shells, mortars, and wheel machinery fed the Russian army. But the Russians lost the war, and the czar decided that Russia should no longer depend on home-grown industries. Immanuel Nobel abruptly had all his military contracts canceled and went bankrupt again, and in 1859 the family returned to Sweden to start over. Immanuel was almost sixty.\n\nx\n\n28\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nThe decline of the father and ascent of the sons began. The older sons took over the business, and soon headed back for Finland and eventually Russia to try for another fortune. They made projectiles, cannon, rifles. Then in 1873 they saw the enormous oil deposits of Baku lying unexploited. They moved in. Meanwhile Alfred, restless to be on his own, moved to Paris. He had become an inventor himself; his first patent was for a gas meter. That he switched to explosives was mainly due to his father’s new obsession. Immanuel had failed at inventing a self-propelled tor¬ pedo, and even speculated about training seals to carry explosives. But nitroglycerine had become Immanuel’s new passion. An Italian chemist had created nitroglycerine in 1847, then given it up as too dangerously unstable. No one could find a way to handle it safely. Immanuel nonetheless managed to interest the Swedish military in this powerful explosive. Uncontrolled, however, it was useless. Alfred, the chemist, was asked by his brothers to work on the problem, and thus stumbled into his great career. Alfred worked from 1859 to 1863 before he found a partial answer: soaking nitroglycerine in a granular powder added considerable force to the explosion. But this didn’t much decrease the danger of using it. In 1865, however, Alfred made his first major discovery. He invented the detonator. An explosives authority has described the detonator as “certainly the greatest discovery ever made in both the principle and practice of explosives. On it the whole modern practice of blasting has been built.”3 Indeed, the atomic and hydrogen bombs use the same deto¬ nator principle, which is that a small bit of one explosive can ignite another. A tiny amount of mercury fulminate, acting as the firing cap for nitroglycerine, made that dangerously volatile chemical rela¬ tively safe to use. Nobel took out the Swedish patent, quickly fol¬ lowed by others in England, Belgium, France, and Finland. But the personal cost was high. Alfred’s many failures on the way to his discovery had been mocked by his father and older brothers. When triumph did come, the father insulted Alfred by declaring he had had the successful idea first. Even worse, in 1864 the youngest son, Emil, died at twenty-one in a nitroglycerine explosion. Soon after, the father had a severe stroke. He finally recovered enough to keep busy with various schemes. Worried about Swedish emigra¬ tion to the United States, he tried to invent new manufacturing opportunities to keep Swedish workers at home. To this end, he\n\nThe Founding Father\n\n29\n\ninvented plywood — which, ironically, became a popular industry in the United States. Immanuel died in 1872. Alfred set up a factory in Hamburg to manufacture his new invention, and it gained worldwide sales. But nitroglycerine remained unpredictable and its users often handled it recklessly, with disastrous results. In 1865 a salesman managed to pulverize a building in New York City, injuring eighteen. The next month, in Bremerhaven, twenty-eight were killed and more than two hun¬ dred wounded. Another grisly explosion occured in Sydney, Aus¬ tralia. In 1866 Nobel arrived in New York — with twelve cases of nitroglycerine! — to oversee his New York Blasting Oil Company, only to receive news of another catastrophe in San Francisco, with a dozen or more dead. Other explosions soon left more dead or wounded in California and Liverpool. Nobel transferred control of his U.S. interests to the U.S. Blasting Oil Company, keeping onequarter of the shares. Europe, with wars threatening, was more promising territory anyway, and governments there were less strin¬ gent. In the Prussian-Austrian war of 1866, Nobel made a hand¬ some profit. Soon he was in England, demonstrating the advantages of his nitroglycerine for mining and engineering. In 1866 came Nobel’s greatest invention: dynamite. That year he discovered how liquid nitroglycerine, when absorbed in kieselguhr (a kind of silicified earth formable into a paste), could be shaped into sticks safe to handle. By the middle of the nineteenth century, pub¬ lic works were expanding on an unparalleled scale: mining, harbors, road and bridge building, dam construction, railways, great canals such as the Suez (opened in 1869), and military works. Much of this crucially depended on the new dynamite’s power to move tons of earth, tunnel through mountains, dislodge or pulverize huge rocks. Nobel assiduously patented his dynamite throughout Europe and in America, although nitroglycerine was not protected by patents there. Only eight years after his first patent, he had also built fifteen dynamite factories, crisscrossing Europe and the United States. There were factories in Hamburg and Cologne and Prague, in New York and San Francisco, in Norway, Sweden, Fin¬ land, Scotland, France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, and Hungary. Russia was hard to crack, since dynamite might help ter¬ rorists make bombs to assassinate the czar and other notables. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, Nobel supplied dynamite to both sides. The British Dynamite Company was set up in Scotland\n\n30\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nin 1871, half its capital owned by Nobel, the largest dynamite firm in Europe. Nobel still had two important and immensely profitable inven¬ tions ahead of him. In 1875 he lowered the freezing point of nitro¬ glycerine and thus produced “blasting gelatine,” opening a wide variety of new engineering and military uses. In 1887 he patented a smokeless-powder propellant called ballistite, an invention said to have most influenced all weapons design from the 1890s to 1914.4 To his final days, Nobel worked to improve and diversify his inventions and holdings. But he also tried his hand at other things: cannon borings more resistant to wear and tear, and an aerial projec¬ tile that could be used for war or rescue work.5 In the 1870s he patented an automatic brake, a boiler that wouldn’t explode under pressure, and a method of casting iron. Late in life he sought substi¬ tutes for rubber and leather from nitrocellulose, and ways of manu¬ facturing artificial silk. In 1875 Nobel lived in Paris —- or, more accurately, kept a home there between his endless business travels. But troubles arose. His French company, the Societe Centrale de Dynamite, had been involved in a Suez Canal scandal, and though Nobel did not man¬ age or own this company, he was famous or notorious enough to become the storm center. A few years later, after an arms sale to Italy aroused angry French press and parliamentary denunciations, Nobel was accused of being a foreign spy — his laboratory was near the government one — and of doing illegal experiments. His labo¬ ratory was searched by the police and padlocked. Nobel thereupon migrated in 1890 and set up a home and laboratory in San Remo on the Italian Riviera. His last years were not quiet. His giant French company failed. Nobel, as a member of the board, could by French law be held responsible to the full extent of his fortune and thus wiped out. He reorganized the company with great energy and came out whole. A legal battle dragged on with two British inventors whom he had trusted but who now claimed they had independently invented Nobel’s ballistite under the name of cordite. The British court gave the two Britons only a token victory, but Nobel was embittered. Friends, he complained, are “found only among dogs, whom we feed with the flesh of others, and amongst worms, whom we feed with our own. A grateful belly and a grateful heart are twins.”6 He vented his feelings in a satire called The Bacillus Patent.\n\nThe Founding Feither\n\n31\n\nJust past sixty, his health began to fail. Rheumatism was the least of it, heart trouble the worst. He was ordered to slow down, but kept on working and visiting his far-flung companies as before. He invested in the Swedish Bofors factory and built a large laboratory there with the latest equipment. He helped finance a dirigible bal¬ loon expedition to the North Pole headed by a Swedish explorer. The balloon vanished in the Arctic; remains were discovered in 1929. As his health got worse, Nobel started writing curious things. One was a drama called Nemesis about the Renaissance nobleman Cenci who forced his daughter into incest. Nobel’s poetic hero, Shelley, had of course written on the same theme in The Cenci. Nobel had not written any poetry since the 1870s, and then in his fluent and force¬ ful English; this play was done in Swedish, which by now he wrote in a stilted manner. After Nobel died, the family tried to have all hectographed copies destroyed, but three copies survived. Then came a massive cerebral hemorrhage which, as so often, reduced its sufferer to his childhood language, Swedish. His French and Italian nurses understood nothing he said. On 10 December 1896 Alfred Nobel died. No member of the family was present; his older brothers had died before him, Robert only a few months earlier, in July 1896, Ludwig in 1888, his mother in 1889. Nor were any friends present. But there is no evidence that Nobel ever had a single close friend.\n\nThe Vagabond and Wayward Millionaire During the early 1870s, when Nobel was in his prime, an English business associate described him this way: He was of average height, with a slender stooping figure. He wore his beard, whiskers and mustache untrimmed. His eyes which were small and of light gray color were full of vivacity, and his face, espe¬ cially when engaged in a conversation, betokened great intelli¬ gence.7\n\nOne of his personal assistants gave a rather different look: Nobel gave the impression of being somewhat nervous. His move¬ ments were lively, his gait somewhat mincing, his facial expression\n\n32\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nvery changeable, as was his conversational style, often spiced with odd remarks and strange ideas. At times these remarks seemed almost absurd and appeared deliberately intended to shock old fogies. To his Swedish fellow-countrymen, unaccustomed to his light, French-inspired way of talking, he often seemed a bit bewil¬ dering, to say the least.8\n\nThe inner man was elusive: shy, lonely, never allowing anyone close to him, ironic, moodily changeable, in part a Nordic Shelley, in part a master of vituperation who would wickedly tongue-lash associates in public. A razor-sharp businessman indeed, but also aloof, keeping all his employees at a great distance. In contrast, his richer brother Ludwig’s home was right by his Russian factory and he spent off-hours with his engineers, foremen, and draftsmen.9 Ludwig, this report goes on, was not typical of the Swedish disin¬ terest in human beings — the once-popular reason for “why every second Swede is an engineer.” But Alfred, obviously, fit that stereo¬ type in several ways. Insofar as Nobel had any home, it was in Paris. Victor Hugo, in fact, may have been the one to label him the “millionaire vagabond.” He bought a mansion and had it decorated, but typi¬ cally refused to state any preference for color or style. He added on a private laboratory. The house became the stopping-off headquar¬ ters of his complex business interests, the center of a vast corre¬ spondence in most European languages. Nobel never married, and biographers know of his interest in only two women. In 1876 Bertha Kinsky, of an Austrian aristocratic family, adventurously answered one of Nobel’s advertisements for a private secretary to work for a “wealthy, highly educated, elderly gentleman” — he was then forty-three. She was thirty-three, spoke several languages, and was highly cultivated. They seem to have found each other immediately attractive and sympathetic. She very soon confided her story to him. She had had many suitors, some too old or too young or too wild or tame or otherwise unsuitable. Once, when he found her in despair and weeping, Nobel was moved enough to present her with the manuscript of a hundred-page “philosophic poem” written in English, which seems to have been an outpouring of his most private feelings. That so secretive a man would let anyone see such a poem is remarkable; that he let Bertha read it so soon after meeting suggests he must have been more than\n\nThe Founding Fdther\n\n33\n\nhalf in love with the lovely, restless, independent-minded Bertha: a mirror of himself in many ways. But before anything could develop, before she even took up her secretarial duties, Bertha ran off to marry the son of a noble Viennese family When she wrote Nobel the news, she was Bertha von Suttner. He kept contact with her, and when peace later became her crusade, Bertha no doubt persuaded him to add a peace prize to his will. The same year, perhaps on the rebound, he met another woman during a trip to Vienna. She differed from Bertha in every way. Sofie Hess was an eighteen-year-old clerk in a florist’s shop. She was pretty and vulgar and a little stupid, kind-hearted but bored except when talking about herself or gossiping about others. But he was somehow enchanted and bought her an expensive bracelet. He began seeing her whenever in Vienna, and set her up in an apart¬ ment. In one way their liaison was banal: the older rich man keep¬ ing a young mistress with whom he shared a bed and little else. Nobel wrote her continually but was too guarded to reveal much of himself to someone like Sofie. He called her “dear child,” signed himself Brummbar (growling bear — her nickname for him), was avuncular, promised her presents and trips if she was “a good girl.” He moved her into a Paris apartment. And he actually took her to Stockholm to meet his mother, which miraculously went off fairly well. But she was too immature; he shied from marriage or the per¬ sonal intimacy and confidences she wanted. Still, it went on for fifteen years, before ending oddly. He bought her a villa in Ischl, and she began declaring that she was Nobel’s wife. As surprised acquaintances reported this news, Nobel grew more embarrassed. In 1891 the final break came. Sofie announced she was pregnant, not by Nobel but a Hungarian cavalry officer, who had not however proposed marriage. Nobel generously set her up with a comfortable annuity. The cavalry officer, by army code, was obliged to marry Sofie, but the scandal also forced him to resign his commission. He became a champagne salesman and, immedi¬ ately after the marriage ceremony, vanished — or almost: he started writing Nobel for money, in vain. Contemporary Viennese gossip provided an alternative story: that the child was Alfred’s and the cavalry officer only a decoy.10 Nobel seemed most to have loved his inventions and businesses. He was a prodigious, incessant, and single-minded worker who\n\n34\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nwandered Europe endlessly, watching over the making of his prod¬ ucts, expanding and consolidating his interests, fending off competi¬ tors. He also preferred to work from the outside rather than within. When inspecting one of his many firms, he always did so unobtru¬ sively; he was said to enter even his own laboratory by the rear door. He chose never to personally own or manage any of the factories that manufactured his inventions. He held the patents and some of the shares, but the factories were all locally owned and managed. This sometimes caused two Nobel firms to compete ruthlessly in the same market, even issuing counterinjunctions against each other. Nobel stood aside: when the German Nobel company started exporting to Britain, Nobel thought the best strategy was for the British company to strike back by exporting to Germany.11 Although on the board and a large shareholder of each of his compa¬ nies, he had no authority to give orders. Yet it was the Nobel name that made the companies rich. This ambiguous role apparently suited Nobel. He was after all wealthy enough to remedy the situa¬ tion at any time, simply by retaining the majority of shares in any of the companies. He chose not to do so. This way of being in but never quite of the great companies built from his inventions, of having it always both ways at once by never committing himself wholly, extended to every side of his life. “I wish I could produce a substance of such frightful efficacy for whole¬ sale devastation that wars should thereby become altogether impos¬ sible,” he said. But then, with equal conviction, he told an assistant, “Well, it is fiendish things we are working on, but they are so inter¬ esting as purely technical problems and . . . clear of all financial and commercial considerations, that they are doubly fascinating.”12 Nobel once toyed with buying a Stockholm newspaper, but denied that it was because he wanted influence. He wrote: If I owned a newspaper, I would oppose my own interests. It is one of my peculiarities never to consider my private interests. My policy as a publisher would be: work against armaments and such medieval remnants.13\n\nIf armaments must be made, he went on, then each nation should make its own. This was the same man who insisted on the right to sell his weapons to all buyers, and fought legal battles when a client-nation tried to deny him sales to a military rival.\n\nThe Founding Father\n\n35\n\nIn the same way, though he was perhaps the prototype of the international capitalist of the later nineteenth century, he was in but not quite of this group. It is striking that, like Nobel, so many of these were born in the 1830s: Rockefeller, Carnegie, Hill, Harriman, Gould, Pullman, J. P. Morgan Sr., and Nobel’s two older brothers, Ludwig and Robert, those Rockefellers of the North. Depending on one’s criteria, these men were either captains of industry or mere predatory capitalists. But there was another contemporary group, variously known as Merchants of Death or armaments titans: Krupp, Skoda, Vickers, the French Schneiders, the older Morgan, the Rothschilds, Bismarck’s banker Bleichroder. Nobel was a charter member of both groups, self-made million¬ aires who became colossi of profits from wars and industrialization. He was probably the first to invent the great monopolistic trust and holding company of the modern kind: family-owned firms were still the norm in Britain and France, and the Germans hadn’t yet orga¬ nized into cartels, only “profit-pooling” alliances.14 Again, Nobel deliberately stood apart from those otherwise like him. Certainly he could be as sharp and ruthless a competitor as any when necessary. His biographer Halasz noted how Nobel hastened to patent his inventions even before they were perfected.15 Yet some¬ thing in Nobel did not always find it necessary to dominate. The sim¬ plest evidence, as noted, is that he could easily have become far richer and more powerful by owning the companies exploiting his name. Few of those named above would have hesitated to do so. Nobel, however, had a fatal gift of introspection, of mordant self¬ observation, which would have crimped the relentless trajectory of a Rockefeller or a Krupp. Nobel once disapprovingly said of an overeager associate, “Nothing is sacred to him except his own interest.” Not that such views kept Nobel himself from selling his explo¬ sives to all buyers indiscriminately. But it slowed him, turned him inward in an unusual, tormented way, making him doubt anything but brainpower, especially his own. He sold to both sides in a war, but could never say with Basil Zaharoff, the later notorious muni¬ tions king, “I made wars so that I could sell to both sides.” Perhaps Nobel at heart really was an idealist, as his Swedish defenders like to insist: a sort of high-minded sheep — or only half-wolf— among the wolves he did business with. Perhaps his dividedness reflected the melancholia he often complained of, and the sardonic tone that sometimes stung others.\n\n•v\n\n36\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nWhatever the reason, it is surely difficult to imagine a Rocke¬ feller or Krupp sitting like Nobel in his lonely Paris mansion read¬ ing history, classics, and Shelley and Byron. J. P. Morgan collected rare books, not to read but as beautiful artifacts. Between selling and improving his explosives, Nobel frequented “advanced” intel¬ lectual salons in Paris, talking of radical politics or the latest work of Zola or Maupassant. Would Morgan or the others take time from their busy schedules to attend a dinner, as Nobel did, in order to meet a poet like Victor Hugo? Or periodically take to writing poetry, drama, and novels?\n\nThe Will Nowhere is Nobel’s inclination to have it both ways more apparent than in his will. Most of Nobel’s biographers feel that he was greatly influenced by his brother Ludwig’s death — or, rather, the inaccu¬ rate obituaries that followed it. Some of the press mistakenly thought it was Alfred who had died, and he had the strange experi¬ ence of reading his own obituaries, many of which were hardly flat¬ tering. He was scathingly described as a war profiteer who became rich by inventing new ways to kill and maim people. He may have written a will in 1889, but it does not survive. His 1893 will gives part of his estate for scientific discoveries and an award for peace. Literature was not mentioned. In the 1895 and final will, all these came to share equally. He rewrote his earlier wills to vindicate his life: his riches would now go to benefit humankind. Some questions arise immediately. Especially in light of his shock from the mistaken obituaries upon Ludwig’s death, why didn’t Nobel set up prizes while he lived? He was of course rich enough to have done so. “Surplus wealth,” said Andrew Carnegie in 1889, “is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community,” and also: “The man who dies . . . rich dies disgraced.” Carnegie, at least partly prompted by Nobel’s will, established the Carnegie Trusts in 1900. But Nobel, “the man nobody knew,” characteristically also chose to become the philanthropist nobody knew. By arranging to be posthumously generous, he once again avoided any public intrusion into his privacy. His will nowhere directs that his prizes be named after him. Perhaps, as Elisabeth Crawford suggests, entrusting the i\n\nThe Founding Father\n\n37\n\nprizes to Swedish institutions increased the distance between him¬ self and those he helped.16 He had always detested celebrity. To a Swedish publisher who simply wanted to publish his picture in a book about famous Swedes, Nobel not only refused but tartly added: “I am not aware that I have deserved fame, and I take no pleasure in its clatter.” To a requested donation for a proposed memorial to Pas¬ teur: “I am sure Pasteur would like to send all such manifestations to the devil, and that he loathes advertising his name.”17 Nobel appar¬ ently valued only two honors given him: election to the Royal Society and to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which earlier awarded him its Letterstedt Medal for his detonator invention. There is no question here of hypocrisy or false modesty, rather something in Nobel that, while intent on reaping the world’s riches, also distrusted the value of all worldly things. To his nephew’s request for biographical information, he replied sardonically: Alfred Nobel: his miserable half-life should have been terminated at birth by a humane doctor, as he drew his first howling breath. . . . One and only one wish: not to be buried alive. Greatest sin: that he does not worship Mammon.18\n\nThe same nephew wanted Nobel to have his portrait painted, and was once more turned down. Nobel claimed he was too old and hadn’t enough vanity to want his “hog-bristle beard” immortalized. Besides, what could a portrait show him that he did not already know about himself, nakedly and painfully? “I am afflicted with a proclivity for self-criticism whereby every blemish is revealed in all its unredeemed ugliness.”19 But his famous will is in fact a kind of self-portrait for the world to see, where his inner tensions are turned outward into criteria of what he thought meaningful in life.\n\nThe Laureate as “Expert” Many philanthropists hope to improve social conditions; scientific and literary societies usually honor great individual achievements. Nobel coupled these. His prizes go to individuals, who form an elite to benefit society. He distrusted politics and movements, even the companies that sustained his fortune. He trusted only certain individuals.\n\n38\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE\n\nThe word “expert” perhaps best captures Nobel’s aim here. The term came into wide use by mid-nineteenth century, reflecting the new prestige of scientists, engineers, inventors, and Captains of Industry. Indeed, in the 1880s, a rage began for what would later be called technocracy, where industrial managers and technical work¬ ers saved society — from itself — by controlling and developing it “rationally.” Edward Bellamy’s 1888 novel Looking Backward 2000-1887 promoted such ideas; it sold a million copies in ten years and was translated into a dozen languages. Nobel read Bellamy both with sympathy and in a cross-grained way: reverence about “cooperative production” and political “corporationism” did not escape his scepticism about any such schemes. Nobel’s laureates in one way reflect his lifelong fascination with Shelley. Nobel’s scientists, writers, and peace workers lack the prophetic grandeur of the Shelleyan prophets, whose true benefac¬ tors of humanity are the “unacknowledged legislators” of the world: Plato, Moses, Jesus, Newton, Shakespeare. But the purpose is akin. If great prophets are not possible in bleak modern times, the “expert” will have to do. Nobel, himself the expert inventor of dynamite, probably included himself among these. At least he would honor those after him. Nobel’s “expert” makes the fundamental discoveries and helps create the new morality. Dynamite and ballistite may help abolish war, but that is up to the politicians. (Like the Nobel expert, the atom-bomb scientists built the terrible weapon but let political leaders decide whether to use it.) This possibility seems to have depressed Nobel’s hope for progress. In his 1893 will, Nobel inserted the following telling restriction: that his will and the prizes perhaps should be canceled in thirty years, for “if in thirty years it is not possible to reform the present system, we shall unavoidably fall back into barbarism.”20 Partly he meant the unlikelihood of pre¬ venting war, partly that of reforming modern democracy. He luckily removed this proviso in his final will. Nobel’s perspective here shows most clearly in his many literary efforts. One is titled In Lightest Africa. The wordplay, of course, is on “darkest Africa”: much of Africa was still unexplored by Europeans in the later nineteenth century. Nobel’s subject, however, is obvi¬ ously modern Europe. He means to strike at Europe’s pride in its all-conquering Enlightenment, embodied in its proud bourgeois success.\n\nThe Founding Father\n\n39\n\nIn Lightest Africa is a fable of politics, ancient and modern. One main character is Avenir (“the future”), a very progressive democrat. T he other is the “I” of the narrative, who favors the sternest, least democratic regimes of the past. Avenir, scorning the past, dismisses as atrocious the three historical forms of government: absolute monarchy, constitutional monarchy, and democracy. Government by heredity is absurd; constitutional monarchy is impotent; democracy is run by those who talk best, the orators and lawyers. When the reactionary “I” urges a return to autocratic powers — ancient Rome was "
