        "text": "November 6, 2019\n\n\" ...and how frontiers which should have been firm and lasting had become fluid and shifting, moving away and lost in the distance like the capricious rivulets of spring.\"- from \"The Bridge on the Drina\" by Ivo Andric (1942)\n\nOnce again, I am grateful that my international reading project brought me into the realm of an amazing writer like Ivo Andric. As the next country on my list was Bosnia, I was pleasantly surprised to discover they the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to a gifted Bosnian author.\n\nAndric was originally heralded for his poetry but transitioned to novels later in his career. Having served as an Ambassador for Yugoslavia to Germany in the lead up to World War II and placed under house arrest for refusing to signs loyalty oath to the Third Reich, Andric was at his most prolific in those three years, churning out three masterpieces, among them the featured novel \"The Bridge on the Drina.\"\n\nThis historical novel centers on the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge which spans the Drina River near the village of Višegrad in current day Bosnia-Herzegovina. Built by the Grand Visier of the Ottoman Empire in 1577 to commemorate his capture as well as the widespread enslavement of Christian boys in the western regions of the Balkans brought to Istanbul for conversion and lifelong service to the Empire, the bridge is both literal and metaphorical as this region served as an important crossroad of Christian and Turko-Islamic frontier.\n\nFor over three hundred years the bridges stood a seemingly indestructible testament to the endurance of the Ottoman Empire but was endless subject to the ever shifting frontier as Turks, Serbians and Austrian-Hungarian Christians constantly jostled for dominance of the region.\n\nThe bridge was significantly destroyed beginning in World War I and further damaged during World War II so, at the time of Andric's writing and until his death, the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge was largely a ruin. And the wrestling of control for the region didn't end with World War II with Yugoslavia descending into civil war following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the village of Višegrad became the site of genocidal activities by Serbian militias against Muslim Bosniaks as thousands of Muslim men and boys were slaughtered and thrown off the bridge into the Drina, an atrocity repeated over and over again by successive waves of invaders. Turkey provided funding in 2010 to rebuild the bridge to its pristine glory.\n\nI'm grateful to have discovered this beautifully written and well told story about a region whose history is scarcely known to me. I look forward to reading the other three novels of the period."
