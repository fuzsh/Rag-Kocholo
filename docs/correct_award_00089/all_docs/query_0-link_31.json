        "text": "Signs by the Roadside\n\n*\n\nBetween the fear that something would happen and the hope that still it wouldn’t, there is much more space than one thinks. On that narrow, hard, bare and dark space a lot of us spend their lives.\n\n*Ivo Andric\n\nI knew a man who succeeded in finding an evil word for everything he didn’t have and everything he didn’t understand.\n\n*\n\nThere are some traditional stories that are so universal that we forget when and where we heard or read them, and they live in us like the memory of some experience of our own.\n\nSuch a story is the one about the young man who, wandering through the world to seek his fortune, set out along a dangerous road, not knowing where it was leading him. So as not to lose his way, the young man took an ax and carved in the trunks of the trees beside the road signs which would later show him the way back.\n\nThe young man personifies the shared, eternal destiny of all mankind: on the one hand, a dangerous and uncertain road, and on the other our deep human need not to get lost, but to find our way in the world and leave some trace behind us. The signs we leave after us will not escape the destiny of everything human - transience and oblivion. They may never be noticed at all and perhaps no one will understand them. But still, they are necessary, just as it is natural and necessary that we should open our hearts and communicate with others.\n\nIf these small obscure signs do not save us from disorientation and all kinds of trials, they can at least make them easier, and help us in so far as they convince us that, in everything we do, we are not alone, nor the first, nor unique...\n\n*\n\nWhatever does not cause pain - is not life, whatever does not pass - is not joy.\n\n*\n\nMany of the great, fateful passions of our youth are founded on a simple misunderstanding. We are like an awkward, clumsy person who goes into a shop, points to something in the window and says in the tone of one who is ready for anything: \"I'll take that and pay whatever you ask.'\n\nAnd afterwards when it is all too late, you see that you went into the wrong shop and asked for something you did not need and never actually ever wanted.\n\n*\n\nI do not think that I shall ever succeed, even remotely, in expressing the beauty of the ordinary actions, trivial events and small joys of everyday life, as they are seen through some great anxiety or sorrow that temporarily shrouds the world.\n\nThrough our seemingly endless cares and efforts, the joys of life look perfectly and enchantingly beautiful. And if later, when the cares pass and the efforts cease, we could see these small things with the same eyes, we would be fully compensated for everything. But we cannot.\n\n*\n\nAs we read good writers, miracles occur before our eyes. Often at the beginning of a sentence, when we see a thought coming into being, we stop, surprised and afraid. And we wonder in disbelief: 'Is it possible? Will what I foresee really happen? Is this really the same thought that we ourselves have sensed more than once when our consciousness has come into contact with the world around us, that hidden part of our inner reality? Can it be that someone else has seen and experienced this in the same way?'\n\nAnd when, having read is the case, we pause over the sentence, thoughtful, grateful and glad, because we have been given the greatest gift that reading can offer: we have felt that we are never alone, neither at the hardest nor the best moments, nor in our worst doubts, nor in out most daring conclusions, but that we are linked with other people by numerous hidden bonds, of which we are unaware, but which 'our' writer discloses to us.\n\nThat is salvation.\n\n*\n\nThere are people who are able to hide the direction of their thoughts and the course of their feelings so successfully that no one can guess their true nature. But it seems that imperceptibly, over the years, our thoughts and feelings model our faces, as quiet, persistent water does the surface of the earth, and when old age starts to approach, they suddenly show unexpected furrows and chasms. And anyone can read all that once seemed forever hidden.\n\n*\n\nPeople would understand me better, forgive me many things and even perhaps give me credit for a little, if they knew that everything I have done over the years, I have done in the hard, black, narrow strip of time between my resentment of coming catastrophe itself.\n\n*\n\nI think I am not mistaken if I say that ninety-nine per cent of all that I have written was written by day. As soon as the sun sets, my writing time is over. After that I read and think, and sometimes make notes, but it never happens that I sit down at my table to write. After sunset, not only in the dark but even by bright lamp-light - I do not see characters or events, although I may recall some details; because then the whole world is like a place I have travelled away from. The next day, when I wake, it is there again and I can write once more.\n\n*\n\nWhen I obliged to say something about my literary 'gift' and vocation, about my personal development and about my life's aims and work, I am like a blind man talking about colors and shapes.\n\n*\n\nThere is a certain type of man who is common in our country, who thinks that quarreling is action, and roughness is the same as energy, that to insult an enemy means the same as to strike him, that all restraint in speech is weakness, and that any attempt at foresight is a waste of time; in short: that the so-called struggle of life consists in ceaseless, alternate barking and snarling.\n\n*\n\nHas anyone ever loved the world as I have? At night, when all is at rest and when it is finally time to lie down, I am still restless and before I fall asleep, I am still disturbed by the thought that at this moment someone, late and alone, is passing through the streets and that I could meet him, see him and talk with him. I never have enough air, never enough water, or plants, or human faces. I exhaust my strength, I have lost my youth and I have not known peace, all because of my appetite and love of the world. At night, when I reach home, exhausted with everything, I long to have icy, silent earth scattered over my burning eyes and bitter lips, and to be freed from desire and disquiet and the sadness of fulfillment. And yet, I fall asleep with difficulty, sleep lightly and for a short time, and rise early. It seems that I am always awake.\n\nOn one of the ramparts of the Kalemegdan fortress. I shaded my eyes from the sun with my hand in the broad space above the shadowy trenches, full of grass, I caught sight of a whole world of bugs and flies, cobwebs and birds. The air around me swarmed with innumerable living creatures in motion. Over the stones under my feet ran lizards and spiders, in the freshly dug soil beside me larvae and worm writhed, struggling with the air and light. I suddenly felt how inaccurate our egocentric notion is that we walk on the earth and stand in the air as though separated by something, as though something separate, and that the truth is that we form, with everything around us, one sea of living beings, now disturbed, now calm. We do not live, we are life. Individual existence like individual death are only transient illusion, two momentary waves in the ocean of movements around us. And it seems to me that I have glimpsed the root of our idea of eternal life and resurrection. Eternal life is in the realisation that all our limitations, all states and changes are only imaginary, inherited delusions, and the resurrections in the discovery that we never lived, but that, with life, we have always existed.\n\nNobel Prize\n\n*"
