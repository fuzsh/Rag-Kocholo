        "text": "Morning ride will take us through interesting regions of central Bosnia, passing by Visoko town and valley of Bosnian Pyramids. We will continue the ride along the flows of river Bosna and Lasva including an especially beautiful flow and canyon of Vrbas. Nearly three hours later, we will arrive to Jajce.\n\nOnce there, first thing we go and see is one of the World‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, and the only one in the World placed in the city center, famous Pliva Waterfalls ‚Äì spot where Pliva river ends its flow and meets Vrbas is simply breathtaking.\n\nAfter we bless our eyes and souls we will head for a walking tour through Jajce and visit Jajce Citadel (Fortress), the Museum of the Second Session of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), Medvjed Kula, the Tower of St. Luke, famous Catacombs ‚Äì underground church and one of the World‚Äôs very few mosques named after woman ‚Äì Mosque of Esma Sultanija.\n\nJajce Citadel is amazingly interesting place so no doubt you will enjoy.\n\nOnce we fully soak up the atmosphere of amazing Jajce we will head towards the two lakes ‚Äì Large and Small Pliva Lake.\n\nWhatever you prefer, walking around, kayaking or canoeing (in 1963. World and European Championship in kayaking and canoeing on still waters were held on Pliva lake), laying on the beaches, swimming, fishing or just photography ‚Äì everything is only a ‚Äúdesire‚Äù away üôÇ\n\nVery interesting part of the Pliva lakes story are Mills at small Pliva lake. Amongst people famously called ‚ÄúMlinƒçiƒái‚Äù this place used to be main tourist potential of Great Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy.\n\nWe will make a lunch break and enjoy some quality time at Large Pliva Lake. After Jajce and surroundings it is time to head back, but the we are not ending this day yet.\n\nA very important part of the this tour is Travnik, viziers town rich with cultural and historical heritage.\n\nTravnik is a place where we will see one of the best preserved Ottoman forts in our country dating late XIV century.\n\nLocation just under the fort is home to stunningly beautiful springs of Plava Voda (‚Äúblue water‚Äù), place ideal for Bosnian coffee break.\n\nIt is very important to mention that Travnik is hometown to Bosnian Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andric and his most famous novel Bridge Over Drina.\n\nWe don‚Äôt forget and Coloured Mosque, both Clock Towers as Travnik is the only town in Bosnia with two of those, and very centre of Travnik carsija (marketplace). To put a cherry on a top, we will taste the worldwide famous Travnik sheep cheese.\n\nAfter explorations of Travnik we will head back to Sarajevo with arrival at, roughly, 7 PM. However, having in mind we are always pushing our limits and going above and beyond in order to keep up with the outstanding quality of each of our trips, day can be even longer."
