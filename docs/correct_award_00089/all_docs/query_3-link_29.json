MCNEILL\n\nOriginally published in 1945 Translation © George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1959 Phoenix Edition /977 ISBN: 0-226-02045-2\n\nINTRODUCTION William H. McNeill The committee that awarded the Nobel prize for literature to Ivo Andric in 1961 cited the epic force of The Bridge on the Drina, first published in Serbo-Croat in 1945, as\n\njustification for its award. The award was indeed justified if, as I believe, The Bridge on the Drina is one of the most perceptive, resonant, and well-wrought works of fiction written in the twentieth century. But the epic comparison seems strained. At any rate, if the work is epic, it remains an epic without a hero. The bridge, both in its inception and at its destruction, is central to the book, but can scarcely be called a hero. It is, rather, a symbol of the establishment and the overthrow of a civilization that came forcibly to the Balkans in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries and was no less forcibly overthrown in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. That civilization was Ottoman—radically alien to, and a conscious rival of, both Orthodox Russia and the civilization of western Europe. It was predominantly Turkish and Moslem, but also embraced Christian and Jewish communities, along with such outlaw elements as Gypsies.\n\nAll find a place in Andric's book; and with an economy of means that is all but magical, he presents the reader with a thoroughly credible portrait of the birth and death of Ottoman civilization as experienced in his native land of Bosnia. No better introduction to the study of Balkan and Ottoman history exists, nor do I know of any work of fiction that more persuasively introduces the reader to a civilization other than our own. It is an intellectual and emotional adventure to encounter the Ottoman world through Andric's pages in its grandoise beginning and at its tottering finale. Every episode rings true, from the role of terror in fastening the Turkish power firmly on the land to the role of an Austrian army whorehouse in corrupting the old ways. No anthropologist has ever reported the processes of cultural change so sensitively,- no historian has entered so\n\neffectively into the minds of the persons with whom he sought to deal. It is, in short, a marvelous work, a masterpiece, and very much sui generis. Perhaps a few remarks about Bosnia and its history may be helpful for readers who approach this work without prior acquaintance with the Balkan scene. Bosnia is a mountainous region in the central part of Yugoslavia. Today it is one of the constituent republics of that federal state. In medieval times it broke away from the Kingdom of Serbia in a.d. 960 and thereafter became more or less independent, though perpetually subject to rival jurisdictional claims because of its borderland position between Orthodox and Latin Christendom. In the twelfth century, the ruler of Bosnia sought to assert a fuller independence by becoming a Bogomil. This was a religion, related to Manichaeism, that\n\nspread also to western Europe where it was\n\nknown as Albigensianism. Many Bosnians followed their ruler's example, remaining heretics in the eyes of their Christian neighbors until after the Turkish conquest, when nearly all of the Bogomils became Moslem. As a result, about one-third of the population of Bosnia is Moslem today, even though they speak a Slavic language, SerboCroat, as their ancestors had done back to Bogomil days. The Turks conquered Bosnia between 1386 and 1463. Conversion to Islam proceeded rather rapidly, especially among the land-owning families of Bosnia; and with religious conversion went a cultural transformation that made Bosnia an outpost of Ottoman\n\ncivilization. From the fifteenth century onwards, Bosnian military manpower reinforced Ottoman armies. Year after year, Moslem warriors answered the summonses of local governors to go raiding into Christian lands to the north and west. Simultaneously, at irregular intervals agents from Constantinople chose Christian peasant conscripts to replenish the ranks of the sultan's personal household. These recruits were officially classed as slaves, and in addition to military service in the Janissary corps many performed menial services in and around the court. Some, however, after appropriate training, emerged as the topmost military administrators and commanders of the Ottoman armies. A select few rose to the supreme administrative post of grand vizier. Andric's story of how the bridge was built is completely historical. A Bosnian peasant's son,\n\nMuhammad Sôkôllu (né Sokolović) became grand vizier in 1565, and as such governed the empire until his death in 1579. Having been recruited into the sultan's service as a youth, he remembered well his Bosnian birth, and among other acts acknowledging his origins, he chose his own blood brother to become patriarch of the Serbian church. The construction of the bridge across the Drina was another, similar act emanating from the grand vizier's desire to be remembered in the place of his birth. Ever since the Turkish conquest, Bosnian society had comprised a complex intermingling of Moslems, Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians. As long as Turkish power remained secure, local Moslem dominance was assured, both by the prowess of Moslem landowners and by the sporadic force Ottoman armies could bring to bear against any outside challenge. As Ottoman power diminished, however, and the\n\nmight of adjacent Christian empires correspondingly increased, the religious divisions of Bosnian society became potentially explosive. Revolt by an oppressed Christian peasantry could expect to win sympathy abroad, either in Russia (for the Orthodox) or in Austria (for Roman Catholics). Simultaneously, mounting population pressure made it harder and harder for the peasantry to maintain traditional standards of living. On top of this, early in the nineteenth century, a handful of intellectuals, educated in Germany, picked up the idea that nationhood and language belonged together and could only attain full perfection within the borders of a sovereign, independent state. Since existing literary languages did not define clear boundaries\n\nbetween the Slavic dialects spoken in Balkan\n\nvillages, the ideal of linguistic nationalism intensified confusion in the older religiously structured (and divided) society by offering individuals alternative loyalties and principles of public identity. These circumstances provided the background for the \"Eastern question\" that so bedeviled nineteenth-century European diplomats. Bosnia played a conspicuous role. First it was Moslems who revolted against Constantinople (1821, 1828, 1831, 1838-50) in a vain effort to defend their accustomed privileges. Soon after their reactionary ideals had met final defeat (1850), through military conquest by reformed (i.e., partially westernized) Ottoman armies, Christian peasants of Bosnia, objecting to an intensified tax burden brought on by a modernized administration, took up the standard of revolt (1862, 1875-78). This, in turn, provoked intervention by the Christian\n\npowers of Europe, with the result that at the Congress of Berlin (1878), Bosnia and the adjacent province of Herzegovina were placed under an Austrian protectorate. A generation later, in 1908, the Austrians announced the annexation of these two provinces to the Hapsburg crown. This precipitated a diplomatic crisis that was part of the prologue to World War I; and, of course, that war was itself occasioned by the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, by Bosnian revolutionaries who wanted their land to become part of Serbia. After 1918, they had their way, for Bosnia was incorporated into the new south Slav kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. During World War II, Bosnia, because of its mountainous character, became Tito's principal stronghold, and after 1945 it was made one of the six constituent republics of the new federal Yugoslav state.\n\nIvo Andric was born in Travnik, Bosnia, in 1892, but he spent his first two years in Sarajevo, where his father worked as a silversmith. This was a traditional art, preserving artisan skills dating back to Ottoman times; but taste had changed and the market for the sort of silverwork Ivo's father produced was severely depressed. The family therefore lived poorly; and when the future writer was still an infant, his father died, leaving his penniless young widow to look after an only child. They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where the young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, and listening to tales about its origin and history which he used so skillfully to define the character of the early Ottoman presence in that remote Bosnian town. The family was Orthodox Christian, i.e., Serb; but in his boyhood and youth Andric was thrown into\n\nintimate contact with the entire spectrum of religious communities that coexisted precariously in the Bosnia of his day; and his family shared the puzzling encounter with a strange new Austrian world that he portrays so sensitively in The Bridge on the Drina. The young Andric returned to Sarajevo to attend secondary school, and there became a nationalist revolutionary. This did not prevent\n\nhim from attending Hapsburg universities, at Zagreb, Cracow, Vienna, and Graz; but with the outbreak of World War I his political activity caused the Austrian police to arrest him. Andric therefore spent the first three years of World War I in an internment camp, where he wrote his first successful book, published in 1918. On release (1917) he took an active part\n\nin conducting a literary review that advocated the political union of all south Slav peoples, and he had a minor part in the political transactions that brought Croatia into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes that emerged in December, 1918. Thereafter, Andric returned to academic pursuits, working towards a doctor's degree at the University of Graz, achieved in 1924. His thesis was entitled \"The Development of the Spiritual Life of Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Sovereignty.\" The solid and precise historical information that underlies The Bridge on the Drina was thus systematically built up through academic study; but instead of continuing as a historian Andric opted for a diplomatic career. Between 1924 and 1941 he was stationed at various European capitals. In his spare time he wrote short stories and planned his later, larger works.\n\nWorld War II presented him with the enforced leisure necessary for realization of those ambitions. With the collapse in 1941 of the government he had served, Andric, who had been Yugoslav ambassador at Berlin, returned to private life in Belgrade. During the ensuing years of harsh occupation and mounting resistance, he wrote no less than three novels, including The Bridge on the Drina. They were published in rapid succession in 1945, and at once established his reputation in Yugoslavia as a major writer. Translated into English in 1959, The Bridge on the Drina became the principal basis for his Nobel Prize for literature, which, in turn, made him a literary figure of world renown. Under Tito, Andric held a number of honorific offices, but even after the Nobel Prize he maintained a discipline of work that permitted continued literary creation, and kept a zone of privacy around himself that few could penetrate. He died in Belgrade in 1975.\n\nWhat seems truly remarkable about Andric's literary achievement in The Bridge on the Drina is the way he entered into the minds of the Moslems of Bosnia. No doubt, in his youth he had ample opportunity to observe the fractured world in which the Bosnian Moslems found themselves. Very early in life he found the Orthodox Christian world view he himself had inherited to be inadequate. Revolutionary linguistic nationalism, to which he lent support in his student days, recognized no distinction between speakers of Serbo-Croat on the basis of their religion. Yet older habits of thought and feeling lingered on in Bosnia, so that Orthodox Serbs and Roman Catholic Croats stubbornly distrusted one another, while both Christian communities remembered the former Moslem domination with dread.\n\nClearly, Andric grew up in a world where rival and mutually incompatible world views found themselves in acute conflict. This in itself is liable to provoke intellectual detachment, at least among sufficiently intelligent, sensitive, and experienced individuals. Andric's mature years pushed him further in that direction, for his youthful reliance on linguistic nationalism as a means of bridging gaps between Serb, Croat, and Moslem soon proved vain. During World War II he saw Tito lead yet another revolutionary ideal to power. But his age and temperament did not allow him to lend that movement active support. Instead, he turned his mind backward to the deeper past, probing for the roots of the conflicts that so distracted his Bosnian homeland. In youth he had repudiated the Orthodox outlook. In middle age he was compelled to abandon the expectation of his youth that\n\nlinguistic nationalism would somehow resolve social conflict in Bosnia. Just what he thought of the Communist recipe for solving ethnic and social conflicts is unclear. He definitely preferred the inclusive south Slav sympathies of Tito's movement to the narrow nationalisms of rival Serb and Croat leaders who disputed power with the Communists during the occupation years. This made him acceptable to the postwar Communist government. Yet anyone reading The Bridge on the Drina will find it hard to believe that its author thought Marxism or any other new faith could be expected to resolve long-standing national and religious conflicts. In spite of the many honors paid him by Tito's regime, it seems plausible to suggest that Andric by the 1940s had become a thoroughgoing conservative. He clearly implies that the sort of cultural transformation required\n\nto transcend Bosnia's religious and social divisions will cost a great deal, requiring the surrender of precious local peculiarities and identities. Moreover, to judge by how such changes came in the past, as Andric understands that past, the requisite cultural changes are most likely to come about, if at all, not through intelligence and good will but through force and brutal interference from without—as happened both when the Ottoman identity was implanted on the province from distant, mysterious Constantinople, and when western patterns were imposed by a no less distant and incomprehensible Vienna. Such a message cannot appeal to the youthful enthusiast who wants to make all things new and to brush away past errors. But for a person who has lived long enough to experience the persistent gap between human achievement and expectation, Andric's sensitive portrait of\n\nsocial change in distant Bosnia has revelatory force. That is the way it was. Here is human reality, stubborn, irregular, awkward, heartfelt, and ever-changing in spite of everything people can do to maintain, or to overthrow, inherited patterns of life.\n\nTRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD The customs and the minds of men alter less rapidly than the vagaries of political and ideological change. The visitor to Yugoslavia can still see the bridge on the Drina, whose fate is described in this book, though once again modernized and repaired. But he will find Višegrad itself less changed than he may expect and\n\nwill not find it hard to identify the types of Andrić's novel even under a national state and a communist administration. The Bosnian peasant faces the hazards of an egalitarian administration with the same incomprehension and imperturbability as he faced the novelties of the Austro-Hungarian occupation; he experienced the greater brutalities of the last war with the same courage and resignation as he faced those of World War I, and his relations with state controlled purchasing agencies differ mainly in degree from those of his fathers with the banks and merchants of the Višegrad market. The last war, in Bosnia especially, showed examples of horror and torment at least\n\nequal to those of Turkish times, while the idealism and fanaticism of youth, so well described in the conversations on the kapia, have only changed slightly in direction, while retaining their essential mixture of practical politics and imaginative romanticism. Dr Ivo Andrić is himself a Serb and a Bosnian. These provincial and religious subtleties are still as important in present-day Yugoslavia as they were in earlier times. But in the case of Dr Andrić they have had an effect different from that on other Yugoslav writers and politicians.\n\nInstead of intensifying the local and religious conflicts that still bedevil Yugoslavia — as was only too tragically shown during the last war—they have resulted in a deep understanding of peoples and creeds other than his own. Born near Travnik in Northern Bosnia in 1892, Dr Andrić passed much of his childhood in Višegrad. Not only is there truth, insight and sympathy in his varied range of Višegrad portraits, there is certainly also a good deal of observed and critical biography. Dr Andrić's books are almost all about Bosnia and Bosnians. But the peculiar position of Bosnia, a storm centre for\n\ncenturies on the border of the Eastern and Western worlds, saves them from the curse of detailed provincialism and gives them an interest that extends far beyond its narrow borders. It would not be too much to say that the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by\n\nGavrilo Princip at Sarajevo in 1914 was the turning point of modern history. Or Andrić's own career widened the field of his observations and his sympathies in a manner possible only in a vigorously growing society and a\n\ncentury of conflict. He studied first at Sarajevo and later at the universities of Zagreb, Vienna, Cracow and Graz, where he took his degree. Of a poor artisan family, he made his way largely through his own ability. As other gifted students of his race and time, and as his own students in The Bridge on the Drina, he belonged to the National Revolutionary Youth Organization, and experienced the customary cycle of persecution and arrest. After the First World War he entered the Yugoslav diplomatic service and served in Rome, Bucharest, Trieste and Graz. At the outbreak of World War II he was Yugoslav Minister in Berlin, when Yugoslavia was desperately playing for\n\ntime, hoping to postpone the invasion of Hitler and at the same time consolidate her forces to resist it when it inevitably came. I recall waiting tensely in Belgrade for Dr Andrić to return from Berlin, the one sure sign that an invasion was immediate. He came back only a few hours before the first bombs fell on Belgrade. My only contact with him was when the Yugoslav Government was already in flight. During the war, Dr Andrić lived in retirement in Belgrade, and during the German occupation took no part in public affairs. Therein we are the gainers, for at that time he wrote his\n\nmost important works, including what may be called his Bosnian trilogy: Miss, The Travnik Chronicle and, the greatest of them all, The Bridge on the Drina. The experiences of the war and the German occupation gave Dr Andrić sympathy with the Yugoslav Liberation Movement. Since the war, he has been associated with it and has been a member of the National Assembly for many years. The Bridge on the Drina is not a novel in the usual sense of the word. Its scope is too vast, its characters too numerous, its period of action too long; it covers\n\nthree and a half centuries. Dr Andrić himself calls it a chronicle; let us accept his word. It has been awarded the highest literary award of post-war Yugoslavia and has been translated into several languages. It is always an invidious task for a translator to comment on an author's style. It should be —and I hope it is — evident in the translation. Andrić's style has the sweep and surge of the sea, slow and yet profound, with occasional flashes of wit and irony. One subtlety cannot, however, be conveyed in translation; his use of varying dialects\n\nand localisms. I have conveyed them in the best manner that I\n\ncould, since a literal use of dialect would, even were it possible, be pedantic, dull and cumbersome. For the information of purists, the occasional Turkish words that are used are used in their Bosnian sense and spelling which often differs considerably from modern literary Turkish. LOVETT F. EDWARDS\n\nNOTE on the pronunciation of Serbo-\n\nCroat names Andrić's novel is published both in the Cyrillic and Latin (Croat) alphabets. I have used the Croatian spelling throughout. The language is strictly phonetic. One sound is almost always designated by one letter or (in Croat) combination of letters. Generally speaking, the foreigner cannot go far wrong if he uses 'continental' vowels and English consonants, with the following exceptions: is always ts, as in cats.\n\nč is ch as in church. ć is similar but softer, as t in the Cockney pronunciation of tube. Many family names end in ć. For practical purposes, the foreigner may regard č and ć as the same. dj is the English j in judge —the English j in fact. dž is practically the same, but harder. It is usually found in words of Turkish origin. j is always soft, the English y.\n\nr is sometimes a vowel, strongly rolled. Hence such strange looking words as vrh (summit), š is sh as in shake. ž is zh as z in azure. Other variations do not occur in this book. In a few cases I have left the conventionally accepted English spelling, instead of insisting pedantically on Serbo-Croat versions: e.g. San jak (Serbo-Croat: Sandžak), Belgrade (Serbo-Croat: Beograd), etc. In the case of purely Turkish names, I have sometimes transliterated them\n\nphonetically, as the Croat version is equally arbitrary. The use of the original names retains dignity and flavour. Attempts to adapt them to English phonetics (in itself an ungrateful task) results in such monstrosities as Ts(e)rnche —for Crnče. LOVETT F. EDWARDS\n\nI For the greater part of its course the river Drina flows through narrow gorges between steep mountains or through\n\ndeep ravines with precipitous banks. In a few places only the river banks spread out to form valleys with level or rolling stretches of fertile land suitable for cultivation and settlement on both sides. Such a place exists here at Višegrad, where the Drina breaks out in a sudden curve from the deep and narrow ravine formed by the Butkovo rocks and the Uzavnik mountains. The curve which the Drina makes here is particularly sharp and the mountains on both sides are so steep and so close together that they look like a solid mass out of which the river flows directly as from a dark wall. Then the mountains suddenly widen into an irregular amphitheatre whose widest extent is not more than about ten miles as\n\nthe crow flies. Here, where the Drina flows with the whole force of its green and foaming waters from the apparently closed mass of the dark steep mountains, stands a great clean-cut stone bridge with eleven wide sweeping arches. From this bridge spreads fanlike the whole rolling valley with the little oriental town of Višegrad and all its surroundings, with hamlets nestling in the folds of the hills, covered with meadows, pastures and plumorchards, and criss-crossed with walls and fences and dotted with shaws and occasional clumps of evergreens. Looked at from a distance through the\n\nbroad arches of the white bridge it seems as if one can see not only the green Drina, but all that fertile and cultivated countryside and the southern sky above. On the right bank of the river, starting from the bridge itself, lay the centre of the town, with the market-place, partly on the level and partly on the hillside. On the other side of the bridge, along the left bank, stretched the Maluhino Polje, with a few scattered houses along the road which led to Sarajevo. Thus the bridge, uniting the two parts of the Sarajevo road, linked the town with its surrounding villages.\n\nActually, to say 'linked' was just as true as to say that the sun rises in the morning so that men may see around them and finish\n\ntheir daily tasks, and sets in the evening that they may be able to sleep and rest from the labours of the day. For this great stone bridge, a rare structure of unique beauty, such as many richer and busier towns do not possess ('There are only two others such as this in the whole Empire/ they used to say in olden times) was the one real and permanent crossing in the whole middle and upper course of the Drina and an indispensable link on\n\nthe road between Bosnia and Serbia and further, beyond Serbia, with other parts of the Turkish Empire, all the way to Stambul. The town and its outskirts were only the settlements which always and inevitably grow up around an important centre of communications and on either side of great and important bridges. Here also in time the houses crowded together and the settlements multiplied at both ends of the bridge. The town owed its existence to the bridge and grew out of it as if from an imperishable root. In order to see a picture of the town and understand it and its relation to the\n\nbridge clearly, it must be said that there was another bridge in the town and another river. This was the river Rzav, with a wooden bridge across it. At the very end of the town the Rzav flows into the Drina, so that the centre and at the same time the main part of the town lay on a sandy tongue of land between two rivers, the great and the small, which met there and its scattered outskirts stretched out from both sides of the bridges, along the left bank of the Drina and the right bank of the Rzav. It was a town on the» water. But even though another river existed and another bridge, the words 'on the bridge' never meant on the Rzav bridge, a simple wooden structure without beauty and without\n\nhistory, that had no reason for its existence save to serve the townspeople and their animals as a crossing, but only and uniquely the stone bridge over the Drina. The bridge was about two hundred and fifty paces long and about ten paces wide save in the middle where it widened out into two completely equal terraces placed symmetrically on either side of the roadway and making it twice its normal width. This was the part of the bridge known as the kapia. Two buttresses had been built on each side of the central pier which had been splayed out towards the top, so that to right and\n\nleft of the roadway there were two terraces daringly and harmoniously projecting outwards from the straight line of the bridge over the noisy green waters far below. The two terraces were about five paces long and the same in width and were bordered, as was the whole length of the bridge, by a stone parapet. Otherwise, they were open and uncovered. That on the right as one came from the town was called the sofa. It was raised by\n\ntwo steps and bordered by benches for which the parapet served as a back; steps, benches and parapet were all\n\nmade of the same shining stone. That on the left, opposite the sola, was similar but without benches. In the middle of the parapet, the stone rose higher than a man and in it, near the top, was inserted a plaque of white marble with a rich Turkish inscription, a tarih, with a carved chronogram which told in thirteen verses the name of the man who built the bridge and the year in which it was built. Near the foot of this stone was a fountain, a thin stream of water flowing from the mouth of a stone snake. On this part of the terrace a coffeemaker had installed himself with his copper vessels and Turkish cups and ever-lighted charcoal brazier, and an apprentice who took the coffee over the\n\nway to the guests on the sofa. Such was the kapia. On the bridge and its kapia, about it or in connection with it, flowed and developed, as we shall see, the life of the townsmen. In all tales about personal, family or public events the words 'on the bridge' could always be heard. Indeed on the bridge over the Drina were the first steps of childhood and the first games of boyhood. The Christian children, born on the left bank of the Drina, crossed the bridge at once in the first days of their lives, for they were always taken across in their\n\nfirst week to be christened. But all the other children, those who were born on the right bank and the Moslem children who were not christened at all, passed, as had once their fathers and their grandfathers, the main part of their childhood on or around the bridge. They fished around it or hunted doves under its arches. From their very earliest years, their eyes grew accustomed to the lovely lines of this great stone structure built of shining porous stone, regularly and faultlessly cut. They knew all the bosses and concavities of the masons, as well as all the tales and legends associated with the existence and building of the bridge, in which reality and imagination, waking and dream,\n\nwere wonderfully and inextricably mingled. They had always known these things as if they had come into the world with them, even as they knew their prayers, but could not remember from whom they had learnt them nor when they had first heard them. They knew that the bridge had been built by the Grand Vezir, Mehmed Pasha, who had been born in the nearby village of Sokolovići, just on the far side of one of those mountains which encircled the bridge and the town. Only a Vezir could have given all that was needed to build this lasting wonder of stone (a Vezir— to the children's minds that was\n\nsomething fabulous, immense, terrible and far from clear). It was built by Rade the Mason, who must have lived for hundreds of years to have been able to build all that was lovely\n\nand lasting in the Serbian lands, that legendary and in fact nameless master whom all people desire and dream of, since they do not want to have to remember or be indebted to too many, even in memory. They knew that the vila of the boatmen had hindered its building, as always and everywhere there is someone to hinder building, destroying by night what had been built by day, until\n\n'something' had whispered from the waters and counselled Rade the Mason to find two infant children, twins, brother and sister, named Stoja and Ostoja, and wall them into the central pier of the bridge. A reward was promised to whoever found them and brought them hither. At last the guards found such twins, still at the breast, in a distant village and the Vezir's men took them away by force; but when they were taking them away, their mother would not be parted from them and, weeping and wailing, insensible to blows and to curses, stumbled after them as far as Višegrad\n\nitself, where she succeeded in forcing her way to Rade the Mason. The children were walled into the pier, for it could not be otherwise, but Rade, they say, had pity on them and left openings in the pier through which the unhappy mother could feed her sacrificed children. Those are the finely carved blind windows, narrow as loopholes, in which the wild doves now nest. In memory of that, the mother's milk has flowed from those walls for hundreds of years. That is the thin white stream which, at certain times of year, flows from that faultless masonry and leaves an indelible mark on the stone.\n\n(The idea of woman's milk stirs in the childish mind a feeling at once too intimate and too close, yet at the same time vague and mysterious like Vezirs and masons, which disturbs and repulses them.) Men scrape those milky traces off the piers and sell them as medicinal powder to women who have no milk after giving birth. In the central pier of the bridge, below the kapia, there is a larger opening, a long narrow gateway without gates, like a gigantic loophole. In that pier, they say, is a great room, a gloomy hall, in which a black Arab lives. All the children know this. In their dreams and\n\nin their fancies he plays a great role. If he should appear to anyone, that man must die. Not a single child has seen him yet, for children do not die. But Hamid, the asthmatic porter, with bloodshot eyes, continually drunk or suffering from a hangover, saw him one night and that very same night he died, over there by the wall. It is true that he was blind drunk at the time and passed the night on the bridge under the open sky in a temperature of — 15°C. The children used to gaze from the bank into that dark opening as into a gulf which is both terrible and fascinating. They would agree to look at it without blinking and whoever first saw anything should cry out. Open-mouthed\n\nthey would peer into that deep dark hole, quivering with curiosity and fear, until it seemed to some anaemic child that the opening began to sway and to move like a black curtain, or until one of them, mocking and inconsiderate (there is always at least one such), shouted 'The Arab' and pretended to run away. That spoilt the game and aroused disillusion and indignation amongst those who loved the play of imagination, hated irony and believed that by looking intently they could actually see and feel something. At night, in their sleep, many of them would toss and fight with the\n\nArab from the bridge as with fate until their mother woke them and so freed them from this nightmare. Then she would give them cold water to drink 'to chase away the fear' and make them say the name of God, and the child, overtaxed with daytime childish games, would fall asleep again into the deep sleep of childhood where terrors can no longer take shape or last for long. Up river from the bridge, in the steep banks of grey chalk, on both sides of the river, can be seen rounded hollows, always in pairs at regular intervals, as if cut in the stone were the hoofprints of some horse of supernatural size; they led\n\ndownwards from the Old Fortress, descended the scarp towards the river and then appeared again on the farther bank, where they were lost in the dark earth and undergrowth. The children who fished for tiddlers all day in the summer along these stony banks knew that these were hoofprints of ancient days and long dead warriors. Great heroes lived on earth in those days, when the stone had not yet hardened and was soft as the earth and the horses, like the warriors, were of colossal growth. Only for the Serbian children these were the prints of the hooves of Sarac, the horse of Kraljević\n\nMarko, which had remained there from the time when Kraljević Marko himself was in prison up there in the Old Fortress and escaped, flying down the slope and leaping the Drina, for at that time there was no bridge. But the Turkish children knew that it had not been Kraljević Marko, nor could it have been (for whence could a bastard Christian dog have had such strength or such a horse!) any but Djerzelez Alija on his winged charger which, as everyone knew, despised ferries and ferrymen and leapt over rivers as if they were watercourses. They did not even squabble about this, so convinced were both sides in their own belief. And there was never an instance of any one of them\n\nbeing able to convince another, or that any one had changed his belief. In these depressions which were round and as wide and deep as rather large soup-bowls, water still remained long after rain, as though in stone vessels. The children called these pits, filled with\n\ntepid rainwater, wells and, without distinction of faith, kept the tiddlers there which they caught on their lines. On the left bank, standing alone, immediately above the road, there was a\n\nfairly large earthen barrow, formed of some kind of hard earth, grey and almost like stone. On it nothing grew or blossomed save some short grass, hard and prickly as barbed wire. That tumulus was the end and frontier of all the children's games around the bridge. That was the spot which at one time was called Radisav's tomb. They used to tell that he was some sort of Serbian hero, a man of power. When the Vezir, Mehmed Pasha, had first thought of building the bridge on the Drina and sent his men here, everyone submitted and was summoned to forced labour. Only this man, Radisav, stirred up the people to revolt and told the Vezir not to continue with this work for he would meet with\n\ngreat difficulties in building a bridge across the Drina. And the Vezir had many troubles before he succeeded in overcoming Radisav for he was a man greater than other men; there was no rifle or sword that could harm him, nor was there rope or chain that could bind him. He broke all of them like thread, so great was the power of the talisman that he had with him. And who knows what might have happened and whether the Vezir would ever have been able to build the bridge, had he not found some of his men who were wise and skilful, who bribed and questioned Radisav's servant. Then they took Radisav by surprise and drowned him while he was\n\nasleep, binding him with silken ropes for against silk hist talisman could not help him. The Serbian women believe that there is one night of the year when a strong white light can be seen falling on that tumulus direct from heaven; and that takes place sometime in autumn between the greater and lesser feasts of the Virgin. But the children who, torn between belief and unbelief, remained on vigil by the windows overlooking Radisav's tomb have never managed to see this heavenly fire, for they were all overcome by sleep before midnight came. But there had been travellers, who knew nothing of this, who had seen a white light falling on the tumulus above the bridge as they returned to the town\n\nby night. The Turks in the town, on the other hand, have long told that on that spot a certain dervish, by name Sheik Turhanija, died as a martyr to the faith. He was a great hero and defended on this spot the crossing of the Drina against an infidel army. And that on this spot there is neither memorial nor tomb, for such was the wish of the dervish himself, for he wanted to be buried without mark or sign, so that no one should know who was there. For, if ever again some infidel army should invade by this route, then he would arise from under his tumulus and hold them in check, as he\n\nhad once done, so\n\nthat they should be able to advance no farther than the bridge at Višegrad. And therefore heaven now and again shed its light upon his tomb. Thus the life of the children of the town was played out under and about the bridge in innocent games and childish fancies. With the first years of maturity, when life's cares and struggles and duties had already begun, this life was transferred to the bridge itself, right to the kapia, where youthful imagination found other food and new fields.\n\nAt and around the kapia were the first stirrings of love, the first passing glances, flirtations and whisperings. There too were the first deals and bargains, quarrels and reconciliations, meetings and waitings. There, on the stone parapet of the bridge, were laid out for sale the first cherries and melons, the early morning salep and hot rolls. There too gathered the beggars, the maimed and the lepers, as well as the young and healthy who wanted to see and be seen, and all those who had something remarkable to show in produce, clothes or weapons. There too the elders of the town often sat to discuss public matters and common\n\ntroubles, but even more often young men who only knew how to sing and joke. There, on great occasions or times of change, were posted proclamations and public notices (on the raised wall below the marble plaque with the Turkish inscription and above the fountain), but there too, right up to 1878, hung or were exposed on stakes the heads of all those who for whatever reason had been executed, and executions in that frontier town, especially in years of unrest, were frequent and in some years, as we shall see, almost of daily occurrence. Weddings or funerals could not cross the bridge without stopping at the kapia.\n\nThere the wedding guests would usually preen themselves and get into their ranks before entering the market-place. If the times were peaceful and carefree they would hand the plum-brandy around, sing, dance the kolo and often delay there far longer than they had intended. And for funerals, those who carried the bier would put it down to rest for a little there on the kapia where the dead man had in any case passed a good part of his life. The kapia was the most important part of the bridge, even as the bridge was the most important part of the town, or as a Turkish traveller, to whom the people of\n\nVišegrad had been very hospitable, wrote in his account of his travels: 'their kapia is the heart of the bridge, which is the heart of the town, which must remain in everyone's heart'. It showed that the old masons, who according to the old tales had struggled with vilas and every sort of wonder and had been compelled to wall up living children, had a feeling not only for\n\nthe permanence and beauty of their work but also for the benefit and convenience which the most distant generations were to derive from it. When one knows well everyday life here in the town and thinks\n\nit over carefully, then one must say to oneself that there are really only a very small number of people in this Bosnia of ours who have so much pleasure and enjoyment as does each and every townsman on the kapia. Naturally winter should not be taken into account, for then only whoever was forced tp do so would cross the bridge, and then he would lengthen his pace and bend his head before the chill wind that blew uninterruptedly over the river. Then, it was understood, there was no loitering on the open terraces of the kapia. But at every other time of year the kapia was a real boon for great and\n\nsmall. Then every citizen could, at any time of day or night, go out to the kapia and sit on the sola, or hang about it on business or in conversation. Suspended some fifteen metres above the green boisterous waters, this stone sola floated in space over the water, with dark green hills on three sides, the heavens, filled with clouds or stars, above and the open view down river like a narrow amphitheatre bounded by the dark blue mountains behind. How many Vezirs or rich men are there in the world who could indulge their joy or their cares, their moods or their delights in such a spot? Few, very few.\n\nBut how many of our townsmen have, in the course of centuries and the passage of generations, sat here in the dawn or twilight or evening hours and unconsciously measured the whole starry vault above! Many and many of us have sat there, head in hands, leaning on the well-cut smooth stone, watching the eternal play of light on the mountains and the clouds in the sky, and have unravelled the threads of our small-town destinies, eternally the same yet eternally tangled in some new manner. Someone affirmed long ago (it is true that he was a foreigner and spoke in jest) that this kapia had had an influence on the fate of the town and even on the character of its citizens. In those endless\n\nsessions, the stranger said, one must search for the key to the inclination of many of our townsmen to reflection and dreaming and one of the main reasons for that melancholic serenity for which the inhabitants of the town are renowned. In any case, it cannot be denied that the people of Višegrad have from olden times been considered, in comparison with the people of other towns, as easygoing men, prone to pleasure and free with their money. Their town is well placed, the villages around it are rich and fertile, and money, it is true, passes in abundance through Višegrad, but it\n\ndoes not stay there long. If one finds there some thrifty and\n\neconomical citizen without any sort of vices, then he is certainly some newcomer; but the waters and the air of Višegrad are such that his children grow up with open hands and widespread fingers and fall victims to the general contagion of the spendthrift and carefree life of the town with its motto: 'Another day another gain.' They tell the tale that Starina Novak, when he felt his strength failing and was compelled to give up his role as\n\nhighwayman in the Romania Mountains, thus taught the young man Grujić who was to succeed him: 'When you are sitting in ambush look well at the traveller who comes. If you see that he rides proudly and that he wears a red corselet and silver bosses and white gaiters, then he is from Foča. Strike at once, for he has wealth both on him and in his saddlebags. If you see a poorly dressed traveller, with bowed head, hunched on his horse as if he were going out to beg, then strike freely, for he is a man of Rogatica. They are all alike, misers and tight-fisted but as full of money as a pomegranate. But if you see\n\nsome mad fellow, with legs crossed over the saddlebow, beating on a drum and singing at the top of his voice, don't strike and do not soil your hands for nothing. Let the rascal go his way. He is from Višegrad and he has nothing, for money does not stick to such men.' All this goes to confirm the opinion of that foreigner. But none the less it would be hard to say with certainty that this opinion is correct. As in so many other things, here too it is not easy to determine what is cause and what effect. Has the kapia made them what they are, or on the contrary was it imagined in their souls and understandings and built\n\nfor them according to their needs and customs? It is a vain and superfluous question. There are no buildings that have been built by chance, remote from the human society where they have grown and its needs, hopes and understandings, even as there are no arbitrary lines and motiveless forms in the work of the masons. The life and existence of every great, beautiful and useful building, as well as its relation to the place where it has been built, often bears within itself complex and mysterious drama and history. However, one thing is clear; that between the life of the townsmen and that bridge, there existed a centuries-old bond. Their fates were so intertwined that they could not\n\nbe imagined separately and could not be told separately. Therefore the story of the foundation and destiny of the bridge is at the same time the story of the life of the town and of its people, from generation to generation, even as through all the tales about the town stretches the line of the stone bridge with its eleven arches and the kapia in the middle, like a crown.\n\nII Now we must go back to the time when there was not even a thought of a bridge at that spot, let alone such a bridge as\n\nthis. Perhaps even in those far-off times, some traveller passing this way, tired and drenched, wished that by some miracle this wide and turbulent river were bridged, so that he could reach his goal more easily and quickly. For there is no doubt that men had always, ever since they first travelled here and overcame the obstacles along the way, thought how to make a crossing at this spot, even as all travellers at all times have dreamed of a good road, safe travelling companions and a warm inn. Only not every wish bears fruit, nor has everyone the will and the power to turn his dreams into reality.\n\nThe first idea of the bridge, which was destined to be realized, flashed, at first naturally confused and foggy, across the imagination of a ten year old boy from the nearby village of Sokolovići, one morning in 1516 when he was being taken along the road from his village to far-off, shining and terrible Stambul. Then this same green and awe-inspiring Drina, this mountain river 'which often grew angry', clamoured there between barren and naked, stony and sandy banks. The town even then existed, but in another form and of different dimensions. On the right bank of the river, on the crest of a precipitous hill,\n\nwhere now there are ruins, rose the well preserved Old Fortress, with widespread fortifications dating from the time of the flowering of the Bosnian kingdom, with casements and ramparts, the work of one of the powerful Pavlović nobles. On the slopes below this fortress and under its protection stood the Christian settlements, Mejdan and Bikovac, and the recently converted Turkish hamlet of Dušče. Down on the level ground between the Drina and the Rzav, where the real town later spread, were only the town meadows, with a road running through them, beside which was an old-fashioned inn and a few huts and water-mills.\n\nWhere the Drina intersected the road was the famous Višegrad ferry. That was a black old-fashioned ferryboat and on it a surly, slow old ferryman called Jamak, whom it was harder to summon when awake than any other man from the deepest sleep. He was a man of giant stature and extraordinary strength, but he had suffered in the many wars in which he had won renown. He had only one eye, one ear and one leg (the other was wooden). Without greeting and without a smile, he would moodily ferry across goods and passengers in his own good time, but honestly and safely, so that tales were told of his reliability and his\n\nhonesty as often as of his slowness and obstinacy. He would not talk with the passengers whom he took across nor would he touch them. Men threw the copper coins that they paid for the crossing into the bottom of the black boat where they lay all day in the sand and water, and only in the evening would the ferryman collect them carelessly in the wooden scoop which he used to bale out the boat and take them to his hut on the river bank. The ferry only worked when the current and height of the river were normal or a little higher than normal, but as soon as the river ran cloudy or rose above\n\ncertain limits, Jamak hauled out his clumsy bark, moored it firmly in a backwater and the Drina remained as impassable as the greatest of oceans. Jamak then became deaf even in his one sound ear or simply went up to the Fortress to work in his field. Then, all day long, there could be seen travellers coming from Bosnia who stood on the farther bank in desperation, frozen and drenched, vainly watching the ferry and the ferryman and from time to time yelling long drawn summonses: 'O-o-o-o-o.... Jama-a-a-k....' No one would reply and no one would\n\nappear until the waters fell, and that moment was decided by Jamak himself, dark and unrelenting, without discussion or explanation. The town, which was then little more than a hamlet, stood on the right bank of the Drina on the slopes of the steep hill below the ruins of the one-time fortress, for then it did not have the size and shape it was to have later when the bridge was built and communications and trade developed. On that November day a long convoy of laden horses arrived on the left back of the river and halted there to spend the\n\nnight. The aga of the janissaries, with armed escort, was returning to Stambul after collecting from the villages of eastern Bosnia the appointed number of Christian children for the blood tribute. It was already the sixth year since the last collection of this tribute of blood, and so this time the choice had been easy and rich;\n\nthe necessary number of healthy, bright and good-looking lads between ten and fifteen years old had been found without difficulty, even though many parents had hidden their children in the forests,\n\ntaught them how to appear half-witted, clothed them in rags and let them get filthy, to avoid the aga's choice. Some went so far as to maim their own children, cutting off one of their fingers with an axe. The chosen children were laden on to little Bosnian horses in a long convoy. On each horse were two plaited panniers, like those for fruit, one on each side, and in every pannier was put a child, each with a small bundle and a round cake, the last thing they were to take from their parents' homes. From these panniers, which balanced and creaked in unison, peered out the fresh and frightened faces of the kidnapped children. Some of them gazed calmly across the horses' cruppers, looking as\n\nlong as they could at their native land, others ate and wept at the same time, while others slept with heads resting on the pack-saddles. A little way behind the last horses in that strange convoy straggled, dishevelled and exhausted, many parents and relatives of those children who were being carried away for ever to a foreign world, where they would be circumcized, become Turkish and, forgetting their faith, their country and their origin, would pass their lives in the ranks of the janissaries or in some other, higher, service of the Empire. They were for the most part women, mothers,\n\ngrandmothers and sisters of the stolen children. When they came too close, the aga's horsemen would drive them away with whips, urging their horses at them with loud cries to Allah. Then they would fly in all directions and hide in the forests along the roadsides, only to gather again a little later behind the convoy and strive with tear-filled eyes to see once again over the panniers the heads of the children who were being taken from them. The mothers were especially persistent and hard to restrain. Some would rush forward not looking where they were going, with bare breasts, and\n\ndishevelled hair, forgetting everything about them, wailing and lamenting as at a burial, while others almost out of their minds moaned as if their wombs were being torn by birth-pangs, and blinded with tears ran right on to the horsemen's whips and replied to every blow with the fruitless question: 'Where are you taking him? Why are you taking him from me?' Some tried to speak clearly to their children and to give them some last part of themselves, as much as might be said in a couple of words, some recommendation or advice for the way___\n\n'Rade, my son, don't forget your mother....' 'Ilija, Ilija, Ilija!' screamed another woman, searching desperately\n\nwith her glances for the dear wellknown head and repeating this incessantly as if she wished to carve into the child's memory that name which would in a day or two be taken from him forever. But the way was long, the earth hard, the body weak and the Osmanlis powerful and pitiless. Little by little the women\n\ndropped back exhausted by the march and the blows, and one after the other abandoned their vain effort. Here, at the Višegrad ferry, even the most enduring had to halt for they were not allowed on the ferry and were unable to cross the water. Now they could sit in peace on the bank and weep, for no one persecuted them any longer. There they waited as if turned to stone and sat, insensible to hunger, thirst and cold, until on the farther bank of the river they could see once more the long drawn out convoy of horses and riders as it moved onward towards Dubrina, and tried once more to catch a last glimpse of the children who were disappearing from their sight.\n\nOn that November day in one of those countless panniers a dark-skinned boy of about ten years old from the mountain village of Sokolovići sat silent and looked about him with dry eyes. In a chilled and reddened hand he held a small curved knife with which he absent-mindedly whittled at the edges of his pannier, but at the same time looked about him. He was to remember that stony bank overgrown with sparse, bare and dull grey willows, the surly ferryman and the dry water-mill full of draughts and spiders' webs where they had to spend the night before it was possible to transport all of them across\n\nthe troubled waters of the Drina over which the ravens were croaking. Somewhere within himself he felt a sharp stabbing pain which from time to time seemed suddenly to cut his chest in two and hurt terribly, which was always associated with the memory of that place where the road broke off, where desolation and despair were extinguished and remained on the stony banks of the river, across which the passage was so difficult, so expensive and so unsafe. It was here, at this particularly painful spot in that hilly and poverty-stricken district, in which misfortune was open and evident, that man was halted by powers stronger than he and, ashamed of his powerlessness,\n\nwas forced to recognize more clearly his own misery and that of others, his own backwardness and that of others. All this was summed up in that physical discomfort that the boy felt on that November day and which never completely left him, though he changed his way of life, his faith, his name and his country. What this boy in the pannier was later to become has been told\n\nin all histories in all languages and is better known in the world outside than it\n\nis amongst us. In time he became a young and brave officer at the Sultan's court, then Great Admiral of the Fleet, then the Sultan's son-in-law, a general and statesman of world renown, Mehmed Pasha Sokolli, who waged wars that were for the most part victorious on three continents and extended the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, making it safe abroad and by good administration consolidated it from within. For these sixty odd years he served three Sultans, experienced both good and evil as only rare and chosen persons may experience them, and raised himself to heights of power and authority unknown to us, which few men reach and few men keep. This new man that he had\n\nbecome in a foreign world where we could not follow even in our thoughts, must have forgotten all that he had left behind in the country whence they had once brought him. He surely forgot too the crossing of the Drina at Višegrad, the bare banks on which travellers shivered with cold and uncertainty, the slow and worm-eaten ferry, the strange ferryman, and the hungry ravens above the troubled waters. But that feeling of discomfort which had remained in him had never completely disappeared. On the other hand, with years and with age it appeared more and more often; always the same black pain which cut into his breast with that special well-known\n\nchildhood pang which was clearly distinguishable from all the ills and pains that life later brought to him. With closed eyes, the Vezir would wait until that black knife-like pang passed and the pain diminished. In one of those moments he thought that he might be able to free himself from this discomfort if he could do away with that ferry on the distant Drina, around which so much misery and inconvenience gathered and increased incessantly, and bridge the steep banks and the evil water between them, join the two ends of the road which was broken by the Drina and thus link safely and for ever Bosnia and the East, the place of his origin and the places of his life. Thus it was he who\n\nfirst, in a single moment behind closed eyelids, saw the firm graceful silhouette of the great stone bridge which was to be built there. That very same year, by the Vezir's order and at the Vezir's expense, the building of the great bridge on the Drina began. It lasted five years. That must have been an exceptionally lively and important time for the town and the whole district, full of change and of events great and small. But for a wonder, in the town which remembered for centuries and discussed every sort of event, including all those directly connected with the bridge, not many\n\ndetails of the commencement of the operation were preserved.\n\nThe common people remember and tell of what they are able to grasp and what they are able to transform into legend. Anything else passes them by without deeper trace, with the dumb indifference of nameless natural phenomena, which do not touch the imagination or remain in the memory. This hard and long building process was for them a foreign task undertaken at another's expense. Only when, as the fruit of this effort, the great bridge arose, men began to remember details and to embroider the creation of\n\na real, skilfully built and lasting bridge with fabulous tales which they well knew how to weave and to remember.\n\nIII In the spring of that year when the Vezir had made his decision to build, his men arrived in the town to prepare everything necessary for the construction work on the bridge. There were many of them, with horses, carts, various tools and tents. All this excited fear and apprehension in the little town and the surrounding villages, especially among the Christians.\n\nAt the head of this group was Abidaga, who was responsible to the Vezir for building the bridge; with him was the mason, Tosun Effendi. (There had already been tales about this Abidaga, saying that he was a man who stopped at nothing, harsh and pitiless beyond measure.) As soon as they had settled in their tents below Mejdan, Abidaga summoned the local leaders and all the principal Turks for a discussion. But there was not much of a discussion, for only one man spoke and he was Abidaga. Those who had been summoned1 saw a powerfully built man, with green eyes and an unhealthy reddish face, dressed in rich Stambul clothes,\n\nwith a reddish beard and wonderfully upturned moustaches in the Magyar fashion. The speech which this violent man delivered to the notables astonished them even more than his appearance: 'It is more than likely that you have heard tales about me even before I came here and I know without asking that those tales could not have been pleasant or favourable. Probably you have heard that I demand work and obedience from everyone, and that I will beat and kill anyone who does not work as he should and does not obey without argument; that I do not know the meaning of \"I cannot\" or \"There isn't any\", that wherever I am heads will roll at the slightest word, and that in short I am a bloodthirsty and hard\n\nman. I want to tell you that those tales are neither imaginary nor exaggerated. Under my linden tree there is no shade. I have won this reputation over long years of service in which I have devotedly carried out the orders of the Grand Vezir. I trust in God that I shall carry out this work for which I was sent and when at the completion of the work I go hence, I hope that even harsher and darker tales will go before\n\nme than those which have already reached you.' After this unusual introduction to which\n\nall listened in silence and with downcast eyes, Abidaga explained that it was a matter of a building of great importance, such as did not exist even in richer lands, that the work would last five, perhaps six, years, but that the Vezir's will would be carried out to the fineness of a hair and punctual to a minute. Then he laid down his first requirements and what he therefore expected from the local Turks and demanded from the rayah—the Christian serfs. Beside him sat Tosun Effendi, a small, pale, yellowish renegade, born in the Greek islands, a mason who had built many of Mehmed Pasha's bequests in\n\nStambul. He remained quiet and indifferent, as if he were not hearing or did not understand Abidaga's speech. He gazed at his hands and only looked up from time to time. Then they could see his big black eyes, beautiful and shortsighted eyes with a velvety sheen, the eyes of a man who only looks to his work and does not see, does not feel and does not understand anything else in life or in the world. The notables filed out of the small stuffy tent, troubled and downcast. They felt as if they were sweating under their new ceremonial clothes and each one of them felt fear and anxiety taking root in him.\n\nA great and incomprehensible disaster had fallen upon the town and the whole of the district, a catastrophe whose end could not be foreseen. First of all began the felling of the forests and the transport of the timber. So great a mass of scaffolding arose on both banks of the Drina that for long the people thought that the bridge would be built of wood. Then the earthworks began, the excavations, the revetting of the chalky banks. These were mostly carried out by forced labour. So everything went on until the late autumn, when work was temporarily stopped and the first part of the construction completed.\n\nAll this was carried out under Abidaga's supervision and that of his long green staff which has passed into legend. Whomever he pointed at with this staff, having noticed that he was malingering or not working as he should, the guards seized; they beat him on the spot and then poured water over his bleeding and unconscious body and sent him back to work again. When in late autumn Abidaga left the town, he again sent for the notables and told them that he was going away to another place for the winter, but that his eye would still be on them. All would be responsible for everything. If it were found that any part of the work had been damaged, if a\n\nsingle stick were missing from the scaffolding, he would fine the\n\nwhole town. When they ventured to say that damage might be caused by floods, he replied coldly and without hesitation that this was their district and the river too was theirs as well as whatever damage it might cause. All the winter the townsmen guarded the material and watched the construction works like the eyes in their head. And when with the spring Abidaga once again appeared, with Tosun Effendi, there came with them Dalmatian stone-\n\nmasons, whom the people called 'Latin masters'. At first there were about thirty of them, led by a certain Mastro Antonio, a Christian from Ulcinj. He was a tall, handsome man of keen eye, bold glance and hooked nose, with fair hair falling to his shoulders and dressed like a noble in the western manner. His assistant was a negro, a real negro, a young and merry man whom the whole town and all the workmen soon nicknamed 'the Arab'. If in the previous year, judging from the mass of scaffolding, it seemed as if Abidaga had intended to build the bridge of wood, it now seemed to everyone that\n\nhe wanted to build a new Stambul here on the Drina. Then began the hauling of stone from the quarries which had already been opened up in the hills near Banja, an hour's walk from the town. Next year a most unusual spring broke near the Višegrad ferry. Besides all that which sprang up and flowered every year at that time, there arose out of the earth a whole settlement of huts; new roads made their appearance and new approaches to the water's edge. Countless oxcarts and packhorses swarmed on all sides. The men from Mejdan and Okolište saw how every day, like a sort of harvest, there grew\n\nthere by the river a restless swarm of men, beasts and building material of every kind. On the steep banks worked the master stone-masons. The whole area took on a sort of yellowish colour from the stonedust. And a little farther along, on the sandy plain, local workers were slaking lime and moving, ragged and pale, through the white smoke which rose high from the kilns. The roads were torn to pieces by the overloaded carts. The ferry worked all day, taking from one bank to the other building material, overseers and workmen. Wading in the spring waters up to their waists, special\n\nworkmen drove in piles and stakes and put in position gabions filled with clay, intended to break the current. All this was watched by those who up till then had lived peacefully in their scattered houses on the slopes near the Drina ferry. And it would have been well for them had they been able only to watch, but the work soon became so extensive and its impetus so\n\ngreat that it drew into the whirlpool everything alive or dead, not only in the town but also from great distances away. With the second year the number of\n\nworkers had grown to such an extent that they equalled all the male inhabitants of the town. All carts, all horses and oxen worked only for the bridge. Everything that could creep or roll was taken and pressed into service, sometimes paid but sometimes by force. There was more money than before, but high prices and shortages increased more rapidly than the money flowed in, so that when it reached men's hands it was already half eaten away. Even worse than the rise in prices and the shortages was the unrest, disorder and insecurity which now enveloped the town as a consequence of the incursion of so many workmen from the outer world. Despite all Abidaga's severity, there were frequent clashes\n\namong the workers, and many thefts from the gardens and courtyards. The Moslem women had to keep their faces veiled even when they went into their own yards, for the gaze of the countless workers, local and foreign, might come from anywhere and the Turks of the town kept the practices of Islam very strictly, the more so since they were all recently converted and there was scarcely one of them who did not remember either a father or a grandfather who was a Christian or a recently converted Turk. Because of this the older persons who followed the law of Islam were openly indignant and turned their backs on this chaotic mass of workers, draft animals,\n\nwood, earth and stone which grew ever larger and more complicated on both sides of the ferry and which, in the underpinning operations, broke into their streets, their courtyards and their gardens. At first they had all been proud of the great bequest which the Vezir was to erect in their district. Then they had not realized, as they now saw with their own eyes, that these glorious buildings involved so much disorder and unrest, effort and expense. It was a fine thing, they thought, to belong to the pure ruling faith; it was a fine thing to have as a countryman the Vezir in Stambul, and\n\nstill finer to imagine the strong, costly bridge across the river, but what was happening now in no way resembled this. Their town had been turned into a hell, a devil's dance of incomprehensible works, of smoke, dust, shouts and tumult. The years passed, the work extended and grew greater, but there was no end or thought of end to be seen. It looked like anything you like, but not a bridge. So thought the recently converted Turks of the town and, in private among themselves, avowed that they were fed up to the teeth with lordship and pride and future glory and had had more than\n\nenough of the bridge and the Vezir. They only prayed Allah to\n\ndeliver them from this disaster and restore to them and their homes their former peace and the quietness of their humble lives beside the old-fashioned ferry on the river. All this affected the Turks, but even more it affected the Christian rayah of the whole Višegrad district, with this difference, that no one asked their opinion about anything, nor were they even able to express their indignation. It was now the third year since the people\n\nhad been on forced labour for the new bridge, they themselves and all their horses and oxen. And that too not only for the local rayah but also all those from the nearby districts. Everywhere Abidaga's guards and horsemen seized the rayah from the villages and even the towns and drove them away to work on the bridge. Usually they surprised them while sleeping and pinioned them like chickens. Through all Bosnia, traveller told traveller not to go to the Drina, for whoever went there was seized, without question of who or what he was or where he was going, and was forced to work for at least a few days. The young men in the villages tried to run away into the forests, but the guards took hostages\n\nfrom their houses, often women, in place of those who fled. This was the third autumn that the people had been forced to labour on the bridge and in no way could it be seen that the work was progressing or that the end of their misfortune was in sight. Autumn was already in full spate; the roads were breaking up from the rains, the Drina was rising and troubled, and the bare stubble full of slow-winged ravens. But Abidaga did not halt the work. Under the wan November sun the peasants dragged wood and stone, waded with bare feet or in sandals of freshly slaughtered hide along the muddy roads, sweating with\n\nstrain or chilled by the wind, folding around themselves cloaks full of new holes and old patches, and knotting up the ragged ends of their single shirts of coarse linen, blackened by rain, mud and smoke, which they dared not wash lest they fall to pieces in the water. Over all of them hovered Abidaga's green staff, for Abidaga visited both the quarries at Banja and the works around the bridge several times each day. He was filled with rage and fury against the whole world because the days were growing shorter and the work had not progressed as quickly as he wished. In a heavy surcoat of Russian fur and high boots, he climbed, with red congested face, over the scaffolding of such piers as already\n\narose from the waters, visited forges, barracks and workers' huts and swore at everyone he came across, overseers and contractors alike. 'The days are short. Always shorter. You sons of bitches, you are eating your bread for nothing!'\n\nHe burst out in fury, as if they were to blame because it dawned late and darkened early. Before twilight, that relentless and implacable Visegrad twilight, when the steep hills seemed to close in over the town and each night fell quickly, as heavy and deaf as the\n\nlast, Abidaga's fury rose to its height; and having no one left on whom to vent his wrath, he turned it on himself and could not sleep for thinking of so much work not being done and so many people malingering and wasting time. He ground his teeth. He summoned the overseers and worked out how, from then on, it would be possible to make better use of the daylight and exploit the workers more effectively. The people were sleeping in their huts and stables, resting and restoring their forces. But all did not sleep; they too knew how to keep vigil, to their own profit and in their own manner. In a dry\n\nand spacious stable a fire was burning, or more exactly had been burning, for now only a few embers glowing in the half-lit space remained. The whole stable was filled with smoke and the heavy, sour smell of wet clothes and sandals and the exhalations of about thirteen human bodies. They were all pressed men, peasants from the neighbourhood. Christian rayah. All were muddy and wet through, exhausted and careworn. They resented this unpaid and pointless forced labour while up there in the villages their fields awaited the autumn ploughing in vain. The greater number were still awake. They were drying their gaiters by the fire, plaiting sandals or only gazing at the\n\nembers. Amongst them was a certain Montenegrin, no one knew from where, whom the guards had seized on the road and had pressed for labour for several days, though he kept telling them and proving to them how wearisome and hard this work was for him and how his honour could not endure this work for slaves. Most of the wakeful peasants, especially the younger ones, gathered around him. From the deep pocket of his cloak the Montenegrin drew out a gusle, a tiny primitive fiddle, clumsy and as small as the palm of a man's hand, and a short bow. One of the peasants went outside\n\nand mounted guard before the stable lest some Turk should chance to come along. All looked at the Montenegrin as if they saw him for the first time and at the gusle which seemed to disappear in his huge hands. He bent over, the gusle in his lap, and pressed its head under his chin, greased the string with resin and breathed heavily on the bow; everything was moist and slack. While he occupied himself with these petty tasks, calmly and self-confidently as if he were alone in the world, they all looked at him without a movement. At last the first notes wailed out, sharp and\n\nuneven. The excitement rose. The Montenegrin found the key and began to sing through his nose and accompany himself with the gusle. Everyone was intent, awaiting the wonderful tale. Then, suddenly, after he had more or less attuned his voice to the gusle, the Montenegrin threw back his head proudly and violently so that his Adam's apple stood out in his scrawny neck and his sharp profile was outlined in the firelight, and sang in a strangled and constrained voice: A-a-a-a- a-a-a-a- and then all at once in a clear and ringing tone: 'The Serbian Tsar Stefan\n\nDrank wine in fertile Prizren, By him sat the old patriarchs. Four of them, the old patriarchs; Next them were nine bishops And a score of three-tailed Vezirs And the ranks of Serbian nobles. Wine was served by Michael the cup-bearer And on the breast of his sister Kandosia Shone the light of precious stones. . . .'\n\nThe peasants pressed closer and closer\n\naround the singer but without making the slightest noise; their very breathing could be heard. They half closed their eyes, carried away with wonder. Thrills ran up and down their spines, their backs straightened up, their breasts expanded, their eyes shone, their fingers opened and shut and their jaw muscles tightened. The Montenegrin developed his melody more and more rapidly, even more beautiful and bolder, while the wet and sleepless workmen, carried away and insensible to all else, followed the tale as if it were their own more beautiful and more glorious destiny. Among the countless peasants pressed\n\nfor hard labour was a certain Radisav from Unište, a small village quite close to the town. He was a smallish man, dark-faced, with restless eyes, a little bent, and walked quickly, spreading out his legs and moving his head and shoulders from left to right, right to left, as if sowing wheat. He was not as poor as he appeared to be, nor as simple as he made himself out. His family were known as the Heraci; they had good land and there were many males in the house, but almost the whole village had been converted to Islam over the past forty years so that they were lonely and isolated. This small, bowed Radisav had been scurrying about from one stable to the next these autumn nights 'sowing'\n\nrevolt and had insinuated himself among the peasants like an eel, whispering and counselling with one only at a time. What he said was roughly this: 'Brother, we have had enough of this. We must defend ourselves.\n\nYou can see for yourself that this building work will be the death of all of us; it will eat us all up. Even our children will have to do forced labour on the bridge, if there are any of us left. For us this work means extermination and nothing less. A bridge is no good to the poor and to the rayah, but only for\n\nthe Turks; we can neither raise armies nor carry on trade. For us the ferry is more than enough. So a few of us have agreed among ourselves to go by night, at the darkest hour, and break down and spoil as much as possible of what has been done, and to spread the rumour that it is a vila, a fairy, who is destroying the works at the bridge and who does not want any bridge over the Drina. We shall see if this will be of any help. We have no other way and something must be done.' There were, as always, some who were fainthearted and unreliable, who thought this to be a sterile idea; since the\n\ncunning and powerful Turks would not be turned away from their intention they would have to do forced labour even longer since God so willed. They should not make bad worse. But there were also those who felt that anything was better than to go on slaving and to wait until even the last rag of clothing fell from a man and the last ounce of strength be wasted by the heavy labour and Abidaga's short commons; and that they must follow anyone who was willing to go to extremes. These were for the most part young men, but there were also serious married men, with families, who agreed, though without enthusiasm or fire, and who said worriedly:\n\n'Come and let's break it down; may his blood eat him up before he eats us up. And if that does not help....' And at that point they waved their hands in desperate resolution. So in these first autumn days the rumour began to spread, first among the workers and then in the town itself, that the vila of the waters had intervened in the work on the bridge, that she destroyed and pulled down overnight what had been built by day and that the whole scheme would come to nothing. At the same time, inexplicable damage began to appear over night in the revetments and\n\neven in the masonry itself. The tools which the masons had up till then left on the piers began to get lost and disappear, the revetments to break down and be carried away by the waters. The rumour that the bridge would never be finished spread far afield. Both Turks and Christians spread it and little by little it took form as a firm belief. The Christian rayah were jubilant, whispering it stealthily and soundlessly but from a full heart. The local Turks, who had earlier looked on the Vezir's building work with pride, began to wink disdainfully and wave their hands. Many of the converted Turks who, in changing\n\nfaith, had not found what they had\n\nhoped for, but had continued to sit down to a meagre supper and go about with patched elbows, heard the rumour and repeated with enjoyment the story of the great lack of success and found some sort of proud satisfaction in the thought that not even Vezirs could carry out everything they had a mind to do. It was already being said that the foreign maestri were preparing to leave and that there would be no bridge there where no bridge had ever been before and where it should never have been begun. All these tales blended and spread quickly.\n\nThe common people easily make up fables and spread them quickly, wherein reality is strangely and inextricably mixed and interwoven with legend. The peasants who listened at night to the gusle player said that the vila who was destroying the bridge had told Abidaga that she would not cease her work of destruction until twin children, Stoja and Ostoja by name, should be walled into the foundations. Many swore that they had seen the guards who were searching for such a pair of children in the villages (the guards were indeed going around the villages but they were not looking for children but listening for rumours and interrogating the people in order to try\n\nand find out who were those unknown persons who were destroying the bridge). A short time before, it had happened that in a village above Višegrad a poor stuttering half-witted girl, who was a servant, became pregnant, she herself would not say, or could not say, by whom!. It was a rare and almost unheard of event that a girl, and such a girl, should conceive and still more so that the father should remain unknown. The story was noised far abroad. In good time the girl gave birth, in some stable or other, to twins, both stillborn. The women from the village who helped her\n\nat the birth, which was exceptionally difficult, at once buried the children in a plum orchard. But on the third day after, the unfortunate mother got up and began to look for her children everywhere in the village. In vain they explained to her that the children had been born dead and had been buried. Finally, in order to be rid of her incessant questionings, they told her, or rather explained to her by gestures, that her children had been taken away to the town, down there where the Turks were building the bridge. Weak and distraught, she wandered down into the town and began to range around the ferry and the construction works, looking fearfully into the eyes of the men there and asking in incomprehensible\n\nstutterings for her children. The men looked at her in amazement or drove her away so that she should not hinder them at their work. Seeing that they did not understand what she wanted, she unbuttoned her coarse peasant shift and showed them her breasts,\n\npainful and swollen, on which the nipples had already begun to crack and showed all bloody from the milk that flowed from them irresistibly. No one know how to help her and explain to her that her children had not been walled up in the bridge, for to all kind words and assurances, curses and threats, she only\n\nstuttered miserably and with sharp distrustful glances peered into every corner. Finally they gave up persecuting her and allowed her to wander about the construction work, avoiding her with a sorrowful compassion. The cooks gave her some of the workers' porridge which had got burnt at the bottom of the cauldrons. They called her mad Ilinka and, after them, the whole town did so. Even Abidaga himself passed by her without cursing her, turning his head away super-stitiously, and ordered that she be given alms. So she went on living there, a harmless idiot, by the construction works. And because of her the story remained that the Turks had walled her children into the bridge.\n\nSome believed it and others not, but none the less it was repeated all the more and noised afar. Meanwhile the damage went on, now less now more, and parallel with it the rumours spread even more obstinately that the vilas would not permit a bridge to be built across the Drina. Abidaga was furious. It enraged him that anyone could be found who dared to undertake anything against his work or his intentions despite his proverbial harshness which he cultivated as a special subject for pride. Also all these people disgusted him, the Moslems as\n\nmuch as the Christians; slow and unskilled in their work, they were quick enough for raillery and lack of respect and knew only too well how to find mocking and corrosive words for everything they did not understand or did not know how to do. He posted guards on both banks of the river. The damage to the earthworks then ceased, but damage to the construction work in the river itself continued. Only on moonlit nights was there no damage. That confirmed Abidaga, who did not believe in the vila, in his belief that this particular vila was not invisible and did not descend from on high. For a long time he would not, or could not, believe those who said it was due to peasant\n\ncunning, but now he was convinced that that was exactly what it was. And that excited him to still greater fury. But he none the less knew that he must appear calm and hide his fury if he wanted to snare these pests and finish once and for all with these tales about vilas and about stopping work on the bridge, which might become dangerous. He summoned the chief of the guards, a certain man from Plevlje, who had grown up in Stambul, a pale and unhealthy man. The two men were instinctively hostile to one another, but at the\n\nsame time were continually drawn together and came into conflict. Between them incomprehensible feelings of hatred, repulsion, fear and distrust were woven permanently. Abidaga, who was mild and pleasant towards no one, displayed an unconcealed repulsion towards this pale-faced renegade. All that he did or said drove Abidaga into a frenzy and provoked him to curse and humiliate him, but the more that the man from Plevlje abased himself and was obsequious, the greater grew Abidaga's repulsion. From the first day of their meeting the leader of the guards was superstitiously and terribly afraid of Abidaga and this fear became in time an\n\noppressive nightmare which never left him. At every step and movement, often in his dreams, he would think: what will Abidaga say about this? In vain he tried to please him and do what he wished. Everything that came from him Abidaga accepted with disdain. And that incomprehensible hatred hampered and disconcerted the man from Plevlje and made him still stiffer and clumsier. He believed that, because of Abidaga, he would one day lose not only his job and his position, but also his head. Therefore he lived in a state of permanent agitation and passed from dull discouragement to a feverish and cruel zeal. When now, pale and stiff, he stood before Abidaga, the latter spoke to him in a voice hoarse\n\nwith anger. 'Listen, blockhead, you are clever with these sons of sows, you know their language and all their monkey-tricks. Yet for all that you are incapable of finding out what scab it is who has dared to spoil the Vezira work. That is because you are a scab yourself, the same as they are, and the only worse scab is whoever made you leader and a chief and has found nobody to reward you as you deserve. So I will do so, since there is no other. Know that I will put you under the earth so that you will not throw as much shadow as even the tiniest blade of grass. If all damage to the works does\n\nnot cease within three days, if you do not catch whoever is doing this and do not put an end to all these silly stories about vilas and about stopping the work, then I will put you living on a stake on the highest part of the staging, that all may see you and take fright and get some sense into their heads. I swear this by my life and my faith, which I do not swear by lightly. Today is Thursday. You have till Sunday. Now go to the devil who sent you to me. Go! March!' Even without this oath the man from Plevlje would have believed Abidaga's threat, for even in his dreams he used to shudder at his words and at his glance.\n\nNow he went out in one of his fits of panic-stricken terror and at once set desperately to work. He summoned his own men and, passing suddenly from dull torpor to mad rage, he began to curse them.\n\n'Blind good-for-nothings!' raged the man from Plevlje, as if he were already placed alive upon the stake and yelling in the face of each of the guards. 'Is it thus that you keep watch and look after the Sultan's interests? You are quick and lively enough when you go to the cooking pots, but when you are on duty your legs are leaden and your wits are\n\ndull. My face burns because of you. But you will do no more slacking in my employ. I will massacre all of you; not a single one of you will keep his head on his shoulders if in two days this business does not end and if you do not seize and kill these bastards. You have still two days to live. I swear it by my faith and the Koran!' He went on shouting in this way for a long time. Then, not knowing what else to say to them or with what more to threaten them, he spat at them one by one. But when he had played himself out and freed himself from the pressure of his fear (which had taken the form of\n\nrage) he set to work at once with desperate energy. He spent the night cruising up and down the banks with his men. At one time during the night it seemed to them that something was knocking at that part of the staging which was farthest out in the river and they rushed thither. They heard a plank crack and a stone fall into the river, but when they got to the spot they indeed found some broken scaffolding and a part of the masonry torn away but no trace of the miscreants. Faced with that ghostly emptiness the guards shivered from superstitious fright and from the darkness and moisture of the night. They called to one another, peered into the blackness, waved lighted torches, but all\n\nin vain. The damage had been done again, and they who had done it had not been caught and killed, as though in very truth they were invisible. The next night the man from Plevlje arranged his ambush better. He sent some of his men over to the farther bank also and when night fell he hid guards in the scaffolding right out to the end and he himself with two others sat in a boat which he had drawn unnoticed in the darkness to the left bank. Thence in a few strokes they could be at one of the two piers on which construction had begun. In this way he could fall on the miscreants from two sides, so that they\n\ncould not escape unless they had wings or could go under water. All that long cold night the man from Plevlje lay in the boat covered with sheepskins, tormented by the dark thoughts whirling in his head; would Abidaga really carry out his threat and take his life which, under such a chief, was in any case no life but only terror and torment? But along the whole of the construction works not a murmur could be heard except the monotonous lapping and lisping of the unseen waters. Thus it dawned and the man from Plevlje felt in all his stiffened body that his life was darkening and shortening.\n\nOn the next, the third and last night, there was the same vigil, the same arrangements, the same fearful listening. Midnight passed. The man from Plevlje was seized with a mortal apathy. Then he heard a slight splash and then, louder, a blow on the oak beams which were placed in the river and on which the staging rested. There was a sharp whistle. But the leader's boat had already moved. Standing upright, he peered into the darkness, waving his hands and shouting in a hoarse voice: 'Row, row. .. .'\n\nThe men, half awake, rowed vigorously, but a strong current caught the boat earlier than it should have. Instead of reaching the staging, the boat turned down river. They were unable to make way against the current and it would have swept them far away had not something unexpectedly checked them. There, right in the middle of the main current, where there were neither beams nor scaffolding, their boat struck something heavy and wooden which echoed dully. Only then did they realize that on the scaffolding above them the guards were struggling with something. The guards, local renegades, were all\n\nshouting at once; they fell over one another in the darkness in a medley of broken and incomprehensible cries: 'Hold there, don't let go!' 'Hey, fellows, here!' 'It's me! . ..' Between the shouts some heavy object or human body could be heard splashing into the water. The man from Plevlje was for some moments uncertain where he was or what was happening, but as soon as he\n\nhad come to his senses he began to pull with an iron hook at the end of a long pole at the beams on which his boat had struck and succeeded in pulling the boat upstream nearer and nearer the scaffolding. Soon he was up to the oak piles and, taking heart, shouted at the top of his voice: 'Lights! Light a torch there! Throw me a rope!' At first no one answered. Then, after much shouting, in which no one listened to or could understand anyone else, a weak torch glimmered uncertainly and fitfully above. This first spark of light\n\nonly confused the eyes even more and mingled in an uneasy whirl, men, things and their shadows with the red reflections on the water. But then another torch flamed in another hand. The light steadied and men began to pull themselves together and recognize one another. Soon everything became clear and explicable. Between the boat of the man from Plevlje and the scaffolding lay a small raft made of only three planks; at the front was an oar, a real\n\nraftsman's oar, only shorter and weaker.\n\nThe raft was moored with a bark cord to one of the beams under the scaffolding and was held thus against the swift waters which splashed about it and tried with all their force to pull it away downstream. The guards on the staging helped their leader to cross the raft and climb up to them. All were haggard and out of breath. On the planks a Christian peasant was lying. His breast was heaving quickly and violently and his eyes, starting out of his head, showed fear-stricken whites. The oldest of the four guards explained to their excited leader that they had been keeping watch at various points on the\n\nstaging. When they heard the sound of oars in the darkness, they had thought it was their leader's boat, but they had been clever enough not to show themselves and to wait and see what would happen. Then they saw two peasants who approached the piers and with some difficulty moored their raft to one of them. They let them climb up and come among them and then they attacked them with axes, overcame them and bound them. One, who had been struck unconscious by a blow from an axe, they had bound easily, but the other one, after pretending to be half-dead, had slipped from their grasp like a fish through the planks into the water. The frightened guard halted in his story and the man\n\nfrom Plevlje screamed: 'Who let him go? Tell me who let him go, or I shall chop you all into small pieces, all of you.' The men stood silently and blinked at the red flickering light while their leader kept turning around as if searching the darkness, and shouting insults at them such as they had never heard him use by day. Then, suddenly, he started, leant over the bound peasant as if over a precious hoard, and began to mutter through his teeth in a thin lachrymose voice:\n\n'Guard him, guard him well! You bastards, if you let him go, not a single one of you will keep his head on his shoulders.' The guards crowded round the peasant. Two more hurried to join them, crossing the ferry from the farther bank. The man from Plevlje ordered them to bind the prisoner more securely. So they carried him like a corpse slowly and carefully to the bank. The man from Plevlje went with them, not looking where he was treading and never taking his eyes from the bound man. It seemed to him that he was growing in stature with every step, that only from that moment was he\n\nbeginning to live. On the bank new torches were lighted and began to flare up. The captive peasant was taken into one of the workmen's barracks where there was a fire, and was bound tightly to a post with ropes and chains taken from the hearth.\n\nIt was Radisav of Unište himself. The man from Plevlje calmed down a little; he no longer screamed or swore, but he was unable to keep still. He sent guards along the banks to look for the other peasant who had leapt into the\n\nwater, though it was clear that on so dark a night, if he had not drowned, it would be impossible to find or catch him. He gave order after order, went out, came in again and then once again went back, drunk with excitement. He began to interrogate the bound peasant, but soon left off doing that also. All that he did was only to master and conceal his nervousness, for in fact he had only one thought in his head; he was waiting for Abidaga. He had not long to wait. As soon as he had slept out his first sleep Abidaga, as was his habit, waked shortly after midnight and, no longer able to sleep, stood by his window and\n\nlooked out into the darkness. By day he could see from his balcony at Bikavac the whole river valley and all the construction works, with the barracks, mills, stables and all that devastated and littered space around them. Now in the darkness he sensed their presence and thought with bitterness how slowly the work was proceeding and how, sooner or later, this must reach the Vezir's ears. Someone would be sure to see to that. If no one. else, then that smooth, cold and crafty Tosun Effendi. Then it might chance that he might fall into disgrace with the Vezir. That was what prevented him from sleeping, and even when he did fall asleep he trembled in his dreams. His food seemed poison to him, men\n\nseemed odious and his life dark when he even thought of it. Disgrace —that meant that he would be exiled from the Vezir's presence, that his enemies would laugh at him (Ah! Anything but that!), that he would be nothing and nobody, no more than a rag, a good for nothing, not only in the eyes of others but also in his own. It would mean giving up his hard won fortune or, if he managed to keep it, to eke it out stealthily, far from Stambul, somewhere in the obscure provinces, forgotten, superfluous, ridiculous, wretched. No, anything but that! Better not to see the sun, not to breathe the air. It would be a hundred times better to be nobody and to have nothing. That was\n\nthe thought that always came back to him and several times a day forced the blood to beat painfully in his skull and his temples, but even at other times never completely left him but lay like a black cloud within him. That was what disgrace meant to him, and disgrace was possible every day, every hour, since everyone was working to bring it on him. Only he alone worked against it and defended himself; it was one man against everyone and everything. That had now lasted fifteen years, from the first time that the Vezir had entrusted him with\n\na great and important task. Who could\n\nendure it? Who could sl"
