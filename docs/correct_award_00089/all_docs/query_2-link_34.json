        "text": "Note- Any of my Serbian readers can translate what is on the page above?\n\nIt was interesting to see his small cerca 1976 apartment. The photo above is from his desk. It was also the first time I saw a Nobel Prize medal. He won the 1961 Nobel Prize for literature for his book, Bridge Over the River Drina. I was a chaperone with the grade 11 students from the ISB High School. We stopped at the Hotel Moscow for a cup of coffee before visiting the museum. Andric used to spend a lot of time there and the cafe there was THE place to be in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. All the celebrities, intellectuals, and visiting dignataries made a stop there. The morning gave me a glimpse of how it was back in the time of Tito and Yugoslavia. Sad that they couldn’t keep the federation together – I think everyone would be much better off if they did.\n\nI asked the tour guide if Andric had any living relatives and she said no close ones. There is a group of people that manage the foundation. I wonder what Andric would have thought about Višegrad today. It is the scene of his book and it is much different after the Yugoslav Civil Wars. He probably understood Bosnia better than anyone.\n\nOn Wednesday November 25 we held a discussion about science and science education. A panel of science educators, writers, and scientists discussed the challenges of engaging young people with scientific fields. The over one hour discussion that included questions and comments from the audience, hit on topics such as society’s message to young people in general and girls in particular, that making money is more important that knowledge and being educated. Other topics addressed were what parents can do to raise their children’s interest in science, finding a balance for educators between exposing students to the wonder of science with instilling in them the discipline for long hours of study and concentration. If you are interested in these and other topics with science, I encourage you to listen to the podcast.\n\nYou can listen to the podcast here.\n\nBrian Gorodetsky: Brian is from Vancouver, Canada and a IBO Diploma graduate.

He is a former science teacher and has spent a lot of time roaming the forests of South America.\n\nSunday we took a drive over to Kovačica, a small town located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north east of Belgrade. The town is famous for its naive art style painters and its majority Slovak population. Nadia loves art and we’re exposing the kids to art so we decided to go and check out the galleries. Naive art is a genre that emphasizes color, childlike simplicity, and patterns. I never heard of this art style before and was curious to learn more.\n\nThe gallery/museum is well maintain and features the works of around 25 artists from the town and neighboring villages. The styles vary, from the more realistic depictions to pure fantasy. The use of color differs also, some being extremely bright and others more subdued. Most of the subject matter is a romanticized, rural lifestyle. For example, many show scenes of the harvest or hunt, sledding in the winter, etc. I preferred the more realistic works of Jan Bačur and Mihal Povolny while Nadia liked the more colorful pieces, especially of Ana Knjazovic. The town of Jagodina in southern Serbia is more famous for its naive painting and maybe someday we’ll visit there.\n\nIt was a bitterly cold morning and we walked around the main plaza a bit. It was strange to see a priest walking near our car when we pulled into town. The town is mostly descendants of Slovak immigrants and they have their own church. We usually see the Orthodox holy men with the long beards and black robes. We bought a small piece for our house and some souvenir calendars. It is a nice day trip and better than hanging around the house on a cold, foggy day.\n\nI also took the kids to Hajd Park where there is a public school with a large cement area and wall. It is perfect for playing tennis. Owen is taking tennis lessons at the school and the past two weekends, he asked me to take him to play. We usually play for a while before Ocean, Ollie, and Owen want to climb the bleachers or hillside at the school instead of hitting the tennis ball.\n\nFriday night Nadia and I watched Inglorious Basterds, the latest film from Quentin Tarantino. I absolutely loved it! The movie is about a crack American team of soldiers fighting the Nazis in Vichy France in World War II. Tarantino’s flair for dialogue and violent melodrama is magnificent. Saturday I did a lot of yard work, raking leaves, etc. Nadia redecorated the house by rearranging furniture, etc. On Saturday night we went to our first Slava (more on that later) and on Sunday we visited the Naive Art Gallery in Kovacica (more on that later also.)\n\nThe weather has been holding out but Sunday was cold and foggy. School year is flying by!\n\nI just finished reading Michael Schuman’s “The Miracle: The Epic Story of Asia’s Quest for Wealth” and I really enjoyed it. Schuman is a journalist with Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal and has covered Asian economics and news for ten years. Asia is a part of the world that I don’t know much about and I have never been there (Australia excluded), and so the book is a good primer on the recent history of the region. He covers China, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan.\n\nSchuman gives a brief recent history of each country and chooses an important political figure and businessman for each country to tell his story. Asia since WWII has passed other regions since then in standard of living. He goes into the many reasons. I understand the biggest reason was tapping into the global economy through encouraging foreign investment and increasing the quality of businesses in the country. He also writes that all of the countries put politics and history aside and concentrated on the generating of wealth. That is a good lesson for the Balkans!\n\nI particularly liked the chapter on China. It is an example of one person’s efforts and opinion changing a countries destiny. That is what great leaders can do for a country. He profiles Deng Xiaoping and his reforms of the communist party. It also gave another perspective on Tiananmen Square protests. Deng had the view that China is too large for a democracy and without a single party suppressing it, China would be chaotic. I wonder as Chinese grow richer and better educated, how that will play out.\n\nI also am realizing that India and China have 1/3 the world’s population and their rise will change the current international political and cultural structures. He argues that the USA started this globalization of economies after WWII and when Asia gets richer, it is good for the US. I hope it spurs our schools and our young people to improve as there are a lot of children and teens coming from homes that don’t value learning and a strong work ethic in the USA. We have to compete with Asians for jobs and business.\n\nI recommend reading the book. I think eventually our international careers will take us to Asia. I would like to see for myself what it is like, although I am not a fan of big cities. One thought is to have our children attend Australian universities while we work in international schools in Asia.\n\nThe Washington Post Review of the Book\n\nUpdate November 27, 2009 – This post generated a lot of comments which surprised me. Some people called me on my understanding of the Serbian Orthodox Church. I don’t have a fact-checker or the time often to verify everything I write. The comments did inspire me to do a bit of reading and I learned that the Orthodox church prides itself on being the most “original” of all of the Christian sects. Although the Serbian Orthodox Church is not the “official” church of the state, it is so closely tied with politics and the Serbian ethnic identity, that is the de facto official church. All of the political parties are lobbying for their candidate to be named the next Patriarch.\n\nFew of my Belgrade friends attended the funeral and procession. A couple went to pay their respects at the wake. It seemed to me that most people attending the funeral were from smaller towns and outside of Belgrade where religious sentiment is stronger. I think it was good to see that many people gather for a decent man. I love the pagentry and tradition and am following the naming of a successor. I am an atheist so this whole event does not have any religious or deeper meaning for me.\n\nIn regards to Pavle’s legacy. It would have been tough to stop the war. I can’t think of any religious leader, besides maybe Ghandi that did stop a war. I think the media is a bit harsh in that respect in judging him. It is my hope that his successor give a message of tolerance and honesty for the people of the Balkans. It would be good for the church to work to heal Bosnia and relations between Serbia and Croatia instead of whether the country moves towards the EU or Russia.\n\nThe big news this week in Serbia is the death of the Patriarch Pavle. Pavle (Paul) in English is the name taken by Gojko Stojčević and he was the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Like the Pope to the Catholic, the Patriarch is the supreme leader of the faith. He was 95 years old and his death comes after a long illness – the last two years he was in the hospital.\n\nPavle died on Sunday and the country declared three days of mourning. People are lined up to pay their respects to the open casket in the cathedral in downtown Belgrade. The funeral will be at St. Sava’s Church on Thursday and the burial will be at the Rakovica Monastery located in the southern suburbs of Belgrade. The BBC reported on his legacy.\n\nSerb interests\n\nPavle was a respected theologian and linguist, known for personal humility and modesty.\n\nAfter the fall of communism and rise of Serb nationalism, the Church regained a leading role during his rule.\n\nAt the beginning of the Balkan wars that followed the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Pavle said – according to Serbian state television: “It is our oath not to make a single child cry or sadden a single old woman because they are of another religion or nation.”\n\nBut critics accused him of failing to contain hardline bishops and priests who supported Serb paramilitaries against Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims.\n\nAfter those wars, Pavle became more directly involved – openly criticising Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, after he lost Kosovo following Nato’s intervention.\n\nSince then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has strongly supported the Serbian government in its efforts to stop Kosovo’s independence drive.\n\n“Kosovo is not only a question of territory, it is a question of our spiritual being,” he said after Kosovo’s declaration of independence.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church is the official state church. For a long time, it was suppressed by the Turks, Austro-Hungarians, and most recently, the communists. Pavle was the 44th Patriarch and the church officials will announce when a successor will be named. At least 40 days must pass before one can be chosen. Most Serbs I know are not that religious, although because the church is so strongly tied to the state, I feel people support the church out of patriotism. This is so different from my home country of the USA, where there is a clear boundary between the church and state, and no one church is officially sanctioned. The Orthodox Church is the Byzantine side of Roman Catholicism and when they split from the Pope, the orthodox churches in the various countries split into their own administrative units instead of maintaining a single head like the Catholics.\n\nI hope to get a chance tomorrow to go downtown and see the faithful and take some photos. I am working Thursday, so doubt I’ll get a chance to go to the funeral. I am not a believer or member of the Orthodox Church, but I respect the historic significance of the position and his passing. It will be interesting to see who will replace him.\n\nI also think the Serbian Orthodox priests look holy with their long beards, black robes, and hats."
