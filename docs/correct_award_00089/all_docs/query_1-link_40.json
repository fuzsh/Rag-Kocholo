        "text": "(1892-1975), Yugoslav novelist, short-story writer, and Nobel laureate, born in Doc, near Travnik, Bosnia (then part of Austria-Hungary). He was educated at the universities in Zagreb, Krak√≥w, Vienna, and Graz. Before World War I he was a member of a revolutionary nationalistic movement in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Because of his political activities, Andric was interned by the Austrian government during World War I. Under the newly formed kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later the kingdom of Yugoslavia), Andric held a number of diplomatic posts, including that of ambassador to Germany. He resigned his ambassadorship in 1941 and spent World War II in Belgrade. The material for his works was drawn from the history and life of his native Bosnia. Andric wrote in the Serbo-Croatian language, and of his works translated into English the best known are: The Bridge on the Drina (1945; trans. 1959), The Woman from Sarajevo (1945; trans. 1965), and The Vizier's Elephant (1948; trans. 1962). He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1961."
