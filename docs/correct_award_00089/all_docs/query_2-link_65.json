        "text": "\"In the nineteen forties, when I was the eldest child of an ever-growing family in rural Co. Derry, we crowded together in the three rooms of a traditional thatched farmstead and lived a kind of den-life which was more or less emotionally and intellectually proofed against the outside world. It was an intimate, physical, creaturely existence in which the night sounds of the horse in the stable beyond one bedroom wall mingled with the sounds of adult conversation from the kitchen beyond the other. We took in everything that was going on, of course – rain in the trees, mice on the ceiling, a steam train rumbling along the railway line one field back from the house – but we took it in as if we were in the doze of hibernation.\" - Literature laureate Seamus Heaney Seamus Heaney’s rural childhood informed his later writings. For him, poetry was like the earth—something that must be ploughed and turned. Often, he paints the grey and damp Irish landscape; peat moss has a special place in his poetry. He was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize for Literature “for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past.” Read Seamus Heaney’s characteristically poetic Nobel Prize lecture in which he discusses his childhood and darker chapters in Northern Ireland’s history: https://lnkd.in/ebsr73ub"
