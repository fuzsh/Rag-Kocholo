        "text": "Biography\n\nIvo Andrić was born in 1892 in Dolac, near Travnik, in what was then Austro-Hungary and is now Bosnia. His father, a coppersmith, died of tuberculosis when he was two and he was brought up by his uncle and aunt in Višegrad, known for its bridge over the river Drina, which would be the subject of his best-known novel. After high school in Sarajevo, he went to universities in Zagreb, Vienna and Cracow. He joined the revolutionary Young Bosnia Movement, whose members included Gavrilo Princip, who would later assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, an act which led to the start of World War I. After the assassination, Andrić was imprisoned for three years. After the war, he got a job as a civil servant in the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was already a writer by this time. In 1920 he decided to become a diplomat and lived in many European cities. He finally became Ambassador to Germany though he resigned the post when Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941. He spent the war in Belgrade, where he wrote his three most famous novels, which were all published after the war. He held various posts in the Communist government. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1961. He died in 1975.\n\nBooks about Ivo Andrić\n\nVanita Singh Mukerji: Ivo Andric : a Critical Biography\n\nOther links\n\nIvo Andric\n\nIvo Andrić\n\nIvo Andric\n\nIvo Andrić\n\nIvo Andric Biography\n\nHis story is Yugoslavia\n\nBibliography\n\n1918 Ex Ponto\n\n1920 Nemiri\n\n1920 Put Alije Đjerzeleza\n\n1924 Pripovetke I\n\n1925 Most na Zepi (The Bridge on the Zepa)\n\n1931 Anikina Vremena\n\n1931 Portugal, zelena zemlja\n\n1931 Pripovetke II\n\n1931 Španska stvarnost i prvi koraci u njoj, putopisi\n\n1935 Njegoš kao tragični junak kosovske misli\n\n1936 Razgovor sa Gojom\n\n1936 Pripovetke III\n\n1945 Izabrane pripovetket\n\n1945 Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina)\n\n1945 Travnička hronika (Bosnian Story; Bosnian Chronicle; The Days of the Consuls)\n\n1945 Gospođjica (The Woman from Sarajevo)\n\n1946 Na Nevskom prospektu\n\n1947 Pripovijetke\n\n1948 Nove pripovetke\n\n1948 Priča o vezirovom slonue (later: Priča o vezirovom slonu, i druge pripovetke) (The Vizier’s Elephant: Three Novellas)\n\n1949 Priča o kmetu Simanu\n\n1952 Pod gradicem: Pripovetke o zivotu bosanskog sela\n\n1954 Prokleta avlija (Devil’s Yard; The Damned Yard)\n\n1956 Igra\n\n1958 Panorama\n\n1958 O priči i pričanju\n\n1963 Sabrana djela Ive Andrica (The Pasha’s Concubine and Other Tales)\n\n1963 Jelena žena koje nema\n\n1966 Ljubav u kasabi: Pripovetke\n\n1968 Aska i vuk: Pripovetke\n\n1976 Eseji i kritike\n\n1976 Kuča na osami\n\n1976 Omerpaša Latas (Omer Pasha Latas: Marshal to the Sultan)\n\n1991 Jevrejske priće\n\n1992 Diplomatski spisi\n\n1992 The Damned Yard and Other Stories"
