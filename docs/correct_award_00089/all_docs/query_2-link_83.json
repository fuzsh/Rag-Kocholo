        "text": "This study focuses on the subject of sacrifice, as it appears in the novel of the Serbian writer, Ivo Andrić (1892-1975) who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961. For him, the bridge on Drina is a tremendous and majestic symbol of the tragic history of a part of the Balkans, marked by coexistence and also by conflicts between the ethnic and religious minorities. Even from the construction of the bridge, at the command of a pasha, the sacrifice of one of the Serbs forced to work hard was committed. It is the first testimony of a long line of murders, targeting Christians, Muslims and Jews alike. For the author, this sacrifice has a symbolic value, being rendered in the style of Christian martirology in the primary church. The history of the Balkans, having the bridge on Drina as a silent witness to, is shattered by periods of alchemy, but also by human dramas and misunderstandings, on the one hand, respectively by wars, separations, annexations, magnifications and decays of empires, on the other hand. Andrić's novel is thus constituted in a vast historical fresco, but also in a document of the human condition in a part that was not accidentally called \"a Powder Keg\" of Europe. In fact, the figure of Ivo Andrić continues to be controversial: if Serb nationalists put it as a benchmark of their movement, even reaching out theater props/parodic forms, Bosnian Muslim intellectuals will accuse him of treason, falsification of the period of the Ottoman rule.\n\nIn their paper \"A Survey of Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian Poetry in English Translation in the U.S. and Canada,\" Snezana Zabic and Paula Kamenish present a survey of book-length collections and anthologies of Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian poetry in English translation published in the U.S. and in Canada. Zabic and Kamenish argue that it is necessary to determine which factors are advantegous for the survival of poetry originating in \"minor\" languages and transmitted to the United States and Canada. Zabic and Kamenish propose three elements that have ensured a marginal but persistent presence of South Slavic poetry in English in the United States and Canada since the 1970s: émigré(e) writers who also serve as translators, scholars who study and teach minor literatures of the world, and a publishing industry open to offering poetry in translation. Zabic and Kamenish argue that if North American English-language culture chooses to ignore poetic practices in foreign languages, vital international influences on literature would be interrupted or lost. CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb/vol8/iss3/5/\n\nThe first translations of several short stories by Alice Munro were published in Croatia in the 1990s but it was only after 2011 that her actual books were translated. Receipt of the Nobel Prize in Literature further boosted the author’s already substantial reputation in Croatia.. Munro's success has run parallel to that of the short story in general in contemporary Croatian literature. Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, has been known to the audience in Croatia since the late 1960s primarily for his music, but more recently also for his literary texts, most of which, beginning in the 1980s, have been translated into Croatian. By analyzing a diverse bibliography of mostly literary reviews and critical writings on Cohen and Munro in the Croatian media from the early 1990s, this article explores the arguments justifying the translation of their texts into Croatian. The approach employed is descriptive, giving a diachronic overview of their critical reception in Croatia.\n\nAfter the conflict with the Soviet Union in 1948, Yugoslavia opened up to the West and took on a more important role on the international political and cultural stage. As it was not a rich country, it had to make the most of its culture in its foreign affairs. The paper analyses the work of the Federal Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries whose task was to inform foreign institutions and individuals about the cultural achievements of Yugoslav nations, including the field of literature. The paper aims to reconstruct and explain the criteria for the selection of authors and literary works which were to be presented abroad as the pinnacle of Yugoslav literature(s) and to be offered, through translation, a place in the canon of world literature. The paper also takes a closer look at the role of literature in Yugoslav foreign policy and, vice versa, at the importance of foreign policy for the promotion of Yugoslav literature(s). The argument makes a case for a close connection between the shifts in socialist Yugoslavia's diplomatic aims and the adjustments to its literary canon.\n\nThe paper traces the history of reception of Australian literature in Serbo-Croatian speaking republics of Yugoslavia until 1991 and then its reception in Serbian translation from 1991 until today. The sixty-year period of reception, from the first recorded translation in 1954 to 2012, is divided into 12 five-year periods and the pattern of reception is established and analysed. Concentrating on three distinct spikes of interest and one considerable dip, which can be clearly distinguished in the pattern, the paper seeks to address the following questions: which Australian authors have been translated most frequently or what might have spurred the interest in certain authors and works in particular periods and whether there has been a consistent systematic interest in Australian literature or its presence in Serbian translation is largely the result of sporadic individual efforts. The pattern also reveals that the reception of prose fiction dominates over poetry and the paper, therefore, pays particular attention to four anthologies of Australian fiction which have been published in Yugoslavia/Serbia."
