We hope you're at least half as excited as we are! ü§©\n\nTorn, spilled, just as if it never exists, but is eternally created, rebuilt and recovered\". These are the words of our Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andric who most faithfully described the fate of the name of our capital. Did you know that Belgrade has changed its name even 15 times throughout history?! ü§Ø We bet you didn't. \n\n‚Ä¢Singidunum\n‚Ä¢Veligradon\n‚Ä¢Alba Graeca\n‚Ä¢Alba Bulgaricu\n‚Ä¢Fehervar\n‚Ä¢Nandoralba\n‚Ä¢Nandorfehervar\n‚Ä¢Wei√üenburg\n‚Ä¢Griechisch-Wei√üenburg\n‚Ä¢Castel Bianco\n‚Ä¢Belgrat\n‚Ä¢Dar Al D≈æihad\n‚Ä¢Prinz Eugen Stadt\n‚Ä¢Bijograd\n‚Ä¢Beograd\n\nYou can see all of 15 names above. But you know what, the spirit of this city and the people who live there never changed, but only got stronger. ü´Ç\n\nNow we have a question for you. Which name is the most interesting to you? ü§ì Till the next fun fact about Serbia üëÄ\n\n#PaintTheWhiteCityInGreen #CMBelgrade2022 #WeAreLGBelgrade #LXIVCM #CouncilMeeting #15DaysLeftTillCM #Beograd\".",
