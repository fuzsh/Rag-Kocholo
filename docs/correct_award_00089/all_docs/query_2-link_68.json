READING 36.9 108 CHAPTER 36 Liberation and Equality experienced by both black and white Americans in the modern United States. From Ellison’s Invisible Man (1952) I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who 1 haunted Edgar Allan Poe;1 nor am I one of your Hollywoodmovie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me. 10 Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a bio-chemical accident to my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through their physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you’re constantly being bumped against by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist. You 20 wonder whether you aren’t simply a phantom in other people’s minds. Say, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy. It’s when you feel like this tha.\n\nAMERICAN LITERATURE, HISTORY AND SOCIETY.pptx\n\nAMERICAN LITERATURE, HISTORY AND SOCIETY.pptxMilanStankovic19\n\nHas literature ever had the power to change historical trends and the state of society? Someone who is in love with literature will say - oh yes, sure, writers and their works have great power. However, sober thinking would change this assessment of the enthusiastic reader. Because if literature had ever fundamentally influenced history and social movements, both history and reality would have been different. But, on the other hand, the influence of literature should not be underestimated. It is a fact that some literary works influenced the change of laws and social rules, as well as the general perception of the public on certain important issues. Therefore, if literature could not fundamentally change history and direct its course, it certainly had a huge emancipatory role in various periods of the development of society and culture. In this presentation, only some important writers and works, mainly novels and plays, are listed in this sense. A real investigation would require a much more extensive study. The presentation used paintings by great American painter Edward Hopper. His painting \"American Locomotive\" is on the first page of the presentation."
