Raised when the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he was an outspoken opponent of that government and called for a unified, multicultural homeland. He wrote mostly in Serbian, but about a third of his works were in Croatian, and he often used both of these interconnected languages in the same text. He also translated works by Walt Whitman and August Strindberg. He studied in Austria and Poland, and was jailed during World War I, accused of associating with the Serbian nationalists who assassinated Franz Ferdinand.\n\nAfter World War I he became a Yugoslavian diplomat, stationed in Italy, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and Germany. When Germany invaded Yugoslavia, he returned to occupied Belgrade, where he endured the war under house arrest. There he wrote his three most famous novels, Na Drini Cuprija (The Bridge on the Drina), Travnicka Hronika (Bosnian Story), and Gospodjica (The Woman from Sarajevo), but none of these were published until after World War II ended. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, \"for the epic strength\" of work that \"shaped the motifs and fates from the history of his country\", and he donated his $48,000 Nobel cash honorarium to the construction of libraries in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nFather: Antun Andrić (janitor, d. 1895 tuberculosis)\n\nMother: Katarina Pejić Andrić\n\nWife: Milica Babic-Andric (theatrical costume designer, b. 1909, mistress 1950s, m. 1958, d. 1968)\n\nHigh School: Sarajevo Grammar School, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (1912)\n\nUniversity: University of Zagreb (attended 1912-13)\n\nUniversity: University of Vienna (attended 1913-14)\n\nUniversity: University of Krakow (attended 1914-15)\n\nUniversity: PhD Philosophy, University of Graz (1924)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1961\n\nCroatian Ancestry\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://www.ivoandric.org.yu/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nEx Ponto (1918, prose poetry)\n\nNemiri (Anxieties) (1919, prose poetry)\n\nPut Alije Djerzeleza (The Trip of Alija Djerzelez) (1920)\n\nPripovetke (Stories) (1924, short stories)\n\nPripovetke 2 (Stories 2) (1931, short stories)\n\nPripovetke 3 (Stories 3) (1936, short stories)\n\nNa Drini Cuprija (The Bridge on the Drina) (1945)\n\nTravnicka Hronika (Bosnian Story) (1945)\n\nGospodjica (The Woman from Sarajevo) (1945)\n\nPriča o Vezirovom Slonu (The Vizier's Elephant) (1948)\n\nNove Pripovetke (New Stories) (1948, short stories)\n\nProkleta Avilija (The Devil's Yard) (1954)\n\nLica (Faces) (1960, short stories)\n\nZapisi o Goji (Notes on Goya) (1961)\n\nOmer-Pasha Latas (1977, posthumous)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
