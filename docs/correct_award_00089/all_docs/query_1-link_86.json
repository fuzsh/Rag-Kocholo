Andric/ London, 1959\". \"The Bridge on the Drina earned the Yugoslavian author Ivo Andric (1892-1975) the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961. \"A vivid depiction of the suffering history has imposed upon the people of Bosnia from the late sixteenth century to the beginning of World War.The story spans about four centuries and covers the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian occupations of the region, with a particular emphasis on the lives, destinies and relations of the local inhabitants, especially Serbs and Bosnian Muslims\" (GoodReads). A masterpiece. NB: Signed First Editions by this Nobel prize-winning author are especially uncommon. At the time of listing we can find only one other Ivo Andric signed first edition on the www. NB: Some 50 years after Andric was awarded the Nobel Prize, it was revealed he was up against and selected over J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E.M. Forster. Scarce with these attributes and a rare find indeed. One of the best-known novels by the Yugoslavian Nobel Laureate. Photographs/scans available upon request. Signed by Author."
