        "text": "Ivo Andrić (born Oct. 10, 1892, Dolac, near Travnik, Bosnia—died March 13, 1975, Belgrade, Yugos. [now Serbia]) was a writer of novels and short stories in the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian language, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961.\n\nAndrić studied in Poland and Austria. His potential as a writer of both prose and verse was recognized early, and his reputation was established with Ex Ponto (1918), a contemplative, lyrical prose work written during his internment by Austro-Hungarian authorities for nationalistic political activities during World War I. Collections of his short stories were published at intervals from 1920 onward.\n\nFollowing World War I, he entered the Yugoslavian diplomatic service. Although his career took him to Rome, Bucharest (in Romania), Madrid, Geneva, and Berlin, it was his native province, with its wealth of ethnic types, that provided the themes and psychological studies to be found in his works. Of his three novels, written during the Second World War, two—Travnička hronika (1945; Bosnian Story) and Na Drini ćuprija (1945; The Bridge on the Drina)—are concerned with the history of Bosnia.\n\nThe Bridge on the Drina constructs four centuries of Bosnian history by narrating historical events as well as stories about individuals connected to the famous Ottoman bridge in Višegrad and by paralleling historical narration with folk legends and tales on the same subjects. Taking a different approach, Bosnian Story portrays the Bosnian milieu through the eyes of foreigners—the French, Austrian, and Ottoman consuls stationed in the city of Travnik at the time of Napoleon. Andrić preserves a critical distance from these Western and Eastern lenses of his narrative, but he also sees Bosnia through them, indirectly illustrating the fact that a writer cannot achieve an unmediated approach to his own culture."
