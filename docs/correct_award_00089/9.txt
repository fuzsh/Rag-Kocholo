Work

Ivo Andrić initially wrote poetry, and his ideas were influenced by such philosophers as Kierkegaard. However, it was the historical epic that would become his main literary genre. Andrić’s works, including his novel Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina), illuminate the destinies of individuals against a historical, cultural, and religious background. His stories not only convey great affection for people but also depict violence and cruelty. His stories are rich in astute psychological observations, and his language is characterized by simplicity and a wealth of details.
