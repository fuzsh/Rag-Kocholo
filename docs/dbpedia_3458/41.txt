History of Randstad Rail

Proposed around 1983 to alleviate the traffic problems caused by the significant growth in population and employment in the Randstad and The Hague, the metro became a solution to a pressing problem. The first proposal for the Randstad Rail was presented on 9 June 1988, proposing the construction of stations at Ridderkek, Alblassedam and Hendrik-Ido Ambacht in The Hague to facilitate travel to Rotterdam. HTM, NS Regional Transport, RET and the ZWN Group joined forces to form the Randstad Rail Foundation to realise the construction of the metro.

The metro service in The Hague was officially inaugurated with the unveiling of Randstad Rail 4 on 29 October 2006. The remaining lines – Metro Line E, Randstad Rail 3 and Randstad Rail 19 – were opened on 10 September 2006, 12 February 2007 and 1 July 2010 respectively.
