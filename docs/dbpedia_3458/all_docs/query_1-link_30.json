Information on account creation can be found on the ENL 3895 section of this guide.\n\nMake sure your article doesn't already exist! Search for it on Wikipedia. If it does exist, you can simply edit the existing article.\n\nUse the Article Wizard to start creating your new article. This will help you create a draft space for your article. Make sure to bookmark it and share with your group. Multiple people can edit the same draft, so only one person in your group needs to create the draft.\n\nWrite! Check out the links in the Helpful Resources box if you need some more guidance.\n\nHit the blue \"Publish page...\" button when you're done! This will allow the page to either be published, or be sent for review by other Wikipedia editors. Consider saving a copy of your article somewhere to ensure you have an extra copy of it. The 'download as PDF' link on the left is great for doing just that."
