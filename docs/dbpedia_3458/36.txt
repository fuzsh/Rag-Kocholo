Metros in the Netherlands: The Randstad Rail (The Metro in The Hague)

The Hague is the capital of South Holland in the Netherlands. The King Willen-Alexander lives in this city. It is also the location of the parliament. This city is famous for being the location of multiple international courts. The Hague has a population of around 500,000 inhabitants, making it the 3rd most populated city in the Netherlands. The airport in the city is called Rotterdam The Hague Airport. A nearby airport outside The Hague is the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, located in Amsterdam. Most international travelers that visit The Hague use this airport.

Public transportation in The Hague consists of trams, buses, the metro, the Intercity train, and ferries. The metro and many trams belong to a single service called Randstad Rail. This service offers transportation among The Hague, Rotterdam and Zoetermeer. There are also buses that belong to Randstad Rail. Randstad Rail is owned by HTM Personenvervoer NV.

History

The metro was proposed because the population and the number of jobs in Randstad, The Hague, had a significant increase in 1983. This led to high traffic. Therefore, a new railway system would solve the traffic problem.

The first proposal of the Randstad Rail came in June 9th, 1988. The proposal stated the construction of train stations in Ridderkek, Alblassedam, and Hendrik-Ido Ambacht in The Hague, which would make trips to Rotterdam. The railway companies HTM, NS Regional Transport Company, RET, and ZWN-Group together created the Randstad Rail Foundation to build the metro.

The metro service for The Hague was officially inaugurated on October 29th, 2006, with the opening of Randstad Rail 4. The opening dates for the rest of the lines were: September 10th, 2006 for Metro Line E, February 12th, 2007 for Randstad Rail 3, and July 1st, 2010 for Randstad Rail 19.
