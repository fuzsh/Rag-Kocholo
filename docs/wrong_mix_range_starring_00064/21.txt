Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is the second film to feature Mr. Powers, who this time must reclaim his mojo from Dr. Evil (and his new sidekick, Mini-Me). Star Mike Myers also proceeded to outdo himself by taking on the role of Fat Bastard (yes, that's his name).

Back Cover Synopsis[]

First he fought for the Crown, now he's fighting for the family jewels! Mike Myers (Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery) returns as the world's grooviest superspy in his latest comedy-adventure!

Intent on world domination, diabolical genius Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 and steals Austin's "mojo". Now Austin must return to the Swingin' Sixties, recover his mojo and stop his terminally square arch nemesis from liquidating the world. Together with fab CIA superchick Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, Lost in Space, Bowfinger), Austin faces off against an army of outrageous villains including a hilarious henchman of tremendous girth and Mini-Me, Dr. Evil's deranged 1/8-sized clone.
