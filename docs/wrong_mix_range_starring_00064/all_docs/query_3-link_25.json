        "text": "No matter the pure intentions that are clearly behind the upcoming film, “Champions,” it’s hard to imagine Bobby Farrelly’s new comedy being released without controversy.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Now You See Me 3’: Ruben Fleischer To Direct Next Movie In Series For Lionsgate\n\nAs seen in the trailer for “Champions,” the film follows the story of a professional basketball coach who finds himself on the outs and has to serve community service. As we’ve seen in a number of sports comedies in the past, the community service that he’s forced to serve is as a coach for an underprivileged team. Complicating matters a bit more is the fact that this team is comprised of folks with intellectual disabilities.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Man From Toronto’ Review: Kevin Hart & Woody Harrelson Are On Auto-Pilot In Patrick Hughes’ Tedious, Unfunny Action Film\n\nThe film stars Woody Harrelson, Kaitlin Olson, Ernie Hudson, Cheech Marin, and Matt Cook. As mentioned, the film is directed by Bobby Farrelly, the man behind such raunchy comedies as “Shallow Hal,” “There’s Something About Mary,” “Me, Myself, and Irene,” and “Dumb and Dumber.” Given his track record in the past with sensitive material, such as people with intellectual disabilities, you have to wonder how he plans to navigate the humor of this film.\n\n“Champions” arrives in theaters on March 24, 2023. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nWoody Harrelson stars in the hilarious and heartwarming story of a former minor-league basketball coach who, after a series of missteps, is ordered by the court to manage a team of players with intellectual disabilities. He soon realizes that despite his doubts, together, this team can go further than they ever imagined."
