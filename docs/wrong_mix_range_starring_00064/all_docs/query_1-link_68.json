        "text": "The Spy Who Shagged Me is not so much a “Yeah, baby!” as a, “Well, okay, I guess, baby.” Neither as funny nor as original as the first Powers film, Shagged can’t help but being a disappointment.\n\nTaken apart from the original (which is nearly impossible to do because Myers has recycled an amazing amount of the gags from the first film), the film still has funny parts. Mike Myers realized in this film that the character of Austin is not the strong point of this franchise, the long-ball hitter here is Dr. Evil. Therefore it is nice to see the bad doctor at center stage here. Myers is consistently funny in this character, particularly when doing the whitest rap ever about his relationships with his son, Scott (Seth Green) and his three-foot tall clone Mini-Me.\n\nThe scenes with Austin searching for his lost Mojo are sometimes clever, I suppose – though all too often circling around the toilet bowl. The third character played by Myers – a Scottish assassin called Fat Bastard – is just offensive, though, and not the least bit funny. Heather Graham is just fine in her role of eye candy – not overly complex but fine for what she is asked to do."
