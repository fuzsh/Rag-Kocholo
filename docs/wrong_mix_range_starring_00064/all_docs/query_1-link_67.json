        "text": "Thrillers help round out fall film list\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nSept. 5 - Here are other highlights of the Fall Film Season, organized by the month they are tentatively scheduled to arrive in Denver. Remember that release dates can and often do change. Also, several of the higher-profile, late-year art movies do not yet have Denver bookings:\n\nSeptember\n\nTwo thrillers about the supernatural, \"Stir of Echoes'' with Kevin Bacon and \"Stigmata'' with Patricia Arquette, try to follow the success of \"The Sixth Sense.'' Tommy Lee Jones is a parole officer - not a U.S. marshal - chasing Ashley Judd in \"Double Jeopardy.'' Martin Lawrence is a robber posing as a cop in \"Blue Streak''; Adrian Grenier is an alienated upstate New York teen in \"The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.'' Dog lovers Luke Wilson and Natasha Henstridge find each other in \"Dog Park,'' a romance with bite. On the art circuit, British director Carol Reed's classic \"The Third Man'' suspense film, starring Orson Welles, gets a pristine rerelease. So does The Beatles' animated \"Yellow Submarine.'' And two Yugoslav movies - the Gypsy fable \"Black Cat, White Cat'' and the more realistic \"Cabaret Balkan'' - are set to open on the same day (Sept. 24), along with Japan's lovely \"Afterlife.''\n\nOctober\n\nKids get the \"Sesame Street''-derived \"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland.'' Teens get Melissa Joan Hart (of TV's \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'') in \"Drive Me Crazy.'' And whether they want it or not, adults get the 20th-anniversary rerelease of the NC-17 \"Caligula.'' David E. Kelly, the \"Ally McBeal'' producer responsible for \"Lake Placid,'' tries (as producer) movie comedy with \"Mystery, Alaska,'' starring Burt Reynolds and Hank Azaria. In \"The Best Man,'' Spike Lee's cousin Malcolm Lee aims to update \"The Big Chill'' with an African-American cast. Based on a true story, \"Boys Don't Cry'' is about a Nebraska woman murdered for posing as a man. \"Princess Mononoke,'' with its dubbed-in English dialogue, is the highest-profile Japanese animated-film release to date. Geoffrey Rush, whose career is taking strange turns after \"Shine,'' stars in a remake of Vincent Price's campy 1958 \"The House on Haunted Hill.'' But that's not as strange as John Malkovich playing John Malkovich in \"Being John Malkovich,'' from hip music-vid director Spike Jonze.\n\nNovember\n\nYet another thriller about a serial killer, \"The Bone Collector'' nevertheless has such intriguing stars as Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah and Michael Rooker. Ron Shelton ( \"Bull Durham,'' \"Tin Cup,'' \"White Men Can't Jump''), one of the few directors who makes sports fun, is back with \"Play It to the Bone,'' starring Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas as ex-boxers. Jodie Foster teaches the King of Siam (Chow Yun-Fat) a thing or two in \"Anna and the King.'' And Pierce Brosnan returns as James Bond in \"The World Is Not Enough,'' with \"Full Monty's'' Robert Carlyle as a dastardly villain.\n\nDirector Barry Levinson ( \"Diner,'' \"Tin Men'') returns to Baltimore for \"Liberty Heights.'' And the movie industry returns to favorite author Jane Austen for \"Mansfield Park,'' featuring playwright Harold Pinter in an acting role. Japanese-animated \"Pokemon: The First Movie,'' follows \"Princess Mononoke's'' lead into American theaters. And for the art crowd, there's the complex British drama \"Dreaming of Joseph Les'' with Rupert Graves.\n\nDecember\n\nNew York cop Robert De Niro takes singing lessons from a drag queen in \"Flawless,'' a tough guy's version of \"The Music of the Heart.'' And Robin Williams teams up with \"Mrs. Doubtfire'' director Chris Columbus for \"Bicentennial Man.'' (Shouldn't it be titled \"Millennial Man''?) Ehren Kruger, who wrote the taut, involving script for \"Arlington Road,'' also wrote the coldweather thriller \"Reindeer Games'' for director John Frankenheimer. It stars Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron. And if anyone still cares, \"Scream 3'' is back with Wes Craven directing the usual cast. On a lighter note, Tim Allen is in a parody of the \"Star Trek'' legacy called \"Galaxy Quest,'' with \"Alien''-legacy star Sigourney Weaver along for the fun. And Rob Schneider - one of the few \"Saturday Night Live'' stars who hasn't yet made it in movies - gets his chance as \"Deuce Bigalo: male gigolo.'' Will it be his \"Austin Powers'' or his \"It's Pat''? And among the 1999 releases so far without Denver dates are \"The End of the Affair,'' a romance based on a novel by Graham Greene ( \"The Third Man'') concerning a novelist (Ralph Fiennes) haunted by his romance with a married woman (Julianne Moore) during the Blitz of London in World War II. Neil Jordan directs. And in \"Ride With the Devil,'' Taiwanese director Ang Lee - who understood 1970s-era America very well in \"The Ice Storm'' - now looks at the Civil War in this drama. And the cast features singer/poet Jewel in a key role. Depending upon when it gets here, Jewel could be battling fellow pop star Alanis Morissette ( \"Dogma'') for the hearts and dollars of the movie-going audience."
