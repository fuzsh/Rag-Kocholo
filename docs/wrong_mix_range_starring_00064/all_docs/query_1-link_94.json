        "text": "Everybody loves to laugh. And luckily, there are a whole lot of movies that can help us do that. Sometimes we love a show that we can really sink our teeth into—think the many seasons of something like The Office, 30 Rock, or even Seinfeld. But other times we just want something that we can start at 8:00 and be done with by 9:30. it's the glory of a good old fashioned movie: whether you wind up liking it or hating it, by the time the end credits start to roll, it's not the biggest commitment you're going to be making this week.\n\nEach decade has its winners and its losers, but the '90s certainly have a strong case for having the greatest catalogue of comedy movies that are just good. We're talking movies that will have you cracking up, and also movies that you may not be literally slapping your knee, but rather something you recognize in your head, silently, as clever, and then find yourself thinking about later that night. And then again later that week. And then again, a full month or even year down the road. Some of these movies can get pretty deep, we're saying—looking at you, The Truman Show and Being John Malkovich.\n\nThere's a lot of variance on this list, for sure. Something being funny—comedies in general—aren't always dumb or gross slapstick humor. Don't get us wrong—there's plenty of merit in that too; this list has a whole lot of Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler in their prime for that purpose. But we also we also wanted to include some movies that could certainly fall under the comedy umbrella, but are more intended as social satire or perhaps a dramedy than a traditional gut-busting comedy.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are 46 funny comedies—of varying degrees and intent—from the '90s that are 100% worth watching."
