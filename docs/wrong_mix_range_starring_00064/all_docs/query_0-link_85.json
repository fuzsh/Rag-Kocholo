        "text": "The Man Who Knew Too Much\n\n(1934, PG, Carlton Silver Collection, VHS/Retail)\n\nFirst time on video for the thriller that established Hitchcock as the \"Master of Suspense\". Beginning with a murder and kidnapping in Switzerland, it switches to London where anxious parents Edna Best and Leslie Banks hunt for their lost daughter as Peter Lorre's espionage ring plans a political assassination. A deceptively simple film packed with memorable moments and bizarre touches. Superior to the glossy 1956 remake.\n\nAustin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me\n\n(1999, 12, Entertainment, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)\n\nMike Myers's second extravagant comic pastiche of the Sixties spy movies starring Myers as a wild cross between the womanising upper-class Bond and the hornrim-spectacled Harry Palmer, with a touch of the dandyish TV detective Jason Love and the fashion photographer from Blow-Up. Myers also plays megalomaniac villain Dr Evil and an obese Scottish lecher, and despite some amusing moments the picture's immense popularity in the States is as puzzling as its writer-star's confused aims.\n\nBody Double\n\n(1985, 18, Col-TriStar, DVD/Retail, Rental)\n\nBrian De Palma's audacious reworking of familiar Hitchcockian themes and situations is set in Hollywood and features super-wimp Craig Wasson as a second-rate actor who becomes the Rear Window, Vertigo-style fall guy of a nasty plot involving skin-flick actress Melanie Griffith. Clever, nasty, long unavailable, and never shown on terrestrial TV.\n\nThe 13th Warrior\n\n(1999, 15, Warner, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)\n\nDirected by hi-tech action specialist John McTiernan and based on a novel by Michael Crichton, this strikingly staged, dramatically muddled adventure yarn is set in the ninth century and appears to be providing the historical background to Beowulf. Antonio Banderas plays a banished Arab aristocrat who joins forces with a party of barbaric, big-hearted Norsemen to free their Scandinavian homeland from a marauding horde of ruthless cannibals who dress in bearskins and take no prisoners. Heavily influenced by Kurosawa's samurai pictures, the battles are impressively staged in the rain or at night in British Columbia.\n\nRushmore\n\n(1999, 15, Buena Vista, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)\n\nWes Anderson's off-the-wall take on The Graduate has been proclaimed an instant cult classic. I can't see it, but you can now check it out at home. The unappealing Jason Schwartzman plays a disturbed 15-year-old son of a hairdresser in the New South who creates havoc in an exclusive private school, then in a municipal high school. Bill Murray and British actress Olivia Williams are on hand, providing bemused support.\n\nNever Been Kissed\n\n(1999, 12, Fox-Path√©, VHS/Rental)\n\nProduced by its star, this aimiable high school comedy (there was one every week last year) features Drew Barrymore as a 27-year-old blue-stocking big-city journalist making up for her sad schooldays when assigned to go undercover to report on teenage mores.\n\nThe Hi Lo Country\n\n(1998, 15, Universal, VHS/Rental)\n\nIntelligent, deeply moving modern Western, set in 1946 New Mexico to which pre-war pardners Woody Harrelson and Billy Crudup return from military service to discover suave cattle baron Sam Elliott is on his way to monopolising a mechanised corporate range. Refusing to sell their small spreads, the pair join an independent old-time rancher to defy progress and drive their steers to railheads instead of trucking them. Directed with an unsentimental feeling for the cowboy's life by Steven Frears, handsomely photographed by British cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, and scripted by Walon Green, author of The Wild Bunch, this is professional film-making in the tradition of Ford and Hawks. Last year's most undervalued picture."
