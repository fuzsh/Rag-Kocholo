        "text": "Zombies shuffle through downtown Fort Myers. A group of kids fight to save Cape Coral’s burrowing owls. Dakota Fanning kisses a boy on a Captiva Island beach.\n\nAnd the cameras are rolling to capture it all.\n\nFilm crews have visited Southwest Florida many times over the years, and so have some of Hollywood's biggest stars: Denzel Washington. Jayne Mansfield. Reese Witherspoon. Sean Connery. Drew Barrymore. Joe Pesci. Woody Harrelson. And many more.\n\nHere’s a look at major movies shot over the last six decades in Fort Myers, Naples, Bonita Springs and other parts of Southwest Florida.\n\nWorst movie shot in Cape Coral?: ‘The Fat Spy’ and the year Hollywood came to Southwest Florida\n\n“OUT OF TIME” (2003)\n\nThe film: In this crime thriller, the police chief (Denzel Washington) of fictional Florida town Banyan Key begins an affair with a married woman who says she has terminal cancer. To pay for her treatment, he steals money confiscated in a drug bust. But then the woman and her abusive husband die in a suspicious fire, the money disappears and the chief is the prime suspect.\n\nStarring: Denzel Washington, Eva Mendes, Sanaa Lathan\n\nDirector: Carl Franklin\n\nProduction: Multiple Florida locations were used to create the fictional town of Banyan Key, including Boca Grande. The opening five minutes of the film were shot in downtown Boca, where dozens of local extras showed up for filming in 2002.\n\nRotten Tomatoes rating: 64%\n\nSample review: “It's all very ‘Body Heat,’ which is to say, we've seen it all before. &mldr; ‘Out of Time’ (is) a well-performed, perfectly watchable thriller that's nonetheless as generic as its title.” — Moira Macdonald, Seattle Times\n\n“HOOT” (2006)\n\nThe film: A group of kids try to save a burrowing-owl habitat from bad-guy developers building a pancake restaurant. The comedy is based on Carl Hiaasen's novel of the same name. It’s set in Coconut Cove, a fictional town based on Cape Coral — a city famous for its burrowing owls.\n\nStarring: Luke Wilson, Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, Tim Blake Nelson\n\nDirector: Wil Shriner\n\nProduction: “Hoot” was filmed mainly on Florida’s east coast, including Fort Lauderdale, but parts were shot in Lee County’s Boca Grande and Gasparilla Island.\n\nRotten Tomatoes rating: 26%\n\nSample review: “While the novel is drenched in Hiaasen's wit, sense of adventure and aggressive environmentalism, the film emerges as a vanilla comedy, only slightly more interesting than most.\n\n\"Earnest, playful and eco-friendly, 'Hoot' is a worthwhile visit for the tween set, but parents may roll their eyes more than once at this flightless film.” — Toddy Burton, The Austin Chronicle\n\n“DAY OF THE DEAD” (1985)\n\nThe film: With this horror classic, director George A. Romero completed the zombie trilogy that started with 1968’s “Night of the Living Dead.” The story follows a group of scientists and soldiers hiding in a Florida bunker as they try to solve the zombie outbreak that’s taken over the world above.\n\nStarring: Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joseph Pilato, Jarlath Conroy\n\nDirector: George A. Romero\n\nProduction: Most of the underground filming took place in a limestone mine in Wampum, Pennsylvania. But above-ground scenes were shot in downtown Fort Myers, and the bunker’s elevator-platform entrance was built in a Sanibel Island field.\n\nDowntown Fort Myers doubled as the city of the dead. The movie's opening scene sees local extras, dressed as zombies, pouring out of Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center and shambling along the River District's streets.\n\nThat scene helped inspire the now defunct Zombicon festival, where people dressed up as zombies every year and recreated the scene for the annual \"zombie walk.”\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 81%\n\nSample review: “It's an intelligent, well-written, excellently played movie, with top flight gore/horror effects, perverse humor and a provocatively bleak vision. ... An inventive gore-fest, and one of the best horror movies of the eighties.” — Kim Newman, Empire\n\n“SWEET HOME ALABAMA” (2002)\n\nThe film: Romantic comedy about a New York fashion designer (Reese Witherspoon) who returns to Alabama to get a divorce after six years of separation.\n\nStarring: Reese Witherspoon, Josh Lucas, Patrick Dempsey, Candice Bergen, Fred Ward, Dakota Fanning, Thomas Curtis\n\nDirector: Andy Tennant\n\nProduction: Some scenes were shot at South Seas Island Resort and its nearby beach. The filming involved actors Dakota Fanning, 7, and Thomas Curtis, 9, kissing and playing younger versions of Reese Witherspoon and Josh Lucas. Another scene shows Witherspoon and Lucas also kissing.\n\nThe scenes were originally supposed to be shot in Georgia, but the weather was too cold there. Most of the film was shot in New York and Georgia.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 38%\n\nSample review: “With its overlong running time and egregiously sluggish pace, ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ comes off as a sporadically amusing yet entirely ineffective romantic comedy that ultimately squanders an expectedly charismatic turn from star Reese Witherspoon.” — Dave Nusair, Reel Film Reviews\n\n“STILL GREEN” (2007)\n\nThe film: In this award-winning drama, a group of carefree high school graduates vacation at a beach house before they go off to college. Then tragedy strikes.\n\nStarring: Sarah Jones, Noah Segan, Ryan Kelley, Douglas Spain, Paul Costa\n\nDirector: Jon Artigo\n\nProduction: Most of the scenes were filmed in Bonita Springs and Naples. The 2005 shoot involved overcoming many obstacles, including Hurricane Katrina, red tide and the theft of a $250,000 camera from a production van. Those troubles were eventually turned into a 13-episode Web documentary chronicling the making of the low-budget independent film.\n\nThe movie also marked the big-screen debut of Fort Myers “American Idol” finalist Vonzell “Baby V” Solomon, featured in a cameo.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: Unavailable\n\nSample review: Unavailable\n\n“NIGHT MOVES” (1975)\n\nThe film: Film noir about a Los Angeles private investigator (Gene Hackman) hired to find a client’s runaway daughter. His search takes him to the Florida Keys.\n\nStarring: Gene Hackman, Jennifer Warren, Edward Binns, Melanie Griffith\n\nDirector: Arthur Penn\n\nProduction: Some scenes were shot on Sanibel Island. The rest were filmed in California and Wakulla Springs, Florida. \"Night Moves\" was directed by Arthur Penn, who also directed the movie classics “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Little Big Man,” “The Miracle Worker” and “Alice’s Restaurant.”\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 83%\n\nSample review: “‘Night Moves’ is one of the best psychological thrillers in a long time, probably since ‘Don't Look Now.’ ... It has an ending that comes not only as a complete surprise — which would be easy enough — but that also pulls everything together in a new way, one we hadn't thought of before, one that's almost unbearably poignant.\n\n\"If you like private eyes, find it.” — Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times\n\n“PALMETTO” (1998)\n\nThe film: An ex-convict (Woody Harrelson) gets entangled in a fake kidnapping scheme that goes horribly wrong. Based on the James Hadley Chase novel \"Just Another Sucker.\"\n\nStarring: Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, Gina Gershon\n\nDirector: Volker Schlöndorff\n\nProduction: Some scenes were shot in downtown Fort Myers with Woody Harrelson. Others were shot in Charlotte County, Palmetto and Sarasota, Florida.\n\nRotten Tomatoes rating: 39%\n\nSample review: “Another film noir chump meets blond poison in the Florida-set 'Palmetto,' and the casting of wry-witted Woody Harrelson as this bum-luck magnet is good for some mordant humor.\n\n\"It's crucial compensation, because director Volker Schlondorff brings scant dramatic urgency to a potentially nifty dissection of a badly botched felony.” — Mike Clark, USA Today\n\n“GONE FISHIN’” (1997)\n\nThe film: Two New Jersey buddies go fishing in Florida in this wacky Disney comedy. They’re soon involved in a string of mishaps involving a stolen boat and car, hurricanes and more.\n\nStarring: Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rosanna Arquette\n\nDirector: Christopher Cain\n\nProduction: “Gone Fishin’ ” was filmed throughout Southwest Florida, including Fort Myers, Estero, Marco Island, Bonita Springs, Big Cypress Swamp and Everglades National Park.\n\nA stuntwoman died during filming when a boat lost control and hit her boat near Goodland Bay. Her husband and other people on the set also had minor injuries.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 4%\n\nSample review: “It's not a good sign when a studio doesn't screen a movie for critics &mldr; and the best that can be said is, they're no fools. The mis-pegged comedy/adventure — there is a dearth of both — inexplicably boasts a first-rate cast.\n\n\"But the plot and dialogue are third-rate and no one, not even Mel Gibson (Glover and Pesci's \"Lethal Weapon\" partner) could save this clunker.” — Nick Charles, New York Daily News\n\n“JUST CAUSE” (1995)\n\nThe film: In this crime thriller, a Harvard professor and former lawyer (Sean Connery) investigates a 25-year-old case involving a black man (Blair Underwood) convicted for the horrific murder of an 11-year-old girl. It’s set in Ochopee.\n\nDirector: Arne Glimcher\n\nStarring: Sean Connery, Blair Underwood, Laurence Fishburne, Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw\n\nProduction: “Just Cause” was filmed on location in Fort Myers, Bonita Springs and Collier County.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 26%\n\nSample review: “Despite its tendency to tread well-traveled roads, ‘Just Cause’ is filmed with enough energy and craft that, for the majority of its one-hundred minute running time, it's reasonably entertaining.” — James Berardinelli, ReelViews\n\n“THE FAT SPY” (1966)\n\nThe film: “The Fat Spy’s” over-stuffed, head-scratching story spoofs the 1965 beach-party movie “Beach Blanket Bingo.” A group of teenagers search for buried treasure on a (mostly) deserted island — that is, when they’re not dancing and singing to knock-off rock songs like “Do the Turtle.”\n\nMeanwhile, the island’s owner enlists his daughter and her rose-loving romantic interest to stop the teens. And the owner’s twin brother and the villainous Camille Salamander search everywhere for the long-lost Fountain of Youth.\n\nStarring: Phyllis Diller, Jack E. Leonard, Brian Donlevy, Jayne Mansfield.\n\nDirector: Joseph Cates\n\nProduction: The movie was shot in Cape Coral in 1965 as a publicity stunt orchestrated by Cape Coral developers Gulf American Land Corp. That’s why the city’s name is mentioned often in the film and why scenes are shot at tourist-friendly spots like the Cape Coral Yacht Club, the beach, the Iwo Jima memorial and former tourist attraction Cape Coral Gardens, including shots of its rose garden, fountains and popular porpoise show.\n\n\"The Fat Spy\" was one of Mansfield’s last roles. She would die in a car crash in 1967.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 23%\n\nSample review: “As a film reviewer, I get to see an awful lot of movies — not to mention a lot of awful movies,” he wrote. “However, every now and then, it is possible to come across a film that goes beyond just being bad. &mldr; The 1966 feature 'The Fat Spy' falls into that unique category.” — Phil Hall, Film Threat\n\n“CAPTIVA ISLAND” (1995)\n\nThe film: Local filmmaker John Biffar wrote and directed this comedy about a vacationing boy who meets a cute girl and three goofy senior citizens who are always hatching schemes.\n\nStarring: Ernest Borgnine, Amy Bush, Jesse Zeigler, Arte Johnson\n\nDirector: John Biffar\n\nProduction: The film was shot in Southwest Florida in 1994. Director Biffar remembers the comedy’s star, Borgnine, as a “class act” — a far cry from the blustery, often villainous roles usually associated with him.\n\n\"He was always trying to do the crew's work, to help them out,\" Biffar told The News-Press in 2012 after Borgnine’s death. \"He was great to me and helpful to the other actors.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: Unavailable\n\nSample review: Unavailable\n\n“COUPE DE VILLE” (1990)\n\nThe film: In this comedy-drama, three bickering brothers drive a 1954 Cadillac from Detroit to Florida to deliver the car for their mother’s birthday.\n\nStarring: Patrick Dempsey, Daniel Stern, Arye Gross, Annabeth Gish\n\nDirector: Joe Roth\n\nProduction: Some scenes from “Coupe de Ville” were shot in Cape Coral and Fort Myers.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 0%\n\nSample review: \"‘Coupe de Ville’ has a good heart and some nice moments, and would no doubt mean something to that hypothetical viewer who has never seen a movie like this before. But spare me.\n\n\"There is something deadening about the kind of formula picture where you know with absolute certainty what is going to happen, and how, and why. And ‘Coupe de Ville’ is composed of so many formulas that they must have a template for it in screenwriting school.” — Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times\n\n“WIND ACROSS THE EVERGLADES” (1958)\n\nThe film: Christopher Plummer plays a crusading Audubon Society agent who takes on bird poachers in the Florida Everglades. The bad guys want the birds’ feathers for women’s hats.\n\nStarring: Christopher Plummer, Burl Ives, Gypsy Rose Lee and Peter Falk (in his big-screen debut)\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nProduction: Filming took place in the town of Chokoloskee. “Wind Across the Everglades” was written and produced by brothers Budd and Stuart Schulberg. Budd Schulberg is best known for his Academy Award-winning screenplay for the classic 1954 drama \"On The Waterfront.”\n\nDirector Nicholas Ray is best known for the 1955 James Dean classic, \"Rebel Without A Cause.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nSample review: “Canada’s Christopher Plummer is suitably heroic and rock-jawed in this lively but chaotic action drama. He’s a dedicated conservationist who invades the Florida swamps and tries to stop red-bearded Burl Ives from slaughtering the wild birds.” — Clyde Gilmour, Maclean’s Movies\n\n“BLUE SKY” (1994)\n\nThe film: Drama about a nuclear cover-up involving a U.S. Army nuclear engineer (Tommy Lee Jones) and his wife (Jessica Lange).\n\nStarring: Tommy Lee Jones, Jessica Lange, Powers Boothe\n\nDirector: Tony Richardson\n\nProduction: Some scenes were shot in Fort Myers and North Captiva Island. Lange won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role.\n\nThe film was finished in 1991, just before the death of its director.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nSample review: “What makes it feel like a Hollywood film from another era is its belief that character can drive a movie; that there is nothing more fascinating than the complexities of the human heart.\" — David Ansen, Newsweek\n\n“THE HYBRIDS FAMILY” (2015)\n\nThe film: Paul Sorvino appears in this horror-movie spoof about the children of a vampire and a witch moving to Florida.\n\nStarring: Paul Sorvino, Carolyn Hennesy, Mojean Aria\n\nDirector: Tony Randel\n\nProduction: Filming was done mostly in temporary studios in a three-story Ave Maria commercial building. The movie was written and produced by Ave Maria resident Tony Schweikle.\n\nLocals appeared as extras, including some Ave Maria University students.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: Not available\n\nSample review: “‘The Hybrids Family’ is a mostly light family adventure that tackles some social issues with easy comedy. But for what it is, it succeeds.\n\n\"Never digging too deeply into the issues it brings up, it focuses on the more teen-centered interests of romance and independence.” — Dave Duprey, That Moment In\n\nMORE MOVIES WITH SWFL CONNECTIONS\n\nThese movies feature the region prominently, but they weren’t actually shot here:\n\n“Terror Inside” (2008): Corey Feldman and Tanya Memme star in this independent film shot in Orlando but with some scenes set in Fort Myers and Cape Coral. It was written and directed by Cape Coral resident Joe Lenders.\n\n“Adaptation” (2002): This loose adaptation of Susan Orlean’s non-fiction book features scenes set in Florida, including Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park. But the movie actually was filmed in Los Angeles. It stars Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep.\n\n\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" (1994): The Jim Carrey comedy features a scene set in Collier County — including a billboard that says \"Welcome to Collier County\" — but the movie was actually shot in the Miami area, according to online movie database IMDb.\n\nConnect with this reporter: Call 239-335-0368 or email crunnells@gannett.com.
