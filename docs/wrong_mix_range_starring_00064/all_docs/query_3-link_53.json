        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- As one of cinema's most dashing leading men, Pierce Brosnan has been paired on-screen with some of the most beautiful actresses in the world. In his latest film, \"After the Sunset,\" his character wakes up in bed with Woody Harrelson.\n\nSome explanation is in order. In this action-comedy, Brosnan plays Max, a master diamond thief who skips off to the Bahamas to play house with his beautiful accomplice (Salma Hayek). Harrelson plays a determined, slightly off-kilter FBI agent named Stan, who tracks Max down in hopes of putting him behind bars. Max quickly turns the tables on his longtime adversary, befriending him and introducing him to the finer things in life. Stan pretends to go along, figuring it's only a matter of time before the career criminal plots his next heist. Max and Stan wind up in a hotel room together after Stan imbibes one too many tropical drinks and Max gets the boot from his marriage-minded girlfriend. Needless to say, they've got some explaining to do the following day.\n\n\"I've had some great leading ladies -- and now Woody,\" Brosnan says, laughing.\n\nSuffering from a cold, Brosnan is a little hoarse as he talks up his newest movie. Dressed casually in a gray T-shirt and jeans, he is on his first publicity tour since it became official he would not be returning to play British superspy James Bond. Not surprisingly, he is inundated with questions about life post-007.\n\nBrosnan, 49, appears to be smarting from the way the Bond producers unceremoniously dumped him after he starred in four fairly successful Bond films. His last Bond film, 2002's \"Die Another Day,\" earned nearly $432 million worldwide, and he had hoped to reprise 007 once more before hanging up his gun.\n\n\"If the last film hadn't acquitted itself, or the one before hadn't acquitted itself, I would've thought, 'OK, well, I just didn't cut the mustard,' \" he says. \"But because they were such a progression of box-office successes, it seemed right to do a fifth.\"\n\nBrosnan, who took over as the suave British spy in 1995's \"GoldenEye,\" says he was invited to do a fifth film then found the rug pulled out from under him while he was shooting \"After the Sunset\" in the Bahamas. \"It was a pisser,\" he says in his Irish brogue.\n\nBrosnan holds no grudges. After all, Bond made him an international star. But he eagerly awaits the day when he won't have to discuss the franchise.\n\nMeanwhile, the actor is moving on. Unlike some of his Bond predecessors, whose careers were overshadowed by the character, Brosnan has diversified. He launched his own production company, Irish DreamTime, six years ago. It has allowed him to expand his range to other characters and genres. The company's first studio project, 1999's \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" starring Brosnan and Rene Russo, was a critical and box-office success.\n\nHis second venture, \"Evelyn,\" in which he played an Irish widower fighting the Catholic Church, opened to acclaim at the Toronto and Chicago film festivals. Earlier this year, he produced and starred in his first cinematic romantic comedy, \"Laws of Attraction,\" opposite Julianne Moore. Up next is the dark comedy \"The Matador,\" which he recently wrapped in Mexico.\n\n\"After the Sunset\" appealed to Brosnan's affinity for heist movies (indeed, one of his early roles was a TV movie called \"The Heist\"). \"I read (the script for) this and I thought that it could have legs to be an entertaining movie and ensemble piece with a bit of heist, a bit of romance and a buddy movie,\" he says.\n\nIt also afforded him the opportunity to work with \"Rush Hour\" director Brett Ratner. \"He's really got his finger on the pulse of pop culture and a passion for making films,\" Brosnan observes of the 35-year-old director. \"Hopefully, it comes across on-screen.\"\n\nWith the film's double-crosses and various plot twists, Brosnan admits with a chuckle that he was sometimes a little lost on where the story was going, but he put his faith in Ratner.\n\nBrosnan and Harrelson quickly bonded. The two actors had been acquainted since their days as TV stars -- Brosnan on \"Remington Steele\" and Harrelson on \"Cheers\" -- but had never worked together before. \"We got along great from the get-go,\" Brosnan says.\n\nHarrelson, making his big-screen comeback after a five-year sabbatical, says he discovered that he and Brosnan were more alike than he'd thought. \"He's definitely a hippie, whom you would never think, because he has that straight-laced image as James Bond,\" Harrelson says. \"There is much more of that side to Pierce than he hardly gets to show.\"\n\nBrosnan was also eager to work with Hayek, who earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of artist Frida Kahlo last year. \"She is kind of lionized in this film,\" he observes, \"but she is someone who is very secure in her own skin and walks the walk in the most delightful way. She's easy on the eye.\"\n\nDiscussing his co-star brings back a bittersweet memory. \"I was about to do a scene with Salma when I got the call from my agent that the negotiations (to do Bond) had stopped,\" he recalls.\n\nBrosnan has a thick skin, though. Born to a teenage mother, he was abandoned by his father at an early age. His mother then decided to pursue a nursing career in England and left him in Ireland to be raised by his grandparents. When his grandparents died, he reunited with his mother in England but was bullied by schoolmates because he was Irish. His attraction to movies began in 1964 when he saw the James Bond film \"Goldfinger.\"\n\n\"Films in general changed my life,\" he says. \"I always dreamed of being up on the screen as a kid, but I never thought that I was going to be an actor.\"\n\nHe first gained critical acclaim in America for the 1981 ABC miniseries \"The Manions of America\" and earned a Golden Globe nomination for his work in the 13-part BBC miniseries \"Nancy Astor.\" His starring role in the series \"Remington Steele,\" in which he played an ex-con turned private eye, presented him as a suave, sophisticated Brit and made him a leading contender for the role of James Bond.\n\nHe and his wife, a former beauty queen, and their children, Dylan Thomas, 7, and Paris Beckett, 3, split their time between California and Kauai, Hawaii. He also has a grown son and two stepchildren from his previous marriage to the late Cassandra Harris.\n\nMeantime, he is developing a sequel to \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" and looking forward to reprising that character. \"It was a mighty achievement with the first one that we hit the notes and set the bar as high as we did. So it's kind of daunting,\" he says, adding with a smile, \"but it would be great if we could pull it off again.\""
