        "text": "From Group A\n\nOman Advanced\n\nKuwait is waiting for the second place with 3 points\n\nFrom Group B\n\nKSA and Bahrain the winner advances while the loser has no chance in advancing.\n\nIran must win against Yemen with many goals and wait a for KSA and Bahrain match for 0-0 draw. In that cause Iran is advanced while KSA and Bahrain have no chance in second place.\n\nFrom Group C\n\nIraq is advanced either as First or second place. No second teams from the other two groups can reach 4 points.\n\nIf Jordan wins with 2 goals over Syria they will advance as a second place. If they win only 1-0 Kuwait will advance.\n\nIf Syria wins with 2 goals over Jordan they will advance as a first place and Iraq as best second. if they only won with 1 goal over Jordan i think they will make a draw to decide who is first and second between Iraq and Syria.\n\nIf Jordan and Syria match ended with a draw, Kuwait is through.\n\ncorrect me if i'm wrong\n\nJordan just needs to win to go through. Kuwait's standing in the runner's up table stands at 3 Pts with a -1 GD (because their 2-1 win vs. Lebanon is not factored in). So if Jordan wins their goal differential will be at least 0.\n\nIf Syria and Iraq end up even on goal differential and goals scored the next tiebreaker is amount of yellow and red cards procured.\n\nSyria has none. Iraq has four."
