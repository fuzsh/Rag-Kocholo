AFC officials have never commented on these allegations. At the same time, some see these cries of foul play as an excuse by Iranian fans for the shortcomings of the Iranian national football team mainly against Arab teams. What follows in this article is a look at certain events which have occurred in the Asian Cup in China over the past days, to determine whether there is a case of injustice and insincerity by AFC.\n\nDuring Friday afternoon’s quarter final match between Uzbekistan and Bahrain, an incident occurred involving a Bahraini player. In the 65th minute of the match, Bahrain striker Ala’a Hubail (30) went in a challenge with his Uzbek counterpart. However, as a foul was committed by the Bahraini player, both players fell towards the ground. At this point Hubail clearly elbowed the Uzbek player’s stomach. Television replays clearly confirm the malice in the incident and the look on the Bahraini player’s face clearly shows his intent. What is surprising is that neither the linesman nor the referee clearly saw the incident, and Hubail got away with only a yellow card. Hubail went on to score two goals for his team. He also cleared the ball off his own line once, and scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out. Surprisingly, no action has been taken by AFC since the end of the match on Friday.\n\nA similar incident took place during an earlier match involving Iran and Oman, where Iranian defender Mohammad Nosrati stamped on the back of an Omani player. He was subsequently punished heavily by the AFC within hours of the final whistle. An off the ball incident between two Iranian defenders in the same match was also punished heavily by AFC after the match. General Farouk Bouzo, Chairman of the AFC Referees Committee, went on Arab television within minutes of that match and criticized the Bahraini referee, announcing his ban from the rest of the tournament. He added that the Iranian players will be punished. Within hours, the Iranian trio were handed strict punishments. The question here is why does it take minutes for the AFC Referees Committee to notice the incidents involving the Iranian players, but there is nothing mentioned of the ugly incident involving the Bahraini striker, an incident that had it been punished during the game, would have changed the whole outcome of the game, especially given the role Hubail played during the rest of the game.\n\nAnother similar incident occurred in the quarter-final match between Iraq and China, when Iraqi goalkeeper, Ahmad Ali Jaber, was sent off for an off the ball incident with a Chinese attacker. However, he has not received any further punishment for his behaviour up to now. The same question applies, as to why he hasn’t been further punished by the AFC officials.\n\nMost recently, during the Iran-Korea quarter final, Korean player Kim Jin Kyu (28) made continuous “one-fingered” indecent gestures towards the Iranian bench after a foul he had committed in the last ten minutes of the match. However, the AFC official website, and other officials have so far refused to comment on the incident.\n\nIf AFC is to be regarded as a fair and unbiased organisation, it needs to show consistency in its decision making, instead of creating double standards. It is still apparent that while the level of the games in Asia is lower than those in other continents, more worryingly the level of management and administration by the AFC suffers the same fate too. Whether these inconsistencies are as a result of incompetence of AFC officials, or as a result of bias is up to the readers to decide.\n\nhttp://persianfootball.com/news/sticky/EpAEVluAAuUNKGwUvS.shtml\n\nReferee sends hosts to undeserved final\n\nby Kamran Delan\n\nPFDC - It is very easy to put the whole blame on the referee who, to the astonishment of the world, showed why Asia is still called a corrupt continent. However, this is a true statement and what happened was nothing new in Asia, where we have seen many similar cirmumstances throughout the years.\n\nWhen it comes to match-fixing, Asia is known as the absolute best in the world at corruption and fixing. Accordingly, it wouldn't be hard to give this match the first prize for being the most obvious evidence of match-fixing and a terrific show of corruption ever witnessed in football anywhere before.\n\nIran played in a game that should have easily won if it was played in any other continent or country for that matter. But obviously, not in China, and absolutely NOT IN ASIA, where God knows what goes on below the surface of the AFC. This Confederation seems to be a simple propaganda for bagging more dollars and preparing for future behind-the-curtain deals for the people in power.\n\nIn this match, the Iranian team showed a decent performance knowing the fact that they were playing against the host team. They also knew they were against a lower-class Chinese team, who actually did not have much to offer in the span of the 120 minutes facing the Iranians. Nevertheless, the Chinese were pumped up and charged by the fact that the result and the outcome of the game was determined before the match even started: behind closed doors. The Lebanese referee Talaat Najm served his masters and did everything in his power, given and endorsed by AFC. He blundered to all the rules within the game of football to do what he was told to do: send China to the 13th Asian Cup Final, no matter what.\n\nChinese put themselves on the score sheet first in the 18th minute of the game. The first goal was scored by Hao Haidong from a nice pass which put the Chinese ahead. The refereeing was acceptable as long as the Chinese were ahead 1-0. But right after Iran scored the equalizer, from a powerful low shot by Sayyed Mohammad Alavi, through a nice setup by playmaker Mahdavikia, everything was to be changed and the real face of the evil would start to appear.\n\nAfter Iran's goal, hell broke down and the referee stole the show from the players and became the comedian of the match by red-carding the young Iranian defender Zarea. He was objecting to the Chinese player's greatly exaggerated dive from a simple pushing situation in front of the goal. In this incident, the Chinese player, Shao Jiayi, also deserved an Oscar for his act, falling on the grass and puling off a familiar Bahraini trick on Iran.\n\nThis immediately reminded the referee, who is an Arab, to show Zarea the red card. Coincidentally, AFC went against all of Iran's previous pleas to AFC that Arab referees are not wanted to judge Iran's games due to the bias in their rulings towards the Persians because of the historical feud between Persians and Arabs. Najm took over the game and had a nice display of his previous arrangements with those who wanted the Chinese team to go through to their second final in Chinese football history, and book a place in the most undeserved final of the history of football.\n\nA Chinese team which were given everything in the game, including the one man advantage and ruling support but could only scrape a 1-1 tie against the demoralized Iranians, didn't have the juice and character of a champion and should not have been so much favored.\n\nThe referee, who perhaps whistled more than 10 consecutive bad calls against the Iranian players, made Iran's bench want to quit the match. When Ali Karimi was on his way to score the victory goal with only minutes left of the match, the Chinese defender tackeled to stop and possibly injure the Iranian star who was passed three defenders and was one-on-one with the Chinese goalkeeper. The referee shockingly did Iran a \"favor\" by giving the Chinese player, who clearly deserved nothing less than a red card, a mere yellow card.\n\nIn many instances where the Chinese players were attacking the Iranian players with their harsh fouls, the referee shamefully gave the warning to the wrong side. When the Chinese substitute, number 7, Sun Jihai, did everything he could to harm Iranians, NOT EVEN a single foul was called against him in the whole match.\n\nThe Chinese were given a promise that they will have a final place. It was more than just obvious and anyone who reads this and has seen the match knows that very well.\n\nIt was a crime committed in daylight. Everyone saw it. There is no excuse. There is no explanation and there is no cause for these kinds of shameless acts, although most of the people in the AFC will continue to sell their pride as they have for the last 50 years.\n\nPFDC and I sincerely hope that there is one person in the AFC who reads this and realizes their crimes done on the young players who give the competition their best and play their hearts out to make their nations proud. Some serious questions arise after all this: Is this the reason you joined AFC? To use your powers to bring down the unique interest of the Iranian fans and make them disappointed that they will not win a championship again as long as you or likes of you are at the helm of the AFC?\n\nFootball is a sport that has no value without its fans and rest assured that you (AFC) might have satisfied the hosts and gave them a nice gift, but the passion of the fans is nothing to be played with.\n\nWe, the real fans of football, no matter where we come from; Iran, Korea, Japan and etc, will one day take revenge from the people who have deprived us from our absolute rights.\n\nThis shall not and will not continue like this. Therefore, I encourage every fan to take their passion seriously and boycott the Asian events until there is a supervising committee which can watch the AFC and its administration created by FIFA. Otherwise, it would not be worth following or supporting anymore, especially when the fans spend so much time and money for the AFC thugs to bag the benefit and send the fans and players crying back home.\n\nI encourage everyone to see the teardrops of the young Iranian player, Sattar Zarea, who got his chance to play in his first ever Asian Cup. The baseless decision to eject the youngster should be witnessed. Watching young Zarea burst into tears because of his disappointment and shock reminds us all of the major change that the AFC is in need of.\n\nThe rubbish about promoting the game and fair play that is posted on the AFC website and is displayed to Asia and the whole world is all for show. In fact, it does not have the slightest similarity to fairness and how to promote it in real life.\n\nWhen a competition is pre-determined, when a referee does the most ignorant and incompetent job by adding injury time to both 15-minutes extra times, it is an indication of a totally absurd invention and improvision by the referee which is totally outside and against the laws of FIFA. All the incompetence makes one think of who approved the referee's application. Could it be another Arab?\n\nNow what do you (AFC) really expect? For the fans to sit quietly and do nothing?\n\nI can promise you, one day will come that you are sitting on your rocking chairs and the young and furious fans of Asia will take over your jobs. I can also assure you that they will not glorify the past days of the AFC and will burry the corrupted body of the AFC in the ground. That day will come. Don't ever doubt.\n\nAmen to that!"
