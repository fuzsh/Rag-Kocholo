        "text": "GREENSBORO — It’s no secret that to win the Wyndham Championship, it’s likely going to be a race to get to 20 under par over the 72 holes at Sedgefield County Club.\n\nThe 85th edition of one of the longest running PGA Tour tournaments on the schedule will begin Thursday and will, once again, be the final regular-season tournament before the FedEx Cup playoffs. With the forecast not looking promising thanks to Tropical Storm Debby, it’s shaping up to be a wet golf tournament.\n\nThe winner, however, will still likely have to make a bundle of birdies and probably a couple of eagles.\n\nIn the last eight tournaments played at the Donald Ross layout, the winner was 20 under par or better in seven of those tournaments. The exception was Kevin Kisner who finished at 15 under, along with five other golfers in 2021. Kisner eventually won in a playoff.\n\nLast year’s champion, Lucas Glover, finished at 20 under with four rounds in the 60s that included a third-round 62.\n\nDepending on how much rain falls this week the greens could be softened up so much golfers can take even more dead aim at pins.\n\nWill Zalatoris, a former Wake Forest star, is looking forward to making a lot of birdies.\n\n“I love playing in majors, I love the toughness of them,” Zalatoris said. “My game was not prepared for them this year, so I think it’s a really good thing to go out and play an event where I can go and put up six, seven birdies in a round, something like that. Good for the confidence given all I’ve had to go through.”\n\nThanks to what could be plenty of rain this week, the course could be softer, and this will make it easier to go for even more pins than usual.\n\n“My goal this week is to try to move up as far as I can in the FedEx Cup and head into the playoffs on a high note,” said Jordan Spieth. “I love the golf course, and I think it’s spectacular. You can’t hide your game. And I like the Bermuda. You’ve got to think your way around it. You can’t really miss above the hole out here.”\n\nHere are five golfers to watch:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nJordan Spieth\n\nMark Brazil, the executive tournament director, and Bobby Powell, the tournament director, have brought in one of the deepest fields in recent memories. One of the big names is Spieth, who can still make a lot of birdies. He ranks 37th in the world and is 62nd on the FedEx Cup points list. This is a key week for him as he tries to stay inside the top 70 to advance to the playoffs.\n\nJustin Rose\n\nHe made a run at the British Open last month and is more than capable of doing that around these parts. Rose, 44, has plenty of game to get it done. He’s had three top 10 showings here through the years and is still ranked 34th in the world. Lucas Glover won here last year at the age of 43, so experience might be Rose’s friend this week.\n\nBilly Horschel\n\nBilly Ho is due, especially around Sedgefield. He finished second in 2020 and if not for a sluggish final round last year where he ended up fourth, he might have won. He also made a run at the British Open that boosted his confidence and he should bring that confidence to a course he loves. A few years ago, he talked about how much he likes the strategy involved with the Donald Ross greens. Five times since 2016 he has finished 11th or better here.\n\nShane Lowry\n\nMaking his sixth appearance in Greensboro will be Lowry, who has a win this season on the PGA Tour and is 10th on the FedEx Cup points list. His best finish is a tie for seventh in 2017, and last year he tied for 51st at Sedgefield. If his putter can get hot, the 37-year-old Irishmen could be in contention on Sunday.\n\nBrian Harman\n\nHe comes in as the highest-ranked golfer in the field at No. 15. Harman did not play in last year’s Wyndham Championship but has two top 10 finishes. Harman isn’t a bomber off the tee, but at Sedgefield you don’t have to be. His short game is more than good enough to win at Sedgefield and if you have to keep it in the fairway even more this week with the weather, he’s the guy to do it. For those wondering, the last left-handed golfer to win here was Bob Charles in 1974.\n\njdell@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-4081\n\n@johndellWSJ\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nJohn Dell\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
