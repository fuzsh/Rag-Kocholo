        "text": "Fairfield University Men’s Soccer alumnus Matt Turner ’17 has been selected to be a part of the United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) for the upcoming FIFA World Cup, which begins later this month in Qatar. Turner is on track to be the starting goalkeeper for the USMNT.\n\nTurner made his international debut with the United States in January of 2021. He went on to start all six matches in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup and was named Best Goalkeeper of the tournament as the United States won the tournament crown.\n\nTurner is also currently a member of Arsenal FC of the Premier League, earning four caps in the UEFA Europa League this past summer. Previously, Turner started for the New England Revolution for Major League Soccer, wrapping up his MLS career as 2021 Goalkeeper of the Year.\n\nAt Fairfield, Turner took over the starting goalkeeper job as a junior after two seasons behind Michael O’Keeffe ‘13, who represented New Zealand in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Turner led the nation in save percentage and shutout percentage in 2014 and was an All-MAAC Second Team selection in 2015.\n\nThe United States plays its first match of the FIFA World Cup on November 21 against Iran. The USMNT will also play England, Iran, and Wales for a potential berth in the knockout stage running from Dec. 3-18."
