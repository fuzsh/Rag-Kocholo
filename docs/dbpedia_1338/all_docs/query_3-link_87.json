        "text": "Let me pick out this one;\n\nI'd say that plausibly Serie A doesn't belong in the highest tier (yet).\n\nTheir average UEFA country ranking was 9.4 in these years, but the depth of the teams was solid yes. That is always the issue with many 'best league' arguments.\n\nThe 'big' spending became progressively bigger in 1982 and then in 1984 especially.\n\nUntil 1982 Serie A was clearly outspend by the Primera Division, that had a consistent rank between 2nd and 6th in the six years prior. It had a clear upper hand in buying the highest valued stars, and also a sleight edge in the mid-level ones.\n\nThe phase that Serie A was more or less dominant in 'world record level' signings and the mid-level stars was from 1984 to 2000 roughly, with a peak between 1989 and 1995 as you indicate (with that I agree). This was probably unprecedented, yes. With the likes of Francescoli at Cagliari and Hagi at Brescia.\n\nThey got competition from La Liga (for both the Ronaldos and mid-level stars) and Premier League in the 2nd half of the 1990s. In 1996 the Premier League surpassed the Serie A in revenues for the first time (source: Deloitte).\n\nFor example La Liga had phases that they were dominant in the 'world record' stratospheres, but then not dominant at mid-level (for example the gradual losing of Silva, Mata of Valencia etc. after the 2008 financial crisis with even Atletico Madrid losing players as Aguero, Diego Costa to EPL).\n\nThank you for your comments.\n\nI admit that I'm not taking account some financial indicators as you do (revenues, transfer fees, etc) and I think is a good factor to improve the lists, if you have the link, would be nice.\n\nTalking about, Serie-A, in the first half of the 1980s, its country ranking put them in between highest/second tiers. I give them the benefit of the doubt, because the depth in local/foreign talent, even their clubs underperformed at intl. stage\n\nUntil now, the 1990-I era, with Serie-A in a class in its own (the highest) is unprecedent in the modern era. But, I'm thinking in two older precedents (one at wartime and the other pre WW-I)\n\nEuropean Club Elo is not a very reliable gauge of the strength of the Italian league during much of the 1980s. This is mainly because of the time lag.\n\nAt the end of the 1981-82 season, no Italian club had reached the European Cup Final for nine years. The last time an Italian club had lifted the trophy was in the 1960s. Italy then won the 1982 World Cup.\n\nJuventus were strong favourites to win the 1983 European Cup Final, fielding six members of the 1982 World Cup winning team, plus Platini and Boniek whose national teams were World Cup semi-finalists. Immediately after losing that final Juventus, probably the strongest club on the continent, had a European Club Elo rating of 19th. Serie A champions Roma were ranked 30th. The next highest Italian club Fiorentina were placed 61st.\n\nA year later there were only three Italian clubs in the Top 30. Serie A champions Juventus had risen to third place, European Cup runners-up Roma were 7th and Inter Milan 30th.\n\nAfter 1984/85, European Champions Juventus were ranked 5th by Elo, Roma 13th, Inter 16th and national champions Verona 22nd.\n\nAfter 1985/86, Juventus 6th, Roma 12th, with no others in the Top 30.\n\nAt the end of the 1986/87 season, Juventus were 8th, Serie A champions Napoli 15th, Inter 24th and Roma 28th.\n\nAfter 1987/88, AC Milan 11th, Napoli 18th, Juventus 29th.\n\nArguably it is only at the end of the 1988/89 season when Elo gets it right. AC Milan are now 2nd, Inter 3rd and Napoli 4th. Even then Liverpool retain Elo's top spot despite having being banned from Europe for the previous four seasons - another example of time lag.\n\nThere is a thread on the highest transfer fees.\n\nhttps://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/highest-transfer-fees-ever.2065968/\n\nAt the moment Serie A really started to spend big (in 1982, increasing in 1984) Real Madrid and (domestically underperforming) Barcelona were #1 and #2 in the UEFA team ranking of 1983. Yes, there is a time lag, but this applies to all rising and falling leagues then, not just Serie A.\n\nThe average UEFA league ranking is 9.4 - as mentioned above.\n\nThe season-by-season performances (without time lag) are 12th in 1980, 6th, 14th, 6th and then 2nd in 1984.\n\nYou can also see it in the top five of the South American Footballer of the year.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1984 these top five players ended up in Spain (within the same timeframe): Julio Montero, Miguel Angel Brindisi, Fernando Morena, Carlos Caszely, Marinho Chagas, Luis Pereira, Mario Kempes, Dirceu, Diego Maradona, Patricio Yanez\n\nThese ended up in Italy: Falcao, Zico, Uribe. Both Uribe and Falcao made the move after they ended in the top 10 for the first time in their career.\n\nAs for the revenues thing.\n\nhttp://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4744...el-what-caused-serie-a-to-lose-its-financial-\n\nLooking the Highest Transfer Fees.\n\nIn the 2005-09 era, there's only one case in Russia league, maybe not enough to upgrade to 3rd tier. The most called are in 1st tier league as expected.\n\nIn the 2000-04 era, most cases are in 1st tier, three exceptions are in 2nd tier.\n\nIn the 1995-99 era, english clubs expend as much as 1st tier leagues, so even their clubs underperformed, the local/foreign talent was there. So, it's the upgrade is debatable.\n\nIn the 1990-94 era, Bundesliga is mentioned as much as french clubs, Ligue-1 ranking is equal to 2nd tier, but I guess the talent there wasn't comparable to 2nd tier, it could be a case to check the gap between them wasn't big.\n\nIn the 1985-89 era , La Liga and Bundesliga are hardly mentioned, meanwhile french and scottish clubs do. Maybe, cases to considering.\n\nIn the 1980-84 era, mainly italian and english clubs are mentioned, but for the prices, maybe a market value of the main clubs, if available, could be a better indicator.\n\nI don't mentioned the 2010s, but I'm guessing that Japan, chinese leagues and MLS comes into the map in the 4th tier.\n\nSure, many are aware of that (the First Division opened theirs in 1978; previously there was the requirement to live for two years in the UK before one could start playing).\n\nBut it took time to develop the full effects. There wasn't immediate big spending in 1980. Maradona went to La Liga and not to Serie A.\n\nCountry coefficients (no time lag):\n\n1980: Germany 1st, France 2nd, Spain 4th, England 6th, Italy 12th\n\n1981: Germany 2nd, England 3rd, France 5th, Italy 6th, Spain 7th (Netherlands 1st)\n\n1982: Germany 1st, Spain 4th, England 6th, Italy 14th, France 17th\n\n1983: Germany 2nd, Spain 5th, Italy 6th, France 12th, England 16th (Scotland 1st)\n\n1984: England 1st, Italy 2nd, France 13th, Spain 16th, Germany 17th\n\nNow, with England one can say that they won consistently European Cups, or played the final, and took this competition more serious than the other two. But I'm not sure there's a credible excuse for Italy being consistently behind three other leagues until 1983.\n\nThe UEFA coefficients (and the methodology) are also a bit political and not set in stone, but it reflects Italy had some ground to cover and make up.\n\nTeam coefficients (no time lag):\n\n1980: best ranked Italian team behind the best English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Scottish, Yugoslavian etc. teams\n\n1981: best ranked Italian team behind the best English (Liverpool on #1), Spanish, Soviet, German and Dutch teams.\n\n1982: best ranked Italian team behind the best English, German, Spanish, Soviet, French, Dutch etc. teams.\n\n1983: best ranked Italian team behind the best German, Scottish, Belgian and Spanish team (Spanish team ranked ahead on tie-breaker).\n\n1984: Juventus was ranked behind Liverpool at #1, ahead of Barcelona at #3.\n\nSo their best team didn't measure up particularly well either.\n\nThis outflux of main players wasn't something new. It was only less noticeable because they moved (at times) out of the picture for the national teams (Julinho for example).\n\nCBF their own data show an export of 100-200 players each year, until 1993.\n\nIf you look at the best players by birthyear, by myself or 'TalkSport', then all except Pelé went to Europe sooner or later. From Jairzinho to Caszely or Cubillas. Look at the best by birthyear from 1940 onward and see how many (eventually) responded to the call from Europe. Sometimes in their late 20s, but sometimes also earlier.\n\nBy the late 1970s it was near to full swing. The \"main player\" of Brazil during the 1978 World Cup was unquestionably Dirceu. It didn't take long before he ended up at Atletico Madrid.\n\nOf Argentina, a handful starters responded to the opening of the First Division (in 1978) as we all know. The \"main player\" Kempes was already in Europe.\n\nOn Zico there were doubts by European teams, too (based on performances against them).\n\nIf you look at the topscorer table of the 1979 Metropolitano and Nacional, then you see that all of them tried in Europe during the nearby surrounding years (Babington in the 2nd division etc.). In 90% of the cases they were not a success, by the way, but that is a different topic.\n\nAs I said: if there is a time lag for rising leagues, then there is also one for other leagues?\n\nI don't express well the idea. The new, wasn't the outflux of main players, in his late 20s.\n\nThe new, is the stars outflux in his early 20s and the increase of the outflux, not 100 players as it used to be, but 300 or more around the world. The WC squads since the 1980s show that, compared to previous rosters, also at Copa America.\n\nTwo different problems"
