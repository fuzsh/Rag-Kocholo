Photo: Shane Wenzlick / Phototek.\n\nThe Futsal Ferns are ranked 26th of the 69 nations included in the first set of ratings produced for women’s teams.\n\nFutsal Whites head coach Marvin Eakins said: “It’s great to have FIFA finally release an official ranking system for futsal for both the men’s and women’s teams.\n\n“To have the Futsal Whites recognised as a top 20 team is a huge honour, and it’s a testament to the work the entire futsal community has put in across the country to continually grow the game and push for higher and higher standards.\n\n“The World Cup is massive for New Zealand futsal, so we want to make sure we seize the moment and continue the momentum of what we have been building.”\n\nBrazil are ranked first in both the men’s and women’s lists.\n\nThough the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men’s World Rankings for football have existed since December 1992 and women’s senior national football teams have been officially ranked by FIFA since 2003, that has not previously been the case for futsal.\n\nHowever, the indoor game has enjoyed exponential growth in recent years and this milestone moment represents the natural next step, as well as being the first time FIFA men’s and women’s rankings have been launched concurrently.\n\nNew Zealand heads the Oceania rankings\n\nThe New Zealand men’s team are the highest-ranked country in the Oceania Football Confederation, followed by Tahiti (45), the Solomon Islands (59), New Caledonia (65), Vanuatu (71), Fiji (77), American Samoa (115), Samoa (132) and Tonga (137).\n\nThe New Zealand women are also the highest-ranked team from OFC, with New Caledonia the other ranked women’s team at 33.\n\nBroadcasts of the FIFA Futsal World Cup in Lithuania in 2021 attracted an average of 2.42 million viewers per match, a 130% increase on the previous edition in 2016.\n\nThe 2024 FIFA Futsal World Cup in Uzbekistan — which is set to be the first FIFA tournament to be staged in Central Asia — is likely to improve even on those numbers, and a historic first FIFA Futsal Women’s World Cup will be held in 2025.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, FIFA has rolled out global rankings for its member associations’ women’s and men’s senior futsal national teams in recognition of the dynamic development of and global interest in the sport.\n\nHow the rankings have been calculated\n\nThe initial rankings have been based on statistics gathered from more than 4,600 “A” matches.\n\nFIFA defines an international “A” match as a match between two FIFA members for which both members field their first representative team (“A” team).\n\nThe new rankings system will also serve to seed teams for all upcoming editions of the FIFA Futsal World Cup, including during the draw to be made on May 26 for the 2024 competition in Uzbekistan.\n\nThe system will likewise be used for qualification processes and enable comprehensive and consistent data to be gathered to monitor member associations in accordance with the FIFA Regulations Governing International Matches.\n\nThat will support the prevention of practices that jeopardise the integrity of the sport, such as match manipulation.\n\nIn the nine editions of the FIFA Futsal World Cup to date, the inaugural top-ranked men’s side, Brazil, have been crowned world champions five times and only failed to finish on the podium once. They are closely followed in the chart by Portugal, who arrive at this year’s FIFA Futsal World Cup as the title holders and have won the last two European crowns.\n\nPortugal’s Iberian neighbours Spain — double FIFA Futsal World Cup winners (2000 and 2004) and seven-time European champions — are third in the standings.\n\nBrazil’s women’s national team have been just as dominant as their male counterparts, having won all seven of the South American championships that they have contested. Spain and Portugal are again behind them in the women’s ranking, albeit in reverse order: three-time European champions Spain are second, with Portugal – who have finished runners-up to their Iberian rivals in two continental finals – in third.\n\nFans interested in attending the 2024 FIFA Futsal World Cup Uzbekistan 2024 can register to receive ticketing updates here.\n\nMen’s rankings\n\nReleased on May 7, 2024\n\nWomen’s rankings\n\nReleased on May 7, 2034"
