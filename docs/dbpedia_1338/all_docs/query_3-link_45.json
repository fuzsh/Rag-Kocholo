        "text": "Tornadoes in Western New York are rare. Tornadoes that touch down in the City of Buffalo are almost unheard of.\n\nSo, it is no surprise that a twister that flipped a car, ripped the roof off of at least two buildings and left massive tree branches scattered through the West Side and downtown grabbed the attention of Western New Yorkers and generated national headlines.\n\nThe twister did not appear to cause any injuries or worse, but it left a memorable trail of devastation in its path, from toppled trees and damaged roofs to cars flipped over and windows blown out of buildings.\n\nNo injuries were reported, and the path of destruction was relatively narrow, compared to the widespread damage in other area storms such as the blizzard of 2022, the October storm of 2006 or the knife storm of 2014. But the unlikely weather event, which produced harrowing images shared widely online, is one that is likely to stick in the minds of people across the region for years to come.\n\nThe Buffalo News spoke to Buffalo National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Fries and longtime WIVB meteorologist Don Paul – now a columnist for The News – about the maybe-once-in-a-lifetime weather event.\n\nHas there ever been a tornado in the City of Buffalo?\n\nA tornado had never touched down in the city limits, at least dating to 1950, the earliest available data on record with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration mapped by the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. The closest thing to happen was a brief landfall of a waterspout near the U.S. Coast Guard station across the Buffalo River from Erie Basin Marina in 2017.\n\nPaul said that weather event, while unusual, did not get much attention at the time.\n\n“Very little was said about it in public information from the National Weather Service,” he said. “I’m a big fan of the National Weather Service and I, myself, was not fully aware of it. They didn’t put out the kind of statement they did yesterday.”\n\nOne of the reasons the city has not been hit before is the stabilizing effect of Lake Erie, which generally insulates it from the sort of weather conditions that create tornadoes. But yesterday, the conditions on the lake may have actually worked to help create the extreme weather, Paul said.\n\n“It can create more potential for a spin up of rotation and a thunderstorm,” he said.\n\nHow bad was this tornado?\n\nOn the Enhanced Fujita Scale – the scale used by meteorologists to measure the strength of a tornado, commonly referred to as the EF Scale – this tornado registered as an EF-1, second from the bottom and categorized as a weak tornado.\n\nBut that label can be a little misleading. While yesterday’s storm pales in comparison to the destruction wrought by an EF-5 – the type of tornado that can level whole neighborhoods, as happened in Oklahoma in 1999 – winds still reached speeds exceeding 90 mph and caused severe damage. And while the path of the storm was narrow compared to the snow and ice storms Western New Yorkers are used to, the 300 yard maximum width was considerably wider than that of a typical EF-1 tornado.\n\nFries said there are several factors, including the damage done to buildings and trees, that are used to determine the severity, and this tornado was close to being classified as EF-2.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“Most of the structures had no damage,” he said. “The majority of it was tree damage. It only moved cars, really, in one place.”\n\nA tornado blew through Buffalo on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.\n\nWhy was there no warning from the National Weather Service or other agencies?\n\nTornadoes, especially those with short durations such as yesterday’s six-minute twister, can be extremely hard to predict, even with the best technology. The Doppler system the NWS uses has to image the atmosphere in layers and only produces one image every five minutes. For the NWS to issue an effective warning in that time is next to impossible.\n\n“Small tornadoes that are short-lived are very difficult to get a timely warning out,” Paul said. “Bigger tornadoes that come from supercells are much more successfully warned and almost never strike anymore without warning.”\n\nFries said the NWS had issued severe storm warnings earlier in the day. But the cell activity evolved so quickly, no one would have even got a warning by the time the whole event was done.\n\n“When it’s a larger tornado that’s on the ground for a long time, you can put out warnings way ahead of time,” Fries said. “That’s a different case. Newly formed tornadoes are more difficult to put out warnings for when you’re following a cell that’s been dropping them, you can put them out a lot longer beforehand.”\n\nIs there any evidence that climate change is contributing to the higher number of tornadoes in New York State this year?\n\nThe 26 confirmed tornadoes across the state this year, including four that touched down south of Buffalo on July 10, is the most in recorded history, one more than the 25 in 1992.\n\nResearch from climate scientists has established links between increased incidents and severity of extreme weather events, including hurricanes. But, for tornadoes, the links, so far, are tenuous, at best.\n\nThere is even some evidence that while there have been more severe tornadoes as the planet has warmed, there have been fewer total tornadoes in recent years, Paul said.\n\n“The link between warming and tornadoes is still poorly understood,” he said.\n\nFries said that while the severity of tornado damage has increased, there has been no clear evidence of a link between those stats and climate change.\n\n“There are certainly trends that are sticking out, the statistics, in terms of increased severe weather and tornadic activity in the United States over the last couple of decades,” Fries said. “It’s really tough to pin any one event or any one year to that.”\n\nHow does the damage compare to other Western New York weather events?\n\nCity officials held a news conference Tuesday afternoon to give updates on clean-up efforts. While they were adamant about how extensive the damage was, they also noted how fortunate it was that there were no injuries reported, let alone fatalities or serious injuries. The blizzard two years ago killed at least 47 people. At least 13 people died in the October storm and at least six died in the Wall of Snow storm in 2014.\n\nDuring the news conference, Mayor Byron Brown said early property damage estimates exceed $2.5 million, a number he expects to rise significantly.\n\n“That is just between four buildings located in the effected area,” he said. “We expect that number to increase well into the millions.”\n\nWhile property damage estimates for the other storms were not readily available, those storms had less severe effects, but covered much larger areas and had a great deal of damage done during the clean up process.\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nJustin Sondel\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
