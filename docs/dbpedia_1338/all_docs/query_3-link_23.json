        "text": "The final four places will be determined via confederation playoffs, to be played in March 2026. There is no path to the World Cup through FIFA's intercontinental playoffs.\n\nThe UEFA playoff involves 16 teams: the 12 runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the 2024-25 UEFA Nations League, who did not finish in the top two in World Cup qualifying. This creates four routes, each with four teams featuring a semifinal and a final for a place at the World Cup.\n\nSouth America (CONMEBOL)\n\n6 auto + 1 playoff\n\nAs in recent qualifying competitions, all 10 nations play each other home and away. The top six nations qualify directly to the finals. The seventh-placed team will go into the intercontinental playoffs in March 2026.\n\nThe first qualifiers took place in September 2023, with the league phase to be completed in September 2025.\n\n- Check out the fixtures and results | Latest table\n\nNorth America, Central America, Caribbean (Concacaf)\n\n3 auto + 2 playoff\n\nUsually, Concacaf would have six automatic places in qualifying -- but for the 2026 finals three of the six are taken up by the hosts. That leaves three places to be won, plus two spots in the intercontinental playoffs.\n\nConcacaf saw 32 nations enter the race to make the finals.\n\nRound 1: The four lowest-ranked Concacaf nations battled it out in two-legged ties. Anguilla and British Virgin Islands eliminated Turks and Caicos Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands respectively, both on penalties.\n\nRound 2: The top 28-ranked nations, plus the two winners from Round 1, were drawn into six groups of five teams. The six group winners and six group runners-up will move on to Round 3. This stage will be played in two blocks, one in June 2024 and the other in June 2025.\n\n- Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Latest tables\n\nRound 3: The 12 remaining teams will be drawn into three groups of four teams. The group winners will qualify for the World Cup, with the two runners-up with the best record going on to take part in the intercontinental playoffs. This phase will be played in September, October and November 2025.\n\nAfrica (CAF)\n\n9 auto + 1 playoff\n\nThere were 54 FIFA-affiliated nations in the draw, but Eritrea subsequently withdrew.\n\nRound 1: The 53 teams are in eight groups of six nations, and one group of five. The nine group winners qualify for the World Cup,\n\nThis stage began in November 2023 and will be completed in October 2025.\n\n- Check out the latest fixtures and results here | Latest tables\n\nRound 2: The four best runners-up will enter playoffs (two semifinals and a final) to decide which one country will go to the intercontinental playoffs. This stage will be played in November 2025.\n\nAsia (AFC)\n\n8 auto + 1 playoff\n\nThis is by some distance the most complicated route to the World Cup, with a layered qualifying process which creates a dual group stage to find the eight automatic qualifiers.\n\nRound 1: The 20 lowest-ranked nations played two-legged ties in October 2023. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore and Yemen advanced.\n\nRound 2: Those 10 winners joined the 26 best-ranked nations. The 36 teams were drawn into nine groups of four teams, with the top two nations going through to Round 3. This stage began in November 2023 and will be completed in June 2024.\n\n- Check out the latest results here | Final tables\n\nAdvanced: Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan\n\nRound 3: We're now left with 18 nations, who will be drawn into three groups of six teams in July. Matches will be held from September 2024 through to June 2025\n\nThe group winners and runners up will take the first six places at the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThe six nations who finished in third and fourth move on to round 4.\n\nRound 4: The six teams in this stage will be drawn into two groups of three. They will play each other once, so two matches, on neutral ground in October 2025.\n\nThe group winners take the final two automatic places at the World Cup.\n\nThe runners-up continue on to Round 5.\n\nRound 5: The two runners-up will play a two-legged tie in November 2025 to earn the place in the intercontinental playoffs.\n\nOceania (OFC)\n\n1 auto + 1 playoff\n\nAll 11 members of the OFC region will take part.\n\nRound 1: The four lowest-ranked nations will play a knockout format (two semis and a final) in September 2024 for a place in round two. The games will be played in Samoa.\n\nAmerican Samoa, Cook Islands, Samoa and Tonga take part.\n\nRound 2: The winners from round one join the seven top-ranked nations.\n\nThe eight nations have been drawn into two groups of four nations, with matches played in October and November 2024. Games will be held in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.\n\nGroup A: Solomon Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea\n\nGroup B: New Zealand, Tahiti, Vanuatu and the round one winner\n\nThe top two countries in each group go on to round three.\n\nRound 3: Four countries remain, and will play a knockout format (two semis and a final) in March 2025.\n\nThe winners of the final qualifies for the World Cup, with the losers playing in the intercontinental playoff.\n\nIntercontinental playoffs (2 places)\n\nThe playoffs, to be held in March 2026, will determine the final two qualifiers.\n\nSix countries will take part. Each of the five confederations (apart from UEFA) will have one country in the playoffs. The host confederation (so for this edition Concacaf) receives a second slot.\n\n1 Africa\n\n1 Asia\n\n2 Concacaf\n\n1 Oceania\n\n1 South America\n\nThe two nations with the best FIFA World Ranking will be seeded and go straight into one of the two finals.\n\nThe four other countries will be drawn to play a semifinal, feeding through to play one of the seeds for one of the two places at the World Cup.\n\nThe playoffs are due to be held in one of the World Cup host nations as a test event."
