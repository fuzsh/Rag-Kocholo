        "text": "(Last Updated On: )\n\nAfghanistan’s national futsal team lost 3-1 against Iran in their first match in AFC Futsal Asian Cup 2024 Thailand.\n\nThis match between the national futsal teams of Afghanistan and Iran was held in the “D” group of this competition in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nMehran Ghulami scored the only goal for Afghanistan.\n\nThe national futsal players will face Kuwait in their second game next week.\n\nAfghanistan is in the same group as Iran, Bahrain and Kuwait in the Futsal Asian Cup.\n\nThe Futsal Asian Cup is also a qualifier for the World Cup for 16. countries.\n\n(Last Updated On: )\n\nAsadkhuja Muydinkhujaev and Lazizbek Mullojonov won gold on Friday as Uzbekistan took the lead in the boxing medal tally for the Paris Olympics, while Algeria’s Imane Khelif claimed victory in the women’s welterweight final.\n\nMuydinkhujaev beat Mexico’s Marco Verde in the men’s welterweight boxing final by unanimous decision. American Omari Jones and Lewis Richardson of Britain took bronze after their semi-final defeats, Reuters reported.\n\nIn Friday’s bout, world champion Muydinkhujaev did well to keep out of range and then struck with venom whenever the Mexican attempted to bridge the gap as he took a comfortable lead heading into the final round.\n\nWith his defeat all but guaranteed, Mexico’s Verde went in all guns blazing but he had left it too late and, despite winning the third round, Muydinkhujaev was declared the winner.\n\nMullojonov also won gold, beating Azerbaijan’s Loren Alfonso, to add to Hasanboy Dusmatov’s flyweight win on Thursday, putting Uzbekistan ahead of China, who have two gold medals.\n\nUzbekistan can add two more gold medals to their tally if Abdumalik Khalokov (featherweight) and Bakhodir Jalolov (super heavyweight) win their respective finals on Saturday.\n\nAsked about Uzbekistan’s dominant showing in the boxing competition, Muydinkhujaev said: “We support each other. We respect each other. We are not just a team, we are a family.\n\n“That is why we are so successful. We respect our coaches, they are like our fathers.\n\n“My teammates still have to compete in their finals. I wish them well and hope we take five gold medals back to Uzbekistan.”\n\nKHELIF WINS\n\nAlgeria’s Imane Khelif, the female boxer thrust into the centre of a gender dispute at the Paris Games, beat China’s Yang Liu to take the welterweight Olympic gold medal.\n\nKhelif kept her opponent at bay with her jab and took control of the bout as she cruised to a third unanimous win in the tournament and became the first Algerian woman to earn an Olympic boxing title.\n\nChina had a mixed night, with Liu’s defeat being balanced out by Wu Yu’s victory over Turkey’s Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the flyweight final.\n\nWu fought with real ferocity to beat Tokyo silver medallist Cakiroglu by a 4-1 decision.\n\n“This is my first time at an Olympic Games. So many people try to qualify and I’m so happy to win the gold medal,” Wu said.\n\n“I have trained very hard and all that hard work paid off. I won the gold for my team, my coach, my country.”\n\nRelated stories:\n\nAthletics-Nadeem wins javelin gold for Pakistan\n\nCuban Greco-Roman wrestler Mijain Lopez wins record fifth straight Gold, and then retires\n\n(Last Updated On: )\n\nArshad Nadeem won gold in the Olympic men’s javelin on Thursday, beating defending champion Neeraj Chopra of India to clinch Pakistan’s first Olympic medal in athletics.\n\nNadeem threw his arms up in celebration after breaking the Olympic record on his second throw with a stunning 92.97 metres that put him sixth on the all-time list, Reuters reported.\n\n“When I threw the javelin, I got the feel of it leaving my hand, and sensed it could be an Olympic record, inshallah (God willing),” Nadeem said.\n\nHe knelt down and kissed the ground after Chopra’s failed last attempt sealed his victory. The Pakistani finished fifth in Tokyo, but improved to take silver at last year’s world championships.\n\nChopra, the strongest by far in qualifying and favourite to retain his title, struggled. His throw of 89.45, which won him the silver medal, was his only valid effort as he fouled on his five other attempts.\n\n“I’m not that happy with my performance today and also my technique and runway was not that good,” said Chopra, who has struggled with a groin injury.\n\nGrenada’s Anderson Peters took bronze with 88.54, a moment of redemption for the twice world champion who failed to make the final at the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nPeters hurled the javelin 88.54m on his fourth attempt to knock Czech Republic’s Jakub Vadlejch, who won silver in Tokyo, into fourth place.\n\nNadeem, who compared his Olympic clash with Chopra to the two nations’ rivalry in cricket, has previously said it is challenging being a non-cricket athlete in Pakistan as resources and facilities for his sport are scarce.\n\nBut if Chopra’s huge following in India since winning Olympic gold is anything to go by, Nadeem’s performance on Thursday could change that.\n\nChopra, who has more than nine million Instagram followers, has had a huge impact in raising the profile of athletics in India, World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said on Thursday.\n\nIndia’s prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted after Chopra’s silver win: “Neeraj Chopra is excellence personified! Time and again he’s shown his brilliance. India is elated that he comes back with yet another Olympic success.”\n\nPeters, meanwhile, said he felt his Caribbean nation’s support.\n\n“The entire population, 120,000 people are glued to their TV right now. Celebrating, cheering,” he said."
