        "text": "Association football is the most popular sport in the world, but there is no consensus around the world for what it is called. The chief governing body is FIFA - FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association, though you don't hear people calling it Association football, usually it's soccer or football, and in non-English speaking countries, it is often some form of the word football, written phonetically (e.g. \"futbol\") or a translation of the word football.\n\nIn the UK, the term Association football came about to distinguish the game from the other versions of football played at the time (e.g. rugby football), and from the 'association' part of the name came the word soccer (assoc.).\n\nAlthough the name soccer came out of the UK, there it is predominantly called football, while elsewhere in a few English speaking countries colonized by the British it is called soccer. You will find that soccer is still the main term for the game in countries in which there is another major sport called football (e.g. USA, Canada, Australia). Check out our poll on what do you call it?\n\nAs you can see in the list below, the sport is not just called either football or soccer. In some countries, the name of the sport may not be clearly one or another, and for some countries and languages it is evolving, typically countries that have traditionally called it soccer are starting to more regularly call it football.\n\nI have tried to find the most commonly used name in each country, and included others if known. In countries in which there is more than one language spoken, there can be more than one name for the game. The lists are not complete. If you have any additions, comments or corrections, please let me know.\n\nName by Nation\n\nsources: the names used around the world for Association Football has been collected from various sources, including originally many from wikipedia, google translate, and added to from visitor feedback.\n\nName by Language\n\nHere are the names for Association Football in the languages of the world.
