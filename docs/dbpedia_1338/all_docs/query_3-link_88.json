Football has been a part of life for Iranians for many decades now and is played in schools, streets, and football clubs nationwide.\n\nFor political and social reasons, women's football grew little from the 1980s to 2020, and clubs such as Persepolis and Esteghlal did not even have a women's football team in these years."
