        "text": "The fates of Angola, Libya and Morocco will be decided this month as the three African representatives learn their opponents for the FIFA Futsal World Cup 2024 in Uzbekistan.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated draw, to be held in the historic Registan Square in Samarkand on May 26th, will shape the paths of the continental trio as they gear up for futsal's biggest stage.\n\nFor Libya and Morocco, the tournament presents an opportunity to build on their growing pedigree in the sport, having featured in multiple previous editions of the World Cup.\n\nAngola, however, will be heading into uncharted territory as futsal debutants on the global stage.\n\nThe Palancas Negras have enjoyed a meteoric rise in recent years, with their third-place finish at the African Championship in January booking their second World Cup appearance.\n\nThey will be eager to continue defying the odds when the draw balls are plucked from the pots in Samarkand's iconic UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nLibya and Morocco, meanwhile, will be hoping to avoid potentially daunting group stage clashes against the likes of record five-time champions Brazil and holders Portugal.\n\nThe two North African nations have previous experience of rubbing shoulders with futsal's heavyweights, but triumphing against such pedigree remains an elusive feat.\n\nBoth teams will be optimistic about progressing from the group phase at the very least, having negotiated that hurdle at previous World Cups.\n\nBut with upstarts like debutants Afghanistan and Tajikistan joining the fray, there are no guarantees in a tournament renowned for its surprises.\n\nAs the grand Registan Square provides a breath-taking backdrop, the three African contenders will await their fates with bated breath, dreams of World Cup glory hanging in the balance with each ball drawn from the pots.\n\nThe 24 teams to play at the FIFA Futsal World Cup Uzbekistan 2024:\n\nAfghanistan, Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, France, Guatemala, IR Iran, Kazakhstan, Libya, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain, Tajikistan, Thailand, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Venezuela."
