        "text": "Next year the Women's World Cup is going be hosted in Australia and New Zealand. This is the first time I believe that a FIFA tournament would be hosted between two nations in different confederations since Australia plays in AFC and New Zealand plays in OFC. That just got me thinking why not have New Zealand just try to join AFC. I know the new WC format would give OFC an chance to qualify but in the end its all about experience and the the type of teams you'll play. NZ would definitely get smashed without playing some good teams. Moving to AFC would provide that much needed boost as they would play against some really good teams.\n\nNot only that but I think interest in football but be boosted due to the fact that NZ are playing against teams like Japan, South Korea, China, Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and their neighbors Australia. Domestic football could take off as the A-League could probably expand more into the nation.\n\nAnother point I wanna bring out is women's football. NZ has never made it past the Group Stage in a women's world cup and they find it difficult to perform in other competitions due to them playing in a weak league. NZ women's team would get to play against much better teams which can result in better performances in tournaments.\n\nThe only issue is that if NZ join AFC. What happens to the leftovers of OFC? It's hard but I see them probably staying together and trying to figure things out as they lose a member. There's no way NZ is gonna develop football if they stay behind in OFC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Just something that was on my mind for the few days.\n\nSome of it may have to do with the fact that the Middle Eastern members of the AFC do not want to have to fly all the way to New Zealand.....not sure what the exact numerical division of members is between the Middle East and East Asia, but I'm guessing that the Middle Eastern members have enough votes to veto New Zealand if they want to.\n\nI've always thought that it would be a good idea to split Asia up into two smaller confederations....China/India/Mongolia would be the westernmost members of the Asian confederation (which would add Oceania's ten members), and Pakistan/Afghanistan/Tajikstan/Kyrgyzstan/Kazakhstan would be the easternmost members of the Middle East federation.\n\nIf AFC were to add New Zealand they would be at 48 teams. You could divide the region easily then.\n\nThe whole point of Australia's move in the 00's was that they were seeking direct WC access, which the OFC had been consistently denied, most recently (at the time) with FIFA reneging on a promise to revisit the question with the distribution of berths for Germany '06.\n\nAnd, most importantly, they left the OFC with the OFC's consent, under an agreement to continue financially supporting the latter.\n\nIn the here and now, neither condition currently exists: OFC's getting their direct WC berth for '26 onward, and there's no way the OFC would sign off on New Zealand exiting without having to contemplate its own dissolution.\n\nAs many here have rightly intuited, the more practical question is when would an OFC/AFC merger + potential AFC split be on the table. From there, the main holdup is what's in it for the OFC bigwigs to convince them to go from having power and budgets to themselves, to jostling with several, more powerful and established fellow bureaucrats in another confederation for benefits.\n\nYeah that's true. I do think AFC and OFC will merge eventually. It's just about when it happens you know. I feel like if and when Concacaf/Conmbeol merge then AFC will follow suit and do the same thing with OFC.\n\nStaying in OFC would be pretty shortsighted for NZ football tbh. It is true that in AFC NZ wouldn't have a de facto guaranteed spot, but with the expansion NZ would probably still make every other edition or so from the AFC. They would also be able to participate in the Asian Cup and their clubs could play in AFC competitions.\n\nIt's up to them now, if they want to take the easy route and get their token two WC games every 4 years, or actually develop their football organically over time by competing more regularly against serious opposition. They certainly may well take the first option, but it will do nothing for the growth of the game in NZ tbh.\n\nYep totally agree with this statement. Football won't grow in the nation unless they play against better teams.\n\nOFC, and by extension NZL, is doing just fine. It secured a whole WWC slot back in 1991, and will receive a whole WC slot in 2026.\n\nAs opposed to the men's sport, OFC has participated since the start of FIFA-organized women's world tournaments. This is how OFC women's NTs received a whole WC slot decades before its male counterparts did.\n\nI doubt that NZL is interested in playing women's AFC qualifiers: a confederation where 52% of Asian members participated in 2023 WWC qualifiers.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_AFC_Women's_Asian_Cup_qualification\n\nBy joining AFC, NZL would dilute its number of competitive matches toward a WWC: NZL devotes its women's international friendlies calendar to seek competitive world rivals. We could even argue that NZL would have failed to host a WWC, if it had to compete for hosting rights from within AFC.\n\nFor the time being NZL men's NT is stuck in OFC, due to women's football dynamics in the region.\n\nOk but like I explained earlier NZ Women's team haven't made it out the group stage in the world cup and have a very bad record in the Olympics as well. Going to AFC and playing against China. Australia, Japan, and SK will give them more experience. Another thing I pointed out is the growth of football in the nation. Football will never grow in the nation if they are playing against the cook islands or Solomon Islands. That's just my view on things. Yes making the World Cup will be easier but will the sport and interest of the game grow if they stay in OFC?? Most likely not\n\nBut the top teams from Asia still play those \"meaningless' games and are still highly ranked and do well in the Women's World Cup and Olympics."
