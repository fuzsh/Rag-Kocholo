The quartet represented the United States, marking the first time an Olympic weapon group was comprised entirely of fencers from the same university.\n\nIn its opening match of the day, the United States faced Iran in the round of eight, as Dershwitz, Saron, and Heathcock took the strip. After the first round of bouts, Iran held a 15-13 lead, as Team USA regained the lead heading into the last three bouts of the match, 30-28. Saron faced Iran's Mohammad Rahbari, as he fell just short in the bout but maintained the United States' advantage, 35-34. After Heathcock won his bout 5-3 to push the United States' lead to 40-37, Iran's Ali Pakdaman won the final bout to secure the victory, 45-44.\n\nIn the first classification match, the United States faced Italy, as the Italians earned the win, 45-40. The Crimson quartet faced Canada in the seventh place match, as stellar performances from Saron, Dolegiewicz, and Heathcock pushed the United States to seventh place honors, 45-43.\n\nTeam events continue on Thursday, Aug. 1, as women's foil individual silver medalist and rising senior Lauren Scruggs will fence with Team USA in the women's foil team competition, while the 2024 NCAA women's foil national champion Jessica Zi Jia Guo will lead Team Canada. The United States will fence China in the opening round, while Canada will face the host nation France. Action begins at 5:50 a.m. and will air live on Peacock.\n\nFor all the latest on Harvard Fencing, follow the team on Twitter (@HarvardFencing) and Instagram (@harvardfencing).\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
