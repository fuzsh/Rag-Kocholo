        "text": "Who is competing?\n\nQuan Hongchan (China) – Remember how no woman has successfully defender her platform gold since 2012? Well 17-year-old Quan is hoping to join that list, and she’s the favorite in Paris this week. The Tokyo gold medalist won gold at the world championship earlier this year, and was second in the world in both 2022 and 2023.\n\nChen Yuxi (China) – Quan’s biggest challenge could be her own teammate. Chen, 18, won gold in the synchro platform last week, and was the gold medalists in individual platform at the 2022 and 2023 world championships. She finished second to Quan at worlds this year.\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix (Great Britain) – Another competitor who has already medaled in these Games, Spendolini-Sirieix won bronze in the synchro platform last week. The 19-year-old finished third in the individual platform at the world championships earlier this year, and finished seventh in the event during the Tokyo Games. If Spendolini-Sirieix can win a medal in individual platform it would not only add to her personal total, but it would also be historic. Great Britain has never medaled in the event.\n\nLois Toulson (Great Britain)- Toulson was Sirieix’s bronze medal winning partner in the synchro platform. This is the 24-year-old's third Olympics. She finished ninth in individual platform in Tokyo.\n\nDelaney Schnell (USA) – Schnell is the U.S.’s best chance at a medal in this event. She has one Olympic medal to her name, a silver in the synchro platform in Tokyo. Schnell and her diving partner Jess Parratto finished sixth in synchro last week. In individual platform, the 25-year-old finished fifth in Tokyo, sixth at the 2023 worlds, and third at the 2019 worlds. She has an outside chance at getting the podium this week.\n\nGabriela Agundez (Mexico) – Another driver with an outside chance this week, Agundez finished fourth at both the Tokyo Olympics and 2023 world championships.\n\nCaeli McKay (Canada) – McKay was the 2023 world championship bronze medalist.\n\nKim Mi-Rae (North Korea) – North Korea didn’t allow athlete to compete internationally for four years until this year, so Kim hasn’t had much experience in big events recently, but she did finish fourth at the world championships earlier this year. The 23-year-old last competed in the 2016 Rio Games, where she finished fourth as the youngest ever North Korean diver.\n\nDaryn Wright (USA) – At 20 years old, Wright is the youngest American diver in Paris, and is making her Olympic debut. Despite finishing second at the U.S. Olympic Trials, she didn't find out she made the Olympic team until four days later when World Aquatics awarded the U.S. a second quota spot in the Games."
