        "text": "Japan, winners of consecutive tournaments in 2012 and 2014, had repelled Iranian attacks for almost the entire first half and were set to go into the break with a credible 0-0 draw.\n\nCaptain Ali Asghar Hassanzadeh, however, broke the deadlock just one minute before the interval with a fine shot into the bottom right corner following Farhad Tavakoli’s pass.\n\nTavakoli then doubled the defending champions’ advantage just two minutes into the second-half with a simple finish from close range.\n\nHassanzadeh then made it 3-0 in the 29th minute after Ahmad Esmaeilpour displayed incredible skill to dribble through the Japanese defence before passing to Hassanzadeh to finish.\n\nHossein Tayyebi then secured the victory, and title, for Iran with a finish into an empty net just one minute from time as Japan went gung-ho in an attempt to save the game.\n\nIt Tayyebi’s 14th goal of the tournament, meaning he ends the tournament as the top goalscorer.\n\nEarlier in the day, Uzbekistan clinched the bronze medal after coming out on top against Iraq 2-1 in a penalty shootout following a 4-4 draw in normal time.\n\nThis was Uzbekistan's fourth bronze medal in their nine appearances at the tournament since 2001."
