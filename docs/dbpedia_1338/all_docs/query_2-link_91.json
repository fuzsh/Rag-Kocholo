Seven teams representing the petroleum industry were involved in the women’s section. In the light of the pandemic and the economic conditions, all of them obtained acceptable results.",

        "text": "The women’s basketball team of Palayesh Naft Abadan and the basketball team of Gaz Tehran ran for titles in the Women’s Basketball Pro League of Iranian Clubs. The women’s futsal team of Palayesh Naft Abadan and the women’s futsal team of Melli Haffari Ahvaz were present in the Iranian Clubs Women’s Futsal Pro League. The women’s handball team of Tasisat Darayei was present in the Iranian clubs’ pro league. The women’s handball team of Naft-o Gaz Gachsaran was present in the first league matches while the women’s football team of Palayesh Gaz Ilam was present in the Iranian clubs’ women’s football pro league matches.\n\nThe women’s oil teams participating in various competitions mainly hired young and local players. That is a step ahead in oil sports. Apart from the results of the women’s basketball team of Gaz Tehran, six other teams managed to achieve acceptable results.\n\nChampionship in Futsal\n\nThe women’s futsal league matches of Iranian clubs was the last women’s match held in the country and the Palayesh Naft Abadan team won the championship title for the second time. They were the only petroleum industry representatives to win the championship title in the women’s sports matches. The women’s futsal team of Melli Haffari Ahvaz was another representative of the petroleum industry to advance neck-to-neck with Palayesh Naft Abadan. It topped its own group to go for the finals, but it finished in fourth place. It is noteworthy that the Melli Haffari Avaz team, despite coming fourth, was instrumental in the championship of Palayesh Naft Abadan.\n\nBasketball\n\nIn the women’s basketball super league, the petroleum industry had two representatives: Palayesh Naft Abadan and Gaz Tehran. Thanks to its head coach, Palayesh Naft Abadan made a powerful start and finished in first place in the preparatory stage. After leaving behind the playoff phase into the semi-finals, they failed to make a strong show and they suffered two failures. Finally, they finished in fourth place. The Gaz Tehran team, which claimed to be the league champion, made a very weak appearance in the past season. It had a weak presence in the playoff, and it fell to the first league. Now it has to go through a tougher road to return to the super league next season.\n\nHandball\n\nIn handball, the petroleum industry had two representatives: One in the pro league and one in the first league: Tasisat Darayei, one of the top teams, had always been among the top four in the first league of Iranian clubs. In the last season, it finished in fourth place. The Tasisat Daryaei team finished in second place in its own group to go to the final matches, but it suffered two defeats. However, the Naft-o- Gaz Gachsaran handball team, present in the first league, did not get a title better than fourth place. It hired local and young players to return to the super league. In the group matches’ stage, it finished second and found its way into the semifinals, but it was defeated twice and it finished in fourth place.\n\nFootball\n\nThe women’s football team of Palayesh Gaz was the seventh oil team taking part in the championship matches. The women’s team of Palayesh Gaz Ilam was participating with a local and young lineup. It had to face the champion and runner-up of the previous round. Finally, it finished in third place after scoring 18 points. But the score and third place position was not enough for the semi-finals and finals.\n\nGiven the results obtained by women’s teams representing the petroleum industry in sports matches in the last season, it could be argued that they had a successful year and they were a source of honor and pride for the petroleum sector’s sport activities. These women showed that they would go ahead in parallel with men, and they even outdo them in some disciplines. In a year when only one of men’s teams became champion in the super league level due to the high number of men’s teams (Pars Jonoubi), women did an excellent job."
