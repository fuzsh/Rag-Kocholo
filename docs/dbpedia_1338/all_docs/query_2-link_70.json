        "text": "The 2023/24 AFC Champions League is proving to be biggest and most-watched events in the competition's history.\n\nStar players flocked to Asian clubs this past summer, most notably in Saudi Arabia, and thus there's already been massive attention on many fixtures throughout the competition. Cristiano Ronaldo is trying to win his first Asian continental title with Al Nassr, while Neymar is competing with Al Hilal, among many others.\n\nThis competition is the first in two decades following a traditional club schedule from August to May, with all previous competitions since 2003 scheduled across a calendar year.\n\nThis year's competition will also be the final tournament in the current format, with next year moving to a three-tiered competition structure much like UEFA, while decreasing the top competition's field in the process.\n\nMORE: How to watch AFC Champions League 2023/24: TV channel, live stream for Asia club championship\n\nAFC Champions League fixtures, results\n\nKickoff time converter\n\nWith games taking place all across Asia, kickoff times can be difficult to translate to local regions across the world.\n\nUsing this table, you can translate some of the listed kickoff times below to your own regional time zone to appropriately understand when games will start.\n\nFind your region in the first column, and then move across the row to find the column which reflects the local time zone of the match. The cell you land upon will tell you the time difference between your region and the local region of the match, allowing you to find your kickoff time using the listed kickoff time of the match.\n\nFor example, if you are searching for your local kickoff time in U.S. Eastern Time, and you wish to watch a match of Al Hilal, who play home games in the UTC +3 region, you would find the \"USA/Canada (ET)\" row and match it with the cell in the \"UTC +3\" column to display a -7 time difference. Therefore, to convert a listed local match time of 9 p.m. in Saudi Arabia, you would subtract seven to find that the match kicks off at 2 p.m. in your region.\n\nUTC +3 UTC +4 UTC +5 UTC +6 UTC +7 UTC +8 UTC +9 UTC +10 USA/Canada (PT) -10 -11 -12 -13 -14 -15 -16 -17 USA/Canada (ET) -7 -8 -9 -10 -11 -12 -13 -14 United Kingdom (BST) -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 India (IST) +2.5 +1.5 +0.5 -0.5 -1.5 -2.5 -3.5 -4.5 Hong Kong/Malaysia/Singapore +5 +4 +3 +2 +1 0 -1 -2 Australia (AEST) +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1 0 New Zealand (NZST) +9 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2\n\n2023/24 AFC Champions League Round of 16\n\nThe draw for the 2023/24 AFC Champions League knockout round took place on December 21, 2023 and set the bracket for the entirety of the tournament from this point on.\n\nFirst Leg\n\nDate Time (local) Fixture Feb 13, 2024 6 p.m. Shandong T. 2-3 Kawasaki Fr.

The groups were divided up by region, with all West Region teams drawn in groups together, and all East Region teams also kept together, done to cut down on travel somewhat across the large continent.\n\nThe group-stage draw was conducted on August 24, 2023 from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nFollowing the group stage, all 10 group winners advanced to the knockout round. Additionally, six group runners-up were sent through via the runner-up table sorted by points gained.

The rebranded competition will feature fewer clubs, with just 24 participants, but the prize money will get a 200 percent bump.\n\nAdditionally, with the top-tier competition shrinking, they will add two lower level competitions, with the AFC Champions League 2 and the AFC Challenge League being introduced much like UEFA's Europa League and the Europa Conference League.\n\nAFC Champions League past winners\n\nAl-Hilal became the competition's most successful club when they collected their fourth title in 2021. Prior to that latest title, they were level with Korean side Pohang Steelers, who have lifted the trophy three times.\n\nSouth Korea remain the most successful country in the ACL with their clubs lifting the title 12 times.\n\nAFC Champions League winners since 2012"
