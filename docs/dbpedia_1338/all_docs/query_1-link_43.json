        "text": "No, I am saying that it should be easier for an average futsal player to succeed in football, than the other way around.\n\nSomeone like Materazzi, for example, wouldn't be that good at Futsal because he is too slow and not very good with the ball, whereas the best Futsal players should be able to play rather well as forwards or wingers in Football, assuming that their stamina and fitness would be enough.\n\nI think it is more about the fact that Football allows more different player styles than Futsal.\n\nFutsal was invented as a training tool for the short quick on the ground passing game that happened to be played in gyms in uruguay. It was never supposed to be made into a game it was for training.\n\nSo if it is just used for training it can help the player become a better outside player.\n\nThe game futsal has no interest for me. But, as a training tool then i am interested something that can help the player to develope a short quick pass on the ground outside game.\n\nI don't think Iran plays a bad out door game. They just play a different game then futsal. You can easily incorporate the short quick on the ground passing game of futsal into any game a team plays. Do that the overall game will improve. You can do more things.\n\nNo he wasn't. The guy didn't even start a single match and played as a sub in no more than 5.\n\nThe coach didn't want to give him a chance, so he returned to Futsal.\n\nEven after the team was champion and still had 4 or 5 games to play at the state championship the coach didn't play him.\n\nFalc√£o was mediocre in his few chances, but we can't blame him because he didn't have much time.\n\nFutsal doesn't require a few things that are needed in football. It places less significance on size, dead speed, long ball passing, long range shooting, and heading goals to name a few.\n\nYou can definiely develop skill, dribbling and shortrange ground passsing through futsal that would be very useful in any football league but you must find a way to develop those skills I listed or it would be harder to succeed in in competitive football. Players can work with more space in football and can use a dead speed move to beat a player when they cannot do so lacking the space in futsal. Think of how many goals in major football leagues are scored on headers and off of set pieces/long range shots. These skills are valuable for winning teams (on top of ground passing etc.)\n\nSee: Italy 2006\n\nI enjoy watching futsal, however, and I agree that it can be a valuable tool for player development.\n\nthe english don't have futsal or street football which is why they suck so much as players apart from the conscious effort to ignore anything outside england and anything to do with skill, the point is that they grow up playing open games and most of the time they dont see the ball and thus they dont know how to get out of tight spaces or close people down which doens't involve hacking their legs.\n\nI want to see how the Dutch national team is in about 5 years considering the Dutch are the best in the world at street football/futsal, but that's the thing, they are so good they rather stick with it, but it's influencing the whole generation.\n\nI wonder how Edward Van Gils would do since seeing him blew me away as much as watching The Lord of the Rings movies.\n\nRepped. You make some great points, and I would add to a few of them.\n\nSize - not sure if referring to height or bulk/strength, so I'll address both. A taller player has some advantaged outdoors, where more of the game is played in the air. A player with great upper body strength and leaping ability also has an edge outdoors (this can, but doesn't necessarily correllate to height). Conversely, lower center of gravity can tend to favor the futsal player, particularly in front of goal where they can use this to both hold off a defender and turn on the ball to shoot (I always think of Gerd Muller). Unless that tall player has exceptional skill and lower body strength, futsal favors the more compact player.\n\nPace/Dead Speed - as you pointed out, favors the footballer, nothing to add.\n\nFutsal is tremendous training for developing a good first touch, close control dribbling, quick shot and decision-making, playing up front with back to goal, and good defensive foot work. As you quite correctly pointed out, these can complement and enhance a player's ability, but won't create a complete player, as futsal won't develop the long ball skills or air game."
