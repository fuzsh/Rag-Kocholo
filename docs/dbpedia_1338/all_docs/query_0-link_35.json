        "text": "The long-disputed issue of whether Muslim women’s soccer players should be allowed to wear headscarves in games will be addressed Saturday at a meeting of the sport’s international rules board.\n\nSoccer officials consider hijabs — headscarves that cover the hair, neck and ears — a safety concern, and prohibit players from wearing them during games. Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, a member of the executive committee of FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, will urge the rule-making group to consider a Velcro hijab made by the Dutch company Capsters. He has said that the ban on hijabs pushes many Muslim athletes away from soccer.\n\n“There is a right for women’s play regardless of any other issues, and we are simply trying to find the best way to facilitate that,” he said.\n\nFor the ban to be overturned, it needs six of the eight available votes on the International Football Association Board, the sport’s lawmaking body. The board is made up of representatives from each British association — England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales — and four FIFA officials.\n\nIn 2007, the rules board upheld the Quebec Soccer Federation’s decision to have a young girl remove her hijab.\n\nDuring the 2010 Youth Olympics in Singapore, the Iranian women, who are required by Iranian law to wear hijabs, were told that they could not wear hijabs but could wear caps. The caps did not cover the neck, but the Iranians were allowed to wear turtlenecks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
