        "text": "Syria played DPR Korea in the FIFA World Cup 26™ / AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Preliminary Joint Qualification on 6 June, losing 0-1 after a late goal in additional time. Although they currently sit second in Group B, they are just one point clear of third-placed DPR Korea and are in danger of being eliminated from the second round unless they win their away game against Japan on 11 June.\n\nThe first leg against Japan came after the team started the qualifier with a 1-0 win over DPR Korea. In a “home game” held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, they lost 0-5 after conceding the opener to KUBO Takefusa in the 32nd minute and a brace to UEDA Ayase. The day before the match, Argentine coach Hector CUPER had expressed his enthusiasm, saying he would do his best to prepare tactics to stop Japan, but the match ended in a complete defeat.\n\nIn January this year, they took part in their seventh AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, where they finished among the top four third-placed teams in the group stage to reach the knockout stage for the first time. They played IR Iran in the round of 16 and lost 3-5 on penalties after the score was level at 1-1 after 120 minutes of play. Nevertheless, coach Cuper was pleased with his side's performance, saying, “We showed our quality against some strong opposition.” In March of the same year, they were again involved in the second round of World Cup qualifying, and although they drew 1-1 away to Myanmar, they won the return leg 7-0 against the same opponents to retain second in the group.\n\nSyria, who are seeking to qualify for their first ever FIFA World Cup™, have come close to qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico™ and 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™. They went neck-and-neck with Iraq in the final round of the AFC qualifiers, only to fall just short in the former, and lose to Australia in the playoffs in the latter.\n\nDespite holding their own against the Asian giants, Syria's domestic instability has prevented them from playing their home games in their own country, forcing them to use alternative venues in neighbouring countries. The team's strength lies in their solid defence, which also serves as a launching pad for their fierce counter-attacks. Omar Al SOMAH, once the top scorer in the Saudi Arabian league, is the talisman who leads their attack. They will be looking to put up a tough fight in the away game against Japan and will be keen to make amends for last year's defeat.\n\nSyria National Team\n\nCoach\n\nHECTOR RAUL CUPER PISTELLI\n\nSquad\n\nGK\n\nAHMAD MADANIEH (Al-Faisaly/Jordan)\n\nELIAS HADAYA (Utsiktens BK/Sweden)\n\nESTEBAN ALEJANDRO GLELLEL (Quilmes/Argentina)\n\nMAKSIM SARRAF (FK Andijon/Uzbekistan)\n\nDF\n\nTHAER KROUMA (Mumbai City/India)\n\nMOAIAD ALKHOULI (Al-Jaish)\n\nMOUAIAD ALAJAAN (Al-Jaish)\n\nAMRO JENIAT (Al-Wahda)\n\nAMR AL MIDANI (Al-Nasr/Kuwait)\n\nMOHAMMAD ANEZ (Al-Riffa/Bahrain)\n\nEMILIANO JAVIER AMOR (Colo-Colo/Chile)\n\nKHALED KOURDOGHLI (Al-Wehdat/Jordan)\n\nAMPNTOUL RACHMAN OUES (Athens Kallithea/Greece)\n\nMF\n\nFAHAD YOUSSEF (Al-Shorta/Iraq)\n\nIBRAHIM HESAR (Foolad/IR Iran)\n\nEZEQUIEL NAIM HAM (Independiente Rivadavia/Argentina)\n\nJALIL JUAN JOSE ELIAS (Johor Darul Ta'zim/Malaysia)\n\nELMAR ABRAHAM (Skovde AIK/Sweden)\n\nAMMAR RAMADAN (DAC 1904/Slovakia)\n\nFW\n\nOMAR ALSOMA (Al-Arabi/Qatar)\n\nALAA ALDIN YASIN DALI (Naft Maysan/Iraq)\n\nMOHAMMAD ALHALLAK (Al Ahed/Lebanon)\n\nANTONIO TINO LUCAS YAKOUB (Gefle IF/Sweden)\n\nTOBIAS ARIEL CERVERA CADI (Rosario Central/Argentina)\n\nResults of last 10 matches\n\n(H: Home, A: Away, N: Neutral ground, â: Win, â³: Draw, â: Loss)\n\nâ»Home matches for the FIFA World Cup 26™ / AFC Asian Cup Saudi Arabia 2027™ Preliminary Joint Qualification were held in Saudi Arabia\n\nRecord against Japan\n\n2 draws, 10 losses (9 goals, 32 against)\n\nResults at the FIFA World Cup™\n\nAppearances: None\n\nâ»Achieved its independence from France in 1946\n\n1950ãWithdrawn during the qualifier\n\n1954ãDid not participate\n\n1958ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1962ãDid not participate\n\n1966ãDid not participate\n\n1970ãDid not participate\n\n1974ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1978ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1982ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1986ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1990ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1994ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n1998ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n2002ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n2006ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n2010ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n2014ãDisqualified during the qualifier\n\n2018ãEliminated in the qualifier\n\n2022ãEliminated in the qualifier"
