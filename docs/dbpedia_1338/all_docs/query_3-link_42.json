        "text": "The spotlight will once again be on Napa next month as Silverado Resort and Spa hosts the Procore Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour’s 2024 FedExCup Fall Season.\n\nCalifornia-based Procore Technologies, Inc., the leading global provider of construction management software, will become the title sponsor of the Napa tournament, the PGA Tour announced on July 31.\n\nThe Procore Championship, scheduled Sept. 9-15, will be played on Silverado’s North Course, a par-72, 7,123-yard championship layout.\n\nIt marks the 11th straight year of Silverado, a 36-hole complex, hosting the PGA Tour in the fall.\n\nThe announcement of the Procore Championship was also made at media day for the tournament on July 31.\n\nThe event will have a field of 144 players. The field is led by Sahith Theegala, who earned his first PGA Tour victory in the tournament last year, when it was called the Fortinet Championship, shooting a 21-under-par 267.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Procore to the PGA Tour family as title sponsor of an event that offers a unique combination of PGA Tour golf and hospitality in a setting that only the Napa Valley can offer,” said Tyler Dennis, the PGA Tour Chief Competitions Officer, in a press release. “Sahith Theegala’s first PGA Tour win in Napa last year in front of dozens of friends and family was one of the great storylines of the season, and we are excited to have the Procore Championship lead off year two of the FedExCup Fall.”\n\nGolf Channel and Peacock will provide coverage of all four rounds, the PGA Tour said. PGA Tour LIVE on ESPN+ will have featured group coverage during the first two rounds of the tournament.\n\n“It's such an exciting day for the tournament, to welcome Procore as our title sponsor and to work together,” said Andy McDowell, the executive director of the tournament. \"Procore is a company that values culture, it values community, and they value charity.\"\n\nThe total purse for the Procore Championship is to be announced by the PGA Tour. The winner will receive 500 FedExCup points.\n\nThe 2024 FedExCup Fall has eight official PGA Tour events, giving players a final chance to secure or improve their status for the 2025 FedExCup Season, according to a press release from PGA Tour Communications. The FedExCup Fall schedule includes stops in five U.S. states, along with Japan, Mexico and Bermuda.\n\nThe 2024 FedExCup Fall, according to a press release, will also finalize top-125 eligibility for the next season, providing exempt status for full-field events, as well as a spot in THE PLAYERS Championship.\n\nThere are significant benefits to winning during the FedExCup Fall, according to a press release, including a two-year PGA Tour exemption, 500 FedExCup points, entry to the season-opening The Sentry, THE PLAYERS and eligibility into major championships that have invited PGA Tour winners in the past.\n\n“On behalf of the PGA Tour, I'm thrilled to be here on such an amazing occasion,” said John Norris, Senior Vice President of Tournament Business for the PGA Tour. “We're just getting to know our friends at Procore. They're very passionate about giving back to communities and very passionate about everything they do as the global leader in construction management software. I just have a great vibe after being around a lot of years, that they're going to be a tremendous partner.”\n\nSilverado has hosted PGA Tour events going back to the 1960s.\n\nThe Kaiser International Open Invitational (1968-1976) and Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic (1977-1980) were each played at Silverado.\n\nIn recent years, Silverado has also been the host of the Frys.com Open (2014-2015), Safeway Open (2016-2020), and Fortinet Championship (2021-2023).\n\nThe Transamerica and Napa Valley Championship, both PGA Tour Champions events, were played at Silverado from 1989-2002.\n\nSilverado at one time was also the site of the PGA Tour’s national qualifying school.\n\nPrior to Procore Technologies, Inc., taking over as the title sponsor, the event was known as the Napa Valley Golf Championship during July.\n\n“I know I speak for us all when I say we are truly excited. We are honored to be part of this partnership together,” said Sarah Hodges, Chief Marketing Officer, Procore. “We're a global company. It's really important for us to be connecting communities and that's why this partnership is so important to us. We see this as an opportunity to partner locally in the Napa community, which is near and dear to us.”\n\nProcore Technologies, Inc., has its headquarters in Santa Barbara.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn a press release, Hodges said: “We are honored to partner with the PGA Tour as the title sponsor of the Procore Championship. This partnership reflects our commitment to community and innovation, two values that are deeply ingrained in both construction and golf. We look forward to kicking off the 2024 FedExCup Fall Season with the Procore Championship and supporting the Napa Valley community through this prestigious event.”\n\nAccording to a press release, Procore’s comprehensive platform has been instrumental in various PGA Tour-related projects, including the construction of PGA Tour Studios, a new multimedia content facility set for completion in January of 2025.\n\nProcore Technologies, Inc., will continue as the title sponsor of the Procore Championship in 2025, said Norris.\n\n“They and we didn't want to just say, hey, we're here for (2024), we'll see you later. So, making that commitment that we're here, not just now but in the future,” said Norris. “We're all hoping that it's much longer than that. We're here for all the right reasons, was made by doing it for several years.”\n\nNorris was asked about Fortinet, the title sponsor of the Napa tournament the last three years.\n\nNorris said: “They had a great three-year run. Times change. If you look back at the history, we have sponsors that come and go for various reasons, whether it's business priorities, executive leadership. So, we thank them for their time here and their continued support of other areas of the Tour.”\n\nThe emcee for media day was Frank LaRosa, a board member with the California Golf Writers & Broadcasters Association and the Northern California PGA Foundation, and the host of a radio show, “Golf To Go,” on KHTK Sports 1140 AM in Sacramento.\n\nLa Rosa was joined at media day by Norris, McDowell and, via videoconference, Hodges and Theegala.\n\nTheegala was stellar last year, firing rounds of 68, 64, 67 and 68 at Silverado.\n\nHe has continued to play very well during the 2024 season, recording seven top-10 and 10 top-25 finishes in 21 events played.\n\n“It just meant the world to me, to have all my family and friends there,” said Theegala, looking back on his win here last year. “I just got hot on Friday and also on Saturday, and the next thing I knew I was in the zone. It's given me so much confidence since then.”\n\nTheegala is seventh in the 2024 FedExCup Standings and 11th in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nHe has a familiarity with Silverado. Playing here on an unrestricted sponsor invitation during the 2020 Safeway Open, a PGA Tour event, he tied for 14th place.\n\n“I think just the combination of the firmness and the greens and just able to recover is a big part of why I love Silverado,” Theegala said. “I just love firm conditions and the greens get so pure.\n\n“I just love the golf course. It allows you to hit recovery shots. You can hit it in the trees. Sometimes, you get stymied by trees, but other times you have chances to hit recovery shots. And that's one of the better parts of my game, is just finding a way to recover from trouble.”\n\nAccording to a press release, proceeds from the Procore Championship will benefit nonprofit organizations through The Impact Through Golf Foundation Napa Valley, which provides funding to charitable organizations throughout the country, with an emphasis on the greater Napa Valley area.\n\nCharities that have recently benefited from the Procore Championship, according to a press release, include Ole Health Foundation, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Napa Valley, the Cameron Champ Foundation, First Tee-North Coast, Queen of the Valley Foundation, Jameson Humane Rescue Ranch, Napa Valley Community Foundation, Youth on Course and Travis Air Force Base Reserves.\n\n“We're really excited about the charitable donations that are going to be part of the upcoming event and the support of local charities in Napa that align with our vision and with our ways of working,” said Hodges.\n\nGeneral admission and hospitality tickets for the Procore Championship are on sale.\n\nThis year’s event includes The 1955 Club, a new shared hospitality venue near the 18th green that includes a fully shaded winery-themed tent along with hosted lunch, outdoor theatre-style seating and other amenities, a press release said.\n\nPractice rounds for the Procore Championship on Sept. 9 and 10 are closed to the public.\n\nThe official Pro-Am, presented by ONEFlight, is on Sept. 11.
