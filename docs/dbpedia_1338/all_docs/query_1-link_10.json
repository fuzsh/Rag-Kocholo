        "text": "The 12-time champions Iran faced Thailand in the final of the 2024 AFC Futsal Asian Cup in Bangkok on Sunday. The match ended 4-1 for the Iranian team.\n\nLed by the legend former Iranian player Vahid Shamsaei as the coach, the Iranian team commandingly won all their matches to get to the final.\n\nUzbekistan came in the third place following Thailand. The debutants Afghanistan led by an Iranian coach qualified for the next Asian Cup by defeating Kyrgyzstan in the playoff earlier on Sunday. Another astonishing event in the Thai tournament was the elimination of defending champions Japan in the early stages.\n\nAccording to the AFC website, Iran seized control from the start at the Bangkok Arena to deny Thailand a maiden title as the Central Asian side made up for losing to Japan in the 2022 edition.\n\nIran got off to a fine start, taking the lead in the first minute off a set-piece situation when Salar Aghapour teed-up Mahdi Karimi, who finished into the bottom corner of the net from the top of the arc.\n\nThailand, despite being urged on by the partisan crowd, struggled to break through, with Krit Aransanyalak finding his advances on the right flank consistently halted by Iran’s solid defending.\n\nThailand keeper Arut Senbat was kept on his toes, having to block Karimi’s forced drive from the left flank, before seeing Alireza Rafiei Pour pull his effort wide from inside the box.\n\nThe hosts had their first look on goal in the fourth minute when Alongkorn Janphon lost his marker at the centre before playing the ball square to the advancing Therdsak Charoenphong, who fired his effort over the bar.\n\nA lapse in concentration saw Thailand concede again in the fifth minute when Mohammadreza Sangsefidi played the ball on for the overlapping Moslem Oladghobad on the right flank, who supplied a pinpoint cross for Saeid Ahmad Abbasi to score his eighth goal of the tournament.\n\nThailand refused to concede defeat, with Suphawut Thueanklang seeing his set-piece effort saved by Iran keeper Bagher Mohammadi, who then did well to force Panut Kittipanuwong’s shot wide in a one on one situation.\n\nThe onus was on Thailand to find their way back and they did so in spectacular fashion in the 25th minute when Jirawat Sornwichian exchanged passes with Muhammad Osamanmusa before darting through centre and chipping the ball over Mohammadi.\n\nA relentless Iran responded two minutes later off a set-piece situation when Sangsefidi lofted the perfect cross to an unmarked Ali Asghar Hassanzadeh to volley home to regain their two-goal advantage.\n\nThailand, desperate to reduce the deficit in the second half, opted for the power play, but the move proved costly in the 34th minute as Mohammadi gained possession in his area before lofting the ball over to score Iran’s fourth to confirm his nation's 13th AFC Futsal Asian Cup title.\n\nKI"
