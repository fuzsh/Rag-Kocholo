        "text": "Pitman competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London in weightlifting\n\n8/7/2024 9:57:00 AM\n\nTwo SU alums and a former student competed in past Olympics â€” Joe Pitman '50, Steve Spence '85, SU's head cross country and assistant track and field coach, and Chris Flook. Pitman competed in men's lightweight weightlifting at the 1948 summer Olympics in London. Spence and Flook both competed in the 1992 summer Olympics. Spence ran in the marathon for the USA while Flook competed for Bermuda in the men's 100 and 200 meter breaststroke.\n\nJoe Pitman '50 was a champion weightlifter who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, representing the United States of America.\n\nMr. Pitman passed away in 2018 at the age of 94. In 2022, he was inducted into the Pennsylvania Strength & Power Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1992, Pitman was interviewed by Shippensburg University Athletics Hall of Fame inductee John Alosi, our sports information director from 1972-2004, for an article in the university's Vista Summer '92 publication. It is posted below in its entirety.\n\nWill of Iron\n\nSU's only Olympian cheers on prospective medalists\n\nby John Alosi\n\nJoe Pitman still knows how to throw his weight around, but now the university's only Olympian does it for fun and not competition.\n\nPitman, a 1950 graduate, is the only Shippensburg University student or graduate to compete in the Olympic Games. That honor came when he competed in weightlifting in the 1948 Olympics in London.\n\nHe finished seventh in the Games but went on to be a world champion and continued a streak of United States championships. His athletic prowess led him to membership in both the U.S. Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame and the South Central Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPitman enrolled at Shippensburg in the fall of 1946 after serving in the Navy during World War II. In summer 1947, he won the first of 10 national championships in the 67.5 kilogram weight class (148 pounds). In 1948 he won the national championship again and then traveled to London for the Olympics.\n\nPitman remembers the Olympics fondly. \"It was my first international competition and I was traveling with some pretty fast company. We had qualifying meets in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Then the final tryouts were in New York. I won the meet in Baltimore and the meet in New York.\n\n\"We traveled to England by ship and landed in Southampton. It was tough to train on the ship going over because sometimes the ship would lurch and a couple guys on the team hurt their backs.\n\n\"I believe I could have done better at the Olympics but I had stained my quadriceps muscle in my right leg and I didn't have enough time to heal. I think if the Olympic trails were held earlier in the year I would have had more time to train for the Olympics.\n\nWhile there, he didn't get to see as much of the Games as he would have liked. \"Today, with the television coverage, you get to see more of the Olympics from your living room. When I was in London I got to see all the lifting and some of the wrestling and boxing. I also went to Wembley Stadium for some of the track and field. With all the time spent on buses and waiting in lines you didn't get a chance to see many events.\n\n\"During the Olympics, a lot of the other athletes would watch us train. I think that was the beginning of applying weight lifting to the other sports. Before that, coaches would discourage working with weights. They said you would get muscle bound.\"\n\nHe continued his athletic achievements in 1949 when he again won the national title and then went to The Hague, Netherlands, for the World Championships. He won the silver medal at that competition.\n\nThat was followed in 1950 by the national championship and the gold medal at the World Championships in Paris. In 1951 he won the national championship, the gold medal at the Pan-American Games, and the silver medal at the World Championships.\n\nPitman tried to make the Olympic team in 1952 by he was beat out by Tommy Kono, who would eventually win two Olympic gold medals and six world championships. Kono is considered by many to be one of the greatest weightlifters who ever lived. \"Tommy Kono and I are still good friends,\" Pitman said. \"He was from Sacramento and he and his family were held in an internment camp during World War II. That is where he learned about weightlifting and picked up the sport.\"\n\nFollowing that season Pitman won national titles from 1953 to 1957, In 1955 he won gold at the Pan-American Games and went on a State Department tour of the Soviet Union, Egypt, and Iran. \"Our heavyweight, Paul Anderson, was a sensation on that tour. He broke all the world records and brough quite a bit of attention to the sport of weightlifting.\"\n\nPitman taught social studies in Mercersburg after he graduated. After he married he moved to Vero Beach, Fla., and taught until retirement in 1980. He is currently employed in a lawn service business.\n\nHe tries to follow athletic progress at Shippensburg and is following the career of fellow alumnus Steve Spence. \"I subscribe to Runner's World magazine and I am following Steve Spence's career. I don't think it is right to hold the trials only four months before the Olympics. There is going to be a lot of tough competition at the trials.\n\n\"I think it is wonderful that Steve has a sponsor that takes care of his training expenses. That is a big difference with the Olympics compared to when I was competing. We did it on the side. Nowadays they are not so strict on amateurism anymore. If that is the only way to compete with the rest of the world that is what you have to do. I was a college student and competed for York Barbell. They would send us to various meets.\"\n\nPitman is proud of his Olympic experience, and is hoping Spence and [swimmer Chris] Flook will be able to share the athletic celebration known as the Olympic Games."
