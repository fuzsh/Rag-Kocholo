        "text": "JEDDAH: A furious row erupted on Monday after an Iranian football club tried to use a match against Saudi opponents for political propaganda.\n\nThe AFC Champions League match at the Naghsh-e-Jahan Stadium in Isfahan between Sepahan and Jeddah team Al-Ittihad was called off when the Iranian club refused to remove political banners and busts of the late Revolutionary Guard warlord Qassem Soleimani from the edge of the pitch.\n\nAl-Itiihad staff and some players noted the busts and banners at an initial pitch inspection, and reported the issue to the referee and observers from the Asian Football Confederation. AFC rules explicitly outlaw the use of a football match to promote a political message. Confederation officials asked Sepahan staff to remove the offending propaganda, but they refused.\n\nAfter requesting a delay of half an hour to assess the situation, the Saudi team and staff left the stadium to head to the airport and back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe confederation said Monday’s second round group stage match had been “canceled due to unanticipated and unforeseen circumstances. The AFC reiterates its commitment toward ensuring the safety and security of the players, match officials, spectators, and all stakeholders involved. This matter will now be referred to the relevant committees.”\n\nThe Saudi Football Federation said in an Arabic statement on Tuesday that it confirms “its full support for Al-Ittihad Club and will be taking all legal measures to preserve the rights” of the Saudi Pro League champions.\n\nThe Jeddah club said, “Al-Ittihad Club will follow up on the circumstances of the decision and calls on the AFC to protect the club’s rights guaranteed by the rules and regulations,” in an Arabic post on X.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran signed a Chinese-brokered agreement in March to resume diplomatic relations after seven years of tension. Home-and-away football matches between Saudi and Iranian teams resumed only in September, after being played at neutral venues since 2016.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Women’s Premier League champions Al-Nassr earned a historic victory here on their debut in the AFC Women’s Champions League on Sunday, overcoming Myanmar’s Myawady Women FC 3-0.\n\nThe Riyadh club became the first Saudi Arabia side to represent the Kingdom and win in Asia’s premier continental women’s club competition.\n\nThe two-time league champions maintained control throughout the match. There was a brace from 19-year-old striker Clara Luvanga, and a goal from forward Mubarkh Al-Saiari, who became the first Saudi Arabia player to score in the AFC Women’s Champions League.\n\nWith both teams making their debut in the competition, it was a nervy opening 20 minutes. Al-Nassr broke the deadlock through the youthful Luvanga in attack. The Tanzanian forward got the final touch to put the Riyadh club ahead on the night, before doubling her side’s advantage with a fine finish in a frantic first half.\n\nAfter a slow start to the second half, a moment of brilliance from new signing Ruth Kipoyi saw the Congolese winger break free and tee up teammate Al-Saiari inside the box. The Saudi forward slotted home to seal the home side’s first victory and top Group A in the preliminary stage.\n\nHead Coach Sandro Mendes elected to give the captain’s armband to former Real Madrid Femenino defender Kathellen Sousa on her debut, and the Brazilian international ushered the backline to a commanding clean sheet in the club’s first match of the new season.\n\nSousa said: “It’s a good start for us, it wasn’t a perfect game but it was a good win. We were a bit antsy at the start to be in this moment but we grew into the game and managed to get the two goals in the first half. We know what we have to work on to progress in this group.\n\n“We’re still a new team, but from my first sessions it’s clear there’s talent here in the country. Players like myself, Clara (Luvanga) and Ruth (Kipoyi) are here to help them continue to grow the game.\n\n“For me, every player wants to achieve history with big clubs. I came here to help this big club (to achieve history) and to grow myself, so we’re happy with the win.”\n\nOn becoming the first Saudi Arabia woman to score in the AFC Women’s Champions League, Al-Saiari said: “I’m delighted and really grateful. I went straight to Ruth Kipoyi right after scoring and just thanked her for helping me achieve that milestone and to make history.\n\n“It means a lot to us to be here and I have to thank the Saudi Arabian Football Federation and Al-Nassr for the chance to compete on this stage. We’ve worked so hard to grow women’s football here and impossible is nothing in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nRIYADH: The stage is set for the first AFC Women’s Champions League matches to take place in Saudi Arabia, with Women’s Premier League champions Al-Nassr preparing to become the first women’s side from the Kingdom to take part in the competition.\n\nThe Riyadh club will make their debut in Group A of the competition’s preliminary stage on Sunday night at Al-Awwal Park against Myawady Women FC, the domestic champions of Myanmar.\n\nThe two-time Saudi Arabian league champions will then face Young Elephants of Laos and champions of the UAE’s domestic women’s league, Abu Dhabi Country Club, to round out the group.\n\nAl-Nassr head coach Sandro Mendes believes his side have what it takes to compete in Asia’s premier women’s club competition.\n\n“We know the teams we are facing, we’ve done our homework. We’ll take it game by game, but we are Al-Nassr and we’re ready to compete,” he said.\n\nWith the official start to the Saudi Arabian Women’s Premier League in September, Mendes’ side have prepared for the challenge of qualifying for the next stage of the top women’s club competition in Asian football.\n\n“It’s our first official game of the season, but I believe we are ready. We’ve had a good preseason in Spain and added some strong international players with experience to the squad, so we hope to progress to the next stage.”\n\nNew signings to the Riyadh team include Brazilian defender Kathellen Sousa, who arrived during the summer window from Spanish side Real Madrid Femenino.\n\nSousa said: “From my few weeks of training with the team so far, it’s clear that Al-Nassr doesn’t just come to compete and take part. We’re ready to give our all in every match and obviously go for the win.”\n\nThe Brazilian international, who competed in last season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League with her former club, is looking forward to the chance to make an impact on her debut in the club’s first appearance in Asia’s top women’s club competition.\n\n“For me, every player wants to make history for the club. Every competition is different but at a big club, you always want to win and make history. So, hopefully, we can take the first step in this competition,” she said.\n\nOrganized by the Asian Football Confederation, the AFC Women’s Champions League is expected to usher in a new era of success and progress for women’s football in the years ahead, serving as the new premier continental competition for professional women’s clubs across the region. For the upcoming 2024-25 season, the inaugural edition will welcome the 21 domestic champions from AFC member associations.\n\nRIYADH: Al-Nassr began their 2024-25 Saudi Pro League campaign with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Al-Raed at Al-Awwal Park in Riyadh on Thursday.\n\nLast season’s runners-up took the lead in the 34th minute when Cristiano Ronaldo headed home a Sadio Mane cross from the left. The Portuguese star celebrated his goal with a traditional Saudi dance.\n\nAl-Raed were back on level terms four minutes into the second half thanks to a Mohammed Fouzair penalty. Al-Nassr were relieved to see the man who gave away the foul that caused it, Aymeric Laporte, escape with a booking following a red card check by the video assistant referee but, despite that let-off, the home team could not find the winner their fans might have expected.\n\nElsewhere, in what turned out to be the match of the day, Al-Wehda and Al-Riyadh played out a dramatic 3-3 draw at King Abdulaziz Sport City Stadium in Makkah.\n\nAustralian international Craig Goodwin gave the home team the lead five minutes before the break but the side from the capital hit back six minutes into the second half courtesy of Ghanaian midfielder Bernard Mensah.\n\nGoodwin restored Al-Wehda’s lead just after the hour mark, minutes after Al-Riyadh were reduced to 10 men when Hussien Al-Nowiqi was sent off. However, the visitors rallied and Ibrahim Bayesh equalized with five minutes of normal time left.\n\nThe 12 minutes of time added by the referee meant there was still the chance of some late twists and turns, and that is exactly what happened. Murad Khadhari looked to have won it for Al-Wehda in the 94th minute, only for Al-Riyadh to again pull level three minutes later when Lucas Kal scored their third equalizer of the night to secure a share of the points.\n\nIn the first match of the day, last season’s surprise package, Al-Taawoun, launched their campaign with a last-gasp victory over Al-Fayha at King Abdullah Sport City Stadium.\n\nDespite being reduced to 10 men after Abraham Alshuyl was sent off in the 81st minute, Al-Taawoun were not content to hold on for a point from a goalless draw, and they were rewarded for their fighting spirit five minutes into stoppage time when substitute Adam Mohammed grabbed the winner with a firm header.\n\nRIYADH: Al-Hilal star Neymar Jr. has hailed the Esports World Cup as “a great opportunity” for Saudi Arabia after he captained ‘Team Neymar Jr’ in a special cross-competition event at Boulevard Riyadh City.\n\nThe Brazilian, a lifelong gaming fan who joined the Saudi Pro League champions in 2023, said the summer-long event had highlighted the Kingdom’s culture and hospitality to the international community.\n\n“This is a great opportunity for the country, especially in terms of the visibility it has generated,” Neymar said. “It allows people to see what Saudi Arabia is really like. I’ve learned a lot of positive things since coming here. It’s a fantastic country, with positive and happy people, and I hope this event this the first of many in the years ahead because it has opened new doors for the world to experience Saudi Arabia.”\n\nTuesday saw Brazil’s all-time top scorer lead ‘Team Neymar Jr’ against a side captained by Mossad Al-Dossary, chairman of Saudi Arabia’s EWC Club Championship winners, Team Falcons. The match — which saw the two teams face off in Counter-Strike 2, Rocket League, and TEKKEN 8 — ended with a 2-1 win for Neymar’s side.\n\nThe player had special praise for the capacity crowd inside the SEF Arena.\n\n“The SEF Arena is incredible, I love it,” he said. “I’ve played here a bit, and it’s surreal to see what they’ve accomplished in just a few months by building it. I love the vibe, everyone I’ve met is so nice and the atmosphere is fantastic. This shows that Saudi Arabia is doing something truly amazing in the gaming and esports world. The Kingdom has become a pioneer for the industry while opening up opportunities across for the region and whole world to be a part of.”\n\nAs part-owner of Brazilian organization FURIA Esports, Neymar said he was excited about the industry’s future.\n\n“Esports undoubtedly has a promising future — it’s incredibly exciting for everyone involved and we’re now seeing young people with an opportunity to turn their passion into a career. I’m optimistic about the industry’s growth and the potential it holds for the next generation.”\n\nThe star also spoke of the vibrant gaming culture he has experienced throughout his professional career, labeling it as “a significant part” of his life.\n\n“Gaming culture is deeply embedded in the teams I’ve played with. We often play together online, whether in hotels or while traveling,” he said. “Esports is a big part of the world of football, as it’s a great way for us to relax and relieve stress.\n\n“On a personal level, my interest in esports originates from the time I have outside of football. I find it incredibly relaxing; it helps me destress, connect with friends, and offers a different perspective on life. Some of my best memories are tied to playing games like “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” so esports has become a significant part of my life.”\n\nThe eighth and final week of the EWC begins on Wednesday at Boulevard Riyadh City, with TEKKEN 8 and PUBG Battlegrounds action. ESL and Rocket League begin on Thursday. The PUBG Battlegrounds final is on Saturday, with the other three tournaments’ grand finals taking place on Sunday.\n\nRIYADH: Al-Hilal will pose a difficult test in Saturday’s Saudi Super Cup final in Abha, Al-Nassr’s head coach said on Friday.\n\nLuis Castro said he was expecting a tough match for his team during a pre-match press conference.\n\n“Both teams have exceptional players, and I hope the match will honor Saudi football,” the Portuguese coach said.\n\nHe also expressed hope that the referee would be able to control what promises to be a heated match between two bitter rivals.\n\nHe added: “It is known about me as a coach that I don’t talk much about refereeing. What matters to me is that my team plays well and wins.\n\n“Football is always full of passion, and when you look at 22 players on the field you see they have a passion for winning because they want to win.\n\n“But I hope the referee understands the difficulty of the match by calming the game down in tough moments.”\n\nCastro praised the quality of Al-Hilal, saying he always enjoyed battling against the Riyadh giants.\n\nHe said: “We played two finals against them, winning the Arab Championship in the first and losing the second in a penalty shootout. I always see Al-Hilal as a strong competitor, and big teams like Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal always make their presence felt in finals, and that’s what will happen.”\n\nHis opposite number and countryman Jorge Jesus refused to link the issue of not including Saud Abdulhamid in his starting lineup for the final with talk of his possible departure to Serie A side AS Roma.\n\nJesus said during his media briefing on Friday that he picked Hamad Al-Yami instead, due to his qualities better suiting the team for the final.\n\nRegarding the possibility of Malcom participating in the match after joining his team’s camp on Friday, Jesus added: “Malcom is in the process of returning. He will enter training and if he is ready, he will participate in the final. We hope for his participation because he offers many solutions and always helps the team.”\n\nJesus, who won the trophy last season, is delighted at reaching the final again and expects the match to live up to expectations.\n\nHe said: “Our opponent is strong, and the match reflects the development of Saudi football given the presence of exceptional players in both teams.\n\n“The final will be exciting, and we and Al-Nassr will present a respectable image to the world, especially since the match will be broadcast in several countries, and as two clubs we must show the best image of Saudi Arabia.”"
