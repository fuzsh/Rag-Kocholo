        "text": "A milestone in Phippine football was made on May 15, 2024, as FIFA has appointed the Philippines as the official host the inaugural 2025 FIFA Futsal Women’s World Cup™️.\n\nThe world’s governing body for football, futsal and beach soccer made the announcement today at the FIFA Council in Bangkok.\n\n“We are both humbled and honored by the faith and confidence that FIFA has placed in the Philippine Football Federation to stage a historic event not just for football and futsal, but for women’s sport,” declared Philippine Football Federation (PFF) President John Anthony Gutierrez.\n\nThe PFF has invested in all forms of women’s football, including futsal, and has yielded results with the Philippine National Women’s Football Team, the “Filipinas”, qualifying for the country’s first ever FIFA World Cup berth at the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023™️. Since 2022, the PFF has worked on the development of all forms of the women’s game, and organized and hosted a series of local international women’s futsal tournaments to build on the popularity of the modality of futsal among girls in local public schools and communities.\n\nPFF President John Gutierrez added, “This is the first time that the Philippines will be hosting a FIFA World Cup event, so on behalf of the PFF, I thank the FIFA Council for their trust, and look forward to working with all our local stakeholders in organizing a historic event. The PFF is excited to showcase to the world our world-class Filipino hospitality, and we are eager to use this event to inspire millions of children, especially girls, across the country to play the beautiful game.”"
