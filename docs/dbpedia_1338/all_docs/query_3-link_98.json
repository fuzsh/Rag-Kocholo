        "text": "The Champions League has undergone a drastic revamp ahead of the 2024/25 season which sees the number of matches in the new format increase from 125 to 189.\n\nThe league phase will now be completed at the end of January instead of during December, while there will be weeks exclusively dedicated to the Champions League in the football calendar when no other European competitions are played.\n\nThe winners will have played 17 games across the competition, while matches played across Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in Europe's premier club competition will become the new normal.\n\nAt least 10 of next season's 36 clubs participating in the new league phase will come from Italy and Germany. Sky Sports provides you with a comprehensive guide to how the new format will work...\n\nChampions League final 2024: All you need to know\n\nGet Sky Sports | Stream Sky Sports with NOW\n\nWhen is the draw for the league phase?\n\nThe draw for the league phase will be held on August 29.\n\nHow does the new Champions League format work?\n\nTaking the total number of teams from 32 to 36 in the Champions League, the biggest change will see a transformation from the traditional group stage to a single league phase including all participating teams.\n\nEvery club will now be guaranteed a minimum of eight league-stage games against eight different opponents (four home games, four away) rather than the previous six matches against three teams, played on a home-and-away basis.\n\nThe top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout stages, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off to secure a place in the last 16 of the competition.\n\nTeams ranked 25-36 are eliminated from all competitions.\n\nOK, but how does the draw work in practice?\n\nFirst of all, why the change? Well, if the old draw concept for the group stage were to be applied to the new league phase format, nearly 1,000 balls would be required with at least 36 bowls on stage.\n\nEven those who love a draw will realise that would be unbearably long. So UEFA is going to use a supercomputer to generate most of the work.\n\nFirst, all 36 teams will be manually drawn with a physical ball on stage.\n\nThen, for every team manually drawn, a designated automated software will randomly draw eight opponents across the four pots - to be shown on screen and on stage at the Grimaldi Forum in Monte Carlo for all to see.\n\nThe software will then decide which fixtures are home and away.\n\nThe draw will start with Pot 1 (containing the strongest teams and current holders of the Champions League) and work down through the four pots.\n\nThen what?\n\nThe 36 clubs will be seeded into four different pots based on their individual club coefficient at the start of the season.\n\nEach team will be drawn against two different teams from each pot, playing one team at home and one away.\n\nTeams will play eight matches against eight different teams.\n\nWhen will fans know the fixture dates?\n\nThe finalised fixture list will be released on Saturday August 31.\n\nHow many teams can you face from any one nation?\n\nIn the league phase, teams cannot face opponents from their own country and can face a maximum of two sides from the same country.\n\nWhich teams have qualified for the league phase?\n\nShakhtar Donetsk and Benfica have qualified by virtue of the Champions League and Europa League winners having already qualified via their domestic league performance or as a result of their country's collective performance in Europe this season.\n\nWe are still in the midst of the qualifying rounds, but here are the teams guaranteed to enter the league phase:\n\nUEFA Europa League winners: Atalanta\n\nEngland: Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa\n\nSpain: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Girona, Atletico Madrid\n\nGermany: Leverkusen, Stuttgart, Bayern, Leipzig, Dortmund\n\nItaly: Inter Milan, AC Milan, Bologna, Juventus\n\nFrance: Paris Saint-Germain, Monaco, Brest\n\nNetherlands: PSV Eindhoven, Feyenoord\n\nPortugal: Sporting CP\n\nBelgium: Club Brugge\n\nScotland: Celtic\n\nAustria: Sturm Graz\n\nChampions League winner rebalancing: Shakhtar Donetsk\n\nEuropa League winner rebalancing: Benfica\n\nBased on UEFA coefficients, what do the projected pots look like?\n\nPot One - Man City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, PSG, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Barcelona\n\nPot Two - Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid, Atlanta, Juventus, Benfica, Arsenal, Club Brugge, Shakhtar Donetsk, AC Milan\n\nPot Three - Feyenoord, Sporting CP, PSV, Lille*, PAOK*, Young Boys*, Celtic, Galatasaray*, Union SG*\n\nPot Four - Midtylland*, AS Monaco, Sparta Prague*, Aston Villa, Bologna, Girona, Stuttgart, Sturm Graz, Stade Brestois\n\n* Clubs yet to advance through qualifying rounds - clubs with highest UEFA coefficients included here\n\nWhat about the qualifying rounds?\n\nSeven teams will enter via winning a two-legged play-off.\n\nRangers are entering the third qualifying round, and have been drawn to face Dynamo Kyiv. The first leg is on Tuesday August 6 with the return a week later on August 13.\n\nPhilippe Clement's side are one of the seeded clubs along with Slavia Prague, Red Bull Salzburg and Lille. Should Rangers prevail, they will have their sights set on the play-off round.\n\nThe first legs of those take place on August 20-21 with the return legs on August 27-28.\n\nWhich nations gained the extra places?\n\nTwo leagues - Italy and Germany - have been rewarded with an extra place in next season's Champions League based on performance in Europe this season.\n\nThis was based around the best average coefficient of all teams participating in Europe for each country. The two leagues with the best score received an extra place.\n\nAtalanta have secured at least a fourth-placed finish in the Italian top flight following a 3-0 victory over Torino last weekend.\n\nThe result also ruled out the possibility of a sixth Serie A spot qualifying for the Champions League next season.\n\nWhen are the 2024/25 Champions League league-stage matches?\n\nMatchday 1: September 17-19, 2024\n\nMatchday 2: October 1/2, 2024\n\nMatchday 3: October 22/23, 2024\n\nMatchday 4: November 5/6, 2024\n\nMatchday 5: November 26/27, 2024\n\nMatchday 6: December 10/11, 2024\n\nMatchday 7: January 21/22, 2025\n\nMatchday 8: January 29, 2025\n\nWhen are the 2024/25 Champions League knockout stages?\n\nKnockout round play-offs: February 11/12 and February 18/19, 2025\n\nRound of 16: March 4/5 and March 11/12, 2025\n\nQuarter-finals: April 8/9 and April 15/16, 2025\n\nSemi-finals: April 29/30 and May 6/7, 2025\n\nFinal: May 31, 2025\n\nWhere is the Champions League final being held in 2025?\n\nThe 2024/25 UEFA Champions League season will take place in Munich at the Allianz Arena on May 31, 2025.\n\nEuropa League and Europa Conference League changing too?\n\nSimilar changes will be made to the Europa League and Europa Conference League formats, with 36 teams in each.\n\nTeams in the Europa League will have eight matches against eight different opponents in the league phase.\n\nIn the Europa Conference League - renamed the UEFA Conference League - teams will have six matches against six different opponents in the league phase. The UEFA Conference League games will be played between September and December.\n\nThe knockout phases of the competitions will take place through the second half of the season and culminate at the end of the campaign, as they do now."
