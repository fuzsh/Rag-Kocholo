        "text": "Top 10 Reasons Not to Take Eminem Literally\n\n1. Booka Shade: \"Mandarine Girl\"\n\nCatchy, catchy, catchy: The main riff in \"Mandarine Girl\" is fool proof. German duo Booka Shade was snagged for a lot of mixes this year, and if you could only hear one 2005 \"electro-house\" track, you could do worse.\n\n2. Gui Boratto: \"Arquipelago\"\n\nKompakt \"retention pond\" K2 quietly had a very nice year, including issuing this low-key 12\" by Brazilian producer Boratto. The chord sequence and Fender Rhodes piano are straight out of a Radiohead song (or a lost Miles Davis session), and the vibe is pure mystery.\n\n3. Anders Ilar: \"Rourei\"\n\nSpooky, drugged-out electro-house track tucked away on Ilar's Nightwidth EP. I used this on more mixes this year than any other song.\n\n4. Duoteque: \"Drug Queen\"\n\nBASS! Duoteque blow out speakers for fun with deceptively deep low-end, and crib Justus Kohncke's beats as a matter of good business sense.\n\n5. John Tejada: \"Paranoia\"\n\nAll-star DJ Tejada had a banner year in 2005. His \"Paranoia\" was another mix fave, and features vox by ultimate cold techno diva, Qzen.\n\n6. Digitalism: \"Zdarlight\"\n\nBraxe is beautiful? Digitalism is just dandy. Okay, that sucked, but this song is great.\n\n7. Jesse Somfay: \"For One Brief Moment I Was There\"\n\nTechno for the depresso-crowd. Atmospheric, hazy, and ultra-gray, teenage wunderkind Somfay broke out big this year.\n\n8. Solieb: \"Circus Maximus\"\n\nOceanic techno with a gradual buildup worthy of kings. The catalog should say: subtle yet overpowering, this track is sure to please.\n\n9. Trentemøller: \"Serenetti\"\n\nOld Anders drops this at the end of the year thinking no one would notice. K-house is getting better all the time.\n\n10. Dub Kult: \"On and On (Guido Schneider mix)\"\n\nDitto. Sharp, kaleidoscopic, and vaguely untouchable, this is what's playing at the Gap in DJ Heaven. --Dominique Leone\n\n///\n\n2005's Best Country Tracks\n\nDisregarded in some circles for its musical conservatism and its red-state stigma, Nashville country had a great year in 2005, producing some of the year's most memorable singles and ballsiest ballads. Here are five of my favorite country songs from the past twelve months.\n\n1. Gretchen Wilson: \"Skoal Ring\"\n\nA great song from an aggressively disappointing album, \"Skoal Ring\" imagines what kind of man a real redneck woman wants, and Wilson has the guts to get physical as she admits, \"That berry blend on his lips still turns me on.\" It could have been a big joke, especially with the chorus's bling-bling, but Wilson's performance communicates pure desire.\n\n2. Lee Ann Womack: \"I May Hate Myself in the Morning\"\n\nWomack does the impossible and makes midlife maturity sound sexy and lively on this ode to giving in to temptation despite the inevitable guilt and sadness. With its plucked guitar melody and elegant violin, the song's a throwback to country music's 1970s heyday, but without the formal nostalgia that makes people like Robbie Fulks so damn annoying.\n\n3. Miranda Lambert: \"Kerosene\"\n\nLooking at the cover of her debut album, I dismissed Miranda Lambert as sorority-girl country, but she proves me wrong on this spit-in-your-eye single, which rewrites Steve Earle's \"I Feel Alright\" and works a chorus Rhett Miller was going to get around to writing someday: \"I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me.\"\n\n4. Bobby Pinson: \"Nothin' Happens in This Town\"\n\nAbout a town so small it doesn't even have a Super Wal-Mart. So much nothing happens that Pinson has to repeat the chorus with the same characters. Still, it's country songwriting with the wit and detail of Robert Earl Keen, which is a true compliment.\n\n5. Natalie Maines, Bruce Robison, and Kelly Willis: \"Traveling Soldier\" (live)\n\nTechnically not a 2005 track, but this performance comes from Willie Nelson's Songs for Tsunami Relief: Austin to South Asia (which, incidentally, includes live tracks from Spoon) and sounds more heartfelt and immediate that the Dixie Chicks' original. The three voices invest that chorus with a real-life gravity that really sells the tragedy and intimates an antiwar message rather than stating it outright. --Stephen M. Deusner\n\n///\n\nVia Chicago\n\nFinally this year, I could appropriately soundtrack practically all of my commute, riding the faster hammers of the Garfield El, taking my bus route across Common's corners, feeling the Illinois echo of the 1893 World's Fair site a few blocks from my laboratory. So you can forgive me for the hometown hubris of presuming Chicago to be the center of the music universe in 2005. The city wasn't spraying bands across the map like a lawn sprinkler, but Chicago and its flatland surroundings made an impact by being the #1 geographic subject matter of the year, its industrial past and humble present stealing the narrative spotlight from its coastal rivals for a spell.\n\nSufjan Stevens took the large-canvas approach with Illinois, and spent most of his time dwelling upon the lonely, dark downstate prairies, as he is wont to do. But Stevens saved his most grandiose arrangements for dioramas of the Second City, ornamenting its past and its poets with romantic strings and choral chants. Yet I still prefer the more intimate, quirky portrayal of Chicago found in the Fiery Furnaces' Rehearsing My Choir to Stevens' library-card history, with Olga Sarantos' newsreel memories of donut factories, bowling alleys, and other architectural gravestones forming a more tangible rendering of the old city still present underneath the skyscraper skin. Next year the fickle music world will probably be back to writing 2,000 more songs about New York, but for 12 months at least, I had a multi-album audiotour for my very own beloved city of residence. --Rob Mitchum"
