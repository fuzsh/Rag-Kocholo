Chance's sophomore effort (the follow-up album to CMT Award Winning, \"Be Real\") has already received thousands of positive reviews from fans who have picked up a physical copy at \"live\" shows which came out May 2nd during the CD Release Series throughout Washington State.\n\nOf the 11 tracks on the CD, 3 were written by Chance McKinney (and co-write, Kevin Ray Lawson). The other 8 were submitted by multi-platinum writers Frank Myers (12 #1's on Chris Young, Lonestar, John Michael Montgomery), Craig Wiseman (17 #1's on Kenny Chesney, Toby Keith, Faith Hill, Brooks and Dunn), Brett James (11 #1's on Carrie Underwood, Kenny Chesney, Rascal Flatts, Tim McGraw, Gary Allan, Jason Aldean), David Lee, David Frasier, James LeBlanc, Craig Boyd, Bobby Pinson, Brad Crisler and more.\n\n\"It was 11 of the top 500 songs pitched for this project, including the songs I written or co-written on\" says McKinney. \"See, I wasn't bull-headed enough to think all my stuff was going to be better than everything out there so I put a majority of the decision-making process in Kevin Ray Lawson's (Producer) hands. When he came back to me with his Top 20 and we compared it to my Top 20... There were 13 songs in common. And in those 13, I was nothin' short of amazed to find 3 of mine! From that point on, it was a 2-man brawl to narrow it down to 11 and get the album cut. But, after we both got out of the hospital with my severe hangnail and a bruise to Kevin's shin, we got it done.\"\n\nMcKinney goes on to say \"I realistically never thought it'd get finished. There's so much to the process, especially when done right. And all the while, we're testing songs at 'live' shows to get audience reaction to make sure we were on the right track. I guess it all came to a head (emotionally) for me when I finished a show in Wenatchee, WA and I sat down to sign some stuff for the first little girl in line. When I held the CD, and told her, it was the first time I'd held (or signed it, for that matter) the Think About That CD... we both began to cry.\"\n\n\"I've gone through things nobody should have to go through or know about in the music industry to make sure I honor those (my fans, former students and family) who put me in this position just 3 years ago with the CMT Win. I truly hope Think About That is a step in the direction they want to see me go.\"\n\nIt's now a matter of setting the Music Industry on its ear with a strong showing at iTunes.

It will be the first concert at the new venue.\n\nMcKinney, a former math teacher at Kamiak, beat out 63 other unsigned country singer-songwriters to win CMT’s Music City Madness contest in 2009.\n\nSince winning CMT’s contest, McKinney has been touring nationwide, performing most of his shows in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n“I love it,” McKinney said of the change from teaching to performing. “I get to do music for a living.\n\n“It’s huge, really. It’s like being a kid and playing all the time.”\n\nWhen the Kamiak Grad Knight Committee contacted him about returning to Mukilteo for a benefit concert, he was more than willing to do it.\n\n“We thought this would be a great opportunity for him to come back and see the community again, help the senior class and promote his music,” said Mary Cartwright, chair of the concert.\n\n“Most of the shows are 21 and over, so it’s a rare all-ages opportunity. Most of the places are either bars or casinos.”\n\nAll proceeds from the concert go to Kamiak’s Grad Night, an all-night safe and sober party for Kamiak seniors after they graduate.\n\nThis is the second concert McKinney has performed to benefit Kamiak. The first was held last January.\n\nEver since the first benefit concert in Mukilteo, Cartwright and her friend Janet Hammond – they met at the concert – have been Chance McKinney fans. They go to as many shows as they can where they help to manage T-shirt and CD sales for the band.\n\n“I’m proud of them,” she said. “It’s been very fun to say, ‘Wow, we were there from the beginning.’”\n\nMcKinney said the concert at Rosehill represents his continued thanks to the 2,200 students at Kamiak for telling friends and family in at least 28 states and five countries to vote for his original song “Be Real.”\n\n“After all of the opportunities they opened up for me in this last year, the least I can do is come back whenever it makes sense to help out any way I can.”\n\nAfter the first benefit concert, the band immediately started touring. They performed on TV and radio and for venues all over Washington, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Utah – reaching the ears of 13 million in their first week.\n\nIn between concerts, they flew to Nashville, Tenn., to film a Studio 330 session for www.cmt.com and audition with the Valory Music Co., which signed Reba McEntire.\n\nSo far, the band has toured with the likes of Blake Shelton – the CMA male vocalist of the year – as well as Luke Bryan, Lynyrd Skynyrd, 38 Special, Creedence Clearwater Revisited, Pat Green, Jamie O’Neal and more.\n\nWith all the touring, McKinney had to resign as a math teacher at Kamiak. He now has places in Washington, Tennessee and Utah, which alternate as his home whether he’s off or on tour.\n\n“It’s been a little bit hectic,” McKinney said. “I’ve been on the road quite a bit.”\n\nValory held onto McKinney’s signing rights until December – the company decided to sign Rascal Flatts instead of him – so now he’s back on the market, looking for a label. McKinney said they’ve met with several other labels since then.\n\n“There’s a bunch of labels out there,” he said. “It’s just finding the right fit, I mean, who believes in what you’re doing, and we’ll see what shakes out.”\n\nSince last February, the band has added 62 new and original songs to their repertoire. They’ll be performing some of the new songs, some covers and some songs from their CD “Be Real” at the Feb. 11 concert.\n\nCartwright said the support from the Mukilteo community – and especially the Kamiak High School community – was instrumental in McKinney’s success. The concert is an opportunity to see that success, she said.\n\n“Just to see where he’s gone and where he’s going, and to be a part of that exciting ride,” she said. “In less than a year, he’s gone from being a math teacher to touring nationwide.”\n\n“We’re all a part of the history of the band. I know that sounds corny, but it’s just been really neat. I really think they’re going to go places.”\n\nAdvance tickets are $10 for students and $15 for adults, and are available now. All tickets are $15 at the door.
