        "text": "Album Pre-Order and “Damn Country Music” Available (September 1)\n\nNASHVILLE, TENN. (August 28, 2023) – Multi-PLATINUM singer songwriter Riley Green today officially announces his hotly anticipated new album, Ain’t My Last Rodeo will be released October 13 via BMLG Records. The Alabama good ol’ boy, whose close relationship with fans has guided his entire career, recently shared the news onstage at Ohio Stadium, setting social media ablaze with excitement. The 12-track project delivers more of the signature no-gimmick, undeniably Country sound fans have come to know, love and obsess over from the rising star.\n\nThe music and lyrics are heavily influenced by the rural, small town and slower way of life Green returns to after performing for thousands of fans. Ain’t My Last Rodeo is a window into his experiences, values, pastimes and love of family. The title bares its name from a poignant track on the album, “My Last Rodeo,” which Green wrote solo following one of the final conversations he had with his late Grandaddy Buford while in the hospital. Buford Green was the brains behind converting his great-grandparents’ home into the Golden Saw Music Hall and is credited for Riley’s musical appreciation, education and inspiration. On his mother’s side, his Granddaddy Lyndon can be attributed for Riley’s love of the outdoors, heard in tracks like “Mississippi or Me”.\n\n“I was fortunate enough to grow up within about three miles of my grandparents, so they were a huge part of my growing up and who I am—and this album is a lot of who I am,” says Riley Green. “This is really the first time I was able to really take my time, write and record songs that really felt like a cohesive album—I’m really proud of it and want to thank the fans for all of their encouragement—I hope y’all enjoy it.”\n\nIn addition to several brand-new tracks, including a song with Jelly Roll, the forthcoming album also features several familiar tunes including a cover of Tim McGraw’s “Damn Country Music,” which will be available (along with the album pre-order) this Friday, September 1. To many fans’ content, Green also released several songs he’d been testing for his millions of fans on social media, including “Mississippi or Me,” “Raised Up Right,” and “God Made A Good Ol’ Boy.”\n\nAin’t My Last Rodeo also includes his current single, “Different ‘Round Here (Ft. Luke Combs),” which is currently climbing through the Top 30 at Country radio with more than 250M streams. Initially released in 2019, the track was a fan-favorite, spurring a flurry of passion and social attention.\n\nThe former Jacksonville State University quarterback is currently riding a huge wave of success—after playing to an average of 65,000 fans each night serving as direct support for Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs this year, Green headlined his hometown festival Rock The South and has sold ~85,000 tickets across his 17 headlining shows. In addition to many outdoor lifestyle brand partnerships, Green was also recently named the latest spokesperson for Gildan and stars in their latest commercial.\n\nMore information will be shared in the coming weeks.\n\nAin’t My Last Rodeo Track List:\n\n“Damn Country Music” – (Jessi Alexander, Cary Barlowe, Josh Thompson)\n\n“They Don’t Make ‘Em Like That No More” – (Riley Green, Chris Lindsey, Aimee Mayo)\n\n“Mississippi Or Me” – (Riley Green, Tyler Reeve, Josh Thompson)\n\n“Different ‘Round Here (featuring Luke Combs)” – (Riley Green, Randy Montana, Jonathan Singleton)\n\n“Ain’t Like I Can Hide It” – (Riley Green, Chris Dubois, Bobby Pinson)\n\n“Copenhagen In A Cadillac (featuring Jelly Roll)” – (Riley Green, Erik Dylan, Wyatt McCubbin)\n\n“Damn Good Day To Leave” – (Riley Green, Erik Dylan, Jonathan Singleton, Nick Walsh)\n\n“My Last Rodeo” – (Riley Green)\n\n“Workin’ On Me” – (Riley Green, Rhett Akins, Randy Montana)\n\n“Raised Up Right” – (Riley Green, Jeremy Bussey, Chris Dubois, Lynn Hutton)"
