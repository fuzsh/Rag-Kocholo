        "text": "STAIND frontman Aaron Lewis has released the official music video for \"Over The Hill\", one of the tunes included on his latest solo album, \"The Hill\".\n\n\"'Over The Hill' is the realization that we all make mistakes, take different paths and learn as we go,\" explains Lewis. \"I've embraced it with no regrets. I hope my fans enjoy the music video. It's a great visual element to a song that really sums up my life perfectly.\"\n\nAccording to Forbes, \"The Hill\" debuted at No. 175 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 8,133 equivalent units, a combination of pure album sales and on-demand streams. It marks the lowest-charting record on the Billboard 200 of Lewis's solo career so far.\n\nNotably, \"The Hill\" had 6,826 pure album sales in its first week, enough to land the LP at No. 5 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart, which ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Lewis previously reached the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 twice as a solo artist, with his \"Town Line\" EP, which reached No. 7 in 2011, and with \"Sinner\", which peaked at No. 4 in 2016. He also landed in the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 with \"The Road\" (No. 30 peak),\"State I'm In\" (No. 19) and \"Frayed At Both Ends\" (No. 39).\n\n\"The Hill\" track listing:\n\n01. Let's Go Fishing (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n02. Over The Hill (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\n03. Made In China (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n04. Spinnin' (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n05. Over Me (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n06. Outlaw (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\n07. Up To Me (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n08. That's My Life (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n09. Only In My Mind (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n10. Little More Mine (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\n\"Made In China\" — written by Lewis and Bobby Pinson — offers the loud-and-proud declaration that some things are still made in the USA. The song features such lyrics as \"I ain't made in China / From all the cheapest parts / I ain't one for driving them imported foreign cars / I'm more like American muscle from 1966 / I ain't made in China / I'm American as it gets / I ain't made by Uyghur kids for pennies on the dollar / I'm made in the USA / It says so on my collar / Tried and true, red, white and blue / My roots run way too thick / yeah, I ain't made in China / 'Cause I'm American as it gets.\"\n\n\"The best songs come from a place of authenticity,\" explained Lewis. \"This one started as a conversation with friends as we picked up items around the room with 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. And we put pen to paper.\"\n\nThe \"Let's Go Fishing\" lyrics find the 52-year-old Lewis — an outspoken conservative rocker who reinvented himself as a solo country artist in the last decade — singing about \"making America great again\", \"turning off CNN\" and using the \"Let's Go, Brandon!\" catchphrase, which was coined by American conservatives to criticize President Joe Biden.\n\nLewis made headlines in September 2021 when he urged his fans to chant \"Fuck Joe Biden\" during a STAIND concert in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn March 2022, Lewis told the Los Angeles Times that he doesn't blindly listen to information that is delivered by the mainstream media.\n\n\"I'm not uneducated; I'm actually really smart, and I look for myself. I seek other options of information,\" he said. \"I refuse to believe that a huge, gigantic corporation has our best interest in mind.\"\n\nAsked where he gets his news, Lewis said: \"I have news feeds and people that I follow on Telegram. Dan Ball. Andrew Wilkow. Mark Levin. If I'm gonna watch any sort of news source on television, it's Tucker Carlson.\"\n\nAt some of his solo concerts, Lewis has been taking the stage while wearing a black hat with white mesh and white lettering on the front clearly stating \"FUJOE,\" an expletive directed toward Biden."
