        "text": "TOURING THIS SUMMER WITH DIERKS BENTLEY\n\nCONFIRMED FOR CMA FEST, FASTER HORSES, WATERSHED, AND MORE\n\nLouisiana-bred rising artist Graham Barham has teamed with Lauren Watkins for their striking new duet, “Straight to My Heart.” Listen HERE.\n\nRepresenting both sides of a breakup gone bad, the pair exchange lines full of heartbreak before joining on the hook-heavy chorus.\n\n“The title was Lydia Vaughan’s idea, and I’ve been wanting to write a song with Lauren for a long time. It worked out well that Will Bundy, my best friend and producer, is her fiancé and they were counseling me through a relationship at the time,” shared Barham. “Lauren was such an important part of writing this song, and of course she and Will knew what was happening in my life. She took the reins, and we wrote the song and cut it all within 36 hours.”\n\n“When Lydia brought the title, Graham was immediately like, ‘That clicks with me,’ so from there, we just ran with it,” added Watkins, who is opening stadium dates with Morgan Wallen this summer. “Lydia and Will are both such amazing writers and we all found how we could each relate to the song, so we really dove into helping Graham say what he wanted to say. It just came naturally.”\n\nThe release follows Barham’s autobiographical track “BAYOU BOY,” which Billboard praised as “a delightfully churning, swamp-rock stomper” where “Barham’s vocal pulses with urgency and exhilaration.”\n\nBarham will spend the summer on the road with the likes of Dierks Bentley and Tyler Braden, plus performing at festivals including CMA Fest, Faster Horses, Watershed, Carolina Country Music Festival, and more.\n\nAbout Graham Barham:\n\nRaised on a farm in Oak Ridge, Louisiana (population: 124), Barham draws upon the lush imagery of his small southern hometown in his songs. The son of a farmer and a schoolteacher, Barham began singing in church as a little kid and taught himself to play guitar and write music by the age of 10. At age 18, he made his way to Nashville and began penning tunes for artists in town, dialing in a distinctive balance of compassion, honesty, and humor in his songwriting, while mining inspiration from classic country artists like George Strait as well as heavy hitters in the pop world. Barham shared his debut single “Preachers Need People” in 2022, which promptly brought viral success. Since, he’s released several tracks like the irresistibly fun “BREAK IT IN A BAR,” the twangy rebound tune “TWO BROKE HEARTS,” and the slow-burning and regretful “BEER BY MY BED,” all of which highlight his homespun storytelling with lived-in detail. Named a Spotify Artist to Watch for 2024, Barham kicked off the year by announcing his signing with Sony Music Nashville and Disruptor Records. Fans can catch Barham on select tour dates with Dierks Bentley, Dylan Scott, and Tyler Braden this spring.\n\nFacebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube\n\nListen Here\n\nToday, rising country star Dylan Marlowe debuts his latest track, “Bat Outta Hell (With A Boat On The Back).” Written by Marlowe along with Jessie Jo Dillon and Kyle Fishman, the song details finding out she’s leaving while fishing. The result: driving like “a bat outta hell with a boat on the back” to get back home before she’s gone. Listen here.\n\nRecently, Marlowe and Curb Records’ Country hitmaker Dylan Scottdebuted the rowdy, backwoods music video for their anthemic single “Boys Back Home,” watch here. Cutting between scenes of jacked-up trucks, dirt bikes, race cars and even a surprise cameo from Russell Dickerson, the video is an ode to an epic southern night with the hometown crowd. The release lives up to Raised Rowdy’s impression that “these fellas are just two good ole country peas in a pod…when these two get together, it is one hell of a party.” With over 50 million total global streams, “Boys Back Home” is impacting country radio now.\n\nMarlowe’s follow up to “Boys Back Home,” “You Did It Too,” arrived last month. The song is an honest depiction of the life he knows. Watch the music video HERE.\n\nThis year, Marlowe was selected to be part of Amazon Music’s Breakthrough Artists To Watch Country Class. He was also named a CMT Listen Up artist as well as an “Artist to Watch” by Pandora, Holler, Music Mayhem, and Grammy.com, who noted, “it’s clear Marlowe knows how to pen a hit.”\n\nFollowing his opening stint on HARDY’s the mockingbird and THE CROW FALL TOUR along with Lainey Wilson, Marlowe is currently on his headline DIRT ROAD WHEN I DIE TOUR. Most dates of which are sold out, including his show at Nashville’s EXIT/IN last month. Today’s Country Magazine lauded his performance, sharing: “Balancing between tempos throughout the night, though masterfully staying bent on upbeat numbers, the edges of Marlowe’s vocal walked the heart into each word of every lyric, resulting in an 18-song, jaw dropping performance that expanded the facets of each side of who he is as a singer, songwriter, performer, and artist, opening the photo album of his career in what played out like an appreciative thank you note to his fans for all their incredible support.” For tickets and more information, visit dylanmarloweofficial.com.\n\nAbout Dylan Marlowe: Statesboro, Georgia native Dylan Marlowe is Nashville’s newest rising star on the country music scene, where he comes likely wearing camouflage and an audible smile, equipped with a sound that blends traditional country themes with a touch of rock. Dylan was named as one of Spotify’s Hot Country Artists to Watch for 2023 and now has an exciting year of firsts under his belt, with promise to make an even bigger splash in 2024. Marlowe got to celebrate his first No. 1 as a songwriter with Jon Pardi’s “Last Night Lonely,” he made his Grand Ole Opry debut, got married, and released his debut EP, Dirt Road When I Die. Billboard noted that the project “ranges from banjo-flecked country to headbanger tones with tight, edgy harmonies certifying his country roots.” Dirt Road When I Die features the soaring title track plus “You Were Right (Nat’s Song),” which Dylan released as a surprise for his now-wife on their wedding day in May. Country Now lauded his “raw, consoling vocals” on the song, noting that the “elegant piano melody takes the ballad to new heights.” Another buzzworthy song on the project,“Record High,” was praised by MusicRow as “Moody and haunting. The soundscape ripples with dobro, muted percussion and chimed electronics. His broken-hearted delivery aches with sincerity. Excellent work.” In addition to the EP, Dylan was featured on Avery Anna’s “I Will (When You Do)” and Kasey Tyndall’s “Place For Me,” and in October he released his new collab with Dylan Scott, “Boys Back Home,” which is impacting country radio now. The song received over 3.2 million global streams in its first week.\n\nThe singer spent last fall opening for HARDY’s the mockingbird and THE CROW FALL TOUR along with Lainey Wilson. He also toured with Jordan Davis, Morgan Wallen and Scotty McCreery last year. Dylan is currently on his headline DIRT ROAD WHEN I DIE, where the majority of the shows are already sold out. With over half a million followers on social media, the singer continues to grow his fan base each day with his captivating live performance and his heartfelt, hooky lyrics.\n\nDylanMarloweOfficial.com | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok | YouTube\n\nKEEPIN’ THE LIGHTS ON, OUT MAY 31\n\nThe moving title-track and visualizer drop today, shedding light on the vulnerable tone of album\n\nMarlowe heads Down Under for Lainey Wilson’s Country’s Cool Again Tour; kicks off headlining StrangersTour next month\n\nCountry powerhouse vocalist and Columbia recording artist Kameron Marlowe unveils his long-awaited sophomore album Keepin’ The Lights On, available Friday, May 31. The album’s announcement is accompanied by the poignant title track and visualizer, available everywhere today. Featuring sixteen meticulously crafted tracks, including the previously acclaimed singles “Quit You,” “Strangers (with Ella Langley)” and “Tennessee Don’t Mind,” Marlowe’s forthcoming record is a testament to his evolution as an artist for the ages. Enlisting esteemed writers including Kendell Marvel, Michael Hardy and Wyatt McCubbin, and produced by Dann Huff, Keepin’ The Lights On extends an invitation into Marlowe’s life – from childhood to modern day – through a transparent showcase of growth, maturity and most importantly, a lifetime of fulfilling promises.\n\nPRE-SAVE/PRE-ADD: KEEPIN’ THE LIGHTS ON\n\n“I feel like I discovered a lot about myself while making this record,” shares Marlowe. “I got to reflect on a lot of life from when I was a kid to life today. This album explores everything from loss to love, depression to joy, and overcoming the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough. I found myself looking at life through a different lens throughout the process. The namesake of the album, ‘Keepin’ The Lights On’ came from a conversation with my dad over the holidays about how he’s always thanking the man upstairs for keeping it all together, especially when times get tough. For me, this record is a reminder of hard work, dedication and keeping the promises that we make. It’s still crazy to me that people are listening to a small town boy from Kannapolis, N.C., but here I am releasing my second album. I can’t wait for y’all to hear it.”\n\nWith the release of the title track, “Keepin’ The Lights On,” Marlowe offers his loyal fanbase a taste of what’s to come. Co-penned by Marlowe, Marvel and Phil O’Donnell, the acoustic flavor of “Keepin’ The Lights On” grips a softly paced melody that allows the richness of Marlowe’s vulnerability to authentically deliver heartfelt lyrics. He strikes expertly timed vocal bends that make every word hold high importance. Through a lens full of understanding who he is today, the “sterling vocalist” (MusicRow) appreciatively revisits the unconditional sacrifices that his parents made during his formative years. Marlowe shines a bright spotlight on his incredible determination as he navigates the reasons that he continues to push through the struggles of chasing down his dreams.\n\nThe upcoming 16-track output promises to showcase Marlowe’s versatility as an artist, offering a blend of moments drenched in honky-tonk rhythm and melody laced with a dusty aura of solid Country gold. Focused on heart-gripping lyrics that dig into life’s struggles, he exposes the familiarity of heartbreak but positively shifts into the idea of breaking down your walls to let in the one who changes everything. With his incredibly gifted “tried and true country melodies” (Whiskey Riff) holding the bright spotlight, he balances each impeccable tone of his voice into every word with remarkable precision to authentically guide the listener through a bevy of raw emotion, whether it be on a song he co-wrote himself or through an outside cut that perfectly fit his story.\n\nKEEPIN’ THE LIGHTS ON TRACK LIST:\n\n1. “911” (Wyatt McCubbin/John Pierce/Micah Wilshire)\n\n2. “Nothin’ Slowin’ Us Down” (Kameron Marlowe/Mitchell Tenpenny/Rob Williford/Dallas Wilson)\n\n3. “On My Way Out” (Michael Hardy/Ben Johnson/Hunter Phelps/Taylor Phillips/Bobby Pinson)\n\n4. “Never Really Know” (Kameron Marlowe/James McNair)\n\n5. “Tennessee Don’t Mind” (Charles Kelley/Daniel Tashian)\n\n6. “Leaning On You” (Kameron Marlowe/Erik Dylan/Wyatt McCubbin/Taylor Phillips)\n\n7. “I Can Run” (Tucker Beathard/Oscar Charles Gnaedig/Ben Roberts)\n\n8. “High Hopes” (Josh Osborne/Trevor Rosen/Brad Tursi)\n\n9. “One That I Don’t Call” (Wyatt McCubbin/James McNair/John Pierce)\n\n10. “Lock Me Up” (Ben Johnson/Jordan Minton/Hunter Phelps/Taylor Phillips)\n\n11. “Will It Be There in the Morning” (Kameron Marlowe/Mitchell Tenpenny/Dallas Wilson)\n\n12. “Quit You” (Kameron Marlowe/James McNair/John Pierce)\n\n13. “Smaller” (Erik Dylan/Wyatt McCubbin)\n\n14. “Strangers (with Ella Langley)” (Kameron Marlowe/Ella Langley/Will Bundy/Chase McGill)\n\n15. “Broke Down in a Truck” (Taylor Baynum/Nathan Justis/Dave Michael/Colby Williford)\n\n16. “Keepin’ the Lights On” (Kameron Marlowe/Kendell Marvel/Phil O’Donnell)\n\nThe album announcement follows the release of “Strangers (with Ella Langley),” and the momentum carried over to a fierynew music video to put the “steamy, well-produced twist of a ballad” (Country Central) into visuals. Of the red-hot collaboration, Billboard hails they “offer a mighty vocal pairing” as their “octave-jumping talents push the other’s to ever-heightened moments of angst.” The performance sees “sparks fly” (MusicRow) as the powerhouse duo “bring their a-game vocals to the agonizingly beautiful song” (Country Swag).\n\nWATCH: “Strangers” Music Video\n\nA streaming and vocal powerhouse with over 860M total global streams to date, Marlowe charges into 2024 as MusicRow’sNext Big Thing, reinforcing previous acclaim from Opry’s NextStage, CMT’s Listen Up, Amazon Music’s One to Watch, Pandora, Spotify and more than a dozen media outlets.

The song also hit No. 1 on the Mediabase/Country Aircheck chart for three weeks.\n\nLast week, Smith debuted his latest anthemic single today, “Bulletproof,” along with an official video.

Smith shared about the project, “I’ve been through a lot of adversity in my life, but ‘through the smoke’ came to mind one day and I thought that was the perfect way to describe making it through tragedy. It captures what it looks like on the other side of heartbreak, on the other side of tragedy, on the other side of giving everything you’ve got to go after what you want to do in life. I think this EP is a transition between all the fire and pain and everything I went through, and then overcoming. And that’s what I want people to feel. It’s layered in there.”\n\nLast month, Smith brought a fiery performance of “World On Fire” to NBC’s TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, watch here. With over 175 million global streams to date, “World On Fire” follows Smith’s Platinum-certified, multi-week No. 1 debut single “Whiskey On You.” Only 19 songs went No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart last year, two of which belong to Smith.\n\n“World On Fire” is one of 26 tracks on Smith’s self-titled album released last year.

Visit NateSmithOfficial.com for a full list of upcoming shows and additional info.\n\nAbout Nate Smith:\n\nFeaturing a mix of gritty backwoods soul, rock ‘n’ roll swagger and velvet-thunder vocals, Nate Smith’s personal journey inspired him to be a beacon of country-music hope, an inspirational mission he puts front-and-center. A California native, former worship leader, and lifelong music lover, Smith approaches that mission with a background as eclectic as it gets. Learning guitar at 13, Garth Brooks, Elvis Presley and Bob Seger were among those informing his powerful, fire-from-within vocals, while Michael Jackson made him crave the spotlight and Nirvana gave his sound a jagged edge. In 2018, Smith lost everything he owned in the devastating Camp Fire which tore through Paradise, California, now known as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. Although his family was safe, he struggled to cope and turned back to music, hoping that it would help comfort himself and others. Help it did, inspiring a month-long road trip across the U.S. to Music City, writing music and playing dive bars along the way.\n\nSince making it to Nashville, the singer’s “powerhouse tenor” has become “perhaps country music’s fastest-rising beloved voice” (The Tennessean). He’s made a huge splash with songs such as his Platinum-certified multi-week No. 1 hit “Whiskey On You,” which was lauded as the “breakup song of the summer” by Country Now and “an enormously satisfying country kiss-off anthem” by Stereogum. The smash hit has racked up over 420 million total global on-demand streams to date, contributing to Nate’s billion total catalog streams globally. Nate released his debut, self-titled album along with the deluxe version on April 28. The hefty 26-song project hit #6 on Billboard’s Country album charts and #30 on the Billboard Top 200. His latest single off the album, “World On Fire,” reached No. 1 on the country radio charts in December, and has remained at the top of the charts for ten consecutive weeks. The CMT Awards and ACM Awards nominee spent the summer touring alongside Thomas Rhett and Cole Swindell. He kicked off his headline WORLD ON FIRE TOUR 2024 in January and will hit the road with Morgan Wallen this spring/summer. Nate is managed by Kevin “Chief” Zaruk and Simon Tikhman with The Core Entertainment.\n\nNateSmithOfficial.com | Instagram | TikTok | Facebook | YouTube\n\nToday, Sony Music Nashville/Columbia Records superstar Megan Moroney premieres a brand-new version of “No Caller ID” from the Emo Cowgirl Live Sessions — an all-acoustic performance recorded and filmed at Clementine Hall in Nashville. Go here to check out the Emo Cowgirl Live Sessions version of “No Caller ID” now.\n\nAn immediate fan favorite since Moroney first shared the song during her sold-out THE LUCKY TOUR last year, “No Caller ID” takes on a breathtaking new life in the Emo Cowgirl Live Sessions video. With all the warmth and pure emotion she brings to every live performance, the Georgia-bred singer/songwriter fully embodies the melancholy mood at heart of the song — a gorgeously detailed account of getting a late-night phone call from an ex just when you’ve started to move on with your life. Accompanied by guitarists Benji Shanks and Kristian Bush (also Moroney’s frequent producer/collaborator) and pedal-steel player Justin Schipper — all of whom played on the song’s studio version — Moroney adds even more intensity and intimacy to each line of “No Caller ID,” thanks in large part to her raw yet ravishing vocal work.\n\nReleased last month, “No Caller ID” proved to be an instant sensation as the track set the record for the biggest Country female song debut in streams in the U.S., while racking up 8.4 MILLION global streams in the first week as well as generating over 92 million views and 15k creations using “No Caller ID” on TikTok. Since the song the first dropped, Moroney has also amassed more than 100k new followers across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube — marking the start of what promises to be a blockbuster year for Country’s It Girl. Meanwhile, Moroney currently has two songs in the Top 30 on Country radio: “I’m Not Pretty” (the magnetic opening track to LUCKY) and “Can’t Break Up Now” (her recent collaboration with Old Dominion).\n\nIn another major triumph for Moroney, her upcoming THE LUCKY 2.O TOUR sold out just five minutes after tickets went on sale in late January. Solidifying her status as an in-demand headliner, her third consecutive headline run kicks off on April 19 in Dothan, Alabama, and is currently set to run through July 26 in Aspen, Colorado. With special guest Logan Crosby as support, the tour takes its name from Moroney’s massively acclaimed debut album LUCKY — a 2023 LP that quickly propelled her to best-of-the-year lists from major outlets like The New York Times and Rolling Stone and featured her 2X PLATINUM, No. 1 breakout “Tennessee Orange.”\n\nThis spring and summer, Moroney will also take the stage at stadiums across the country as support for Kenny Chesney’s SUN DOWN 2024 TOUR, in addition to appearing at high-profile festivals such as Stagecoach in April.

She’s also up for three 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards: Best New Artist (Country), plus all-genre, fan-voted categories Favorite Debut Album and Social Star, broadcasting live April 1 at 8/7c on FOX (vote here).\n\nABOUT MEGAN MORONEY:\n\nOne of Country’s biggest breakout stars in recent years, Megan Moroney first burst onto the scene with her RIAA 2X PLATINUM hit single “Tennessee Orange” — an immediate smash showcasing her true-to-life storytelling, unforgettable vocals, and strong-minded yet fiercely sensitive point of view. Along with notching her first No. 1 at Country radio and landing on coveted lists like the Los Angeles Times’ “100 best songs of 2023,” “Tennessee Orange” soon found the Sony Music Nashville/Columbia Records artist winning Breakthrough Female Video of the Year at the CMT Music Awards and making her debut appearances on major TV shows like TODAY, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Good Morning America, and New Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash. A Georgia native who got her start singing covers with her dad and brother — and later began penning her own songs while studying accounting at the University of Georgia — Moroney made her massively acclaimed full-length debut with 2023’s LUCKY: a powerhouse body of work that turned up on best-of-the-year lists from leading outlets like The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Billboard, and The Associated Press (who hailed her as a “Gen Z songwriter with Taylor Swift-level acuity”). Produced by Kristian Bush and built on a timeless collision of Country, Folk, and Southern Rock, LUCKY also revealed the lived-in intimacy and electrifying impact of her songwriting on tracks like “I’m Not Pretty” (her current single, praised by Billboard as a “cheeky, defiant clapback”). As she continued her meteoric rise, the Nashville-based musician earned nominations by CMA, ACM, and Billboard Music Awards, in addition to appearing at The GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles as part of its illustrious SPOTLIGHT series in the midst of her sold-out THE LUCKY TOUR — a fall 2023 run that brought her magnetic live show to iconic venues across the U.S. Recently featured on Forbes’ 30 Under 30, MusicRow’s Next Big Thing Class of 2024, and Country Radio Seminar’s New Faces of Country Music, she kicked off 2024 with her stunning new song “No Caller ID.” With more new music on the way — and over 824 MILLION total global streams to date — Moroney will join Kenny Chesney on his SUN DOWN 2024 TOUR and perform at Stagecoach Festival in April.\n\nJust in time for Fat Tuesday, Sony Music Nashville/Disruptor Records newcomer and Louisiana native Graham Barham debuted his latest track, “BAYOU BOY.” Listen here.\n\n“Dropping ‘BAYOU BOY’ felt like the right opportunity to properly introduce myself and to let my audience know who I am,” said Barham. Co-written with Beau Bailey and Will Bundy, the song is an ode to life in Barham’s home state and highlights the singer-songwriter’s trademark clever wordplay bringing to life distinctive imagery of the bayou, from mossy oaks to Mardi Gras beads.\n\nBarham kicked off 2024 with the release of “LIGHTS ON NOBODY’S HOME,” a playful take on drinking away heartbreak. He was named as one of Spotify’s 2024 Hot Country Artists to Watch, as well as an Artist To Watch in 2024 by Music Mayhem.\n\nRaised on a farm in Oak Ridge, Louisiana (population: 124), Barham draws upon the lush setting of his small southern hometown in his songs. The son of a farmer and a schoolteacher, Barham began singing in church as a little kid and taught himself to play guitar and write music by the age of 10. At age 18, he made his way to Nashville and began penning tunes for artists in town, dialing in a distinctive balance of compassion, honesty, and humor in his songwriting, while mining inspiration from classic country artists like George Strait as well as heavy hitters in the pop world.\n\nBarham shared his debut single “Preachers Need People” in 2022, which promptly brought viral success. He’s since released several tracks like the irresistibly fun “BREAK IT IN A BAR,” twangy rebound tune “TWO BROKE HEARTS,” and the slow-burning and regretful “BEER BY MY BED,” all of which highlight his homespun storytelling with lived-in detail.\n\nFans can catch Barham on select tour dates with Adam Doleac, Dierks Bentley, Dylan Scott, and Tyler Braden this spring.

The accomplishment ties Morgan Wallen’s “Last Night,” Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett’s “It’s Five O’Clock Somewhere” and Lonestar’s “Amazed” for the second-longest No. 1 chart reign since Country Airplay began in 1990. The song also hit No. 1 on the Mediabase/Country Aircheck chart for three weeks.\n\nNate shared with Billboard, “N8 Weeks At No 1. The crazy thing about this song is that it wasn’t even supposed to come out! It was starting to gain a lot of traction on social media and the demand was high. I’m so lucky to have a team that knew how to strategically release it alongside my debut album by releasing the deluxe version the same day that the debut dropped. This song completely anchored the album. My mind is absolutely blown hearing the news that ‘World On Fire’ has gone #1 for an 8th straight week. Thank you to the fans and thank you country radio!”\n\nLast month, Smith brought a fiery performance of the smash hit to NBC’s TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, watch here. With over 165 million global streams to date, “World On Fire” follows Smith’s Platinum-certified, multi-week No. 1 debut single “Whiskey On You.” Only 19 songs went No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart last year, two of which belong to Smith.\n\n“World On Fire” is one of 26 tracks on Smith’s self-titled album released last year. The album hit #6 on Billboard’s Country albums chart and #30 overall on the Billboard Top 200. Nate Smith also includes RIAA Gold-certified hits “Wreckage” and “Under My Skin.” Smith now has over a billion total career streams worldwide and has achieved four No.1s on SiriusXM The Highway’s Hot 30 Weekend Countdown: “Whiskey On You,” “I Found You,” “Better Boy,” and “World On Fire.”\n\nPress raved about Nate Smith, with The Tennessean sharing that it “lends itself well to country’s radio-ready expectations, but also is so well-delivered that it explodes them, too… Smith’s vocal is a flexible instrument that is so genuinely powerful that, aided by intentional musicianship, it achieves songs that feel familiar in a heart-warming and instantly connective manner.” Billboard lauded his “formidable, rangy and raw vocal power” while Holler noted that his range bears “resemblance to country legend Vince Gill, whose vocal control could cause fainting spells three states over,” adding that “this is Smith’s superpower.”\n\nThe Paradise, CA native is gearing up to release his new track, “Bulletproof,” on Friday (2.9). Smith shared the song on his social media in recent weeks, garnering millions of views. Pre-add/pre-save the track HERE.\n\nSmith kicked off his headline WORLD ON FIRE TOUR last month, where he’ll stop in 21 major cities across the country including Chicago, Indianapolis, NYC, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Sacramento. Afterwards, he’ll join Morgan Wallen for his ONE NIGHT AT A TIME 2024 tour. He will open the highly sought-after tour in stadiums across the country, with stops in Arlington (TX), Charlotte, Denver, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Nashville, Oxford (MS), Tampa and other cities.

The show will air LIVE on FOX on Monday, April 1 at 7pm CT, as well as broadcast live on 150+ iHeartRadio stations around the country.\n\nFresh off a breakout year in 2023, Smith gears up to blaze his way through 2024 with a stacked schedule of tour dates and new music in the works. Visit NateSmithOfficial.com for a full list of upcoming shows and additional info.\n\nAbout Nate Smith:\n\nFeaturing a mix of gritty backwoods soul, rock ‘n’ roll swagger and velvet-thunder vocals, Nate Smith’s personal journey inspired him to be a beacon of country-music hope, an inspirational mission he puts front-and-center. A California native, former worship leader, and lifelong music lover, Smith approaches that mission with a background as eclectic as it gets. Learning guitar at 13, Garth Brooks, Elvis Presley and Bob Seger were among those informing his powerful, fire-from-within vocals, while Michael Jackson made him crave the spotlight and Nirvana gave his sound a jagged edge. In 2018, Smith lost everything he owned in the devastating Camp Fire which tore through Paradise, California, now known as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. Although his family was safe, he struggled to cope and turned back to music, hoping that it would help comfort himself and others. Help it did, inspiring a month-long road trip across the U.S. to Music City, writing music and playing dive bars along the way.\n\nSince making it to Nashville, the singer’s “powerhouse tenor” has become “perhaps country music’s fastest-rising beloved voice” (The Tennessean). He’s made a huge splash with songs such as his Platinum-certified multi-week No. 1 hit “Whiskey On You,” which was lauded as the “breakup song of the summer” by Country Now and “an enormously satisfying country kiss-off anthem” by Stereogum. The smash hit has racked up over 420 million total global on-demand streams to date, contributing to Nate’s billion total catalog streams globally. Nate released his debut, self-titled album along with the deluxe version on April 28. The hefty 26-song project hit #6 on Billboard’s Country album charts and #30 on the Billboard Top 200. His latest single off the album, “World On Fire,” reached No. 1 on the country radio charts in December, and has remained at the top of the charts for eight weeks in a row. The CMT Awards and ACM Awards nominee spent the summer touring alongside Thomas Rhett and is currently on the road with Cole Swindell. He’ll kick off his headline WORLD ON FIRE TOUR 2024 in January before hitting the road with Morgan Wallen next spring/summer. Nate is managed by Kevin “Chief” Zaruk and Simon Tikhman with The Core Entertainment.\n\nNateSmithOfficial.com | Instagram | TikTok | Facebook | YouTube"
