        "text": "* Academic Honors Candidate *\n\n2011: Listed as a starter at weak-side outside linebacker on preseason depth chart. In the spring, he was presented an “Iron Eagle” Award for his off-season academic and athletic achievements. In four spring scrimmages, he had 14 tackles to rank second on the team, including a team-high nine with a sack in EWU’s Red-White Spring Game.\n\n2010: Was named to the Big Sky Conference All-Academic team for the third-straight season. Played in 14 games on special teams and as a backup linebacker. He saw significant action in the NCAA Division I Championship Game in Frisco, Texas, when Tyler Washburn was limited with a knee injury. Gentry finished with five tackles, including a pair for losses, in the come-from-behind 20-19 win over Delaware (1/7/11). Earlier in the season, he had a season-high seven tackles versus Central Washington (9/11/10) and had his first career interception against Idaho State (11/20/10). He helped the Eagle defense rank first nationally in interceptions (total of 26) and turnovers gained (47), and finish sixth nationally in red zone defense, as it allowed just 38 scores in 58 opponent trips inside the Eagle 20-yard line. He had 15 tackles in four spring scrimmages.\n\n2009: Named to the Big Sky Conference All-Academic team. Played in all 12 games as a reserve linebacker and special teams standout, and was the top tackler (57) among Eagles who did not start at least two games. He had 26 tackles in Eastern’s last three games after injuries decimated the linebacker corp. He had a career-high 12 versus Southern Utah (11/14/09) when he earned team defensive player of the week honors. He was also EWU’s special teams player of the week against Sacramento State (9/26/09).\n\n2008: Named to the Big Sky Conference All-Academic team. Played in nine games and had six tackles with a fumble recovery. Five of his tackles came in Eastern’s final game of the season against Weber State (11/22/08) in the 33-26 upset victory. He helped Eastern finish an impressive 11th in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision in rushing defense (93.5), as well as fifth in sacks (3.09 per game) and ninth nationally in tackles for loss (7.9 per game).\n\nHS: Graduated from Kennedy HS in 2007. Was named by the Seattle Times as a “White Chip” selection as one of the top 100 prospects in the state of Washington. Earned first-team All-Seamount League honors. Lettered four years in football, basketball and baseball. His Eagle teammate Domonic Shepperd (’08) also attended Kennedy.\n\nPersonal: Born 11/8/88 in Seattle. Will turn 23 the week between EWU’s games between Portland State and Cal Poly. Business administration major."
