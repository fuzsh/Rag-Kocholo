        "text": "Post by onebuffalo on\n\nThis thread is inspired by the following conversation:\n\nIâ€™m not implying that Morgan is going to be a one hit wonder but my question is is there a thread for country music one hit wonders?\n\nTen Pound Hammer had a feature like this over on Roughstock years ago -\n\nroughstock.com/topic/bobbys-one-hit-wonders\n\nI would love everyone here to participate in this thread. A few parameters have to be set up, of course. They are:\n\n1. The artist has ONLY one top 40 hit to their name.\n\n2. The example must be at least five years old.\n\n3. A story with the example MUST be told. I do not want people driving by and saying 'artist so-and-so peaked at #? with this song and that was their only top 40 hit'.\n\n4. Charts are optional. However, a video MUST be provided.\n\nI am now ready for the first example. Ray Kennedy was born in Buffalo in 1954. He signed to the Atlantic label in 1990. That was the same year he released his debut album, What A Way To Go. The lead single was the title track. That was a remake of the Bobby Borchers hit of 1977 (#18). Kennedy's version was released in November and climbed all the way to #10 in February, 1991. Two other singles were released that year: Scars (#58) and I Like The Way It Feels (#74). He managed one more album with Atlantic and that was 1992's Guitar Man. One single was released and that was No Way Jose (#70). He did not release enough singles for even a greatest hits album.\n\nBILLBOARD TOP TEN FOR WEEK ENDING FEBRUARY 16, 1991:\n\n1. Brother Jukebox-Mark Chesnutt-MCA\n\n2. Walk On Faith-Mike Reid-Columbia\n\n3. Daddy's Come Around-Paul Overstreet-RCA\n\n4. Rumor Has It-Reba McEntire-MCA\n\n5. These Lips Don't Know How To Say Goodbye-Doug Stone-Epic\n\n6. You've Got To Stand For Something-Aaron Tippin-RCA\n\n7. Love Can Build A Bridge-the Judds-RCA\n\n8. If You Want Me To-Joe Diffie-Epic\n\n9. Forever's As Far As I'll Go-Alabama-RCA\n\n10. WHAT A WAY TO GO-RAY KENNEDY-ATLANTIC\n\nPost by classiccountryfan on\n\nAnita Cochran (real name is Anita Renee Cockerham) was born in 1967. She signed with Warner Brothers Records in 1967 and released her debut album, Back to You, the same year. Her first two singles, I Could Love a Man Like That and Daddy Can You See Me, peaked at #64 and #69, respectively. The third single peaked a little higher (OK, it peaked a LOT higher). What If I Said, a duet with Steve Wariner, spent a week at #1 on the Billboard chart dated Feb. 28, 1998. The song was included on both Anita's album and Steve's 1998 album, Burnin' the Roadhouse Down. Although Anita was billed as the lead artist radio basically treated it as Steve's comeback hit as it resulted in a renewed surge of popularity. He followed it up with several more Top 40 hits, including Holes in the Floor of Heaven and Two Teardrops (both peaking at #2) and his re-recording of his first single, I'm Already Taken (#3). He also wrote, sang backup on, and played guitar on Garth Brooks' #1 hit Longneck Bottle (although he was not credited). Anita, unfortunately, was unsuccessful in follow-up attempts. Five successive singles appeared on the chart but none reached any higher than #50. Her last chart appearance, (I Wanna Hear) a Cheatin' Song (#57 in 2004), was a \"duet\" with the late Conway Twitty (Conway's vocals from some of his earlier songs were spliced in). In 2007 Anita produced Tammy Cochran's album Where I Am, although the two are not related). Billboard Top 10 for Feb. 28, 1998 (I don't have label information):\n\n1. What If I Said--Anita Cochran (duet with Steve Wariner)\n\n2. You've Got to Talk to Me--Lee Ann Womack\n\n3. Just to See You Smile--Tim McGraw (previous week's #1)\n\n4. Round About Way--George Strait (following week's #1)\n\n5. She's Gonna Make It--Garth Brooks\n\n6. I Wanna Fall In Love--Lila McCann\n\n7. Little Red Rodeo--Colin Raye\n\n8. Nothin' But the Taillights--Clint Black\n\n9. Love of My Life--Sammy Kershaw\n\n10. Imagine That--Diamond Rio\n\nPost by collinkottke on\n\nI present Julie Roberts to the one hit wonder thread. Her debut single \"Break Down Here\" peaked at #18 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated September 11, 2004. The tune was previously recorded by Trace Adkins (not a one hit wonder) under the song title of \"I'd Sure Hate To Break Down Here\". \"Break Down Here\" was the lead single to Julie Roberts' debut self-titled album for Mercury Nashville. She released two follow-up singles from the album \"The Chance\" (peaking at #47) and \"Wake Up Older\" (peaking at #46). She'd record one more album for Mercury Nashville with no singles from that effort charting. Over the years she's released an album and 4 EPs for Ain't Skeerd Records. Her most recent release of music was in 2013 for Sun Records (according to Wikipedia, yes, that Sun Records) with an album titled Good Wine and Bad Decisions.\n\nIn 2013, she auditioned for The Voice. No judges in during the Blind Auditions turned their chairs for her when she performed her take of Voice judge/coach (also not a one hit wonder)Blake Shelton's hit \"God Gave Me You\". Once the chairs turned around, Blake instantly when he saw her knew who it was and introduced her to the fellow coaches on the show.\n\nPersonally, I've always loved \"Break Down Here\". I thought it was truly a much bigger hit than only getting to #18.\n\nBillboard Hot Country Chart - September 11, 2004\n\n1. Girls Lie Too - Terri Clark\n\n2.

In today's environment, with slower-than-snails-paced chart climbs and what at times seems like an \"everybody gets a trophy\" mentality, I would not consider such a song to be a hit. Years ago, when chart climbs were faster and more songs peaked lower, I would. Even back then I don't think I'd consider a song that peaked at #39 for one week to be a hit, but if a song spent a few weeks in the Top 40 and peaked in the 20's I'd at least consider it to be a moderate hit, although not a smash.\n\nHere are a couple more:\n\n4 Runner was a quartet founded in 1993. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1995. The lead single, Cain's Blood, peaked at #26. They had five more chart singles, but none of them even made the Top 50. To give credit where credit is due I didn't think of this one myself. It was included in Ten Pound Hammer's feature on Roughstock a few years ago that was referenced in this thread's OP.\n\nJohn & Audrey Wiggins were a brother-and-sister duo. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1994. The lead single, Falling Out of Love, peaked at #47. The follow-up, Has Anybody Seen Amy, climbed to #22. Two subsequent chart singles (one from the debut album and one from their second and final album) fell short of the Top 40. (To TAKE credit where credit is due, I DID think of this one myself. ).\n\nPost by sabre14 on\n\nMost of these are great songs and some all-time favorites but can singles that never reached the top 30, let alone 20, be considered hits?\n\nThat's a question where I believe reasonable people can have different opinions.

However, you could also say a song that rose up quickly only to peter out in top 30 isn't as easily remembered and only lasted so long on the radio conscious, therefore, isn't really a hit either. There's definitely levels of hit. A top 10 is certainly a threshold that most casual fans consider a hit, and top 15-20 sees enough airplay where people can remember those. Top 30 or top 40 is really pushing it though, if you ask me. Like you mentioned, we have different opinions on this but songs like \"If You Want Some\" (peaked at #32 on Mediabase), aren't really hits to me, rather the opposite, songs that maybe should have been hits.\n\nThat all being said, I love most of the artists mentioned. Steve Azar is largely considered a one-hit wonder by most fans for his #2 peaking \"I Don't Have To Be Me (Til Monday)\" in 2002, even though he followed that up with a top 30 (the criminally neglected \"Waitin' On Joe\") and die-hard Country fans know of Steve and his history at radio...even getting another top 30 in 2010 with \"Sunshine.\" Mark McGuinn in 2001 had a top 10 with \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\", but had a top 25 and a top 30 hit after that. Those were considered moderate hits, but if asked to most fans, they probably agree McGuinn was a one-hit wonder. It's probably unfair to ask Pulse posters, because we seem to be one of the exceptions, and know about any and all radio singles over the years lol.\n\nOne that is a one-hit wonder is Tommy Shane Steiner with his #2 Billboard, #3 R&R hit \"What If She's An Angel\" from 2002. His next two singles failed to make the top 40 and he left Sony Music, never to be heard from again at radio.\n\nPost by classiccountryfan on\n\nI agree that peak chart position is just one factor in determining whether a song is a hit or how big of a hit it is. For example, due to it's lingering popularity as a memorial song, I consider Vince Gill's Go Rest High On That Mountain to be a much bigger hit than it's peak chart position (#14) would suggest. Similarly, due to it's renewed popularity following the 9/11 attacks and it becoming a patriotic standard, I consider God Bless the USA to be by far Lee Greenwood's biggest hit, even though he had several other songs exceed its #7 peak. I also agree with the idea that an artist can be a one-hit wonder even if they have more than one Top 40 appearance. You mention a few examples of that and Ten Pound Hammer also did in his Roughstock feature a few years ago (Ty England and Kellie Coffee, for example). An example from pop music a few decades ago is Exile (they were a pop act before reinventing themselves as a country band). Kiss You All Over spent 4 weeks at #1 on the Hot 100 in 1978. Their follow-up, You Thrill Me, peaked at #40. None of their other pop singles even came close to the Top 40. I very much consider them to be a one-hit wonder in terms of pop success even though they don't meet the criterion of one and only one Top 40 appearance. To me a one-hit wonder is an artist that has one song that substantially bigger than any of their other songs. That makes it a matter of opinion rather than objective fact, but I see nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think it would be boring if everybody looked at it the same.\n\nPost by onebuffalo on\n\nBruce Hornsby came out of nowhere to score his only top 40 country hit in 1987 with Mandolin Rain. He released his debut album, The Way It Is in 1986. Lead single, Every Little Kiss bombed at #72 pop and #37 adult contemporary. The title track gave him a big hit when it topped both pop and A.C. charts. His third single, On The Western Skyline did not chart in pop or A.C.. Mandolin Rain, the fourth single was released in January, 1987. That reached #4 pop and became his second chart topper at A.C.. As a surprise, it dented the top 40 at country when it peaked at #38 in April. He decided to rerelease his first single and had much better success with it the second time (#14 pop and #3 A.C.). To this day, I still remember WYRK playing Mandolin Rain quite a lot.\n\nBILLBOARD #31 - #40 FOR WEEK ENDING APRIL 18, 1987:\n\n31. You're Never Too Old For Young Love-Eddy Raven-RCA\n\n32.

I'd even buy blank cassettes to record a song that I loved from the charts. Somewhere I still have these cassettes which are not labeled so it would be interesting someday to find them and listen to what I recorded back then. To me when I listened to Bob Kingsley he personally made each of those songs he played feel like a hit single whether it peaked in the top 10 or in the 30's. I don't get to listen to Bob at all anymore due to my hectic work schedule but here are some more one hit wonder gems I remember from listening to his show!\n\nRicky Lynn Gregg - \"If I Had A Cheatin' Heart\"\n\nRicky's only top 40 hit peaked at #32 in 1993\n\nShooter Jennings - \"4th of July\"\n\nThe son of Waylon Jennings never reached the stardom of his father but this song was a pure jam for me. \"4th of July\" peaked at #26 in 2005.\n\nRockie Lynne - \"Lipstick\"\n\nRockie took his only top 40 hit up to #29 in 2005.\n\nArcher/Park - \"Where There's Smoke\"\n\nRandy Archer and Johnny Park took their only top 40 hit to #29 in 1994\n\nFor my last selection of today I am going to pick someone that has actually had multiple top 10 hits as the lead singer for a group but he only has one top 40 hit as a solo artist.\n\nJeffrey Steele - \"Somethin' In The Water\"\n\nSongwriting legend Jeffrey Steele has gained his biggest hits as being the songwriter of more than 60 hits on the Billboard Country Airplay charts. He also was the lead singer of country group Boy Howdy who achieved 4 top 40 hits in the 90's (\"A Cowboy's Born With A Broken Heart\" #12, \"She'd Give Anything\" #4, \"They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore\" #2 & \"True To His Word\" #23). His only solo hit peaked at #33 in 2001.\n\nPost by CoJoFan on\n\nBruce Hornsby came out of nowhere to score his only top 40 country hit in 1987 with Mandolin Rain.

He released his debut album, The Way It Is in 1986. Lead single, Every Little Kiss bombed at #72 pop and #37 adult contemporary. The title track gave him a big hit when it topped both pop and A.C. charts. His third single, On The Western Skyline did not chart in pop or A.C..

To this day, I still remember WYRK playing Mandolin Rain quite a lot.\n\nI wasn't even thinking about pop stars who crossed over with one country hit, but Bob Seger is another such example. His 1982 hit Shame on the Moon (written by Rodney Crowell) reached #2 pop, #1 AC, and #15 country. His only other country chart appearance was Wait for Me (#52 in 2006).\n\nShooter Jennings - \"4th of July\"\n\nThe son of Waylon Jennings never reached the stardom of his father but this song was a pure jam for me. \"4th of July\" peaked at #26 in 2005.\n\nThis is the song I teased in an earlier post that I'd post next Wednesday if nobody else thought of it first (the hint was that next Wednesday is the 4th of July). Not only is it Shooter's only Top 40 song, it's his only song to chart at all. The album version (which is what the posted video is) has a cameo by George Jones singing the chorus of He Stopped Loving Her Today. That was omitted from the radio edit, but George still received chart credit for the song.\n\nPost by CoJoFan on\n\nShane McAnally - \"Are Your Eyes Still Blue\"\n\nShane peaked at #31 with his only top 40 country single. Today Shane is one of the more well known songwriters in Nashville. He's wrote hits for artists such as Sam Hunt, Kenny Chesney, Reba McEntire, Jake Owen, Luke Bryan, and Thomas Rhett just to name a few.\n\nSadly I can't find a video for this song!\n\nAaron Neville - \"The Grand Tour\"\n\nIn 1993 Aaron Neville took this cover of George Jones\" hit to #38 on the country charts.\n\nBilly Yates - \"Flowers\"\n\nIn 1997, Billy Yates took his only top 40 single to #36. Chris Young later covered this on his debut album but never released it as a single.\n\nMumford & Sons - \"I Will Wait\"\n\nIn 2013 alternative rock band Mumford & Sons took this crossover hit to #37.\n\nHot Apple Pie - \"Hillbillies\"\n\nBrady Seals, formerly from country group Little Texas in the 90's, took his new group Hot Apple Pie's only top 40 hit to #26.\n\nBrady Seals - \"Another You, Another Me\"\n\nI figured since we were talking about Brady Seals I'd throw in his only solo hit as well! This peaked at #32 in 1996.\n\nPost by classiccountryfan on\n\nI remember that, when I Will Wait was on the airplay chart, there was a fair amount of discussion here of the fact that Billboard determined that it was ineligible for the country songs chart despite it's receiving enough airplay to reach the Top 40. If memory serves me correctly it would have been #1 on country songs had it been eligible because it would have ranked higher than any other country song on the Hot 100.\n\nBrady Seals is part of a famous musical family. He's the cousin of pop singer Jimmy Seals (Seals & Crofts) and late country singers Dan Seals and Johnny Duncan. He's also the nephew of singer/songwriter Troy Seals. While on the topic of former Little Texas members his co-lead singer Tim Rushlow had a similar career pattern. After leaving Little Texas Tim released a self-titled album on Atlantic in 2001. The second single, She Misses Him, reached #8 on the country chart. Three other singles from the album charted short of the Top 40. After Atlantic closed its country division he formed a six-member band called Rushlow, which released one album for Lyric Street in 2003. The album yielded the single I Can't Be Your Friend, which reached #16, and one other single that fell short of the Top 40. He then formed a duo with his cousin Doni Harris (who was a member of Rushlow). The duo, named Rushlow Harris, signed with Toby Keith's Showdog Nashville label. They released two singles in 2006, both of which missed the Top 40, but no album."
