        "text": "Mac Gayden grew up fascinated by the R&B acts he heard in his hometown of Nashville. That interest helped him develop a style as a guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter distinctly different from other Nashville studio pros.\n\nMost notably, Gayden became known for playing slide guitar through a wah-wah pedal, as heard on J.J. Cale’s memorable “Crazy Mama.” Gayden’s slide playing drew him work in all genres of popular music.\n\nHis songwriting also had a R&B bent. He co-wrote Robert Knight’s 1967 hit, “Everlasting Love,” with Buzz Cason; new versions of the song made it a hit again in four consecutive decades. Gayden also co-wrote “She Shot a Hole in My Soul,” a Clifford Curry favorite subsequently recorded by the Box Tops and other acts.\n\nBesides Cale, Gayden recorded with soul singer Gene Allison and singer-songwriters Bob Dylan, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Steve Young. Gayden’s guitar lent a bluesy touch to recordings by Bobby Bare, Tompall Glaser, Kris Kristofferson, and Gary Stewart.\n\nGayden also participated in the acclaimed bands Area Code 615 and Barefoot Jerry, and he led his own band, Skyboat."
