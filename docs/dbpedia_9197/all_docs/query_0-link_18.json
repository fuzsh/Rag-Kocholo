        "text": "I was listening to Bobby Pinson’s song “The Shave” last night, and it got me thinking about the ideas of circularity, repetition, and the ways humans seek immortality.\n\nIn the first verse of the song, the speaker reminisces about his dad teaching him to shave when he was a young teenager. The second verse describes the speaker giving a similar lesson to his own son, and in the final verse, the speaker helps his elderly father shave. It’s a bittersweet moment, as it’s heavily implied that the speaker’s father is dying, but the sadness is tempered by the assumption that the speaker’s son will one day continue the cycle with a child of his own.\n\nIt occurred to me that this kind of scenario satisfies our craving for immortality: Our parents give us experiences, which we then share with our own children, and there’s a reassurance in knowing that the cycle will continue indefinitely, generation after generation.\n\nI was thinking about that as I was reflecting on the lesson I had planned for today.\n\nMy sixth-graders have been learning to add and subtract multi-digit decimals, and I decided to give them some practice by handing out mock bank statements and erroneous checkbook registers for them to reconcile. I drew inspiration for this activity from a much more elaborate jobs-and-banking unit that the sixth-grade teacher at my elementary school, Mr. Will, used to do with his students every year.\n\nMr. Will was one of at least a half-dozen childless teachers in my hometown who poured their time and energy into their classrooms, to my immense benefit. Four decades later, their fingerprints are all over my classroom.\n\nWe don’t have any bittersweet Bobby Pinson-style stories about teaching our own children practical skills we learned from our parents. But we’re rolling along in our own circles, influenced by the teachers who preceded us and influencing students who will grow up to be teachers themselves. A generation or two from now, our names will be forgotten, but the best of us — our most creative ideas, our most useful lessons, our most compassionate moments — will continue in some form, woven into younger teachers’ lesson plans, layered and embellished with the highlights of a dozen other careers, expanding geometrically to benefit thousands of kids we’ll never know.\n\nIt’s not quite eternity, but you can see it from here.\n\nEmily\n\nThe good news is that I’m back at school and am more or less back to my routine.\n\nThe better news is that I didn’t bother writing lesson plans this week, figuring that I’d probably have to redo everything I’d planned for last week anyway, and — true to form — the lessons I’ve thrown together on the fly, with zero planning and zero thought for differentiation, have been some of the best of the entire year. This happens at some point every spring, and it always leaves me wondering why I bother planning lessons all year long when I obviously get better results by just making sh*t up on the fly. This week’s highlights:\n\nA kid who was learning to tell time and count money in November walked into my class yesterday — when I had forgotten to differentiate anything — and proceeded to cross-multiply and solve for x without batting an eye. Today, the same kid explained that lesson to somebody who was absent yesterday.\n\nMy eighth-graders blew through two days’ worth of lessons in a single class period. It’s like somebody threw a switch, and they suddenly understand math.\n\nMy seventh-graders, who typically have the attention span of fruit flies and the maturity of a toddler on trucker speed, are showing a remarkable level of focus as we work on percentage problems. (I suspect this is because I explained how loans work, and they are now mad as hell about the entire concept of banks charging interest. They are taking this as a personal affront, and several of them discussed it among themselves and arrived at the conclusion that there is absolutely no difference between compound interest and a pyramid scheme. This is obviously a major career highlight for me.)\n\nMy sixth-graders coasted through their lessons on adding and subtracting decimals and are going to spend tomorrow teaming up and competing to see who can successfully reconcile a checkbook register the fastest.\n\nThe bad news is that I am still outrageously tired. It’s not quite the level of exhaustion I had to deal with the first time I had COVID, but it’s definitely approaching first-week-of-school tired — the kind of tired where you get through your day and get home and immediately collapse in a heap an wonder how you made it all the way through the day without crashing.\n\nI’m hoping I’ll get a chance to catch up on sleep this weekend, because next week will be our last week before spring break, and then I’ll have a solid week of absolute madness as I foster and train a litter of rat terrier puppies. (God help us all. Ratties. And all of them look like Scout at that age. This will either be the best or the worst week of my entire life. Possibly both. My saving grace is that we are beyond maxed out on dogs at the moment, so there is no chance of these little jokers becoming permanent residents, probably.)\n\nEmily\n\nY’all know two of the things I love most are circular plotlines and Celtic mythology. This week, I got both in one little victory.\n\nMy boss was a teacher in my district before being chosen by my colleagues to be our principal. During a recent faculty meeting, she mentioned that she needed to start observing us for our annual evaluations, and she was hoping to get all of those done before spring break. I had my bullet journal with me and had already roughed in my plans for this week, so I showed her what I had in mind and let her pick the lesson she thought would be the most fun to observe. She chose the hands-on lesson I’d planned for yesterday for my sixth-graders, who are learning about surface area and volume.\n\nI frequently shake while being observed, because the very first evaluation of my career was an unmitigated disaster, and being observed takes me right back to that wretched day.\n\nI didn’t shake yesterday. Was it confidence? Faith in my current principal’s fairness? All that EMDR therapy I did last year for a couple of other hangups? Did I just run out of damns to give?\n\nIt could have been any or all of that, but it occurred to me this evening that there was another factor at play: timing.\n\nMy catastrophic evaluation back in 1997 was based on a surprise observation conducted on Halloween. This week’s evaluation was based on a scheduled observation conducted yesterday morning — which just happened to be St. Brigid’s Day.\n\nOn that Halloween (Samhain) 27 years ago, I was a rookie teacher, and my evaluator was a veteran administrator. On this St. Brigid’s Day (Imbolc), I was a veteran teacher, and my evaluator was a newly minted administrator. I’m not 100% sure, but I think my evaluation this week was her first as principal. My master’s thesis revolved around Celtic folklore, so I’m thinking maybe my subsconscious picked up on the significance of the dates and the role reversal and decided that combination closed the circle well enough to let me roll forward and tell my unresolved Riverview trauma to póg mo thóin.\n\nEmily\n\nAs I mentioned a few days ago, I switched schools in August. I’m teaching middle-school math these days, which is obviously exactly what you would expect me to do with a master’s degree in English. (I know. I make no sense. It’s fine.)\n\nI’ve never seen anybody fail math due to a true lack of ability, but I’ve known a lot of people who struggled with math because they were afraid of it, so during the interview for my current job, I got permission to repaint my classroom and decorate it in a way that encouraged kids to relax. My goal was to recapture the vibe of the late, great Nature Company, mixed with the late, great Hillside Nursery, the long-gone houseplant store at University Mall (the name of which escapes me at the moment), and a dash or two of the Makanda Boardwalk. Everything in the room is curated to promote learning and a sense of calm.\n\nI think I nailed it:\n\nMy students’ final exam for the first semester was a portfolio of their work, including a reflective essay about their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where they felt they had improved in math over the course of the semester, and one student specifically mentioned the relaxing classroom environment as something that had helped him do better this year: Even if he knew we would be working on something difficult, he looked forward to coming into my room, because it felt comfortable and soothing.\n\nI feel the same way. I spend a lot of hours in that classroom every week, and it’s nice to walk into a sensory-friendly space where I can decompress, even when I’m racing deadlines or scrambling to differentiate instruction for a group of kids whose skill levels can span nine or ten years in a single class. I don’t think I could do what I do if my classroom felt sterile and cold.\n\nBy the way, the flawed ceramic blocks you see in the first video are part of the vibe: I chose them specifically to remind the kids that mistakes happen, but that’s OK — desirable, even — because we learn by trying stuff, screwing it up, and then fixing it. (I grade math papers the same way I grade English papers: I mark them up, kick them back to the kids with grades on them, and then encourage the students to redo the work for a higher score. This approach works just as well for fractions, integers, and multi-step equations as it does for narrative essays.)\n\nI’m still getting the hang of teaching math to middle schoolers, but I’m enjoying it, and I’m excited to see what the new semester brings as the kids return to class tomorrow.\n\nEmily\n\nI’m tired, but I think I’m finally ready for the new semester.\n\nLast fall was rough. Rather than go into all the details, I’ll sum up the low points:\n\nThanks to ineptitude on the part of some folks in Santa Fe, I didn’t find out what classes I would be teaching until a week before school started — whereupon I learned I would have seven preps, including two I’d never taught before.\n\nRemote learning was a virtual hellscape of buggy software, lost passwords, and tech access issues that persisted much farther into the semester than they should have.\n\nWe returned to in-person learning for about a month, from early October to early November, before somebody in our building caught COVID-19 and managed to share it with me. I realize how fortunate I was to have only a “mild” case, but it was still unpleasant, and the brain fog and fatigue lingered long enough to make the last month of my first semester of grad school unnecessarily difficult. I still managed to pull out a 4.0 GPA, but it was a near thing, and it wouldn’t have been if I’d been healthy.\n\nBeing sick and exhausted and busy with grad school meant I didn’t keep up with housework the way I normally would.\n\nBy the time I got to the end of the semester, I was exhausted and frustrated and overwhelmed. Last week, I took the bull by the horns and did myself three favors: I cleaned, decluttered, and reorganized my kitchen and office during a three-day period beginning Christmas Eve; I got on the FlyLady website and started re-establishing the habits that I’d learned there 20 years ago and hadn’t needed in several years; and I started a new bullet journal using a cheap dot-grid journal I found at the dollar store last fall but hadn’t had time to set up.\n\nTonight, I have a shiny sink, a set of lesson plans (and most of the ancillary materials) ready to go in Google Classroom — which I spent several hours taking self-paced classes to learn over break — and a glass of sangria in hand. This is the calm before the storm of another semester, but the point here is that it’s calm, if only for a few more hours. That’s something I haven’t experienced in a while, and I’ll savor it while I can.\n\nEmily\n\nI have now made it through my first week of grad school.\n\nTwo of my classes met this week; the third will start Monday night. I loathe the textbook for my research-methods class, but I like the professor, who has been very sweet and patient as I ease back into academia after a 23-year hiatus, so there’s that. Sadly, the textbook is a compendium of essays by writers who are, to borrow a phrase from my late eighth-grade lit teacher, “inebriated by [their] own verbosity.”\n\nI’m fluent in several dialects of bullshit, including Late-20th-Century Professoric, High Mansplainish, and Old and Middle Educatorese, but this is the first time I’ve encountered Linguistics Philosopherian, which is basically self-important word salad. I finally figured out that the trick was to take notes on the essays first, then go back through my notebook and take notes on my notes. That second layer of note-taking yielded enough comprehensible material to use as the basis for my reading-response assignment; from there, I just had to translate the notes into Modern Professoric to crank out a decent paper. It’s only worth 20 points, and I managed to work in references to Keith Richards and the Infinite Monkey Theorem, so it’s fine, probably.\n\nThus far, I’m enjoying my Brit-lit class. The professor’s teaching style reminds me of my own, and the class is a mix of grad students and undergrads, so I basically sat around shooting the bull about King Arthur with a bunch of bright kids. The writing assignment for this week just involved reading something and then getting on the class discussion board and posting a 250-word response to the professor’s question. I was the first one to respond, so I’m not sure whether I hit the tone he was looking for, but hopefully he’ll let me know if I screwed it up so I can try again before Wednesday.\n\nI have a couple of short stories to read before my fiction-writing class meets Monday, but I am otherwise finished with my homework, which is good, because I need to do some serious lesson planning this weekend, and Ramona could use a long walk and a romp around the park.\n\nEmily\n\nCan we just talk for a moment about the absolute ridiculousness of online education?\n\nEverything sucks about the software I am required to use to teach my core classes, but I have to use it because we are standardizing everything to make it easier to switch back and forth in case we go back to school and then get sent home again a week later. I am not pleased, but I am less worried about this than my colleagues, because I have already accepted as given that A.) my kids are going to be about a year behind by the time we get back to normal, and B.) it doesn’t matter, because I routinely close much bigger gaps than that. (That’s not bragging; it’s just a function of spending part of the No Child Left Behind era teaching in an overcrowded Title I school in Oklahoma, where teachers were the wingnut politicians’ favorite scapegoats.)\n\nOur mandatory software does not have any automated journalism classes, and my district is all excited about Google Classroom, so I had to set up a new Google account and log into Chrome with it to set up a virtual newsroom. Teachers do not have school-issued laptops, which means I have to do this on my own computer. The problem, of course, is that Chrome is my primary browser, and I use it to research and write my novel. When I am logged into my school Google account, somebody at the regional ed office in Portales can monitor everything I do. On my own computer. At home. Outside of school hours.\n\nI will NOT be offended if somebody starts a betting pool on how long it takes before I am called into the superintendent’s office to be interrogated about my interest in obscene 12th-century grotesques because I forgot to switch accounts before typing “sheela-na-gig” into my search bar. Anybody who thinks it will take more than a week is probably an incurable optimist.\n\nMeanwhile, ENMU has standardized exactly nothing, so two professors are Zooming their classes, while a third is using Microsoft Teams, and while two of them seem content to email information to students, another is communicating almost exclusively through Blackboard.\n\nAnd people wonder why my retirement plan is to go off the grid and stay there. Yeesh.\n\nEmily\n\nHere are things I am doing at the moment:\n\n1. Getting ready for the first day of school. The jury is still out on whether this will happen from my office or from my classroom, but either way, I have to learn Google Classroom and digitize (read: rebuild from scratch, using the mandatory prefabbed software) my entire curriculum as soon as I find out what I’m teaching. Which I still don’t know, because my boss asked NMPED a question May 20 and didn’t get an answer until Tuesday night, after calling umpteen people and bugging hell out of them until they deigned to respond. I am not surprised; I’ve dealt with our state bureaucracy before. I realize the pandemic creates uncertainty, but our question was unrelated to that, and if they didn’t know the answer and didn’t have time to research it, they should have just said, “We’re not sure; hold off this year, and we’ll send this up the food chain and get you an answer next spring” instead of keeping us in limbo all summer. I really needed enough lead time to do some advance planning this year, because I am also …\n\n2. Taking three grad-level classes. In a moment of weakness last summer, I let my boss talk me into enrolling in grad school. We’ll see how well I can juggle a full-time master’s program and a full-time teaching gig, all while …\n\n3. Fostering a four-legged abuse victim. Shelters aren’t great places to work through PTSD, so Fionn the Chiweenie is now curled up under my desk, giving my feet a wary look. We’re pretty sure somebody kicked him hard enough to break a couple of ribs.* Riggy and Walter politely welcomed him to the pack, Tootsie is ignoring him, and Ramona reallyreallyreallyreallyREALLY wants to make friends and can’t figure out why he keeps snapping at her. (She will win him over. She wins everybody over. She is the consummate Hufflepuff.)\n\nEmily\n\n* Dog abuser, if you’re reading this, please understand that “Fought a descendant of Boudicca” sounds much more impressive than “Kicked a 15-lb. Chiweenie,” and I would be DELIGHTED to help you upgrade that line on your resume. You’re welcome. Happy to help.\n\nThings I can put in the win column this week:\n\n1. My sophomores did a writing and peer-editing assignment using the End-of-Course exam rubric and a form I made for them. Their essays were solid, and their critiques were even better.\n\n2. The child I am teaching to read has gained at least two grade levels since August. I intend to double that by May.\n\n3. My journalism students are finally getting the hang of proofreading. I awarded bonus points to three kids today for making good catches — two for content issues (an incorrect name in a cutline and two jumps that didn’t match) and one for a design issue of the sort I’ve seen veteran copy editors overlook.\n\n4. I came up with a project today that will — if it goes according to plan — resolve a conflict with a colleague, provide some multidisciplinary collaboration, and give a student a good shot at winning a statewide journalism award and several FFA competitions next year.\n\nI’m tired and ready to spend a little quality time with my fictional banshees this weekend, but it’s been a good week.\n\nEmily"
