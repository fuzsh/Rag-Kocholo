        "text": "Local singer-songwriter Ryn Palmer Crider has been named Georgia’s Female Country Artist of the Year by the GA Music Awards.\n\nRyn accepted the award Saturday, June 11 during the GA Music Awards ceremony in Macon at the Grand Opera House.\n\n“It has been a crazy roller coaster of learning experiences, hard work and true joy,” said Crider. “I’m grateful for the opportunities up until this point and I’m excited for what’s to come. Knowing that my plans are rooted in the prayer ‘Thy Will be done,’ and with the support of all the communities, fans, my family and the musicians I’ve had the pleasure of working with, along with the promotional support of Susanne Reynolds and McAlpin Entertainment—I feel I am an extremely blessed woman.”\n\nThe Blakely native is the daughter of Jay and Amy Palmer and granddaughter of Tommy Palmer of Statesboro. She is a 2005 graduate of Early County High.\n\nSince Crider’s musical career began, she has shared the stage with Rhett Atkins, LoCash Cowboys, Bobby Pinson, Daryl Singletary, The Atlanta Rhythm Section and many more.\n\nCurrently, Crider is the lead singer for the country, southern rock band, Dry Weather Sun.\n\nComing from a family filled with musicians and radio personalities, Crider was exposed to music at an early age and began performing at the age of five. Since that time, she always dreamed of growing up to be a singer.\n\nHer influences included artists such as Prince, Etta James, Fleetwood Mac; Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire, and Otis Redding laid the foundation for her love of the funk and soul music. Bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes and Stevie Ray Vaughan were the seeds that planted her rock and roll roots. Since she was born and raised in a small rural town in Southwest Georgia, classic country music was also, a part of her everyday life.\n\nSince 2011, The GA Music Awards has recognized Georgia artists in Rock, Hip Hop, Country, R&B and more since 2011."
