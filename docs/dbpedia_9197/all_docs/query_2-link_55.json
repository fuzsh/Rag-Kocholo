        "text": "Upon graduation from Middle Tennessee State University and armed with a degree in Recording Industry Management, Tim started his own record label, Rhythm and Grooves Records. The label had strong initial success with a hit video on BET and a charted single on the Billboard charts. Ultimately, Hunze sold his interest in the company. In 1993 Tim then took at job as archive manger at Great Cumberland Music Group (later renamed Hamstein Music). After a year as archive manager, Tim garnered his first cut with Giant Records artist Clay Walker. This cut turn into Tim’s first single that peaked at #14 on Billboard’s country music chart. Hunze was promoted to creative director in 1995 and procured cuts with artists such as Tim McGraw, George Strait, Sugarland, John Michael Montgomery, Rascal Flatts and Kenny Chesney. In 2000, Hamstein sold to Mosaic Music group and then in 2005 sold to Stage Three Music Group. Tim was appointed the General Manger. Under Hunze’s tenure, Stage Three Music Group had over 15 #1s including Jason Aldean’s “The Truth,” Sugarland’s’ “Want To,” “Already Gone,” and “It Happens,” Carrie Underwood’s “Cowboy Casanova” and Kenny Chesney’s “Out Last Night.” Stage Three Writer Bobby Pinson won the 2009 BMI Songwriter of The Year award and writer Brett James won the 2010 ASCAP writer of the year. In July of 2011 Hunze started Parallel Music Publishing, a partnership with JP Williams of Parallel Entertainment. In their first five years they scored five #1 singles including “Mama’s Broken Heart” by Miranda Lambert, “Better Dig Two” by The Band Perry and “Love Me Like You Mean It” by Kelsea Ballerini. In December of 2018, JP and Hunze sold Parallel to Anthem Entertainment Group (formerly ole), with Hunze running Anthem’s creative team in Nashville. Under Hunze’s leadership, Anthem had multiple number 1s including Jordan Davis’ “Take It from Me\" and “Slow Dancing In A Parking Lot,” and Chris Janson’s “Good Vibes,” and “Done.” In spring 2021, Hunze joined Big Machine Music as a VP of Publishing."
