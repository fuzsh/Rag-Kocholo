        "text": "Barrett Baber has signed a publishing deal with Sea Gayle Music.\n\nBaber gained national recognition as a finalist on Season 9 of NBC’s The Voice, logging weekly top 10 iTunes performances and a No. 1 Billboard single with his reinvented cover of the country classic “I’d Love To Lay You Down.” He later released a full-length album A Room Full Of Fighters, which debuted in the top 10 on the iTunes Top 100 Album Charts.\n\nBaber has also been writing with respected songwriters including Bobby Pinson, who immediately saw something special in Baber’s writing and knew something had to be done. “Barrett Baber lights up a room as a person and I’m excited to watch him do the same thing with his music for years to come,” Pinson said.\n\n“Barrett’s writing ability along with his drive and passion made this a no brainer for us,” Sea Gayle Music’s Kim Wiggins adds. “We are beyond thrilled to be partnering with Bobby Pinson on this deal and look forward to sharing success together.”\n\n“There are opportunities, and there are once in a lifetime opportunities,” said Baber. “It’s certainly not lost on me which one this is. I’m thrilled to have the chance to work closely with a legendary publishing company like Sea Gayle in partnership with an equally legendary songwriter in Bobby Pinson. I’m so excited and grateful for the chance to continue the development of my craft with the guidance of such a wonderful team of people, at a place that feels like home.”"
