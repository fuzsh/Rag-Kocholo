        "text": "Ashley McBryde has released a new song from her upcoming album called “The Devil I Know,” written by McBryde with Jeremy Stover and Bobby Pinson.\n\nMcBryde took to social media to announce the new track: “I walked in and sat down with Bobby Pinson and Jeremy Stover August 12, 2020, and THIS song came out … We’re all the time hearing somethin’ from somebody who thinks they know what’s best for us. Lose weight, your hair’s too curly, change this, change that. When things just seem to go better when you trust your own lens to see what’s good for you. Stick to the devil you know.”\n\nAshley McBryde started 2023 with her first-ever Grammy win — Ashley’s duet with Carly Pearce, “Never Wanted to Be That Girl” took home the trophy for Best Country Duo/Group Performance. Shortly after, McBryde and her Lindeville collaborators took their character-driven album to the Ryman Auditorium for a special two-night performance.\n\nTake a listen to “The Devil I Know” – here.\n\nAshley McBryde Sticks to Her Vices in “The Devil I Know”\n\nEditorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com"
