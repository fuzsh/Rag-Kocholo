Here are some of the songs that are worth a listen, along with links to the accompanying videos:\n\nBig & Rich: “Stay Home”\n\nIn the official video, John Rich sits by the guitar-shaped pool at his Mt. Richmore home (carefully-placed bottles of Granny Rich Whiskey on the table beside him!) and is joined remotely by Big Kenny with fun lyrics such as:\n\nThe shelves are bare and empty / Because some people just don’t care / Got one roll of toilet paper / And I’m down to my last square\n\nThomas Rhett: “Be A Light” ft. Keith Urban, Chris Tomlin, Reba McEntire, Hillary Scott\n\nA sweet and inspiring song encouraging us all to take the opportunity to do what’s right for ourselves and each other.\n\nIn a world full of hate, be a light / When you do somebody wrong, make it right / Don’t hide in the dark, you were born to shine / In a world full of hate, be a light\n\nHere’s Thomas singing an acoustic solo version of the song while self-isolating.\n\nContinue reading “Covid-19 lockdown inspires country artists”\n\nJanuary 2019 column now posted at Nashville Music Guide\n\nMy column “Inside Track on Music Row” is the longest continually-published monthly Country music column in the USA.

Tickets are now available at ticketmaster.com. “When you see first-hand what this organization can do for families, it’s remarkable,” Rucker reflects. “Over the years we’ve met so many survivors, families of patients and volunteers whose lives have been changed by St. Jude. It’s one of my favorite shows of the year.”\n\nTickets start at $50 for General Admission and go up to $150 for VIP options.

In fact, Ray first began singing and performing in his grandfather’s band when he was only nine years old. To this day he still plays Amos’ hand-me-down guitar, a 1978 Les Paul, as a reminder of the time they spent together sharing stories, learning songs and making memories.\n\nAMOS features 11 tracks including Ray’s current top 20 and climbing single, “Get To You.” More at MichaelRayMusic.com.\n\nThomas Rhett’s autobiographical anthem “Life Changes,” the title-track from his Billboard 200 chart-topping album (The Valory Music Co.), is his new single.

It follows all three of LIFE CHANGES’ singles – PLATINUM-certified “Craving You” and “Marry Me” as well as GOLD-certified “Unforgettable” – that earned chart-topping success.\n\n“This song is basically my autobiography in three minutes,” Thomas Rhett said. “It covers my college years, marrying Lauren, becoming a dad and the evolution of my music career. It’s definitely the most personal song I’ve ever written, but we all go through a lot in life whatever the story is, so I think the sentiment is something a lot of people can relate to.”\n\nRhett has also released LEAVE RIGHT NOW: THE REMIXES, delivering fresh takes on the EDM-flavored track from his LIFE CHANGES album. The collection features a reimagined version of the song from PLATINUM-selling DJ Martin Jensen, who brings a new dimension to “Leave Right Now” by combining Thomas Rhett’s soulful vocals with his own trademark sound.
