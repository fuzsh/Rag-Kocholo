        "text": "Nashville, Tenn. (February 29, 2024) – Multi-platinum selling Country artist Aaron Lewis has another hit song on his hands. “Made In China,” released last Friday, quickly soared up the iTunes Country Chart, peaking at the No. 4 position. Additionally, the song jumped to No. 11 on the All Genres Chart.\n\n“A song about truth and consequences, America, our core values and most importantly, what’s been stolen from us, sat in the Top 5,” says Lewis. “A song that tells the story of the American worker whose dream was stolen from him had a minute to speak to millions. It climbed up and shined like a beacon from the hilltop, showing the truth still matters. In the pursuit of truth, I would consider this a victory.”\n\nWATCH THE “MADE IN CHINA” LYRIC VIDEO\n\n“Made In China” is the second track to release from Lewis’ upcoming country album THE HILL, out March 29 via The Valory Music Co. Less tongue-in-cheek and more on-the-nose, “Made In China” (written by Lewis and Bobby Pinson) offers the loud-and-proud declaration that some things (like Lewis) are still made in the USA. With a dusky dose of down-tuned acoustic balladry, Lewis tributes a brash sense of patriotic pride, built to last and not ashamed to say so.\n\nPRE-ORDER THE HILL ALBUM HERE\n\nThe Vermont-born powerhouse first found success with Staind – the 2000s-era hard rockers who injected meditative muscle into an era better known for mindless aggression. But while that band is still very much alive, it was never enough to satisfy Lewis’ creative drive. Embracing his roots to earn a rare second round of success, a series of solo Country projects have led to two No. 1 Billboard Country Album debuts – TOWN LINE (2011) and SINNER (2016) – plus a PLATINUM collab with heroes George Jones and Charlie Daniels (“Country Boy”), and a GOLD-certified Billboard No. 1 with “Am I The Only One” in 2021. Lewis’ 2022 solo album followed suit, with FRAYED AT BOTH ENDS emerging as the best-selling Country album in America, but he never wrote songs for the stats. No matter the sonic setting, Lewis writes and sings to get his truth out and THE HILL is no different.\n\nFor a full list of upcoming tour dates and more, visit: aaronlewismusic.com.\n\nTHE HILL TRACK LIST\n\n“Let’s Go Fishing” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson\n\n“Over The Hill” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson\n\n“Made In China” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson\n\n“Spinnin’” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele\n\n“Over Me” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele\n\n“Outlaw” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson\n\n“Up To Me” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson\n\n“That’s My Life” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele\n\n“Only In My Mind” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele\n\n“Little More Mine” | Written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson\n\nAbout Aaron Lewis\n\nAaron Lewis grew up in Springfield, Vermont, listening to his grandparents’ country 8-tracks. Those roots inspired the multi-platinum Staind founder to return to his origins for the #1 Billboard Country Album debuts Town Line and Sinner, as well as Billboard’s #1 Hot Country Song debut “Am I The Only One,” only the 9th time since 1958. Having recorded with George Jones, Willie Nelson, Charlie Daniels, Alison Krauss and Vince Gill, Lewis has put a traditionalist brand on his outlier country.\n\nFor more information, visit aaronlewismusic.com.\n\n# # #"
