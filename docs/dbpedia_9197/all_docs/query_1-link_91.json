        "text": "Country music veteran Eddie Montgomery returns with a new single, “Cost of Being Me,” featuring fast-rising country singer-songwriter and labelmate Bryan Martin. The single is now available for download and stream on all major streaming platforms via Average Joes Entertainment.\n\nThe collaboration of a seasoned country music icon like Eddie Montgomery and an upcoming star like Bryan Martin marks a fascinating collision of experience and fresh talent within the genre. “Cost of Being Me” delves into the rugged and sometimes tumultuous journey of life through lyrics that paint a life permeated with reckless spending, impulsive decisions, and the pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Written by Bobby Pinson (“All I Want to Do,” “It Happens,” “Made in America”), Jami Grooms, Mark McGuinn, Rusty Tabor, and produced by Nick Gibbens, the single reflects common themes of self-discovery, loss, and resilience, resonating with those who have faced the highs and lows of life.\n\nStream/Listen: averagejoesent.co/costofbeingme"
