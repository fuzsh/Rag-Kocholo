        "text": "Cornel Ronald West (born June 2, 1953) is an American philosopher, political activist, social critic, author, and public intellectual. The son of a Baptist minister, West focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their \"radical conditionedness\". A radical democrat and democratic socialist, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, Marxism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism. Among his most influential books are Race Matters (1994) and Democracy Matters (2004). West is an outspoken voice in left-wing politics in the United States, and as such has been critical of members of the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has held professorships at Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, Pepperdine University, Union Theological Seminary, and the University of Paris during his career. He is also a frequent commentator on politics and social issues in many media outlets.From 2010 through 2013, West co-hosted a radio program with Tavis Smiley, called Smiley and West. He has also been featured in several documentaries, and made appearances in Hollywood films such as The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, providing commentary for both films. West has also made several spoken word and hip hop albums, and due to his work, has been named MTV's Artist of the Week. He has also been portrayed on Saturday Night Live by Kenan Thompson.\n\nJennifer Jones (born Phylis Lee Isley; March 2, 1919 â€“ December 17, 2009), also known as Jennifer Jones Simon, was an American actress and mental health advocate. Over the course of her career that spanned over five decades, she was nominated for the Academy Award five times, including one win for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe Award win for Best Actress in a Drama. Jones is among the youngest actresses to receive an Academy Award, having won on her 25th birthday. A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Jones worked as a model in her youth before transitioning to acting, appearing in two serial films in 1939. Her third role was a lead part as Bernadette Soubirous in The Song of Bernadette (1943), which earned her the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress that year. She went on to star in several films that garnered her significant critical acclaim and a further three Academy Award nominations in the early-1940s, including Since You Went Away (1944), Love Letters (1945), and Duel in the Sun (1946) In 1949, Jones married film producer David O. Selznick, and appeared as the titular Madame Bovary in Vincente Minnelli's 1949 adaptation. She appeared in several films throughout the 1950s, including Ruby Gentry (1952), John Huston's adventure comedy Beat the Devil (1953), and Vittorio De Sica's drama Terminal Station (also 1953). Jones earned her fifth Academy Award nomination for her performance as a Eurasian doctor in Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955). After Selznick's death in 1965, Jones married industrialist Norton Simon and went into semi-retirement. She made her final film appearance in The Towering Inferno (1974). Jones suffered from mental health problems during her life and survived a 1966 suicide attempt in which she jumped from a cliff in Malibu Beach. After her own daughter committed suicide in 1976, Jones became profoundly interested in mental health education. In 1980, she founded the Jennifer Jones Simon Foundation for Mental Health and Education. She spent the remainder of her life withdrawn from the public, residing in Malibu, California, where she died in 2009, aged 90.\n\nAlfre Woodard, a venerable figure in the entertainment industry, has made significant contributions to both film and television throughout her illustrious career. Born on November 8, 1952, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Woodard embarked on an impressive journey that saw her ascend from a high school cheerleader to an Academy Award-nominated actress. A graduate of Boston University's School of Fine Arts, she gained her initial experience in theater, where she honed her skills and developed a strong foundation for her future work. Woodard's acting prowess is evident in her extensive body of work and numerous accolades. She received an Oscar nomination for her riveting performance in Martin Ritt's Cross Creek (1983). Additionally, she holds four Primetime Emmy Awards from 17 nominations, with memorable roles in Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, Miss Evers' Boys, and The Practice, among others. Moreover, Woodard has been recognized with a Golden Globe Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, testifying to her outstanding performances and universal acclaim. Beyond her accomplishments in acting, Woodard is also known for her charity work and activism. A co-founder of Artists for a New South Africa, she has actively campaigned against apartheid and worked towards advancing democracy and equality in South Africa. Her humanitarian endeavors have earned her the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights in 1999. Despite her demanding career, she has always remained dedicated to social causes, demonstrating her commitment not only to her craft but also to making a difference in the world."
