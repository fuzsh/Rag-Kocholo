        "text": "Dallas, TX – Dallas Baptist University honored Dr. Bill and Bobbie Pinson during the thirteenth annual Tom Landry Leadership Award Dinner, held on Saturday, April 6, 2019, on the DBU campus. The annual event recognizes the lasting legacy of one of North Texas’ most famous citizens, Tom Landry.\n\nJeff Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of HighGround Advisors, served as chair of the dinner and welcomed the guests in attendance, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Fred Moses, Founder, President, and CEO of Telecom Electric Supply Company, as well as a past recipient of the Landry Leadership Award. Boone Powell, Jr., Retired President of Baylor Health Care System, provided the evening’s invocation.\n\nUpon transitioning to the DBU Pilgrim Chapel after dinner, guests enjoyed a musical medley performed by the DBU Grand Chorus under the direction of Dr. Stephen Holcomb, Director of Choral Studies and Professor of Music at Dallas Baptist University.\n\nDr. Adam C. Wright, DBU President, opened the program with a word of welcome and gratitude to all in attendance, followed by a special greeting from DBU’s Chancellor Dr. Gary Cook. Dr. Dick Maples, the Former Associate Executive Director of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, shared a few remarks about the Pinsons and provided the Scripture reading for the evening.\n\nGrowing up in North Texas, the Pinsons were high school sweethearts and married during college as Dr. Pinson began a ministry career that included serving as a pastor, professor, president, and eventually head of the Baptist General Convention of Texas. Along the way, Mrs. Pinson served in a variety of support roles, ministering to the wives of pastors and denominational leaders and helping to lead retreats and women’s conferences.\n\nWhen Dr. Pinson retired in 2000, Bobbie was invited to join the DBU Board of Trustees and has continued to serve for 18 years. In recognition of her leadership and support, the DBU Women’s Auxiliary Board presented her with the Ruth Award in 1997, and in 2008, DBU presented her with an honorary doctorate. Dr. Pinson also received an honorary doctorate from DBU in 1990 while he still served at the BGCT.\n\nDr. Pinson is perhaps best known today for his work in Christian ethics, as well as his time serving as Executive Director of the BGCT for 18 years, the longest tenure for anyone in that role. He is a tireless advocate for Baptist identity, authoring several articles and pamphlets about the history and heritage of Baptist life, as well as serving as a frequent speaker on college campuses, including his yearly lecture series at DBU. Currently, Dr. Pinson is serving as Executive Director Emeritus of the BGCT, Distinguished University Professor at Dallas Baptist University, Voluntary Director (part-time) of the Texas Baptist Heritage Center, and Trustee Emeritus of the Baylor Health Care System.\n\nThe Pinsons are still members of First Baptist Church, Lancaster, where they grew up. Along with their two adult daughters, they have four grandchildren and one great grandchild.\n\nPast recipients of the Tom Landry Leadership Award include: Dr. David Moon (2018), Paul and Charla Vinyard (2017), Dr. Jim Denison (2016), Dr. Bill Tolar (2015), Gil Stricklin (2014), Tillie Burgin (2013), Fred Moses (2012), Wayne Stevenson (2011), Dr. Jeff Warren (2010), Mike Simpson (2009), Dr. Jack Graham (2008), and Congressman Sam Johnson (2007)."
