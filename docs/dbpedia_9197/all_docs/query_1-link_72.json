        "text": "Ahead of the release of Aaron Lewis’s next country album “The Hill” (out March 29 via The Valory Music Co.), the STAIND singer today drops “Made In China”, the second single from the upcoming project\n\n“Made In China” — written by Lewis and Bobby Pinson — offers the loud-and-proud declaration that some things (like Lewis) are still made in the USA. With a dusky dose of down-tuned acoustic balladry, Lewis tributes a brash sense of patriotic pride, built to last and not ashamed to say so.\n\n“Made In China” features such lyrics as “I ain’t made in China / From all the cheapest parts / I ain’t one for driving them imported foreign cars / I’m more like American muscle from 1966 / I ain’t made in China / I’m American as it gets / I ain’t made by Uyghur kids for pennies on the dollar / I’m made in the USA / It says so on my collar / Tried and true, red, white and blue / My roots run way too thick / yeah, I ain’t made in China / ‘Cause I’m American as it gets.”\n\n“The best songs come from a place of authenticity,” explains Lewis. “This one started as a conversation with friends as we picked up items around the room with ‘Made In China’ stamped on the bottom. And we put pen to paper.”\n\nAaron Lewis “The Hill” track listing:\n\n01. Let’s Go Fishing (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n02. Over The Hill (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\n03. Made In China (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n04. Spinnin’ (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n05. Over Me (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n06. Outlaw (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\n07. Up To Me (written by: Aaron Lewis, Bobby Pinson)\n\n08. That’s My Life (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n09. Only In My Mind (written by: Aaron Lewis, Ira Dean, Jeffrey Steele)\n\n10. Little More Mine (written by: Aaron Lewis, Matt McGinn, Bobby Pinson)\n\nAs a multi-platinum artist known for blazing creative trails, Aaron Lewis has never been afraid to stand on conviction. With a catalog of soul-baring hits, he’s never been one to hide behind his lyrics, either. And with his new album “The Hill”, due March 29 via The Valory Music Co., the North-Country native is unfiltered — and unplugged — in a way that leaves no room for doubt. A deeply personal set written from a lifetime of highs and lows, it pairs Lewis‘s iconic vocal rasp with a bare-bones acoustic sound, a reflective mindset and little else, as a confessional hit maker chooses the hill where he’ll make his stand.\n\nFeaturing 10 tracks penned solo or with a tight circle of collaborator/confidants, the set speaks to a time of upheaval — both in the wider world and within. Pledging to shoot his fans straight, Aaron Lewis offers up a 50-50 mix of riding out the winds of change and driving another mineshaft deep into his soul. Like his 2022 collection “Frayed At Both Ends”, Lewis delivers “The Hill” as an acoustic record, maximizing the potential for lyrical impact. Produced by Lewis alongside Ira Dean, it’s raw in the purest sense of the country-rock term — often backing his jagged-edge vocal with just a guitar, dobro and mandolin.\n\n“Music has always been my escape, my way of expressing the things that I don’t express very well in life,” Lewis explains. “I’m coming up on 52 years old, and I’m on the hill I’m going to stand on. Nobody’s going to change me now. This record is a snapshot of my life and how I’m feeling and where my head is at — and that’s what my records have always been.”\n\n“It’s another record that’s just really stripped down to the guts,” he explains. “I like raw. I like life’s imperfections showing through. I’m not perfect, nobody is. And I don’t want the music I’m putting out to be either.”\n\nRight from the opening track, those guts take center stage. An upbeat track that’s “very much not about going fishing,” “Let’s Go Fishing” finds Lewis calling out the nation’s problems — but deciding to leave them for another day. Co-written with Bobby Pinson, a mix of fed-up frustration and organic-country comfort creates an intriguing contrast — a lightly-coded protest anthem with a let-it-be theme. “I find the whole thing tongue in cheek,” Lewis admits.\n\nIn the lyrics of “Let’s Go Fishing,” 51-year-old Lewis, known for his outspoken conservative views and transition to a solo country artist in recent years, expresses sentiments about “making America great again,” advocating for turning off CNN, and incorporates the “Let’s Go, Brandon!” catchphrase. This phrase, popularized by American conservatives, serves as a veiled criticism of President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Vermont-born powerhouse first found success with STAIND — the 2000s-era hard rockers who injected meditative muscle into an era better known for mindless aggression. But while that band is still very much alive, it was never enough to satisfy Lewis‘s creative drive."
