        "text": "Don’t miss a great show tonight, Saturday, July 9th at Puckett’s Gro. & Restaurant. Scott Reeves, Keith Follese, Victoria Venier & Bobby Tomberlin perform beginning at 8:30pm. Read about all of these musicians below.\n\nScott Reeves\n\nIn 2011 Scott Reeves became a member of an elite group of songwriters when Toby Keith’s “Made In America” hit No. 1 on the Billboard county music chart. Working in collaboration with Keith and fellow songwriter Bobby Pinson, Reeves crafted a lyric line that resonated with the nation. The song garnered number one status on the county charts as well as a Top 40 position on the Billboard Hot 100, along with BMI award honors.\n\nFor Reeves, songwriting has become a passion, and performing country music has been a joy. In 2003 Scott and his good friend Aaron Benward formed the country duo, Blue County. Their collaboration quickly led to a record deal with Curb Records, followed by a self‐titled album that produced several Billboard country chart hits—“Good Little Girls” (Top 10), “That’s Cool” (written by Reeves), “Nothing But Cowboy Boots,” and “That Summer Song.” In 2004 Blue County performed at the Country Music Association music festival and the duo was nominated for a coveted CMA award. Later that same year they were also nominated for an American County Music Award. Over the next three years Blue County toured the nation, opening shows for Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, Wynonna, Keith Urban, Brooks & Dunn, and many others. Their busy schedule also included recording two tracks for the Evan Almighty motion picture soundtrack and making several appearances on the legendary Grand Ole Opry stage.\n\nIn 2008 Reeves and Benward retired Blue County to focus on independent careers. As if being an award‐winning singer/songwriter wasn’t impressive enough, Scott Reeves is also a very successful Hollywood actor. In 2009 he began a four‐year shift on General Hospital for ABC, where he played Dr. Steven Webber. Scott’s filmography also includes ten years as Ryan McNeil, a feature character on the daytime drama The Young and the Restless, as wells as roles on television series such as Chicago Hope, The King of Queens, Touched By An Angel, and Days of Our Lives.\n\nKeith Follese\n\n“The thing I love about producing and writing songs is that you wake up with nothing, but by the end of the day, you have a baby,” says Grammy-nominee Keith Follesé.\n\nThe Nashville, Tennessee-based producer and songwriter has had success in the pop,country, pop-rock, and pop-punk formats, writing timeless but contemporary-feeling hits for a diverse array of artists. He’s had #1s with Randy Travis (“Before You Kill Us All”), Little Texas (“Life Goes On”), Faith Hill (“The Way You Love Me”), Tim McGraw (“Something Like That”), Martina McBride’s (“I Love You”), and Lonestar (“Smile”).\n\nHe’s also garnered acclaim for his work with Emerson Drive, Lady Antebellum(“Looking For A Good Time”), Katy Perry, the Summer Set, John Oates, Hot Chelle Rae, Timothy Schmit, Jamie Johnson and Jo Dee Messina, among others. And, in addition to his Grammy nod, Follesé has been named both ASCAP and Billboard magazine’s “Songwriter Of The Year.”\n\nBobby Tomberlin\n\nGrammy, CMA and ACM nominee Bobby Tomberlin began his career in the music business at the early age of 11 as a disc jockey at WLVN in his hometown of Luverne, Alabama. During this time, he interviewed legends such as Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, and Keith Whitley.\n\nMel Tillis gave Bobby his first publishing contract, and he is currently a staff writer for CURB Records Publishing in Nashville, Tennessee. Bobby co-wrote the number one Country and Top 5 AC single, “One More Day” recorded by Diamond Rio, and co-authored the inspirational book by the same title. He co-wrote the Top 10 single “A Good Day To Run” with Darryl Worley, and has also had songs recorded by Josh Turner, Faith Hill, Kenny Rogers, Rodney Atkins, Joe Nichols, Terri Clark, Little Jimmy Dickens, the Oak Ridge Boys, Joe Diffie, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Anderson, Ty Herndon, Lee Greenwood, Chely Wright, Linda Davis, Russ Taff, Eddy Arnold and many others.\n\nVictoria Vanier\n\nVictoria is a multi-talented singer/songwriter and dynamic performer. Born and raised in Illinois corn-field country, she now calls Nashville home. As a vocalist, she has backed up greats like Brenda Lee, Joe Diffie, Linda Davis, Sandi Patti and BeBe Winans. She also stays in high demand as a Nashville session singer, recording demos, soundtracks and commercials. She has toured nationally as a featured performer with The Acoustic Café, Ropin’ The West and The Tennessee Waltz.\n\nAs a BMI songwriter, she was recently on the Grammy and Dove nominated project “The Standard” by Take 6, with the chart topping single “Back To You”. She was also a featured songwriter (and singer) on the critically acclaimed project “This Is My America.” Victoria has been seen as a guest on the Grand Ole Opry several times and was invited to be a featured entertainer on the Belfast/Nashville Songwriter’s Exchange where she enjoyed amazing response from the international crowds. Her independent album can be found on I-Tunes and her songs continue to garner the attention of top artists and producers."
