        "text": "Eddie Montgomery's 13-track solo debut album, “Ain’t No Closing Me Down,\" is now available digitally following the release of the physical CD last fall exclusively through Walmart. The digital deluxe version available on all streaming platforms includes one new song, “You Pissed Me All The Way Off,” written by Jim “Moose” Brown and Travis Meadows. In addition, the lyric video for \"Higher,\" a duet with country legend Tanya Tucker, is now live here.\n\nThe release of “Ain’t No Closing Me Down,” marks a milestone in Montgomery’s storied career as he “keeps the sounds and spirit of Montgomery Gentry at the forefront” (Wide Open Country)” on his solo debut album. Produced by acclaimed music producers Noah Gordon and Shannon Houchins, “Montgomery pours a lot of life and emotion into every song on the album, matching his philosophy on living life to the fullest (Billboard).” Montgomery co-wrote eight of the 13 tracks featured on the new project and performed the title track, “Ain’t No Closing Me Down,” live from Nashville on Fox News Channel’s All-American New Year’s Eve special.\n\n“With the help of some of Nashville’s best honky-tonk-flavored writers, he fashioned Ain’t No Closing Me Down, an album that is both a tribute to the past and a rowdy reach into the future (Cowboys & Indians).” Written and produced during the pandemic, “Eddie Montgomery’s debut solo album started with a garage party that never quit (Taste of Country).\"\n\nHighlights on the album include the first love song Montgomery has ever written inspired by his wife, “She Loves Me;” “Higher, “a standout duet” (Forbes) with country music icon Tanya Tucker; “My Son,” the featured theme song in the new movie, “Old Henry,” which “quickly transformed into a far more personal narrative” (People.com) when Montgomery joined Noah Gordon to co-write the song; and “Alive and Well,” “about resilience in the face of adversity (Rolling Stone).” “Love and loss, the importance of parenting, and strong values pervade the collection. (Country Standard Time).”\n\n“Ain’t No Closing Me Down” Track List:\n\n01. “Ain’t No Closing Me Down” (Eddie Montgomery, Chris Wallin, Ira Dean)\n\n02. “Alive And Well” (Eddie Montgomery, Chris Wallin, Ira Dean)\n\n03. “My Son” (Eddie Montgomery, Noah Gordon)\n\n04. “That’s The Kinda Man I Am” (Eddie Montgomery, Kim Tribble, Ira Dean)\n\n05. “Higher” f/Tanya Tucker (Jim “Moose” Brown, David Wade, Shane Grove, Erik Michael Westfall)\n\n06. “Play That Game” (Eddie Montgomery, Ira Dean, David Lee Murphey, Justin Weaver)\n\n07. “Kickin’ It Up” (Eddie Montgomery, Chris Wallin, Ira Dean)\n\n08. “She Just Loves Me” (Eddie Montgomery, Chris Wallin, Ira Dean)\n\n09. “Sounds Like A Tuesday” (Jeffrey Steele, Wyatt Durrette, Stephen Wilson)\n\n10. \"You Pissed Me All The Way Off\" (Jim “Moose” Brown, Travis Meadows)\n\n11. “Cry Whiskey” (Eddie Montgomery, Chris Wallin, Ira Dean)\n\n12. “Ain’t She Beautiful” (Walker Montgomery, Chris Rafetto, Brendan Cooney)\n\n13. \"Somewhere South\" (Tony Lane)\n\nListen/Stream: HERE\n\nEddie Montgomery Continues Montgomery Gentry Legacy With Solo Album Ain’t No Closing Me Down\n\nEddie Montgomery pays tribute to his late Montgomery Gentry bandmate, Troy Gentry, on his first solo album Ain’t No Closing Me Down. The 12-track project, available exclusively at Walmart via Average Joes Entertainment, was written and recorded during Covid-19 and is the first album that Montgomery Gentry’s band plays on. It’s also Montgomery’s first set of new music in two years.\n\nGentry died in a helicopter crash in 2017, and Montgomery says his bandmate inspired many of the songs on Ain’t No Closing Me Down and the decision to continue releasing music. The Grand Ole Opry members and Kentucky Music Hall of Famers made a promise to one another long ago to keep the Montgomery Gentry name alive.\n\n“I told T-Roy, me and him sat down [and decided] … if anything ever happens to either one of us, we said we want the other one to keep the MG brand going,” Montgomery tells me. “We both promised each other and I'm keeping my promise.”\n\nRead More HERE\n\nEddie Montgomery’s Debut Solo Album Started With a Garage Party That Never Quit\n\nEddie Montgomery invited a few friends over for beers and burgers, and before he knew it, the local golf course was using his garage as a concession stand and he was holding his debut solo album in his hand. The party, needless to say, got a bit out of control.\n\nA short equipment inventory at Eddie's Garage (oh yes, it has a name) includes every kind of grill you can think of (Little Green Egg, Big Green Egg, Blackstone griddle, etc.), several televisions, a dartboard and a disco ball.\n\nIra Dean, Jeffrey Steele and Chris Wallin were a few of his quarantine friends who'd stop by regularly, and before long, the group started putting song ideas to paper. Ain't No Closing Me Down includes a love song about \"my smokin' hot wife\" called \"She Just Loves Me\" and a song called \"My Son\" that Montgomery penned for a movie titled Old Henry. Amid all this revelry, Montgomery actually accessed deeper emotions than ever before. He'll tell you he's not very good at expressing his feelings, but this new one does more than all right.\n\nRead More on Taste of Country\n\nEddie Montgomery on the Charlie Daniels Podcast\n\nMontgomery Gentry’s sound is at the heart and soul of Eddie Montgomery’s album. The Wild Bunch, Montgomery Gentry’s band for the past 20 years, played on the recording sessions for the new album and provides both a tribute to Montgomery’s late partner, Troy Gentry, as well as a sonic bridge to carry out his legacy well into the future.\n\n“Troy is with me and will always be with me. He helped me write this album,” remarked Montgomery who wrote on eight of the 12 tracks. “I got together with some of my best songwriting buddies and we wrote about life – the good, the bad, the ugly, and the party on the weekends.”\n\nThe title track is a rock-driven, honky-tonk offering that addresses Montgomery’s outlook for the future; “Alive and Well,” “sings about resilience in the face of adversity,” (Rolling Stone Country), and “My Son” featured on the soundtrack of a new American Western film, “Old Henry,” is a cautionary tale from a father to a son. Highlights on the new album also include “Higher,” a duet with country royalty Tanya Tucker; “She Just Loves Me,” a love song to his wife – the first love song Montgomery has ever written; and “Ain’t She Beautiful,” an incredible ballad co-written by nephew Walker Montgomery.\n\nOrder Online HERE\n\n“Ain’t No Closing Me Down” Track List:\n\n01.

Eddie carries on the Montgomery Gentry legacy with his first solo album, and it contains a few surprises among the highly regarded Montgomery Gentry type songs. Eddie visits with Lorianne and Charlie to discuss those surprises as well as his free-spirited, down home way of life with his Smokin’ Hot Wife at home in Kentucky.\n\nListen to the full interview HERE\n\nKeeping the spirit of montgomery gentry alive\n\nEddie Montgomery is keeping the spirit of Montgomery Gentry alive in his first solo album, Ain’t No Closing Me Down.\n\nEddie Montgomery still feels the loss of Troy Gentry, his long-time friend, fellow hearty-partier, and partner. But as he recorded his first solo album — Ain’t No Closing Me Down, due for exclusive release at Walmart on Friday, Oct. 29 — he’s been determined to keep his late buddy’s spirit alive.\n\n“Ain’t a day goes by that I don’t think of him,” Montgomery says of Gentry, who died in a 2017 helicopter crash. “We made a promise, a deal, way back when. It was over Jim Beam. It was: If one of us goes down, we want Montgomery Gentry to go on. Keep the music going. We were a honky-tonk band, and he’s with me, and he’s always going to be.”\n\nPre-Save the Digital Album HERE\n\nRead More\n\nEddie Montgomery’s debut album, “Ain’t no closing me down,” is available for pre-order exclusively at walmart\n\n“Ain’t No Closing Me Down,” country superstar Eddie Montgomery’s debut solo 12-track album, will be available exclusively at Walmart on October 29 via Average Joes Entertainment.
