        "text": "Eric Church doubled down Tuesday on celebrating his latest top-charting country hits.\n\nThe Chief gathered with collaborators, friends, family and industry colleagues in Nashville to toast 2017 single “Round Here Buzz” and 2019’s “Some of It,” both of which climbed to No. 1 on country radio.\n\n“Some of It,” part of Church’s 2018 album “Desperate Man,” comes co-written by BMI songwriters Church, Jeff Hyde, Bobby Pinson and Clint Daniels; “Round Here Buzz,” off 2015 release “Mr. Misunderstood,” was penned by Church, Hyde and Luke Dick.\n\nChurch — an EMI Nashville artist — thanked his family, team and band during the celebration.\n\n“As we go around the world, the tip of the spear for me is the band and the crew,” Church said. “They’re the ones, when everyone’s looking for some advantage, that advantage comes live. It comes when you’re in front of people. It comes when you can sell it.”\n\nHe continued: “When you’ve got two radio stations saying it’s not researching &mldr; you know what research is? When you go out there and sell the arena out. &mldr; So, to the band and the crew, they’re the ones that actually take the spear and put it into the body, so for them I say thank you for every night you do that.”\n\nCelebratory speeches were prefaced by a compilation video showcasing country mainstays the likes of Keith Urban, Jon Pardi and Kenny Chesney sharing appreciation for Church's craft.\n\nRegarding the video, Church said, \"My intention was always just to try to make great music, write great songs. And to see it matter is really something.\n\n\"But I will say this after seeing the video ... I’m not done. I’m not retiring. I’m not dying. I look forward to kicking their asses every night on stage.\"\n\nIt’s been a record year for Church (mild pun intended), as the powerhouse “Springsteen” performer continues his \"Double Down\" tour, which brings two-night residencies to arenas across North America. The tour stopped earlier this year at Nashville’s Nissan Stadium, where Church delivered a three-plus-hour performance to a record-setting audience of 56,521.\n\nMore: Eric Church goes the distance at record-breaking Nashville concert\n\nHe’ll bring his chart-topping momentum to the annual CMA Awards in November, where he’s earned nominations for Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year and Music Video of the Year."
