The document provides a synopsis of a screenplay that begins as a recreation of the 1950 film \"The Blue Lamp\" but then transforms into a modern police drama called \"The Filth\", following Tom Riley from his arrest for killing a police officer in 1949 through to the present day where corrupt police officers try to force a confession from him for their own crimes. The screenplay was commissioned by the BBC to push creative boundaries and produce low-budget but high-quality television dramas.",
