Results showed the following. First, Hindus with high religiosity were more likely to perceive more threat from Muslim immigrants.

Finally, intergroup contact was negatively correlated with the perception of threat from Muslim immigrants. Theoretical implications related to intergroup contact, religiosity, and group vitality are discussed.\n\n...) threatens its values/beliefs and group, prejudicial reactions can develop in ... intergroup contact between Hindus and Muslim immigrants in India.

The American Journal of Semiotics: Volume > 24 > Issue: 1/3\n\nFabius Leineweber, Marcella Faria Computer-Mediated Communication in Biology\n\nabstract | view | rights & permissions\n\nIncreasingly, biologists are using computers to model and to create biological representations. However, the exponential growth in available biological dataposes a challenge for experimental and theoretical researchers in both Biology and in Computer Science. In short, when even the simple retrieval of relevant biological information for a researcher becomes a complex task — its analysis and synthesis with other biological information will become even more daunting and unlikely. In this context, specially organized ‘structures of representation’ are needed for the efficient interpretation of experimentally generated data. The “semantic Web” is a recent trend in networking techniques that we will examine here as a possible strategy for the computation of biological data — one that may allow us to take into account both the semiotic dimensions of biological processes, as well as their dynamic organization into stable and systemic levels. Thereupon, we propose that a semantic network for biology could benefit from principles rooted in such previous representation efforts as computer-generated ‘landscapes’ and ‘physical attractors’ — and that such principles could, in turn, then be better integrated into biological research through the development of a more semiotically informed user / computer interface design.\n\n...
