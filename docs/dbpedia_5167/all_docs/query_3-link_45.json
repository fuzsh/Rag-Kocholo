They found that a single trial in which sweetened water was paired with nausea induced by injection was enough to suppress subsequent intake of sweetened water almost totally. A mild electric shock, however, was far less effective. This seems to reflect a very primitive biological capacity for one-trial learning when the stakes are high enough in survival terms. [See now unpleasure, why it has to be so unpleasant.]\n\nGate: [Computer terminology.] Logic circuits were originally invented by the likes of Charles Wynn-Williams, Konrad Zuse, George Stibitz, and John Atanasoff, and their basic physical components are called \"logic gates\". Fundamentally, they are electronic switches capable of executing Boolean decision making, that is to say, combinatory binary symbolic logic of the form developed in the nineteenth century by George Boole and Augustus de Morgan. Lewin (1985) describes logic circuits as \"combinational networks\", and summarises their operating principles as follows: \"A combinational logic circuit is one in which the output (or outputs) obtained from the circuit is solely dependant on the present state of the inputs. [] The classical objective of combinational design is to produce a circuit having the required switching characteristics but utilising the minimum number of components [] Switching problems are usually presented to the designer [] specifying the logical behaviour of the circuit. From this specification a mathematical statement of the problem can be formulated [and] simplified where possible. These simplified equations may then be directly related to a hardware diagram .....\" (Lewin, 1985, pp53-54; emphasis original).\n\nGatekeeper: The Gatekeeper is/was one of the \"troops\", the alter personalities, in case, Truddi Chase.\n\nGeben: [German = \"to give\" (Past participle gegeben = \"given\").] This everyday German word was brought centre stage within mental philosophy by Kant as a way of describing the presentation of an object to our experience [for more on which, see the entry for \"givenness\".]\n\nGegeben: See geben.\n\nGegenstand: [German = \"object, thing; subject (matter), theme, topic; item, matter, affair, issue\" (C.G.D.).] [See firstly consciousness, Meinong's theory of.] This everyday German word was first incorporated into the lexicon of mental philosophy by Kant (1781, 1787/1996), who used it (e.g., p211) to refer to the external object of perception, and was then made a fundamental element of Gegenstandstheorie by Meinong. The point about Gegenstand is that it refers to the \"material 'thing'\" itself, and not to the \"multiplicity of associated sensorial impressions\" which \"enrich\" it (Rizzuto, 1990, p242). [Compare entity and Vorstellung.]\n\nGegenstandstheorie: [German Gegenstand = \"object, etc.\" + theorie = \"theory\".] The central thesis of Meinong's mental philosophy is that there are four distinct elements to cognition, namely (1) the act [Akt] of perceiving, (2) the content [Inhalt] of experience, (3) the object [Gegenstand], and (4) the experiences [Erlebnisse]. The resulting theoretical position is commonly referred to as Gegenstandstheorie [= \"theory of objects\"], and the only initial complication was that there were important orders of complexity to the resulting Gegenstände, including, for example, a four-way classification into (1) Objeckte, i.e. objects simpliciter, (2) Objektive [henceforth \"objectives\"], i.e. thoughts, (3) Dignitative, i.e. feelings, and (4) Desiderative, i.e. desires. Here is Russell's pen-picture of how Meinong sees objects .....\n\n\"The first great division of objects is into three classes, those which exist, those which subsist (bestehen), and those which neither exist nor subsist. It is obvious that abstracts such as diversity or numbers do not exist; propositions, again, are non-existent; thus certainly there are objects which do not exist, and which yet in some sense subsist. But even when we include subsistence, we do not, it would seem, find a place for all objects; some, such as false propositions, the round square, etc., are objects and yet do not subsist. There are two sorts of judgments, which may be called thetic and synthetic; the former assert the being of something, the latter assert its being so-and-so (Sein and Sosein). The latter sort may subsist when their subjects do not subsist; the round square is certainly both round and square, although the round square does not subsist\" (Russell, 1905, p531).\n\nMeinong's distinction between objects and objectives is not totally dissimilar to the classical distinction between ειδος and ιδεα [see G.2], whilst feelings and desires are recognised members of Hamilton's triad, that is to say, they constitute two thirds of the soul, tripartite.\n\nGemüt: [German = \"mind, soul, heart, disposition, nature, [etc.]\" (C.G.D.).] See mind.\n\nGene: A gene is a subsection of a chromosome. It contains just enough genetic material to manufacture a single molecule of protein (although it can do this many times). Each human chromosome contains of the order of 100,000 genes, each of which has a molecular weight of the order of 1 million and contains perhaps 1500 nucleotide pairs.\n\nGeneral Learning Disability: See learning disability and special educational need, the basics.\n\nGeneralised Event Memory (GEM): See event memory.\n\nGenetic Epistemology: See epistemology, genetic.\n\nGestaltism: See Gestalt School.\n\nGestalt Laws: These are the laws of early perceptual processing identified by the Gestalt School as being responsible for organising sensory input prior to the act of perceptual recognition. Perception, in other words, is not regarded as a single process, but as a combination of perceptual organisation followed by pattern recognition. To explain their observations, the Gestalt School (workers such as Wertheimer, Kohler, Koffka, Lewin, and Duncker) argued that the brain had certain innate electrical characteristics which actively organise sensory input [see field]. The individual laws were held by Koffka (1935) to be examples of a more basic law, the Law of Pragnanz, which holds simply that where there are several geometrically possible organisations for a given perceptual scene, the one which will be \"chosen\" is the one with the simplest and most stable shape. [See now the separate entries for closure, common fate, continuity, proximity, and similarity.]\n\nGestalt School: [See firstly perspectives and schools of psychology.] This is the name given to a school of German-speaking psychologists founded in effect by the University of Prague's Christian Von Ehrenfels in a book called Über Gestaltqualitäten [= \"On Gestalt Qualities\"] (Ehrenfels, 1890). Ehrenfels had studied as a young man under Franz Brentano at Vienna, and was therefore fully aware of the latter's views on the power of the \"presentation\" [Vorstellung] in deciding a given perceptual identification [for more on which see consciousness, Brentano's theory of]. He had also closely studied Ernst Mach's Analyse der Empfindungen [\"Analysis of the Sensations\"] (Mach, 1886), in which representations of \"space form\" and \"time form\" had been proposed in order to explain the theoretically troublesome phenomena of \"superordinate form\" or \"configuration\" .....\n\nTEST YOURSELF NOW: For a simple, yet compelling, graphical demonstration of the problem of superordinate form in two-dimensional visual perception, check out the following Navon figure - click here. Which did you perceive first, the superordinate \"EA\" or the component \"AE\"?\n\nAt that time, the canonical form of the superordinate form problem was one's ability to recognise a tune when we hear it in a key in which it has never been heard before (Flugel and West, 1964; Smith, 1994/2007 online), and it is this constant emphasis on the higher-order arrangement of lower-order elements which subsequently led to some commentators describing Gestalt psychology as \"Configurationism\". Ehrenfels felt, however, that Mach's book drew attention to but fell short of adequately explaining this class of phenomenon. Specifically, Mach did not sufficiently separate the raw sensory input (complete with all the \"qualities\" it conveyed) from the perception of \"form in space or time\" which then rather magically took place. Ehrenfel's own proposal was that there had to exist two levels of perceptual judgment, one more primitive than the other. The first and lower of these levels was responsible for early sensory analysis [identifying the individual notes of our melody, say], whilst the second and higher was responsible for detecting and recognising the over-arching \"Gestalt qualities\" [the melody as a recognisable whole]. Raw sensory information arrives at, and is dealt with, by the first level of processing, producing information of a fundamentally different sort for passing to the second level of processing.\n\nASIDE: Readers must bear in mind that Ehrenfels was working long before the age of \"processing stages\" or parallel distributed processing architectures [his paper was published in the same year that Herman Hollerith's electro-mechanical punched card tabulators started to take on bulk data from the 1890 US Census]. Such architectures think little of passing progressively metamorphosed streams of information between functionally specialised processing modules. For an industry-standard example of the staged-processing approach to auditory perception, see the upper left quadrant of the Ellis (1982) transcoding diagram.\n\nPromising though they were, Ehrenfels' ideas did not catch on, and responsibility for unravelling the functional architecture of aesthesis reverted for a full generation to being the preserve of mental philosophers, not least those other students of Brentano, Husserl and Meinong (Smith, 1994). One of the places where empirical research into perception survived was at the University of Berlin, where Carl Stumpf, another who had studied sound perception in the 1880s, had taken over Ebbinghaus's laboratory in 1894. Stumpf's position on the melody question was as follows .....\n\n\"Stumpf considers, in particular, the conditions that must be satisfied if a sequence of tones is to possess that specific sort of Gestalt which we call a melody. Such a sequence must, first of all, have a sense for the hearer, a notion which Stumpf explicates by developing a comparison between that system which is given tonality and analogous systems of a linguistic sort, for example in the sphere of phonology. It must secondly have a more or less definite rhythm [.....] must be a relatively self-contained whole or formation, not part of any continuation [, and] it must be non-decomposable: its parts must be dependent entities, not themselves capable of existing as musical categoremata in their own right\" (Smith, 1994/2007 online, p257).\n\nAs it turned out, it was Stumpf's students who were to make Gestaltism famous, and most noteworthy amongst these was a certain Max Wertheimer. Wertheimer, who had sat through Ehrenfels' lectures as an undergraduate at Prague (1901-1904) and Külpe's tutorials while doing his doctorate at Würzburg (1905), now commuted between (amongst other places) the laboratories at Frankfurt and Berlin, devising innovative yet always excruciatingly simple practical demonstrations of the vicissitudes of perceptual judgment, and trying them out on himself and his colleagues. The best known of these early demonstrations concerned the phenomenon of \"apparent movement\", that is to say, movement which objectively has not taken place, but which is nevertheless phenomenally real to the observer(s) concerned. In perhaps the simplest of its (many) variations, this demonstration simply exposed the observer to two alternately flashing lights .....\n\nTEST YOURSELF NOW: This being the age of the Internet, the apparent movement phenomenon is available online for all to experience for themselves. We particularly recommend the applets generously provided by the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University, which allow the viewer to vary the speed of alternation, the number and spatial separation of the lights, their diameter, their form, the colour scheme, and so on. There are number of demonstrations to get through, but try this one for starters: RUN THE BASIC PURDUE APPLET - the separate sensations are the individual stimulus on-offs, and the superordinate experience is what you think you see going on [and, needless to say, the objective record and the subjective experience do not match].\n\nWertheimer called the illusions of movement he was producing the \"phi phenomenon\", and published his account in (Wertheimer, 1912). As an easily replicable illusion, it soon became a classroom classic worldwide, and the problems of Gestaltqualitäten were on everyone's lips. Gestaltism as a recognisable school had arrived.\n\nASIDE: Wertheimer (1912) is a classic paper, and the problem with classic papers is that they lose a lot en route from the laboratories in which they were conceived to the provincial classrooms in which the rest of us learn about them. People stop thinking about the underlying problem, run the demonstration, and present the theory to the limits that they themselves understand it. The Purdue website includes an interesting exposé of what seems to have happened in this particular case, as one textbook misinformed the next, and so on for nigh on a century - see the entry for phi phenomenon for the necessary link [and make sure you RUN THE ADVANCED PURDUE APPLET while you're there - it's fascinating stuff].\n\nWertheimer lectured at Berlin from 1916 to 1929 (latterly as emeritus professor), gradually expanding his research interests to include learning, memory, problem solving, and creativity. Other influential members of the Gestalt movement were Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Köhler, Kurt Goldstein, and Kurt Lewin in Germany, Edgar Rubin in Denmark, and Albert Michotte in Belgium (e.g., Michotte, 1927), and their corporate findings are nowadays summarised in the so-called Gestalt laws. The term which best describes what these individual authors had in common is \"holistic\", that is to say, incapable of analysis into sub-components. This is why Gestaltism is so widely known today for its explanatory dictum that \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". Köhler puts it this way in his retrospective introduction to the science .....\n\n\"When the Gestalt problem first arose, nobody could foresee that later it was to be closely related to the concept of dynamic self-distribution; nor were the facts of sensory organisation immediately given the central position which they deserve. [.....] While a sensation is supposed to occupy its place in the field independently, i.e., determined by its local stimulus alone, the curious thing about the qualities which Ehrenfels introduced into scientific psychology is their relation to sets of stimuli. Nothing like them is ever brought about by strictly local stimulation per se; rather, the 'togetherness' of several stimuli is the condition which has these specific effects in a sensory field\" (Köhler, 1929/1947, p102).\n\nNote Köhler's use of the term \"dynamic\" in the above quotation. Gestaltism is often described nowadays as a \"dynamic\" psychology, but not in the same sense that psychodynamic theory was dynamic. Freudian dynamics are the dynamics of keeping a highly mobile but invisible enemy under some sort of control. The dynamics of Gestaltism, on the other hand, are the dynamics of the transient mental \"fields\" set up during the end-to-end processes of aesthesis [see the separate entry for fields, noting that Kurt Lewin's expertise in this latter area travelled with him when he emigrated to America in the 1930s]. It also relied on the theoretical principle of \"psychophysical isomorphism\" and, led by Wertheimer (in humans) and Köhler (in apes), did much to extend the scientific literature on insight learning and creativity in the mid-20th century. The term \"Berlin School\" seems to be used in two distinct ways in the literature - firstly it is used to describe the department of experimental psychology which Stumpf built up in the period 1894 to 1921, and secondly it may be describing the body of Gestaltist theory and research which came out of said department in the period between 1920 and 1933, when Wertheimer, Köhler, Goldstein, and Lewin were all based at that university at one time or another.\n\nGewahren: [From the German Gewahr werden = \"become aware of; see, perceive, notice, observe, discern, catch sight of\" (C.G.D.).] This everyday German word for the act of becoming aware of something was used in a philosophical sense by Husserl to describe a particular grade of awareness, as follows .....\n\n\"In perception properly so-called, as an explicit awareness (Gewahren), I am turned towards the object [to] apprehend it as being this here and now\" (Husserl, Ideas, p105).\n\n[In fact, many grades of awareness have been identified over the millennia. Compare, for example, Husserl's here and now awareness (above) with Freud's (1896) Bewusstsein and Wahrnehmungszeichen. And the final classification has yet to be determined.]\n\n\"Ghost in the Machine\": See consciousness, Ryle's theory of.\n\nGist: The key points in a story. [See now Bartlett (1932) and memory for gist.]\n\n\"Givenness\": [See firstly intuition and the discussion thereof in the entry for consciousness, Kant's theory of.] This is Kant's (1781-1787) notion of a grade of immediate phenomenal awareness, short of activation of the full concept, thus (two passages concatenated) .....\n\n\"Now there are two conditions under which alone there can be a cognition of an object. The first condition is intuition; through it an object is given, though only as appearance. The second condition is the concept; through it an object is thought that corresponds to this intuition. [.....] If a cognition is to have objective reality, i.e. if it is to refer to an object and have in that object its signification and meaning, then the object must be capable of being given in some way\" (Kant, 1787; Pluhar translation, p147/p226).\n\nGlobal Assessment of Functioning (GAF): [See firstly axis (of mental health disorder).] This is the DSM-IV overall assessment score for a person's mental health status across all axes of impairment. It is derived by thorough clinical assessment and helps plan and monitor therapy. Scores range from 0 to 100, in bands, as follows [all direct quotations from DSM-IV (2000, p34)] .....\n\nGAF 91 to 100: \"Superior functioning in a wide range of activities\".\n\nGAF 81 to 90: \"Absent or minimal symptoms\".\n\nGAF 71 to 80: \"Transient or expectable reactions to psychosocial stressors\"\n\nGAF 61 to 70: \"Some mild symptoms\".\n\nGAF 51 to 60: \"Moderate symptoms\".\n\nGAF 41 to 50: \"Serious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessive rituals, frequent shoplifting) OR any serious impairment in social occupational or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job)\" (emphasis original).\n\nGAF 31 to 40: \"Some impairment in reality testing or communication [] OR major impairment in several areas, such as work or school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood\" (emphasis original).\n\nGAF 21 to 30: \"Behaviour is considerably influenced by delusions or hallucinations\".\n\nGAF 11 to 20: \"Some danger of hurting self or others\".\n\nGAF 1 to 10: \"Persistent danger of severely hurting self or others\".\n\nGAF 0: \"Inadequate information\".\n\nRESEARCH ISSUE: The extent to which the more devious personality disorders are able to deceive clinicians into awarding them higher GAF scores than they strictly deserve is not known. In the present author's observation of life there are many GAFs 31 to 50 who are not in therapy at all and are informally assessed by the world as GAF 71 to 80 \"much as to be expected\".®\n\nGlucocorticoid: [See firstly homeostasis.] Glucocorticoids are one of two classes of corticosteroid hormone (the other being mineralocorticoids), and have the specific biological function of controlling the body's metabolism of glucose. They are relevant in the context of the present glossary, because glucose metabolism - responsible as it is for powering all forms of behaviour, mental and physical - is one of the main functional elements in the body's homeostatic and emotional response systems. With blood sugar homeostasis, for example, a monitoring system situated in the hypothalamus compensates for falling blood sugar levels by automatically releasing reserve stocks [check out the technicalities]. Glucocorticoids are thus the mainstay of our famed \"fight, flight, or fornicate\" instincts, all of which burn energy (some more than others, of course). [full Wikipedia briefing].\n\nGlutamate: A \"glutamate\" is an organic salt of a glutamic acid and a protein [full Wikipedia briefing]. Glutamates are noteworthy in the context of the present glossary for their role in neurotransmission in general, and for their role in glutamatergic neurotransmission in particular. Grosjean and Tsai (2007) summarise its effects as follows .....\n\n\"Glutamate was recognised as a neurotransmitter in the 1970s, and the subtypes of glutamate receptors were differentiated in the early 1980s. Today we know that glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain: 60% of brain neurons use glutamate as their primary neurotransmitter. Ionotropic receptors for glutamate are divided into NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, including AMPA [] and kainate subtypes. The involvement of NMDAR in working memory has been shown in primate studies where NMDA antagonists impair their working memory, and potentiation of NMDA transmission can correct the memory deficits\" (pp106-107).\n\nAs the name suggests, glutamatergic neurotransmission is a subtype of neurotransmission which characterises a \"glutamatergic synapse\", that is to say, one in which the transmitter substance itself is a glutamate and the post-synaptic membrane contains receptor sites for glutamate binding. [See now NMDA.]\n\nBREAKING RESEARCH: See the mention of Grosjean and Tsai's (2007) work on the potential role of NMDA dysregulation in the aetiology of borderline personality disorder.\n\nGmelin, Eberhardt: [No convenient online biography.] Gmelin is relevant to the present glossary for having been one of the first clinicians to report a case of multiple personality (Gmelin, 1791). Gmelin's case was a 20-year old German woman who could present either of two personae, one French-speaking and the other German-speaking.\n\nGoethe, Johann Wolfgang von: [German scientist-philosopher (1749-1832).] [Click for external biography] Although best remembered for his achievements as a writer, Goethe contributed significantly both to the philosophy of science and to psychology, where he produced one of the earliest theories of colour perception (Goethe, 1810).\n\nGoffman, Erving: [Canadian sociologist (1922-1982).] [Click for external biography] Goffman is noteworthy within the context of the present glossary for his work on frame analysis.\n\nGolgi Apparatus: This is an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, seemingly responsible for directing newly formed proteins back into the cytoplasm. It does this by forming them into small vesicles known as secretory granules which can then be passed in through the reticular membrane by a process known as endocytosis. The lysosomes are a type of secretory granule.\n\n\"Good Enough\" Parenting: This is Winnicott's (e.g., 1956, p386) term for everyday parenting by average people in average places with average cognitive architectures, possessed of average financial resources, and of average sanity (i.e., not themselves fatally traumatised). [For what happens when parenting is not quite \"good enough\" in any of these respects, see firstly holding environment and then (having taken a deep breath) the series of toxic parenting entries.]\n\nGorgias (of Leontini): [Greek Sophist Philosopher (483-375 BCE).] [Click for external biography]\n\nGraded Potential: [See firstly potential difference and propagation.] In the context of the present glossary, a graded potential is a small change in neural (or glial) membrane potential which dies away by decremental propagation, that is to say, smoothly with time or distance and without inducing an action potential.\n\nGrand Illusion: This is Blackmore's (2002) term for the possibility that what we experience as a smoothly flowing stream of consciousness is dangerously illusory, and can be exposed as exactly that by suitably designed probe tasks. For the details of the argument here, see the entry for stream of consciousness.\n\nGraz School: This is the name given to a school of philosopher-psychologists founded by Alexius Meinong at the University of Graz, Austria, in 1894, and including in its numbers Wilhelm Frankl, Franz Weber, and the subsequent founder of the Gestalt School, Christian von Ehrenfels [for a longer introductory, see Boudewijnse (1999/2007 online)].\n\nGrey Level Description: See perception, Marr's theory of.\n\nGrieving Process: This is Kubler-Ross's (1969) notion that grieving has a natural history to it, and has to work itself out in a more or less standard sequence of phases. She arrived at this conclusion by observing how people coped over the passing weeks following the death of a loved one, but it is now accepted that the same grieving profile accompanies any emotional shock, including sickness and redundancy. The grieving process is particularly relevant in the field of disability and mental health, since it will affect both the patient/client (the loss of their own health and prospects) and their caregivers (the loss of their loved one). The phases of grieving are as follows .....\n\n(1) Shocked Immobility: This is the state you are thrown into when you hear the bad news for the first time, and are at a loss to know how to react or what to say.\n\n(2) Denial: You then start to reject the news as essentially untrue [see denial, grief work for more on this].\n\n(3) Anger: You then accept the news as true, but get angry at it (and whoever happens to be in the way at the time).\n\n(4) Bargaining: You offer gifts and promises to \"the gods\" to have the truth somehow miraculously taken away.\n\n(5) Depression: You enter a period of reactive depression.\n\n(6) Testing: You begin to find your feet again, as life persists in going on despite your personal troubles.\n\n(7) Acceptance: Finally, personality type and ego strength permitting, you come fully to terms with the trauma, whatever it was.\n\nGuilt:\n\n\"And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed\" (Matthew, 27:5).\n\nIn everyday English, the word \"guilt\" describes not just the factual state of having done something immoral or illegal, but also the \"sense of guilt\" which tends to go with that factual state and which in a properly reflective self is characterised by often quite intense experiences of regret, loss, anxiety, and self-recrimination. Both phenomena fascinate us and readily command our attention - issues of factual guilt or innocence have inspired countless detective novels and courtroom dramas down the ages, and issues of remorsefulness - not least its erosive effects on the souls of those afflicted by it - have been popular topics with tragedians and their audiences ever since theatre was first invented. Here are some well-known examples of the latter genre [note that the first of the listed works is the one which inspired psychology's \"Oedipus complex\"] .....\n\n- In Sophocles' play Oedipus, the Tyrant, (ca. 428 BCE), the tragedy hinges on the guilt felt by a son upon learning that he has - albeit unwittingly - killed his father, had sexual intercourse with his mother, and inspired the larger part of Freudian theory in the process.\n\n- In the New Testament story of the Crucifixion, Judas Iscariot is reported as having hanged himself out of remorse once the enormity of his treachery had dawned upon him.\n\n- In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, the eponymous central character, ambitious to the extent of doing murder but not wicked enough to prevent the resulting guilt from clouding his judgment, is eventually done to death himself [see synopsis].\n\n- In Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, the eponymous central character is driven mad by the guilt he felt for having brought about the death of his shipmates by ignoring the sailors' superstition against killing albatrosses. [Note that feelings of guilt for having survived when others did not seem to have a large part to play in survivor syndrome.]\n\nAll in all, therefore, we should not be at all surprised that guilt was one of the first affects to be studied by the pioneers of psychodynamic theory. For example, both Freud and Breuer mention it a number of times under the name \"self-reproach\" - Freud's case, Elisabeth von R. felt guilty about resenting having to care for her ailing father when she would rather have been pursuing her personal affaires, and Breuer's case, Anna O. had periods of lucidity in which she could report being aware of a \"bad self\" responsible for \"all the nonsense\" which she regretted being unable [or was it merely unwilling?] to keep under control (both cases in Freud and Breuer, 1893-1895). Freud persisted with the topic in Draft K of the Fliess letters, listing feelings of reproach as significant in cases of obsessional neurosis (e.g., Freud, 1896, p220), and pointing out that several associated affects can arise out of the initial sense of guilt, thus .....\n\n\"The affect of the self-reproach may be transformed by various psychical processes into other affects, which then enter consciousness more clearly than the affect itself: for instance into anxiety (fear of the consequences of the action to which the self-reproach applies), hypochondria (fear of its bodily effects), delusions of persecution (fear of its social effects), shame (fear of other people knowing about it), and so on\" (Freud, 1896, Letters to Fliess (Draft K) [Standard Edition (Vol. 1)], p224 [there is a similar mention in Freud's 1909 case, Rat Man - see the separate entry, particularly the fourth session of analysis]).\n\nFreud eventually dealt with the problem of guilt by incorporating it into his notion of the \"superego\". Following your personal resolution of the Oedipus complex [see Freudian theory for the bare bones of this], guilt was what you were conditioned into feeling whenever your internalised same-sex parent spoke out like some inner voice telling you that this or that id-driven impulse was a non-runner because it was morally \"wrong\" [see the endnote below for a hyperlink to follow if interested in the particular issues of inner speech]. Freud then went even further out on a limb in his Totem and Taboo (Freud, 1917/1938), inspired in equal measure by Charles Darwin's notion of the \"primal horde\" and by Sir James Frazer's notions of \"totemism\".\n\nHISTORICAL ASIDE: Despite their obvious differences of purpose, the intrepid explorer, the military man, the missionary, and traders in far-off lands have one very important thing in common - they go to places and they see things which their less adventurous compatriots can only dream about. As a result, they have always provided science with an important stream of biological specimens, cultural artefacts, and comparative observational data, and this has always been useful in widening the theoretical horizons of the scientific community back at home. This datastream became particularly influential in the 19th century, as the planet's continental interiors were inexorably lost to the \"march of civilisation\". The British Empire led the opening up of hitherto \"Darkest\" Africa, the Americans linked their East and West Coasts with railroads and sparred for territory with the Hispanics to the South, the Russian Bear pushed down from Moscow towards India in what has aptly been called \"The Great Game\", and everybody who had a sail to hoist vied for influence in the Far East. As for the aboriginal cultures who stood in their way, they simply fell like ninepins to the \"pacification\" and rapine of their colonial occupiers. We mention this because it was common practice to embed [to use the modern term] peripatetic academics in with the colonising forces, armed with notebook and microscope and keen to catalogue the flora and fauna of these strange new places and to wonder at the generally ungodly ways of the \"savages\" who lived there. Charles Darwin is entirely typical in this respect, having used a Royal Navy survey ship - the now-legendary H.M.S. Beagle - as a mobile laboratory on his [in fact, her] voyages of discovery [see Darwin's log]. The topic of primitive belief systems came up time and time again in all this. James (1948) mentions an 1866 publication by Edward Tyler entitled \"The Religion of Savages\" (subsequently enlarged as Tyler, 1871), and, in the years which followed, three classic works deserve particular mention. The first is Sir James Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\". This was originally published between 1890 and 1915, and is currently available in condensed form as Frazer (1993). Supported by a detailed review of taboo, ritual, and legend from societies great and small around the world, Frazer argues for a fairly standard progression from magic and primitive superstition to religious belief, and then from religious belief to scientific thought. The other classics are Lucien Levy-Bruhl's (1910) \"How Natives Think\" and Emile Durkheim's (1912) \"Les Formes Élémentaires de la vie Religieuse\", both of which emphasised the role played by the social system in producing a set of beliefs characteristic of that social system. It is one of Frazer's less well-known works - his 1887 Totemism - which inspired Freud's Totem and Taboo.\n\nAll this cultural comparison brought a strong anthropological angle to Freud's consideration of the problem of guilt. He noted specifically that not all societies viewed certain transgressions the same way, but that - curiously enough - they all had formal taboos against incest. Could it be possible, he wondered, that the sexual dynamics of individual development somehow dictated a culture's beliefs and social mores? Was guilt, indeed, a causative factor in religion and ritual, rather than an artefact of it; was it, itself, in some way \"primal\"? Could Frazer's totemism simply be the Oedipus complex blown up out of all proportion, and was the totem on your totem-pole simply the father you had wanted to kill ever since you were five years old? Here are two quick extracts introducing the totem systems of primitive societies .....\n\n\"Among the Australians the system of Totemism takes the place of all religious and social institutions. Australian tribes are divided into smaller septs or clans, each taking the name of its totem. Now what is a totem? As a rule it is an animal, either edible and harmless, or dangerous and feared; more rarely the totem is a plant or a force of nature (rain, water), which stands in a particular relation to the whole clan. The totem is first of all the tribal ancestor of the clan, as well as its tutelary spirit and protector; it sends oracles and, although otherwise dangerous, the totem knows and spares its children. The members of a totem are therefore under a sacred obligation not to kill (destroy) their totem [..... and a]ny violation of these prohibitions is automatically punished\" (Freud, 1917/1938, Totem and Taboo [Brill Translation], pp16-17).\n\n\"'A totem', wrote Frazer in his first essay [Frazer (1887)], 'is a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate and altogether special relation. The connection between a person and his totem is mutually beneficent; the totem protects the man and the man shows his respect for the totem in various ways\" (op. cit., pp141-142).\n\nAnd here is the basic thesis .....\n\n\"Psychoanalysis has revealed to us that the totem animal is really a substitute for the father, and this really explains the contradiction that it is usually forbidden to kill the totem animal, that the killing of it results in a holiday and that the animal is killed and yet mourned. The ambivalent emotional attitude which today still marks the father complex in our children and so often continues into adult life also extended to the father substitute of the totem animal. [.....] The Darwinian conception of the primal horde does not, of course, allow for the beginning of totemism. There is only a violent, jealous father who keeps all the females for himself and drives away the growing sons. This primal state of society has nowhere been observed. The most primitive organisation we know, which today is still in force with certain tribes, is associations of men consisting of members with equal rights, subjected to the restrictions of the totemic system, and founded on matriarchy, or descent through the mother. Can the one have resulted from the other, and how was this possible? By basing our argument upon the celebration of the totem we are in a position to give an answer: One day the expelled brothers joined forces, slew and ate the father, and thus put an end to the father horde. [.....] Now they accomplished their identification with him by devouring him and each acquired a part of his strength. The totem feast, which is perhaps mankind's first celebration, would be the repetition and commemoration of this memorable criminal act\" (op. cit., pp188-190; bold emphasis added).\n\nAfter Totem and Taboo, Freud returned his attention to the neurotic Europeans who paid his fees, further developing his theory of guilt in The Ego and the Id (Freud, 1923/1960). Basically, he saw different ways of handling our unconscious guilt as responsible for different forms of psychopathology, but with one important property in common, namely that at some deep level neurotics grow addicted to, like in some perverse way, and generally come to feed off what guilt can do to them. Thus [a long extract, heavily abridged] .....\n\n\"There are certain people who behave in a quite peculiar fashion during the work of analysis. When one speaks hopefully to them or expresses satisfaction with the progress of the treatment, they show signs of discontent and their condition invariably becomes worse. [.....] They exhibit what is known as a 'negative therapeutic reaction'. There is no doubt that there is something in these people that sets itself against their recovery [.....]. If we analyse this resistance in the usual way [..... we find] a negative attitude towards the physician and clinging to the gain from illness. In the end we come to see that we are dealing with what may be called a 'moral' factor, a sense of guilt, which is finding its satisfaction in the illness and refuses to give up the punishment of suffering. [.....] But as far as the patient is concerned this sense of guilt is dumb; it does not tell him he is guilty; he does not feel guilty, he feels ill. This sense of guilt expresses itself only as a resistance to recovery which it is extremely difficult to overcome. [.....] An interpretation of the normal, conscious sense of guilt (conscience) presents no difficulties; it is based on the tension between the ego and the ego ideal and is the expression of a condemnation of the ego by its critical agency. [.....] In certain forms of obsessional neurosis the sense of guilt is over-noisy but cannot justify itself to the ego [..... and i]n melancholia the impression that the superego has obtained a hold upon consciousness is even stronger. [.....] We understand the difference. In obsessional neurosis what were in question were objectionable impulses which remained outside the ego, while in melancholia the object to which the superego's wrath applies has been taken into the ego through identification. [..... And in hysteria,] the mechanism by which the sense of guilt remains unconscious is [.....] an act of repression. It is the ego, therefore, that is responsible for the sense of guilt remaining unconscious. [..... Indeed, o]ne may go further and venture the hypothesis that a great part of the sense of guilt must normally remain unconscious, because the origin of conscience is intimately connected with the Oedipus complex, which belongs to the unconscious\" (Freud, 1923/1960, The Ego and the Id [Standard Edition], pp49-53; bold emphasis added).\n\nMoving forward a generation, Eriksonian theory also made much of guilt, seeing it as one of the bipolar markers for the third of their eight stages of identity development, namely the stage of \"identity versus guilt\". This third stage covers ages four to five years, the very period of the Oedipus conflict, and your personal outcome depends on how successfully your ego copes with the changes described above. If the conflict works itself through well, then a sense of identity results, as follows .....\n\n\"Being firmly convinced that he is a person, the child must now find out what kind of person he is going to be. And here he hitches his wagon to nothing less than a star: he wants to be like his parents, who to him appear very powerful and very beautiful, although quite unreasonably dangerous\" (Erikson, 1959, p74)\n\nIf, on the other hand, the particular individual resolution of the Oedipal conflict does NOT produce an appropriate balance of ego and superego resources, then the sense of guilt takes over instead, and pervades both the conscious and unconscious minds for the remainder of that individual's life, thus [a long passage, heavily abridged] .....\n\n\"A sense of self-control without loss of self-esteem is the ontogenetic source of a sense of free will. From an unavoidable sense of loss of self-control and of parental overcontrol comes a lasting propensity for doubt and shame. [.....] Shame is an infantile emotion insufficiently studied because in our civilisation it is so early and easily absorbed by guilt. Shame supposes that one is completely exposed and conscious of being looked at - in a word, self-conscious. One is visible and not ready to be visible [.....]. Shame is early expressed in an impulse to bury one's face or to sink, right then and there, into the ground. [.....] The destructiveness of shaming is balanced in some civilisations by devices for 'saving face'. [.....] Too much shaming does not result in a sense of propriety but in a secret determination to try to get away with things when unseen, if, indeed, it does not result in deliberate shamelessness\" (Erikson, 1968, pp109-112; bold emphasis added).\n\nIn fact, Erikson dates the emergence of the sense of guilt to a combination of \"vastly increased imagination\" (p118) and that \"great governor of initiative\", conscience, as follows .....\n\n\"The child, we said, now not only feels afraid of being found out, but he also hears the 'inner voice' of self-observation, self-guidance, and self-punishment, which divides him radically within himself: a new and powerful estrangement. This is the ontogenetic cornerstone of morality. But [.....] if this great achievement is overburdened by all too eager adults, it can be bad for the spirit and for morality itself. For the conscience of the child can be primitive, cruel, and uncompromising, as may be observed in instances where children learn to constrict themselves to the point of over-all inhibition; where they develop an obedience more literal that the one the parent wishes to exact; or where they develop deep regressions and lasting resentments [.....]. One of the deepest conflicts in life is caused by hate for a parent who served initially as the model and the executor of the conscience, but who was later found trying to 'get away with' the very transgressions which the child could no longer tolerate in himself\" (Erikson, 1968, p119).\n\nWHERE TO NEXT: For more on the psycholinguistics of the superego's magical inner voice, see the Research Exercise at the end of the entry for inner speech.

One disadvantage of the test is that it takes around six hours to work through all the sub-tests (Anastasi, 1990).\n\nHamilton's Triad: This is a convenient way of referring to Sir William Hamilton's modernisation of Plato's notion of the tripartite soul in the form of a three-headed taxonomy of the \"primary classes\" of mental phenomena, thus: \"Let the mental phenomena, therefore, be distributed under the three heads of phenomena of cognition, or the faculties of knowledge; phenomena of feeling, or the capacities of pleasure and pain; and phenomena of desiring or willing, or the powers of conation\" (Sir William Hamilton, p.p. Mansell and Veitch, 1865, p189). The second heading, feeling, is nowadays better known as affect. Hamilton went on to argue, however, that the three primary classes were then all subordinate to \"one universal phenomenon - the phenomenon of consciousness\" (ibid.).\n\nHard Problem, The: This is Chalmers' (1995) much quoted description of the problem of the subjectivity of consciousness. Here is the source text in full .....\n\n\"..... I find it useful to distinguish between the 'easy problems' and the 'hard problem' of consciousness. The easy problems are by no means trivial - they are actually as challenging as most in psychology and biology - but it is with the hard problem that the central mystery lies. The easy problems of consciousness include the following: How can the human subject discriminate sensory stimuli and react to them appropriately? How does the brain integrate information from many different sources and use this information to control behavior? How is it that subjects can verbalize their internal states? Although all these questions are associated with consciousness, they all concern the objective mechanisms of the cognitive system. Consequently, we have every reason to expect that continued work in cognitive psychology and neuroscience will answer them. The hard problem, in contrast, is the question of how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience. This puzzle involves the inner aspect of thought and perception: the way things feel for the subject. When we see, for example, we experience visual sensations, such as that of vivid blue. Or think of the ineffable sound of a distant oboe, the agony of an intense pain, the sparkle of happiness, or the meditative quality of a moment lost in thought. All are part of what I am calling consciousness. It is these phenomena that pose the real mystery of the mind.\" (Chalmers, 1995, pp62-63; bold emphasis added.)

As such, it is one of the most extreme and enduring affective states of mind, and therefore theoretically highly significant in most variants of psychodynamic theory.\n\nWHERE TO NEXT: If interested in group (including international) hatreds, then see hatred, large group aspects of. If interested in interpersonal hatreds, then see hatred, Oedipal aspects of.\n\nHatred, Large Group Aspects of: [See firstly hatred.] There is no shortage of anecdotal report from battlefields throughout history to the effect that most soldiers bear no personal malice against those they are trying to kill. \"I had to do it,\" they reassure you, \"it was either him or me\" [click for typical memoir]. To see why it is so easy to get them to do it nonetheless, see identity, large group.\n\nHatred, Oedipal Aspects of: [See firstly hatred and Oedipus conflict.] For Freud, hatred was nothing less than a biological certainty should a given child's Oedipus conflict fail to resolve [that is to say, should the same-sex parent fail to get properly internalised at around age five years]. This was because hatred of your father-rival [or mother-rival, if a girl] in your first attempt at a more-than-just-reflex pair bond was nothing less than \"the first hatred\". Here is some early Freud on this .....\n\n\"A solution to this difficulty is afforded by the observation that dreams of the death of parents apply with preponderant frequency to the parent who is of the same sex as the dreamer: that men, that is, dream mostly of their father's death and women of their mother's. [.....] It is as though - to put it bluntly - a sexual preference were making itself felt at an early age: as though boys regarded their fathers and girls their mothers as their rivals in love, whose elimination could not fail to be to their advantage\" (Freud, 1900/1958, The Interpretation of Dreams [Standard Edition (Vol. 4)], p356; bold emphasis added].\n\nMoreover, if the necessary identification was defective, then not only would the relationship with the opposite-sex parent fail to fulfil itself vicariously, but the nascent superego would be unable to alleviate any residual pain by redefining the hatred as somehow inherently \"wrong\". Freud subsequently produced more of an object-relations interpretation of hatred in Instincts and Their Vicissitudes (Freud, 1915), where one of the vicissitudes [= \"uncertainties, especially of form\"] of love is its tendency to flip catastrophically into hatred if the love object in question becomes the source of unpleasure, as now explained .....\n\n\"If the object becomes a source of pleasurable feelings, a motor urge is set up which seeks to bring the object closer to the ego and to incorporate it into the ego. We then speak of the 'attraction' exercised by the pleasure-giving object, and say that we 'love' that object. Conversely, if the object is a source of unpleasurable feelings, there is an urge which endeavours to increase the distance between the object and the ego [.....]. We feel the 'repulsion' of the object, and hate it; this hate can afterwards be intensified to the point of an aggressive inclination against the object - an intention to destroy it\" (Freud, 1915/1957, Instincts and Their Vicissitudes [Standard Edition], p137; bold emphasis added).\n\nASIDE: Freud made much the same point two years later in Mourning and Melancholia (Freud, 1917/1957) when discussing narcissistic hatred, and then again in The Ego and the Id (Freud, 1923/1960) where he uses the \"unexpected regularity\" (p41) with which love and hate go hand in hand to reflect upon the existence of a death-instinct.\n\nFor their part, the Kleinian School assumes hate as \"a complex process whereby an internal object is damaged or destroyed and the ego is faced with the exceedingly daunting task of renegotiating internal reality in the wake of such hate\" (Bollas, 1987, p117). Kernberg, for example, makes much of it in his explanation of aggression, personality disorders and. And for his part, Erikson (1968) also notes a source of Oedipal hatred arising later in life, in the event that the parents - once so keen to impose their rules - ever get exposed as hypocritical of those rules in their own behaviour [see the fuller quotation towards the end of the entry for guilt]. More recently, Bollas (1987) has identified what he calls \"loving hate\", as follows .....\n\n\"It is my view that in some cases a person hates an object not in order to destroy it, but to do precisely the opposite: to conserve the object. Such hate is fundamentally nondestructive in intent and, although it may have destructive consequences, its aim may be to act out an unconscious form of love. I am inclined to term this 'loving hate', by which I mean a situation where an individual preserves a relationship by sustaining a passionate negative cathexis of it. If the person cannot do so by hating the object he may accomplish this passionate cathexis by being hateful and inspiring the other to hate him. A state of reciprocal hate may prevail [.....] Viewed this way, hate is not the opposite of, but a substitute for, love\" (Bollas, 1987, p118; bold emphasis added).\n\nWAS THIS A SENSITIVE TOPIC FOR YOU?: If for any reason you have been emotionally affected by any of the issues dealt with in this entry, you will find suitable helpline details in the entries for child abuse and infanticide and/or partner abuse and/or toxic caring.\n\nH.D.: See case, H.D.\n\n\"Hebb-Marr Network\": Same as neural network.

Originally stated as follows: \"Let us assume then that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or 'trace') tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. The assumption can be precisely stated as follows: When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.\" (Hebb, 1949, p62; italics original.)\n\nHegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich: [German Idealist philosophy (1770-1831).] The German philosopher Georg Hegel [floruit 1807-1830] studied Kantian philosophy at Jena in the opening years of the 19th century, and became inspired thereby to devote a lifetime to the bold pursuit of \"the whole truth\" of mental philosophy (Loewenberg, 1929, ix), setting out his conclusions in \"Phenomenology of Mind\" (1807), \"Science of Logic\" (1812-1816), and \"Encyclopaedia of Philosophical Sciences\" (1817-1830). Although acclaimed for his phenomenology, Hegel's accumulated writings dwell almost exclusively on the broad process of aesthesis rather than progressively zooming in on the all-critical central act of aesthesis - that magical moment of suddenly being aware of something. Admittedly, Hegel helps us to a number of important insights, but in the final analysis we are being asked to agree that these insights render the problem of subjectivity a non-problem, and in our judgment the evidence for this is insufficient.\n\nHeidegger, Martin: [German philosopher (1889-1976).] [Click for biography.] See consciousness, Heidegger's theory of.\n\nHeimann, Paula Gertrude: [Polish (later British) psychotherapist (1899-1982).] [Click for external biography] Heimann is noteworthy in the context of the present glossary for her work on the dynamics of the internalisation of objects in early development.

For present purposes, his major works were \"On Goethe's Scientific Researches\" (1853) and \"The Facts in Perception\" (1878).\n\nHelp-Rejecting Complaining: This is one of the defense mechanisms postulated by psychoanalytic theory, and recognised by the DSM-IV as belonging to the \"action\" defense level. It presents as \"complaining or making repetitious requests for help\" (DSM-IV, 2000, p811), and then rejecting whatever is offered.\n\nHemispheric Loop Line: In his Principles, William James attempted to provide what he called a \"general notion\" (1890, p20) of the physiological layout of the nervous system. This was that \"the lower centres act from present sensational stimuli alone; the hemispheres act from perceptions and considerations\" (Ibid.). James summarized that notion graphically, using a circle to represent the nervous system below the level of the cerebral hemispheres, and a larger horizontal ovoid to represent the hemispheres themselves [click here to see reproduction]. There is a large and constant flow of information from the senses to the lower processing centres. This information is then analysed and used to support behaviour of the muscles. James describes this basic biological layout as the \"direct line\". He then describes the hemispheres as adding a \"long circuit\" or \"loop-line\" \"through which the [nervous] current may pass when for any reason the direct line is not used\" (p21).\n\nHerbart, Johann Friedrich: [German educational psychologist (1776-1841).] [Click for external biography] Although Herbart was ostensibly an educational theorist, he is worth noting in the present context for three important contributions to mental philosophy. The first of these contributions is that he took a very \"dynamic\" view of what went on in the mind, seeing ideas as akin to forces and thoughts akin to the resulting movements. He also presumed that these movements and forces could be fitted to mathematical formulae, which could then be used, in turn, to design experiences for particular ends [this, of course, being the primary duty of any educator]. Herbart's second contribution is that he coined the term \"limen\" to indicate what has since been termed the \"threshold of consciousness\". Things would be happening in a given mind at a given point in time which were not yet fully formed or conscious. This he saw as a point beyond which a required idea needed to be excited in order to retrieve that idea back into consciousness. His third contribution arises from what happens once one or more new ideas has/have been raised above the limen of consciousness. What happens in this instance is that the individual mind's \"apperceptive mass\" expands to \"assimilate\" the new content.\n\nHermeneia: [Greek <ερμηνεια> ermeneia = \"speech, interpretation\" (O.C.G.D.).] This classical Greek word for the act of explaining the nature of something in words was adopted by Heidegger (1927) as the root concept for his hermeneutic philosophy. In his commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Sheehan (1984) explains the relevance of the term as follows .....\n\n\"In ordinary experience human beings live in their concerns and projects and thus already have a practical, if unthematic, understanding (hermeneia) of the being of themselves, other people, tools and nature. For example, when we employ tools for purposes, we know the tool as for something, and this pragmatic as-factor indicates that human being already understands the being-dimension of the tool (X as being Y). In fact, Heidegger claims that the Greeks basically experienced being in this practical modality, as evidenced by their appropriation of the word ousia - which refers to things of practical concern, like tools and houses - for 'being'\" (p294).\n\nHermeneutic Cycle: [See firstly hermeneutics.] This is Dreyfus's (1991) term to describe the fact that applications of the hermeneutic method need to be sustained iteratively, thus: \"In general, the so-called hermeneutic cycle refers to the fact that in interpreting a text one must move back and forth between an overall interpretation and the details that a given reading lets stand out as important\" (Dreyfus, 1991, p36).\n\nHermeneutic Phenomenology: See phenomenology, hermeneutic.\n\nHermeneutics: Hermeneutics is \"the art or science of interpretation, esp. of scripture\" (O.E.D.). The word was popularised within mental philosophy by Heidegger (1927/1962), as a way of explaining what it was about his Dasein construct which suddenly made it capable of interpreting itself. Thus: \"The phenomenology of Dasein is a hermeneutic in the primordial signification of this word, where it designates this business of interpreting [..... and also] in the sense of working out the conditions on which the possibility of any ontological investigation depends\" (p62). Dreyfus (1991) adds .....\n\n\" For Heidegger, hermeneutics begins at home in an interpretation of the structure of everydayness in which Dasein dwells. [..... It is] 'the attempt first of all to define the nature of interpretation' [.....] Hermeneutic phenomenology, then, is an interpretation of human beings as essentially self-interpreting, thereby showing that interpretation is the proper method for studying human beings\" (p34).\n\nHeron of Alexandria: [Alexandrian Greek inventor (19-75 CE; but dates contentious).] According to the O'Connor and Robertson (1999/2006 online) biography, Heron was probably a lecturer in mechanics and pneumatics at the Museum of Alexandria, and is famous for compiling a textbook of this technology and its application. These mechanisms and mechanical amusements included primitive attempts at automatic doors, the first steam turbine, and a entire range of animated statues and monumental ornaments.

Winnicott chose the word \"holding\" because of the literal physical contact involved, but nevertheless liked to observe the entire situation in which that contact took place, trying to locate the all-important but extremely fragile area within which the mother moved freely and felt in charge, thus .....\n\n\"\"Satisfactory parental care can be classified roughly into three overlapping stages: (a) Holding. (b) Mother and infant living together. Here the father's function (of dealing with the environment for the mother) is not known to the infant). (c) Father, mother, and infant, all three living together. The term 'holding' is used here to denote not only the actual physical holding of the infant, but also the total environmental provision prior to the concept of living with. [.....] The term 'living with' implies object relationships, and the emergence of the infant from the state of being merged with the mother, or his perception of objects as external to the self\" (Winnicott, 1960, p588; bold emphasis added).\n\nHere is the fuller theory .....\n\n\"Freud was able to formulate a theory of the very early stages of the emotional development of the individual at a time when theory was being applied only in the treatment of the well-chosen neurotic case. [.....] As we look back now we may say that cases were well chosen as suitable for analysis if in the very early personal history of the patient there had been good enough [note this term - Ed.] infant-care. [.....] At that time theory was groping towards a deeper insight into this matter of the mother with her infant, and indeed the term 'primary identification' implies an environment that is not yet differentiated from that which will be the individual. When we see a mother holding an infant soon after birth, or an infant not yet born, at this same time we know that there is another point of view, that of the infant if the infant were already there; and from this point of view the infant is either not yet differentiated out, or else the process of differentiation has started and there is absolute dependence on the immediate environment and its behaviour. It has now become possible to study and use this vital part of old theory in a new and practical way in analytical work, work either with borderline cases or else with the psychotic phases or moments that occur in the course of the analyses of neurotic patients or normal people. This work widens the concept of transference since at the time of the analysis of these phases the ego of the patient cannot be assumed as an established entity, and there can be no transference neurosis [without] an ego [.....]. I have referred to the state of affairs that exists when a move is made in the direction of emergence from primary identification. Here at first is absolute dependence. There are two possible kinds of outcome: by the one environmental adaptation to need is good enough, so that there comes into being an ego which, in time, can experience id-impulses; by the other environmental adaptation is not good enough, and so there is no true ego establishment, but instead there develops a pseudo-self which is a collection of innumerable reactions to a succession of failures of adaptation\" (Winnicott, 1956, p386; emphasis added).\n\nOr from the baby's point of view .....\n\n\"The baby takes for granted all things like the softness of the clothes and having the bath water at the right temperature. What cannot be taken for granted is the mother's pleasure that goes with the clothing and bathing of her own baby. If you are there enjoying it all, it is like the sun coming out for the baby. [If not,] the whole procedure is dead, useless, and mechanical\" (Winnicott, 1957, p27).\n\nHopkins (1991) has looked in greater detail at the effects of physical rejection in the holding environment on the child's subsequent attachment behaviour. She presents case, Clare, case, Laura, and case, Paddy for consideration, and argues from those data that it is the availability and accessibility of the mother which is critical rather than the holding per se. [See now true self versus false self.]\n\nHolism: Holism is a philosophical doctrine predicated upon the assertion that complex sociocultural and psychological phenomena can never ultimately be explained in terms of underlying chemical or physiological processes [in which respect it is diametrically opposed to the position known as \"reductionism\"]. The holistic approach is far from universally supported, because complex systems actually need to be dissected in order to obtain experimental data, and thus expose them to the rigours of the scientific method. The price of the data, however, is that you lose sight of the wood for looking at the trees. For canonical examples of holistic theories of psychology, see the work of the Gestalt school (cognition),\n\nHolism-Reductionism Problem: See the separate entries for holism and reductionism.\n\nHolocaust, the: This is the received term for the systematic and institutionalised genocide inflicted upon the European Jews and other minorities by the Nazis during World War II. [See now aggression, institutionalisation of and case, Butrimonys.]\n\nHomunculus Fallacy: [See firstly consciousness, Dennett's theory of and consciousness, Ryle's theory of.] The term \"homunculus\" [sometimes \"homonculus\"] is Latin for \"little man\", and was popularized within cognitive science by Penfield and Boldrey (1937), following a major exercise mapping the somatotopic organization of the cerebral cortex. Penfield and Boldrey's Figure 28 shows a deformed, but nevertheless recognizable, mapping of the skeletomuscular body onto a transverse section of the primary sensory and motor areas. Now it so happened that Penfield and Boldrey's neuroanatomical data reflected on the long and bitter philosophical debate about soul, and the notion of an inner spirit of some sort in the mind was about to be severely criticised in Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\" (Ryle, 1949). Ryle has argued that the very notion of \"inner\" and \"outer\" worlds was \"notoriously charged with theoretical difficulties\" (Ryle, 1949, p14), and had described as \"Descartes' myth\" the idea that there could be such a thing as a \"ghost in the machine\". Attneave (1960) wrote a paper entitled \"In Defence of Homunculi\" in which he argued that the problem of regression only applies \"if we try to make the homunculus do everything\" (p778). He sides with Bullock (1961) that there has to be a trigger neural unit somewhere which decides on the basis of the information available to it whether to authorise a particular piece of behaviour - that is to say, a \"final functional unit\", which, \"like a military general\" (Bullock, 1961, p718) acts as a \"decision unit\". We like Baars' (1997) distillation of Ryle's position, as follows: \"If we had an observing self contemplating the contents of consciousness, he [= Ryle] argued, how would we explain the self itself? By another observer inside the inner self?\" (p143). This particular problem is not new, however, being quite clearly seen in Aristotle's De Anima, thus: \"..... if the sense that perceives sight were some other sense than sight, the only alternative to an infinite regress [note this phrase] will be that there be some sense that perceives itself [so] why not let this be a feature of the first of the series?\" (p192, Lawson-Tancred translation). The topic became mainstream as part of the 1980s debate on whether a machine could ever be conscious, with Searle (1990) judging that most computational theory is guilty of the homunculus fallacy. Dennett's even more substantial point is that the whole notion of perceptual representation is riddled with the homunculus fallacy. This is because \"nothing is intrinsically a representation of anything; something is a representation only for or to someone\" (Dennett, 1981, p122; emphasis added).\n\nHope of Success (HS): See personality, motivation and.\n\nHot Cognition: See hyperconnectivity model.\n\nHrdy, Sarah B.: [American anthropologist-primatologist] [Click for external biography] Hrdy is noteworthy in the context of the present glossary for her work on infanticide and the selfish gene.\n\nHughlings Jackson, John: [British neurologist (1835-1911).] [Click for external biography] John Hughlings Jackson graduated from medical school in 1856, and took up a residency at the York Dispensary under Thomas Laycock, from whom he quickly acquired a fascination with neurology. He moved on to the then-recently-founded National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, Queens Square, London [now the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery] in 1862, specialising initially in epilepsy and gradually developing an reputation for the thoroughness of his clinical observation and the originality of his analyses [although apparently he eschewed formal experimentation and rarely used a microscope]. Amongst the career achievements identified by Meares (1999/2006 online), we have the following (abridged, and with individual citations removed; note carefully the point about representation, re-representation, and re-re-representation) .....\n\n1. On the Self: \"Jackson's approach to an understanding of mental illness began with a working model of 'mind'. He saw mind, or self, as a manifestation of brain function. [.....] He believed that one arose our of the other, so that there emerges a 'concomitant parallelism'. [.....] The next step in his argument concerned an adequate description of 'self'. Jackson believed himself to be the first to use the term in medical writing. He conceived it as double, consisting of subject and object or, as he put it, of 'subject consciousness...symbolised by 'I' [and] object consciousness...Each by itself is nothing; [each] is only half itself'. In essence, self depended on the emergence of what he called the 'introspection of consciousness'\" (Meares, 1999).\n\n2. On Basic Nervous System Organisation: \"Early in his career Jackson worked under the physician Thomas Laycock and was impressed by his doctrine of reflex cerebral action. Jackson was also influenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who suggested an evolutionary organization of the brain. These two ideas were joined in Jacksons quest for an understanding of the evolution of self. He conceived of the central nervous system (CNS) in terms of its simplest functional unit. For Jackson, this unit was reflexive, the smallest element of sensorimotor function. Each of these units is a representing system. The brain, in his view, evolves and develops through an increasingly complex coordination of these units. As the organism evolves to a higher stage of function, it is not as if something new were being tacked on, which provides new representations. Rather, there is a re-representation. At a higher stage still, there is a re-re-representation, so that the most recently evolved part of the brain, the cerebral cortex, is 'universally representing'. 'The whole nervous system is a sensori-motor mechanism, a co-ordinating system from top to bottom'\" (Meares, 1999).\n\n3. On the Mind-Brain Problem: \"Jackson rejected the idea that the mind or self requires a special new form of neural function to be built into the human brain. He wrote: 'There is no autocratic mind at the top to receive sensations as a sort of raw material, out of which to manufacture ideas, etc., and then to associate these ideas'. The appearance of self is the manifestation of a more complex coordination than previously. What is new, then, is a new, or higher, system of unification of the whole organism whereby the organism as a whole is adjusted to the environment. Self, however, is dependent on the evolution of anatomically new structures. Jackson suggested that the evolutionary development of the prefrontal cortex is necessary to the emergence of self. In this sense it could be called the 'organ of mind'. However, this is not to say that self resides in the prefrontal cortex. Rather, the new structure allows a more complex coordination of what is 'anatomically a sensori-motor machine'\" (Meares, 1999).\n\nHere is Jackson himself, firstly on the architectural principles of the intact system .....\n\n\"Beginning with evolution, and dealing only with the most conspicuous parts of the process, I say of it that it is an ascending development in a particular order. I make three statements which, although from different standpoints, are about the very same thing. 1. Evolution is a passage from the most to the least organised; that is to say, from the lowest, well organised, centres up to the highest, least organised, centres [.....] 2. Evolution is a passage from the most simple to the most complex; again, from the lowest to the highest centres [.....] 3. Evolution is a passage from the most automatic to the most voluntary. The triple conclusion [] is that the highest centres, which are the climax of nervous evolution, and which make up the 'organ of mind' (or physical basis of consciousness) are the least organised, the most complex, and the most voluntary\" (Jackson, 1884; extracted in Herrnstein and Boring, 1965, p234).\n\n..... and then on what happens when such a system is damaged (note the use of the word \"layer\" to apply to the brain centres as anatomical structures, and of the phrase \"level of evolution\" to apply to the relative functional complexity of those centres) .....\n\n\"So much for the positive process by which the nervous system is 'put together' - Evolution. Now for the negative process, the 'taking to pieces' - Dissolution. Dissolution being the reverse of [evolution] is a process of undevelopment; it is a 'taking to pieces' in the order from the least organised, from the most complex and most voluntary, towards the most organised, most simple, and most automatic. [..... T]he statement, 'to undergo dissolution' is rigidly the equivalent of the statement, 'to be reduced to a lower level of evolution' [..... and] the assertion is that each person's normal thought and conduct are, or signify, survivals of the fittest states of what we may call the topmost 'layer' of his highest centres: the normal highest level of evolution\" (Jackson, 1884; extracted in Herrnstein and Boring, 1965, pp234-235).\n\nFor Jackson's views on the cognitive series, see that entry. Note also the pre-sensation as a sort of rudimentary consciousness of a lower level of nervous activity by a higher level.\n\n[BREAKING RESEARCH: For more on the potential role of \"abnormal connectivity\" in preventing or degrading the maximal integration of multi-modular cognitive processing, see functional connectivity and its onward links.]\n\nHume, David: [Scottish Empiricist philosopher (1711-1776).] [Click for external biography] Hume's \"Treatise of Human Nature\" (Hume, 1748-1752/1911) is a late-Enlightenment classic on such topics as the association of ideas, causality, and moral philosophy. As an Associationist, Hume is remembered for his \"three principles of association\", namely \"resemblance\", \"contiguity in time or place\", and \"cause and effect\". Of these, the third is the most effective, there being no relation, he asserts \"which produces a stronger connection in the fancy, and makes one idea more readily recall another, than the relation of cause and effect betwixt their objects\" (Hume, Treatise; Nidditch edition, p11). The fundamental processes of association are responsible for the development of complex ideas out of simple ones.\n\nHumour: This is one of the defense mechanisms postulated by psychoanalytic theory, and recognised by the DSM-IV as belonging to the \"high adaptive\" defense level. It works by emphasising \"the amusing or ironic aspects of the conflict or stressor\" (p812).\n\nHurley, Susan L.: [British cognitive scientist ().] [Academic website] Hurley is noteworthy in the context of the present glossary for her work on mirror neurons and shared circuits.\n\nHusserl, Edmund: [German Phenomenologist philosopher (1859-1938).] [Click for external biography] The works analysed in this glossary are Logical Investigations (Husserl, 1900/2001) and Ideas (Husserl, 1913/1931). [See now consciousness, Husserl's theory of for the generalities, and the entries for act vs content debate, ego, ego cogito, eidetic singularity, function, genus, idea, immanent, intentionality (1), and intuition, for the specifics.]\n\nHyle: [<υλη> Greek = \"that out of which something is made; material, matter\".] See substance, and contrast morphe. Then see also hylomorphism.\n\nHyletic: See consciousness, Husserl's theory of.\n\nHyletic Phenomenology: See phenomenology, hyletic.\n\nHypercathexis: [See firstly cathexis.] This is the standard (i.e., Strachey) translation of Überbesetzung in Freud's Project and later writings. It indicates a system of neurons which, having been charged up with more than the normal amount of excitation (the result of trauma, say), has gone into a state of troublesome overload, threatening, consequently, to overwhelm the Ego's (often delicately balanced) defense mechanisms. The extent to which painful memories are then re-experienced depends on how effectively further defenses can be deployed relative to the strength of the overload. The physiological processes are simply an extension of those involved in cathexis in general, and may also be involved in the entirely non-emotional processes of attentional control.\n\nHyperconnectivity Model: [See firstly aggression, hearing voices and.] This is Beck and Rector's (2003) attempt to explain schizophrenic auditory hallucinations in terms of \"hypervalent\", or \"hot\", cognitions. The model incorporates a number of conceptual building blocks, as follows .....\n\n(1) Hyperactive Cognitions: The first important consideration when trying to understand the mechanisms of hallucination is to remember that the mind \"consists of suborganisations composed of representations embedded in cognitive schemas\" (p27). These representations are of external entities and the schemas organise recall from the confusion of available memories and memory types. Here is how the authors themselves see this arrangement in operation .....\n\n\"When any of the schemas is activated, it elicits a derivative cognition: a memory, a rule, an expectation. Externally oriented cognitions present as fears, predictions, and projected evaluations by others. Internally oriented cognitions assume the form of self-evaluations, self-control, self-commands and prohibitions, self-criticism, and self-praise. These kinds of cognitions occur normally in individuals but tend to be accentuated in the setting of psychopathology. They also often provide the content of hallucinations. When activated, the schemas play a role in information processing providing meaning to experiences. When hyperactive, they can preempt the central processing and produce interpretations (cognitions) that are congruent with their content rather than with external reality\" (Beck and Rector, 2003, p27).\n\n(2) Predisposition to Auditory Imaging: The next important consideration is to recognise that hallucinators have \"a special predilection\" (p28) for involuntary auditory hallucinations (although the explanation for this is far from apparent). There is, however, a mixed literature on the issue whether they are, or are not, deficient at voluntary auditory imaging. There have also been reports of a possible link to the phenomenon of inner speech. Here Beck and Rector mention a fMRI study by Shergill, Cameron, and Brammer (2001), which looked at the neural activity associated with auditory hallucinations. They reported that the pattern of said neural activity was \"remarkably similar\" to that seen in normal subjects asked to imagine another person talking to them. There was, however, reduced activity in the supplementary motor area when hallucinations were ongoing, which they speculated might be related to the lack of awareness that inner speech was being generated.\n\n(3) \"Perceptualisation\": This is Beck and Rector's answer to the question how internally originated phenomena might be experienced as identical to externally originated ones. They begin by pointing out that the process of perception is prone to \"gross distortion\" (p30) of reality in the best of us, and then point to a defect in allocating current excitation to internal or external sources.\n\n(4) Disinhibition: Beck and Rector then note that schizophrenics show differences in their ability to inhibit certain mental processes.\n\n(5) Externalising Bias: Hallucinators also appear to be unusually prone to attribute feedback of their own voice to an external source.\n\n(6) Deficient Reality Testing: The next problem to be overcome by the would-be hallucinator is to fail to detect that the perceptualised and externalised voices are in any way inconsistent. Beck and Rector here point out that psychotics are well known for having hypoactive [= weaker than normal] \"reality-testing tendencies\" (p35), and probably favour \"'easy' (but erroneous\" (p35) methods of information processing as a result. They illustrate what is at stake by contrasting the behaviour of hallucinators - which is to accept the hallucination more or less at face value - and those who hear sounds as the result of tinnitus - who go out of the way to validate their perception in some way.\n\n(7) Reasoning Biases: Another factor in predisposing people to auditory hallucinations is that they are curiously subject to circular reasoning of the following sort .....\n\n\"Another patient Hank heard voices that he attributed to the Knights of King Arthur's Round Table. Because he heard voices from the past, he inferred that he must have lived in the past. Consequently, because he lived in the past, this confirmed that the voices came from people in the past and consequently were real\" (Beck and Rector, 2003, p37).\n\n(8) Progression of Hot Thoughts to Voices: Finally, Beck and Rector note that hallucination-prone patients may have the same basic inner speech processes as normals, but only up to the point where inner speech shades into \"external voice\". Thus .....\n\n\"A woman, for example, was working on a manual project and became frustrated when she ran into difficulties. She thought, 'I can't do anything right. I'm a wimp.' Following this charged cognition, she heard a voice saying, 'You can't do anything right'. Because thoughts like these trigger an emotional response, they are often labelled 'hot cognitions'. Another patient, a man, had a different ultimate vocalised cognition after a frustration, 'But you will accomplish great things'\" (Beck and Rector, 2003, p39).\n\nHypersexuality: [See firstly differential diagnosis, psychiatric.] Clinically significant increases in sexual activity (to the extent that that judgment can actually successfully be made, for not all clinicians believe that it can, provided it has no underlying physical cause) is a clinical sign used in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, specifically the manic phase of the bipolar disorders [it is not, rather significantly, dealt with under the heading of sexual and gender identity disorders]. It has also been suggested that hypersexuality might productively be regarded as a coping behaviour which is somehow failing to deliver, or as a difficulty establishing and maintaining emotional intimacy (Mayo Clinic). As explained by the Mayo Clinic, \"many people who engage in compulsive sexual behaviour report a past history of sexual or physical abuse\", and use sex \"as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety, or stress\". The condition is characterised in a number of ways, including: having multiple sexual partners; excessive masturbation; engaging in sexual activity when stressed or depressed; exposing yourself in public; using pornography frequently.\n\nHyperthymia: [From the Greek \"heightened mood\".] This is a recently identified disorder not yet officially accepted into the DSM-IV. It consists of recurrent hypomanic episodes, not accompanied by depression.\n\nHypnosis: Hypnosis is \"artificially produced sleep; esp. that induced by hypnotism; the hypnotic state\" (O.E.D.). The term was coined by Braid (1843) as an alternative to Mesmerism.\n\nHypomania: Interpreted literally, hypomania is a sub-mania, that is to say, it displays many of the behaviours belong to full mania, but tends to fall short of disrupting everyday life. The distinguishing behaviours of a hypomanic episode include talking incessantly, feeling full of ideas, switchbacking between euphoria and irritability, being easily distracted, and being \"unusually friendly\" (Mind website). Hypomanic individuals are often difficult to help as friends, because they often respond with anger if anyone suggests they might have a problem. Beck (1967) describes hypomania this way .....\n\n\"The thought content is opposite that of depression. The dominant cognitive patterns are exaggerated ideas of personal abilities, minimisation of external obstacles, and overly optimistic expectations. These patterns lead to euphoria, to increased drive, and to overactivity\" (p270).\n\nHysteria: [See firstly hysterikos.] Historically speaking, hysteria was one of the first \"mental\" disorders ever to be documented and theorised about (the ancient Egyptians attributed it to a \"wandering uterus\"). It presents clinically as a dramatic physical dysfunction, capable of kicking in more or less instantaneously, and disabling the patient's normal interaction with the world. It is characterised by a loss of volitional control, showing itself in a number of possible objective signs, such as unconsciousness, emotional outbursts, heaviness of limb, cramps, convulsions, etc. Probably the earliest explanation of hysteria (and, indeed, any loss of identity or consciousness occurring in the absence of an obvious physical cause) would have been that it involved possession by demons. Ancient \"psychiatry\" was thus based on the warding off or casting out of the troublesome others from an otherwise blameless host, the process commonly known as \"exorcism\". It is convenient to focus on four separate aspects of the disorder, namely (a) whether there is a background \"hysterical personality\" of some sort, more than usually prone to this sort of breakdown, (b) the nature of the periods of acute attack, (c) the nature of the triggering events, and (d) what to do about it. The classical explanation for this package of symptoms was that the sufferer - always a woman - had an affliction of the womb [check this out]. Hippocrates's view of hysteria was as follows .....\n\n\"Hysteria was shrewdly considered by him to be due to the movement of the womb (hysteron) throughout the body. He antedated by two thousand years the modern findings of the place of sexuality in the neurosis. Although Hippocrates prescribed the traditional tight bandage around the abdomen for hysterical paroxysms, with fumigation by warm vapours conveyed through a funnel into the vagina, he astutely advised as a more practical remedy for hysteria 'to indulge the intentions of nature and to light the torch of Hymen [the Goddess of marriage - Ed.]'\" (Bromberg, 1954, p28).\n\nThe Middle Ages were never enlightened times, but the treatment of mental health disorders reached a new low in the late 15th century with the publication of Kramer and Sprenger's (1484) Malleus Maleficarum (\"The Witches' Hammer\"). Fathers Kramer and Sprenger - carrying their papers from Pope Innocent VIII as \"Inquisitors of heretical pravities\" - explicitly promoted the idea \"that women are closely allied to sin\" and that it was \"to the devil's advantage to encourage carnal pleasures\" (in Bromberg, 1954, p51). Unfortunately for the innocently neurotic and the politely confused, the signs of demonic possession overlapped in many key respects with those of witchcraft [one of the officially recognised signs of possession, for example, was that your disorder simply defied alternative diagnosis], and so for a long while psychiatry's treatment of choice was burning at the stake (in the patient's own best interests one hastens to add)! The burnings began at once, but in fact did not peak until the 1640s, when the arch-Puritan Matthew Hopkins - \"witch-finder general\" to the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War - whipped the populace up into a frenzy of Christian fundamentalism [tell me this story].\n\nASIDE: There is, of course, no shortage of witch-hunts in the modern world, as any NHS or civil service \"whistle-blower\" will confirm, nor is there any shortage of fundamentalist idiocy on offer either.\n\nSo powerful was the belief in witchcraft, indeed, that only slowly did the Enlightenment - when finally it did start to arrive - become properly enlightened. Bromberg notes, for example, that as late as 1769 the University of Edinburgh physician William Cullen, in his textbook of \"Physick\", was still actively having to dismiss the notion of demonic possession in mental disease. As Descartes had before him, Cullen recognised that there had to be some basic form of \"motion\" within the nervous system, and that this could therefore go wrong, but too little was known about the mind and soul. He coined the term \"neurosis\" to designate diseases not accompanied by fever, \"bad habit\" (such as scurvy), or focal lesion (such as cancer). Hysteria was thus a neurosis, rather than possession, and as to what caused it, Cullen sided with Hippocrates .....\n\n\"[Hysteria] affects the barren more than the breeding woman, and therefore frequently young widows ..... It occurs in those females who are liable to the nymphomania; and the nosologists [diagnosticians] have properly enough marked one of the varieties of the disease by the title Hysteria libidinosa. [.....] In what manner the uterus and in particular the ovaria ..... rise upwards to the brain so as to cause convulsions .... I cannot explain\" (Cullen, 1769, Physick; in Bromberg, 1954, p75).\n\nThe 18th century also saw the rise of the great \"mad-houses\". Bethlehem Hospital in London (the archetypal \"bedlam\") had been specialising in \"lunaticks\" (and other ne'er-do-wells such as beggars, prostitutes, and petty criminals) since 1547 and the Salpêtrière had been doing much the same in Paris since 1675. These were then joined by Norwich Bethel in 1713, the lunatic wards at Guy's Hospital in 1723, Manchester Asylum in 1766, and Newcastle Asylum in 1767, and, in the US, by Williamsburg Asylum, VA, in 1773, and Frankfort Asylum, PA, in 1817. But although physicians like Cullen were doing their best to be enlightened, they were not at the front line, and those that actually ran the institutions relied mainly on brutality and physical restraint. Then, in a short period of time now known as \"the humane period\", each of the asylums suddenly acquired its own relatively enlightened director. Pride of place is traditionally given to Philippe Pinel, who joined the Salpêtrière in 1792, and (ably assisted by Baptiste Pussin) freed its inmates of their chains - literally as well as figuratively. In Britain the key figures included William Tuke at York (1795), Charles Worth and Gardner Hill at Lincoln, and John Conolly at Hanwell. In America it was Benjamin Rush [whom we met in the entry for multiple personality, and who had studied as a young man under Cullen at Edinburgh]. One of the products of the humane period was the technique of hypnosis. The first \"modern\" student of hysteria was Jean-Martin Charcot, resident physician at the Salpêtrière Psychiatric Hospital, Paris, between 1862 and 1893. He had some 4000 female inmates at his disposal (Didi-Huberman, 2003), and simply described what he saw. He was also free to devise experimental new therapies, including hypnosis. Now one of Charcot's students during the winter of 1885-6 was a not-long-qualified Sigmund Freud, and so impressed was he with Charcot's use of hypnosis that he and his colleague Josef Breuer adopted the technique themselves. The essence of their method was to use a hypnotic state to get back to the patient's suppressed memories of some earlier trauma, and the two men published their results in Studien über Hysterie (\"Studies on Hysteria\") (Freud and Breuer, 1895). Here is an indicative extract .....\n\n\"For we found, to our great surprise at first, that each individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bringing clearly into the light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect, and when the patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into words\" (Breuer and Freud, 1893, in Freud and Breuer, 1895, p57).\n\nThe main theoretical coverage of the new technique was in Breuer's Part III of the book. Here he reviews the main points to be reflected upon, including whether hysterical phenomena are wholly ideogenic, the physical pathways and mechanisms involved, the role of symbolism in the association of ideas, the nature of the hypnoid state and the transitions into and out of it, and the nature of the unconscious ideas which were doing the damage. And one factor turned out to be especially puzzling in its own right, even to the extent of helping to define the essence of the disorder. Here is Breuer himself on this .....\n\n\"We call those ideas conscious which we are aware of. [..... But w]hat seems hard to understand is how an idea can be sufficiently intense to provoke a lively motor act, for instance, and at the same time not intense enough to become conscious\" (Breuer, 1895, in Freud and Breuer, pp300-302).\n\nThe explanation, Breuer suggests, is that the conscious element gets \"converted\" (p302) into somatic stimuli. This would allow the ideas which triggered the acute episodes to not be recognised as such by the patient, and it was to bring this causal link to consciousness that the method of hypnosis was used. The neurologist Pierre Janet also specialised in the hysterias, and he, too, emphasised the defining role of somehow-badly-managed ideation in the disorder .....\n\n\"The first psychological notion that appears to me to result with the greatest clearness from all the contemporary works is a notion relative to the importance of ideas in certain hysterical accidents. Charcot, studying the paralyses, had shown that the disease is not produced by a real accident, but by the idea of this accident. [..... I]deas have a greater importance, and, above all, a greater bodily action than with the normal man. They seem to penetrate more deeply into the organism, and to bring about motor and visceral modifications. [.....] 'What characterises hystericals,' [Mathier and Roux] said, 'is less the fact of accepting some idea or other than the action exercised by this idea on their stomachs or intestines.' [..... Other workers] have repeated [.....] quite similar definitions. 'A phenomenon is hysterical,' said Babinski, 'when it can be produced through suggestion and "
