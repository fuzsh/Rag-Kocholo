        "text": "What Does Gestalt Mean?\n\nIn a loose translation, the German word ‘Gestalt’ (pronounced “ge-shtalt”) means ‘configuration’, or ‘structure’. It makes a reference to the way individual components are structured by our perception as a psychical whole (Wulf, 1996). That structure provides a scientific explanation for why changes in spacing, organization and timing can radically transform how information is received and assimilated.\n\nHow the Gestalt Approach Formed?\n\nTwo of the main philosophical influences of Gestalt are Kantian epistemology and Husserl’s phenomenological method.\n\nBoth Kant and Husserls sought to understand human consciousness and perceptions of the world, arguing that those mental processes are not entirely mediated by rational thought (Jorge, 2010).\n\nSimilarly, the Gestalt researchers Wertheimer, Koffka and Kohler observed that the human brain tends to automatically organize and interpret visual data through grouping.\n\nThey theorized that, because of those “mental shortcuts”, the perception of the whole is different from the sum of individual elements.\n\nThis idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts – the central tenet of Gestalt psychology – challenged the then-prevailing theory of Structuralism.\n\nThis school of thought defended that mental processes should be broken down into their basic components, to focus on them individually.\n\nStructuralists believed that complex perceptions could be understood by identifying the primitive sensations it caused – such as the points that make a square or particular pitches in a melody.\n\nGestalt, on the other hand, suggests the opposite path. It argues that the whole is grasped even before the brain perceives the individual parts – like when, looking at a photograph, we see the image of a face rather than a nose, two eyes, and the shape of a chin.\n\nTherefore, to understand the subjective nature of human perception, we should transcend the specific parts to focus on the whole.\n\nGestalt Psychologists\n\nMax Wertheimer\n\nThe inaugural article of Gestalt Psychology was Max Wertheimer’s Experimental Studies of the Perception of Movement, published in 1912.\n\nWertheimer, then at the Institute of Psychology in Frankfurt am Main, described a visual illusion called apparent motion in this article.\n\nApparent motion is the perception of movement that results from viewing a rapid sequence of static images, as happens in the movies or in flip books.\n\nWertheimer realized that the perception of the whole (the group of figures in a sequence) was radically different from the perception of its components (each static image).\n\nWolfgang Köhler\n\nWolfgang Köhler was particularly interested in physics and natural sciences. He introduced the concept of psychophysical isomorphism – arguing that how a stimulus is received is influenced by the brain’s general state while perceiving it (Shelvock, 2016).\n\nHe believed that organic processes tend to evolve to a state of equilibrium – like soap bubbles, that start in various shapes but always change into perfect spheres because that is their minimum energy state.\n\nIn the same way, the human brain would “converge” towards a minimum energy state through a process of simplifying perception – a mechanism that he called Pragnanz (Rock & Palmer, 1990).\n\nKurt Koffka\n\nKoffka contributed to expanding Gestalt applications beyond visual perception. In his major article, Principles of Gestalt psychology (1935) he detailed the application of the Gestalt Laws to topics such as motor action, learning and memory, personality and society.\n\nHe also played a key role in taking the Gestalt Theory to the United States, to where he emigrated after the rise of Nazism in Germany.\n\nGestalt principles\n\nGestalt’s principles, or Laws of Perception, were formalized by Wertheimer in a treaty published in 1923, and further elaborated by Köhler, Koffka, and Metzger.\n\nThe principles are grounded on the human natural tendency of finding order in disorder – a process that happens in the brain, not in the sensory organs such as the eye. According to Wertheimer, the mind “makes sense” of stimulus captured by the eyes following a predictable set of principles.\n\nThe brain applies these principles to enable individuals to perceive uniform forms rather than simply collections of unconnected images.\n\nAlthough these principles operate in a predictable way, they are actually mental shortcuts to interpreting information. As shortcuts, they sometimes make mistakes – and that is why they can lead to incorrect perceptions.\n\nPrägnanz (law of simplicity)\n\nThe law of Prägnanz is also called “law of simplicity” or “law of good figure”. It states that when faced with a set of ambiguous or complex objects, the human brain seeks to make them as simple as possible.\n\nThe “good figure” is an object or image that can easily be perceived as a whole.\n\nA good example of this process is our perception of the Olympic logo. We tend to see overlapping circles (the simpler version) rather than a series of curved, connected lines (Dresp-Langley, 2015).\n\nSimilarity\n\nThis law suggests that we tend to group shapes, objects or design elements that share some similarity in terms of color, shape, orientation, texture or size.\n\nProximity\n\nThe law of proximity states that shapes, objects or design elements located near each other tend to be perceived as a group.\n\nConversely, randomly located items tend to be perceived as isolated.\n\nThis principle can be applied to direct attention to key elements within a design: the closer visual elements are to each other, the more likely they will be perceived as related to each other, and too much negative space between elements serve to isolate them from one another.\n\nCommon Region\n\nThis law proposes that elements that are located within the same closed region – such as inside a circle or a shape – tend to be perceived as belonging to the same group.\n\nThose clearly defined boundaries between the inside and the outside of a shape create a stronger connection between elements, and can even overpower the law of Proximity or of Similarity.\n\nContinuity\n\nThis law argues that shapes, objects or design elements that are positioned in a way that suggests lines, curves or planes will be perceived as such, and not as individual elements.\n\nWe perceptually group the elements together to form a continuous image.\n\nClosure\n\nThis law suggests that the human brain has a natural tendency to visually close gaps in forms, particularly when identifying familiar images.\n\nWhen information is missing, our focus goes to what is present and automatically “fills” the missing parts with familiar lines, colors or patterns.\n\nOnce a form has been identified, even if additional gaps are introduced, we still tend to visually complete the form, in order to make them stable.\n\nIBM’s iconic logo is one example of applied closure – blue horizontal lines are arranged in three stacks that we “close” to form the letterforms (Graham 2008).\n\nThe classic gestalt principles have been extended in various directions. The ones above are some of the most commonly cited, but there are others, such as the symmetry principle (symmetrical components will tend to be grouped together) and the common faith principle (elements tend to be perceived as grouped together if they move together).\n\nApplications of Gestalt\n\nGestalt Psychology and the Laws of Perception influenced research from a multitude of disciplines – including linguistic, design, architecture and visual communication.\n\nGestalt Legacy\n\nMost psychologists consider that the Gestalt School, as a theoretical field of study, died with its founding fathers in the 1940s. Two main reasons may have contributed to that decline.\n\nThe first reason are institutional and personal constraints: after they left Germany, Wetheimer, Koffka and Köhler obtained positions in which they could conduct research, but could not train PhDs.\n\nAt the same time, most of the students and researchers that had remained in Germany broadened the scope of their research beyond Gestalt topics.\n\nThe second reason for the decline of Gestalt Psychology were empirical findings dismantling Köhler’s electrical field theory that sought to explain the brain’s functioning.\n\nNeuroscience and cognitive science emerged in the 1960s as stronger frameworks for explaining the functioning of the brain.\n\nStill, nearly all psychology students can expect to find at least one chapter dedicated to Gestalt Psychology in their textbooks.\n\nSimilarly, fundamental questions about the subjective nature of perception and awareness are still addressed in contemporary scientific research – with the perks of counting on advanced methods that were not available for the Gestaltists in the first half of the XX Century (Wagemans et al, 2012).\n\nReferences\n\nBerryman, G.
