When the first volume of A History of Psychology in Autobiography appeared in 1930 psychologists found it interesting. Its readers for the most part were familiar with the writings of the men and women who spoke through its pages; often they knew the biographers personally or had at least listened to them, and they profited from seeing how the owner of an important name regarded his own work and what importance he assigned to events that appeared to have shaped his life. When first written, these stories lay, nevertheless, almost in the present, for-except in the speculation about how childhood forms a manan intellectual autobiography that covers forty years does not consider that it is speaking of the past until much later. Now, however, thirty years have gone by since those first three volumes of 1930-1936 were published, and the lives described in them are now history-recent history, to be sure, but long enough ago for psychologists to send their students to sense in these accounts the attitudes of an earlier generation and the atmosphere in which it thrived, the spirit of a time when psychology was smaller, less complex and more intimate. How the value of present effort increases with time becomes evident when one examines the table at the end of this preface. There you see the ages of the contributors to this series and the dates of their deaths. Of the fifty-eight psychologists who contributed to the first four volumes, only five are still living. Of the forty-three who wrote for the first three volumes only one is left-Sir Frederic Bartlett. It is necessary to get these personal records before mortality intervenes, yet not before the lives described are approaching completion. The present committee has lost Heinz Werner, who died after accepting our invitation to contribute, but we are fortunate in being able to include Kurt Goldstein, who completed his biography before he died. Three other psychologists (Heymans, Hoffding, de Sanctis ) died before the volume containing their contributions could be published, and three others (Calkins, Zwaardemaker, Hull) died in the year of publication. Yet all in all the great men and women of psychology have been a hardy lot. Of the fifty-four contributors who have passed on at the date of this v\n\nvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nwntmg only one, Woodworth, reached the 90's. The youngest to die was Klemm at 54, and the next youngest was Franz at 59. The median age of these autobiographers at death is at present between 77 and 79, in between Drever and Terman. Two were in their 50's, eleven in their 60's, fifteen in their 70's, twenty-five in their 80's, and one in his 90's. At the end of the 1920's, when the new historians of the still new psychology were complaining that insufficient information was available about the lives, and thus the motivations, of the eponyms whom it was their task to describe, the present series was begun by Carl Murchison and the Clark University Press. At the time, the committee asked that the contributors tell of the motivations that guided them in their professional careers, not fully realizing in the then unformed state of motivational psychology how little a man knows correctly of his own motivations. When, after a lapse caused first by the exhaustion of the pool of sufficiently mature prominent psychologists and then by the distraction of World War II, the project was revived twenty years later, the invitation was changed to stress conscious motivation less and the events of the life more. Here follows an excerpt from the Preface of Volume IV, published in 1952: The reader of this volume will see how much our autobiographers differ from one another in the nature of their efforts. Perhaps they differ most in the degree with which they find unity in their lives. Presumably everyone of them would like to see his intellectual history as the evolution of a single purpose, for integrity is good and simplicity is elegant. No one, of course, fully succeeds in this undertaking, for the story of every life is constrained by the exigencies of its owner's environment. Some of these accounts are more intellectualistic than others, and it may be that they show the greater unity, either because some irrelevancies are omitted from the life history or because irrelevancies are actually, at least to a certain degree, omitted from the actual living. Other accounts are more environmentalistic, because social and institutional events and accidents have figured so largely in them. The environmentalistic autobiographer may have had a chief long-term goal, have pursued it, have achieved it with some fair degree of success, yet he may feel that the unforeseeable accidents of living have determined much of his life and have perhaps even altered his goal. The intellectualist, if such we may call him, may, on the other hand, have suffered disruption of plans less than his colleague, but it is probable that he has also been less interested in the effect of external forces upon himself. No one, not even the members of this group of distinguished psychologists, can hope to deal adequately with the springs of his motivation. What he tells about himself and what he shows about his values can, however, go far toward instructing the reader as to how human motive moves to make science progress. The accidents of living do not always seem irrelevant to progress when they operate in the manner shown in the pages of this book. Psychology in autobiography cannot be complete, but it can make a contribution to the history of psychology which is unique.\n\nPREFACE\n\nvii\n\nHere follows an excerpt from the invitation to contributors to the present volume. It is an extension and modification of the instruction for 1952. The important decisions in regard to the contents of your autobiography are yours. We hope, however, that the document will devote some attention to the historical details of your life. In connection with the facts of life, we hope you will identify yourself with regard to such matters as place and date of birth, significant educational and professional experiences, and family. We are, of course, particularly interested in the intellectual and professional aspects of your life as they have influenced and been influenced by events, ideas, and persons in and out of the field of psychology. Your perception of major developments and issues within psychology during your lifetime and your relation to these events will be of special importance. We should appreciate any discussion of your feelings, motives, and aspirations or of significant events that would increase the reader's understanding of you and your contributions to psychology. In brief, we are interested in your intellectual life history, but at the same time we feel that it should be illuminated by as much information about your personal background and inner motives as you are ready and able to divulge.\n\nConsiderable pressure has been put upon the committee to include a complete bibliography of the contributors. Complete bibliographies for such men as these would run from 100 to more than 500 citations apiece. Psychologists look wistfully at Murchison's Psychological Register of 1932 and hope for its updating, but neither that nor the inclusion of bibliographies here is practicable. The committee has space for only fifteen biographies of 12,000 words each, and it would have to decrease this number to add the bibliographies. Also, there would be duplication, for complete bibliographies are often published elsewhere for distinguished psychologists. The memoirs of academies sometimes include them. There are, moreover, already available some fairly complete bibliographies of psychologists whose publications have been listed in the Psychological Index and in Psychological Abstracts from 1894 to 1958; they are in the Author Index to those two serials published in four volumes in 1960 by C. K. Hall and Company of Boston. Why are only Americans included as contributors in the present volume? The early volumes were divided approximately in the proportion of eight Americans to seven Europeans. Of course psychology was then and is even more now predominantly American; the language of this book is English and its character American. Nevertheless the present committee began with the expectation that its American character would be assured by our choosing those foreigners who had made an impression upon American thought in psychology, the Europeans or others who appeared as most important in the United States even if not in their own countries. We did indeed correspond with some Europeans and quite early met with two declinations, but the crucial desideratum that fixed our decision was the great scarcity of psychologists in Europe and elsewhere who had notably influenced the thinking of\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nAmerican psychologists, who had not already contributed to a previous volume, and who were over 60 years old. Let the critic who suspects us of xenophobia try naming a few psychologists, foreign to America, who meet these three specifications. On the other hand, this committee, whose authority ceases with the publication of this volume, looks forward hopefully to a Volume VI that will again be truly international. With the multiplication of psychologists on six continents it becomes more difficult to choose the outstanding names than it was when psychology seemed limited to Western Europe, Great Britain, and America, but the discrimination should not be impossible. In the first four volumes sixty-one psychologists were invited to contribute and only three declined (Cattell, Lashley, and Kohler). For the present volume eventually we asked twenty-two psychologists. Werner died. Three would have liked to participate but had too many commitments for even our deferred deadline. They thought that if they could be asked early for a Vol ume VI, they could accept. Three others declined for personal reasons. The present committee was formed by accretion. The idea of reviving the series began with Lindzey, who secured the agreement of Appleton-CenturyCrofts to undertake the publication. Boring, who has been on all five of the committees and had conducted the negotiation with President Jefferson of Clark University for the transfer of the rights from Clark University to Appleton-Century-Crofts, agreed to act as chairman if Lindzey would be Executive Officer. The Committee is grateful to President Jefferson and Clark University for relinquishing these rights in the interests of this historical and scientific enterprise. l\\1acCorquodale was included because of his long association with Lindzey and Appleton-Century-Crofts in the editing of the Century Psychology Series. Wapner was a natural continuation of the Clark ancestry for the series. Werner at Clark had been a member of the previous committee. Newbrough and Sharp had on their own initiative been conducting a poll of psychologists to assess the desirability of reviving the series. Clearly it was best to fuse the two enterprises. The American Psychological Association was asked to sponsor the undertaking, as it had Volume IV, appointing a new committee if it deemed wise, but it declined, believing that the present committee did not need its help. Nevertheless we felt that our committee could profit from more intelligence, so we added Beach and Hobbs to our membership. This committee has prepared the present volume, but it is not self-perpetuating. We believe, however, that Lindzey will be an adequate care-taker for the interests of the series between volumes. Especially must we mention the indispensable assistance of Miss Leslie Segner in the final preparation of the manuscript for publication. We thank the contributors. They will receive no royalties but we hope they find satisfaction in this bit of immortality that it is possible for us to give them. They have now gained posterity for an audience, and long years\n\nix\n\nPREFACE\n\nafter they are gone they can still be speaking to the strange new psychologists who will be their intellectual descendants.

This dictum, savoring as it does of idealism and romanticism, is alien to the Lockean image of man that dominates Anglo-American psychology. And yet I confess I am attracted to this proposition. It seems to state in a broad way a testable hypothesis. One might say that my own personal idea is to discover whether such broad hypotheses concerning the nature of man arc empirically viable-at least as viable as the associationistic and reactive hypotheses that today govern the American psychological outlook. Although I suspect that Bergson exaggerates the potential unity of human personality, I also think that he, as well as other Leibnitzian, neo-Kantian, and existential writers, sets a challenge to empirical psychology; and that something should be done to test these views. The philosophy of man and the psychology of man should be brought to confront one another. Let me suggest some relevant empirical questions. How shall a psychological life history be written? What processes and what structures must a full-bodied account of personality include? How can one detect unifying threads in a life, if they exist? The greater part of my own professional work can be viewed as an attempt to answer such questions through piecemeal and stepwise research and writing. If my theoretical writings exceed in bulk my output of research, it is because of my conviction that significant, not trivial, questions must be posed before we lose ourselves in a frenzy of investigation. In 1940 I assigned my Harvard seminar the problem \"How shall a psychological life history be written?\" The seminar included the following members: Jerome Bruner, Dorwin Cartwright, Norman Polansky, John R. P. French, Alfred Baldwin, John Harding, Dwight Fiske, Donald McGranahan, Henry Riecken, Robert' White, and Freed Bales. I mention their names because it seems to me that while these scholars have pursued diversified and distinguished careers, much of their subsequent creative work has been broadly relevant to the topic of the seminar. We did not succeed in our self-imposed task. It is true that we designed a set of rules and composed cases to fit the rules, but at the end we were 3\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\n4\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\ndistressed by the hollowness of the product. Our abortive rules were never published, yet from the seminar issued several important published researches, some of them summarized in my monograph The Use of Personal Documents in Psychological Science (1942). I still do not know how a psychological life history should be written. And here I am, faced ironically enough with the assignment of writing my own psychological vita. Lacking a method I shall have to bumble along as best I can, hoping that psychologists of the future will learn how such an assignment should be carried through.\n\n1897-1915 Every autobiographer finds his own genealogy of captivating interest and knows that his family relationships are of highest explanatory importance. But the reader is likely to find the same material dull-something to be tolerated because it ought to be relevant. The writer has great difficulty showing the reader just what is relevant, and where and why. He himself does not know how to separate primary formative influences in his heredity and early environment from those that are of minor or negligible significance. My own account will be as brief as possible. Father was a country doctor who learned his profession after a career in business and after having a family of three sons. I, the fourth and last of the family, was born November 11, 1897, in Montezuma, Indiana, where my father had set up his first medical practice. My mother and I were, I believe, his first patients. Soon afterward he moved his practice to Streetsboro and to Hudson in Ohio. Before I started school he moved again to Glenville (Cleveland), where I had the advantage of twelve years of sound and uninterrupted schooling. Since my brothers were considerably older (Harold, nine years; Floyd, seven years; Fayette, five years) I fashioned my own circle of activities. It was a select circle, for I never fitted the general boy assembly. 1 was quick with words, poor at games. When I was ten a schoolmate said of me, \"Aw, that guy swallowed a dictionary.\" But even as an \"isolate\" I contrived to be the \"star\" for a small cluster of friends. Our family for several generations had lived in rural New York State. My paternal grandfather was a farmer, my maternal grandfather a cabinetmaker and Civil War veteran. My father, John Edwards Allport (born 1863), was of pure English descent; my mother, Nellie Edith Wise (born 1862), was of German and Scottish descent. Our home life was marked by plain Protestant piety and hard work. My mother had been a school teacher and brought to her sons an eager sense of philosophical questing and the importance of searching for ultimate religious answers. Since my father lacked adequate hospital facilities for his\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\n5\n\npatients, our household for several years included both patients and nurses. Tending office, washing bottles, and dealing with patients were important aspects of my early training. Along with his general practice my father engaged in many enterprises: founding a cooperative drug company, building and renting apartments, and hnally developing a new specialty of building and supervising hospitals. I mention his versatility simply to underscore the fact that his four sons were trained in the practical urgencies of life as well as in a broad humanitarian outlook. Dad was no believer in vacations. He followed rather his own rule of life, which he expressed as follows: \"If every person worked as hard as he could and took only the minimum Iinancial return required by his family's needs, then there would be just enough wealth to go around.\" Thus it was hard work tempered by trust and affection that marked the home environment. Except for this generally wholesome foundation, I cannot identify any formative influence of special importance until after my graduation from Glenville High School in 1915, at which time I stood second highest in a class of 100. Apparently I was a good routine student, but definitely uninspired and uncurious about anything beyond the usual adolescent concerns. Graduation suddenly brought up the problem of further schooling. Wisely my father insisted that I take a summer to learn typing at a business college-a skill I have endlessly prized. During this period my brother Floyd who had graduated from Harvard in 1913 suggested that I apply there. It was late to do so, but I was hnally admitted after squeezing through the entrance tests given in Cambridge in early September. Then came an experience of intellectual dawn.\n\n1915-1924 Did ever a Midwestern lad receive a greater impact from \"going East to college\"? I doubt it. Almost overnight my world was remade. My basic moral values, to be sure, had been fashioned at horne. What was new was the horizon of intellect and culture I was now invited to explore. The undergraduate years (1915-1919) brought a welter of new influences. First and most important was the pervading sense of high standards. Harvard simply assumed, or so it seemed to me, that excellence should prevail. At the first hour examinations I received an array of D's and C's. Profoundly shattered, I stiffened my efforts and ended the year with A's. As a prize I was awarded a detur (what might that be?) in the form of a de luxe edition of Marius, the Epicurean (who was he?). In the course of hfty years' association with Harvard I have never ceased to admire the unspoken expectation of excellence. One should perform at the highest level of which one is capable, and one is given full freedom to do so. Although all my courses were valuable to me, my focus was soon directed toward psychology and\n\n6\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nsocial ethics. Taken together these two disciplines framed my later career. Miinsterberg, looking like Wotan, was my first teacher in psychology. My brother Floyd, a graduate student, was his assistant. From Munsterberg's guttural lectures and from his textbook Psychology: General and Applied (1914), I learned little except that \"causal\" psychology was not the same as \"purposive\" psychology. The blank page dividing the two corresponding sections of the textbook intrigued me. Could they not be reconciled and fused? I wondered. Harry l\\1urray had also started to study with Miinsterberg. In \"What Should Psychologists Do About Psychoanalysis?\" (1940), he reports that he was so revolted by the chill of Munsterberg's approach that he fled to the nearest exit, thereby retarding by several years the choice of his later profession. Meat for me was poison for l\\1urray. The question arises then: What is a \"good\" teacher? I drew nourishment from Munsterberg's dualistic dilemma as well as from his pioneer work in applied psychology. Soon I found myself taking courses with Edwin B. Holt, Leonard Troland. \\N alter Dearborn, and Ernest Southard. Experimental psychology I took with Herbert Langfeld and my brother. Between times and out of hours I gained much from my brother's more mature reflections on the problems and methods of psychology. He invited me to serve as a subject in his own researches on social influence. Munsterberg had persuaded him to follow the Moede tradition and discover the differences resulting from the performance of tasks in groups and alone. World War I dislocated my program only slightly. As an inductee in the Students' Army Training Corps I was allowed to continue my courses (with sanitary engineering and map-making added). Even at our training camp I prepared, with Langfeld's encouragement, reports on psychological aspects of rifle practice. Although my contribution was sophomoric, the assignment was beneficial. The Armistice was signed on my twenty-first birthday, November II, 1918. Demobilization and a return to my chosen program followed rapidly. At commencement, 1919, I received my A.B. degree, and Floyd received his Ph.D. A final line of undergraduate influence came through my studies in the Department of Social Ethics, chiefly with James Ford, and especially from the accompanying field training and volunteer social service which heavily engaged my interest. All through college I conducted a boys' club in the West End of Boston. At various times I did volunteer visiting for the Family Society and served as volunteer probation officer. During one summer I held a paid job with the Humane Society of Cleveland; during another I worked for Professor Ford as field agent for the registration of homes for war workers in crowded industrial cities of the East. At the Phillips Brooks House I held a paid job as executive of the committee to assist foreign students and as secretary of the Cosmopolitan Club. All this social service was deeply satisfying, partly because it gave me a feeling of competence (to offset a\n\nGORDON W. ALLPORT\n\n7\n\ngeneralized inferiority feeling) and partly because I found I liked to help people with their problems. This social service interval reflected my search for personal identity. It blended also with my attempt to achieve a mature religious position. Like many undergraduates I was in the process of replacing childhood conceptions of doctrine with some sort of humanitarian religion. A few years later, however, I reacted against this essentially Unitarian position because it seemed to me that to exalt one's own intellect and affirm only a precarious man-made set of values cheapened the whole quest. Humility and some mysticism, I felt, were indispensable for me; otherwise I would be victimized by my own arrogance. Arrogance in psychological theorizing has always antagonized me; I believe it is better to be tentative, eclectic, and humble. My two lines of study gradually merged into an important conviction. If one were to do effective social service, one needed a sound conception of human personality. Sound theory must underlie application. This conviction was clearly expressed later in my Ph.D. thesis, which was titled \"An Experimental Study of the Traits of Personality: With Special Reference to the Problem of Social Diagnosis.\" This, of course, was an early formulation of the riddle: How shall a psychological life history be written? After graduation I had no clear idea what I should do. Vaguely I felt that social service administration might be a better line for me than teaching. But an opportunity came to give teaching a trial. For one year I taught English and sociology at Robert College in Constantinople during the last gasp of the Sultan's reign (1919-1920). I greatly enjoyed the year-its freedom and novelty and sense of achievement. When by cable I was offered a fellowship for graduate study at Harvard I knew that teaching was not such a bad career for me, and I accepted the opportunity. Two life-long friendships were formed at Robert College-one with the family of Dean Bradlee Watson, who later became professor of dramatic literature at Dartmouth and our son's godfather; the other with Edwin Powers, later Deputy Commissioner of Correction for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. En route from Constantinople to Cambridge, an event of pungent significance occurred, namely, my one and only encounter with Sigmund Freud. I have told the story many times but it must be repeated, for it had the character of a traumatic developmental episode. My brother Fayette was at that time in the United States trade commission in Vienna. It was during the period of Hoover relief activities. My brother invited me to stop for a visit. With a callow forwardness characteristic of age twenty-two, I wrote to Freud announcing that I was in Vienna and implied that no doubt he would be glad to make my acquaintance. I received a kind reply in his own handwriting inviting me to come to his office at a certain time. Soon after I had entered the famous red burlap room with pictures of dreams on the\n\n8\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nwall, he summoned me to his inner office. He did not speak to me but sat in expectant silence, for me to state my mission. I was not prepared for silence and had to think fast to find a suitable conversational gambit. I told him of an episode on the tram car on my way to his office. A small boy about four years of age had displayed a conspicuous dirt phobia. He kept saying to his mother, \"I don't want to sit there ... don't let that dirty man sit beside me.\" To him everything was sch1Jlut::ig. His mother was a well-starched Hausfrau, so dominant and purposive looking that I thought the cause and effect apparent. When I finished my story Freud fixed his kindly therapeutic eyes upon me and said, \"And was that little boy you?\" Flabbergasted and feeling a bit guilty, I contrived to change the subject. While Freud's misunderstanding of my motivation was amusing, it also started a deep train of thought. I realized that he was accustomed to neurotic defenses and that my manifest motivation (a sort of rude curiosity and youthful ambition) escaped him. For therapeutic progress he would have to cut through my defenses, but it so happened that therapeutic progress was not here an issue. This experience taught me that depth psychology, for all its merits, may plunge too deep, and that psychologists would do well to give full recognition to manifest motives before probing the unconscious. Although I never regarded myself as anti-Freudian, I have been critical of psychoanalytic excesses. A later paper entitled \"The Trend in Motivational Theory\" (1953) is a direct reflection of this episode and has been reprinted, I believe, more frequently than any other of my articles. Let me add that the better balanced view of motivation expressed in later neo-Freudian, ego psychology is more to my taste. Back at Harvard I found that the requirements for the Ph. D. degree were not stiff (not nearly stiff enough); and so with only two years' additional course work, a few examinations, and the thesis, I qualified for this degree in 1922 at the age of twenty-four. McDougall had joined the staff and was one of the readers of my thesis, along with Langfeld and James Ford. During this period Floyd, an instructor, was editing Morton Prince's Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. I helped him with the work, thus making an early acquaintance with the journal I myself was later to edit (1937-1948). During this period I suffered from vocational misgivings. Unlike most of my student colleagues I had no giftedness in natural science, mathematics, mechanics (laboratory manipulations), nor in biological or medical specialties. Most of the psychologists I admired had competence in some adjuvant field. I confessed my misgivings about my fitness to Professor Langfeld. In his laconic way he remarked, \"But you know there are many branches of psychology.\" I think this casual remark saved me. In effect he was encouraging me to find my own way in the humanistic pastures of psychology.\n\nGORDON W. ALLPORT\n\n9\n\nBut did I have enough courage and ability to develop my deviant interests? No other psychologist, at least at Harvard, seemed to be interested in social values as an academic problem nor in developing a lifelike psychology of personality. Indeed the available relevant work included not much more than a few early studies by June Downey (Wyoming), Walter Fernald (Concord Reformatory), and R. S. Woodworth (Columbia), who during the war had devised his \"Personal Data Sheet,\" an early pencil-and-paper personality test. I believe that my own thesis was perhaps the first American dissertation written explicitly on the question of component traits of personality. It led to my maiden publication (with my brother) entitled \"Personality Traits: Their Classification and Measurement\" (1921). In this connection I may add that I suspect my own course given at Harvard in 1924 and 1925, titled \"Personality: Its Psychological and Social Aspects,\" was probably the first course on the subject offered in an American college. Standing at a frontier was a somewhat alarming business. The climax of my conflict came in connection with my single encounter with Titchener. I had been invited to attend the select gathering of his group of experimentalists, which met at Clark University in May, 1922, just as I was finishing my thesis. After two days of discussing problems in sensory psychology Titchener allotted three minutes to each visiting graduate to describe his own investigations. I reported on traits of personality and was punished by the rebuke of total silence from the group, punctuated by a glare of disapproval from Titchener. Later Titchener demanded of Langfeld, \"Why did you let him work on that problem?\" Back in Cambridge Langfeld again consoled me with the laconic remark, \"You don't care what Titchener thinks.\" And I found that I did not. The whole experience was a turning point. Never since that time have I been troubled by rebukes or professional slights directed at my maverick interests. Later, of course, the field of personality became not only acceptable but highly fashionable. But, although the field itself became legitimate, my own theoretical position was not always approved. I have implied that my graduate years at Harvard were not particularly productive intellectually. They did, however, lead to two benefits over and beyond the degree. Within the congenial circle of graduate students I found my future wife, Ada Lufkin Gould, a Boston girl, who, after taking her master's degree, worked in the field of clinical psychology. Our interests were closely parallel. I was also awarded by Harvard a Sheldon Traveling Fellowship, which gave me two years in Europe. For me these years were a second intellectual dawn. ' The German tradition in psychology was still strong in America, although Germany itself had been flattened by World War I and inflation. It was only natural for me to head for Germany. William James and E. B. Titchener had immortalized in their textbooks the Teutonic foundations of\n\n10\n\nA HISTORY\n\nOF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nour science, and my own teachers had studied there. From Harvard philosophers R. B. Perry and R. F. A. Hoernle, I had gained further respect for German thought. I was not prepared, however, for the powerful impact of my German teachers who included the aged Stumpf and Dessoir, the younger Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler, and Eduard Spranger in Berlin, and in Hamburg, William Stern and Heinz Werner. A fellow student was Heinrich Kluver, who helped me with my halting German, and who has remained a cherished friend ever since even though our paths of psychological interest have diverged. At that time Gestalt was a new concept. I had not heard of it before leaving Cambridge. It took me some weeks to discover why my teachers usually started their two-hour lectures with a castigation of David Hume. Soon I learned he was the natural whipping boy for the German structural schools of thought. Canzheit and Gestalt, Struktur and Lehenformen, and die unteilhare Person were new music to my ears. Here was the kind of psychology I had been longing for but did not know existed. Of course I realized that romanticism in psychology could poison its scientific soil. (I myself had been brought up in the Humean tradition.) At the same time it seemed to me that the high quality of experimental studies by the Gestalt school, the original empirical investigations at Stern's Institute, and the brilliance of the Lewinian approach (which I came to know at second hand) gave safe anchorage to the kinds of concepts that I found congenial. Thus Germany gave me support for the structural view of personality that I had pieced together for myself. For the American Journal of Psychology I wrote a brief Bericht, \"The Leipzig Congress of Psychology\" (1923), outlining the various German movements that reflected the Strukturhegriff: Gestalt, Stern's Personalistik, Krueger's complex qualities, and the school of Verstehen. From Stern in particular I learned that a chasm exists between the common variety of differential psychology (which he himself had largely invented along with the concept of the IQ) and a truly personalistic psychology that focuses upon the organization, not the mere profiling, of an individual's traits. I became acquainted also with German doctrines of types. Among them were the elaborate speculations and investigations of E. R. Jaensch on eidetic imagery. I ventured to replicate some of his work a year later while in Cambridge, England. Three papers resulted: \"Eidetic Imagery\" (1924), \"The Eidetic Image and the After-image\" (1928), and \"Change and Decay in the Visual Memory Image\" (1930). Later I was horrified by Jaensch's prostitution of his scientific work to provide psychological underpinning for Nazi doctrine. His paranoid efforts explained to me some of the weaker portions of his earlier eidetic theory. The year in England was spent largely in absorbing my German ex-\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\nII\n\nperiences. Professor Frederic Bartlett was courteous in providing me with facilities for work. Ivor A. Richards invited me to contribute a paper on \"The Standpoint of Gestalt Psychology\" to Psyche (1924); but I confess I chiefly ruminated on my German year and enjoyed myself by studying Faust with Professor Breue!. Thus did my years of formal training come to an end. A cable from Professor Ford offered me an instructorship in social ethics at Harvard to begin in the fall of 1924. Besides taking over his course on social problems and social policy, I was invited to offer a new course in the psychology of personality-a pioneer enterprise.\n\n1924-1930 Temperamentally I am a bit of a worrier, and for this reason I prepared my courses with conscientious thoroughness. When my chairman, Dr. Richard Cabot, implied that my platform manner \"lacked fire\" I tried to add animation to substance in my teaching. Ada and I were married in 1925, and for forty years she has had to tolerate the strain that marks all my preparations. Our son Robert Bradlee was born in 1927 after we had moved to Dartmouth College. He later became a pediatrician, and it pleased me to find myself sandwiched between two generations of physicians. Profoundly important professional friendships resulted from my first two years of teaching at Harvard. The first was with Dr. Richard Cabot, who held a double professorship at Harvard in cardiology and in social ethics. He proved to be a man of remarkably forthright social conscience. At the top of his field in medicine, he somehow found time to establish medical social service, to write many lucid volumes in medicine and in ethics, and to stir undergraduates profoundly with his uncompromising teaching of his own Puritan brand of ethics. Himself a wealthy Boston Brahmin, Cabot followed a theory and practice of philanthropy that appealed directly to my own sense of values. He believed as strongly as I in the integrity of each individual human life and would give financial and spiritual assistance when he felt he could aid in another's growth at some critical and crescent moment. (In 1936 he gave me support so that I could take a semester of free time to complete my book Personality: A Psychological Interpretation, 1937.) Gradually I became involved in his projects, inheriting after his death the general supervision of the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study (Powers and Witmer, 195 I). Likewise he asked me to be trustee of the Ella Lyman Cabot Trust which has continued year by year to carry through his own philanthropic conception of \"backing persons with projects.\" In connection with this Trust I have been associated with Dr. Cabot's famous successor, Dr. Paul Dudley White, and with other friends in a unique and highly congenial philanthropic activity.\n\na\n\n12\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nMy second friendship was formed with Edwin G. Boring who had come to Harvard while I was studying abroad. Fearing that my appointment in social ethics might remove me from psychology proper, I asked Boring if I could assist him in his introductory course, the famous Psychology 1. He agreed to the arrangement, and so I gained some experience teaching sections in experimental psychology (but not in arranging demonstrations, at which I should certainly be a failure). With Boring's encouragement I wrote further on imagery (1928). Acquaintance with a man of such amazing strenuosity and profound personal integrity, such deep historical erudition, and meticulous standards was, and is, a great influence and a major gratification in my career. Less intimate, but likewise influential, was my contact with William McDougall. I assisted him as well as Boring in his elementary course. Needless to say, the two courses were in marked contrast. Although I admired McDougall for his vigor and independence, I harbored all the prevailing anti-l\\lcDougall prejudices. I deplored his doctrines of instinct, interactionism, and the group mind (all of which I, like most other Americans, only half understood). Although Germany had converted me from my undergraduate semifaith in behaviorism, I felt that McDougall's antagonism to the prevailing American psychological creed went too far. His solution to the causalpurposive problem seemed as dualistic as Munsterberg's, and no more satisfactory. At the same time I was fully exposed to his point of view and found it became more persuasive in later years. McDougall always had a bad press in America. In spite of his forensic gifts, his British style of polemic diminished his effectiveness. After about seven years at Harvard he moved to Duke University where he continued his monumental heresies until his death in 1938. To Duke he brought my other teacher and friend, William Stern, a Hitler fugitive who outlived McDougall by two years. He also provided a haven for Rhine and his parapsychological research, once again exhibiting his independence of the prevailing psychological ethos. My brother had left Harvard for the University of North Carolina before my instructorship began. Besides our joint article we published \"A Test for Ascendance=Submission\" in 1928. This was a scale to measure dominant and submissive tendencies (one of the earliest pencil-and-paper personality tests). Apart from these two papers we never collaborated, even though we have occasionally helped each other with criticism. The truth, of course, is that our psychological views diverged. His Social Psychology (1924) was too behavioristic and too psychoanalytic for my taste. While our later works on political and social attitudes and on prejudice were similar in orientation, his theories became more positivistic, more monistic, and in a sense more interdisciplinary than my own. Floyd was a stricter logician and more systematic in his use of method than I. It should also be said that he had artistic, musical, and manual giftedness that I lacked. Over the years we pursued our own ways, but because of our common and unusual surname\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\n13\n\nand divergence of points of view we managed to confuse students and the public. Were there one or two Allports? It is clear to me now that the common quality in Stern, McDougall, Boring, Cabot, and my brother is a fierce personal and professional integrity. Unconsciously no doubt I have drawn much encouragement from them in pursuing my own personal idea in the face of contrary fashion. To this list of senior intellectual mentors and friends I must add the name of Pitirim A. Sorokin, whom I met when he came to Harvard in 1930 to head the Department of Sociology (to replace Social Ethics). Later I dedicated my book Becoming (1955) to this colleague of powerful erudition and blazing conviction. How he maintained his own moral and intellectual integrity during the Russian Communist Revolution he himself tells in his autobiography, A Long Journey (1964). In comparing my life with his I realize how sheltered my own career has been. Another influential figure has been my amiable and supportive colleague Harry A. Murray. Our fields of interest lie so close together that by unspoken agreement we allow a \"narcissism of slight differences\" to keep us in a state of friendly separation. I derive from Murray a great deal of stimulation and encouragement. Somewhat later, in the 1940's, I met Peter A. Bertocci, now Bowne Professor of Philosophy at Boston University, devoted to the personalist school of thought and well read in psychological theory. Over the years we have had frequent amiable arguments in and out of print. While he approves the general trend of my thought, he would like me to subscribe to an agentself and to a larger measure of voluntarism. On these issues I demur, but I deeply prize his philosophical monitoring and his friendship. An offer from Charles Stone at Dartmouth now broke my connection with Harvard for a period of four years. In Hanover I found myself in a pleasant and more relaxed atmosphere, free to pursue my own inclinations. I helped with the general introductory course and taught both social psychology and personality. During summer sessions I generally returned to teach at Harvard. The Baker Library during the long winter days at Hanover provided me with German journals so that I could keep abreast of thinking in typology, Gestalt, and Verstehen. Ever since the days of my thesis I had been haunted with the idea that I should write a general book on personality. Hanover gave me an opportunity to read and to think about this project. As one product, I might mention my first professional paper offered at the Ninth International Congress, held at Yale in 1929. It was titled \"What Is a Trait of Personality?\" (1931). The problem of the structure of personality was already much on my mind. (I resumed the theme thirty-six years later in a lecture to the APA in 1965, acknowledging my Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award. I titled it \"Traits Revisited.\") Among my Dartmouth undergraduate students were Hadley Cantril, Henry Odbert, Leonard Doob, all of whom followed me to Harvard for\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\n14\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\ntheir Ph.D. degrees. When l\\1cDougall left Harvard there was a gap in the area of social psychology. During 1928 Boring invited me to return as assistant professor, but it was September 1930 before I entered upon this final academic assignment. It is obvious to the reader that I had from 1915 a deep attachment to Harvard-an infatuation that has continued to this day.\n\n1930-1946 Back in Cambridge the frenzy began. In Hanover I had started an editorial connection with the Psychological Bulletin, being responsible for survey articles in the field of social psychology, and I had formed the habit of reading the Psychological Abstracts from cover to cover (a habit soon extinguished by competing stimuli). All in all I felt fairly familiar with the then current field of general psychology and so enjoyed colloquia and luncheon discussions with my colleagues: Boring, Pratt, Beebe-Center, Chapman, Murray, White, and others. Graduate students in social psychology formed a band we called \"The Group Mind.\" For some years we met to discuss one another's research programs in the fields of attitudes, expressive behavior, propaganda, and radio. Philip Vernon came from England for a time and brought a tornado of initiative. With him I was able to work out two investigations of lasting significance: Studies in Expressive Movement (1933) and A Study of Values (1931). Both of these projects rested upon my own German background but were sparked by Vernon's energy. A Study of Values was an attempt to establish empirically the six primary dimensions of personal values defined by Eduard Spranger, my Berlin teacher: the theoretical, economic, aesthetic, social, political, and religious. The resulting test, although unconventional in many ways, has shown astonishing vitality over the years. Gardner Lindzey assisted with a revision in 1951 and again in 1960. It is my contention that a measuring instrument in the field of personality is far better if based on good a priori analysis than if based on factorial or other adventitiously achieved dimensions. My mention of Vernon and Lindzey leads me to a warm and grateful acknowledgment of the happy collaboration I have enjoyed with many of my students. My joint publications (listed in the bibliography published as an appendix to Personality and Social Encounter, 1964) include as coauthors, besides Vernon and Lindzey, the names of Hadley Cantril, Henry Odbert, Leo Postman, Jerome Bruner, Bernard Kramer, James Gillespie, Thomas Pettigrew, and a dozen others. I can only hope they have shared my satisfaction in our joint labors. Psychology was a rapidly growing subject in the 1930's. The social emphasis was suddenly enhanced by the impact of world events: the depression, the rise of Hitler, the threat of war, and other fractures in the social edifice. There were relatively few social psychologists. Thus a host of\n\nGORDON W. ALLPORT\n\n15\n\nresponsibilities came my way. The Social Science Research Council and National Research Council wanted me for committees. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology wanted me as editor. After Boring had successfully piloted a final break between philosophy and psychology at Harvard, he wanted me to assume chairmanship of the now finally independent Department of Psychology. Lashley joined the department, and I was promoted to the third permanency on the staff (1937). Astonishing to me was my election as president of the American Psychological Association for the year 1939. But for me the event of chief significance in this decade was the publication by Holt of Personality: A Psychological Interpretation (1937). This book, as I have said, had been \"cooking\" in my head since my graduate days. My ambition was to give a psychological definition of the field of personality as I saw it. My vision, of course, was influenced by my encounters with social ethics, Anglo-American empiricism and German structural and personalistic theories. I wanted to fashion an experimental science, so far as appropriate, but chiefly I wanted an \"image of man\" that would allow us to test in full whatever democratic and humane potentialities that he might possess. I did not think of man as innately \"good,\" but I was convinced that by and large American psychology gave man less than his due by depicting him as a bundle of unrelated reaction tendencies. I did not write the book for any particular audience. I wrote it simply because I felt I had to define the new field of the psychology of personality as I saw it. Although there were books in the related areas of mental hygiene and abnormal psychology, I regarded my own approach as being in the tradition of academic psychology, and I felt that my emphasis should be on normality rather than on pathology. I also had a desire to avoid jargon and to try to express my thoughts in proper and felicitous English. The result was that some readers regarded the book as difficult and pretentious, others labelled it as \"classic,\" and for twenty-five years it stood as more or less standard reading in the field. Perhaps its major importance was that it defined (for the first time) the topics which well-bred texts in the field of personality should cover. To establish my main point (that a full-bodied psychology of the human person is possible) I had to devise and adapt a number of rather novel supporting propositions. Chief among them was the concept of functional autonomy. No theory of motivation, I maintained, could be adequate if based on the exclusive primacy of drives and on the reactive aspects of human nature. I hesitated to adopt McDougall's concept of purpose because it was anchored to dubious instinct theory. I felt that in the course of life, motives can, and usually do, undergo radical transformation and that the propelling force lay in the present on-moving structure of personality, not in some anachronistic conditioning of past motives. The book also emphasized the neglected topics of expressive behavior and faced up to the problem of the normative criteria for maturity. It dealt with the epistemological prob-\n\n16\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nlem of our knowledge of other personalities and throughout reiterated the challenge that any adequate psychology of personality must deal with the essential uniqueness of every personal structure. The latter insistence, of course, scandalized readers who felt that a man's individuality was sufficiently dealt with by regarding him as a point of intersecting common dimensions. I never implied that differential psychology was irrelevant to the psychology of personality, but I did insist that our science was at fault for neglecting the problem of patterning. When at long last I undertook a complete rewriting of this text in order to update the material and simplify the exposition, I selected the title Pattern and Growth in Personality (1961). While my chief intellectual love has always been personality theory, perhaps half of my research and writing has dealt with more general topics in social psychology. Even while working on Personality I took time off to dig as deeply as I could into the concept of \"attitude,\" which resulted in my topical chapter, under this title, in C. C. Murchison's Handbook of Social Psychology (1935). A number of papers on social attitudes and newspaper psychology and a book on The Psychology of Radio (with Cantril, 1935) attest the same interest. W orId War II placed a still heavier demand on social psychologists. Although I served with the Emergency Committee in Psychology under the APA, I avoided offers of employment in government agencies. My abilities, I felt, were not equal to the urgent and often vague demands placed upon the new agencies proliferating overnight in Washington. I felt that if I had any contribution to make, it would be best made by remaining at Harvard. Telephone lines were hot with the inquiry, \"What do we know about civilian morale?\" Speaking for myself, I knew nothing. But, in collaboration with Harry Murray, I decided some useful things might be discovered if we offered a seminar in \"morale research.\" Until Murray himself was called to Washington to head an important project for the Office of Strategic Services, we directed a number of student projects, ranging in type from an analysis of Hitler's character to studies of wartime rumor and riots. A bound (but not published) volume resulted entitled Worksheets in Morale. The seminar had a long-range consequence. It continued year after year, with a gradual focusing on what seemed to be the most urgent problem of national unity, namely, group conflict and prejudice. The products of this seminar over a twenty-five-year period have been numerous. I shall speak of them later. Meanwhile there were other wartime demands. Ever since the advent of Hitler in 1933, a flood of refugee psychologists was pouring into the United States, many of them the finest type of scholar: Koffka , Stern, Kohler, Lewin, Werner, Egan and Else Brunswik, and many others. To find jobs for such stars was not difficult, but the second string of unknown refugees created a serious problem. Together with Barbara Burks, Gardner Murphy, and others, I did what I could to make contacts for them. The refugee problem had great\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\n17\n\ninterest for sociologists as well as for psychologists. J. S. Bruner and E. M. Jandorf collaborated with me in publishing an analysis of ninety personal documents written by Hitler fugitives under the title \"Personality under Social Catastrophe\" (1941). Some of my time was given to making speeches, semipopular writing on morale, and rumor analysis, leading to a daily syndicated feature in the Boston Traveler entitled \"Rumor Clinic\" in which we endeavored to scotch harmful wartime rumors. We classified them as of three types: \"bogies,\" Hpipe dreams,\" and \"wedge-drivers.\" The third type, based on prejudice and group antagonism, was the most serious. For much of this work I leaned upon the investigations of my student Robert H. Knapp. Soon Leo Postman joined forces with me in giving a course on race relations to Boston police officers and in publishing a book The Psychology of Rumor (1947). As the close of the war approached, many psychologists became concerned with the conditions required for writing a lasting and effective peace. I pointed up a statement signed by 2038 psychologists entitled \"Human Nature and the Peace\" and published it in the Psychological Bulletin (1945). In retrospect our formula for peace may seem somewhat quixotic, but it still stands as a tribute to the social ideals of our profession. The profound public concern of most American social psychologists, not only in wartime but throughout these troubled decades, is a fact worthy of comment. In 1936 the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) was born. Early leaders included Gardner Murphy, Goodwin Watson, George Hartmann, Kurt Lewin, Edward Tolman, and Theodore Newcomb. I served as president of the Society in 1944. l\\1y membership in this group is one that I find congenial, for at heart I am both a political liberal and a social reformer. From my early Dartmouth days I had found close intellectual and personal companionship with my student Hadley Cantril. We both wanted to fashion a social psychology that would be accurate and applicable to significant problems. Between us we called it \"L-P\" (Lehenspsychologie). Our book about the psychology of radio (1935) was one product of our collaboration. He was director of the \"Tensions Project\" at UNESCO in Paris and invited me to attend a memorable conference there in 1948, resulting in the book he edited, Tensions that Cause Wars (1950). For it I wrote a chapter entitled \"The Role of Expectancy.\" As the war drew to a close, most of my colleagues and students, it seemed, were in Washington or in the armed services. For us stay-at-homes it became necessary to plan on a huge postwar influx of veterans into our universities. In particular at Harvard we faced a local situation of some urgency. Although I was continuing as chairman of the Department of Psychology it seems that some far-reaching type of change was needed. Our department, like that of sociology, was small. The interests of our own staff were clearly divided, with the \"biotropes\" (Boring, Stevens, Lashley, Beebe-\n\n18\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nCenter) on one side and the \"sociotropes\" (the terms are Boring's) on the other (Murray, White, Allport). A corresponding division of interest was evident in the Department of Anthropology, with Kluckhohn, representing cultural anthropology, finding much in common with sociologists and sociotropes. Together a group consisting of Parsons, Murray, Kluckhohn, Mowrer, and myself held many meetings devising a new department. To change any basic organization within a university (especially within an older institution) is a task as cumbersome as moving a cemetery. However, plans were laid, and in January 1946 the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted that the new department should be created. Before leaving this era I wish to report a stroke of personal good fortune. During the last three years of my chairmanship of the Department of Psychology, Mrs. Eleanor D. Sprague served as my secretary. She continued with me in the new department, where my administrative job was chairmanship of the Committee of Higher Degrees. She was my right hand until her retirement in 1964. Thanks to her competent assistance I covered more ground than would otherwise have been possible.\n\n1946-1966 Six P.M. was the sacred hour of adjournment for faculty meetings. At a meeting in January 1946 the faculty authorized the formation of the new department but at 5: 50 P.M. had not yet christened it. The name Human Relations was suggested, but that would never do because Yale already had an institute by that name. It would be too suffocating to call it the Department of Sociology, Social Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Social Anthropology, although that is what it was. At about 5: 59 P.M. someone proposed \"Social Relations,\" and owing to the lateness of the hour the name was adopted without debate. The new organization, involving as it did a splitting of the previous Departments of Anthropology and Psychology, was a drastic move for Harvard and startled that portion of the academic world which watches changes in Harvard's educational policies. But the war was over, the need urgent, and veterans were flocking back with a keen interest in the basic social sciences, which, they vaguely felt, must hold some solution to the troubled world's problems. With the enthusiastic cooperation of the Provost, Paul Buck, the new department rapidly enlarged its staff with returning Harvard people (George Homans, Jerome Bruner, Brewster Smith, Donald McGranahan, and others) and with brilliant new members including Samuel Stouffer, Frederick Mosteller, and Richard Solomon. A new curriculum was offered commencing in July 1946. I myself (with George Homans) gave the introductory course for a few years. Within a year or so it became the largest elective course in college with nearly 900 Harvard and Radcliffe students registered in it. In fact soon\n\nGORDON W. ALLPORT\n\n19\n\nafter its beginning the department had large enrollments, a concentration of about 400 undergraduates and close to 200 candidates for the Ph.D. degree. Advanced degrees were not offered in Social Relations but rather in each of the four constituent disciplines. The problem of the department has al ways been to balance the needs of specialization with a measure of desired cross-disciplinary training. Our policies have followed a wavering course between specialism and integrationism, with no satisfactory proportion yet discovered. This bold academic experiment could not have succeeded, I think, were it not for the fact that in the course of their wartime service most of our staff members had lost their strict academic identities. A man could be a good social scientist whether or not his main training had been in psychology, sociology, anthropology, statistics, or some other discipline. The war thus prepared our minds for such integration as was achieved. Intellectual leadership toward the formation of a \"common language\" in our field came from Talcott Parsons, joined for a time by Edward Shils and Edward Tolman. Whether the effort was premature or whether Harvard's tradition was one of individualism and dissent, it did not turn out to be possible to establish a common basic language for the department. But dyads, triads, and small clusters of colleagues did manage to work together on projects of common interest, and a general atmosphere of convergence prevailed. Much credit for such unification as was achieved goes to Parsons. For ten years he was our enthusiastic chairman and from the beginning the true leader of the enterprise. As one of the department's founding fathers I was eager to see the experiment succeed. My specific duty was to chair the Committee on Higher Degrees (with Mrs. Sprague's able assistance) and, wherever I could, to uphold the arms of other administrative officers. (Talcott Parsons, Robert White, and David McClelland served successively as chairmen, and Samuel Stouffer and Freed Bales as laboratory directors.) My own teaching continued much as it always had. I finally dropped the large elementary course into the able hands of Bob White and gave over formal course instruction in social psychology to younger colleaguesJerry Bruner, Roger Brown, Gardner Lindzey, and more recently Herb Kelman, Elliot Aronson, Stanley Milgram, Kenneth Gergen, and the oncoming procession of younger talent. I gave a middle-level course in theories of personality and conducted two graduate seminars-one for second-year graduate candidates in clinical and social psychology and one a continuation of the morale seminar, which had become entirely devoted to problems of group conflict and prejudice. It was in connection with the latter course that I directed several relevant Ph.D. theses and began a series of publications of my own, climaxed by The Nature of Prejudice (1954). To my mind the significance of this book, which still circulates widely in a paperback edition, lies in its table of\n\n20\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\ncontents. As was the case with the field of personality, I spent several years deciding what subject matter was truly central to a new, ill-defined psychological territory and what the proper order of topics should be in any comprehensive text. While many able students collaborated in this work, one grew to the stature of a torch-bearer. I was greatly impressed by the research abilities and expository skills of Thomas F. Pettigrew, a Virginian. I invited him to accompany me to South Africa as special scholar at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Natal, where we spent six fruitful months in 1956. It was, of course, fascinating to compare the ethnic frictions of South Africa with those of the United States and thus in a way to test the crosscultural validity of my recently published book. l\\1y conclusion was that all the personal forces making for prejudice were present in both lands, but that my own psychological bias had perhaps led me to underestimate the forces of history and of traditional social structure more strikingly evident in South Africa. Pettigrew and I made some cross-cultural perceptual investigations in South Africa. One of them, entitled \"Cultural Influences on the Perception of Movement\" (1957), seemed to us to show that social factors in perception are prominent only when there is inherent ambiguity in the stimulus situation. After a year at North Carolina, Pettigrew returned to Harvard and gradually assumed a large portion of my own teaching and administrative duties, adding them to his own heavy program of work in the field of race relations. Under his direction the long-standing seminar continues to make its contributions to the study of morale. Returning to the field of personality theory (always central in my interests), I found myself burdened with requests for named lectures in assorted universities, sometimes single lectures, sometimes a series. Likewise there were presidential and other honorific papers to prepare, as well as chapters for symposia and handbooks. In fact most of my writing for the past twenty-five years seems to have been dictated by such obligations. Each obligation I tried to employ as an occasion to say something relevant to personality theory. Thus, to the Eastern Psychological Association I offered \"The Ego in Contemporary Psychology\" (1943). Sometimes this paper is cited as reintroducing the concept of self into academic psychology-a bit of an overstatement, I think. Again, the Merrick Lectures at Ohio Wesleyan and the Lowell Lectures in Boston gave me incentive to prepare The Individual and His Religion (1950). The assignment of the Terry Lectures at Yale resulted in Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of Personality (1955). A large number of additional occasional papers were gathered together in Personality and Social Encounter (1960). It seemed appropriate in this latter volume to list in an appendix my complete bibliography, revised in the paperback edition (1964).\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\n21\n\nTo my mind there is a distinct unity in these writings, including those on prejudice. Personality, as I see it, is composed chiefly of generic attitudes, values, and sentiments. (See, for example, \"Mental Health: A Generic Attitude,\" 1964.) Therefore the prejudice-complex, the religious sentiment, the phenomenological ego, and one's philosophy of life are important subterritories to explore in individual lives. While giving much of my attention to these generic formations that are found in many, if not all, lives, I still place higher in my scale of scientific values the search for the pattern that binds sentiments, values, and traits within each unique individual life. I chose this theme for an address in 1961 to the Berufsverband deutscher Psychologen in Hamburg. The lecture was titled \"Das Allgemeine und das Eigenartige in der Psychologischen Praxis\" (1962). This assignment I accepted partly as an excuse for a sentimental journey. I was happy to repay the profound stimulation that German structural concepts had given me and especially to return to the scene of my studies with Stern almost forty years previously. But I felt too that German psychologists might understand my plea for morphogenic (idiographic) methods, geared to the structure of individual lives, somewhat better than did most of my American colleagues. This line of thought, of course, relates to my perennial question, \"How shall a life history be written?\" For many years I had used in my teaching a remarkable series of 300 intimate letters written by a woman from the age of fifty-eight until her death twelve years later. The letters deal with a mother-son tangle and are written in a fiercely dramatic, personal style. Here surely is a unique life, calling for psychological analysis and interpretation. Having had considerable experience in teaching with the aid of these letters, I decided to present them as a challenge to others and to sketch the available modes of psychological analysis applicable to this single case; thus I produced the book Letters from Jenny (1965). Among the occasional assignments that took much time and effort I should mention the chapter for Lindzey's Handbook of Social Psychology (1954) entitled \"The Historical Background of Modern Social Psychology.\" I had for several years offered a course in this subject and so welcomed the opportunity to give a compendious statement of the roots of modern social psychology as I saw them to be. Although a revision of the Handbook is now called for, I find little to change in the chapter. Someone, however, should write a much fuller and more detailed history of the subject. I knew, of course, that a revision of the 1937 edition of Personality was needed. It should be brought up to date; the account of functional autonomy required restatement, and the new movements in the fields of cognition, role studies, and existential theory should be included. Pattern and Growth in Personality (1961) represented this updating and likewise a simplification of exposition. Being older (and feeling personally more secure) now I can dispense with my earlier inflated vocabulary.\n\n22\n\nA HISTORY\n\nOF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nMeanwhile the Department of Social Relations had grown and grown. With a staff of nearly 100 instructors, further evolution and change were bound to occur. It was time to turn the controls over to younger colleagues. The department had existed for eighteen years in seven separate buildings and was largely cut off from the biotropic Department of Psychology. When the Fund for Harvard College announced as one of its goals the building of a large and inclusive Center for the Behavioral Sciences it seemed that at last a geographical union of these disparate units might be achieved. We moved into the new fifteen-story William James Hall in January 1965, just as I was entering a period of semiretirement. By arrangement with President Pusey I had agreed to teach in the fall semesters for a few years but to keep the spring terms free for writing and travel. I found it a wrench to leave Emerson Hall, which as student and teacher I had inhabited continuously for fifty years (less seven years for my work abroad and the interval at Dartmouth). One final chapter in my formal relations with Harvard should be recorded. In March 1966 the Corporation appointed me the first Richard Clarke Cabot Professor of Social Ethics. In announcing the establishment of this new chair President Pusey took occasion to \"welcome the formal reappearance of Social Ethics in a community which owes much to the dedication and example of Richard Clarke Cabot and, before him, Francis Greenwood Peabody.\" Pusey added that \"In a time of widespread confusion about moral issues, there is also in our day a resurgence of concern for human and ethical values, especially for character and moral sensibility.\" Since Dr. Cabot was my first \"boss\" at Harvard, having much influence upon my career first and last, the appointment seemed to me to complete fittingly an intellectual cycle as well as a cycle of sentiment.\n\nA\n\nPOLEMIC-EcLECTIC\n\nMuch of my writing is critical of prevailing psychological idols. At times I have crossed swords with learning theory, dimensionalism in personality research, and with what seems to me to be an overemphasis on unconscious processes, projective tests, and simplified drive theories of motivation. I have felt that these fashionable explanatory principles are able to deal only with the peripheral or \"opportunistic\" layers of personality, or else that they make too much of some improbable formulations of depth psychology. (Yes, my single encounter with Freud was traumatic.) In place of (or, more accurately, as a supplement to) these popular formulae, I have advocated what seemed to me necessary principles. These are principles dealing with \"propriate\" functions (anchored to the selfimage), insightful capacities for learning, complex integrative generic attitudes and ways of perceiving one's world, expressive (not merely projective)\n\nGORDON\n\nW. ALLPORT\n\n23\n\nbehavior, the formations that mark maturity in personality, and values and orientations toward the future-in short, with the course of growth and becoming. It is within this web of concepts that one would find my personal idea. Bergson, of course, was right in saying that no philosophic mind ever succeeds in fully realizing his idea. It is my experience also that such a mind may all the while be half-distrustful of the idea's validity. Although much of my writing is polemic in tone, I know in my bones that my opponents are partly right. When asked to give an occasional paper at the XVII International Congress of Psychology in Washington, I titled it \"The Fruits of Eclecticism: Bitter or Sweet?\" (1964). In it I tried to trace eclectic trends in the psychology of the past and to argue that a systematic eclecticism is not impossible in the future. But here I insisted that no enthusiastic particularism, however fashionable, will ever be adequate. I implied that only a view of the \"Open System in Personality Theory\" (1960) will really serve the purpose. Any investigator, of course, has the right to restrict his variables and neglect, momentarily, irrelevant aspects of behavior, but he has no right to forget what he has decided to neglect. As I have said elsewhere, some of my colleagues treat personality as a quasi-closed system. I respect their work and know that eventually their contributions will fit into the larger frame. I feel no personal animosity toward the associates with whom I have ventured to disagree. But what I dislike in our profession is the strong aura of arrogance found in presently fashionable dogmas. To my mind humility is a virtue appropriate for social and psychological scientists to cultivate. I am not fond of the label \"behavioral sciences\" now in vogue. From a certain point of view it is harmless enough, but to me it somehow implies that if we were all to embrace the creeds of positivism and behaviorism, all our problems would be solved. I cannot agree. Our methods would be restricted, our theories one-sided, and our students would be intimidated by a tyrannical and temporary scientism. Humility requires a more tentative position. William James was right-our knowledge is a drop, our ignorance a sea. James himself, to my mind, sets a worthy model for psychologists to follow in his open-rnindedness, his respect for multiple avenues to truth, and his personal humility. The irrelevance of much present-day psychology to human life comes from its emphasis on mechanical aspects of reactivity to the neglect of man's wider experiences, his aspirations, and his incessant endeavor to master and to mould his environment. Of course not all psychologists have this blind spot. Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, Gardner Murphy, Harry Murray, and many others have clearer vision. What then is my personal idea? I suppose it has to do with the search for a theoretical system-for one that will allow for truth wherever found, one that will encompass the totality of human experience and do full justice to the nature of man. I myself have never had a strictly defined program of\n\n24\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nresearch, nor have I tried to establish a \"school\" of psychological thought. Students who have worked with me have been encouraged to tackle any significant problem, so long as it dealt with persons, with parts of persons, or with groups of persons. Dedicated as I am to a program so broad and loose, I fmd it surprising that many specific honors have come my way. I shall report only one-the one that has pleased me most deeply, for it succeeds in summing up my personal idea better than I can do. In connection with the XVII International Congress of Psychology, which met in Washington in 1963, fifty-five of my former Ph.D. students presented me with two handsomely bound volumes of their own writings with the following dedicatory inscription: \"From his students-in appreciation of his respect for their individuality.\" This is an intimate honor, and one I prize above all others.\n\nREFERENCES Selected Publications by Gordon W.

I am an only child. I come from a predominantly professional family. My father was a successful physician with a special interest in neuroanatomy and neurology. If his IQ had been measured, it would have been very high. He was a traveled and broadly informed man. My mother, Emily Henrietta Leonard, did her major work in logic and psychology at Wellesley College where she established lifelong friendships with M. W. Calkins, the \"self-psychologist,\" and E. A. McC. Gamble, an authority on the psychology of taste and smell. Before her marriage my mother taught at Miss Porter's School (Farmington) and went on to be vice president, to use the present title, of the State Teachers College at Fitchburg, Massachusetts. As a young matron in Philadelphia she early became active in the work of volunteer charitable boards. Her interests, I now see, were centered in agencies concerned with helping children and the indigent ill. She also organized a successful movement to save a fme eighteenth-century house in Germantown. At the time of her death she had been for eight years chief of the Bureau of Recreation of the City of Philadelphia. This appointive post was, I believe, the highest position held up to that time by any woman in the city government of Philadelphia. My father's family on the Carmichael side came from the North of Ireland (county, Londonderry). Some of them had been clergymen in the Anglican Church of Ireland. My maternal grandmother came to Philadelphia from the British West Indies. Her family were plantation owners and clergymen. My mother's father, Charles Hall Leonard, D.D., LL.D., was professor of homiletics and for many years dean of the Crane Theological School of Tufts University. I suspect he was a master of his subject because the famous Phillips Brooks journeyed out from Boston for a full term to take his lectures. He lived to be ninety-six years old and even published a book after he was ninety. His father had been a small manufacturer and represented Haverhill in the General Court (the state legislature of Massachusetts). My maternal grandmother, Phebe Bassett, was a teacher of mathematics before her marriage. She had studied Greek and Latin at Brook Farm, the famous New Eng-\n\n29\n\n30\n\nA HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nland transcendentalist utopian community. Her lifelong interest was in the branch of mathematics called celestial mechanics. She found her recreation in astronomical computations such as those required in establishing the orbits of comets. Through this grandmother's line I am descended from a colonial American of some distinction, Wyseman Clagett. The Dictionary of American Biography says of this ancestor that he was the last chief legal officer of the Crown in the colony of New Hampshire and the first such officer in the new state of New Hampshire. He largely wrote its constitution. A fine portrait of his wife, now in the Brooklyn Museum, was painted by Blackburn, who had as sitters many of the notable families of the 1750's in New England. I own a good oil copy of this portrait. It was my good fortune to attend what was at the time, and probably still is, one of the best and largest private secondary day schools in America, the Germantown Friends School, though my parents were not Quakers but Episcopalians. In school I was, I think, only a high average student and occasionally on the honor roll. Each year the faculty of the school devised a printed examination, an \"Information Test,\" that was given to the entire upper school without previous warning. Its detailed questions ranged over science, history, biography, and current events. Perhaps in this respect I achieved distinction outside of regular courses by scoring highest in the whole school several times. Several of my teachers have had a profound influence on me throughout my entire life. Among them was H. A. Domincovich, a teacher of Latin and English and an outstandingly brilliant man. Another was an excellent art teacher, who was herself an artist of real ability. She taught me the pleasure of going to art galleries and to periodic gallery shows and introduced me to a number of well known artists. From this teacher, Miss E. H. Schick, I learned the elements of drawing, a skill that later helped me very distinctly in my college study of zoology. A few of my anatomical drawings are still included in various textbooks of zoology and psychology. This early and continuing interest in art proved to be a very real help to me when later in life I found myself, as secretary of the Smithsonian, concerned with the management of four great galleries of art that are bureaus of the Smithsonian Institution. I certainly was not an outstanding athlete, but participating in sports meant much to me. I won school letters for playing on the first team in basketball, football, and soccer. I was also editor of the school paper and president of my class. I was given a cane, an old tradition, by my class, as its most popular member. Many of my lifelong friendships were formed in this school. Germantown, for more than a century technically a part of Philadelphia, retained in my boyhood its independent character as an old community. Certainly it seemed to me then and now to be an ideal place in which to grow up. Germantown had all the advantages of being part of what some have called America's most historic and also most artistic and culturally sophisti-\n\nLEONARD\n\nCARMICHAEL\n\n31\n\ncated city, but the Germantown part of Philadelphia also provided many of the advantages of country living. The house I was born in was large and distinctive enough to be included in a dehnitive book on historical houses of Philadelephia. Part of it dated back to a time before the hard-fought Revolutionary Battle of Germantown in which General Washington was defeated. The history of Germantown, its old Georgian mansions, its beautiful old mahogany furniture, and the hand tools of its artisans had an abiding fascination for me. My senior essay at school was written on the pietistic German university men who established in the seventeenth century an astronomical observatory in Germantown. My friends and I early gained an interest in natural history from our teachers and from our books. I made a fair collection of the butterflies and moths of this region and mounted them with care. The house in which I was born had its own stables, outbuildings, and large flower and vegetable gardens. From our gardener I learned something of the old-world nurture of plants. Gardening has been one of my continuing interests. A chauffeur of my father's taught me the proper use and care of basic woodworking and metalworking hand tools, and even the elements of blacksmithing. Later, in laboratory shops and at home, the use of tools has been a pleasant part of my life. As a child I read constantly, going through the plays of Shakespeare, many of the works of Thackeray, and my favorite, Anthony Trollope, whom I now consider the greatest psychologist among novelists. History has always interested me. College courses in history made this subject a minor interest of mine through life. Before going to college I had read such books as Bergson's Creative Evolution, Royce's The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, and the two volumes of my mother's Hrst edition of James' Principles of Psychology with her good notes in the margin. She had studied this book under the direction of Yale's distinguished psychologist George Trumbull Ladd. It is indeed fortunate for one to have parents with scientific interests and a well-stocked library! Our conversation at home was about books, letters, and science. Sermons were employed to teach me the principles of formal logic. It was a rare dinner when someone did not rush for the encyclopedia to prove a point. As I have noted, my grandfather was a dean at Tufts, and my uncles had gone to this college. I entered Tufts in 1917 and was graduated four years later with the B.S. degree, summa cum laude, and academically second in my class. I was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior. After America entered the war, I volunteered; but as soon as I put on my uniform as a private, I was assigned to help in a course in military sanitation and hygiene. As an undergraduate I was an active member of the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity of which my uncles had also been members. Fraternity life, often criticized today, was for me both pleasant and worthwhile. I was almost too involved in extracurricular affairs. I was editor-in-chief of the undergraduate\n\n32\n\nA HISTORY\n\nOF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\ncollege paper. president of the college dramatic society, and had other duties and offices. Each day I wrote news about the academic, social, and athletic events at Tufts for the then famous Boston Transcript. After receiving my freshman marks I applied for a scholarship and found that since my father's income was at a satisfactory level I was not eligible. This so-called \"financial means test\" for the award of scholarships and academic honors. commonly practiced by colleges, annoyed me then and has continued to annoy me. I at once applied for an assistantship in biology, which I received, for which there was no \"means test.\" This meant that besides my own studies and extracurricular activities, afternoons during my college years were spent as a laboratory assistant in zoology. This science became my major interest. I believe that I have worked hard all my life, but never harder than when I was a college undergraduate. Morning after morning I set my alarm for 4 A.M. or even earlier in order to get essential studying done. Laboratory teaching was interesting and I profited by it. In a limited way this teaching made me something of a comparative anatomist and histologist. In my senior year H. V. Neal, my major professor of zoology, allowed me to do a small research problem on the embryology of the eye muscles in one of the sharks. This started my great interest in the significance and the evolutionary history of sense organs as directors of animal behavior. It also showed me how basic is the science of descriptive and experimental embryology. As a college senior I thus decided that I wanted to spend the rest of my life learning all I could about the sense organs and especially about the role of the receptors in determining the discriminations that organisms make in their adaptive responses to varied environmental energies. At this time I was almost equally attracted to the study of anatomy, physiology, embryology, and especially the study of animal behavior as seen in the quantifiable tropistic reactions that were then being most actively in vesti gated. The two men whose books influenced me most as an undergraduate were the biological ultramechanist Jacques Loeb and the proponent of emergent evolution C. Lloyd Morgan. I finally decided, especially after reading Howard C. Warren's Human Psychology, that psychology rather than anatomy or physiology was the best place for me to anchor a study of the sense organs when considered in a general functional and biological setting. The question then arose as to the place for graduate work. My father had generously agreed to support me as long as I wished to study. E. B. Twitmyer, the able and objectively-minded psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offered me a very generous Harrison Fellowship, but I decided to go to Harvard for my graduate work. A teacher at Tufts, Edwin A. Shaw had taken his Ph.D. at Harvard in educational psychology under Walter F. Dearborn. He suggested that I go to Cambridge and talk to Dearborn about studying psychology at Harvard.\n\nLEONARD\n\nCARMICHAEL\n\n33\n\nDearborn offered me a much smaller fellowship than the one at Pennsylvania. I accepted, although I told him I was not primarily interested in education with a capital \"E.\" Dearborn told me that in his opinion all psychology and especially educational psychology was most likely to be advanced by people who understood and maintained a basic biological approach to the science. He therefore most cordially urged me to accept the fellowship on my terms, and he assured me that I could take any pattern of graduate courses at Harvard that I wished in preparation for the Ph.D. degree. During my three years at Harvard as a graduate student I therefore took a number of courses in zoology as well as psychology. Indeed, the first piece of graduate lahoratory research I undertook was a quantitative study of the light reactions of the meal worm CTenebrio niolitor ), It will never be possible for me to overemphasize the importance of the privilege of studying so closely during these years with the man who directed this research, C. H. Parker, then a professor of zoology at Harvard. His graduate lectures on the nervous system and the sense organs were models of clarity and scholarship. I tried to emulate his lectures in all my later teaching. Among the experiences at Harvard for which I am most grateful was the opportunity to take the courses or to audit the lectures of such distinguished teachers as the great E. C. Boring, L. T. Troland, and William McDougall. Throughout my graduate years, my association with Dearborn was especially close and satisfactory. He assigned me, for my own exclusive use, a Iine large office and an adjoining research room on the third floor of Emerson Hall. These were rooms once used by Hugo Munsterberg. Dearborn gave me the privilege of rebuilding in the Harvard shop an improved model of the famous Dodge-Dearborn eye movement recording camera. In the laboratory shop I worked at a bench with Troland and thus came to know him quite well. Troland introduced me to a quantitative and truly functional or operational point of view in psychology. At Harvard I did experimental work in the zoological laboratory and in Emerson Hall. Much of my time was spent in apparatus construction and in learning new biological techniques basic to later behavior study. Dearborn introduced me to W. R. Miles, then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Nutrition Laboratory adjacent to the Harvard Medical School. In Miles' laboratory I had the privilege of watching the use of string galvanometers and other advanced pieces of physiological and psychological apparatus. This laboratory allowed me to formulate an idea of what a really well-equipped psychological laboratory could be. It also started me on a lifetime of admiration of this really distinguished man. When it came time for me to select a topic for my Ph.D. thesis I talked at length with Dearborn about my basic interest in the sensory control or release of inborn patterns of behavior. This led both student and teacher to much discussion of the psychology and biology of so-called \"human and ani-\n\n34\n\nA HISTORY\n\nOF PSYCHOLOGY\n\nIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nmal instincts.\" Finally Dearborn convinced me that it would be most advantageous for me at this time in my career to do my dissertation on a theoretical and historical subject.

A summary of some of the conclusions of this paper was later published under the title \"Heredity and Environment: Are They Antithetical?\" (1925). This title was not mine but was selected in an oral conference with Morton Prince, then the editor of the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. He had talked to me about my thesis and asked me to write the paper for him. In his charming manner he pounded his desk and said, \"Give it a title people will sit up and notice!\" Prince is another psychologist whom I consider myself fortunate to have known well. He was an original thinker in addition to being a wealthy, dashing, sport-loving gentleman. In reviewing the literature for my thesis I became especially interested in the German publications of William Preyer. Later this scientist's book, Specielle Physiologie des Embryo, Untersuchungen ii-ber die Lebenserscheinungen vor der Ceburt, opened my eyes to the specific area of research in my chosen field of the sensory and neural control of behavior on which I was to spend many years. The accidental finding of this book, which I had never heard of before, in the Harvard library was a turning point in my life. Here at last I saw a way to investigate the topic of major interest to me-the morphological growth of the receptors and nervous s"
