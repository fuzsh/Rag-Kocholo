        "text": "Chapter 14 Gestalt Psychology Lecture Notes\n\nI. Antecedents of Gestalt Psychology\n\nA. German psychologists took issue with Wundt’s elementism\n\nSeveral German psychologists argued that consciousness could not be reduced to elements without distorting the true meaning of conscious experience.\n\nPeople experience things in meaningful, intact configurations which are termed Gestalt and this type of psychology was to be called Gestalt psychology.\n\nThey advocated a molar approach, which concentrates on phenomenological experience— mental experience as it occurred to the naïve observer, without further analysis (experience as it appears in consciousness).\n\nB. Philosophers/antecedent views\n\nImmanuel Kant and the Gestaltists both believed that consciousness cannot be reduced to sensory stimulation, and conscious experience is different from the elements that compose it.\n\nErnst Mach postulated that two perceptions, space form and time form, appeared to be independent of the particular elements that composed them – ex. Circleness and melody.\n\nChristian von Ehrenfels influenced Wertheimer (one of the founders of Gestalt psychology) as an instructor of several courses.\n\nEhrenfels (and Mach) proposed that form is something that emerges from the elements of sensation.\n\nWilliam James postulated a stream of consciousness in contrast to the mind being composed of isolated mental elements.\n\nThe stream should be the focus of psychological inquiry; any attempt to break it up for more detailed analysis must be avoided.\n\nKöhler was well versed in physics and Gestalt psychology, represented an effort to model psychology after field theory instead of Newtonian physics.\n\nII. The Founding of Gestalt Psychology\n\nA. Max Wertheimer\n\nUsed the phi phenomenon, a perception of apparent movement when the elements of the experience are, in fact, stationary.\n\nLight is shown in two slits:\n\nA long interval (> 200 msec) makes it look like two lights.\n\nA short interval (< 30 msec) looks like two lights simultaneously.\n\nOptimal interval (60 msec) looks like the light moves.\n\nHis 1912 paper describing this phenomenon is customarily taken as the formal beginning of Gestalt psychology.\n\nTogether with Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler, are considered the cofounders of Gestalt psychology.\n\nB. Kurt Koffka\n\nEarned his PhD from the University of Berlin-1908 - from Carl Stumpf. Late accepted a position at Smith College in the United States.\n\nWrote several books and articles regarding Gestalt psychology.\n\nHis article entitled, “Perception: An introduction to Gestalt-theorie,” was believed to provide a misrepresentation that Gestaltists were only interested in perception.\n\nC. Wolfgang Köhler\n\nReceived his PhD from the University of Berlin in 1909 – Carl Stumpf.\n\nHe did research regarding aspects of learning which greatly influenced Gestalt ideas, including the nature of learning in chimpanzees. – German spy?\n\nThe Mentality of Apes – 1917 – record of his work with chimps.\n\nLeft Nazi Germany in 1935 to teach at Swarthmore College.\n\nPresident of APA in 1959.\n\nIII. Isomorphism and the law of Prägnanz\n\nA theory\n\nGestaltists propose that the brain contains structural fields of electrochemical forces.\n\nUpon entering a field, sensory data both modify the structure of the field and are modified by the field. Our experience results from the interaction of the sensory data and the force fields in the brain.\n\nCognitive experience results from the fields of brain activity transforming sensory\n\nIV. Perception\n\nA. Perceptual constancy\n\nThe way we respond to objects as if they are the same, even though the actual stimulation our senses receive may vary greatly.\n\nThis phenomenon is not a function of sensation plus learning but is a function of the ongoing brain activity and the fields’ activity.\n\nPerceptual Gestalten (figure-ground and principles of organization)\n\nFigure-ground\n\nThe perceptual field can be divided into two parts, the figure and the ground. The figure is clear and unified and is the object of attention, the ground is diffuse and consists of everything that is not being attended to. The division creates a figure-ground relationship and what is the figure and what is the ground can be changed by shifting one’s attention.\n\nContinuity - Stimuli that have continuity with one another (intrinsic togetherness, seem to go together) will be experienced as a perceptual unit to make a whole.\n\nProximity- Stimuli, which are close together, tend to be grouped together as a perceptual unit.\n\nInclusiveness - When there is more than one figure, we are most likely to see the figure that contains the greatest number of stimuli.\n\nSimilarity - Objects that are similar in some way tend to form perceptual units.\n\nClosure -Incomplete figures in the physical world are perceived as complete ones. For example, if we have figures with gaps in them we fill in the gaps to make a whole.\n\nSubjective and Objective Reality\n\nKoffka distinguished between the geographical environment (physical environment) and the behavioral environment (our subjective interpretation of the geographical environment).\n\nOur own subjective reality governs our actions more than the physical environment.\n\nV. Gestalt Explanations of Learning\n\nA. Cognitive trial and error –Instead of behavioral trial and error, the Gestaltists believed\n\nthat cognitive trial and error occurs\n\nOrganisms come to see solutions to problems. B. Insight learning –If a problem is presented to an organism along with whatever is necessary to solve the problem, insight learning will typically occur. C. Insight learning has basically four characteristics:\n\nThe transition from presolution to solution is sudden and complete – “ah ha!”\n\nPerformance based on the insightful solution is usually smooth and free of errors\n\nA solution gained by insight is retained for a considerable length of time\n\nA principle gained by insight is easily applied to other problems.\n\nD. Transposition\n\nAn organism learns principles or relationships, not specific responses to specific situations.\n\nOnce it learns a principle, the organism applies it to similar situations.\n\nSimilar to transfer of training.\n\nKohler’s experiment on chicken: White paper vs. Gray paper Gray paper vs. Black paper\n\nVI. Productive Thinking\n\nA. Productive thinking\n\nThe ideas presented in the book Productive Thinking by Wertheimer were based on personal experience, experimentation, and interviews with people considered excellent problem solvers, such as Einstein.\n\nLearning based on Gestalt principles would be based on understanding the structure of the problem, followed by the solution and the solution is reinforcing\n\nLearning and problem solving are intrinsically reinforcing.\n\nThis is top-down learning in contrast to rote memorization or learning based on logic and typical of most education systems.\n\nLearning and problem solving governed by intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic motivation\n\nB. Memory\n\nA memory process is the brain activity caused by a specific environmental event.\n\ncompleted tasks. The explanation was that for an uncompleted task the associated tension is never reduced therefore, the task remains as an intention, and as such remains as part of the person’s life space. Thus, we remember the uncompleted task better than the completed task. E. Application\n\nConflict: Lewin investigated three types of conflict:\n\nApproach–approach conflict\n\nAvoidance–avoidance conflict\n\nApproach–avoidance conflict.\n\nGroup dynamics For Lewin, a group can be viewed as a physical system and the behavior of the individual elements is determined by the configuration of the existing field of energy.\n\nThe nature of configuration of a group will strongly influence the behavior of its members.\n\nMembers of each group has what Lewin called a dynamic interdependence.\n\nStudies of group dynamics led to encounter groups, sensitivity training, and leadership institutes.\n\nVIII. The Impact of Gestalt Psychology\n\nA. Gestalt psychology have been assimilated into modern psychology, and therefore Gestalt psychology has lost its distinctiveness as a school.\n\nB. Gestalt psychology influenced cognitive psychology and social psychology."
