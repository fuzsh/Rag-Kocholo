        "text": "Yale Child Study Center Senior Research Scientist Richard Aslin has been selected as the 2023 recipient of the Kurt Koffka Medal. He will accept the award on July 12, 2023 at Justus-Liebig-University Giessen in Germany, where he will deliver a talk entitled “The role of learning, memory, and attention in perceptual development.”\n\nKoffka was a German psychologist and one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. He worked at the University of Giessen from 1911 to 1927 and at Smith College in Northampton MA from 1927 until his death in 1941. To honor Koffka’s legacy, the Giessen Department of Psychology has awarded the medal annually since 2007 to internationally outstanding researchers for excellent achievements in the field of perceptual or developmental psychology.\n\nAslin has been on the Yale faculty since 2017 after spending 33 years at the University of Rochester. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society of Experimental Psychologists."
