        "text": "More Than Parallel Lines: Back to ContentsThoughts on Gestalt, Albers, and the BauhausKaren KoehlerAn undated sketch in the collection of the Anni and Josef Albers Foundationbears a striking resemblance to the well-known Gestalt diagram about the na-ture of human perception (figs. 13 and 14). First published by Edgar Rubin in1914, the Gestalt illustration asks the basic question: Do you see a vase or twofaces? The point is that there is no absolute answer—what we see depends onwhat our brains decide is true at a given moment. This simple exercise has beenused to demonstrate that we need to interrogate the concrete actualities of im-ages and objects. There are, in fact, different realities—one based on materialityand one based in perception. The drawing by Albers, although perhaps morecomplex because of the irregularity of the curving lines, suggests that he, too,was working out ideas about how humans perceive figure-ground relationships. Figure 13 (left): Josef Albers, Untitled sketch, n.d. Drawing on paper. The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation (1976.3.547). Figure 14 (right): Figure and Ground Study, after Edgar Rubin, Synsoplevede Fig- urer: Studier i psykologisk Analyse (Copenha- gen: Gyldendal, 1915). Taken broadly, these images raise what is perhaps the most essential philosoph- ical question: What is real? And, by extension: Where is meaning located—in materiality, or in our brains? This complex exchange between our cognitive perceptions and the physical substance of objects or images was at the core of the phenomenological problems that interested not only the Gestalt psycholo- gists, but also many Bauhaus teachers as they sought to radicalize the teaching and making of art. As Albers wrote in an essay for Bauhaus 2/3, in 1928, two separate elements are able to form “at least one interesting relation that is more than just the sum of those elements.”1 Similar to the oft-cited phrase that the “whole is more than the sum of its parts,” the Bauhaus teacher aligned his anal- ysis of formal relationships with the language of Gestalt psychology concur- rently evolving in Germany. Or did he? Connections between Gestalt psychology and the pedagogies and artistic prac- tices of the famous art school, the Bauhaus, have been debated for years—most recently in a series of published emails between a group of Bauhaus scholars and the descendants of the original Gestalt psychologists that were published in the journal Gestalt Theory.2 We do know that there were at least a couple of definite interfaces. In the 1930–31 school year, Karlfried Graf von Dürkheim came from Leipzig to hold a series of lectures on Gestalt at the Bauhaus. Detlef Mertins suggested that it was Hannes Meyer, director of the Bauhaus from 1928 to 1930, who wanted to expose students to connections between “the psy- chic and the social,” although the invitation to Dürkheim may have come from the student council.3 According to Hannes Beckmann, who was then a student: “Up until this time design problems were more or less solved on the feeling level. It looked as if the artist asked the scientists for reassurance that they were on the right track. The Gestalt psychologists had, after all, for years in- vestigated how we perceive and interpret form and color in the mind.”4 Another possible connection, although one based on anecdotal recollection, is a lecture in 1929 at the Bauhaus reportedly given by Karl Duncker, the assistant to the one of the leading figures of the Berlin School of Gestalt psychology, Wolfgang Köhler. Duncker had extended the study of induced motion, central to Gestalt theory, into questions of memory function and environmental perception, and Marianne Teuber wrote in 1973 of the influence of this lecture on the work of Paul Klee.5 Others have written about similar points of contact, influences, common con- cepts, and parallel interests. For example, there has been some focus on con- nections between Gestalt theory and the pedagogies of both Klee and Wassily Kandinsky who contributed to the Vorkurs, the foundations courses at the Bau-46 Karen Koehler haus—the cornerstone of the reformation of art education at the school. In theVorkurs, instead of mimetic copying, students were taught to focus on the ab-stract properties of color, form, and material.6 Yet, outside of a few suggestionsof formal comparisons, or second hand stories of the artists mentioning Gestalt,documents that give evidence of precise exchanges between the Bauhaus andthe psychologists remain elusive. Inaccurate narratives about the anti-historicalnature of the Bauhaus have confused the situation, and the reliance on memoirsor recollections have led to a weak analysis of what any connections between theinstitutions might have meant. In the 1919 Bauhaus Manifesto, Walter Gropius (the founder and first direc-tor of the Bauhaus) spoke of the vielgliedrige Gestalt, or “composite character,”of the work of architecture. In the Manifesto—a proclamation attached to thefirst official Bauhaus program of study—Gropius wrote of the need for archi-tects, painters and sculptors to come together in the revolutionary aftermathof World War I to create the total work of art.7 Gropius’s idealized conceptof the work of architecture as a Gesamtkunstwerk could be seen as generallyGestalt-like in its holistic vision. In a collection of Bauhaus reminiscences from1970, T. Lux Feininger wrote of the connections between the Bauhaus and ideasof Gestaltung, or totalities, in Gropius’s early thinking, and in the designation ofthe Bauhaus as a Hochschule für Gestaltung.8 In a largely ignored passage of thefounding program, Gropius also wrote of his intention to bring to the Bauhaus“training in science and theory.” This included not only the science of materialsand of color, but also “art history—not presented in the sense of a history ofstyles, but rather to further active understanding of historical working methodsand techniques.”9 Gropius linked scientific and art historical theory in the veryfirst publication outlining the directions of his radical new art school, suggest-ing that he was aware of current debates in the discipline of art history, betweenKunstgeschichte (art history) and Kunstwissenschaft (the scientific study of art).10 In an interview recorded in 1968, nearly five decades later, Albers mentionedan exchange he had in Dessau, with the Gestalt psychologists about his ideason form. According to Albers, the scientists only confirmed his conclusions thatin early childhood we have clearer recognition of three dimensions over twodimensions.11 Hearing Albers speak these words makes them seem more factual,but there is still a problem here. Does it matter that we are reconstructing thishistory based on reminiscences? Are we missing the relational aesthetic—whatmight be seen as a requisite for any Gestaltish-art history of the Bauhaus? I’d like to take a somewhat different approach, and accept for a moment that weare looking at parallel institutions; think of the Bauhaus as one straight line andthe Berlin School of Gestalt psychology as another. What would it take to seeMore than Parallel Lines: Thoughts on Gestalt, Albers, and the Bauhaus 47 them as separate but relational, as two parts of a linked historical cluster? What are the connections between these tandem histories and the work of Josef Al- bers—that is, how might we in fact find the Gestalt in some of his art? A The Berlin School began in the first decade of the twentieth century and was firmly established in the immediate postwar period with the appointment of Wolfgang Köhler and Max Wertheimer to posts at the University of Berlin.12 The Bauhaus was established in 1919 with the appointment of Gropius, al- though the school was in many ways an outgrowth of prewar developments in the teaching of the applied arts, as well as institutions like the Deutscher Werkbund.13 In Germany at the time, the relatively new field of psychology— which combined elements of the human and natural sciences—was housed in departments of philosophy. The need to establish experimental laboratories was a continual challenge. The conservatism of the German university system also made it difficult to operate as a laboratory science within the humanistic discipline of philosophy and to introduce the new concepts of Gestalt, which studied human and natural phenomena with the goal of integrating the inani- mate object with what was perceived in the mind into a single scientific struc- ture. The Bauhaus was an institution that merged the study of aesthetics with the making of objects, combining theories of form with requisite work in one of the craft studios. Gropius also challenged conservative academic structures when he combined the Weimar School of Arts and Crafts with the Academy of Fine Arts. Each studio at the Bauhaus was led by a craft master and a form master, in order to bring together instruction in the applied arts and the aes- thetics of form. Thus, both the Berlin School and the Bauhaus were committed to “role hybridization”; the psychologists were to be philosophers and experi- mental practitioners, while the Bauhäusler were studying to be both artists and craftsmen (and women) or designers.14 Both the Gestalt psychologists and the Bauhaus artists lost their positions when the National Socialists came to power; many were forced into exile in the United States and elsewhere. Some of the scientists and artists remained in Germany, and despite the reputation of the Bauhaus and the Berlin School as standing in opposition to fascism, continued to work under the Third Reich. Tools of Weimar psychology were used by the Nazis to determine the suit- ability of individuals to join the SS, and the plans of Auschwitz were drawn by a Bauhaus-trained architect.15 After World War II, and during much of the Cold War, both Gestalt psychology and the Bauhaus were historically over-sim- plified, frequently misunderstood, and eventually fell out of favor—replaced by behaviorism and post-modernism, respectively. Over two decades of new48 Karen Koehler scholarship has transformed the scholarly position of the Bauhaus, includingtwo comprehensive exhibitions in 2009. Rigorous and meticulous books, articlesand essay collections began to emerge after German reunification, and thesecomplex analyses of individual artists, mediums, and practices have exposed adifferent and more diverse Bauhaus, with a complicated historical path.16 Yet,the “Bauhaus” is still used as a stylistic term, which can somehow stand in formodernism around the globe. The term “Gestalt” was appropriated by whatcame to be called “Gestalt therapy,” a psychotherapeutic practice that emergedin the 1940s, became especially popular for its “holistic approach” during the1960s and 70s, and continues as a clinical practice today. Although there is someshared lineage, Gestalt therapy bears almost no resemblance to the rigorousexperimental science of the Berlin School.17 But the question remains: Are these sample elements of their parallel histo-ries simply the result of the same historical and political trajectories? Are theyreally commonalities or are they rather coincidences? In other words, do thesimilarities have any meaning? AThe principal scientists to come out of the Berlin Gestalt group—Max Wert-heimer and Wolfgang Köhler, as well as Kurt Koffka—rejected previous psycho-logical theories about the role of sensations in the mitigation of materiality andperception. Sensations, according to the Gestalt school, are physical things; theyexist in actuality. Perceptions, by contrast, are classified as mental events, andwhile we may regard them as faithful representations of objective reality, theyare not. Frederic Schwartz explains this idea succinctly: “Gestalt psychologyrepresents a theory about the way sensations are ordered by the mind, how sen-sations (which are external) are turned into perceptions (which define the junc-ture of living being and world, subject and object.)”18 Or as Mitchell Ash insists,Wertheimer, Köhler and Koffka never actually claimed “the whole is more thanthe sum of its parts.” For the Gestaltists, when we experience objects—and rela-tionships between objects—these are “fundamentally different from collections ofsensations, parts, or pieces.”19 What we perceive is based upon structures, uponexpected or found patterns of relationships. They were studying the aestheticsof what we recognize as an inherent order to things. Gestalt is not so muchabout the whole, as it is about relationality—about seeing patterns and formingconnections. We know that Josef Albers was intensely interested in the ways in which weperceive colors, separate from their physical realities—in this way, he was con-cerned with the Gestalt of colors. As other essays in this volume show, theMore than Parallel Lines: Thoughts on Gestalt, Albers, and the Bauhaus 49 Figure 15: Josef Albers, Bei Haus 2 (At origins of his approach to color was complex,Home 2), 1928-1929.

We conceptually group together forms due to their proximation, and we see elements that look alike as belonging together. I believe that the best evidence of Gestalt at the Bauhaus is in the way that Albers anticipated and manipulated this perceptual phenomenon. For example, in a work called Bei Haus 2 (At Home 2) from 1928-1929, Albers mounted two photographs, stacked, of trees and their shad- ows (fig. 15). There are two sets of patterns working simultaneously—the bare trees create a constellated pattern of vertical lines, while the shadows create a second set of horizontal lines that operate as a separate pattern. Which shadow comes from which tree is indistinguish- able—and irrelevant. Furthermore, when seen together, the trees (or shadows) in each of the two photographs combine to create a shared relational structure that jumps from one image to the next. Significantly, these are photographs, not paintings. These relationships occurred in nature (botanical and atmo- spheric) and were made by nature (the mechanical and chemical properties of photography and the synapses of the brain). Albers saw them, captured them with his camera, and produced two gelatin silver prints. At first we see the phe- nomenon as simply objective—something that occurred in the physical world. However, the doubling effect of the two photographs demonstrates that they are, in fact, not something that simply occurred in the material world, or something that is sensed as natural phenomena. As the patterns move from one picture to the next, and create a structure of pure lines and shapes, it is clear that this abstracting phenomenon is a matter of perception. 50 Karen Koehler Figure 16: Josef Albers, Hochbauten [Sky- scrapers], ca. 1929. Sandblasted glass with black paint, 13 3/8 x 13 1/8 in. (34 x 33.5 cm). The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation (1976.6.9). This kind of patterning is precisely what Albers constructed in his “Skyscrap-er” series from 1929 (fig. 16). In these sandblasted glass paintings, Albers useda series of stacked horizontal shapes to create his forms. Yet, because of theirrepetition and their proximity, we read them first as a series of vertical shapes. Itis only at the moment of the second, analytical look that we become aware thatthe “skyscraper” forms are made of identical horizontal forms. This perceptual tendency to constellate shapes was demonstrated in illustra-tions for Wertheimer’s article on “Gestalt laws” in an issue of PsychologischeForschung published as a Festschrift for Carl Stumpf in 1923. One examplepresents rows of circles and dots to reveal the organizing tendencies in vision,specifically the effects of proximity and similarity (fig. 17).

Another example that expands the workings of these relational structures, and the foundational principals of perceptual organization, is one of Albers’s best- known works, his Stacking Tables from 1927 (fig. 20). Both functional and playful, these tables not only have the same constellated characteristics of horizontal and vertical groupings, they are also dynamic—we can arrange (and perceive) the groupings according to proximities that we control. The “Gestalt switch” is thrown not only through pictorial experimentation, but also in a purposefully designed functional set of objects. Albers’s tables make up a constantly shifting set of groupings, and because of the descending/ascending colored surfaces create a subtle perception of movement even when they are still. This perceptu- al phenomenon bares some resemblance to Max Wertheimer’s groundbreaking 1912 experiments (fig. 21). Based on a complicated series of experiments with an apparatus known as the tachistoscope, Wertheimer proved that apparent (as 52 Karen Koehler Figure 20 (top left): Josef Albers, Stacking Tables, ca. 1927.

We don’t just mentally absorb the rhyming forms; they become visual wholes at the moment when we perceive them, and it is our perception that activates them. The shapes that exist in the works of art also exist in our perception. They are not established by a binary of images and a representation of those images, but by structural principals that are similar in both the objects and our mental processes. Certainly this kind of “Gestalt seeing” was not the only theoretical resource that influenced Albers’s work at the Bauhaus. For example, Kandinsky’s book, Point and Line to Plane—published as a Bauhausbücher in 1926—also explored in some detail the properties of repeating lines and shapes. Indeed, many provoca- tive comparisons can be drawn between the illustrations in Kandinsky’s treatise and Albers’s art from approximately this time. Furthermore, like the Gestalt- ists, Kandinsky wrote of the need for a desired unison, or harmony, between what he called the “inner” and “outer” and encouraged an understanding of composition as: the internally purposive subordination 1. of individual elements 2. of the structure [construction] to a concrete pictorial goal.23 Yet, Kandinsky always maintained a distinction between the image and the viewer, and relied on sensations to link the object and subject—precisely what the Gestaltists disavowed as too exclusively of the physical world. Whether or not we accept Gestalt theory as convincing—or Bauhaus theory for that matter—an important takeaway is that by collapsing perception into form, the Gestaltist implied that objects have meanings as well as qualities. In other words, because we cognitively activate form, we give abstract shapes con- ceptual content. In fact, seeing the Gestalt in art exposes the multiplicities of meaning that are possible in any given perceived object or image. Albers, then, created his designs with an implicit understanding that humans operate with innate mental formulas that determined the way we perceive objects. These are not just abstract shapes and forms. They are, in fact, all content—a fusion of mind and matter. A If we think back to our two parallel institutions—our two parallel lines of the Bauhaus and the Berlin School—and see a correlation there, then it follows that this historical relationality should mean something. These institutions both were complex organizations born of, yet challenging to, the culture of the Wei- mar Republic. The search for new ways to describe the phenomena of parts and wholes, things and ideas, was surely linked to the traumas and catastrophic54 Karen Koehler changes of the first part of the twentieth century, culminating in World War Iand the German Revolution: Rapid industrialization and mechanization; drasticchanges to the organization of labor; new forms of communication such as theradio and cinema and the consequent growth of mass audiences. The “crisis inscience” that helped propel the Gestalt psychologists was part of the same socialand economic equation that caused an upheaval in the realms of art, architec-ture, photography, and applied design, and which therefore contributed to thecreation of institutions like the Bauhaus. As Ash writes, the German psycholo-gists had become immersed in the debates “over matters of the soul in a mod-ernizing society” and this comment could apply just as easily to the artists of theBauhaus.24 Gropius’s call for a vielgliedrige Gestalt in art and architecture, and theGestaltists’s call for unity of mind and matter, were surely both part of a desirefor wholeness that stretched across classes, parties, and professions in WeimarGermany, as individuals and institutions searched for a way to make sense of adisrupted world and to redefine what it meant to be human in a country that hadbeen so deeply fractured by violence and upheaval. Is a Gestalt-inspired history of the Bauhaus possible to construct? If we ac-cept the importance of connected structures, such a history would require amethodology in which everything becomes part of the reconstruction—past,present, evidentiary, archived, recorded and remembered. As we have seen, muchof the history of Gestalt at the Bauhaus is based on the unscientific data ofanecdote and recollection. Furthermore, the premise of Gestalt theory is thatthe way in which humans perceive material structures must be universal. If allhuman beings possess innate neural mechanisms that reduce complex images tosimpler, more concise forms and consistently see the same patterns and group-ings, perceptions are not subjective and cannot be individually or contextuallydetermined. Variations in human perception brought about by ethnicity, geogra-phy or chronology—in other words, historical contexts—have no place in thoserelations between thing and thinking, or between shape and recognition, thatcharacterize Berlin Gestalt at its core. Gestalt theory, therefore, seems to rejectits use as a methodology based in temporal analysis, and the Bauhaus as aninstitution reflective of its moment in time is uneasily examined by Gestalt’suniversalist eye. However, some experimental psychologists insisted on the in-clusion of time in the process. In his critique of the overly objective findingsof the Berlin group, Felix Krueger emphasized the importance of feeling andwill in our desire to create “cultured wholes.”25 The insistence on generalizedcharacteristics was also complicated by Wertheimer’s later studies, in which heexplored how perception is influenced by memory practices, and recognized thatmemory is individualized as well as culturally determined.26More than Parallel Lines: Thoughts on Gestalt, Albers, and the Bauhaus 55 Regardless, the abstract, formal properties explored in Bauhaus designs and the psychological universalisms revealed in Gestalt experiments did not change the historical circumstances of the artists and scientists. Both groups were seen as part of a dangerous leftist intelligentsia, and the work of the Bauhaus artists and Gestalt psychologists were viewed with derision as the Weimar Repub- lic moved further and further to the right. The Bauhaus was closed for good shortly after a raid of their temporary quarters in Berlin in 1933, having been shut down by the Nazi party in Dessau the year before. Although it continued to operate under Nazi supervision until 1942, by 1935 Köhler and his associates had been forced out. The Jewish backgrounds of many of the scientists, such as Wertheimer, affected their ability to gain academic posts, publish, and ulti- mately led to their dismissal and in many cases, emigration. This was also true for Bauhäuslers like Anni Albers, who left Germany for the U.S. in 1933 with her husband Josef. A It is worth looking here at one more documented contact between a Gestaltist and the Bauhaus. In 1927 Rudolf Arnheim visited Dessau to write a review of the Bauhaus building for the journal Weltbühne, where he worked as a cultural critic and editor. Trained in Berlin by Köhler and Wertheimer, Arnheim did not go on to practice experimental psychology. Rather, he developed a unique, Ge- stalt-inspired cultural criticism. Arnheim is mostly known today for his writings on film and art theory, composed after his emigration to the U.S., including two influential texts, Toward a Psychology of Art (1949) and Art and Visual Perception (1954). In a letter to Roy Behrens many years later, Arnheim dismissed his visit to the Bauhaus as insignificant—“it was summer and nobody, either famous or infamous, was around that I recall.”27 Yet, his essay can offer rich insights into the institutional exchanges that we have been considering. Arnheim began by setting the Bauhaus building apart from its territory: “Sepa- rated by the railway from the thick nest of dusty, peak-roofed, small-town hous- es and so already isolated in their exterior setting, sit two gigantic, blindingly white blocks…” He went on: The will to cleanliness, clarity, and boldness in design has won a victory here…. Every single thing shows its design: no screw is hidden, no decora- tive carved work to conceal which raw material has been processed there. One is solely tempted to evaluate this honesty also in moral terms.28 Arnheim referred to the Bauhaus as a “house of pure function” and described the building in strikingly Gestaltish terms: “a house containing a thousand different things that can be perceived as a structured totality.... Everything depends on how one thing relates to another.” The Bauhaus, he wrote, rep-56 Karen Koehler resents a “generally valid psychological phenomenon that leads to very similarresults from different people.” And, although he did not hesitate to add that thebuilding is perhaps guilty of pretension, he affirms that it is “so good that, forthe moment, nothing else is important…. The point is made here more clearlythan ever that the practical is really at the same time the beautiful.”29 Arnheimfound exactly those kinds of relationships between structures and cognitionthat emerged from Gestalt experiments in perception: Patterns and structuresin the physical substance of the building are perceived by the viewer as a simi-larly structured totality. At the same time, two concepts, the moral and the beautiful, distinguish Arn-heim’s analysis and seem to underscore a different kind of result, one that linksthese formal properties to something beyond the building itself—to what aresurely subjective notions of beauty, while perhaps also signaling the relationshipof the Bauhaus to the moral values of his time. Moreover, in one of his firstessays published in English, in 1943, Arnheim claimed that the Gestalt approachwas simply a scientific “style,” analogous to styles in art. He placed the scientificmovement in the past, as part of a wave of “romanticism” in Germany—with a“kinship to poets and thinkers of the past, the nearest in time being Goethe.”30Writing now against the backdrop of yet another world war, Arnheim saw Ge-stalt psychology as a project of the past—a movement to save the study ofperception from rationalism and restore to it a vitality of the human spirit. Thereference to Goethe, as a pinnacle of poetic German culture, was surely meantto set him and others like him apart from the brutal repressions of the Naziregime. AAs discussed above, Albers wrote in 1928: Adding one element to another element should yield at least one interesting relation that is more than just the sum of those elements. The more variable and intensive the relations that arise, the more valuable the result, the more productive the work.31Not only was Albers describing his own teaching method at the Bauhaus, hewas clearly echoing the ideas of Gestalt as he understood them. He was alsogiving us a prescription for how we might think about these artists, scientists,and thinkers, seen against the backdrop of a troubled moment in history. Preciseconclusions might remain elusive—the relationships might be variable—but welearn much about art, history, and science through our comparative efforts.More than Parallel Lines: Thoughts on Gestalt, Albers, and the Bauhaus 57 Notes 1.

Albers published another version three years later in VI Interna- tionaler Kongress für Zeichne, Kunstunterricht und Angewandte Kunst in Prague, 1928 (Prague, 1931). This later version was included in a special issue on Albers, AA Files 67 (2013): 129– 131. According to the endnotes, this was a revised version of a translation first published in Hans M. Wingler, Bauhaus: Weimar, Dessau, Berlin, Chicago (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1969). Pelkonen references the 1928 original in her essay, and offers some of the sharpest insights into Albers’ philosophy; I am deeply indebted not only to the material in her essay, but also its approach.

The Leipzig scientists were the first to establish an experimental lab, and their ideas about Ganzheitspsychologie (holistic psychology) were closely aligned to that of the Berlin Gestaltists with some important differences. Some Leipzig psychologists, such as Felix Krüger, claimed that their theories of perception predated that of Wertheimer and Köhler—although evidence offered then by the Berlin group and now by historians seems to indicate that the precise workings of Gestalt were clearly established in Berlin, and that the Leipzig group was creating a new mix of their original findings with Gestalt conclusions.

The German text in this excerpt from Wertheimer’s article reads as follows: 6. In all cases under discussion, a first simple principle can be seen: Dots separated by small distances group naturally. Perceptual grouping of dots with large separations does not arise, or does so only with great effort, and is less stable. In a provisional formulation: All else being equal, perceptual grouping tends to form more easily across smaller separa- tions. (Factor of proximity.) This is a most general and ubiquitous principle of perceptual grouping, and is not con- fined to visual grouping, nor even spatial experience.

Much of the article he sent to Barrett, Sam Hunter’s “Josef Albers:‘Prophet and Presiding Genius of American OP Art,’” detailed the artist’s dif-ficulty in finding acceptance among the aesthetic trends of his adopted countryand his self-understanding as having been “the black sheep” among such Amer-ican avant-garde artists of the 1940s and 1950s as Jackson Pollock, Willem deKooning, and Franz Kline.3 Indeed, Albers had garnered less critical attentionthan those aligned with so-called Painterly Abstraction. However, as the Voguearticle’s reverential title indicates, by 1970 Hunter—as well as the curator Wil-liam C. Seitz, who praised Albers as a “master of perceptual abstraction”—hadrecognized how the artist’s work modeled the perceptual practices for whichpainters such as Richard Anuszkiewicz and Julian Stanczak were known.4 Andalthough the “master” disliked the term itself, op art represented an apotheo-sis of painting to Albers, who claimed that “only when our minds are directedthrough appropriate juxtapositions (combination[s]) and constellations (place-ments) of color and shape will we sense their relatedness and mutual actions;then to see art will become a creative act.”5 Unfortunately, for Albers, Hunter and Seitz held a minority opinion at the time;the relevance of Albers’s interest in perception did not resonate with parallel problems being pursued in postwar American painting, a situation that Albers and his proponents were unable to circumvent. Many artists affiliated with op art were derided for their emphasis on psychophysical effects and for the asso- ciation of their work with fashion. (Albers’s choice to send Barrett a copy of an essay published in Vogue, albeit one written by a highly regarded art historian and curator, was somewhat ironic.) And many critics were unable to disassociate Albers from the Bauhaus and problems of painting related to an early twenti- eth-century European tradition. (Barrett actually didn’t consider Albers’s work to be op art: “[Albers] is usually classed among the Op artists, yet many, if not most, of his paintings are not Op at all—certainly not ‘hard core’ Op.”6) As the discrepancy between the views of Hunter and Barrett indicate, scholars and critics found it difficult to classify Albers’s work, or even to consider it under the umbrella of op art—an association the artist himself embraced.7 This essay ex- plores Albers’s relationship to American art critical discourse on painting in the 1960s, exposing the tenuous position of his work and ideas therein. Ultimately, it posits a relationship between Albers and Robert Irwin’s dematerialized paint- ings and installations, the latter being an extension of Albers’s aesthetic but unencumbered by traditions of painting and thus able to realize Albers’s vision more completely. In the mid-1960s, the positioning of a painter’s work in relation to the rapidly changing understanding of the artist–object–viewer nexus would prove crucial as discursive trends developed. The terms of this discourse were elaborated in a number of important exhibitions. Along with Clement Greenberg’s 1964 exhi- bition “Post Painterly Abstraction” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Lawrence Alloway’s “Systemic Painting” exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in 1966, “The Responsive Eye,” held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, helped establish the stakes of abstract painting in the wake of Abstract Expressionism and in opposition to pop art. Although there was significant overlap among artists included in these exhibitions (Ellsworth Kelly, Thomas Downing, Kenneth Noland, and Frank Stella were shown in each), the critical frameworks in which the respective exhibitions operated differed significantly.8 Seitz, who curated “The Responsive Eye” and objected to the term “op art,” cast the objects included in the exhibition as devices that affect viewer perception and thereby viewer psychology.9 Their historical significance was measured by their relation to a tradition of art-making informed by physiological and psycholog- ical understandings of perception developed since the late nineteenth century, yet the exhibited works also engaged issues relevant to contemporary aesthet- ics. In Seitz’s view, the lack of personal marks on the surfaces of the works, as well as the materials out of which many were made, constituted a visual66 Jeffrey Saletnik economy that drew attention away from artistic subjectivity and/or the objects’form, and toward the perceptual—and psychophysical—response of the view-ers: some found the show literally nauseating. This ran counter to Greenberg’sassertion that work from some of the very same artists indicated an evolutionfrom Painterly Abstraction (which, to Greenberg, had become an aesthetic hab-it by the 1960s) to Post Painterly Abstraction—work that favored “opennessof design,” “linear clarity,” and “contrasts of pure hue.”10 These recent formaltrends constituted a style in keeping with the modernist ontology of painting ashermetic and bound to the essential flatness of the painting surface.11 They alsoemphasized opticality as the primary condition of painting.12 Whereas Seitzprioritized viewer response and Greenberg pointed out how aspects of recentwork corresponded to the integral nature of painting, Alloway was interestedin the artist as conceiver of the “syntax” for his or her painting. In the essaythat accompanied his “Systemic Painting” exhibition, Alloway stressed that oneought to attend to the organization of a painting as the result of an artist’s hu-man effort —its system, which could “occur off the canvas”—and thereby viewit as both a personal and a “factual display” rather than merely as a work thatexists in service of aesthetic ideals.13 Works by Albers, Anuszkiewicz, and Stanczak were included only in “TheResponsive Eye,” thus indicating their positioning relative to this discourse:To invoke Albers’s terminology, their work engaged the dialectic between the“physical fact” of the object and its “psychic effect” upon the viewer. Greenberg,who like most critics associated Albers with the Bauhaus and thereby with prac-tices that predated Painterly Abstraction, made clear how the formal linearityhe observed in Post Painterly Abstract painting was a response to the painterlyaspects of the style’s immediate predecessor (Painterly Abstraction) rather thana reintroduction of the geometries associated with “Mondrian, the Bauhaus,Suprematism, or anything that came before.”14 Whereas Albers’s painting andGreenberg’s vision were formally incompatible, one might argue that Albers’sHomage to the Square series in fact suited Alloway’s criteria.15 Certainly, Albers’srepetitive use of nested squares of color over a sixteen-year period by the timeof Alloway’s exhibition amounted to an artist-generated syntax based upon amodule, “the run of [which] constitutes a system,...which we learn empiricallyby seeing enough of the work.”16 His Homage to the Square series was by nomeans conceptual art, but Alloway and others—including Albers himself—largely overlooked its significance as part of a sustained practice. Rather, forAlbers, each of his paintings maintained its individuality insofar as each work“proclaim[ed] color autonomy as a means of plastic organization” differentlyand originally.17Juxtapositions and Constellations: Josef Albers and Op Art 67 Figure 23: Cover, Vogue (U.S.), June 1965. And so the paintings were received, at times, to mixed reviews. In 1964 DonaldMontage with photograph by Irene Penn Judd described even Albers’s “first rate” paintings as “pat” and “predictable.”18and serigraph construction by Gerald Barbara Rose, in contrast, noted how Albers’s work sought to bring color andOster. structure into relationship with each other, thus engaging the “two main cur- rents” of twentieth-century art initiated by Matisse and Picasso, respectively.19 It was with these artists, along with Kandinsky, that she placed Albers. In her review of “The Responsive Eye” she singled out the work of Albers, Ad Rein- hardt, and others in the exhibition as “art of the highest order” in which percep- tual effect “[did] not constitute the entire content of the work.”20 But in doing so, she disassociated Albers from op art, and went along with critics who found that his work resonated with problems of painting posit- ed at the beginning of the twentieth century rather than contemporary trends. Like the majority of the art criti- cal establishment, she condemned “The Responsive Eye” and, by extension, op art. It lacked “expressive content,” she claimed; op art was “sensational” and “hip”; its artists traded in optical trickery to elicit immediate, visceral re- sponses from viewers. Op art, she added, was “decorative,” “easily-experienced,” and designed to satisfy an “appetite for popular entertainment”—comments that were intended to evoke long-standing anxieties about modernity. Indeed, if not actually a byproduct of modernity, op art seemed to have a complacent relationship with modernity that was troubling; Alloway, for example, noted how the conditions that gave rise to its appeal challenged the au- thority of critics writing for “specialized journals.”21 In an issue of Vogue (U.S.) published in the same year (1970) as Hunter’s laudatory article about Albers, one found a lavish- ly illustrated article devoted to an “op-art-ment” designed by François Catroux. Notably, in June of 1965 the maga- zine’s U.S. cover had featured an image of a model’s face overlaid with moiré patterns by Gerald Oster (fig. 23).22 In April of 1965 Life magazine featured the high-end textiles that Larry Aldrich famously—and controversially—based on paintings by Bridget Riley and other artists.23 Rather than entering the dis- course and popular consciousness after having been vetted by art critics and historians, op art found its admirers—and established its value—in popular magazines, leaving serious art critics, according to Alloway, little choice in their response other than disdain. 68 Jeffrey Saletnik Despite being met with disapproval by most art critics, op art’s prominence Figure 24 (left): Josef Albers, Homage to the Square: Wondering, 1964.

The crafting of such images was key to the color studies he asked students to complete. For example, Plate VII-5b from Interaction of Color (fig. 25) shows how the ground upon which a color is placed can radically affect the way in which it is perceived. In the uppermost pair of rectangles, the diagonal stripes (from left to right) are ochre and Naples yellow, but they appear to be nearly the same hue when placed, respectively, upon deep red and off-white grounds. (The “factual” colors are indicated in the lowermost rectangles on the page.) By exchanging the ground colors the image draws attention to the relativity of color percep- 70 Jeffrey Saletnik tion, bringing the stripes closer to, yet still not in perfect consonance with, their“factual” hues. Richard Anuszkiewicz, who studied with Albers between 1953 and 1955 andis commonly associated with op art, used the lessons of Albers’s instructionas the basis of his own painting practice. In The Sounding of the Bell (fig. 26)he exploits the optical effect of adding color to the picture plane in preciselymeasured parallel lines. These lines, juxtaposed with the painting’s red ground,create the presence of colors not materially present on the surface while alsomining perspectival conventions to create the appearance of depth and projec-tion simultaneously. Rosalind Krauss, extending Greenberg’s prioritization ofpainting as a purely optical art, wrote that op art actually was “compulsive[ly]illusionist” and based upon the crafting of “trompe l’oeil tactility;” it didn’t mat-ter, as in Anuszkiewicz’s work, that dimensionality was “calculated to occur onthe retina” rather than upon painted surfaces themselves. Singling out Anusz-kiewicz’s contribution to “The Responsive Eye,” she wrote that the “picture’sstructure…depends not on color as a primary sensation but on its incidentalproperties for evoking value contrasts: the result is a work centered on a tactilemode….”27 Albeit an impressive manifestation of Albers’s aesthetic priorities, awork like The Sounding of the Bell ultimately could not evade the medium-spe-cific concerns of discourse on painting. Although op art was not aligned with dominant American discourse on ab-stract painting set forth by the likes of Greenberg, Alloway, and Krauss, it cor-responded to a nascent practice in which perception itself was employed as anartist’s medium. By the end of the 1960s Robert Irwin, who was among the art-ists included in “The Responsive Eye,” had pushed painting beyond the limita-tions of its material parameters in crafting work, as in his disc paintings, whichblurred the boundaries between the painted object and the space surroundingit.28 In 1970 he altered the fluorescent lighting scheme of an empty gallery inthe Museum of Modern Art and suspended a translucent scrim at the midpointand four feet from the ceiling, thereby creating, in a work known as “the roomat the Museum of Modern Art,” three zones of light intensity: above the scrim(and closest to the light source), as diffused by the scrim, and below the scrim.One’s ability to perceive the otherwise empty white-walled space constituted thework of art; as Irwin noted, “everything in the installation conspired to skewone’s expectations,...so that your perceptual mechanism became tilted, and youperceived the room as you otherwise might not have.”29 It is as though Irwinexpanded into three dimensions Albers’s practice of employing color and formto compose a painting based on unresolvable visual dissonance. In doing so, heasked those who experienced his work to grapple with their “being and circum-Juxtapositions and Constellations: Josef Albers and Op Art 71 Figure 27: Robert Irwin, Excursus: Homageto the Square³, Dia Center for the Arts, 548West 22nd Street, New York City, Sep-tember 13, 1998-June 13, 1999. © RobertIrwin/Artists Rights Society (ARS), NewYork.

The instal- lation, according to Irwin, “approach[ed] color as a kind of infinite possibility, as Albers did,” yet in lived space.31 For the first showing of the work, originally conceived for the Dia Center for the Arts exhibition space in New York City (now named Dia:Chelsea), Irwin used a floor-to-ceiling translucent scrim to divide one floor of the building into a double-walled grid of eighteen intercon- nected rooms of equal size. He mounted two vertical fluorescent light fixtures at the midpoint of walls throughout the space, covering the midsections of these fixtures with differently colored theatrical gels. As one wandered from room to room, the delicate mixture of colored light shifted subtly, while the sil- houettes of bodies elsewhere in the installation registered with varying degrees of clarity though layers of scrim and light, all of which made the viewer aware of him- or herself as but one of several shadowy forms moving in space. Thus, in unbinding his thinking from problems of painting and the making of discrete 72 Jeffrey Saletnik objects—as Albers, his critics, and Anuszkiewicz seemed unable to do—Irwinbrought the lessons of Albers’s perceptual practice to light.Notes1.

BarryIn 1972, when Josef Albers was in his eighties, he published Formulation : Ar-ticulation, a set of two boxed portfolios of silkscreen prints. With these pieces,Albers continued his lifelong exploration of the basic elements that make up animage—line, contour, lightness, and color. He aimed for simplicity, discipline,and efficiency, and wrote, In my own work I am content to compete with myself and to search with simple palette and with simple color for manifold instrumentation.1 At the time Josef Albers composed Formulation : Articulation, scientists wereusing microelectrodes to eavesdrop on the behavior of individual neurons inthe visual brain.2 In a striking confluence of science and art, they discoveredthat neurons early on in the visual pathway attend specifically to the very sameelements—line, contour, lightness, and color—that had preoccupied Albers formore than forty years.Lines and ContoursConsider, for example, Albers’s lyrical abstract work In the Water (fig. 28). Al-though In the Water contains only straight lines, the viewer perceives many curvylines sculpting vase-like figures running from top to bottom. In an analogousway, we see lines in nature where there are none, a phenomenon that is reflectedin even the simplest drawing. While an artist may draw an oval to represent aperson’s face, no such outline exists in real life. Is there something about ourvisual wiring that causes us to seek out such lines? Light from the sun or reflected off objects is absorbed by the rod and cone cellsin the retina at the back of the eye.

After hours of recordings, they finally discovered that an individual cell re-Figure 29 (right): Author-created sponds not to spots, but to bars of light or dark in a particular small region ofgrayscale version of figure 28. the visual field. Indeed, each neuron is sensitive to a narrow range of orienta- tions, some preferring horizontal bars, others vertical bars, and still others bars at various oblique angles. For every point in our visual field there are cells that are sensitive to each orientation.3 As light information is communicated from one cell to another along the visual pathway, we first detect a border or contour, then its orientation, and then the changes in orientation in order to perceive corners and curves.4 Although Albers had no knowledge of Hubel and Wiesel’s study, he came to the same conclusion about the tendency of our visual system to seek out lines and contours. In his drawing classes he gave his students exercises in line con- trol and measurement and taught them to represent objects “first and mainly by using lines, not shading.”5 Regarding In the Water, he wrote, “All lines exist only mathematically, that is, not by themselves but only as boundaries between different color areas.”6 Thus, when we gaze at the print and follow its sinuous 80 Susan R. Barry curves, we are witnessing a particularly beautiful example of our own visualprocesses at work.Lightness (Value)The borders between the different horizontal lines in In the Water are defined bydifferences in both color and lightness. When the color is removed (fig. 29), thegrayscale image allows us to see only the light and dark borders between thehorizontal lines. However, we still see the curvy lines and figures. Hence, in this image (though not in all cases), borders can be distinguished bylightness alone. Artists use the term “value” to define this sense of light anddark.7 Much more of our visual circuitry is devoted to signaling lightness than tosignaling color, so we can easily distinguish levels of lightness in a picture madeup of different shades of gray. However, most of us have a much harder timejudging levels of lightness in a colored image. As Albers was well aware, sen-sitivity to lightness must be trained. In his now legendary art classes, he wouldconfront his students with several pairs of colors, as in the figure below (fig. 30),and ask them to judge which color of the pair was darker and which was lighter. According to his report, 60 percent of his students answered incorrectly!8 Theywould have had more success if they had looked at the same image in grayscale(fig. 31).9 In each of the pairs, the upper member is easily seen as darker.

Color Albers called color the “most relative medium in art,” and our perception of color is a similarly complicated phenomenon.11 Part of the reason for this com- plexity is that, technically speaking, there is no color in the physical universe. What we perceive as color is really light of different wavelengths and inten- sities. Therefore, the perception of color, just like the sensation of pain or the feeling of pleasure, requires an individual to experience it. The color spectrum, starting with the shortest light wavelengths that we can see and moving to the longest, ranges from violet to blue to green to yellow to orange to red. Color perception begins with the absorption of light by short wavelength, medium wavelength, and long wavelength cone cells.12 Each type of cone cell responds to a broad range of wavelengths but has a particular 82 Susan R.

The peak sensitivity is in the violets for the short wavelengthcones, the greens for the medium wavelength cones, and the yellows for the longwavelength cones. Thus a given wavelength of light excites the three typesof cone cells to different extents, and the relative strength of their responsescontributes to the color we see. A color that we perceive as green excites theshort wavelength cone cells to a small extent, the long wavelength cone cells toa greater extent, and the medium wavelength cone cells the most. However, the perception of color, like the perception of light and dark, is basedalso on the context in which a particular color is perceived. Just as the light-ness of the gray Zs in figures 5a and 5b appears to vary depending on thebackground, a color’s appearance depends upon the colors that surround it. Forexample, as Bevil Conway discussed in a recent paper, the two Xs in the figurecreated by Albers above (fig. 33) are actually the same color, or hue; both reflectthe same light wavelengths back to our eyes.13 (This can be seen particularlyclearly at the point on the middle left where the two Xs connect.) Yet the X onthe gray background looks yellow, while the X on the yellow background looksgray. As with the Zs, the visual system in each case compares and subtracts thebackground color from the central image. This influence operates the most strongly when the two colors are directlyadjacent to each other. As Conway illustrated, the influence is mitigated simplyJosef Albers and the Science of Seeing 83 Figure 35a: Josef Albers,Formulation : Articulation, Folio I /Folder 5 [Homage to the Square], 1972.Screenprint, 15 x 20 in.

Intriguingly, scientists have uncovered neurons in the primary visual cortex that fire most actively not in response to a single color, but to the juxtaposition of two colors, particularly red next to cyan (a greenish blue), yellow next to blue, and black next to white.14 Although these neurophysiological discoveries were made after Albers taught and painted, he was well aware of these inter- actions of color. In his color classes, for example, he would distribute papers of different colors and instruct his students to place a small patch of one color against a background of another. With the right choice of two different back- ground colors, the identical central color could appear as two very different hues. Conversely, two different colors against different backgrounds could be made to look like one.15 He wrote, “Color, in my opinion, behaves like man—in 84 Susan R.

The two prints also produce different effects on differentviewers. In one version, the color of the central square may appear to come for-ward for some people but not for others.

The response of the visual system to adjacent colors illustrates a general prop- erty of perception. Under many circumstances, our brain does not care about absolutes, such as the exact wavelength of a given light ray. What it cares about is contrast, particularly contrast across local boundaries. By highlighting what is different between one area and another, like the Xs against the differently colored backgrounds, we are better able to pick out an object from its surround- ings, to distinguish figure from ground. For Albers, the importance of the relationship between colors, as opposed to the color itself, took on a moral character. When Albers wrote that colors exist in terms of “relationships with others” he was not only making a statement about perception or aesthetics. He thought of color, he said, as both “an individ- ual” and “a member of society”; “I’ve handled color as man should behave.... And from all this, you may conclude that I consider ethics and aesthetics as one.”19 86 Susan R. Barry Seeing the Whole PictureHowever, vision depends upon far more than the piecemeal construction of ascene from the basic elements of line, lightness, and color. This, too, was a con-cept that Albers demonstrated in his artwork and classes.20 Albers was intrigued,for example, by the phenomenon of transparency. In one exercise, he wouldchallenge his students to take a piece of paper that was opaque, and by placingit next to other colored papers, make it appear transparent or translucent.21 Oneexample is shown in figure 36. In this figure, a piece of opaque brown paper has been placed between the blueand orange ones. This juxtaposition makes the brown paper appear translucent,as if it is the part of the orange paper that is overlapping with and partiallyblocking our view of the blue paper below it. A grayscale version of this image(fig. 37) shows that the lightness or value of the brown paper is at an interme-diate level between that of the other two. This lightness arrangement follows ageneral rule for transparency: the transparent region must be of intermediatelightness with the regions that it borders.22 If the brown paper had been darkeror lighter than both of its neighbors, the illusion of transparency would disap-pear. In addition, the illusion of transparency is maintained only if we look at thepicture as a whole. If the view of either the orange or blue paper is obscuredso that the brown paper is viewed next to only one of its neighbors, it appearsopaque. Thus a scene cannot be perceived correctly in terms of a piecemealexamination of its individual parts but must be viewed as an integrated whole. Albers delighted particularly in the creation of ambiguous figures or imagesthat can be interpreted in more than one way. One example is the work titledSteps, the first work in his Formulation : Articulation portfolio (fig. 38). The larg-er image on the right appears to be a set of steps. Since the lowest step is thewidest, we see it first and read the steps as moving upward and away from us.But the smaller figure on the left is ambiguous. It can be seen as a set of stepsmoving toward us or away from us, a set in which only the middle step is reced-ing, or in five other ways. Art, Albers felt, much more than nature, could provide such challenges to ourvisual perception. Although all visual stimuli are potentially ambiguous, we areusually able to exploit a great number of clues in order to make sense of the realobjects around us. While looking at an actual staircase, for example, we exploitinformation from shadows, size, perspective, stereo vision, and its changing ap-pearance as we move. By removing such clues in the small figure in Steps, AlbersJosef Albers and the Science of Seeing 87 Figure 38: Josef Albers,Formulation : Articulation, Folio I /Folder I [“Steps”], 1972. Screenprint,15 x 20 in. (38.1 x 50.8 cm. Mead ArtMuseum, Amherst College; gift of theAlan M. Sternlieb Study Collection(1979.103.1.1.a). forces us to pay attention to the basic elements of the drawing—the lines and their interactions. Formulation : Articulation includes many additional images from his Graphic Tec- tonic series that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Two examples are Synopsis (fig. 39a) and Syntax (fig. 39b). About the latter painting Albers wrote, “Thus we cannot remain in a single viewpoint; we need more for the sake of FREE VISION.”23 Indeed, in his classes, Albers emphasized the role of changing view- points on perception by having his students view a target as they moved around it. Even when we look steadily at an image, our eyes make tiny scanning move- ments, and these shifts may contribute to multiple readings of an ambiguous figure. For example, the familiar Necker cube (fig. 40) can be seen in two ways, with either the cube’s lower surface or right surface facing front. These two views are associated with slightly different eye positions.24 Thus “free vision” in the most literal sense—free movement of the eyes—allows us to engage with ambiguous figures, from the iconic Necker cube to Albers’s more complex creations, and to switch from one interpretation to another. 88 Susan R.

Exactly how we make the perceptual switch between alternative readings ofSteps, Syntax, or any other ambiguous figure is not known, but science offerssome intriguing clues. While we may shift from one interpretation to another,we never entertain more than one at a time. The best we can do is switch rapidlyback and forth.Brain imaging reveals that far more of the brain is involved in viewing anambiguous figure than in viewing a stable, unambiguous one. Both types ofimages will excite the entire visual Figure 40: Example of the iconic Necker cube.system, but the ambiguous figure,such as the smaller image in Steps,will cause greater activation of areastoward the front of the brain, includ-ing regions of the fronto-parietaland frontal cortices.25 Taking intoaccount factors such as experience,expectations, and even our mood,these brain areas then provide high-er-level hypotheses about what weare viewing, entering into a dialoguewith the visual areas of the brain toconfirm or reject these hypotheses.Josef Albers and the Science of Seeing 89 For an image that can be interpreted in many different ways, this dialogue will be sustained for the entire time we view the image. Thus Albers’s Formulation : Articulation portfolio, like his Graphic Tectonic series as a whole and indeed, like all his art and teaching, achieves “manifold instrumentation” with only a “simple palette,” enlightening us all about visual perception and providing rich stimula- tion for the brain.
