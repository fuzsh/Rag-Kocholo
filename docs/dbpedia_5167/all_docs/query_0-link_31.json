German psychologists known as Gestaltists argued that consciousness cannot be reduced to isolated elements. They advocated studying mental experience holistically rather than analyzing individual elements. The three main Gestalt psychologists were Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang KÃ¶hler, who studied under Carl Stumpf and were influenced by Franz Brentano's idea of act psychology. They focused on how perceptions emerge as meaningful wholes rather than collections of sensations. The Gestaltists' work influenced later psychologists both in Germany and after they emigrated to the United States to escape Nazi rule.",
