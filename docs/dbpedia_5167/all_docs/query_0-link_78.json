        "text": "The third main category of moral theory is moral realism. Moral realism says that good and bad, right and wrong, exist in some fashion in this world, and independently of things like social customs, beliefs, or opinions. On the other hand, moral realism does not propose something as simple as a list of commandments delivered directly from God! Moral realism is the middle ground between the theological theories and moral relativism, and is the most common approach of philosophers.\n\nBut, as is usually the case with the middle ground, that is not an easy position to take. The big question that moral realists have to answer is “how do we know good and bad? how do we recognize right and wrong?” Because of the difficulty of this question, there are quite a few forms of moral realism.\n\nRationalist morality theories\n\nThe first group of theories I’d like to look at the rationalist moral theories. As the name indicates, these theories view morality as coming out of our capacity to think. Just like rationalist epistemology, the most basic form of rational moral truth is the one that is self-evident. This is the theory of intuitionism, which is best exemplified by the modern British philosopher G. E. Moore.\n\nJust like rationalistic epistemology, we can deduce from intuitions with formal logic. In other words, we can think our way to various moral principles. Kant promotes such an approach in what is known as formalism.\n\nA particularly popular form of rationalist morality is called contractarianism. It is associated with several influential philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau is responsible for the title and the basic idea: He suggested that, once upon a time, humanity was in a state of savage anarchy. Each person felt free to do whatever they needed to do to get what they wanted. However, the fact that everyone else was doing the same meant that no-one was really free at all. Whatever time they weren’t spending on getting what they needed would be spent protecting themselves from each other!\n\nSo, says Rousseau, our ancestors got together, sat down, and thought this through -- at least metaphorically. More literally, certain ways of dealing with anarchy evolved over thousands of years. But the principle is the same: We each agree to give up some of our freedom to take whatever we want, in order that we all can get what we need. The Social Contract, it’s called.\n\nThis idea was very influential in its time, especially on the American and French Revolutions. Our founding fathers quite literally outlined the processes of our government and the rights and obligations of the citizenry in a social contract known as the Constitution. We call our system democracy, of course, but the Constitution limits our democratic freedom -- the freedom of the majority -- in order to protect the minority. And since you never know when it’ll be your turn to be the minority, it has worked out quite well!\n\nNaturalistic moral theories\n\nThe next group of theories, as you might suspect, are founded on ideas of a more empirical nature. Here, morality is something you experience in some fashion. These theories are called naturalistic. The simplest suggests that we perceive good and bad quite directly, with a “sixth sense,” a moral sense. This is the brain child of the Earl of Shaftesbury. We often say to each other “that doesn’t look right,” and “can’t you see that that's wrong?”\n\nEgoism says that right and wrong can be perceived in terms of certain special feelings we call happiness. The term egoism is unfortunate here, because we tend to think in terms of selfishness and hedonism, which would be more appropriately placed under the subjectivist or emotivist form of relativism. The epicureans are examples of egoism: Things like friendship, honor, and even altruism give us certain positive emotions by which we recognize that they are good. Other things make us feel guilty or ashamed.\n\nAnalogous to contractarianism in the rational view, there is utilitarianism in the natural view. Invented by Jeremy Bentham and developed by the Mills, utilitarianism is best known for the phrase “the greatest happiness of the greatest number.” Like egoism, happiness is seen as the way in which we perceive good and bad. This time, however, it is not our own happiness alone, but the happiness of those around us as well.\n\nIntuitively, it is hard to disagree with the notion. But it is in fact a difficult one. How do you know if others are happy? We’re often not even certain if we ourselves are happy! What makes others happy may not be the same as what makes us happy. How are we to add up the various kinds of happiness? Is every person equal in the equation, or are some people’s happiness more important than others? What about the poor minority in this case: Is it okay for them to be unhappy, as long as the majority is happy? Bentham thought that we could develop a “hedonistic calculus” to figure these things out -- others are far from certain about that.\n\nAgain, our founding fathers were influenced by utilitarianism as well as the social contract, and the Declaration of Independence is loaded with utilitarian concepts (and contractarian ones!) Thomas Jefferson in particular was very interested in these issues.\n\nThere are many additional details to utilitarianism, and to many of these moral theories. But you will have to go to your local philosophy professor for those.\n\nOne of the things you may have spotted as you read the preceding paragraphs is that these rationalist and naturalist theories are not terribly exclusive: In fact, we could combine them all without stretching them too far out of shape. Just like the US has the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and just like science is a blend of rationalism and empiricism, we can use all six of the theories under moral realism at once!\n\nVirtue ethics\n\nThere is one more branch of moral realism to talk about. This one is called virtue ethics. Instead of looking at good and bad as something impersonal that we need to recognize via reason or a moral sense, virtue theory sees good and bad as a quality of the person him or herself. It is a virtuous person that creates good acts, not good acts that add up to a virtuous person! This is also often called perfectionism.\n\nIt is found in a variety of interesting places: Aristotle proposed a virtue ethics in his famous Nicomachean Ethics; Buddha outlined a virtue ethics in his sutras; Plato has a virtue ethics, as do the stoics; and Friederic Nietzsche promotes a virtue ethics in Thus Spake Zarathustra, the book introduced \"Superman\" to the world! The idea is simple: Follow certain practices and you will become a virtuous man or woman. Then do what you will, and the results will be good.\n\nI like virtue ethics a lot, but I have to admit there’s a danger in it. Who decides what constitutes a virtuous person? The Nazis read Nietzsche and decided that they were the master race and could do no wrong. Nevermind that Nietzsche would never recognize his Superman in boot-stomping blackshirts -- Nietzsche was dead by then! Even the gentle Buddhists have had to face the problem: If a certified enlightened master decides it might be a good idea to sleep with his students or take all their money, does that make these things moral? To respond by saying we were mistaken about his enlightenment is too easy a way out of the dilemma!\n\nAnother version of virtue ethics, called situational ethics, was developed recently by a Christian theologian named Joseph Fletcher. Uncomfortable with the “follow these rules or burn in hell” theology of some Christians, he said that Jesus had a quite different idea of morality (one quite like Buddha, actually). If you cultivate a loving attitude, you will naturally begin to do more good and less bad. In fact, whatever is done with love is by definition a good act. You could point out that some people do pretty awful things in the name of love, but we could consider these mistaken examples of love. But you could also argue that this is an example of the \"No True Scotsman\" fallacy: If something good comes out of love, fine; If something bad comes out of love, then, well, that wasn't real love!\n\nAnother aspect of his theory is that morality is always situational. He means that morality is always a matter of a real person in a real situation, and we can’t really judge them from outside that situation. Hypothetical moral situations, he says, are never real. There are always more details to be taken into account! This sounded way too much like moral relativism to conservative Christians, and so today many people misunderstand poor Fletcher and assume he was some kind of nasty nihilist!\n\n© Copyright 1999, C.
