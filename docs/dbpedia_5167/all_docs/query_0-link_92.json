        "text": "The Intellectual Background\n\nGestalt psychology developed in Germany in an intellectual landscape dominated by Wilhelm Wundt’s structuralism. Structuralism was a highly analytical and reductionist discipline (Brennan, J. F. , 2013). Wundt asserted that all experiences can and should be broken down into images. This rigidity was a point of disagreement between Wundt and his students. It was these students, in fact, that laid the foundations of Gestalt psychology. Kulpe and Titchener were 2 of his most prominent students and through their individual experiments, generated conflicting ideas on experiences that could not be broken down into images, or “imageless thought”. Kulpe believed that it was entirely possible, whereas Titchener thought that Kulpe’s findings were due to improper training of participants. This conflict catalysed the formation of a different tradition of thought, at Wurzburg university, led by Kulpe.\n\nPictured: Wilhelm Wundt faces criticisms from the Wurzburg school, Circa 1896.\n\nAt Wurzburg, the concept of thought with non-sensory origin, and determining tendencies leading to patterns of perceptions were cultivated. Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf were associated with this university and developed the theory of act psychology, which focused on the functions of the mind rather than its structure. Their major contribution to Gestalt psychology was the belief that experiences should be studied through their description rather than by trying to understand their origins in the mind. This lead to phenomenology, or the study of experiences without concern for causality, which would influence the way Gestalt psychology studied behaviour.\n\nAlthough the thought at Wurzburg existed in opposition to structuralism, it had not consolidated itself into a defined school capable of challenging Wundt’s ideas. However, three exemplary German psychologists that studied in this university were to do so with their combined efforts.\n\nThe Birth of Gestalt Psychology\n\nPictured: Gestalt psychology is given form out of the efforts of 3 prominent psychologists, circa 1923. (colourised)\n\nThe essential principles of Gestalt Psychology developed sequentially through deliberations and follow ups. The starting of Gestalt psychology is credited to Max Wertheimer discovering the ‘Phi phenomenon’ and writing about it in the ‘Experimental Studies of Perception’ in 1912. This was the beginning of contention against the idea of breaking stimuli down into units, as the apparent motion exhibited in Phi phenomenon is due to the relationship developed between different stimuli working together.\n\nInitially, Kohler (1920) induced from examples in nature that all physical systems will eventually develop to reach a state of equilibrium that requires minimum energy. This phenomenon was named ‘Physical Gestalten’ and came up in 1920. In addition, he elaborated on ‘Strong Gestalten’, the feature of mutually interdependent elements in a system. In this understanding, such elements of a system cannot be studied independently since the change in state of even one element would modify the being of all the others. Hence, instead of following a method of reducing the system to units or particles, we have to observe it as ‘field continua’ or en masse.\n\nBuilding on this concept,Wertheimer published a writing in the ‘Psychologische Forschung’ (a scientific journal) in 1922 that drew on how humans do not perceive the world as a mere group of unconnected objects. As a follow up to the same, he gave the ‘Law of Pragnanz’ in 1923, introducing the understanding to Gestalt Psychology that objects and the field in which they exist share relationships resulting in it to be organized in the simplest manner possible. Hence, as more people started to explore the more specific ways in which these relationships were developed, the Gestalt Laws of Organization came into being. (Wagemans, Elder, Kubovy, Palmer, & Peterson, 2012)\n\nWith the strong establishment of Gestalt Psychology now in place, the school of Gestalt enjoyed advancements by many contributors. In the universities of Berlin, Karl Duncker showed the illusion of induced motion, how a moving background causes change in the direction of the motion of an object. Furthermore, Gestalt school addressed sense modalities, neuropathology, etc.\n\nA skeletal overview of the timeline of Gestalt psychology is available through the following link:\n\nhttp://prezi.com/u9b0dihvq8nh/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy\n\nThe Impact of Gestalt psychology\n\nPictured: Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Kohler flee Nazi Germany, circa 1933 (colourised).\n\nAmerica is where Gestalt psychology survived during wartime. All 3 primary Gestalt psychologists fled to the United states to avoid the persecution and intellectual sterility Nazism had brought with it. Here they wrote several works that consolidated Gestalt psychology into a concrete theory. The most influential writer out of the 3 was Kohler. In his 1929 work, “Gestalt psychology” he detailed the principles of gestalt psychology that the movement had discovered and criticised existing systems like behaviorism and introspectionism. However the book and Gestalt psychology was criticised by eminent thinkers of the time as it failed to substantiate itself with a strong physiological basis, used vague terms in its descriptions of behaviour, and improperly represented other schools that it chose to criticise (Boring, 1930). Following the experiments and criticisms by Sperry, Miner, & Myers (1955) Electrical field theory became redundant and Gestalt psychology also declined with it.\n\nIn essence, Gestalt psychology had been an effective step forward from descriptive phenomenology which in itself was an answer to reductionist theories such as Structuralism in Europe, and gave a whole different perspective that even influenced future psychologists such as Tolman in other fields such as behaviourism, and today find some relevance in specific aspects such as user-interface design in technology (Soegaard, 2012).\n\nThe Theory of Gestalt Psychology\n\nSensation and Perception\n\nIt should be understood that mere sensation of a stimulus and its perception differ from one another. The experience of a stimulus in its raw, unfiltered state is sensation. The integration of stimulus from environment with what is already known or attribution of meaning based on past experiences etc. is perception. It is thus subjective in nature.\n\nPerceptual Field\n\nIt can be defined as “the entirety of the surroundings which someone understands at a specific time- that being, all of the factors of the surroundings of which the person is conscious at a chosen time.” (N., & M.S., P. (2015, June 23). It can simply be referred to as the psychological factors that influence how you experience and perceive the various stimuli present in the environment.\n\nFigure-Ground Relationship\n\nAccording to Gestalt psychology, the central principle is ‘the whole is greater than sum of parts’ and importance is given to the context in which the stimuli are interpreted. Focus is often on how the environment is ‘viewed’ and its components perceived.\n\nFigure and ground. Organisation of the different elements present as part of the perceptual set is done naturally and without conscious efforts. It should be noted that this organisation is not an acquired skill i.e. it is neither learned nor developed and is innate or inborn. Multiple stimuli are organised into ‘figure’ and ‘ground’. The part containing components of interest are organised as ‘figure’ and the rest or background is organised as ‘ground’.\n\nRubin’s vase. It was developed around 1915 by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin. One element of Rubin’s research was: “When two fields have a common border, and one is seen as figure and the other as ground, the immediate perceptual experience is characterized by a shaping effect which emerges from the common border of the fields and which operates only on one field or operates more strongly on one than on the other”.\n\nIn the given image, perception might alternate between that of two black faces on the edges or a single white vase in the centre. When the perception is that of a vase, it is actually the ‘figure’ and the blackened regions are merely the background or the ‘ground’. The vice-versa is also true i.e. when perception is that of two faces, they are acting as part of the ‘figure’ and the white region in between is part of ‘ground’.\n\nArtistic Applications.\n\nnegative space. In arts, it is referred to as the space other than the apparent subject, which is shaped in such a way that it turns out to be the central subject in the image.\n\nIn figure-ground reversal, the central subject, say the text, is left blank on a black background.The negative space here surrounds the central subject. This helps in efficient communication.\n\nwhite space. In visual arts, the blank or empty regions on a paper constitute ‘white space’. The balanced presence of white space is important so as to highlight and attract attention of reader or observer to the important text or information thus provided. A page with well-spaced content and white space is much more appreciated and paid attention to than a page crammed with different kinds of important but overwhelming information chunks.\n\nPrinciples of Perception\n\nPrinciple of similarity. As per this principle, objects or items similar to one another in form are perceived to be or are grouped together.\n\nIn the given image, one perceives columns of squares and circles rather than rows of alternating squares and circles.\n\nDue to the similarity that squares have to one another in their form or shape, they’re grouped together and perceived to be different rows.\n\nPrinciple of pragnanz. According to the principle of pragnanz, reality is reduced to the simplest possible form.\n\nIn the given figure, five separate and overlapping circles are perceived instead of a combination of semi-circles, arcs, curved lines etc. A complex set of lines is being reduced or organised as a simple set of five circles.\n\nPrinciple of proximity. As per this principle, objects present closer to one another or having proximity are perceived to be or grouped together.\n\nThe first two columns of circles are grouped together due to their close proximity. However, one does not perceive the second and the third column to be together since they’re farther in comparison.\n\nPrinciple of continuity. As per this principle, the smoothest path in an image is perceived to have ‘continuity’ or to be in continuation.\n\nIn the given image, the continuity is perceived to be in the light blue dots and not along the path of the darker ones. This perception is due to the fact that the path of lighter dots is ‘smoother’ or in continuation.\n\nWhen you draw a line over the two diverging paths, you will be able to observe that the angle of divergence of the lighter blue circles is lesser than what is formed by the darker ones. Thus, the lighter circles are grouped together or seen in continuation.\n\nPrinciple of closure. As per the principle, we tend to perceive objects as closed or in a ‘closure’. Empty spaces and gaps are filled in automatically so that simpler shapes might be seen.\n\nIn given figure, the empty space in between the incomplete circles is perceived as a triangle that is enclosed by shaded regions at three angles.\n\nThe mind fills in the missing gap by perceiving it as a triangle so that a ‘whole’ or complete figure might be seen.\n\nObject Constancy\n\nIt is the phenomenon wherein humans and animals tend to keep the appearance of objects as constant in their mind irrespective of differing visual cues.\n\nThis means that even though a door slightly ajar and might seem as a shape other than a regular rectangle, you know and perceive it as a rectangle only since you know that no matter what visual cues you receive, a door will always be a rectangular piece of wood.\n\nTransposition Principle\n\nOut of the basic principles in Gestalt, therein lies the principle of transposition. Breaking the word into parts, it is basically “trans” and “position”, which means the transfer of position. It is an aspect of learning which, in simple words, says that as we gain experiences, we also tend to shift and apply them to other situations so as to cope with them, instead of learning new experiences for every situation. That is to say, it is the generalization of concepts or insights that we gain from our environmental stimuli and employ them into other similar stimuli responses as a whole in whichever way applicable. (Reber & Reber, 1985) It particularly focuses on the feature of stimulus change, and on the relationship of stimulus instead of each stimulus as individual aspects.\n\nIn fact, the act of transposition is the main objective of learning between a teacher and a student, since a person who teaches another person always wishes the latter to be able to apply his knowledge on other cases as well. (Baroja, 2014) Suppose, we are taught a particular problem in mathematics, we tend to absorb the technique and methodology to solve that particular ‘type’ of problem, instead of learning that problem specifically. Thus, when we sit to solve the next sum, we use the knowledge and experience from our solving the previous one and use that to solve the present one. Again, when two successive notes of music in a consecutive, we do not perceive the two notes in a distinct manner, but we relate the two to form a melody, precisely the reason behind having a transpose mode in musical instruments. All this happens due to the element of transposition, In modern days, numerous studies have been conducted based on the principle of transposition, to study comparative psychology between humans and other animal species, and also among humans.\n\nPrinciple of Isomorphism\n\nPictured: Ivan Pavlov criticises Gestalt psychology for being too mentalistic, (colourised)\n\nAccording to James F. Brennan, “perhaps the weakest, and certainly most elusive, part of Gestalt theory concerns the explanation of underlying brain activity mediating perceptual processes, which Gestaltists called isomorphism”. The word ‘isomorphism’ comes from the joining of two Greek words, “iso” (meaning, similar) and “morphos” (meaning, form). It basically conveys the idea that our perceptual processes and physiological levels run parallel to each other. In simpler terms, it is to say that our perception of any stimulus and the related physiological changes in the brain that follows are similar.\n\nWhen we receive a stimulus, it is taken from our sense organs to our brains in the form of neural signals, and the electrical impulses in our brain help us to perceive it. On receiving a stimulus of a sequential pattern of flashing lights, our brain perceives that as an illusion of motion, because for the brain, this stimulus creates a similar perception as to what a moving array of lights would create. This technique is used for lighting and decoration, where a series of lights go on and off, and is also experienced when a train with lighted windows passes by on a pitch dark night. Both of these kind of phenomena elicit a similar perception in our mind.\n\nThe meaning of this principle is basically to assert that the perception we form and the bodily functions that precede in the brain (here, the neural and electrical impulses), are similar in form. Thus, it draws a similarity with our mind and body, stating that the properties of the mind and consciousness is a direct consequence of the electrochemical interactions within our brain. It tries to link our mind and body, catering to the aspect of mind-body dualism that had previously prevailed in the history of the discipline.\n\nApplications of Gestalt Psychology\n\nProductive thinking: Max Wertheimer\n\nGestalt psychologists have applied the concepts of perception to mental aspects such as problem solving and creative thinking, and have emphasized the role of insight in productive thinking (Kirsch, 2009) .Max Wertheimer, one of the founders of the Gestalt movement, wrote a book called ‘Productive Thinking’ in which he scrutinized human problem solving, as he believed that creativity requires the restructuring of the given problem so that it is perceived in an entirely different light (Simonton, 2001) .Wertheimer introduced his book with some simple but profound questions: “What occurs when, now and then, thinking really works productively? What happens when, now and then, thinking forges ahead?” (Wertheimer, 1996) He termed productive thinking as “the transition from a blind attitude to understanding in a productive process,” At the core of the process is a kind of reorganization or restructuring, going from a state that makes no sense to one that does make sense (Wertheimer, 1996). In order to demonstrate the importance of productive thinking based teaching methods, he gave the example of a teacher who teaches students to calculate the area of a parallelogram. The teacher draws a parallelogram, drops a perpendicular line to denote height, and then gives a formula containing height and base parameters. The students solve the problems using the given formula and ace the test on parallelograms, leading to the impression that the teacher is adept at teaching. Wertheimer, however, criticized the teaching for its lack of emphasis on thinking. As a test, Wertheimer introduced an unusually shaped parallelogram, and the students responded by saying ‘We haven’t had this yet.’ This proved that rote learning did not promote intellectual thinking in any manner. In contrast to teaching for rote learning, Wertheimer suggested that, in this case, students should be encouraged to discover that the triangle on one of the parallelograms could be cut off and placed on the other end to form a rectangle. According to Wertheimer, rote teaching methods lead to reproductive thinking—being able to repeat what was taught—whereas meaningful teaching methods can lead to productive thinking—being able to use what was taught in new situations (Mayer, 2001).\n\nField Theory\n\nAn important application of the Gestalt movement would be the development of the Field theory. Proposed by the German psychologist, Kurt Lewin, field theory aims to focus on a topological method of understanding behaviour and examine patterns of interactions between individuals and their field/ environment. In fact, field theory states that behaviour is a function of the person and his environment: B= f (P, E) (Neill, 2004). Lewin taught that the dynamics of an individual’s hodological space are governed by motivational constructs (needs, desires or internalised goals). A positive motivational construct (positive ‘vector’) refers to an attractive object a negative motivational construct (negative ‘vector’) refers to a repulsive object. The values of attraction and repulsion attached to these motivational constructs are called valances. Two opposing vectors define a conflict and any obstacle that comes in the way of achieving a goal is termed a barrier (Brennan, 2013). The explanation that field theory brings is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage unlike conventional sociological definitions. (Martin, 2003)\n\nApplications in Everyday Life\n\nIn addition to this, Gestalt concepts have been applied or extended to the study of disciplines including perception, cognitive sciences, problem solving, creativity, psychology in art, communication studies, education, musicology, linguistics, social psychology and psychotherapy (Kirsch, 2009) Gestalt psychology finds most prevalence in the field of education as they help students progress academically and personally. As discussed, Wertheimer’s book on productive thinking discusses classroom teaching methods as an effective way of developing productive thinking in students. Professionals in the field of communication studies also use the contributions of Gestalt psychology. Artists, designers or publicists seek to attract the attention of their audience. Knowing how we interpret images is essential for them to be able to create works that allow them to transmit their messages and establish an effective dialogue with their audience. With respect to therapy, Gestalt psychology presents the idea that each person presents his/her own ideas, thoughts and desires and have his/her own truths. Fritz Perls who developed Gestalt theory therapy emphasised that perception is the key to reality and we are responsible for changing it. (Salazar, 2017)\n\nInsight Learning\n\nPictured: Kohler’s monkey demonstrates insight learning to the world, circa 1917 (colourised).\n\nGerman Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler theorised the Insight Learning approach which was one of the first theories of cognitive learning. Insight learning can be better understood by focusing first on the word ‘insight’.The Merriam Webster dictionary defines insight as “the power or act of seeing into a situation” or as “the act or result of apprehending the inner nature of things or of seeing intuitively”.\n\nThus, insightful learning can be explained as the swift comprehension gained after understanding the relationships between various aspects of a problem to aid in finding a solution. Insight learning is a cognitive approach only present in higher order beings, most notably, apes and humans. It draws on the ability to understand various aspects of the problem through perceiving the interactions with the environment and external stimuli; and it usually happens without previous attempts or trial and error. Köhler believed that after deliberation, the understanding of the problem is sudden and complete; the solution occurs in a flash of understanding.\n\nKöhler devised this theory after extensive experimentation on chimpanzees, namely on ‘Sultan’, his most intelligent subject. He conducted three experiments. In the first experiment, he placed Sultan in a cage. When the chimpanzee grew hungry, he positioned a bunch of bananas outside the cage and presented Sultan with a long wooden stick and a shorter one. Neither stick was long enough, but on joining them, he was able to reach the bananas. When the experiment was repeated the next day, Sultan wasted no time in joining the two sticks to retrieve the bananas.\n\nIn another experiment he fixed the bananas on a ceiling, high over Sultan’s head in a room with walls he would not be able to climb. After several failed attempts to reach the bananas, he then began to play with a carton box which was kept in the room. After playing with the box for several minutes, he abruptly pushed it below the bananas and retrieved them by climbing onto the box. The third experiment replicated the second, using two or three boxes instead of one to further complicate the experiment. Once again, Sultan was able to think of a way to reach the bananas.\n\nThese are the steps used in Insight Learning:\n\nThrough these experiments with Sultan, Köhler was able to demonstrate how insight learning takes place.\n\nThe problem is identified.\n\nThe problem is observed and analyses the different components, perceiving the relation between the goal and the hurdle.\n\nThe probable solutions are explored keeping in mind prior knowledge and similar situations previously encountered.\n\nSustained attention is paid; motivation plays a key factor in this stage as well in helping find the solution.\n\nThere is a shift in the perception regarding the problem and fresh insight is gained which will help in the required action taking place.\n\nThe solution is implemented in other similar situations.\n\nTolman’s Theory of Latent Learning\n\nAlthough Edward C. Tolman was a Behaviourist, he was interested in the Gestalt field of thought and he conducted important experiments on latent learning. Through these experiments, he was able to show effectively that learned responses need not necessarily be gained through observation. Latent Learning refers to the kind of learning that is visible only when the person has cause or incentive to display it; there is no reinforcement or motivation required for the learning to take place. Learning which is not apparent in the learner’s behaviour at the time of learning, but which manifests later when a suitable motivation and circumstances appear (Tolman 1930).\n\nTo prove this theory, Tolman, along with another psychologist Honzik, experimented on three groups of rats placed in a maze they had built. One at a time, the groups were put in the maze. The first group was rewarded each time they navigated the maze, the second group was given delayed rewards and the third group was not given any reward.\n\nThe behaviour of the second group was focused on the most as they displayed latent learning. On placing food at the exit of the maze, the rats were being offered a reward. Their usual route was blocked, but using their cognitive map(mental image or representation of external stimuli), they effectively reached their reward using the shortest route. This displayed that in the course of the previous trials, they had learned how to navigate the maze and on being offered a reward, used their learning of the maze to reach it.\n\nReferences\n\nAnimal Learning- Insight and Reasoning.
