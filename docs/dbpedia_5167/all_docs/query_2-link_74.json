        "text": "gestalt psychology\n\nInfographic\n\nMain Idea\n\nGestalt Psychology is about our minds perceiving objects in a more complex system. Gestalt theory believes that our brains doesn't need all the detial to understand or identify objects. Our brains perceive things by seeing the whole and not by paying attention to all the details.\n\nWho or what influenced the theory?\n\nWhen was it proposed?\n\nWho proposed the theory?\n\nApplied to the Study of People\n\nThis type of psychology is used in therapy to help people focus on their past or present. It is proven to be very useful to help people work through thier minds. Gestalt psychology helps treating people with a wide range of issues.\n\n3 German Psychologists named Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang KÃ¶hler.\n\nIt was proposed in 1912 when Max Wertheimer published a paper on gestalt psychology.\n\nWertheimer was once observing the phi phenomenon, which is an optical illusion of seeing things quickly appearing and disappearing. This makes us think that the object was moving when it was not. Wertheimer realized that our minds recognize things by whole and not by individual parts.\n\nTheory Today\n\nGestals theory is used today in understanding our brain and it's behavior. It still influences the way we comprehend our vision and the context we need in order to process our brain.\n\nVisit the Analytics settings;\n\nActivate user tracking;\n\nLet the communication flow!\n\nUse this space to add awesome interactivity.
