        "text": "Koffka, Kurt (1886-1941) was a German psychologist and philosopher who played an important role in the emergence of Gestalt psychology. His most important contributions to the field include his theories of perception, the Gestalt laws of organization, and the principle of Prägnanz.\n\nKoffka was born in Berlin, Germany in 1886. He studied chemistry and philosophy at the University of Berlin before earning his Ph.D. in psychology in 1910. He was an instructor at the University of Berlin from 1911-1916, and then went to work for the Psychological Institute at the University of Würzburg, where he became professor of psychology in 1921.\n\nKoffka is best known for his work on Gestalt psychology, which he founded with Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Köhler. Gestalt psychology is a school of thought that focuses on the study of perception and learning, seeking to understand the structure of experience and how it is shaped by the environment. Koffka was particularly interested in the laws of perception, such as the law of closure, the law of similarity, the law of proximity, and the law of good continuation. Koffka also put forth the principle of Prägnanz (or “good figure”), which states that the perceptual system will tend to organize perception in a way that produces the simplest and most unified image possible.\n\nKoffka’s work was highly influential, and he was a strong advocate of interdisciplinary research. He published numerous books and articles throughout his career, including his 1925 book, Principles of Gestalt Psychology. He died in 1941 in Würzburg, Germany.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGestalt Psychology: An Introduction to New Concepts in Modern Psychology. (1935). Kurt Koffka.\n\nKoffka, K. (1925).
