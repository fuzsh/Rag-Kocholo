        "text": "Wertheimer’s decision to use the word gestalt on his own terms was bold; many others in his time were using it in a quasi-mystical, politically conservative and/or antisemitic way. He, on the other hand, used it to describe “his socially liberal, Jewish-dominated, and empirically oriented research program in Berlin” (Harrington). This bold movement of Wertheimer’s, this direction he took gestalt, became the roots of gestalt theory as we know it today in psychology. I have a video on this topic here.\n\nMuch of this blog post will paraphrase information from chapter four of Anne Harrington’s excellent book, “Reenchanted Science.”\n\n“Founded by Max Wertheimer before the First World War and then further advanced in collaboration with Wolfgang Kohler, Kurt Koffka, and others through the Weimar years, Gestalt theory argued for the possibility of retaining a place for human significance in nature but without sacrificing rigorous experimental standards of traditional natural science.” -Anne Harrington\n\nThe “gestalt” concept allowed thinkers to see the world as a plurality of connected wholes, rather than atomistic reductionism, vitalism, or viewing the world as one undifferentiated whole. This important concept had many implications. The concept of gestalt, as an observed quality of logic and orderliness, meant there was still hope that immanent structure and meaning could still really exist in this world, even in the wake of rapidly developing scientific understanding of the world in evolution and physics at the time and continuing to the present. Wertheimer’s life was spent defending the existence of truth, democracy, and meaning even in the midst of a rapidly changing, turbulent state of the world. Wertheimer was convinced that there was immanent logic and meaning that could be found in one’s concrete, lived situation. The perception of a “gestalt” was not only the basis of his scientific research, but also the basis of his philosophy which he professed to the end of his life.\n\nWertheimer’s Early Life\n\nMax Wertheimer was born in Prague on April 15, 1880. He was raised in a Jewish family that was religiously conservative and intellectual. His grandfather secretly introduced Wertheimer to Spinoza, who his father had forbidden him to read. Spinoza gave Wertheimer “resources to conceive of the problem of order (Gestalt) and mind in a nondualistic way” (Harrington, 112). Wertheimer deeply loved music, especially piano.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1901, Wertheimer attended the University of Prague. Though he first enrolled as a law student, “from the beginning he studied psychology, music, philosophy, and the history of art.” By 1900, he switched to the philosophy department, under Ehrenfels. He resonated with Ehrenfels’ concerns with Gestalt and ordering principles in perception, but “also with his love of music and ‘allegiance of the primacy of aesthetic over techonological values in science and philosophy’” (Harrington). Other mentors were important for Wertheimer: “psychologist-philosophers like Oswald Kulpe and Karl Marbe in Marburg (with whom he formally completed his doctorate) and especially Carl Stumpf in Berlin” (Harrington).\n\n“Gestalt theory aimed to give back to people the integrity of their consciousness. In doing so, this epistemology also affirmed what Goethe, in his way, had long known: that the basis of lived reality was not meaningless particles but rather ‘immanent structuralism,’ order, and wholeness.” Harrington, 117\n\nIn 1903, Wertheimer received his PhD from the University of Würzburg. He then began his academic career at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt, which later became the University of Frankfurt. From 1910 to 1916 he worked there and conducted pioneering experiments in the perception of motion and phi phenomenon. Wertheimer first founded his Gestalt theory before World War I, publishing his research on perception in \"Experimental Studies on Motion Vision\" in 1912.\n\nWorld War I\n\nWertheimer served in World War I as a research psychologist with the Prussian Artillery Testing Commission, which was located in the Bavarian Quarter of Berlin, not far from Albert Einstein’s house. Their friendship began at this time, “nurtured by lengthy visits in which he attempted to understand the Gestalt-like psychological processes employed by Einstein to conceive the theory of relativity” (Harrington, 113). They would remain friends until Wertheimer’s death. During the war years Wertheimer also developed a friendship with physicist Max Born, who was also friends with Einstein.\n\nYears in Germany After World War I\n\nMax Wertheimer lived in Berlin from 1916 to 1929 working at the Berlin Psychological Institute. He gave lectures and pursued his research on perception and gestalt in the University of Berlin. In 1923, he married Anna Caro, with whom he had four children. In 1924 he gave his talk on Gestalt Theory to Berlin’s Kant Society. I also have a video about that speech here. He returned to Frankfurt in 1929 where he worked as a professor until he left Germany in 1933.\n\nYears in America (1933-1943)\n\nIn 1933, the changes in Germany's government prompted Wertheimer to leave; he felt his Jewish roots put him in danger. The Wertheimers' emigration to the United States was arranged and he and his wife and their children arrived in New York on September 13, 1933. The family became US citizens. Wertheimer accepted a professorship at the New School for Social Research in New York City. He remained there for the last decade of his life.\n\nFrom 1934-1940, Wertheimer wrote four major papers, philosophical essays on the topics of truth, ethics, democracy, and freedom which are all commonly grounded on gestalt ideas of the whole and its parts, and the importance of looking at the \"total situation.\" I highly recommend checking out these works of his: “On Truth,” “Some Problems in the Theory of Ethics,” “On the Concept of Democracy,” and “A Story of Three Days.” I have a video here exploring his essay On Truth.\n\nIn America he remained in touch with his European colleagues, many of whom had also emigrated to America. Koffka was at Smith College; Köhler at Swarthmore, and Lewin at Cornell University and the University of Iowa. In declining health, Wertheimer continued to work on his research on \"productive thinking.\" Max and Anna Wertheimer divorced in 1942. He completed his only book, Productive Thinking in September 1943. He died from a heart attack just three weeks after the book's completion in New Rochelle, New York, where his body is interred. He was the father of Michael Wertheimer, also a psychologist. Michael co-wrote his father’s biography, published in 2007.\n\nQuotes"
