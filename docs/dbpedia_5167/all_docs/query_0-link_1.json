        "text": "Kurt Koffka (born March 18, 1886, Berlin, Germany—died November 22, 1941, Northampton, Massachusetts, U.S.) was a German psychologist and cofounder, with Wolfgang Köhler and Max Wertheimer, of the Gestalt school of psychology.\n\nKoffka studied psychology with Carl Stumpf at the University of Berlin and received his Ph.D. degree in 1909. Koffka was associated with the University of Giessen (1911–24) and served as a subject (1912), along with Köhler, in experiments on perception conducted by Wertheimer. Their findings led Koffka, Wertheimer, and Köhler to stress the holistic approach that psychological phenomena cannot be interpreted as combinations of elements: parts derive their meaning from the whole, and people perceive complex entities rather than their elements.\n\nKoffka conducted much experimental work, but he is perhaps best known for his systematic application of Gestalt principles to a wide range of questions. One of his major works, Die Grundlagen der psychischen Entwicklung (1921; The Growth of the Mind), applied the Gestalt viewpoint to child psychology and argued that infants initially experience organized wholes in the barely differentiated world about them."
