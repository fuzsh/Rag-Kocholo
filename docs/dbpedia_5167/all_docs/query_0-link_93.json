        "text": "UNIT III\n\nGestalt psychology This German school of psychology was established in the year 1912 by Max Wertheimer (1880- 1941) and subsequently expanded by his colleagues Kurt Koffka (1886-1941) and Wolfgang Kohler (1887- 1967). The important developers of this school were Kurt Lewin, R. Wheeler, E. Brunswik and Roger Barker. Like other systems, the Gestalt psychology had strong antecedent forces that were instrumental in its emergence. The viewpoints of Immanuel Kant who said that ‘perception can’t be analyzed into divisible parts”. This notion became the heart of Gestalt psychology. Similarly John Stuart Mill recognized that ‘two or more elements of consciousness might form a state, which is different from the mere sum of component elements’. This view also had a direct impact upon Gestalt psychologists. Similarly the viewpoints of Franz Brintano, Carl Stumpf and Ernst Mach were instrumental in laying the foundation of Gestalt psychology. Apart from all these persons, laboratory experiments on ‘Perception’ done at Gottingen University were also very important antecedent forces for its birth. The Founding of Gestalt psychology The term Gestalt means ‘Form’ or ‘Configuration’. The Gestalt psychologists said the mind is not made up of elements and hence it can be understood better only if we study it as a ‘whole’. This school gave primary emphasis upon the study of ‘Wholes’. The main principle of Gestalt school is “whole is better than sum total of its parts”. According to it, the individual perceives a thing as a whole and not as a mere collection of elements. In the same way sensation or perception will be experienced as a whole. For example, when we look at a wooden table, we do not look it as a bundle of different pieces, but as a whole, only then we perceive it as a meaningful object. As a result, human behavior is characterized as an intelligent behavior, rather than a simple stimulus-response mechanism. In this way Gestalt psychology strongly opposed the points of view of other schools. This approach was called the molar approach that contrasted the molecular approach which was adopted by schools of Structuralism and Behaviorism. Gestalt psychology seeks to understand how the human brain perceives experiences. It suggests that structures, perceived as a whole, have specific properties that are different from the sum of their individual parts. For instance, when reading a text, a person perceives each word and sentence as a whole with meaning, rather than seeing individual letters; and while each letterform is an independent individual unit, the greater meaning of the text depends on the arrangement of the letters into a specific configuration.\n\nGestalt grew from the field of psychology in the beginning of the 19th Century. Austrian and German psychologists started researching the human mind’s tendency to try to make sense of the world around us through automatic grouping and association. The Gestalt Principles, or Laws of Perception, explain how this behavior of “pattern seeking” operates. They offer a powerful framework to understand human perception, and yet are simple to assimilate and implement. For that reason, the Gestalt Laws are appealing not only to psychologists but also to visual artists, educators and communicators. There are several uses for Gestalt psychology today, some of which include those related to therapy, design, product development, and learning. Principles of Gestalt psychology Gestalt psychology helped introduce the idea that human perception is not just about seeing what is actually present in the world around us. It is also heavily influenced by our motivations and expectations. The principles are grounded on the human natural tendency of finding order in disorder - a process that happens in the brain, not in the sensory organs such as the eye. According to Wertheimer, the mind “makes sense” of stimulus captured by the eyes following a predictable set of principles. The brain applies these principles in a way that enables individuals to perceive uniform forms rather than simply collections of unconnected images. Although these principles operate in a predictable way, they are actually mental shortcuts to interpret information. They theorized that, because of those “mental shortcuts”, the perception of the whole is different from the sum of individual elements. This idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts - the central tenet of Gestalt psychology. Some of the most important principles of Gestalt theory are: Gestalt’s principles, or Laws of Perception, were formalized by Wertheimer in a treaty published in 1923, and further elaborated by Köhler, Koffka and Metzger. Part-whole psychology: there is a distinction between ‘whole’ and ‘its parts’. ’wholes’ have characteristics that are different from the characteristics of its parts. Principles of organization: Gestalt psychologists tried to deemphasize the role of learning in perception. They said that certain laws or principles govern the organization of perceptual wholes. These laws are natural and innate rather than learned. These laws are as under:  Prägnanz: This foundational principle states that we naturally perceive things in their simplest and best forms or organization.  Similarity: This Gestalt principle suggests that we naturally group similar items together based on elements like color, size, and orientation. An example would be grouping dogs based on whether they are small or large, or if they are big or small.  Proximity: The principle of proximity states that objects near each other tend to be viewed as a group.  Continuity: According to this Gestalt principle, we perceive elements arranged on a line or curve as related to each other, while elements that are not on the line or curve are seen as separate.\n\nillusion of apparent movement came to be known as phi-phenomenon. He said that movement took place in the brain. PHI PHENOMENON The phi phenomenon definition is a psychological term that has been described as an optical illusion that causes one to see several still images in a series as moving. Anytime one watches a cartoon, they are observing this phenomenon. One may see a cartoon character moving across the screen; however, in actuality, the character is not moving at all. Instead, a series of images are presented one after the other that trick the eye into thinking that the character is moving from one point to another. This phenomenon is an optical illusion because the human brain perceives something different than reality. Max Wertheimer tested this theory in his laboratory by showing participants an image with a projector. He would show a straight line on one side of a projected image and then quickly show another image of the line on the right side. He would switch between these two images rapidly. Afterward, people reported not seeing two separate images but that they had witnessed a line moving back and forth across the screen. Wertheimer started theorizing as to why this phenomenon occurred. He believed that the human brain naturally wants to observe patterns. Wertheimer suggested that the brain was simply trying to fill in the space between the two images by believing that the line was moving. He called this illusion of movement the Phi phenomenon, which is the same principle upon which motion pictures are based. He continued to run tests and study the phi phenomenon. The phi phenomenon is the optical illusion of perceiving a series of still images and it is a concept of isomorphism, when viewed in rapid succession, as continuous motion. Another common example is given in terms of music. While a song may be made up of individual notes, it is their combination that we perceive as the melody. This largely differed from the principles regarding structuralism, a popular subject at the time, which believed that the conscious experience could be broken down into basic conscious elements. The work towards Gestalt psychology was largely founded on Carl Stumpf and Clerk Maxwell’s work in physics. Köhler found that many phenomenon in physics supported the ideas of Gestalt psychology and seemed to “justify” their work (Köhler, 1959). Wertheimer&#039;s work and observations contributed to the Gestalt approach as well as to other areas such as experimental psychology and the study of sensation and perception. After working as a professor at the University of Frankfurt for several years, he immigrated to the United States in 1933. He then began teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York City and continued to work there over the next decade. On October 12, 1943, Wertheimer suffered a fatal coronary embolism at his home in New York. Wolfgang Kohler\n\nKohler was born in Estonia in 1887. His work was largely on the connections between physics and psychology. He was interested in acoustics and his Ph. D Thesis was on psychoacoustics (the study of sound perception). After completing his Ph. D, he went to Frankfurt. Kohler worked with Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka for 3 years (between 1910-13) and aided Wertheimer in his studies of apparent movement, which is now referred to as the phi phenomenon (the illusion of moving stills). Köhler is famous for ‘insight learning’. His studies suggested that through insight learning animals were able to grasp key learning concepts. In 1913, Kohler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife to study apes. Kohler concluded that these animals also perceived relations among stimuli. His book ‘The Mentality of Apes’, published in 1917, explains how apes went about solving problems. His work was the start of insight learning as well as using chimpanzees for experiments due to the similarities in the structure of their brains to human brains. He found that animals learnt by insight rather than by trial- and -error. Sudden perceptions of the correct relations among stimuli was called insight. Perception of such relationship was the indicator of intelligence of animals. Insight facilitated learning. Since this insight was sudden, learning was also sudden and not gradual. He concluded from the experiments that there was a correlation between intelligence and brain development. In 1920, Köhler returned to Germany and was appointed as the professor and director of the Psychological Institute at the University of Berlin. During his time in Germany, he set up a graduate program in psychology, created a psychology journal, re-wrote Gestalt psychology for an American audience. He also served as the president of the American Psychological Association. He died in 1967 in Enfield, New Hampshire. Note: (The experiment in detail, need not write it for the exam ) (Kohler’s most famous experiment was one in which he studied insight learning in Apes. This experiment took place within a large room containing bamboo poles and crates. He began by hanging a banana from a string to the ceiling and leaving the apes to figure out how to get it down. He noticed that the apes would jump and attempt to grab it and once they figured out they couldn’t get it that way, they would sit down for a while and ponder. After a while they would suddenly get up and attempt to grab it in a new way, by either using the crates or the bamboo pole. Some stacked boxes, and had to figure out how to stack them properly before jumping to grab it while others would use the bamboo pole to knock the banana down by throwing the pole at it.\n\nworks, (1921; The Growth of the Mind), applied the Gestalt viewpoint to child psychology and argued that infants at first cannot distinguish individual objects, but perceive everything holistically. As they grow older, infants learn to discriminate and respond to individual objects. Koffka claimed that the human mind naturally organizes individual sensations and experiences into meaningful wholes. Koffka believed that most of early learning is what he referred to as, “sensorimotor learning,” which is a type of learning which occurs after a consequence. For example, a child who touches a hot stove will learn not to touch it again. Koffka also believed that a lot of learning occurs by imitation, though he argued that it is not important to understand how imitation works, but rather to acknowledge that it is a natural occurrence. According to Koffka, the highest type of learning is ideational learning, which makes use of language. Koffka notes that an important time in children’s development is when they understand that objects have names. The importance of the Gestalt psychology that was started in Germany was soon recognized by Americans. therefore they were eager to get the summary of the new psychology from Germany. Consequently Koffka was persuaded to write an article on this new movement for Psychological Bulletin published from America. Accordingly he wrote an article “Perception: An Introduction to the Gestalt Theory” (1922) which incorporated the results of many experiments conducted by the Gestalt psychologists. In 1924 Koffka began a series of visits to several American universities, and in 1927 he was appointed professor of psychology at Smith College, where he remained for the rest of his life. His major work, Principles of Gestalt Psychology (1935), dealt with a wide range of applied psychology but contributed mainly to the study of perception, memory, and learning. Koffka’s interests were wide-ranging, and they included: perception, hearing impairments in brain-damaged patients, interpretation, learning, and the extension of Gestalt psychology to developmental psychology."
