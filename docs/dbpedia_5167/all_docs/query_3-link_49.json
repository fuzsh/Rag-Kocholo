The site features original biographies and oral history interviews. Dr. Alexandra Rutherford maintains the site.\n\nwww.apadivisions.org/division-35/index.aspx\n\nThe website for the Society for the Psychology of Women (Division 35 of the American Psychological Association) promotes feminist scholarship in the study of the psychology of women.\n\nPrint Resources: Historiography\n\nPsychology of Women Quarterly is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes material on the psychology of women and gender from a feminist perspective.

Origins and development of indigenous psychologies: An international analysis. International Journal of Psychology, 41(4), 243–268.\n\nOffers insights into factors that foster the emergence of local, or indigenous, psychologies using data from researchers from different areas of the world. The issues raised in this article (e.g., local versus mainstream psychology and future prospects for a universal psychology) are gaining importance among historians of psychology.\n\nBenjamin, L. T., Jr. (1980). Women in psychology: Biography and autobiography. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 5(1), 140–144.\n\nLists approximately one hundred sources of biographical and autobiographical material on eminent women in psychology.\n\nBohan, J. (1996).

V. (2004). Even the rat was white: A historical view of psychology (2nd ed.). New York: Pearson.\n\nEnlightening for audiences who are either familiar or unfamiliar with the field of history of psychology. The author offers evidence that racism has impacted the manner in which the history of psychology has traditionally been presented and argues that exposing this reality yields a history that is accurate and objective.\n\nHelson, H. (1972). What can we learn from the history of psychology? Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 8(1), 115–119.\n\nArticle published when the value of studying the history of psychology and the methods that had been used to study it became subject to scrutiny and criticism. Helson offers seven answers to the question he poses.\n\nHenle, M. (1976). Why study the history of psychology? Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 270, 14–20.\n\nHenle argues that the task of researching and recording a history is essential for minimizing the chance that we will repeat errors of the past. History is valuable because the nature of our cognitive processes is such that it is difficult for humans to see errors in their thinking.\n\nHolliday, B. G. (2009).

History of Psychology, 9(1), 17–37.\n\nAn article of interest to historians of science and psychology but also valuable to individuals learning the history of psychology.

History, origin myth and ideology: ‘Discovery’ of social psychology. Journal for the Theory of Social Behavior, 4(2), 217–232.\n\nThe content of this article may be better suited to historians, but it illustrates the importance of objectivity in writing a history as well as the value of skepticism in cases where a single history is routinely presented as the only version of events (i.e., fact).\n\nScarborough, E., & Furumoto, L. (1987). Untold lives: The first generation of American women psychologists. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.\n\nDescribes biographical material from several individuals to illustrate factors (e.g., family, marriage, and the nature of higher education in America in the early 1900s) that influenced the professional lives of women psychologists.\n\nStocking, G. W., Jr. (1965). On the limits of ‘presentism’ and ‘historicism’ in the historiography of the behavioral sciences. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 1(3), 211–218.\n\nThe content of this article (different approaches to history that a historian might choose when writing about his or subject matter) is important for anyone attempting to understand the task of writing a history. Stocking’s point: an approach that seeks to understand the past for its own sake makes it possible for an historian to see which of the significant facts (in the context of the past) can be said to be significant today (valuable in helping us understand the present).\n\nWettersten, J. R. (1975). The historiography of scientific psychology: A critical study. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 11(2), 157–171.\n\nThis article seems suited to professional historians but is relevant to students of the history of psychology. Wettersten’s point: in an attempt to show that scientific psychology progresses in a linear fashion from early practices and theories to current ones, historians of scientific psychology paint a misleading picture of the discipline.\n\nResources\n\nSocieties And Associations: Philosophy And Psychology\n\nhttp://psychology.ucalgary.ca/istp/\n\nThe International Society for Theoretical Psychology provides a forum for discussing contemporary psychological issues in the context of the relationship between theoretical psychology and both the history of psychology and the philosophy of knowledge.

C., & Baumeister, R. F. (Eds.). (2008). Are we free? Psychology and free will. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n\nSolid resource for introducing readers to the various issues involved in studying free will in the context of psychology today.\n\nBaumeister, R. F. (2008).

Psychological explanation: An introduction to the philosophy of psychology.

N. (1985). Science, psychology, and explanation: Synonyms or antonyms? In S. Koch & D. E. Leary (Eds.), A century of psychology as science (pp. 60–74). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.\n\nThe content of Robinson’s chapter is appropriate as a complement to a course in history of psychology and useful in challenging students to think about psychology’s status as a science.\n\nRobinson, D. N., & Mos, L. P. (Eds.). (1990). Annals of theoretical psychology. (Vol. 6, pp. 105–124). New York: Plenum.\n\nThis volume may be more suited for advanced audiences familiar with the study of the philosophy of psychology. However, it is a solid resource for introducing readers to the fact that these important issues exist in psychology.\n\nRychlak, J. F., & Rychlak, R. J. (1990).

(1990). The tempering effect of determinism in the legal system: A response to Rychlak and Rychlak. New Ideas in Psychology, 8, 31–42.\n\nWatson, R. I. (1967). Psychology: A prescriptive science. American Psychologist 22(6), 435–443.\n\nA classic publication in which Watson, concerned that psychology struggles for consensus about the nature of its content, describes themes necessary to organize the discipline. Many of these reflect inquiries that characterize philosophy, e.g., the nature of knowledge, the nature of mind and matter.\n\nPhilosophy Of Mind • Consciousness • Mind–body Problem\n\nResources for these topics are relevant to material in this chapter but are also relevant at various other points in the textbook.\n\nBlackmore, S.

Several Help Centers offer links to resources (e.g., articles, journals, videos, and podcasts) relevant to understanding phenomena such as gambling, autism, parenting, and verbal behavior and language. A Help Center for Philosophy/History is especially helpful for history of psychology students.\n\nBehavior and Philosophy is the official journal of the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies. It is “devoted to the philosophical, metaphysical, and methodological foundations of the study of behavior, brain, and mind.” Articles seem suited to an audience familiar with the overlap among philosophy of psychology, philosophy of science, and behaviorism. However, the topics addressed (e.g., Skinner’s account of determinism) are relevant to the history of psychology.\n\nThe Behavior Analyst is a journal produced by the Association for Behavior Analysis International. Coverage is more contemporary than historical but students of history of psychology would benefit from theoretical articles on behavior analysis as well as articles on behaviorism as a philosophical perspective on human functioning.\n\nThe Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior is an official publication of the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. Its content is experimental research into behavioral principles but coverage does include publications concerning the history of behavioral topics (e.g., history of stimulus generalization research, retrospectives on John B. Watson).\n\nBuckley, K. W. (1982). The selling of a psychologist: John Broadus Watson and the application of behavioral techniques to advertising.

Its permanent exhibition of Freud’s life and work is housed in his former living quarters and office (before he left Austria for England in exile from the National Socialist German Workers’ Party). The website has an online catalog of the museum’s library, as well as links to other resources (e.g., an online database of historic Freud photographs and a database honoring women’s contributions to the history of psychoanalysis).\n\nwww.freud.org.uk/\n\nThe Freud Museum in London was the home of Sigmund Freud and his family after he left Austria in 1938. The heart of the museum is Freud’s study—including his infamous couch. The museum website provides a wealth of information, for instance, a bibliography of Freud’s works, a biographical timeline, and images from the Freud Museum Photo Library. A set of topical learning modules covers various aspects of psychoanalytic theory and Freud’s life—some of which receive little attention in introductory psychology textbooks (e.g., Freud and the War Neuroses, Freud and Religion).\n\nwww.loc.gov/exhibits/freud/\n\nThe Library of Congress hosted an exhibition in 1999 (with the Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna and the Sigmund Freud Museum, London) titled Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture. The exhibition website displays images of physical items (photographs, letters, documents) that accompany clear descriptions of several topics, among them Freud’s youth, the impact of psychoanalysis, and his later writings on war and death.\n\nwww.freudarchives.org/\n\nThe Sigmund Freud archives contains approximately 45,000 items (e.g., correspondence, patient case files, photographs, notebooks) and are located at the United States Library of Congress in the Freud Collection. Visitors to the website can search the archives catalog.\n\nCollections (libraries): Psychoanalysis • Freud\n\nSeveral professional societies devoted to scholarship on classic and contemporary psychoanalytic theories maintain a physical library and permit users to search an online catalog of the library. Full-text materials are typically not available to visitors to the website, but these catalogs are a useful place to begin compiling a list of book and journal titles. Links to a very short list of these society libraries are given below.\n\nhttp://npap.org/\n\nThe website for the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis offers a searchable database of the books that comprise its Douglas Maxwell Library in New York City.

The authors conclude that these modern studies support the existence of several of the defense mechanisms.\n\nBurnham, J. (Ed.). (2012). After Freud left: A century of psychoanalysis in America. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.\n\nExcellent starting point for individuals interested in the topic of Freud’s (only) visit to the United States in 1909 and the history of how well (or not) his ideas were absorbed in this country following his visit. Chapters provide material on events before and during his visit (an invited lecture at Clark University) and the impact of Freud’s ideas in the United States decades later.\n\nEsman, A. H. (2011).

M. (2005). Reading Freud: A chronological exploration of Freud’s writings. Hove, UK: Routledge.\n\nMaterial in this book is organized in a common-sense fashion: it introduces readers to excerpts from Freud’s major works in their proper chronology. Readers can view the development of Freud’s thought and get a sense of the entirety of his body of work.

(2006). Freud’s forgotten evolutionary project. Psychoanalytic Psychology, 23(2), 420–429.\n\nExplores Freud’s belief that psychopathology could be best explained in biological and evolutionary terms (Lamarckian, not Darwinian)—a feature of his thinking that is consistent with his evaluation of his own work as scientific.\n\nSulloway, F. J. (1979). Freud, biologist of the mind: Beyond the psychoanalytic legend.

(1964). The third force in psychology. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 4(1), 19–26.\n\nHumanistic psychology saw itself as an alternative way to view human functioning, distinct from two earlier schools of thought, behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory. Bugental was a major proponent of this movement and his reflections on the value of this school of thought, written at the height of its popularity, are useful.\n\nDeCarvalho, R. J. (1990). A history of the “third force” in psychology. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 30, 22–44.\n\nOutlines the way in which humanistic psychology became an institution within American psychology.\n\nDeCarvalho, R. J. (1991).

Philosophical foundations of humanistic psychology. The Humanistic Psychologist, 20(3), 136–157.\n\nAuthor describes the extent to which humanistic psychology is part of the tradition of Western humanism, a philosophical school of thought on the nature of human beings that dates to the early fourteenth century.\n\nElkins, D. N. (2013). Why humanistic psychology lost its power and influence in American psychology. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 49(3), 267–291.\n\nArticle that provides a more complete picture of humanistic psychology than is possible to present in an introductory textbook. The author details the factors—specifically mainstream American psychology and the conservative climate of the post-1970s—that fostered the decline of humanistic psychology.\n\nGeller, L. (1982). The failure of self-actualization theory: A critique of Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 22(2), 1982, 56–73.\n\nCritical appraisal, from the perspective of a philosopher, of a major part of Rogers’s and Maslow’s thought.\n\nMoss, D. (Ed.). (1999). Humanistic and transpersonal psychology: A historical and biographical sourcebook.

(2004). Some history of humanistic psychology. The Humanistic Psychologist, 32(3), 221–238.\n\nUseful in describing activities in Europe in the 1970s that established humanistic psychology there.

Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 38(1), 42–70.\n\nAddresses the status of humanistic psychology within the recorded history of psychology and its impact on areas beyond the field.

G. (Ed.). (2012). The Cambridge companion to existentialism. New York: Cambridge University Press.\n\nAn overview of this philosophy. Chapters most relevant to the history of psychology are ones concerning Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Sartre.\n\nDreyfus, H. L., & Wrathall, M. A. (Eds.). (2006). A companion to phenomenology and existentialism. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.\n\nChapters on Husserl’s brand of phenomenology, constructs from phenomenology (e.g., intentionality), and constructs from existentialism (authenticity, freedom, and responsibility) are helpful in understanding the relevance of these philosophies to psychology.\n\nEarnshaw, S.

Montréal: McGill-Queen’s University Press.\n\nOf interest to readers who seek a deeper understanding Husserl’s phenomenology than is possible to present in an introductory psychology text. The book seems suited for an audience familiar with philosophy but sections on the ancient origins of concepts that constitute Husserl’s phenomenology (e.g., the theory of eidē, or “form”) and explanations of Husserl’s descriptive psychology are useful for the history of psychology.\n\nInwood, M. J. (2000). Heidegger: A very short introduction. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n\nSuited for an audience who may not be familiar with philosophy. Clear explanations of Heidegger’s philosophy as express"
