        "text": "Gestalt psychology or gestaltism (German: Gestalt â \"essence or shape of an entity's complete form\") is a theory of mind and brain of the Berlin School; the operational principle of gestalt psychology is that the brain is holistic, parallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies. The principle maintains that the human eye sees objects in their entirety before perceiving their individual parts. Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perception is the product of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the behaviorist approach to understanding the elements of cognitive processes, gestalt psychologists sought to understand their organization (Carlson and Heth, 2010). The gestalt effect is the form-generating capability of our senses, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of figures and whole forms instead of just a collection of simple lines and curves. In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism. The phrase \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts\" is often used when explaining gestalt theory,[1] though this is a mistranslation of Kurt Koffka's original phrase, \"The whole is other than the sum of the parts\".[2] Gestalt theory allows for the breakup of elements from the whole situation into what it really is.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Origins\n\n1.1 Gestalt therapy\n\n2 Theoretical framework and methodology\n\n3 Support from cybernetics and neurology\n\n4 Properties\n\n4.1 Emergence\n\n4.2 Reification\n\n4.3 Multistability\n\n4.4 Invariance\n\n5 PrÃ¤gnanz\n\n6 Gestalt laws of grouping\n\n7 Gestalt views in psychology\n\n8 Uses in humanâcomputer interaction\n\n9 Criticism\n\n10 See also\n\n11 References\n\n12 External links\n\n[edit] Origins\n\nThe concept of gestalt was first introduced in contemporary philosophy and psychology by Christian von Ehrenfels (a member of the School of Brentano). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by David Hume, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant, David Hartley, and Ernst Mach. Max Wertheimer's unique contribution was to insist that the \"gestalt\" is perceptually primary, defining the parts of which it was composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier Gestalt-QualitÃ¤t had been.\n\nBoth von Ehrenfels and Edmund Husserl seem to have been inspired by Mach's work BeitrÃ¤ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of gestalt and figural moment, respectively. On the philosophical foundations of these ideas see Foundations of Gestalt Theory (Smith, ed., 1988).\n\nEarly 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang KÃ¶hler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw objects as perceived within an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception â seemingly innate mental laws which determined the way in which objects were perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way you view things. It can be broken up into two: figure or ground (figureâground principle), at first glance do you see the figure in front of you or the background?\n\nThese laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive, it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects ( Carlson et al. 2000), and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.\n\n[edit] Gestalt therapy\n\nThe founders of Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, had worked with Kurt Goldstein, a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.[4] The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, even Laura Perls preferred not to use the term \"Gestalt\" to name the emerging new therapy; on the other hand, Perls eclectic approach clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.[5] Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.[6]\n\n[edit] Theoretical framework and methodology\n\nThe investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object. Contrary to this methodology, the school of gestalt practiced a series of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research.\n\nThe theoretical principles are the following:\n\nPrinciple of Totality â The conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a system of dynamic relationships.\n\nPrinciple of psychophysical isomorphism â A correlation exists between conscious experience and cerebral activity.\n\nBased on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:\n\nPhenomenon experimental analysis â In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take as a starting point phenomena and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.\n\nBiotic experiment â The school of gestalt established a need to conduct real experiments which sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher fidelity, what would be habitual for a subject.[7]\n\n[edit] Support from cybernetics and neurology\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, laboratory research in neurology and what became known as cybernetics on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that perception of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts in motion) is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:\n\nA Frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.[8]\n\nCyberneticist Valentin Turchin points out that the gestalts observed in what we usually imagine to be 'still images' are in fact exactly the kind of 'moving objects' which cause the frog's retina to respond:\n\nThe lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, \"fixes\" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image \"marks time\" in the vicinity of this point.[9]\n\n[edit] Properties\n\nThe key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, multistability and invariance.[10]\n\n[edit] Emergence\n\nEmergence is the process of complex pattern formation from simpler rules. It is demonstrated by the perception of the dog picture, which depicts a Dalmatian dog sniffing the ground in the shade of overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts. Instead, the dog is perceived as a whole, all at once. However, this is a description of what occurs in vision and not an explanation. Gestalt theory does not explain how the percept of a dog emerges.\n\n[edit] Reification\n\nReification is the constructive or generative aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.\n\nFor instance, a triangle will be perceived in picture A, although no triangle has actually been drawn. In pictures B and D the eye will recognize disparate shapes as \"belonging\" to a single shape, in C a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.\n\nReification can be explained by progress in the study of illusory contours, which are treated by the visual system as \"real\" contours.\n\nSee also: Reification (fallacy)\n\n[edit] Multistability\n\nMultistability (or multistable perception) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen for example in the Necker cube, and in Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion shown here. Other examples include the Three-legged blivet and artist M. C. Escher's artwork and the appearance of flashing marquee lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain how images appear multistable, only that they do.\n\n[edit] Invariance\n\nInvariance is the property of perception whereby simple geometrical objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in A in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in B. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in C, and when depicted using different graphic elements as in D. Computational theories of vision, such as those by David Marr, have had more success in explaining how objects are classified.\n\nEmergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to be modeled individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified dynamic mechanism.[citation needed]\n\n[edit] PrÃ¤gnanz\n\nMain article: Principles of grouping\n\nThe fundamental principle of gestalt perception is the law of prÃ¤gnanz (in the German language, pithiness) which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetric, and simple. Gestalt psychologists attempt to discover refinements of the law of prÃ¤gnanz, and this involves writing down laws which hypothetically allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called \"gestalt laws\".[11] These include:\n\n[edit] Gestalt laws of grouping\n\nA major aspect of Gestalt psychology is that it implies that the mind understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts. The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws. The various laws are called laws or principles depending on the paper in which they are discussed but for simplicity sake this article will use the term laws. These laws deal with the sensory modality vision however there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman â GP). The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923). Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual perception.[12]\n\nLaw of Proximity â The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group. For example, in the figure illustrating the Law of Proximity, there are 72 circles in total, but we perceive the collection of circles to be in groups. Specifically, we perceive there to be a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image. This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.[12][13]\n\nLaw of Similarity â The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects will be perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other. This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities. For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square. In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark and 18 of the circles are shaded light. We perceive the dark circles to be grouped together and the light circles to be grouped together forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.[13]\n\nLaw of Closure â The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research has shown that the purpose of completing a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is in order to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure depicting the law of closure portrays what we perceive to be a circle on the left side of the image and a square on the right side of the image. However, there are gaps missing from the shapes. If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations and curvatures, but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.[12][13]\n\nLaw of Symmetry â The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to be able to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape. Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects will be grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets. When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.[12][13]\n\nLaw of Common Fate â The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths individuals perceive objects to be on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path. For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.[14]\n\nLaw of Continuity â The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object. In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap. We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.[12]\n\nLaw of Good Gestalt â The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity in order to observe a reality in its most simplistic form. The elimination of extraneous stimuli aids the mind in creating meaning. This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the law of PrÃ¤gnanz.[12] PrÃ¤gnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean \"pithiness\" and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.[14]\n\nLaw of Past Experience â The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience. If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together. For example, the English language, which contains 26 letters are grouped to form words using a set of rules. If an individual reads an English word that they have never come across they use the law of past experience to interpret the letterâs \"L\" and \"I\" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.[14]\n\nThe gestalt laws of grouping have recently been subjected to modern methods of scientific evaluation by examining the visual cortex using cortical algorithms. Current Gestalt psychologists have described their findings, which showed correlations between physical visual representations of objects and self-report perception as the laws of seeing.[14]\n\n[edit] Gestalt views in psychology\n\nGestalt psychologists find it is important to think of problems as a whole. Max Wertheimer considered thinking to happen in two ways: productive and reproductive.[11]\n\nProductive thinking is solving a problem with insight.\n\nThis is a quick insightful unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction.\n\nReproductive thinking is solving a problem with previous experiences and what is already known. (1945/1959).\n\nThis is a very common thinking. For example, when a person is given several segments of information, he/she deliberately examines the relationships among its parts, analyzes their purpose, concept, and totality, he/she reaches the \"aha!\" moment, using what is already known. Understanding in this case happens intentionally by reproductive thinking.\n\nAnother gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:\n\nUnconscious leap in thinking.[11]\n\nThe increased amount of speed in mental processing.\n\nThe amount of short-circuiting which occurs in normal reasoning.[15]\n\nViews going against the gestalt psychology are:\n\nNothing-special view\n\nNeo-gestalt view\n\nThe Three-Process View\n\nGestalt psychology should not be confused with the gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-JÃ¼rgen Walter.\n\n[edit] Uses in humanâcomputer interaction\n\nThe gestalt laws are used in user interface design. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing radio buttons. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns. Gestalt psychology also has applications in computer vision for trying to make computers \"see\" the same things as humans do.[16]\n\nJames J. Gibson was a Gestalt Psychologist who focused on vision and what he termed ecological perception. He also coined the term affordance which has been productive of various human factors and usability research.\n\n[edit] Criticism\n\nIn some scholarly communities, such as cognitive psychology and computational neuroscience, gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being descriptive rather than explanatory in nature. For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, Bruce, Green & Georgeson[17] conclude the following regarding gestalt theory's influence on the study of visual perception:\n\nThe physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their \"laws\" of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a \"good\" or \"simple\" shape, for example?\n\n[edit] See also\n\nGestalt therapy â often mistaken for gestalt psychology\n\nStructural information theory\n\nRudolf Arnheim\n\nWolfgang Metzger\n\nKurt Goldstein\n\nPÃ¡l Schiller Harkai\n\nSolomon Asch\n\nHermann Friedmann\n\nJames J.
