ThinkFilm Type Subsidiary Fate Bankruptcy Founded September 2001 Defunct October 5, 2010 Headquarters New York City, New York, U.S. Parent Capitol Films Divisions Velocity Home Entertainment Website http://www.thinkfilmcompany.com/

ThinkFilm (stylized as TH!NKFilm) was a U.S. film distribution company founded in September 2001. It had been a division of David Bergsteinâ€™s Capitol Films since 2006.

On October 5, 2010, five of Bergstein's companies in the film industry, Capitol Films, ThinkFilm, R2D2, CT-1 and Capco were forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by a group of creditors led by the Aramid Entertainment film investment fund seeking payment for outstanding debts of $16 million. It's assets were later acquired by Tartan Entertainment.

This led to a Hollywood legal battle involving Bergstein, his financial partner, Ronald Tudor, the creditors and various lawyers and companies in the industry.
