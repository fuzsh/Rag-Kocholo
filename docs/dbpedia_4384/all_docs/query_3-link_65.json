        "text": "The Hollywood Reporter says that ThinkFilm has obtained the North American rights to Mitchell's comedy-drama, which features actors engaging in actual sex on screen. \"Shortbus,\" according to the industry paper, is largely improvised and \"explores the lives of seven straight and gay New Yorkers seeking an emotional connection with one another.\"\n\nThinkFilm's Mark Urman, who heads the indie company's theatrical division, told the Hollywood Reporter, \"We [at ThinkFilm] all saw it together, and were unanimous about it. It's quite groundbreaking, and we were all impressed with how natural and normal and comedic the extreme sex became without being offensive.\"\n\nBecause of the movie's explicit nature, marketing of the film may be a challenge, but Urman said, \"Maybe we won't take TV ads. . . [but] there'll be enormous pre-awareness, and once you let the cat out of the bag, that cat should be allowed to prowl.\"\n\n\"Shortbus\" was written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell. The cast features Raphael Barker, Lindsay Beamish, Justin Bond, Jay Brannan, Paul Dawson, PJ DeBoy, Sook-Yin Lee, Yolonda Ross, Daniela Sea, Rachael C. Smith and Peter Stickles."
