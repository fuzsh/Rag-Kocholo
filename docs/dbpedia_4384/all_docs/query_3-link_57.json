        "text": "The line between art film and porn is becoming as thin as a G-string ,\n\nFine Line Features\n\nJohn Waters' new comedy, \"A Dirty Shame,\" starring Tracey Ullman, is rated NC-17.Got sex?\n\nThat could be the art-film circuit's new slogan as explicit sex has returned to the big screen with a vengeance.\n\nNever mind that the porn industry has migrated from grungy theaters to home video and the Internet.\n\nNever mind that U.S. broadcast companies and the Federal Communications Commission continue to act as if Janet Jackson's Super Bowl \"wardrobe malfunction\" marked the end of civilization as we know it.\n\nNever mind that politicians continue to tout their \"traditional values\" by treating the entertainment industry like a pinata.\n\nThe cinema is in the midst of its own sexual revolution, flouting taboos and exploring sexuality more brazenly than ever, even if American filmmakers have been slow to pick up the mantle and explicit sex remains an anathema to mainstream theater and video chains as well as the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nYou know something's going on when Brian Grazer, Ron Howard's producing partner, is preparing a sexually graphic documentary about the cultural impact of '70s porn film \"Deep Throat.\"\n\nYou know something's going on when one of the Oscar season's most anticipated films is a biopic about sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.\n\nYou know something's going on when veteran shockmeister John Waters takes an NC-17 movie about sex to the Toronto International Film Festival, and it comes off as the festival's tamest take on the subject. Sure, the characters talk and gesticulate nastily amid the one-note campiness of Waters' \"A Dirty Shame,\" but other films on the horizon are confronting viewers with the real thing.\n\nIt's as if the cultural wars have exploded in incoherence outrage over an exposed breast sandwiched between ads addressing sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"One can argue that over the last three years, there's been this kind of paranoia and conservatism in the world, and artists always thrive when it's a little repressed,\" said Canadian director Clement Virgo, who just completed filming the sexually explicit \"Lie with Me\" for ThinkFilm. Yet at the same time, \"on the TV you see an ad talking about 'if you have an erection for more than four hours.' People are talking about this openly now.\"\n\nGrazer, whose \"Inside Deep Throat\" is scheduled to be released unrated by no less than Universal Pictures in January, sees the dynamics surrounding that landmark 1972 porn film as being repeated on a larger scale.\n\n\"We're experiencing in a much grander fashion porno chic,\" the producer said in a phone interview. \"I think it's now entered the mainstream in a much more pervasive way than the fad surrounding 'Deep Throat.' \"\n\nGrazer added \"If you're going to spend the time or money to make a movie, and you want it to be sexually charged, you're forced to go further because we've become somewhat sexually desensitized. Every poster and television ad, you get on the Internet, and it's clogged on pornography. I think if a filmmaker wants to have impact or shock you -- and that's what movies have to do -- you have to find original images that shock.\"\n\nOften these are sexually graphic images transplanted from the low-rent aesthetic of pornography into the high-brow world of art films. \"9 Songs,\" a Toronto premiere from prolific British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom (\"Welcome to Sarajevo,\" \"24-Hour Party People\"), is almost completely composed of explicit sex scenes between a rather vapid young couple intercut with concert footage of Franz Ferdinand and other rock bands. The idea is to show a relationship's arc through its sex, though it more convincingly shows a relationship's sex (and its many varieties) through its sex.\n\nSwedish filmmaker Lukas Moodysson's \"A Hole in My Heart\" and French director Catherine Breillat's \"Anatomy of Hell\" offer close-ups of female genitalia in their confrontational explorations of sex and power, and more than a few people who caught German filmmaker Bruce LaBruce's \"The Raspberry Reich\" at the Toronto or Sundance festivals this year likened it to hard-core gay (and straight) porn.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the modest $224,000 gross that Vincent Gallo's \"The Brown Bunny\" has racked up is no doubt due to actress Chloe Sevigny's well-publicized oral-sex scene with the star-director.\n\n\"I'm all for it,\" Waters said of the drive toward explicitness. This is the filmmaker, after all, who had Divine doing a Chloe Sevigny on her character's son back in 1972's \"Pink Flamingos.\" \"Eventually when finally two Hollywood stars do penetration for real, maybe that will end the MPAA. That's the only thing left. That will happen.\"\n\nSex is no stranger to the cinema, as early '70s films such as Bernardo Bertolucci's \"Last Tango in Paris\" and Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now\" portrayed the act with striking candor. But, myths about \"Don't Look Now\" aside, these actors were acting.\n\nThe recent wave of European films, at first starring unknowns, has removed that barrier of simulation, with directors such as Breillat, Bruno Dumont (\"L'Humanite\"), Gaspar Noe (\"I Stand Alone\") and Leos Carax (\"Pola X\") leading the way. French director Patrice Chereau's English-language \"Intimacy\" (2001) pushed the envelope by showing two relatively well-known actors, Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox, cavorting for real.\n\nPresenting her new film in Toronto, Breillat took credit for the trend. \"I'm the explanation, the fact that I've been making my films for over 25 years,\" she said. \"It's gotten to the point where any new French directors, in their first film, it's almost a necessity to prove themselves by including a very violent sexual scene.\"\n\nSex has become such a non-issue overseas that Moodysson said the Swedish government provided most of the funding for \"A Hole in My Heart\" with full knowledge of its content. That Europeans are willing to finance sex-themed movies -- and that these movies have found ways to make money in the U.S. -- has not gone unnoticed on this side of the pond.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell, who directed and starred in his musical \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" (2001), said that investors have been \"scared\" of his planned next film, \"Shortbus,\" a comedy that will depict actual sex. But he sees \"The Brown Bunny\" as turning the tide.\n\n\"It is funny that the sexual zeitgeist has finally hit North America because it's been in Europe for a while,\" Mitchell said. \"We're finally getting some money in.\"\n\nWho's investing? \"Our first money has come from European foreign-sales companies,\" Mitchell said, \"and I expect the rest will be more adventurous people with money rather than film companies in North America.\"\n\nMaking money on such films also has become easier thanks to the digital video.\n\n\"The digital revolution does make it very possible to do things very intimately minus the intrusion and inhibition of cameras and large crews, and these films can be made very thriftily,\" ThinkFilm U.S. distribution chief Mark Urman. \"When you're experimenting, that's perhaps not a bad idea.\"\n\nSo it's not surprising that the upcoming sex-themed film with the widest distribution, Bill Condon's \"Kinsey,\" isn't particularly experimental. \"In order to talk about sex, it placed itself within quite a conventional romantic movie structure,\" Cowan said. \"It's very traditionally made. There's such a careful attention to how sex is treated.\"\n\nCondon, who will present \"Kinsey\" to open next month's Chicago International Film Festival, doesn't disagree. \"There is a movie to be made about Kinsey that would be really in-your-face, but I thought it was important to suggest the context in which this amazing figure emerged,\" the writer-director said. In other words, Kinsey's theories and sexually explicit slides seem that much more shocking in the sunny context of a lovingly shot biopic (which stars Liam Neeson).\n\nEven so, Condon said that although Fox Searchlight will release \"Kinsey\" this fall, a British company provided the bulk of its financing, and the process took years. (He finished the script in 2000.) The filmmaker was anticipating a ratings battle until the MPAA surprised him by giving the movie an R without demanding that photos of aroused genitalia be cut.\n\n\"Kinsey\" triumphed in its Toronto premiere while the reaction to the more graphic fare was mixed. Even filmmakers not crossing such lines were drawn into the discussion.\n\n\"Sex scenes have gotten increasingly explicit in film, so it's not surprising to me that there's been this crossover to real sex,\" said Nicole Kassell, whose well-received directorial debut \"The Woodsman\" stars Kevin Bacon as a pedophile struggling to reform. \"The thing that I find curious is that they say that it's just a natural part of the film, but personally as a viewer I find it impossible not to separate myself from the fact that I'm watching real people have real sex. That does take me out of the film. Somehow it's not as safe as when you know it's acted.\"\n\nBritish director Sally Potter, who uses iambic pentameter rather than naked bodies to depict the affair between an American-Irish woman (Joan Allen) and a Lebanese man (Simon Abkarian) in \"Yes,\" said her own tendency is to pull back from graphic depictions to tap into deeper currents.\n\n\"The sexual impulse is a complicated one,\" she said. \"Some of it's to do with reproduction. Some of it's to do with attraction. Some of it's just to do with affection, communication, the need for touch, which is not necessarily the same as sex. All of these complicated factors are involved, and to reduce it to just kind of humping buttocks is not really for me.\"\n\nTo Potter, these explicit new films veer into pornography, of course a highly profitable industry itself. But Virgo and other directors insist the whole point is to view sex with an artist's sensibility.\n\n\"Michael Winterbottom, no one can say he's a porn director,\" said the Canadian Virgo. \"Catherine Breillat, Alfonso Cuaron -- these are real filmmakers. I think it's filmmakers really trying to push the frontier in the same way they pushed the frontier in violence.\"\n\nCowan sees a clear distinction \"Pornography's sole purpose is to titillate. And films are intended to promote intellectual reactions.\"\n\nHe added \"It may be a sad commentary that these two things rarely coincide.\"\n\nThis story appeared on Page B1 of The Standard-Times on September 27, 2004."
