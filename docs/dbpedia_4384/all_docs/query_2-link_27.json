        "text": "All information published in the indieWIRE Distributor Profiles is provided by the individual company.\n\nCompany History\n\nPaladin was formed in the summer of 2009 by veteran independent distributor Mark Urman, (who co-founded and headed THINKFilm for its entire seven-year existence, and who previously served as President of Lions Gate Releasing and, more recently, as President of Senator Distribution. Working with a core team of executives, all of whom came from THINK, Urman officially launched Paladin with it first release, the acclaimed drama, “Disgrace,” starring John Malkovich, in September 2009. Other 2009 releases include the comedy “Splinterheads” and the period drama, “Loss of a Teardrop Diamond,” based on a previously unproduced screenplay by legendary writer Tennessee Williams. In 2010 Paladin has released Jeb Stuart’s civil rights drama, “Blood Done Sign My name;” Bette Gordon’s ensemble drama “Handsome Harry,” Shana Feste’s “The Greatest,” with Pierce Brosnan, Carey Mulligan, and Susan Sarandon, and “Great Directors,” a documentary by Angela Ismailos. In association with Reliance, Paladin oversaw the release of the epic romance, “Kites,” which was the widest- ever release of a Bollywood film in North American history. Paladin also released Brett Ratner’s American version of the film, “KITES: The Remix”. In association with Tribeca Film, Paladin has handled the national theatrical release of Julian Nitzberg’s acclaimed documentary, “The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia” as well as the British comedy, “The Infidel,” currently in release. The Sundance favorite, “Douchebag,” by Drake Doremus, opens October 1.\n\nCompany Focus\n\nTypes of films in distributor’s slate:\n\nPaladin’s slate has been varied and eclectic, incorporating a broad range of genres, nationalities, and budgetary categories.\n\nAdvice for filmmakers:\n\nFilmmakers should have a thorough knowledge of their distribution options even as their film goes into production and we frequently counsel and work up marketing and distribution plans for filmmakers while they are arranging for their financing. More importantly, producers should always be prepared to partner with a suitable distributor— Paladin, for example—to guarantee a theatrical release for their film, even if it is a limited one. In the current climate, this can often result in a better and more remunerative release than might be offered though traditional means.\n\nQuick Stats\n\nWho handles acquisitions:\n\nMark Urman, Owner and CEO\n\nNumber of films released theatrically each year:\n\n8 to 10\n\nDistribution platforms other than theatrical:\n\nPaladin is a theatrical distributor only, but works closely with its filmmakers to guarantee and optimize the release of its titles in all platforms, frequently partnering with a film’s post-theatrical distributor from the get-go.\n\nNumber of films released exclusively via VOD/DVD or “alternative” means of release:\n\nNone.\n\nNumber of films acquired at festivals:\n\nUsually we get involved subsequent to a festival premiere though, in some instances, we have attached ourselves to films prior to any exposure –festival or market—whatsoever."
