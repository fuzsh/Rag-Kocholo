        "text": "Federation Entertainment’s fresh cash injection comes from a round of financiers including Bpifrance, BNP Paribas Développement, Amundi Private Equity Funds, Alliance Entreprendre and Entrepreneur Venture.\n\nBreton who founded the company in 2013 to develop, produce and distribute premium dramas worldwide, said the extra funds will help Federation strengthen its capacity for long-term development. “The objective is to support the organic growth of our investments in production and distribution while expanding our international presence, notably through acquisitions, in order to become one of the leading European studios, with a very active branch in the US.”\n\nFederation just expanded into non-scripted content by taking a majority stake in French production company WeMake, headed by Bouchra Réjani, former C.O.O of Shine France.\n\nFederation’s scripted portfolio comprises French TV hits The Bureau and Marseille, (Netflix’s first French Original), the Israeli thriller Hostages and the German financial thriller Bad Banks.\n\nThe Company has successfully licenced Fisher King’s Finnish crime series Bordertown (Sorjonen) to key territories including Germany (Sky Deutschland), France (Canalplay) and Belgium ( VRT), with Netflix handling the US, Canada, the UK, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia and the Netherlands. Season 2 produced again by Fisher King for Yle, in co-produced with Federation, premiered on the Finnish pubcaster October 7.\n\nAt MIPCOM, Federation will start discussions on season 3 of Miikko Oikkonen’s crime show starring Ville Virtanen as detective Kari Sorjonen. The distributor will launch another Finnish political thriller, Secret Enemies (8x52’) produced by Moskito Television for C More/MTV3 and will continue sales on the Norwegian dramedy One Night, produced by Viafilm for NRK."
