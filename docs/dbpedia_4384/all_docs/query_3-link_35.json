        "text": "How do I become a digital imaging technician?\n\nTypically, digital imaging technicians work their way up through the camera department. A good route into this is through becoming a camera trainee. ScreenSkills and the Guild of British Camera Technicians both run trainee schemes. Follow these steps for your best chance of being successful in an application.\n\nAt school or college:\n\nIf you want to go to university take A-levels or Highers in a combination that includes art, art and design or graphic communication with maths and physics. Or you might want to take one of the following Level 3 vocational qualifications:\n\nBTEC National Diploma/Extended Diploma in Art and Design\n\nBTEC National Extended Diploma in Creative Digital Media Production\n\nNCFE Applied General Certificate in Art and Design\n\nUAL Applied General Diploma/Extended Diploma in Art and Design\n\nIf you want to go straight into a job or apprenticeship, the following qualifications Level 3 vocational qualifications are relevant:\n\nBTEC National Diploma in Film and Television Production\n\nBTEC National Diploma in Photography OCR Technical Diploma in Digital Media (Moving Image and Audio Production)\n\nUAL Diploma/Extended Diploma in Art and Design\n\nUAL Diploma/Extended Diploma in Creative Media Production and Technology\n\nGet an apprenticeship:\n\nAn apprenticeship is a job with training, so it’s a great opportunity to earn while you learn. However, it can be challenging to find jobs as an apprentice with production companies as many are not able to take on people for a whole year, which is an apprenticeship requirement at the moment. But in England, there’s a Level 3 apprenticeship as a photographic assistant. You might be able to find a job through that standard with an employer in another sector, such as a government department or digital media company. Think about taking that job, learning the core skills of photography and transferring those skills into film and TV drama at a later point.\n\nCheck out What’s an apprenticeship? to learn more about apprenticeships and find an apprenticeship to learn how to find one in your region, or approach companies directly. Go to ScreenSkills information on apprenticeships for the main apprenticeship schemes in film and television.\n\nMake a portfolio:\n\nLearn about digital photography, both still and moving images. Make some films showing your ability to shoot and grade. Look at our advice on how to build a portfolio. A portfolio is essential for impressing admissions tutors and people in the film and TV drama industries.\n\nWork for an equipment company:\n\nGet your hands on as much gear as you can and learn how it works. Contact an equipment rental company like Panavision, Provision or ARRI Rentals. Ask if you can become a kit runner or driver for them. That way you will get to learn more about the kit and build up contacts. See our advice on approaching employers to learn how to do this.\n\nGet a degree:\n\nIt’s not essential by any means, but if you want a degree, have a look at ScreenSkills’ list of recommended courses in film and TV. We recognise courses with our ScreenSkills Select award where they offer training in the relevant software, dedicated time to building a portfolio and have strong links with the film and TV industries.\n\nNetwork:\n\nGo to ScreenSkills’ events, such as Open Doors, where you can meet people who work in the industry. Give people in the camera department your details and ask if you can do work experience. Look at our page that explains how to network well.\n\nNetwork online:\n\nCreate a LinkedIn profile. See if there’s a Facebook page or other social media group for people making films or videos in your area. Join it. Create a ScreenSkills profile.\n\nBecome a trainee:\n\nApply to be a camera trainee or floor runner with ScreenSkills’ Trainee Finder scheme. There are also schemes offered by the Guild of British Camera Technicians.\n\nYou might also be interested in…\n\nBeing a digital imaging technician in the unscripted TV industry.\n\nFurther resources"
