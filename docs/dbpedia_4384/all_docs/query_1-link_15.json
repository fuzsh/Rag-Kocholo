        "text": "sexual violence and sexual threat\n\nThere are two rapes and a further sexual assault. In one scene, a woman is dragged from a bus by the driver, and is raped by another man, who hits and chokes her, bites her breast, and buries her alive.\n\ninjury detail\n\nIn one sequence, a journalist examines crime scene images which depict women who have been murdered - some are graphic, and one woman's head and face have been smashed to a pulp.\n\nflashing/flickering lights\n\nThis work contains flashing images which may affect viewers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy.\"]\n\nScenes of violence include shooting, choking and eye gouging. Violence is sometimes accompanied by bloody images. During a sequence which takes place in a strip club, topless dancers perform onstage while, in a more private area, women have sex with customers. There is infrequent strong language ('f**k'), as well as milder terms including 'shit', 'piss', 'bastard' and 'balls'. A woman claims Indian people are unable to distinguish between real and imagined events."
