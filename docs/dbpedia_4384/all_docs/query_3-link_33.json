        "text": "Georgia Film and TV Production\n\nThe Georgia Film Office maintains a locations database of thousands of properties and provides scouting assistance as well as certifying projects for the tax incentive. With its temperate climate, great variety of locations, the world’s busiest airport (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport), large crew base and pro-business focus, Georgia is now a leading destination in the world for filming TV and movies. The Camera Ready Communities program is in place to connect producers with skilled county liaisons who provide resources like film studios, lodging, assistance with local permitting laws and more. Georgia’s infrastructure is perfect for filming studios as well. The state currently has 4 million square feet of stage space, and to meet growing demand, companies like Gray Television are hard at work creating new state-of-the-art facilities. Follow the resources below to learn more about the Georgia film and TV production industry.\n\nConnect with Us on Social\n\nYouTube\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter"
