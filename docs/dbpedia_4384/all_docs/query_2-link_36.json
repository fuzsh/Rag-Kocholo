As I would recall. Imported color film everywhere, developing, printing at every corner at least in Moscow (10M people population).\n\nBefore, I have to go to the special store and special lab for East German Agfa slides. BW wasn't sold just everywhere either.\n\nI think \"my\" folks have short memories, they only remember nineties with affordable and working imported PS cameras and somewhat affordable and quality consistent imported color film.\n\nI wonder if it was significantly different in the free world of spending-consuming (USA) and not even developed yet countries like India and China where majority of the planet Earth population is for sometime. Fifties-seventies-eighties?\n\nRecently, I discovered photo of me taken at Excalibur hotel (LV) escalator in nineties . One person in the background is hiding his face from the camera by holding plastic shopping bag with film developing advertising and it is isn't cheap service.\n\nWe came to Canada as family in 2003 and color film wasn't cheap at all for family pictures. I complained to one Canadian how expensive color film is, he asked about current price is and told me it is as expensive as it was well before we came to Canada.\n\nNow after learning how to bw it same way as millions did for decades I feel astonished every time I'm asked \"do they still sell film?\"\n\nYes, they still sell film, paper, chemicals and else, but it is just as it was initially. In special stores, not at your groceries place.\n\nIt is as normal to me as art supplies store which sell things for painting.\n\nIs art of painting dead in consumers heads because canvas and oil based paint isn't available at every corner?\n\nSirius Glass\n\nJoined\n\nJan 18, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n48,845\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern California\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#2\n\nSo much disinterest in film that they are not interested to find out on their own plus since they shoot digital the world must all shoot digital.\n\nDannL.\n\nJoined\n\nOct 13, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n617\n\nFormat\n\nLarge Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#3\n\nAs far as painting . . . there are probably 20 stores withing 10 miles of my home, where I can buy those supplies. For the past 20 years I have only known of one store that carried photographic/darkroom supplies. Then about 10 years ago I found I could order over the internet and get a decent price and selection. Having local access to photographic supplies is not of great importance to me. It's not as if I need to squeeze the bag of Dektol to determine if it will work. People think things are dead because they haven't heard about them for a while.\n\nSo, with that . . . .

Film is the same today. Large colorful displays of film and processing services have either completely disappeared or they are found on a small end-cap or on 3 pegs in front of the cash register.\n\nNeither photography nor painting fits in with today's fast paced society of 'I want it all and I want it now'.\n\nOptiKen\n\nJoined\n\nOct 31, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n1,055\n\nLocation\n\nOrange County\n\nFormat\n\nMedium Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#5\n\nSo, with that . . . .

One could drop off color print films for High quality Kodak processing at a multitude of convenient locations and expect prints in a few days. We had Fotomat booths in parking lots for pete's sake! Camera stores all had large darkroom sections...heck, even places like Target, K-Mart and walmart had darkroom gear and supplies (ok, maybe this was more like 40 years ago)?. In the late 1970's and early 1980's one could buy a Pentax K-1000 with a 50mm f/1.7 Pentax-m lens at K-mart for around $200. We had pro-labs, portrait studios and wedding photogs...Kodak was one of the 30 companies that made up the DOW Jones industrial average!\n\nWhat visible evidence of the existence of film does the general population have today? Almost none. It is all gone. Many (most?) people under the age of about 25 years have never even seen a roll of film or a non-digital camera. Of course they think it is extinct...because for them, it is.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Sep 3, 2015\n\nSirius Glass\n\nJoined\n\nJan 18, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n48,845\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern California\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#10\n\nI hate to say this, but the digital camera market appears to be dead.

It is equally as dead as oil painting, or nearly so. I can still get some color films at my local drug store which still does film processing. You can see the machines in the photo area of the store. I can't get Windsor Newton paints or canvases at the store though.\n\nThe last time I stepped foot into the local camera store, they were in the process of ending their processing of film. I can no longer get film there. I previously had color film developed there and bought B&W processing supplies. That is all gone. They may still sell entry level film cameras (Nikon?) and some used stuff, but they mostly push digital. Every time I have been in that store I feel like I am bothering the staff.\n\nThe local art store that my wife takes oil painting classes in has a rich selection of art supplies covering many different mediums. They hold lots of weekend demonstrations there for drawing, cartooning, etc, and offer lots of classes for kids. It is a very vibrant store with knowledgeable staff, many of whom are professional artists. They are a local store and can't compete with the prices from Dick Blick on-line, but my wife can't take classes from Dick Blick. However, they have no film stuff. Not really surprising.\n\nThe camera store I mentioned used to cater to the professional photographers in town including professional lab services. Their attitude is not friendly to the amateur while the art store is. Just think if the art store started carrying film supplies and giving awesome darkroom classes. Just think if the camera store did the same.\n\nIt's all about promotion at some level. If the film isn't promoted, it doesn't exist.\n\nRegards,\n\nRob\n\ngzinsel\n\nJoined\n\nMar 20, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n402\n\nFormat\n\nMed.

By and large most artists get their \"supplies\" from web site, not brick and mortar stores. Fine artists of the high brow type, are in their own sub-culture if you will. Out of sight out mind!!!! they are there, you just have to and look. I do not think that the touch sensitive arts are dead. its just not part of popular culture. But, popular culture is not ALL of culture. there are plenty of sub's out there.\n\nrbultman\n\nJoined\n\nSep 1, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n411\n\nLocation\n\nLouisville,\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#13\n\nBut, popular culture is not ALL of culture. there are plenty of sub's out there.\n\n+1\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n2,905\n\nLocation\n\nOgden, Utah\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#14\n\nI have no idea what you are talking about.

I imagine needles for them are available, but the one I have has worked fine for 30 years.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Sep 3, 2015\n\nJoined\n\nJul 28, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n2,905\n\nLocation\n\nOgden, Utah\n\nFormat\n\nMulti Format\n\nSep 3, 2015\n\n#15\n\nI hate to say this, but the digital camera market appears to be dead.

Students there could't grasp why I would want to make c-prints when I could just pull them off a memory card and push paper through an epson. A 4x5 c-print is nearly impossible to beat. So much sharper and richer than anything an epson can produce. Plus a good color lab is hard to find, at least in St. Louis.
