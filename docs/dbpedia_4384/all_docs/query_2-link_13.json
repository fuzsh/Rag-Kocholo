        "text": "Canadian film producer and distributor ThinkFilm, known for putting edgy and acclaimed indie productions such as Shortbus and Born Into Brothels into theatres, has been sold to a U.S. film financier.\n\nThe Canadian-based company announced the decision in a statement on Tuesday, adding that producer and financier David Bergstein had alsoalready purchased Capitol Films, a European production company that specializes in international projects.\n\nThe two acquisitions will create a \"formidable new force in the independent marketplace,\" ThinkFilm said.\n\nFinancial details were not released.\n\nJeff Sackman, ThinkFilm's Montreal-born president, CEO and founder, said the sale allows the company to remain based in Canada.\n\n\"We're a Canadian-initiated company based in Canada but we decided to operate in the volatile waters of the U.S.,\" Sackman said in an interview.\n\n\"This sale represents a reverse brain drain, in a way. It's a matter of nationalistic pride that I get to stay in Canada. I really didn't want to live in New York or L.A. and this proves you can be successful in this business and stay here, in a better country,\" said Sackman, a former Cineplex and Lionsgate Filmsexecutive.\n\nEstablished about five years ago, ThinkFilm has developed a name for itself as a Canadian success story, with multiple Academy Award nominations and one win in its young history.\n\nIn addition to Shortbus and the 2005 best documentary Oscar-winner Born Into Brothels, ThinkFilm's credits include Where The Truth Lies andThe Assassination of Richard Nixon, the documentaries Murderball, The Aristocrats and Spellbound, cult films Strangers with Candy and Awesome: Iâ¦ Shot That, and recent titles Tideland, Half Nelson, Everything's Gone Green and Citizen Duane."
