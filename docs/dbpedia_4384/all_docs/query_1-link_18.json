        "text": "Netflix will handle global distribution on the film outside Finland, where new local distributor Aurora Studios will handle the cinema release and Yle, the TV premiere.\n\nBuilding on the global branding of the hit crime series Bordertown, Fisher King CEO Matti Halonen has gathered the same creative team consisting of writers Mikko Oikkonen and Antti Pesonen, as well as director Juuso Syrjä.\n\nVille Virtanen reprises his role as investigator Kari Sorjonen, Anu Sinisalo as Lena Jaakkola and Sampo Sarkola as Sorjonen’s arche enemy Lasse Maasalo.\n\nThe story unfolds as a mural of Lasse Maasalo is found, painted in blood, at a train station. Beneath the mural is written: ”Making the World a Better Place”. The same message is found on a social media voting contest. When three of the most-voted people disappear, acclaimed investigator Kari Sorjonen is asked to come back to work. He is the only one who can solve the society-shaking hate crime, but only if he manages to get his own mind together."
