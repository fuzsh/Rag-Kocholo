        "text": "MANSFIELD - If there's one thing that makes Daniel Roemer light up, it's seeing an actor perform brilliantly on screen and being part of that magical moment.\n\n\"It's kind of an explosion of the soul,\" the filmmaker said. \"It's so intangible. You can say and do all the right things, but when a moment happens there's something intangible about it, and you caught it on film.\"\n\nGrowing up in Mansfield, Roemer was always making movies and casting his friends in his films, which were often spoofs of popular movies.\n\n\"Looking back now, I think I can diagnose it. I always felt a little out of control in my own life and my family life,\" Roemer said. \"I think film making is a way to sort of control a world that isn't really controllable in the real world. And you can use that in a positive way.\"\n\nRoemer fell in love with film in the 1990s, during what he calls the \"New Golden Age\" of film, when films like \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Forrest Gump\" and \"The Matrix\" were coming out.\n\nAfter graduating from Mansfield Christian School in 1999, Roemer moved to California to pursue his passion.\n\nHe started studying at the University of Southern California, where he quickly found a mentor who took him on shoots and encouraged him to make one of his scripts into a short film.\n\nThat film, \"American Wet Dream,\" was met with a positive reception and was screened at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre alongside films made by graduate students. Roemer was just a freshman.\n\n\"It's the first and only time in my life I've ever been carried out of a room like a player in baseball game,\" Roemer said. \"It's funny because even to this day, I make other stuff and people still refer to that film I made when I was 19.\"\n\nAfter turning down a music video contract to make a movie that ended up falling through, Roemer decided to face his fears and try something new. He began taking acting classes, an experience he said has helped him as a director and inspired the Acting For Film class he now teaches at the Mansfield Art Center.\n\nRoemer was a top student in his acting classes and has starred in some of his own films, but at the end of the day, his passion is for directing.\n\n\"When it comes down to it, I still like the combination of being versatile visually and versatile with the actors,\" Roemer said. \"I think that's a deadly combination, and the best directors out there possess both equally.\"\n\nRoemer dropped out of school and took a job at Access Hollywood, where he did red carpet interviews with celebrities like Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and a longer interview with Ben Stiller.\n\nSince then, Roemer has worked with Sony Pictures and had films like \"The Select Fit\" distributed by Lionsgate. He has a series of short films that are screened on cell phones around the world. His films have been screened Sundance, AFI Fest and LA Shorts Fest, where he was a finalist for the \"DNA Award,\" the festival's top honor of a million dollar feature deal with Universal Pictures.\n\nRoemer has made USA Film's Top 10 list of emerging directors. He's a two-time best director finalist on Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's \"Project Greenlight\" and a top 50 director finalist for Fox's reality show \"On the Lot,\" produced by Steven Spielberg and Mark Burnett.\n\nBeing a finalist time and time again has been frustrating for Roemer, but it's also been an affirmation of his talent and efforts.\n\n\"It's not been just a one-time thing,\" he said. \"It surprised me actually that I could make the cut, consistently, out of all the tens of thousands of people that submitted things from Hollywood and all over the country.\"\n\nRoemer says he resorted to editing to pay the bills, but he continues to work on his own short films and feature films on the side.\n\nRoemer now has a job editing for internet television and digital cable network Discovery Digital. After his boss moved from California to Tennessee, Roemer said he realized there was no reason for him to stay in Los Angeles, where the cost of living is high, when he could telecommute. Meanwhile, he felt he was being drawn home.\n\n\"I wanted to invest myself in a smaller town,\" Roemer said. \"There's been studies about happiness and one thing that makes people happy is community, and when a community is working together to make something happen.\"\n\nRoemer hopes to help foster a film community in Mansfield, starting with his class at the art center.\n\n\"It's been fun since I've been back because I feel like I've been embraced and I'm a part of the arts community,\" Roemer said. \"There's a pretty big scene here and some very talented people. There's no shortage of talented people here in comparison to Los Angeles.\"\n\ncmcnaull@gannett.com\n\n419-521-7220\n\nTwitter: @courtneymcnaull"
