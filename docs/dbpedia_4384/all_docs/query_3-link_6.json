        "text": "Mark Urman, a distributor who championed independent films and documentaries, helping movies that might have faded into obscurity reach audiences and win major awards, died on Saturday in Newark. He was 66.\n\nHis wife, the writer Deborah Davis, said that the cause was respiratory failure and that Mr. Urman had recently learned he had bone cancer.\n\nMr. Urman was an important part of two distribution companies that focused on independent films: ThinkFilm, which was founded in 2001 and essentially shuttered in 2008, and Paladin, which he founded in 2009.\n\nA distributorâ€™s job is to market movies and place them in theaters. What distinguished Mr. Urman was his devotion to independent movies that can hardly compete with Hollywood blockbusters; he had to persuade moviegoers and theater owners to choose films with subjects that were unfamiliar and, at times, seemingly unappealing.\n\nThe challenges facing independent distributors have become more pronounced in recent years as the number of small films produced annually has spiked and the number of distributors to place them has declined.\n\nWith more independent movies vying to be shown in the same number of art-house theaters, they are getting less screen time, making it much harder for them to develop an audience through word of mouth or critical acclaim.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
