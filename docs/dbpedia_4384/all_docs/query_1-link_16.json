        "text": "[Muni's] performance, on the whole, is a typical Muni performance -- being vigorous, simple, unaffected and believable. He is one of those rare actors whose talents don't seem to be thrown pell-mell into the very teeth of the camera.\n\nFull Review | Sep 20, 2019\n\nIf you can forget some of the details (like Soledad Jim√©nez being the only authentic Hispanic person in the film), you will leave this film satisfied. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Sep 20, 2019\n\nBeautifully shot by Tony Gaudio, well acted, grippingly directed, the film makes acutely acerbic points about privilege and prejudice; but typically of Warners in its social conscience mode, settles in the end for the status quo.\n\nFull Review | Sep 20, 2019\n\n\"Bordertown\" otherwise manages to impale the spectator's attention before the picturesque and somewhat hysterical materials of the story.\n\nFull Review | Sep 16, 2019\n\nFinish is phoney, but it can't hurt the previous good work. Casting throughout the film, which is also well written [from a novel by Carrol Graham] and paced, is exceptionally good.\n\nFull Review | Sep 16, 2019\n\nThe role of Johnny is one of those tense, slightly overwrought characterizations in which Paul Muni excels.\n\nFull Review | Aug 6, 2019\n\nNoteworthy for another of Bette Davis' portrayals of a pathological hussy. She steals the picture away from Paul Muni.\n\nFull Review | Jun 7, 2019"
