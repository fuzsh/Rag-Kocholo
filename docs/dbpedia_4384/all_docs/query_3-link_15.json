Robert Koehler of Variety wrote: \" Interplay between a jaunty Freeman as an unemployed movie star and the magnetic Paz Vega as a no-nonsense grocery store checker gives pic humanity and lift.\"\n\nCritical reaction to the film was mixed, with general praise for the work of the two main actors. On Rotten Tomatoes the film had a 63% approval rating based on 60 reviews.
