        "text": "Canuck distrib Entertainment One will handle ThinkFilm pics in Canada via its Seville Pictures through 2010.\n\nThe formerly Canadian-owned ThinkFilm had to find a local distributor after it was purchased by Los Angeles entrepreneur David Bergstein’s CapCo Group in October 2006.\n\nUnder Canadian law, a foreign-owned company can’t distribute pics in the country. The only exceptions are the Hollywood majors, who operate under a grandfather clause.\n\n“This (deal) has taken longer than we thought it would,” said ThinkFilm CEO Jeff Sackman. “Timing in life is everything, and had we done this a year ago, there wouldn’t have been an Entertainment One to make a deal with.”\n\nEntertainment One morphed from a DVD distributor into a theatrical distrib last summer.\n\nSackman said the deal will change little for his company because 90% of its business is in the U.S.\n\nEntertainment One has also acquired ThinkFilm’s library of 235 films, upping its own library to more than 700 titles.\n\nThe move turns Entertainment One into a major force in Canada, following its acquisition last summer of Montreal-based Seville.\n\nIt also has an output deal with Summit Entertainment and the Yari Film Group.\n\nSeville recently announced that it was pooling its resources with Robert Lantos’ Maximum Films to jointly distribute their pics in Canada.\n\nSeville co-president David Reckziegel said the ThinkFilm pics will increase its Canadian theatrical slate to more than 50 films per year.\n\nSlate includes Paul Schrader’s “The Walker”; “The Air That I Breathe,” with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Kevin Bacon; “Nanking”; and the documentary “Taxi to the Dark Side.”"
