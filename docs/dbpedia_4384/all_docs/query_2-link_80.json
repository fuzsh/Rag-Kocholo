        "text": "Shortbus, a controversial film in which actors engage in actual sex, has garnered a commercial release in North America through Canadian distributor ThinkFilm.\n\nThinkFilm says it will launch the art-house production this fall, bringing the drama to specialty theatres across the continent.The distributor has a reputation for edgy films, includingon its roster The Aristocrats and documentaries such as Murderball and the Oscar-winning Born into Brothels.\n\nThe $2-million film, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell and co-starring CBCradio hostSook-Yin Lee, caused ripples at its premiere at the Cannes film festival a few weeks ago, where audiences expressed enthusiastic appreciationafter screenings. The sexually explicit film is unrated.\n\n\"We were all impressed with how natural and normal and comedic the extreme sex became without being offensive,\" Mark Urman of ThinkFilm told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nShortbus is largely improvised and explores the lives of seven straight and gay New Yorkers seeking emotional connections with each other. Mitchell made his feature directing debut in the cult smash Hedwig and the Angry Inch, about a transsexual punk rocker.\n\nMitchell has said that his film is a kind of \"call to arms\" because so many people in the U.S. feel powerless: \"We couldn't get Bush out in 2004, so a lot of people put their ideas into their artistic work.\"\n\nReports from the Cannes festival said one distributor bowed out of the bidding process, citing the likelihood ofproblems releasing the film in video stores. But Mitchell remained optimistic, saying he had 11 other offers on the table.\n\nThe director says ThinkFilm offered the best deal, but Mitchell declined to divulge details of the agreement.\n\n\"We pursued Shortbus aggressively from the moment we saw it in Cannes and witnessed the audience's overwhelming response,\" said ThinkFilm president Jeff Sackman in a statement."
