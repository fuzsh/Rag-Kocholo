LOS ANGELES — In two weeks, the feisty operatives of an ever tighter, tougher independent film business will gather at the annual Sundance Film Festival.

Perhaps the toughest of the lot are the survivors of ThinkFilm.

ThinkFilm, a small, short-lived movie distributor, briefly took the indie world by storm with provocative fare like “Half Nelson,” about a drug-addicted high school teacher, and “Taxi to the Dark Side,” a documentary about the use of torture in the American war on terror.

When it closed most operations in 2008, as financial carnage hit the independent film business, it seemed destined to become just another relic of the art-house movement.

Yet ThinkFilm’s influence lives on. Its alumni have become a force in an industry that has been learning to think smaller, make do with less and live more by wit than a fat bankroll.

Nearly a dozen companies, many of which will be wheeling and dealing at Sundance, are rooted in the diaspora created by ThinkFilm’s demise. Some, like Long Shot Factory, are in the vanguard of a digitally sophisticated do-it-yourself movement. Others, like Tajj Media, run by a co-founder of ThinkFilm, Jeff Sackman, have narrowed their focus to an audience segment or business niche; Tajj Media, for instance, helps filmmakers find government subsidies.

These companies’ vigor underscores the maturing of the independent film business. Once populated by young film school graduates turning out productions on the fly, the industry now includes experienced filmmakers and entrepreneurs. As Sundance turns 30, it is these survivors who are forming the backbone of a more seasoned indie community.
