ABOUT

High School Musical was released by Disney in early 2006 as the first installment of a triology that was described as a modern day Romeo & Juliet. At the time of it's release, it became Disney Channel's most successful Original Movie with its soundtrack becoming the best-selling album in the United States that year. The story follows opposites Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) who, despite coming from very different places (Troy is the head of the basketball team and Gabriella loves math and science), end up trying out for and landing the lead roles in their high school's musical during their junior year. As a result of this unlikely match, the school divides. The basketball players plot a way to get Troy's focus back on the team, while the scholastic decathlon team tries to pull Gabriella back to her studies. The boys realize their mistake in trying to stop Troy from doing something he's passionate about, and Troy and Gabby make up in time to audition. They're named the leads in the upcoming play and each win their respective competitions, and the whole school comes back together again!

A DVD of the film was released later that year, selling 1.2 million copies in the first six days. Disney followed High School Musical's phenomenal success with two sequels (High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year), plus spin-off movies in Argentina and Brazil, and a straight-to-DVD spin-off starring Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay Evans. Disney has also launched a concert tour, stage musical, ice tour, book series, video games and even a reality series all based on the movie. The original movie and soundtrack won two Billboard Music Award for Soundtrack Album of the Year, two Emmy Awards, two Teen Choice Awards, a Television Critics Associate Award, an American Music Award for Best Pop Album, and has been nominated for countless other awards.
