To but tickets on line go to: http://www.thisistheatre.com/regional/high-school-musical.HTML.\n\nAre there going to be a high school musical 5?\n\nYes there will be a high school musical 5 HSM4 is already in the works with the new \"sophmore\" cast that is being introduced in High School musical 3. The next 2 will highlight some of the primary characters as they grow up and go to college and the like (like will Sharpay and Troy go to the same college- and he ditch Gabriella for Sharpay?) but the other movies will focus on the three new characters that are being introduced in HSM 3 HSM 4 is rumored to have a Miley Cyrus role in it as well.\n\nAre any of the cast members of High School Musical of the Mormon Religion?\n\nI do not know that any of the main cast members are, but several of the extras and support cast were, as the High School Musical movies were filmed in Salt Lake City and St. George, Utah. I do personally know some background dancers and extras from the movies who are members of the church."
