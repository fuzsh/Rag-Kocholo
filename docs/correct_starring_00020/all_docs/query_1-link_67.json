        "text": "Actress and singer Ashley Tisdale is pregnant with her first child.\n\nTisdale, 35, a native of Ocean Township, is known for starring in the “High School Musical” movies for TV and film.\n\nShe made the announcement Thursday by posting photos on Instagram in which she posed with her husband, TV and film composer Christopher French. The couple married in 2014.\n\nTisdale, the subject of an episode of the Disney Plus series “Becoming\" airing Friday, Sept. 18, was discovered at the mall as a child. She booked her first commercial for J.C. Penney. She played Maddie Fitzpatrick in the Disney Channel series “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” and went on to play Sharpay Evans in “High School Musical.” The first film debuted on the Disney Channel in 2006 and was followed by “High School Musical 2” in 2007 and “High School Musical 3” in 2008.\n\nThe actress voiced the title character in “Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch” on Discovery Family in 2013 and play Jenny Kenney in “Carol’s Second Act” on CBS, which wrapped in March. She had released three albums: “Headstrong” (2007), “Guilty Pleasure” (2009) and “Symptoms” (2019).\n\nTisdale’s “High School Musical” co-star Vanessa Hudgens congratulated the couple on Instagram.\n\n“Just the freaking cutest,” she said. ““So so happy for u guyssssss.”\n\nFormer “Glee” star Lea Michele, who grew up in Tenafly and just welcomed her first baby in August, also offered her well wishes.\n\n“So happy for you babe!” she said. “You’re going to be the best mama!”\n\n“Six years,” French said in a recent Instagram post marking the couple’s anniversary. “There are so many moments, so many tiny fragile little moments that I can look at specifically. Amazing, beautiful bright ones and hard, cloudy difficult ones... we just keep getting closer. I really can’t imagine life without you @ashleytisdale. I love you endlessly, Happy Anniversary.\"\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust. Please consider supporting NJ.com with a subscription."
