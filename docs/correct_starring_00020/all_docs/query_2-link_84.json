Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nBasketball talent and high school musical star, Troy (Zac Efron), manages to get himself, his girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens), and all of their friends from East High School a summer job at the local country club so they can save up for college and also enjoy the summer together. One major problem is that the country club is owned by Sharpay's (Ashley Tisdale) parents, and Sharpay has only one thing in mind: she wants handsome and talented Troy for herself, and she is not afraid to use tricks and bribery to get what she wants. Will Troy lose track of his values and betray his friends and his true self?\n\nMusical; comedy; teenage romance; coming of age; friendship; jealousy; teamwork; competition; staying true to oneself.\n\nThere is no violence in this movie.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nThere are no scenes in this movie that are likely to scare or disturb children in this age group.\n\nThere are no scenes in this movie that are likely to scare or disturb children in this age group.\n\nNothing of concern.\n\nProduct placement\n\nNone noted.\n\nSexual references\n\nNone noted.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere is some nudity and sexual activity in this movie, including:\n\nSome female characters are seen in cleavage-revealing clothes.\n\nTroy is seen topless on several occasions.\n\nThere is some teenage romance, expressed in hand-holding and hugs.\n\nUse of substances\n\nNone noted.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language in this movie, including:\n\n“Jerk!”\n\nSharpay is frequently shouting and yelling at people in a very rude manner.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nHigh School Musical 2 is the sequel of the popular High School Musical and features many of the original cast. Like the first film, this musical movie is directed at a tween audience with a love for music, choreographed dance, and teenage romance. While the film contains positive messages of friendship, parents should be aware that some of the characters are very stereotypical, such as Sharpay, portraying the cliché of the superficial, manipulative, spoilt, peroxide-blonde rich girl, complete with pink outfits, glittery accessories, a lap dog, and an entourage of giggling, airheaded girlfriends, to name only a few examples.\n\nThe main messages from this movie are that one should stay true to oneself, and that mean and manipulative behaviour will not pay off in the long run.\n\nValues in this movie that parents may wish to reinforce with their children include:\n\nFriendship.\n\nLoyalty.\n\nStanding up for oneself.\n\nKeeping promises.\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss with their children attitudes and behaviours, and their real-life consequences, such as:"
