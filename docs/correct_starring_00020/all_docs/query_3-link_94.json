        "text": "The High School Musical films are my absolute favourite films to watch ever because they are so fun and entertaining. I Don't Dance, What Time Is It and All For One were my favourite songs because of how exciting, fun and entertaining they were. My favourite part was definitely when Gabriella told Sharpay what she really thought that Sharpay was doing to her summer because it proves that being honest is the best way to be. Vanessa Hudgens the actress playing Gabriella Montez was my favourite because of how energetic and enthusiastic she was when she was singing, dancing and acting. My recommendation for this film would go to people and love to watch musicals.\n\nPrint this review"
