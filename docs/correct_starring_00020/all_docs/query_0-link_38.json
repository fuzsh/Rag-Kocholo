The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nNeither have managed to be as good as until dawn.\n\nJudging by the comments in this thread, have neither of the other two games in the anthology been good? The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nHaven't played Little Hope yet, but Man of Medan was fairly disappointing. It felt like it tried too hard to be clever with the premise, but I realized what was going on about two minutes into the main location. It didn't help that the actual premise was a major letdown.\n\nPlus, it didn't have the same magic with the characters as Until Dawn. Nothing lived up to Michael.\n\nJudging by the comments in this thread, have neither of the other two games in the anthology been good? The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nI've only played Man of Medan but it was like Until Dawn without any self-awareness.\n\nJudging by the comments in this thread, have neither of the other two games in the anthology been good? The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nMan of Medan was a fun jaunt with friends.\n\nAll the characters are very unlikeable though.\n\nI kept hearing that the games are not that good due to budget issues, is hiring a \"known\" actor for VA really a good use of the little they have? maybe im just overestimating the costs of getting Tisdale on board though\n\nI kept hearing that the games are not that good due to budget issues, is hiring a \"known\" actor for VA really a good use of the little they have? maybe im just overestimating the costs of getting Tisdale on board though\n\nHaving good performances is really important for a game like this though, so I don't think it's a bad use of their budget.\n\nAnd the games have been perfectly enjoyable so far If you don't go in expecting something as meaty as Until Dawn.\n\nI kept hearing that the games are not that good due to budget issues, is hiring a \"known\" actor for VA really a good use of the little they have? maybe im just overestimating the costs of getting Tisdale on board though\n\nI'm not sure if it's so much a budget issue as it is that the writing/story of both games so far simply aren't nearly as good as Until Dawn's\n\nGraphically, they're all really good. They just simply just need better writing\n\nJudging by the comments in this thread, have neither of the other two games in the anthology been good? The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nThey aren't as good as Until Dawn but they aren't terrible either. I would say they are 6/10, maybe 7/10 games, depending on how much you like these types of games.\n\nThey are also smaller, budget priced games compared to Until Dawn.\n\nLooks cool!\n\nJudging by the comments in this thread, have neither of the other two games in the anthology been good? The idea of the anthology was interesting to me but I haven't played either of the first two yet\n\nI liked them both a lot, with the slight edge going to Little Hope. Give them a shot, Man of Medan has to be super cheap I would think.\n\nYou played Until Dawn right?\n\nPress release with some additional details (via IGN):\n\n\"Iraq, 2003,\" a press release for House of Ashes reads. \"As the conflict draws to a close, CIA field operative Rachel King joins an elite military unit on a raid of a suspected underground chemical weapons facility in the shadow of the Zagros Mountains.\"\n\nOnce King and her unit arrive at the coordinates, they're ambushed by a local patrol led by Sergeant Salim Othman. An earthquake opens sinkholes in the ground during their ensuing firefight and both sides of the fight are tossed into the ruins of a buried Sumerian temple. In the darkness beneath the Arabian Desert, something evil is awakened, the press release reads, and ancient, unstoppable creatures begin their hunt.\n\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes Is a Horror Game Set in the Iraq War - IGN\n\nThe next game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, House of Ashes, is a game set during the Iraq War and it's coming next year.\n\nSounds cool, the teaser at the end of Little Hope gave me The Descent in the desert vibes."
