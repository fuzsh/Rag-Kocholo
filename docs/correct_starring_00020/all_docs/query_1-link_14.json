        "text": "Can you believe that Ashley Tisdale's husband of five years, Christopher French, has never seen her star-making turn as Sharpay Evans in the Disney Channel Original Movie classic High School Musical and its sequels? Well, it was true, but not anymore!\n\nAs noted by E! News, Ashley documented Christopher's first viewing of High School Musical 2. A bold move, starting on the second film of the series, but OK. We're here for it. \"Does anybody know what this is?\" Ashley posted on Instagram Stories re: their viewing. \"Because I'm subjecting my husband to watch it. He's never seen any of them.\" Honestly, we're still shocked her husband of five (!!) years hasn't seen any of Ashley's DCOM work, because Sharpay is definitely the star of the whole series, especially in hindsight.\n\nThat being said, it looks like Christopher isn't under Sharpay's spell. Ashley asked him if he would have dated her during that period, and they both laughed. \"Sharpay not your type babe?\" Ashley captioned the IG Story post. Christopher also revealed that he probably wouldn't have watched the HSM movies when he was younger; perhaps he was more of a Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century or Motorcrossed guy.\n\nWhile Ashley may be far from her HSM days, that doesn't mean she doesn't think about Sharpay from time to time. Back in late 2018, when asked what Sharpay would be doing these days, Ashley had a great answer. \"Probably on Broadway somewhere,\" she said. However, that doesn't mean Ashley's eager to return to the role, even on the new Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. “I’ve matured so much,” she explained at the time. “I just don’t know if I can give her justice ... and be that character again.” Her High School Musical days may be behind her, but Sharpay is always just a stream away, should Ashley and Christopher want to revisit East High."
