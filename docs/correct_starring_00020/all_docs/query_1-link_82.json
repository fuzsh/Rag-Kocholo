        "text": "Anyone who thought the last time Ashley Tisdale and Vanessa Hudgens would sing together was in their High School Musical days was totally wrong. The former Disney Channel actresses are actually best friends IRL and still hang out all the time to this day. Back in September, Ashley revealed that the besties would soon be working together – and lucky for us HSM fans, that day has finally arrived.\n\nAshley invited her bestie Vanessa to sing with her on her YouTube channel, and the two collaborated on an amazing rendition of Elle King's hit song \"Ex's and Oh's.\" Ashley announced the cover on Instagram with a gorgeous photo of the duo with the caption, \"Link in Bio ☝?.\"\n\nIt seriously warms our hearts that these two are still singing together after all of these years. Trust us when we say Ashley and Vanessa's cover will seriously blow you away. Who knows, if you're anything like us it may even bring a tear to your eye.\n\nWE'RE SHOOK. And now that we've been hit with all the High School Musical nostalgia – we think it's safe to say Ashley and Vanessa need to start singing duets more often. Their voices seriously complement each other so incredibly well.\n\nMORE: ASHLEY TISDALE SHARES THE MOST EPIC THROWBACK PHOTO OF HER AND VANESSA HUDGENS\n\nClick through the gallery to see Ashley and Vanessa's cutest moments.
