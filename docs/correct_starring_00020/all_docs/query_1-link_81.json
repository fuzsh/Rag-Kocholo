        "text": "Zac Efron starred as Troy Bolton, the most popular guy at East High, equally talented at singing and playing basketball. Troy fell in love with Gabriella after meeting her at a ski resort and reluctantly being paired up for karaoke.\n\nIt’s unclear when Efron and co-star Vanessa Hudgens began dating in real life, but they split in 2010.\n\nEfron has a YouTube channel, where he posts fitness and travel videos, too. His love for adventure led to a Netflix travel series titled Down to Earth With Zac Efron, which debuted on the streaming platform in 2020. The show returned for a second season in November 2022.\n\n2. Vanessa Hudgens\n\nGabriella Montez was portrayed by Vanessa Hudgens. Gabriella was one of the smartest students in her class. She was shy, but showcased her fun side whenever she took the stage for a performance.\n\nIn recent years, Hudgens starred alongside Andrew Garfield in the autobiographical musical Tick, Tick … Boom!\n\nOutside of her film roles, Hudgens relaunched her skincare brand Know Beauty, in March 2023.\n\n3. Ashley Tisdale\n\nAshley Tisdale played mean girl Sharpay Evans. Sharpay loved attention, and didn’t appreciate people who were also gifted performers.\n\nTisdale tied the knot with musician Christopher French in 2014 and they welcomed a daughter named Jupiter Iris French in March 2021.\n\nTisdale branched into beauty with the creation of Illuminate Cosmetics in 2016. She also launched the wellness blog Frenshe, which led to the development of a personal care brand called Being Frenshe.\n\nShe reprised her role as Candace in the 2020 animated film Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe and voiced a character in Baby Shark’s Big Movie!\n\n4. Lucas Grabeel\n\nLucas Grabeel played Sharpay’s brother, Ryan Evans.\n\nHe was constantly forced to participate in schemes with his fraternal sister. But Chad Danforth, Troy’s best friend, gained a new-found sense of respect for Ryan after they danced to a baseball-themed routine in the sequel.\n\nAfter HSM, Grabeel went on to voice characters on popular TV shows. He was also part of a folk-rock band called Midnight Holler.\n\nWhen Grabeel teamed up with Tisdale in 2017 to sing “What I’ve Been Looking For” (popularised by the first HSM film) the former co-stars revealed a surprising detail about their relationship.\n\nGrabeel said that they “didn’t get off on the best foot”, but nowadays they love each other.\n\nGrabeel is also good friends with Hudgens and attended her wedding in December, along with HSM co-star Monique Coleman.\n\n5. Corbin Bleu\n\nTroy’s wingman, Chad Danforth, was played by Corbin Bleu.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Bleu revealed that he actually came up with the creative and fun catchphrases that were written on Chad’s shirts.\n\nSince HSM, he starred in productions of In the Heights, Godspell and Holiday Inn. Bleu returned to Broadway in a 2019 revival of Kiss Me, Kate!\n\nThe actor was also the runner-up on season 17 of ABC’s Dancing with the Stars and released two albums.\n\nHe guest-starred on episodes of Castle, The Good Wife, The Fosters, Chicago Med and Supergirl.\n\nBleu reprised his HSM role for season three of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series and returned for the season four premiere in August 2023.\n\nBleu has been married to actor Sasha Clements since 2016.\n\n6. Monique Coleman\n\nMonique Coleman starred as Taylor McKessie, the leader of East High’s scholastic decathlon team and selected as the activities coordinator at Lava Springs.\n\nAside from her Instagram being filled with inspirational messages, Coleman was named the United Nations’ first-ever Youth Champion for her efforts to improve the lives of young people.\n\nIn her personal life, she got married to Walter Jordan in 2012, lived in New York, and “recognised that I still want to make sure to achieve the dreams that I have as an artist”.\n\nMore recently, Coleman joined Grabeel and Bleu for the season four premiere of HSMTMTS. She and Bleu also co-starred in the 2021 holiday film A Christmas Dance Reunion.\n\n7. Olesya Rulin\n\nSongwriter and pianist Kelsi Nielsen was played by Olesya Rulin. She wrote the song “You are the Music in Me” for Troy and Gabriella.\n\nLater, she appeared on shows like Seal Team, The Night Shift, NCIS: Los Angeles and The Mentalist.\n\nShe’s close with Coleman and once thanked her for “cheering me on and making me see my own potential. All while helping young people around the world achieve their dreams”.\n\nRulin married Joseph Pauline in November 2021 and the couple welcomed their first child together, Ondine Michelle Pauline, in August 2022."
