        "text": "Two High School Musical babies are on the way, and Ashley Tisdale couldn't be more excited.\n\nOn Monday, the actress, 38, took part in a Q&A via Instagram Stories where she shared how thrilled she is to be pregnant at the same time as her HSM co-star, Vanessa Hudgens, 35. Tisdale is expecting her second baby with husband Christopher French while Hudgens is expecting her first child with Los Angeles Angels player Cole Tucker.\n\n\"How cool is it that you and Vanessa are having babies at the same time?!,\" the question read, to which Tisdale replied with a red heart emoji and writing, \"It's very cool! I'm so excited for her and this new chapter in her life.\"\n\nTisdale and Hudgens starred alongside each other as frenemies in Disney's High School Musical trilogy from 2006 to 2008. Hudgens played Gabriella Montez while The Suite Life of Zack & Cody alum played the role of Sharpay Evans.\n\nTisdale's happy sentiment comes not long after she addressed feud rumors between her and Hudgens.\n\nWhen asked, \"Basically, people want to know what's going on with you and Vanessa. Do you guys hang out?\" on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in March, Tisdale didn't directly confirm or deny a rift with her longtime pal.\n\n\"I haven't seen her in a long time,\" she shared. \"I think, obviously, she's working. I'm working. I have a daughter. So she has a full-time job.\"\n\nWhen Hudgens tied the knot with Tucker in Tulum, Mexico, in December, she received support from several of her East High Wildcats, including HSM co-stars Monique Coleman, who portrayed brainiac bestie Taylor McKessie, and Lucas Grabeel, who played drama king Ryan Evans. But Tisdale was noticeably absent from the wedding and bachelorette party.\n\nOne common link the co-stars have is Hudgens' ex, Austin Butler, who co-starred with distant cousin Tisdale in the 2011 film, Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure.\n\nIn the Q&A, Tisdale also answered questions about her pregnancy and 3-year-old daughter, Jupiter.\n\n\"It's a lot harder, I would say,\" she said of this pregnancy compared to her first. \"I popped faster and I had crazy, crazy fatigue and nausea in the first trimester. It was brutal. I don't remember that, I would remember that, and I don't remember that with Jupiter. So that by farâ€¦ it was like three months of just being sick. Physically, it's just been a lot harder.\"\n\nBut Tisdale had a serious response to the question, \"Would you ever put Jupiter into acting?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not. No,\" she answered without further explanation."
