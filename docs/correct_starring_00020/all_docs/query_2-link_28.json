        "text": "Great movie right?\n\nThey really stepped it up on the music this time around, I mean.. dang... Troy's solo. AMAZING, practically stole the show for me. I can't even pick a favorite song from this movie.\n\nCome on, I know other people are closet fans of this great franchise.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, I'm 19 and I have the DVD's, albums, I know all the words to the songs on the first movie and the dances too. I know I'm a loser, now let's discuss this movie.\n\nSeriously, if you don't like this movie, it either means:\n\na.) You're too \"cool\" and \"grown up\" for it.... [image]\n\nOR\n\nb.) You just didn't watch it. [image]\n\nGive it a chance and keep an open mind while watching it. You'll get sucked in. Especially in this sequel, it hits closer to home this time around for you high schoolers. I don't suggest skipping High School Musical 1 though, you NEED to watch them in order. It's only proper.\n\nHell, even give the soundtracks a chance.\n\nWe need more musicals in our life. That's something that's missing from the entertainment business, but it's slowly coming back thankfully. (ie: Hairspray) Which I still want to see soon.\n\nI saw the first one. I really don't understand what all the hype was about. This movie was just as bad as all the other trash they title \"Disney Channel Original Movie\".\n\nThe only difference was the singing kids, who sounded way too much like N Sync for me to respect them.\n\nBut hey, a lot of people liked it. I respect your opinion and hope that you like the inevitable third one and television series that will spawn from this franchise.\n\nJust know that I wont\n\nHigh School Musical is a disgrace to all that is musical theater.\n\nDon't watch the first one. It'll make you make you want to cut your ears off, and then jam them into your eye sockets.\n\nIf you DO watch it, watch it as a Disney movie with songs, rather than an actual musical. Because it's not a musical. It's basically a live action disney cartoon. With poppy voices and hateful riffs.\n\nOn another note:\n\nHigh School Musical 2 was filmed in St. George, UT-- which is where I live. A few of my friends are extras. But yeah. When you're watching it, just remember that Xsyven is there.\n\nI actually like some of the songs and actors. I'll even admit I liked to sing to some of them (though not all the time). I'm not really obsessing over them. The movies themselves are okay in my opinion. They could've done better. I'm not going to bash them for trying to make something good while having fun making it at the same time.\n\nSeriously if I could try out for the eventual third one, I might just for the experience. That's probably not going to happen though. Referring to one part of demoncaterpie's post, I also really doubt there will be a tv show based off of it because it would be a really bad idea and I just don't see how they can make a musical tv series >_>.\n\nOut of all the characters in the movie, Ryan (played by Lucas Grabeel) is probably my favorite. He's probably the funniest dancer in the first, and had the most development as a character between the two. The others just seem a lot more flat and don't have as much development.\n\nIt's spelled Créme Brulée. I honestly didn't see the whole movie because Friday night, I took a whole hour to drive home during the movie. Saturday, I was at my little brother's friend's house playing with the Nintendo Wii because I didn't have one. Hopefully I can see it today and form an opinion. It just depends on if my mom makes me do more errands and stuff tonight.\n\nRyan is Sharpay's brother.\n\nWe need more musicals in our life. That's something that's missing from the entertainment business, but it's slowly coming back thankfully. (ie: Hairspray) Which I still want to see soon.\n\nSo, I'm watching this right now.\n\nDon't call it a musical. Because it's not.\n\nIf you want to watch a real musical, watch Les Miserables, Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd, Wicked, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Josesph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Children of Eden, Aida, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Honk, My Fair Lady, ANYTHING.\n\nThis show, as a musical, has no redeeming qualities. No jaw dropping scores, no tear jerking moments, no chills, no amazing vocals, etc.\n\nThe only thing thats impressive is the dancing.\n\nI'm completely serious. If you watch this, don't expect a good musical. It's a glorified Disney channel original with cheezy dialoge, bad acting, and nasally singing. I can't say it enough. It's not a good musical.\n\nDibs said:\n\nSeriously, if you don't like this movie, it either means:\n\na.) You're too \"cool\" and \"grown up\" for it.... [image]\n\nOR\n\nb.) You just didn't watch it. [image]\n\nc.) It sucks.\n\nI don't consider myself a \"grown up\". I'm a smart guy, but I'm not a fan of acting like it. I'm not too \"cool\" either, seeing that I'm a theater major. (That changes once I find a real career goal, though.)\n\n[/ramble]\n\nOh. my. Gawd.\n\nI'm totally in love with Lucas Grabeel. I don't know if I'd rather be him or date him though...either way, I need to buy more hats.\n\nDid anyone else see the thinly veiled flirtation between Chad and Ryan during 'I Don't Dance'?\n\nAnd I think fleshing out the character of Ryan is an incredible step for Disney in the field of gay representation, especially in children's programming. This kind of icon could be a step in breaking down heterosexism in future generations. Perhaps a boyfriend for Ryan in HSM3? We can only hope. <3\n\nNo offense, but I hate High School Musical all the way down to my deepest being. In my opnion, making a second movie is just dragging it out too long, and they did it only because young girls who dream of 'growing up' like it so much. But I dunno, maybe it just appeals to some people more than it does to me. Maybe the cheesy lines and stupid acting were just too much for me.\n\nAll I can say is Olesya Rulin (Kelsi in the movies) FTW. ^.^\n\nI can't really say whether I liked the music more in this one or in last one, but I know that \"You Are The Music In Me\" was my absolute favorite of them. It just is, doods.\n\nIf you want to watch a real musical, watch Les Miserables...\n\nDude, I saw that (my English class went to go watch it Sophomore year). It was frigging awesome. Javert and Eponine were the best characters in that musical (and the book, mind you), Javert because he's a freaking awesome cop and Eponine because \"On My Own\" was the best song to me in the musical. :bigthumbu"
