        "text": "Ashley Tisdale called all East High Wildcats to join her in the perfect quarantine-motto-turned-dance-move amid the coronavirus crisis when she revived High School Musical‘s final number “We’re All in This Together.”\n\n“If you need to work out while on #selfquarantine try this,” she encouraged her 12 million Instagram followers. “Hopefully this will brighten your day a little!”\n\nA handful of people remembered pumping up their fists, clapping their hands above their head and throwing up jazz hands, including Vanessa Hudgens, Bart Johnson, KayCee Stroh and director Kenny Ortega.\n\nHudgens didn’t leave her HSM co-star hanging when she posed their videos side-by-side, except the actress behind co-lead Gabriella Montez broke free from the original choreography by pouring a bottle of red wine to the beat of the film’s popular anthem. Though Tisdale commented she wished the 31-year-old star did the actual dance alongside her, Johnson called Hudgens’ version “outstanding” before hopping on the bandwagon.\n\nThe 49-year-old actor took back his Coach Jack Bolton role for “Sharpay Cardio” when he posted his own duet-style dance clip with Tisdale’s original video. “This ones for my WILDCATS!” he instructed via Instagram. “Day 2 of Quarantine LOCK DOWN but you know coach gotta hit the cardio/swool program and remind ALL HUMANS ON PLANET EARTH that ‘We are ALL in this together’!!”\n\nOrtega reposted Tisdale’s throwback moves for his seal of approval. “I’m definitely joining Ashley in her in home cartio #hsm choreography work out,” the filmmaker wrote on Instagram. “Lookin gooood @ashleytisdale #wereallinthistogether.”\n\nHis post motivated Stroh, who played bookworm-turned-break dancer Martha Cox, to get her head in the game and bring back her character’s fierce footwork with the help of her two young daughters Zetta Lee and Lettie Louise serving as “baby wildcats.”\n\nWatch Tisdale and the rest of the Wildcats dance like it’s 2006."
