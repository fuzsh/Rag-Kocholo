        "text": "The music video has more than 35 million views\n\n17 years after the release of High School Musical 2, Zac Efron has revealed a secret about a scene in the iconic film, where he stars as Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.\n\nThe film is the sequel to the hugely popular High School Musical, released in 2006, where the actor didn't sing. However, things were very different for the two sequels, where Zac performed the numbers throughout, including 'Bet On It'.\n\nSpeaking to YouTube channel Still Watching Netflix, Zac explained how the choreography for the scene of 'Bet On It', which takes place on a golf course, was completely improvised, after the director said he had no concept for the scene.\n\n\"That was all improv. And we shot it, I think the whole song, in like three hours,\" Zac explained.\n\nHe continued: \"When we shot that, we just had no ideas for what to do on the day. The director, he was like, 'Dude, we have no concept for this song. What do you want to do?' I was like, 'I don't know, we're on a golf course'.\"\n\nZac appeared in all three High School Musical films, released in 2006, 2007 and 2008, however since the last film, there have been several rumours that there could be a reunion on the way.\n\nHigh School Musical skyrocketed the careers of the likes of Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale, and since the last film, fans have been sent into overdrive several times when Zac followed Vanessa on Instagram, and Zac, Vanessa and Kaycee Stroh all visited High School Musical's East High separately.\n\nIf you fancy a trip down memory lane you can always revisit all the High School Musical films which are now on Disney+.\n\nTake a look at Zac Efron's transformation through the years:\n\nNow read:\n\nZac Efron's complete transformation through the years\n\nHere's the real reason Zac Efron didn't sing in High School Musical\n\nWill there be a High School Musical reunion?
