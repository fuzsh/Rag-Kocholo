        "text": "We all know the first “High School Musical” was a hit from my first review, (if you have not watched it you should do that now,) so we might as well check out “High School Musical 2”! *Beware spoilers ahead.*\n\n“High School Musical 2” is the second movie musical that is about the East High Wildcats, except this time we see them outside of the school hallways. As all of the students start their summer, they each get hired at Lava Springs Country Club, owned by Sharpay and Ryan’s parents. Each year they host a talent show where the winner receives the Star Dazzle Award. While Sharpay is usually the winner, the wildcats create some good competition. Sharpay then begins to help Troy with his future basketball opportunities in order to put a wedge between his friends and his relationship with Gabriella. Since they just ended their junior year, and college and graduation plans edge closer, Troy and Gabriella question if their romance will last. Will they be able to balance college, music, extracurricular activities, a job, AND their relationship all summer ? Watch to find out!\n\nThe cast consists of the same unique people as the first such as: Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman. All of these actors did another job well-done as they portray their characters life and emotions. Just like the first film, I believe that Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel do not receive enough credit for portraying the “bad guys.” The second film, in my opinion, was better than the first because the cast became more developed and devoted to their roles.\n\nA few of my favorite scenes are when Sharpay sings “Fabulous,” as this describes her want for finer things, and to soak up the summer sun. Another is the dramatic, yet emotional, song performed by Troy and Gabriella called, “I Gotta Go My Own Way.” This occurs right at the climax where they think their relationship is going downhill. Will they rise above and stay together, or let life’s difficulties get in the way?\n\nThe overall theme and lesson to learn is that life is complicated and messy, but with the presence of your friends and family, everything will be okay. Times can be stressful, especially when you’re balancing so many things at one time; however, don’t let those things take yourself away from the love you have for the things you do and the people you care so much for. Overall, this is a great PG movie musical that I recommend to anyone who loves music, summer, and/or just needs some hope through all the stress and difficulties life in high school throws our way daily. This film I rate a 4.8 out of 5 stars."
