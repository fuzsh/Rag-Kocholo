        "text": "It’s December 1985 and Alyson Reed can see bright lights stretching out before her.\n\nAs Cassie, one of the leads in the movie version of “A Chorus Line,” doors in Hollywood are opening to her like never before in the decade since leaving home in Anaheim to hit the road to act and dance and sing.\n\nOne of the big talent agencies is planning to make her the new “It” girl. Producers are pitching her for leads in their projects. Johnny Carson wants her on “The Tonight Show.”\n\n“‘A Chorus Line’ was supposed to be, ‘Oh my God, it’s going to be huge!'” Reed explains, 22 years later, over lunch at Mexi-Casa restaurant, a down-home Mexican joint in Anaheim where she and her family have eaten for years.\n\nBut then the movie opened – first in New York City, where the musical version still ran on Broadway a decade after its debut, and then in Los Angeles. Then came the reviews (brutal). Then came a new reality.\n\n“Within a week, everything was canceled,” Reed says. “Carson canceled. All the movie offers. And my relationship of nine years was ending.”\n\nShe flew home to New York from the Los Angeles premiere, crying all the way, thinking, “Get me back to theater!”\n\nThere she would stay for the rest of the ’80s, regaining her confidence on the Broadway stage, rebuilding a career that would take her back to Los Angeles for the steady work on television series\n\nAnd then, 30 years after graduating from Anaheim High, Reed found her way back to high schools and musicals. And the curtain rose on a new act for her life.\n\n•\n\nBy the time Reed entered kindergarten, her mother, Elsie Reed, had taught her to read and write and do a little math.\n\n“My kindergarten teacher told my mother, ‘Get her into an outside activity, she’s going to be bored so fast!'”\n\nSo off to a Fullerton ballet studio they went. Reed remembers being so excited that she ran straight into a class already in session. And when the 4-year-old was gently ushered back out, she stood with her nose pressed to the window, watching in wonder.\n\nBy 7 she was performing in musicals at the Anaheim Parks and Recreation Department. And as the theater bug took hold, she began to appear in civic theater, from Fullerton to Laguna Beach. She loved the imaginary worlds she found on stage.\n\n“I think it was the make believe,” Reed says. “Even that first (ballet) teacher, she’d turn on the music and tell us, ‘You’re running up to a big palace! Knock, knock, knock on the door! No, knock like a princess!”\n\nWhen she was in the eighth grade, she played Alice from “Alice In Wonderland” in the Disneyland Christmas parade. “The next year, I’d grown too much, so they made me an ostrich,” Reed says, laughing.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1976 – and becoming the first girl to serve as student body president at Anaheim High – she briefly followed her father’s dream, that she go to college and study to become a computer programmer.\n\nBut just weeks after entering Fullerton Junior College, an opportunity popped up to audition for a TV pilot. And she jumped. It was a decision, she says, her father accepted only reluctantly.\n\n“Even eight years into it, with overlapping jobs, my dad said, ‘When are you going to go back to college? How are you going to have a career?’\n\n“And I said, ‘I don’t know, but I think I’m doing it’.”\n\n•\n\nSuccess – at least in terms of finding work – came early for Reed. At 20, she landed a plum role in the national touring production of “Pippin.” Two years later, she was touring in “A Chorus Line,” first playing Val, then Cassie.\n\nBut all the national tours wore her out, and after nine months with “Chorus Line,” she gave notice, a decision that earned her the wrath of co-creator and producer Michaell Bennett.\n\n“I told him, ‘I’m just fried, I want to go home,'” Reed says. “He said, ‘You’re never going to make it in this business.’ And so I did one of those 22-year-old things and said, ‘I’m going to come back in 10 years and prove you wrong!'”\n\nShe continued to work – including the title role in “Marilyn: An American Fable,” which earned her a Drama Desk nomination. Eventually, around the time Sir Richard Attenborough cast her opposite Michael Douglas in the film version of “Chorus Line,” she even made up with Bennett.\n\nAfter the reviewers trashed the movie, Reed retreated to New York City and the theater. She hit a new peak when she earned the 1987 Tony nomination for her work as Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of “Cabaret.”\n\nBy 1990, worn down by the Broadway grind of eight-shows-a-week, Reed relocated back to Los Angeles, launching herself into steady, if not starring, TV work. She says, laughing, that her turn as a killer on an episode of “Matlock” is her mother’s favorite role she’s done.\n\nBack in Hollywood, she settled into the workaday life of the character actor.\n\n“I call myself a blue-collar actor,” Reed says. “Stars are less than 1 percent of the union, and then ere are 30- to 40 percent of us who while you’ll never know our names, we work all the time.”\n\nAnd so it went, with guest spots or recurring roles on on shows from “Frasier” and “Party of Five” – where she played Jennifer Love Hewitt’s mom – to “Nip/Tuck” and “Eli Stone.”\n\nIt was a good living for an actor, and she’d have continued on that path if her agent hadn’t sent her to audition for what sounded like an after-school special on the Disney Channel.\n\n•••\n\nThe movie was “High School Musical,” and the role she won was that of Ms. Darbus, the drama teacher who, in the story, brings stars Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens together.\n\nDirector Kenny Ortega was an old friend (he’d directed Reed in “Marilyn”) and she quickly sensed the project was anything but an after-school special.\n\n“At the first table read, you could feel the mood change,” Reed says. “After, I went up to Kenny and said, ‘I think this is going to be this generation’s ‘Grease.’ And Kenny said, ‘You can feel it, can’t you?'”\n\nYou almost certainly know the story from here: “High School Musical” debuted in January 2006 and turned into a pop culture phenomenon. A sequel did just as well a year ago. And, on Friday, the franchise returns to theaters in the form of “High School Musical 3: Senior Year.”\n\nAs Ms. Darbus, Reed is featured prominently in all three as the eccentric drama teacher (a character that Reed says is based on a flamboyant English teacher she had at Brookhurst Junior High School in Anaheim) who takes her productions quite seriously indeed.\n\n“I’m so proud to be a part of something that has totally touched kids, and totally influenced them.”\n\nAs for what comes next, Reed hopes “High School Musical” might help her bump up a spot or two on the Hollywood pecking order\n\n“You might have a better shot at getting a series, or getting into a studio movie that you might not have been seen for before,” Reed says.\n\n“But again, the thing about being 50 (in Hollywood), you have to enjoy the ride.\n\n“You have a great time while you’re making it, and then you go back to your life. You call a friend and say, “You want to meet me at the diner tomorrow morning?’\n\n“And then you go out and try to get another job.”"
