        "text": "Birthday: December 14, 1988\n\nBirthplace: Salinas, California\n\nVanessa Hudgens has already captured the hearts of millions of fans (not to mention Zac Efron and Austin Butler). We're taking a look at this singer/actress!\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nVanessa Anne Hudgens' multi-racial family is made up of her Irish and Native American father Greg, her Filipino and Chinese mother Gina and her younger sister Stella, who is also an actress. When Vanessa was eight years old, she began acting in local theater. She appeared in such classic plays as Carousel, The King and I, and The Wizard of Oz.\n\nSmall Screen Success\n\nVanessa and her family moved to Los Angeles after she won a role in a television commercial. From there, Vanessa Hudgens landed roles on \"Still Standing,\" \"Quintuplets\" and \"Thunderbirds.\" She also snagged the role of Noel in the critically acclaimed teen movie Thirteen, alongside Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter. Little did she know that an unassuming TV movie was about to make her career.\n\nVanessa played the roles of both Stacey De Novo and Lady Margaret in The Princess Switch\n\nHigh School Hijinks\n\nAlthough Vanessa never went to high school herself (she was home schooled), her role as Gabriella Montez in High School Musical made her a household name. She has since reprised the role in High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year. She also launched her debut album, V, in September 2006, which sold more than 500,000 copies. Vanessa released her second studio album, Identified, in July 2008.\n\nVanessa as Gabriella with Zac Efron in High School Musical\n\nAfter High School\n\nFollowing the completion of the High School Musical series, Vanessa took a break from her music career to focus more on acting. Vanessa starred in the movies Bandslam, Beastly, Sucker Punch, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, alongside Dwayne Johnson and Josh Hutcherson, Spring Breakers, The Princess Switch, and Second Act. In 2016 Vanessa starred as Rizzo in Grease: Live!, FOX's live broadcast of the Broadway musical. In January 2019, she earned strong reviews for her performance in Rent: Live.\n\nVanessa Hudgens played Kailani in Journey 2\n\nDid U Know?\n\nVanessa became a spokesmodel for Neutrogena in 2007.\n\nVanessa is dated her High School Musical love interest, Zac Efron, in real life for 5 years.\n\nVanessa has been in a relationship with actor Austin Butler since 2011.\n\nBoth sets of Vanessa's grandparents were musicians.\n\nVanessa toured with the Cheetah Girls while promoting her album, V.\n\nBefore she landed the role in the High School Musical, Vanessa said she considered auditioning for American Idol.\n\nVanessa with her boyfriend Austin\n\nVanessa Hudgens Says...\n\n\"This sounds so stupid - but I always dreamed of being a prom queen. That's the only thing that I kind of missed. I missed the whole high school opportunity because I've been home schooled since I was in seventh grade.\"\n\nRelated Stories:"
