        "text": "We can Work This Out!\n\nThere is no denying that when it comes to teen High School movies, Disney's 2006 smash hit High School Musical certainly tops the list. After the monumental success of the franchise, it's fair to say a HSM reunion would bop right to the top! Well, now, it seems that the idea of a reunion may not be to crazy of an idea...\n\nYep, you heard us right, fans are putting their detective hats on and are pretty much convinced that the East High gang may be reuniting and bringing us something special, thanks to some not-so-subtle Instagram posts from Troy and Gabriella themselves (Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens), as well as Kaycee Stroh (who plays hip-hop dancing Martha).\n\nBringing us bangers such as 'We're All in this Together', 'Breaking Free', 'Fabulous', 'Work This Out' and 'Everyday' (need we go on?), High School Musical skyrocketed the careers of the likes of Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale, and it's safe to say that the film, along with its iconic soundtrack, has a special place in our hearts.\n\nIs there going to be a High School Musical reunion?\n\nIt's the question on all of our lips! Although nothing has been officially confirmed, High School Musical stars Zac Efron (Troy Bolton) and Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez) have got us all talking with their recent Instagram activity. After Kaycee Stroh (Martha Cox) pushed suspicions even further, let's break it down, get our heads in the game and work this out... (Sorry, we had to):\n\nZac followed Vanessa on Instagram in April 2023\n\nZac sent fans into meltdown after he re-followed Vanessa on Instagram, 12 years after the pair broke up. It's not quite clear the exact time Zac re-followed his ex, but eagle-eyed Instagram users were excited after spotting Vanessa in Zac's following list in April 2023.\n\nVanessa, who is engaged to baseball star Cole Tucker, has not followed Zac back on the social media platform. However, fans were quick to speculate that this could mean a High School Musical reunion is on the cards.\n\nOne person tweeted: 'Oh my god are we finally gonna get an actual reunion.' Whilst another fan referenced one of High School Musical's popular songs and said: 'This could be the start of something new.'\n\nVanessa Hudgens at High School Musical's East High\n\nOn 26th June 2022, Vanessa sent High School Musical fans into meltdown as she shared a clip of herself, outside of the iconic school featured in the films - East High School, in Salt Lake, Utah - while the track 'Breaking Free' played in the background.\n\nCaptioning the post, Vanessa used a quote from Gabriella Montez in the first High School Musical film. She wrote: 'Do you remember in kindergarten how you'd meet a kid and know nothing about them, then 10 seconds later you're playing like you're best friends because you didn't have to be anything but yourself?'\n\nHitting us all in the feels, the comments section was flooded with friends and fans who began reminiscing. One wrote: 'FOREVER ICONICüôå', with another commenting: 'Im gonna cryyyy üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠' (sic), and another adding: 'Honestly what a time, high school musical still that movie üò≠üò≠' (sic).\n\nBart Johnson, who played Troy's dad - Coach Bolton - even took to the comments section to write: 'I saw this and had a PTSD like I couldn‚Äôt find my team captains LETS GO WILDCATS!! üèÄüêæ'.\n\nZac Efron at High School Musical's East High\n\nNow this is where it gets interesting... Just under a month later, Zac then took to Instagram to share a VERY similar snap, on 23rd July 2022.\n\nDelighting fans, Zac uploaded a photo of himself in the exact same spot we saw Vanessa in just one month prior. In true Breakfast Club style, the actor shared an image of himself with his fist in the air, captioning the image: 'Don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ Forget about me ‚úäüèº'.\n\nPutting two-and-two together, many fans began to speculate in the comments that the back-to-back posts may in fact be a subtle hint that we may have a reunion coming our way.\n\nTaking to the comments, one fan wrote: 'But but but... Vanessa posted a similar one a few weeks ago. What does this mean?', with another commenting: 'FIRST VANESSA NOW ZAC!!! WE NEED HSM4' (sic) and another speculating: 'this has got hsm reunion written allllll over it!!' (sic).\n\nFollowing the posts, which were just three weeks apart, many fans took to Twitter to share their suspicions and excitement.\n\nKaycee Stroh at High School Musical's East High\n\nAs if Zac and Vanessa's posts weren't enough, actress Kaycee Stroh, who played the hip-hop dance moving Martha Cox, took to TikTok to get us all talking again on 30th July! Sharing a clip of herself inside the iconic East High lunch hall, she captioned the video: 'Where it all went down üêæ'.\n\nIn the clip, Kaycee asks fans: \"Does anybody recognise where I am?\" before continuing: \"Oh snap!\"\n\nAs we all know, the legendary lunch hall is where a lot of HSM drama took place, including the dance number for the huge track 'Stick to the Status Quo' in the first film of the franchise.\n\nIs there going to be a High School Musical 4?\n\nWith many convinced that we have a reunion on the way, plenty are thinking that it may in fact be another film in the franchise - with there already being three films, this would give us High School Musical 4.\n\nOthers, however, could be persuaded otherwise, with many fans speculating that both Zac and Vanessa could be featured on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series on Disney+, with a comment on Zac's Instagram post reading: 'I hope this means you and Vanessa are guest starring on HSMTMTS' (sic).\n\nIf you're not familiar with the show, which premiered in 2019 and starred Olivia Rodrigo, it is an American mockumentary musical drama series set at East High School... Yes, the same East High School that featured in the original HSM films. In honour of the famous film that was filmed at the students' school, their school play is none other than High School Musical: The Musical.\n\nSo far, the show has seen some OG Wildcats feature, in the form of Lucas Grabeel, who played Ryan Evans, and Kaycee Stroh. Due to the previous cameos, many fans are now certain that upcoming seasons will feature none other than Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nHowever, despite the rumours, Zac and Vanessa will not be starring in the fourth and final series of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. The new series is set to arrive on Disney+ on 9th August 2023.\n\nSix of the original High School Musical cast members will be making an appearance in the new series. Corbin Bleu (Chad), Monique Coleman (Taylor), Lucas Gabreel (Ryan), Bart Johnson (Coach Bolton), Alyson Reed (Ms Darbus) and Kaycee Stroh (Martha). This will be the first season without Olivia Rodrigo, who left in the previous season.\n\nIn season four of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, there will be a big crossover between the show and the iconic films, with the storyline set to focus on High School Musical 4: The Reunion - a movie which will only be made on the show. The show will feature the making of a reunion movie, which will be filmed in East High and see the students play extras in the film.\n\nAlthough the series will feature a 'High School Musical reunion', an actual real-life reunion film is still yet to be confirmed.\n\nZac Efron on a High School Musical reunion\n\nWill Zac Efron return to High School Musical? In May 2022, the actor teased that he would happily reprise his role as Troy if the opportunity presented itself.\n\nSpeaking to E! News, he said: \"Having the opportunity in any form to go back and work with that team would be so amazing. My heart is still there. That would be incredible. I hope it happens.\"\n\nAlthough nothing has been confirmed, we will be keeping our fingers crossed for a High School Musical reunion in real life!\n\nCheck out these films we're excited about in 2022:\n\nNow read:\n\nHere's the real reason Zac Efron didn't sing in High School Musical\n\nZac Efron's complete transformation through the years\n\nZac Efron's fans think he's secretly married after being spotted wearing a 'wedding ring'\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
