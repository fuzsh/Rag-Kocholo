        "text": "What one group of Topeka teens did on their summer vacation was to stage Disney's \"High School Musical 2 Jr.\"\n\nThe Academy production of the 70-minute, one-act stage adaptation of the highest-rated Disney Channel movie of all time opens Friday in Oldfather Theatre at Topeka Civic Theatre & Academy, 3028 S.W. 8th, for an 11-show run.\n\nThe second installment of the \"High School Musical\" series begins at the start of summer vacation at East High School in Albuquerque, N.M., where newcomer brainiac Gabriella Montez and Wildcat basketball star Troy Bolton used a shared love to musical theater to become a couple and break down barriers between student cliques in the process.\n\nJosie Price and Nick Arnold, who played Gabriella and Troy three years ago in TCT's sold-out run of \"High School Musical,\" reprise those roles in \"High School Musical 2,\" and Katy Wright is back as the songwriting Kelsi Neilsen. There are seven other \"High School Musical\" alumni — Taylor Arnold, Ann Baldridge, Ethan Carlson, Zach Cope, Christian Mullen, Abby Price and Randy Rhoten — in the cast, but for the sequel they are taking on new roles, said director Jennifer Van Bruggen.\n\nIn \"High School Musical 2,\" the Wildcats land jobs at the Lava Springs Country Club, which is owned by father of East High diva Sharpay Evans (Ellie West) and her lackey brother Ryan (Carlson). Sharpay decides her summer project is to steal Troy away from Gabriella. She uses her fortune and his financial need as a way to put a wedge between the couple and alienate him from the Wildcats.\n\nHowever, the \"We're All In This Together\" attitude of \"High School Musical\" prevails in the sequel, only this time the morale-delivering song is \"All For One.\"\n\nThe newcomers in the cast include Ashley Cook, Kelse Cummings, Tory Everett, Jenna Kramer, Kathleen Kramer, Josh Radford, Claire Sundbye, Josh Whisler and Kennedy Wools.\n\nVan Bruggen wasn't sure \"High School Musical 2\" will do as well at the box office as \"High School Musical\" given four years has passed since the movie first aired on the Disney Channel. However, she said while the first batch of \"High School Musical\" fans have outgrown the franchise, it's been discovered and embraced by their younger sisters, brothers and cousins.\n\nIn addition to Van Bruggen as director, the production team includes Nancy Goodall as music director, Angie Allendorf Price as choreographer and Kate Stires as costume designer.\n\nTwo Academy alumni contributed to the production's design — Matt Hammel, set, and Josh Witt, lights — under the supervision of technical director Adam Jenks.\n\n\"Josh is in college and Matt starts this fall, and they both did a really fine job,\" Van Bruggen said.\n\nAlyssa and Zach Ward stage-manage \"High School Musical 2 Jr.\"\n\nBill Blankenship can be reached\n\nat (785) 295-1284\n\nor bill.blankenship@cjonline.com."
