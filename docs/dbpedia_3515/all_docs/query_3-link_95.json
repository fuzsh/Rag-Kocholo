        "text": "Take a trip to Fleet Street (at your own risk) this spring. Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical thriller Sweeney Todd is back with an all-star cast serving up murder and meat pies. Grammy and Tony Award nominee Josh Groban stars as the title barber, with Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford as Mrs. Lovett, Todd's partner in crime.\n\nThe 2023 production at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre marks Sweeney Todd's third Broadway revival, and if you missed its previous iterations, now's the time to attend the tale. We've served up all the information you need about this bloody Broadway hit, including showtimes and venue details, fun facts, and all the celebrities taking on the show's iconic roles.\n\nWhat is Sweeney Todd about?\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a musical thriller set in 19th-century London. The story follows the vengeful barber Sweeney Todd as he seeks revenge on the corrupt Judge Turpin, who imprisoned him and ruined his life. Soon, though, he turns his anger not just toward Turpin, but to anyone who crosses his path. With the help of his accomplice Mrs. Lovett, who operates a pie shop below his barber shop, Todd begins killing his customers and using their bodies as ingredients in her meat pies.\n\nWhere is Sweeney Todd playing?\n\nSweeney Todd is on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, located at 205 West 46th St. between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. The theatre was initially called the Globe, after Shakespeare's theatre in England, and opened in 1910. In 1958, the venue was renovated and renamed for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, a couple who co-starred in many Broadway productions.\n\nHow long is Sweeney Todd?\n\nThe show has a runtime of approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes, including an intermission. This is a typical length for Broadway musicals, which tend to run between two and three hours.\n\nWhat days is Sweeney Todd playing?\n\nThrough March, Sweeney Todd plays Tuesdays through Sundays, with no performances on Mondays. Beginning in April, the show plays Wednesday through Sunday, with no performances on Mondays and Tuesdays. There are two performances on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\nWho wrote Sweeney Todd?\n\nSweeney Todd features music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim is one of the most celebrated composer/lyricists in Broadway history, whose most famous shows include Gypsy, Sunday in the Park With George, and Follies. In addition to Sweeney Todd, multiple of his musicals have received recent acclaimed New York revivals, including Company, Into the Woods, Assassins, and Merrily We Roll Along.\n\nThe book for Sweeney Todd is by Hugh Wheeler. He collaborated with Sondheim on one other musical: 1973's A Little Night Music. He also adapted his script for A Little Night Music into the film adaptation's screenplay.\n\nWhen did Sweeney Todd premiere?\n\nSweeney Todd premiered on Broadway in 1979, with direction by Harold Prince and a cast led by Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd and Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett. The story's origins, however, go back a whole century more. Discover the history of Sweeney Todd below.\n\n1846-47: The title character, of a barber who uses his profession for murderous ends, first appears in a Victorian serial.\n\n1973: Christopher Bond writes a play about the character, also called Sweeney Todd.

He ended up replacing most of the dialogue with music; about 80% is sung through.\n\n1979: The Sweeney Todd musical premieres at the Uris Theater (now the Gershwin) and runs for over a year. It also won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\n\n1980: Sweeney Todd premieres in London.

She is also the object of Anthony's affections.\n\nAnthony Hope: A sailor who rescued Sweeney Todd at sea and brings him back to London. He falls for Johanna, not realizing she is Todd's daughter.\n\nTobias Ragg: A young apprentice to another barber and then to Mrs. Lovett, who mistrusts Todd.\n\nBeggar Woman: A mysterious lady who holds secrets about Sweeney Todd's past.\n\nSweeney Todd songs\n\nSweeney Todd features some of Stephen Sondheim's most memorable songs, including \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" (which has a whopping \"Johanna,\" and \"A Little Priest.\" Here are all the songs in the musical.\n\nAct 1\n\n\"Prelude: The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\"\n\n\"No Place Like London\"\n\n\"The Barber and His Wife\"\n\n\"The Worst Pies in London\"\n\n\"Poor Thing\"\n\n\"My Friends\"\n\n\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 1)\"\n\n\"Green Finch and Linnet Bird\"\n\n\"Ah, Miss\"\n\n\"Johanna\"\n\n\"Pirelli's Miracle Elixir\"\n\n\"The Contest (Part 1): Shaving Scene\"\n\n\"The Contest (Part 2): Tooth-Pulling Scene\"\n\n\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 2)\"\n\n\"Wait\"\n\n\"Pirelli's Death\"\n\n\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 3)\"\n\n\"Johanna (Mea Culpa)\"\n\n\"Kiss Me\"\n\n\"Ladies In Their Sensitivities\"/\"Kiss Me (Quartet)\"\n\n\"Pretty Women\"\n\n\"Epiphany\"\n\n\"A Little Priest\"\n\nAct 2\n\n\"God, That's Good!\"\n\n\"Johanna (Quartet)\"\n\n\"I Am A Lass\"\n\n\"By The Sea\"\n\n\"Wigmaker Sequence\"/\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 4)\"/\"The Letter\"\n\n\"Not While I'm Around\"\n\n\"Parlour Songs (Part 1): Sweet Polly Plunkett\"\n\n\"Parlour Songs (Part 2): The 12 Bells In Tower of Bray\"\n\n\"Parlour Songs (Part 3): Sweet Polly Plunkett (Reprise)\"\n\n\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 5)\"/\"Fogg's Asylum\"/\"City On Fire\"/\"Searching\"/\"Ah, Miss (Reprise)\"/\"Beggar Woman's Lullaby\" § / \"The Judge's Return\"/\"The Ballad Of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 6)\"/\"Final Scene\"\n\n\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd (Reprise 7)\"\n\nWhat awards has Sweeney Todd won?\n\nSweeney Todd's multiple revivals have won numerous awards over the years, including a combined 11 Tony Awards and, across the pond, nine Olivier Awards.

Sondheim hand-picked Cariou for the role, and it remains his best-known stage credit.\n\nVictor Garber: Stage and screen star Garber played the supporting role of Anthony Hope in the original 1979 production.\n\nImelda Staunton: Multi-award-winning stage and screen actress Staunton played Lovett in the 2012 London revival of Sweeney Todd, earning her third of four Olivier Awards for her performance.\n\nMichael Ball: Ball played Todd opposite Staunton in London in 2012, earning an Olivier Award. He's best known for his many performances in London's West End, including in shows like Les Misérables and Hairspray.\n\nJohnny Depp: Depp played Sweeney Todd in the musical's 2007 film adaptation.

Around the same time, he was also co-starring with Carter on screen in the Harry Potter films.\n\nOnscreen adaptations of Sweeney Todd\n\nSweeney Todd has received one film adaptation, directed by Tim Burton in 2007. The film starred Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. The supporting cast was equally starry, including Alan Rickman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Sacha Baron Cohen, Timothy Spall, and more.\n\nTheatre and film director Sam Mendes had been working on a film adaptation of Sweeney Todd for years and was originally slated to helm the 2007 film. However, he left for another project, and Burton — who had also wanted to do a Sweeney Todd film since the 1980s — stepped in.\n\nFun facts about Sweeney Todd\n\nTo keep you razor-sharp about all things Sweeney Todd, here are some fun facts about the musical.\n\nThe character of Sweeney Todd first appeared in The String of Pearls, a 19th-century penny dreadful story. His story was then adapted into films in 1928 and 1936, and in 1973, Christopher Bond wrote a Sweeney Todd play. That play is the basis of Sondheim and Wheeler's musical!\n\nThe 2023 revival is the first Sweeney Todd Broadway production to use a full 26-piece orchestra, as the show was originally written for, since the 1979 premiere. The font on the 2023 revival's poster art is also the same as the original.\n\nThe original poster art for Sweeney Todd, which features caricatures of the two main characters holding bloody weapons, was drawn in the style of a 19th-century advertising image etched into wood.\n\nBecause Sweeney Todd is mostly sung through and calls for large-scale orchestrations similar to those of opera, multiple opera companies worldwide have put on Sweeney Todd. Original Broadway director Hal Prince helmed its first opera production in Houston.\n\nSondheim incorporates an old Latin chant called \"Dies irae\" into \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" and its multiple reprises. The original piece of music dates back to the 1200s!\n\nHow to get Sweeney Todd tickets\n\nTodd and Lovett may sing about \"the worst pies in London,\" but Sweeney Todd has proven time and time again that it's one of the best musicals in New York. Don't miss your chance to see Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford thrill as these iconic characters."
