        "text": "Definitely weaker than big boy Burton's 2010 remake, and one of the less engaging adaptations I've seen- but it deserves some merit and has it's moments. Thank you for reading, and I hope you are all well.\n\nAn excessively melodramatic performance by Tod Slaughter carries this otherwise unremarkable adaptation of the classic serial killer story. The trapdoor to the basement was a nice touch, the love story was as basic as they come. All in all, it's a movie that's so cartoonish and over-the-top that it is hard to take seriously as a horror movie by today's standards, but it's not devoid of macabre fun.\n\nAs Bellatrix sang gleefully...\n\nMind you, I can hardly blame them\n\nThese are probably the worst pies in London\n\nI know why nobody cares to take them\n\nI should know, I make 'em\n\nBut good?\n\nNo, the worst pies in London, even that's polite\n\nThe worst pies in London\n\nIf you doubt it, take a bite\n\nTim Burton's version of this classic old tale is the one if you ask me."
