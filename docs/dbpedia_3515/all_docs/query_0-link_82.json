        "text": "The Berkshires' are home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. Tourists flock to the area to discover the natural beauty our county has to offer. Think about fall and leaf peeping activities. Our area becomes a hotbed for out of towners trying to catch a glimpse of the beautiful foliage. In the winter, we receive visitors from all over, ready to challenge the mountains of our ski resorts. There's no doubt that Berkshire County is one of a kind. Then there's our arts and theater culture. Everything from the Berkshire International Film Festival, Williamstown Theater Festival, and Berkshire Theatre group just to name a few.\n\nLocals and tourists alike appreciate our theatre culture. Theatergoers know what it's like not to have this culture or have a very limited dose of it thanks to COVID-19. As a matter of fact, in a recent interview with State Rep. Smitty Pignatelli, Berkshire Theatre Group Artistic Director and CEO Kate McGuire mentioned how in 2020, outside performances were held in July and August and the audience was so moved with emotion over the fact that live performances were happening during the pandemic, that during the performances, tears were streaming down their faces. It just goes to show the power of theater and the Berkshires.\n\nWhile on the topic of theater, did you know that there have been plenty of movies that contain scenes filmed right here in the beautiful Berkshires? Yep, it's true and below we have included 12 movies that have had scenes filmed in our beautiful county. Let's take a look below.\n\nIn addition, there have been a few shorts filmed in the Berkshires including the following:\n\nThe River: starring Lauren Ambrose, filmed in Great Barrington and Monterey\n\nIâ€™m Coming Over starring Lauren Ambrose and Mike Birbiglia, filmed in the southern Berkshires\n\nWorlds We Created filmed in Sheffield and Stockbridge\n\nSpeaking of movies, actors and celebrities, check this out below:"
