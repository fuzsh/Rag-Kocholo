        "text": "A Probably Doomed Argument that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) is a Yuletide Classic\n\nI’m a lot less anti-Christmas than when I was a young man. Marrying a good woman from Bethlehem, Pa., the Christmas City, changed my feelings, mostly. I’ve made my peace with it, even if I flinch a little when it arrives. I like the lights and the rich food and the nogs, and I love that annual experiment in bricolage, the American Christmas tree. I still don’t know what to do with the day itself, except to go to the movies, and you can’t, this year. Maybe ever.\n\nThere’s a host of gentle and kind holiday films I’m certainly willing to revisit. Consider Meet Me in St. Louis’s Christmas sequence. The little Tootie (Margaret O’Brien) is in a world of hurt, being insufficiently consoled by a song and the toy monkey her almost-grown sister (Judy Garland) uses to to distract her sister, as she sings “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” O’Brien, soft, focusless gaze — here, O’Brien is more of a child, than a child actor — is almost unbearably tender.\n\nThe famous song reflects the year it was made, 1944, an implicit reference to the soldiers overseas who wouldn’t be home. It’s more of a Christmas lament than a carol.\n\nThe sequence is perfect for 2020, a Christmas spent away from relatives and friends in hopes of a better holiday, maybe down the road: “Until then, we’ll have to muddle through somehow.”\n\nOthers, briefly: Scots director Bill Forsyth’s 1984 Comfort and Joy is currently on YouTube. It’s radiant with the melancholy solstice light in Glasgow, caught by cinematographer Chris Menges. Bill Patterson is Alan, a lightweight AM radio drive-time host known as “Dickie Bird.” He copes with a holiday breakup with his live-in Maddy (Eleanor David) — a manic pixie dream girl who has that real-life manic pixie dream girl habit of dropping a man suddenly and without explanation. To solace himself, he turns investigative journalist, getting to the bottom of a war between rival ice cream truck companies. (This was actually something that happened, though it wasn’t comic, as it is here.)\n\n1940s’ The Shop Around the Corner exists in a special category of Christmas films, one that acknowledges the live-long day of retail work, while trafficking in heavenly romance between Jimmy Stewart and the frail, husky-voiced Margaret Sullavan. It’s one of the peak of the studio system’s creations, and it’s keeled with a story of adultery, not at all played for a wink — unusual for director Ernst Lubitsch’s work.\n\n1940’s Remember the Night and The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (1944) are a perfect Preston Sturges double bill. The former is a road movie preferable to It Happened One Night, with Fred MacMurray as a slick DA giving a good-looking, salty shoplifter (Barbara Stanwyck) a Christmas in the country before sending her to jail.\n\nMiracle of Morgan’s Creek is an indeed miraculous Christmas story of (seemingly) virgin birth during war time. Betty Hutton (above, center) is Trudy, a pregnant hicksville teenager; the gifted sad-sack comic Eddie Bracken (above, dressed as a doughboy) is Norval, the man she needs as an alibi. As her wiseass 14 year old sister Emmy (Diana Lynn) says, Norval was born for the role of a modern St. Joseph: “He was made for it, like the ox was made to eat and the grape was made to drink.”\n\nThere is no funnier film about Christmas.\n\nThe Die Hard cult doesn’t move me, because I prefer On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969). In England a televised James Bond movie was considered as much a part of the fiesta as Christmas crackers and roast goose.\n\n(Above: The Comte de Bleauchamp’s private Swiss sanitarium. “Bleauchamp,” indeed.)\n\nAs for the one and done star George Lazenby, his inadequacies make his take on 007 particularly suspenseful. His fourth-wall breaking comment “This never happened to the other fella” means a Bond movie full of things that never happened to Sean Connery. It’s the ultimate James Bond Xmas special: a triumph of editing, with plenty of alpine snow, a soaring John Barry score, dangerous pre-CG skiing stunts…and the mad Blofeld (Telly Savalas) decorating his own tree as he prepares a most alarming Yuletide greetings for the United Nations.\n\nA Christmas Carol exists in more dimensions than Spider-Man. As the expert semiotician Bart Simpson said, “TV writers have been milking that goat for years.” There’s no definitive version, but the semi-public domain 1951 rendition starring Alistair Sim does something different than the others. It has some Balzac-like material, such as the subplot about how Jacob Marley and Ebeneezer Scrooge achieved their rise. One step in it was their deliberate bankrupting of Scrooge’s ebullient mentor Fezziwig.\n\nThe story’s timelessness is in the details. At large, and still dreadful in 2020, Want and Ignorance, personified by a pair of dull-eyed children lurking at the feet of the Ghost of Christmas Present. Doom-heralding Ignorance has its heyday now, maybe more than ever. Sadly, still current: the Scroogean greed of certain politicians, who need not be named.\n\nThe holidays are all about mixed feeling. Audiences have a sneaking admiration for the pre-repentance Scrooge, dismissing Christmas as an act of theft and a conspiracy of whipguilts. In the Sim version, Scrooge has his reasons for hating the holiday. We learn them as the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge on a tour of all the instances of death and neglect that made him the dour old bastard he was.\n\nAnd in the Future scene, where Scrooges garments and bedclothes are being clawed over by second hand retailers (and who doesn’t love an estate sale?) we can get the satisfaction of seeing the old sinner dead.\n\nI offer that Scrooge could have been just as dead if he’d gone for a shave and a haircut at the atelier of his exact contemporary in time and place…that talented barber, Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.\n\nIt’s not Christmas around here without Sweeney Todd. This perennial holiday favorite around chez moi may not seem like a Christmassy story. Some would say that Sweeney Todd is irredeemably tragic and vile, even in less genteel times than the holiday. It’s significant that our preferred holiday viewing is about trauma, though; suicide (It’s a Wonderful Life), the kidnapping plot hatched by a skeleton (The Nightmare Before Christmas)…and naturally the ghosts, cemeteries and the crippled in A Christmas Carol.\n\nChristmas decorations aren’t just celebratory, they’re lights holding something frightening back. The solstice is an ominous time, and it’s been that way for eons. The Romans solstice celebration was the Saturnalia, dedicated to the God Saturn.\n\nYou know, Saturn?\n\nThe tale of the demon barber Sweeney Todd, the Londoner who cut customer’s throats, and of Mrs Lovett, who made the corpses into meat pies, went from a penny dreadful story to the stage of Tod Slaughter’s theater in the 1930s. There’s also a not-so good British film version by Slaughter in 1936.\n\nSlaughter was working in a field something like Paris’ theater of gore, the Grand Guignol. The actor-director’s specialty was taking archaic melodramas and making them live and bleed. Viewers came to snicker, and ended up thrilled. Slaughter had a few discerning fans — one being Graham Greene, who also championed full-flavored actors like Peter Lorre and Charles Laughton.\n\nSlaughter would deserve honor if just for the way he spent the break during performances of Sweeney Todd. As intermission began, he’d be standing at the theater’s bar, back to the wall. He still wore his bloody apron: wordless, smoking a cig, staring at the punters with contempt, as if mentally prepping them for a final shave.\n\nPlaywright Christopher Bond rewrote the tale of Sweeney in the 1970s to give him a backstory. This is the source for the Stephen Sondheim musical. In the new version Benjamin Barker was transported to Australia, at the behest of a cruel Judge Turpin during the early 1830s. A stroke of luck got him back to London after many years, where he was able to take up his trade as a barber under a new name.\n\nThanks to his former landlady Mrs. Lovett, Barker/Todd learns the sad fate of his wife. She’d gone to plead with the judge for mercy, and ended up treated like a party favor at an orgy of blue-blooded degenerates.\n\nWhen Todd killed a rival who threatened to expose him as a wanted man, Mrs Lovett has a novel suggestion on what to do with the body…as outlined in the noted waltz “A Little Priest.” And thus the Great British Bake-off begins.\n\nSondheim, who wrote the score and the lyrics of the hit musical, once said, “I like theater but I love movies”. The musical is nothing if not cinematic to begin with. The tunes are influenced by Hitchcock’s regular collaborator, the composer Bernard Herrmann, including quotes from his score for Psycho.\n\nThe material is so sturdy that it’s hard to fail it. The Tim Burton film version, released in December 2007 was risky — the story goes that there were walkouts by viewers who hadn’t realized it was going to be a musical. The leads didn’t have noble voices: the since-doghoused Johnny Depp shows off his mimetic qualities, imitating Bowie in Bowie’s days of peak Anthony Newley worship (like so).\n\nHelena Bonham Carter, in a role seemingly the property of Patti LuPone and/or Angela Lansbury, made some legitimate musical fans grind their teeth. But I, too, like theater but love movies. Bonham Carter’s frailness adds both danger to the finale, and a dose of sweetness to the song “Wait,” where Mrs. Lovett turns her thoughts from the price of meat to the subject of flowers.\n\nBurton’s framing is severely ghastly — he turned the material into a Hammer movie pastiche, with that lighting that made the spilled blood in Christopher Lee’s Dracula movies look almost day-glo red. Being this literal, Burton’s Sweeney Todd refutes campiness.\n\nCan’t get past the singing, anyway? Here’s something to augment this film version: the Lonny Price-directed Lincoln Center Sweeney Todd in Concert with the NY Philharmonic. The Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel plays Sweeney as vengeful as Rigoletto.\n\nPrice’s version commences with a luscious and audience-murdering bit of stagecraft: a reminder that Sondheim’s Sweeney debuted in that punk rock year, 1979.\n\nIt starts as a demure recital, with the requisite gowns, bouquet-filled vases, and music stands. After an exchange of glances between the sizable Terfel and his Mrs. Lovell (Emma Thompson), the revolt begins. The cast have fists in the air, like ’70s radicals, slavering for the blood of moralizers. Thomspon’s breakaway crimson gown is ripped into poor-person tatters; the scrim becomes a wall splashed with red paint and the prints of giant red hands.\n\nThe violence is pantomimed, rather than explicit as it is in Burton’s Hammer-movie blood bath — it’s the music that does the violence.\n\nSide by side, the two versions achieve about 90% of what you’d want for an adaptation of this saga of death and night and blood.\n\nAt the beginning of Hamlet, the guard Marcellus spots the old king’s ghost. This watchman — the man who smells the rottenness of Denmark — is particularly surprised. He had thought that at Christmas, ghosts don’t walk, “so hallow’d and so gracious is the time.”\n\nOn the contrary, this time of year is alive with ghosts — like the double-exposure phantoms in A Christmas Carol (1951) hovering and wailing. Like knock-kneed Scrooge I’d rather not face them. I have my own empty chairs around the table, as President-elect Biden put it.\n\nA peculiar bloodthirstiness descends on me over the holiday, because the memories, bad and otherwise, are so overwhelming, because of the reckless, nay, homicidal behavior of the shoppers, and drivers just begging to add themselves to the holiday death toll. And then there’s all the more minor abrasions. Probably because of this house-arrest sitch, I’ve avoided a principle peeve: Wham!’s “Last Christmas,” apparently composed during mandatory chord-rationing.\n\nThis is not everybody’s Christmas, but it is an aspect of Christmas: “It’s man devouring man, my dear…and who are we to deny it in here?” Sondheim’s blood and thunder always gets me around this Cape Horn of a season, with its storms and darkness, to the sunnier side of the year where I’d rather dwell."
