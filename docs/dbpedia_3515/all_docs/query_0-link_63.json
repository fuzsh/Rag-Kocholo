        "text": "Have you always dreamed of being in a movie? Now might be your chance. There are a few movies you can become an extra in being filmed in Syracuse.\n\nIf you're nervous thinking that you won't get chosen because of no experience, forget that thought. No experience is necessary and even better, you'll be paid for being an extra. A few movies within the American High franchise are the ones you'll be able to be a part of, including a sequel to one of the more successful movies filmed in the series, The Binge.\n\nIf you've never seen the movie which is touted as one of the largest ever filmed in the Syracuse area, you can catch it on Hulu to see what kind of movie you'll be auditioning for. One main difference for 'The Binge 2: A Wonderful Binge\" is that it will be Christmas-themed. However, that isn't the only movie the film series is casting for. American High films numerous movies per year in the Syracuse area and are constantly looking for extras to be a part of the filmmaking.\n\n“You don’t have to be a professional actor, you’re paid for the day, and you just may get to see yourself on the big screen. It’s a fun experience and an exclusive look behind the scenes.” - Annie Delano, owner of AND Casting / Syracuse.com"
