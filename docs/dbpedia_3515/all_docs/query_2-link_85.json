        "text": "Welcome to this year’s celebration of classic silent and early sound horror films with landmark anniversaries! Sadly, the Monster template is no longer available. I’m so disappointed and upset! Every year, I looked forward to changing my blogs into that theme for October.\n\nWe’re starting off with the 1897 British film The X-Rays (sometimes called The X-Ray Fiend), directed by George Albert Smith. Many of Mr. Smith’s films feature horror and/or supernatural themes. Some sources say he also directed a lost 1897 film called The Haunted Castle, but most film scholars believe this is a misattribution to either the 1897 Georges Méliès film of the same name, or the 1896 Méliès film The House of the Devil, released as The Haunted Castle in the U.S.\n\nAn aggressive would-be suitor tries to woo a woman who wants none of it, and an X-ray machine appears and turns them into skeletons. The woman’s parasol also transmogrifies into just its metal supports. The special effects via jump-cuts were state of the art by 1890s standards.\n\nThe woman is played by Mr. Smith’s wife, Laura Bayley, and the man is comedian Tom Green.\n\nSorry there’s no soundtrack, but it’s only 44 seconds long\n\nMy yearly horror film spotlight wouldn’t be complete without grand master Georges Méliès! The first of the films featured this year is The Treasures of Satan (Les Trésors de Satan) (1902), released in the U.K. as The Devil’s Money Bags.\n\nIn a castle, Satan and two assistants put six moneybags into a long chest. After they leave, a stranger (Méliès) creeps in with the intent to steal the moneybags. He breaks the lock, and the moneybags begin dancing in the air. Then he sits on the chest, but is forced off when the lid flies up.\n\nSix ladies in devil outfits pop out, each holding a moneybag which transmogrifies into a spear. When the would-be robber jumps into the chest to take shelter from their torture, the chest changes position, and he’s left exposed. Then the ladies jump back into the chest, and the chest continues moving all around the room before turning into a demon. More torture follows.\n\nFinally, Satan and the demon capture the robber and put him back into the chest. The ladies return and dance as the chest explodes in fire and smoke.\n\nThe moneybags are safe and sound after all that drama.\n\nSatan in Prison (Satan en Prison) is a simple story of an imprisoned man (Méliès) who conjures up a fireplace, a table, chairs, a tablecloth, plates, silverware, a mirror, a woman, and various items of home décor. When the guards return, he makes all these objects disappear as magically as they appeared, and reveals himself as Satan. He then disappears with the aid of his cape.\n\nThe Red Spectre (Le Spectre Rouge) was directed by Segundo de Chomón (Segundo Víctor Aurelio Chomón y Ruiz). Señor de Chomón is widely considered the greatest Spanish silent film director, and often compared to Méliès because he used many of the same magical illusion tricks and camera work.\n\nIn 1901, he began distributing his films through the French company Pathé, and moved to Paris in 1905. He remained with Pathé even after returning to Barcelona in 1910.\n\nIn an underground grotto, a dancing coffin opens amid flames to reveal a demonic magician in a skeleton suit and with a magnificent cape. He conjures up five dancing ladies, flying flames, and decorative gold cauldrons which he lights. He then brings back two of the ladies, wraps them in a black tarpaulin, and makes them levitate and disappear. His next magic trick is making the ladies appear shrunken-down inside large bottles which he fills with liquid.\n\nA Good Spirit does some back and forth tricks, including an easel projecting films and throwing objects at him from thin air. Finally, the Good Spirit reveals an area of the grotto with the other ladies, and she takes him downstage, pours something on him, and turns him into a lifeless skeleton.\n\nSatan at Play (Satan S’Amuse) (1907), also directed by Señor de Chomón, is frequently confused with The Red Spectre at IMDB and on YouTube. They’re obviously two completely different films, which makes me wonder if people even bothered watching before mindlessly copying and pasting a synopsis. Sadly, I couldn’t find a single video of it anywhere, because everyone mislabeled The Red Spectre!\n\nThe Devil is bored. He goes back to Earth with a magic elevator. He surprises two sewer workers, disguises himself as a city man, and spreads improbable events: quarrel with a coachman, altercation with a city sergeant, the mystification of a barman, and quid pro quo with couples. He gets trapped in a cage with a young woman and goes down to Hell. It is revealed that the young woman is in fact Madame Devil, disguised by jealousy.\n\nThe sixth film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was released 16 January 1912. James Cruze, a prolific actor of the silent era who also directed many films from 1919–1937, stars in the lead role, and Florence LaBadie (the Thanhouser Girl) plays his sweetheart. Mr. Cruze’s real-life first wife Marguerite Snow appears as an extra.\n\nWho isn’t familiar with this story? A young doctor concocts a potion to transform himself into a grotesque creature, who commits evil acts and obeys his baser instincts. Before long, he no longer needs to drink the potion to transform, and his alter ego becomes more and more deranged, with tragic consequences.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe String of Pearls, a penny dreadful series published from 1846–47 and probably written by James Malcolm Rymer and/or Thomas Peckett Prest, introduced horror villain Sweeney Todd to the world. This character quickly became a staple of Victorian lore and legend, to the point it was believed he really existed.\n\nIn 1928, this story was first adapted for the silver screen. The first sound film version released March 1936 and starred Tod Slaughter in the leading role. Mr. Slaughter was best-known for playing crazed, maniacal villains in macabre horror films set during the Victorian era.\n\nThe story opens in the then-present day of 1936, as a barber tells a client about the infamous legend of Sweeney Todd. Though the film doesn’t specify a date, the original story is set in 1785.\n\nSweeney Todd runs a barber shop by the docks of London. Though he has many customers, no one is ever seen actually leaving his shop. He also goes through apprentices like water. This constant supply of poor boys is usually provided by the beadle, who gets them from the workhouse.\n\nSweeney’s newest apprentice, 12-year-old Tobias Ragg (John Singer), is terrified of his master, particularly since Sweeney tells him a lot of horror stories about the fate of previous apprentices who misbehaved or annoyed him. But having little choice if he wants a roof over his head and a regular supply of pennies to buy huge pies next door, Tobias quickly learns to obey and not make waves.\n\nSweeney’s interest is piqued when he observes Johanna Oakley (Eve Lister) and Mark Ingerstreet (Bruce Seton) talking about their future. Mark, who’s getting ready to sail with The Golden Hope, is afraid he won’t be able to win the approval of Johanna’s dad because of his lack of riches. Johanna’s maid Nan (Davina Craig) also asks Mark’s buddy Pearley (Jerry Verno) to buy her items he can’t afford either.\n\nOnce the ship sails, Sweeney buys a share of the shipping company from Johanna’s dad, Governor Oakley (D.J. Williams), and tries to woo Johanna. When Johanna expresses zero interest in this much-older stranger plying her with expensive jewelry, Sweeney then takes the matter directly to Gov. Oakley.\n\nThough the Oakleys are facing financial difficulties and stand poised to potentially lose their wealth and position, Gov. Oakley refuses to approve such a marriage. Sweeney might have wealth and the power to ruin them, but he’s also far too old for Johanna, and Johanna herself doesn’t give consent.\n\nSweeney decides to bide his time by continuing to “polish off” rich customers and steal their money. After Tobias finishes lathering a customer, Sweeney gives him a penny to go next door and buy a huge pie from Mrs. Lovett (Stella Rho). With Tobias out of the way, Sweeney locks the door and pulls a hidden lever to send the unwitting customer down into the cellar via a revolving piece of flooring under the chair.\n\nMrs. Lovett, whose cellar connects to the barber shop, helps Sweeney to drag the corpses off and pocket their riches. However, she’s quite annoyed at her partner in crime for making off with the lion’s share and not giving her nearly enough of the cut.\n\nMark became quite a wealthy man while away on the high seas, and returns with a lot of jewels and gold. Per the standards of the era, the indigenous people he and his men encountered abroad are portrayed quite stereotypically and offensively. However, this only occupies a fairly short scene in the overall running time, and isn’t the film’s focus.\n\nSweeney is delighted to usher Mark into the barber shop. When Mark naïvely talks about his new riches and plans to marry Johanna, Sweeney is even more excited about this fresh victim to rob and murder.\n\nBut this time the murderous trap door doesn’t work as expected, and Mrs. Lovett sneaks the dazed but largely uninjured Mark to safety. Mark and his friend Pearley then begin hatching a dangerous plan to finally bring Sweeney Todd to justice.\n\nAnd the plot just keeps on thickening and intensifying from here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDead of Night, a British anthology film, premièred 9 September 1945 at London’s Gaumont Haymarket theatre, and did very well commercially. Many modern critics continue to praise it as a classic horror film, with special praise for the final story about the ventriloquist.\n\nThough horror films had long been common in the U.S., they weren’t so common in Britain in this era; indeed, they’d been banned during WWII. Dead of Night began to change all that.\n\nThe film was made at Ealing Studios in West London, which began business in 1902 and is the world’s oldest continually-operating film production studio.\n\nWalter Craig (Mervyn Johns) arrives at a Tudor-style cottage in the country which seems oddly familiar. His sense of déjà vu increases even more when his host, Eliot Foley (Roland Culver), shows him inside. Though Walter has never met any of the guests, he’s dreamt about them all many times.\n\nDr. van Straaten (Frederick Valk) has a ready scientific answer for everything, including the stories the other guests tell about eerie events from their own lives, but as the night wears on, his skepticism gradually starts waning.\n\nFirst up is Hugh Grainger (Antony Baird), who tells the story of how he was almost killed in a racecar accident in “The Hearse Driver.” During the end of his hospital stay, he looks out the window and has a horrifying vision of a horse-drawn hearse. His nurse Joyce thinks he imagined it, but he can’t shake his terror.\n\nUpon his discharge, Grainger goes to catch a bus, but he’s filled with foreboding when the driver looks exactly like the hearse driver and says there’s only room for one. Grainger immediately steps back and lets the bus take off without him.\n\nAlmost immediately, the bus goes off the road and crashes down a steep hill. Grainger’s premonition saved his life.\n\nNext up is “The Christmas Party,” the story of teenage Sally O’Hara (Sally Ann Howes, now age 90). While playing hide-and-seek, Sally stumbles upon a hallway leading to a staircase leading to secret passageways and a playroom.\n\nIn the playroom, she encounters a little boy, Francis, who says his older sister Constance is very mean to him and wants to kill him. Sally treats him very tenderly and tucks him into bed before being found by her friends.\n\nSally is freaked out when she learns there are no children spending the night and that Francis is the unfortunate boy her buddy Jimmy told her about when they were hiding together earlier, a boy who was killed by his sister in that house a long time ago.\n\nThe middle story is “The Haunted Mirror,” the story that creeped me out most. Joan (Googie Withers) buys her fiancé Peter Cortland (Ralph Michael) a mirror from an antiques store to replace the basic one his uncle bought him awhile ago. Peter is happy with the gift at first, but soon lives in terror of it.\n\nEvery time he looks in the mirror, he sees a very Gothic-type room that looks like it’s in a mansion, with a burning fireplace, candles, and a fancy four-poster bed with carved grapes on top. He also can’t see Joyce in the mirror when she stands beside him.\n\nPeter wants to push out their wedding date because he fears he’s losing his mind, but he manages to summon the willpower to see his normal room behind him in the mirror again, and Joyce beside him.\n\nEverything seems to be going most swimmingly after they marry and move into a new house, but then the visions return. Joyce learns the supernatural reason for this when she visits the store where she bought the mirror and sees a bed exactly like the one Peter described.\n\nThe mirror, the bed, and several other things in the shop belonged to a man who died in 1836, in a house which was sealed until very recently. The storekeeper tells Joyce the tragic, horrific story of the original owner and his wife, a story Peter begins re-enacting when Joyce comes home.\n\nThis intense, creepy mood is lifted by the penultimate story, “The Golfer’s Story,” which is comedy-horror.\n\nBuddies George Parratt (Basil Radford) and Larry Potter (Naunton Wayne) are intense rivals on the golf course, but closer than brothers in all other arenas. That all changes, however, when they meet Mary Lee (Peggy Bryan).\n\nEventually they hit upon the idea of playing a golf game with Mary’s hand in marriage as the prize. George wades into the lake by the green after losing, and his ghost comes back to haunt Larry.\n\nGeorge tries to make Larry give up both Mary and golf forever, but Larry refuses this deal. He can give up Mary, but he’ll have no reason for living if he never golfs again. George accepts the compromise, and says he must always stay within six feet of Larry.\n\nGeorge’s presence quickly becomes impossible to bear, and George himself agrees this is really awkward. However, he’s unable to go back to the other world, since he came back to Earth without knowing that rather important detail of ghosting. The magic formula keeps eluding him.\n\nFinally, we have “The Ventriloquist’s Dummy,” a story within a story within a story. Dr. van Straaten tells a tale of the time he was called in as a psychoanalyst for Maxwell Frere (Michael Redgrave), who was charged with the attempted murder of fellow ventriloquist Sylvester Kee (Hartley Power).\n\nMaxwell’s dummy, Hugo, becomes more and more out of control, acting as if with a mind of his own instead of controlled by his master. This drives Maxwell into madness.\n\nThe last reel reminds me very much of all the twists and turns near the end of Dr. Caligari. It’s hard to tell what is and isn’t reality, since the lines are so blurred.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAlfred Hitchcock wasn’t an immediate success as a director. His bad luck turned around with The Lodger, released 14 February 1927 in the U.K. and 10 June 1928 in the U.S. It was a huge box office hit in the U.K., and received wonderful reviews.\n\nSome name this as the first truly Hitchcockian film, setting the stage for styles and themes which permeated much of the rest of his work.\n\nThe Lodger also has the first recognisable Hitchock cameo, 5:33 in. He’s at a newsroom desk, his back to the camera. The actor set to play the phone operator didn’t show up, so Hitchcock took over. He also shows up in a mob scene towards the end.\n\nThe film is based upon Marie Belloc Lowndes’s 1913 novel of the same name, about the 1888 hunt for Jack the Ripper. It was remade in 1932, 1944, 1953 (as Man in the Attic), and 2009. A 1960 opera was also based on the novel.\n\nAnother adaptation of the novel, the comic play Who Is He? (1915), written by Horace Annesley Vachell, was additional inspiration.\n\nThe mood and filming techniques were inspired by German Expressionism. While working on the German–British film The Blackguard in 1924, Hitchcock studied several films being produced nearby, particularly F.W. Murnau’s The Last Laugh. He’d also been inspired by Fritz Lang’s Der Müde Tod (1921).\n\nProducer Michael Balcon was furious when he saw the finished product, and almost shelved both the film and Hitchcock’s career. After a lot of fighting, they found a compromise, and film critic Ivor Montagu was hired to edit it.\n\nAt first, Hitchcock resented this, but Montagu only made minute suggestions, such as reshooting a few minor scenes and changing some intertitles. Montagu respected his talent and creativity too much to radically edit everything.\n\nWhen beautiful matinée idol Ivor Novello was cast as the star, the studio demanded changes to the script. They didn’t want any suggestion of ambiguity about his guilt vs. innocence, since ambiguity might suggest he were a villain, and the public couldn’t have that.\n\nYou’ll have to watch the film to see which side won.\n\nThe film opens with the murder of a young blonde woman. When her body is discovered, there’s a triangle on her, bearing the name of The Avenger. This murderer strikes blondes on Tuesday nights and leaves that triangle as his calling-card.\n\nThat night by a fashion show, blonde model Daisy Bunting (June Tripp) laughs at her co-workers’ hysterical fears, and how the other blondes are hiding their hair with wigs and hats. When she comes home, she finds her old parents and her rather unwanted boyfriend, policeman Joe (Malcolm Keen), discussing the crime.\n\nA beautiful young man (Ivor Novello) arrives by the Bunting house, inquiring after the room for rent. Mrs. Bunting is very nervous to see the lower half of his face covered by a scarf, just like The Avenger, but lets him inside and shows him the upstairs room.\n\nMrs. Bunting is further weirded out when she discovers the lodger has turned around all the paintings of young blonde women. He says he doesn’t like them, and asks if they can be put somewhere else.\n\nI got a good laugh out of Joe’s intertitle, “Anyway, I’m glad he’s not keen on the girls.” In a later intertitle, Mrs. Bunting also describes the lodger as “a bit queer.” Ivor was gay in real life, and in a relationship with Robert “Bobbie” Andrews from 1916 until his death in 1951.\n\nDaisy and the lodger start becoming closer, which Joe deeply resents. Meanwhile, the lodger’s strange behaviour begins to arouse the suspicions of Joe (now assigned to The Avenger case) and Mrs. Bunting. It doesn’t help matters that The Avenger’s murders are moving towards the Buntings’ home.\n\nIn addition to the jealous, controlling Joe, Daisy’s parents also disapprove of her budding romance with the lodger. Daisy, however, stands her ground, and continues meeting him for stolen moments. When Joe catches them on a date, Daisy tells him what’s what, and dumps him.\n\nJoe is newly-determined to prove the lodger is The Avenger, and intensifies his investigation. Will the lodger be found guilty or innocent?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
