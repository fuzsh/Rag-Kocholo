Reflections on the Development of Arts-Based Research in Music Therapy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLedger, Alison; McCaffrey, TrÃ­ona\n\n2015-01-01\n\nArts-based research (ABR) has emerged in music therapy in diverse ways, employing a range of interpretive paradigms and artistic media. It is notable that no consensus exists as to when and where the arts are included in the research process, or which music therapy topics are most suited to arts-based study. This diversity may pose challenges for music therapists who are developing, reading, and evaluating arts-based research. This paper provides an updated review of arts-based research literature in music therapy, along with four questions for researchers who are developing arts-based research. These questions are 1) When should the arts be introduced? 2) Which artistic medium is appropriate? 3) How should the art be understood? and 4) What is the role of the audience? We argue that these questions are key to understanding arts-based research, justifying methods, and evaluating claims arising from arts-based research. Rather than defining arts-based research in music therapy, we suggest that arts-based research should be understood as a flexible research strategy appropriate for exploring the complexities of music therapy practice.

Which is the support of music art â generally speaking â beyond its aesthetic dimension?

After a rush of enthusiasm during the Good Neighbor period (World War II, decades of indifference set in. After 2000, an increasing number of instructors began either (1 teaching the art music of Latin America in courses dedicated to all types of Latin America music or (2 incorporating the subject into existing courses on Western art music. Yet many instructors still omit Latin American art music, as do certain authors. In this essay, I question such a stance. Not only does Latin American art music offer a window into Latin American culture but it can help counteract persistent stereotypes about Latin America, a perspective that is all the more critical in light of recent demographic trends in the United States and recent political developments.\n\nMEANING, VALUE, IMPORTANCE IN ARTS AND THE ART OF MUSIC\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFatih Bingol\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available In the journey of reaching beauty, which has possibly been a basic motivation of art, there has been attempts to define beauty, In this respect, several questions have been addressed such as What is beauty?

Four levels of future music teachersâ art reflection are defined. These levels are based on the research measures of desire to master art reflection; the degree of understanding the nature and characteristics of art reflection; measures of the emotional involvement into art reflection; degree of possession of the necessary skills for art reflection; formation of professionalism in music and performing activities. They are initial, satisfactory, sufficient and optimal. The importance of formation of future music teachersâ art reflection is considered as the basis for professional development, self-regulation on the acquisition of implementing art knowledge. The formation of art reflection requires the creation and implementation of specific methods of diagnostics of future music teachersâ art reflection. The article is dedicated to the problem of developing and testing diagnostic methods of formation of future music teachersâ art reflection. While writing the article there methods of analysis, synthesis, method of systematization of the material, the principles of objectivity and scientific character are being used. Diagnostics and analysis of the levels of future music teachersâ art reflection shows that the vast majority of students have art reflection at a satisfactory level (67.24%. 22.41% of students are found to have the initial level of formation of art reflection. Only 10.34% of students are found to have the sufficient level of art reflection. There are no students having the optimal level of art reflection. The author concluded that educational and behavior tasks, which the future music teachers have, are identified while testing the features of formation of future music teachersâ art reflection. They cause picking out the most appropriate areas and focus on the most prospective and effective methods of formation in the course of\n\nScience-Based Thematic Cultural Art Learning in Primary School (2013 Curriculum\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWarih Handayaningrum\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This study is aimed at discussing the development result of thematic cultural art subjectâs learning material based on science for primary school (2013 curriculum. This study is expected to inspire teacher to develop learning material that may explore artworks exist in our living environment (based on the context of childrenâs environment. This study applies steps in developmental research collaboration by Borg & Gall (1989 and Puslitjaknov (2008 to create the product. The development stages comprise observation in several primary schools in Surabaya, Gresik, and Sidoarjo that has implemented 2013 curriculum that is followed up by stages of development. Furthermore, prototype of cultural and art thematic learning material development results are verified by learning material experts, material expert, primary school teacher, and revised afterwards. The result of this research development is a set of teacher and student books. Science-based cultural art here means cultural art learning as the main medium to introduce local culture products (music, drawing, dance, and drama by integrating mathematics, sciences, Bahasa Indonesia, and local language subjects. Cultural art products in the form of dance, music, drawing, dramas will help children to understand a simple mathematical concept, such as: two-dimensional figure, geometry, comparing or estimating longer-shorter, smaller-bigger, or more-less.\n\nInteractive Technologies in Musical and Arts Education\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nY. Y. Glazyrina\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper substantiates the introduction of interactive techniquesÂ in music and arts education, and analyzes the definitions of interactivityÂ â a key term of the modern educational paradigm. Various interpretationsof interactivity and its components â interaction, communication, dia logue, polylogue, interpretation, reinterpretation, intonation, feelings, comprehension, generalization (reflection, and experience â are given. In the methodology context, the author traces out the similarity of interactive concepts in general didactics and the humanities knowledge (M. M. Bakhtin, V. S. Bibler, and maintains that the main components of interactive teaching include the basic categories of culture, art, music, and psychology of artistic perception and creativity. Therefore, similarity of the content and approach to interpreting the conceptual terminological apparatus of interactive education makes it possible to implement the interactive techniques in teaching the cycle of music and arts disciplines.\n\nArtful terms: A study on aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAugustin, M Dorothee; Carbon, Claus-Christian; Wagemans, Johan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDespite the importance of the arts in human life, psychologists still know relatively little about what characterises their experience for the recipient. The current research approaches this problem by studying people's word usage in aesthetics, with a focus on three important art forms: visual art, film, and music. The starting point was a list of 77 words known to be useful to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art (Augustin et al 2012, Acta Psychologica 139 187â201). Focusing on ratings of likelihood of use, we examined to what extent word usage in aesthetic descriptions of visual art can be generalised to film and music. The results support the claim of an interplay of generality and specificity in aesthetic word usage. Terms with equal likelihood of use for all art forms included beautiful, wonderful, and terms denoting originality. Importantly, emotion-related words received higher ratings for film and music than for visual art. To our knowledge this is direct evidence that aesthetic experiences of visual art may be less affectively loaded than, for example, experiences of music. The results render important information about aesthetic word usage in the realm of the arts and may serve as a starting point to develop tailored measurement instruments for different art forms.

In 2011 the authors formed the research group 'Ethology of the Arts' concentrating on the evolution and biology of perception and behaviour. These novel approaches aim at a better understanding of the various facets represented by the arts by taking into focus possible phylogenetic adaptations, which have shaped the artistic capacities of our ancestors. Rather than culture specificity, which is stressed e.g. by cultural anthropology and numerous other disciplines, universal human tendencies to perceive, feel, think and behave are postulated. Artistic expressive behaviour is understood as an integral part of the human condition, whether expressed in ritual, visual, verbal or musical art. The Ethology of the Arts-group's research focuses on visual and verbal art, music and built environment/architecture and is designed to contribute to the incipient interdisciplinarity in the field of evolutionary art research.\n\nJazz: An Afro-American Art Music.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGriffin, Marie P.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nDiscussion of roots of jazz--form of art music which originated in United States through confrontation of blacks with European music--highlights jazz styles and stylists, blues, ragtime, dixieland, big bands, bop, cool jazz, modern jazz, jazz recording, jazz discography, and jazz collection in the library.

This article considers the international educational significance of western art music from the perspective of transnational undergraduate teaching, based on the authorâs experience of working at KM Music Conservatory in Chennai, India.Â A summary of art musicâs problematic role in contemporary Western society leads to consideration of the global expansion of Western art music as practice and academic discipline. The reflective discussion focuses on several core pedagogical issues associated with the teaching of Western classical music in a non-Western environment, particularly the relevance of the historical contexts of colonialism and post-colonialism in shaping the meanings of the art form in present-day India.\n\nArt Music by Caribbean Composers: Guadeloupe\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGangelhoff, Christine\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Guadeloupe retains more than its colonial and cultural roots from France.

At the beginning of the 20th century Emil Jaques-Dalcroze, who is regarded as the creator of Eyrhythmics, discovered that movement should be the basis for music education. The father of Eyrhythmics referred to a common human activity - movement - and by linking it with music, he laid the foundation of methodology of music education. Eurhythmics has become one of the popular methods of arts education but, first of all, a versatile system of music education, which allows acomplishement of true expression. The Dalcroze's approach to music education established the foundation of an understanding of music through movement-motion. Music expressed through the natural and simple language of human body's movements leads to a personal fuller experience of music through motion, enables a deeper feeling of music, a better understanding and discovering its beauty. Dalcroze considered that the qualities of music were fundamental forces in human life, and emphasized musicâs connection to other arts, such as dance, drama, poetry, and particularly singing, which all are fundamental human activities involving movement, language and emotion.\n\nEngaging Researchers with the World's First Scholarly Arts Repositories: Ten Years after the UK's Kultur Project\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeece, Stephanie; Robinson, Amy; Gramstadt, Marie-Therese\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOpen access institutional repositories can be ill-equipped to manage the complexity of research outputs from departments of fine arts, media, drama, music, cultural heritage, and the creative arts in general.

The purpose of the study is the selection and analysis of such gender definitions of music as ender dimension, gender roles, gender approach, the gender component in the system of music education. Methodology of the study is based on the interdisciplinary approach that involves the use of scientific methods of analysis, synthesis and synthesis. Also, there is the method of comparative analysis and analogy applied in understanding the problems related to the study of gender influence in art and education. Originality is reflected in modern educational concept that appeals to the understanding of gender issues as a way of more thorough understanding of individuals, their role status of the individual, which in turn defines social opportunities in educational activities. Accordingly, the modern science can not remain uninvolved into the problems of modern times. Conclusions. Studies of gender in musical art education leads to selection, analyzis and understanding of such definitions as: gender dimension, which is focused on the understanding of the principle of obtaining polysynthetic, gender sensation from a musical work; gender roles, which distinguish representation of women in different kinds of music; gender approach, which establishes the availability of gender imbalance in the system of music education; gender component, which distinguishes the importance of understanding and practical implementation of gender equality in the system of music education.\n\nMobile Urban Drama - Interactive Storytelling in Real World Environments\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHansen, Frank Allan; Kortbek, Karen Johanne; GrÃ¸nbÃ¦k, Kaj\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMobile Urban Dramas.

We hypothesize that live music and dance drama provide a powerful technology to overcome barriers such as illiteracy, lack of adequate media access, inadequate health resources, and entrenched sociocultural attitudes. Our research objective is to evaluate this claim. Methods: In this first phase, we evaluated the effectiveness of arts interventions in improving knowledge and behaviors associated with reduced incidence of malaria and cholera, focusing on basic information and simple practices, such as proper hand washing. Working with the Youth Home Cultural Group, we codeveloped two âdance dramasâ delivering health messages through dialog, lyrics, and drama, using music and dance to attract spectators, focus attention, infuse emotion, and socialize impact. We also designed knowledge, attitude, and behavior surveys as measurement instruments. Using purposive sampling, we selected three contrasting test villages in the vicinity, contrasting in size and demographics. With cooperation of chiefs, elders, elected officials, and Ghana Health Service officers, we conducted a baseline survey in each village. Next, we performed the interventions, and subsequently conducted follow-up surveys. Using a more qualitative approach, we also tracked a select subgroup, conducted focus group studies, and collected testimonials. Surveys were coded and data were analyzed by Epi Info. Results: Both quantitative and qualitative methods indicated that those who attended the dance drama performances were likelier than those who did not attend to list the causal, preventive, and transmission factors of malaria and cholera. Also, the same attendees were likelier than nonattendees to list some activities they do to prevent malaria, cholera, and other sanitation\n\nAmbijentalna muzika kao praksa popularne umetnosti / Ambient Music as Popular Art Practice\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIvana AnÄiÄ\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper considers ambient music in a comparative perspective. Taking the 1950s as a mirror time axis, I suggest comparing Erik Satieâs ideas on Furniture music (1920s to Brian Enoâs notions of ambient music (1970s onwards. Satie is considered as the father of ambient music as he was among the first people aware of the interconnection of music and ambient sounds. Music that Brian Eno creates almost thirty years later has deep roots in Satieâs concept of implementation of ambiental music, which means that the music âshould last and represent the environmentâ (Brian Eno, âAmbient Musicâ, 2014. Ambiental musicâs theoretical foundations can be compared to American Minimalist and environmental art. Consideration of the audio perception phenomena is also very important for understanding and Adornoâs interpretation of the term regressive listening that will be explored later in this paper. This is an attempt to study the artistic side of ambient music, which has a wide scope of applications beyond the art sphere. In this respect, I will try to state the differences between ambient music as an art intermission in our everyday life and ambient music as a control device over human behavior.\n\nThe elementary school musical as an authentic, integrated performing arts experience\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBespflug, Kevin Sean\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWhile musicals are often common arts activities in high schools in North America, little has been written about their place in elementary schools.

Painting and music are then poetical guidance for Burne-Jonesâ manifestation of love. Maria is Burne-Jonesâ model, muse, and sorceress.

Using data from a nationally representative sample (N = 299) of U.S. substance abuse treatment programs, this study modeled organizational factors falling in the domains of patient characteristics, treatment ideologies, and structural characteristics, associated with the use of art therapy and music therapy. We found that 36.8% of treatment programs offered art therapy and 14.7% of programs offered music therapy. Programs with a greater proportion of women were more likely to use both therapies, and programs with larger proportions of adolescents were more likely to offer music therapy. In terms of other treatment ideologies, programsâ use of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) was positively related to offering art therapy, while use of Contingency Management (CM) was positively associated with offering music therapy. Finally, our findings showed a significant relationship between requiring 12-step meetings and the use of both art therapy and music therapy. With increasing use of CAM in a diverse range of medical settings, and recent federal legislation likely to reduce barriers in accessing CAM, the inclusion of CAM in addiction treatment is growing in importance.

Using data from a nationally representative sample (N = 299) of U.S. substance abuse treatment programs, this study modeled organizational factors falling in the domains of patient characteristics, treatment ideologies, and structural characteristics, associated with the use of art therapy and music therapy. We found that 36.8% of treatment programs offered art therapy and 14.7% of programs offered music therapy. Programs with a greater proportion of women were more likely to use both therapies, and programs with larger proportions of adolescents were more likely to offer music therapy. In terms of other treatment ideologies, programs' use of Motivational Enhancement Therapy was positively related to offering art therapy, whereas use of contingency management was positively associated with offering music therapy. Finally, our findings showed a significant relationship between requiring 12-step meetings and the use of both art therapy and music therapy. With increasing use of CAM in a diverse range of medical settings and recent federal legislation likely to reduce barriers in accessing CAM, the inclusion of CAM in addiction treatment is growing in importance. Our findings suggest treatment programs may be utilizing art and music therapies to address unique patient needs of women and adolescents.\n\nGuerilla Science: Outreach at music and art festival\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRosin, Mark\n\n2012-10-01\n\nGuerilla Science a non-profit science education organization that, since 2007, has brought live events to unconventional venues for science, such as music festivals, art galleries, banquets, department stores and theaters. Guerilla Science sets science free by taking it out of the lab and into the traditional domains of the arts. By producing events that mix science with art, music and play, they create unique opportunities for adult audiences to experience science in unorthodox ways, such as interactive events, games, live experiments, demonstrations and performances by academics, artists, musicians, actors, and professional science communicators. Much of Guerilla Science's work has focused on astrophysical and terrestrial plasmas, and this presentation will provide an overview of Guerilla Science's work in this area. Guerilla Science has produced over twenty events, receiving international media coverage, and directly reached over fifteen thousand members of the public.\n\nINTEGRATING ARTS IN EFL CURRICULA: A FOCUS ON LANGUAGE LISTENING SKILLS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMetin TÄ°MUÃÄ°N\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Arts are commonly used in primary and secondary classrooms for learning purposes, but arts integration in higher education curricula could benefit university-level students academically and emotionally as well. Integrating arts into an English as a Foreign Language (EFL curriculum could benefit students who experience foreign language anxiety, which hinders them from being socially and linguistically successful in the classroom according to multiple studies outlined in the literature section. The focus for students in this study was on listening skills because it is a major element in foreign language development that is explored to a lesser degree than reading, writing and speaking skills. The eight introductory-level classes were split between control and experimental classes. During the first part of the arts implementation, the experimental classes began with drama theatre for 30 minutes. This consisted of students taking a theme in English, such as home and directions, then creating a creative performance for their peers involving relevant vocabulary and phrases. The second part consisted of a 15 minute music cloze section, where students were filling in lyrics for a song that they were actively listening to. Two academic assessments were given as department-wide mid-term and final academic assessments, two subjective surveys and the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS were given at the beginning and end of the school semester. The FLCAS determined that studentsâ anxieties lowered on 15 questions and increased on 18 questions, so the arts integration has not notably altered foreign language anxiety. The arts-integrated classes received average scores of 80.5%, while the control classes received 74%. Students have performed higher academically with an arts integrated curriculum. It is therefore recommended that arts in the form of music cloze and drama theatre should be included in EFL curricula to increase academic achievement\n\nTALENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD OF CLASSICAL MUSIC AND VISUAL ARTS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLinda Jarvin\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available In this article, we propose to explore the developmental trajectories of children displaying gifts and abilities in the domains of (classical music and in visual arts.

After an initial selection of abstracts from seven databases (keywords: pleasure, reward, enjoyment, and hedonic), twenty music and eleven visual-art papers were systematically compared. The following questions were addressed: (1) What is the role of the keyword in the research question? (2) Is pleasure considered a result of variation in the perceiver's internal or external attributes? (3) What are the most commonly employed methods and main variables in empirical settings? Based on these questions, our critical integrative analysis aimed to identify which themes and processes emerged as key features for conceptualizing art-induced pleasure. The results demonstrated great variance in how pleasure has been approached: In the music studies pleasure was often a clear object of investigation, whereas in the visual-art studies the term was often embedded into the context of an aesthetic experience, or used otherwise in a descriptive, indirect sense. Music studies often targeted different emotions, their intensity or anhedonia. Biographical and background variables and personality traits of the perceiver were often measured. Next to behavioral methods, a common method was brain imaging which often targeted the reward circuitry of the brain in response to music. Visual-art pleasure was also frequently addressed using brain imaging methods, but the research focused on sensory cortices rather than the reward circuit alone. Compared with music research, visual-art research investigated more frequently pleasure in relation to conscious, cognitive processing, where the variations of stimulus features and the changing of viewing modes were regarded as explanatory factors of the derived experience. Despite valence being frequently applied in both domains, we conclude, that in empirical music research pleasure\n\nMusic teaching as a profession.

Exploring the possibility of crossmodal similarities between music and visual arts\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nActis-Grosso Rossana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available According to both experimental research and common sense, classical music is a better fit for figurative art than jazz. We hypothesize that similar fits may reflect underlying crossmodal structural similarities between music and painting genres. We present two preliminary studies aimed at addressing our hypothesis. Experiment 1 tested the goodness of the fit between two music genres (classical and jazz and two painting genres (figurative and abstract. Participants were presented with twenty sets of six paintings (three figurative, three abstract viewed in combination with three sound conditions: 1 silence, 2 classical music, or 3 jazz. While figurative paintings scored higher aesthetic appreciation than abstract ones, a gender effect was also found: the aesthetic appreciation of paintings in male participants was modulated by music genre, whilst music genre did not affect the aesthetic appreciation in female participants. Our results support only in part the notion that classical music enhances the aesthetic appreciation of figurative art. Experiment 2 aimed at testing whether the conceptual categories âfigurativeâ and âabstractâ can be extended also to music. In session 1, participants were first asked to classify 30 paintings (10 abstract, 10 figurative, 10 ambiguous that could fit either category as abstract or figurative and then to rate them for pleasantness; in session 2 participants were asked to classify 40 excerpts of music (20 classical, 20 jazz as abstract or figurative and to rate them for pleasantness. Paintings which were clearly abstract or figurative were all classified accordingly, while the majority of ambiguous paintings were classified as abstract. Results also show a gender effect for paintingâs pleasantness: female participants rated higher ambiguous and abstract paintings. More interestingly, results show an effect of music genre on classification, showing that it is possible to classify music as figurative or\n\nArt Education, The Art of Education and the Art of Life: Considering the Implications of Dewey's Later Philosophy to Art and Music Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVakeva, Lauri\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis article offers a clarification and application of aspects of John Dewey's philosophy of art and music that have often been misunderstood, even by philosophers (such as Susanne Langer) and, in particular, by philosophers of music education who quote Dewey in support of neo-Kantian aesthetic conceptions that Dewey was in fact at pains toâ¦\n\nAn education in complexity: The role of contemporary art music\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRaffaele Pozzi\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper provides some thoughts on the role of contemporary art music in the pedagogy of complexity. Today, theories of complexity are an area of thought that is largely established in the humanities and social sciences. They emphasize the importance of notions such as discontinuity, contradiction, non-linearity, multiplicity, randomness, and chaos in natural and cultural phenomena. The French epistemologist Edgar Morin, in a series of recent publications, has developed a pedagogy based on the theory of complexity. Contemporary art music contains a large repertoire of works, on which to build a pedagogy and didactics of complexity in music. The paper gives an example of use and didactic transposition of a piece, B.A.C.H. for solo piano (1970, by Italian composer Aldo Clementi.\n\nAesthetic Emotions Across Arts: A Comparison Between Painting and Music\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMiu, Andrei C.; PiÈur, Simina; SzentÃ¡gotai-TÄtar, Aurora\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEmotional responses to art have long been subject of debate, but only recently have they started to be investigated in affective science. The aim of this study was to compare perceptions regarding frequency of aesthetic emotions, contributing factors, and motivation which characterize the experiences of looking at painting and listening to music. Parallel surveys were filled in online by participants (N = 971) interested in music and painting. By comparing self-reported characteristics of these experiences, this study found that compared to listening to music, looking at painting was associated with increased frequency of wonder and decreased frequencies of joyful activation and power. In addition to increased vitality, as reflected by the latter two emotions, listening to music was also more frequently associated with emotions such as tenderness, nostalgia, peacefulness, and sadness. Compared to painting-related emotions, music-related emotions were perceived as more similar to emotions in other everyday life situations. Participants reported that stimulus features and previous knowledge made more important contributions to emotional responses to painting, whereas prior mood, physical context and the presence of other people were considered more important in relation to emotional responses to music. Self-education motivation was more frequently associated with looking at painting, whereas mood repair and keeping company motivations were reported more frequently in relation to listening to music. Participants with visual arts education reported increased vitality-related emotions in their experience of looking at painting. In contrast, no relation was found between music education and emotional responses to music. These findings offer a more general perspective on aesthetic emotions and encourage integrative research linking different types of aesthetic experience.

Investigations into teachersâ first experience in school indicate that the transition from university life to professional life is not smooth for teachers. In the arts, the adjustment seems to be even more complex (De Vugt, 2013. Artistically well-trained university graduates seem to have difficulty in applying their knowledge and artistic skills. Career crashes and a shortage of music teachers in Austria are some of the consequences (Bailer, 2009. Recently I commenced the Grounded Theory Study, mentoring in music, investigating how mentors act in the induction phase, as well as how mentees cope with it. Narrative interviews beyond mentors and mentees, expert interviews, as well as group discussions with mentor teams, show that mentoring in music education has to find ways to support trainee teachersâ transition between art and pedagogy since they are two fundamentally different practices (Benner, 2001. In this article, I present and discuss two main results of the study: First I show the multilayered status passage (Glaser & Strauss, 1971 that music teacher novices move through from their identity as music students to their identity as music teachers in schools. Second, I suggest and discuss four types of music teacher novices who cope with this status passage in music education differently and how they can be supported by mentors\n\nTeaching performance in performative arts.

On the one hand, the moralist view contends that there is some sort of link between art and morality, even if the way to specify this link may be highly diverse. It comprises most of the classical views of art, from Schiller's view of the role of artistic education in moral development, to any view that declares a form of art as corrupt or degenerated, or enlightening. What it is assumed minimally in all of them is that the moral import of an artwork contributes to its aesthetic value. On the other hand, formalist views claim that the aesthetic value of an artwork is genuine and autonomous, and therefore it is independent of any other value. In this chapter we focus on music, as the most difficult case for the moralist standpoint, given the lack of representational content of music. We argue for a variety of the moralist's view according to which the moral import of a musical artwork is not derived from its content (obviously, as it lack any), but from its pragmatics: the context and the intentions that guide its composition and performance, by analogy with any other intentional action, and point to the emotional impact of music as the common ground that bridges moral and aesthetic values. As a provisional conclusion, we outline a research program for brain studies that follows from this proposal, as a way test its predictions, focusing both on the emotional grounds of valuation and their context-dependency.

Gallardo-Saborido\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Culture, particularly cinema, drama and music, played a key role in order to keep and reinforce the identity of Spanish migrants in Argentina and Mexico during the first part of the 20th century. For decades, these countries had received thousands of migrants from Spain, and by the period following the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939 a notable colony of them settled in Buenos Aires and Mexico City. At the same time, several artists arrived to these places escaping from the war, political repression or, simply, looking for new work opportunities. For instance, famous singers, actors and flamenco players and dancers (v.g. Miguel de Molina, Angelillo, NiÃ±o de Utrera, or Sabicas achieved overwhelming successes in Buenos Aires and Mexico Cityâs theatres. Even more, they created a parallel Spanish stardom abroad. Hence, this proposal summarizes the contribution of some of these artists and the fusion between theatre and cinema, and typical Andalusian music as flamenco to preserve and evoke the collective memory of such a faraway motherland. Since Andalusia (the Southern region of Spain and its culture acted as a metonymic resource to represent that country during that period, migrants from different regions could recognize a common notion of the Spanish identity in them. In this sense, âhomeâ could be staged, remembered, fictionalized and, obviously, idealized.\n\nDiscovering the Lost Ark of Possibilities: Bringing Visibility to the Invisible Art Form of Film Music in Your Music Classroom\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKeown, Daniel J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nConventional music learning in schools could benefit from the study of the music from films, television, and video games.

McNealy\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available âAttention spans have shortened,â is a common phrase often used in reference to todayâs college students. As faculty and instructors, we need to address this issue through the utilization of innovative and creative techniques that aid in making our subjects accessible to our students. Connecting a serious topic such as microbiology with a âfunâ activity can increase student engagement and learning. Ideas to maintain student attention on a subject include providing information in 15- to 20-minute blocks, giving one- to two-minute assignments, and providing an active learning activity at least once per hour. But what if we could also increase their engagement with science by connecting it to things they already think of outside of class, and, in addition, make science thinking interdisciplinary? I have recently introduced exercises that connect music and art to various microbiology topics in my class. The creative processes in art and science have much in common. Albert Einstein recognized that both science and art delve into the mysterious by stating, âThe most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all scienceâ (1. Connecting these subjects in the minds of our students will help them realize the importance of technology, industry, and progress in science and simultaneously emphasize the importance of art, music, and the humanities. The tools presented here will encourage students to connect new science information through the music and art they already know and, therefore, provide increased engagement and retention of the new knowledge. These techniques used in a microbiology class increased the amount of time spent thinking about new information, increased engagement with the information being presented, and encouraged critical thinking of microbiology topics. These tools were used in an upper level microbiology course, but the techniques can be easily incorporated into any course\n\nA Deeper Glimpse into the National Core Arts Standards for General Music\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZaffini, Erin Dineen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe National Core Arts Standards in general music provide some exciting possibilities for music growth and understanding among our students.
