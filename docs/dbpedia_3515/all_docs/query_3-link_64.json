        "text": "The fourth film in the Kino Quickies season, screened on April 24th 2022, was Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street from 1936.\n\nDirected by George \"King of the Quickies\" King and starring Tod Slaughter, it's the well known story of the murderous barber who polishes off his victims who are then processed into pie filling by his next door neighbour. Yum!\n\nOur specially invited expert guest for the post show Q&A, Jade Evans, had a minor disaster the night before the screening when she tested positive for the dreaded Covid. Luckily, we had the technology to enable her to attend remotely via the wonders of the internet and the sound quality was only slightly affected.\n\nFollow Jade on Twitter or Instagram and find links to her research HERE.\n\nYour hosts are Dom Delargy and Dr Lawrence Napper\n\nNone of the prints of Sweeney Todd, as far as we can tell, are in perfect condition but if you'd like to watch a scratchy copy online, you can do that HERE.\n\nAnd this British Pathe short feature starring Tod Slaughter is hoot!\n\nBook tickets for any of the films in the Kino Quickies season HERE\n\nSubscribe to our other film related podcast, Soho Bites.\n\nOn April 7th, our very own Lawrence Napper gave an online talk for Westminster Libraries called, Quota Quickies: the worst films ever made? If you missed it, all is not lost as it will soon be posted to YouTube. Watch this space for more details.\n\nFollow Lawrence on Twitter\n\nFollow Kino Quickies on Twitter and Facebook for updates.\n\nHere's a very good article explaining what Quota Quickies are from the Cinema History Blog\n\nWell that was fascinating but now I want to find out more\n\nDonâ€™t forget to subscribe to the Kino Quickies podcast. It comes out a couple of days after each screening.\n\nThey don't just screen ninety year old films at the Kino - they show recent ones too!
