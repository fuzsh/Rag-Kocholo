When did Algiers Become the Capital?

Algiers became the capital of Algeria on July 4, 1830, when the French, led by General Bourmont, captured the city following a supposed insult to their consulate. The French were victorious, and Algiers subsequently emerged as the main city in French-controlled Algeria. With the dawn of the 20th century, a significant influx of Europeans moved to Algeria, soon constituting the majority of Algiers’ urban population.

This status of Algiers was retained even after the hard-fought Algerian War of Independence. In 1962, following a brutal conflict that cost hundreds of thousands of lives (primarily Algerians), Algeria achieved its independence, yet Algiers persisted as its capital.

Algiers, the capital city, was also the epicenter of demands for a genuine democracy and the termination of the single-party rule. The authorities initially suppressed these protests, but they nonetheless marked a turning point in Algeria’s recent political history. Subsequently, in 1989, a new constitution was enacted that terminated the single-party rule, paved the way for more than eight political parties, and ensured press freedom.

History of Algiers

Algiers, or Al-Jazā’ir in Arabic, is Algeria’s capital and a key city in North Africa. Its history is long and complex, with influences from various empires and cultures.

People have lived in the Algiers area since around 1000 BC, starting with the Berber people. Then came the Phoenicians and Romans. It became a city under Roman rule in the 3rd century BC, and later a Germanic group, the Vandals, took over.

In the 10th century, the Berbers revived Algiers under the Zirid dynasty, and it was named Bologhine. It grew considerably during the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, becoming a center for trade and pirates.

In 1830, the French took over Algiers and it became the center of French Algeria. The city changed a lot under French rule, with new buildings and roads being built. After a long and violent war, Algeria became independent of France in 1962, and Algiers was chosen as the capital.

Today, Algiers is a lively city with a mix of different styles in its architecture, from the Ottoman and Andalusian styles in the Kasbah quarter to the French colonial buildings. It’s the political, economic, and cultural center of Algeria.
