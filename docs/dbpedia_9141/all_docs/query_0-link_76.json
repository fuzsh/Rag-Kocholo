IT WAS A WAR OF UNDERGROUND NETWORKS, GUNMEN, DESERTERS, POLICE INFORMERS, LIAISON AGENTS, AND DOUBLE AGENTS. EVENTUALLY THIS NEW WAR SPREAD TO FRANCE AND AFFECTED NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES--SPAIN, SWITZERLAND, AND BELGIUM. IT WAS CENTERED, HOWEVER, IN ALGERIA'S COASTAL CITIES. THE FINAL YEAR OF FRENCH ALGERIA SAW THE CULMINATION OF INCREASINGLY UNBEARABLE PRESSURES, FRUSTRATIONS, AND MISCALCULATIONS. DURING THE SUMMER OF 1961, THREE GROUPS FOUND THEMSELVES UPON A COLLISION COURSE--MOSLEMS WHO WANTED ALGERIA INDEPENDENT, EUROPEANS DETERMINED TO PREVENT IT AT ALL COST, AND THE FRENCH ARMY, WHICH WAS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. ON JULY 1, 1962, ELIGIBLE ALGERIANS VOTED FOR INDEPENDENCE. THE BOOK NARRATES THE INTRIGUE, TERROR, AND DRAMA OF THIS LAST YEAR. INCLUDED ARE A LIST OF PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS, A BIBLIOGRAPHY, A LIST OF MAJOR DATES, AND AN INDEX. (PRG)"
