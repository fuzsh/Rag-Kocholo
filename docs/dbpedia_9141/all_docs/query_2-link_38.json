        "text": "Algerian emigration did not coincide with the colonial conquest of 1830. On the contrary, Algeria became a settlement colony and a land that hundreds of thousands of Europeans (French, Spanish, Italians, Maltese) immigrated to. The implementation of the colonial system in the country, administered in the same way as French departments from 1848, considerably worsened the situation of the native populations. Impoverishment (exacerbated in rural areas), the soaring demographic growth, real estate pressure, dispossessions and lack of resources led to a dual phenomenon of rural exodus and emigration in the late 19th century.\n\nMostly Kabyle, men in the prime of life supplied labour in the towns and farms of the Mediterranean coast of mainland France, their first anchor point being the city of Marseille. They were employed as day labourers on farms, road workers, peddlers or unskilled workers.\n\nKabylia, a particularly poor region, was the main source of candidates for emigration. A veritable migration project was developed collectively by the family or the village assembly (djema’a). Men alone in France but not single, they were often married by their families before leaving, as a way to ensure their return to the village. Their wage only enabled them to survive in France, since the sums they worked so hard to save were needed to provide for their families. These young, active men were chosen to leave for a predetermined period, usually a few months, which explains the frequency of rotations between French mainland and Algerian departments (on average every two years). Once back home, they were often replaced by other young men from their village who took over their housing and even their job. Migrant workers from Algeria formed a real community hub in France. Based on the extended family, village or region of origin, these men joined forces and set up a network of solidarity and social interaction that facilitated access to a roof over their heads, work, news from the homeland, and the keeping of cultural or religious traditions.\n\nFor example, they worked at the Say refinery, the Compagnie des Omnibus and on the metro construction sites in Paris, the Michelin factories, mines in Pas-de-Calais, industries in Lyon, and at the docks in the port of Marseille. Management appreciated the supply of a cheap, submissive workforce, making a considerable contribution to the heavy needs of industry, and also wanted to use them to break workers’ strikes.\n\nBut it was the Great War that initiated a representative migratory movement in the direction of France. Almost 100,000 workers from Algeria, joined by 175,000 colonial soldiers, were recruited between 1914 and 1918. After the Armistice, the authorities sent all these workers and soldiers back to the colonies they came from, although a few managed to stay in France."
