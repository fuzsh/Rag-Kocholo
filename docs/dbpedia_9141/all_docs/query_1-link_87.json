        "text": "Note: The below narration is a true, first-hand account of an Algerian fighter in the 1950s. For the purpose of this story, his name has been changed.\n\nFor decades from 1830 to 1962, tales had been passed on about the stubbornness of the Algerian people. What started as a frivolous dispute between the Dey of Algiers and the French consul in 1827, a few years later, turned into a masquerade of excuses for the invasion of Algiers. In truth, it was a strategically planned and well-intended scheme to swallow the country whole. Unfortunately for the French, they failed to anticipate the continued resistance of the Algerian people, which persisted for 132 years until they regained their freedom.\n\nLast May, 60 years after Algeria was officially free of French colonial occupation, I visited my aunt’s husband in his somewhat Victorian-style study, which was decorated with old solid wood tables and brown leather sofas with rounded arms. It felt strange showing up for a scheduled tête-à-tête with a notebook and pen in hand. Growing up, my mother repeatedly told my siblings and me, “Did you know he fought for your country?” We knew, and though I was always curious to know more, I believe some stories of such weight are better told with purpose. On this particular day, I sat down with 84-year-old Moktar, my dear uncle, and one of the thousands of freedom fighters (mujahideen), one of a small number who are still alive today to finally hear his story.\n\n“You can ask me questions, and I’ll answer whatever you’d like me to,” Moktar tells me as he leans a bit closer to the edge of the couch as though he needs to physically ready himself for this discussion. With two cups of atay (mint tea) in front of us and a plate of sweets, we both don’t bother with either and instead, jump right into the subject at hand.\n\nFor years I’ve been fascinated with the iconic war of independence of my country, and I almost felt a perhaps misplaced sense of guilt for not having lived through it or contributed to it. My only way of rectifying this sentiment, I reckoned, was to help carry on some its stories if I could. I was nervous; I was not an expert on the matter, and I, too, leaned closer to the edge of my seat mirroring his body language. Naturally, I thought the best place to start was at the beginning, and so I asked him to tell me about the very early years of his life.\n\nHe took a deep breath, “I started getting involved with the revolution at the age of 16”.\n\nI couldn’t help but think that his graceful side-step of the question was almost like he deemed the start of his life to be the day he was old enough to fight for his country. No other reference was made to a single day earlier than that. I didn’t bring it up again.\n\nWith pride, he goes on to explain that in 1954, in parallel with the declaration of Algeria’s War of Independence (a bloody 8-year revolution) he began dabbling in the liberation movement.\n\n“My friends and I joined the National Liberation Front (FLN) and we took on small tasks such as printing and distributing leaflets, delivering things, and helping with the communication flow,” he starts.\n\nIn the neighborhood where Moktar lived, El Mouradia, there was a collective nationalistic spirit and willingness to fight back from a young age without exception. Hearing him recount how he watched his French next-door neighbors enjoy rights he himself did not have in his own country, it was clear that coexistence was not an option.\n\n“When I left Algiers for Constantine in 1956 to continue my studies at an institute, the French police arrested me and three of my friends when they became suspicious of our activities,” he tells me, “they starved us for five days as they searched for proof of our involvement in the revolution. As we waited there in the cell, I wrote a small poem.”\n\nA smirk appears on his face, and mine, as he gives me the first glimpse into his life at that age beyond the revolution. Moktar was a lover of poetry, literature, and the written word. In his later years, he went on to work in journalism and write a book.\n\nWith that smirk, he carries on, “I wrote a poem that said:\n\nمساجين ينتظرون اكلاً\n\nفكان حضهم البطاطيسُ\n\nفسيمتها سوداء تنبؤهم بما فيها\n\nمن المرض الوبائي المفلس\n\nThe prisoners waiting to be fed,\n\ntheir luck was nothing but potatoes,\n\ntheir features are that of darkness,\n\nthat foretell of coming epidemics and doom\n\nThough he reveals very little of himself beyond the topic of Algeria’s fight for freedom, I valued this very brief slip of a moment.\n\nEventually, Moktar and his peers were released after a few days with a warning, and each one headed his own way. At this point, his madrasa (secondary school) was shut down, and young boys were more inclined than ever to join the war for independence.\n\nI quickly took the opportunity to ask about what his education experience was like under French rule. He pauses for a long moment, and I sit in anticipation.\n\n“France didn’t educate the Algerian population,” he says much more seriously. “Even though some Algerians studied in French schools, many chose not to study in their language. They went to Arabic madrasas instead,” he says, which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies, but were not officially recognized by the colonial state.\n\nThough his composure remains the same, Moktar’s tone gives away a hint of anger.\n\n“Some 86% of Algerians were deprived of school. The 4-5% that were studying in state-run French schools were thrown out once they reach le certificat d’études.” This certificate is the equivalent of a primary school level diploma, usually for those between the ages of eleven to thirteen.\n\n“The French were closing down all the madrasas they found out about. By 1954, there were only some 500 Algerians at the university level. They left our people illiterate.”\n\nI sat in suppressed shock at this statistic. Depriving one of an education is simply malicious. Depriving a whole population of education is an extremely dangerous form of oppression.\n\nHere, I noticed his skill of moving on swiftly without dwelling too much on any specific detail – perhaps to make sure the story is palatable. He delves into the next chapter.\n\nFollowing his release from a small spell in jail at the end of 1957, Moktar was assigned the task of helping strengthen the position of the mujahideen (freedom fighters) in the wilaya (state) of Algiers. Revolutionists carved Algeria into 6 wilayas as autonomous zones during this period with a guerrilla commander in charge of each one.\n\n“When the police released me, I initially went to Setif, wilaya number 3, to pick up arms and fight. But since I grew up in Algiers and knew the city very well, I was asked to go join the movement in the capital. There, I helped my fellow mujahideen organize riots, plan bomb attacks, secretly gather weapons, and so on. Charles De Gaulle was due to visit Algeria in the summer of 1958, and we had to make sure we were seen.”\n\nOn June 4th of 1958, a few days after Charles De Gaulle’s return to power following his 12-year absence, he spoke in front of a crowd in Algiers where he famously uttered the ambiguous words, “Je vous ai compris!” – “I understood you”. This came after months of continuous violent unrest in the capital. Some think he was reassuring colonists or French settlers that French Algeria will prevail, and others wondered if it was his way of coming to terms with the fact that the Algerian resistance would never end. To this day, nobody is really sure, but I like to think it was the latter.\n\nHe chose not to elaborate further on the specifics of the FLN’s guerrilla warfare tactics, but he offered a justification despite not owing me one.\n\n“It’s easy to claim that things can be solved through talking. But freedom demands a revolution.” I know he meant that there was no way for things to remain nonviolent. It was very hard not to agree.\n\nLater that year, back in Setif, as Moktar carried on with his usual activities, he was captured by the French army and tortured for one month at a military barrack.\n\nBefore he continued, I remember feeling that this isn’t something he recounts often. Not for self-preservation or because it’s too difficult for him to rehash, but I got the impression that he thought it too selfish to make such a significant event about his own individual struggle.\n\n“I was taken back to Algiers where the torture continued for another 3 months,” he says, “I was passed on between the police and the army. They put me in a dungeon and put wires on me and used electric shock.”\n\nFrance’s systemic use of torture through methods such as electrocution, beatings, waterboarding, starvation, and deprivation of water are no secret. Movies were made, books were written, and today, conversations are still being held about how inhumane the French military acted towards Algerians, or “les Arabes” as they were referred to. However, it wasn’t until a few years ago that France formally acknowledged the use of torture during Algeria’s war of resistance between 1954-1962. But this brief acknowledgment was never followed with any repentance.\n\nAfter 3 months, when Moktar’s wounds healed, he was sent to Barberousse Prison, later known as Serkadji Prison. “Do you know it? You’ve heard of it?” he asks. Enthralled by the story, I say yes without thinking when I intend to say no.\n\nThankfully he proceeded to tell me, “It sits just on top of La Casbah, it’s extremely secure and difficult to penetrate. That’s where they use the guillotine. If you’re sentenced to death, they’ll pick you up one day and you’re executed in the main courtyard.”\n\n“I remained in Serkadji for four years.”\n\nI’m astonished at how long he was imprisoned in comparison to what I had assumed. He politely lets me interrupt as I ask him in more than one way to describe how it was. Was he alone? Was he tortured? Did he lose hope? Did he ever get news about the revolution from the outside?\n\n“We were usually in numbers in a hall, but every now and then we get taken to separate cells. I wasn’t tortured there like before, but it was a different type of torture in Serkadji – they would starve you or put you in isolation for long periods. It was psychological.”\n\nEven though we were alone behind closed doors the whole sitting, somehow even more noise was drowned out while hearing him finally talk about his days in prison. He was sentenced to 20 years, and was on the execution list twice.\n\nWithin the confines of the prison, Moktar and his fellow mujahideen tried to remain as organized, useful, and prepared as possible. Visitors, mostly women, passed on information from the outside to prisoners in Serkadji and vice versa.\n\n“I have to tell you something…one day I escaped with 26 others by digging our way underground and using ropes to lower ourselves through a small cavity. When the last group was making their escape,” he says wistfully with a small pause, “the last guy, may God rest his soul, was seen by a security guard and shot right then and there. He died a martyr. They named a road after him – you know the one near your grandmother’s house.” He seemed genuinely pained.\n\n“We didn’t escape to live. We escaped to continue fighting for freedom.”\n\nHis escape was in February of 1962, but he was captured again a few weeks later and put back in Serkadji. Curious to know how, he told me, “people talk.” The French settlers were scattered across the country; they were the shopkeepers, your next-door neighbors, teachers, bus drivers, your day-to-day pedestrians. They were always on alert for a mujahid.\n\nOn the 4th of April 1962, he was finally released for good in accordance with the Evian Accords which included an agreement of a cease-fire, the release of prisoners, and the full sovereignty of Algeria.\n\nDuring his time in prison, he told me his faith in the revolution remained resolute. I could sense, 60 years later, the unshakeable desire for a free Algeria, nothing less.\n\n“During the negotiations, France tried everything to keep at least a piece of our country. They wanted to keep the Sahara or even split the country into different regions to weaken us. We told them Algeria will not be split. And would not give them even one grain of soil,”, he says with pride. I love this line, and I smile.\n\nAll my life, Moktar was one of the most gentle, and kind-hearted men I knew. How did the colonization and torture and imprisonment not harden him?\n\nI was conscious of his lack of victimization throughout his narrative, but I was still compelled to ask whether he is angry with what he was put through.\n\nHis demeanor changed. “Look, we did our duty. We liberated our country. Al Hamdulilah. It was a big injustice and suffering, but we weren’t scared. Not a single person joined the revolution with the intention of staying alive. Even the mothers of the mujahideen knew this. It was either freedom or death.”\n\nHe didn’t answer my question, but I got my answer.\n\nI drew a parallel to present-day Palestine, and their continuous fight against the Israeli occupation. Why does Algeria have such a unique fraternal bond with Palestinians?\n\n“Because Algerians know the value of freedom. We know the true meaning of martyrdom,” he answered me with ease. “Colonization isn’t just fighting against weapons and an army. It’s cultural, it’s mental, it’s moral. Algerians will always stand up for Palestine and anyone for that matter who is fighting for their freedom and for the preservation of their culture, heritage, and values.”\n\nWe see Algeria in Palestine. He agreed, “And it too will be free one day.”\n\nToday, Algeria is known as the country of one and a half million martyrs. Moktar reminds me during our sit down that the 1.5 million Algerians were killed between 1954 and 1962 alone. This is excluding the 122 years prior. It’s difficult to fathom the total number of lives lost to the French occupation and colonization.\n\n“The youngest mujahid is 80 years old now you know, most of us are gone,” he tells me, “but the spirit of the revolution stays. Just look at you - you are proof that young people are trying to keep the stories of our fight for freedom alive.”\n\nAs we near the end of our conversation, I felt humbled to be hearing the story of one of the millions who put their life on the line for me to have a free country today.\n\nWe’re just finishing up, but he put in a final word, “I just want you to know that Algeria never stopped fighting. From the day they entered, there wasn’t a decade where there wasn’t a revolution, and there wasn’t a day that people didn’t fight. We never stopped.”\n\nAnd with that, I left, and the next day I googled the Algerian national anthem which I’ve heard countless times in my life and even partially memorized. But as I read it this time on the terrace of my house in Algiers, overlooking the horizon across from me and taking in a deep inhale of the smell of my country which I can recognize if you bottled it up; I finally really understood it:\n\nWe swear by the lightning that destroys,\n\nBy the streams of generous blood being shed,\n\nBy the bright flags that wave,\n\nFlying proudly on the high mountains,\n\nThat we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,\n\nWe are determined that Algeria should live,\n\nSo be our witness - be our witness - be our witness!"
