        "text": "What’s new? Since the 2014 oil price drop, Algeria’s economic model, which emerged from the civil war in the 1990s, appears increasingly unsustainable. Despite repeated reform promises, the political system remains paralysed, led by an aging and ailing president who seems primed to embark on another five-year term following elections in 2019.\n\nWhy does it matter? An adaptation of Algeria’s economic policy is long overdue. Yet uncertainty surrounding an eventual presidential succession and a state-dependent entrepreneurial class seeking to protect the status quo are hindering progress on imperative reforms needed to navigate the challenges of the decade ahead.\n\nWhat should be done? Cautious initial steps could include improving transparency of public finances, launching a broader discussion on the challenges Algeria faces and how best to address them, and placing young Algerians – the bulk of the population, whose future is at stake – at the centre of discussions on reform.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAlgeria’s longstanding need to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons has gained fresh urgency since oil prices started falling dramatically in 2014. New financial realities have rendered the preceding decade’s high spending unsustainable, rapidly emptying state coffers and increasing the deficit. But despite successive governments’ vows to implement reforms and rebalance state finances, political paralysis has militated against decisive policy. Recent history – memory of the economic recession of the 1980s and the ensuing political instability which led to civil war in the 1990s – hinders government efforts to seek a political consensus on reforms and implement them. Yet a failure to reform could precipitate a new period of instability. To resolve this conundrum, the government should pursue greater transparency and better communication about the economic challenges the country faces, greater inclusivity vis-à-vis socio-economic stakeholders, and a sharper focus on the youth demographic in particular.\n\nTwo chief obstacles stand in the way. Politically influential vested interests seek to protect the status quo, which benefits a state-dependent business class. And political factors dampen enthusiasm for a more aggressive approach: memory of the political turmoil and bloodshed that followed austerity measures and political reforms in the 1980s and 1990s lingers. Acknowledgement that generous state spending helped pacify the country in the aftermath of the “black decade” of the 1990s, when as many as 200,000 Algerians died in fighting between the state and Islamist groups, has made the government understandably cautious to reverse it. And the question of presidential succession and what legacy Abdelaziz Bouteflika, president since 1999 and the architect of national reconciliation, will leave behind looms large. Bouteflika appears intent on running for a fifth five-year term in elections next April, despite his poor health and public calls for him to pass the torch to a new generation, a factor that contributes to a general sense of paralysis.\n\nDespite an increase in revenues in 2018 due to a recovery in oil prices, a potential economic crisis could come as soon as 2019.\n\nDespite an increase in revenues in 2018 due to a recovery in oil prices (which might not last), a potential economic crisis could come as soon as 2019. It could thus overlap with tensions surrounding the presidential election (which Bouteflika is expected to win easily should, as expected, he run again), and, beyond that, a looming leadership transition. To stave off a crisis, the government has carried out successive rounds of spending cuts, which will take time to deliver results, and implemented an expansionary monetary policy, which fuels inflation and merely serves to buy the government time without addressing underlying problems. Although officials have outlined a broader agenda of industrial diversification and subsidy reform, among other measures, both local and foreign experts say an overarching strategy for reform is still missing. Entrenched political and business interests have too many incentives against change and are squandering the opportunity to get ahead of the curve of a potential fiscal crisis that, if handled too late, will demand more painful and destabilising policies.\n\nThe political uncertainty surrounding economic policymaking was evident under Prime Minister Abdelmajid Tebboune in 2017, who was ousted after attempting aggressive changes to economic policy. His replacement, Ahmed Ouyahia, is a three-time former prime minister and a pillar of the establishment; what he lacks in novelty he makes up in experience and ability to navigate the government’s murky internal divides. Ultimately, however, any government is limited by the growing paralysis – whether on economic policy or elsewhere – of Algeria’s strongly presidential system, a reflection of Bouteflika’s health and the uncertainties around how his eventual successor will reshape the relationship between political power, the public sector and the private sector.\n\nIn time, Algeria will have to make more than marginal technical adjustments to its economic policy. It should seek to renegotiate an implicit social contract between the state and its citizens long constrained by the advantages (and disadvantages) of its oil-based “rentier” economy, namely that the state should provide and the people should abide. Cracks in that arrangement have become more apparent, manifesting themselves chiefly in frequent socio-economic protests across the country. However, since the late 1980s, contestation that expressed the desire for change – mass protests, calls for political reform and various other forms of activism that sometimes resulted in concessions from the state – often generated profound instability and conflict. Nearly twenty years after the end of the civil war of the 1990s, it is time to begin moving away from a model that, for all the stability and peace it brought, increasingly appears unsustainable.\n\nIn order to begin this process, the government should take modest steps to establish a roadmap for economic reform:\n\nBe more forthcoming and transparent to the public on the state of public finances and how it intends to address it. The government should avoid introducing new policies without consulting with and preparing state institutions. It should also seek to address mounting public concern with corruption, for example by appointing a commission to review how to best curtail it through administrative and legislative reforms. This would be a more effective way to curtail corruption in the long term than through trials that the public perceives as politicised and doing little to deter future corruption;\n\nInclude a wider range of business and civil society actors in its consultations on economic policy, beyond the business associations and trade unions that are currently its chief interlocutors;\n\nPut particular emphasis on youth, from jobseekers to entrepreneurs, in shaping a reform agenda. This could take place, to begin with, through surveying the needs of younger Algerians and creating consultation mechanisms to integrate their views into the development of the reform agenda.\n\nAlgiers/Brussels, 19 November 2018\n\nLoading Video\n\nVideo: Breaking Algeria's Economic Paralysis\n\nI. Introduction\n\nAlgeria faces two challenging transitions. The first, compelled by the drop in oil prices since their peak in the early 2010s, is a move away from an economic model based predominantly on oil and gas revenue and heavy government spending. The second is an uncertain presidential succession, as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81 and severely weakened by a 2013 stroke, approaches the end of his fourth five-year term in 2019. These two transitions are related: the Bouteflika era coincided, until 2014, with a period of steadily increasing oil prices that boosted the economy as the country recovered from the civil war of the 1990s. Yet it also gave rise to an entrepreneurial class that stimulated growth but whose growing political clout and deepening corruption present obstacles to reform. Negotiating these twin transitions simultaneously will be crucial to sustaining Algeria’s relative stability in a turbulent region.\n\nThis report outlines why the current economic model is unsustainable, something authorities openly recognise but have difficulty addressing. This challenge is common in “rentier” states – countries overly reliant on oil income for their annual budget – facing the imperative of change: cutting state spending is unpopular with a public accustomed to subsidised fuel and other basic goods. In Algeria, the task is complicated by the tacit link between economic prosperity and the national reconciliation process undertaken since Bouteflika became president in 1999. The economic dimension of the post-civil war years, including a period of high oil prices that enabled both social spending and the development of a new business elite, helped avoid a reprise of violence. The lingering trauma of the civil war – which began as a popular movement for political and economic reforms and ended in widespread bloodshed – hinders reform, as does the ability of influential interest groups that have prospered in the Bouteflika era to block policy changes that could adversely affect them.\n\nThe 2011 Arab uprisings and their aftermath underlined the fragility of existing economic and political models across the region.\n\nThe 2011 Arab uprisings and their aftermath underlined the fragility of existing economic and political models across the region. Algeria sees itself as different from those countries in that it experienced and eventually overcame its own major political and social upheavals in the 1980s and 1990s. Largely as a result of this history and associated trauma, it saw no significant unrest in 2011, and the ruling establishment, while oft-criticised, retains historic legitimacy stemming from the war of national liberation with France as well as popular support, in part due to the absence of clear alternatives. Yet it shares many fundamentals with its neighbours, including a young population, a laggard economy resisting reform and an uncertain leadership transition on the horizon. Its sense of immunity from regional trends should not be cause for complacency.\n\nThis report is based on research conducted in Algeria in 2017 and 2018, including interviews with government officials, politicians, entrepreneurs, civil society actors, academics and journalists. It addresses how best to balance the prevailing desire to avoid a socio-economic shock at a time of political transition against the imperative to adapt to a rapidly changing economic environment and keep pace with Algerians’ expectations as the country faces the next decade.\n\nII. An Unsustainable Economic Model\n\nA. A Dangerous Dependency on Shrinking Hydrocarbon Reserves\n\nAlgeria is over-dependent on hydrocarbons revenues. Oil and gas accounted for 97 per cent of total exports, two thirds of state revenues and one third of gross domestic product in 2014. In better times, this resource wealth enabled the state to spend lavishly to buy elite loyalty and social peace. Oil revenues have for the most part insulated the government from popular demands for greater participation and transparency. When financial incentives such as generous subsidies and free housing proved insufficient in stifling popular dissent, these revenues helped the security apparatus acquire the coercive means to repress it.\n\nBut a rentier economy has downsides. It has rendered the state complacent, protected a private sector in which state contracts are awarded based on personal connections rather than merit or efficiency, and propped up internationally uncompetitive industries. It also has fostered a sense of entitlement among the public. Together, these outcomes have left the country vulnerable to volatility in global commodity prices, which risks transforming a prolonged economic downturn since 2014 into a crisis of political legitimacy. Inefficiencies in the energy sector further hamper a sluggish economy. As a result, Algeria has become the only OPEC member to pump below its permitted quota as its production has declined, despite efforts to attract new investments.\n\nAlgeria’s proven energy reserves are also dwindling. Current estimates of extraction timetables – twenty years for oil, fifty for gas – mean that within one or two generations, barring significant new discoveries or major technological advances, there could be nothing left. Meanwhile, decreasing international investment in the hydrocarbon sector and aging fields are taking a toll. Compared to 2007, when Algeria exported 85 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas, the export target for 2018 is only 50 bcm. As domestic consumption rises (due to population growth and changes in consumption patterns), an increasing proportion of production stays at home, suppressing exports and therefore access to foreign currency to import goods.\n\nAlgeria is redoubling efforts to raise production, including through controversial techniques such as fracking. While official ambivalence about greater foreign participation in the oil and gas sector has repeatedly stymied legal reforms, the state might have to resort to more radical moves, such as making Algeria a more attractive investment destination for multinational corporations that can boost output of existing wells and develop new resources such as shale gas. The government’s plan to boost output by 14 per cent by 2019 and invest billions in exploration is unrealistic, in part because protracted corruption scandals have paralysed Sonatrach, the state-owned oil company; these were widely seen as a tug-of-war between officials and the intelligence services. With four energy ministers and six heads of Sonatrach since 2010, erratic leadership has affected the oil sector’s stability. As an industry analyst put it:\n\nIt was a one-two punch. The 2010 scandal that disrupted Sonatrach and the energy ministry put everyone in a holding pattern. That holding pattern continued through the oil price collapse in 2014, and the collapse meant that even if oil companies were more comfortable with the above-ground risks in Algeria, such as leadership changes and the regulatory environment, they didn’t have the financial leeway to return to Algeria and start investing.\n\nB. The 2014 Oil Shock\n\nIn mid-2014, oil prices began a precipitous drop, plummeting from the $80-110 per barrel range in 2011-2013 to $40-60 per barrel throughout most of 2015-2017. Since then, Algeria has drawn down its $200 billion foreign-exchange reserves to shore up its economy, fuelling fresh scrutiny of its economic model’s structural weaknesses. The oil price drop took a heavy toll on state coffers: in 2007, Algeria’s revenues were $74 billion; in 2017, they totalled $24 billion. Meanwhile, its fuel import bill tripled between 2016 and 2017 to a record $2.5 billion.\n\nEven though oil prices stabilised in the $40-60 range in 2017 before rising again in 2018, this does not necessarily signal a long-lasting recovery. In any event, higher oil prices would only allow authorities to buy time to address underlying problems. The state can no longer afford to postpone dealing with what economists call the “Dutch disease”: an overvalued domestic currency (due to a central bank policy of maintaining an artificially strong Algerian dinar) that makes exports more expensive and uncompetitive. This leads in turn to a decline in non-oil industrial productivity, fuelling unemployment and leaving the economy highly exposed to unpredictable fluctuations in global commodity prices (for example, of oil, minerals and cereals).\n\nSuccessive Algerian governments have acknowledged this. Abdelmalek Sellal, prime minister from 2012 to 2017, called in 2016 for a “new economic model” that would reduce the state’s role while enhancing that of the private sector and limiting dependency on hydrocarbon revenues. His successors have repeated the same message. All have faced resistance from entrenched economic interests and institutional inertia, which forced them to backpedal on reform.\n\nThat said, Algeria still has considerable autonomy to devise a new approach, primarily due to its low foreign debt, which is less than 2 per cent of GDP. Its partners – particularly European countries that want strong states in the southern Mediterranean to cooperate on regional security and stemming migrant and refugee flows – are willing to provide support. Experts expect foreign currency reserves, though depleting, to fund government spending for roughly another two years. As an expert at an international financial institution put it:\n\nThe oil shock made the urgency of needed changes more apparent. The difficult question Algerian authorities face is pace: if they go too slow, adjustment could become disorderly. And if they go too fast, there will be social resistance. They have the means to walk this fine line; the question is where to find [that line].\n\nC. What Reform Agenda?\n\nWhen oil prices collapsed in June 2014, Algeria had a comfortable cushion in the form of significant savings. It had $178 billion in foreign reserves and $37 billion in its sovereign wealth fund (Fonds de régulation des recettes, FRR, which is financed by surplus hydrocarbon revenues). Yet, at the beginning of 2018 only $97.3 billion of reserves remained, while the government had exhausted the FRR in 2017 to finance successive budget deficits. Authorities, optimistic that oil prices would rebound, calculated the state budget for 2017 on the basis of an oil price recovery to $70 barrel by 2020 – a level reached by the first quarter of 2018, but which may not be sustained.\n\nCautiously and inconsistently, the government has acknowledged the crisis.\n\nCautiously and inconsistently, the government has acknowledged the crisis. It introduced tentative austerity measures in the 2016 budget, trimming state spending by 9 per cent. At the start of 2016, it raised the prices of subsidised gasoline. Facing no significant opposition, it became more aggressive, adopting a budget in 2017 that reduced government spending by 14 per cent. It took other measures as well, introducing import restrictions and allowing a controlled depreciation of the Algerian dinar. The 2018 budget, adopted in December 2017, includes further cuts. These have been accompanied by a resort to “quantitative easing” – the increase of money supply by the central bank through issuing government bonds – to stimulate the economy.\n\nThese measures carried great risks. While some have praised them, the question remains whether they amount to an overall strategy for economic reform rather than a superficial response to an urgent crisis. Economic experts and financial institutions criticised quantitative easing in particular. An economist said the measure was “adding fuel to the fire” of inflation and would raise living costs, discourage foreign direct investment and possibly depress industrialisation efforts. A European diplomat summarised the criticism: “The purpose of quantitative easing is to buy time, not to implement change. It is just propping up liquidity at the risk of creating inflation”.\n\nSome officials say the government is intent on rationalising public spending by overhauling inefficient and wasteful subsidy programs, raising taxes on the rich, reducing and formalising the informal sector by making banking more flexible, and encouraging the growth of the industrial sector (which currently accounts for less than 5 per cent of GDP). Experts and officials alike believe that diversifying the economy away from its overreliance on hydrocarbons for revenue, preferably through the increase of other exports, is essential, as is reducing the import bill. Officials have discussed plans to implement such major reforms for years, but without any concrete change.\n\nD. The Trauma of the Past\n\nOne reason for this inaction is that the transition from state socialism to a more market-oriented economy from the late 1980s to early 1990s is intertwined in Algerians’ minds with the violence of the black decade that followed. When oil prices crashed in October 1985, revenues from gas and oil exports fell by more than 40 per cent. A crisis followed on multiple fronts: authorities shelved investment plans and cut back large-scale social programs. Unemployment rose and productivity plummeted as factories closed. And the government, believing that prices would soon rise again, dipped into its foreign reserves and borrowed externally to finance budget deficits. Between 1985 and 1988, the debt-to-service ratio more than doubled, from 35 to 80 per cent.\n\nThe social and economic crisis that followed the 1985 oil price collapse set the stage for the riots of October 1988, when thousands took to the streets to protest rising prices, unemployment and austerity measures. Starting in Algiers and spreading to other parts of the country, they were Algeria’s most serious riots since independence in 1962. The deployment of the army to put an end to the unrest resulted in clashes that killed 500 (mostly when the army fired upon protesters) and wounded over 1,000.These events precipitated the fall of the single-party system and, in 1991, the country’s first free elections, followed by a military coup that ushered in civil war during the so-called black decade. As a board member of the Forum des Chefs d’Entreprise (FCE), a business lobby, said, looking back on those times: “We can’t go back to the 1990s, when the country was ravaged by terrorism and people joined the rebels because they had no prospects and no visibility”.\n\nThe memory of economic collapse that preceded and exacerbated political violence haunts even the most pro-reform policymakers. Algeria’s last experiment in economic liberalisation and political democratisation ended with a decade of internecine slaughter. Today, authorities never publicly refer to the links between that economic crisis and the social unrest and political crisis that followed. But they clearly have its spectre in mind – especially the loss of sovereignty in managing reforms – as they try to avoid the mistakes made in that period.\n\nIn the Bouteflika era from 1999 onward, Algeria has been able to avoid repeating such a scenario. Bouteflika’s first three terms represented fifteen years of recovery from civil strife, the restoration of security and stability, and mounting prosperity. Through his call for a “civil concord” Bouteflika offered Algerians a new social contract when he was first elected in 1999: forget the “black decade” and questions of accountability; instead, focus on economic development. Taking advantage of nearly two decades of buoyant oil prices, he gradually and partially shifted power away from the country’s entrenched establishment – the army, the Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité (DRS, the intelligence service), and the Front National de Libération (FLN, the historic single party until 1989) – popularly referred to as le pouvoir. In its place, he restored the primacy of the presidency that had been eroded in the turmoil of the 1980s and 1990s, building a regime in which business elites gradually gained the kind of influence previously reserved for senior military officers and other officials.\n\nThe Arab uprisings of 2011 provided the first real test of this new system. The government relied heavily on public spending to quell domestic discontent. This entailed lavish subsidies, infrastructure investments and an ambitious free housing program, embracing handout politics that offered economic security to many Algerians in exchange for continued social peace. In 2011, the government added thousands of new jobs, particularly in the security sector, and oversaw a 330 per cent increase over the previous year in interest-free cash loans distributed to young entrepreneurs through the Agence nationale de soutien à l’emploi des jeunes (ANSEJ). In such a context, popular concerns relayed by the media about corruption and wasteful spending did not gain traction, and Algeria weathered the region’s turmoil largely unscathed.\n\nDuring his fourth term, from 2014 onwards, Bouteflika consolidated his new power configuration (particularly with the dismantling of the DRS). But this period was also marked by growing political uncertainty (especially over the president’s health and ability to govern) and renewed economic anxiety.\n\nIII. The Politics of Economic Policymaking\n\nA. The Fashioning of Economic Policy\n\nAlgeria has a presidential system in which the head of state has the final say on economic policy. Since 2014, an economic policy advisory board works to produce compromises among three institutions collectively known as the Tripartite: the Union Générale des Travailleurs Algériens (UGTA, a trade union federation), the Forum des Chefs d’Entreprise (FCE, an entrepreneurs’ lobby) and the cabinet. In theory, this arrangement is inclusive and stabilising, bringing together ministers, an association of business leaders that has rapidly gained in clout since 2014, and the country’s most powerful and historically significant trade union federation. In practice, the Tripartite is top-down and imposes loyalty to the government as a precondition for participation in economic debate. The exclusion of important actors, such as autonomous unions and dissident entrepreneurs, limits the reach and scope of the policy debate.\n\nThe UGTA and FCE are both politically centrist: the FCE’s advocacy for business is tempered by an acknowledgement of the country’s socialist roots; the UGTA’s defence of labour is softened by its desire to support the emergence of a strong private sector and an affirmation of the typically pro-business sentiment that excessive bureaucracy is harmful to job creation and the business environment. Both perceive the Tripartite as a constructive form of social dialogue, and share the view that private enterprise is key to economic development. A UGTA leader said: “We may not have the high degree of social dialogue that the Scandinavians have but we’re doing our best to avoid violence. Both sides must listen and put forth proposals. We need to listen to one another”. Likewise, an FCE board member noted:\n\nWe don’t say anything against public enterprises, like Air Algérie which has 10,000 employees instead of 3,500 …. There is a need to strengthen the private sector, to make it stronger and more dynamic, so that the public sector can disappear eventually, except for certain core areas like gas, oil and utilities.\n\nIn an environment in which decision-making remains highly opaque, the leaders of both the UGTA and FCE – respectively Abdelmajid Sidi Said and Ali Haddad – enjoy a high degree of influence and prestige given their proximity to Said Bouteflika, the president’s brother and a senior adviser.\n\nWhile the Tripartite appears to unite and stabilise the discordant leftist and liberal policy perspectives the two bodies represent, policymaking suffers from fits and starts and often is paralysed. There is weak coordination within, and among, institutions and policy can change arbitrarily. In Bouteflika’s fourth term, the government has rotated officials with unusual frequency, particularly in key ministries such as energy and industry. This has created confusion about the country’s priorities, which are set by the prime minister but can subsequently be reversed by presidential decree. The opacity of the policymaking process and low levels of intra-governmental communications and cooperation reinforce this ambiguity: rather than working in coordination, ministries are mostly unaware of one another’s projects and approaches. An industrial policy specialist who worked with the government noted:\n\nThe policy environment is not conducive to diversification. Agencies that should be working together are not. I enquired about industrial policy design at each of the relevant ministries: the finance ministry told me they don’t deal with industrial policy; the industry ministry said to ask at the trade ministry; the trade ministry said they only deal with trade statistics, not design, and to go see the finance ministry.\n\nSudden, unexpected turnover in senior leadership has added to the confusion and highlighted the role of influential entrepreneurs in politics. Bouteflika appointed Abdelmajid Tebboune, housing minister in the previous cabinet and a member of the FLN said to be close to him, to replace Sellal as prime minister in May 2017. As interim trade minister from January to May 2017, Tebboune made a name for himself as an establishment figure willing to challenge import barons – businesspeople with privileged political connections whose success depends on securing import licenses (and sometimes monopolies) in lucrative markets. To reduce a burgeoning trade deficit due to lower oil prices, he quickly moved to suspend a wide range of imports, sending prices up and freezing industrial investment. His open targeting of importers as a privileged and overprotected interest group raised hopes that his economic reforms would extend to addressing corruption. Tebboune tackled politically delicate issues ranging from import licenses to public land reform with a zeal that threatened the established order, in particular stepping on the toes of FCE leader Ali Haddad.\n\nThe Tebboune-Haddad standoff became a fixation for Algerian media: for example, photos showing Said Bouteflika warmly embracing Haddad and appearing to snub Tebboune at the 30 July funeral of former Prime Minister Redha Malek were widely shared and interpreted as foreshadowing the prime minister’s downfall. When Bouteflika dismissed Tebboune on 15 August, the message he appeared to send was that the entrenched interests of business elites are untouchable, regardless of the urgency of economic reform.\n\nEven as it gained breathing space, the state has used veiled threats to defend its economic policy, including the suggestion that the violence of the 1990s might return.\n\nTebboune was succeeded by Ahmed Ouyahia, a seasoned apparatchik who previously served as prime minister on three occasions (1995-1998, 2003-2006 and 2008-2012) and was director of the presidential cabinet immediately prior to his appointment. A consummate insider, he is widely considered a compromise between competing interest groups and sometimes mentioned as a potential future president who many within the ruling elite could live with, despite his prickly public persona.\n\nWithin weeks of his appointment, Ouyahia moved to implement quantitative easing, thus enabling the government to finance the budget and buy time, in part gambling that oil prices might soon recover. For the moment, the gamble appears to have paid off. The government has been able to avoid deeper cuts, while the rise in oil prices that began in early 2018 has relieved pressure on the budget.\n\nB. Warding Off Unrest\n\nEven as it gained breathing space, the state has used veiled threats to defend its economic policy, including the suggestion that the violence of the 1990s might return. In September 2017, defending his decision to implement quantitative easing, Ouyahia told parliament that without it the government would lack funds to pay civil servants’ salaries within two months, implying imminent unrest. In October 2017, the state television station ENTV broadcast, for the first time on Algerian television, explicit and deeply upsetting images of the slaughter of the 1990s. This was widely interpreted as a warning to the public to keep quiet and be grateful for the country’s stability. The intention appears to be, as it was in 2011, to warn the population against rocking the boat by protesting or otherwise challenging the state’s decisions.\n\nSince the end of 2016, with the announcement of the trimmed-down 2017 budget, popular dissent against austerity has surfaced in multiple ways. Protests have mostly been spontaneous, lacking larger organisational frameworks and failing to mobilise large numbers, with a few exceptions. After the approval of the 2017 budget, a five-day “stay at home” protest planned for 2-7 January, combined with calls for a general strike by a shopkeepers’ union in opposition to import restrictions, tax hikes and penalties, turned violent.\n\nFrom 2 to 4 January, protesters clashed with security forces across multiple towns in the province of Bejaia in the eastern Kabylia region, as well as in Bouira and Ain Benian, both just outside Algiers. Young men attacked symbols of the state such as the Office of National Education, looted goods from technology stores and blocked roads. Security forces used teargas to disperse them and dozens of protesters were reported wounded, as well as 39 police officers in the Bejaia area alone. Security services diffused or disrupted several other marches. Similar protests took place in 2018, with the notable case of a six-month doctors’ strike that ended with government concessions after they brought the public health sector to a near-standstill.\n\nDuring Bouteflika’s tenure, Algeria has invested much in reforming and professionalising its security services, rebuilding confidence both at home and abroad, in the realisation that forms of violence and surveillance seen as legitimate or necessary in fighting an insurgency are no longer so. Pre-emptive arrests and targeting protest leaders with harassment and persecution are more effective in stamping out public dissent than other less discriminating methods, which encouraged escalation in the 1990s in Algeria and during the more recent Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere. But the state has not yet tested this change in policing tactics on a large scale, and accumulating resentment could erupt unpredictably. Authorities are exercising particular caution in handling protests in the south, a site of rising contestation.\n\nIV. The Private Sector’s Rising Influence\n\nA. A Newly Relevant Political Class\n\nThe Forum des Chefs d’Entreprise’s (FCE) power has waxed since 2014 and it appears poised to gain even more political influence. Private sector growth is a welcome development that stands to bring jobs and a more diversified and competitive economy, but vigilance and oversight will be necessary to harness, coordinate and guide its growth. Critics see in the post-2014 rise of the FCE – which lacks the historical legitimacy of the military or FLN – the advance of a politically influential oligarchy more likely to shape state policy in line with its own interests than to develop the economy. Although the FCE describes itself as a force lobbying for economic reform, its growing political influence has garnered more attention than its declared reform objectives.\n\nSince 2014, when Haddad financed Bouteflika’s campaign for a fourth term and then became FCE head, this business lobby’s influence has steadily risen. It reached new heights in the public eye in December 2016, when – against protocol and after being denied permission to do so – Haddad insisted on speaking before Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra at the Algeria-Africa Business Forum, prompting a walkout by Sellal. For experts and society alike, Bouteflika’s decision to sack Tebboune in August 2017 – soon after the latter directly targeted Haddad’s construction empire – signalled that Haddad’s clout now trumped the head of government’s. Haddad’s influence derives principally from his real and perceived proximity to Said Bouteflika, the president’s brother; many Algerians noted that Tebboune’s sacking came just days after the two men were pictured in the media laughing together and entering a government vehicle.\n\nThe FCE’s rise echoes the growing political relevance of the entrepreneurial class generally. The May 2017 parliamentary elections marked the first time that business personalities ran directly as candidates, especially in the FLN and its partner in the pro-Bouteflika presidential coalition, the Rassemblement National Démocratique (RND). Their growing influence – in part paved by the open role several businessmen played in financing Bouteflika’s re-election campaign in 2014 – was perceived as a victory for representatives of business and, leftist critics say, a loss for representatives of the people. This trend in recent years has made some Algerian commentators argue that, in future presidential elections, financial backing from the business community may become as important as the political backing of traditional power centres such as the military.\n\nB. Whose Private Sector?\n\nFCE leaders see themselves as the custodians of a transition from centralised statist socialism to a market economy that started in the late 1980s and was disrupted by the black decade. As a FCE board member put it:\n\nThere needs to be a peaceful transition from one system to the other without too great a social shock. We’re coming out of a very difficult period and we can’t go back to that. It took so little time to discredit Algeria and so long to rebuild trust for Algerians and foreigners. In 1992, we left a socialist economy. We didn’t really kick off the process of developing private enterprise until 2000, which makes us only seventeen years old. Two thirds of jobs and three quarters of value added derive from the private sector. Taxes on businesses should replace export earnings in the state budget.\n\nThe FCE considers knowledge and technology transfers from foreign investment key to building a strong private sector, and does not deem the requirement that at least 51 per cent of capital investments in any local business be locally owned as a deterrent, even though foreign investors often cite it as one. It lobbies for rationalising both social spending, which it deems highly inefficient, with a particular focus on subsidy reform for energy and housing. It also supports integrating the informal sector into the formal economy as a high priority: huge quantities of cash circulate in a massive informal economy, which is more flexible than the rigid, overly bureaucratic banking and finance sector, and has proven remarkably resistant to efforts to regulate it. The informal circulation of money not only denies tax revenues to the government, it also renders impossible the kind of detailed economic analysis necessary for planning.\n\nThe need for foreign investment and partnerships to support private enterprise has endowed the FCE with a diplomatic relevance it has enthusiastically embraced. FCE delegations project an Algeria transformed since socialist rule, with new and dynamic private enterprises and strong untapped potential. It has identified Western countries and Japan as desirable investment partners, on account of the knowledge and technology transfer prospects they offer, and sub-Saharan Africa as an export market with strong potential. The FCE seeks to translate Algeria’s robust political and diplomatic relations with African countries into economic relationships.\n\nCritics charge that the FCE embodies a backward rather than forward-looking aspect of Algerian private enterprise. An Algerian economic analyst said:\n\nThe FCE represents liberal interests, including those of import barons. Import barons don’t want diversification and domestic production; they want imports because these allow them to manipulate the hard currency market. Their business model depends on their ability to arbitrage [the buying and selling of assets to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset] the state by selling goods at inflated prices. They’re not real capitalist investors. They don’t produce anything. It was this group of economic actors that brought about the sacking of Tebboune.\n\nGovernment officials and FCE members seem aware that import barons must pivot toward more productive sectors. “Elites want to make a lot of money”, a government adviser said. “But we have no more foreign currency. Import barons need to be pushed into productive activity. Circumstances oblige us to get out of this Dutch disease”.\n\nThe FCE has paid a cost for its increased political visibility: its critics now often paint it as a parasite granted special favours and playing a pernicious political role. This is in part a caricature that does not reflect the diversity of its members, but is also the predictable result of its politicisation, which rewards business leaders for supporting the government and punishes others for challenging it. Independent-minded entrepreneurs are often actively obstructed, as the public tussle between the government and billionaire industrialist Issad Rebrab, whose Cevital group produces the majority of the country’s non-hydrocarbons exports, has shown.\n\nV. Overcoming the Paralysis\n\nAlgeria stands at a delicate juncture. Bouteflika’s administration, having leveraged Algerians’ past traumas into its own overextension, is unable or unwilling to confront succession. For several years, prominent Algerians have repeatedly and publicly questioned whether Bouteflika is governing the country in reality, and have become increasingly bold in demanding that he not run for a fifth term. Important elements of the opposition have tried, in vain, to call for a negotiated transition that would also address pressing economic issues. Yet in the face of such calls, the presidency and the political coalition that supports it have chosen to either remain silent or double down on another extension of Bouteflika’s tenure as the glue that binds the system together. The latter build on a sense of confidence that many Algerians are grateful for the peace they have enjoyed since 1999 and are more worried about what an unknown future will bring.\n\nThe result is an increasing paralysis, reflected not only in the political status quo dominated by the FLN and RND, but also in economic and foreign policy. One consequence of this paralysis has been the stifling of an overdue debate about how to adjust to the decline in hydrocarbon revenues and reduce Algeria’s reliance on them. Such a debate needs to happen at two levels: between the elites – businesspeople, technocrats and politicians – that influence policy and the wider public, but also among these elites themselves.\n\nWhether needed economic changes arrive suddenly in response to crisis or more gradually if higher oil prices can buy more time, a first step for the government is to improve its communications and outreach. This is necessary to explain the challenges ahead and the necessity of reforms – including some that may be unpopular – and what they are expected to deliver. In recent years, the government has tended to underestimate or obfuscate worrisome economic data, including the evaporation of export earnings for savings and investment. An effort to be more transparent about the state of the treasury and how public money is spent would be important in explaining the country’s economic situation and avoiding the type of alarmist responses that can prevail when no reliable information is available.\n\nA related issue is the need to address the distrust many Algerians harbour towards both the state and the private sector, given the public perception that a small elite has captured the state. Neither policymakers nor their partners in the private sector and labour movement should underestimate the role corruption plays in the popular imagination; the Khalifa Bank and Sonatrach scandals in particular have eroded trust among both Algerians and foreign investors. The seizure of over 700 kilos of cocaine in a shipment of frozen meat belonging to a well-connected businessman in mid-2018 provoked consternation about the alleged complicity of senior security officials in organised crime.\n\nAccountability for at least the most egregious of past excesses could be one option if policymakers want to address public concern about corruption, even if a politically fraught one because of the likelihood it will harm vested interests. An anti-corruption crackdown also runs the risk of becoming a politicised witch-hunt, particularly in the context of a looming leadership change. A more palatable option might be to lower the risk of repeating such occurrences, for instance by appointing a commission of experts to review existing legislation and administrative procedures and suggest reforms to improve oversight of public spending.\n\nAny renegotiation of the post-1990s social contract – lavish state spending, including on the cultivation of new economic elites, in exchange for political acquiescence in Bouteflika rule and impunity for the perpetrators of violence during the civil war – must be considered carefully. The generation born in the 1990s has little memory of the decade’s violence and will face rising prices of basic goods as the government phases out subsidies. Those younger than thirty – 70 per cent of the population – are now entering the workforce with bleak prospects and dramatically diminished state capacity to support them. While some resent the change in circumstances, others perceive it as an opportunity: there is a will among this group to carve out its own space and reduce dependency on the state. As Abdellah Malek, the 28-year-old head of a technology start-up hub in Algiers, put it:\n\nMost of society has been receiving things for free for twenty years. People need to work hard to navigate themselves out of dependency. If entrepreneurs are not able to do things on their own, they’ll always rely on the government for help; too much of society is already suffering from this mentality because of oil income.\n\nImplementing a transition away from the current economic model will require more transparency and openness at all levels.\n\nThe question of the relationship between a handful of powerful officials and politically influential economic elites is intertwined with the wider public’s perception that corruption is widespread among a small power elite of entrepreneurs and officials. “Separating money from political power”, as former Prime Minister Tebboune promised to do and what many believe he was sacked for, is a politically charged slogan at odds with the reality that powerful businesspeople organise to defend both corporate and personal interests, and that the struggle against corruption is too often used to settle political scores. A better approach is to expand the number of stakeholders in the formulation of economic policy.\n\nPart of the controversy about the FCE’s influence is ideological, reflecting typical right/left or liberal/statist divides that generally can be resolved through elite power rebalancing and electoral outcomes. But the FCE’s problem also largely lies in the perception that despite being the lead reformer, it embodies the interests of the establishment and a new elite rather than the economic interests of the country as a whole. As an economic policy adviser said: “The Tripartite should be widened. In terms of building a popular consensus around reforms, having representation be restricted to the UGTA and FCE has a negative impact”. Reaching out to outliers in the business world, including those seen as critics of the Bouteflika government such as Issad Rebrab, could not only infuse the debate over economic policy with different ideas but also defuse charges that it lobbies for a particular faction more than the interests of the private sector as a whole.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nAlgeria has a mixed inheritance from the black decade. It has learned some lessons about how not to liberalise too quickly under sudden pressure due to mounting foreign debt, and it has a strong will to avoid repeating past mistakes. It must now balance the need for an economic adjustment against vested interests that range from privileged businesspeople to elements of society who consider rapid and substantial changes to the redistributive model as too disruptive. That model, for all its inefficiencies, has lifted many out of poverty and helped stabilise a war-torn nation.\n\nImplementing a transition away from the current economic model will require more transparency and openness at all levels, and more accountability from both state institutions and the private sector. Ultimately, the deep reform that Algeria needs requires a strategic opening, externally but also internally, to embrace a diversity of economic, political and societal actors in building a new model that can ensure both stability and growth. The government’s current attitude, be it toward making major economic decisions or tackling broader political and societal questions, is too often aloof, arrogant and at odds with Algerians’ expectations.\n\nDespite the political uncertainty before the 2019 presidential election and, more generally, a looming presidential transition that may or may not align with the electoral calendar, some cautious initial steps are possible. They could include improving transparency on the state of public finances and widening the discussion on the challenges Algeria faces and how best to address them to a broader range of business and civil society actors than those currently involved in the policymaking process. Young Algerians in particular – who constitute the bulk of the population and whose futures is at stake – should be at the centre of any effort to define a long-term response to the country’s economic challenges.\n\nLike many issues crucial to Algeria, questions of economic reform have tended to be postponed, with proponents of change waiting for a more forward-leaning political leadership. This may not emerge for some time, however, and today’s decision-makers should consider that getting ahead of the curve of a future crisis would be wiser – for their own sake as well as Algeria’s – than dealing with a shock when it comes. It is not too early to start widening the framework of a debate that is as much about how the Algerian social model should evolve as it is about technical steps toward remedial reform.\n\nAlgiers/Brussels, 19 November 2018\n\nAppendix A: Map of Algeria"
