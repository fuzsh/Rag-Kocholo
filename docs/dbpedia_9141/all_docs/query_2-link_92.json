Although the term \"People's Republic\" is commonly associated with communist states, Algeria is not a communist country. The term was adopted primarily because Algeria gained its independence through a revolutionary struggle against France.\n\nAlgeria is a multi-party republic with a strong executive branch led by a president. The president is both the head of state and the commander in chief of the army, and is elected by popular vote for a five-year term.\n\nLegislative power is vested in the two chambers of Parliament, the Council of the Nation and the People's National Assembly.\n\nName transcriptions\n\n[edit]\n\nArabic: الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية, al-Jumhūriyya al-Jazāʾiriyya ad-Dīmuqrāṭiyya aš-Šaʿbiyya\n\nBerber: ⵜⴰⴳⴷⵓⴷⴰ ⵜⴰⵎⴳⴷⴰⵢⵜ ⵜⴰⵖⵔⴼⴰⵏⵜ ⵜⴰⴷⵣⴰⵢⵔⵉⵢⵜ, Tagduda tamegdayt taɣerfant tazzayrit\n\nFrench: République algérienne démocratique et populaire (lit, Democratic and Popular Algerian Republic)\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it the world's tenth-largest country and the largest country in Africa. It is slightly larger than Mexico, four times smaller than the United States, and nearly 200 times larger than Africa's smallest country, Gambia.\n\nAlgeria is made up of 58 provinces and more than 1,541 communes.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe history of Algeria can be traced back to the earliest civilisations that inhabited the region and beyond. The earliest known inhabitants of Algeria were the Berber people, who have inhabited the region since at least 10,000 BCE. From the 8th century BCE, Phoenician traders established trading posts along the North African coast, introducing the region to the wider Mediterranean world.\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Algeria was conquered by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate and subsequently came under the rule of various Muslim dynasties. The region was colonised by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and remained under Ottoman control until 1830.\n\nFrench Algeria (1830-1962)\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench rule in Algeria began in 1830 when France invaded the region, defeated the Ottoman forces, and established a colonial administration. Algeria was formally annexed and split into French departments in 1848.\n\nFrench authorities introduced a number of reforms, such as land reform, the secularisation of education, and the introduction of new laws and infrastructure. However, these policies were often accompanied by oppressive measures such as forced labor, restrictions on religious expression, and the suppression of opposition.\n\nAlgerians were treated very poorly by the French. Algerians were subjected to oppressive laws, such as the Code de l'indigénat, which denied them basic rights and freedoms. They were heavily taxed, forcibly conscripted into the French military, and stripped of their land and resources. Algerians were also subjected to violence, torture, and other forms of mistreatment by French colonial authorities.\n\nThe Algerian War (1954-1962)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Algerian War for Independence was a bloody eight-year conflict between the French colonial government in Algeria and the National Liberation Front (FLN), a nationalist movement that sought to end French rule and establish an independent Algerian state. The war lasted from 1954 to 1962 and resulted in the death of over 1 million people, the displacement of over 5 million people, and the eventual independence of Algeria as a nation.\n\nThe Algerian War for Independence began on November 1, 1954, when the FLN launched a series of attacks against French military and police outposts throughout Algeria. The FLN hoped to spark a popular uprising against French rule, and the attacks were largely successful. The French responded with a massive campaign of repression, employing torture, summary executions, and collective punishments against the population.\n\nThe war soon escalated, with the FLN launching guerrilla attacks against French forces, while the French launched counter-insurgency operations that included the use of napalm and other forms of indiscriminate violence. The war was also characterized by atrocities on both sides, including the massacre of civilians by French forces and the use of torture by the FLN.\n\nThe war ended in 1962, when the French agreed to a cease-fire and granted Algeria its independence. After declaring independence in 1962, Algeria underwent a period of political turbulence.\n\nPost-war period (1962-1991)\n\n[edit]\n\nImmediately following independence, the FLN assumed power and established a single-party government. Under the leadership of President Houari Boumediene, Algeria adopted a socialist economic system and sought to strengthen ties with other Arab and African countries.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Algeria’s economic situation deteriorated and the government’s popularity declined. In response, the government began to crack down on political dissent and religious expression, leading to an Islamist insurgency.\n\nAlgerian Civil War (1991-2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Algerian Civil War was a brutal conflict that caused great suffering to the Algerian people. Over 200,000 people lost their lives in the war, and more than 1 million were displaced. The conflict also had a lasting effect on Algeria's economy and society, as the country struggled to rebuild after the war. Although the conflict officially ended in 2002, its legacy continues to shape the country today.\n\nThe conflict began with the cancellation of the 1992 general elections, which saw the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) poised to win a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The Algerian government, a military-backed regime, responded by banning the FIS and arresting its members, sparking a long and bloody conflict.\n\nThe war was fought between the government and various rebel groups, most notably the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS). The GIA initially sought to overthrow the government and impose an Islamic state. As the conflict progressed, however, they became increasingly brutal and indiscriminate in their tactics, leading to a sharp decline in popular support. The AIS, on the other hand, sought to negotiate with the government for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n\nThroughout the war, the government employed a range of tactics to combat the rebels. These included a massive deployment of troops, aerial bombardments, and the use of torture and other forms of human rights abuses. The government also sought to co-opt the population by providing economic incentives and social services, such as free health care and education.\n\nPresent history (2002 - present)\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the end of the civil war, Algeria has experienced an economic boom due to increased oil and gas production. This has led to a marked reduction in poverty and unemployment.\n\nIn 2006, the Algerian government approved a new constitution, which aimed to protect human rights and improve the country’s political and economic situation. This resulted in a period of political reform, as well as an increase in foreign investment.\n\nDespite its economic progress, Algeria is still facing several challenges. These include high unemployment, poverty, and corruption. The country is also struggling with terrorism, with attacks by extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/ISIS/IS).\n\nElectricity\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficially, 220 V 50 Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\", or the compatible, but not always grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Canadian and US travellers should pack an adapter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Algeria.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nVisa restrictions:\n\nEntry will be denied to citizens of Israel.\n\nAlgeria is not a country you can just show up to and get in; most visitors require a visa to visit the country and the government hasn't exactly opened up the country to the rest of the world.\n\nVisa requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nCitizens of Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Western Sahara, Seychelles, and Tunisia can enter the country without a visa.\n\nIf you're not a citizen of any of the countries listed above, you are required to apply for an Algerian visa at an Algerian diplomatic mission.\n\nObtaining an Algerian visa can be challenging, as the process often involves heaps of paperwork and high fees. For example, the Algerian Embassy in the United States usually charges US$160 for any kind of Algerian visa and the Algerian consulate in Alicante charges €95 for visas for Spanish citizens staying up to 90 days.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the longer you intend to stay, the more expensive the visa will be.\n\nVisa application requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nAn Algerian diplomatic mission can be found in almost every country. If your country does not have an Algerian diplomatic mission, you may need to travel to another country to apply for an Algerian visa.\n\nAlthough visa requirements vary from country to country, you're typically asked to submit the following to apply for an Algerian visa:\n\nA copy of your passport (must have a validity of more than six months)\n\nTwo passport-sized photographs.\n\nTwo visa application forms.\n\nA notarized letter of invitation (required if you plan to stay in the home of an Algerian resident)\n\nA copy of your travel itinerary.\n\nA copy of your hotel reservation.\n\nA copy of your bank statement.\n\nSpecial requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nCitizens of Syria must demonstrate they have enough funds (€1000 if they've been sponsored or €4000 if they have no sponsor) to cover their stay in Algeria.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nMost visitors normally enter Algeria by plane.\n\nThe main international airport and point of entry in Algeria is Houari Boumediene Airport (ALG IATA), which is situated in Algiers, the capital city. The airport is well-served by intercontinental flights.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Algerian train company is named SNTF[dead link] and tickets can be bought at train stations. On-line booking does not appear to be possible any more; timetables are subject to changes; the best way is to ask at the train station. The network in the north is dense. You can reach Algeria by train from Tunisia, although you will have to change trains at the border post. All border points with Morocco are closed.\n\nIf you can, try to catch the newer trains as they are more comfortable and climate-controlled.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria shares borders with six countries: Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, and Morocco.\n\nFrom Tunisia\n\n[edit]\n\nDriving into Algeria from Tunisia is the safest option.\n\nFrom Morocco\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Algerian-Moroccan border has been closed since 1994 and will remain closed for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf you like, you're more than welcome to visit settlements along the border.\n\nFrom Libya\n\n[edit]\n\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the fluid security and political situation in Libya make the Algerian-Libyan border insecure, and the two border posts have been closed since 2011. It is not possible to legally cross from Algeria to Libya by land.\n\nFrom Mauritania\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is one, new official border crossing (opened February 2024) near Tindouf, which at least some people have had success crossing.\n\nFrom Mali\n\n[edit]\n\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the unstable political situation in Mali make the Algerian-Malian border incredibly insecure, and it is unlikely foreign tourists would be able to get anywhere close to the border, let alone cross it legally.\n\nFrom Niger\n\n[edit]\n\nThe poor security situation in Saharan Algeria, the risk of terrorism, and the unstable political situation in Niger make the Algerian-Nigerien border incredibly insecure, and it is unlikely foreign tourists would be able to get anywhere close to the border, let alone cross it legally.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe prices aren't usually cheaper than flying so if you can and have no car nor any huge amount of baggage, take a plane. Most connections are offered by Algérie Ferries.\n\nFrom Spain:\n\nAlicante to Algiers and Oran\n\nAlmeria to Ghazaouet and Oran\n\nBarcelona to Algiers\n\nValencia to Mostaganem\n\nFrom France:\n\nMarseille to\n\nAlgiers\n\nBejaia\n\nOran\n\nSkikda\n\nFrom Italy:\n\nNapoli to Tunis & take a road for 1 hour\n\nRoma (Civitavecchia) to Tunis & take a road for 1 hour\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nWith an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), travelling between major cities in Algeria can take a lot of time and can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the country's immense geography, the uncertain security situation, and the lack of adequately developed infrastructure, the most convenient way of getting around the country is by plane.\n\nAlgeria has a very small airlines industry ― only four airline companies operate in the country ― and all the airline companies are owned by the government.\n\nThe two main airline companies are as follows:\n\nAir Algérie is Algeria's national carrier and offers flights to almost any Algerian city. The airline uses Houari Boumediene Airport as its hub.\n\nTassili Airlines, like Air Algérie, uses Houari Boumediene Airport as its hub and will take you all over Algeria. It is a subsidiary of Sonatrach, the largest company in Africa and one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nIt's usual to take a taxi to travel near or in cities. The prices are pretty moderate but when travelling between bigger cities with large distances taxis are the same or more expensive as flying. Try to avoid unofficial taxis since it's very likely the driver will rip you off. Most taxis have no taximeter so arrange a price in advance. Many drivers will try to take advantage of your lack of knowledge but never pay more than DA30 per km regardless of what you are told. Tipping is not necessary but you can round up to the next DA10.\n\nUber doesn't operate in Algeria, but a similar app named Yassir does.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nThe road network is well developed in the north. The Algerian government has made much improvements regarding road building; new highways were built to replace the older roads. The most important highway is the 1200 km long N1 (Route est-ouest) from Annaba to Oran, almost all bigger cities in the north are connected to this highway including Algiers.\n\nA car is not absolutely necessary because of the well run public transportation system, but could be sometimes useful to reach more remote areas. Keep in mind that the driving habits of the locals are completely different compared to those of Europeans and that driving rules and prohibitive signs are more seen as guidelines, even by the police! It would be a wise decision letting a local Algerian do the driving for you in the first few days to get an impression of the driving style. If this is not possible it's recommended to stay on the highways.\n\nDo not try to reach the Saharan areas with a car other than a 4x4: occasional dunes on the roads and extreme temperature changes will offer a challenge for the driver and the car.\n\nAs of 2018, fuel did not cost more than DA50 a liter.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgerian railways are operated by SNTF[dead link]; the trains and lines are being modernised. Ten comfortable high-speed trains named Autorail were bought, and two of them are in operation. Though the website is useful for checking times etc, tickets can not be bought online, only at the train stations. Prices are quite moderate but more expensive than buses or taxis, but in return you will have more comfort and enjoy wonderful landscapes.\n\nMain routes:\n\nAlgiers to Oran, five daily departures from Agha Station, this journey takes 4-5 hours, 2nd Class: DA900-1130, 1st Class: DA1200-1530.\n\nAlgiers to Annaba, departing each evening at 19:40 and arriving in Annaba (via Constantine) at 05:38 the following morning. 2nd Class: DA900, 1st Class: DA1270.\n\nAlgiers to Constantine as above\n\nOther routes:\n\nAlgiers to Touggourt, departing daily at 18:10, arriving in Touggourt at 05:00 the following morning. 2nd Class: DA1500, 1st Class: DA2005.\n\nOran to Bechar, two daily departures. A daytime train leaves Oran at 10:20, while the night-train leaves at 20:30. 2nd Class: DA975, 1st Class: DA1370.\n\nAnnaba to Tebessa, leaving Annaba at 16:40 and arriving in Tebessa at 21:49. 2nd Class: DA255, 1st Class: DA360.\n\nBy tram\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria has one of the most developed tram networks in all of Africa. As of 2023, there are tram networks in six major cities: Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Sidi Bel Abbes, Ouargla, and Setif.\n\nThe agency responible for the operation and maintenance of the tram network is Société d'exploitation des tramways (SETRAM)[dead link].\n\nGetting around Algeria by tram is remarkably economical; a ticket typically costs DA40.

Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the lesser-known treasures that lie within.\n\nAlgiers, the renowned White City, may not be as heavily touristic as one would expect, considering its pivotal role in Algeria's economic, political, and cultural life.

The Turquoise Coast in Oran stands out as one of the country's finest beach destinations, perfect for relaxation. Annaba, Skikda, and Ghazaouet also offer beautiful coastal spots. For visitors near Algiers, the resort town of Sidi Fredj is an undeniable gem.\n\nNational parks\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria is more than just a barren, flat, hot desert country. The country boasts an array of beautiful national parks brimming with natural beauty.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria is full of Roman ruins & 10th-century desert towns. Some of which are:\n\nTassili N'Ajjer National park: A national park in southern Algeria with tons of cave arts and dramatic sandstone formation.\n\nMonument of the martyrs: Iconic monument honoring independence, the people who died for the country, and veterans.\n\nThe church of Nôtre Dame of Africa: a Catholic church with dramatic views in Oran\n\nHamma scientific Experiments Park: gracious 19th-century botanical gardens.\n\nFortaliza de Santa Cruz: mountaintop fort with scenic city views.\n\nKetchaoua Mosque: grand mosque build in 17th-Century.\n\nRoyal Mausoleum of Mauritania: Likely a tomb of an Egyptian princess in Tipaza, Algeria.\n\nGrand mosque of Algeria: Minarets viewing platform and a huge hall.\n\nTikja: Winter ski resort with hiking in the summer.

Many Algerians are multilingual.\n\nAlgerian Arabic (also known as Darja), the local vernacular, is spoken natively by about 75-80% of the population. Algerian Arabic is often considered to be more difficult than other dialects due to its unique features and regional variations. The dialect is used primarily in informal and spoken communication and is not typically used for formal or written communication. If you don't know the local dialect, do not despair; all Algerians learn Modern Standard Arabic at school, so you should have no problems communicating in major cities.\n\nAlgerian Arabic has a lot of similarities with other Maghrebi dialects, including Tunisian and Moroccan Arabic. If you have some knowledge of Moroccan Arabic, you should have no problems getting by since Moroccan and Algerian Arabic are, to a significant extent, mutually intelligible.\n\nMany Algerians who were born during French colonial rule (prior to the 1960s) are unable to read or write Arabic.\n\nKabyle is the most commonly spoken Berber language and is primarily spoken in cities such as Bejaia, Bouira, and Boumerdes. Berber was made an official language after major protests in 2002, and the language is taught in Algerian schools.\n\nFrench, although it has no official status, has been referred to as the \"lingua franca\" of Algeria. It is taught in Algerian schools from an early age, and it is widely used in everyday business. French is often used to transliterate Arabic words. For example, the name Yasin is transliterated as Yacine. Although many Algerians are competent in French, particularly those older than 35, many Algerians consider the language as a painful reminder of French colonial rule and in schools it is being deprioritized by the government in favor of English. However, this trend is reversed in Kabyle areas, where French is still widely spoken, including by younger people, and people will be happier to hear French than they will to hear Arabic, since in Kabyle areas, Arabic is seen as the \"oppressor's language\". Regardless of whether you speak French or Arabic in the \"wrong\" place, if you are a foreign tourist, people will be welcoming regardless of whether you are speaking a \"culturally negative\" language.\n\nEnglish is gradually gaining popularity as a preferred language for learning, although a significant majority of Algerians have limited to no knowledge of it. Highly educated Algerians may be competent in English. The Algerian government is actively promoting the language, but some, including politicians in France, see this as an attempt to diminish French influence in the country.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nMoney\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: You are not allowed to take Algerian dinars out of Algeria. Residents of Algeria may export up to DA10000.\n\nAlgerian currency is the Algerian dinar, denoted by the symbol \"د.ج\" or \"DA\" (ISO code: DZD). There are coins of DA5, DA10, DA20, DA50, DA100 and DA200. Banknotes are issued in denominations of DA100, DA200, DA500, DA1,000 and DA2,000.\n\nMoney can be exchanged at banks or post offices. Make sure the exchanged bills are in good condition; people tend to be picky with accepting ripped and older bills. Be careful with currencies other than euros or US dollars: finding a bank that exchanges less common currencies could be complicated.\n\nA better exchange rate can usually be found by exchanging money through unofficial money changers on street corners. There are locations where this is a widespread practice. The exchange rate offered is generally better than the official rate. It seems to be a very safe practice and is often done in view of police, who don't seem concerned.\n\nATMs are widely available and can be found in every post office or larger bank where you can withdraw Algerian dinar with any major credit card and Maestro cards. If a pin with six numbers is necessary, enter two zeros before your pin.\n\nMany Algerian-branded ATMs don't work for foreign cards (even when showing that they support Mastercard or Visa). You may have luck with Societé Générale ATMs.\n\nGenerally speaking, Algeria is very cash-based, and most establishments won't accept credit cards. Some hotels do (in particular larger establishments), but many don't. Bringing an ample supply of Euros or US dollars in cash can result in much cheaper travel by taking advantage of the much better exchange rates offered by the unofficial exchange market, as mentioned above.\n\nAlthough the Algerian dinar has had a relatively stable exchange rate with the Euro and Dollars for the past 10 years, there still exists a significant parallel (\"black\") currency exchange market. Parallel exchange rates in between August 2018 and 2024 have remained around DA215-DA240 to the euro at the parallel market versus around DA145 at the official Forex market rate. Thus, travellers willing to exchange euros will be roughly 50% more purchasing power. The parallel market is de facto permitted in Algeria despite being de jure illegal. You will not find normal exchange houses, not even at the airport. For instance, the main square for parallel currency exchange in downtown Algiers is done fully under the eyes of a heavy police presence, ensuring safety in the location despite the large volumes of cash changing hands in public.\n\nCosts\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria is a remarkably economical country; an underground metro ticket normally costs DA50 and the monthly rent for an apartment, depending on the area, is between DA40,000-100,000 per month.\n\nDA100-1,000 will get you a full meal or a bus ride from one major city to another.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: North African cuisine\n\nAlgerian cuisine is a mix of Mediterranean and North African flavors, with a strong French influence. Algerian cuisine is full of flavorful dishes such as tagines, couscous, and pastilla. Despite its rich flavors and vibrant ingredients, Algerian cuisine is not as widely known or appreciated as other Mediterranean or North African cuisines. Still, that shouldn't stop you from fully experiencing Algerian gastronomy.\n\nFettate (Sahara speciality, in Tamanrasset)\n\nTaguella (bread of sand, a nomad speciality)\n\nCouscous (steamed semolina with sauce containing meat and/or potatoes, carrots, courgette, and chick peas)\n\nBuseluf (cooked lambs head)\n\nDowara (stew of stomach and intestines with courgette & chick peas)\n\nChorba (a meaty soup)\n\nRechta (hand made spaghetti, usually served with a clear chicken broth, potatoes & chick peas)\n\nChakchouka (normally, it has green peppers, onions and tomatoes; egg may be added)\n\nMechoui (charcoal grilled lamb)\n\nAlgerian pizza\n\nTajine (stew)\n\nMhadjeb (A dish which is a kind of flaky pancake made from semolina traditionally stuffed with onion, tomatoes, garlic, pepper, and spices)\n\nDesserts and snacks\n\nQalb El Louz (Sweet dessert made from layers of buttery semolina and ground almonds. Flavoured with orange blossom and a honey syrup, it is bursting with flavours and summery aromas. Each slice is topped with a whole almond for a lovely crunch.)\n\nBaklawa (Almond cake consists of many layers of very thin dough carefully hand crafted and drenched in honey)\n\nKtayef (A kind of baked vermicelli, filled with almonds and drenched in sugar, syrup, and honey)\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria produces a selection of wine (not in big volume) and also beer. Algeria was once famous for its high quality wines. The new production is also of very high quality, particularly the red wine. Locally produced beer is also of a very high standard. Algeria is a majority Muslim country, so you do not find alcohol sold everywhere, but it is not hard to find it. Wine and alcoholic drinks are sold in the few bar restaurants in the big cities, better hotels, and night clubs. Some bar/restaurants can be found in nice parks, so if you are in a nice wooded park, look for the restaurants. The fast food restaurants that are open and affordable to the public do not sell beer, and the coffee shops do not sell alcohol. If you visit Algiers or coastal cities, there are fish restaurants in almost every fishing port, the fishing is traditional and the fish sold is very fresh; usually, these restaurants sell alcohol but you have to ask (do not expect to see it, some times it is on the menu, some times not).\n\nFinally, you can buy your own bottle of Algerian wine to take home in discreet shops that sell alcoholic drinks. It is better to buy it at the Algiers airport, though expect to pay €15 per bottle. In smaller towns, buying alcoholic drinks can be challenging; you usually find them at the edge of the towns in sketchy areas and the conditions in which the alcohol was kept are sometimes questionable. Some Muslims drink but they consider it a sin. It is in private but socially. If someone invites you into his home and does not offer alcohol, he expects you not to be drunk or smell of alcohol, and does not expect you to bring your own bottle or even discuss drinking alcohol in front of his wife and children.\n\nNon-alcoholic\n\nMediterranean juices (grenadine, orange)\n\nVery sweet green tea\n\nStrong coffee\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nFinding suitable accommodation in Algeria is not a challenging task, as the country offers a wide range of housing options, including luxury hotels and budget-friendly alternatives. For those seeking a luxurious experience, beautiful deluxe rooms for couples are available at prices ranging from €150-250 per day. Conversely, low-budget tourists can find rooms priced as low as €10-45 per day. Luxury hotels provide an array of services, including cafeterias, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and pools, ensuring a delightful stay.\n\nDuring the summer season, which spans from June 15 to August 31, many property owners rent out houses and cottages along the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the area from Port Say (Marsa Ben M'hidi) to El-Kala. Prices for these rentals vary depending on the number of rooms, usually ranging from €700-3000 per month, inclusive of electricity. It is advisable to make advance reservations through acquaintances or travel agencies to secure the desired accommodation. Additionally, many Algerians utilise internet ads for housing rentals, although it is recommended to send a trusted individual to inspect the property before making any payments, as some offers may appear attractive but prove to be deceptive.\n\nAnother notable attraction is the Meskoutine Hammam complex, which offers various amenities such as spas, pools, and more. Situated near a mesmerizing waterfall that boasts a natural hot water source with a temperature of 98 °C (208 °F), this site holds the distinction of being the second most sought-after hot spring in the world, surpassed only by the geyser in Iceland. The prices for bungalows in this complex vary depending on the number of rooms, typically ranging from DA1500-3000 per day.\n\nUnder current Algerian laws, non-Algerians are not allowed to purchase real estate in Algeria.\n\nLearn\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough education is free and mandatory for Algerians aged 6 to 15, the Algerian educational system has been criticised for being poorly maintained. Very few travellers, if any, take advantage of learning opportunities in the country. Unless you're fluent in either Arabic, French, or both, learning opportunities in Algeria are unlikely to be of interest to you.\n\nThe oldest and most prestigious university in the country is the University of Algiers.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nEmployment opportunities in Algeria are limited and rates of pay are low. A lack of economic diversification, a poor educational system, rigid labour conditions, a high dependence on oil and gas revenues, and restrictive regulations on foreign investment all contribute to the country's poor labour market. Successive Algerian governments have done little to create enough employment opportunities for people.\n\nOne seldom manages life in the country effectively without knowing either Arabic, French, or both, so try to acquire the necessary language skills. Doing so will open many doors for you.\n\nThe largest employer in Algeria is the Algerian government and the government employs 30-40% of the Algerian workforce. If you manage to secure employment in Algeria, there's a good chance you might end up working for the Algerian government because the government has controlling stakes in many Algerian companies.\n\nAlgerian companies are hierarchical and there are set expectations for both senior managers and junior employees. Senior managers are generally expected to be decisive and demonstrate leadership qualities, and junior employees are generally expected to follow their superiors at all times.\n\nWhile being a foreigner puts you at an advantage (Algerians generally trust foreign skills more than local skills), the importance of doing things the \"Algerian way\" cannot be overstated. Taking too much time to make a decision, showing no interest in doing tasks, not having good morals, not greeting superiors properly, and openly disagreeing with your superiors will undoubtedly distance you from people.\n\nIt is not unusual for Algerians to hire their close friends and family members. Algerians do not see this as an unfair practice; rather, they consider it gratifying to help others in need.\n\nThe working week typically runs from Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday are rest days.\n\nThe Algerian authorities do not take too kindly to people abusing Algerian immigration laws; a lot of migrants from West Africa and the Sahel often try to enter Algeria illegally (without any paperwork and documentation) in search of better opportunities in Algeria. Many of these migrants work as labourers. Given Algeria's proximity to Europe, some migrants try to enter Europe.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Algeria's security concerns are mainly due to regional instability. There is a heightened risk of kidnapping, robbery, and terrorist attacks in rural, mountainous, border, and remote desert areas of North Africa. Do not travel near the southern border. Extremist groups take advantage of porous borders to carry out attacks. (Information last updated 13 Dec 2023)\n\nDo not travel to or in Saharan Algeria overland if you have no experience with driving in desert areas or knowledge of Algerian roads. The area is sparsely populated (which means help is limited), and you can get lost easily if you don't know what you're doing. For this reason, access the area by plane.\n\nDo not travel after nightfall; travel by plane if you can, instead of by car; travel with public transports; avoid minor roads; ask the police or gendarmes if you are unsure about your surroundings. Check the travel advice on the Australian, Canadian, Irish and New Zealand government websites.\n\nTravel is heavily discouraged for Jews, as antisemitism is ubiquitous in Algeria. Do not speak about any aspects of Judaism or Israel, and if you do happen to be Jewish, don't reveal it.\n\nPolitical unrest\n\n[edit]\n\nSince gaining independence in 1962, Algeria has experienced a long history of political instability. Anti-government protests and demonstrations are not uncommon, and they can turn violent pretty quickly.\n\nDo not take part in political protests or make strongly worded comments against the government on social media; people, including dual citizens of Algeria, have been prevented from leaving the country for doing that.\n\nBe vigilant and aware of your surroundings; if you see any signs of a protest or disturbance, you should leave the area immediately and seek a safe place.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you monitor and listen to local media during your stay in Algeria.\n\nExtreme weather\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Hot weather\n\n90% of the country is covered by the Sahara desert. Algeria is a very hot country and temperatures can go as high as 50 °C (122 °F). Be sure to hydrate often and wear appropriate clothing to deal with the heat.\n\nTerrorism and banditry\n\n[edit]\n\nAreas near the borders with Niger, Mali, and Mauritania are unsafe due to general lawlessness. Generally speaking, tourists have little or no reason to go to those areas as they have nothing that interests tourists. The exception to this is the Tadrart Rouge, which is on near the border with Niger but which is safe for travel. Note that although the security situation in Libya has significantly improved in the past few years, the two border crossings with Libya and Algeria, at Ghat and Ghadames, remain closed for the foreseeable future (updated Jul 2024).\n\nAntiquities\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria has strict laws concerning the export of antiquities. If you buy a souvenir that looks old or antiquated, try to obtain the necessary documentation for it. Better to be safe than sorry. Not doing so will land you in serious trouble with the Algerian authorities.\n\nPhotography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria may be replete with wonderful photo opportunities, but you should steer clear of photographing government buildings, security installations, or military/law enforcement personnel.\n\nLGBT travellers\n\n[edit]\n\nAs is the case throughout the Arab world and the Middle East, homosexuality is frowned upon by the vast majority of Algerians. Open display of such orientations may result in open contempt and possible violence.\n\nRacism\n\n[edit]\n\nAlgeria is, to a significant extent, a welcoming country. Hospitality is a cornerstone of Algerian culture, and Algerians consider it shameful not to give a guest a warm welcome.\n\nThis being said, Black-skinned people may be incorrectly assumed to be migrants from the Sahel and may attract unwanted attention from the authorities.\n\nAlgerian dual citizens\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you are an Algerian citizen – being a dual citizen of Algeria or having an Algerian father – possessing another passport will not exempt you from mandatory military service (applicable to men only) and grant you consular access and protection in the event you get detained or arrested.\n\nWomen travellers\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you are married to an Algerian, you do not require permission from your husband to depart the country.\n\nForeign women often attract the attention of Algerian men. Being overly friendly to or making direct eye contact with an Algerian man may cause him to think that you're \"into\" him.\n\nBe warned that some men may sexually harass you. If this ever happens, don't be afraid to create a scene and don't feel the need to be polite; no woman should put up with rotten behaviour like that.\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Algeria has a universal healthcare system that covers all citizens and provides free medical care at public facilities, the public healthcare system is notorious for being poorly maintained; the system has been beset by underfunding, understaffing, overcrowding, corruption, and mismanagement. In addition, expect little to no help if you're not proficient in Arabic, French, or both. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many of the problems facing Algeria's already troubled healthcare system. Private medical facilities are generally much better equipped than public medical facilities.\n\nMedical care in Southern Algeria, particularly in the Sahara, is virtually non-existent, even for non-citizens. If you’re planning a trip to the area, it’s advisable to bring your own medical supplies.\n\nAlgeria is sometimes struck by localized power cuts during summer in the south, which means that refrigerated foods may go bad. Therefore, you should keep that in mind when eating in restaurants, as the likelihood of getting food poisoning is always there.\n\nMosquitoes are also a problem in Algeria, but they are just a nuisance, as malaria is not common. In urban areas, there is periodic city-wide spraying against mosquitoes.\n\nDo not expect very good water quality in southern Algeria, for drinking you can buy bottles of water instead of drinking tap water, they are cheap at DA40 for 1,5L, so 5L of good water costs less than US$1.\n\nRespect\n\n[edit]\n\nRamadan\n\nRamadan is the 9th and holiest month in the Islamic calendar and lasts 29–30 days. Muslims fast every day for its duration and most restaurants will be closed until the fast breaks at dusk. Nothing (including water and cigarettes) is supposed to pass through the lips from dawn to sunset. Non-Muslims are exempt from this, but should still refrain from eating or drinking in public as this is considered very impolite. Working hours are decreased as well in the corporate world. Exact dates of Ramadan depend on local astronomical observations and may vary somewhat from country to country. Ramadan concludes with the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which may last several days, usually three in most countries.\n\n11 March – 9 April 2024 (1445 AH)\n\n1 March – 29 March 2025 (1446 AH)\n\n18 February – 19 March 2026 (1447 AH)\n\n8 February – 8 March 2027 (1448 AH)\n\nIf you're planning to travel to Algeria during Ramadan, consider reading Travelling during Ramadan.\n\nAlgerians, North Africans, and Arabs in the Gulf share a common culture; therefore, much of what is considered good manners in the Arab world applies to Algeria.\n\nHonour is an important cornerstone of Algerian culture and forms the basis of all relationships in the country. Algerians believe that turning down someone's request causes them to lose honour. Be smart about what you say openly — criticising someone in public or making someone look bad in front of others can cause an Algerian to lose their honour, i.e., lose face. While it's not a crime to publicly shame someone in Algeria, Algerians are generally remarkably sensitive to strongly worded comments and won't hesitate to react with anger if you do anything that makes them feel unvalued and disrespected.\n\nAsk questions about or show some interest in Algerian history, geography, tourist attractions, and culture; this will get Algerians to like and respect you. As is the case anywhere, Algerians appreciate good comments about their country, customs, and culture.\n\nShow respect to elders. Act politely around someone older than you or in a position of authority, and do not say or do anything that would make them feel challenged.\n\nThe terms \"brother\" and \"sister\" are often used to address people. They are not considered offensive.\n\nAlgerians generally value their privacy. That being said, it's not rude to ask if someone's married or if they have children.\n\nSensitive issues\n\n[edit]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDomestic politics are both highly sensitive and polarised. Algerians, in general, have a strained relationship with their government and it is common for them to express feelings of frustration, annoyance, and anger towards their government and politicians. While it's not a social faux pas to discuss politics, try to avoid stating your opinion on local politics; Algerians may not appreciate what you have to say.\n\nAvoid talking about Morocco. Although there are strong cultural, religious, and historical ties between the two nations, Algerian-Moroccan relations have been strained by several social and political issues.\n\nAvoid being overly enthusiastic about France. The French occupation of Algeria was a period of great suffering for many Algerians. Thousands of Algerians were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, exiled, and mistreated by the French, and Algerians feel that France hasn't done enough to acknowledge the harm it has caused to Algeria. In France, Algerians are sometimes discriminated against and treated with a degree of contempt. If you are of French-Algerian heritage, you should be extra careful; demonstrations of enthusiasm for France might get you labelled as a \"harki\" (a historically contested term with negative connotations) or a \"traitor\".\n\nEthnicity is a very sensitive subject in Algeria. The Berbers, who make up 15-20% of the population, have a long history of being mistreated by the Arab-dominated Algerian government and have long struggled for autonomy and cultural rights. It would be considered awkward to ask an Algerian about what their ethnicity is; it could cause them to believe that you are questioning their loyalty to Algeria. Keep in mind that some Algerians believe that Algeria is not an Arab country.\n\nTry to not discuss the Algerian Civil War. Tens of thousands of Algerians perished during the war and it is still a wound in the national consciousness.\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nIslam is the state religion of Algeria, and is, at least on paper, practiced by 99% of the population. That being said, there's no special dress code in effect and Algerians are generally not as religious as their Arab counterparts. Algerian dress styles are generally similar to European dress styles. It's advisable to dress conservatively so that you don't stand out like a sore thumb.\n\nWhen visiting sites of religious importance, behave and dress well. Some mosques may be off limits to non-Muslims. If in doubt, ask.\n\nDuring Ramadan, you should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing in public. Not doing so would be seen as insensitive and disrespectful.\n\nAnything hinting at proselytism will neither be appreciated nor welcomed.\n\nSmoking\n\n[edit]\n\nAll cigarettes are sold freely.\n\nSmoking in the presence of someone who is not a smoker in a public place requires his permission. If someone does not like the smoke, coughs, or asks you not to smoke, just stop and say sorry. This is what the locals do. If you are invited to someone's house, do not smoke unless the host does and after he does, you can ask for permission to smoke.\n\nIf you are in a restaurant or coffee terrace where people smoke, you can smoke, but if you are with locals who are not smokers, ask them first if it is okay. Fewer and fewer people smoke, because of a global health awareness campaign.\n\nIf you are a non-smoker, you will still find it unpleasant in many public places because of smoking.\n\nConnect\n\n[edit]\n\nMobile phone connections\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 3 main mobile services in Algeria - Mobilis, Djezzy and Ooredoo (previously Nedima). It is easy to procure a pre-paid sim card for one of these operators at any airport. In February 2022, a SIM card with 60 GB of data was sold by Ooredoo for DA2500. There are several general stores all over the country which will sell you refill cards for these carriers. 3G services were launched on 1 December 2013, and 4G is available in a selection of major cities by all carriers.\n\nInternet connection\n\n[edit]\n\nThe only internet provider is the government owned Algerie Telecom which offers ADSL internet with speeds that vary from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps and prices of DA1600 to DA7200 respectively. 4G LTE is also available, but speeds are very slow and service is not very good in rural areas.\n\nThis country travel guide to Algeria is an outline and may need more content. It has a template, but there is not enough information present. If there are Cities and Other destinations listed, they may not all be at usable status or there may not be a valid regional structure and a \"Get in\" section describing all of the typical ways to get here.
