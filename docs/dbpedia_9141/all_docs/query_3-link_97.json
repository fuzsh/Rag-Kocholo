        "text": "History\n\nEarly Algerian Civilizations\n\nThe earliest recorded history in Algeria dates back to 6000 BCE with a depicted in the wall art of Tassili n’Ajer (see “Art” section below for more details). Throughout ancient Algerian history, the majority of people lived in nomadic tribes, until these bands of nomads coalesced into larger groups to establish the Imazighen (the term Berber is pejorative) civilization. The Imazighen were the original inhabitants of the Maghreb, an area composed of modern day Algeria, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\n“Amazigh,” or the plural “Imazighen” are the names they use to refer to themselves. As the Imazighen civilization was established, three The distinct Imazighen kingdoms arose — the Mauri in Morocco, Massyli in Tunisia, and the Masaesyli in Algeria. Ruled by powerful kinds, the Massyli and Masaesyli had combined into the Kingdom of Numidia in the 2nd century BCE. The Imazighen kings had strong trade ties with Numidia and Rome. During Rome’s civil war (130-30 BCE), Roman factions sought the Imazighen kings’ aid to control the empire. In 24 CE, the Romans annexed the Imazighen kingdom of Numidia.\n\nAlgeria was conquered by the Romans and then the Vandals occupied it in 429 for only four years. They then were drive out by the Byzantine occupation, which introduced Islam to Algeria.\n\nThe Introduction of Muslim Rule\n\nArabs’ arrival meant converting Maghreb residents to Islam. For the next four hundred years, various caliphates ruled the land. The Abbasid Caliphate succeeded the Umayyads in 750, which was then followed by the Rustumids until the 10th century. Two groups subsequently arose with the intention of spreading Islam beyond North Africa: the Almoravids and the Almohads. The Almoravids, a Imazighen tribe from southwestern Sahara, practiced a less strict version of Islam than the Almohads. The Almoravids marched their way into Spain through Morocco to rule the Maghreb from 1062-1147. The Almohads who replaced them until 1269, were an Amazigh tribe from Morocco that forced Christians and Jews to either convert or identify themselves as non-Muslim through their attire.\n\nIn 1492, after centuries of Muslim rule, the Spanish monarchs Isabel of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon occupied the Maghreb and expelled Muslims from Spain. The Spanish created fortress colonies, called presidios, along the Mediterranean coast and forced the Muslims to pay tribute to the Spanish crown. Barbary pirates from Algeria prevented Spanish ships from delivering supplies to the ruling presidios.\n\nAlgeria Under the Ottomans\n\nKhayr al-Din, a pirate known as Barbarossa (“Red Beard”) to the Europeans, successfully resisted Spain. He knew that a handful of pirates were powerless to stop Spanish occupation, so he called upon the Ottoman Empire to conquer Algeria and protect it from the Spanish. The Ottomans accepted al-Din’s request and added Algiers to the empire as a tribute-paying vassal state. With the support of the Ottoman Empire and its forces, Khayr al-Din managed to defend Algeria and drive out the Spanish.\n\nFor the next three centuries, while the regency of Algiers remained a vassal state to the Ottomans. Algerians retained a great deal of independence under the Ottomans. Ruling elites were usually Turkish military men organized into a council and a Dey who was Algerian or council elected ruling office was installed by an Ottoman sultan. However, only an Ottoman official in Algiers was the judge of the Islamic court.\n\nThe autonomy granted to Algiers had both advantages and disadvantages. Their connection to the Ottoman Empire protected them from larger powers, and the dey engaged in trade and agreements directly. However, the dey held little legitimacy in the eyes of other powers. For example, in 1793 and 1798, the dey demanded payment for when Algiers lent France grain on credit.\n\nFrench Colonization of Algeria\n\nDecades passed and France did not repay the debt, despite numerous requests from the dey to do so. Relations between the then-Algerian dey Husayn Pasha and French consul to Algiers Pierre Deval soured, and friendly negotiations were terminated. Charles X, the king of France, used the “Fan Affair” as justification to blockade the port of Algiers in 1830. King Charles hoped that a victory over a foreign power would rally support for the monarchy in France, so he invaded Algeria, defeated the dey’s forces, and occupied Algeria. In 1832, Abdelkader ibn Muhieddine, who wished to free Algeria from colonial rule, led a revolt against the French. After he reclaimed a large portion of Algeria, he signed the Treaty of Tafna in 1836 for the French to recognize his state. By 1839, Abdelkader controlled two-thirds of present-day Algeria. In that same year, the French occupied Constantine, a city within Abdelkader's territory. He fought the French again but to no avail. By 1843, the French controlled all of Algeria again and imposed strict laws favoring French citizens. In 1848, the French government formally incorporated coastal Algeria into France as the départements of Algiers, Oran, and Constantine.\n\nOver time, Muslim Algerians feared French discrimination. In 1865, native Imazighen and the Arab could only become French citizens if they converted to Christianity.\n\nThe Algerian War with France\n\nTensions between the French colonists and Algerians came to a head in late 1954, when the Front de libération nationale (National Liberation Front, or FLN) executed terrorist attacks in Algeria to put pressure on France. These attacks started the Algerian War with France from 1954 and 1962. The FLN and its supporters used guerilla tactics against military and immigrant targets. The French army relocated around two million Algerians from their villages to camps which prevented them from supporting the FLN in response to Algerian agency.\n\nThe French army took FLN’s strongholds in 1885 to regain control of Algeria. Some historians claim that the Algerian death toll was 1.5 million while the French claimed only 400,000 casualties from both sides. In 1961, the French public public opinion favored independence in Algeria, and soon talks opened between the FLN and French leaders. On July 3, 1962, France declared Algeria independent and installed the first president, Ahmed Ben Bella, a former leader of the FLN. To remember Algerian agency, the Battle of Algiers, a 1966 historical war film, detailed French occupation in Algeria. In the French language, there are references to Algerians like “Pied-Noir” and “Harki”. A \"Pied-Noir\" is a French person whose family lived in Algeria for several generations. Pied Noir means black feet because their feet resembled the black boots the French soldiers wore. A \"Harki\" is an Algerian person who chose to fight on the side of France despite French support of Algerian independence.\n\nThe Sand War in 1963 started when Morocco tried to conquer a part of western Algeria. The Algerian army utilized hit-and-run tactics to hold the more advanced Moroccan army at bay. The Organization for African Unity coordinated a ceasefire in 1964, although it took eight years for an agreement to be reached.\n\n20th Century Power Struggles\n\nIn 1965, Houari Boumediene, President Ben Bella’s chief of staff, seized power from Bella in a bloodless coup that abolished the government while creating a revolutionary council backed by the army. Boumediene nationalized the Algerian oil and agricultural industry to use revenues to industrialize the country. Algeria’s economy grew under his control, despite strict government censorship. The sécurité militaire (military police) effectively quelled any opposition to the new government. A constitution was formed to establish parliament and reinstated the office of the president for Boumediene to claim in 1978 for one year before dying from a rare blood disease.\n\nChadli Bendjedid, Boumediene’s former minister of defense became president. Bendjedid received backlash from pro-statists who believed in a strong central government in the late 1980s. In 1988, Algerian youth protested against the lack of economic growth and political reforms. The military stopped the riots by violently killing 500 and arresting 3,000 according to unofficial sources. In response, Bendjedid moved the government toward a multi-party system to address the population’s concerns in 1991.\n\nThe Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), a fundamentalist group that sought to establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law, won the local elections that year. The FIS won 188 seats out of 430 in the first multi-party parliament elections. Before the second round of voting took place for contested seats, the army intervened and cracked down on voters by the FIS as illegal and arresting their supporters. In 1992, the military removed the government and appointed a former leader in the FLN, Mohamed Boudiaf. Six months later, he was assassinated by a FIS sympathizer, leading to mass arrests of FIS supporters. The military declared an official state of emergency, effectively suspending Algerian citizens’ freedom of expression, assembly, and association for 19 years until the 2011 Arab Spring.\n\nThe Algerian Civil War\n\nThe Algerian Civil War broke out after conflicts between Islamist rebel groups and the Algerian government intensified in 1991. During the decade-long battle, more than 150,000 Algerians died. In 1999, the government granted FIS members amnesty and eventually the group disbanded. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a member of the FLN, was elected in 1999 with support from the military. He vowed to gain Algerian trust in national institutions, inclusion of all parties and groups in dialogue, including the then-outlawed FIS leaders. Bouteflika was reelected for his fourth and last term in April 2014.\n\nIn 2006, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) and Al-Qaeda renamed themselves as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). AQIM believes in a pure interpretation of the Quran and promised to destroy symbols of Western culture internally and externally to establish an Islamic State in Algeria. AQIM led a number of violent attacks against the government and Westerners. In June 2018, AQIM conducted a suicide bombing of the G5 headquarters in Mali. Since 2019, AQIM has been in rapid decline due to the assainatin of their leader, Abdelmalek Droukdel. Infighting ensued within the organization causing a failure to transition smoothly into the next generation.\n\nThe Arab Spring in Algeria & the Hirak Movement\n\nBoutefilka’s regime faced many serious economic and social problems, including a high unemployment rate, housing shortages, unreliable electrical and water supplies, and government corruption, among other obstacles. The wealth from oil was distributed inequitably, creating a gap between the wealthy and poor.\n\nThose suffering from these unaddressed problems prompted protests and riots influenced by the Arab Spring in 2011. To appease the demonstrators, the Bouteflika government voted to lower taxes on certain foods, promote job creation and open the state-run television to other parties. They also lifted the 19-year state-of-emergency declaration. These acts restored Algerians’ freedom of expression, assembly and association. In addition, the government offered more than $23 billion in public grants to raise the wages of civil servants, funded more food subsidies and offered interest-free loans for young entrepreneurs. Around $65 billion were invested between 2010 and 2014 for infrastructure development. According to the Washington Post, “the housing occupancy rate [decreased] from 6.8 in 1999 to 4.3.” As of 2016, 905,000 units of housing have been built. Learn more about the Algerian response to the Arab Spring in this Teach Mideast article.\n\nOn February 16, 2019, millions of non-violent protesters began filling Algeria’s streets against President Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term because of his corruption. On April 1, 2019, the 82-year-old president was forced from power. The army chief of staff, Ahmed Gaïd Salah, a former Bouteflika ally, claimed that the president was physically unable to perform his role since his 2013 stroke. The country’s constitutional council ratified Bouteflika’s resignation on April 2, 2019. An interim government named by Bouteflika presided over by a Bouteflika ally bought the country time to organize elections. Anti-government rallies (designated Hirak, or “the movement”) took place throughout and after the election as protesters demanded the elimination of the entire political establishment. Peaceful protesters demanded the withdrawal of Bouteflika and his candidacy and the removal of Prime Minister Ahmen Ouyahia. Protesters walked for anti-corruption measurements like calling for the resignation of many corrupt officials and a new era of democracy and liberty.\n\nContemporary Government Reform\n\nIn December 2019, Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected president in an election with the lowest turnout (40%) since Algerian independence in 1962. Many protestors viewed Tebboune as a Bouteflika loyalist and a close ally to army chief General Ahmed Gaid Salah.\n\nOn November 1, 2020 Algeria voted to cement changes made after Bouteflika left office such as the return of a two-term limit for president and ministers of parliament, the creation of a “corruption-busting” unit, and the requirement for public institutions to guarantee the freedom of press. Though some demands were met, the president still controls key powers and appointments. The vote had a record low tournout with only 23.8% tournout since the referendum was seen as the government's way to silence the Hirak movement.\n\nIn 2020, Algerians voted to change the constitution in a referendum supported by Tebboune to meet the demands of the Hirak movement. The president was allowed to appoint a prime minister as long as his political party held the majority in party. The PM could be removed by the National Assembly. A two term limit for presidents and ministers of parliament was reinstated. In addition, the Constitutional court replaced the Algerian Constitutional council. The general public, however, were still hesitant of the governmentl; Hirak’s lack of leadership led to his downfall. Without proper leadership and a declining economic situation, tensions amongst Algerians have been rising, becoming exacerbated through the COVID-19 pandemic growth and low vaccine rollout rates and poor safety measures. Many believe that Hirak is poised for a rebirth.\n\nWith a new government in place, Bouteflika made few public appearances and passed away in September 2021.\n\nInternational & Regional Issues\n\nAlgeria-Morocco Relations & the Western Sahara\n\nAlgeria rejects its regional rival Morocco's administration of the Western Sahara territory. The Polisario Front, a rebel movement made up of the Sahrawi people living in Western Sahara, claims the territory as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The Polisario is currently in exile. Algeria supports the Sahrawi rebels, and the Polisario Front’s headquarters is in the Algerian city of Tindouf across the border from Morocco near the area claimed by the Sahrawi people. Although there have been protests by the Sahrawi in Western Sahara, Algeria and the Polisario have not engaged in armed conflicts with the Moroccans since the UN-issued ceasefire in 1991. There are approximately 173,600 Sahrawi refugees living in Algeria-sponsored camps. Since 2003, there have been talks between Morocco, Algeria, and the Polisario to decide the future of the Western Sahara, with neither Algeria nor the Polisario willing to accept anything less than independence.\n\nTensions between the Polisario and Morocco re-ignited in November 2020 as Morocco launched a military operation into the UN-controlled buffer strip in response to the Polisario’s blockade of a key trading route to Mauritania. In response, the Polisario declared war on Morocco and a brief fire exchange occurred on November 13, 2020. Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad criticized Morocco’s military decision and claimed the move was meant to “destabilize Algeria.”\n\nIn December 2020, Morocco established diplomatic ties with Israel, making it the fourth Arab state to do so. The deal was brokered by the Trump administration in what is known as the Abraham Accords as part of a larger attempt to normalize Iraeli-Arab relations region-wide. In return for opening ties with Israel, the United States recognized Morocco’s claim on the Western Sahara. This was a substaintial success for the Moroccans but various experts deem the recognition as obstructive to self-determination. Algeria’s Prime Minister decried the normalization of the Moroccan-Iraeli relationship and stated the move “bring[s] the Israeli and Zionist entity to our borders.”\n\nThe border with Morocco is another source of tension, as both nations claim the other is harboring militants. This dispute dates back to the 1990s during the Algerian Civil War, in which Algeria accused Morocco of supporting the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, a terrorist organization. In 1994, after Morocco accused Algeria of being complicit in a bombing in Marrakesh and deported a majority of Algerians from the country, Algeria closed its border indefinitely. The border remains closed to this day, although Morocco has indicated a desire for its reopening. Algeria has been unreceptive to the rhetoric of Moroccan officials, claiming the reopening of the border would be detrimental to national security. Given the nature of tribal Imazighen culture, which crosses state lines, the closed border has had a profound impact on familial relations.\n\nMigration and Refugees\n\nAlgeria provides a way for sub-Saharan refugees to flee to Europe. In 2018, Algeria expelled over 13,000 migrants from its borders. African neighbors resented the refugees as European neighbors called for stricter controls on migration. Neither Algeria or its coastal neighbors have found a durable solution. These refugees are estimated to require over $44.9 million in financial aid from the UNHCR. As of May 2022, more than 90,000 Sahrawi refugees remain in Algeria , divided between five different camps.\n\nAlgeria-France Relations\n\nCelebrating sixty years of independence from France in 2022, despite mutual criticism of each other, Algeria and France have maintained fairly benevolent relations. French President Emmanuel Macron issued an apology in September 2021 for France’s massacre of Algerians during the war. French human rights activists have also commemorated the 1961 massacre of Algerians living in France who were killed by Paris police during demonstrations against discriminatory policies. Algeria has taken steps to decolonize such as terminating the use of French in official Algerian correspondence. President Tebboune demanded “total respect” from Macron after ill remarks by Paris on Algerian independence.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nOn February 25, 2020, Algeria reported its first case of COVID-19 from an Italian traveler that arrived on February 17. Algeria was the second African country to report a COVID-19 case following Egypt. On November 3, 2020, President Tebbone announced he tested positive for COVID-19 after being hospitalized in Germany on October 28th.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, the protest movement Hirak (“the movement”) suspended its Friday demonstrations due to COVID, making it the first Friday missed since the beginning of the movement back in 2019. It was not until October 5th that protests resumed to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the pro-democracy movement even with a ban on protests still in place.\n\nAlgeria signed a supply contract with Russia for the Sputnik V COVID-19 Vaccine. Algeria started to produce its own vaccines as of September 2021 to double the number of vaccines administered. Algeria wants to export their vaccines according to Lotfi Djamel Benbahmed, their pharmaceutical industry minister. They calculate that 70% of the population will be vaccinated by the end of the year. As of July 2022, there have been 266,487 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 6,875 deaths, reported to WHO, and a total of 15,205,854 vaccine doses have been administered.\n\nSociety\n\nAlgeria is ranked 91 out of 179 on the 2020 UN Human Development Index (HDI) Report.\n\nIn 2022, Algeria had a population of 44,178,884 million with the majority of the population (74.8% in 2022) living in urban centers. The median age in Algeria is 28.9 years old.\n\nArab-Berbers account for 99% of the total population and only 1% is made up of people from France, Corsica, Spain, Italy, and Malta. The official language of the country is Arabic, although French is often used for business and administrative tasks.\n\nWhile most Algerians are Amazigh in origin, only 15% (5.7 million) identify solely as Amazigh people who eschew Arab culture and adhere to ancient indigenous traditions. 11 million people identify as at least part Amazigh, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs. They are split into four main groups: Kabylies, Chaouias, M’zabites and Tauregs. Lastly, the Tuaregs, a traditionally nomadic people, travel through neighboring countries such as Mali, Niger, and Libya. They can be found in the Sahara Desert and speak Tuareg.\n\nBerbers call themselves Imazighen, meaning noble or free born. The term ‘Berber’ derives from the Greek barbario and the Latin barbari from which Arabs derived the term “barbariy,” meaning primitive or foreign. The Imazighen people lived in Africa long before the Arabization of Algeria in the mid-seventh century and their culture dates back almost 4,000 years. Since Algeria’s independence from France in 1962, those who identify themselves as Amazigh have been fighting the Algerian government for increased political participation, governmental recognition, and teaching and use of their languages in schools.\n\nAs of 2018, 81.4% of the population over the age of fifteen is literate. There is a sizable literacy gap between the men (87.4%) and women (75.3%), possibly because of lower school attendance rates for girls in rural communities. Despite the literacy gap, women are a driving force for social change: in 2018 the gross enrollment ratio in higher education was 64.4% for women and 38.8% for men.\n\nAfter the Arab Spring, the government established a gender quota that mandated that one-third of parliament seats and local government positions be allotted to women. This resulted in increased representation in government from 7% to 31%, and launched Algeria into first place among Arab countries, and 26th place globally in 2017, for women’s political representation at both national and local levels.\n\nThe average Algerian child can expect free and compulsory education for nine years of primary school. Less than half of students continue to secondary schooling which is divided into three branches: general, specialized/technical, and vocational. General and specialized/technical studies are completed in three years, whereas vocational studies may be completed in one to four years. The University of Algiers, established in 1909, is the oldest institution of higher learning in Algeria. It offers degrees in law, Islamic sciences and medicine.\n\nHealthcare is slowly improving in Algeria. Algeria slightly misses the WHO recommended ratio of physicians to patients at 1.13 doctors per 1,000 people as of 2021. The nation is focused on developing preventative care clinics instead of hospitals to benefit the young population. An immunization program is offered by the government, but poor sanitation and unclean water still contributes to cases of diseases like hepatitis. The poor receive free healthcare, and the wealthy are charged for healthcare based on a sliding scale. Healthcare access is increasing due to regulations that require all physicians to work in the public health sector for at least five years. Physicians are generally easier to access in the northern parts of the country than in the southern Sahara.\n\nThe child mortality rates in Algeria have steadily declined over the past decades. In 1970 the number was at 242 deaths out of 1,000 live births, and in 2019 it stood at 19.72 out of 1,000 live births."
