        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nAfter more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has since largely dominated politics. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 legislative elections led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000.Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election that was boycotted by several candidates protesting alleged fraud, and won subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The government in 2011 introduced some political reforms in response to the Arab Spring, including lifting the 19-year-old state of emergency restrictions and increasing women's quotas for elected assemblies, while also increasing subsidies to the populace. Since 2014, Algeria’s reliance on hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of declining oil prices. Protests broke out across the country in late February 2019 against President BOUTEFLIKA’s decision to seek a fifth term. BOUTEFLIKA resigned on 2 April 2019, and the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Abdelkader BENSALAH, became interim head of state on 9 April. BENSALAH remained in office beyond the 90-day constitutional limit until Algerians elected former Prime Minister Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE as the country's new president in December 2019.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n28 00 N, 3 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nland: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 11\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 6,734 km\n\nborder countries (7): Libya 989 km, Mali 1359 km, Mauritania 460 km, Morocco 1900 km, Niger 951 km, Tunisia 1034 km, Western Sahara 41 km\n\nCoastline\n\n998 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive fishing zone: 32-52 nm\n\nClimate\n\narid to semiarid; mild, wet winters with hot, dry summers along coast; drier with cold winters and hot summers on high plateau; sirocco is a hot, dust/sand-laden wind especially common in summer\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly high plateau and desert; Atlas Mountains in the far north and Hoggar Mountains in the south; narrow, discontinuous coastal plain\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 800 m\n\nlowest point: Chott Melrhir -40 m\n\nhighest point: Tahat 2,908 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, natural gas, iron ore, phosphates, uranium, lead, zinc\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 17.4% (2016 est.)\n\narable land: 3.1% (2016 est.)/permanent crops: 0.4% (2016 est.)/permanent pasture: 13.8% (2016 est.)\n\nforest: 0.8% (2016 est.)\n\nother: 81.8% (2016 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n13,600 sq km (2014)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of the populace is found in the extreme northern part of the country along the Mediterranean Coast\n\nNatural hazards\n\nmountainous areas subject to severe earthquakes; mudslides and floods in rainy season; droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nair pollution in major cities; soil erosion from overgrazing and other poor farming practices; desertification; dumping of raw sewage, petroleum refining wastes, and other industrial effluents is leading to the pollution of rivers and coastal waters; Mediterranean Sea, in particular, becoming polluted from oil wastes, soil erosion, and fertilizer runoff; inadequate supplies of potable water\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nlargest country in Africa but 80% desert; canyons and caves in the southern Hoggar Mountains and in the barren Tassili n'Ajjer area in the southeast of the country contain numerous examples of prehistoric art - rock paintings and carvings depicting human activities and wild and domestic animals (elephants, giraffes, cattle) - that date to the African Humid Period, roughly 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, when the region was completely vegetated\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n41,657,488 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 34\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Algerian(s)\n\nadjective: Algerian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nArab-Berber 99%, European less than 1%\n\nnote: although almost all Algerians are Berber in origin (not Arab), only a minority identify themselves as primarily Berber, about 15% of the total population; these people live mostly in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of Algiers and several other communities; the Berbers are also Muslim but identify with their Berber rather than Arab cultural heritage; Berbers have long agitated, sometimes violently, for autonomy; the government is unlikely to grant autonomy but has officially recognized Berber languages and introduced them into public schools\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), French (lingua franca), Berber or Tamazight (official); dialects include Kabyle Berber (Taqbaylit), Shawiya Berber (Tacawit), Mzab Berber, Tuareg Berber (Tamahaq)\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian and Jewish) <1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nFor the first two thirds of the 20th century, Algeria's high fertility rate caused its population to grow rapidly. However, about a decade after independence from France in 1962, the total fertility rate fell dramatically from 7 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.4 in 2000, slowing Algeria's population growth rate by the late 1980s. The lower fertility rate was mainly the result of women's rising age at first marriage (virtually all Algerian children being born in wedlock) and to a lesser extent the wider use of contraceptives. Later marriages and a preference for smaller families are attributed to increases in women's education and participation in the labor market; higher unemployment; and a shortage of housing forcing multiple generations to live together. The average woman's age at first marriage increased from about 19 in the mid-1950s to 24 in the mid-1970s to 30.5 in the late 1990s.Algeria's fertility rate experienced an unexpected upturn in the early 2000s, as the average woman's age at first marriage dropped slightly. The reversal in fertility could represent a temporary fluctuation in marriage age or, less likely, a decrease in the steady rate of contraceptive use.Thousands of Algerian peasants - mainly Berber men from the Kabylia region - faced with land dispossession and economic hardship under French rule migrated temporarily to France to work in manufacturing and mining during the first half of the 20th century. This movement accelerated during World War I, when Algerians filled in for French factory workers or served as soldiers. In the years following independence, low-skilled Algerian workers and Algerians who had supported the French (known as Harkis) emigrated en masse to France. Tighter French immigration rules and Algiers' decision to cease managing labor migration to France in the 1970s limited legal emigration largely to family reunification.Not until Algeria's civil war in the 1990s did the country again experience substantial outmigration. Many Algerians legally entered Tunisia without visas claiming to be tourists and then stayed as workers. Other Algerians headed to Europe seeking asylum, although France imposed restrictions. Sub-Saharan African migrants came to Algeria after its civil war to work in agriculture and mining. In the 2000s, a wave of educated Algerians went abroad seeking skilled jobs in a wider range of destinations, increasing their presence in North America and Spain. At the same time, legal foreign workers principally from China and Egypt came to work in Algeria's construction and oil sectors. Illegal migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Malians, Nigeriens, and Gambians, continue to come to Algeria in search of work or to use it as a stepping stone to Libya and Europe.Since 1975, Algeria also has been the main recipient of Sahrawi refugees from the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara. More than 1000,000 Sahrawis are estimated to be living in five refugee camps in southwestern Algeria near Tindouf.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 29.49%(male 6,290,619 /female 5,993,733)\n\n15-24 years: 14.72%(male 3,137,975 /female 2,994,056)\n\n25-54 years: 42.97%(male 9,067,597 /female 8,833,238)\n\n55-64 years: 7.01%(male 1,472,527 /female 1,446,083)\n\n65 years and over: 5.81%(male 1,133,852 /female 1,287,808) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 52.7 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 43.8 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 9 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 11.2 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 28.3 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 28 years\n\nfemale: 28.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 138\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n1.63% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 63\n\nBirth rate\n\n21.5 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 74\n\nDeath rate\n\n4.3 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 205\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.9 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 137\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of the populace is found in the extreme northern part of the country along the Mediterranean Coast\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 73.2% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 2.46% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n2.729 million ALGIERS (capital), 890,000 Oran (2019)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.88 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 1.03 male(s)/female (2018 est.)\n\nMaternal mortality rate\n\n112 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 68\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 18.9 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 20.4 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 17.2 deaths/1,000 live births\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 83\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 77.2 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 75.8 years\n\nfemale: 78.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.66 children born/woman (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 64\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n57.1% (2012/13)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 84.3% of population\n\nrural: 81.8% of population\n\ntotal: 83.6% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 15.7% of population\n\nrural: 18.2% of population\n\ntotal: 16.4% of population (2015 est.)\n\nCurrent Health Expenditure\n\n6.6% (2016)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n1.83 physicians/1,000 population (2016)\n\nHospital bed density\n\n1.9 beds/1,000 population (2015)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 89.8% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 82.2% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 87.6% of population (2015 est.)\n\nunimproved: urban: 10.2% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 17.8% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 12.4% of population (2015 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n<.1% (2018 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS\n\n16,000 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 89\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths\n\n<200 (2018 est.)\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n27.4% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 38\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n3% (2012)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 99\n\nEducation expenditures\n\nNA\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 81.4%\n\nmale: 87.4%\n\nfemale: 75.3% (2018)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 14 years\n\nmale: 14 years\n\nfemale: 15 years (2011)\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\n\ntotal: 25.7%\n\nmale: 22.1%\n\nfemale: 44.9% (2016 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 46\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: People's Democratic Republic of Algeria\n\nconventional short form: Algeria\n\nlocal long form: Al Jumhuriyah al Jaza'iriyah ad Dimuqratiyah ash Sha'biyah\n\nlocal short form: Al Jaza'ir\n\netymology: the country name derives from the capital city of Algiers\n\nGovernment type\n\npresidential republic\n\nCapital\n\nname: Algiers\n\ngeographic coordinates: 36 45 N, 3 03 E\n\ntime difference: UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)\n\netymology: name derives from the Arabic \"al-Jazair\" meaning \"the islands\" and refers to the four islands formerly off the coast but joined to the mainland since 1525\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n48 provinces (wilayas, singular - wilaya);

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy, pursuing an explicit import substitution policy.Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 30% of GDP, 60% of budget revenues, and nearly 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world - including the 3rd-largest reserves of shale gas - and is the 6th-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in proven oil reserves. Hydrocarbon exports enabled Algeria to maintain macroeconomic stability, amass large foreign currency reserves, and maintain low external debt while global oil prices were high. With lower oil prices since 2014, Algeria’s foreign exchange reserves have declined by more than half and its oil stabilization fund has decreased from about $20 billion at the end of 2013 to about $7 billion in 2017, which is the statutory minimum.Declining oil prices have also reduced the government’s ability to use state-driven growth to distribute rents and fund generous public subsidies, and the government has been under pressure to reduce spending. Over the past three years, the government has enacted incremental increases in some taxes, resulting in modest increases in prices for gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol, and certain imported goods, but it has refrained from reducing subsidies, particularly for education, healthcare, and housing programs.Algiers has increased protectionist measures since 2015 to limit its import bill and encourage domestic production of non-oil and gas industries. Since 2015, the government has imposed additional restrictions on access to foreign exchange for imports, and import quotas for specific products, such as cars. In January 2018 the government imposed an indefinite suspension on the importation of roughly 850 products, subject to periodic review.President BOUTEFLIKA announced in fall 2017 that Algeria intends to develop its non-conventional energy resources. Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. Algeria has not increased non-hydrocarbon exports, and hydrocarbon exports have declined because of field depletion and increased domestic demand.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$630 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$621.3 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$602 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 36\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$167.6 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n1.4% (2017 est.)\n\n3.2% (2016 est.)\n\n3.7% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 174\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$15,200 (2017 est.)\n\n$15,200 (2016 est.)\n\n$15,100 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 109\n\nGross national saving\n\n37.8% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n37.4% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n36.4% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 13\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 42.7% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 20.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 38.1% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 11.2% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 23.6% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -35.8% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 13.3% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 39.3% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 47.4% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nwheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits;
