        "text": "Let’s travel to Algeria for 22 fun facts. Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the land of the Sahara Desert and home to seven UNESCO sites.\n\n1. Fun fact: Algeria is the largest country in Africa, and a major player in the region and world\n\nAlgeria, formally the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, is the largest country in North Africa and the tenth largest country in the world. Much of Algeria’s land is covered by the Algerian Desert, a desert in central North Africa, part of the larger Sahara Desert.\n\nIt might not surprise you that the Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert, and that Algeria is hot; the highest recorded temperature in Algeria is over 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius). What did surprise me was that Algeria isn’t one of the hottest countries in the world. The honor of country with the hottest average temperature goes to:\n\nBurkina Faso 84.7 °F (29.3 °C)\n\nMali 84.6 °F (29.21 °C)\n\nAruba 84.5 °F (29.2 °C)\n\nSenegal 84.0 °F (28.9 °C)\n\nAlgeria ranks as 117th hottest country 23.6 °C (74.5 °F). While not a member of the hot country club, Algeria is a member of several major international organizations, including the African Union, the Arab League, the OIC, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member. There are many more interesting facts about Algeria, including its diverse climate and significant historical events. Let’s get into it.\n\n2. Arabic is the Algerian language; the Algerian identity is far more complicated to untangle\n\nThe official language of Algeria is Arabic. The Algerian population speaks Arabic, Berber (Tamazight and Amazigh), or French. While English is not commonly spoken, it is taught in Algerian schools.\n\nMost Algerians are of Arab descent, and only a minority identify as Amazigh. The Amazigh are also Muslim but emphasize their cultural heritage over Arab cultural heritage. Some Amazigh have sought increased autonomy, sometimes peacefully, sometime not. While the Algerian government is unlikely to grant autonomy, it has officially recognized Amazigh languages and introduced these languages into public schools.\n\n3. The capital city of Algiers is known as “The White” for its sun-bleached buildings\n\nAlgiers is the capital city of Algeria. Algiers is known as “Alger la Blanche” (Algiers the White) because of its whitewashed buildings. Situated on the Mediterranean coast, Algiers is the largest city in Algeria and features historic sites like the Casbah of Algiers, modern architecture, and a whirl of French and Arab influences.\n\n4. Most of the country’s population is on the Mediterranean coast and in Northern Algeria\n\nMost of the Algerian population lives on the coast. Nearly 90% of Algeria is uninhabited, with most of the land being the Sahara Desert. The Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world and covers 80% of Algeria.\n\nSo despite Algeria’s size, only 12% of the population lives inland, with most people residing along the Mediterranean coast. The northern region has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and rainy winters, while the southern region is arid.\n\n5. Algeria was an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire until France seized the capital city Algiers in 1830\n\nAlgeria was an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, enjoying self-governance until 1830. France launched a military campaign and seized Algiers, the capital city. The French invasion marked the beginning of a long colonial period for Algeria, as France integrated Algeria into its empire.\n\n6. Algeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962\n\nAlgeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962, after 132 years of colonia rule. The Algerian War of Independence against France lasted from 1954 to 1962. French historians estimate that around 400,000 Algerians perished during the conflict.\n\n7. The Algerian national anthem is a war song against the French\n\nThe national anthem, “Qassaman” or “Kassaman,” was adopted in 1962 and reflects the theme of the Algerian fight for independence. The lyrics promote nationalistic ideals and principles on the front line, and championing armed uprising as the sole route to independence. It foreshadows a “day of reckoning” for France, Algeria’s former colonial ruler. Algeria’s national holiday, Revolution Day, honors the beginning of the final bid for independence.\n\n8. Algerian civil war from 1992 to 2002 was pretty ugly\n\nThe Algerian Civil War broke out across the country thirty years after independence. The war was fought between the Algerian government and multiple Islamist rebel groups from January 11, 1992, to February 8, 2002, after a coup nullified an Islamist electoral victory.\n\nThe conflict started slowly, but by 1994, violence had escalated to a point where the government’s stability was in question. The war involved extreme violence against civilians. Fatalities are estimated to be between 44,000 and up to 200,000.\n\n9. The Algerian government runs on a combination of French and Sharia law\n\nAlgeria’s legal system is a blend of the French court system and Sharia law, reflecting its colonial past and significant Muslim influence. The official religion of Algeria is Islam. Islamic symbols are on the flag and throughout the government. It is illegal to proselytize any religion other than Islam in Algeria.\n\nAncient Algeria was ruled by various empires and dynasties, including the Byzantines, Turks, Spanish, Romans, and Germanic tribes. The inhabitants converted to Islam when Muslim Arabs captured the region in the 7th century.\n\n10. The Arab conquest of North Africa (Islamic Maghreb) shaped Algeria\n\nThe Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, also known as the Arab conquest of North Africa, began in 647 and ended in 709. This period saw the Byzantine Empire lose its last remaining strongholds in North Africa to the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, particularly under Caliph Al-Walid I. These campaigns were part of the rapid early Muslim conquests that reshaped the region over a century.\n\n11.

Fossil fuels are the main export, significantly contributing to the economy and classifying Algeria as an upper-middle-income country. In 2019, Algeria had the fifth cheapest petrol in the world at $0.35 per liter due to government subsidies.\n\nA large percentage of the country’s earnings come from hydrocarbon exports, and Algeria has negligible external debt.

Algeria’s neighboring countries in Northern Africa are:\n\nMorocco (969 miles border): Algeria and Morocco share a long tumultuous history, including the Sand War in 1963 and the Western Sahara War from 1975 to 1991. The Sand War was a border conflict between Algeria and Morocco, over Morocco’s claim to Algeria’s Tindouf and Béchar provinces in Western Algeria, close to the Mauritanian, Western Saharan and Moroccan borders.
