        "text": "Discover the unspoiled regions of Algeria\n\nBecause of its geographical, historical, cultural, but also human proximity, Algeria is a country close to France that deserves to be discovered or rediscovered. The Mediterranean coastline offers unique landscapes. The culture lover will appreciate the casbahs steeped in history, the relics of conquering civilizations and empires. And the adventurer will discover at the gates of the majestic Sahara the legendary hospitality of the men of the desert.\n\nAlgiers, a unique capital of all kind\n\nVisiting the city of Algiers you will find a total change of scenery and surprises at every corner. Nicknamed \"The White city\" because of the color of its lime buildings in typical French style dating from the colonial era, Algiers has still preserved its historic buildings, and contains many monuments that deserve to be visited. Getting off the ferry in Algiers allows you to discover an African and European capital, which is now open to the world.\n\nAlgiers, the multifaceted city\n\nCapital of Algeria, Algiers is an urban unit of several million inhabitants made up of several communes. Founded in the fourth century as a Phoenician counter in Berber country, the city located on the edge of the Mediterranean is divided into several parts: the modern part is built on the plateau at sea level, crowned by the ancient city, including the Casbah (ancient citadel) which overlooks the very numerous districts of this immense city."
