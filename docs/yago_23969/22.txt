The Motion Picture Association of America's Classification and Rating Administration has denied Miramax Films' request to reduce the rating of the comedy concert film, ``Martin Lawrence: You So Crazy,' from NC-17 to R.

``We are disappointed and we are going to discuss our options with HBO and Martin Lawrence,' said Miramax spokeswoman Julie Polkes. The film was produced by HBO Independent Productions.Members of the ratings board could not be reached for comment.

The distributor's options include releasing the film as scheduled in Los Angeles and New York on March 11 with the adults-only NC-17 rating, which will severely curtail the number of theaters that will show it and media outlets that will accept its advertising.

The other most likely option is to trim some of Lawrence's seamier monologues, a process that would disrupt the real-time documentary's design and flow. The film's director, Thomas Schlamme, has said he would not know what to cut in order to please the MPAA.

``You So Crazy' is a film record of Lawrence's stand-up concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theatre. The show consists of Lawrence talking and performing physical comedy. No nudity, violence, sex or drug use is depicted, although many of those subjects are discussed in graphic terms.
