        "text": "Dennis McDonald finally got his chance to cook in Bad Boys: Ride or Die.\n\nGazing into the camera lens for the film’s final shot, the Bronx native’s typically stoic expression folded into a wry grin as if letting the audience know that, following years as the quiet afterthought, he was ready to make a fuss. It’s hard to blame him. After appearing in a minor role as Marcus Burnett’s eventual and current stepson, Reggie, in 2002’s Bad Boys II and 2020’s Bad Boys for Life, respectively, McDonald became the center of an epic action sequence in one of the movie’s most important moments. The aftermath: His once-intimidated character is now the one doing the grilling.\n\nRelated: That One Time Will Smith and Martin Lawrence Gave Me 'Bad Boys' Training\n\nMcDonald doesn’t take the hard-earned come-up for granted. Shortly after his initial appearance as a gangly teenager for one memorable shot in Bad Boys II, life started life-ing. He became a dad, and with that momentous development, acting ambitions moved to the back—right next to his baby girl’s car seat. But he never abandoned those Hollywood dreams. McDonald booked commercial castings and studied YouTube acting classes between shifts working retail. Bad Boys for Life marked his return to the big screen; this summer’s early season blockbuster Bad Boys: Ride or Die (now streamable via video-on-demand platforms) showed he’s ready for his close up.\n\nChopping it up with LEVEL, McDonald explains his preparation for the role, advice from Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and more.\n\nLEVEL: Bad Boys: Ride or Die did big numbers at the box office. How does it feel to have played a part in that?\n\nDennis McDonald: It's a big blessing because I didn't know from coming to that door in 2002 and now I'm like the action hero in the fourth movie. I never thought I would be here. I knew I had to put the work in. That's all I would do: sit there and put the work in. Now, this is what I get. Everybody gets to know who I am. Finally.\n\nWhat was it like for you to go from being in a comic relief role to suddenly being thrust into the heat of the action?\n\nWhen I found that I was going to become the action hero, I had to train Reggie to be a killer. We had to train for a good two months in Atlanta; gun training, martial arts training, stuff like that. I was just going through the motions, making Reggie still be a respectable guy, but somebody that's an assassin. I did all my own stunts.\n\nWhat was that like?\n\nThey were trying to get ready for the scene where I kicked the dude through the door. The door was too small; I was too tall. And they were trying to tell a stunt double to do it. I said, “No, I'm doing my own stunts.” They were like, “You sure?” I'm like, “Yeah.” They're like, “We'll see when time comes.” So the time comes and I see them trying to get the stunt double. I'm like, “No, no, no, I got it.”\n\nRelated: The 8 Least-Realistic Will Smith Action Movies, Ranked\n\nWhy was it so important for you to do your own stunts?\n\nI take movies and characters real seriously. While I was training, I was watching Fast and Furious and I'm like, “Yo, [viewers] got to respect me and my craft just like they respect these dudes. And I'm new, so it got to be even better.” I trained extra. I'm in my hotel training. Even when we were off set, I was training. I had to respect Reggie as a marine.\n\nYou were also in the last Bad Boys movie, but you haven’t been super active when it comes to acting. How do you get yourself into that mode to pick up where you left off?\n\nI would watch Martin and Will before they go into their acting [mode]—they would just stick to themselves. I would just stay to myself, read my lines. I like to keep Reggie as a quiet guy, but the amount of gun work that they had me doing, there was no way I could keep him quiet for so long. I had to have him bust out.\n\nWhen you first showed up in the Bad Boys' universe, you were a nervous teen going to pick up your girlfriend from Marcus’ house. Now, with a daughter of your own, does that scene hit differently?\n\nDefinitely hits different. My daughter's 21, so I definitely had to play Marcus and Mike to my daughter's boyfriends before.\n\nRelated: What Kind of Dad Will You Be When Your Kid Starts Dating?\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice Will and Martin gave you on the set?\n\nThey just tell me, “Take your time. Don't be so much in your head. If you can't remember your lines, rap your lines so it's easier to remember.” They’re just so hands-on with how they treat me. Martin [tells me] to live in the now, don't let all of this get you nervous. Just prepare, work hard, [and] practice your craft.\n\nIf you could give your 15-year-old self one piece of advice after Bad Boys II, what would it be?\n\nKeep working—it's all going to pay off. You should be working harder. I had to grow up fast. I just had a child, like, “What are we going to do?” So I was telling myself, keep working harder."
