        "text": "Was banned from appearing on NBC after he hosted Saturday Night Live (1975) on 19 February 1994. In order to appease network censors, he agreed not to do his opening monologue as planned. However, he did his routine as intended anyway, and this incurred the wrath of the network's top brass. The ban was overturned several years later. However, Lawrence is still not allowed to appear on SNL.\n\nClaims he got his start as a comedian by cheering up his mother, who was forced to support her six children by cashiering in various department stores.\n\nI'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do.\n\nYou can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values."
