        "text": "He is more than deserving!\n\nMartin Lawrence is arguably one of the greatest comedic actors of our generation. A pioneering force during the Def Jam era of comedy, Lawrence cultivated a cult-like fanbase through his hilarious television and film acting roles. His self-titled hit show, Martin, aired for five seasons on Fox, cementing him as a legend in the game and today he is still regarded in the pantheon as one of the greats. Now the Bad Boys actor is earning his flowers, receiving a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, Black Enterprise reports.\n\nLawrence also previously announced the celebratory honor via social media, letting fans know that he was joining the Class of 2023 honorees.\n\n“Ya boy is gettin his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame! An absolute honor to be among icons of entertainment!,” he wrote.\n\nLawrence was joined at the ceremony by friends, family, and peers including Tichina Arnold, Tracy Morgan, Lynn Whitfield, and fellow comedian Steve Harvey, who has known Lawrence since his stand-up comedy days, ET Online reports.\n\nWhitfield praised Martin for consistently giving women platforms over the course of his career that have empowered women and represented Black culture in the best light.\n\n“[Thank you] on behalf of all women for always presenting women as strong, for always allowing us to speak our mind, for always allowing us to be glamorous…you changed the fabric of American culture. Because before Tyler [Perry], before anyone, you presented us as we know ourselves,” she exclaimed.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“He’s done so much for us, especially in the comedy genre, man. I mean, the jobs he created and the whole Def Jam era. When you look at Def Jam [it] created more stars than any genre of anything…I had to find a way to be here to pay homage to this guy [and] to show my respect for him, for all he’s done for us,” said Harvey.\n\nMorgan echoed those sentiments and credited Lawrence for his comedy career.\n\n“All the work I’ve done is ‘cause of that man…I remember when I was a baby in that game and I got on [Def Comedy Jam]. He was in the middle of filming and I gave him a hug and he told me he loved me…and four months later, I did Def Jam…he changed my family’s life and I thank him for that — there’s no way in the world I can ever thank Martin for what he did for me,” said Morgan.\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez praised Lawrence for his talent and longevity in the industry, saying “Martin Lawrence has been a staple in pop culture for more than 30 years. This comedic genius has made many of us laugh for decades and he will continue to do so with his creative television and film moments.”\n\nLawrence is currently filming Bad Boys 4 alongside Will Smith, reprising his role as Detective Marcus Burnett in what he says is “the best one of them all.” The latest installment in the franchise comes on the heels of the 2020 Bad Boys for Life movie, which was released on the 25th anniversary of the original film. The third installment was a blockbuster hit, earning a whopping $426.5 million at the box office. Now the duo are back for more and we can’t wait to see it!\n\nThe celebration came just days after Lawrence’s 58th birthday on April 16th. He said he feels so blessed and honored to have so much support.\n\n“[This day] means the world to me and I’m so honored. I feel so blessed. I know that I’m blessed. I’m grateful to God and I’m grateful to my fans, my family, my friends and everybody that just supported and showed me love…I’m over the moon because it’s just such a great honor. Aw, man, I feel so loved,” he said.\n\nWhitfield took an opportunity to remind him that while the Walk of Fame star is a prestigious honor for his career, he has been a star for a long time in the culture and his legacy will endure forever.\n\n“And I just say, honey, if you want these people walking all over your name, fine. But I want to tell you, you are in the stars in the heavens forever, for everything you’ve done for everyone,” said Whitfield.”\n\nWe agree. Congratulations Martin! You go boy!"
