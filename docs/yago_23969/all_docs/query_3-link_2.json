Harking back to Eddie Murphy, the leather-clad comic riffs on drugs, jail, his impoverished upbringing with his mother and his luck -- or lack thereof -- with women. He also speaks at length about racism and the Rodney King ruling and subsequent riots. Lawrence even offers his unique perspective on how to maintain a successful relationship.",
