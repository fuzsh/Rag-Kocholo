        "text": "At Endorsco we strive to make sense of the complicated world of talent representation. Finding and negotiating with agents, managers and publicists can be hard work. Representatives are always changing and are often hard to locate. If you do find their contact details, you might not know how much a deal should be worth, or how to execute.\n\nEndorsco takes the guesswork out of the process by assisting you to engage their agencies and managers for endorsements and appearances, whether you work for a brand or event. We do not represent the talent directly but rather work with you to engage them through the right channels.\n\nWith years of industry experience, the team at Endorsco has built an extensive network of agency contacts all over the world, representing famous actors, athletes, musicians and other public figures on each continent. Through our network of agency contacts we are able to engage with right agents for the talent and understand their market value. We specialize in engaging multiple people represented by different agencies for large campaigns.\n\nEndorsco has developed proprietary data techniques to understand how public figures are perceived in the media and by the general public. This helps inform our understanding of who clients should be working with and our advice to you. While most of this data is kept in-house, we do release some of it publicly and it is also availabe on request to certain valued clients.\n\nThat's easy! You can complete the Typeform on the contact page or email us at contact@endorsco.com to discuss endorsement and appearance solutions for your brand or event. We look forward to working with you."
