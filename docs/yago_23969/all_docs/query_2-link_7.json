        "text": "Val Haller, a music-obsessed baby boomer and the founder of the Web site Valslist.com, matches tracks from her generation to those of her 20-something sons’ generation.\n\nWillie wrote it. Patsy recorded it. Willie covered it (that’s right, covered his own song).\n\nAnd the world loves it, still. “Crazy” has criss-crossed so many genres and has been covered by so many artists — LeAnn Rimes, Linda Ronstadt, Julio Iglesias, Don McLean and Kenny Rogers, to name a few. Willie Nelson wrote the song in 1961, and when the country music superstar Patsy Cline recorded it “Crazy” soared up the charts and became one of her signature songs, simultaneously catapulting Willie Nelson’s songwriting and performing career. For this week’s cover match, we first give a video of Willie explaining to David Letterman how he came to write it. Then, his version from 1965 (that really is Willie Nelson in a suit); “Crazy” comes at the 4:08 time marker. Then Patsy and finally, Willie again, in 1992."
