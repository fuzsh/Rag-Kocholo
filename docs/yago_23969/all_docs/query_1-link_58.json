In the late 1980s, he moved to Washington DC where he started getting interested in stand up comedy and at a certain point decided to try himself on stage. At the beginning of his career, he was involved in such comedy projects as The Improve or Star Search. His TV debut took place in 1987 when Lawrence received a role in the TV series What's Happening Now. His other notable TV projects include TV series Martin or Def Comedy Jam.
