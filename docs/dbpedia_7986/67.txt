JUHI CHATURVEDI ON VICKY DONOR

Juhi Chaturvedi spoke during the second day of Sahiya AajTak in a session titled Halla Bol. She said that she was afraid while writing Vicky Donor as she was afraid about whether she would be able to pull it off. She also said that many established heroes refused to do the film.

“There was a sense of fear when I wrote Vicky Donor. There was fear whether I could write it. The topic (sperm donation) was such that no one but Shoojit Sircar could have done it. Many established actors said no to Vicky Donor, In a way, it was good as it made us desperate. We got Ayushmann Khurranna, He was desperate (for a film) then and we were too.” said Juhi.

JUHI CHATURVEDI ON GENDER NEUTRALITY

Talking about her journey, Juhi said that the writer’s gender is irrelevant as sensitivity is gender-neutral.

“When I write, it does not matter if I am a man or a woman. Dimag ka ya buddhi ka koi gender nahi hota. Sensitivity does not have a gender. If I am a woman, it does not mean that I will have sensitivity, Just the same way, if there is a man, it does not mean that he will write rashly,” she said.
