On his 80th birthday, Juhi who's formed an acclaimed trio with Mr Bachchan and director Shoojit Sircar, recalls all that is special about the superstar.\n\nWriter Juhi Chaturvedi has worked with Amitabh Bachchan on some memorable movies like Piku , Gulabo Sitabo and even the unreleased Shoebite . On his 80th birthday, Juhi who's formed an acclaimed trio with Mr Bachchan and director Shoojit Sircar, recalls all that is special about the superstar. She reveals his process on set and his dedication to his craft can leave his co-stars both speechless and inspired as Ayushmann Khurrana found out on the sets of Gulabo Sitabo. Read on...\n\nHow do you look back at your association with Amitabh Bachchan?\n\nWhether it was Piku or Gulabo Sitabo, I knew that Mr. Bachchan was going to play those characters. I was aware of the fact that I have to write for him. So, with his personality, knowledge and the life that he has lived, I had to write both characters and take them to a level where Mr Bachchan wouldnât say 'No' after reading the script. Both those characters are different from his life. Thereâs no connection whatsoever between these characters and Mr Bachchanâs personal life. But I felt that his knowledge will add so much to my writing. So, I had to keep that in mind while creating those roles.\n\nHow did Mr Bachchan add to both these characters?\n\nThe beauty of working with Mr Bachchan is that he doesnât change anything in the script. He might say the dialogue differently but it feels satisfactory that youâre working with an actor who knows exactly what youâre writing. He will make it his own because he knows it. He owns the characters so much that you start feeling that it's him.\n\nFor example, in Gulabo Sitabo, I knew the Awadhi language and cultural nuances, but Mr Bachchan doubled the nuance with his experience of that region. In Piku too, thereâs a certain nostalgia with which he talks about Calcutta, about his first job, and that theyâd go clubbing, etc. Thereâs the memory of the past there and that was the character. Mr Bachchan going to shoot in Calcutta was perhaps a big rounding off for himself too. I think he was looking forward to going to Calcutta as much as Bhaskor (his character) was. It blended in so beautifully. When youâre writing for him, you are aware of his past, intellectual, spiritual and knowledge of the world. Itâs a fabulous experience.\n\nWhat was his process like on the sets of Piku and Gulabo Sitabo?\n\nHe used to want to rehearse each and everything loudly. And on the sets, heâs anyways tall and big but his character takes over even bigger before the scene begins. It can be a little overwhelming for his co-actors. In Gulabo Sitabo, Ayushmann was rehearsing his lines before the scene. He had marked his lines on the script. Mr Bachchan came and saw him rehearsing his lines and he enquired what was highlighted. Ayushmann told him that he had highlighted his lines only. Mr Bachchan got to know that he only learns his lines. He said something like this, âAchha, hum itne saal se bekaar hee sab kuchh yaad kar rahe the (So I was unnecessarily mugging up every line in the script for all these years).â You should have seen the expression on Ayushmannâs face. But that is the way to do a scene. You not only know your lines but everyone elseâs lines. So that you can improvise. That way you're not just responding but creating a scene.\n\nThe knife scene in Piku is an example of that. While it was pretty much shot the way it was written, the energy of that scene, everything that happens between Irrfan and Mr Bachchan, they just took over that scene. The best part was that these two were doing what they were doing, but Deepika, because that language didnât come to her naturally, she just threw the knife suddenly because she was not getting any chance to say anything. She also didn't know whether what she would say would be correct or not. So, she just threw the knife away and both the men were silent. It was all natural. But they pulled it off. That silence is where the magic lies in that scene. When Mr Bachchan is on the set, he is the character.\n\nWhat are the chances of Shoebite being released?\n\nI donât know. Bhagwan hee maalik hai uska. My association with Mr Bachchan and Shoojit Sircar began with that film. I was coming from an advertising background. I had not written any ad featuring him till then. I was told that I will be writing for Mr Bachchan and he will be saying your lines and all that. Then I was told that I need to be on the sets. I never thought that Mr Bachchan would say, âHey you, come here. Youâve written this?â And I was just sauntering on the sets. And that was of course my first interaction with him in Shimla. I said, âYes, yes.â Then he said, âCan you just say this line for me? What exactly is it?â And Iâm just looking at him. So, he just said, âOkay, good, good.â It was too overwhelming. And after that, I couldnât go back to advertising because you think that a person like him, who is so humble and dedicated, and it was snowing heavily in Shimla in 2008, he was still there. How are you ever going to work half-heartedly after that? Itâs better that you donât work.\n\nWhat's the best part of working with him?\n\nI just love it when heâs there in the film. You know that he is going to give his 200 percent. Youâre constantly trying to push yourself as well. You cannot do a shoddy job â you cannot do it anyway but perfect. That man comes with his life experience to the set every single day. And he is only giving. I believe he is like a hermit, he has denounced the world and thereâs nothing else left other than his art. When he is on the sets, you donât think of him sitting on the sets and ever thinking of his family or anything else other than the moment that heâs on the sets with that character. And the joy with which he writes his blog after the shoot gets over, he replies to his peers, shows his genuine interest in people. He is the only one.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 happiness mantras for working professionals\n\nLifestyle\n\nâShruti Haasan dazzles in a breathtakingly glamorous photoshoot â\n\nEntertainment\n\nNutritious breakfast ideas under 200 calories\n\nFood\n\nâRitika Singh photogenic in every shot â\n\nEntertainment\n\nIndependence Day: Places in India integral to the freedom struggle\n\ntravel\n\nKarishma Tanna's most attractive pics\n\nEntertainment\n\nâ10 qualities in dads every child wantsâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nFrom omen to death: Crows and their deep connection with beliefs and mythology\n\nLifestyle\n\nShubhangi Atreâs perfect ethnic looks for Independence Day\n\ntv"
