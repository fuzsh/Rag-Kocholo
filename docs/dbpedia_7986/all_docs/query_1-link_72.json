While the details about the project, including the title still remain a mystery. The screenwriter has been a long-time collaborator of filmmaker Shoojit Sircar and the advertising professional made her screenwriting debut in 2012 with Sircar’s National Award winning film “Vicky Donor”.\n\nShe went on to pen acclaimed films for Sircar, including “Madras Cafe”, “Piku”, “October” and “Gulabo Sitabo”. She was also credited for writing the Hindi dialogues of the 2019 drama “The Sky Is Pink”, another hit film which was directed by Shonali Bose and featured Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Farhan Akhtar.\n\nPC :https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2019/03/good-writing-is-time-consuming-says-screenwriter-juhi-chaturvedi-0001.jpg"
