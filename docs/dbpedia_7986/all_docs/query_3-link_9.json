        "text": "Debutants throughout showbiz history have encountered serious heartburn and heartache when they've failed to stick in the minds of the audience. But Ayushmann Khurrana had no such problems because he's stuck in our minds and how! Even as his second film Nautanki Saala is set to release this Friday, almost a year after his wet-dream debut in Bollywood as a big-hearted sperm donor in Shoojit Sircar's runaway hit Vicky Donor, Ayushmann continues to encounter jokes about his seed-y business. \"I am proud of these jokes. I don't mind it because it only shows the success of the film,\" he says.\n\nAyushmann is hoping that success sticks around with him for a long time and is not just here in spurts. Which is why for Nautanki Sala, he drew upon his own life's experiences as a theatre actor to bring authenticity to his performance. Much like he did for Vicky Donor actually, drawing upon his sperm donations in Allahabad in 2004.\n\nBut although he has worked in both mediums, acting in a film set against the backdrop of theatre was not a cakewalk for him. \"There was a very minute line of acting as theatre actors but acting for the camera. So you had to maintain that subtlety as well as the loudness of the character. That was the challenging part about playing Ram Parmar in Nautanki Sala,\" he says. Before they actually started shooting, the actors had to attend a 20-25 day acting workshop. \"It really helped us. You hardly go outside of the zone of your character. In the initial phase of your career, you should try to choose characters that you can relate to. For example in Vicky Donor being Punjabi was easy for me to play the character of Vicky, who is Punjabi. Being a theatre actor and having directed plays, it's easy for me to essay a character such as Ram Parmar. Similarly in Hamara Bajaj I am playing a struggling actor because I have been a struggling actor,\" he says.\n\nNothing, of course, prepared him for the jitters he felt during the release of his debut film. A year down the line and an envious bounty of all the Best Male Debut awards this year, he's more - how should we put it - experienced. \"I am a little easy on the second film. I've evolved as a performer with the second film - as an actor and singer. After Vicky Donor released and did so well, I feel I have created a little space for myself as an actor-singer. People recognise me and that is the biggest gratification for any artist,\" he says.\n\nHaving tasted both critical acclaim and box office success with Vicky Donor, obviously he hopes for an encore with Nautanki Saala. \"I think for an actor a mix of both box office success and critical acclaim is important but in the initial phase of your career you should be recognized as an actor for sure.\" Would he be ready to toot his horn once again for a 'Vicky Donor 2'? \"I would love to do Vicky Donor 2. Vicky Donor has given me everything. If (director) Shoojit Sircar and (screenplay writer) Juhi are ready with a script which is equally quirky I would love to do it. I don't think I have a ready audience yet. It wholly depends on the script and the film,\" he says.\n\nadvertisement"
