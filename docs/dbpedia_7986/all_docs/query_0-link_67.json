        "text": "\"I am really influenced by normal, simple, everyday life and people, like the Biji and Dolly in 'Vicky Donor', who used to drink and say whatever they felt like. These characters were so lively. I have seen these people around me. I feel I am like them, even in my social media posts. I observe them, pick up notes and moments to make a film out of it,\" the director told PTI in an interview over phone from Kolkata.\n\n\"I call it an ensemble cast or the world of 'Gulabo Sitabo' which is about the lifestyle of my characters. I just go and sit there in a corner and observe these characters through my camera. That's how I shot the film. These actors feel like people picked up from real life,\" he said.\n\nThe uncomplicated way of looking at people appears even in the main story of Mirza and Banke whose conflict has no religious angle though they come from different faiths as, according to the filmmaker, most of the people in India coexist peacefully.\n\n\"I remember I used to play football in my childhood and my team had people from different faiths and backgrounds. It had the son of the person who would take us to the school on his rickshaw or the guy who came to pick up our garbage but I never knew this. When I grew up, I was told by society, you have to become something else and he has to become something else and that divide was put in my head. My childhood didn't have that divide. We were just eight years old and would meet in the evening to play. This has had a lot of influence in my life and films,\" he said.\n\n'The advantage we had with this one is that in some shots they could not recognise Mr Bachchan. We would get the shot ready and then he would come. There were onlookers but they initially did not figure out who this man was. Slowly the word got around that it's Amitabh Bachchan and then the crowd came. We shot the film in bits and pieces like that.\"\n\nIt's his third film as a director with Bachchan after the unreleased 'Shoebite' and 'Piku', where the megastar played a hypochondriac Bengali father. While 'Piku' saw him with a wig and paunch, Bachchan sat for hours to get the prosthetics right to play Mirza in the film. Asked why he makes Bachchan transform physically so much, Sircar said it was to the credit of the megastar to accept characters that are challenging.\n\n\"I was not sure whether he will accept Mirza's character this time or we will be able to pull through it because there are chances that it can go into gimmicky or unreal but we have tried our best to make him look like Mirza,\" he said.\n\n\"We have worked together and there is a comfort level that we share. For Banke, we needed someone who had vulnerability and innocence about him. The character comes from a background where his existence is hand-to-mouth. Ayushmann and Mr Bachchan's pairing brought a lot of freshness,\" he said.\n\n\"Everybody has their own way of dealing with the process. When a film is made, its release is decided by its destiny. Nothing is bigger than that, not even me. The situation was to adapt at this moment. We can't sit at home. In that situation, my job is to put the film forward to the audience. That doesn't mean my films will not be in cinema.\""
