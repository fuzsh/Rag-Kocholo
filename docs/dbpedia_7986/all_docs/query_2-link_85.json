        "text": "The Hindi film industry is observing an increase in the number of women writers who are changing the way Bollywood tells a woman’s story. These writers have given us some memorable stories and characters, while also pushing the limits and bringing fresh perspectives to the forefront. As a result, we have a beautiful combination of women writers and actors, who are creating meaningful films that explore a range of themes and narratives.\n\nOn that note, here are eight women writers and actors collabs we want to see more of on the silver screen.\n\n1. Anvita Dutt – Tripti Dimri\n\nAnvita Dutt has written and directed Bulbbul and Qala. While the former talked about the journey of a child bride from innocence to strength, the latter talked about an abusive childhood and mental health. While Qala did have problems with execution, the attempt to delve deep into a difficult topic was there. Tripti Dimri played the lead role in both of these movies and the way she brought life to these complex characters is commendable.\n\n2. Juhi Chaturvedi – Deepika Padukone\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJuhi Chaturvedi has written films like Vicky Donor, October, Madras Cafe, etc. However, that one movie that continues to resonate with women even after years is Piku. Piku was a relatable character for many women, including me. She was independent and strong-willed. Her relationship with her father was portrayed realistically without any glossing over. Kudos to Deepika Padukone who breathed life into the character.\n\n3. Konkona Sen Sharma – Tillotama Shome\n\nKonkona wrote A Death In The Gunj and The Mirror in Lust Stories 2. A common thread in both of these films is Tillottama Shome who has nailed the roles perfectly. The actress proved her acting prowess in both of these stories. She brings out the nuances of Konkona’s characters like no other.\n\n4. Jasmeet Reen – Alia Bhatt\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDarlings was Jasmeet Reen’s directorial debut which she co-wrote with Parveez Sheikh. The movie turned out to be one of the best black comedies in Bollywood. It was a fine example of a woman telling a woman’s story and we are all up for that. Alia Bhatt gave one of her finest performance as the docile Badrunissa. The movie took on a different approach to speak about a burning issue and that captivated our attention.\n\n5. Alankrita Shrivastava – Ratna Pathak Shah\n\nAlankrita has given us memorable stories such as Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare and Bombay Begums. But one work that deserves all the recognition is Lipstick Under My Burkha. Only a woman can talk about a woman’s desires with nuance and not degrade it or make it sound lewd in the process. The movie had women with very real issues, but the way it talked about an older woman’s desire was something Bollywood had not explored before. Ratna Pathak Shah set the screen on fire with her effortless portrayal.\n\n6. Shonali Bose – Kalki Koechlin\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShonali Bose wrote Margarita With A Straw which featured Kalki Koechlin playing the role of a woman with cerebral palsy. The movie not only talks about her complex life but offers a fresh take on sexuality and desire through the lens of intersectionality. Their collaboration gave us a liberating story that did not delve into stereotypes or reduce the woman to her disability.\n\n7. Sooni Taraporevala – Tabu\n\nSooni Taraporevala has written numerous screenplays for Mira Nair. But if we have to choose one movie from her outstanding body of work, it has to be The Namesake. The movie has a stellar cast but you just cannot take your eyes off Tabu who lends a certain softness to her character. The actor makes you feel the pains and the struggles. Their collaboration has given us a character that we will always remember.\n\nThese writers and actors form just the tip of the iceberg. Many other duos are changing how women are portrayed in movies, slowly but surely."
