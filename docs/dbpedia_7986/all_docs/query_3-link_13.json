        "text": "Among the many catfights in Bollywood, Kareena Kapoor and Bipasha Basu's animosity tops the list. It all started with Bipasha's debut film, Ajnabee (2001), which also featured Kareena Kapoor Khan. If rumours are to be believed, the two leading ladies had a major tiff over their costumes, even before the film's release. The situation got worse when Bebo's designer helped Bipasha without the former's consent. This led to an ugly war of words, with Bebo even slapping Bipasha.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCostume designer, Dolly Ahluwalia makes shocking revelations\n\nFast forward to today, Bipasha Basu and Kareena Kapoor have buried the hatchet and are cordial now. However, in an interview with The Punjabi Link, actress-turned-costume designer, Dolly Ahluwalia denied all such rumours about the actresses throwing tantrums. For the unversed, Dolly has worked in several movies and wowed audiences with her performances in Vicky Donor and Sardar Udham Singh. Meanwhile, she also showcased her creativity as a costume designer in hit films like Band Baaja Baaraat and Omkara.\n\nYou May Also Like: Tabu Gives Her Take On Gender Pay Gap In Indian Film Industry, 'Why Don't You Ask The Male Actor...'\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nDolly Ahluwalia refutes rumours about Bipasha and Kareena\n\nIn the interview, Dolly Ahluwalia reflected on her experience working with Kareena Kapoor and described the latter as magical. She shared that when she visited Kareena's home for a costume fitting, she realised the latter's true warmth and kindness, dispelling any rumours she had heard. Dolly also mentioned that when she got the opportunity to work with Bipasha Basu, she found her genuine and confirmed that the latter was far from being a tantrum-thrower.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBipasha Basu denied having issues with Kareena Kapoor on Ajnabee's sets\n\nComing back to Kareena and Bipasha's catfight, the latter had once claimed that she did not want to ever work with Bebo again. In an interview with Filmfare in 2001, Bipasha addressed her rivalry with Kareena and mentioned that the latter had some issues with the designer which created chaos on the sets. Adding that she had nothing to do in the matter, Bipasha said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"I think this is a case of making a mountain out of a molehill. There were never any problems with me. She had some problems with the designer. I don't know why I was pulled in. It was quite childish.\"\n\nAlso Read: Sunidhi Chauhan Says, Nowadays Auto-Tune Is Used Everywhere 'It Makes All Voices Sound Same..'\n\nadvertisement.\n\nWhen Kareena Kapoor talked about her catfight with Bipasha Basu\n\nLater, Kareena Kapoor told her side of the story and left no stone unturned to slam Bipasha. In an interview with Filmfare in 2002, she said that Bipasha had no confidence in her own talent. She further mentioned how the Jism actress spoke about her in about three pages out of the four-page interview, instead of talking about her own work. Kareena took a nasty dig at Bipasha and said that the latter's only claim to fame is that she fought with her during Ajnabee over costume designer, Vikram Phadnis. However, Bebo denied having called Bipasha uncharitable names and labelled it as a figment of her imagination.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat are your views on Dolly Ahluwalia's statement about Kareena and Bipasha?\n\nNext Read: Rekha Tightly Embraces Janhvi Kapoor At 'Ulajh's Premiere, Shows Motherly Instincts By Kissing Her\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
