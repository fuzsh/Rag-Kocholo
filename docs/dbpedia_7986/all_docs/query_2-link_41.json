        "text": "I have not been to film school. I have not done film studies. I just watch a lot of films. And I can say that now because that is something I have in common with Juhi Chaturvedi i.e. the person who, obviously inadvertently, taught me to understand the contribution of a writer in a film during an era when the spotlight was usually on the star. How? Well, by writing impeccable films like Vicky Donor, Madras Cafe (dialogue), Piku, and October.\n\nNow, her latest collab with Shoojit Sircar, Gulabo Sitabo, is on the way to Amazon Prime Video and along with it came an opportunity to virtually sit down with her and deconstruct her professional trajectory till now. And I passed on it. I am just kidding. I obviously took it and here are the results:\n\nHow was Gulabo Sitabo born?\n\n\"This was in fact way before October. I and Shoojit were talking about people, life, and gentle relationships. And somewhere out of this conversation, the thought came about regular people with the most basic lifestyle and, you know, how we sometimes very easily judge them and write them off. Still, there’s always something that leads them to who they are. So, we were talking about all that and that’s how this idea came. Thing is having an idea and having a film are two different things. But he [Shoojit] could see what I was saying and he knew this world that I was talking about, whether it is Delhi, Chandni Chowk, or Lucknow, that we arrived at later, but these kinds of people are universal. They are everywhere. When you see the film, you’ll realise what the film actually is. And that somehow connected with him and we could see a film there and then we went forth with the decision of who’ll be Mirza and he was very sure that it has to be Mr. Bachchan. And before we shared it with Mr. Bachchan, we were clear that we were going to set it in Lucknow. So, that helped Mr. Bachchan imagine, even though at that time the script was not with him, the basic idea, editing, caricature, features, etc. He comes from Allahabad, so he knew that he could pull it off and add his own brilliance to it. And then, of course, the writing started, then deciding who Bankey is going to be and I think again it was Shoojit who suggested having Ayushmann.\"\n\nYou and Shoojit have had the longest and one of the most successful professional relationships. So, between Vicky Donor and Gulabo Sitabo, how has your script-writing for his movies changed? Has it become more detailed or simpler?\n\n\"I would say it hasn’t become easy. In fact, it has become difficult [laughs]. Because you’re not just writing as a newbie that okay it’s my first film, I can write whatever and get written off or appreciated. No profit, no loss kind of a thing. But with every film, we’ve tried to go towards a certain vision and so far, touch wood, we’ve been able to. The task has been always to not let all this affect that it’s our fourth film or fifth film or sixth film. The effort that you make without the pressure of writing because there is a certain pressure but the difficult task is to imagine as if there is no pressure and to always keep the simplistic portions of our vision there. It is always about that. Everything else is secondary. If I am writing towards that, then I call him up like a hundred times in a day. And also what definitely has happened that there are things that if there are things that are not from his experiences or his world, like for example in this film [it is] Lucknow, he knows that if I’ve written it, there is a reason for it. So, it’s not an immediate strike off the line just because he didn’t understand it will be worth it. Those kinds of things have matured over this period of time and he has worked with other writers as well and he is very organised, he’s extremely disciplined, extremely grounded. So [seeing that], you start working much harder on your working style because you’re not working with someone who’s like ‘anything written is fine’. He will go through each and every word and unless the script is not right, he won’t take it to the actors also. So, there is a clear method of working and with every film, I have just tried to align myself to that and it has definitely helped me in my writing process.\"\n\nI recently binge-watched all the movies that you’ve done with Shoojit and I have noticed that your dialogue-writing is impeccable although the kind of interactions in Madras Cafe or Piku or October or Gulabo Sitabo is vastly different? How do you ensure that the interactions are so organic?\n\n\"I spend enough time with the characters. Knowing them, their personalities, how they speak, are they educated or uneducated, what part of the society they belong to, cultural influences, family influences, how many siblings, you know. So, I wish I can find out in absolute depth that what is this man or woman and then the conversations will automatically show red flags if I have overwritten or something that this person cannot speak because he doesn’t know that world, so how can he speak about it? So, it is not for the sake of writing dialogue. I think it’s about being absolutely true to who Mirza or Bankey or Shiwli or Dan is.\"\n\nWhat are some of your major influences in terms of screenwriting?\n\n\"Definitely [Satyajit] Ray’s films. I have not been to a film school. I did not begin to become a writer. I have been to art school. So, my upbringing was not to become a writer. It was always about art. But the thing is that people realised my little observations were great, and that helps. But more than that if I could say, specific films if I have to talk about, [then] Ray’s films. I will be very honest, there was very limited viewing. I wasn’t exposed to too much. Whatever I was exposed to during my growing years was quite fine and beautifully filtered by my parents. So, maybe that’s also a reason why I can only imagine the truth in a more... (here’s where I butt in to say ‘unfiltered way?’ to which Juhi kinda sorta agrees). The thing is that we were always conditioned to understand rather than judge. That is one big influence that has helped which came from the family. That, you know, just don’t pass a comment and judge people. Just try to look beyond. What if you’re in that situation? So, these kinds of things are big influences i.e the conversations that happen along the way. I won’t say, growing up, I traveled to a lot of places. Within India, wherever my parents took me, I would definitely take up. So, those are influences. Lucknow itself is like a… I can’t even tell you what kind of characters [laughs] are in this place. So, each of those things is unique in its own way, and all that were influences. And if you’re talking about films, the majority of my learning or schooling is from Ray’s films.\"\n\nBetween Vicky Donor and Gulabo Sitabo, do you think people have started to recognise the work of a writer more than ever before?\n\n\"I’ll tell you what, it is very simple. If the directors and the actors start talking about the writers, at least a little familiarity happens. But if you ask me naturally, normal, regular moviegoers, the first thought that comes to their mind is who has written that film, that is not really the thing from anyone. And it is fair enough because it is a director’s medium, right? What you see on-screen is the actor. If you like it, then you make the effort ki accha ye likha kisne hai [who has written the film]? When you pick up a book by the name of the author. The first question that arises is ‘who is the author?’, but in cinema that’s not the case. It doesn’t mean that the writer is any less. It’s just that the first thing they see is the people on the screen performing. Second is the director. And then if you like all of that, then you say ‘Oh! Okay, who wrote it?’. That’s fine I think. Is it happening more? I think so because there is decent content [coming out of] cinema right now and that’s why people are getting exposed to writers like Varun [Grover[ for example. He is very expressive, out there on social media. He speaks his mind. And I don’t think people follow him [just] because of the film he has written. It’s also because he’s a good thinker. So, as long as we’re able to express ourselves, whether it is through cinema, whether it is through songs or our general thoughts, people at some point in time will notice your consistency. And it’s okay even if we don’t get recognised [laugh]. But again the idea is not that. That’s not the purpose. It [the movie] is a byproduct. The starting point is not that [i.e. recognising the writing]. The starting point is am I writing or not.\"\n\nSegueing from Varun Grover and social media, I think we can all agree that the current socio-cultural-political climate is quite hot right now. So, how do you maintain your sanity while writing? Or do you let it affect you and then put it into your writing in some way?\n\n\"It’s important to stay aware. I am aware of what’s happening across the world. How much of that will start creeping into my writing depends on the subject that I am writing about. Something might be a hot topic somewhere, a burning issue somewhere. But does it come as a burning issue in my film or does it come as a resolution in film, I don’t know.\"\n\nWhat are some movies off the top of your head that you’d want to suggest to people if they want to learn more about screenwriting/scriptwriting?\n\n\"Bicycle Thieves. And just for screenwriting. I think it’s a masterclass in being a person. It’s a good, humane learning experience. It is beyond anything that I’ve seen written. Of course, Ray’s work. Everything (I vehemently agree to this and while Juhi is thinking I over smartly tell her that she can recommend her work as well). My work is hardly anything. But, ya, that I can say is always up to the people [laughs]. Who’s the director for Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyu Ata Hai? (At this point, I am ferociously looking through IMDb so that Juhi doesn’t get a whiff of my lack of film knowledge and sheepishly utter the name ‘Syeed Akhtar Mirza'). Yes, yes, yes, yes! The film happens in Bombay. Most of his films were based in Bombay. Within that how beautifully he has found the stories that are very different and they just reach your soul and affect you so deeply when you watch his work.\"\n\nOn that note, I parted with Juhi and fanboyed a little (Narrator: He actually fanboyed a lot) to let her know how much I love her work, to which she reacted with a laugh and hoped that I meant it. I assured her that I did because her work is a masterclass in writing and scripting conversations that flow well. And, to be very honest I cannot wait to witness more of her craft in Gulabo Sitabo on June 19 on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nSEE ALSO: Exclusive - Betaal's Viineet Kumar, Aahana Kumra, Manjiri Pupala Talk About Horror, Lockdown And More"
