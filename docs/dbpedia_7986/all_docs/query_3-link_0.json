The concept is set against the background of sperm donation and infertility within a Bengali-Punjabi household. Both Ayushmann and Yami made their film debut through this film.\n\nVicky Donor was released on 20 April 2012 at around 750 screens in India.[12] The film opened to universal critical acclaim and performed strongly at the box office.[13][14][15] It became a commercial success grossing ₹66.32 crore worldwide, against a budget of ₹10 crore.[16]\n\nAt the 60th National Film Awards, Vicky Donor won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. At the 58th Filmfare Awards, it received 8 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Sircar), Best Supporting Actress (Ahluwalia) and Best Female Debut (Gautam), and won 4 awards, including Best Supporting Actor (Kapoor) and Best Male Debut (Khurrana).\n\nThe film was remade in Telugu as Naruda Donoruda (2016) and in Tamil as Dharala Prabhu (2020).[17][18]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Baldev Chaddha is a fertility expert who runs a clinic and a sperm bank in Daryaganj, Delhi that guarantees high-quality sperm for couples. He has more failed cases than successes. He is on the lookout for a healthy and high-performing donor.\n\nVikram \"Vicky\" Arora hails from an Arora Punjabi family and is the only son of his widowed mother Dolly, who runs a small beauty parlour in Lajpat Nagar. They live with Vicky's grandmother. Vicky is a vagabond who provides no financial support to the household and starts searching for a job that will provide them with a better lifestyle.\n\nChaddha meets Vicky and likes his happy-go-lucky nature. He believes Vicky is the donor he has been looking for. He stalks him and eventually, painstakingly convinces him to become a sperm donor. Though Vicky is hesitant at first, he accepts after being offered a high salary. Chaddha gets Vicky's semen sample tested from a lab and is delighted to hear that it was sample with very high sperm count. Chaddha decides to use it for his patients and starts getting high success rates. Vicky hides his career after facing ridicule from his friends, but starts spending wildly, renovating his house and the parlour. Chaddha too earns handsomely in this business.\n\nVicky meets an ambitious accountant Ashima Roy at the bank and they fall in love after going out a number of times. They soon wish to get married, but as a divorced Bengali bank employee wanting to marry a carefree man from a loud Punjabi family, both face backlash from their families. However, they eventually manage to get everyone's approval. Vicky continues to hide his occupation, and stops donating sperm after getting married, ignoring Chaddha who continues to chase Vicky as he is his most successful donor.\n\nIn an ironic turn of events, the couple discovers that Ashima is infertile. Both of them get tested, but Vicky does not take the fertility test and is forced to admit to being a sperm donor. Taken aback by her husband's strange career, Ashima leaves for her paternal home. Vicky is heartbroken and cuts all ties with Chaddha.\n\nThe parlour is soon raided by income tax officers due to their frivolous renovations. Vicky is arrested on suspicion of handling black money but is bailed out by Dr. Chaddha, who reveals his occupation to his family members. Vicky's mother is disgusted and also apologises to Ashima. Vicky's grandmother and Ashima's father make them understand how Vicky's deed has helped many families bear children and ask them to have a progressive take on this.\n\nChaddha's assistant finds out list of couples to whom Vicky has donated his sperms. Chaddha calls Vicky and Ashima to an event he has hosted where all families that Vicky helped bear children are present, and helps Ashima see how his step helped them find happiness. He then tells them that one child is absent. This little girl has lost her parents in an accident. Her grandparents failed to contact Chaddha's clinic and had to send her to orphanage. Dr. Chaddha suggest the couple adopt little girl, Diya. Ashima begins to see reason and understands. The couple reunites, adopts the little girl, and Vicky continues to occasionally donate sperm for Chaddha's clinic.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nThemes and development\n\n[edit]\n\nVicky Donor deals with sperm donation and infertility.[24] When questioned about the risky subject matter, Abraham responded, \"Basically, Vicky Donor is a romantic comedy. But the concept is set against the background of sperm donation.\" Abraham hoped that the film could shed light on a serious issue still considered \"taboo\" in Indian society.\n\nSircar said, \"I want to take a light-hearted look at the taboo attached to infertility and artificial insemination.\" Before filming began, Sircar researched the plot themes for three years.[25] Juhi Chaturvedi, creative director at advertising agency Bates, who wrote the screenplay based on her own idea, had stayed in Lajpat Nagar as a student at College of Arts, Delhi. As the script went through several drafts, she met a couple who run a noted fertility clinic in Mumbai.[26][27]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite the usual trend, Abraham did not take up the leading role in the film: \"It was a conscious decision to not act in my first production because I believe producing a film is about creating quality content that I believe in.\"[28] Director Sircar suggested Khurrana, a video jockey and television host, for the role of Vicky; he was considered because he was popular among the youth. He \"can read and write Punjabi too.\"[25][29] Khurrana turned down three film projects to play the lead in Vicky Donor. To prepare for the role, he met medical experts and donors to understand sperm donation; a major medical consultant specializing in the field was later inducted as a medical adviser for the film. Additionally, Khurrana studied acting and attended workshops with N.K. Sharma in Delhi.[25] It was later reported that Abraham would perform an \"item number.\"[30] Commenting on his performance, Abraham said \"I am glad I cast Ayushmann in the lead. He's a complete natural, has all the trappings of a fine actor and has delivered a super performance. It doesn't seem like Vicky Donor is his first film.\" It was reported that the production crew would feature \"the best technicians from Los Angeles\" and acclaimed action choreographer J J Perry. Incidentally, Ayushmann who plays the lead role, successfully performed a task on the reality show MTV Roadies: Season 2, which was sperm donation.[28][31]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nVicky DonorSoundtrack album by\n\nAbhishek-Akshay, Bann, Rochak Kohli and Ayushmann Khurrana\n\nReleased29 February 2012 ( )GenreFeature film soundtrackLength35:13LabelEros MusicProducerJohn AbrahamSingles from Vicky Donor\n\nReleased: 1 February 2012\n\nThe soundtrack album features eight tracks which were composed by Abhishek-Akshay, Bann, Rochak Kohli and Ayushmann Khurrana.

Kudos to John Abraham for his brave maiden production. Thankfully, this sperm hits bullseye.\"[35] Mathures Paul of The Statesman gave the film 3.5/5 and wrote, \"Vicky Donor is an admirable movie that is at once simple, emotional, daring and in your face.\"[36]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film had an opening at the box office worldwide and collected ₹18.8 million (US$230,000) on its first day in India.[37] Vicky Donor showed good growth on Saturday as all India collections jumped around 35%–40%; it collected around ₹26.0 million (US$310,000) nett taking its two-day business to ₹45.0 million (US$540,000) nett.[38] The film got tough competition from Housefull 2 in its first week of theatrical run in India.[39] Vicky Donor is the 3rd small-budget film of 2012 after Paan Singh Tomar and Kahaani to receive such an acceptance by critics, multiplex goers and urban audience.
