The r estock of\n\nour catalog is progr essing slowly , but it is\n\ncontinuing. W e are up to the T empest kits,\n\nwhich could see stocked shelves thr ough\n\nMay , and in June, ther e should be a reissue\n\nof the T empest Mk.V Series I kit. The MiG\n\n-\n\n-21s in 1:48th are beginning their pr oduction\n\nrun, and May sho uld also see the initiation\n\nof the Spitfire Mk.IXs, along with their as\n\n-\n\nsociated versions, the Mk. VIII and Mk. X VI.\n\nIn June, w e may be able to f ocus some\n\nattention on the Hellcats, and on the Fw 190D\n\nthrough the summer months. By then, w e’ll\n\nbe into some of the 1:72nd scale items as\n\nwell. P roduction of ne w molds is going well,\n\ntoo, and the Camel mo ulds are essentia\n\n-\n\nlly complete. The T rener moulds hav e their\n\nelectrodes, and parts are being milled into\n\nthe blocks now . W e ar e putting together the\n\nmanuscript for the video advert f or the T r e\n\n-\n\nner kits, which I am getting a kick out of , and\n\nI trust you will enjo y the end result. But the\n\nfilming itself requires a fairly large number\n\nof T reners, and b y that, I mean the genui\n\n-\n\nne articles, not models. W e make the latter\n\nourselves, no w orries. W e ar e confident that\n\nwe will be able to present the T rener kit at\n\nthis year’ s E-da y as a new r elease, and the\n\nquestion isn’ t whether or not this will be po\n\n-\n\nssible. The bigger question is whether or not\n\nthis dumb pandemic can be beaten, and if it\n\nwill bring about the return of the modeling\n\nev ents that we are familiar with as being\n\nnormal. I personally believ e that the answ er\n\nis yes, and that we will be able to meet at\n\nLysa nad Labem, and that it will be the first\n\nE-day to be put on in accor dance with the\n\nvision based on the new f ormat inclusive\n\nof the Czech Model Masters contest. I also\n\nbeliev e that we will be at Las V egas for the\n\nIPMS Nationals in the United States and at\n\nT elford in Nov ember .\n\nKI TS\n\nMay is unique in that we ha ve no ne w Limited\n\nEdition kit for release in this month. W e were\n\nto have p ut out the 1:72nd scale Adlerangriff\n\nkit with different Special Hobb y Bf 109Es. But,\n\nas is clear , it is not part of May’ s release pr o\n\n-\n\ngram. The problem is rooted in the under es-\n\ntimation by Special Hobb y of the demand f or\n\nthe kit, and the first two press c ycles of the\n\nkit did not yield enough plastic to co ver or\n\n-\n\nders. So we left our or der for these kits to S H\n\nfor their needs, and we p ushed the release\n\ndate of ours to July . But that July order is\n\nOU RS! W e won’ t be leaving that one to them.\n\nConversely , we mo ved the r elease of the\n\n1:48th scale Fw 190F-8 from July to May , and\n\nit’ s the P rofiP A C K version. The Focke W ulf\n\nis bound to make a lot of people happ y , but\n\nI get that it does nothing for the 1:72nd types\n\namong you. The Fw 190 F-8 stems from the\n\nFw 190 A-8, b ut has a new wing and two spru-\n\nes of weapons for attacking gr ound tar gets.\n\nThe sprues with the weapons are the same as\n\nthose that appeared in the first generation of\n\nthe Fw 190F-8 that we r eleased some years\n\nback. There are se ven markings options in\n\nthe kit, and they intentionally co ver the ma\n\n-\n\njority of the spectrum of Luftwaffe units that\n\nflew the type . The theme of the gro und attack\n\nFw 190F-8s is further taken up in this\n\nnewsletter via an article b y Andre w Arth y .\n\nIn the past sev eral months, there was quite\n\na bit of interest in the P anzerschreck w ea\n\n-\n\npons, which were carried b y the Fw 190F-\n\n8. The question has also been raised as to\n\nwhether we wo uld release these as Brassin\n\nitems, and the answer to that question is\n\n‘y es’. But I must point o ut that this somewhat\n\niconic piece of equipment suffers fr om a lack\n\nof good refer ence material. So , we ask the\n\nharsher critics out there to be a little bit f or\n\n-\n\ngiving. W e are doing what w e can.\n\nAnother May P rofiP A CK is the Mustang Mk.IV,\n\nthe British version of the P-51 D, as well as\n\nthe P-51K, which was known in the RAF as\n\nthe Mustang Mk.IVa. In the P rofiP A C K kit, the\n\nMk.IVa outnumbers the Mk.IV in a ratio of 2:1,\n\nwith there being a total of f our K’ s. I alwa\n\n-\n\nys tended to view the British v ersions of the\n\nMustang as somewhat boring, b ut, of cour\n\n-\n\nse, in r esearching the marking options, I, as\n\nmany bef ore me , have done an about face .\n\nY ou wil l probably come to the same conclusi\n\n-\n\non yourselv es. The options are quite o utstan-\n\nding, as are the individual stories connected\n\nwith them. The boxart again depicts an actu\n\n-\n\nal ev ent. In this case, it concerns Operation\n\nOmelette, an operation that f ocused on the li\n\n-\n\nberation of the Channel Islands, the only part\n\nof the United Kingdom to be occupied b y Nazi\n\nGermany . Y ou can r ead more on this opera\n\n-\n\ntion in the accompanying article b y Richar d\n\nPlos in this newsletter . T o go along with the\n\nMustang Mk.IV , we will also be releasing\n\na BFC item, dedicated to one of the most de-\n\npicted of the British Mustangs, flown b y F/Lt.\n\nA. S . Doley , named ‘Dooleybir d’.\n\nAnd that’ s not all for the P r ofiP A CK r e\n\n-\n\nleases this month. The other is the Bf 109G-\n\n2. Actually , this one is a sort of a ‘re-issue’\n\nand is largely the same as the Bf 109G-2\n\nPr ofiP A CK kit carrying the Catalog Num\n\n-\n\nber 82116. It has a new bo xart, because the\n\noriginal one was…how to p ut it?....nothing to\n\nwrite home about. It also diff ers in one of\n\nthe marking options pro vided, because the\n\none that it replaces r equired the inclusion\n\nof the plastic sprue containing a G-4 wing.\n\nAt the moment, plastic parts are at a pr e-\n\nmium for us, and so we r eally need to go\n\nout of our wa y to use them to optimal eff ect,\n\naccounting for the change in the marking op\n\n-\n\ntions, taking advantage of the elimination of\n\nthe need for that sprue . The last of the f our\n\nMay P rofiP A CK releases is a clean reissue .\n\nIt is the MiG-21MF Fighter Bomber in 1:72nd\n\nscale. The bo xart depicts Vietnamese figh\n\n-\n\nter ace and future cosmonaut Pham T uan\n\ndowning a B-52. Back in the da y , this pictu\n\n-\n\nre caused a lot of commotion from acr oss\n\nthe pond and I am hopeful that we won ’ t see\n\na repeat of that this time aro und. The last\n\nof the five May mode kit releases is the Al\n\n-\n\nbatros D . V in a 1:72nd scale W eekend Editi-\n\non boxing. This kit’ s a classic for which we\n\nhave chosen f our attractiv e marking options,\n\nwhich has now become the norm f or this line.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\neduard\n\n4\n\nINFO Eduard - May 2021\n\nPage 5\n\nA C CES SO RIES - BRA SSIN\n\nConceptually , the Löök and Space sets are\n\nsimilar . Both utilize progressive 3D techno-\n\nlogies in combination with pre-painted pho-\n\ntoetched brass. It can almost be said that\n\nthese two lines are in dir ect competition with\n\neach other . I would say that, thanks to being\n\na further reaching product, the Space con-\n\ncept comes out on top in terms of bang f or\n\nthe buck, and that goes f or both the 3D aspect\n\nas well as the photoetched brass aspect of\n\nthe item. For now , it comes out about e ven,\n\nbut we shall see the direction each takes, as\n\ndemand by c ustomers dev elops. These are\n\nstill both new items. One thing that these\n\nsets are managing to do already is to test\n\nour printing ability to the max. Sales of pre\n\n-\n\n-painted photoetched has risen markedly\n\nov er the past year , and since it’ s all printed\n\non the same machine, w e will be in need of\n\nacquiring another one through the summer .\n\nIt will be a good investment, as the ne w\n\nmachine will be more modern than the two\n\ncurrently in use , so we sho uld see an impro\n\n-\n\nvement in the quality of the product as w ell.\n\nAs a side note, the colo ur printers are in the\n\nphotoetched department, and the production\n\nof the Space sets is their jurisdiction, while\n\nthe Löök sets fall to the Brassin department.\n\nThis could precipitate minor diff erences in\n\nsets designed for the same kit, stemming\n\nfrom each department’ s application of the 3D\n\naspects to a given set. For Ma y , we have f our\n\nnew Löök sets coming o ut, all in 1:48th scale\n\n(MiG-15, MiG- 15bis, P-39Q and the Mustang\n\nMk.IV) and two new LööKpl us sets (MiG-21PF\n\nand MiG-21PFM. There are thr ee new Space\n\nsets, cov ering the MiG-15bis, Fw 190F-8 and\n\nthe Mustang Mk.IV , again, all in 48th. Classic\n\nBrassin sets are dominated b y a cockpit set\n\nfor the Spitfire Mk.II (Eduard, 1:48th). For the\n\nMiG-15 from Br onco, ther e are three smaller\n\nsets cov ering wheels and cannon barrels.\n\nIt should be noted that these are divided\n\ninto two sets, one for the MiG-15 and the\n\nother for the bis subtype . These are also in\n\n-\n\nteresting in that the y are 3D prints, and not\n\ncast resin. This is a progr ession that will\n\nbegin to dominate our production thr ough\n\nthe second half of the year . I expect that\n\nabout this time ne xt year , I will be talking\n\nabout sets that are pr edominantly printed,\n\nnot cast. The remaining six ne w sets this\n\nmonth centre aro und weapons sets in all\n\nthe three main scales. There is al so one new\n\nBigSin, for the Spitfire Mk.IIa.\n\nA C CES SO RIES\n\n–\n\nPHOTOETCHED AND MA SKS\n\nMay’ s photoetched items and maks ar e pro\n\n-\n\nbably best described as typical. Also typical is\n\nits wide range of subject matter and its poten\n\n-\n\ntial to generate a lot of interest. For example ,\n\nthe cov erage of the 1:72nd scale set for the\n\nAr 234 from Dragon, curr ently being sold b y\n\nthe P olish firm HOBBY 20 00 , or the set for the\n\nBf 109E-3 from Special Hobb y , which will\n\nalso soon be useable on our o wn Edu\n\n-\n\nard boxing. Our off ering will, of course ,\n\ninclude a plethora of fundamental pho\n\n-\n\ntoetched brass, so the dev elopment of\n\nan accessory kit for it will be a bit mor e\n\ncomplicated. HOBBY 20 00 is r eboxing\n\na large number of Asian produced kits, much\n\nto the delight of modelers, and so we deci\n\n-\n\nded to go into producing some sets f or their\n\nreleases. In May , besides the afor ementi\n\n-\n\noned Ar 234, this includes the 1:48th scale\n\nMiG-15 and MiG- 15bis from Bronco , being\n\nbox ed simultaneously b y the P olish firm. W e\n\nalso hav e masks for the MiGs to go with the\n\nphotoetched. The MiG-15bis items include\n\nmasks, both in the classic form and also as\n\nthe inside/outside TFace types. Keeping with\n\n1:48th scale, both types of mask sets ar e\n\nalso being offer ed for the Harrier GR.1 and\n\nthe GR.3 from Kinetic , the MV-22 from Hobb y\n\nBoss and our o wn Fw 190F-8. For all of these\n\nnoted models, the list of new items al so\n\nincludes photoetched, and for the Fw 190 F-8\n\nand the MiG-15 this does not lea ve out l an\n\n-\n\nding flaps. For the Arma Hobb y PZL.11c w e\n\nhave just the cl assic type of mask, same\n\ngoing for the R oden P T-13 Kaydet in 1:32nd\n\nscale, b ut both types are being r eleased for\n\nthe T rumpeter P-40 M in the same scale . This\n\nlast type has a total of six ne w photoetched\n\nsets being released for it, incl uding a set of\n\npre-painted steel seat belts and two mask\n\nsets. In the ZO OM line , the steel belts are\n\navailable no w for all of the abo ve noted kits\n\nin 1:48th and 1:32nd scale, e xcept f or the Fw\n\n190F-8. Ho we ver , the set containing generic\n\nLuftwaffe seat belts (Catalog Number FE812)\n\ncov ers those. The only set being r eleased\n\nthat is not for an aircraft is 36462, T yphoon\n\nK for the 1:35th Z v ezda kit. This month leaves\n\nout an y new ship sets or Big Eds.\n\nDEC AL S\n\nThere are f our ne w decal sets being released\n\nin May , three of which are stencil data items.\n\nThey ar e for the T ornado GR.4 (Re vell), the\n\nMiG-15 (Bronco) and the MiG-23MF/ML\n\n(T rumpeter). The fo urth set is designed f or the\n\nEduard Mustang. It offers decal s for the P-\n\n-51D from the 15th AF , US AAF , which were\n\nMustangs without the fin fillet operating\n\nin Italy . One of the articles in this issue\n\nof the newsletter deal s with the appli\n\n-\n\ncation of our decals and describes the\n\noft requested information on just how to\n\npeel awa y the carrier film, and describes\n\nif and how necessary it is to actually go\n\nthrough this pr ocess to achiev e optimum\n\nperformance o ut of them.

Things had been relatively quiet on the so uthern sector of the\n\nfront for se veral months, but the Germans kne w that the situation\n\nin Romania w ould soon change . The Luftwaffe headquarters in that\n\nsector was Luftflotte 4, under Generaloberst Otto Deßloch\n\n1)\n\n, and\n\nground-attack units w ere a primary component of Deßloch ’ s com-\n\nmand. Schlachtgeschwader 2 and Schl achtgeschwader 10 had been\n\nvital units for Luftflotte 4 thro ughout 19 44, and that would remain the\n\ncase until the end of the war . By August 1944, most components of\n\nthose two Schlachtgesch wader were equipped with the Focke- W ulf\n\n190 F-8, the highly capable fighter -bomber version of Kurt T ank’ s fa-\n\nmous W ürger .\n\nI./ SG 2 was relativ ely late in receiving the Focke- W ulf 190 : it gav e up\n\nits Ju 87s and took on its first Fw 190 F-8s at Görgényor oszfalu (mo-\n\ndern Solo văstru, R omania) in July 19 44. The situation in the Luftflotte\n\n4 sector was not so critical in July and the first three weeks of August,\n\nso conversion training co uld proceed peacefully f or Hptm. Kurt Lau ’ s\n\nunit, with just the usual training mishaps occurring.\n\nWhen I./ SG 2 returned to action with its ne w aircraft, in mid-August\n\n19 44, Luftflotte 4 was about to face the biggest challenge of its e xi-\n\nstence, as German y’ s R omanian allies switched their allegiance , and\n\nthe Soviets began a rapid advance thr ough R omania towar ds Hunga-\n\nrian territory . I./ SG 2 fle w its ne w Fw 190 F-8s into action and suffe-\n\nred some losses after the R ed Army’ s Iasi-Kishinev offensive began\n\non 20 August 19 44. In the wake of that off ensive , other Fw 190 F-8\n\nequipped Gruppen were transf erred to R omania, Hungary and Y ugo-\n\nslavia, including the Gesch waderstab , I., II. and III./ SG 10 , plus the Ju\n\n87s of III./ SG 2. During late- August, September , and October 1944, the\n\nRed Arm y dro ve the Axis f orces of Heeresgruppe Süd o ut of R oma-\n\nnia and across the Carpathian Mountains, penetrated Bulgaria, and\n\nadvanced onto the plains of eastern Hungary . The battle for Budapest\n\nitself would become fierce in late-October 19 44, and the Fw 190 F-8s\n\nof Luftflotte 4 would be hea vily inv olved.\n\nBattling for Budapest\n\nThe primary objective for the R ed Arm y was the Hungarian capital,\n\nand in October and Nov ember 19 44, the So viet 2. and 3. Ukrainian\n\nFronts did their utmost with tired and w eakened forces to captur e\n\nthe city . On 16 October , Hungarian R egent Miklós Horthy was arr es-\n\nted, and a hard-line right-wing party took o ver , ensuring Hunga-\n\nry would hel p the Germans resist the So viet advance. While those\n\nhigh-lev el actions were taking place , I. Fliegerkorps – a subordinate\n\ncommand of Luftflotte 4 – was operating on a daily basis against the\n\nSoviet advance ar ound Debrecen, to the east of the Hungarian capital.\n\nAmongst the active I. Fliegerkorps units equipped with the Fw 190 F-8\n\nwere I./SG 2, the Geschwaderstab , I. and III./ SG 10 , and 5./SG 77 with\n\nits Panzerschr eck-equipped Fw 190 F-8s based at Sárospatak, to the\n\nnorth of Debrecen.\n\n2)\n\nThe Panzerschr eck rocket was a ne w and very eff ective airborne an-\n\nti-tank weapon, based on the infantry weapon of the same name , and\n\n5./ SG 77 had been trained in its usage at the Luftwaffe e valuation\n\nand testing airfield at Udetfeld (modern Zendek, P oland) in Septem-\n\nber . The 1. Staffel of SG 10 undertook fr ontline conversion to P anzer-\n\nschreck Fw 190 F-8s in Hungary in early No vember , but this was not\n\nconsidered very eff ective in comparison, as a German wartime report\n\nnoted:\n\n“In October/Nov ember 19 44, an attempt was made b y Luftflotte 4 to\n\nequip and deploy Schlachtfliegerstaff eln with P anzerschreck witho ut\n\nspecial training. T raining was to take place in the field. The success of\n\nthe Staffeln was e xtraordinarily lo w , with high fuel and ammunition\n\nconsumption, although the y were old, pr ov en Fw 190 Schlachtstaffel n.\n\nThe reason was the lo w marksmanship of the pilots.”\n\nThe Panzerschr eck-equipped Fw 190 F-8 Staffel n of Luftflotte 4\n\nwould operate on man y days during October 19 44, including sixteen\n\nThe Focke-Wulf 190 F-8wasa vitalGerman weapon on the Eastern Front in the final year of the Second W orld W ar , and nowhere was this more evident than during the fighting in Hungary in late-19 44 and early 19 45. Under German air force command Luftflotte 4, unitssuch asSchlachtgeschwader 10 and Hans-Ulrich R udel’ s Schlachtgeschwader 2\n\nflew tho usands of sorties against the R ed Arm y , trying to hold back the Soviet tide . Their eff orts wer e inevitabl y to no\n\navail, b ut the men flying the Fw 190 F-8 perf ormed valiantly against great odds. Not only did they face str ong So viet\n\naerial opposition and gro und fire; the y also had to fly and fight in horrendo us winter weather conditions.\n\nThe Focke- W ulf 190 F-8\n\nwith Luftflotte 4, 19 44-19 45\n\nAndre w Arth y\n\neduard\n\n6\n\nINFO Eduard - May 2021\n\nPage 7\n\nHISTORY\n\nsorties on the 21st, and two on the 2 4th.\n\nMeanwhile , the war went on, and Debrecen f ell to the So viets on 20\n\nOctober , although a German army counterattack north of the city\n\nconcluding on 2 6 October enjoy ed some success, with good support\n\nfrom Fw 190 Schlachtflugze uge of I. Fliegerkorps (180 sorties were\n\nflown on 21 October , and 162 on 2 6 October). One German pilot of S G\n\n10 recalled of this period:\n\n“W e fle w ex clusively missions in support of the arm y , which was under\n\nheavy pressur e from the So viets. … W e had successes without ma\n\n-\n\njor losses, and that brought a better mood amongst airmen as well\n\nas ground personnel.

Schlachtstaff el (also\n\nknown b y its Hungarian designation of 102/ 1. vadászbombázó század)\n\nreceived sixteen Fw 190 F-8s and a single G-8 at Bör gönd in late\n\nOctober 19 44. The Staffel w ould commence operations from ther e\n\nin mid-Nov ember , and proved to be just as eff ective as the German\n\nground-attack units in coming months.\n\nBad weather became a featur e of the Hungarian air war in\n\nmid-Nov ember , and several da ys saw limited Luftwaff e operati-\n\nons. For example , an SG 2 pilot described 15 Nov ember thus: “On 15\n\nNov ember the weather was bad again, very f oggy and clo udy .” This\n\nwould become a familiar situation in coming months. The w eather\n\ndid not stop Malinovsk y’ s troops, and on 16 No vember the y reached\n\nthe key point of Hatvan, east-north-east of Budapest: the thr eat to\n\nthe city was gro wing. Recognising the serio usness of the situation,\n\nand with decent weather , Luftflotte 4 dispatched 420 sorties on the\n\nsixteenth, and the Fw 190 F-8 pilots claimed success in aerial combat\n\nand against ground tar gets. Famed Stuka (and recently con verted Fw\n\n190 F-8) pilot Oberstleutnant Hans-Ulrich R udel downed an Il-2 mH in\n\na combat between Hatvan and Budapest, and dozens of So viet gro und\n\ntargets wer e reported damaged or destro yed b y S G 2 and SG 10 .\n\nIn bad weather on 22 No vember , the Hungarian Fw 190 F-8s flew\n\nthree missions, including one in the afternoon b y a dozen aircraft\n\nagainst Soviet tr oops on Csepel Island, a large l and mass in the\n\nmiddle of the Danube River just so uth of Budapest.\n\nA Harsh Winter\n\nIn late-Nov ember and early December , 3. Ukrainian Front burst\n\nacross the Danube 175 kilometres so uth of Budapest and began\n\ndriving north and north-west, to wards Lake Balaton and the area\n\nsouthw est of Budapest, creating another thr eat to the Hungarian\n\ncapital. Bad weather limited Fw 190 F-8 operations in the final days\n\nof Nov ember , so the Heeresgruppe Süd defenders lacked close air\n\nsupport at a vital time. 54 gr ound-attack aircraft did get airborne on\n\nthe opening day of December , and then 80 Fw 190s on 4 December .\n\nA Stuka pilot from III./ SG 2 r ecalled the situation in this period:\n\n“ The I. Gruppe of the Geschwader was equipped with the Fw 190 and\n\nwas based at Csor , not far from our f ormer airfield at Varpalota. The y\n\nwere supposed to pr ovide fighter protection during o ur missions, as\n\nthe protection pro vided b y Jagdgeschwader 52 co uld no longer be\n\nreliably guaranteed.”\n\n5 December 19 44 was a crucial da y , as 3. Ukrainian Front troops\n\napproached the north-eastern end of Lake Balaton, and 2. Ukrainian\n\nFront attacked north and south of Budapest. In the air , Luftflotte 4\n\nwas able to put up a remarkable (f or this stage of the war , at least)\n\n392 sorties, more than half of which wer e by the Fw 190 units. The\n\nnewly appointed K ommandeur of I./SG 2, Hptm. Bauer , downed a Yak-\n\n9 south-west of Budapest, whil e I./ SG 10 and the Ju 87s of III./SG\n\n2 were also activ e. So viet troop cr ossings on either side of Csepel\n\nIsland were al so targeted, as one Fw 190 F-8 pilot recalled:\n\n“ The Soviets wer e about to encircle Budapest. For this purpose , they\n\nformed bridgeheads acr oss the Danube. If the y could not be pre ven\n\n-\n\nted from doing so , there was a danger that the y would complete the\n\nencirclement. W e were used a couple of times against these So viet\n\nmanoeuvr es. On one occasion we caught them when the y bro ught\n\ntheir soldiers across the river on pontoons to form a bridgehead on\n\nthe west bank of the Danube . Tightly packed, the Ivans stood in the\n\nfloating vehicles, which wer e clear targets for us to spot. It was like\n\ntarget-shooting. The effect must have been terrible . Man y jumped\n\ninto the water in fear of death. Of co urse they r eturned fire with their\n\ninfantry weapons.

Ho we ver , the\n\nIII. Gruppe soon returned to action with its faithful old Stukas due to\n\nthe desperate situation in Hungary .\n\nBy 8 December , Red Army advances to the north and so uth-west of\n\nBudapest placed the city in an eastward- facing bulge , very vulnerable\n\nto encirclement. Adolf Hitler desired a co unterattack in the region in\n\ncoming weeks, and promised some armo ured units. In the meantime ,\n\nHeeresgruppe Süd had to hold on in freezing w eather with its weak\n\nforces. Luftflotte 4 was as strong as it had been since September\n\n19 44 in terms of the number of units it had on strength, and bad w ea-\n\nther allow ed the pilots and ground personnel some much-needed\n\nrest. When the skies wer e good enough f or flying, big efforts wer e\n\nmade, including mor e than 300 gr ound-attack sorties on 8 December ,\n\nmore than 20 0 the next da y , and another 300-plus on 11 December .\n\nA City Encircled\n\nThe German tanks had arrived f or a counterattack b y mid-December ,\n\nbut it was the So viets who struck first, on 20 December , as 2. and\n\n3. Ukrainian Fronts advanced from either side of Budapest, suppor-\n\nted by tw o entire air armies. All of S G 2 and SG 10 w ere on strength\n\nwith Luftflotte 4 at this stage, b ut only 56 sorties were flo wn on the\n\nopening day of the R ed Army off ensive , due to bad weather . A Ger-\n\nman counterattack the next da y achie ved only very limited success,\n\nand the Soviet thrusts fr om north and south wer e closing in behind\n\nBudapest, which was full of civilians and unprepared f or a lengthy\n\nsiege. By Christmas Da y , Budapest’s fate was sealed, and I. and\n\nII./ SG 10 and III./ SG 2 operated in the early afternoon to the w est and\n\nnorth-west of the city . While escorting III./ SG 2 around midda y , Oblt.\n\nNorbert Schmitt, the long-time Staffelkapitän of 3./SG 10, cl aimed\n\na Soviet R-5 shot do wn while it was landing near Zsámbék, just w est\n\nof Budapest.\n\nOn 27 December 19 44, the 2. and 3. Ukrainian Front spearheads met\n\nat the Danube River and completed the encir clement of Budapest,\n\ntrapping four German and tw o Hungarian divisions. German thoughts\n\nimmediately turned to a relief operation, as more tr oops and tanks\n\nwere dispatched to Hungary , although Hitler wo uld not tolerate talk\n\nof giving up the city . Meanwhile, Luftflotte 4 continued to operate as\n\nmuch as the gre y and cloudy skies allo wed. 97 gr ound-attack aircraft\n\nof I. Fliegerkorps were sent o ut on 29 December in poor visibility to\n\noperate in front of 6. Armee , hitting a railway station, and tank and v e-\n\nhicle concentrations. For the month of December , Luftflotte 4 ground-\n\n-attack aircraft claimed the destruction of 88 tanks, 547 trucks, and\n\n715 vehicles, while losing 21 aircraft in return, with fifteen others mi-\n\nssing. This was a significant contribution to the German defence in\n\nthe Budapest region.\n\nAlthough the war was going badly f or the Germans in late-19 44 and\n\nearly 19 45, the aircraft pr oduction system was still functioning, and\n\nthe Fw 190 F-9, the ultimate ground-attack v ersion of the Focke-W ulf\n\naircraft, began to arrive at Luftflotte 4 in January 19 45. Howe ver ,\n\nthe F-9 would only o ver supplement the Fw 190 F-8, not supplant it.\n\nOverall, January 19 45 sa w many vital r eplacement Fw 190 F aircraft\n\narrive at Luftflotte 4, including 69 betw een the fourth and the eighth,\n\nand another 68 between the twentieth and the 25th. The r einforce-\n\nments were much-needed after months of har d fighting.\n\nThe German relief attempt began from K omárno on the opening day\n\nof 19 45, and Heeresgruppe Süd r eported:\n\n“Our o wn air f orce was badly hindered b y cloud co ver , but carried o ut\n\n180 sorties against enemy positions in the ar ea of Székesfehérvár\n\nand north-east of T ata-T óváros. The y destro yed one tank, tw enty ve\n\n-\n\nhicles, and one locomotive .”\n\nOver the next couple of days, every time the German offensive se-\n\nemed to be making progress, the So viets reacted and held it. The\n\noffensive was supported b y aro und 360 sorties on 2 January , and\n\nLuftflotte 4 units claimed 29 tanks and 135 trucks destro yed on 3 Ja-\n\nnuary . The fourth day of the y ear pro ved to be a costly one , inclu-\n\nding Ritterkre uz-holder Oblt. Manfred Goetze of 8./SG 10, and Ofw .\n\nFriedrich ‘Frido’ Müller of 1./SG 2 both killed. Bad weather on 5 and\n\n6 January restricted Luftflotte 4 eff orts, and the German offensive\n\nhad almost come to a halt in any case . In Budapest itself , the situa-\n\ntion was becoming more desperate b y the day , and there was bitter\n\nhouse-to-house fighting. An audacious German drive for Budapest\n\nto relie ve the garrison was made in the second week of January , but\n\nhad failed by 10 January .\n\nAfter a quieter week, on 18 January , IV. S S\n\n-\n\nPanzerkorps jumped off\n\nfrom the northern tip of Lake Balaton in a ne w German offensiv e, and\n\nmade very good gro und to the south-east, reaching the Danube the\n\nnext da y . I./ SG 2 and II./SG 10 were amongst the units that pro vided\n\nsupport in the impro ved weather conditions on the eighteenth, and\n\naround 270 Luftwaff e sorties were undertaken. Mor e success was\n\nachiev ed by both Luftflotte 4 and Heer esgruppe Süd in the follo wing\n\nweek, and the Germans no w started thinking more ambitiously .\n\nHow ev er , those German plans were dashed b y a new So viet attack\n\nbeginning on 27 January 19 45, coinciding with a blizzard in central\n\nEurope .\n\nThe siege of Budapest would concl ude with unconditional German su-\n\nrrender on 13 February 19 45.

The Luftflotte 4 ground-attack units a veraged\n\n150 sorties per day in December 19 44, and 133 per day in January\n\n19 45, and this support was inval uable to Heeresgruppe Süd as it ba-\n\nttled the persistent attacks by 2. and 3. Ukrainian Fronts. The pilots of\n\nI./ SG 2 and the various other Schl achtgruppen needed all their skill\n\nand experience during this time , and their Fw 190 F-8s pro ved them-\n\nselves a most effectiv e gro und-attack aircraft.\n\nNote:\n\n1) Briefly replaced b y Generalleutnant Alexander Holle in late- August and September 19 44.\n\n2) The rest of II./SG 77 was operating further north, under VIII.

This decided\n\nthe fate of some 45, 00 0 citizens living on Jer-\n\nsey , the largest island of the achipel ago and\n\nanother 40 , 00 0 people who inhabited the se-\n\ncond largest island of Guernse y . Roughly 2, 000\n\npeople lived on the smaller islands of Alder-\n\nney and Sark while the smallest islettes of\n\nHerm, Brecqhou and Jetho u were mor e-less\n\nuninhabited (one family lived on Herm). On\n\nJune 19 the British gov ernment informed the\n\nrepresentativ es of the Islands about the situa-\n\ntion. The uniforms, equipment and weapons of\n\nthe local armed forces were to be stor ed in the\n\ndeposits and all private weapons handed o ver\n\nto the police. All this against the P rime Minister\n\nWinston Churchill’ s will. In the resulting chaos,\n\nfueled by the islanders ‘ worries abo ut their fu-\n\nture , the women and children ’ s e vacuation was\n\norganized and afterwards the men aged 20 to\n\n33 were allo wed entry to the British Isles as\n\nlong as they committed to the British milita-\n\nry service. The armed f orces personnel which\n\nwere deplo yed on the Islands at that time\n\nwere also e vac uated. The last one thousand\n\nmen left aboard S S Biarritz on June 20 .

Some 12, 00 0\n\nprisoners of war were kept on the islands as\n\nwell, for ced to work on the f ortifications and\n\nmilitary infrastructure . The\n\nratio of the local population\n\nto the number of occup ying\n\nmilitary units was unheard\n\no f.\n\nUnnecessary casualties\n\nThe information abo ut the\n\nIslands demilitarization did\n\nnot reach the Germans un-\n\nfortunately and theref ore\n\non June 2 6 Luftwaffe con-\n\nducted sev eral reconnai-\n\nssance flights ov er the Is-\n\nlands. On June 23 Admiral\n\nEugen Lindau, Marinebe-\n\nfehlshaber Bor dfrankre-\n\nich (Naval Commander f or\n\nNorthern France) repor-\n\nted to Admiral Karlgeorg\n\nSchuster that the reconnaissance flights\n\ndiscov ered long columns of trucks in both\n\nGuernsey and Jerse y ports which wer e “pro-\n\nbably bringing the military reinfor cements”.\n\nOn the contrary , the last soldiers had left the\n\nIslands already and the trucks in the pictu-\n\nres wer e full of tomatoes (on Guernsey) and\n\npotatoes (on Jersey). As a r esult, on June 28\n\nsev eral Heinkel He 111s took off from Cher-\n\nbourg in the late afternoon. Their mission was\n\nto bomb the Islands from the altitude of 3,30 0\n\nto 8,200 ft (1, 000 m up to 2,50 0 m). If this action\n\ndid not pro voke any r esponse, it meant that\n\nthe Islands military for ce was weak or e ven\n\nnon-existent.\n\nAt 18:55 the bombers appeared o ver La R oque\n\n(Jersey) and dr opped their loads on the port.\n\nIn the late evening of June 30, 1940 the German soldiers set foot on the British soil. A statement resembling an alternative his-tory tale is describing the real event. On that day, the Channel Islands became an occupied territory and remained as such until the end of hostilities. When their liberation begun, pilots of two Canadian squadr ons were participating in the operation.

Ambrose Sherwill, Attorne y General\n\nat Guernsey , telephoned directly to White-\n\nhall during the raid and with sound of falling\n\nbombs in the background demanded that the\n\ninformation about the Isl ands demilitarization\n\nis immediately transmitted. It was too late , 44\n\ncivilians lost their lives due to the “ reconnai-\n\nssance “ bombing. And while W ehrmacht\n\nwas planning the operation Grünpfeil (Gr een\n\nArro w) to capture the Islands, se veral conse-\n\nquent reconnaissance flights at lo w altitudes\n\nconfirmed that there was no military presence\n\nthere . Hptm. Liebe-Pieteritze ev en landed at\n\nGuernsey airport while another thr ee aircraft\n\nwere patr olling in the air . No resistance was\n\nspotted. The very same da y , in the late after-\n\nnoon Ju 52 was dispatched with a platoon on\n\nboard and Germans wer e met by the local\n\npolice representativ e at the airport presen-\n\nting a document which stated, in German, that\n\nthe Islands are b y the decision of His Majesty\n\ngov ernment “ opened,” and therefor e without\n\na military defense . In the follo wing meeting\n\nwith the island repr esentatives major Albrecht\n\nLanz informed, that from that moment the\n\nGuernsey was occ upied by the German arm y .\n\nJersey f ollow ed a day later , Alderne y on June 2\n\nand Sark was occupied on June 4. Major Lanz\n\nbecame the first commander of the Channel\n\nIslands occup ying for ces, although only f or\n\nbrief period. Starting from September 2 6 he\n\nwas replaced b y Rudolf Graf v on Schmettlow ,\n\nwho stayed f or more than f our years and was\n\npromoted from the Colonel rank to the Lie u-\n\ntenant general. The abov ementioned airfield\n\nat Guernsey was serving as a handy base f or\n\nLuftwaffe in man y situations, especially during\n\nthe Battle of Brittain.\n\nSuffering and helplessness\n\nImmediately after capturing the Islands the\n\nGermans forbade the local pop ulation to own\n\nthe radio receivers and or dered the driving on\n\nthe right-hand side. Shortly afterwar ds the\n\nshortage of fuel pre vented the local popul ati-\n\non from using the motor vehicles an yway . The\n\nlife of the Islands people under the German\n\noccupation was harsh. Farming produce and\n\nanimals were confiscated for German arm y\n\nconsumption on the regular basis, so the po-\n\npulation suff ered from hunger . Deportations\n\nto the concentration camps took place for\n\nvarious infractions. When in 19 41 the British\n\nand Soviet armed f orces captured Iran, Hitler\n\nissued an order to deport 10 inhabitants of the\n\nIslands to the concentration camps for each\n\nkilled German citizen. His order was fulfilled\n\nin September 19 42 and 2,20 0 people were\n\ntransported to German camps; 45 of them did\n\nnot survive . Shortly after capturing the Islands\n\nGermans started to build the important infra-\n\nstructure and a network of f ortifications, which\n\nbecame the part of the Atlantic W all and was\n\nprimarily built on Jerse y . The Germans brou-\n\nght in a lot of prisoners for the sla very work.\n\nMost of them were R ussians and other nations\n\nof the Soviet Union. An y help to escapees was\n\nharshly punished. One of the heart-breaking\n\nstories is the one of a small shop owner Lo u-\n\nise Gould who was hiding the R ussian priso-\n\nner escapee for eighteen months. She herself\n\nhad lost a son serving with the Navy and as\n\nshe confessed to her friend, she had to do so-\n\nmething for a son of another mother . In 19 44\n\nshe was betrayed, captur ed, and sent to the\n\nRa vensbruck concentration camp where she\n\nwas killed in the gas chamber in 19 45. Her sto-\n\nry was re vived in the 2018 mo vie The Guernsey\n\nLiterary and P otato P eel Pie Society , although\n\nin modified way .\n\nOmelette from nest eggs\n\nThe difficult situation of the Channel Islands\n\npopulation was w ell known to the British Go-\n\nvernment but e xcept of the sporadic raids of\n\nthe Commandos, the units under command\n\nof Admiral Louis Mountbatten (uncle of the\n\nrecently passed P rince Philip), the y could not\n\ndo anything else . The idea of the Islands libe-\n\nration was conceived already during 19 43 as\n\nthe operation Constellation. Once it was dis-\n\ncov ered that the German military strength on\n\nthe Islands gre w to as many as nearly 30 ,00 0\n\nsoldiers the plan was abandoned. The strong\n\nGerman garrison and built fortifications wo uld\n\nhave r equired the hea vy bombing from the air\n\nand naval artillery shelling, which w ould hav e\n\ncertainly resulted in heavy civilian casualties.\n\nIn the end of 19 43, the less aggressiv e opera-\n\ntion Rankin started to be worked on in thr ee\n\noptions. Option A calculated with the action\n\nprior to liberation of France, taking advantage\n\nof possible transfer of majority of the German\n\ngarrison to mainland and of lo wered morale\n\nof the remaining soldiers. The B option coun-\n\nted on the full abandonment of the Islands by\n\nGermans and finally option C considered the\n\naction after the Germany capitulation. The l ast\n\none was considered the most f easible. On No-\n\nvember 10 , 19 43 General F . E. Morgan, Chief of\n\nStaff of the Supreme Command of the Allied\n\nCorps (CO S S A C) issued the directive to e xec u-\n\nte the operation Rankin C . At the beginning of\n\n19 44 Brigadier General A. E. Sno w was named\n\na commander of the T ask Force 135 detached\n\nfrom No . 115 Brigade. Accor ding to the origi-\n\nnal plans this unit was to ex ecute the libera-\n\ntion of The Channel Islands. The independent\n\ncommand was established, and the detailed\n\nplanning commenced. On Agust 11 the opera-\n\ntion designation was changed to Nest Egg and\n\nPlymouth was selected as a launching point.\n\nFor the best planning, the information abo ut\n\nthe terrain obtained from the e vacuated in-\n\nhabitants were used and e ven mor e valuable\n\ninformation came from those who fr om time\n\nto time managed to escape in the small boats.\n\nAccording to the intelligence it became nece-\n\nssary to capture both Guernse y and Jersey in\n\none day , so the fighting force requirement was\n\nraised to three battalions of 70 0 men each. At\n\nthe same time, the transportation of 20 0 tons\n\nof food, clothing and medical supplies was\n\nfactored in. The command ho we ver was not in\n\na hurry to ex ecute the operation. After the D-\n\n-Day the German soldiers on the Islands w ere\n\nconsidered de facto prisoners from the British\n\npoint of view . Therefor e, the units assigned to\n\nT ask Force 135 wer e relie ved to support the\n\n2nd Army of General Dempse y . The operation\n\nagainst the Islands were limited to dropping\n\nthe leaflets in German language . Since Sep-\n\ntember 19 44 the y were falling fr om the sky\n\nalmost ev ery night advising the occupiers to\n\nrestrain their actions against the civilian pop u-\n\nlation.
