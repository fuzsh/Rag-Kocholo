I did a quick search but could not find any patents in the name of Holle but the ‘Pelican’ cargo carrier is shown in a 1920 patent held in the name of the Syndicate and Harris Booth (GB167068A). Booth was a designer who worked for the Air Department of the Admiralty in the war and then moved to Blackburn, hence the link to that company. I cannot find any note as to who the Syndicate members were or why Booth became associated with them.\n\nThe reference to Handley-Page in the Scientific American article concerns their slotted wings and not the ‘Alula’, so the aircraft design will be Booth again although probably not Blackburn as he had left in 1924\n\n(Edit 2022 - Holle patents are GB128341 and GB179276 and Harris Booth was no longer living near Blackburn's works in 1920 so had probably left and working freelance)\n\nAttachments\n\nPelican.jpg\n\nLast edited: 14 July 2022\n\nStargazer\n\nACCESS: USAP\n\nJoined\n\n25 June 2009\n\nMessages\n\n13,947\n\nReaction score\n\n3,617\n\n11 June 2016\n\n#14\n\nThanks a lot Schneiderman for clarifying this.\n\nhesham\n\nACCESS: USAP\n\nJoined\n\n26 May 2006\n\nMessages\n\n33,104\n\nReaction score\n\n12,771\n\nRetrofit\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n21 February 2007\n\nMessages\n\n647\n\nReaction score\n\n291\n\n11 June 2016\n\n#16\n\nFrom \"The Speed Seekers\" (Thomas G.

This is what I have found.\n\nAlexander Albert Holle, Dutch and originally a tea planter, held many patents. The earliest appears to be UK Patent 12869 for Improvements in Steam and other Fluid Pressure Engines held in association with the S.M. Car Syndicate. He became a resident in Britain sometime prior to WW1\n\nHolle established the Varioplane Co. Ltd in September 1913 to acquire the rights to his patents. Capital was £16000 in £500 shares, directors Holle, G.J.L.Nicholson and G.P.M Van Weel. The Syndicate also held patents in association with others applied for during the war years.\n\nThe patent for what became known as the alula wing, named after the small feathers on the leading edge of some birds wings, was applied for in 1918. The aim was to manage the flow of air over the wing’s surface through the application of wash-out and taper and to eliminate the need for drag-inducing ailerons by altering the air-flow and lift over the wing by the use of auxiliary aerofoils on the leading edge.\n\nIn 1919 a new company was formed to build and test an alula wing and exploit the potential. This was the Commercial Aircraft Wing Syndicate Ltd, with capital of £30000 in £1 shares. It was a co-venture between Holle, The Varioplane Co Ltd and Blackburn Aeroplane and Motor Co Ltd. Where Varioplane could appoint three directors and Blackburn two, which probably gives an indication of the split in funding.\n\nA revised patent for the alula wing was then granted in 1921; this featured a more refined version of the auxiliary aerofoil. I would think that Handley-Page’s lawyers would have had a close look at this patent as it is very similar to their slot system in some aspects.\n\nThe story of the test flights of the alula wing and the projects proposed by Booth have been covered in this thread already.\n\nHolle seems to have lost interest all in aircraft after 1921 as all his later patents refer to road vehicles.\n\nAttachments\n\nPatent 128341.jpg\n\nPatent 179276.jpg\n\nStargazer\n\nACCESS: USAP\n\nJoined\n\n25 June 2009\n\nMessages\n\n13,947\n\nReaction score\n\n3,617\n\n12 June 2016\n\n#26\n\nThanks a lot for you highly valuable contributions to this topic, Justo Miranda and especially Schneiderman.\n\nsteelpillow\n\nNot coming back.

Taylor; \"Fairey Aircraft since 1915\", Putnam, 1974, p.63, Penrose gives some information about the Varioplane Co. in his \"British Aviation: The Great War and Armistice\", Putnam. Taylor suggests that (presumably Holle) had been experimenting with flexible wings for some time.\n\nHas anybody got a copy of Penrose?\n\n[Update]\n\nHolle and a colleague called Judge patented a variable-camber aerofoil mechanism in 1916, while with the Varioplane Co. Some drawings are reproduced in L.F. Campanile; \"Lightweight Shape-Adaptable Airfoils: A New Challenge for an Old Dream\", Adaptive Structures: Engineering Applications (Ed. David Wagg, Ian Bond, Paul Weaver, Michael Friswell), Wiley, 2007, pp.89-129.

The designer's name is Wil Schuemann, though some writers use the simplified spelling of \"Schumann.\" It has a straight trailing edge with a double-tapered leading edge than blends into an elliptical curve near the tip. Schliemann was trying to solve a tip-stall problem - on the predecessor to the Discus sailplane - by encouraging a bit of span-wise (towards wing tips) flow to delay that annoying tip-stall. Schuemann wings are really only practical with modern composite materials cured in female molds.\n\nModern airliners have Schuemann-ish curved wing tips to reduce the size (and drag) of wing tip vortexes.\n\nAmusing that Alula has leading edge control surfaces. Many have experimented with leading edge controls, but none reached production. The text mentions that these novel controls were an attempt at circumventing the Wright Brothers' patents.\n\nLast edited: 26 January 2021\n\nhesham\n\nACCESS: USAP\n\nJoined\n\n26 May 2006\n\nMessages\n\n33,104\n\nReaction score\n\n12,771\n\nPMN1\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n4 June 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,222\n\nReaction score\n\n1,192\n\nTomS\n\nACCESS: Above Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n16 April 2008\n\nMessages\n\n8,756\n\nReaction score\n\n11,630\n\n13 July 2022\n\n#31\n\nWow, interesting to see containerized cargo in an aircraft design this early.

Around 1912-13 he developed the analytical methods for stressing out the individual bays of a biplane, so that it could be made both light and strong. Dick (later Sir Richard) Fairey collaborated with him while working for JW Dunne's Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate, but I am not sure if he stressed any of the planes that actually flew.\n\nFrom 1915 Booth designed several unsuccessful types for the Admiralty, before continuing the tradition at Blackburn a while longer.\n\nThe Pelican's curious wing is the \"Alula\" wing. We already have an article on it, so I would suggest we merge these threads. https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/threads/the-alula-wing-design-and-its-applications.7447/\n\nPMN1\n\nACCESS: Top Secret\n\nJoined\n\n4 June 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,222\n\nReaction score\n\n1,192\n\n13 July 2022\n\n#36\n\nDoes the Twitter source identify the original source of those illustrations?\n\nCant remember sorry, saw it on Monday and saved the piccies then.\n\nAntonio\n\nModerator\n\nJoined\n\n22 January 2006\n\nMessages\n\n3,970\n\nReaction score\n\n1,369"
