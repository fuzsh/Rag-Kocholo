        "text": "Sidi Rezegh and Tobruk are the largest disasters suffered by South Africa in its military history. Yet, despite their enormity, Sidi Rezegh and Tobruk are little understood and hardly remembered. South Africa declared war on Germany on the 6 September 1939, after a bitter internal debate, amounting to a conflict between Afrikaner nationalists and those who supported the British Empire. South Africa’s political ambivalence and disunity ran parallel to her unpreparedness for war in every important department from the lack of vital coastal defences to the miniscule size of her army and air force and complete lack of a navy. The first six months of 1941 saw the South Africans play a significant part in completely defeating the Italian colonial forces in East Africa. However, the campaign was poor preparation for what the South Africans were to encounter in the North African Desert months later. South African troops spent their time rebuilding fortifications in Egypt rather than in essential training to acclimatise this “bush war” army to harsh desert conditions. In a reluctant political decision, the unprepared South Africans were committed to Operation Crusader. The inexperienced South Africans met up with the battle hardened Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh on 23 November 1941 and were annihilated in the face of overwhelming odds. In revisiting this forgotten battle, it has been found, using primary and secondary sources, that the South Africans extracted an enormous price on the German armour in what may have been the true turning point of Operation Crusader. In May 1942, Rommel’s Afrika Korps sallied forth in a series of lightning moves that demonstrated the Axis grip on combined operations and managed to isolate the vital port of Tobruk commanded by an inexperienced South African, Major General H. B. Klopper. His surrender in one day is often compared to the previous siege endured under similar circumstances, where the Australians managed to hold Rommel at bay for 244 days until the siege was lifted. Klopper’s surrender of Tobruk resulted in a political crisis for Winston Churchill and for Jan Smuts, as the fiasco caused considerable tension within the Allied camp and within South Africa. On re-examination, interesting facts have emerged from the primary source material, as to the state of the Tobruk defences and of its unfortunate commander and how the United Kingdom, acting in concert with South Africa, sought to suppress the true facts. Immediate post-war memory has been shaped and distorted by sensitive political considerations that affected relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom. Thereafter, the memory of Sidi Rezegh and Tobruk was relegated first by a nationalistic Afrikaner government and then since by a democratically elected government, both of which have seen very little use in incorporating these two milestones into the national memory.\n\nABSTRACT | The Dunkirk Battle & Evacuation was an instant in the war (and now in military history) when modern technology came to head with old-class technology and thinking, of the past WWI. In this battle, Germany revolutionized warfare by introducing speed, large bodies of armor maneuvers, real-time radio telecommunication, focal and concentrated forward reconnaissance, unmatched planning, well-trained field commanders, high-spirit soldiers, and motivated leadership aerial bombardment in a superbly coordinated blitzkrieg. From May 9th until June 22sd, the global paramount assault on Western Europe (Battle of France) rendered Denmark, Norway, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland under German dominance, power, and influence until 1944-1945. The First Battle of Dunkirk, this moment shocked the Allies completely (England and France), and they will not recover for another two years, until November 1942, El Alamain, North Africa Campaign, and only after studying the German tactics and applying the lessons of 1939-1942 + American Assistance in logistics, armor ( 300 Sherman Tanks, completely equipped and fueled), and ammunition. Like in WWI, America's role in the war, was (totally) fundamental and tilted the wart balance in the Allies' favor. Approved in May 1941, the Lend-Lease Program, was an infusion of massive American strategic help & assistance (Britain, Soviet Russia, etc.), in military and civilian equipment, arms, supplies, energy, food, finance, technology transfer, and dedicated manpower, an enormous “gift”. Only with America (USA), the European Allies became victors in WWII. By 1949, The British Colonial Empire was lost. Then French Colonial Empire was lost, as well, by the fall of Indochina, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, and Tunisia. The Second Battle of Dunkirk, occurred as from Sept. 15th, 1944, and lasted until May 9th, 1945. The German perimeter (city and port) resisted until the very end of the War in Europe. In fact, Dunkirk was the last area under German control, to surrender, two days after the V-day in Europe, May 09th, 1945.\n\nGeorge S.Patton and Erwin Rommel became legendary heroes in World War II. Although they came from very different backgrounds, they had many common characteristics. Both of them commanded brilliant, magnificent and impressive operations during the war. Earning high appraisal from their colleagues, they took their well deserved among the great commanders of history. About seventy years passed since the tragic deaths of both of them (the American was killed in a car accident, the German was dead in a suicide ceremony ordered by Hitler), couldn’t cast a shadow over the reputation of these two most precious Commanders of Ally and Axis forces. Patton and Rommel occupy an exceptional place in history, superior to many generals whose names are not remembered anymore, with their magnificent actions and their uniqueness. Even today, the names of George S. Patton and Erwin Rommel make the hearts of many soldiers beat faster, bring images of imposing armored units commanded by Commanders who don’t accept defense as an art of war, quickly advancing behind enemy lines and destroying them like a storm. Patton and Rommel never had a chance of meeting on battle grounds. If they did, it certainly would be a struggle of life and death, a terrifying duel. Their similar tactics, undisputable courage, bravery, cool head, offensive spirits which turn to wild attacks of same degree, complete knowledge of all aspects of modern war and of its techniques earned them very important positions in world war literature. They are from different continents. Patton’s ancestors are from Southern liberal, aristocrat families who formed the first colony in California. Patton was born both very rich and very noble. His father was a wealthy lawyer who had profitable investments in the real estate business. Because of that, during his military career and his promotions, he never made any efforts to gain the love and help of his superior officers and he did not make any sacrifices from his personality. On the other hand, Rommel was born as a member of middle class Swebian family of teacher. Because of his social status, his education and his personal interests he was left outside the distinguished Prussian school of people who commanded the army. While Patton was raising naturally fast both in his social life and his military career, Rommel was almost fighting for every promotion he got. Thus the difference in the general look of their social and military life and the sensitivity they showed in performing the responsibilities they had against their countries becomes clear. Rommel was born on November 15th 1891 in Heidenheim near the city of Ulm, while Patton was born six years, four days ago in San Gabriel, California. They both had a happy childhood despite their authoritarian fathers.(Rommel’s father was a person of despotic nature, who considered himself always right and Patton’s was a person who had some eccentric ideas of his own and who didn’t trust the government in some issues including the education)As it will be remembered, while Patton was trained to be a great commander since the beginning of his education, Rommel showed great interest in engineering, and was experiencing all sorts of work to make a living\n\nThe surrender of Tobruk70 years ago was a major catastrophe for the Allied war effort, considerably weakening their military position in North Africa, as well as causing political embarrassment to the leaders of South Africa and the United Kingdom. This article re-examines the circumstances surrounding and leading to the surrender of Tobruk in June 1942, in what amounted to the largest reversal of arms suffered by South Africa in its military history. By making use of primary documents and secondary sources as evidence, the article seeks a better understanding of the events that surrounded this tragedy. A brief background is given in the form of a chronological synopsis of the battles and manoeuvres leading up to the investment of Tobruk, followed by a detailed account of the offensive launched on 20 June 1942 by the Germans on the hapless defenders. The sudden and unexpected surrender of the garrison is examined and an explanationfor the rapid collapse offered, as well as considering what may have transpired had the garrison been better prepared and led.\n\nThe German army had a number of special forces, most of which are best described by the French term hors de ligne, that is \"outside of the regular army.\" Foreign troops have always fallen into this category in every army and the Germans certainly ended up with a tremendous force of foreign soldiers fighting in their uniforms. However, the Germans had three other non-traditional forces in their army. The first, the Waffen SS, sprang from Hitler's personal bodyguard and much like many other Guard forces in the world's long military history, developed into a completely independent army all unto itself. Though not intentionally, it most assuredly falls into a category quite similar to that held by Napoleon's Imperial Guard, whose roots also are found in a dictator's personal bodyguard. Unlike the Imperial Guard, which was Napoleon's favored children, the SS belonged not to Adolf Hitler, but to Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer der SS. It was not only a field force, but a tool in the internal political struggle between Hitler's cronies."
