ISBN: 978-0-9922555-5-8\n\n1\n\nIntroduction Flames of War In Flames Of War you take on the role of a company commander manoeuvring your troops across the battlefields of World War II. This classic period of warfare is brought to life in your own game room. Grey Wolf provides the core armies in the form of Intelligence Briefings. These Intelligence Briefings allow you to field the German, Hungarian and Finnish forces that clashed with the Soviet Red Army and its allies on the Eastern Front in 1944 and early 1945. To play Flames Of War you’ll also need the Flames Of War rulebook. The rulebook contains all the rules that you need to fight miniature World War II battles.\n\nWhy collect a force from Grey Wolf? Grey Wolf provides Flames Of War you with the German, Hungarian and Finnish forces needed to recreate the battles on the Eastern Front from January 1944 to February 1945. With your German force, start by holding back the Soviet assaults to pry Leningrad from your grasp, before staunchly holding off the red tide on the Narva line in Estonia. Fight the brutal winter battles of the Korsun and Kamenets-Podolsky Pockets, escaping each in turn through determined defence and powerful counterattacks. Fight to hold the Festerplatz fortified cities in Byelorussia as the Red Army throws all its power at your German forces during Operation Bagration. If they breach your line, delay them at every turn with your blocking forces before turning back their mobile forces with your panzers and Tiger tanks. Finally bring an end to the Soviet assault on the banks of the Vistula River with elite SS armoured forces. Hold them on the river and bring their massive offensive to a stop. Throw the red scourge back across the river with counterattacks from the armoured troops of 3. SS-Panzerdivision ‘Totenkopf ’ and 5. SS-Panzerdivision ‘Wiking’. Refight the battles to hold Romania and its precious oil from the Red Army. Fight with tough infantry forces or armoured forces as the red claw makes its grab for Romania. Defend Transylvania with Hungarian and German forces as the traitorous Romanians switch sides and make to seize Hungarian Transylvania. Fight the tank battles of the Hungarian plains in October and November 1944. Hold the crossings of the Tisza River, while German and Hungarian forces re-group to fight the gruelling battle for Budapest. In 100-days of bloody battle, fight through the streets of the Hungarian capital. Hold every street with barricades and other fortifications with mixed forces of Hungarians, dismounted SS-Cavalry and elite Feldherrnhalle Panzergrenadiers.\n\nHow this Book Works The Germans in this book are divided into sections based on battles or operations. Each section has a number of forces appropriate for the battles featured. These include intelligence briefings for tank, armoured infantry, or infantry companies and other unique variations on these themes. In addition to\n\n2\n\nthe German section there is also a Hungarian section and a Finnish section including intelligence briefings for tank, motorised infantry, or infantry companies. Each company has easy-to-use charts, highlighting available platoons which represent the fighting units of your company. Each platoon diagram visually displays what troops are included in the platoon. A detailed arsenal at the end of each national section contains the specific ratings for your units’ vehicles and the weapons they use. From tanks to infantry, this book contains everything you need to get started on your army! In addition to the technical information you’ll need to build your force, this book contains plenty of inspiring pictures and history to help you capture the flavour of your new Flames Of War force! All of the forces in this book are based on historical examples that fought on the Eastern Front from January 1944 to February 1945. To find out more, visit your local game store, or visit our informative website at www.FlamesOfWar.com. Flames Of War uses a point system when setting up and playing games. Typical games are around 1500 or 1750 points, but are certainly not limited to any value! Play any point value you and your opponent decide. You can play small 600 point games in an hour or you can play mammoth games using armies that are 3000 or 5000 points or more! In most Flames Of War games you will command a company with several platoons. 3.

SS-PANZERDIVISION SS-PANZERKAMPFGRUPPE I have chosen to field a SS-Panzerkampfgruppe (found on page 108) using the 3. SS-Panzerdivision ‘Totenkopf ’ ( ) variant. I chose a company from 3. SS-Panzerdivision ‘Totenkopf ’ because of their elite status. I chose 3. SS-Panzerdivision ‘Totenkopf ’ ( ) as my division variant, so all of my combat and weapons platoons should match that symbol or have no symbol.\n\n9 10\n\nReading the instructions, I ARMOUR need to field at least a Company HQ and two Armour Combat Platoons in the black boxes. From there I’ll add some of SS-Panzer Platoon the optional platoons in grey Biermeyer’s 3. SSboxes. One of my compulPanzer Platoon sory Combat Platoon boxes contains two options. I can either take a SS-Panzer Platoon or Biermeyer’s 3. SS-Panzer Platoon, which comes with its own special rules. I decided to take Biermeyer and his platoon as one combat Platoon while my second Combat Platoon will be a standard SSPanzer Platoon.\n\n6 10\n\ngePanzerte SS-Panzergrenadier PlatOOn\n\nUNTERSTURMFührer UNTERSTURMFührer\n\nPlatOOn HQ Section with: 3 Panzergrenadier Squads 2 Panzergrenadier Squads\n\nCommand MG team\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nHQ Section\n\n260 points\n\n200 points\n\n190 points\n\n145 points\n\nUNTERSCHARFührer\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nOPtiOnS • Replace the Command MG team with Command Panzerfaust SMG team for +10 points. • Replace up to one MG team per squad with a Panzerfaust MG team for +10 points per squad.\n\nUNTERSCHARFührer\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nUNTERSCHARFührer\n\nGepanzerte SS-Panzergrenadier Platoons may use the Mounted Assault special rule.\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nGepanzerte SS-Panzergrenadier platoon\n\nGeRman\n\n111\n\nWhen building my 3. SS-Panzerdivision force I use the points in the left column. I’ll need some anti-aircraft guns to protect my tanks from the Red Air Force, so I’ve selected an Armoured SS-Antiaircraft Gun Platoon (page 112). Again, there are two available variants, but I have to choose the 3. SS-Panzerdivision variant. Next, I would also like to take a Heavy Anti-tank Gun Platoon (page 165) to deal with enemy heavy tanks. This platoon is from the German Heer (army) and is an Allied Platoon. It has no divisional symbols, but since the company diagram allows it as an option, I can take it in my company (see the following example).

This means I need to use the points listed in the column marked ( ) to match my division variant. There are two available variants: 3. SS-Panzerdivision, and 5. SS-Panzerdivision. Since I have chosen 3. SS-Panzerdivision as my variant, I must use the column marked with my division symbol (see the following example).\n\nCombat Platoons\n\nBasing your army Battlefront Miniatures packages Flames Of War products to give you everything you need to assemble your force as quickly and accurately as possible. Our blisters and box sets are packaged to give you all of the options available to build your army.\n\nHow to base different types of units Every army organises its platoons differently, and the organisation diagrams reflect this. For example, a Panzergrenadier squad in a Gepanzerte Panzergrenadier Platoon is comprised of nine men split into two teams, one of four soldiers and one of five, yet a Panzergrenadier squad in a motorised Panzergrenadier Platoon has eight men split into two teams of four soldiers. Of course, units in combat rarely maintain their theoretical strength. We reflect this by allowing you to take fewer squads.\n\nInfantry teams The fundamental building blocks of an infantry platoon are the various types of infantry teams. The most common ones are shown below with a brief description of their function and organisation. Command Teams\n\nA Command team is made up of an officer, an NCO and a rifleman on a small base. There are often options to upgrade your Command team with a different weapon. To do so, simply replace the rifleman with the chosen upgrade. You can see an example of this on the following page.\n\nRifle teams\n\nRifle teams are the basic form of infantry. All the miniatures in a rifle team will normally be armed with rifles. Some squads may have a single machine-gun, but its effect is diluted by the number of rifles in the squad. Base your rifle teams on a medium base.\n\nRifle/MG teams\n\nRifle/MG teams are organised like rifle teams, except that every squad of two teams have a machine-gun. Base Rifle/MG teams on a medium base with the second base normally modelled with a crew-fed machine-gun.\n\nMG teams\n\nMG teams are better armed than Rifle/MG teams. Every MG team has a machine-gun. Base MG teams with a crew-fed machine-gun and two to three riflemen on a medium base.\n\nSMG teams\n\nSome nations equipped entire platoons with submachine-guns. SMG teams are made up of miniatures armed exclusively with submachineguns. Base SMG teams on a medium base.\n\nPioneer teams\n\nA Pioneer team retains the normal characteristics and basing of its type, e.g. a Rifle team on a medium base, and gains combat engineering characteristics and abilities such as an increased anti-tank rating in assault and the ability to clear mines and demolish fortifications.\n\nLight Mortar\n\nLight Mortar teams are made up of a miniature armed with a light mortar and a loader on a small base.\n\nAnti-tank Infantry teams\n\nAnti-tank Infantry teams are infantry teams made up of two miniatures armed with a weapon like a Panzerschreck anti-tank rocket launcher and two loaders on a medium base.\n\nteams\n\nGun teams Artillery batteries and machine-gun, anti-tank gun, infantry gun platoons combine command infantry teams with gun teams. Information on basing gun teams can be found in Basing Your Miniatures in the rulebook. Essentially, Man-packed gun teams are mounted like infantry teams on a medium base, anti-tank and infantry guns are mounted on a medium base facing the narrow end, and artillery is mounted on a large base facing the narrow end.\n\nPlatoon diagrams Each platoon diagram indicates the required squads and teams you must have to make that unit combat-worthy. Troops and vehicles in black are the core of the unit. Troops and vehicles in grey are options that you can add to give them more punch or mobility. Many platoons also include options allowing you to improve the equipment or capabilities of some of the teams. The platoon entry will also list the special rules that the platoon follows.\n\n6\n\nEach platoon entry in a Flames Of War book reflects the historical make-up of the platoon, and tells you how to base the blister or box set that represents that particular unit. The following example shows a platoon of Panzergrenadiers and how to assemble it using the contents of the GBX09 Panzergrenadier Platoon (Late) box.\n\nTHE PLATOON ENTRY FROM THE BOOK (PAGE 77) Gepanzerte Panzergrenadier Platoon\n\nLeutnant or oberfeldwebel Leutnant or Oberfeldwebel\n\nPlatoon HQ Section with:\n\nCommand MG team Sd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\n3 Panzergrenadier Squads 2 Panzergrenadier Squads\n\nHQ Section\n\n220 points 155 points\n\nUnteroffizier\n\nUnteroffizier\n\nOptions • Replace the Command MG team with a Command Panzerknacker SMG team for +5 points or a Command Panzerfaust SMG team for +10 points. • Replace Sd Kfz 251/1 half-track in HQ Section with a Sd Kfz 251/10 (3.7cm) half-track at no cost.\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nUnteroffizier\n\nGepanzerte Panzergrenadier Platoons may use the Mounted Assault special rule.\n\nMG team\n\nMG team\n\nSd Kfz 251/1 half-track\n\nPanzergrenadier Squad\n\nBuilding the Platoon\n\nGepanzerte Panzergrenadier platoon\n\nUse the diagram below to base your platoon.

Both sides suffered huge losses in men and machines. However, they were losses the Soviets could make good, but from which the Germans would never fully recover. In August 1943 the Red Army began a series of massive counteroffensives that gathered in momentum, driving the invaders before them.\n\nThe Soviet counteroffensives Even while fighting continued at Kursk, the Red Army launched a series of counterattacks throughout the second half of 1943 that eventually led them to the Dnepr River. Generalfeldmarschall Manstein scrambled to plug the holes, pleading for reinforcements for his battered Army Group South. Reluctantly, Hitler released 48. Panzerkorps to reinforce the crumbling German lines. This allowed the beleaguered Germans to hold on until the autumn rains created a quagmire, halting Soviet attacks.\n\nCounterattack at Zhitomir In December the bitter cold of the harsh Russian winter had frozen the mud solid. In a bold move that caught the Soviets by surprise, 4. Panzer­armee attacked north of Zhitomir. The Soviet forces reeled before the ferocity of the assault and Red Army reserves were rushed west to bolster the lines. Army Group South recaptured Korosten and bought itself a little time to regroup.\n\nThe Korsun-Cherkassy pocket On Christmas Eve Vatutin’s First Ukrainian Front attacked. Most of Army Group South fell back to the Panther-Wotan line, but by early January large numbers of German troops still remained in exposed positions. Manstein sought to pull the exposed troops back to safety but Hitler, reluctant to take another backward step, ordered them to hold fast. The Soviet First and Second Ukrainian Fronts quickly enveloped the Germans, trapping 56,000 men from six divisions in the Korsun-Cherkassy pocket. A relief force was hastily assembled to rescue the trapped divisions. Belatedly, Hitler authorised a withdrawal from the pocket. Soviet artillery shells and rockets pounded the retreating German columns mercilessly. The retreat became a rout and the troops abandoned almost all of their equipment.\n\nRelieving Leningrad Even as Army Group South suffered defeat in the Ukraine, far to the north troops from the Soviet Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts attacked the fortified lines south of Lake Ladoga. The offensive surprised the German Eighteenth Army besieging Leningrad and they were steadily driven back from the approaches to the city by wave after wave of assaulting infantry. On 18 January Red Army troops finally broke the siege that had lasted nearly 900 days.\n\n8\n\nDisaster in the Crimea Back in the south the Red Army maintained its momentum as troops of the Third Ukrainian Front swept across the Southern Ukraine, reaching the borders of Romania by 12 May. The Soviet advance had cut off the German and Romanian troops under General Janecke in the Crimean peninsula. On 8 April Soviet troops attacked and quickly overwhelmed the Axis defences. On 9 May the German garrison in Sevastopol surrendered.\n\nOperation bagration By May the Red Army had recaptured large areas of the motherland from the invaders. The Crimea and the Ukraine were back in Soviet hands and the Germans had been driven back from the approaches to Moscow and Leningrad, yet still large swathes of Byelorussia remained under German control. On 22 June the Soviets launched Operation Bagration with the First Baltic, Second and Third Byelorussian Fronts smashing into the German defences between the cities of Vitebsk and Bobruisk, centred on Orsha. The Germans took a heavy toll on the attacking Soviet forces, but the Red Army still had more to give. By 25 June German forces were retreating back to the fortified cities, before Soviet assaults drove the Germans first out of Vitebsk, then Orsha, while encircling Mogilov and Bobruisk. As German forces retreated towards Minsk, Berlin sent Generalfeld­marschall Model to stop the Soviet advance. Every available soldier was thrown into the battle in improvised blocking forces. Two panzer divisions and a heavy tank battalion were thrown against the Red Army’s spearheads, delaying the onslaught bravely. More infantry, cavalry and armour were sent against them, but eventually the weight of the red tide told. Minsk fell on 3 July and the Germans withdrew to prepare for the next assault.\n\nOn to the Vistula The initial Soviet spearheads of Operation Bagration had reached their objectives by mid July. They had retaken Byelorussia and now found themselves engulfing the Festerplatz (fortified) cities in eastern Poland. Soviet forces began to establish bridgeheads over the Vistula River. Clashing upon the banks of the Vistula the Soviets locked horns with German forces holding the river and the doorway to Germany and Berlin. The battles raged from Sandomierz in the south to the villages north of Warsaw. However, vigorous counterattacks by SS, Luftwaffe and Heer armoured forces finally halted the Red Army and Operation Bagration finally ended.\n\nAssault on Romania When the Crimea fell to the Red Army in May 1944, only a handful of Romanians were left to be evacuated. In the\n\nmeantime the Romanians were rebuilding, only returning to the fight when the advancing Soviets reached Romanian territory. In June 1944, the Soviets pushed the Romanians and Germans back across the Bug River and entered Bessarabia. The Red Army was on the very doorstep of Romania.\n\nto Hungary to deal with the threat and a massive clash of armoured forces delayed the Soviet offensive at Debrecen. However, the respite was temporary as the great red sledgehammer was soon ready to swing again. The Red Army drove on towards Budapest, the Hungarian capital.\n\nThe Germans and Romanians established a defensive line along the Bessarabian frontier. This held until the Soviets launched a massive offensive on 20 August 1944. Two Soviet thrusts were directed at the cities of Iasi and Chisinau. Powerful Soviet armoured forces smashed through the Romanian lines and the small Romanian and German armoured reserves couldn’t stem the tide.\n\nGerman and Hungarian forces attempted to stop the encirclement of the city, and a mixed corps of German and Hungarian troops held the city from repeated assaults by Soviet and Romanian forces. This savage and bitter struggle lasted for 100 gruelling days, but the city was finally taken on 13 February 1945.\n\nShortly afterwards, to save Romania from total destruction, an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union for Romania to swap sides and join the Allies. Romanian troops were soon in action defending the Transylvanian border from Hungarians trying to capture the vital passes through the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nMeanwhile the fight for Hungary continued as three German counter-offensives failed to break the siege. Eventually the assaults were called off on 27 January 1945 and the priority became the delay of the Soviet push on Austria.\n\nFINLAND\n\nThe Invasion of Hungary\n\nVyborg\n\nLeningrad\n\nAfter the fall of Romania three massive Soviet armies turned on Hungary which was desperately defended by six German and Hungarian armies.

The experienced Oberstleutnant Dr Franz Bäke was placed in command and they were hurled into action. Kampfgruppe Bäke is a fully self-contained force and although primarily a panzer unit of Panther and Tiger tanks, it had its own supporting infantry and artillery.\n\nStuG Batterie (Assault Gun Battery)\n\nPg. 58\n\nEvery well-equipped German infantry division had a battalion of assault guns, this is especially true of 78. Sturmdivision. The 189. Sturmgeschutzabteilung (189th Assault Gun Battalion) follows the sturm grenadiers’ assaults, taking out subborn Soviet resistance. Riding into battle with them are the Begliet (tank escorts), who fight from the StuG G assault guns with STG44 Assault Rifles, protecting the StuGs from enemy infantry.\n\nPg. 70\n\nThe heavy Tiger I E tanks of 502. Schwere Panzerabteilung and 505. Schwere Panzerabteilung provide the power to engage and destroy even the most tank heavy Soviet battalions. Hitler has also released the first battalion of fortyfive new Tiger II heavy tanks, which were delivered to 501. Schwere Panzerabteilung to defeat the Soviets at Sandomierz, Poland in August 1944.\n\nPanzerkompanie (Tank Company)\n\nPg. 72\n\n5. Panzerdivision and 12. Panzerdivision were rushed into the line to halt the Soviet breakthrough at the start of Operation Bagration. Other panzer divisions fought up and down the Eastern Front throughout 1944. The panzers of a Panzerkompanie have undergone a constant evolution throughout the war. They are heavier, better armed and more mobile than those of your enemies.\n\nSS-Panzerkampfgruppe (SS Armoured Battle Group)\n\nPg. 108\n\nSS tank forces provide ample striking power to decimate enemy units. Newly refurbished with fresh recruits, the Kanonen (Tank Aces) of the Panzer companies provide the leadership needed to strike a deadly blow to advancing Soviet tanks.\n\nFeldhernnhalle Panzerkampfgruppe (Feldhernnhalle Armoured Battle Group) Pg. 130\n\nThe Panzerkampfgruppe is the powerful strike arm of the Panzerdivision. By assembling the panzers and armoured panzergrenadiers together the division had a potent weapon with which to blunt the enemy’s advance or overrun them.\n\n10\n\nMOTORISED FORCES SS-FreiwilligenPanzergrenadierkompanie (SS Volunteer Motorised Infantry Company) Pg. 38\n\nWhile the Panzer divisions seize enemy held ground in sweeping counterattacks it is the role of Panzergrenadier divisions to quickly follow up and hold the new positions. However, on the Narva River the foreign volunteer SSPanzergrenadiers hold the line against vigorous Red Army assaults, before organising counterattacks to retake ground.\n\nGepanzerte Panzergrenadierkompanie\n\nSchwere Panzerkompanie (Heavy Tank Company)\n\nPg. 138\n\nIn the latter half of 1944 the Hetzer tank-hunter became available in increasing numbers and these were used to equip both assault gun and tank-hunter units. Many of these newly formed or refitted units went into battle supporting infantry forces where the Hetzer tank-hunter performed well in its dual role as an assault gun and tank-hunter.\n\n(Armoured Infantry Company)\n\nPg. 76\n\nThe Gepanzerte Panzergrenadierkompanie are the elite of the mechanised infantry. Instead of trucks they are equipped with armoured Sd Kfz 251 half-tracks giving them the mobility and armour to accompany the tanks into the fighting.\n\nPanzergrenadierkompanie (Motorised Infantry Company)\n\nPg. 80\n\nThe Panzergrenadierkompanie uses trucks to bring its veteran sold­iers to the battlefield where they dismount and fight on foot. Well-supported by Panzers, assault guns and mobile artillery their usual role is to attack defences to create a breakthrough for the Panzers, or to hold the ground they take with the Panzers as a counterattack reserve.\n\nGepanzerte Panzerpionierkompanie (Armoured Engineer Company)\n\nPg. 86\n\nA Panzer division’s armoured pioneers are heavily-armed assault specialists. Equipped with armoured half-tracks the Gepanzerte Panzerpionier Platoon’s combat engineers are well protected during the opening phase of close assaults.\n\nPanzerpionierkompanie (Motorised Engineer Company)\n\nPg. 88\n\nMost of the combat engineers of the Panzerdivision are motorised in trucks. The Panzerpionier troops are called forward when enemy fortified positions need to be cleared. In defence, they are equally good at creating barriers and obstacles around strategic positions. Well armed with rifles, machine-guns, mines and demolition carriers, these pioneers are able to take on anything that the Soviets can throw against them.\n\nGERMAN\n\n(SS Motorised Infantry Battle Group)\n\nSperrverband Pg. 110\n\n(Blocking Force)\n\nPg. 94\n\nThe unique make up of the ‘Wiking’ division allows you to field either Danish or Flemish troops. The Totenkopf (Death’s Head) division has its own Tiger company, as well as Sturmtiger assault howitzers, in support to assist them in erasing Soviet tanks or assault groups from the battlefield.\n\nIn the desperate days of the Bagration breakthrough Sperrverband forces organised a core of veterans and supported them with the best troops available, allowing them time to dig in, prepare solid defences, and halt the Soviet tank hordes in their tracks.\n\nFeldhernnhalle Panzergrenadierkompanie\n\nErsatz Pionierkompanie\n\n(Feldhernnhalle Motorised Infantry Company)\n\nIf you see the need for more fortifications and engineering in your defence then try the Ersatz Pioniere (Reserve Pioneers). They provide the manpower and expertise you need to solidly hold the line until you can counterattack with your Panzers.\n\n(Reserve Engineer Company) Pg. 134\n\nThe Feldhernnhalle Panzer division’s panzergrenadiers are excellent infantry provided with transport for fast deployment. In Budapest they mostly fight on foot from street fortifications. They are supported by weapons platoons from their own division as well as allied Hungarian platoons.\n\nINFANTRY FORCES Grenadierkompanie (Infantry Company)\n\nPg. 26\n\nA Grenadierkompanie is the finest infantry force you can command. The troops are all experienced veterans and they are backed by the best weapons that the German army can provide, from StuG assault guns to the feared Tiger, your Grenadierkompanie will never be out-gunned or out-classed.\n\nFallschirmjägerkompanie (Parachute Rifle Company)\n\nPg. 32\n\nThe Fallschirmjäger are Germany’s paratroopers. Like all paratroopers, they are tough, tenacious and independent fighters. Though no longer making air assaults, they are Germany’s finest light infantry, quite capable of holding their position in the most dire situations.\n\nSturmkompanie (Assault Company)\n\nPg. 98\n\nSicherungskompanie (Security Company)\n\nPg. 118\n\nThe Sicherungskompanie was primarily used to hunt down partisans. However, as the front lines in Byelorussia crumbled German security forces were thrust into the front lines. While fighting partisans, or guarding the rail and roadways behind the lines, swiftly advancing Soviet spearheads sometimes forced security forces to hold until support could arrive.\n\nSS-Kavallerieschwadron (SS Cavalry Squadron)\n\nPg. 140\n\nDuring the siege of Budapest the 8. SS-Kavalleriedivision ‘Florian Geyer’ and 22. SS-Freiwilligen-Kavalleriedivision ‘Maria Theresia’ cavalry divisions were trapped inside the city. They fought furiously against the red onslaught on foot alongside the Hungarians to save their glittering capital. Like all good modern cavalry they easily adapted to fighting on foot, making use of the good defensive positions.\n\nRECONNAISSANCE FORCES Panzerspähkompanie\n\nPg. 52\n\nThe 78. Sturmdivision was organised in early 1943 as a specialised assault division. The concept of the Sturmkompanie went beyond the normal grenadier organisation by giving it a lot more heavy equipment, such as its own integral 7.5cm PaK40 anti-tank guns, a heavy platoon and the support from the divisions own StuG Batterie, which lends immediate armoured support whenever needed.\n\n(Armoured Car Company)\n\nPg. 90\n\nArmoured cars do not generally engage the enemy directly except when confronted by a weak enemy or at the point of attack. Armoured car patrols are the true reconnaissance troops of an Aufklärungsabteilung (reconnaissance battalion). While the rest of the battalion is beating a path through the enemy the armoured cars goal is to exploit the gap in the lines to get behind the enemy and scout out his positions.\n\nPionierkompanie (Engineer Company)\n\nPg. 60\n\nThe Pionierkompanie is composed of tough well-trained combat engineers ready to do two things: undertake dangerous engineering assignments while under fire, and storm enemy positions by close assault.\n\nGERMAN\n\n11\n\nGerman Forces\n\nSS-Panzergrenadierkampfgruppe\n\nHungarian Forces ARMOURED FORCES\n\nINFANTRY FORCES Puskás Század\n\nHarckocsizó Század (Tank Company)\n\nPg. 192\n\nThe armoured troops are highly motivated and well trained. They fight with a mix of Hungarian and German tanks and call on support from their infantry, anti-aircraft, and artillery. In addition they fight side-by-side with the Germans and are supported by German armour, artillery and aircraft.\n\nRohamágyús Üteg (Assault Gun Battery)\n\nPg. 200\n\nThe assault gun battalions are the elite mobile arm of the Hungarian artillery. They use their own native Zrínyi assault howitzer, or German StuG G or Hetzer assault guns. They are supported by the divisions they fight with, which includes Hungarian tanks, anti-tank, infantry, reconnaissance, anti-aircraft, artillery and aircraft, as well as German panzers, panzergrenadiers, and aircraft.\n\nMOTORISED FORCES Gépkocsizó Lövesz Század (Motorised Infantry Company)\n\nPg. 196\n\nThe motorised infantry of 1 and 2 Armoured Division are commanded by veterans of the battles on the Don in 1942 to 1943. They are some of the best troops in the Hungarian armies. These skilled riflemen keep pace with the rapid movements of the tanks to provide support when it is needed, ready to take captured positions and hold them against counterattack. st\n\n12\n\nnd\n\n(Rifle Company)\n\nPg. 202\n\nThe bulk of the Hungarian Army, or Honvéd (pronounced hon-veed), was made up of the infantry of the Puskás Század (Rifle Company). The Hungarians have built up their infantry forces rapidly as the threat of Soviet invasion loomed. Some divisions have been raised from reservists and new recruits, while other divisions call on the experience of previous battles. The Hungarians had also been reforming their organisation and arming their troops with more modern heavy weapons such as German 75mm anti-tank guns, 120mm mortars and German Panzerfaust and Panzershreck anti-tank weapons. They can even call on the support of their own assault guns in armoured support.\n\nÖnkéntes Puskás Század (Volunteer Rifle Company)\n\nPg. 206\n\nThe riflemen of the Budapest defence infantry come from a variety of sources, from highly motivated volunteers to professional police and regular soldiers. All the different forces trapped inside Budapest fought together and supported each other. In addition to the machine-guns of their weapons platoons, they are backed by mortars, assault guns, panzers, anti-tank, infantry, reconnaissance, heavy mortars, anti-aircraft, artillery and aircraft.\n\nHUNGARIAN\n\nARMOURED FORCES\n\nINFANTRY FORCES\n\nPanssarikomppania (Tank Company)\n\nJääkärikomppania Pg. 224\n\n(Light Infantry Company)\n\nPg. 228\n\nFinnish Panssari (Tank or Armour) units are seasoned veterans, who have had up to two years training. They have learnt to survive operating obsolete Soviet light and medium tanks and are now full of confidence in heavier T-34 tanks. Some Panssari companies are a mixture of the captured Soviet medium tanks. However, most brave crews still soldier on in T-26 and T-28 tanks The T-26 tank remains the most numerous tank in the Finnish arsenal.\n\nThe Jääkäri (light infantry) remain the best of the Finnish infantry, and rigorous training and patrolling has kept them so during the quiet of 1943. Their tactics emphasize speed and mobility. A high proportion of their leaders are volunteers or former regular army officers and often the men are from rural areas with excellent fieldcraft skills. For them the best form of reconnaissance is attack.\n\nSturmikomppania\n\n(Infantry Company)\n\n(Assault Gun Company)\n\nPg. 226\n\nWith new German-supplied Sturmi (StuG III G) assault guns, the Panssari division now packs quite a punch. The Sturmi crews have been training hard, are led by selected officers picked from Jääkäri units, and are ready for battle against the toughest foes. Their 75mm guns, combined with the skill of their Finnish crews, have enabled them to achieve impressive kill ratios, even against Soviet heavy armour.\n\nJalkaväkikomppania Pg. 232\n\nThe Jalkaväki (infantry) are superbly trained and experienced, although some of the troops grow weary from five years of war. Jalkaväki regiments are balanced with infantry, light infantry (Jääkäri scouts), machine guns and mortars. Each regiment has an anti-tank unit. Divisional support is better than ever, with anti-aircraft, anti-tank and artillery support readily available and even modern assault guns – the Sturmi.\n\nPioneerikomppania (Engineer Company)\n\nPg. 236\n\nThe Pioneerikomppania (Engineer Company) provide the Finnish divisions with experts in field engineering and mine clearing. They also serve as excellent assault troops for taking our enemy’s fortifications. In attack their satchel charges, flame-throwers and pioneer skills are invaluable.

In January 1944, the Red Army launched an offensive that threatened to encircle the besieging army. Through a series of skilful rear guard actions, the III SSPanzerkorps was able to withdraw to the natural defensive positions on the Narva River near the city of Narva. As they arrived, the German forces found that the defensive fortifications of the Panther Line existed only on paper. There were a few emplacements from the invasion in 1941, but generally these were in poor locations for the current battle. The ground was frozen making the preparation of new trench lines difficult. However, the terrain offered a choke point with Lake Peipus in the south and the Gulf of Finland to the north connected from south to north by the Narva River. The river represents the border between Russia and the Baltic nation of Estonia. If the Red Army could drive the Germans from Narva, they would remove them from the whole region. This would score both a strategic and political victory for Stalin’s armies. The river was icy and the bridges were the key to both the defence of Narva and the success of the Soviet attacks. The Red Army did not wait for the Germans to settle. On 2 February 1944 the Second Shock Army immediately attacked the German bridgehead on the east side of the Narva River. This bridgehead was a seven mile long line stretching from the village of Lilienback in the north to the village of Dolpaya Niva in the south.\n\n16\n\nManning this position were troops from 4. SS-Freiwilligen Panzergrenadier-Brigade Nederland and 11. SS-Freiwilligen Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland. These units were unusual in that they consisted of volunteers from European countries other than Germany (Freiwilligen means volunteers). On 3 February the Soviet attack began with a thrust through the defences on the eastern side of the river. Soviet tanks broke through and threatened to establish their own bridgehead on the western side of the river. The Nordland SS-Divison’s Panzer Battalion, named Hermann von Salza, and the Tiger tanks of 502. Schwere Panzerabteilung (502nd Heavy Tank Battalion), which included Tiger ace Leutnant Otto Carius, joined the battle. They defeated the Soviet armour, and with their support, the Nordland infantry was able to recapture the position on the eastern side of the river. On 11 February the Soviet 43rd Rifle Corps attacked north of the city, but was met strongly by the 227. Grenadierdivision and the Nederland SS-Brigade. In the south, attacks by the Red Army’s 109th and 122nd Rifle Corps were somewhat more successful advancing 7½ miles before being stopped by Nordland SS-Division, 170. Grenadierdivision and the Panzergrenadierdivision Feldherrnhalle. Soviet assaults continued up and down the Narva line. In the north the Soviets established a bridgehead on the western side of the river near the village of Siivertsi. After nine days of heavy fighting the Soviets were again forced back to the east side of the river.\n\nOn 14 February the Soviet hight command (Stavka) issued new orders to General Govorov commanding the Red Army on the Narva front. A fresh Soviet assault south of Narva by the 30th Guard Rifle Corps broke through the defensive line and established a bridgehead. By 24 February the assault forces had swung in a wide arc around Narva, reaching the rail line supporting the city and threatening to encircle the defenders. It was stopped when Panzergrenadierdivision Feldherrnhalle and 502. Schwere Panzerabteilung counter attacked.\n\nGeneral Govorov attempted to revive the assault on 2 March by bringing fresh forces to bear against the Narva defences. These attacks also floundered. Rather than allow the Soviets to consolidate the few gains they had achieved, the German forces launched a series of vicious counterattacks between 4 and 6 March. These attacks recaptured the lost ground and returned the front to its February positions. In response, on the night of 6/7 March, the Red Air Force made a massive bombing raid on the city of Narva, reducing it to ruins. The surviving civilians fled west, but the defenders positions remained intact.\n\nAfter a week of relative quiet, March saw a renewed offensive by the Soviets. At dawn on 1 March, the Red Army began a 20-minute artillery barrage against the German positions. This was followed by the advance of units from three rifle corps. The artillery barrage proved inadequate against the well dug in defenders and the advance halted after heavy casualties. Accurate and timely German artillery played a large part in breaking up the assault, as did the Luftwaffe even though the Soviets enjoyed a roughly 3 to 1 advantage in air power. The Soviet assault had gained little.\n\nNarva-Jöesuu\n\nThe Soviets continued attacking up and down the Narva Line probing for weaknesses. One attack against Nederland’s 49. SS-Freiwilligen Panzergrenadier Regiment broke through towards the river. The Soviets committed their tank reserves to seize the bridges across the river into the city. The defenders counterattacked with Nordland’s Herman von Salza Panzer Abteilung. The panzers stopped the advancing tanks, but they were prevented from exploiting their advantage by heavy anti-tank fire from the eastern side of the river.\n\n3 February\n\nGulf of Finland\n\n2 February 1 March 2 February\n\nSillamäe\n\nLillienbach Siivertsi\n\n8 March\n\nNarva\n\n19-23 April\n\nDolpaya Niva\n\n26-31 March\n\nSirgala 6-8 April 7 February\n\nVyaska 2 February\n\n11 February\n\nPutki\n\nNarv a\n\nRiver\n\nKrivasu\n\n14 March\n\nN\n\nGorodenka\n\nKaroli 2 February\n\n0 Lake Peipus\n\nMiles\n\n0 Kilometres\n\n5\n\n10 10\n\n15\n\n15 20\n\nOn 23 March Hilter ordered the creation of Festung Narwa (Fortress Narva) to be held at all costs. The Germans launched a series of counterattacks beginning on 26 March. These attacks were designed to eliminate the Soviet bridgehead gained by the 30th Guard Rifle Corps in February on the western side of the river. They drove the Red forces back to the river, but not across it. The attacks could not be sustained with the equipment and manpower available, but the threat was sufficient that General Govorov ordered the construction of extensive defensive works on the eastern side of the river to prevent a possible breakout. By the end of March, the Red Army was not able to defeat the Germans at Narva. The Germans had succeeded in rapidly reinforcing their position, while the Soviets were hampered in their attacks both by the terrain and a poor cooperation between the various units in the sector. The thaw in April and the rasputitsa (muddy season) forced a halt all major operations until late May.\n\n17\n\nKorsun Pocket The battle for the Korsun Pocket was a huge complex battle involving 400,000 men fighting over an area 100 square kilometres for three weeks. On 24 January 1944 the Soviet First and Second Ukrainian Fronts, having regrouped after their successful campaigns at the end of 1943, attacked south of Kiev hitting the positions of the German First Panzer Army near the town of KorsunShevchenkovskiy (100 miles southeast of Kiev). The aim was to trap the Germans in a pincer formed by the two fronts, taking advantage of the desire of the Germans to hold some part of the Dnepr River, rather than withdraw. The Soviet First Ukrainian Front attacks met serious resistance the following day and suffered heavy casualties from concentrated German artillery. The battle around Korsun raged through the following days and by 28 January 1944 the Soviets had encircled six German divisions from the XI and XLII Korps (Eighth Army). Hitler insisted that the surrounded positions on the Dnepr River be held and forbad any breakout attempt. In response Field Marshal von Manstein, commanding Army Group South, began to assemble an armoured force to break into the encirclement. By 4 February Von Manstein had massed four panzer divisions and an ad hoc heavy tank regiment under Dr. Franz Bäke (one battalion each of Tigers and Panthers) and began his counterattack to relieve forces trapped around Korsun. The force was denuded of the full strength 24. Panzerdivision at the last minute when Hitler personally intervened to send it south to help at Sixth Army at Nikopol. The German forces inside the pocket were designated Kampfgruppe Stemmermann (after the senior commander) on 5 February. The Soviets stepped-up attacks to reduce the pocket the same day. To compound difficulties for both sides, the temperature plummeted to well below zero throughout the battle area. By 7 February Kampfgruppe Stemmermann, while under continuous pressure from Soviet attacks, contracted its perimeter, abandoning Gorodische and Yanovka, and began to prepare for a breakout attack. Meanwhile, von Manstein’s break-in operation continued against very heavy resistance. On 8 February the Soviets offered Kampfgruppe Stemmermann the opportunity to surrender, but it refused. The Germans redoubled their efforts to fly supplies into the pocket and exit flights were able to evacuate some of the seriously wounded. Having finally assembled an effective force, III Panzerkorps began its relief attacks on 11 February. They get within 10 miles of the pocket, but Soviet resistance stiffened in the following days.\n\n18\n\nDnepr River\n\nMedvyn\n\nKorsun-\n\nCherkassy\n\nShevchenkovskiy V’yazivok\n\nZvenyhorodkha Shpola Lebedyn\n\nOn 14 February Soviet forces captured KorsunShevchenkovskiy against the determined resistance of the SS Walloon Brigade, of 5. SS-Panzerdivision Wiking. As the perimeter of the pocket continued to shrink Hitler grudgingly gave permission to attempt a breakout on 15 February. The following day the III Panzerkorps was stopped 12 miles from the perimeter of the pocket. The relief forces were exhausted and it was concluded that any further action would be fruitless. Led by the remnants of 5. SS-Panzerdivision Wiking, Kampgruppe Stemmermann launched their attempt to break out on 17 February. In a blinding snowstorm they managed to find a seam in the Soviet defences. At dawn, the weather cleared and the Soviet cavalry and aircraft pounced on the columns of fleeing Germans. Having abandoned their heavy equipment, the breakout turned into a rout as desperate men fled from the carnage. General Stemmermann was killed along with many of his men. However, around 35,000 men escaped. They had little more than their personal weapons, if that. However, if Stalin had expected a battle of annihilation like at Stalingrad, he was mistaken. The Germans had effected their escape and the pocket was empty. The Korsun Pocket was a Soviet victory, though it came at a high price and the Germans could claim that most of their men escaped the trap. The intensity of the battles was born out in the casualty figures. In two months the Soviets lost 25,000 killed, 56,000 wounded (from 240,000) and half their 500 tanks. For the Germans claims vary, but as a minimum 20,000 Germans in the pocket were killed or captured, and another 11,000 escapees were wounded (from 55,000). In addition a similar number of killed and wounded were lost from the relieving forces, which also lost over 100 tanks (from 80,000 men and 300 tanks).\n\nKamenets-Podolsky (Hube’s) Pocket. On 4 March 1944 the Soviets began another offensive aimed at pushing Army Group South out of the Ukraine. Taking advantage of the weakening of the southern German positions by moving panzer troops northwards for the Korsun Pocket battles, the Soviets drove the First and Second Ukrainian Fronts to the north and south of the 1. Panzerarmee, eventually encircling them by 25 March. Leading the 1. Panzerarmee was Generaloberst Hans Valentin Hube, a standout general, known as ‘Der Mensch’ (‘The Man’) among the soldiers. Having experienced the encirclement of 6. Armee at Stalingrad he took steps to limit a potential disaster by ordering all administrative and non-combat personnel to the rear and reducing the number of non-combat vehicles in the area to save fuel. The Soviet encirclement was complete by 25 March with six Soviet armies applying pressure to Hube’s force. At the same time the external encirclement of another three Soviet armies, was designed to force the German 4. Panzerarmee and 8. Armee back and stop any rescue operation. With the 1. Panzerarmee still holding the bridge over the Dniester at Khotin, it seemed obvious to the Soviets that at some point Hube would attempt an offensive south. The two Soviet fronts began to shift forces southward to prepare for this break out. Manstein and Hube, seeing the strengthening of the Soviet southern forces, began to devise a counter plan. In spite of the strength of the forces to the north and west of the 1. Panzerarmee and the distance of 125 miles to the 4. Panzerarmee lines, Manstein wanted Hube to breakout west. This would force the 1. Panzerarmee to fight its way out of encirclement against some of the strongest forces surrounding it. On 25 March Hitler gave Hube authority to break out as well as giving Manstein command of II SS-Panzerkorps, consisting of 9. and 10. SS-Panzer divisions (Hohenstaufen and\n\nZbrucz River\n\ne Seret Riv r Chortkov\n\nSkala KamenetsPodolskiy\n\nRiver\n\nFront Lines German Forces Russian Forces\n\nHube repositioned his forces into three distinct kampfgruppen, the first and second being northern and southern attack groups. The kampfgruppen were to carry out the initial break out west while a rearguard group would fight aggressive withdrawing engagements. The North and South spearheads were led by Panzerkampfgruppe Bäke and his Panthers as well as the other panzer divisions. The Tiger companies of the 509. Schwere Panzerabteilung dominated the rearguard. Early afternoon radio reports of 28 March and reconnaissance indicated to the Soviets that the 1. Panzerarmee was making preparations to cross the bridgehead and break out south. Believing the break out was heading south the Soviets relaxed their other armies and focused all attention on the southern units. This played perfectly into Hube’s plan. On the night of 28/29 March, Panzerkampfgruppe Bäke broke west with 1. Panzer army’s entire force behind it. A blizzard began the night of 28 March blanketing everything in thick white snow, a mixed blessing that slowed movement, but also provided concealment. By 29 March, the first Panther battalions of 1. Panzerarmee had seized three separate bridgeheads across the Zbrucz River and were advancing against Soviet defenders in the valley between the Zbrucz and the Seret. It was at this point that the Soviet commanders realised they’d been tricked. The southern break out was simply deception. Immediately, intense attacks were launched against the 1. Panzer army’s rearguard. However, they held off the Soviet attacks, halting the assault by 31 March. The Soviets were masters of keeping their advance moving in the winter conditions, but the Germans were equal to the task. The Luftwaffe kept 1. Panzerarmee fuelled and supplied enough for the constant moving and fighting, both day and night, over the two week running battle. II SS-Panzerkorps slammed into the weakly held lines around Podgaitsy, smashing through on 4 April. The next day, advance elements of 1. Panzer army’s breakout force met elements of the II SS-Panzerkorps. Over the next few days, elements of 1. Panzerarmee pushed forward into 4. Panzer army’s lines at and around Buczacz on the Strypa River. The breakout had been secured, but fighting continued for another two weeks into April as all of 1. Panzer army’s divisions and men were successfully withdrawn.\n\nTernopol\n\nDniester\n\nFrundsberg), 100. Jäger and 367. Infanterie divisions, which would fight their way from the 4.

They re-established a new front line from the Dniester River up to the town of Brody. They suffered minimal casualties but lost most of their heavy equipment throughout the almost month long battle. Having saved the 1. Panzerarmee Generaloberst Hube, after receiving Diamonds for his Knight’s Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, tragically died when his plane crashed in the Austrian Alps after leaving his medal ceremony.\n\n19\n\nSchwere Panzerregiment Bäke The year 1943 drew to a close in the cold of the Ukrainian winter, with German Army Group South in crisis. Retreating everywhere since the defeat at Kursk, a succession of Soviet offensives saw the liberation of Kharkov, Kiev and the crossing of the Dnieper River line. They were outnumbered everywhere, and knew that another Soviet strike would surely come in the new year. Faced with the reality that he could not possibly hold the line, Feldmarschall von Manstein realised that he needed mobile reserves. It was at this time that the German general staff’s genius for organisation and flexibility was demonstrated. Hurriedly independent units and portions of larger formations in reserve were flung together to form a kampfgruppe. An experienced commander, Oberstleutnant Dr Franz Bäke, was placed in command and soon formed a unique group of forces into a cohesive regiment. Then they were hurled into action. Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke’s first battle was at the Balabonowka pocket in January 1944, where it immediately had to halt a Soviet offensive. On the boundary between First and Fourth Panzer Armies, five Soviet Tank Corps from 1st Tank Army had broken through and headed for Vinnitsa. On the open steppe between the Bug and Dneiper Bäke’s Tigers and Panthers met the Soviets. They destroyed over 250 Soviet tanks for the loss of just four. During this battle Bäke personally destroyed three Soviet tanks at close quarters with infantry weapons. Next Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke led attempts to relieve the Korsun Pocket. III Panzerkorps and XLVII Panzerkorps were rapidly launched in counter-offensives to break them out. Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke formed the spearhead of III Panzerkorps. Thrusting through two Soviet Infantry corps and 5th Guards Tank Corps (including units equipped with IS-2 heavy tanks), Regiment Bäke reached the Gniloy Tikich River, just ten kilometres from the pocket. Though falling short it held the southern flank open to allow thousands of the trapped men to escape. There was little time to recover after Korsun. In March Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke was itself encircled in the Kaminets-Podolsky pocket, better known as Hube’s pocket. Here Zhukov and Konev launched another offensive with two huge pincers, this time cutting off the entire 1. Panzerarmee under General Hans Hube in a huge sack between the Bug and Dniester Rivers, further to the west of Korsun. By now von Manstein and Hube were not about to sit idly by waiting for orders. While his force was mobile he would get himself out. Rather than break through the bulk of the Soviet spearhead in front of him, von Manstein ordered Hube to thrust sideways, through the weaker Soviet flanking forces. Once again Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke formed part of the spearhead of Brieth’s III Korps. They were part of the force that cut through the Soviet infantry along the Zbruch River. Hube had ordered all non-fighting equipment to be ruthlessly discarded and both combat and support units moved with the panzers as transport. These desperate measures worked and led to the successful break-out. 1. Panzerarmee reached German lines on 5 April.\n\n20\n\nWith both Soviet and German forces worn out on the southern front, there was finally time to regroup and for the Germans to stabilise the front. In May 1944 Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke was split up and its components returned to their parent divisions.\n\nOrganisation of Schwere Panzer Regiment Bäke The German army had long practiced combining tactical sub-units into a Kampfgruppe for particular operations. As the war dragged on, and gradually turned against Germany, this virtue of flexibility became a necessity. By the Late War period many Kampfgruppen up to regimental or divisional size became semi-permanent, with internal logistics to sustain them. In the long term this practice was the unfortunate side effect of rendering many conventional divisions understrength due to various missing sub-units. Nevertheless, some of the Kampfgruppen were highly successful. Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke was a fully self-contained force created by combining various independent units with others withdrawn from line divisions. Although primarily a panzer unit, it had supporting infantry and artillery.\n\nOberstleutnant Dr Franz Bäke By 1944 Oberstleutnant Dr Franz Bäke was one of the most capable and experienced front-line panzer commanders in the German Army. Born in 1898 in the town of Schwarzenfels, Bäke had served in World War One as an enlisted man. He fought in the infantry on the western front including the battle of Verdun, was wounded, awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and finished the war as a sergeant and officer candidate. Between the wars he studied dentistry, gained his doctorate, and established a successful professional career. Still a reservist, Bäke was called up in 1937, and was a Leutnant commanding a panzer platoon at the start of the war. Bäke’s platoon was part of the Panzerabteilung 65, 1. Jägerdivision, later reorganised as 6. Panzerdivision. Equipped with the Czech Panzer 35(t) tanks. Bäke’s unit took part in the invasion of Poland, where Bäke served well and was promoted to company commander. In France 1940, 6. Panzerdivision formed part of Guderian’s strike force through the Ardennes. Bäke’s Company captured a key bridge across the Meuse. Wounded twice in the campaign, Bäke was awarded the Gold Wound Badge and the Iron Cross, First Class. In 1941 6. Panzerdivision was transferred to East Prussia for Operation Barbarossa. Bäke’s role changed to a staff position in charge of recovery of damaged tanks. As regimental Ordinanz-Offizier he carried out tank recovery with his customary energy and intelligence. With Operation Typhoon reaching its climax he often led ad-hoc kampfgruppen forward on missions. After the winter of 1941/42 the worn-out 6. Panzerdivision was withdrawn to France for rebuilding. Bäke was promoted to commander of II Abteillung/11. Panzerregiment. By the\n\ntime the rebuilt division was ready for combat Stalingrad had been encircled. 6. Panzerdivision was transferred back east and thrown into the relief attempt. Unable to break through, it then helped encircle and destroy Soviet tanks thrusting towards Kharkov. For this action Bäke was awarded the Knights Cross in January 1943. At Kursk 6. Panzerdivision formed part of Hoth’s 4. Panzerarmee attacking from the south. Wounded again himself, Bäke continued and took over command of 11. Panzerregiment when its commander was severely wounded. Bäke led the unit through the defensive battles towards the Dneiper, receiving the Oak Leaves to the Knights Cross in August 1943. He was promoted to Oberstleutnant der Reserve and ordered to form Schwere Panzerregiment Bäke in December 1943. Six months of intensive combat involving the Regiment proved Bäke’s ability to command larger formations. Bäke was awarded the Swords to the Knights Cross for his efforts to relieve the Korsun pocket in February 1944.\n\nAfter further defensive battles Bäke’s unit was disbanded in May 1944. Bäke took command of Panzer Brigade 106 Feldherrnhalle, now forming in the west with Panthers and armoured infantry. By September these were fighting defensive battles against Patton’s Third US Army. At first successful against US tanks, Bäke suffered his first defeat when he attacked the US 90th Infantry Division, which took the Panzer attacks in its stride and counterattacked the Panzergrenadiers. The Feldherrnhalle panzer brigade fell back with heavy losses. In January 1945 Bäke completed a course in divisional command and in March led Panzerdivision Feldehernhalle 2 in the final offensive in Hungary. Bäke led them back to Czechoslovakia where he was promoted to General in April. In May he led them in a breakout through encircling Soviet forces to surrender to American forces at the Elbe. After the war Bäke was held as a POW until 1950, and then returned to his dentistry career until his death in a car accident in 1978.\n\nOBERSTLEUTNANT\n\nDr Franz Bäke\n\nCHARACTERISTICS Franz Bäke is a Warrior and Higher Command Team rated as Fearless Veteran.

Though there were never enough to go around, the German Tiger battalions proved themselves a serious problem for the Soviets. Kill ratios of three or four to one were common for Tigers across the Eastern Front. Unleashing your Tigers upon the enemy will certainly cause their commander great concern. His armour losses will swiftly mount and his battle plan will suffer immediate reassessment.
