        "text": "The Luftwaffe is the air arm of the German Wehrmacht. It was founded in 1935, and controls most of Germany's military flying units, the national radar network, and the German arsenal of strategic surface to air missiles. It also possesses ground forces in the form of 2 Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger divisions, and a third Waffen-SS Fallschirmjäger division attached.\n\nThe present Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe is Generalfeldmarschall Arne Kreuzinger-Janik.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe Luftwaffe is divided into several regional air fleets (Luftflotten). The Luftwaffe Air Fleets are assigned to OKE and to its subordinate fronts. Some air fleets contain all of the aircraft under a particular front, while others contain some of the aircraft in a front. Each Air Fleet contains its own depot level facilities, and support units. The Air Fleets also control their own light Flak and FlaRak units that defend Luftwaffe bases from air attack.\n\nLuftflotte 1\n\nLuftflotte 1 is assigned to OK Ost in the Eastern Front. It's role is to support the two northern Armies on the Eastern Front. It is equipped with fighters strike aircraft, and close support aircraft. It also has a number of medium bombers. Support aircraft include electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nLuftflotte 2\n\nLuftflotte 2 is assigned to OK Süd, and is based in Italy. Luftflotte 2 is primarily a command formation. Its peacetime German assets include a Geschwader of Tornados (probably intended for nuclear strike, as the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana) has several Gruppi of its own Tornados), a number of command aircraft (converted Airbus A310 aircraft), a Geschwader of tankers, and a small Staffel of liaison aircraft. Its main wartime role would be to control the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana, and parts of the French Armée de l'Air, and the Spanish Ejército del Aire.\n\nLuftflotte 3\n\nLuftflotte 3 is Germany's strategic transport force. It is assigned directly to OK Europa and supports all other fronts. During wartime, it would control the strategic transport aircraft of all EU air forces. In peacetime, LF3 can charter civil aircraft. Lufthansa is the primary recipient of these charters, however other EU airlines can be used (for instance, support for German forces in Cuba is usually done by Air France, KLM, or British Airways). In wartime, civil airliners are requisitioned by the EU's armed forces. LF3 controls most of those airliners. Smaller regional airliners, however, can be parceled out to the various Fronts.\n\nFallschirmjägertruppe\n\nThe Fallschirmjägertruppe is assigned to OK Europa as a strategic intervention force. It contains two Fallschirmjäger (airborne) divisions and commands an SS Fallschirmjäger division. It works with Luftflotte 3.\n\nLuftflotte 5\n\nLuftflotte 5 is assigned to OK Abschreckung (\"Deterrence\" Front) and is equipped with strategic bombers. Its tasks include delivery of strategic nuclear weapons, delivery of tactical nuclear weapons and long range conventional strike (the latter two roles occur when LF5 forces are temporarily assigned to another Luftflotte)\n\nReichsluftverteidigungkommando\n\nThe Reichsluftverteidigungkommando (Reich Air Defence Command) is assigned to OK Zentral and is the German component of Europäische Luftverteidigungskommando (European Air Defence Command). It maintains a network of radars covering the skies from the Arctic Circle to the Canary Islands, and from the western coast of Ireland to Theoderichshafen (Sevastopol). It also maintains a group of ballistic missile warning radars.\n\nIts forces include interceptors, and surface to air missiles. Interceptors include the Panavia Pa 200J Tornado (also known as the Tornado ADV or Tornado LVV) used for long range patrol and the Messerschmitt Me 663 used for shorter range engagements. Surface to air missiles cover key points. The Luftwaffe operates long range mobile SAMs and a small (but growing) number of missile defence interceptor missiles.\n\nLuftflotte 7\n\nLuftflotte 7 was formed to support the Atlantic Front. It was disbanded in the late 1960s when the Kriegsmarine Naval Air Service took over all maritime aviation tasks.\n\nStrategischeflugkörperkommando\n\nThe Strategic Missile Command is the counterpart of LF5. As its name implies, it operates intercontinental ballistic missiles. Some of its missiles are based in Germany, but most are based in the General Government, Ostland, and the Ukraine. This decision was taken in order to safeguard German cities from the effects of a \"counterforce\" strike. This decision was flawed due to the fact that the ground nuclear bursts required to destroy missile silos produce massive amounts of fallout, which would drift to Germany and Western Europe, but the silos were nonetheless built.\n\nToday, only a small number of German ICBMs are silo-based. Most of Germany's current ICBM force is mobile.\n\nLuftflotte 9\n\nLuftflotte 9 is the third Luftflotte assigned to OK Ost. It includes the transport, refueling, airborne early warning, and battlefield surveillance aircraft of the Eastern Front. It also contains a force of Arado Ar 534 strategic bombers, intermediate range ballistic missiles and Tornado strike aircraft. These are believed to act as a \"Front Commander's discretionary strike force\".\n\nLuftflotte 10\n\nLuftflotte 10 contains training and liaison squadrons. It is based in Germany and reports to OK Zentral. It also performs the Luftwaffe's VIP role.\n\nLuftflotte 11\n\nLuftflotte 11 is primarily based in Norway and supports the Northern Front. It is commanded by OK Nord. Like LF2, LF11 is small. It has a small number of strike aircraft, plus command aircraft and tankers. This is not a great disadvantage in wartime, as LF11 would incorporate the Norwegian Air Force.\n\nLuftflotte 12\n\nLuftflotte 12 is assigned to OK Ost in the Eastern Front. It's role is to support the two southern Armies on the Eastern Front. It is equipped with fighters strike aircraft, and close support aircraft. It also has a number of medium bombers. Support aircraft include electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft. It is smaller than Luftflotte 1. In wartime, it would incorporate the Romanian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian air forces.\n\nLuftflotte 13\n\nLuftflotte 13 is the newest German Air Fleet. It is based in German Palestine and supports the South Eastern Front under the command of OK Südost. It operates across the Middle East, providing support to the air forces of Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. In wartime it includes the Italian units in Italian East Africa and French units in Lebanon. In a Middle Eastern conflict, these Axis forces are intended to contain Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Emirates.\n\nAircraft\n\nBombers\n\nAircraft\n\nRole\n\nVersions\n\nService Entry\n\nComments\n\nFocke-Wulf Ta 800 Strategic bomber, cruise missile carrier Ta 800 B\n\nTa 800 D\n\nTa 800 R 1956 See below for other roles Arado Ar 534 Blitz III Supersonic heavy bomber Ar 534 A 1987 Variable geometry Junkers Ju 332 Subsonic medium bomber Ju 332 D 1957 (D model: 1989) Crescent wing [1]\n\nTactical Fighter/Attack Aircraft\n\nAircraft\n\nRole\n\nVersions\n\nService Entry\n\nComments\n\nPanavia Pa 200 Tornado Interdiction/Strike\n\nInterceptor\n\nElectronic Warfare Pa 200 A\n\nPa 200 J\n\nPa 200 E Pa 200 A: 1979\n\nPa 200 J: 1985\n\nPa 200 E: 1990 Collaborative European design Eurofighter Ef 2000 Taifun Strike fighter (A)\n\nConversion trainer (B) Ef 2000 A\n\nEf 2000 B 2003 Collaborative European design, intended to replace the Ta 390 and Me 663 Messerschmitt Me 663 Strike fighter Me 663 B\n\nMe 663 C 1984\n\n(C/D: 1992) Primary fighter of the Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Me 609 Strike fighter Me 609 C\n\nMe 609 D 1973 Secondary fighter of the Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Me 563 Fighter Me 563 E\n\nMe 563 D\n\nMe 565 F 1961 Reserve fighter SEPECAT Ta 390 Jaguar Ground attack Ta 390 C (attack)\n\nTa 390 D (trainer) 1973 Collaborative European design Focke-Wulf Ca 393 Weihen Close air support Ca 393 F, Ca 393 H (single-seat)\n\nCa 393 G, Ca 393 J (twin-seat) 1969\n\n(F: 1992) STOVL aircraft, most development work by British Aerospace under the name Harrier\n\nStrategic Transports/Tankers\n\nAircraft\n\nRole\n\nVersions\n\nService Entry\n\nComments\n\nAirbus A500M Strategic transport A500M 2010 Four-engined cargo aircraft, maximum payload 75 tonnes Junkers Ju 652 Tanker Ju 652 LB 1973 Four-engined jet airliner, used as a tanker.\n\nLast wholly German jet airliner.
