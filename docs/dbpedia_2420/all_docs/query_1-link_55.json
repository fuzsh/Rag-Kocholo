        "text": "German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and Airborne Forces for the campaign in the West (May 1940) and Norway.\n\nHere to German Orders of Battle for the campaign in the West, May 1940.\n\nGerman Air Force\n\nFor the campaign in the West the Luftwaffe deployed 3,902 aircraft (1,482 bombers and dive-bombers, 42 ground-attack planes, 1,016 fighter planes and 248 Me 110 twin-engined fighters).\n\nColonel-General Kesselring commanded Luftflotte 2 with I, IV and IX Fliegerkorps (Air Corps) in support of General von Bock’s Army Group B.\n\nColonel-General Sperrle commanded Luftflotte 3 with II, V and VIII Fliegerkorps in support of General von Rundstedt‘s Army Group A.\n\nGerman Airborne Forces\n\nGerman airborne forces, known as the Fallschirmjäger, played a prominent role in various operations during World War II. These elite paratrooper units were part of the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) and were involved in several key battles and operations throughout the conflict.\n\nOverview\n\nOrigins and Early Development:\n\nFormation: The Fallschirmjäger were established in the mid-1930s as part of the expansion and modernization of the German military. Their creation was inspired by the success of Soviet and Italian airborne forces.\n\nTraining: Fallschirmjäger troops underwent rigorous training, including parachuting, glider assaults, and extensive combat preparation, making them some of the most well-trained and versatile soldiers in the German military.\n\nMajor Operations and Engagements:\n\nNorway and Denmark (1940) – Operation Weserübung: The Fallschirmjäger played a critical role in the invasions of Norway and Denmark in April 1940. They captured key airfields and installations, facilitating the rapid German advance.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands (1940):\n\nFort Eben-Emael: One of the most famous early operations involving Fallschirmjäger was the assault on Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium on May 10, 1940. Using gliders, they landed on top of the fort and quickly neutralized its defenses, showcasing their effectiveness and the element of surprise.\n\nDutch Airfields: Paratroopers also captured vital airfields and bridges in the Netherlands, aiding the German advance through the country.\n\nCrete (1941):\n\nOperation Mercury: The Airborne invasion of Crete in May 1941 was the largest airborne operation conducted by the Germans. Despite heavy losses, Fallschirmjäger successfully captured the island, demonstrating their capability but also highlighting the high cost of airborne operations.\n\nEastern Front:\n\nFallschirmjäger units were deployed in several operations on the Eastern Front, often being used as elite infantry due to their versatility and combat effectiveness.\n\nItaly (1943-1945):\n\nMonte Cassino: Fallschirmjäger were heavily involved in the defense of Monte Cassino, where they earned a reputation for their tenacity and fighting skills.\n\nAnzio and Other Battles: They also played significant roles in various battles across Italy, often being used to counter Allied advances.\n\nWestern Front (1944-1945):\n\nNormandy and Beyond: Fallschirmjäger units participated in the defense against the Allied invasion of Normandy and subsequent battles in Western Europe, including the defense of key positions during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nStrengths:\n\nElite Training: Fallschirmjäger were highly trained and well-equipped, capable of rapid deployment and effective in both offensive and defensive operations.\n\nSurprise and Shock: Their ability to strike unexpectedly from the air provided a significant tactical advantage in many early operations.\n\nLimitations:\n\nHigh Casualties: Airborne operations were inherently risky, and the Fallschirmjäger suffered heavy casualties, especially in large-scale assaults like Crete.\n\nLogistical Challenges: Sustaining airborne forces in prolonged operations was difficult due to supply issues and the need for specialized equipment and transport.\n\nLegacy:\n\nThe Fallschirmjäger left a lasting legacy as one of the most effective and respected airborne forces of World War II. Their operations demonstrated the potential and limitations of airborne warfare and influenced post-war military thinking and the development of airborne units in other nations.\n\nCreation of the German Parachute Troops\n\nThe formation of parachute troops began almost simultaneously in both the German Army and Air Force. On 1 October 1935, General Goering’s personal guard regiment, which originally had belonged to the Prussian Police, was transferred to the Luftwaffe as the General Goering Regiment. At the same time volunteers from the regiment were sent to Altengrabow training ground where the formation of the Luftwaffe’s parachute rifle regiment was taking place.\n\nIn Spring 1936 the Army established an experimental staff with 15 officers and 80 other ranks, which was to become the Army’s parachute rifle battalion. During the occupation of the Sudetenland the battalion came under the tactical command of the Luftwaffe, and on 1 January 1939, the battalion was transferred to the Air Force. From then on the Luftwaffe assumed total responsibility for the recruitment, training, equipment and operational control of parachute troops, and Germany became the only country in which parachute troops were exclusively part of the Air Force.\n\nAlthough paratroops were part of the Luftwaffe, the other component element of Germany’s airborne forces, the air landing troops, remained as part of the Army. Air landing troops were infantry soldiers trained in the skills of rapid airborne landings (as indeed their name suggested) and equipped with a number of specialized lightweight weapons.\n\nIn July 1938 Major-General Student was transferred to the Luftwaffe from the Army, to undertake the development of the parachute troops, but by the time the Germans went to war in September 1939, the 7th Airborne Division was still in the process of formation.\n\nAfter a winter spent in further specialist training an air landing corps was formed from the 7th Airborne Division and the 22 (Air landing) Infantry Division.\n\nGermany’s parachute troops played a small, though successful, role in the Norwegian campaign which included the relief of General Dietl’s beleaguered command at Narvik. Some ‘paratroopers’ dropped during this operation were mountain soldiers who had undergone a seven-day parachuting course. The invasion of Holland and Belgium in 1940 saw the most spectacular triumph of this new arm when paratroops under the command of Major-General Student captured the modern Belgian fortress of Eben Emael and the bridges over the Albert Canal, the key points in the line of Belgian fortifications.\n\nReferences and literature"
