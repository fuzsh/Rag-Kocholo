The objective of the work is to provide a reliable and stimulating source of information and reference for serious students and for the interested lay reader concerning what is a pivotal period in twentieth-century European history. The book is arranged as a collection of compact, succinct biographies listed in alphabetical order and giving basic information about the careers of nearly 350 individuals who were prominent or significant in the Third Reich. Through their lives I have tried to tell the story of Nazism, to link each biography to a facet of the Third Reich so that the interlinking of their careers comes to form an intricate web reflecting the multitude of cross-connections that made up Hitler's Germany. The individuals represented in this volume exercised a very wide range of occupations, social and political roles. In addition to the top rank Nazi Party leaders, SS and Gestapo personalities, Wehrmacht and diplomatic personnel, I have included civil servants, jurists, industrialists, intellectuals, churchmen, academics, artists and entertainers. The actors, writers, film makers, dramatists, painters, sculptors, architects, musicians, philosophers and historians who remained in Nazi Germany and achieved some prominence are an important, if neglected, facet of the reality of the Third Reich. I have also given attention to the brain-drain from Nazi Germany, including in particular some of the distinguished scientists (physicists, mathematicians, chemists, etc.) and writers who were forced to leave their homeland for racial or political reasons. Entries dealing with Hitler's academic experts in the fields of eugenics, anthropology and racial ideology, with the SS doctors, Commandants of concentration camps and Higher Police and SS leaders implicated in the 'Final Solution' emphasize the criminal, totalitarian character of the régime. On the other hand considerable information is also provided about the German Resistance which embraced a broad span of opinion, including Protestant theologians, Catholic politicians and priests, Social Democrats, conservatives and army leaders. The most difficult problem in preparing this work was one of selection. Had my focus been narrowed only to Nazi Party leaders, the list of potential candidates would still have run into thousands. On what basis then could I make an adequate selection of entries which would constitute a representative cross-section of German society in the period between 1933 and 1945? To what extent could one disregard the careers of individuals who were primarily active under the Weimar Republic? Many of the subjects in this volume were still alive after 1945 - could one ignore their subsequent fate? Finally, how far should the length of the various biographies vii\n\nPreface reflect the relative importance of their role and according to what criteria was this to be decided? Inevitably, my own attempt to resolve these dilemmas will reveal to a certain degree subjective tastes, preferences and areas of interest and I have not shrunk from exercising value-judgements where this seemed warranted. This is one historical subject where claims to absolute objectivity and detachment sound somewhat artificial and forced, not to say dishonest. In many cases the existing historiographical literature provided a fairly reliable guide as to who should be included but with regard to lesser known figures (though not unimportant in their sphere) the task was more difficult and access to information by no means easy. Indeed, it is doubtful if this work could have been written had I not had the good fortune of working at the Wiener Library as editor of its Bulletin from 1974-5 until 1980. The personal files, documentary material, press cuttings and historical works in its great collection on Nazism and the Third Reich provided the indispensable bedrock on which this volume is based. I should like to thank the staff of the Wiener Library in London and its director Professor Walter Laqueur; Mrs Johnson, Mrs Kehr and Janet Langmaid for guiding my first steps; Lord Weidenfeld for suggesting the project and Linda Osband for her editorial assistance; also the staff of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and of Der Spiegel magazine in Hamburg, as well as Joachim Hoelzgen of the London bureau and professor M. R. Marrus (Toronto). This book is primarily a work of reference but it is also intended to stimulate the interest of the general reader and provide him with a basic tool for further research. To facilitate its readability I have adopted a narrative, chronological approach to each entry and avoided the temptation of providing footnotes for citations. However, a comprehensive bibliography at the back of the book should provide the interested reader not only with some of the background material used in the preparation of this study but also with suggestions for further reading. I have also added a glossary to explain all the major German terms used in the text. A biographical dictionary such as this is not intended to be a substitute but rather a necessary resource material for additional research. The swollen grandeur, the monstrous horror and the tragedy that was Nazi Germany naturally cannot be encompassed in its entirety by a collection of biographies, however representative; but the lives which have been captured in these pages can provide the reader not only with reliable information but also with the human (and all too often inhuman) dimension which is the sine qua non for understanding this crucial period in modern history. ROBERT WISTRICH\n\nLondon / Jerusalem 1980-1\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION When this book first came out in 1982 it was widely recognised as a unique reference guide to the leading personalities of the Third Reich. In a compact, easily accessible form it focused on top-ranking party leaders, SS and Gestapo personnel, diplomats, administrators, outstanding Wehrmacht generals and army commanders, industrialists, jurists and churchmen. Apart from these pillars of the règime, it also included life portraits of artists, scientists, academics and other intellectuals. There were profiles of entertainers, sportsmen and other celebrities, prominent at the time, if largely forgotten today. I made a special point of including opponents as well as proponents of the règime, both the resistance fighters and the distinguished writers and scientists who fled from Nazi Germany for racial or political reasons. This wide selection enabled the book to provide a more rounded picture of all aspects of life under Hitler and to relieve somewhat the almost unbearable litany of evil that inevitably springs from its pages. From the outset I was determined to break with the usual format of the Who's Who, in order to provide much more than a mere catalogue of names, ranks, dates and numbers. I wanted this to be a book which is not only objective and reliable as a work of reference, but which is also incisive, lively and readable from beginning to end. Hence I have permitted myself the use of pointed quotation, implicit approval or criticism, the note of black humour, the scathing irony or touch of biting sarcasm where necessary. In dealing with such a scale of inhumanity and cruelty, a completely dispassionate and value-free approach would itself surely be suspect. Nevertheless, as reviewers noted at the time in both Britain and Germany, this is not a deliberately judgemental book. It allows the broader story of Hitler's Germany to emerge naturally from the chilling detail of the individual biographies. This book can and should be read not simply as a kind of dictionary or reference guide but also as a collection of nightmarish short stories which I doubt that any fiction-writer could have made up. It is a world where smooth élite figures, dull apparatchiks, corrupt judges, lawyers and opportunist academics rub shoulders with vicious Gestapo officials and SS murderers; where brilliant generals mix with scholars, writers, playboys and stars of stage and screen; where criminals, dissidents and artists come together as actors in a singular drama whose reverberations are still being felt to this day. Where else, except in a book like this, can one find Martin Heiddeger alongside Heydrich, Karajan with Kaltenbrunner, Richard Strauss next to Julius Streicher? By interweaving these stories together, I have sought to illuminate the connection between the aesthetic and the barbaric, the normal and the homicidal, the everyday banality and the criminality of the Third Reich. We can surely learn most about the Nazi régime and the wicked ideology which it so ruthlessly implemented by studying the people who made it up, through their individual life-histories. This involves much more than simply dealing with the hard-core of the Nazi Party; hence the effort in this guide to encompass as broad a cross-section of German society as possible, within the limitations of available space. Wherever possible I have also sought to record the careers of the individuals included in this volume after World War II. Not only was this information generally lacking elsewhere but by pinpointing these details I have been able to show some of the inadequacies and failings in the de-Nazification process. Post-war German courts often handed down derisory sentences and many war criminals ix\n\nPreface were released long before their time was served. This book demonstrates just how easily SS and Gestapo personnel, jurists, bureaucrats, bankers and industrialists involved in the Nazi régime could continue successful careers after 1945, as if nothing had happened. Today, fifty years after the end of the Third Reich, such a reference volume is more than ever necessary. With the revival of the siren-call of fascism and Nazism in Germany and much of Europe, with the denial of the Holocaust and efforts at relativizing the history of the Third Reich, the need for reliable and accessible information is paramount. I have accordingly updated and extended the earlier edition, adding some new entries and bibliography. May this book serve both as a guide and a warning to those born after 1945, to guard preciously the flame of freedom. ROBERT S. WISTRICH\n\nNeuberger Chair of modern European history, Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jewish Chronicle Professor of Jewish Studies, University College, London Jerusalem, November 1994\n\nx\n\nA wheel of his speeding car. His death may have been a revenge killing for his role in sending French Jews to the gas chambers.\n\nAbetz, Otto (1903-58) German Ambassador to Vichy France, Otto Abetz was born on 26 May 1903 in Schwetzingen and matriculated in Karlsruhe, where he became an art teacher at a girls' school. He was a supporter of the NSDAP from 1931 and took up relations with French ex-servicemen on its behalf. In January 1935 he entered the Foreign Service under von Ribbentrop (q.v.). His activities as its Paris representative led to his expulsion from France in 1939, but following the German occupation (after the fall of France), Abetz returned in June 1940 and in November received accreditation as German Ambassador a post he held for four years. The embassy was theoretically responsible for all political questions in occupied and non-occupied France, and for advising the German police and military. Abetz's primary objective was to secure complete collaboration from the French, but as a Party activist - he held the rank of SS-Standartenführer — he also sought to seize the initiative as much as possible suggesting, for example, that all emigre, stateless Jews should be expropriated and expelled to the Free Zone. Abetz regarded anti-semitism as an important lever in undermining the grip of the army and church in Vichy France and replacing it by a pro-German, anti-clerical, populist mass movement. In July 1949 he was sentenced to twenty years' hard labour by a Paris military tribunal, as a war criminal. Released in April 1954 he was burned to death in a motor 'accident' four years later on the Cologne—Ruhr autobahn when something went wrong with the steering\n\nAbs, Hermann (1901-94) Hermann Abs, once described by David Rockefeller as the 'leading banker in the world', was born in Bonn on 15 October 1901, the son of a lawyer. After studying law and a brief apprenticeship in a Cologne bank, Abs gained experience and connections in international banking abroad in Paris, London, New York and Amsterdam. In 1929 he was already the director of an Amsterdam bank and a year later he became a confidential clerk for the Berlin private banking house of Delbruck, Schickler and Co. By 1935 he was a partner in this firm, whose clients included Hitler and Rosenberg. In 1937 Abs was nominated to the Vorstand (managing board) of Germany's biggest bank, the Deutsche Bank. The bank's profits were greatly augmented by 'Aryanization' and the expropriation of banks in newly annexed territories. Thus, the Deutsche Bank absorbed the Jewish-owned Mendelsohn bank and bought another big Jewish company, Adler and Oppenheimer, at knock-down prices. After the annexation of Austria, Bohemia and Moravia, it took over Austria's giant Creditanstalt Wiener Bankverein as well as Czech banks and industries. Thus, by the end of 1938 Abs, who was in charge of the Deutsche Bank's Foreign Department, was already at one of the nerve centres of German power. Acknowledged as a rising star by Hjalmar Schacht (q.v.), President of I\n\nAbs, Hermann\n\nAbs, Hermann\n\nboard (Aufsichtsrat). Towards the end of the war Abs, along with some other leading German industrialists and bankers, began to plan ahead for after the defeat. He was asked by the British Military Government to help rebuild the German banking system after 1945, on the assumption that it was imperative to get the German economy moving again. Under American pressure Abs was stripped, however, of his 45 directorships and arrested as a suspected war criminal on 16 January 1946, but released after three months thanks to British intervention. A detailed report in 1947 on the Deutsche Bank, which suggested that there was enough evidence to prosecute Abs as a war criminal, was disregarded. By 1948 the banker was in effect managing the German economic recovery programme and had won the trust of the Allies. On 1 March 1948 Abs was appointed Deputy Head of the Reconstruction Loan Corporation and President of the Bank Deutsche Länder, which decided on the allocation of Marshall aid to German industry. Thus not only did Abs escape prosecution at Nuremberg (though the Yugoslavs sentenced him to death in his absence as a war criminal after 1945) but he would successfully rebuild the Deutsche Bank after World War II. Moreover, his prewar international connections proved invaluable in financial diplomacy on behalf of the Federal Republic. Already in 1951 Abs had negotiated the German foreign debt at the London conference, on behalf of the new German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer (q.v.). He was seen as indispensable to re-establishing Germany's post-war creditworthiness. Adenauer wanted him as his first Foreign Minister but had to bow to a French veto. Abs would remain Adenauer's close friend and financial adviser. In 1957 Abs became Chairman of the Board of the Deutsche Bank (a post he held until 1967) and then Chairman of its Supervisory Board. At the time,\n\nthe Reichsbank, his good relations with British and American bankers, his commercial and diplomatic skills led to his being entrusted with sensitive missions on behalf of the Third Reich. This also involved resisting efforts by Germany's creditors seeking repayment of the vast loans made to it after World War I. The urbane Abs, solid, discreet and powerful ('a velvet glove around an iron fist') was perfectly suited by his international standing to such diplomacy. A devout Catholic who was never a member of the Nazi Party (though he joined the DAF) his loyalty was never in doubt and his services were indispensable to the Nazi Party and Government in preparing the economic base for German hegemony in Europe. He helped bankroll the German industrial expansion following the Wehrmacht conquests. His clients reaped substantial profits from the economies of a dozen conquered European nations. Between 1939 and 1943 three-quarters of Europe's industrial resources were there for the taking and the Deutsche Bank's own wealth quadrupled as a result of its activities during the Third Reich. By 1942, Abs held 40 directorships, a quarter of which were with firms in lands occupied by German troops. Many of the companies financed by the Deutsche Bank used slave labour and some 6 million Europeans (men, women and children) were used - and often worked to their deaths - in German factories and mines. From 1940 Abs was on the board of directors of IG Farben, which had built a concentration camp adjacent to Auschwitz (called IG Auschwitz by the directors) to produce artificial rubber. Some 50,000 inmates died from starvation and exposure in building it - prisoners at this camp rarely survived more than three months since company policy was to supply a minimal amount of food. The Deutsche Bank was IG Farben's main banker and Abs was its representative on the giant company's supervisory 2\n\nAdam, Wilhelm\n\nAlbers, Hans opponent of Hitler and National Socialism, Adenauer was dismissed from his position in 1933 and arrested a year later by the Gestapo for continued resistance to the régime. A further arrest followed in 1944 when he was sent to Brauweiler prison. After the fall of the Third Reich, Adenauer co-founded the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) and was elected in 1949 as Chancellor of the German Federal Republic, a position he maintained until his retirement, because of advanced age, in 1963. This was the longest tenure in office of any German statesman since Bismarck, coinciding with a long period of prosperity (the 'economic miracle') and political stability which transformed West Germany into an accepted member of the community of nations. At home and abroad, Adenauer's patriarchal style of leadership, his pro-western orientation and impeccable moral credentials strengthened confidence in the new Germany. His policy favoured close ties with France, European economic co-operation and reconciliation with Israel - in a declaration before the Bundestag on 27 September 1951 Adenauer had acknowledged German crimes against the Jews and the obligation to make 'moral and material amends'. Nevertheless many judges, civil servants, businessmen and police officers with a compromised past continued to serve under his administration. Adenauer's greatest achievement during fourteen years of rule was to provide West Germans with the sense of stability and continuity that could reconcile them to democracy in the post-war period. He died at the age of ninety-one in his villa at Röndorf in April 1967.\n\nthe bank had a controlling interest in nearly one-third of West German industry and was the second largest bank in Europe. He was once again part of that small élite of international bankers, one who had made a brilliant career in the Third Reich and a no less spectacular contribution to the post-war Federal Republic. Praised as a patriot, a financial diplomat and patron of the arts (in 1992 he won the State prize for North Rhine Westphalia for his services to the arts), he died at the age of ninety-two, enjoying wealth, power and honours. Adam, Wilhelm (1877-1949) Born in Anspach, Bavaria, on 15 September 1877, Wilhelm Adam served as an officer in the Bavarian army during World War I and subsequently acquired a reputation as one of the most able and efficient officers in the Reichswehr. Promoted to Major General in 1930, he was appointed three years later as Commander of the Munich Military Area. In 1935 he was given command of the newly created Armed Forces Academy in Berlin. Adam's earlier association with General von Schleicher (q.v.) and his lukewarm attitude to Hitler's plans - including the building of the West Wall fortifications - made his relations with the Führer somewhat tense, though he survived the crisis of early 1938 which followed the dismissal of two leading generals, von Blomberg (q.v.) and von Fritsch (q.v.). In November 1938, Wilhelm Adam was stripped of his western front command - another sign of Hitler's success in solidifying his control over the army. He died on 8 April 1949 in Garmisch. Adenauer, Konrad (1876-1967) Born on 5 January 1876 into a Catholic family in Cologne, where he became Deputy Mayor in 1909 and served as Lord Mayor between 1917 and 1933, Adenauer was a member of the republicandemocratic wing of the Centre Party during the Weimar period. A resolute\n\nAlbers, Hans (1892-1960) The blond, daredevil adventurer and irresistible lover of the German screen, Hans Albers was born in Hamburg on 22 September 1892 and began his career as an apprentice in business before turning to acting in the circus and variety.

Their relationship dated back to World War I when Amann had served as Hitler's company sergeant in a Bavarian infantry regiment. During the Beer-Hall putsch, Amann along with other Party activists had been arrested and briefly jailed. In 1924 he was elected as an NSDAP candidate to the Munich city council and in 1933 became a Nazi member of the Reichstag for the electoral district of Upper Bavaria/Swabia. The pint-sized Amann was the aggressive, rowdy type of Nazi, brutal, domineering and ruthless towards subordinates. This 'Hercules of the Nazi publishing business' was in the words of Kurt Lüdecke 'a merciless man who sweated lesser Nazi workers for the least possible pay'. Amann was also personally greedy, exploiting his appointment in November 1933 as President of the Reich Association of German Newspaper Publishers and President of the Reich Press Chamber to pillage and plunder the non-Nazi newspaper chains. As chief actor in the Gleichschaltung of the press he was a master of the techniques of the legal freeze-out and enforced business deal, by means of which he established Party control of most of the press and gradually eliminated independent publishing. Hitler's personal wealth owed a great deal to Amann's shrewd business sense. The jovial Bavarian was his personal banker and, apart from overseeing his royalties from Mein Kampf, ensured that the Führer received huge fees from his contributions to the Nazi press. But his political services which earned him his appointment as a Reichsleiter were no less appreciated. In 1942 Hitler described Amann as 'the greatest newspaper proprietor in the world Today the Zentral Verlag owns from 70 to 80 per cent of the German press.' Amann enormously enriched himself through his monopoly over the world's largest press and publishing combine. His income\n\nduring World War I, Albers was wounded and after the war resumed his acting career in Berlin in operettas, later in plays - first in comic parts, then in character acting. He had outstanding success and started filming, being one of the first actors to appear in talking movies. After 1927 Albers began to establish himself as one of the most prominent film actors and producers in the German cinema. During the Third Reich he was one of the best-loved actors among the public, frequently embodying the spirit of virile heroism, idealism and self-sacrifice in films like Gustav Ucicky's Flüchtinge (1933), set in the Far East among a group of Germans trying to escape Bolshevik persecution, or in Carl Peters (1941), an idealized Nazi version of the anti-British German colonialist and patriot in East Africa. Albers also starred in Fritz Wendhausen's adaptation of Peer Gynt (1934), in Gold (1937) and as the alcoholic engineer-hero in Wasser für Canitoga (1939) - a film set in the Canadian North, one of the better examples of the Nazi commercial cinema. One of Albers's most seductive performances was in the film spectacular, Münchhausen (1943) - for which the screenplay was written by Erich Kastner. After World War II, Albers continued to make films, right up until his death in July 1960. They included Und über uns der Himmel (1947), Der Letzte Mann (1955), Das Herz von St Pauli (1957) and Kein Engel ist so rein (1960). Amann, Max (1891-1957) Born in Munich on 24 November 1891, Amann attended business school and served an office apprenticeship in a Munich law firm before becoming business manager of the Nazi Party in 1921, and after 1922 Director of the Party publishing house, the Eher Verlag. He always enjoyed the full confidence of Hitler, who held him in high regard and unstintedly praised his role in developing the 4\n\nAxmann, Artur\n\nAxmann, Artur increased from 108,000 to 3,800,000 marks between 1934 and 1944; besides his large salary from the Eher Verlag and 5 per cent of the net profits, he owned a substantial interest in the Müller printing company, and was able to pocket millions without paying income tax. As a Party man, Amann's talents were, however, very limited. He was no orator or debater and incapable of writing a single printable line by himself. All articles signed 'Amann', addresses, important letters or announcements were written for him by his righthand man, Rolf Rienhardt (q.v.). After the fall of the Third Reich, Amann sought to pose as a businessman who had no ideological commitment to Nazism. His de-Nazification trial showed, however, that of all the Nazi leaders he had made the greatest material gains from his association with the Party. On 8 September 1948 he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years' imprisonment by a Munich court and two months later the Central de-Nazification Court imposed ten years' labour camp on him as a 'Major Offender'. He lost his property, his business holdings and pension rights, dying in poverty in Munich on 30 March 1957.\n\nOffice of the Reich Youth Leadership. Axmann gained a place for the Hitler Youth in the direction of State vocational training and succeeded in raising the status of Hitler Youth agricultural work. He was on active service on the western front until May 1940. In August of the same year he succeeded Baldur von Schirach (q.v.) as Reich Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. In 1941 he was severely wounded on the eastern front, losing an arm. During Hitler's last days, Axmann was among those present in the Führerbunker, making his escape at the end of April 1945. He was arrested in December 1945 when a Nazi underground was uncovered which he had been organizing. A Nuremberg deNazification court sentenced him in May 1949 to a prison sentence of three years and three months as a 'Major Offender'. Axmann subsequently worked as a sales representative in Gelsenkirchen and Berlin. On 19 August 1958 a West Berlin de-Nazification court fined the former Hitler Youth Leader 35,000 marks (approximately £3,000), about half the value of his property in Berlin. The court found him guilty of indoctrinating German youth with National Socialism right until the end of the Third Reich, but concluded that he had been a Nazi from inner conviction rather than base motives. During his trial Axmann told the court that he had heard the shot with which Hitler committed suicide, and had later also seen the body of Martin Bormann (q.v.) lying on a bridge in Berlin. He was found not guilty of having committed any crimes during the Nazi era.\n\nAxmann, Artur (born 1913) Reich Youth Leader, Artur Axmann was born on 18 February 1913 in Hagen, studied law and by 1928 had founded the first Hitler Youth group in Westphalia. In 1932 he was called into the Reichsleitung of the NSDAP to carry out a reorganization of Nazi youth cells and in 1933 became Chief of the Social\n\n5\n\nB being awarded the Knight's Cross in connection with these operations. Highly regarded by Hitler for his brutality and improvisational skills - he was able to conjure armies out of very unpromising material - Bach-Zelewski ended the war as an army Commander. The fact that he testified for the prosecution at Nuremberg, denouncing Himmler and his own fellow police chiefs, spared him extradition to Russia. In March 1951 he was condemned by a Munich de-Nazification court to ten years' 'special labour', which in practice meant being confined to his own home in Franconia. The only one among the mass murderers who publicly denounced himself for his wartime actions, he was never prosecuted for his role in the antiJewish massacres. Instead, he was arrested and tried in 1961 for his participation in the Röhm Blood Purge and sentenced to four and a half years ; indicted again in 1962 for the murder of six communists in 1933, he was tried before a jury in Nuremberg and received the unusually harsh sentence of life imprisonment. Neither indictment mentioned his wartime role, thereby suggesting that only the murder of ethnic Germans was perceived as an unpardonable crime. He died in a prison hospital in Munich-Harlaching on 8 March 1972.\n\nBach-Zelewski, Erich (1899–1972) General of the Higher SS and Police Leader Corps, responsible for anti-partisan warfare on the eastern front during World War II, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski was born on 1 March 1899 in Lauen burg, Pomerania. A professional soldier from a Junker military family, handsome and typically East Prussian in manner, Bach-Zelewski served in World War I, then in the Freikorps and as a Reichswehr officer during the 1920s. In 1930 he joined the NSDAP and a year later he was made an SS-Untersturmführer. From 1932 until 1944 he was a member of the Reichstag, representing the Breslau electoral district. After 1934 he commanded SS and Gestapo units in East Prussia and Pomerania. In 1939 Bach-Zelewski was promoted to the position of SS General and two years later became a General of the Waffen- SS assigned to the Central Army Group on the Russian front until the end of 1942. In this period Bach-Zelewski was responsible for many atrocities in which he took a personal part. On 31 October 1941, after 35,000 persons had been executed in Riga, he proudly wrote : 'There is not a Jew left in Estonia.' He also participated actively in massacres of Jews at Minsk and Mogilev in White Russia. In July 1943 he was appointed by Himmler (q.v.) as anti-partisan chief on the entire eastern front. Subsequently he claimed that in this role he had tried to protect Jews from the Einsatzgruppen. Bach-Zelewski was in command of the German units which suppressed the Warsaw rising in the summer of 1944,\n\nBacke, Herbert (1896-1947) Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture during the last year of the Nazi régime, Herbert Backe was born on 1 May 1896 in Batum, Russia, the son of German colonists. He attended a Russian secondary school between 1905 and 1914, and was 6\n\nBaeck, Leo\n\nBaeck, Leo serve the most prominent Jewish congregation in Berlin, a position he was to hold for thirty years, Baeck was already well known as a religious philosopher who combined universal scholarship with rabbinical erudition. In 1913 he was appointed lecturer to the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, a liberal rabbinical seminary in Berlin, but spent the next few years in the German army as a chaplain during World War I. In 1922 Rabbi Baeck was elected President of the Allgemeine Rabbiner-Verband (Union of German Rabbis), which represented both progressive and orthodox Jews. He was also active from 1926 as Chairman of the Zentralwohlfahrtsstelle (Welfare Centre for Jewish Communities) in Germany. Baeck established himself in these years as a non-conformist, independent thinker, a rabbi who represented the respectable, bourgeois community yet remained critical of the prevailing mentality. A non-Zionist, he was nonetheless sympathetic to the reawakening of Jewish national consciousness - as a young man of twenty-four, he had been one of only two rabbis who abstained from the declaration of protest by German rabbis against Zionism. An optimist, who believed passionately in the Jewish renaissance, Baeck faced his great ordeal as President of the Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland the central representative body of German Jews from the autumn of 1933 until July 1939 - with dignity and nobility of soul. Immediately after the Nazis seized power, Baeck recognized that 'the thousand-year-old history of German Jewry has come to an end', yet he refused all the attractive offers from abroad which would have enabled him to escape from the Third Reich. In Albert Einstein's (q.v.) words: 'What this man meant to his brethren trapped in Germany and facing certain destruction cannot be fully grasped by those whose outer circumstances permit them\n\ninterned during the period of the war, later resuming his studies at Göttingen University in Germany. Assistant lecturer at Hanover Technical High School (1923-4), Backe then turned to tenant farming. He joined the Nazi Party and became head of the farmers' political organization in his district in 1931. From October 1933 he was State Secretary in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and a year later he launched the socalled Battle of Production {Erzeugungsschlacht) aimed at maximizing domestic output and cutting down on food imports. In 1936 he was made Food Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, responsible to Goering (q.v.) for the coordination of agrarian and industrial policy. Backe was regarded as an expert not only on agrarian but also on Russian affairs, and from May 1942 he was nominated as Darré's (q.v.) successor, responsible in particular for organizing the foodstuffs sector for the war against Soviet Russia. He was promoted to Reich Minister and Reichsbauernführer (Reich Farmers' Leader) at the end of 1943. On 1 April 1944, Backe, whose hard-headed pragmatism and efficiency was increasingly preferred to Darré's ideological 'blood and soil' policies, was appointed Reich Food Minister, serving in Hitler's last cabinet. He died on 6 April 1947, committing suicide by hanging himself at Nuremberg prison. Baeck, Leo (1873-1956) The central figure of German Jewry during the Nazi period, a great rabbinical scholar, teacher and community leader, Leo Baeck was born in Lissa, Prussia, on 23 May 1873. After obtaining his rabbinical qualification at the Berlin Institute in 1897, he served until 1907 as a rabbi in Oppeln (Upper Silesia) where he wrote his magnum opus, Das Wesen des Judentums (The Essence of Judaism) in 1905 - conceived as an answer to the theology of the Protestant Professor Adolf von Harnack. In 1912 when he was called to 7\n\nBaeumler, Alfred\n\nBarkhorn, Erich Gerhard\n\nto live on in apparent security. He felt it an obvious duty to stay and endure in the land of merciless persecution in order to provide spiritual sustenance to his brethren till the end.' Appointed Chairman of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland (1939), Baeck was in constant danger and frequently summoned to the Gestapo, several times arrested, and finally sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943. Here he was named head of the council of elders in the camp, and continued to teach philosophy and theology. After his miraculous salvation in 1945, he came to Britain where he was elected President of the Council of Jews from Germany and Chairman of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. He was also the first President of the Leo Baeck Institute, a body devoted to transmitting the message of German-speaking Jewry to future generations. Leo Baeck has rightly been described as 'the last representative figure of German Jewry in Germany during the Nazi period'. He died in London on 2 November 1956.\n\nwas to transform Nietzsche's thought into a myth at the service of the Nazi world-view by focusing attention on his negation of bourgeois ideology, Christian morality and democratic values. For Baeumler, Nietzsche was 'the philosopher of heroism', of the will to power and the aristocracy of nature, whose activism was synonymous with 'Nordic' and soldierly values. In his Studien zur Deutschen Geistesgeschichte (1937) Baeumler wrote: 'If today we see German youth on the march under the banner of the swastika, we are reminded of Nietzsche's \"untimely meditations\" in which this youth was appealed to for the first time. It is our greatest hope that the state today is wide open for youth. And if today we shout \"Heil Hitler\" to this youth, at the same time we are also hailing Nietzsche.' Among Baeumler's many books on philosophy and politics were Nietzsche der Philosoph und Politiker (1931), Männerbund und Wissenschaft (1934), Politik und Erziehung and Alfred Rosenberg und der Mythus des 20 Jahrhunderts (1943).\n\nBaeumler, Alfred (1887-1968) An ardent nationalist and old Party member who was one of the leading academic apologists of National Socialism, Alfred Baeumler was born on 19 November 1887 in Neustadt, Austria. He received his doctorate in 1914 after studying at the Universities of Munich, Berlin and Bonn. From 1914 to 1917 he served in the Austrian army, obtaining high distinctions. Professor of Philosophy at Dresden High School from 1928, he was appointed Professor of Political Education at Berlin University in 1933, emerging as the chief liaison man between the universities and Alfred Rosenberg's (q.v.) office charged with the ideological education of the Party. In 1942 he was made head of the Science Division in Rosenberg's Ideology Department.

His first posting was in Ostend in 1941 where he was attached to Fighter Group 52 as a First Lieutenant. Promoted to Captain and then to Major within two years, Barkhorn was sent to the Russian front where he managed not only to survive the war but also to down more enemy planes than any other pilot except his fellow-countryman, Erich Hartmann (q.v.) - according to the claims made by the Luftwaffe statisticians. From 1956 to 1975 he served in the Bundeswehr, reaching the position of Brigadier and Chief of Staff of the 2nd Allied Tactical Airfleet. He died on 12 January 1983. 8\n\nBecher, Kurt\n\nBartels, Adolf Bartels, Adolf (1862-1945) German Professor and literary historian who waged a relentless war to eliminate Jews and 'pseudo-Jews' from German literature, Adolf Bartels was born in Wesselburen on 15 November 1862. Himself a well-known völkisch author of historical novels, Bartels edited the literary journal Deutsches Schriftum (German Writings) until 1933, which specialized in anti-semitic research and articles. Bartels was the founder of a new pseudo-science which flourished under the Third Reich, namely the racial evaluation of literature. In his ferreting out of Jewish and crypto-Jewish authors - according to Bartels, writers like Thomas and Heinrich Mann or Hermann Hesse belonged in the latter category - the veteran literary historian relied on tracing family trees, photographs of ancestors as well as authors, on place of birth and of work, language, style, family and social milieu. A Jewish-sounding name, the use of symbols reminiscent of freemasonry, the mere fact of having written for papers and journals like the Berliner Tageblatt or Simplicissimus or having advocated liberal views might be adduced as proof of the 'semitic' character of an author's work. In his early books such as Lessing und die Juden (1918), Die Berechtigung des Antisemitismus (1921), Der Nationalsozialismus-Deutschlands Rettung (1924) - a eulogy of the nascent Nazi movement - and Jüdische Herkunft und Literaturwissenschaft (1925), Bartels gave expression to his uncompromising racial-biological anti-semitism and determination to 'dejudaize' German literature. He died in Weimar on 7 March 1945.\n\n10 May 1886. A little-known Swiss pastor until the publication of his difficult theological work, Der Römerbrief (1918), Barth initiated a revolution in Protestant thought by his relentless attack on liberal 'scientific' theology which sought to bridge the gap between reason and revelation. The founder of a new dialectical theology, Barth wished to take Protestantism back to Luther with his insistence that redemption could only come through God's grace, though he rejected the traditional Lutheran subservience to worldly authority. Barth's religious teaching was simultaneously other-worldly and political in the context of National Socialist attempts to exploit vague metaphysical longings and demands. Barth preached an uncompromising return to absolute, unbroken faith - condemning the corruption of the Protestant church establishment, its German nationalism and concessions to worldly interests. From 1923 to 1933 Barth's journal, Zwischen den Zeiten, expressed the views of avantgarde Protestant theology. He himself held professorships in Germany, first in Göttingen, then in Münster and finally in Bonn. In July 1933, he founded the journal Theologische Existenz heute which strongly opposed the 'German Christians' who supported Hitler. Two years after Hitler's rise to power, Barth was removed from his position at the University of Bonn for refusing to declare an oath of allegiance to the Führer. He returned to the University of Basel, where he continued his academic career and the publication of his multi-volume Kirchliche Dogmatik, one of the central works of modern Protestantism, which was to have a world-wide impact. Barth died in Basel on 10 December 1968.\n\nBarth, Karl (1886-1968) One of the leading Protestant thinkers of the twentieth century and an uncompromising opponent of National Socialism, who was forced to leave Nazi Germany because of his non-conformist attitude, Karl Barth was born in Basel, Switzerland, on\n\nBecher, Kurt (born 1909) An SS-Standartenführer, actively involved in negotiations over the fate of Hungarian Jewry, Becher was born in Hamburg on 12 September 1909. In 1934 he joined the 9\n\nBecher, Kurt\n\nBeck, Ludwig helped in the 'rescue' of Hungarian Jews. Kasztner would pay dearly for this recommendation, being assassinated as a 'collaborator' with the Nazis in Tel Aviv on 4 May 1957. Kasztner would in fact be posthumously cleared of this charge by the Jerusalem High Court, though his trial and the case surrounding it still arouse intense controversy in Israel. Kurt Becher testified in the Eichmann trial in Israel in 1961 (his deposition was made in Germany) although, had he come to the Jewish State, he would himself have had to stand trial as a war criminal. He was able to prosper in his business ventures in the postwar years which included the development of Hungarian agricultural trade with the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nSS equestrian unit and three years later he became a member of the Nazi Party. From September 1939 he was in the SS Death's Head Equestrian Unit I in Poland which participated in executions of Jews in Warsaw and subsequently on the Russian front. As part of the SS Cavalry Brigade in the East, Becher's unit took part in mass shootings of Jews and partisans. For his services, Becher was promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmbannführer. (SS Major). In March 1944, following the German invasion of Hungary, Becher played a key role in establishing SS control of the giant Manfred Weiss armaments firm the largest in the country and owned by a Jewish family. Assigned by Adolf Eichmann (q.v.) to be chief SS negotiator with the Jewish Relief and Rescue Committee of Budapest, he dealt in particular with the Zionist functionary Rudolf Kasztner. Becher arranged (in return for jewellery and valuables worth millions of Swiss francs) for the ransoming of over 1500 Hungarian Jews from BergenBelsen concentration camp to Switzerland. At the same time, on Himmler's instructions, he sought and failed to win Allied acceptance to supply the SS with 10,000 brand new trucks in return for sparing a million Jewish lives. Nevertheless, as part of Himmler's feelers towards a separate peace with the Western Allies, Becher pursued negotiations with the representative of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and with Roswell McCelland of the War Refugee Board, in Switzerland in November 1944. In April 1945 Himmler (q.v.) appointed Becher as Special Reich Commissioner for all concentration camps. After the German surrender, Becher was arrested and acted as a witness at the Nuremberg trials. However, he managed to avoid prosecution as a war criminal thanks to the intervention of Kasztner (by then, living in Israel) on his behalf - who claimed that Becher had\n\nBeck, Ludwig (1880-1944) German General who served as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces between 1935 and 1938, Ludwig Beck was born on 29 June 1880 in Biebrich, in the Rhineland. A professional soldier who entered the General Staff in 1911 and after Service during World War I was given various commands in the Reichswehr, Beck was rapidly promoted and on 1 October 1933 appointed Adjutant General in the Reichswehr Ministry. Beck held this position until his elevation to Chief of the Army General Staff in 1935. For the next three years Beck, who was in charge of overall military planning and preparations, came into increasing conflict with Hitler, opposing war on the grounds that Germany was not yet ready and resenting Nazi efforts to increase Party influence at the expense of the army. Beck, a brilliant officer in the Prussian tradition who believed in a limited war based on moral principles rather than a 'revolutionary' war of conquest with uncontrolled conscript armies, was horrified by Hitler's proposal to invade Czechoslovakia in 1938 and by his adventurous policy based on intuition rather than solid planning. The 10\n\nBenn, Gottfried\n\nBerger, Gottlob\n\nonly German general who consistently did everything possible to thwart or delay Hitler's plans, Beck tried to organize resistance to the Führer within the General Staff, but ultimately failed. When he resigned his post on 18 August 1938, the other generals did not follow suit. Beck's resignation removed the last remaining serious challenge to Hitler's war policy and signalled that the breach between the army and the Party had been resolved in favour of the Nazis. Beck continued, however, to adhere to his conviction that Hitler's policy of conquest would bring disaster to Germany and henceforth, until his suicide on 20 July 1944, he was the acknowledged leader of the German Resistance to Nazism. Had the July plot succeeded, Beck would have been designated as Head of State in place of Hitler. Following the failure of the conspiracy, Beck, knowing that he would be executed, chose suicide and at the third attempt succeeded in blowing his brains out, with the help of a German army sergeant. Benn, Gottfried (1886-1956) Germany's leading expressionist poet and one of the few writers of real stature who supported (if only temporarily) National Socialism, Gottfried Benn was born in Mansfeld on 2 May 1886, the son of a Lutheran pastor. Benn studied theology at Marburg, then embarked on a medical career at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin, serving as a military doctor during World War I and then specializing in venereal and skin diseases. During the 1920s he practised as a physician in Berlin and his medical training doubtless influenced his concern with 'the law of vitality in the age of breeding' and with methods of protecting the German 'race' against decadence caused by interbreeding. Benn's first volume of poems, aptly entitled Morgue, was published in 1912 and reflected his uncompromising pessi-\n\nmism and disillusion with the materialism of Wilhelminian Germany. It was followed by more collections of lyric poetry, short stories, experimental drama and critical, essayistic prose — Gehirne (1916), Das Moderne Ich (1920), Gesammelte Prosa (1927) and Fazit der Perspektiven (1930). Taking his inspiration from Goethe, Nietzsche and Spengler (q.v.), Benn rebelled passionately against the demons of a mechanized world, against the rationalism which was paralysing modern civilization and the political doctrines which derived from it, preaching an aesthetic nihilism and the cult of primitive atavism which initially attracted him to Nazism. Benn's irrationalism, expressed in works like Nach dem Nihilismus (1932), Der neue Staat und die Intellektuellen (1933) or Kunst und Macht (1935), led him to see in National Socialism a genuine renaissance of the German nation but he soon became disillusioned with the results, turning into a critic who was himself attacked by Nazi purists. In 1937 he was expelled from the National Socialist Writers' Association (Reichsschrifttumskammer) and prohibited from publishing any more work. He took refuge in the army, the 'aristocratic form of emigration', as he called it, serving as a medical officer between 1939 and 1945. After the war, Benn was looked on askance for his early allegiance to the Nazis, but by 1949 the atmosphere had cleared enough for him to publish the results of his literary ruminations during the Third Reich. It became clear from his wartime writings that he had modified his vitalistic irrationalism and lost all sympathy with Nazi ideology. Benn now adopted a semi-ascetic, completely apolitical stance towards literature and poetry. In 1951 he received the Georg Büchner Prize. Benn died in Berlin on 7 July 1956. Berger, Gottlob (1895-1975) SS General who was one of Himmler's (q.v.)\n\n11\n\nBest, Werner\n\nBerger, Gottlob foremost experts on racial selection for the SS and on problems concerning its organization and security, Gottlob Berger was born on 16 July 1896 in Gorstetten. A Swabian with many German relatives in South-eastern Europe, Berger was probably the originator of the idea of the Waffen- SS as an international army which would also serve as an instrument for forging together the scattered 'racial' Germans of Axis Europe. A gymnastics instructor and sports champion in his younger days, Berger was appointed SS-Obergruppenführer in 1940 and for the next five years was Himmler's Chief of Staff for the military SS and head of the SS main leadership office (SS-Führungsamtes). As head of the administrative office of the SS [SS-Hauptamt) Berger proved himself a tough and ruthless organizer, and after July 1942 he was Himmler's personal liaison officer with Rosenberg's (q.v.) Reich Ministry for the occupied Eastern Territories, virtually running it at certain periods. In August 1943 Berger was elected a member of the Reichstag for the electoral district of Düsseldorf East. He was also President of the German-Croat Society and of the German-Flemish Study Group, a reflection of his interest in the idea of European union under Nazi auspices. On 31 August 1944 Berger was given command of military operations in Slovakia, in order to 'pacify' the inhabitants - which he did with brutal efficiency - and save the remnants of the puppet State he had helped to create. On 1 October of the same year he was appointed Inspector-General of Prisoners of War while continuing to hold his other positions. After the war, Berger was tried for his role in the murder of European Jewry and condemned on 2 April 1949 by an American tribunal at Nuremberg to twenty-five years' imprisonment. The sentence was commuted to ten years on 31 January 1951, but Berger was released before the end of the year, 12\n\nhaving served six and a half years in prison. He died on 5 January 1975. Best, Werner (1903-89) Senior SS and Nazi Security Police Leader who became Reich Commissioner for occupied Denmark, Werner Best was born on 10 July 1903 in Darmstadt. His parents moved to Dortmund in 1912 and then to Mainz, where Werner Best completed his education. After World War I - his father, a senior postmaster, had fallen in France at the outset of the war in 1914 - Best founded the first local group of the German National Youth League and became active in the Mainz group of the German National People's Party, all before he was twenty. From 1921 to 1925 he studied law at Frankfurt am Main, Freiburg, Giessen and Heidelberg, where he received his doctorate in 1927. During these years he was strongly influenced by the German youth movement with its return to nature, its Germanic myths and völkisch world-view. He was twice imprisoned between the end of 1923 and the spring of 1924 by the French authorities during the nationalist struggle in the Ruhr region. In 1929 he was appointed Gerichtsassessor (judge) in the Hessian Department of Justice, but was forced to resign from his position two years later when the so-called Boxheim documents were found in his possession. (The name came from the Boxheim estate near Worms, where groups of National Socialists had held meetings to discuss a plan for seizing power after a hypothetical communist revolution.) The documents, which bore Best's signature and contained a blueprint for a Nazi putsch and the subsequent execution of political opponents, embarrassed Hitler at a time when he was seeking power by legal means. Nevertheless, Best was made Police Commissioner in Hessen in March 1933 and by July of the same year he was appointed Governor. Best advanced rapidly in the next six\n\nBinding, Rudolf Georg\n\nBest, Werner years, becoming the deputy of Heydrich (q.v.) and Himmler (q.v.), chief legal adviser to the Gestapo (helping it to get rid of 'relics' from the old Weimar legal system and demonstrating how to operate by means of orders for preventive arrests without judicial checks), as well as holding the position of Chief of the Bureau of the Secret State Police at the Reich Ministry of the Interior. The ambitious Best, a cool, amoral technician of power, used his academic and legal skills to justify the totalitarian practice of the Nationalist Socialist Führer State 'which corresponds to the ideological principle of the organically indivisible national community'. The role of the political police was to fight all symptoms of 'disease' in the national organism, 'to discover the enemies of the State, to watch them and render them harmless at the right moment'. As a leading constitutional theoretician and Nazi jurist in the Third Reich, Best did a great deal to give respectability and legitimacy to the political police and the concentration camps. As long as the Gestapo was carrying out the will of the leadership it was, in his view, 'acting legally'. By 1935 Best was already a Standartenführer - during World War II he was promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer and the closest collaborator of Heydrich in building up the Gestapo and the Security Services (SD). Between 27 September 1939 and 12 June 1940 Best was Chief of Section I of the RSHA (Reich Main Security Office) and it was in this capacity that he was charged twenty-five years after the war with complicity in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish intellectuals in occupied Poland. After leaving the RSHA, Best served for the next two years as Chief of the Civil Administration in occupied France, involved in fighting the French Resistance and in the deportation of Jews. The climax of his career came in Denmark, where he was Reich Plenipotentiary from November 1942 to 1945. In spite 13\n\nof his record as a 'desk murderer', there is evidence that in Denmark Best sought to sabotage Himmler's orders concerning the implementation of the 'Final Solution'. Only 477 out of more than 7,000 Danish Jews were finally rounded up by German troops who were forbidden by Best to break into Jewish apartments. Best was originally sentenced to death by a Danish court in 1948 following his extradition, but his sentence was commuted to five years and he was granted a clemency release in August 1951. He returned to West Germany, working for a time in a solicitor's office and then as a lawyer for Stinnes Co., one of the largest German trading concerns. In 1958 he was fined 70,000 marks by a Berlin de-Nazification court for his past activities as a top SS officer. In March 1969 he was held in detention for new investigations concerning responsibility for mass murder, finally charged in February 1972 and released in August of the same year on medical grounds, though the accusations were not withdrawn. One of the most illustrious figures of the Third Reich, the author of a famous book on the police, Die Deutsche Polizei (1941), a free-floating intellectual with a blurred sense of morality who devoted his legal talents to the service of a power-mad clique of criminals, Best's role remains ambiguous, at least in relation to his Danish period. A combination of personal ambition, opportunist careerism and ideological inclinations drove him to the apex of the Nazi system where he helped ensure the smooth functioning of a system of terror. Yet at the end of his National Socialist career it would appear that he belatedly began to revert to that respect for law which he had done so much to destroy from within at an earlier period. Binding, Rudolf Georg (1867-1938) German novelist and poet, born in Basel on 13 August 1867 of wealthy parents (his father, Karl Binding, was an\n\nBlomberg, Werner von\n\nBlaskowitz, Johannes internationally famous jurist), Binding studied at Leipzig and Berlin but did not pursue a professional career, preferring to follow his own inclinations - especially horse-racing and writing. A cavalry Captain in World War I, his autobiographical Aus dem Kriege (1925, Engl. trs. Fatalist at War, 1929), based on diaries written during the war, is a realistic and prophetic work. Binding cultivated the small genre of legends and short stories, Novellen and autobiography, writing much about chivalry, chastity, sacrifice and the manly virtues. A literary self-made man, he was a popular author under the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. In his Antwort eines Deutschen an die Welt (1933) he defended the new Germany against its foreign critics. Binding, who belonged to a small patrician group of neo-classical writers, was a useful apologist for the Nazi régime, but essentially a non-political author. Among his most characteristic works were the highly poetical narrative Reitvorschrift für eine Geliebte (1924), the autobiographical Erlebtes Leben (1928) and the philosophical dialogues, Spiegelgespräche (1933). Blaskowitz, Johannes (1883-1948) Wehrmacht General who worked out the plan of attack for the invasion of Poland and commanded the Eighth Army there, becoming Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Occupation, Johannes Blaskowitz was born in Peterswalde on 10 July 1883. A professional soldier of the old school, who served in World War I, Blaskowitz rose rapidly under the Third Reich. In 1935 he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and Commander of Defence District II, Stettin. In 1938 he was appointed Field Commander of Army Group 3 (Dresden) and took part in the invasion of Austria and Bohemia, leading the Third Army into the Sudetenland in March 1939. In September 1939 he was Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army during the Polish campaign\n\nand was subjected to a severe flank attack at Poznan, requiring additional help from von Reichenau's (q.v.) Tenth Army to drive the Poles back. On 27 September Blaskowitz received the surrender of Warsaw and on 22 October 1939 he was made Military Governor of the German occupying forces in Poland. As Commander-in-Chief, East, Blaskowitz protested at the SS and police bestialities in Poland, complaining that they operated outside the law and that he had no authority over them. He produced two detailed memoranda on their activities and those of the Einsatzkommandos against both Jews and the Polish intellectual élite between November 1939 and February 1940, which were addressed to his Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal von Brauchitsch (q.v.). They documented many instances of raping, horsewhipping, murder and looting of Jewish and Polish shops, warning that the SS 'might later turn against their own people in the same way'. Hitler was reportedly infuriated by Blaskowitz's 'childish attitude' and he was dismissed from several army commands. Nevertheless, he served later on many fronts, never again questioning Hitler's policies. In 1944 he was given command of Army Group G under von Rundstedt (q.v.) which was preparing to defend against the expected Allied invasion in France. Relieved of his command after the defeat in Lorraine, he was transferred to the Netherlands in early 1945, where he surrendered to the British. He committed suicide on 5 February 1948 in Nuremberg prison shortly before his trial as a minor war criminal was due to begin. Fellow prisoners believed that he had been murdered by SS men, but this has never been substantiated. Blomberg, Werner von (1878-1946) German Field Marshal and Minister of War from 1935 to 1938, Werner von Blomberg was born on 2 September 1878 in Stargard, Pomerania. A tall, 14\n\nBlomberg, Werner von\n\nBlunck, Hans Friedrich\n\nimpressive-looking, professional soldier from an officers' family, von Blomberg joined the Reichswehr in 1919, after various staff appointments during World War I. From 1927 to 1929 when he served as head of the Truppenamt (conscription office) at the War Office, von Blomberg frequently visited Soviet Russia and almost became a Bolshevik, during the honeymoon period of collaboration between the Reichswehr and the Red Army. In 1929 von Blomberg was given command of Defence District I in East Prussia and it was in this capacity that he first met Hitler in 1931, who made a great impression on the intelligent, though easily influenced, officer. Von Blomberg was head of the German delegation at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva and then on 1 January 1933 he was appointed Minister of Defence and promoted to General of Infantry. Von Blomberg played a crucial role in Hitler's consolidation of power, during the Röhm (q.v.) putsch and after the death of President von Hindenburg (q.v.). On 29 June 1934 in an article in the Völkische Beobachter he had assured Hitler of the loyalty of the army, and soon after applauded the crushing of the SA, declaring that 'the Wehrmacht, as the sole armed force of the entire nation, while remaining apart from the conflicts of internal politics, will express its gratitude by its devotion and fidelity'. As War Minister, von Blomberg endorsed Hitler's succession to President Hindenburg, swearing the oath of allegiance to the Führer and imposing it on his fellow officers, thereby confirming Hitler's control over the army. In May 1935 he was made Commander-in-Chief of the new Wehrmacht and closely collaborated with Party leaders in planning the military reoccupation of the Rhineland. As a reward for his loyalty, Hitler appointed him the first General Field Marshal of the Wehrmacht in 1936. The steel-helmeted, aristocratic figure of von Blomberg\n\nseemed a guarantee of continuity to the conservative classes, though many of his fellow generals considered him too compliant towards the Nazis. Von Blomberg's downfall came about through a scandal engineered by Goering (q.v.), who coveted his position, and Himmler (q.v.) who was trying to promote the interests of his armed SS formations. The scandal arose through von Blomberg's marriage - he was a widower at the time with grown-up children - on 12 January 1938 to Eva Gruhn, a pretty, young working-girl who turned out to have been a prostitute with a criminal record who had posed for obscene photographs. Both Hitler and Goering had attended the discreet wedding ceremony as witnesses. Almost immediately, ugly rumours began to circulate as to the lady's past and the dossier compiled by the Berlin Chief of Police, von Helldorf (q.v.), was sent on to Goering, who, together with Himmler, exploited the case to bring down their antagonist. Von Blomberg and his wife were ordered to spend a year in exile, leaving for Capri after the Field Marshal's official resignation on 4 February 1938. The fall of von Blomberg, and that of von Fritsch (q.v.) shortly afterwards, allowed Hitler to end any possibility that the armed forces might act independently or even oppose the Nazi régime. Hitler himself took over the office of Defence Minister and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. Von Blomberg died in American detention, a pathetic bedridden old man, on 14 March 1946. Blunck, Hans Friedrich (1888-1961) President of the Reich Chamber of Literature, novelist and poet Hans Friedrich Blunck was born in Altona, Hamburg, on 3 September 1888. Educated at the Universities of Kiel and Heidelberg, Blunck was appointed a government Councillor in 1920, and in 1925 15\n\nBonhoeffer, Dietrich\n\nBlunck, Hans Friedrich\n\nmainly for their unrepentant, callous whitewash of Hitler's Germany.\n\nlegal adviser to the University of Hamburg. His literary work reflected his North German peasant background and strong interest in the folklore of the Baltic and North Sea coastal inhabitants. Historical novels, fairy-tales, prehistorical novels combining Nordic Promethean myths, viking saga and poetry predominated in his work which contained a marked dose of völkisch and National Socialist ideology. His early writings included a story of the Old Gods, Streit mit den Göttern (1925), Kampf der Gesteine (dealing with the Stone Age) and Gewalt über das Feuer (1928) - a collection of fairy-tales, legends and ghost stories. Apart from fairy-tales in the Low German language, poems and ballads, Blunck also wrote a novel about Brazil, Die Weibsmühle (1927), and another about Central America, Land der Vulkane (1929). More notorious were his so-called Führer novels, Hein Hoyer, the story of a fifteenth-century Hanseatic mercenary leader who becomes a national statesman, Volkswende (1930) and König Geiserich (1936), described by the Nazi historian of literature, Professor Nadler, as follows: 'a book about the birth of a nation, a book of Führer and Reich, an epic of a new race and a Germanic Christianity.' Other popular works published during the Third Reich included Die Urvatersage (1934), Deutsche Heldensagen (1938), Die Jägerin (1940) and Sage vom Reich (1941). Blunck fully collaborated with the Nazis, declaring in 1934 that 'an old world has collapsed and we Germans are showing the way to a new form of life. We carry a new belief in man and mankind in our hearts.' President of the Reich Chamber of Literature (1934-5), a member of the Reich Culture Senate and of the Academy of Literature, Blunck was also a recipient of the Goethe Medal. After World War II, he posed as a lamb of innocence. His two-volume memoirs, Unwegsame Zeiten (1952), are notable\n\nBock, Fedor von (1880-1945) General Field Marshal of monarchist sympathies, the prototype of the Prussian officer, Fedor von Bock was born on 3 December 1880 in Küstrin, Brandenburg. The son of an old aristocratic officers' family - his father was a well-known general Bock entered the army in 1898 as a Second Lieutenant and from 1912 to 1919 served as a General Staff officer. During World War I he commanded an infantry battalion and was awarded the coveted Pour le Mérite. Promoted to Major in 1918, Bock spent four years in the Reichswehr Ministry and by 1931 he was a Lieutenant-General. From 1935 to 1938 Bock, by now General of Infantry, was Commander of Army Group 3 (Dresden). In the spring of 1938, Bock led the Eighth Army into Austria. At the outbreak of World War II, he commanded the Army Group North during the invasion of Poland. Bock was then transferred to Army Group B, which he led during the 1940 invasion which operated on the northern flank in Holland, Belgium and France. Following the fall of France, Bock was promoted to General Field Marshal in July 1940. He then commanded the Army Group Centre during the invasion of the Soviet Union (April-December 1941), but was dismissed by Hitler when the offensive against Moscow was halted. Bock was recalled to take command of Army Group South from January to July 1942, only to be permanently retired after the failure to capture Stalingrad. On 4 May 1945 von Bock was killed in an Allied air raid. Bonhoeffer, Dietrich (1906-45) Protestant pastor and theologian who was a leading figure in the German Resistance, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born on 4 February 1906 in Breslau, the son of a wellknown psychiatrist and university profes16\n\nBonhoeffer, Dietrich\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nsor. After studying theology at Tübingen, Berlin and the Union Theological Seminary in New York, Bonhoeffer went to Berlin in 1931 as a lecturer. Following Hitler's rise to power, Bonhoeffer left for London where he preached as a pastor between 1933 and 1935. On his return to Nazi Germany he became a member of the Confessional Church, which asserted that Christianity was incompatible with National Socialism and its racial doctrines. Bonhoeffer not only insisted on the freedom to preach the Gospel, he was ready to risk his life as a Christian in resisting Hitler and in helping Jews to escape. He maintained that 'the church is only a Church, when she exists for those outside herself and proclaimed its 'unconditional obligation towards the victims of every social system, even if they do not belong to the Christian community'. Bonhoeffer kept in constant touch with churches abroad, visiting England in the spring of 1939 where he had talks with Bishop Bell and acted as an agent for the conspiracy against Hitler - and then the United States. During his visit to Sweden in May 1942, Bonhoeffer brought with him concrete proposals from the conspirators, led by General Hans Oster (q.v.), Chief of Staff of the Abwehr, and General Ludwig Beck (q.v.), for peace terms, but these were rejected by the British Foreign Office. Bonhoeffer's contacts and his activities made him a prime suspect for the secret police and security services. After his seminary had been closed down a second time in 1940, he had been forbidden by the Gestapo to speak, preach or publish. On 5 April 1943 he was arrested by the Gestapo, charged with subverting the armed forces and imprisoned. After the failure of the July 1944 plot, Bonhoeffer was sent to Buchenwald and then, finally, to Flossenburg concentration camp where he was executed, together with Admiral Canaris (q.v.) and General Oster, on 9 April\n\n1945. As a theologian, Bonhoeffer's ideas and his discussion of a 'religionless Christianity', reinforced by his own martyrdom, exercised a considerable influence on post-war Protestant thought in Britain and America. Bonhoeffer, Klaus (1901-45) Brother of Dietrich Bonhoeffer (q.v.) and a leader of the Resistance to Hitler, Klaus Bonhoeffer was born in Breslau on 5 January 1901. A lawyer - he was admitted to the bar in 1930 - Bonhoeffer became the legal adviser of Lufthansa, the German civilian air transport company, in 1936. Like his brother, Klaus Bonhoeffer had deep moral objections to National Socialism and worked to overthrow the Third Reich from within, in conjunction with different Resistance groups. Arrested after the failure of the July 1944 plot, he was sentenced to death by the People's Court on 2 February 1945 and shot in Berlin on 23 April as the Russians were storming the city. Bormann, Martin (1900-45?) Head of the Party Chancellery and private secretary of the Führer, who by the end of World War II had become second only to Hitler himself in terms of real political power, Martin Bormann was born in Halberstadt on 17 June 1900. The son of a former Prussian regimental sergeant-major who later became a post-office employee, Bormann dropped out of school to work on a farming estate in Mecklenburg. After serving briefly as a cannoneer in a field artillery regiment at the end of World War I, Bormann subsequently joined the rightist Rossbach Freikorps in Mecklenburg and was connected with the so-called 'Feme' murders. In March 1924 he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment as an accomplice of Rudolf Hoess (q.v.) in the brutal, vengeance murder of Walther Kadow (his former teacher at elementary school), who had supposedly betrayed the proto-Nazi martyr Leo 17\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nSchlageter to the French occupation authorities in the Ruhr. After his release he entered the NSDAP, becoming its regional press officer in Thuringia and then business manager in 1928. From 1928 to 1930 he was attached to the SA Supreme Command and in October 1933 he became a Reichsleiter of the NSDAP. A month later he was elected as a Nazi delegate to the Reichstag. From July 1933 until 1941 Bormann was the Chief of Cabinet in the Office of the Deputy Führer, Rudolf Hess (q.v.), acting as his personal secretary and right-hand man. During this period, the 'model secretary', diligent, adaptable and efficient, began his silent, imperceptible rise to the centre of the power apparatus, slowly acquiring mastery of the bureaucratic mechanism and Hitler's personal trust. He developed and administered the Adolf Hitler Endowment Fund of German industry, a huge fund of 'voluntary' contributions by successful business entrepreneurs to the Führer, which Bormann then reallocated as gifts to almost all the top Party functionaries. In addition to administering Hitler's personal finances, buying the Berghof at Berchtesgaden and running it as well as the whole complex of properties on the Obersalzberg, Bormann acquired the power to control the living standards of Gauleiters and Reichsleiters, not to speak of members of the Führer's intimate circle. Bormann's brutality, coarseness, lack of culture and his apparent insignificance led the Nazi Old Guard to underestimate his silent persistence and ability to make himself indispensable. Rudolf Hess's flight to Britain opened the way for the 'Brown Eminence' to step into his shoes on 12 May 1941 as head of the Parteikanzlei and to gather the reins of the Party into his own hands and steadily undermine all his rivals for power. Until the end of the war, the short, squat Bormann, working in the anonym18\n\nity of his seemingly unimportant office, proved himself a master of intrigue, manipulation and political in-fighting. Always the 'narrow Party man' and a fierce guardian of Nazi orthodoxy (he was an arch-fanatic when it came to racial policy, anti-semitism and the Kirchenkampf [war between the churches]), Bormann strengthened the position of the Party against the Wehrmacht and the SS, and increased his grip on domestic policy. Increasingly he controlled all questions concerning the security of the régime, acts of legislation, appointments and promotions, especially if they concerned Party personnel. He also established espionage in the army, getting younger officers promoted to spy on the political attitudes of their colleagues. He reopened the fight against the Christian churches, declaring in a confidential memo to Gauleiters in 1942 that their power 'must absolutely and finally be broken'. Nazism, based as it was on a 'scientific' world-view, was completely incompatible with Christianity whose influence was regarded by Bormann as a serious obstacle to totalitarian rule. The sharpest anti-cleric in the Nazi leadership (he collected all the files of cases against the clergy that he could lay his hands on), Bormann was the driving force of the Kirchenkampf, which Hitler for tactical reasons had wished to postpone until after the war. Bormann was invariably the advocate of extremely harsh, radical measures when it came to the treatment of Jews, of the conquered eastern peoples or prisoners of war. He signed the decree of 9 October 1942 prescribing that 'the permanent elimination of the Jews from the territories of Greater Germany can no longer be carried out by emigration but by the use of ruthless force in the special camps of the East'. A further decree, signed by Bormann on 1 July 1943, gave Adolf Eichmann (q.v.) absolute powers over Jews, who now came under the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n\nBorn, Max\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nterious and sinister figure in the Third Reich, who signed Hitler's political testament, who acted as the witness to his marriage to Eva Braun (q.v.) and watched his Führer commit suicide in the Chancellery bunker. Ordered by Hitler 'to put the interests of the nation before his own feelings' and to save himself, Bormann left the Führerbunker on 30 April 1945. Accounts of what happened afterwards vary widely. According to Erich Kempka (Hitler's chauffeur), Bormann was killed trying to cross the Russian lines by an anti-tank shell which hit the tank in which they were trying to escape, causing it to burst into flames. Kempka, who was temporarily blinded at the time, claimed nonetheless to have seen Bormann's dead body. Hitler Youth Leader, Artur Axmann (q.v.), on the other hand, believed that Bormann committed suicide and claimed to have seen Bormann's body on 2 May 1945 in the Invalidenstrasse, north of the River Spree in Berlin. Doubts, however, have persisted and numerous sightings of Bormann have been reported, beginning in 1946 when his presence in a North Italian monastery was announced. In the same year, his wife Gerda (a rabid Nazi and daughter of Supreme Party Judge, Walter Buch, q.v.) died of cancer in South Tyrol, though his ten children survived the war. It was then alleged that Bormann had escaped (like other loyal Nazis) via Rome to South America. Rumoured to have settled in Argentina where he was living secretly as a millionaire, allegedly spotted in Brazil and also in Chile, Bormann's traces proved as elusive as the anonymity in which he first rose to power. Having been sentenced to death in absentia at Nuremberg on 1 October 1946, he was formally pronounced dead by a West German court in April 1973 but his precise fate remains unknown.\n\nGestapo. Bormann's memos concerning the Slavs make it clear that he regarded them as a 'Sovietized mass' of subhumans who had no claim to national independence. In a brutal memo of 19 August 1942 he wrote: 'The Slavs are to work for us. In so far as we do not need them, they may die. Slav fertility is not desirable.' By the end of 1942 Bormann was virtually Hitler's deputy and his closest collaborator, showing an uncanny ability to exploit his weaknesses and personal peculiarities in order to increase his own power. Always in attendance on the Führer, taking care of tiresome administrative detail and skilfully steering Hitler into approval of his own schemes, Bormann acquired the inside track for displacing dangerous rivals like Goering (q.v.), Goebbels (q.v.), Speer (q.v.) and even Himmler (q.v.) whose access to the Führer was controlled by him. Bormann exploited his position of trust to build a Chinese wall against reality, in which Hitler could indulge his fantasies and in which more sensible, conciliatory proposals from other members of the Party were screened from him. Bormann reduced everything to simple, administrative formulae that freed Hitler from the burdens of paper work. He drew up his appointments calendar and decided whom he should see and whom he should not. Hitler rewarded these and other services by the trust he placed in Bormann, whom he once called 'my most loyal Party comrade'. He was made executive head of the Volkssturm, the desperate levy en masse of the German civilian population organized as the Allies stood poised to invade the Reich. By now virtually the secret ruler of Germany, Bormann did not cease his Machiavellian bureaucratic intrigues against his rivals. As a result of his machinations Hitler dismissed Goering and Himmler's influence was severely curtailed. It was the indispensable Bormann, the most mys-\n\nBorn, Max (1882-1970) One of the key figures in the development of modern 19\n\nBouhler, Philip\n\nBrack, Victor\n\nphysics and a celebrated refugee from the Third Reich, Max Born was born in Breslau on 12 December 1882. After lecturing at Berlin (1915) and Frankfurt am Main (1919), Born joined the faculty at Göttingen in 1921, where he became Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. In April 1933 he was 'placed on leave' by the Prussian Ministry of Education because of his Jewish descent. Though he did not initially wish to leave Germany, he accepted a post at Cambridge University once it was clear that there was no more future for him at Göttingen. Born's outstanding contribution was in the field of quantum theory - he received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1954 for his work on the statistical foundations of quantum mechanics and his pupils included such famous German physicists as Werner Heisenberg (q.v.) and Wolfgang Pauli. He was an intimate friend of Albert Einstein (q.v.), whose theory of relativity he defended in the early Weimar years against anti-semitic attacks. From 1936 to 1954 Born was Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University. Unlike Einstein, he eventually returned to Germany in his last years. He died on 5 January 1970 at Bad Pyrmont. Bouhler, Philip (1899-1945) Born in Munich on 2 September 1899, the son of a retired colonel, Bouhler rose to become Chief of the Führer's Chancellery and head of the notorious euthanasia programme. After four years in the Royal Bavarian Cadet Corps and service in World War I (during which he was seriously wounded), Bouhler apprenticed with various publishers. In 1922 he abandoned the University of Munich philosophy school to help edit the Völkische Beobachter. From 1925 to 1934 he was Geschäftsführer (business manager) of the NSDAP. In 1933 he became a Reichsleiter of the Nazi Party and was elected member of the Reichstag for the district of Westphalia. In\n\n1934 he was made Police President of Munich and became Hitler's Chief of Chancery, responsible for the preparation of decrees that were never officially published. At the same time Bouhler was also Chief of the Party's Censorship Committee for the Protection of National Socialist Literature and of the Study Group for German History Books and Educational Material. In 1942 he published Napoleon, the Comet-Path of a Genius, which was one of Hitler's favourite bedtime reading books. The soft-faced, bespectacled, mild-spoken Bouhler who 'looked more like an American college-boy than a Gruppenführer of the SS' (Gerald Reitlinger) was one of the shadowiest figures in the National Socialist élite. His office was responsible for the euthanasia institutes which used gas chambers filled with carbon monoxide gas to get rid of the mentally sick - and later for the gassing camps for Jews in Poland. On 16 August 1941 Bouhler was ordered by Hitler to halt the euthanasia programme as a result of public protests. At the end of the war, Bouhler increasingly sought Goering's (q.v.) protection and it was at the latter's headquarters at Zell-am-See in May 1945 that Bouhler and his wife committed suicide shortly before the Americans arrived. Brack, Victor (1904-48) SS Colonel and one of the top officials in the Reich Chancellery who took an active part in the construction of the death camps in Poland during World War II, Victor Brack was born in Haaren on 9 November 1904. After studying economics at Munich, Brack, who was the son of a medical practitioner and friend of Heinrich Himmler (q.v.), became for a time the chauffeur of the future Reichsführer-SS. In 1936 he was appointed head liaison officer with the Department of Health by Philip Bouhler (q.v.), though he had no previous medical experience. Subsequently he rose to\n\n20\n\nBrauchitsch, Walter von\n\nBrauchitsch, Walter von become Bouhler's deputy and Chief of Section II in the Führer's Chancellery with the rank of Oberdienstleiter (approximately equivalent to colonel). Between December 1939 and August 1941 Brack's office, known as T4 in the Reich Chancellery, was responsible, during the 'Euthanasia Action', for disposing of more than 50,000 Germans including the mentally sick, chronically sick and concentration camp prisoners defined as 'unfit for work', 'politically undesirable elements' and Jews. Brack himself personally interviewed and selected personnel for the euthanasia establishments and in March 1941 offered the services of his network of institutes to Himmler, for the purpose of sterilizing 3-4,000 Jews daily in X-ray clinics. Later in 1941 he prepared to set up mobile gassing vans in Riga and Minsk to exterminate Jews 'unsuitable for work'. Subsequently, he was closely involved in the construction of the death camps and the installation of gas chambers in Poland, operated by some of his personnel from the euthanasia institutes. On 20 August 1947 Brack was sentenced to death at the end of the Doctors' Trial, by an American military tribunal, for his part in the euthanasia programme. He was hanged in Landsberg prison on 2 June 1948. Brauchitsch, Walter von (1881-1948) Commander-in-Chief of the German Army from 1938 to 1941, Walter von Brauchitsch was born on 4 October 1881 in Berlin, the descendant of an old Prussian military family. An officer in the Imperial army from 1900, he served on the western front as Captain of Artillery during World War I and was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class). After various staff appointments in the Reichswehr between 1919 and 1928, von Brauchitsch was promoted to Lieutenant-General and Artillery Inspector in 1931 and two years later he was made Commander of the First Division 21\n\nat Königsberg. In 1935 he became Commanding General of the First Army Corps, a year later General of Infantry and in 1937 Commander of the Fourth Army Group, Leipzig. Promoted to General on 4 February 1938, von Brauchitsch was at the same time appointed by Hitler to succeed Werner von Fritsch (q.v.) as Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, a position he held until December 1941. Von Brauchitsch was under a personal obligation to the Führer, who not only persuaded his first wife to agree to a divorce but even paid the divorce settlement costs. A few months later von Brauchitsch was able to marry his second wife, née Charlotte Schmidt, who was a rabid Nazi. It was partly due to her influence that the pliable von Brauchitsch proved so weak and compliant towards Hitler and left top army opponents of the régime like General Ludwig Beck (q.v.) in the lurch. Though aware of the conspiracy and himself sceptical of Hitler's aggressive plans, von Brauchitsch felt constrained by his loyalty oath and he backed the Führer even when his own military instincts dictated the reverse. Thus he supported the annexation of Austria in March 1938, the occupation of Czech frontier areas in October 1938 and the military take-over of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. The successes in the early stages of World War II, with the rapid defeats of Poland, France and the Low Countries, all of which took place under his command, added to his prestige and on 17 July 1940 he was made General Field Marshal. On the other hand these successes, which continued during the campaigns in Yugoslavia, Greece and the early stages of the Russian invasion, made von Brauchitsch even more compliant and incapable of standing up to Hitler. After the first setbacks of the Wehrmacht in the Soviet Union, von Brauchitsch began to lose what little influence he still had and plagued by\n\nBraun, Wernher von\n\nBraun, Eva heart disease he was retired on 19 December 1941. Hitler himself now took over as the Supreme Commander of the Wehrmacht. At the end of the war, von Brauchitsch was arrested on his estate in Schleswig-Holstein and taken to England where he was imprisoned for a time. Subsequently interned by the British in a camp in Münster, together with von Rundstedt (q.v.) and von Manstein (q.v.), he was to have been tried by a British military court in 1949. The practically blind, ailing General died, however, of heart failure in the British military hospital in Hamburg-Barmbeck on 18 October 1948. Braun, Eva (1912-45) Hitler's mistress from 1932 and his wife during the last few hours of his life, Eva Braun was born in Munich, the daughter of a school teacher. Of middle-class Catholic background, she first met Hitler in the studio of his photographer friend, Heinrich Hoffmann (q.v.), in 1929, describing him to her sister, Ilse, as 'a gentleman of a certain age with a funny moustache and carrying a big felt hat'. At that time Eva Braun still worked for Hoffmann as an office assistant, later becoming a photo laboratory worker, helping to process pictures of Hitler. The blonde, fresh-faced, slim, photographer's assistant was an athletic girl, fond of skiing, mountain climbing and gymnastics as well as dancing. After the death of Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece, she became his mistress, living in his Munich flat, in spite of the opposition of her father who disliked the association on political and personal grounds. In 1935, after an abortive suicide attempt, Hitler bought her a villa in a Munich suburb, near to his own home, providing her with a Mercedes and a chauffeur for personal use. In his first will of 2 May 1938 he put her at the top of his personal bequests – in the event of his death she was to receive the equivalent of £600 a year for the rest of her life.\n\nIn 1936 she moved to Hitler's Berghof at Berchtesgaden where she acted as his hostess. Reserved, indifferent to politics and keeping her distance from most of the Führer's intimates, Eva Braun led a completely isolated life in the Führer's Alpine retreat and later in Berlin. They rarely appeared in public together and few Germans even knew of her existence. Even the Führer's closest associates were not certain of the exact nature of their relationship, since Hitler preferred to avoid suggestions of intimacy and was never wholly relaxed in her company. Eva Braun spent most of her time exercising, brooding, reading cheap novelettes, watching romantic films or concerning herself with her own appearance. Her loyalty to Hitler never flagged. After he survived the July 1944 plot she wrote Hitler an emotional letter, ending : 'From our first meeting I swore to follow you anywhere - even unto death - I live only for your love.' In April 1945 she joined Hitler in the Führerbunker, as the Russians closed in on Berlin. She declined to leave in spite of his orders, claiming to others that she was the only person still loyal to him to the bitter end. 'Better that ten thousand others die than he be lost to Germany', she would constantly repeat to friends. On 29 April 1945 Hitler and Eva Braun were finally married. The next day she committed suicide by swallowing poison, two minutes before Hitler took his own life. On Hitler's orders, both bodies were cremated with petrol in the Reich Chancellery garden above the bunker. Her charred corpse was later discovered by the Russians. The rest of Eva Braun's family survived the war. Her mother, Franziska, who lived in an old farmhouse in Ruhpolding, Bavaria, died at the age of ninety-six, in January 1976. Braun, Wernher von (1912-77) German rocket engineer who developed the V-2 (Vergeltungswaffe - reprisal\n\n22\n\nBrecht, Bertolt\n\nBraun, Wernher von\n\ndred of his scientific colleagues. After interrogation in London, he was released and allowed to continue his research in the United States where he became a naturalized American citizen in 1955 and a leading figure in the American space programme. After 1960 he became Director of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, playing a crucial part in the development of the American moon flight programme. He designed the US army's Jupiter rocket, which put the United States back into the space race, and his team pioneered the development of the Redstone, which carried America's first astronaut aloft in 1961. The driving force, the inventor and organizing genius behind the American space programme, he designed and developed the huge Saturn 5 rocket, which opened a new era of space exploration in 1969 when it carried the Apollo astronauts to the surface of the moon. In 1970 he was appointed Deputy Assistant Director for planning at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Wernher von Braun died of cancer in Alexandria, Virginia, on 16 June 1977 at the age of sixty-five. He was described by the Acting Director of NASA as 'a twentieth-century Columbus who pushed back the new frontiers of outer space with efforts that enabled his adopted country to achieve pre-eminence in space exploration'.\n\nweapons) launched against England towards the end of World War II, Wernher von Braun was born in Wirsitz, Prussia, on 23 March 1912. The son of Magnus von Braun, a former Minister of Agriculture under President von Hindenburg (q.v.) and founder of the German Savings Bank, and of a musically talented mother, he developed a strong interest in astronomy and space flight while studying at the Charlottenburg Institute of Technology in Berlin. Engaged in rocket research by the German Army Ordnance Office in October 1932, von Braun was appointed five years later as Technical Director of the immense rocket weapons project at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast. By 1938 he had already developed the prototype of the V-2 - the A-4 rocket, a self-propelled and self-steering apparatus with a range of eleven miles. Von Braun's research in solving problems of guidance, aerodynamics and propulsion was slowed down after 1940 by Hitler's decision to shift men and resources away from rocket research to the Luftwaffe. His pleas for better research facilities were ignored until in 1943 Hitler ordered mass production of the forty-six-footlong V-2 rocket. Resisting Himmler's (q.v.) attempt to take control of the project, von Braun and two of his chief assistants were arrested by the SS on 14 March 1944 and briefly imprisoned on suspicion of concentrating on space travel rather than making war weapons. They were released thanks to the intervention of General Dornberger and Albert Speer (q.v.) with Hitler, and on 8 September 1944 the first V-2 was launched against England. Some 3,600 rockets were fired in the next seven months against English cities until the launching sites were finally captured by Allied forces.

Drafted as a medical orderly in the last year of World War I, Brecht's disillusion found a voice in his first expressionist dramas, performed in 1922, Trommeln in der Nacht, Baal and Im Dickicht der Städte. They exhibited a nihilist, anarchist streak underlying Brecht's anti-bourgeois, anti-establishment attitude and his fascination 23\n\nBreker, Arno\n\nBrecht, Bertolt with violence. His greatest theatrical success, Die Dreigroschenoper (1928), adapted from John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (with music by Kurt Weill, q.v.), was a satire on gangsterism and bourgeois ethics which proved enormously popular with the middle-class public. Other plays such as Mann ist Mann (1927) and Mahagonny (1929) reinforced Brecht's reputation as a witty parodist of bourgeois respectability. After 1926 he began to study Marxism and to espouse a doctrinaire communism that found expression in his chilling play Die Massnahme (The Measures Taken), which anticipated the totalitarian Stalinist mentality of the late thirties.
