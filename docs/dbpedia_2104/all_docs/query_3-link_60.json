        "text": "Georeferencing the historical cadastral map sheets of Hungary\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTimÃ¡r, GÃ¡bor; Biszak, SÃ¡ndor\n\n2010-05-01\n\nIn the historical Hungary, as a part of the Habsburg Empire, the first preserved and systematic cadastral survey was carried out between 1856 and 1859. Interestingly enough, this cadastral mapping, which was called in Hungary as 'Provisional' was surveyed simultaneously with the Stable Cadastre in the Austrian regions of the Empire. By the commission of the State Archives of Hungary, the Hungarian company Arcanum Ltd. scanned over 46,000 cadastral sheets of the Provisional Cadastre, mostly covering the present-day Hungary but also some copies covering parts of the present-day Croatia, Slovakia and Austria. The base ellipsoid was the Zach-Oriani hybrid (a=6376130 m; f=1/310). The fundamental point of the geodetic datum was the eastern pillar of the later destroyed astronomical observatory on the GellÃ©rthegy, Budapest and the abridging Molodensky parameters from this datum to WGS84 are: dX=+1763 m; dY=+282 m; dZ=+568 m. The Cassini projection can be used for GIS integration with a projection center at the GellÃ©rthegy with longitude=19d 3m 5.55s east of Greenwich; latitude=49d 29m 15.97s. The sheets were rectified by the calculated coordinates at the corner points. With the above given projection and datum parameters, the cadastral mosaic, based on the individual sheets and the digitized borders of the administrative units, is presented in any modern coordinate systems in GIS. Using this feature, the product is published as a DVD series by old counties as well as the distribution in the Internet.\n\nGregoriano cadastre (1818-35) from old maps to a GIS of historical landscape data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrazzica, V.; Galletti, F.; Orciani, M.; Colosi, L.; Cartaro, A.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nOur analysis covered specifically an area located along the \"internal Marche ridge\" of the Apennines, in the province of Ancona (Marche Region, Italy). The cartographical working-out for our historical analysis has been conduct drawing up maps originating from the nineteenth century Gregoriano Cadastre (Catasto Gregoriano) maps preserved in the State Archive of Rome, which have been reproduced in digital format, georeferenced and vectorialized. With the creation of a database, it has been possible to add to the maps the information gathered from the property registers concerning crop production and socioeconomic variables, in order to set up a Geographical Information System (G.I.S.). The combination of the database with the digitalized maps has allowed to create an univocal relation between each parcel and the related historical data, obtaining an information system which integrally and completely evidences the original cadastre data as a final result. It was also possible to create a three-dimensional model of the historical landscapes which permits to visualize the cultural diversification of that historical period. The integration in Territorial Information System (S.I.T.) of historical information from Gregoriano Cadastre, of socio-economic analyses concerning business changes and in parallel the study of the transformations of territorial framework, showed to be a very important instrument for the area planning, allowing to identify specific planning approaches not only for urban settlement but also for restoration of variety and complexity of agricultural landscape. The work opens further research in various directions, identifying some pilot areas which test new managerial models, foreseeing simulation of management impacts both on business profitability and landscape configuration. The future development of the project is also the upgrade and evolution of the database, followed by the acquisition of data related to the following historical periods.

A.; Minghini, M.; Zamboni, G.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nCartographic cultural heritage preserved in worldwide archives is often stored in the original paper version only, thus restricting both the chances of utilization and the range of possible users. The Web C.A.R.T.E. system addressed this issue with regard to the precious cadastral maps preserved at the State Archive of Como. Aim of the project was to improve the visibility and accessibility of this heritage using the latest free and open source tools for processing, cataloguing and web publishing the maps. The resulting architecture should therefore assist the State Archive of Como in managing its cartographic contents. After a pre-processing consisting of digitization and georeferencing steps, maps were provided with metadata, compiled according to the current Italian standards and managed through an ad hoc version of the GeoNetwork Opensource geocatalog software. A dedicated MapFish-based webGIS client, with an optimized version also for mobile platforms, was built for maps publication and 2D navigation. A module for 3D visualization of cadastral maps was finally developed using the NASA World Wind Virtual Globe. Thanks to a temporal slidebar, time was also included in the system producing a 4D Graphical User Interface. The overall architecture was totally built with free and open source software and allows a direct and intuitive consultation of historical maps. Besides the notable advantage of keeping original paper maps intact, the system greatly simplifies the work of the State Archive of Como common users and together widens the same range of users thanks to the modernization of map consultation tools.\n\nCadastral Map Assembling Using Generalized Hough Transformation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Fei; Ohyama, Wataru; Wakabayashi, Tetsushi; Kimura, Fumitaka\n\nThere are numerous cadastral maps generated by the past land surveying. The raster digitization of these paper maps is in progress. For effective and efficient use of these maps, we have to assemble the set of maps to make them superimposable on other geographic information in a GIS. The problem can be seen as a complex jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are the cadastral sections extracted from the map. We present an automatic solution to this geographic jigsaw puzzle, based on the generalized Hough transformation that detects the longest common boundary between every piece and its neighbors. The experiments have been conducted using the map of Mie Prefecture, Japan and the French cadastral map. The results of the experiments with the French cadastral maps showed that the proposed method, which consists of a flood filling procedure of internal area and detection and normalization of the north arrow direction, is suitable for assembling the cadastral map. The final goal of the process is to integrate every piece of the puzzle into a national geographic reference frame and database.\n\nHistorical cadastral maps of Budapest: a key to understand the urban hidrology and geology of the city\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTimÃ¡r, G.; MÃ¡dl-SzÅnyi, J.; Biszak, S.; HÃ­dvÃ©gi, V.; GÃ¡bris, Gy.; Pulay, E.; Mindszenty, A.; Medzihradszky, Zs.; IzsÃ¡k, Ã.; RÃ¡cz, T.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe cadastral surveys of Budapest started in 1785 with the core of Pest and its surroundings, the eastern part of the twin cities. Other parts (the later discticts) of the city have been surveyed and high-scale maps of them issued in the first part of the 19th century. Systematic surveys were made and cadastral sheet series were compiled in 1871 and 1872, separately in Buda and Pest (the city parts in the western and eastern bank of the Danube). The scale of these sheets were 1:720. The city has been unified in 1873 and shortly after it a unified cadastral series has been issued in 1878, which was the very first map in Hungary in metric system. Overview cadastral maps in scale of 1:5000 have been issued later in 1895, 1908 and 1937, respectively. The early cadastral maps show the near natural watercourse network of Budapest in striking details. The old creeks were later filled and replaced by the artificial city drainage. Natural pools and contemporary lakes were mapped in the plains of Pest and the old water sources were displayed in detail in the Buda Hills. These datasets to be presented in the poster, are important basic data for the urban geologist. Moreover, in some cases, they provide explanations to hydrological âevents\" occurring in association with the new underground constructions in Budapest.\n\nObject-based image analysis for cadastral mapping using satellite images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohli, D.; Crommelinck, S.; Bennett, R.; Koeva, M.; Lemmen, C.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nCadasters together with land registry form a core ingredient of any land administration system. Cadastral maps comprise of the extent, ownership and value of land which are essential for recording and updating land records. Traditional methods for cadastral surveying and mapping often prove to be labor, cost and time intensive: alternative approaches are thus being researched for creating such maps. With the advent of very high resolution (VHR) imagery, satellite remote sensing offers a tremendous opportunity for (semi)-automation of cadastral boundaries detection. In this paper, we explore the potential of object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach for this purpose by applying two segmentation methods, i.e. MRS (multi-resolution segmentation) and ESP (estimation of scale parameter) to identify visible cadastral boundaries. Results show that a balance between high percentage of completeness and correctness is hard to achieve: a low error of commission often comes with a high error of omission. However, we conclude that the resulting segments/land use polygons can potentially be used as a base for further aggregation into tenure polygons using participatory mapping.\n\nBuilding MapObjects attribute field in cadastral database based on the method of Jackson system development\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Zhu-an; Zhang, Li-ting; Liu, Lu\n\n2009-10-01\n\nESRI's GIS components MapObjects are applied in many cadastral information system because of its miniaturization and flexibility. Some cadastral information was saved in cadastral database directly by MapObjects's Shape file format in this cadastral information system. However, MapObjects didn't provide the function of building attribute field for map layer's attribute data file in cadastral database and user cann't save the result of analysis. This present paper designed and realized the function of building attribute field in MapObjects based on the method of Jackson's system development.\n\nAn integrated approach for updating cadastral maps in Pakistan using satellite remote sensing data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, Zahir; Tuladhar, Arbind; Zevenbergen, Jaap\n\n2012-08-01\n\nUpdating cadastral information is crucial for recording land ownership and property division changes in a timely fashioned manner. In most cases, the existing cadastral maps do not provide up-to-date information on land parcel boundaries. Such a situation demands that all the cadastral data and parcel boundaries information in these maps to be updated in a timely fashion. The existing techniques for acquiring cadastral information are discipline-oriented based on different disciplines such as geodesy, surveying, and photogrammetry. All these techniques require a large number of manpower, time, and cost when they are carried out separately. There is a need to integrate these techniques for acquiring cadastral information to update the existing cadastral data and (re)produce cadastral maps in an efficient manner. To reduce the time and cost involved in cadastral data acquisition, this study develops an integrated approach by integrating global position system (GPS) data, remote sensing (RS) imagery, and existing cadastral maps. For this purpose, the panchromatic image with 0.6 m spatial resolution and the corresponding multi-spectral image with 2.4 m spatial resolution and 3 spectral bands from QuickBird satellite were used. A digital elevation model (DEM) was extracted from SPOT-5 stereopairs and some ground control points (GCPs) were also used for ortho-rectifying the QuickBird images. After ortho-rectifying these images and registering the multi-spectral image to the panchromatic image, fusion between them was attained to get good quality multi-spectral images of these two study areas with 0.6 m spatial resolution. Cadastral parcel boundaries were then identified on QuickBird images of the two study areas via visual interpretation using participatory-GIS (PGIS) technique. The regions of study are the urban and rural areas of Peshawar and Swabi districts in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The results are the creation of updated cadastral maps with a\n\nVisualizing the Quality of Vectur Features - a Proposal for Cadastral Maps\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNavratil, G.; Leopoldseder, V.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA well-known problem of geographical information is the communication of the quality level. It can be either done verbally / numerically or it can be done graphically. The graphical form is especially useful if the quality has a spatial variation because the spatial distribution is visualized as well. The problem of spatial variation of quality is an issue for cadastral maps. Non-experts cannot determine the quality at a specific location. Therefore a visual representation was tested for the Austrian cadastre. A map sheet was redesigned to give some indication of cadastral quality and presented to both experts and non-experts. The paper presents the result of the interviews.\n\nGIS integration of the 1:2880 Stabile cadastre map sheets from Bukovina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrÇciunescu, Vasile; NiÃ¨ÂU, Constantin; TimÃ¡r, GÃ¡bor; Boicu, Alin; Rus, Ioan\n\n2010-05-01\n\nStarting with 1975, the North-West part of the Moldavia Principality was occupied by the Habsburg Monarchy and become known as Duchy of Bukovina. During the 143 years of Austrian rule (1775 - 1918), this territory was the subject of several topographic and cadastral surveys. The paper will focus on the cadastral maps produced under the Stabile cadaster (also known as Franciscan cadastre). In the Habsburg Empire, this cadastral survey was started in 1817, at an order of the Emperor Francis I of Austria, as a base for his land taxation reform. In Bukovina, the land registration system was introduced in 1832. The base maps, known as Katastralmappe or Parzellenplan, were drawn under the 1:2880 scale, using Viennese Klafter (fathom) as length unit (1 Viennese Klafter = 1.89648 meters). Each taxation parish (usually centered on the most important cities/villages) was surveyed and mapped individually. The map sheets were accompanied by several registers (e.g. register of building plots, register of land plots) with informations regarding the cadastral parcels. Today, such documents represent a valuable resource in reconstructing the natural and built environment. The study presents the way this maps can be georeferenced and integrated into modern GIS applications, for precise digitization, spatial analysis and 3D reconstruction. The base of the georeference is the knowledge of the projection and datum parameters of the survey in Bukovina as well as the sheet labeling system.\n\nDatum Transformation of Spatial Data and Application in Cadastre\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKÄ±sa, A.; Erkek, B.; Ekin, L.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nIn Turkey, cadastral works have been started with local-based works in 1924 and speeded up after 1950's by using photogrammetry. Different measurement methods, coordinate systems and scales have been used in these works. As a result of primary cadastral activities two main products are generated; cadastral maps and title deeds. After this, cadastral data live on the maps, by cadastral activities carried out by cadastral offices and title deed data live on the registrations by land registration activities carried out by land registration offices. Up to 2005 different references systems such as local (graphic) and ED50 have been used for Cadastral maps production. 2000's Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (TAKBÄ°S) Project has started as a pilot application by Land Registry and Cadastre (TKGM). After completion of pilot project spreading activities started in 2005 and still has been ongoing. On the other hand The government has taken the decision to finish primary cadastral activities within three years. The primary cadastral activities completed at the end of 2008. And also TKGM has completed metadata portal in 2008. At last, cadastral map updating (renovation) started in 2009 by using digital orthophoto with 30 cm GSD. Today people have great expectations in accomplishing digital cadastral services, they need correct, reliable, easy and quick accessible land register and cadastral survey information. Even such request expressed in INPIRE directive by using ISO 191XX data standards. This means we have great hard work for spatial data conversion, datum and data transformation for map and cadastral data harmonization. This paper presents results of investigation of used cadastral maps and used datums of the TKGM and possible transformation methods of datum and some recommendations for future applications.\n\nCadastral Positioning Accuracy Improvement: a Case Study in Malaysia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHashim, N. M.; Omar, A. H.; Omar, K. M.; Abdullah, N. M.; Yatim, M. H. M.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCadastral map is a parcel-based information which is specifically designed to define the limitation of boundaries. In Malaysia, the cadastral map is under authority of the Department of Surveying and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM). With the growth of spatial based technology especially Geographical Information System (GIS), DSMM decided to modernize and reform its cadastral legacy datasets by generating an accurate digital based representation of cadastral parcels. These legacy databases usually are derived from paper parcel maps known as certified plan. The cadastral modernization will result in the new cadastral database no longer being based on single and static parcel paper maps, but on a global digital map. Despite the strict process of the cadastral modernization, this reform has raised unexpected queries that remain essential to be addressed. The main focus of this study is to review the issues that have been generated by this transition. The transformed cadastral database should be additionally treated to minimize inherent errors and to fit them to the new satellite based coordinate system with high positional accuracy. This review result will be applied as a foundation for investigation to study the systematic and effectiveness method for Positional Accuracy Improvement (PAI) in cadastral database modernization.\n\nTransfer of Technology for Cadastral Mapping in Tajikistan Using High Resolution Satellite Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaczynski, R.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nEuropean Commission funded project entitled: \"Support to the mapping and certification capacity of the Agency of Land Management, Geodesy and Cartography\" in Tajikistan was run by FINNMAP FM-International and Human Dynamics from Nov. 2006 to June 2011. The Agency of Land Management, Geodesy and Cartography is the state agency responsible for development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of state policies on land tenure and land management, including the on-going land reform and registration of land use rights. The specific objective was to support and strengthen the professional capacity of the \"Fazo\" Institute in the field of satellite geodesy, digital photogrammetry, advanced digital satellite image processing of high resolution satellite data and digital cartography. Lectures and on-the-job trainings for the personnel of \"Fazo\" and Agency in satellite geodesy, digital photogrammetry, cartography and the use of high resolution satellite data for cadastral mapping have been organized. Standards and Quality control system for all data and products have been elaborated and implemented in the production line. Technical expertise and trainings in geodesy, photogrammetry and satellite image processing to the World Bank project \"Land Registration and Cadastre System for Sustainable Agriculture\" has also been completed in Tajikistan. The new map projection was chosen and the new unclassified geodetic network has been established for all of the country in which all agricultural parcel boundaries are being mapped. IKONOS, QuickBird and WorldView1 panchromatic data have been used for orthophoto generation. Average accuracy of space triangulation of non-standard (long up to 90km) satellite images of QuickBird Pan and IKONOS Pan on ICPs: RMSEx = 0.5m and RMSEy = 0.5m have been achieved. Accuracy of digital orthophoto map is RMSExy = 1.0m. More then two and half thousands of digital orthophoto map sheets in the scale of 1:5000 with pixel size 0.5m have been produced\n\nA STUDY ON REASONS OF ERRORS OF OLD SURVEY MAPS IN CADASTRAL SYSTEM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYanase, Norihiko\n\nThis paper explicates sources on survey map errors which were made in 19th century. The present cadastral system stands on registers and survey maps which were compiled to change the land taxation system in the Meiji era. Many Japanese may recognize the reasons why poor survey technique by farmers, too long measure to avoid heavy tax, careless official check and other deception made such errors of acreage from several to more than ten percent of area in survey maps. The author would like to maintain that such errors, called nawa-nobi, were lawful in accordance with the then survey regulation because of results to analyze old survey regulations, history of making maps and studies of cadastral system. In addition to, a kind of survey maps' errors should be pointed out a reason why the easy subdivision system which could approve without real survey and disposal of state property with inadequate survey.\n\nHistorical cartographic materials as a source for international and cadastral boundary management in rivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSrebro, Haim\n\n2018-05-01\n\nInternational and cadastral boundaries are important for ensuring stable legal territorial matters. This article deals with the long-term location and management of boundaries in rivers and the depiction of the rivers on cartographic materials. A few countries have agreed that the boundary will not follow changes in the river (like in the Mongolia-China Border Treaty), whereas most agree that the boundary will follow slow, natural and gradual changes in the river (like is stated in the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty). The international boundary under the British Mandate between Palestine and Trans-Jordan in the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers was defined in 1922. The cadastral boundaries were defined in these rivers in the 1930s along the international boundary. For more than 70 years, until the Israel-Jordan 1994 Peace Treaty, the rivers have changed their channels east and westward to distances up to hundreds of meters. During that period the mandatory boundaries in these rivers changed their political status to the armistice lines, the cease-fire lines, and to international boundaries between sovereign states. These lines were usually delineated on topographic maps in the rivers, drawn by cartographers following contemporary map revision. During that entire period the cadastral boundaries were not changed in order to adapt them to the actual position of the rivers and to the delineated international boundaries. Owing to large water works on both rivers, including the construction of dams and diversion channels in order to meet the increasing needs of the population on both sides, the water flow of the rivers decreased dramatically to less than one tenth of the original natural flow. The population today is more than ten times than it used to be under the British Mandate. The changes in the water channels during the last 20 years since the 1994 peace treaty are in the magnitude of 10 meters versus hundreds of meters in the past. In addition, intensive land cultivation\n\nDevelopment of a 3D Underground Cadastral System with Indoor Mapping for As-Built BIM: The Case Study of Gangnam Subway Station in Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Sangmin; Kim, Jeonghyun; Jung, Jaehoon; Heo, Joon\n\n2015-12-09\n\nThe cadastral system provides land ownership information by registering and representing land boundaries on a map. The current cadastral system in Korea, however, focuses mainly on the management of 2D land-surface boundaries. It is not yet possible to provide efficient or reliable land administration, as this 2D system cannot support or manage land information on 3D properties (including architectures and civil infrastructures) for both above-ground and underground facilities. A geometrical model of the 3D parcel, therefore, is required for registration of 3D properties. This paper, considering the role of the cadastral system, proposes a framework for a 3D underground cadastral system that can register various types of 3D underground properties using indoor mapping for as-built Building Information Modeling (BIM). The implementation consists of four phases: (1) geometric modeling of a real underground infrastructure using terrestrial laser scanning data; (2) implementation of as-built BIM based on geometric modeling results; (3) accuracy assessment for created as-built BIM using reference points acquired by total station; and (4) creation of three types of 3D underground cadastral map to represent underground properties. The experimental results, based on indoor mapping for as-built BIM, show that the proposed framework for a 3D underground cadastral system is able to register the rights, responsibilities, and restrictions corresponding to the 3D underground properties. In this way, clearly identifying the underground physical situation enables more reliable and effective decision-making in all aspects of the national land administration system.\n\nDevelopment of a 3D Underground Cadastral System with Indoor Mapping for As-Built BIM: The Case Study of Gangnam Subway Station in Korea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Sangmin; Kim, Jeonghyun; Jung, Jaehoon; Heo, Joon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe cadastral system provides land ownership information by registering and representing land boundaries on a map.

A well-developed Cadastre results in transparency of estates tax system, transparency of data of estate, reduction of action before the courts and effective management of estates and natural sources and environment. Multipurpose Cadastre through gathering of other related data has a vital role in civil, economic and social programs and projects. Iran is being performed Cadastre for many years but success in this program is subject to correct geometric and descriptive data of estates. Since there are various sources of data with different accuracy and precision in Iran, some difficulties and uncertainties are existed in modeling of geometric part of Cadastre such as inconsistency between data in deeds and Cadastral map which cause some troubles in execution of cadastre and result in losing national and natural source, rights of nation. Now there is no uniform and effective technical method for resolving such conflicts. This article describes various aspects of such conflicts in geometric part of cadastre and suggests a solution through some modeling tools of GIS.\n\nSmartkadaster: Observing Beyond Traditional Cadastre Capabilities for Malaysia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIsa, M. N. Bin; Hua, T. C.; Halim, N. Z. Binti Abdul\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe digital age for cadastral surveying started in stages, more than 20 years ago in Malaysia and JUPEM played a vital role in its successful implementation nationwide. One of the key products of cadastral survey is cadastral maps, which provide useful information for any land information system. However, as technology evolved and simplicity is familiarised, better services are anticipated and have affected how cadastral survey information are perceived. A paradigm shift is necessary where enriched cadastral information is required for multiple usage and allow real cadastral information based services to users. On that note, JUPEM is intrigued to develop a system where National Digital Cadastral Database is value added with other geospatial information for a smart and multipurpose environment and clearly be interpreted as a decision making tool with the aids of 3D realistic spatial data, namely SmartKADASTER. The SmartKADASTER is an ongoing project developed by JUPEM with the aim to establish a realistic and SMART cadastral-based spatial analysis platform for an effective planning, decision making, enabling efficiencies and enhancing communication and management to support SMART services towards SMART City enablement in Malaysia. It is developed in phases with the Federal Territory of Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur as the initial project implementation area. This paper provides awareness and insights of the on-going development of the project and how it could benefit potential users and stakeholders.\n\nGIS based Cadastral level Forest Information System using World View-II data in Bir Hisar (Haryana)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMothi Kumar, K. E.; Singh, S.; Attri, P.; Kumar, R.; Kumar, A.; Sarika; Hooda, R. S.; Sapra, R. K.; Garg, V.; Kumar, V.; Nivedita\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIdentification and demarcation of Forest lands on the ground remains a major challenge in Forest administration and management. Cadastral forest mapping deals with forestlands boundary delineation and their associated characterization (forest/non forest). The present study is an application of high resolution World View-II data for digitization of Protected Forest boundary at cadastral level with integration of Records of Right (ROR) data. Cadastral vector data was generated by digitization of spatial data using scanned mussavies in ArcGIS environment. Ortho-images were created from World View-II digital stereo data with Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system with WGS 84 datum. Cadastral vector data of Bir Hisar (Hisar district, Haryana) and adjacent villages was spatially adjusted over ortho-image using ArcGIS software. Edge matching of village boundaries was done with respect to khasra boundaries of individual village. The notified forest grids were identified on ortho-image and grid vector data was extracted from georeferenced cadastral data. Cadastral forest boundary vectors were digitized from ortho-images. Accuracy of cadastral data was checked by comparison of randomly selected geo-coordinates points, tie lines and boundary measurements of randomly selected parcels generated from image data set with that of actual field measurements. Area comparison was done between cadastral map area, the image map area and RoR area. The area covered under Protected Forest was compared with ROR data and within an accuracy of less than 1 % from ROR area was accepted. The methodology presented in this paper is useful to update the cadastral forest maps. The produced GIS databases and large-scale Forest Maps may serve as a data foundation towards a land register of forests. The study introduces the use of very high resolution satellite data to develop a method for cadastral surveying through on - screen digitization in a less time as compared to the old fashioned\n\nThe Graphical Cadastre Problem in Turkey: The Case of Trabzon Province.\n\nPubMed\n\nDemir, Osman; Ãoruhlu, Yakup Emre\n\n2008-09-11\n\nCadastral projects in Turkey have been accelerated in recent years by the involvement of the private sector. These projects aim at completing the country's cadastre, along with producing bases in standards that could be a foundation for Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (LRCIS). It is possible to produce cadastral data with today's technological means. In this context, three dimensional cadastre data can be properly produced, especially in digital cadastre projects with the required point accuracy. Nevertheless this is not enough for LRCIS. The cadastre bases that have been produced so far by different methods with different scales and bases, with or without coordinates, should also be converted into digital form based on National Basic GPS Network of Turkey (NBGN) in required point-location accuracy. As the result of evaluation of graphical cadastre bases produced without coordinates, actual land measurements, and information obtained from sheets and field book data together, it was found out that there are significant base problems in the graphical maps. These bases, comprising 20% of Turkey's cadastre constitutes the most important bottleneck of completing the country's cadastre. In the scope of this paper, the possibilities of converting the field book measurement values of graphic cadastre bases into digital forms in national coordinate system by comparing them with actual land measurements are investigated, along with Turkey's Cadastre and its problems.\n\nThe Graphical Cadastre Problem in Turkey: The Case of Trabzon Province\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDemir, Osman; Ãoruhlu, Yakup Emre\n\n2008-01-01\n\nCadastral projects in Turkey have been accelerated in recent years by the involvement of the private sector.

Capturing data by photogrammetric methods for cadastral purposes necessitates the transformation of data into a computer compatible form. Such input requires the encoding, editing and structuring of data. The research is carried out in two phases, the first is concerned with defining the data modelling schemes and the classification of basic data for a parcel-based land information system together with the photogrammetric methods to be adopted to collect these data. The second deals with data editing and data structuring processes in order to produce \"clean\" information relevant to such a system. Implementation of the proposed system at both the data collection stage and within the data processing stage itself demands a number of flexible criteria to be defined within the methodology. Development of these criteria will include consideration of the cadastral characteristics peculiar to Greece.\n\nCadastral data model established and perfected with 4S technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Beijing; He, Jiang; He, Jianpeng\n\n1998-08-01\n\nConsidering China's social essential system and the actual case of the formation of cadastral information in urban and rural area, and based on the 4S technology and the theory and method of canton's GPS geodetic data bench developed by the authors, we thoroughly research on some correlative technical problems about establishing and perfecting all-level's microcosmic cadastral data model (called model in the following) once again. Such problems as the following are included: cadastral, feature and topographic information and its modality and expressing method, classifying and grading the model, coordinate system to be selected, data basis for the model, the collecting method and digitalization of information, database's structural model, mathematical model and the establishing technology of 3 or more dimensional model, dynamic monitoring of and the development and application of the model. Then, the domestic and overseas application prospect is revealed. It also has the tendency to intrude markets cooperated with 'data bench' technology or RS image maps' all-analysis digital surveying and mapping technology.\n\na Review on Legal Traceability of Gnss Measurements in the Malaysian Cadastral Practice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGill, J.; Shariff, N. S.; Omar, K. M.; Din, A. H. M.; Amin, Z. M.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nAs the dependency on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in surveying has been growing over the years, the need for legal traceability of GNSS measurements has become a significant matter. In Malaysia, with the advent of the Malaysia Real-time Kinematic Network (MyRTKnet), GNSS surveying has revolutionised land survey and mapping. Correspondingly, the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) amended and published standard regulations and guidelines concerning cadastral survey, i.e., Cadastral Survey Regulations 2009, to include GNSS measurements. However, these regulations and guidelines has not comprehensively incorporated legal traceability of GNSS measurements; which is a prerequisite for cadastral surveys as it requires reliable and conclusive evidence for issues such as boundary disputes. The first objective of this paper is to review and discuss the legal traceability of GNSS measurements. Secondly, it will highlight the current practice and issues, i.e., with regard to legal traceability, within the present Malaysian cadastral regulation and guidelines, in relation to the prevalently adopted Network RTK (N-RTK) technique, GNSS instrument calibrations, and reference stations' accuracy. Lastly, a rudimentary best practice guideline for GNSS surveying in cadastral survey for Malaysia is proposed. It is expected that this paper will contribute to the implementation of a best practice guideline, which is inclusive of legal traceability of GNSS measurements, for the Malaysian cadastral practice.\n\nImplementing Natural Resources Cadastral Plan in Pasargadae District of Iran by Using Quick Bird Images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAzhdari, G. H.; Deilami, K.; Firooznia, E.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nNatural Resources are essential for security and sustainable development of each country. Therefore, in order to reach sustainable development, conservation as well as optimum utilization of natural resources, executing of natural resources cadastral plan is necessary and essential. Governments conduct lands management in Iran, so there is a need for comprehensive plan with arranged program for best evaluation. In this research as a pilot, Pasargadae city is opted. Pasargadae region is located in north-east of Shiraz in Fars province with Latitude and longitude of 30Â° 15 Â´ 53 Â° N and 53Â° 13 Â´ 29 Â° E respectively. In order to generate the cadastral maps, Firstly, images from QuickBird satellite with 50-60 centimeters resolution were georeferenced by utilizing ground control points with accurate GPS coordinates. In addition to satellite images, old paper maps with 1:10000 scale in local coordinate system from agriculture ministry in 1963 were digitized according to 1:25000 scale map from army geographical organization with AutoCad software. Beside, paper maps with 1:50000 scale and Google Earth were used to find the changes during time. All the above maps were added to QuickBird images as new layers by using ArcMap software. These maps also were utilized to determine the different land-uses. Thus, by employing ArcMap software lands divide into 2 groups: firstly, lands with official document, which is owned by either natural or legal persons, and secondly national lands under different uses such as forestry, range management and desertification plans. Consequently, the generation of cadastral maps leads to better difference between private and national lands. In addition, producing cadastral maps prevent the destruction and illegal possession of natural lands by individuals.\n\nDeveloping and Testing a 3d Cadastral Data Model a Case Study in Australia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAien, A.; Kalantari, M.; Rajabifard, A.; Williamson, I. P.; Shojaei, D.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nPopulation growth, urbanization and industrialization place more pressure on land use with the need for increased space. To extend the use and functionality of the land, complex infrastructures are being built, both vertically and horizontally, layered and stacked. These three-dimensional (3D) developments affect the interests (Rights, Restrictions, and Responsibilities (RRRs)) attached to the underlying land. A 3D cadastre will assist in managing the effects of 3D development on a particular extent of land. There are many elements that contribute to developing a 3D cadastre, such as existing of 3D property legislations, 3D DBMS, 3D visualization. However, data modelling is one of the most important elements of a successful 3D cadastre. As architectural models of houses and high rise buildings help their users visualize the final product, 3D cadastre data model supports 3D cadastre users to understand the structure or behavior of the system and has a template that guides them to construct and implement the 3D cadastre. Many jurisdictions, organizations and software developers have built their own cadastral data model. Land Administration Domain Model (DIS-ISO 19152, The Netherlands) and ePlan (Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping, Australia) are examples of existing data models. The variation between these data models is the result of different attitudes towards cadastres. However, there is a basic common thread among them all. Current cadastral data models use a 2D land-parcel concept and extend it to support 3D requirements. These data models cannot adequately manage and represent the spatial extent of 3D RRRs. Most of the current cadastral data models have been influenced by a very broad understanding of 3D cadastral concepts because better clarity in what needs to be represented and analysed in the cadastre needs to be established. This paper presents the first version of a 3D Cadastral Data Model (3DCDM_Version 1.0). 3DCDM models both the legal\n\nCadastral Resurvey using High Resolution Satellite Ortho Image - challenges: A case study in Odisha, India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParida, P. K.; Sanabada, M. K.; Tripathi, S.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nAdvancements in satellite sensor technology enabling capturing of geometrically accurate images of earth's surface coupled with DGPS/ETS and GIS technology holds the capability of large scale mapping of land resources at cadastral level. High Resolution Satellite Images depict field bunds distinctly. Thus plot parcels are to be delineated from cloud free ortho-images and obscured/difficult areas are to be surveyed using DGPS and ETS. The vector datasets thus derived through RS/DGPS/ETS survey are to be integrated in GIS environment to generate the base cadastral vector datasets for further settlement/title confirmation activities. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the efficacy of a hybrid methodology employed in Pitambarpur Sasana village under Digapahandi Tahasil of Ganjam district, as a pilot project, particularly in Odisha scenario where the land parcel size is very small. One of the significant observations of the study is matching of Cadastral map area i.e. 315.454 Acres, the image map area i.e. 314.887 Acres and RoR area i.e. 313.815 Acre. It was revealed that 79 % of plots derived by high-tech survey method show acceptable level of accuracy despite the fact that the mode of area measurement by ground and automated method has significant variability. The variations are more in case of Government lands, Temple/Trust lands, Common Property Resources and plots near to river/nalas etc. The study indicates that the adopted technology can be extended to other districts and cadastral resurvey and updating work can be done for larger areas of the country using this methodology.\n\nTeaching and Learning with Online Historical Maps\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBolick, Cheryl Mason\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTeaching social studies with historical maps allows teachers and students not only to examine a historical event or place, but to analyze the story behind the map.

B.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nModern cadastre means to integrate the registration of the real estates with the data of the other related activities such as taxation, mortgage, valuation, land-use, land cover,..etc. In Turkey cadastral technical activities were carried out by General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre until 2005. But then cadastre sustainment services were transferred to private sector according to \"Law on Cadastre\" technical parts of initial cadastre and according to the Law on \"Licensed Engineers of Surveying and Cadastre and Offices\". In this article services of Licensed Offices of Surveying and Cadastre (LOSCs) are presented and the experiences in Adana are shared.\n\nCadastral valuation of land contaminated with radionuclides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRatnikov, A. N.; Sapozhnikov, P. M.; Sanzharova, N. I.; Sviridenko, D. G.; Zhigareva, T. L.; Popova, G. I.; Panov, A. V.; Kozlova, I. Yu.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe methodology and procedure for cadastral valuation of land in the areas contaminated with radionuclides are presented. The efficiency of rehabilitation measures applied to decrease crop contamination to the levels satisfying sanitary-hygienic norms is discussed. The differentiation of cadastral value of radioactively contaminated agricultural lands for the particular farms and land plots is suggested. An example of cadastral valuation of agricultural land contaminated during the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident is given. It is shown that the use of sandy and loamy sandy soddy-podzolic soils with the 137Cs contamination of 37-185 and >185 kBq/m2 for crop growing is unfeasible. The growing of grain crops and potatoes on clay loamy soddy-podzolic soils with the 137Cs contamination of 555-740 kBq/m2 is unprofitable. The maximum cadastral value of radioactively contaminated lands is typical of leached chernozems.\n\nCadastral Audit and Assessments Using Unmanned Aerial Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCunningham, K.; Walker, G.; Stahlke, E.; Wilson, R.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nGround surveys and remote sensing are integral to establishing fair and equitable property valuations necessary for real property taxation. The International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) has embraced aerial and street-view imaging as part of its standards related to property tax assessments and audits. New technologies, including unmanned aerial systems (UAS) paired with imaging sensors, will become more common as local governments work to ensure their cadastre and tax rolls are both accurate and complete. Trends in mapping technology have seen an evolution in platforms from large, expensive manned aircraft to very small, inexpensive UAS. Traditional methods of photogrammetry have also given way to new equipment and sensors: digital cameras, infrared imagers, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) laser scanners, and now synthetic aperture radar (SAR). At the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), we work extensively with unmanned aerial systems equipped with each of these newer sensors. UAF has significant experience flying unmanned systems in the US National Airspace, having begun in 1969 with scientific rockets and expanded to unmanned aircraft in 2003. Ongoing field experience allows UAF to partner effectively with outside organizations to test and develop leading-edge research in UAS and remote sensing. This presentation will discuss our research related to various sensors and payloads for mapping. We will also share our experience with UAS and optical systems for creating some of the first cadastral surveys in rural Alaska.\n\nThe study on dynamic cadastral coding rules based on kinship relationship\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Huan; Liu, Nan; Liu, Renyi; Lu, Jingfeng\n\n2007-06-01\n\nCadastral coding rules are an important supplement to the existing national and local standard specifications for building cadastral database. After analyzing the course of cadastral change, especially the parcel change with the method of object-oriented analysis, a set of dynamic cadastral coding rules based on kinship relationship corresponding to the cadastral change is put forward and a coding format composed of street code, block code, father parcel code, child parcel code and grandchild parcel code is worked out within the county administrative area. The coding rule has been applied to the development of an urban cadastral information system called \"ReGIS\", which is not only able to figure out the cadastral code automatically according to both the type of parcel change and the coding rules, but also capable of checking out whether the code is spatiotemporally unique before the parcel is stored in the database. The system has been used in several cities of Zhejiang Province and got a favorable response. This verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the coding rules to some extent.\n\nCadastre (forest maps) and spatial land uses planning, strategic tool for sustainable development\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrosos, Vasileios C.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe rise in the living standards of the Greeks created, especially since 1970, along with other needs and the need for second or holiday home since 1990 after finding the first house on the outskirts of large urban centers. Trying to find land for the creation of new resorts or new type of permanent residences (maisonettes with or without garden, depending on the financial position of each) had the painful consequence of wasteful and uncontrolled use of land, without a program, without the fundamental rules of land planning and the final creation was usually unsightly buildings. The costs were to pay as usually the forest rural lands. The national spatial planning of land use requires that we know the existing land uses in this country, and based on that we can design and decide their land uses on the future in a rational way. On final practical level, this planning leads to mark the boundaries of specific areas of land that are permitted and may change uses. For this reason, one of the most valuable \"tools\" of that final marking the boundaries is also the forest maps. The paper aims the investigation to determine the modern views on the issues of Cadastre and Land Management with an ulterior view to placing the bases for creating a building plan of an immediate completion of forest maps. Sustainable development as a term denoting a policy of continued economic and social development that does not involve the destruction of the environment and natural resources, but rather guarantees their rational viability.\n\nEffects of Cadastral Boundaries in Agricultural Land on Runoff Generation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, P.; Tripathi, S.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe Gangetic Plain is among the most fertile and highly cultivated regions of the world. It supports a large agrarian population that is rapidly growing since the Green Revolution of 1960s. With increasing population, the average farm size is decreasing. Consequently, the density of cadastral boundaries, which are used for separating individual farm holdings, is increasing. The cadastral boundaries in the Gangetic Plains are typically 25 to 30 cm high and 30 to 60 cm wide. These boundaries segment the flat topography of the region, creating small artificial water storages, the effect of which on the hydrology of the region is not extensively investigated. The objective of this research is to develop a laboratory scale physical model for understanding the effect of cadastral boundaries and resulting artificial storages on runoff generation. Experiments were performed in a hydrological apparatus equipped for simulating rainfall-runoff processes under control conditions. The experiments were carried out for watersheds with no cadastral boundaries, and with cadastral boundaries of varying dimensions and densities. Changes in the observed runoff were used to develop a mathematical model for explaining and predicting the impact of cadastral boundaries on the hydrology of the Gangetic Plains.\n\nAn event-version-based spatio-temporal modeling approach and its application in the cadastral management\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Yangdong; Han, Zhen; Liao, Zhongping\n\n2009-10-01\n\nSpatiality, temporality, legality, accuracy and continuality are characteristic of cadastral information, and the cadastral management demands that the cadastral data should be accurate, integrated and updated timely. It's a good idea to build an effective GIS management system to manage the cadastral data which are characterized by spatiality and temporality. Because no sound spatio-temporal data models have been adopted, however, the spatio-temporal characteristics of cadastral data are not well expressed in the existing cadastral management systems. An event-version-based spatio-temporal modeling approach is first proposed from the angle of event and version. Then with the help of it, an event-version-based spatio-temporal cadastral data model is built to represent spatio-temporal cadastral data. At last, the previous model is used in the design and implementation of a spatio-temporal cadastral management system. The result of the application of the system shows that the event-version-based spatio-temporal data model is very suitable for the representation and organization of cadastral data.\n\nThe possibility of low-budget GNSS equipment using for cadastral work for the Unified State Real Estate Cadastre purposes and transport link\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKosarev, Nikolai; Terentyev, Dmitry; Solnyshkova, Olga; Makarikhina, Inna\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe article considers geodetic methods for determining land plots location during cadastral work. The analysis of technological solutions in coordinates determining of the land plotsâ characteristic points and their areas was carried out. The accuracy of geodetic methods in the cadastral work implementation was assessed. The priority technology was identified, including the use of low-budget GNSS equipment for this very task. The areas values were obtained and root-mean-squares of boundary marks position calculated by means of chosen technology are presented. The estimation and justification of the selected technology for cadastral work is given.\n\nThe further development of legal cadastral domain model of China based on ontology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Weiwei; Du, Qingyun; Zhao, Zhongjun; Guo, Yan; Cheng, Gang\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe cadastral plays a very important role in managing spatial and non-spatial legal real property information. And the legal aspect is the important component of the cadastral. And the success of a cadastral system is not dependent on its legal or technical sophistication, but whether it protects land rights adequately and permits those rights to be traded (where appropriate) efficiently, simply, quickly, securely and at low cost. However, the ambiguity of legal cadastral domain has been the major barrier to data integration and interoperability. This paper intends to optimize the concept model of legal cadastral domain based on the model established in my previous paper which can be a first step towards facilitate the effective interchange of cadastral information and the administration of land use. And the way expressing these conceptions and relationships between them was an object-oriented approach in ontology principles. The outcome of this paper is also a basic but better expression legal cadastral domain model of china.\n\nThe study on the real estate integrated cadastral information system based on shared plots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Huan; Liu, Nan; Liu, Renyi; Huang, Jie\n\n2008-10-01\n\nSolving the problem of the land property right on the shared parcel demands the integration of real estate information into cadastral management. Therefore a new cadastral feature named Shared Plot is introduced. After defining the shared plot clearly and describing its characteristics in detail, the impact resulting from the new feature on the traditional cadastral model composed of three cadastral features - parcels, parcel boundary lines and parcel boundary points is focused on and a four feature cadastral model that makes some amendments to the three feature one is put forward. The new model has been applied to the development of a new generation of real estate integrated cadastral information system, which incorporates real estate attribute and spatial information into cadastral database in addition to cadastral information. The system has been used in several cities of Zhejiang Province and got a favorable response. This verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the model to some extent.\n\nCadastral valuation of lands polluted with radionuclides\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMakarov, O. A.; Tsvetnov, E. V.; Shcheglov, A. I.; Romashkina, A. D.; Ermiyaev, Ya. R.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe major method to correct the cadastral value of land for contamination with radionuclides is to reduce it by the sum of expenses necessary for land remediation and for special measures ensuring the obtaining of agricultural and forestry products satisfying safety norms. Lands contaminated with radionuclides and used in agriculture and forestry are often removed from the system of land taxation. In this case, their cadastral value becomes an excessive element of the state cadaster of real estate. An approach toward cadastral valuation of such lands suggested by the authors assumes the creation of a system of compensation payments as the main source of financing of land rehabilitation and soil conservation measures. An original system of calculation of such payments has been tested for radioactively contaminated lands in Plavsk district of Tula oblast. It is argued that compensation payments for radioactively contaminated agrocenoses should be higher than those for natural cenoses.\n\nInteractive Cadastral Boundary Delineation from Uav Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrommelinck, S.; HÃ¶fle, B.; Koeva, M. N.; Yang, M. Y.; Vosselman, G.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are evolving as an alternative tool to acquire land tenure data. UAVs can capture geospatial data at high quality and resolution in a cost-effective, transparent and flexible manner, from which visible land parcel boundaries, i.e., cadastral boundaries are delineable. This delineation is to no extent automated, even though physical objects automatically retrievable through image analysis methods mark a large portion of cadastral boundaries. This study proposes (i) a methodology that automatically extracts and processes candidate cadastral boundary features from UAV data, and (ii) a procedure for a subsequent interactive delineation. Part (i) consists of two state-of-the-art computer vision methods, namely gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels, as well as a classification part assigning costs to each outline according to local boundary knowledge. Part (ii) allows a user-guided delineation by calculating least-cost paths along previously extracted and weighted lines. The approach is tested on visible road outlines in two UAV datasets from Germany. Results show that all roads can be delineated comprehensively. Compared to manual delineation, the number of clicks per 100 m is reduced by up to 86 %, while obtaining a similar localization quality. The approach shows promising results to reduce the effort of manual delineation that is currently employed for indirect (cadastral) surveying.\n\nUsage of Underground Space for 3D Cadastre Purposes and Related Problems in Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAydin, Cevdet C.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nModern cities have been trying to meet their needs for space by using not only surface structures but also by considering subsurface space use. It is also anticipated that without planning of underground spaces for supporting surface city life in the years and generations to come, there will be serious and unavoidable problems with growing populations. The current Turkish cadastral system, including land right registrations, has been trying to meet users' needs in all aspects since 1924. Today Turkey's national cadastre services are carried out by the General Directorate of Land Titles and Cadastre (TKGM). The Cadastre Law, Number 3402, was approved in 1985 to eliminate problems by gathering all existing cadastral regulations under one law and also to produce 3D cadastral bases to include underground spaces and determine their legal status in Turkey. Although the mandate for 3D cadastre works is described and explained by the laws, until now the bases have been created in 2D and the reality is that legal gaps and deficiencies presently exist in them. In this study, the usage of underground spaces for the current cadastral system in Turkey was briefly evaluated, the concept of 3D cadastral data is examined and the need for using subsurface and 3D cadastre in addition to the traditional 2D register system, related problems and registration are mentioned with specific examples, but without focusing on a specific model.

Easy access to up-to-date records is a very important matter for the individuals and institutions using spatial data infrastructure. The primary objective of the study was to check the current accessibility of cadastral data as well as to verify how current and complete they are. The author started researching this topic in 2007, i.e. from the moment the Team for National Spatial Data Infrastructure developed documentation concerning the standard of publishing cadastral data with the use of the WMS. Since ten years, the author was monitoring the status of cadastral data publishing in various districts as well as participated in data publishing in many districts. In 2017, when only half of the districts published WMS services from cadastral data, the questions arise: why is it so and how to change this unfavourable status? As a result of the tests performed, it was found that the status of publishing cadastral data is still far from perfect. The quality of the offered web services varies and, unfortunately, many services offer poor performance; moreover, there are plenty services that do not operate at all.\n\nStudy on data model of large-scale urban and rural integrated cadastre\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeng, Liangyong; Huang, Quanyi; Gao, Dequan\n\n2008-10-01\n\nUrban and Rural Integrated Cadastre (URIC) has been the subject of great interests for modern cadastre management. It is highly desirable to develop a rational data model for establishing an information system of URIC. In this paper, firstly, the old cadastral management mode in China was introduced, the limitation was analyzed, and the conception of URIC and its development course in China were described. Afterwards, based on the requirements of cadastre management in developed region, the goal of URIC and two key ideas for realizing URIC were proposed. Then, conceptual management mode was studied and a data model of URIC was designed. At last, based on the raw data of land use survey with a scale of 1:1000 and urban conversional cadastral survey with a scale of 1:500 in Jiangyin city, a well-defined information system of URIC was established according to the data model and an uniform management of land use and use right and landownership in urban and rural area was successfully realized. Its feasibility and practicability was well proved.\n\nHistorical Topographic Map Collection bookmark\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFishburn, Kristin A.; Allord, Gregory J.\n\n2017-06-29\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Geospatial Program is scanning published USGS 1:250,000-scale and larger topographic maps printed between 1884, the inception of the topographic mapping program, and 2006. The goal of this project, which began publishing the historical scanned maps in 2011, is to provide a digital repository of USGS topographic maps, available to the public at no cost. For more than 125 years, USGS topographic maps have accurately portrayed the complex geography of the Nation. The USGS is the Nationâs largest producer of printed topographic maps, and prior to 2006, USGS topographic maps were created using traditional cartographic methods and printed using a lithographic printing process. As the USGS continues the release of a new generation of topographic maps (US Topo) in electronic form, the topographic map remains an indispensable tool for government, science, industry, land management planning, and leisure.\n\nBig data; sensor networks and remotely-sensed data for mapping; feature extraction from lidar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTlhabano, Lorato\n\n2018-05-01\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used for mapping in the close range domain, combining aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry and now the emergence of affordable platforms to carry these technologies has opened up new opportunities for mapping and modeling cadastral boundaries. At the current state mainly low cost UAVs fitted with sensors are used in mapping projects with low budgets, the amount of data produced by the UAVs can be enormous hence the need for big data techniques' and concepts. The past couple of years have witnessed the dramatic rise of low-cost UAVs fitted with high tech Lidar sensors and as such the UAVS have now reached a level of practical reliability and professionalism which allow the use of these systems as mapping platforms. UAV based mapping provides not only the required accuracy with respect to cadastral laws and policies as well as requirements for feature extraction from the data sets and maps produced, UAVs are also competitive to other measurement technologies in terms of economic aspects. In the following an overview on how the various technologies of UAVs, big data concepts and lidar sensor technologies can work together to revolutionize cadastral mapping particularly in Africa and as a test case Botswana in particular will be used to investigate these technologies. These technologies can be combined to efficiently provide cadastral mapping in difficult to reach areas and over large areas of land similar to the Land Administration Procedures, Capacity and Systems (LAPCAS) exercise which was recently undertaken by the Botswana government, we will show how the uses of UAVS fitted with lidar sensor and utilizing big data concepts could have reduced not only costs and time for our government but also how UAVS could have provided more detailed cadastral maps.\n\nOld maps in the GIS and Internet environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKÅovÃ¡kovÃ¡, K.; BrÅ¯na, V.; Pacina, J.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nOld maps are moreover used as data layers in GIS environment, both in raster or vector form. By comparing data from several time periods we can identify the main trends in landscape development and its spatial structure. The Laboratory of geoinformatics at Jan Evangelista PurkynÄ University, Czech republic is working on several projects concerned about analysis and visualization of old maps. On the poster are presented results of some of the projects solved at the laboratory.

The HTMC is a digital archive of about 190,000 printed topographic maps published by the USGS from the inception of the topographic mapping program in 1884 until the last paper topographic map using lithographic printing technology was published in 2006. The HTMC provides a comprehensive digital repository of all scales and all editions of USGS printed topographic maps that is easily discovered, browsed, and downloaded by the public at no cost. The HTMC provides ready access to maps that are no longer available for distribution in print. A digital file representing the original paper historical topographic map is produced for each historical map in the HTMC in georeferenced PDF (GeoPDF) format (a portable document format [PDF] with a geospatial extension).\n\nCadastral Database Positional Accuracy Improvement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHashim, N. M.; Omar, A. H.; Ramli, S. N. M.; Omar, K. M.; Din, N.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPositional Accuracy Improvement (PAI) is the refining process of the geometry feature in a geospatial dataset to improve its actual position. This actual position relates to the absolute position in specific coordinate system and the relation to the neighborhood features. With the growth of spatial based technology especially Geographical Information System (GIS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the PAI campaign is inevitable especially to the legacy cadastral database. Integration of legacy dataset and higher accuracy dataset like GNSS observation is a potential solution for improving the legacy dataset. However, by merely integrating both datasets will lead to a distortion of the relative geometry. The improved dataset should be further treated to minimize inherent errors and fitting to the new accurate dataset. The main focus of this study is to describe a method of angular based Least Square Adjustment (LSA) for PAI process of legacy dataset. The existing high accuracy dataset known as National Digital Cadastral Database (NDCDB) is then used as bench mark to validate the results. It was found that the propose technique is highly possible for positional accuracy improvement of legacy spatial datasets.\n\nOntological Standardization for Historical Map Collections: Studying the Greek Borderlines of 1881\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGkadolou, E.; Tomai, E.; Stefanakis, E.; Kritikos, G.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nHistorical maps deliver valuable historical information which is applicable in several domains while they document the spatiotemporal evolution of the geographical entities that are depicted therein. In order to use the historical cartographic information effectively, the maps' semantic documentation becomes a necessity for restoring any semantic ambiguities and structuring the relationship between historical and current geographical space. This paper examines cartographic ontologies as a proposed methodology and presents the first outcomes of the methodology applied for the historical map series Â«Carte de la nouvelle frontiÃ¨re Turco-GrecqueÂ» that sets the borderlines between Greece and Ottoman Empire in 1881. The map entities were modelled and compared to the current ones so as to record the changes in their spatial and thematic attributes and an ontology was developed in ProtÃ©gÃ© OWL Editor 3.4.4 for the attributes that thoroughly define a historical map and the digitised spatial entities. Special focus was given on the Greek borderline and the changes that it caused to other geographic entities.\n\nThe Documentation of Historic Maps of World Heritage Site City Suzhou\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuangwei, Z.\n\n2013-07-01\n\nDocumentation and analysis of historic maps enhance understanding of temporal and spatial interactions between events and the evolution of physical canals upon which they occurred. And the challenge of this work lies on carefully sifting of information through the maps drawn with relative accuracy by traditional cartographical principles before the emergence of scientific survey. This research project focuses on sorting out the evolution of historic city Suzhou in a spatio-temporal view. The investigation was conducted through an in-depth analysis of historic maps. Re-projection of the geographical elements of the city to one single georeference, that is to say a standard map BASE, help acquiring an actual sense of the scale and facilitate the recognition of the city's evolution in clear details. It is an important contribution of this thesis in coordination of variously distorted geographical information contained in nineteen periods span from 1229 to 2013 into a single research resource. Through the work both quantitative and qualitative, a clear vision of the evolution and characteristics of the urban structure of ancient Suzhou is achieved. Meanwhile, in the process of projecting the historical geometrical information onto the topographic map, historical bibliographic and cartographic records is key to the data coordination and readjustment, this inspire as well on the cautious utilization of historical materials from ancient time in the recording, documentation work.\n\nComparative analysis of forest lands cadastral appraisal estimated with regards to wood and food resources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKovyazin, V.; Romanchikov, A.; Pasko, O.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nCadastral appraisal of forest fund is one of the topical challenges of modern natural resource management. The paper delivers comparison of different approaches to cadastral appraisal of forest lands. The authors suggest a uniformed model to compare objectively and choose the most effective use of parcels.\n\nCost Analysis of Spatial Data Production as Part of Business Intelligence Within the Mapping Department\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKisa, A.; Erkek, B.; Ãolak, S.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nBusiness intelligence is becoming an important strategic tool for business management. Companies have invested significant resources in applications for customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), e-commerce, among others, which collect vast amounts of data. Today, these same companies are realizing that no matter how robust their application feature sets are, without an equally robust BI mechanism to make use of the collected data, these applications are ultimately coming up short. They do not provide actionable information to end users nor can they give a global understanding among all the organization's information from the various databases for accounting, CRM, and so on. General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (GDLRC) is the leader organizations in Turkey on the field of mapping-land registry-cadastre. GDLRC has executed spatial based projects on the way National Spatial Data Infrastructure especially from the beginnings of 2000s. such as; Continuously Operating GPS Reference Stations (TUSAGA-Aktif), Geo-Metadata Portal (HBB), Orthophoto-Base Map Production and web services, Completion of Initial Cadastre, Cadastral Renovation Project (TKMP), Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (TAKBIS), Turkish National Spatial Data Infrastructure Project (TNSDI), Ottoman Land Registry Archive Information System (TARBIS). Most of this project has been completed. Some software has been developed within the mentioned project, especially reporting for management level to take decision. In the year of 2010 a new law launched and forced to reorganization of General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre. The new structural changes effected to whole organization, management understanding, carrier understanding so on. Even in mapping department which is spatial data producer, now there is no technician, there is no section; there are new carrier as experts.

Nowadays decisions are being made about the potential data sources for additional data updates and refinement of the BD GIS. Will the data from departmental or other information system administrators serve for this purpose? This paper gives an answer as to whether it is advisable to use \"geodetic mapping\" (the results realized in the process of land consolidation) or \"cadastral mapping\" (the results realized in the process of the renewal of cadastral documentation by new mapping) for additional data updates. In our analysis we focus on the quality parameters at the individual data element level, namely the positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, logical consistency, and data resolution. The results of the analysis are compared with the contents of the Object Class Catalog of BD GIS (OCC), which describes the group of objects managed by BD GIS and defines the data collection methods, types of geometry and its properties.\n\nStandard for the U.S. Geological Survey Historical Topographic Map Collection\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAllord, Gregory J.; Fishburn, Kristin A.; Walter, Jennifer L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis document defines the digital map product of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Historical Topographic Map Collection (HTMC). The HTMC is a digital archive of about 190,000 printed topographic quadrangle maps published by the USGS from the inception of the topographic mapping program in 1884 until the last paper topographic map using lithographic printing technology was published in 2006. The HTMC provides a comprehensive digital repository of all scales and all editions of USGS printed topographic maps that is easily discovered, browsed, and downloaded by the public at no cost. Each printed topographic map is scanned âas isâ and captures the content and condition of each map. The HTMC provides ready access to maps that are no longer available for distribution in print. A new generation of topographic maps called âUS Topoâ was defined in 2009. US Topo maps, though modeled on the legacy 7.5-minute topographic maps, conform to different standards.

This paper aims at developing a cadastral domain model oriented at unified real estate registration of China from the perspective of legal and spatial, which set up the foundation for unified real estate registration, and facilitates the effective interchange of cadastral information and the administration of land use. The legal cadastral model is provided based on the analysis of gap between current model and the demand of unified real estate registration, which implies the restrictions between different rights. Then the new cadastral domain model is constructed based on the legal cadastral domain model and CCDM (van Oosterom et al., 2006), which integrate real estate rights of urban land and rural land. Finally, the model is validated by a prototype system. The results show that the model is applicable for unified real estate registration in China.\n\n1.

NLIS is a web based and centralized system which covers administration of cadastral database all over the country among land departments. Current ongoing NLIS implementation is vital to improve the cadastral system in Mongolia. This study is intended to define existing problems in current Mongolian cadastral system and propose administrative institutional and systematic implementation through NLIS. Once NLIS launches with proposed model of comprehensive cadastral system it will lead to not only economic and sustainable development but also contribute to citizens' satisfaction and lessen the burdensomeness of bureaucracy. Moreover, prevention of land conflicts, especially in metropolitan area as well as gathering land tax and fees. Furthermore after establishment of NLIS, it is advisable that connecting NLIS to other relevant state administrational organizations or institutions that have relevant database system. Connections with other relevant organizations will facilitate not only smooth and productive workflow but also offer reliable and more valuable information by its systemic integration with NLIS.\n\nDeveloping a 3D Road Cadastral System: Comparing Legal Requirements and User Needs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGristina, S.; Ellul, C.; Scianna, A.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nRoad transport has always played an important role in a country's growth and, in order to manage road networks and ensure a high standard of road performance (e.g. durability, efficiency and safety), both public and private road inventories have been implemented using databases and Geographical Information Systems. They enable registering and managing significant amounts of different road information, but to date do not focus on 3D road information, data integration and interoperability. In an increasingly complex 3D urban environment, and in the age of smart cities, however, applications including intelligent transport systems, mobility and traffic management, road maintenance and safety require digital data infrastructures to manage road data: thus new inventories based on integrated 3D road models (queryable, updateable and shareable on line) are required. This paper outlines the first step towards the implementation of 3D GIS-based road inventories. Focusing on the case study of the \"Road Cadastre\" (the Italian road inventory as established by law), it investigates current limitations and required improvements, and also compares the required data structure imposed by cadastral legislation with real road users' needs. The study aims to: a) determine whether 3D GIS would improve road cadastre (for better management of data through the complete life-cycle infrastructure projects); b) define a conceptual model for a 3D road cadastre for Italy (whose general principles may be extended also to other countries).\n\nMAPPING IN MICRONESIA.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nOlsen, Randle W.; Swinnerton, J.R.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe U. S. Geological Survey has recently completed a series of new topographic maps of Micronesia in cooperation with the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Federal agency administering the islands. Monocolor 1:10,000-scale manuscripts were compiled, from which 1:25,000-scale metric quadrangles were derived with symbology consistent with USGS quadrangle mapping. The publication of these new maps coincides with the impending political changes resulting from self-determination referendums held in Micronesia. Local sources have helped considerably with field logistics and resolution of geographic name controversies. Technical aspects of this project included development of tropical feature symbology, location of cadastral subdivisions and associated boundaries and mapping of many outlying coral reefs.\n\nTaxation indices of forest stand as the basis for cadastral valuation of forestlands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKovyazin, V.; Belyaev, V.; Pasko, O.; Romanchikov, A.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nCadastral valuation of forestlands is one of the problems of the modern economy. Valuation procedures depend either on the profitability of timbering or forest areas are not differentiated according to value. The authors propose the procedure based on taxation indices of strata. The most important factors influencing the valuation are determined. The dependence that allows establishing the relative cost of a certain forest area is defined. Knowing the cadastral value of a model area, it is possible to determine the values of all other sites. The evaluation results correlate with the Faustman procedure with slight difference in the absolute value.\n\nGeopan AT@S: a Brokering Based Gateway to Georeferenced Historical Maps for Risk Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPrevitali, M.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nImportance of ancient and historical maps is nowadays recognized in many applications (e.g., urban planning, landscape valorisation and preservation, land changes identification, etc.). In the last years a great effort has been done by different institutions, such as Geographical Institutes, Public Administrations, and collaborative communities, for digitizing and publishing online collections of historical maps. In spite of this variety and availability of data, information overload makes difficult their discovery and management: without knowing the specific repository where the data are stored, it is difficult to find the information required. In addition, problems of interconnection between different data sources and their restricted interoperability may arise. This paper describe a new brokering based gateway developed to assure interoperability between data, in particular georeferenced historical maps and geographic data, gathered from different data providers, with various features and referring to different historical periods. The developed approach is exemplified by a new application named GeoPAN Atl@s that is aimed at linking in Northern Italy area land changes with risk analysis (local seismicity amplification and flooding risk) by using multi-temporal data sources and historic maps.\n\n22.

Many different institutions, such as Geographical Institutes, Public Administrations, collaborative communities (e.g., OSM) and web companies, make available nowadays a large number of maps. Besides this cartography, projects of digitizing, georeferencing and web publication of historical maps have increasingly spread in the recent years. In spite of these variety and availability of data, information overload makes difficult their discovery and management: without knowing the specific repository where the data are stored, it is difficult to find the information required and problems of interconnection between different data sources and their restricted interoperability limit a wide utilization of available geo-data. This paper aims to describe some actions performed to assure interoperability between data, in particular spatial and geographic data, gathered from different data providers, with different features and referring to different historical periods. The article summarizes and exemplifies how, starting from projects of historical map digitizing and Historical GIS implementation, respectively for the Lombardy and for the city of Parma, the interoperability is possible in the framework of the ENERGIC OD project. The European project ENERGIC OD, thanks to a specific component - the virtual hub - based on a brokering framework, copes with the previous listed problems and allows the interoperability between different data sources.\n\nHistorical shoreline mapping (I): improving techniques and reducing positioning errors\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nThieler, E. Robert; Danforth, William W.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA critical need exists among coastal researchers and policy-makers for a precise method to obtain shoreline positions from historical maps and aerial photographs. A number of methods that vary widely in approach and accuracy have been developed to meet this need. None of the existing methods, however, address the entire range of cartographic and photogrammetric techniques required for accurate coastal mapping. Thus, their application to many typical shoreline mapping problems is limited. In addition, no shoreline mapping technique provides an adequate basis for quantifying the many errors inherent in shoreline mapping using maps and air photos. As a result, current assessments of errors in air photo mapping techniques generally (and falsely) assume that errors in shoreline positions are represented by the sum of a series of worst-case assumptions about digitizer operator resolution and ground control accuracy. These assessments also ignore altogether other errors that commonly approach ground distances of 10 m. This paper provides a conceptual and analytical framework for improved methods of extracting geographic data from maps and aerial photographs. We also present a new approach to shoreline mapping using air photos that revises and extends a number of photogrammetric techniques. These techniques include (1) developing spatially and temporally overlapping control networks for large groups of photos; (2) digitizing air photos for use in shoreline mapping; (3) preprocessing digitized photos to remove lens distortion and film deformation effects; (4) simultaneous aerotriangulation of large groups of spatially and temporally overlapping photos; and (5) using a single-ray intersection technique to determine geographic shoreline coordinates and express the horizontal and vertical error associated with a given digitized shoreline. As long as historical maps and air photos are used in studies of shoreline change, there will be a considerable amount of error (on the\n\nMapping America in 1880: The Urban Transition Historical GIS Project\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLogan, John R.; Jindrich, Jason; Shin, Hyoungjin; Zhang, Weiwei\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Urban Transition Historical GIS Project is a new data resource for United States counties and cities that takes advantage of NAPPâs 100% digital transcription of records from the 1880 Census. It has developed several additional resources to make possible analysis of social patterns at the level of individuals and households while also taking into account information about their communities. One key contribution is the creation of historically accurate GIS maps showing the boundaries of enumeration districts in 39 major cities. These materials are now publicly available through a web-based mapping system. Addresses of all households in these cities are also being geocoded, a step that will enable spatial analyses of residential patterns at any geographic scale. Preliminary analyses demonstrate the utility of multiple scales and the ability to combine information about individuals with data about their neighborhoods.

M.; Nugroho, A. P.; Leksono, B. E.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEnergy security has one of its dimensions: Short-term energy security which focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly to sudden changes within the supply-demand balance. Non-energy components (such as land parcel) that comprise an energy system are analysed comprehensively with other component to measure energy security related to energy supply. Multipurpose cadastre which is an integrated land information system containing legal, physical, and cultural is used to evaluate energy (electrical energy) security of land parcel. The fundamental component of multipurpose cadastre used to evaluate energy security is attribute data which is the value of land parcel facilities. Other fundamental components (geographic control data, base map data, cadastral data) are used as position information and provide weight in room (part of land parcel) valuation. High value-room means the room is comfortable and/or used productively by its occupant. The method of valuation is by comparing one facility to other facilities. Facilities included in room valuation are relatively static items (such as chair, desk, and cabinet) except lamps and other electronic devices. The room value and number of electronic devices which consume electrical energy are correlated with each other. Consumption of electrical energy of electronic devices in the room with average value remains constant while consumption in other room needs to be evaluated to save the energy. The result of this research shows that room value correlate weakly with number of electronic device in corresponding room. It shows excess energy consumed in low-value room. Although numbers of electronic devices do not always mean the consumption of electrical energy and there are plenty electronic devices, it is recommended for occupant to be careful in utilizing electronic devices in low-value room to minimize energy consumption.\n\nMapping of traditional settlements by unmanned airborne vehicles towards architectural restoration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPartsinevelos, Panagiotis; Skoutelis, Nikolaos; Tripolitsiotis, Achilleas; Tsatsarounos, Stelios; Tsitonaki, Anna; Zervos, Panagiotis\n\n2015-06-01\n\nConservation and restoration of traditional settlements are amongst the actions that international directives proclaim in order to protect our cultural heritage.
