            "there is correspondence in (RGO 14/29:214r) from John Dykes of London and Edinburgh in 1815 and 1816. He describes a new instrument for finding latitude. However",

            "and errors in chronometers. For example",
            "James Kirkwood of London proposed (RGO 14/41:20) to 'regulate the time for finding the Longitude'. He also sought to find latitude by observations of celestial altitudes. He objected to public speeches in the wake of the Longitude Act of (RGO 14/1:79r)",

            "and others like James Burns of London saying (RGO 14/41:60) that an improvement would be useful but perhaps not vital. The letters regard 23 correspondents",
