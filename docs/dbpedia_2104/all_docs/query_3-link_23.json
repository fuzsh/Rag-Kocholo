The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in August in Helgoland\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in August in HelgolandAug112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJulSepNowNowcoolcomfortablecold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nMetlakatla, Alaska, United States (4,547 miles away) and Tofino, British Columbia, Canada (4,814 miles) are the far-away foreign places with temperatures most similar to Helgoland (view comparison).\n\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nCompare Helgoland to another city:\n\nClouds\n\nThe month of August in Helgoland experiences essentially constant cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy remaining about 49% throughout the month.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is August 1, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 53% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on December 30, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 71%, while on July 21, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 54%.\n\nCloud Cover Categories in August in Helgoland\n\n0% clear 20% mostly clear 40% partly cloudy 60% mostly cloudy 80% overcast 100%\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Helgoland, the chance of a wet day over the course of August is increasing, starting the month at 30% and ending it at 35%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 39% on November 3, and its lowest chance is 19% on April 23.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during August in Helgoland is gradually increasing, starting the month at 2.0 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.0 inches or falls below 0.6 inches, and ending the month at 2.4 inches, when it rarely exceeds 4.1 inches or falls below 0.9 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of August in Helgoland, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 59 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 3 minutes, 59 seconds, and weekly decrease of 27 minutes, 51 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is August 31, with 13 hours, 46 minutes of daylight and the longest day is August 1, with 15 hours, 45 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Helgoland is 5:41 AM on August 1 and the latest sunrise is 54 minutes later at 6:35 AM on August 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 9:26 PM on August 1 and the earliest sunset is 1 hour, 6 minutes earlier at 8:20 PM on August 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Helgoland during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during August, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:54 AM and sets 17 hours, 11 minutes later, at 10:05 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:46 AM and sets 7 hours, 20 minutes later, at 4:06 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in August in Helgoland\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in August in HelgolandAug112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJulSep0010102020203030404050000101020203030304050NowNow\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for August 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in August in Helgoland\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in August in HelgolandAug112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMJulSepJul 612:58 AMJul 612:58 AMJul 2112:18 PMJul 2112:18 PMAug 41:14 PMAug 41:14 PMAug 198:26 PMAug 198:26 PMSep 33:56 AMSep 33:56 AMSep 184:35 AMSep 184:35 AM3:32 AM3:32 AM10:37 PM10:37 PM10:01 PM10:01 PM4:30 AM4:30 AM5:04 AM5:04 AM9:53 PM9:53 PM9:07 PM9:07 PM6:45 AM6:45 AM6:45 AM6:45 AM8:29 PM8:29 PM7:35 PM7:35 PM7:19 AM7:19 AMNowNow\n\nAug 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 10%1:24 AMNE8:35 PMNW-11:00 AMS240,178 mi 2 4%2:26 AMNE9:13 PMNW-11:56 AMS242,407 mi 3 1%3:42 AMNE9:37 PMNW-12:48 PMS244,571 mi 4 0%5:04 AMNE9:53 PMNW-1:37 PMS246,617 mi 5 1%6:25 AMENE10:04 PMWNW-2:22 PMS248,466 mi 6 4%7:44 AMENE10:13 PMWNW-3:04 PMS250,018 mi 7 9%8:59 AMENE10:19 PMW-3:43 PMS251,160 mi 8 15%10:12 AME10:26 PMW-4:22 PMS251,769 mi 9 23%11:25 AME10:32 PMWSW-5:00 PMS251,734 mi 10 31%12:38 PMESE10:40 PMWSW-5:40 PMS250,967 mi 11 41%1:54 PMESE10:50 PMWSW-6:22 PMS249,420 mi 12 50%3:13 PMSE11:03 PMSW-7:08 PMS247,101 mi 13 61%4:34 PMSE11:23 PMSW-7:59 PMS244,087 mi 14 71%5:54 PMSE11:55 PMSW-8:54 PMS240,532 mi 15 81%7:03 PMSE--9:54 PMS236,671 mi 16 89%-12:45 AMSW7:55 PMSE10:57 PMS232,812 mi 17 95%-1:58 AMSW8:30 PMSE11:59 PMS229,300 mi 18 97%-3:29 AMSW8:52 PMSE-- 19 100%-5:06 AMSW9:07 PMESE12:59 AMS226,472 mi 20 100%-6:45 AMWSW9:18 PMESE1:55 AMS224,597 mi 21 98%-8:21 AMW9:28 PME2:47 AMS223,830 mi 22 92%-9:55 AMW9:37 PME3:38 AMS224,190 mi 23 85%-11:29 AMWNW9:47 PMENE4:27 AMS225,567 mi 24 75%-1:03 PMWNW9:59 PMENE5:17 AMS227,754 mi 25 64%-2:38 PMNW10:16 PMNE6:09 AMS230,494 mi 26 50%-4:09 PMNW10:41 PMNE7:03 AMS233,524 mi 27 41%-5:30 PMNW11:20 PMNE7:59 AMS236,615 mi 28 30%-6:33 PMNW-8:55 AMS239,592 mi 29 21%12:16 AMNE7:16 PMNW-9:51 AMS242,341 mi 30 13%1:28 AMNE7:44 PMNW-10:45 AMS244,798 mi 31 7%2:49 AMNE8:01 PMNW-11:34 AMS246,939 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Helgoland is essentially constant during August, remaining around 1% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 9, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on September 28, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Helgoland is increasing during August, increasing from 13.4 miles per hour to 15.3 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 5, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 19.8 miles per hour, while on May 29, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.8 miles per hour.\n\nThe lowest daily average wind speed during August is 13.3 miles per hour on August 3.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Helgoland throughout August is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 45% on August 14.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nHelgoland is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Helgoland is essentially constant during August, remaining within 1Â°F of 64Â°F throughout.\n\nThe highest average surface water temperature during August is 64Â°F on August 13.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Helgoland typically lasts for 9.0 months (274 days), from around March 11 to around December 11, rarely starting before February 2 or after April 14, and rarely ending before November 11 or after January 5.\n\nThe month of August in Helgoland is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in August in Helgoland\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Helgoland are increasing during August, increasing by 383Â°F, from 755Â°F to 1,138Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Helgoland is decreasing during August, falling by 1.5 kWh, from 5.7 kWh to 4.2 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Helgoland are 54.181 deg latitude, 7.886 deg longitude, and 125 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Helgoland contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 167 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (177 feet). Within 50 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (256 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Helgoland is covered by water (96%), within 10 miles by water (100%), and within 50 miles by water (83%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Helgoland, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Helgoland.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Helgoland according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Helgoland is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Helgoland and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSea-Airport Cuxhaven/Nordholz (ETMN, 25%, 42 mi, southeast, -52 ft elevation change)\n\nWittmundhaven (ETNT, 23%, 45 mi, south, -102 ft elevation change)\n\nJever (ETNJ, 23%, 45 mi, south, -102 ft elevation change)\n\nWesterland / Sylt (EDXW, 17%, 54 mi, north, -75 ft elevation change)\n\nEggebek (ETME, 13%, 66 mi, northeast, -59 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Helgoland and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
