The Reply of Botswana is submitted in accordance with the Order of the Court of 27\n\nFebruary 1998, fixing 27 November 1998 as the time-limit for the filing of a Reply by each of\n\nthe Parties. The filing of further written pleadings had been requested by the Parties in a joint\n\nletter dated 16 February 1998.\n\n2. Whilst the Government of Botswana was prepared to agree to the filing of a third pleading\n\nin a spirit of co-operation consonant with the terms of the Special Agreement, it considers that\n\nthe role of the present Reply is essentially subsidiary to the previous pleadings submitted by\n\nBotswana.\n\n3. In presenting this response to the Namibian Counter-Memorial the Government of\n\nBotswana finds it necessary to correct a serious misrepresentation of fact in the Namibian\n\npleading. The relevant passage is as follows:\n\n\"If, as Botswana suggests, a major reason behind the rules about navigability is to ensure that\n\nboth riparian states have access to the economic benefits of the river then clearly the southern\n\nchannel is the navigable channel. Since 1991, when Botswana armed forces unilaterally\n\noccupied the Island, boats from the resort lodges in Namibia have been prevented from using\n\nthe southern channel, which, as shown above, is the optimal channel for tourism. The\n\nprohibition has been enforced by armed Botswana boats patrolling in both the northern and\n\nthe southern channel. As a result the economic prospects of the Namibian lodges have been\n\nlimited, and the growth of the tourist industry along the northern bank of the river has been\n\nseriously inhibited. On the other hand, neither Namibia nor its predecessors has prevented\n\nBotswana from using the northern channel. It is Botswana's position that deprives Namibia of\n\naccess to the benefits of the Chobe 'in relation to the needs of the regional economy', not the\n\nreverse.\"(emphasis supplied) (Namibian Counter-Memorial (p. 21, para. 48)\n\n4. This unfounded complaint, that tourist boats are being denied access by Botswana's armed\n\nforces, is repeated in a later passage of the Counter-Memorial (page 37, para. 74).\n\n5. The Government of Botswana is bound to point out that these assertions lack any basis in\n\nfact. There is no policy of preventing tourist boats from Namibia from using the southern\n\nchannel. The accusation of the use of \"armed Botswana boats patrolling\" is groundless. Since\n\n1993 BDF patrol boats in the vicinity have not had guns in their mountings. The boundary\n\nzone has been peaceful and the Defence and Security Communitee of the Defence Forces has\n\nmaintained close co-operation to avoid friction.\n\n6. Cross-border incidents involving the Defence Forces of the two States have been few in\n\nnumber and there is a history of successful co-operation between the Defence Forces. A\n\nProtocol of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of Namibia and the\n\nGovernment of the Republic of Botswana was signed on 26 July 1990 (Botswana Counter-Memorial, Annex 41), and this instrument established a Joint Commission for Defence and\n\nSecurity. There is also a Joint Committee of the Defence Forces of the two States.\n\n7. It is necessary to recall that at Kasane in 1992 the Heads of State of Namibia and Botswana\n\n\"resolved that\" :\n\n(i) each government shall politically and administratively impress upon their people to reduce\n\ntension between their two countries;\n\n(ii) the situation on the Island should not be seen as one of tension;\n\n(iii) existing social interaction between the people of Namibia and Botswana should continue;\n\n(iv) the economic activities such as fishing shall continue on the understanding that fishing\n\nnets should not be laid across the river;\n\n(v) navigation should remain unimpeded including free movement of tourists;\n\n(vi) military presence on the Island should be lessened except for the purpose of anti-poaching\n\nactivities.\n\n__________\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe Scope of the Question Submitted to the Court\n\n(A) The Nature of the Dispute: The Determination of the Boundary around\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island\n\n8. In Chapter I of the Namibian Counter-Memorial the Government of Namibia revisits the\n\nissue of the scope of the dispute and contends that the language of the Special Agreement\n\nallows the Court to decide the dispute on the basis of \"the rules and principles of international\n\nlaw concerning acquiescence, recognition and prescription\" (Counter-Memorial, p. 5, para.\n\n13).\n\n9. This assertion is in response to Chapter I of the Botswana Memorial and the Government of\n\nBotswana reaffirms the reasons and conclusions contained therein. In particular in Chapter I,\n\nthe Government of Botswana argued that the character of the dispute is directly reflected in\n\nthe provisions of the Special Agreement.\n\n10. The request to the Court in Article I is as follows:\n\n\"The Court is asked to determine, on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1 July 1890\n\nand the rules and principles of international law, the boundary between Namibia and\n\nBotswana around Kasikili/Sedudu Island and the legal status of the island.\"11. The provisions of Article I are to be understood in the light of the first two paragraphs of\n\nthe preamble:\n\n\"Whereas a Treaty between Great Britain and Germany respecting the spheres of influence of\n\nthe two countries in Africa was signed on 1 July 1890 (the Anglo-German Agreement of\n\n1890);\n\nWhereas a dispute exists between the Republic of Botswana and the Republic of Namibia\n\nrelative to the boundary around Kasikili/Sedudu Island;....\"\n\ntogether with the fourth:\n\n\"Whereas the two countries appointed on 24 May 1992 a Joint Team of Technical Experts on\n\nthe Boundary between Botswana and Namibia around Kasikili/Sedudu Island \"to determine\n\nthe boundary between Namibia and Botswana around Kasikili/ Sedudu Island\" on the basis of\n\nthe Treaty of 1 July 1890 between Great Britain and Germany respecting the spheres of\n\ninfluence of the two countries in Africa and the applicable principles of international law;...\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n12. The preamble of the Special Agreement, and the provisions of Article I thereof, point\n\nunequivocally to the character of the dispute as a boundary dispute.\n\n(B) The Dispute Concerns the Interpretation and Application of the Terms of Article\n\nIII(2)\n\nof the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890\n\n13. The centrality of the Anglo-German Agreement to the settlement of the dispute is\n\nconfirmed by the language of the Memorandum of Understanding concluded by Botswana\n\nand Namibia in 1992: see the Botswana Memorial, pp. 5-8. It is also confirmed decisively by\n\nthe language of the three Heads of State in the Kasane Communiqué of 24 May 1992. The\n\nrelevant paragraphs are as follows:\n\n\"Their Excellencies President Sam Nujoma of Namibia and Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana\n\nmet in Kasane, on 24 May, 1992 in the presence of His Excellency President Robert G.\n\nMugabe of Zimbabwe to discuss the boundary between Botswana and Namibia around\n\nSedudu/Kasikili Island. After the arrival of President Mugabe and President Nujoma, the three\n\nPresidents went on a tour of the Chobe River and viewed Sedudu/Kasikili Island, after which\n\nthey examined various documents defining the boundary around the Island. These included\n\nthe 1890 Anglo-German Treaty, the 1892 Anglo-German-Portuguese Treaty and Maps. The\n\ntwo treaties define the Botswana-Namibia boundary along the Chobe River as the middle of\n\nthe main channel of that river.\"\n\n\"The three Presidents after a frank discussion, decided that the issue should be resolved\n\npeacefully. To this end they agreed that the boundary between Botswana and Namibia around\n\nSedudu/Kasikili Island should be a subject of investigation by a joint team of six (6) technical\n\nexperts - three from each country to determine where the boundary lies in terms of the Treaty.\n\nThe team should meet within three (3) to four (4) weeks. The team shall submit its findings to\n\nthe three Presidents. The Presidents agreed that the findings of the team of technical experts\n\nshall be final and binding on Botswana and Namibia.\" (emphasis supplied) (Botswana\n\nMemorial, Vol. III, Annex 55)14. If there is some level of ambiguity in the language of the Special Agreement it is\n\nreasonable, and in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation, to construe the\n\nSpecial Agreement in the light of the two related instruments, that is to say, the Kasane\n\nCommuniqué and the Memorandum of Understanding (which defined the mandate of the\n\nJoint Team of Technical Experts). It is to be recalled that the Kasane Communiqué of 24 May\n\n1992 was the result of the sudden re-emergence of the dispute when, on 6 March 1992, a\n\nNamibian official requested a meeting with the District Commissioner at Kasane, Mr. S.T.\n\nMayane (Botswana Counter-Memorial, Vol. III, Annex 43).\n\n15. The causal sequence between the Kasane Communiqué and the Special Agreement is\n\nclearly established. The final preambular paragraph of the Memorandum of Understanding\n\nreads:\n\n\"NOW THEREFORE, the Republic of Botswana and the Republic of Namibia, pursuant to\n\nthe Kasane Meeting of 24 May 1992 ... have agreed as follows:...\"\n\n16. And the preamble to the Special Agreement records the diplomatic history with great\n\nclarity:\n\n\"Whereas a Treaty between Great Britain and Germany respecting the spheres of influence of\n\nthe two countries in Africa was signed on 1 July 1890 (the Anglo-German Agreement of\n\n1890);\n\nWhereas a dispute exists between the Republic of Botswana and the Republic of Namibia\n\nrelative to the boundary around Kasikili/Sedudu Island;\n\nWhereas the two countries are desirous of settling such dispute by peaceful means in\n\naccordance with the principles of both the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of\n\nthe Organization of African Unity;\n\nWhereas the two countries appointed on 24 May 1992 a Joint Team of Technical Experts of\n\nthe Boundary between Botswana and Namibia around Kasikili/Sedudu Island \"to determine\n\nthe boundary between Namibia and Botswana around Kasikili/ Sedudu Island\" on the basis of\n\nthe Treaty of 1 July 1890 between Great Britain and Germany respecting the spheres of\n\ninfluence of the two countries in Africa and the applicable principles of international law;\n\nWhereas the Joint Team of Technical Experts was unable to reach a conclusion on the\n\nquestion referred to it and recommended \"recourse to the peaceful settlement of the dispute on\n\nthe basis of the applicable rules and principles of international law\";\n\nWhereas at the Summit Meeting held in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 15 February 1995, and\n\nattended by Their Excellencies President Sir Ketumile Masire of Botswana, President Sam\n\nNujoma of Namibia and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the Heads of State of the\n\nRepublic of Botswana and the Republic of Namibia, acting on behalf of their respective\n\nGovernments, agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice for a final and\n\nbinding determination;\n\nNow therefore the Republic of Botswana and the Republic of Namibia have concluded the\n\nfollowing Special Agreement ...\" (emphasis supplied)17. As the Court will appreciate, the sequence of the three instruments, the Kasane\n\nCommuniqué, the Memorandum of Understanding, and the Special Agreement, occupies a\n\nperiod of less than four years. Moreover, it is both significant and also understandable that the\n\npreamble to the Special Agreement should refer to the Summit Meeting held in Harare on 15\n\nFebruary 1995 where the Heads of State of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe agreed to\n\nsubmit \"the dispute\" to the Court. The Heads of State were, of course, the same Heads of\n\nState who had agreed to the terms of the Kasane Communiqué of 1992, which refers to the\n\nrole of the joint team of technical experts \"to determine where the boundary lies in terms of\n\nthe Treaty\".\n\n18. The Communiqué of the Summit Meeting held in Harare confirms the causal link between\n\nthe reference of the dispute to the Court and the earlier decisions of the Heads of State. The\n\nrelevant paragraphs of the Harare Communiqué make this absolutely clear:\n\n\"2. The purpose of the Summit was to receive and consider a report of the Joint Team of\n\nTechnical Experts on the boundary between Botswana and Namibia around Kasikili/Sedudu\n\nIsland.\n\n3. The Co-Chairmen formally presented their report to the Heads of State and reported that\n\nthey had failed to reach a common agreement as mandated by the Heads of State in the\n\nKasane Communiqué and the Memorandum of Understanding.\n\n4. However, they recommended to the Summit that the dispute be resolved peacefully in\n\nterms of international law and be referred to international arbitration.\n\n5. After deliberating on the report the Presidents of Botswana and Namibia accepted this\n\nrecommendation and further agreed that the matter should be referred to the International\n\nCourt of Justice.\n\n6. The Summit noted that the process of taking the issue to international arbitration had been\n\nreached amicably and should not mar the excellent bilateral relations that exist between the\n\ntwo parties to the dispute.\" (emphasis supplied) (Botswana Memorial, Vol. III, Annex 59)\n\n19. It is thus evident that \"the dispute\", \"the matter\", and \"the issue\", being referred to the\n\nCourt are seen by the Heads of State as identical to the dispute to which the Kasane\n\nCommuniqué and the Memorandum of Understanding had referred. And that dispute related\n\nexclusively to the interpretation of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890.\n\n(C) The Language of Article 1 of the Special Agreement\n\n20. The Namibian Counter-Memorial plays down the significance of the Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding and makes no reference to the Kasane Communiqué. According to Namibia\n\neverything turns upon the language of Article 1 of the Special Agreement, in which the Court\n\nis asked:\n\n\"to determine, on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1 July 1890 and the rules and\n\nprinciples of international law, the boundary between Namibia and Botswana around\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island and the legal status of the island.\"21. In the contention of Namibia, the words \"and the rules and principles of international law\"\n\nunequivocally establish that the dispute referred to the Court is not limited to the\n\ninterpretation of the Treaty. The position of Botswana is criticised on the ground that this\n\ncontravenes the principle that \"an interpretation is not admissible which would make a\n\nprovision meaningless, or ineffective\". (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 7, para. 16, quoting\n\nOppenheim's International Law).\n\n22. Is it true that Botswana's interpretation would involve such a solecism? The answer is in\n\nthe negative for several reasons. The first is that the invocation of the principles of\n\nacquiescence, recognition and prescription (which is what this is all about) would indeed\n\nproduce a contravention of the principle deployed by Namibia. If prescription were to be\n\napplicable then the provisions of the Anglo-German Agreement would become completely\n\nand utterly redundant. Even if it be accepted that the reference to \"the rules and principles of\n\ninternational law\" is rather puzzling, there is no sound reason for resolving the puzzle by\n\nignoring the Anglo-German Agreement.\n\n23. Whilst the problem under examination does not fall specifically within the doctrine or\n\npresumption expressio unius est exclusio alterius, it should attract the broader principle\n\naccording to which special words have a more decisive role than general words. It is contrary\n\nto common sense to presume that the general reference to \"the rules and principles of\n\ninternational law\" should prevail over the reference to a specific international agreement\n\nwhich defines the boundary in question. This approach would lead to an unreasonable and\n\nabsurd result.\n\n24. The interpretation insisted upon by Namibia is also contradicted by a whole series of other\n\nprinciples of treaty interpretation. Thus:\n\n(i) The meaning of a term is to be determined \"not in the abstract but in its context\":\n\nOppenheim's International Law, 9th ed., Vol. 1, by Jennings and Watts, p. 1273. As\n\nOppenheim's International Law stipulates (ibid.):\n\n\"For this purpose the context of a treaty includes not only its text, preamble, and annexes, but\n\nalso any agreement relating to the treaty and made between all the parties in connection with\n\nthe conclusion of the treaty ...\"\n\nIn the context both of the Special Agreement as a whole and of the series of related\n\nagreements, including the Kasane Communiqué and the Memorandum of Understanding, the\n\ndispute concerns the interpretation and application of the Anglo-German Agreement.\n\n(ii) The meaning of a term is to be determined in the light of the object and purpose of the\n\ntreaty: Oppenheim's International Law, 9th ed., Vol. 1, p. 1273. The preamble to the Special\n\nAgreement emphasises the connection with the Memorandum of Understanding and the fact\n\nthat the purpose of the Special Agreement is to ensure the settling of the dispute which the\n\nJoint Team of Technical Experts (created by the Memorandum of Understanding) had failed\n\nto resolve. The Communiqué of the Summit Meeting held in Harare in 1995 confirms that this\n\nwas the precise purpose of the reference to the Court.\n\n(iii) As Oppenheim's International Law observes:\"The circumstances of a treaty's conclusion may be invoked to ascertain its meaning, since a\n\ntreaty is not concluded as an isolated act but as part of a continuing series of international acts\n\nwhich shape and limit the circumstances with which the treaty deals.\" (9th ed., Vol. 1, p.\n\n1278)\n\nThis principle of common sense applies very appropriately to the sequence of transactions\n\nconstituted by the Kasane Communiqué (1992), the Memorandum of Understanding (1992),\n\nthe Communiqué of the Harare Summit Meeting (1995), and the Special Agreement (1996).\n\n(D) Prescription is the Complete Antithesis of the Application of a Valid Treaty\n\n25. Whatever the persuasiveness or otherwise of the position of Namibia relating to the scope\n\nof the Special Agreement, it does not lack ambition. If the Namibian Government is correct,\n\nthe Special Agreement authorises the Court to decide this case without any reference to the\n\nprovisions of the Anglo-German Agreement. In such a scenario the following conditions\n\nwould be present:\n\n(i) The clearly expressed expectations of the Heads of State as recorded in the Kasane\n\nCommuniqué and the Memorandum of Understanding would have been set aside.\n\n(ii) The preamble to the Special Agreement would have been ignored.\n\n(iii) The words \"on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1st July 1890\" in Article 1 of the\n\nSpecial Agreement would have been ignored completely.\n\n(iv) The words \"and the rules and principles of international law\" would have been treated as\n\noverriding the reference to the Anglo-German Agreement rather than as subsidiary to it.\n\n26. The whole point of prescription is that it replaces the originally lawful status quo. It is the\n\nperfect antithesis of the application of a valid international agreement which, for boundary\n\npurposes, is what the Anglo-German Agreement consists of.\n\n(E) The Mandate of the Court to Determine \"The Legal Status of the Island\"\n\n27. The provisions of Article 1 of the Special Agreement also ask the Court \"to determine ...\n\nthe legal status of the island\". The natural assumption would be that this formulation simply\n\nreflects the fact that, once the Court has determined \"the boundary between Namibia and\n\nBotswana around Kasikili/Sedudu Island\", the legal status of the Island would be determined\n\nby operation of law.\n\n28. In the Counter-Memorial of Namibia there is a suggestion that this is not necessarily the\n\ncase. In the view of the Namibian Government:\n\n\"Moreover, the Court is asked to determine not only the location of the boundary between\n\nNamibia and Botswana at Kasikili Island, but also 'the legal status of the island'. In this\n\nrespect, the wording of the question here is to be contrasted with the language of the question\n\nsubmitted in the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, which requested the Court 'to determine\n\nwhether the sovereignty over the islets and rocks ... belongs to the United Kingdom or the\n\nFrench Republic' without more. In the present case, the question, by asking generally for a\n\ndetermination of 'the legal status of the island', permits the Court to declare any legal rightsin the Island, whether or not treaty-based, as they may emerge from the evidence in the light\n\nof the submissions of the parties.\" (emphasis supplied) (Counter-Memorial, page 8, para. 18)\n\n29. In face of this remarkable hypothesis two observations are called for. First, at no time has\n\nNamibia proposed an 'enclave' solution, according to which, even if the boundary were held to\n\nbe in the northern channel, Namibia would then be claiming sovereignty or more limited\n\nrights over the Island on the basis of prescription. Nor does such a solution form part of the\n\nSubmissions of Namibia as formulated in the Counter-Memorial.\n\n30. In the second place, such a solution would not result in a stable and effective settlement of\n\nthe dispute and was clearly not envisaged by the three Heads of State involved in the various\n\ntransactions leading up to the conclusion of the Special Agreement.\n\n(F) Conclusions\n\n31. It is submitted that the related issues of acquiescence, recognition and prescription are not\n\nincluded in the scope of the question submitted to the Court, for the following reasons:\n\n(i) The purpose of the Special Agreement was to determine the boundary \"on the basis of the\n\nAnglo-German Treaty\" and reliance upon prescription or its congeners would involve reliance\n\non an entirely different basis.\n\n(ii) There is no consideration of policy, or principle of treaty interpretation (including therein\n\nsubsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the\n\nparties regarding its interpretation), which would justify giving the words \"and the rules and\n\nprinciples of international law\" a meaning which would set aside the Anglo-German\n\nAgreement.\n\n(iii) The context of Article 1 of the Special Agreement, including the preamble and the\n\ninstruments which prefigured the reference to the Court - the Kasane Communiqué (1992),\n\nthe Memorandum of Understanding (1992) and the Communiqué of the Harare Summit\n\n(1995) - strongly militates against the marginalisation of the Anglo-German Agreement.\n\n(iv) Prescription replaces an originally lawful status quo and is the perfect antithesis of the\n\napplication of a valid international agreement the purpose of which was to define the\n\nboundary in question.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe Interpretation of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890\n\n(A) Introduction\n\n32. The present chapter constitutes a response to the arguments presented in Chapter II of the\n\nNamibian Counter-Memorial. At the outset of that chapter Namibia makes the following\n\nassertion:\"Both parties are agreed that on the question of treaty interpretation, the task of the Court is to\n\ndetermine whether the northern or the southern channel of the Chobe River around Kasikili\n\nIsland is the 'main channel'. Both are also agreed that this is a question of scientific fact to be\n\nresolved on the basis of expertise in hydrology, geology and hydrogeomorphology.\"\n\n(Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 9, para. 21)\n\n33. The statement that both parties \"are also agreed that this is a question of scientific fact...\"\n\nis incorrect. As the Botswana Memorial makes clear, the identification of \"the main channel\"\n\nof the River Chobe is \"essentially a question of fact\" (Memorial, p. 87, para. 200). Botswana\n\nprefaces this view with the statement:\n\n\"The Court's task is to identify the main channel of the Chobe River in the vicinity of\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island in accordance with the 1890 Agreement.\"\n\n34. The governing principle must be that the question of fact is to be determined not in an\n\nabstract or scientific mode but within the context of the Anglo-German Agreement, and in\n\nrelation to the effective implementation of the purpose of the Agreement, which was to\n\nconstruct a viable boundary.\n\n35. The Namibian Counter-Memorial, like the Memorial, employs a series of intellectual\n\ndevices, unrelated to the world of the negotiators of 1890, in order to make a case for\n\nidentifying the southern channel as the main channel. Those intellectual constructs are as\n\nfollows:\n\nFirst: according to Namibia, the Chobe is not a normal river but is \"an ephemeral river that is\n\ndry over most of its length for much of the year\" or, alternatively, what counts is the flood-\n\nzone and not the river as such.\n\nSecondly: in the contention of Namibia, for this (and other) reasons the criterion of\n\nnavigability does not apply.\n\nThirdly: the rejection of the relevance of navigability necessitates the deconstruction of the\n\nthalweg concept and the unfounded assertion that it is based upon the flow or current of the\n\nriver, and not upon depth.\n\nFourthly: the rejection of the criterion of navigability necessitates the concomitant rejection of\n\nany subsequent practice to the effect that the northern channel was recognised over a very\n\nlong period as the main channel.\n\n36. These intellectual devices will now be evaluated in relation to the interpretation and\n\napplication of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890.\n\n(B) The Treaty Concept of a River\n\n37. In its Counter-Memorial the Government of Botswana demonstrates that the Chobe River\n\nwas the geographical feature referred to in Article III of the Anglo-German Agreement\n\n(Counter-Memorial, pp. 138-141, paras. 355-362). As the Namibian Memorial acknowledges:\n\n\"In choosing the Chobe River, the negotiators selected what they could identify as a major\n\nand prominent geographical feature.\" (Memorial, p. 44, para. 116)38. The Government of Namibia alleges that the Chobe is an eccentric feature. In the words of\n\nthe Counter-Memorial:\n\n\"The Chobe River is not a watercourse carrying water more or less continuously from its\n\ncatchment area downstream to its mouth or the junction with another river. Unlike the major\n\nEuropean rivers and others that spring readily to mind, the Chobe River is an ephemeral river\n\nthat is dry over most of its length for much of the year. In the area of specific concern in this\n\ncase, it is part of a complex system closely associated with the Zambezi River to the north\n\nthat, in the high flow season, carries the flood waters of the Zambezi back into that river\n\nbelow the Mambova Rapids.\" (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 3, para. 10)\n\n39. Botswana strongly contests this picture of the Chobe. In the first place, it does not reflect\n\nthe concept of the Chobe River as it appears in the provisions of the Anglo-German\n\nAgreement. The position has already been explained in the following passage of Botswana's\n\nCounter-Memorial:\n\n\"Article III(2) of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 provides that the boundary in the\n\nrelevant sector \"descends\" the Chobe River. The treaty-makers intended the line drawn on the\n\n1889 Map labelled \"Kuando or Chobe R.\" to be the boundary, not an indeterminate flood zone\n\nof the Zambezi River. They identified the Chobe River as \"the prominent geographical\n\nfeature\", not the Zambezi floodplain. The use of the word \"descends\" is particularly\n\nsignificant in that it indicates gradient and the directional flow of a river and can have no\n\napplication to a ridge which neither ascends nor descends. Similarly gradient, but in an\n\nupstream direction, was in the minds of the treaty-makers when drafting Article I(2) of the\n\n1890 Agreement which describes the German sphere of influence in East Africa by a line \"till\n\nit reaches and ascends that river\", and again in the section of the boundary between the\n\nGerman Protectorate of Togo and the British Gold Coast where Article IV states that the line\n\n'... runs along that parallel westwards till it reaches the left bank of the River Aka; it ascends\n\nthe mid-channel of that river to the 6º20' parallel of north latitude...'.\" (Botswana Counter-\n\nMemorial, p. 138, para. 355)\n\n40. In the second place, the Government of Botswana rejects the hydro-geomorphological\n\ncharacterisation of the Chobe River offered by Namibia. Inter alia, the scientific evidence\n\nestablishes that:\n\n(i) The Chobe is the geographical feature referred to in Article III of the 1890 Agreement as\n\nthe down-flowing river, down which the boundary \"descends\".\n\n(ii) The Chobe is a perennial river independent of the Zambezi River, with a stable profile,\n\ncontinuous downstream flow and visible and stable banks.\n\n(iii) There is flow at all seasons of the year, and that the northern channel is of greater\n\ncapacity and velocity than the southern channel.\n\n41. A further dimension of the Namibian approach is to replace the riverine geography by a\n\n\"broader overlying channel\" and thus, in the result, to substitute a flood plain, selected\n\naccording to entirely self-serving criteria, for the river as perceived by diplomats and\n\ncartographers. The flaws in the Namibian presentation of the scientific evidence are examined\n\nin Chapter 5 of Botswana's Counter-Memorial and in Chapter 5 of the present Reply. The\n\nconcept of the river as a flood-zone is difficult to reconcile with the purpose of the negotiatorsto establish an effective boundary. A flood-plain is a zone whose width varies, is unrelated to\n\nlinear features, and is not reflected in the extensive cartography available, which presents the\n\nChobe as a linear feature and not as a zone.\n\n(C) The Relevance of Navigability\n\n42. The relevance of navigability is denied by the Government of Namibia as a matter of\n\nprinciple. In the Namibian Memorial the question of navigability was ignored, and no\n\nconsideration was given to the relevance of contemporary doctrine concerning the thalweg.\n\nThe Namibian Counter-Memorial is more openly hostile to what it calls \"the criterion of\n\nnavigability\", as appears from the following passage (in the Introduction):\n\n\"On the question of navigability, Namibia maintains that it is unreasonable and therefore\n\nincorrect to apply the criterion of navigability to a river boundary over 300 kilometres in\n\nlength, nine-tenths of which is clearly not navigable. Botswana resolutely confines its\n\nattention only to the last 50 kilometres of the Chobe River from the confluence with the\n\nZambezi River. But the river boundary established by the 1890 Treaty also runs along the\n\nChobe River westward to its juncture with the 18th parallel of south latitude, an additional\n\ndistance of over 250 kilometres. Over all of this stretch, the Chobe River is dry for much of\n\nthe year and in many places for years on end. The criterion of navigability is simply irrelevant\n\nto the river as a whole.\" (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 2, para. 5)\n\nSimilar assertions appear at pages 15-16, para. 38 of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n43. By way of a preliminary reaction to this piece of reasoning, it may be said that it is\n\nremarkable to assert the irrelevance of navigability in relation to a stretch of the Chobe the\n\nnavigability of which has been recognised by the following travellers and officials:\n\n(i) Dr. David Livingstone (1856): see the Botswana Counter-Memorial, pp. 139-140, paras.\n\n358-359;\n\n(ii) Frederick Selous (1881): ibid., p. 139;\n\n(iii) Captain Eason (1912): see the Botswana Memorial, pp. 64-65;\n\n(iv) Major L.F.W. Trollope, Magistrate of the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel (1948): ibid., Annex 22;\n\n(v) N.V. Redman, District Commissioner at Kasane (1948): ibid., Annex 22.\n\n44. In the Joint Report compiled by Trollope and Redman in 1948 each of the channels is\n\ndescribed as \"the waterway\". Moreover, when the official correspondence of the period 1948\n\nto 1951 is recalled, involving the British and South African Governments, it did not occur to\n\nany of those involved to characterise the Chobe as an ephemeral river.\n\n45. The passage from the Namibian pleading quoted above consists of a series of bold\n\nassertions none of which is linked either to the text of the Anglo-German Agreement or to\n\nother legal considerations.\n\n46. However, the Namibian Government, as a secondary argument, asserts that, even if\n\nnavigability were an acceptable criterion, then the overwhelming bulk of the \"water traffic\" isin the southern channel: see the Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 2, para. 6. The Government\n\nof Botswana does not accept that this version of the evidence is correct, but the passage\n\ninvolves a clear admission that there is water traffic and that navigability is thus an available\n\ncriterion.\n\n47. As the Botswana Government has explained in its Memorial, the focus in the negotiation\n\nof the Anglo-German Agreement was upon the issue of access to the major rivers and lakes\n\nand the related issue of German access to the Zambezi: Memorial, pp. 52-60, paras. 118-137.\n\nThe response of Namibia (Counter-Memorial, p. 16, para. 39) is one of equivocation. The\n\nposition of Botswana is not contradicted and no reference is made to the documents of the\n\nnegotiation amply cited in the Botswana Memorial (p. 59, paras. 134-135). However, there is\n\na suggestion, unsupported by evidence, that the giving of access to the Zambezi related to\n\nland access and not to navigability. But the documents do not support this view. The exchange\n\nof letters between the two Governments in 1889 refers to access \"to the upper waters of the\n\nZambezi\": Botswana Memorial, Vol. II, Annexes 4 and 5. Nor does the wording of Article III\n\nof the Agreement support the Namibian suggestion. The documents of 1910 quoted by\n\nNamibia (Counter-Memorial, pp. 16-17, para. 39) actually confirm the Botswana position that\n\nnavigation was the focus of German interest.\n\n48. Further, the suggestion that the giving of access to the Zambezi related to land access and\n\nnot navigability is also contradicted by Namibia's own case as to the object and purpose of the\n\n1890 Agreement in the light of contemporary knowledge that the land north of the Chobe\n\nRiver was \"swampy and unhealthy\" (Namibian Memorial, p. 38, para. 99). As the Namibian\n\nMemorial puts it:\n\n\"As argued above, a boundary along the Chobe Ridge, which generally marks the southern\n\nbank of the Chobe River (and the southern channel in the locality of the Island), would be\n\nmore consistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty to establish a firm, stable and\n\nvisible division between the two spheres of influence than a boundary along the northern\n\nchannel lying within the swampy floodplain that would be difficult to ascertain and would be\n\ncompletely obscured during half the year.\" (Namibian Memorial, p. 6, para. 19)\n\n49. The Namibian Government's reluctance to rely upon the actual documents of the\n\nnegotiation, so readily available, must confirm the impression of a general lack of interest in\n\nthe evidence of the object and purpose of the Anglo-German Agreement.\n\n50. This impression is further confirmed by paragraph 41 of the Namibian Counter-Memorial,\n\nin which it is argued that there has not been much use of the northern channel by commercial\n\nvessels. The point of this is difficult to follow. The issue should, in treaty terms, turn on the\n\nsignificance for the negotiators of the Agreement of the element of navigability. The\n\nincidence of traffic 40 years later is irrelevant. However, as a matter of evidence of the status\n\nof the northern channel as the \"main channel\", the fact is that the issue of the transport of\n\ntimber by barges only arose in relation to the northern channel. The content of paragraph 41\n\ninvolves an important admission in this respect.\n\n51. In this connection a thought-provoking exercise is to compare the letter of Noel Redman\n\ndated 18th December 1947 (Botswana Counter-Memorial, Vol. III, Annex 18) and the\n\nassertions of the Namibian Counter-Memorial. The Namibian Counter-Memorial states that in\n\nthe dry season \"there is virtually no flow at all in the Chobe River, including the portionsaround the Island,\" and cites the Alexander Report. (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 13, para.\n\n31). In contrast is the position reported in Redman's letter:\n\n\"I have the honour to inform you that I have received a letter from the Zambezi Transport &\n\nTrading Company stating that they wish to recommence the transport of timber by river from\n\nSerondella but that they have been informed by you that the channel between Kasane and\n\nSerondela which they intend to use, is in the Caprivi Strip.\n\n2. At low water I understand that this channel is the only water connection between Kasane\n\nand Serondella and I suggest that if this channel does happen to run into the Caprivi Strip\n\nfrom the Chobe river along which our boundary runs it will be in both our interests and a\n\nmatter of convenience if we can come to an arbitrary agreement that half this channel is\n\nincluded in this Territory for the purpose of the transport of the timber by the Zambezi\n\nTransport and Trading Company.\n\n3. If however the channel referred to is part of the Chobe river and not a branch off from it\n\nthen it seems probable that the actual boundary is formed by the deep water channel in the\n\nriver, which would mean that they would not be entering your Territory.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n52. The letter by Redman was the consequence of the letter received from Ker. Ker's use of\n\nthe river had been continuous (see Trollope to Dickinson, Namibian Memorial, Annex 71).\n\nKer was now proposing \"to recommence\" the transport of timber. Moreover, Ker's assessment\n\nof the value of the river for navigation has not been challenged by Namibia. His views have\n\nalways been relied upon and Ker's letter to the Central Africa Council, dated 25 November\n\n1947, appears as Annex 5 in the Namibian Memorandum Submitted to the Joint Team of\n\nTechnical Experts (this letter relates to problems on the Zambezi).\n\n53. In the context of the question of navigability the Namibian Counter-Memorial invokes the\n\npattern of movement of tourist boats in the following passage:\n\n\"The primary basis of the regional economy, apart from subsistence agriculture, is and is\n\nlikely to remain tourism, and it is tourism that generates the commercial activity on the Chobe\n\nRiver in the vicinity of Kasikili Island. (Supp. Rep., sec. 11) Nearly all boat traffic is used to\n\ntransport tourists to view the game on Kasikili Island or further west on the south bank of the\n\nriver within the Chobe National Park. (Supp. Rep., para. 11.5) The boat rides are a well-\n\nadvertised attraction for visitors to the area. (Supp. Rep., Sheet 17s, Photo P25s; Sheet 18s,\n\nPhoto P26s). The tourist boats use the southern channel almost exclusively, although a few\n\nboats returning from Kasane use the northern channel. (Supp. Rep., para. 11.12)...\" (Counter-\n\nMemorial, page 19, para. 45)\n\n54. The legal relevance of such data is nullified by a series of factors. First of all, the boats are\n\nof very shallow draught and can navigate in both the northern and southern channels. It must\n\nfollow that the traffic can provide no criterion for distinguishing the main channel. Assuming\n\nthat it is true that the game can be more readily viewed from the southern channel, this factor\n\nobviously has no connection with navigability. None of this data, such as it is, has any relation\n\nwith the boundary-making purposes of the negotiations of 1890.\n\n(D) The Language of the Anglo-German Agreement and the Concept of the Thalweg55. In its Memorial the Government of Botswana examined the issues of interpretation\n\nrelating to the Anglo-German Agreement in Chapter V, and emphasis was placed upon\n\ninterpretation in accordance with the object and purpose of the Anglo-German Agreement,\n\nand the presumption that the parties to an agreement intended a result which was in\n\nconformity with general international law. On these bases two linked propositions were\n\ndeveloped, backed by substantial documentation:\n\nFirst: that a major purpose of the Agreement was the protection of access to the principal\n\nlakes and rivers of the African continent, and to establish and promote the relationship\n\nbetween boundary-making and navigation.\n\nSecondly: that the Zambezi and its major affluents were considered to be navigable and that\n\nthe general international law contemporaneous with the negotiation of the Agreement\n\nrecognised that in the case of navigable rivers the middle of the navigable channel was the\n\nboundary between the riparian States. In other words, the doctrine of contemporary\n\ninternational law linked the role of navigation and the concept of the thalweg.\n\n56. In its Counter-Memorial the Government of Botswana explained that the concept of the\n\nthalweg applies without difficulty to cases of bifurcation: see the Counter-Memorial, p. 73,\n\nparas. 195-196. In addition, the problems arising from the German translation of the phrase\n\n\"the main channel of\" in the German text of the Agreement were examined: ibid., pp. 73-74,\n\nparas. 197-199. The conclusion of the Government of Botswana in the Counter-Memorial was\n\nas follows:\n\n\"In its Memorial, Namibia argues (p. 44) that 'the \"main channel\" must be found first; the\n\n\"centre\" can necessarily only be found afterward' and 'the \"hauptlauf\" cannot be identified by\n\nfirst seeking to find the \"thalweg\"'. This is not correct. Rather, the main channel is the one in\n\nwhich the thalweg is situated. If Namibia's argument that 'in the same way as with the English\n\ntext, the search must first be for the \"hauptlauf\" and for the \"thalweg\" only after the\n\n\"hauptlauf\" has been found' was correct there could be two or more thalwege, one in the main\n\nchannel and others in the various branches of the river as Namibia's argument, by implication,\n\nis based on the assumption that a thalweg may be found in each channel. A river, however,\n\nhas only one thalweg, i.e. one deepest channel in which vessels of largest tonnage descend the\n\nriver. Thus, where the thalweg may be found, the main channel may be found too. Namibia\n\nmakes the mistake of dividing the English expression 'the centre of the main channel' in two\n\nparts, i.e., 'the centre of' and 'the main channel of', thereby overlooking that only the\n\nexpression as a whole has the meaning of thalweg. The term 'the centre' on its own does not\n\nequate with 'thalweg' and is more reminiscent of the median line principle than of the thalweg\n\nprinciple.\" (Botswana Counter-Memorial p. 74, para. 199)\n\n57. The Botswana Counter-Memorial also establishes that the subsequent conduct of the\n\nGerman Government confirmed that the boundary in the Chobe was the thalweg: see ibid., pp.\n\n73-74, para. 197.\n\n58. In its Counter-Memorial Namibia addresses the issues concerning the thalweg in two\n\nways:\n\nFirst: Namibia contends that the phrase in the English text \"centre of the main channel\" does\n\nnot refer to the centre of the deepest channel and, further, that the reference is not linked to\n\nnavigability (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 23, para. 53).Secondly: Namibia contends that the principles of international law contemporaneous with the\n\n1890 Agreement did not embody the thalweg doctrine, and, even if they did, not in the form\n\nemployed by Botswana.\n\n59. The second issue will be considered in the following section of the present chapter. In\n\nrelation to the first question raised by Namibia the Government of Botswana retains full\n\nconfidence in the exposition of the linguistic issues contained in its Counter-Memorial at pp.\n\n69 to 74 (paras. 194-199). However, it is necessary to remove certain obfuscations offered by\n\nNamibia in the second pleading.\n\n60. In its Counter-Memorial, Vol. I, p. 22, n. 55, Namibia gives the wrong impression that the\n\nEnglish text of the Agreement was translated into German in two stages. It says:\n\n\"This alteration of the previous German text shows two changes. The first is that in view of\n\nthe full English phrase 'centre of the main channel of that river', the German text had to insert\n\na word to refer to the notion of 'centre' which the German text of 17 June 1890 did not do.\n\nThis reference to the centre was expressed by the term Thalweg, which is quite in line with\n\ngeneral use of the term in other boundary treaties. A second change was introduced into the\n\nGerman text by adding the words des Hauptlaufes to the term Thalweg....\"\n\nThe German diplomatic documents clearly show that the full English-language text of the\n\ntreaty (\"centre of the main channel of that river\") was translated as a whole on or after 28 June\n\n1890 first into \"Thal-Linie des Hauptlaufes dieses Flusses\" and then into \"Thalweg des\n\nHauptlaufes dieses Flusses\". It is thus impossible to equate \"Thalweg\" with \"centre\" and \"the\n\nmain channel of\" with \"des Hauptlaufes\".\n\n[1 \"längs dem Tschobefluß\"]\n\n(E) The Principles of International Law contemporaneous with the Anglo-German\n\nAgreement of 1890\n\n61. The Botswana Memorial cites 17 authorities for the proposition that at the time of the\n\nconclusion of the Anglo-German Agreement \"it was generally recognised that in the case of\n\nnavigable rivers the middle of the main channel (thalweg) was the boundary between the\n\nriparian States\": Botswana Memorial, pp. 60-62, para. 138. The time span involved is from\n\n1864 to 1928. The various editions of the standard authorities were included because this is\n\nclearly relevant to the issue of consistency and continuity of opinion in the relevant period.\n\n62. The Namibian Government seeks to challenge this evidence in its Counter-Memorial (pp.\n\n23-24, para. 54). The challenge is less than effective and, by relying upon minority opinions,\n\nonly serves to emphasise the general coherence of the picture presented by Botswana.\n\n63. Namibia presents 47 authorities, which are collected in Annex 9 of the Counter-Memorial.\n\nThe impressive total includes 18 authorities who support Botswana's position (Namibian\n\nCounter-Memorial, Vol. II, pp. 82-88), and are recognised as doing so by Namibia. It also\n\nincludes a further 12 authorities who employ less precise formulations but certainly do not\n\noppose the thalweg (ibid., pp. 88-100). The most remarkable aspect of the Namibian\n\nmobilisation of authorities is that the group which is said to be \"critical of the suitability of the\n\nthalweg-concept\" numbers only five. Thus, out of 47 authorities cited by Namibia, only five\n\nare said to support the Namibian position, whilst 30 authorities provide some level of supportfor the view of Botswana. Moreover, the language employed by the five authorities alleged to\n\nbe \"critical\" is very tentative.\n\n64. Botswana had not sought to be exhaustive in its listing in its Memorial, but in any case\n\ntwo more authorities can be added:\n\n- Josef Kohler (ed.), Encyklopädie der Rechtswissenschaft [Enclyclopedia of Jurisprudence]\n\n(1904), p. 1010 (Annex 3): \"Bei schiffbarn Flüssen ist seit dem Frieden von Luneville (1801)\n\nmeist die Mittellinie des tiefsten Stromlaufes, der Talweg, die Grenze;\" [\"Since the Peace of\n\nLuneville (1801), in navigable rivers the boundary as a rule is the centre of the deepest\n\nchannel, the Talweg\"]\n\n- Karl, Freiherr von Stengel (ed.), Wörterbuch des Deutschen Verwaltungsrechts\n\n[Encyclopedia of German Administrative Law] (1890), p. 2 (Annex 2): \"Das durch\n\nvölkerrechtliche Übung befestigte Grenzprincip des 'Thalwegs' (chemin d'aval)...\" [\"The\n\nboundary concept of the 'Thalweg' (chemin d'aval) which has been strengthened by\n\ninternational legal practice...\"]\n\n65. The position of Botswana is confirmed by modern authorities which refer back to the\n\nearlier periods. Thus the latest edition of Oppenheim's International Law states the following:\n\n\"Boundary rivers are those which separate different states from each other. If such a river is\n\nnot navigable, the boundary line as a rule follows the mid-line of the river; or of its principal\n\narm if it has more than one. If navigable, the boundary line as a rule follows the mid-line of\n\nthe so-called thalweg, of the principal channel of the river, and this general rule for the two\n\nkinds of rivers was adopted by the Treaties of Peace 1919, except in special cases.\" (9th ed.,\n\n1992, pp. 664-665)\n\nIn this passage footnote 2 reads as follows (in relation to the thalweg):\n\n\"See definition in Annuaire (1887), Art. 3: 'La frontière des Etats séparés par le fleuve est\n\nmarqué [sic] par le thalweg, c'est-à-dire par la ligne médiane du chenal.' \"\n\n66. It is clear that the present editors of Oppenheim regard the principle as being long-\n\nestablished. In his great work on British practice, Lord McNair observes: \"In the case of a\n\nboundary river, it is mid-channel, the thalweg which forms the boundary\": International Law\n\nOpinions, 1956, Vol. 1, p. 307. The work as a whole focuses upon sources prior to 1902 and\n\nthe proposition heads a dispatch dated 19 March 1847.\n\n67. The Government of Botswana invoked the resolution of the Heidelberg Session of the\n\nInstitut de Droit International in 1887 which confirms the thalweg principle for navigable\n\nrivers. This is quoted in full in the Memorial of Botswana (page 62). This resolution is cited\n\n(without reservation) in the ninth edition of Oppenheim's International Law (see para. 65\n\nabove). Namibia attempts to discount the value of the resolution by asserting that, because the\n\nRapporteur did not accept that the principle was generally recognised, the text of the\n\nresolution in this respect was de lege ferenda. This is difficult to understand. The resolutions\n\nof the Institut are adopted collectively by the members and associate members. Rapporteurs\n\ncannot enter 'reservations' and the language of the resolution itself contains no element of lex\n\nferenda.68. In para. 56 of its Counter-Memorial, Vol. I, Namibia states that:\n\n\"The treaty practice of European colonial powers in Africa in the period of the 1890 Treaty\n\nreveals, if anything, even less uniformity than the general practice or the scholarly writings.\n\nOne of the most striking features of these treaties is the variety of language used to describe\n\nriver boundaries ...\" This statement may be contrasted with the passage from K. Schulthess,\n\nDas internationale Wasserrecht [International Water Law] (1915), p. 12 (Annex 5):\n\n\"Der Talweg. Terminologie: Talweg, Stromrinne, tiefste Tiefe, Axe ... englisch: Chenal, Ship-\n\nChannel, the deepest channel, middle of the channel, centre of the chenal, mid-channel,\n\nmiddle of the stream, middle of the river ... Das Wort \"Talweg\" selbst ist international\n\ngeworden und wird in den meisten bezügl. Verträgen etc. gebraucht, abwechselnd mit z.T.\n\nungenauen, ja direkt unzutreffenden national-sprachlichen Bezeichnungen... (p. 15). Nach der\n\nherrschenden Lehre ist bei schiffbaren Flüssen im Zweifel der Talweg als Grenzlinie\n\nanzusehen ... So ist namentlich in den etwa zwei Dutzend uns bekannten Verträgen, die sich\n\nmit der Feststellung der Grenze bei den afrikanischen Strömen und (p. 16) Flüssen befassen,\n\nstets der Talweg als Grenzlinie festgesetzt). (n.26: Einzig in einem deutsch-engl.\n\nÜbereinkommen von 1906 (Nr. 150) wird als Grenze die \"median line\" genannt.) Daraus\n\nmüssen wir den Schluß ziehen, dass demzufolge für die internationalen Flüsse Afrikas im\n\nZweifel der Talweg als Grenze zu vermuten ist ...\"\n\n[\"The Talweg. Terminology: Talweg, Stromrinne, tiefste Rinne ... English: Chenal, Ship\n\nChannel, the deepest channel, middle of the channel, centre of the chenal, mid-channel,\n\nmiddle of the stream, middle of the river ... The term \"Talweg\" itself has become international\n\nproperty and is used in most relevant treaties etc., interchangeably with partly imprecise and\n\nsometimes even incorrect national terms ...(p. 15). According to the predominant view in the\n\nliterature, in case of doubt the talweg is to be regarded as the boundary in navigable rivers ...\n\nIn about two dozen treaties known to the author which deal with the delimitation of river (p.\n\n16) and stream boundaries in Africa [the treaties are listed in an Annex] in all cases but one\n\nthe Talweg has been fixed as the boundary (n.26: The only exception is the Anglo-German\n\nTreaty of 1906 (No. 150) which provides for the \"median line\" as boundary). From this we\n\nmust conclude that, in case of doubt, the Talweg is presumed to be the boundary in the\n\ninternational rivers of Africa.\"]\n\n69. The Namibian Counter-Memorial contends that the diversity of terminology in treaties\n\nrelating to Africa (used to describe river boundaries) demonstrates the absence of any rule of\n\ngeneral international law: see Counter-Memorial, pp. 25-28, paras. 56-58. This argument has\n\nseveral significant flaws. In the first place, it puts the cart before the horse. The position of\n\nBotswana is that there is a presumption, well-recognised in the authorities and in the\n\njurisprudence of the Court, that a treaty provision, in this case Article III, is compatible with\n\nthe principles of contemporary international law. In this respect it appears to be irrelevant to\n\npoint out that other treaties do not make express reference to the thalweg. In the second place,\n\nthe fact that other treaties, and other provisions of the Anglo-German Agreement, use terms\n\nsuch as 'course' or 'centre of the channel', is far from being conclusive on the issue. Indeed,\n\nsuch terms are perfectly compatible with the concepts of thalweg and navigability.\n\n70. In the third place, the less precise usage in other provisions can only reinforce the view\n\nthat the language of Article III of the Anglo-German Agreement should be given its ordinary\n\nmeaning. The more precise terminology, it may be presumed, reflects the particular\n\nsignificance of navigability to be seen in the records of the negotiation.71. In its Counter-Memorial, Vol. I, p. 27, n. 70 Namibia states that \"It is interesting that in\n\nthese colonial African treaties, admittedly a random sample, the word thalweg was first used\n\nin the treaty between the United Kingdom and France of 1899. The term did not begin to be\n\nused with any frequency in Africa until after 1910\". In this connection it may be of interest to\n\nnote that Great Britain and Germany had already on 11 November 1898 concluded a\n\n\"Protocol containing the Decisions of the Commissioners appointed to delimit the Nyasa-\n\nTanganyika Boundary\", which provided in Art. 4: \"In all cases when a river or stream forms\n\nthe boundary it is said to be understood that the boundary-line is the \"talweg\" of the stream;\n\nbut in cases where the \"talweg\" is indeterminate, the centre line of the bed is to be taken as the\n\nboundary.\" (N.R.G., 2nd series, XXXII, 399; British and Foreign State Papers, Vol. 92, 797)\n\n72. It is clear that Namibia does not have much confidence in its assertion that there was no\n\nrule of law according to which \"the middle of the navigable channel (thalweg) was the\n\nboundary between the riparian States, because there is an alternative argument\" offered:\n\nCounter-Memorial, pp. 28-38, paras. 59-76. According to this alternative argument, the\n\nthalweg concept \"has to do fundamentally with the flow or current of the river and is only\n\nsecondarily related to depth\": ibid., p. 28, para. 59.\n\n73. This argument meets three major obstacles. In the first place, even if this assertion were\n\ncorrect, it would provide no assistance to Namibia because the criterion of flow does not\n\nfavour the southern channel in any event: see Chapter 6 (C).\n\n74. The second obstacle consists of the fact that the authorities simply do not support the\n\nNamibian position. The drafters of the Namibian Counter-Memorial appear to be aware of the\n\ntrue position because the relevant section is introduced by the following concession:\n\n\"Doubtless most of the discussions of the thalweg of a river channel refer to its relation to the\n\ndeepest part of the channel\": Counter-Memorial, p. 28, para. 60. Indeed, Professor Alexander,\n\nNamibia's expert, adopts the following definition in his Expert Report:\n\n\"A thalweg in its scientific signification, is a single continuous trace that identifies the line of\n\ndeepest water along the length of a river channel. This definition is internationally recognised\n\nin the hydrological and geomorphological literature but has somewhat different legal\n\ninterpretations when applied to boundaries along rivers. These historical and legal definitions\n\nare not considered in this report.\" (Expert Report, pp. 5-6, para. 2.11)\n\n75. It is not surprising to find that the authorities invoked by Namibia do not support the new\n\nNamibian definition. This is true of the definitions in the Deutsches Wörterbuch (Counter-\n\nMemorial, para. 61) and the Brockhaus Konversationslexikon (ibid.). Like other sources cited\n\nby Namibia, these authorities tend to associate the line of deepest soundings and the strongest\n\nflow or current. Thus the Joint Survey established that the northern channel is the deeper\n\nchannel: \"its mean depth of 5.7m exceeds the depth of the south channel by 2.13m\"\n\n(Botswana Memorial, Chapter VII, Professor Sefe's First Opinion, p. 4). This finding is\n\nclearly inimical to Professor Alexander's contention that the greater flow is through the\n\nsouthern channel, since depth is an essential factor, along with width and velocity, to\n\ndischarge.\n\n76. The third obstacle to the Namibian contention is that it is very unlikely that the sources\n\nquoted would envisage any polarity (of the kind now argued for) between depth and flow.\n\nThis is evident in the legal sources quoted by Namibia: Counter-Memorial, p. 30, para. 63. Itthus follows that there is no substance in the view that the six authorities cited in paragraph 63\n\nwould regard depth as an unacceptable criterion.\n\n77. The optimism of the Namibian mode of citation can only be demonstrated by a quotation\n\nof paragraphs 64 and 65 of the Namibian Counter-Memorial:\n\n\"64. Edouard Engelhardt, the chief sponsor of Article 3 of the Heidelberg Resolution, speaks\n\nof the thalweg formula, 'suivant laquelle la limite respective est placée au milieu du chenal ou\n\ndu grand courant qui dénote d'ordinaire l'endroit le plus profond.' (emphasis added) In a note\n\nhe adds, 'Le thalweg est la partie la plus basse du lit sur laquelle le courant se meut avec la\n\nplus grande vitesse.' (emphasis added)\n\n65. Other scholars of the period not cited by Botswana are in agreement:\n\n· J. Westlake: 'the thalweg, a German word meaning literally the 'downway', is the course\n\ntaken by boats going down stream, which again is that of the strongest current....' (emphasis\n\nadded)\n\n· P. Fiore: '[L]a ligne médiane du fleuve [est la] ... ligne de thalweg ... Il ne faut pas oublier,\n\ntoutefois, que sous le nom de ligne médiane de fleuve on n'entend pas celle qui se trouve à\n\négale distance des deux rives, mais celle idéalement tracée au milieu de la partie du lit où les\n\neaux sont les plus profondes et les plus rapides'. (emphasis added)\n\n· L.F. von Neumann: 'the line that is taken by ships going downstream, more precisely the\n\ncenter of the downward current.' (emphasis added)\n\n· P. Orban: 'la partie la plus basse du lit sur laquelle le courant se meut avec la plus grande\n\nvitesse.' (emphasis added)\n\n· H. Bonfils: 'Un fleuve coule-t-il entre deux Etats, c'est le thalweg, le milieux [sic] du courant\n\nprincipal qui sert de limite.' (emphasis added)\n\n· A. Chrétien: 'On n'entend pas par là [la ligne dit le thalweg] la ligne se trouvant à égale\n\ndistance deux rives, mais \"celle idéalement tracée au milieu de la partie\" du lit où les eaux\n\nsont les plus profondes et les plus \"rapides\", en d'autres termes, au milieu du chenal\n\nnavigable.' \" (Namibian Counter-Memorial, pp. 31-32; emphasis added, footnotes omitted)\n\n78. Of these seven authorities, four expressly refer to depth and obviously regard depth and\n\ngreatest flow as complementary. There is no evidence to suggest that the other three would\n\nregard the criterion of depth with disfavour. Edouard Engelhardt regards the depth criterion as\n\na restatement of the factor of strongest current. Moreover, Panzera, the Resident\n\nCommissioner, in his instructions to Captain Eason, adopts the criterion \"the deepest channel\n\nin which there is the strongest current\" (emphasis in original: Botswana Memorial, Annex\n\n17).\n\n79. The complementary relation of greatest depth and the downstream current is emphasised\n\nby two sources relied on by Namibia. Thus Charles Cheney Hyde observes:\n\n\"The thalweg, as the derivation of the term indicates, is the downway, or the course followed\n\nby vessels of largest tonnage in descending the river. That course frequently, if notcommonly, corresponds with the deepest channel. It may, however, for special reasons take a\n\ndifferent path. Wheresoever that may be, such a course necessarily indicates the principal\n\nartery of commerce, and for that reason is decisive of the thalweg.\" (American Journal of Int.\n\nLaw, Vol. 6 (1912), pp. 902-903). (Botswana Counter-Memorial, Vol. III, Annex 8).\n\n80. Again, Brownlie expresses the following view (in 1979):\n\n\"A great many boundary descriptions affecting alignments in Africa refer to rivers and\n\nstreams. If reference is made to a river without further definition, the question then arises\n\nwhether the division is according to the median line or on some other basis. The doctrine of\n\ninternational law supports the view that, in the case of non-navigable rivers, the median line is\n\napplicable, whilst in the case of a navigable river, the principle of the thalweg is to be applied.\n\nThese principles are presumptions. In any case, the concept of the thalweg may be employed\n\nin treaty descriptions. Its normal meaning is the median line of the principal channel of\n\nnavigation. This will usually be sufficiently ascertainable. A more refined reference would be\n\nthe continuous line of deepest soundings. There may turn out to be several equally significant\n\nchannels of navigation.\" (emphasis added) (African Boundaries: A Legal and Diplomatic\n\nEncyclopaedia, 1979, p. 17)\n\n81. In the standard treatise written by Professor O'Connell and published in 1984 the same\n\nconjunction of depth and navigation also appears:\n\n\"Although the expression 'thalweg' has its origins in river law, it is sometimes employed in\n\nmaritime law relating to coastal waters in order to designate the access routes to the coast in\n\ncomplex fairways. In river law the word is used in two senses: the line of greatest depth,\n\nwhich coincides with that of the strongest current, and the access to the channel most\n\nappropriate for navigation; but in maritime law it is used to designate the principal channel\n\ntowards a given point.\n\nThe idea behind applying this solution to the problem of demarcation of the territorial seas of\n\nopposite States is that it is necessary in delimiting sovereignty to take account of the depth\n\nand therefore the navigability of waters.\" (emphasis supplied) (O'Connell, The International\n\nLaw of the Sea, edited by I.A. Shearer, 1984, pp. 659-660)\n\n82. It is difficult to see how this type of debate, or more truly, non-debate, can assist the Court\n\nin interpreting and applying Article III of the Anglo-German Agreement.\n\n(F) The Conduct of the Parties\n\n83. The subsequent conduct of the parties to the Anglo-German Agreement (and their\n\nsuccessors) confirms the interpretation according to which the correct identification of the\n\n\"main channel\" involves the northern channel. The evidence is reviewed in the Memorial of\n\nBotswana, pages 64 to 74, in the Counter-Memorial, pages 83 to 86, and in Chapter 3 below.\n\n84. One document may be repeated to illustrate the lack of reality in the factual inferences\n\nproposed on behalf of Namibia by way of scientific evidence and otherwise.\n\n85. In 1948 the two local administrators, respectively on behalf of South Africa and the\n\nUnited Kingdom, produced a Joint Report, in which the key paragraphs are as follows:\"2. We attach hereto a sketch map (not drawn to scale) of the Kasikili Island in the Chobe\n\nRiver and the waterways relative thereto.\n\n3. We find after separate examination of the terrain and the examination of an aerial\n\nphotograph that the \"main channel\" does not follow the waterway which is usually shown on\n\nmaps as the boundary between the two Territories.\n\n4. We express the opinion that the \"main channel\" lies in the waterway which would include\n\nthe island in question in the Bechuanaland Protectorate.\" (Botswana Memorial, Annex 22)\n\n86. It is reasonable to assume that the preparation of the Joint Report resulted from a mandate\n\nfrom the two Governments, but no document to this effect has been seen. At any rate, when\n\nthe Report was sent to Pretoria, the South African Government did not seek to repudiate it.\n\nThe Joint Report is of particular significance because it resulted from a practical question\n\nconcerning the commercial importance of navigability. As Mr. Redman reported (letter dated\n\n26 January 1948):\n\n\"I have the honour to attach a joint report by the Native Commissioner, Eastern Caprivi Strip\n\nand myself concerning a dispute which has arisen over the ownership of the island shown on\n\nthe enclosed sketch map.\n\n2. The question has arisen as a result of an application by Mr. Ker to transport timber by barge\n\nfrom Serondela to Katombora, which necessitates the use of the channel running to the North\n\nof Kasikili Island since the Southern Channel is not navigable by his Barges when the river is\n\nnot in flood, and it is even difficult for small craft to navigate it.\" (Botswana Memorial,\n\nAnnex 22)\n\n87. It is unfortunate that the Government of Namibia has not afforded the Court an\n\nopportunity to have its views on these highly relevant documents.\n\n(G) Conclusions\n\n88. In the first paragraph of its conclusions to the chapter of the Counter-Memorial\n\ntheoretically devoted to the interpretation of Article III of the Anglo-German Agreement, the\n\nGovernment of Namibia encapsulates its defensive policy and desire to move away from the\n\nAgreement and the interests of the negotiators:\n\n\"Namibia continues to maintain that the identification of the main channel within the meaning\n\nof the 1890 Treaty is a question of scientific fact to be resolved on the basis of scientific\n\nevidence and criteria. The main distinguishing factor, as the experts of both parties agree, is\n\nthe volume of the flow of the river that passes through the channel. Since substantially all of\n\nthe flow of the Chobe River passes through the southern channel, it follows that the southern\n\nchannel is the main channel.\" (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 38, para. 77)\n\n89. It is, of course, the case that when Namibia declares that the identification of the main\n\nchannel is \"a question of scientific fact\" the consequence, in reality, is that criteria are\n\nintroduced (by Namibia) which are unrelated either to the text of the Agreement or its object\n\nand purpose. The text of the Agreement and the negotiators had in mind a river with normal\n\ncharacteristics. The Namibian Government substitutes an artificial concept, in which the main\n\nfeature is a flood zone or, on occasions, a neighbouring escarpment.90. The consequence of the Namibian thesis is that 'flow' or 'current' is substituted for\n\nnavigability. This involves the erroneous assertion that there is more flow in the southern\n\nchannel and this issue of fact is addressed in Chapter 6 (C). For present purposes it is\n\nnecessary to point out that it is a strange procedure to suggest an opposition between flow and\n\nnavigability. The authorities usually see the two elements as complementary or equivalent.\n\nThe artificiality of the Namibian pleading reflects the difficulty presented by the evidence that\n\nthe navigable channel in the relevant sector of the river is the northern channel.\n\n91. The entire chapter confirms the multiple forms of reluctance on the part of Namibia:\n\n(i) to focus upon the actual text of the Anglo-German Agreement;\n\n(ii) to focus upon the ample documentation of the negotiation of the Agreement;\n\n(iii) to focus upon the object and purpose of the Agreement as revealed in the negotiations;\n\nand\n\n(iv) to accept the relevance of the contemporaneous principles of general international law.\n\n92. To these forms of reluctance it is necessary to add the clearly stated opinion of the two\n\nadministrators, Trollope and Redman, in their Joint Report of 1948, and the fact that Mr. Ker\n\nintended to use the northern channel for his barges because, as Redman says (above), \"the\n\nSouthern Channel is not navigable by his Barges when the river is not in flood, and it is even\n\ndifficult for small craft to navigate it\". Trollope and Redman would have been bemused by the\n\ncontents of Chapter II of the Namibian Counter-Memorial.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nThe Subsequent Conduct of the Parties and Their Successors\n\n(A) Introduction\n\n93. The purpose of this chapter is to reply to the content of Chapter III of the Counter-\n\nMemorial of Namibia. However, as the Government of Botswana has indicated in the\n\nintroduction to the present pleading, the definitive position of Botswana has already been\n\nexpounded in the Memorial and Counter-Memorial. Thus the subsequent conduct of the\n\nparties and their successors has been dealt with in detail as follows:\n\n(i) Memorial of the Republic of Botswana, pages 64 to 74, paragraphs 145 to 163; pages 75 to\n\n85, paragraphs 166 to 199.\n\n(ii) Counter-Memorial of the Republic of Botswana, pages 83 to 87, paragraphs 234 to 249.\n\n(B) The Namibian Reliance upon Prescription94. The Government of Botswana would reaffirm, at the outset, that the Namibian argument\n\nbased upon \"the subsequent conduct of the parties ... and their successors in title\" represents a\n\nmajor legal solecism, because it is not in reality related to a process of treaty interpretation.\n\nAs the following quotations reveal, the thesis of Namibia's chapter on \"subsequent conduct\" is\n\nsubstantially related to the distinct theme of prescription:\n\n\"Namibia demonstrated in its Memorial that the Masubia of Caprivi had occupied and\n\ncultivated Kasikili Island from before the conclusion of the 1890 Treaty until well into the\n\nsecond half of the present century and that Namibia's predecessors in title had continuously\n\nexercised jurisdiction over the area with the full knowledge of Botswana and its predecessors\n\nand without any official objection or protest from them until 1984. In Namibia's view, this\n\nrecord not only confirms the interpretation of the Treaty as locating the boundary in the\n\nsouthern channel of the Chobe River at Kasikili Island, but also constitutes an independent\n\ntitle to sovereignty over the Island by operation of the doctrines of acquiescence, recognition\n\nand prescription.\" (emphasis supplied) (Namibian Counter-Memorial, p. 40, para. 83; footnote\n\nomitted)\n\n\"The foregoing review of the materials relating to the subsequent conduct of the parties in\n\nBotswana's Memorial serves only to confirm the position that Namibia and its predecessors in\n\ntitle were in possession of Kasikili Island from 1890 to 1991. During all that time it exercised\n\njurisdiction over Kasikili Island. All this occurred with the knowledge and acceptance of the\n\nBotswana authorities and without protest from them until 1984. This record on the one hand\n\nconfirms the interpretation of the Treaty placing the boundary in the southern channel and, on\n\nthe other, establishes Namibia's right to the Island by operation of the doctrines of\n\nacquiescence, recognition and prescription.\" (emphasis supplied) (Namibian Counter-\n\nMemorial, p. 60, para. 137)\n\n95. The significance accorded to the theme of prescriptive title is indicated by the fact that the\n\nfirst paragraph quoted forms a key part of the introduction to the chapter, and the second\n\nparagraph is headed: \"Conclusion as to the Subsequent Conduct of the Parties\".\n\n96. As Botswana has pointed out already, in the Counter-Memorial, the concept of the\n\nsubsequent practice of the parties as an instrument of treaty interpretation is based upon the\n\nagreement of the parties in relation to the interpretation of the treaty text, whereas prescription\n\nis based upon the displacement of the lawful status quo by adverse possession. Adverse\n\npossession is the very antithesis of an alignment established by treaty.\n\n97. The Namibian argument based upon prescription, acquiescence and recognition, has been\n\naddressed in Chapter 9 of Botswana's Counter-Memorial and the Court is respectfully referred\n\nto the arguments developed therein.\n\n98. It is proposed to examine the specific assertions of Namibia presented in Chapter III of the\n\nCounter-Memorial.\n\n(C) The Alleged \"Exercise of Jurisdiction by South Africa\" in the 1970s\n\n99. Whilst Chapter III of the Namibian Counter-Memorial is entitled \"The Subsequent\n\nConduct of the Parties to the Anglo-German Treaty of 1890 and their Successors in Title\", the\n\nsubstantial part of the text is devoted to an attempt to deny the legal significance of various\n\nepisodes advanced by Botswana as subsequent conduct of the parties.100. In fact Namibia offers only one episode alleged to involve the \"exercise of jurisdiction\n\nover Kasikili Island by South Africa in the 1970s\". The incident concerned is presented thus\n\nby Namibia:\n\n\"88. In 1972, six years after Botswana's independence and five years after the establishment\n\nof the Chobe National Park, a Botswana magistrate recognised in a criminal proceeding that\n\nKasikili Island was Namibian territory and that Botswana had no jurisdiction over it. On 28\n\nSeptember, three Caprivians were arrested on Kasikili Island by game wardens from the\n\nChobe National Park and were detained in Kasane for five days before being brought before\n\nthe magistrate. According to contemporaneous affidavits made by two of the men, the\n\nmagistrate dismissed the case because they were arrested outside Botswana's jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to one of the affidavits:\n\nWe were kept in custody at the Kasane police Station and appeared before the Magistrate of\n\nKasane after five days. After the interrogation and after the defence closed its case the\n\nMagistrate found us not guilty and said that the island was part of the Caprivi and that we had\n\nbeen arrested illegally.\n\nThe other said the magistrate 'acquitted us when giving judgment and said that we had been\n\narrested illegally and criticised the game warden for arresting us on Caprivi territory.'\n\n89. Recognition of Namibian jurisdiction and disavowal of Botswana jurisdiction over\n\nKasikili Island by a judicial officer of the newly independent Botswana Government, residing\n\nin the neighbourhood and having personal knowledge of the situation, is the strongest kind of\n\nevidence of the understanding of the parties as to the location of the boundary under the\n\nTreaty and in practice.\" (Namibian Counter-Memorial, pp. 42-43)\n\n101. The real facts were very different. It is true that four Caprivians were arrested on\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island by officials of the Wildlife Department of Botswana on 28 September\n\n1973. They had been hunting within the Chobe National Park and had been seen by a Senior\n\nGame Warden, Mr. Slogrove, hunting lechwe. They were handed over to the police in\n\nKasane. After two days they were released.\n\n102. No trial took place and therefore no \"judicial officer ... having personal knowledge of the\n\nsituation\" was involved. However, the episode involved several Botswana officials who did\n\nhave long experience and knowledge of the situation and who had no doubt whatsoever that\n\nthe island formed part of Botswana. The relevant officials were as follows:\n\nFirst: The arresting officer, Mr. Slogrove, who was the Senior Game Warden of the Chobe\n\nNational Park (Annexes 10 and 21).\n\nSecond: The Officer Commanding No. 7 Police District, Kasane. His views appear in\n\nSavingram R.8(64) of 22 March 1973 (Annex 11).\n\nThird: The District Commissioner (and Resident Magistrate) of the Chobe District, Mr.\n\nSebele (Annex 20).\n\n103. The contemporaneous Report on the arrest by Mr. Slogrove, dated 22 March 1973\n\n(Annex 10), is very helpful in referring not only to the arrest of the illegal hunters but also thelanding of the Botswana police unit on the island during a visit to the District by the President\n\nof Botswana. The key passages of the Slogrove Report are as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the South African Department of Foreign Affairs letter 1/160/3/1 of the\n\n22nd February, 1973. The arrest of four Caprivian males hunting lechwe on Sedudu Island\n\n(Kasikili) in September, 1972 was the result of separate discussions with yourself, the O.C.\n\nPolice No. 7 District (Ass. Supt. W.B. Anderson) and the District Commissioner Chobe\n\nDistrict (Mr. K. Sebele).\n\nI gathered from these discussions that the general consensus of opinion was that the deep\n\nwater channel around"
