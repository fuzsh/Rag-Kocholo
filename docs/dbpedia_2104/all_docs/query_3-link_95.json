        "text": "It has been almost a year since Microsoft Flight Simulator was first released on PC. The game was universally praised as one of the best gaming experiences out there, and yet it kept getting better and better with the release of each World Update adding new handcrafted airports and points of interest.\n\nWhen the game finally released for consoles in July, five World Updates were already available: Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France & Benelux and the Nordics — and a sixth update based on Germany, Austria and Switzerland was released a couple of months later. As such, the game now has hundreds of points of interest, and choosing your next destination is not getting easier.\n\nWith that in mind, we compiled a complete list with every point of interest currently available on Microsoft Flight Simulator, alongside information regarding its territory, latitude, longitude and altitude. Buckle up and browse the list to choose where to fly next — after all, the sky is calling!\n\nAfrica | Americas | Asia | Europe | Oceania\n\nAfrica\n\nAmericas\n\nAsia\n\nEurope"
