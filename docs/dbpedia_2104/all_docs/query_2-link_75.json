        "text": "Take offs and landings 16: Helgoland Dune, Germany, Europe The sixteenth video from the Take offs and landings videoseries shows landing at Helgoland Dune Airport, Germany.\n\nGermany, Helgoland Dune EDXH - Landing\n\nGermany, Helgoland Dune EDXH - Departure\n\nHelgoland Dune Airport (EDXH) - landing and take off\n\nHelgoland is actually an archipelago consisting of two islands – Helgoland and Dune. The airport of Helgoland is located on the smaller one – Dune. From here you travel to the main island by a small ferryboat. Except for the airport and a nearby camping site, the airport of Dune is almost deserted. The main island offers great walks and a romantic harbour, lots of WWII history a tax-free cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nLanding at Helgoland airport may be a bit tricky due to frequent high winds. The airport is therefore limited only to pilots with at least 100 hours as PIC. To reach the archipelago you need some 20 minutes of flight from the German coast. The airport itself is friendly – it offers a parking zone, Avgas 100, snacks and its landing charges are reasonable. On departure I had a near miss with quite a big seagull which nearly hit my pitot tube. You can see that on our video.\n\n» Follow our other information for flying in Germany and visit our section Fly Europe.\n\nTake offs and landings video series Our new video series „Take offs and landings“ will bring to you every Wednesday one video taken during a take off or landing during one of Flying Revue flight expeditions. Flying Revue expedition aircraft have landed already at more than 400 airports and airfields around the globe. For many reasons, not all our take offs and landings have been videoed. However, the number of videos which we have on file is permanently growing. So the new video series „Take offs and landings“ is very well stocked. You can watch these videos free of charge either just for your interest or as part of preparations for your own flight to some of the airports shown in these series.\n\n» Helgoland Dune Airport EDXH, Germany, Europe\n\n» Skyvector.com » Actually traffic FlightRadar24.com » Website\n\nSource: Maps.google.com\n\nGeneral Info:\n\nCountryGermanyICAO IDEDXHTimeUTC+1(+2DT)Latitude54.185225\n\n54° 11' 6.81\" NLongitude7.915737\n\n7° 54' 56.65\" EElevation20 feet\n\n6 metersTypePublicMagnetic Variation0° West\n\nCommunication:\n\nHELGOLAND VOR-DME116.30\n\nRunways:\n\nID\n\n(Click for details.)DimensionsSurface15/331267 x 95 feet\n\n386 x 29 metersCONCRETE03/211162 x 65 feet\n\n354 x 20 mCONCRETE06/24845 x 40 feet\n\n257 x 12 m CONCRETE\n\nSource: WorldAeroData.com, Airportnavfinder.com, Skyvector.com\n\n-fr-"
