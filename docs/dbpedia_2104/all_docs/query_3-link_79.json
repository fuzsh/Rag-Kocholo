        "text": "During our last podcast Rob and I mentioned the fixes that Mr Johns took as the Campbell crew flew between East Kirkby and the coast near Worthing. Given that we all might have a bit more spare time than usual at the moment I thought I’d look at hyperbolic navigation, a subject that I have been meaning to explore for some months, but given the trauma I recall from having to learn this stuff in the RAF, and again for my professional airline licences, it’s a subject I approach with some caution.\n\nMuch like our ‘doing calculus in the cupboard under the stairs’ blog post, I fear this this might be a long haul, but useful, as again it shows that despite the popular conception of aircrew as silk scarfed heroes wheeling and dodging through a wall of flak, the reality was, and is, that flying a large combat aircraft is a technically complex discipline which requires effective teamwork, attention to detail, and an almost a superhuman ability to concentrate on maths and physics when the world the other side of a couple of millimetres of aluminium had gone utterly mad.\n\nOne Night In December.\n\nAs he progressed southward Mr Johns found that he was consistently to the left of track. The wind was either stronger than forecast or had a more pronounced westerly component, and the heading that he had passed to Campbell as they climbed away from the runway at East Kirkby had allowed for an insufficient drift angle. To determine this error over a blacked out countryside, remember he couldn’t see any ground features from inside his nav compartment, we think Mr Johns used an electronic device called Gee.\n\nGee was not the first radio navigation aid to be used by Bomber Command, if you recall, we have explored the Non Directional Beacon in a previous blog post, however when introduced to the main force in 1942 Gee constituted a huge leap forward. Rather than giving the Navigator a line on which he was situated, somewhere, the Gee system told him that he was on a certain intersection in a grid, a set of U shaped position lines superimposed upon a map which looked rather like a wonky chessboard or the rings in a strange shaped tree. This system may appear primitive to us now, but given the first electronic calculator was still more than twenty years away, it was a remarkable achievement. So how did it work ?\n\nHyperbolics.\n\nModern day GPS navigation works by comparing a series of time stamped signals sent from atomic clocks attached to satellites in orbit. As we know that these signals travel at the speed of light (approximately) it is a simple schoolboy exercise to work out when they were sent, when they were received, and, by triangulation, determine an accurate position on earth.\n\nHowever without the availability of an independent time reference, such as that provided by an atomic clock, a relative one has to be created; and that’s the clever part of hyperbolic nav, it doesn’t rely on elapsed time, it uses the difference in time. So before we go into the nav part, let’s have a quick refresher on hyperbolae.\n\nA hyperbola is not a line of equal distance, but rather a line of equal difference between two fixed points that are connected via a base line. Take for example the diagram below, the points A and B are 100nm apart and connected by an imaginary line AB. A simple hyperbola, a straight line perpendicular to the base line and intersecting it at 50nm could be labelled 0nm, i.e. regardless of the actual distance from A and B at all points on that vertical line, the difference in distance between A and B is 0nm. This zero difference point is the only straight hyperbola.\n\nIn this next example the difference is +20, i.e. the points on the dashed line are always 20nm closer to A than B. Note that the hyperbolae now start to bend concave to the focal point.\n\nIn the final example an entire family of hyperbolae are drawn, as before only one is a straight line, 0nm, those closest to the points of focus bend more and more to form a distinctive U shape. If you have a look at the chart at the top of the page you will notice that hyperbola like these are printed in green, red and purple.\n\nMilitary use.\n\nThe first modern military use of hyperbolae was by the French and British armies in World War One, however not for navigation, rather it was for artillery spotting.\n\nThe problem the soldiers faced was not to work out where their own guns were, they probably knew where some of them were some of the time, but rather to locate enemy artillery positions when it was too dangerous or too cloudy to use observation balloons or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nInitially the allies tried to use a simple time and distance method. At the beginning of the war artillery spotters were told to find a hill, sit on it, and then take a bearing on the muzzle flash of any enemy gun in view using a surveying compass. A colleague was detailed to measure the length of time it took for the sound of the firing to arrive with a stopwatch. As might be anticipated this proved very inefficient, firstly there was rarely only one gun firing at a time, so it was almost impossible to determine which flash corresponded to which bang, and secondly, in order to see the opponent’s muzzle flash the observer, by definition, had to be in clear sight of the enemy guns. A situation which, especially on the Western front, offered profoundly limited career opportunities.\n\nThe Germans persevered with this system, or one using large ear trumpets, throughout the war, however the Allies soon looked for a remotely operated technological solution.\n\nThe French made the first important development. Lucien Bull a physician who was attempting to record heartbeats, and Charles Nordmann an astronomer at the Paris Observatory, took a string galvanometer and adapted it to record signals from microphones onto photographic films. In doing so they had managed to produce the first accurate pictorial record of noise. This was impressive in itself, however their idea was that if two films of the same gunshot were compared, then the difference in time between the sound reaching each of two separate microphones could be plotted as a hyperbola. If they could do this, then it followed that the enemy gun had to be on that line somewhere.\n\nA set of observations from another pair of microphones listening to the same gun would produce another hyperbola. In theory the intersection of these hyperbolae would lie directly on the enemy position. The process wasn’t quick, processing the film took quite a long time, however as artillery of this period didn’t move too much this wasn’t a huge problem. What was a problem was wind noise, operator error, and simple fact that the apparatus could not run continuously due to the vast expenditure of film. As good as it was, it didn’t work in bad weather, it was complicated, and any German barrage had to be anticipated in advance.\n\nFew of the senior French commanders placed much faith in it, but the British remained convinced that sound ranging was the answer to their artillery spotting problems, and gave the project to an Australian scientist, Sir William Bragg, who at 25 years of age was, and is still, the youngest ever Nobel Laureate.\n\nThe first thing Bragg realised was that the nature of gun sounds had not at all been understood by the French. In particular, he said, renewed care needed to be taken to separate the bang of the gun from the sonic boom of the shell.\n\nGiven the deafening cacophony of noise in the trenches it was initially thought this challenge would prove insurmountable, but the problem was solved during the summer of 1916 by William Sansome Tucker. Tucker was in his late 30s and serving in Belgium as a Lance Corporal in the Territorial Army. A low rank despite, somewhat incongruously, holding a physics doctorate from Imperial and having been a senior lecturer in the Science and Research Department of the University of London.\n\nTucker and his small team of so called ‘London Electricians’ worked on the problem night and day, and within a few weeks they had managed to construct the world’s first low-frequency microphone. Specifically Tucker found that an electrically heated platinum wire strung across a suitable aperture (initially an army issue rum flask, but later a wooden ammunition box) would be cooled by a fraction of a degree when it encountered the sound wave of a gun firing. This cooling changed the electrical resistance in the wire, and as this was a direct function of the wavelength of the sound, they could select the frequency that wanted to detect by changing the length of the wire.\n\nDespite some initial skepticism a series of trials indicated that the phenomenon was sufficiently predictable for it to be measured and placed on a timeline. This was a huge breakthrough, for the first time it was possible to separate the boom from the bang.\n\nWithin weeks a portable detection system had been produced, and the British found that by arranging a series of remote microphones along a trench line, often several miles apart, a skilled operator could quickly and accurately determine the source of enemy gunfire and plot it on a hyperbolic chart. Although the wires were often severed in bombardments and infantry raids, there was no longer a need to send spotters crawling out to exposed positions, and valuable aerial reconnaissance sorties could be re-tasked.\n\nThe first practical use of sound ranging equipment was by Commander Alfred Rawlinson of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, who in the autumn of 1916 was commanding a mobile anti-aircraft battery on the east coast of England. He listened not to the firing of guns but the hum of aero-engines, and although no hits were obtained by this method, Rawlinson claimed to have forced German Zeppelins to jettison their bombs before reaching their intended targets.\n\nWe will never know whether this was the case, however by the end of the war, the Bragg-Tucker system had been developed by the British Army to the extent that not only could the source of enemy gunfire be determined before the barrage had even finished, but that it was also possible to identify the calibre of the enemy’s gun, and on a good day, even surmise his intended target. A level of technological sophistication that would have been unthinkable four years before.\n\nThe need for artillery spotting was greatly reduced between the wars, the European powers generally fought police actions against poorly equipped colonial subjects. However much of the hard theory had been done, and by the mid 1930s the technology was lifted, in some sense turned upside down, and used for the first time as an aid to aerial navigation.\n\nHyperbolic navigation.\n\nThe aim of the initial project was to provide a blind landing system for RAF aircraft returning to base in bad weather. In October 1937, Robert Dippy, working at Robert Watson-Watt’s radar laboratory at RAF Bawdsey in Suffolk, suggested using two antennae positioned about 10 miles apart on either side of a runway. A transmitter midway between the two would send a common signal over transmission lines to the two antennas, which ensured that both would broadcast the signal at the same instant.\n\nIf the landing aircraft was properly lined up with the runway, the signals would be received simultaneously and two points could be superimposed on a simple oscilloscope in the cockpit. If the aircraft were located off the extended centreline of the runway then one of the signals would be received before the other, and two distinct peaks would form on the display. By determining which signal was being received first, crews could determine that they were closer to that antenna than the other, and would be able to recapture the approach track by turning away from it until the signals were again superimposed.\n\nHowever this system, certainly in its early iterations, was too unwieldy for the fabric covered single seat fighters of the time; and given that the early RAF offensive doctrine was predicated on Douhet’s idea of daylight formations of mutually supporting light bombers operating in good weather, the Air Ministry couldn’t really envisage a practical use for it.\n\nThat changed shortly after the start of the war. Shambles like the attack on the German Navy in Heligoland Bight, when the RAF lost 12 of the 22 Wellingtons dispatched in one afternoon; and catastrophes such as the attack on the German Army at Sedan, where of the 71 bombers the RAF dispatched, 44 were lost in less than a hour, forced the RAF to revert to night bombing, something they had abandoned as impractical in the mid 1930s.\n\nThankfully the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Swanage had found the range of the transmitters used in the landing trial was well above the 10 miles or so considered necessary to make a safe approach. When they started work on a hyperbolic navigation system the TRE found that Dippy had anticipated this finding and had already started to plan out an effective system.\n\nInitially he had simply wanted to produce navigation charts which not only illustrated the line of zero-difference, where the blips were superimposed as in the landing system, but also a line where the pulses were received 1μs apart, and another for 2μs and so on. The result would be a series of lines arranged at right angles to the line between the two stations. Dippy suggested that a second set of transmitters would give an intersection of hyperbolae, much like the artillery spotters used in the trenches, but, in this case, at the aircraft’s own position rather than that of the enemy.\n\nDippy also noted that the station in the centre could be used as one side of both pairs of transmitters if they were arranged like an L. An additional, but increasingly important, benefit would be that the system was passive. Unlike the H2S ground mapping radar which was being developed at the same time, there were no return signals which could give away the bomber’s position to night fighters. Baffled for a suitable name to call this system the team at Bawdsey eventually looked at the gridded lines on the charts and, for want of anything else, called it Gee, standing for the G in grid, and it stuck.\n\nSo how did this work ?\n\nThe Gee system was really just an improved version of Dippy’s original off centreline scheme. In the Gee configuration one of the stations would periodically send out a signal based on a very accurate electronic timer, and the other stations would be equipped with receivers listening for the signal arriving from the master station. When they received the signal, they would send out their own broadcasts. This would keep all the stations in synchronisation, without the need for a wire between them. During the Battle of Britain a stray German bomb had, by chance, cut the telephone cable carrying radar information from the Chain Home antennae on the coast to the control room at Uxbridge, and for several pretty fraught days Fighter Command were blind to Luftwaffe attacks forming up over Normandy. For obvious reasons the RAF did not want this to happen again.\n\nIt soon became clear that the optimal system would consist of a central master station and not two secondary stations in an L shape, but three, each about 100 miles away and arranged roughly 120 degrees apart, forming a large Y. The reason for this will become clear in a minute, but first, true to the spirit of One Night in December, we can’t just leave the theory there. To really understand what the Navigators were up to on the raid on Munich we will need to look at the maths in a bit more detail.\n\nIn the example below the master ground station is located at A and set up to transmit a regular set of electronic pulses. An aircraft, for example a Lancaster at point L, would receive these pulses a certain time after transmission. If we term the velocity of electromagnetic waves through the atmosphere (approximately 186,000 miles per second) as v, we can easily determine the time (t1) taken for a pulse to travel from to the aircraft through the formula:\n\nSuppose now that at the same time the pulse from A is picked up at a second station situated at B, and that this second station itself transmits a pulse after a definite and closely monitored time delay called T. Then, if we count the time at which A transmits as an origin for time reference, it follows that the Lancaster at L will receive the pulse from B after a time interval (t2) which can be calculated as:\n\nThus we can say that t2 is made up of three components, and will always be a greater value than t1.\n\nThe time of travel from A to B.\n\nThe fixed delay introduced at B, which we term T.\n\nThe time of travel from B to the Lancaster, L.\n\nGiven that A to B is known, and v is a constant, and the equipment on the ground holds the fixed time delay T constant (this was cutting edge kit in 1940s) then the time LB – AB can also be calculated. This is in effect a measure of the time difference between the arrival of the A and B pulses, i.e. the quantity t2 – t1. Bingo !\n\nAs we have seen, the best way to display this information would be on a chart with the various hyperbolae corresponding to different path differences. As each of the curves are labelled with what is essentially the appropriate t2 – t1 value. All then the navigator had to do was to measure t2 – t1, and this will immediately enable him to fix himself along one or other of the curves in the system.\n\nThe process repeated for another station, A to C for example, would give another hyperbola, the intersection of which would give the navigator his position, as shown below.\n\nNow back to the Y shape. For a Navigator to obtain an accurate fix it is necessary to introduce another slave station, called the D or D* (star) which broadcast a similar, but double pulse. This is for two reasons, firstly because if extended far enough then each of the hyperbole cross at two points. For most of the time it will be obvious to the Navigator which intersection is correct, however under some circumstances, especially when flying close to a station this may not be quite so clear; and secondly because some of the hyperbolae run almost parallel to each other the intersection as printed on a chart could be quite long. In some conditions by changing to intersection AD rather rather than AB a cross cut closer to 90 degrees and therefore more accurate fix can be obtained.\n\nLastly we should note that because the range of available frequencies was limited, and confusion between chains might occur, an additional A signal, called A2 or A Ghost was broadcast at set intervals so that the Navigator could identify the chain into which he was tuned.\n\nThe Gee system in use.\n\nThe first Gee chain, the so called Eastern Chain, was set up to project signals into Holland, Belgium and northern Germany. The master transmitter was at Daventry in Northamptonshire, and the slaves sited at Clee Hill in Shropshire, Stenigot in Lincolnshire, Gibbet Hill in Warwickshire and Hindhead in Surrey. The monitoring station was at Great Bromley in Essex. By the time of our raid in December 1944 other chains had been installed in the UK, and three additional chains had been set up in liberated Europe, one in Rheims in France, one in Foggia in Italy, and the other in Louvain, Belgium, however this was some years in the future … back to 1941.\n\nThe ability to receive the Gee signal would be limited by atmospheric attenuation, convective weather such as thunderstorms, and the curvature of the Earth. However the initial test went much better than expected and the signal proved usable to at least 300 miles at altitudes of 10,000 feet. On 15 May 1941 the engineers in a Wellington test aircraft were astonished to find that an experimental set provided an accurate fix at a range of over 400 miles.\n\nAt this point the system was cleared for trials over enemy occupied Europe. On the night of 11th /12th of August two aircraft bombed using Gee coordinates only and delivered “uncanny accuracy”. However, on the very next night on a raid to Hanover, a Gee equipped Vickers Wellington was lost. It seems astonishing, but the designers hadn’t thought to fit a self destruct system to the receiver, and so the RAF had to assume that a working set had fallen into German hands. Operational testing was immediately suspended.\n\nOver the next few weeks the the British used double agents to trick the Germans into thinking that the Gee system operated in the same way as the German navigation system X-Gerat, and hopefully send them off looking for a single targeted beam. This appears to have been partially successful, however before long the RAF started to encounter some jamming on the Gee frequencies. The RAF must have been very disappointed, through a schoolboy error on their part they were only two sorties into the programme and the cat was already out of the bag.\n\nThe first operational mission using Gee took place on the night of 8th / 9th of March 1942, when 200 aircraft attacked Essen. Gee was installed on a Wellington of No. 115 Squadron from RAF Watton captained by Pilot Officer Jack Foster, who later said, “targets were found and bombed as never before”. In total, 33% of the aircraft reached the target area, as Pete and myself discussed in a podcast, this was an enormous advance over earlier results.\n\nThe first completely successful Gee led attack was carried out on the night of the 13th / 14th March 1942 against Cologne. The leading crews successfully illuminated the target with flares and incendiaries and the bombing was generally accurate. Bomber Command calculated that this attack was five times more effective than the earlier raid on the city. The success of Gee led to a change in policy, Air Marshall Harris selected 60 German cities that were within Gee range, and ordered that they be targeted for mass bombing using 1,800 tons of bombs per city.\n\nA new model called Gee Mk II was introduced in early 1943 in an effort to counter the increasingly effective German jamming. In these sets some components could be swapped by the Navigator in flight to provide a range of operational frequencies. It was a temporary solution to what would be a nagging problem throughout the war.\n\nSo how did it appear to Mr Johns ?\n\nFirstly, in addition to the main route chart that Pete has of this raid on Munich, each of the Navigators flying that night would have carried a separate Gee chart. These charts had hyperbolae colour coded and superimposed upon some basic topographical features and the normal latitude and longitude grid.\n\nThe chart Mr Johns used on these first two legs would have looked exactly like this.\n\nOn board the aircraft, the signals received from the ground stations were processed and sent to the A-type oscilloscope display. It looks primitive now, but this was expensive and very high tech for the time. Pete and I saw one in action at the museum at Pitstone shortly after we started this project.\n\nOn board the aircraft an internal oscillator of much less complexity than the one at the master station was used to trigger the display sweep on a 4 inch oscilloscope. When first activated, it would be unlikely to have exactly the same timing as the master station, so the Navigator would see a repeating pattern of blips traveling rapidly across the screen. A control knob was then used to tune the local oscillator frequency until the blips on the display stopped moving, which meant the local and master oscillators now had the same timing.\n\nThe pulses had a repetition frequency of four milliseconds, so in order to obtain greater resolution, and hence accuracy, the trace was divided into two. Therefore the Gee display also included a separate control unit to control the second line on the lower portion of the screen. This was set up in the same fashion as the top line, but this time the Navigator would delay the signal so that the A2 (or A Ghost) signal was placed on the extreme left and the double D signal on the right.\n\nThe sweep of the beam across the display was initially set to 1/10 the basic frequency of the local oscillator, so approximately five complete signal chains would be seen on the display. Once the Navigator had tuned the frequency so the image was frozen, he activated a switch to increase the beam speed 10 times. This reduced the amount of the signal display on the display to one complete A to D cycle.\n\nSignals from different chains were closely spaced in frequency, close enough that the wide-band R1355 receiver would often tune in more than one chain at a time. Hence, as we have said, the importance of the A2 signal. After the display was stabilised so the pulse trains were appearing in a single location on the screen, the A2 pulses could be seen blinking on and off with a set pattern – thus “ghosting” on the display. This allowed the operator to determine the identity of the master signal, and thus select the chain they wanted to use by positioning its associated “ABD” signal on the left.\n\nOnce these initial setup steps were completed the upper line displayed the “ABD” signal, and the lower the “ACD”. It looked something like this:\n\nSadly however the signals received were never perfect. Atmospheric and aerial imperfections caused the blips to wander, and so it proved impossible to keep a received pulse exactly stationary on the trace for any length of time. Therefore Navigators had to use a differential method to get accurate results. In practice this meant that they had to artificially speed up (i.e. strobe) the signal in the x, i.e horizontal, axis, so that the A and the B and C or double D blip appeared directly above each other. The example below for instance would require some fine tuning in order to get the pulses vertically in line and directly on top of one another.\n\nThe areas of the trace which were available for strobing were only the first 66 microseconds for the A and A2, so the left edge of the trace, and a selectable portion of 66 microseconds on the trace for the B, C, and D signal. It required a steady hand and patience.\n\nAfter this was achieved the Navigator could throw away (metaphorically speaking) the trace, and replace it with a graduated scale by activating a so called Clearing switch. Amongst other things this switch removed the raw signals from the screen and replaced them with precision calibration markers derived from the crystal oscillator. The blips would now be inverted and project below the reference line.\n\nIt took skill to manipulate the signal effectively, this was, as is so often the case, an art form as much as a science. As Professor Norman Groom said (remember him) “The concept of Gee is very clever, but the concept of measuring the time difference between pair of pulses to an accuracy in the order of 0.1%, given the technology then available, is brilliant. All that was available was a six inch CRT with a usable four inch trace, a tube who’s deflection was not necessarily linear and a timebase that may also not perfectly linear. The only item with any precision was the onboard crystal controlled oscillator”.\n\nWith this completed the values could at last be carefully applied to the chart to give a Gee fix. This in turn could be converted into a lat and long, which in turn again could be applied to the master chart.\n\nAll well and good, but bizarrely, I found a short sentence buried in a page of text of the original RAF training manual from which I have taken much of this information that caught my eye. It simply states\n\n“care must be exercised in determining the whole numbers in the fix. Sometimes the whole number wanted is the one within the strobe marker; and sometimes the one to the left.” …\n\nAnd that’s it … no explanation, no guidance, no reason. After several dozen pages of maths and physics (I have spared you most of the sums) just that simple disclaimer. One whole number out would make rather a lot of difference when running up to a heavily defended target, or when trying to nurse a damaged aircraft back from a raid ! We need another trip to the signals museum at RAF Henlow to find out more.\n\nLastly just a word on the context. I think we should bear in mind that the Nav had to do all this whilst sitting on an hard aluminium stool behind a blackout curtain, breathing bottled air through an oxygen mask, and in a temperature far colder than the inside of your domestic freezer. It required immense concentration and attention to detail. There are a few minor errors in Mr Johns’s chart work, but as Rob (an ex F4 Phantom Nav) has mentioned, we should also remember that he didn’t have much time to do this. All of his other deduced reckoning calculations such as finding the wind, calculating the ground speed, drift and fuel burn still needed to be performed in his 6 minute cycle, i.e. every 1/10th of an hour, whether he was busy with the Gee set or not.\n\nWhen we also factor in the fact that the aircraft was not standing still as he did this, but rather flying around in the dark at around a mile every 20 seconds, and in all probability being buffeted by weather and corkscrewing violently to avoid the guns and fighters that were trying to shoot it down, it is an even more impressive achievement. I know the theory, but I really don’t know how these men managed to do it. Remarkable."
