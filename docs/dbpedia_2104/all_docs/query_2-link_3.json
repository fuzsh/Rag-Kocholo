        "text": "E16, Helgoland & DÃ¼ne\n\nHelgoland (Heligoland) is a piece of red rock in the North Sea, about 63 km (40 mi) to the northwest of Cuxhaven. The island is only 1.7 square-km (0.7 sq mi) in area with a population of about 1500. The neighbouring islet of DÃ¼ne was created when surge from the 1721 New Yearâ€™s Day storm submerged the land connection with Helgoland. Helgoland has the towering red cliffs; DÃ¼ne has lots of fine white sand.\n\nI made all images above with an iPhone15 on 24 May 2024. Listed times are in CEDT.
