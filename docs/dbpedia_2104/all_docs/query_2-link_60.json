Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe perceived humidity level in Helgoland, as measured by the percentage of time in which the humidity comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable, does not vary significantly over the course of the year, staying within 1% of 1% throughout.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Helgoland\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in HelgolandJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Mar 170%Mar 170%Aug 91%Aug 91%NowNowcomfortablecomfortabledrydryhumidhumid\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Helgoland typically lasts for 9.0 months (274 days), from around March 11 to around December 11, rarely starting before February 2 or after April 14, and rarely ending before November 11 or after January 5.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Helgoland\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Helgolandgrowing seasonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%50%Mar 1150%Mar 1150%Dec 1150%Dec 1190%Apr 1490%Apr 1490%Nov 1190%Nov 1110%Feb 210%Feb 210%Jan 510%Jan 5Jul 23100%Jul 23100%NowNowvery coldcoldcoolfreezing\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature.

Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy experiences extreme seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe brighter period of the year lasts for 3.5 months, from April 28 to August 12, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter above 5.2 kWh. The brightest month of the year in Helgoland is June, with an average of 6.3 kWh.\n\nThe darker period of the year lasts for 4.1 months, from October 21 to February 24, with an average daily incident shortwave energy per square meter below 1.6 kWh.

Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (177 feet). Within 50 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (256 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Helgoland is covered by water (96%), within 10 miles by water (100%), and within 50 miles by water (83%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Helgoland, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Helgoland.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Helgoland according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Helgoland is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Helgoland and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSea-Airport Cuxhaven/Nordholz (ETMN, 25%, 42 mi, southeast, -52 ft elevation change)\n\nWittmundhaven (ETNT, 23%, 45 mi, south, -102 ft elevation change)\n\nJever (ETNJ, 23%, 45 mi, south, -102 ft elevation change)\n\nWesterland / Sylt (EDXW, 17%, 54 mi, north, -75 ft elevation change)\n\nEggebek (ETME, 13%, 66 mi, northeast, -59 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Helgoland and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
