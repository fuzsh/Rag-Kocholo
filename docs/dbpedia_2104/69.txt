Then came the gallant rescue, which almost cost him his life, of three drowning tailors whose boat had upset in the sea near Heligoland. For that and his victory over the American yacht Defender, C.C.I., the Emperor forgave him and placed him in control of the new aeronautic arm of the German forces.

On March 16, L4063 was sent up on a routine patrol flight over Heligoland Bight; these missions were intended to deter the Luftwaffe from flying mine-laying sorties.

If the ships were not handed over, the allies had the right to occupy Heligoland as a base to enforce the terms of the Armistice.

A Heligoland card of 1889 is considered the first multi-colored card ever printed.

He is the author of four books that include Britain's Economic Blockade of Germany in World War I and The Battle of Heligoland Bight.

The Queen Mary's inaugural action came in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914 - the first sea battle of World War I.

During the second battle of Heligoland Bight, Carless's ship, HMS Caledon, led the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron which was attempting to cut off and destroy German minesweepers.

But the papers show he thought it was all over for himself as enemy fire crippled the Blenheim bomber he was piloting during an air raid on Heligoland in 1941.

Meredith adds that Britain traded the North Sea island of Heligoland with the Germans for Zanzibar, and parts of northern Nigeria with the French for fishing rights off Newfoundland.

For Tirpitz, England was, from the beginning, "the most dangerous naval enemy," against which Germany "most urgently required a certain measure of naval force as a political power factor." Since Tirpitz considered cruiser warfare a lost cause, owing to Germany's lack of naval bases, he asked for the buildup of a fleet that "can unfold its greatest military potential between Heligoland and the Thames."
