Celebrating 100 Years of a Screen Legend

ANTHONY QUINN: A 100 YEAR LEGACY is a year-long focus by the Flickers: Rhode Island International Film Festival (RIIFF) on the art, history and film of legendary actor, Anthony Quinn presented in collaboration with the RI Film and Television Office and the Anthony Quinn Foundation. Running through November 2015, this special program will include free screenings of his films at libraries across the state with a curated monthly series; scholarly monographs; panel discussions with film and history scholars; special breakout screenings of signature films, a student essay contest (high school and college) on the legacy of this seminal artist and a video competition geared for area college students to recreate a scene from one of five films that will be showcased: La Strada, Lust for Life, Requiem for a Heavyweight, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Guns of Navarone.

There have been a select few Latino actors who broke the barrier of language and stereotypes to make their way in the United States, paving the way for new generations of actors like Javier Bardem or Antonio Banderas. Perhaps the most notable was the magnificent Anthony Ruldolph Oaxaca Quinn, born on April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico who became a Hispanic legend, managing to get from a humble beginning in Mexico to the most glittering reputation in Hollywood.

He was the son of Francisco Quinn, of half Irish and half Mexican origin, and Manuela Oaxaca, Mexican descendant of Nahua. At an early age, his family moved to Texas and Quinn had to start working. In 1936, Quinn made the leap into the acting profession. That year he had a role in the play Clean Beds with Mae West and appeared in the film Parole! This opened the door to other film roles, often playing the part of the bad guy.

Quinn did some of his finest film work in the 1950s and 1960s. He played Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata (1952), a performance that won him the Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role. Quinn received that same honor again in 1956 for his portrayal of the painter Paul Gauguin in Lust for Life with Kirk Douglas. He was also nominated for Best Actor in 1957 for Wild Is the Wind and in 1964 for Zorba the Greek. Quinn achieved box-office success with starring roles in The Guns of Navarone (1961) with Gregory Peck and David Niven and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) with Peter O'Toole.

More than 35 films will be screened along with the Anthony Quinn Centenary being a focus at the upcoming Flickers produced Roving Eye International Film Festival, April 12-19; KidsEye Summer Filmmaking Camp, July 6-10th; the Rhode Island International Film Festival, August 4-9th; and the Vortex Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror Film Festival, October 19-25th.

Programming will begin March 19th and run through November 14th.
