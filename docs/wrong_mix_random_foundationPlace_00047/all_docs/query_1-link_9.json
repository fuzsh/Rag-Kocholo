Your degree from The University of Texas is a significant accomplishment and, today, you will be awarded a well-earned UT diploma.\n\nAt one of the top universities in the world, you studied with amazing professors, learned alongside brilliant students, and challenged yourself and others. Your diploma is a symbol of academic success, but it represents much more; it connects you to your time on the Forty Acres, while linking you to Longhorn Nation forever. Remember the friendships, the mentors, and the experiences that shaped you. Carry these memories with you as you embark on the journey ahead and rely on your ability to do great and hard things. It is your turn to change the world!\n\nClass of 2024, your perseverance is second to none, and the entire Longhorn community compliments you on your steadfastness and tenacity. Despite all the elements outside of your control, you emerged stronger and wiser. I extend my deepest congratulations to each of you, and please know that I am proud of you!\n\nHook 'em Horns!\n\nJay C. Hartzell, President, The University of Texas at Austin\n\nDear Graduates,\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou've made it to the end. We're so proud of you. Your family and friends are so proud of you.\n\nIn the College of Liberal Arts, we pride ourselves on introducing our studetnts to the hardest and most important questions about the world and how we live in it. What is the good life? What is the structure of society? How is power attained and distributed? What is the human mind? What is language? How do people live together in a complex society? What happens when they fail to do so?\n\nOur goal is to help equip you with the skills and knowledge you'll need to continue answering these questions as an adult. I say “continue” because your presence here at commencement means that you’ve already acquired so much knowledge and so many essential skills. You’re already quite accomplished at wrestling with the big questions.\n\nBut there is so much more to learn. So many new things to encounter and master. You will struggle. You will often fail. I can’t promise you that we’ve given you all or even most of the answers. What you’ve built here, though, is a strong foundation. You’ve proven that you can handle challenge and difficulty and complexity. You’ve proven that you can fail and grow and then succeed. You’ve proven that you can handle the real world. You can flourish in it.\n\nI wish you the best as you continue to do so.\n\nHook ‘em,\n\nAnn Huff Stevens, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts\n\nTony C.

Elliott was the lead developer of the paper’s election forecasting models, including for the US and several European and South American countries.\n\nElliott is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin (2018), where he majored in Government and History and minored in Computer Science.

Her research examines how marginalized communities experience, navigate, and respond to institutions like the U.S. criminal justice system. Her passion for research and teaching is rooted in her lived experience. Witnessing several family members navigate the criminal justice system made her keenly aware of the relationship between individual agency and structure and influenced her perception of education as a vehicle to increase awareness of social problems and provide people with tools to develop and enact solutions. Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and the Austin Branch of the American Association of University Women.

Able to speak Farsi and engage meaningfully with Afghan culture, Pourebrahim designed and facilitated culturally adapted cancer education workshops for Afghan refugee women in Austin. Collaborating with the Livestrong Cancer Institute, she is coordinating free mammograms and pap-smears for the women she's guided for the past year.
