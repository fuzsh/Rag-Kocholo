        "text": "\"There was that gut feeling that was starting to grow more and more.\"\n\nOK, so y'all know Anna Faris — actor, author, podcast host extraordinaire.\n\nYesterday, Anna interviewed tattoo artist Kat Von D on her podcast, Unqualified, where Kat spilled lots of tea about her cheating exes.\n\nAnd in the course of the conversation, Anna admitted that one of her exes cheated too — although she did not name any names.\n\n\"I remember suspecting an ex of cheating on me,\" she revealed. \"I woke him up in the middle of the night and I was like, 'Are you fucking so-and-so?'\"\n\n\"And he was like, 'You're crazy.'\"\n\nAnna says she decided to trust him, despite a \"gut feeling\" telling her otherwise:\n\nOf course I don't want to believe that anything [is going on]. But there was that gut feeling that was starting to grow more and more.\n\nUnfortunately, she didn't get confirmation of the cheating until after they split, when some mutual friends told her the truth.\n\nAnd Anna said it was a fear of seeming \"crazy\" that stopped her from trusting her gut in the first place:\n\nI do think as women we're sort of taught to suppress fear or suspicion because we might be deemed as suspicious or neurotic or crazy or whatever. So I think that in my case I was like, \"OK, maybe he's right. Maybe I am crazy.\"\n\nAnna is currently dating — and possibly engaged to — cinematographer Michael Barrett, but she's had some high-profile relationships in the past. From 2004 to 2008, she was married to actor Ben Indra.\n\nAnd, of course, she was famously married to Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2017.\n\nThey announced their split in August 2017, and fans were caught very much off guard by the news.\n\nYou can listen to the full Unqualified episode here.\n\nShare This Article"
