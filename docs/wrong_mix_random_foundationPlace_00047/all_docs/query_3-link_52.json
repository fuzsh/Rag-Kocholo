        "text": "This week on Theater Talk, Anthony and Peter talk about the summer season. The Chautauqua Theater Company has begun with a stunning production of BIRTHDAY CANDLES, a play workshopped at CTC that has gone on to success in other venues and is now \"back home,\" all part of Chautauqua Institution's 150th anniversary. It's the last weekend to see the first of this summer's two Shakespeare in Delaware Park plays - THE WINTER'S TALE - and then, while they're setting up for THE COMEDY OF ERRORS on the main stage, the traveling show A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S TOUR is coming to a venue near you (see listings below). O'Connell & Company has a new version of THE GOLDEN GIRLS, done in drag, which continues to delight audiences. And opera is back at Artpark in Lewiston with PUCCINI’S GREATEST: A GALA OPERA CONCERT, conducted by Gil Rose with the Buffalo Philharmonic, a chorus, and soloists up from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. ***NOTE*** Bellissima Productions at the Allendale Theater (Theater of Youth) has delayed by one week ALICE BY HEART, set in the London \"tubes\" during the WWII blitz. The musical will now open on July 18.\n\nThe Shaw Festival is more than up and running, with many shows near capacity at the three main theaters (Festival, Royal George, and Jackie Maxwell) plus shows such as THE SHAW VARIETY SHOW in their \"Spiegeltent.\"\n\nSee the Artie Award winners below and see the Artie nominees below that.\n\nCheck out Anthony's reviews and Javier's \"On the Boards\" at theatertalkbuffalo.com for more details!\n\nPeter's reviews appear in Buffalo Rising (buffalorising.com).\n\nCOVID and the flu are still affecting theatrical performers (and audiences... that's us!) so it's worth getting your COVID booster, both readily available at pharmacies everywhere. Did you know that, for your convenience, you can get your COVID booster AND your flu shot simultaneously, and if your age qualifies, you can also get your RSV vaccine with those other two. After Anthony told Peter that he \"doubled up\" then Peter \"tripled up\" and you can too!\n\nLOCAL LISTINGS ARE PRESENTED AS FOLLOWS: CLOSINGS (last chances to see these plays), then OPENINGS, followed by CONTINUING, followed by COMING IN MAY. Within the categories, shows are alphabetical by title, with any show starting with \"The\" under the letter \"T.\"\n\nCLOSING:\n\nPUCCINI’S GREATEST: A GALA OPERA CONCERT, conducted by Gil Rose with the Buffalo Philharmonic, a chorus, soloists up from the Met in New York City, three-time Grammy Award-winning Soprano Latonia Moore, along with Baritone Michael Chioldi, Tenor Gregory Turay, Soprano Kristin Sampson, Soprano Tatev Baroyan and Tenor Dominick Chenes one show only Sunday, July 14 at 2 pm on the Artpark Main Stage in Lewiston, NY\n\n_____\n\nTHE WINTER'S TALE, by Shakespeare, directed by Kate Powers, starring Todd Benzin, VerNia Garvin, Jake Hayes, Daniel Lendzian, Gabriella McKinley, Kate Olena, Annette Daniels Taylor, and many others, presented by Shakespeare in Delaware Park. 6/20-7/14 6 days a week, Tue - Sun, except Monday, performances begin at 7:00. All performances are FREE, non-ticketed and open to the public, with donations gratefully accepted during intermission. Seating is not provided. Guests are encouraged to bring blankets or chairs and to picnic on “Shakespeare Hill,” near the Rose Garden / Marcy Casino in Delaware Park.\n\nTHE WINTER'S TALE explores platonic love, romantic love, & parental love, and the way that sudden jealousy can endanger all these kinds of connection. Without provocation, King Leontes suspects his pregnant wife, Queen Hermione, of having an affair with his childhood friend, King Polixenes. He exiles his baby daughter and puts his wife on trial. The Winter’s Tale asks, what do we do AFTER the unspeakable thing has taken place? How do we rebuild community in the wake of a tragedy?\n\n_____\n\nOPENING:\n\nALICE BY HEART DELAYED ONE WEEK ***NEW DATES***\n\nWHEN: July 18-20 & 25-27 at 7:30pm - Doors at 7:15pm\n\nJuly 21 & 28 at 3:00pm - Doors at 2:45pm\n\nALICE BY HEART, a musical by Steven Sater, Duncan Sheik, and Jessie Nelson, starring Madeline Rehm as \"Alice,\" Quinn McGillion as Alfred/White Rabbit, and many others. 7/18 - 7/28 Thu - Sat 7:30; Sun 3:00 at The Allendale Theatre/Theatre of Youth 203 Allen Street, Buffalo, NY 14201\n\nContent Warning: sexual references, depiction of violence, drug use, implied gun violence, serious illness and death\n\nALICE BY HEART PUBLICITY BLURB: From the Tony and Grammy award-winning creators of Spring Awakening, Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik, and co-written by Jessie Nelson (Waitress), Alice by Heart is a touching musical inspired by Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.
