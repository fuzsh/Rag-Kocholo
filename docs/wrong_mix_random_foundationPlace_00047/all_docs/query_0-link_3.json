        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – The Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HHF) announced that Mexican Actor, Producer, Writer Eugenio Derbez will receive the Hispanic Heritage Award for Film at the 32nd Annual Hispanic Heritage Awards at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, on October 1, 2019. Derbez will join Boxing Champion Canelo Alvarez who will receive the Award for Sports.\n\nDerbez is recognized as one of the most influential creative forces to emerge from Latin America, and one of the most beloved and recognized actors in the Latinx community in the United States. Variety named Derbez as the most influential Hispanic male in the world, and he has been named the top social media influencer in Latin America for the previous two years with more than 37 million followers. As a movie star and producer, his last three starring vehicles have been box office hits.\n\nThe Hispanic Heritage Awards were created at the White House in 1987 to commemorate the establishment of Hispanic Heritage Month in America and are considered among the highest honors by Latinos for Latinos and are supported by 40 national Hispanic-serving institutions.\n\nThe other 2019 will be announced over the summer followed by the performers, hosts and presenters. Sponsorship opportunities for the Hispanic Heritage Awards are available. Target is the Presenting Sponsor.\n\n“The Hispanic Heritage Foundation is thrilled to recognize the tremendous career and cultural impact of Eugenio Derbez who has also served to open doors for other Latinx in the entertainment industry,” said Jose Antonio Tijerino, President and CEO of HHF. “Eugenio’s work and influence are an example of the impact Latinxs on America and across the world.”\n\nBorn in Mexico City, Derbez is the son of legendary cinema and television actress, Sylvia Derbez. He began acting at the age of twelve. He holds a degree in film directing from the Mexican Institute of Cinematography and Theatre, as well as a degree in acting from Televisa’s Acting School. He has also studied and trained in dance and music, and has been able to showcase those talents in shows like Broadway’s “Latinologues” and Mexico City’s production of the musical, “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.”\n\nDerbez will next be seen in Paramount’s “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” releasing in theaters August 9 and will also be the voice of Glenn in Sony’s “The Angry Birds Movie 2” releasing August 14. Derbez most recently starred with Anna Faris in MGM / Lionsgate’s remake of the classic romantic comedy “Overboard.” The movie made nearly $100 million in box office worldwide. Derbez produced the movie through his banner, 3pas Studios. Prior to that he starred and produced “How to Be a Latin Lover” co-starring Salma Hayek, Rob Lowe, Kristen Bell, Raquel Welch. This followed his breakout success, the Spanish language dramedy, “Instructions Not Included,” which he not only directed but co-wrote. “Instructions” became the most successful Spanish-language film ever in the U.S. and worldwide, and broke numerous box office records, grossing over $100M.\n\nHe also appeared in Disney’s “The Nutcracker and the Four Realms” starring Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Morgan Freeman, and Sony’s, “Miracles From Heaven,” with Jennifer Garner. Amongst his many other credits, Derbez has also acted in several Adam Sandler films and has voiced characters on many animated features.\n\nFor over two decades, the TV shows he created and in which he starred – La Familia P Luche and “XHDRBZ” – have become part of the popular culture south of the border, with grand successes not only in Mexico, but also in the U.S. and throughout Latin America. His hosting duties on the Latin Grammys and the FIFA World Cup have drawn huge global audiences. Derbez has also hosted the Latin Grammys multiple times, where he drew tens of millions of viewers around the world. And, as a testament to his popularity and contributions to the arts in both languages, Derbez was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California in 2016.\n\nHis production company, 3pas Studios, has a deep slate of movies and television including “Y cómo es él?” starring Omar Chaparro and Mauricio Ochmann, currently in production as well. In Television, 3pas just produced and completed the second season of comedy reality competition show “LOL: Last One Laughing”, hosted by Derbez, for Amazon. LOL is one of Amazon’s most successful international shows to date. 3pas has set up projects at ABC, NBC, Hulu, E!, FX, Starz, Apple and more across all genres of television. 3pas has first look deals in both TV and Film with Lionsgate.\n\nPast Honorees of the Hispanic Heritage Awards have included Oscar de la Hoya, in addition to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Rita Moreno, Plácido Domingo, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Gloria Estefan, Oscar Hijuelos, Martin Sheen, Ricky Martin, Rubén Blades, Fania All-Stars, Junot Diaz, José Feliciano, Carlos Vives, Alejandro Sanz, Juanes, Antonio Banderas, Juan Luis Guerra, Anthony Quinn, J Balvin, Zoe Saldana, Juan Marichal, Los Tigres Del Norte, Oscar de la Renta, America Ferrera, Pedro Martinez, Luis Fonsi, Andy García, Gael Garcia Bernal, the Latin Grammys, Diego Luna, and others.\n\nAbout the Hispanic Heritage Foundation\n\nThe Hispanic Heritage Awards serve as a launch of HHF’s year-round, award-winning programs which inspire, prepare and connect Latino leaders in the classroom, community and workforce to meet America’s needs as well as promoting cultural pride.
