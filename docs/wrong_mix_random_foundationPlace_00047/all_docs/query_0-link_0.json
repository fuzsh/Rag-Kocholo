        "text": "Monday evening the crew and some cast of the FOX hit show \"Fringe\" filmed on Jervis St in Vancouver at an apartment building that was used in the past as the home of Fauxlivia from \"the other side\".\n\nThe scenes I saw were primarily John Noble (Walter) and Anna Torv (Olivia) getting out of a truck, walking up to the building, where they stop, have a chat before Olivia places Walter on a bench, then proceeds to go up the stairs, before Walter asks her for something (I believe it to be a cell phone) which she stops to hand him, them goes into the building.\n\nAt the end of their evening of filming, Anna stopped to sign autographs and take photos with fans, as well as some fans of Supernatural who were so impressed with him friendly and respectful the crew and cast were that they promised to give the show a chance.\n\nI will have another blog in the next day or so from the Tuesday set of Fringe shooting at the same location...with a LARGER spoiler. A Mighty Ducking big spoiler. So Pacey yourself for that. Wouldnt want you all Petered out by the time I post that.\n\nBelow is some of the pics from Mondays shoot. Apologies if some are a bit fuzzy/grainy. My camera was being quite unco-operative with me yesterday."
