        "text": "With our supporters donations and sponsorships the YMCA has been able to provide ample opportunities for our communities’ families and their children. Without their support we would not be able to provide for our community like we do.\n\nThe YMCA is a not-for-profit, four-star Charity Navigator organization. We put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all. When you give to the Y, you’re doing your part to strengthen our community. A strong community is good for everyone.\n\nThe Triangle Society is a giving society comprised of generous supporters who donate a total of $5,000 or more over three years to the YMCA Annual Campaign. These multi-year commitments raise the philanthropic standing of the YMCA in Central Indiana so the Y can better support active and healthier lives for all people in our diverse community.\n\nHeritage Club is an organization of people who have demonstrated their long-term interest and support of the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis by either a direct contribution to the Endowment Fund or by including the YMCA in their estate plans. The Club’s purpose is to encourage thoughtful gifts as a primary means of building a strong endowment capable of providing lasting support for the YMCA’s mission and to recognize members whose leadership, service and devotion to the YMCA have created this heritage."
