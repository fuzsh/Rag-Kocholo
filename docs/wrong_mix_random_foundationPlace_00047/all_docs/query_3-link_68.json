        "text": "The two injured men were identified as David Dutch and James Copenhaver\n\nThough a gunman failed to seriously wound Donald Trump, one person was killed and another two were critically injured in a shooting at the former president’s rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nShots rang out at the Saturday, June 13, rally in Butler, Pa., as Trump was speaking. Trump’s ear was injured as a result, but he was safely evacuated from the stage after what the FBI has called an “assassination attempt.”\n\nPennsylvania State Police identified the two rally-goers injured in the shooting as David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74. Authorities had previously identified the man killed as 50-year-old Corey Comperatore.\n\nBoth Dutch and Copenhaver are currently listed in “stable condition,” state police say.\n\n“These victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,” State Police Colonel Christopher Paris says in a statement. “The Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.”\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Speaks Out After Surviving Assassination Attempt: ‘I’m Not Supposed to Be Here’\n\nBoth men were taken to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh after the shooting, a spokesperson for the hospital previously told PEOPLE. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for an update.\n\nDutch’s sister, Jennifer Veri-Grazier, spoke to The New York Times, and said her brother, a former Marine, suffered damage to his liver and broken ribs and has required surgery.\n\n“He was exercising his rights and went to the rally, and he didn’t deserve any of this,” she told the paper.\n\nDutch is listed as a commandant with the Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania in Westmoreland County.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who Witnessed Trump Campaign Rally Shooting Says Unnamed Victim 'Killed Instantly': 'Direct Hit to the Head'\n\nThe Times reported that Copenhaver is married and has a son, citing friends. The 74-year-old also plays in a band and is retired, the paper reported.\n\nCopenhaver is on the Military Banner Committee in his hometown of Moon Township, Pa.\n\nAlbert Quaye, a Moon Township supervisor, told the Times that Copenhaver is a “healthy 74,” but did not have more information on his condition.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro ordered all flags on public buildings in the state to be flown at half-staff in honor of Comperatore and also offered his prayers to Dutch and Copenhaver, state police say.\n\nThe suspected shooter, who was killed by the Secret Service after firing several shots in the direction of Trump, has been identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
