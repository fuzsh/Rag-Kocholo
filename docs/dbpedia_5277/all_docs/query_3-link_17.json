        "text": "Who is eligible for the Fund?\n\nThe Fund is currently open to disabled writers, actors and academics (“Consultants”) who are currently working in the industry and/or who have film or television experience. See the Eligibility section of the Terms & Conditions for more information.\n\nHow do I get access to the Fund?\n\nConsultants who meet the eligibility requirements can become Approved Consultants by completing the application at inevitable.foundation/consultant-futures-apply.\n\nThis application asks for the following information:\n\nContact information\n\nInformation to verify basic eligibility\n\nDemographic information\n\nProfessional history\n\nAny relevant union and representative info\n\nInformation on prior consulting jobs\n\nA series of brief statements (each 100 words or less) regarding your creative career goals, your perspective on disability representation in the industry, your current projects, and a personal biography.\n\nOnce you are an Approved Consultant, you can quickly submit Qualified Consulting Offers for reimbursement.\n\nWhat type of consulting work is eligible to be reimbursed by the Fund?\n\nThe Fund is specifically focused on creative and story consulting—which is the job of writers, not consultants—on projects that lack disabled writers and directors. Accessibility consulting is not eligible for reimbursement because it is not a major practice that harms disabled writers. Work that the industry thinks is technical but is actually creative is eligible for reimbursement.\n\nInevitable Foundation reserves the right to determine eligibility at its sole discretion.\n\nWhat kind of projects are eligible to be reimbursed by the Fund?\n\nThe Fund will reimburse consulting offers for projects from industry-recognized production companies, studios, networks and streamers, in addition to individual professionals who are attached to/working for industry companies (a “Qualified Offeror”). See the Definitions section of the Terms & Conditions for more information.\n\nWhich film and television projects are eligible for the Fund?\n\nThe Fund accepts Qualified Consulting Offers for television and film.\n\nFor television projects, the existence of multiple seats in the writers’ room creates ample opportunities for projects to employ disabled writers at multiple levels.\n\nFor film projects, only films with disabled lead characters that lack a disabled writer or director will be accepted as a Qualified Consulting Offer at this time. This limitation exists because there are fewer writers and directors working on any given film compared to a television show—and our strong preference is that films with disabled lead characters should, at minimum, have a disabled co-writer and/or a disabled director.\n\nFilms that have disabled supporting characters and disabled writers are a plus, but there is no expectation or precedent for a one-to-one correlation between the identities of all of a film’s characters and the identities of the writers, which is more reasonable to expect in television given the existence of a writers’ room.\n\nWhat types of offers are considered Qualified Consulting Offers?\n\nThe Fund only reimburses Qualified Initial Consulting Offers, which means the rate of pay and scope of work that is initially offered to you. The Fund is not able to cover any negotiated increases off of the Initial Offer. See the Qualified Initial Consulting Offers section of the Terms & Conditions for more information.\n\nWhat is a Confirmed Consulting Offer?\n\nSee the definition in the Terms & Conditions\n\nHow much money can I receive from the Fund?\n\nThere is a $1,500 per project cap on reimbursements from the Fund, which equates to the 90th percentile of consulting wages, according to our research. There is also a per-person per-year cap on total payouts from the Fund.\n\nHow is the payment structured?\n\nThe Fund pays out Confirmed Consulting Offers by hiring you as a 1099 contractor. Payments from the Fund are not grants. You should always consult with a tax professional but assume that you will need to pay taxes on the payout.\n\nAre there any conditions of receiving a Confirmed Consulting Offer for the Fund?\n\nYes. To receive a Confirmed Consulting Offer, you will need to agree to our Consulting Fund Freelancer Agreement, which has a number of standard freelancer terms. As part of this, you also agree to not accept the work after receiving the payout, which would defeat the purpose of the Fund.\n\nIn addition, we require you to help with a few quick tasks that will allow us to continue pushing back against exploitative consulting work in the industry. This includes:\n\nFilling out a survey about your current and past consulting experiences, which will help us with our data collection efforts.\n\nSharing an anonymous testimonial 90 days after receiving your payout about what other creative work the Fund allowed you to focus on.\n\nWhat if the company asks me who else they could hire? If the company asks you for recommendations of who might be able to do the consulting job you have declined, please do not recommend anyone since this would defeat the purpose of the Fund. However, we do encourage you to point them to our Concierge service to hire great mid- and upper-level disabled writers and directors.\n\nWhy are you making this Fund?\n\nFor far too long, disabled writers and performers have been hired as disability consultants for pennies on the dollar, giving their life experience and creative contributions to projects about disability that are usually helmed by non-disabled people. The clearest way to push back on this practice and push for the hiring of disabled creatives in the roles they actually desire, is to give disabled creatives the tools to negotiate for the positions they want while giving them comfort that they have an alternative option to redistribute their energy towards advancing their own creative endeavors if their negotiation is not successful.\n\nWhy isn’t it enough to just cast authentically?\n\nThe vast majority of the film and television projects that contemplate disability or have disabled characters were written by and helmed by non-disabled people. This means nearly all of the films and television shows about the disability community remain created and controlled by people who are not part of the community.\n\nIt’s unacceptable for any historically marginalized community to lack agency over their own stories and narratives. While allyship is important, it cannot come at the expense of accelerating and empowering disabled storytellers of all backgrounds.\n\nCasting authentically, while a recommended practice, does not make up for the reality that nearly all of the people in charge of the project are non-disabled, thus few, if any, disabled people end up being in positions of power on the project.\n\nDoes the Fund apply to film and television projects?\n\nIt applies to both.\n\nFor television projects, the existence of multiple seats in the writers’ room creates ample opportunities for projects to employ disabled writers at multiple levels.\n\nFor film projects, films with disabled lead characters that lack a disabled writer or director will only be accepted as a Qualified Consulting Offer at this time. This limitation exists because there are fewer writers and directors working on any given film compared to a television show—and our strong preference is that films with disabled lead characters should, at minimum, have a disabled co-writer and/or a disabled director.\n\nFilms that have disabled supporting characters and disabled writers are a plus, but there is no expectation or precedent for a one-to-one correlation between the identities of all of a film’s characters and the identities of the writers, which is more reasonable to expect in television given the existence of a writers’ room.\n\nHow do I find disabled writers if I can’t hire consultants?\n\nInevitable Foundation’s Concierge service is a free, high-touch service that connects creative executives, showrunners, and producers with mid-career disabled screenwriters for development and staffing. We created the Concierge because there was no central place for industry professionals to discover, read, and meet mid-career disabled writers. Since launch, the Concierge has fielded over 500 requests from more than 140 different executives and showrunners. Over 100 of those requests have led to meetings with companies including Disney, Amazon, Apple, Paramount, AMC Networks, Lionsgate, and Starz. In the last three months alone, the Concierge has generated over $250,000 in earnings for disabled writers.\n\nIf you are looking to fill your development slate and/or staff a show, email concierge@inevitable.foundation to connect with fantastic mid- and upper-level disabled writers.\n\nWill this Fund have a chilling effect on disability representation in the industry?\n\nThe current wave of stories with disability representation are mostly created by non-disabled people. At best, disabled actors and maybe one disabled writer get hired on a project—but this is the exception, not the rule.\n\nWe recognize this Fund might encourage non-disabled people to stop incorporating disability into their work. Instead, it should lead non-disabled people to put disabled creatives in positions of power, which will give them the choice to center their own community in their work if they so desire since disabled writers don’t write solely about disability.\n\nEvery historically marginalized community should be in control of their own stories and narratives, and the largest minority group in America is no exception.\n\nAre you tracking what companies are the highest users of disability consulting?\n\nYes, and we plan to publish those results at a later date.\n\nI have another question.\n\nPlease contact us at advocacy@inevitable.foundation"
