The film offers an overview of the Observatory’s programs and exhibits and discusses how the building was renewed during the 2002-2006 renovation and expansion project.\n\nSeating for The Once and Future Griffith Observatory in the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon Theater is provided on a walk-in, first-come, first-served basis. The program is free."
