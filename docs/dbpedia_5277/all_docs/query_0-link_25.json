        "text": "“Our short filmmakers have always been at the forefront of innovation and experimentation in independent film, while simultaneously giving a voice to filmmaking communities that are traditionally under-represented. This year’s shorts, episodic and DIG lineup is no different, filled with fearless filmmakers who are sure to shape the future of independent storytelling on a global scale,” said Festival Producer Michael Morin.\n\nThe 2023 festival continues the tradition of pushing the envelope of independent and DIY filmmaking with the addition of 19 Unstoppable Shorts, 11 Animated Shorts, 18 Narrative Shorts, 13 Documentary Shorts, 5 Experimental Shorts, 5 Episodes, and 9 DIG Showcases to the lineup. Exploring themes of grief, religion, cultural roots, memories and more, the films in these programs challenge our current perception of cinema.\n\n“The films in this lineup are wildly unique and they each garnered enthusiastic and unanimous support from our programmers. We formally invite you to have your minds blown,” said programmers Lori Felker, Davy Walker and Cherlyn Hsing-Hsin Liu.\n\nIn addition to Shorts programming, Slamdance is also announcing Episodes. Returning for its 4th year, the Episodes programming consists of shows that took big risks with their storylines which paid off in unique and entertaining ways. The category showcases episodic work in any style, genre and format intended for broadcast. Slamdance is also bringing back the Digital, Interactive and Gaming (DIG) programming to recognize innovative digital, interactive, and gaming artwork. It is a platform for independent artists who create outside of traditional media to bring their ideas to life in novel and uncompromising ways.\n\nThe Unstoppable Shorts program will join the Unstoppable Features program online and also in-person at the Student Union Theater at the University of Utah from January 23rd to 25th. Committed to accessibility, the Unstoppable programs will be free to the public. Now in its 3rd edition, the Unstoppable Program includes a showcase of new films by creators with visible and non-visible disabilities.\n\nAll films and projects are once again eligible for the prestigious AGBO Fellowship. Founded by Slamdance alumni Anthony and Joe Russo (AVENGERS: ENDGAME, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR), the AGBO Fellowship provides a $25,000 cash prize, mentorship from the Russos and their team, and office space, enabling a filmmaker to continue honing their skills and pursuing their craft. The 2022 fellowship was awarded to Ethan Eng for his debut feature THERAPY DOGS.\n\n“We are proud to be returning in 2023 with the AGBO Fellowship, which supports emerging filmmakers through hands-on collaboration and mentorship within our company. Alongside Anthony and Joe, all of us at AGBO remain dedicated to helping new and innovative voices reach their fullest potential through their creative expression, and we look forward to this year’s submissions,” said Angela Russo-Otstot, Chief Creative Officer.\n\nIn-person passes and Slamdance Channel subscriptions for the online festival are now available.\n\nUnstoppable Shorts:\n\nAleeya – (India, United States)\n\nDirector: Nina Mahesh; Screenwriter: Nina Mahesh; Producers: Kavita Hari, Betsey Grupp\n\nAleeya follows a transgender woman as she embarks on a day long journey to buy a gift for her lover, while attempting to persevere through India’s societal inequities and prejudice, as well as the growing rape culture of male youth.\n\nCast: Nithu RS\n\nA Black Saturday – (United States)\n\nDirector: Tori Sampson; Screenwriter: Tori Sampson; Producers: Tari Wariebi, Ned Johnson, Lauren Milan Rausaw\n\nFor Nia and Bakari, like Black kids for generations, Saturdays are a rhythmic ritual of obligation and exploration.
