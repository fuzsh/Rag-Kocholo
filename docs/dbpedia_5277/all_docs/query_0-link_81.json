        "text": "Exhibit Events\n\nBackwards and Forwards:\n\nQueering the Crip and Cripping the Queer*\n\nDate: 6 October, 8PM\n\nIn 2003, Sandahl conceptualized the verb âto cripâ to explore the affinities between queer and progressive disability communities. She extrapolated the concept from the verb âto queer,â which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s to describe representational strategies, used in queer communities to make visible and destabilize heterosexual norms. She drew on the similarities and crucial differences between how crips and queers see and represent their experiences by analyzing the work of solo performance artists who identified as both. Since 2003, the use of âto cripâ or âcrippingâ has taken on a life of its own in academic and activist circles. Sandahl returns the termâs origin story that ground it in the lived experience of queer and disabled people and that point to future directions in activism, the arts, and academia.\n\nThe wearing of FPP2 masks in the exhibition halls is mandatory. If this is not possible due to access reasons, please inform us before your visit. The event will take place in English spoken language and will be interpreted into International Sign. The event will be streamed. You can reach the stream on the day of the event on our youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/SchwulesMuseum\n\nEntry: 4â¬\n\nCarrie Sandahl is a Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the Department of Disability and Human Development. She co-directs Chicagoâs Bodies of Work, an organization that supports the development of disability art and culture. Her research and creative activity focus on disability identity in performance and film. Sandahlâs publications include a co-edited an anthology, Bodies in Commotion: Disability and Performance, which garnered the Association for Theatre in Higher Educationâs award for Outstanding Book in Theatre Practice and Pedagogy (2006). Her collaboratively created documentary, Code of the Freaks, a critique of disability representations in cinema, premiered in 2020.\n\n* The title for this talk nods to the theater artist and scholar David Ball, who in 1983, wrote the textbook, Backwards and Forwards: A Technical Manual for Reading Plays. Ballâs technique provides a set of tools to understand how a play works by studying its mechanics before creating meaning. Sandahlâs work focuses on how representational techniques of queering and cripping work together to create new meaning about the lived experience of disability and queerness.\n\nDesire Lines and Death Loops\n\nDate: 8 October, 4PM\n\nMultidisciplinary artist Perel will be performing âDesire Lines and Death Loopsâ at the âQueering the Crip, Cripping the Queerâ exhibit at the Schwules Museum Berlin on 8 October at 4pm. Perel will invite visitors into a choreographed encounter with queer/disability history under the Nazi Reich into a ritual honoring queer/disabled icons: artist Lorenza BÃ¶ttner, performer/choreographer Raimund Hoghe, and writer Audre Lorde, as well as some living icons.\n\nThe wearing of FPP2 masks in the exhibition halls is mandatory. If this is not possible due to access reasons, please inform us before your visit. The event will take place in English spoken language and will be interpreted into German Sign Language.\n\nEntry: 9â¬, reduced 3â¬.\n\nThere is a video of the performance.\n\nPerel is a multidisciplinary artist whose work is centered on disability and queerness as they relate to care, consent, sexuality, and personal and historic trauma. Utilizing choreography to examine power exchange between the artist and audience, âPerel is a master at timing, of tension, relief, and intimacy while creating a space of learning and unlearning.â (Victoria DeJaco, Spike Magazine). Perel asks, âHow do we move across space and time with respect to our collected histories?â Perel tours and teaches internationally, as a university lecturer and mentor to emerging disabled artists at organizations in New York City and Berlin. They recently received the Disability Futures Fellowship (2020-2022) from United States Artists, and the Ford and Mellon Foundations.\n\nPink Splashes: Queering the streets through abolitionist interventions\n\nDate: 23 November, 7pm\n\nSyrus Marcus Ware will be exploring the uprisings of 2020 and the queer and trans Black activist interventions that brought art and activism together to push for abolition and decolonization in Northern Turtle Island. Syrus Marcus Ware will consider artworks that were created in response to these interventions â both works created through his practice and that of other Black artists in Northern Turtle Island.\n\nBio\n\nDr. Syrus Marcus Ware is an Assistant Professor at the School of the Arts at McMaster University.
