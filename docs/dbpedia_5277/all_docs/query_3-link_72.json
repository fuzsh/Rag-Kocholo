        "text": "The Gang of 19 - History of the ADA Movement\n\nFrom Rocky Mountain PBS: Encouraged by civil rights movements of the 1960s, the Disability Rights Movement gained momentum leading to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Decades earlier in 1978, 19 individuals tossed aside their wheelchairs and blocked city buses deemed inaccessible for the physically disabled. Discover how this one act led to years of advocacy in Colorado and inspired the nation.\n\nEat Your Catfish\n\nParalyzed by late-stage ALS and reliant on round-the-clock care, Kathryn clings to a mordant wit as she yearns to witness her daughter's wedding. Drawn from 930 hours of footage shot from her fixed point of view, Eat Your Catfish delivers a brutally frank and darkly humorous portrait of a family teetering on the brink, grappling with the daily demands of disability and in-home caregiving.\n\nIs Anybody Out There? | POV\n\nBorn with a rare disability, filmmaker Ella Glendining wonders if there is anyone who can share the experience of living in a body like hers. This simple question–one which non disabled people take for granted, leads to a journey to not only others who live like her–but to the realization that meeting them changes how she views herself in the world, as well as many surprises along the way.\n\nFind PBS Documentaries and Programs with Audio Description\n\nDid you know many of our programs offer audio descriptions?

The result is a star-studded production that shines on stage and connects with all audiences.\n\nIn this behind-the-scenes interview, Danai Gurira, Ali Stroker and Monique Holt discuss how director Robert O'Hara prioritized diversity and inclusion in this staging of Richard III.\n\nYou can stream the full performance, recorded live in Central Park for Great Performances with Passport now.\n\nGet to Know Disability Arts Ensemble Kinetic Light\n\nWatch two different shows about California-based dance and arts ensemble, Kinetic Light. From If Cities Could Dance, get to know the choreographers and creative minds behind the group, as well as the Bay Area's place in disability rights movement history.\n\nFrom WLIW PBS' Past, Present, Future, go into the studio with Kinetic Light as they rehearse and perform one of their works of art."
