        "text": "Context\n\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires the State Parties, including Germany, to make their development measures inclusive. The 2030 Agenda and its guiding principle of leaving no one behind also emphasises that inclusion is crucial to achieving long-term development goals. Although much has already been done in recent years, people with disabilities are still not taken into sufficient account in development measures.\n\nYet the topic is highly relevant: About one in six people in parts of the Global South live with a disability. Many experience exclusion, violence and poverty, are less likely to have access to education, employment and public services, and are especially vulnerable in crisis situations. Women and girls in particular are often denied basic rights.\n\nInclusion is key to the economic and social development of societies. The potential is enormous, given that accessibility, digital innovations, more social justice and better training improve the quality of life for all."
