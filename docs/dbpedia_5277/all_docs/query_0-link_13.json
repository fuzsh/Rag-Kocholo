        "text": "King Coal\n\nENGLISH\n\nAppalachia’s cultural identity is intrinsically linked to coal, for better or for worse. This documentary blends folklore, history, and first-hand accounts to thoughtfully examine what the future might look like as coal’s grip on the region loosens. The film uses magical realism to elevate its storytelling and provide a nuanced look at the realities of life in Appalachia. Directed by a West Virginia native, King Coal is a reclamation of the region’s stories as told by one of its own.\n\nRuntime: 80 minutes.\n\nRecommended for grades 7-12.\n\nSub-themes: cultural identity, environmentalism, Appalachia, the human condition\n\nTrailer\n\nO Pioneer—New!\n\nENGLISH\n\nThis documentary film reckons with and redefines the American pioneer by following three West Virginians—a blacksmith, a seamstress, and a hospital chaplain—as they creatively navigate hardship. O Pioneer weaves contemporary and archival footage, poetic vignettes, and dream-like animation to showcase Appalachia and the strength of its people, challenging viewers to accept a new narrative about the region and redefine their own challenges as they are inspired by the people featured in the film.\n\nRuntime: 73 minutes.\n\nRecommended for grades 7-12.\n\nSub-themes: Walt Whitman, Appalachia, cultural identity, overcoming adversity\n\nTrailer\n\nA Crime on the Bayou\n\nEnglish\n\nIn 1966, a young Black fisherman, Gary Duncan, tries to break up a fight between white and Black teenagers outside a newly integrated school in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. During the confrontation, he touches one of the white teens on the arm, resulting in his arrest. This begins a confrontation with the racist Louisiana legal system, led by a young Jewish attorney named Richard Sobol, that goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. This film covers the legal fight to enshrine the Constitutional right to a jury trial at the state level and can be accompanied by a virtual visit with a civil rights attorney through our collaboration with the Pennsylvania Bar Association.\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes. Recommended for grades 9-12.\n\nSub-themes: civil rights, racial justice, inequality, persistence, Jim Crow\n\nTrailer\n\nThe Cure for Hate\n\nENGLISH\n\nTony McAleer is a former Skinhead and Holocaust denier who went on to create the anti-hate activist group Life After Hate. Profoundly aware and deeply ashamed of the lineage of hate he’d once promoted, Tony traveled to Auschwitz to bear witness to the inconceivable ravages of the Holocaust and inform his personal work against the rise of extremist politics. This film documents Tony’s journey as he explores the conditions that allowed for the rise of fascism in the 1930’s; shines a light on how men get into, and out of, violent extremist groups; and underscores the danger of allowing hate to be left unchecked.\n\nThis is a perfect opportunity to have high school students consider the lessons of the Holocaust for their lives today and may include a visit from the filmmaker and film subject.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes. A 55-minute version is available for in-school use. Recommended for grades 9-12.\n\nSub-themes: the Holocaust, antisemitism, hate groups, making a difference\n\nTRAILER\n\nRepairing the World: Stories from the Tree of Life\n\nEnglish\n\nThis powerful film documents Pittsburgh’s all-community response to hate in the aftermath of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. Through the voices of survivors, family members, diverse Pittsburgh residents and leaders, the film highlights unity in a moment of crisis, the resilience of a vibrant city, and a community working together to show what it means to be “stronger than hate.”\n\nRuntime: 80 minutes. A 44-minute version is available for in-school use. Recommended for grades 8-12.\n\nSub-themes: antisemitism, gun violence, resilience, “Stronger than Hate”\n\nTrailer\n\nThe Ants and the Grasshopper\n\nEnglish\n\nAnita Chitaya has a gift; she can help bring abundant food from dead soil, she can make men fight for gender equality, and she can end child hunger in her village. Now, to save her home in Malawi from extreme weather, she faces her greatest challenge: persuading Americans that climate change is real. Anita’s journey from Malawi to California to the White House takes her across all divisions shaping the U.S., from the rural-urban divide; to schisms of race, class, and gender; to the thinking that allows Americans to believe they live on a different planet from everyone else.\n\nRuntime: 74 minutes. Recommended for grades 9-12.\n\nSub-themes: environmental justice, gender equality, global connections\n\nTrailer\n\nMake It Work\n\nEnglish\n\nMake It Work is a documentary series of four short films that spotlight young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are disrupting the STEM ecosystem with their incredible innovations.

Each runs around 30 minutes.\n\nVirtual school visits by filmmakers Kern and Kip Konwiser may be available.\n\nRecommended for grades 7-12.\n\nSub-themes: innovation, youth impact, making a difference, entrepreneurship\n\nStill A Black Star\n\nJapanese, English, with English subtitles\n\nThis feature film follows the extraordinary journey of Japanese artist/activist Mago Ngasaka as he traces the flow of waste from the world’s wealthiest nations to a vast e-waste dump in the Agbogbloshie slum in Accra, Ghana, where it is burned to recover precious metals while poisoning the people and devastating the land. We love that Mago partners with the people of the slum to draw attention to and transform their community through art, using waste in innovative ways to wake up the first world to the global e-waste epidemic.\n\nVirtual school visits by filmmakers Kern and Kip Konwiser may be available.\n\nRuntime: 96 minutes. Recommended for grades 8-12.\n\nSub-themes: cultural and class differences, art for social justice, environmentalism, e-waste\n\nTrailer\n\nHolocaust Short Film Program\n\nEnglish, German, French, with English subtitles\n\nThis program of short films has been specially curated to introduce students to little known stories of the Holocaust that humanize the history, instead of focusing solely on dates and numbers.

Their unforgettable story brings this moment in history to life.\n\nRuntime: 92 minutes.

When her father goes missing one day, Anna realizes everything in Europe will change, beginning with her home and family. She, along with her mother and brother, must quickly move first to Switzerland, then to France, to be with her father, a prominent writer who opposes Hitler. From then on, Anna encounters life as a refugee, not speaking the language, not knowing the customs, missing friends and loved ones, and facing xenophobia, poverty, and hunger.
