Research has shown that misconceptions about disabled people significantly contribute to reduced opportunities for jobs, unsafe housing, and unsatisfactory health care. Through a facilitated discussion with a panel consisting of research experts on disability representation, disability activists and an XR creator who uses co-design methods we will explore the concept of responsible storytelling in terms of disability representation. We consider the impact of poor representation and what responsible, appropriate storytelling would mean for them. We will also explore how the creative industries can be empowered to tell more appropriate stories about disabled people."
