        "text": "Portal for Disability History through Primary Sources\n\nNEW: Resource Guide: Disability History and Studies - Choices Program Brown University\n\nOverview on Disability History Primary Sources and Curriculum\n\nThe integration of the history of people with disabilities into the curriculum benefits all students. Recognizing the many roles of people with disabilities across time can be especially powerful for students who struggle in their own lives. Students engage when they connect with history that reflects their experiences. Furthermore, disability history is increasingly recognized as vital to a full understanding of U.S. history, including in the 2018 Massachusetts standards. For further thoughts, watch a one-minute video clip, \"Why focus on History of People with Disabilities?\" and read the essay Why Teach Disability History? (Updated in 2023).\n\nPrimary sources from the Library of Congress, the Disability History Museum, and other collections can provide entry points and deepen exploration into historical events. Primary sources add immediacy, such as the faces in a photograph, the emotional tone of a drawing or song, or the complex look of a handwritten document. Documents from multiple points of view can illuminate conflicting ideas and events. Varied media, including maps, oral histories, published reports, and graphs offer many options for connection and investigation. Guided video tips and for finding primary sources building primary source sets are in our Teaching Resources. Also see the Library of Congress research Guide for Middle and High School Students.\n\nFor support in understanding of the scope and flow of Disability History, see Disability History Timelines. See lists of disability history curricula below. Download teacher-developed examples of Lessons on Disability History that directly address content in the 2018 Massachusetts History and Social Science Framework.\n\nIt is essential to address disrespectful terms related to disability in primary sources. See the Teaching Resource: Time Out – Spotlight Offensive Language in Primary Sources. Also see the Know and Support Students page.\n\nCrossover Themes of Disability History\n\nState history standards and textbooks across the U.S. commonly emphasize a similar structure of topics in history.
