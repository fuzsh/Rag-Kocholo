        "text": "The Slamdance Film Festival announced what it calls its “most accessible festival ever” — an online and in-person hybrid event that will include 25 features, 107 shorts and episodic, and a new program called Unstoppable that will showcase creators with disabilities.\n\nRunning February 12-25, 2021, the festival won’t be held at its usual Treasure Mountain Inn location in Park City, Utah due to COVID-19. Instead, all films, Q&A’s and panels will be available on Slamdance.com, AppleTV, Roku, Firestick, and YouTube. Virtual passes are available for free until Dec. 31, and for $10 until the end of the festival. Slamdance will also hold a two-night drive-in presentation in Joshua Tree, California, open to the public on Feb. 13-14, as well as a closing-night screening at a Los Angeles drive-in on Feb. 25.\n\nThe “by filmmakers, for filmmakers” festival will also include an invite-only Joshua Tree retreat — subject to pandemic protocols and quarantine —and a screening fee of $350 for each feature filmmaking team. (The main image above is of members of the Slamdance team scoping out Joshua Tree locales.)\n\nThe festival’s theme, “Greenlight Yourself,” reflects an effort to turn obstacles into opportunities.\n\nAlso Read: Two Strangers Tried to Make a Movie Together. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?\n\n“Our theme this year was inspired by the incredible resilience and creativity evidenced by our community and our team over the past few unprecedented months,” said Slamdance president and co-founder Peter Baxter. “The shared journey ahead for Slamdance’s filmmakers, alumni community and organization is to ‘Greenlight Yourself’ and triple down on not only who we are, but how we can continue expanding the many ways we support the filmmakers who are the future of independent filmmaking.”\n\nThe lineup includes 20 premieres, with 15 world, four North American, and one U.S. debuts. Films come to Slamdance from countries including Australia, Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Lithuania, Romania, United Kingdom and Taiwan, as well as the United States.\n\nThe competition films in the Narrative and Documentary categories are feature-length directorial debuts with budgets of less than $1 million, without US distribution. Breakouts focus in directors who have already made their first films and who maintain distinct styles and voices. The films were selected by a blind submission process.\n\nThe opening night film, which will screen at a Joshua Tree drive-in on Feb. 13, is No Trace (Nulle Trace), a world premiere from Canadian director and screenwriter Simon Lavoie. Set in a near future, the film follows a callous smuggler who guides a pious young woman and her child across the border.\n\nThe festival will close with the world premiere of 18th & Grand: The Olympic Auditorium Story, on Feb. 25. The feature documentary by Stephen DeBro tells the story of L.A. through the prism of a historic fight palace and Aileen Eaton, the woman who ran it. It features the voices of fighters, skaters, and musicians including Roddy Piper, John Doe, James Ellroy and Julio Cesar Chavez.\n\nThe Unstoppable program will feature 22 short films from disabled filmmakers, that feature actors with disabilities, or that highlight conversation about disabilities. It is entirely programmed by disabled artists.\n\n“I’m honored to be part of the wonderful Unstoppable team and embrace the idea of creating a safe space for filmmakers with disabilities and take our creativity as seriously as everyone else in this industry. I feel like we are building a bridge for others to cross and I am so proud to be a part of it,“ said Unstoppable programmer Juliet Romeo.\n\nThe 2021 festival will also include the return of The AGBO Fellowship, presented by AGBO Films in partnership with the festival. The $25,000 prize was launched in 2018 by Slamdance alumni Anthony and Joe Russo (Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War), and includes mentorship from the acclaimed filmmakers.\n\nDespite the pandemic, Slamdance has incubated many notable project over the past year, including the Netflix film Day Shift, which was born and optioned by Slamdance and comprised of alums, starring Jamie Foxx; Andrew Patterson’s acclaimed Amazon film The Vast of Night, which premiered at Slamdance in 2019; and Merawi Gerema’s award-winning Residue, which premiered at Slamdance this year and was picked up by Ava Duvernay’s ARRAY for release on Netflix.\n\nSlamdance has a long history of helping to discover and promote rising filmmakers, including the Russo Brothers, Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan, Bong Joon-ho, Sean Baker, Jennifer Kent, Lena Dunham and many more.\n\nHere are the films in the 2021 lineup, as described by Slamdance:\n\nNARRATIVE FEATURES\n\nA Brixton Tale – (UK, Ireland) World Premiere\n\nDirectors: Darragh Carey & Bertrand Desrochers – Screenwriters: Rupert Baynham, Darragh Carey, Chi Mai – Producers: Rupert Baynham, Dennis Gyamfi, Beau Rambaut\n\nA voyeuristic, wealthy vlogger finds herself drawn to a handsome, shy youth from the infamous Barrier Block housing project.
