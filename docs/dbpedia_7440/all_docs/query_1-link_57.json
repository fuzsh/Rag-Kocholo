        "text": "This sumptuous period epic was adapted from Sir Peter Shaffer’s original stage play, which tells the story of the frustrated Vienna court composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, who won Best Actor for role) and the envy that consumes him upon discovering that the divine musical gifts he has longed for have been bestowed upon a bawdy, vulgar, and impish composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by Plymouth, MI native Tom Hulce). Salieri’s jealousy fuels his plot to destroy the man, while he is unable to tear himself away from the genius of his music. The score contains some of Mozart’s greatest compositions, including excerpts from The Magic Flute, the Symphony No. 25, Don Giovanni, The Marriage of Figaro, and his famous Requiem. Amadeus was named one of the American Film Institute’s best 100 movies of the 20th century and remains one of the most beloved films of all time.\n\nAmadeus Live is a production of Avex Classics International."
