        "text": "FROM the initial production of Peter Shaffer's ''Amadeus'' at the National Theater in London in 1979, through all of the refinements that preceded the play's New York premiere in 1980, and now, in the even more extensive rewriting and adjustments made by Mr. Shaffer for Milos Forman's handsome, music-filled screen version, one thing has remained constant and exhilarating.\n\nThat is Mr. Shaffer's ability to celebrate genius - in this case, that of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - in a fashion that is simultaneously illuminating, moving and just. It's a major achievement, especially in films where genius is usually represented and dramatized as some kind of ill- humored, social eccentricity.\n\nOn film, the core of this extraordinary drama continues to be the paradox represented by Antonio Salieri who, as court composer to Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, was Mozart's most ferocious adversary as well as the only person in Vienna to comprehend the magnificence of Mozart's gifts.\n\nVery early in the film there's a marvelous moment when Salieri, played with immense, tragic humor and passion by F. Murray Abraham, hears for the first time the music of the young prodigy who has become the talk at the Hapsburg court in Vienna. In words that could only have been written by a playwright with a rare understanding of music, Salieri describes how the notes interact, one hanging over another, intersected by others, to bring out feelings of sweetness and pain that send Salieri rushing from the room in delirious panic.\n\n''This was music I'd never heard before,'' says Salieri, whose face melts into ashen jelly. ''It seemed to me the voice of God.''\n\nIn ''Amadeus,'' which opens today at the Paramount and Tower East Theaters, we hear, almost as if for the first time, which is the way with great music, long, glorious passages from the operas, concertos, sonatas and masses, and, through the obsession of Salieri, we come to understand something of their particular divinity. ''If He did not want me to praise Him with music,'' the mad old Salieri says to an uncomprehending priest, ''why did He give me the desire?''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
