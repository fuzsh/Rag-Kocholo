        "text": "Amadeus has to be one of the strangest movies to sweep the Oscars and the American audience by storm. This is a movie adapted from a play about an envious court composer named Salieri who might have had a hand in Mozart’s demise. The premise sounds promising but there is also classical music and opera which most American audiences aren’t a fan of.\n\nThe play was a huge success so it only made sense to make an Oscar grabbing movie out of the whole affair. They could have just settled for a costume drama and left out the music but they tried to be as truthful to the play as possible. What an amazing job Milos Forman as director; Peter Shaffer as writer and who also wrote the original play; and actor F. Murray Abraham who played Salieri. They turned what could have been a paint by numbers costume drama into quite the movie experience.\n\nI’m going to review this movie by talking about three exceptional scenes contained in this movie. These scenes, to me, really explain the envy going through Salieri and the brilliance captured by Mozart. These excerpts, to me, are the heart of the movie and what makes it stand out.\n\nThe first scene that hooked me and made me want more is the scene were Salieri reads Mozart’s music for the first time at the visiting palace of the Archbishop of Salzburg. Here, F. Murray Abraham’s face, hands, and tone of voice helps illuminate how much envy and astonishment Salieri had for Mozart’s music. It also shows how much Salieri loved and obsessed about music.\n\nIn the beginning of the movie Salieri explains how he as a child was envious of Mozart and wanted devote is life to music similarly. In this one scene we see what that envy and love looks like. The exposition given earlier in the movie is given life. We understand the gravity of the situation and can understand Salieri’s motives through the rest of the movie.\n\nExposition is one of those things that every story has. In written form it can be usually done with many literary devices but it’s usually not too burdensome unless the author is verbose. When it comes to plays exposition is basically used to describe what they can’t show you because of the constraints of that medium. Movies can have lots of fun with exposition and can make it seem unnoticed if done correctly with visualization.\n\nThe reason I bring exposition up is how this one scene does a massive amount of exposition without the audience ever noticing and also making it one of the best scenes in the movie. On the commentary track of the Blu-Ray the director explains how this one scene made people love music more than ever before. That is the magic of movies right there.\n\nEverything about this scene is exquisite in way the actors handle the material, the director/editor intersplice the scenes of future and past Salieri, and finally how the music supervisor plays the music while Salieri is describing what we are hearing. If only music theory class was taught this way.\n\nThe next scene is when Mozart’s wife Constanze comes to Salieri at his home to show him some of Mozart’s work so Mozart can get the coveted tutoring position for the royal niece. This is where motivations and talents come into view. This is where we see people at their weakest and ugliest.\n\nFirst, the weak, which is played by Constanze. She comes unbeknownst to his husband Mozart to beg for this commission for him. Salieri slowly gets it out of her that Mozart is a poor genius. He doesn’t have time for the real world because he is composing masterpieces. We also see how out of depth Mozart and Constanze are.\n\nMozart is too proud and disinterested in finances to bow to the convention of having his work reviewed. So, it falls on the dutiful yet naïve wife to make his interest be known. She knows nothing of music and court intrigue so when she comes to see Salieri she has no idea what she is stepping into. Which, of course, is the ugliness of envy and Salieri at his worst.\n\nWhen Salieri first looks at Mozart’s music he is shocked to learn that these are master copies and there are no edits. I never thought about the lack of edits being meaningful until old Salieri hits home on how Mozart is simple doing dictation from the music in his head. Even this review is going through many drafts and rewrites. I cannot even imagine the feat of creating a whole opera in one’s head perfectly and then writing it down from memory as a completed masterpiece.\n\nWhat happens next to Salieri is basically such an amazing music orgasm that he actually drops all the music on the floor. It’s a perfect expression of what Salieri is experiencing while leafing through Mozart’s work. The editing is superb in how it splices young Salieri’s ecstasy and horror, with the music that is being played from the page being viewed, and to old Salieri explaining exactly what kind of miracle we are seeing.\n\nAgain, this is how this movie does exposition right. Instead of trying to explain why Mozart is a genius and why his music is phenomenal through talking and hand wringing we see it written on Salieri’s face. We hear the amazing music but we also see what it does to someone who loves music to his core. We also see how the envy inside Salieri is brought to a roaring blaze by the knowledge of how deficient he is and how absolutely divine Mozart is.\n\nThe final scene, and to me the climax of the movie, is the operatic scene of Don Giovanni. Here is where we see the basest form of our protagonist and antagonist. The audience gets to appreciate opera, the genius of Mozart, and the envy/cunning of Salieri in one scene.\n\nI’m not a fan of opera, which I think most people would attest to for themselves in general, but this scene makes opera seem marvelous. The costumes, the exaggerated acting, the fabulous music, and the amazing singing. It all comes together for me in this scene as to why opera can be amazing. It also shows how Mozart channels his emotions through music which makes it so enduring and captivating.\n\nAgain, the editing in this scene is fantastic between old and new Salieri, Mozart, and the full scale opera going on. You already can feel how important this opera is to Mozart but it really connects when watching Salieri and Mozart react to it in different ways.\n\nAs Mozart is directing the opera you can almost see him trying to cast away his demons and emotions. This is probably some of Tom Hulce’s best work in the movie. Overall I think he does best when not talking and relies on his intense physicality throughout the movie. As he watches his darkest nightmares unfold on the stage he seems to relish in getting every note out as he knows it gets him closer to resolution of his father’s death.\n\nSalieri listening is also a treat to watch. F. Murray Abrahams reactions as he slowly tries to escape the intensity of the music and action from the stage is incredible. You see the music affecting Salieri as his old version is describing: terrifying and wonderful. He physically corners himself so he can brace against all the emotion any energy being exuded by the opera piece.\n\nThe real genius to this scene, though, is that we see where Mozart gets his genius from and how Salieri knows what is best about music. Salieri knows the genius of Mozart but tries to quash any public notion of it as you can see by the limited attendance of the opera. It’s almost as though he cherishes knowing this gem exists but he doesn’t want anyone else to get any ideas and realize how rough his cut of music is.\n\nJust like this brilliant movie, the brilliance of Mozart is his ability to transfer the human condition to the musical page. This movie is envy, written out large as Mozart’s music is about anguish and longing. What makes great stories is how it follows the arc of human emotions and understanding. I place this movie as the great story of genius and envy."
