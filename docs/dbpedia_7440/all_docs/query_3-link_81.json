If you ask me, I'd say it's a big, red herring.\n\n\"Amadeus\" - if ever a film (biopic) was calculated to upset Mozart lovers it's this one!! Divided opinion, mostly over the representation of Mozart - who is shown to be ADHD and very childish. I've read the letters and there's plenty in them to support that view. However, the film is fundamentally about music itself and, in this sense, Mozart is not really the central 'character'. I don't think a finer screenplay (or play) has ever been written about the art of music and for this reason I adored the film. The words!! I'm not especially a Mozart fan, having become more or less bored with his music 25 years ago and moved higher up the pecking order, shall we say. But the film is capital \"R\" romanticism - one which relies heavily upon costume, setting, make-up and verisimilitude and falls nicely into the 'tortured, suffering genius' paradigm, which is part of the hagiography of composers. For me, the weakness of the film was the cliched composer figure, but it has taken me over 20 years to form that view. I would prefer, nowadays, a composer who speaks real lines (\"Pass the pepper, please\") not one who speaks all the time about only music. But because it is ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC this kind of reality is absent from the film. The figure of Leopold was all-too glib because, if you read the letters, Mozart relied heavily upon him and valued his judgment and opinions and, ironically, was the major reason why Mozart never really grew up. The writers could have made much of that and perhaps it would have assauged the feelings of hostility toward the film expressed by Mozart-lovers.\n\nThanks for starting the discussion!\n\nI wish I could add more than you have, a more technical explanation of why \"Amadeus\" still turns me on.\n\nIf Mozart lovers don't like the movie, I can see saying that it got \"too wigged out\".\n\nAnd if there's a scene the movie left out, for me, it was Mozart, or his father, performing solo onstage.\n\nAnd Corno Dolce's comment about not transcending the Vatican, but being used by it, took awhile to foment.\n\nOkay.... being used by the Vatican, from my Scottish perspective, is transcending the Vatican.\n\nI see Michaelangelo the same way. We're talking about Mozart, and I don't know who the Pope was.\n\nIf I can ask a question, after many viewings, thinking he neglecting the boy,\n\ndespite his father's investment in him, whatever happened to Mozart's son?\n\nMozart had two sons and both died, I believe, in their 40's. Franz Xavier attempted to become a composer but he was unsuccessful. Neither Mozart child had any children themselves so the line stopped there, to the best of my knowledge. And, of course, Mozart and Constanza lost children in infancy - just like everybody else did.\n\nI'm sorry, I fail to get the connection with the Vatican. I see the Cardinal Collarado (spelling!) figure as important because it established the link between music and the church - which was already hundreds of years old - and it told a lot about the cultural climate of Austria at that time. The Hapsburg Empire was Catholic and tied closely to the development of kunstmusik - and we can all thank God for that, I think!!\n\nThere is a forum dedicated to Mozart, so named, if you are interested in knowing more. Don't try to discuss \"Amadeus\" because many of the contributors there have fetishized the composer and only want to discuss what bus he caught to his Turkish Bath, who his hairdresser was, how many notes there were in this or that score, what his barber said about Salieri - and precious little about the music at all. I lost interest some time ago. I always think it's better to discuss issues with people who are 'on the same page', as it were.\n\nI don't exactly think Mozart is \"lightweight\" at all - that's not my problem with it. The gravitas of some of the string quartets and chamber music and the inventiveness and melodies of the late symphonies and certainly the operas are remarkable. The problem I have is that Mozart did nothing new with music; he pushed no boundaries and it's all so tonal!! Not that he wasn't going to interesting keys in his 'later' works - there was certainly that - but there's an over-familiarity with it which I find exasperating. I own so little of his recorded music and when I played the piano I found his pieces \"nice\" but undemanding to my ear. I must have complexity, drama and daring abstract musical ideas to sustain my interest. Can I explain by saying that my 'desert island' music is the late string quartets of Beethoven, as well as his last half dozen piano sonatas. Fantastic development of ideas, almost attempting to break away from tonality itself - daring, remarkable and devastating in its concentrated sheer musicality. That's the only explanation I can provide for my loss of interest in Mozart. For me, much of it has to do with my own musical maturity and increasing demands of a composer.\n\nI don't exactly think Mozart is \"lightweight\" at all - that's not my problem with it.

For me, much of it has to do with my own musical maturity and increasing demands of a composer.\n\nI have no argument with that I built up a large collection of Mozart when I first started collecting but as I explored other composers I found him ..[and I cant find a better description at the moment ] Light weight ..\n\nI absolutely take your point, yet I have had stand-up arguments with people who think I've missed the point with Mozart - that he's profound beyond all others and that it's a deceptive 'simplicity' and my fault for not seeing it. I largely agree with YOU - I sidelined Mozart 27 years ago when I really got 'hot 'n heavy' about the Renaissance, Baroque and Romantics, right up to today. I find Mozart tedious and predictable - this is entirely MY OWN response, but I appreciate that others find him more ingenious than that. But I do stick by what I said about the string quartets etc. in my original comments. It just doesn't float my boat any more. My mother died in 1984 and she gave me my earliest musical education (from age 7). She had a Licenciate in Piano and used to joke about Mozart, rubbing the palms of her hands together rapidly and saying to me \"that's Mozart for me - too much vibrato and tremolo\". I couldn't stop laughing because she was so right. For me, he's the theatrical composer par excellence.\n\nI was in your lovely country at the end of November for 2 weeks - in Auckland and the much preferred Wellington. We stayed in Parnell in Auckland and I thought to myself, \"If I had to live in this city this would be the suburb\". I'm amazed by the politeness, \"thank you driver\" when people alighted from buses. Aye!!\n\nIf there's one thing Mozart explains in Amadeus that resonates with me,\n\nand is the reason I like Jimi Hendrix's guitar overdub mini-symphonies,\n\nwas his explanation of why he used so many notes, how it was heard.\n\nMozart explained that people could understand many people talking, and singing,\n\nwhen their ear for musical instruments would leave them confused, unmoved.\n\nI can see others saying individual parts, or his piano pieces, seem lightweight.\n\nMozart really comes to life with all the action onstage, the various vocal groups,\n\nand the wonderful orchestration behind it.\n\nYeah, I guess I'm saying the movie \"Amadeus\", and Mozart's life, is like one big, long opera.\n\nI was in your lovely country at the end of November for 2 weeks - in Auckland and the much preferred Wellington.

I lived in Auckland for a few years but after trying a few other places settled down in the Wop waps I agree that Wellington is far nicer than Auckland.\n\nOne thing I should mention, a very good friend of mine is a Mozart lover and has been for ever he is in his early eighties but I can't resist baiting him.....all in good fun of course"
