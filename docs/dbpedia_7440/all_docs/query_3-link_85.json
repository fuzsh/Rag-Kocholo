        "text": "A new Sky Original limited series based on the 1984 film Amadeus is coming soon, starring White Lotus actor Will Sharpe in the role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nThis year celebrates the 40th anniversary of the release of the Oscar-winning film Amadeus, and will be marked in the upcoming issue of BBC Music Magazine. The film was adapted from the 1979 stage play of the same name by Peter Shaffer, and went on to win eight Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\nThe new drama will be written by Joe Barton and directed by Julian Farino, the pair behind the crime series Giri/Haji, which also starred Will Sharpe in the leading role.\n\nThe new Sky Original series will look into the alleged rivalry between the two young composers Mozart and Salieri.\n\n'Recently unemployed and without the management of his father, Amadeus finds an unlikely ally in a young singer who will become his wife, fiery Constanze Weber Mozart,' a statement from the producer reads. 'Her connections help bring him into the orbit of the court composer Antonio Salieri, setting the three of them on a collision course that will ultimately define their lives and their legacies for years to come.'"
