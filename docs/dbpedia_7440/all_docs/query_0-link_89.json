        "text": "This semi-fictionalized account of the life of the world famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is told from the viewpoint of his musical rival, Antonio Salieri. The entire film is a flashback, as an aging Salieri spins the story as a murder confession to his priest. The entire film has strong religious overtones, beginning with the title, Amadeus, which means ‘beloved of God’. The main theme is Salieri’s struggle with his faith, which remains unresolved at the end of the movie. The film score features some of history’s most powerful religious music, both by Mozart and other composers. Academy Awards: 11 nominations, 8 wins (including Best Picture, Director, Screenplay and Actor)"
