        "text": "Though much has been written about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most entertaining look at the master composer's life might very well be Amadeus, Milos Forman's film about the artist's life (and rivalries), which was released on September 19, 1984.\n\nHere's a look back at the Oscar-winning biopic that not only brought renewed interest to Mozart's music in the 1980s, but inspired Austrian rocker Falco to write the chart-topping \"Rock Me Amadeus.\" Poor Salieri never stood a chance.\n\n1. Amadeus began life as a Tony Award-winning play.\n\nRussian poet/playwright Alexander Pushkin wrote a short play in 1830 called Mozart and Salieri, and playwright Peter Shafferâwho was already a Tony winner for Equusâtook inspiration from that to write his own play. Amadeus played in various theaters in London beginning in 1979, then premiered on Broadway in 1980 with Ian McKellen as Antonio Salieri, Tim Curry as Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze, Mozart's wife. The production won five Tonys, including Best Play and Best Actor for McKellen, who beat out Curry for the award; the two leads had been nominated in the same category.\n\n2. Mark Hamill wanted the lead role, but Milos Forman wouldn't let him audition.\n\nIn an attempt to circumvent any typecasting he might get after three blockbuster Star Wars films launched his career, Mark Hamill played the composer on Broadway for nine months in 1983. But when the time came for the movie to be made, Czech director MiloÅ¡ Forman couldnât get the space cowboy image out of his head. âMiloÅ¡ Forman told me, âOh no, you must not play the Mozart because the people not believing the Luke Spacewalker as Mozart,ââ Hamill said in a 1986 interview. âHe was very upfront about it, and I appreciated that rather than getting my hopes up that it was possible Iâd be playing the role.â\n\n3. Kenneth Branagh legitimately thought he had landed the lead role.\n\nA young Kenneth Branagh was an early contender for the part of Mozart. In his autobiography, he wrote that he thought he had the part in the bag until Forman informed him they were casting Americans for the leads. Other actors who auditioned for the Mozart role included Tim Curry and Mel Gibson. Though Mozart was a rock star in his day, actual rock star Mick Jagger was also turned down after his audition.\n\n4. Mozart's frequent collaborator Emanuel Schikaneder was played by another stage Mozart.\n\nActor Simon Callow originated the role of Mozart at the Royal National Theater production of Amadeus in 1979, and though Forman told him his portrayal was \"truly brilliant, fantastic, asshole and genius, funny, tragic, crazy, a baby and a god,\" the director wasn't prepared to give him the title role in the film. Instead, he cast Callow as Emanuel Schikaneder, the librettist who worked with Mozart on The Magic Flute and played the part of Papageno the bird catcher.\n\n5. The movie was shot without the use of light bulbs or other modern lighting devices.\n\nThe Tyl Theatre in Prague was the original theater where Don Giovanni first premiered in October 1787, and the authenticity of the building was a huge boon for the production since it had hardly been updated since it was first built in 1783. â[The Tyl is] where the opera premiered. And he conducted the first performance. And none of the opera house had been touched since he was there,\" choreographer Twyla Tharp recalled in 2015. \"We had fire everywhere. We could have burnt down the opera house. We had live fire in the chandelier. We were lighting people on stage, and these guys were whipping these torches around.\"\n\nPatrizia von Brandensteinâwho became the first woman to win the Oscar for Best Art Direction with this movieâhad nightmares about damaging the all-wooden opera house. \"I thought, 'God will truly punish me if this place catches on fire,'\" she said.\n\n6. Tom Hulce practiced piano for four to five hours a day.\n\nIn order to look believable on camera, Hulce spent a month with a piano teacher before filming. Although he knew some basicsâhe could read music, and had played violin and sung in choirs as a childâhe needed to look like a natural. \"I spent four weeks, four to five hours a day learning to play,â Hulce told People in 1984. âThe first two days were scales and exercises. The next day was a concerto.\" And for that scene at the masquerade ball when Mozart plays a tune while lying on his back? That was really Hulce.\n\n7. Tom Hulce's laugh is semi-historical, though he had trouble recreating it.\n\nThroughout the movie, Mozart has an infectious cackleâit comes out just as often when heâs giddy as when heâs uncomfortable. Though there are dubious historical reports that the real Mozart had such an obnoxious laugh, Hulce created the giggle after Forman asked him to come up with \"something extreme.\" \"I've never been able to make that sound except in front of a camera,\" Hulce later said. \"When we did the looping nine months later, I couldn't find the laugh. I had to raid the producer's private bar and have a shot of whiskey to jar myself into it.\"\n\n8. Someone really did commission a requiem from Mozartâit just wasn't Salieri.\n\nThe script clearly took some artistic liberties, including the plot line of the masked man who comes to Mozart pretending to be his dead father. This was not, as the movie portrays, Salieri. But in 1791, Austrian Count Franz von Walseggâwho had a penchant for commissioning music to pass off as his own at his twice-weekly concertsâapproached Mozart and asked for a requiem for his beloved wife, who had died on Valentineâs Day.\n\nAccording to a famously censored document in which a teacher near Vienna, Anton Herzog, recorded firsthand accounts of von Walseggâs court, the Count often rewrote these commissioned quartets and other scores in his own hand and didnât give credit to the original composers. His staff musicians often laughed this off because it seemed to amuse the Count, and because the Count was also an amateur musician in his own right. Mozartâs âRequiem Mass in D minor,â the document alleges, was one such piece. And Mozart really did die later that year, in December, before completing the full mass. Salieri didnât help him complete it though; Austrian composer and possible Mozart student Franz SÃ¼ssmayr took that on.\n\n9. The actors felt intense jealousy, too.\n\nSalieri and Mozart were the 18th-century equivalent of frenemies: They were contemporaries in a competitive field, and though they needed each otherâs support, they werenât above petty jealousies and a little backstabbing. Hulce and F. Murray Abraham (who played Salieri) also felt those pressures. ''Tom and Meg [Tilly, the actress originally cast as Constanze] were very close,'' Abraham told The New York Times in 1984. ''They had these secret jokes and were always laughing together. I was pushed out, and I was resentful. I began to have very nasty feelings that were exactly like Salieri's feelings toward Mozart. When that correspondence between a film and real life occurs, it's a director's dream.''\n\nâOccasionally Murray and I would go out and drink this terrible sweet champagne that they have in Prague,\" added Hulce. \"But at other times there was a rivalry between us, and I found myself suspicious of him.''\n\n10. It was shot almost entirely on location in Pragueâwhile under surveillance from the Secret Police.\n\nDuring filming in 1983, Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule. The production team was often followed around by the secret police, and Forman and the cast spoke about their fears that a Fourth of July prankâthe unfurling of the American flag in the concert hall and the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by the large cast and crewâwould lead to their arrests for inciting rebellion. Many suspected that their hotel rooms had been bugged during the six months they spent filming the movie.\n\nForman, who was considered a traitor for becoming an American citizen and not returning to the Soviet-controlled area, had previously had one of his movies banned in the country (then called the Czech Socialist Republic). According to Twyla Tharp, in order to shoot in red territory, Forman had to make certain concessions. \"MiloÅ¡ had to sign an agreement that he would go to his hotel every night for the year that he was there and that his driver would be his best friend from the old days,\" Tharp told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And everybody knew what would happen to his best friend if something untoward politically happened around MiloÅ¡, because MiloÅ¡ was a sort of local hero and he was dangerous to the authorities.\"\n\n11. A teenage Cynthia Nixon had a small but pivotal role.\n\nAt age 17, Nixon played Lorl, the maid employed by Salieri to spy on Mozart. Though she was an experienced child actor at that point, she was also trying to finish her schooling. Thus, she and her parents were cautious of the time she'd need to be abroad for filming. \"When I was cast in Amadeus with MiloÅ¡ Forman, which was shooting in Europe,\" Nixon said in 2014, \"I said, 'I want to be in your film so much, but I have a request: If I donât shoot for two days in a row, you have to send me home.' They agreed.\"\n\n12. The distributor made a promotional video depicting Mozart as a modern rock star.\n\nSince the movie wasn't financed by a major studio with lots of promotional dollars behind it, the distributor, Orion Pictures, decided to get creative. And what better way to promote a rock star in the age of MTV than with a music video featuring David Lee Roth and cuts of Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, KISS, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, and Madonna dancing along to Mozart's \"Symphony No. 25 in G minor\"?\n\n13. The movie was a huge hit."
