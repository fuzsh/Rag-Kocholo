        "text": "There are two ways to look at the story of Amadeus, Peter Shaffer’s play that was opened out into an epic three-hour movie in 1984. It can be viewed as an example of how the creative spark of genius is often snuffed by mediocrity. The other way of looking at it is to take the viewpoint of mediocrity, and consider the tragedy of how it feels to be eclipsed by someone who has more natural talent than you.\n\nI imagine that more people identify with the latter view. Few of us can share the unwavering confidence in our own talent that is shown by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as portrayed in Miloš Forman’s film. More of us can understand the viewpoint of Salieri, the man who spends a lifetime working hard to achieve something that will never match the instantaneous achievement of someone who seems to have it so much easier than us.\n\nHow many of us have known a person that seems to effortlessly achieve that which we could never attain, no matter how hard we struggle. There is the student who revises the night before an exam and achieves grades that equal or exceed those of the hard-working swot who spent weeks preparing. Or what about the outsider who looks in on the person who more readily makes new friends or finds romantic admirers without needing to woo others?\n\nThese kinds of experience can be recognised by many, and they are taken to their logical extreme in the person of Antonio Salieri (F Murray Abraham), court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri is the most famous composer in Europe at the time, or so he says. Salieri feels reassured of his own talent until he hears the music of Mozart, and realises that this young man’s music is so great that it makes his own seem weak and forgettable.\n\nWe should not imagine that the events in Amadeus have any basis in historical reality. Shaffer described his play as a fantasia on the lives of Mozart and Salieri. In reality the rivalry between the two men was not taken to such lethal extremes, although Mozart did believe that Salieri schemed against him, and the stories about Salieri’s role in Mozart’s death were not invented by Shaffer.\n\nIt is likely that the real Salieri did not realise the full extent of Mozart’s superior talent at all. The rendering of Salieri as a jealous failure scheming to bring about the destruction of a better composer is probably unfair to the real man. All we can say is that Salieri’s music was forgettable, and that Mozart’s music vibrates with life, variety and fluidity that is captured beautifully in the playing by Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.\n\nMarriner was a superb conductor, and he wisely insisted that Mozart’s original tunes should not be tampered with to fit them into a popular movie. The film rings with Mozart’s tunes – operas, dances, symphonies, concertos, chamber music and of course the final ominous Requiem which is woven into the storyline.\n\nThe film opens with the ageing Salieri in an asylum (the real Salieri suffered from dementia at the end of his life rather than insanity). The fictional Salieri attempts to commit suicide and a priest is called out to tend to him.\n\nFather Vogler (Richard Frank) is unfamiliar with Salieri’s work. The saddened composer attempts to play a few of his most popular tunes on the piano, but Father Vogler does not recognise them. However he instantly recognises Eine Kleine Nachtmusic when Salieri plays that. Even a minor serenade by Mozart is easier to retain in the memory than the best works of his onetime rivalry. Salieri laments:\n\nThirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct. My music growing fainter. All the time fainter till no one plays it at all.\n\nSalieri’s tragedy is twofold – he possesses to an extraordinary degree the ability to recognise and appreciate musical genius when he hears it, but he lacks the talent to emulate it. He is in genuine ecstasy when he hears Mozart’s music. While he pretends to be Mozart’s friend, his compliments about the great man’s compositions are the only sincere words that he says to Mozart. Yet with that admiration for the composer comes only bitterness and gall. He knows that he will never come close to producing music of that kind himself.\n\nThere is an element of blasphemy in Salieri’s hatred for Mozart – a rebellion against a spiteful and arbitrary god. He considers that God has treated him unfairly by showing preference for Mozart. When Father Vogler tells him, “All men are equal in God’s eye,” Salieri replies, “Are they?”\n\nBefore Mozart comes along, Salieri is convinced that he is God’s instrument. As a youth he begs God for the gift of music and promises his chastity in return. His prayer is seemingly answered by his father’s death, allowing him the chance to become a highly-respected composer at the court of Emperor Joseph.\n\nSalieri’s world is shattered by a vulgar young man that he meets at a concert. In the backroom, the man chases a young woman under a table and makes obscene jokes to her. Imagine Salieri’s astonishment when the young man hears the beginning of the music and hurries out to conduct it. Imagine Salieri’s horror when he realises that the music of this “dirty-minded creature” is sublime.\n\nThus begins Salieri’s lifelong hatred of Mozart, inspired by envy, but also by indignation that God has chosen Mozart as his vessel instead of Salieri. In Mozart’s music, Salieri is convinced that he hears “the voice of God”, but this only angers him more. “Why would God choose an obscene child as his instrument?” he laments.\n\nIf you are wondering why the film is called Amadeus and not Wolfgang or Mozart, it is because Amadeus means “love of God”. To Salieri, it seems that the “creature” (he refuses to regard Mozart as a human being) has God’s love, and he does not. His humourless piety is no match in God’s eyes for the crude earthy manners of Mozart. Salieri angrily puts an icon of the crucifix onto the fire, and declares war against God. He will defy God by destroying the unworthy instrument that God has chosen.\n\nIt might be thought from this description that the Mozart of this film is an odious figure, but this is not so. In fact he is a likeable young man, admirable only in his music, but by no means a terrible figure. He is a genius in his art. As a child he plays a perfect tune on the piano while blindfolded, and then repeats it note for note on the violin.\n\nAs an adult Mozart can play the piano while held upside down. When Salieri gets to see Mozart’s written compositions, he is shocked to notice that they have been written down, seemingly without corrections, the tunes seemingly already-finished in Mozart’s creative brain before he scribbles them down.\n\nHowever Mozart is no inaccessible tortured genius, but an impudent youth with a penetrating laugh. Like God, the Emperor treats Mozart indulgently. Joseph has no deep understanding of music. He yawns during The Marriage of Figaro, and complains about tunes that have “too many notes”.\n\nNonetheless he is a sincere patron of the arts who enjoys music. He gives Mozart leeway, even defying the advice of the conservative authorities who disapprove of Mozart’s work. Joseph allows Mozart to make an opera out of a banned play, and to include a ballet sequence in the opera. For some strange reason, ballets were banned at this time.\n\nMozart is polite enough to the Emperor and his superiors, but with a faint touch of rebelliousness beneath the surface. His wigs are frequently unruly as if they have not been combed, and occasionally have a tinge of pink in them. He is eager for praise after a performance, and he is exasperated with idiotic criticism. This is not unwarranted arrogance on Mozart’s part. His unshakeable faith in his own brilliance is entirely justified.\n\nThis puts Mozart on a collision course with Salieri, and the screenplay is a wonderful exercise in watching the talented composer absent-mindedly wounding the lesser man. Mozart makes comments about Salieri’s work that betray his veiled disdain, and which are not lost on Salieri. Salieri’s face shows a strained politeness that barely hides his hurt feelings.\n\nWhen Salieri composes a welcome march for the newly-arrived Mozart, the young man responds by commenting on the tune’s repetitive and limited qualities, and offering his own more inventive variation on it, turning the tune into a German dance that includes a refrain that will later be reused in The Marriage of Figaro.\n\nThe jealousy extends beyond chamber music, and into the bedchamber. Salieri is angry when he discovers that Mozart has ‘had’ Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole), an opera star that Salieri was lusting after. (Ironically the real Salieri was not as chaste as this fictional one, and it was he who ‘had’ the real Catarina, not Mozart.)\n\nLater Salieri tries to compel Mozart’s wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) into sleeping with him in exchange for recommending Mozart for a placement as a tutor. Constanze is a vulgar but loving wife. She is also a calculating woman with a good head for business, and willing to do this to help her husband’s career, but Salieri is unable to follow through.\n\nSo follows Salieri’s campaign to destroy his rival by spreading rumours about Mozart’s behaviour with women, scuppering his operas and undermining him at court. This culminates in a plan to bring about Mozart’s death.\n\nThe one man who has the capacity to intimidate and judge Mozart is his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice). Even after Leopold’s death, the father reappears as the stern figure who drags Don Giovanni to hell in Mozart’s opera. Salieri dresses in a black outfit that Leopold once wore to a masque and asks Mozart to compose a death mass.\n\nThus begins Mozart’s famous Requiem, that beautiful and sombre piece of music that seems like a death mass for the composer, since he died while writing it. Good friend Salieri is on hand to help Mozart complete the work, and perhaps steal credit for it later.\n\nWe get an intriguing glimpse into the creative mind, as the dying Mozart dictates the sheets to Salieri, producing superlative music, seemingly from his imagination. Salieri struggles to keep up with the quick mind of Mozart as the sick man rapidly fires out musical instructions to be written down. In this scene F Murray Abraham’s confusion was real, as Tom Hulce deliberately skipped lines of dialogue to bewilder him.\n\nSo Salieri succeeds only in forcing Mozart to produce one more work that will eclipse his own efforts. He may or may not have killed Mozart, though not by poisoning as in the popular legend. However Salieri watches his works fade from public consciousness, while Mozart grows in fame with every year. It is Mozart who has the last laugh – literally so, as we hear his manic laughter one final time as Salieri is wheeled away.\n\nIt might be thought that a film about spiteful envy and failure taken to lethal extremes would be a depressing one, but that is not the case. Amadeus is a film that elevates the human spirit by showing us the highest potential we can reach, albeit a level denied to most of us.\n\nForman films the production in as expansive a manner as possible. The film runs for around three hours, something that caused some difficulties in finding a major studio to finance the movie. The costumes, sets and musical arrangements are lavish, even during non-essential scenes. The film is well-lit, and yet only natural or authentic light is employed.\n\nThe actors too were inspired by the film to make greater efforts. F Murray Abraham learned to read and conduct music for the role, and Tom Hulce learned to play the piano. It has been said that every note that is struck on the screen corresponds to the sound that we would hear in reality. I am not sure if this is true, or if it is the result of careful editing, even if it is correct. However it shows the care and love for the music that the film inspired in everyone involved in its making.\n\nAudiences too were taken to new heights by the film. Despite its great length, nobody felt that the film had ‘too many notes’. It was nominated for 53 awards, and won 40. It was a great box office success. For a while there was an increased interest in hearing the music of Mozart, and even in listening to Salieri’s compositions.\n\nPerhaps that reflects the curious duality of our sympathies in watching Amadeus. We may identify more with the failure of a Salieri, but we are unable to help feeling drawn to the genius of Mozart."
