        "text": "The 1984 film Amadeus really is quite something. Strongly acted, a powerful storyline, great music (obviously...), beautifully shot. No wonder Miloš Forman’s work pretty much swept the board at the 1985 Academy Awards, including a win for Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nThe problem is when you start to think of the film as an accurate account of Mozart and Salieri’s relationship. Because it isn’t - well not completely, anyway. It’s a film. One of the other nominees in 1985 was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. No one is fact checking that one are they?\n\nBut it is concerning people who existed - and gives popular culture an unfair view of Salieri. So it’s worth a look at what is right (as far as we know) - and what is wrong.\n\n1.Did Mozart die in poverty?\n\nHe probably did. As depicted in Amadeus, he was careless with money. One of his last collaborators, the clarinetist Anton von Stadler, found it very easy to swindle the hapless composer out of a few florins, so loose was he with his cash. The image of the penniless composer on his deathbed has been disputed, though. An exhibition in Vienna in 2006, displayed documents showing Mozart earned a fortune, even at the end of his life.\n\n2.Was he buried in an unmarked Pauper’s grave?\n\nIt’s the common perception. But it’s almost certainly untrue – or has been misconstrued. Mozart was buried in a common grave, and this was the practice in those days in Vienna. He certainly wasn’t placed in a grand mausoleum – but he wasn’t chucked in a pit with quicklime either.\n\n3.Did he have a vulgar sense of humour?\n\nAlmost certainly true. He frequently used ‘colourful’ language and expressions in letters to his sister, his dad and other acquaintances. It’s a world away from his sublime music – or is it? In a letter to his cousin, he uses the extraordinary phrase 'Leck mich im Arsch'. (Doesn’t really need a translation). It’s a visual image became the title of his K.231 canon for six voices. And, although there’s no hint of them in the music, there are various insulting, jokey phrases scrawled on the manuscripts of his horn concertos. For example, “You ass”. The recipient of the music – and the taunts – was Mozart friend Joseph Leutgeb.\n\n4.Did Salieri hate Mozart?\n\nProbably not. It would, I admit, have been hard to not be just a teensy bit jealous of Mozart if you were one of the other composers working around the Viennese court in those days. But there’s no strong evidence that Salieri or any of these other Italian composers obstructed Mozart in any way, as Amadeus suggests. Salieri and Mozart were, in fact, on good terms at the time of Mozart’s death, and Salieri became the piano teacher of Mozart’s grieving son, Franz Xaver.\n\n5.Did Salieri commission Mozart’s Requiem?\n\nIn the film, it is he who appears as the mysterious, masked messenger to ask the dying Mozart for the Requiem. Amadeus also depicts Salieri as completing the work after Mozart’s death. As far as we know, neither is true. The Requiem was commissioned by an eccentric nobleman, Franz von Walsegg-Stupach, in memory of his wife. He may even have wanted to pass the work off as his own. And the Requiem was in fact completed by various other composers, mainly one of Mozart’s students, Franz Süssmayr.\n\n6.\n\nDid Salieri kill Mozart\n\nThis is the biggest claim in Amadeus, and central to the plot. The aging and infirm Salieri is even seen confessing to slowly poisoning Mozart to death. But it’s highly unlikely that this is true. We don’t know precisely what killed Mozart, but there are reports of severe swelling, skin issues and serious pain. Yes it could have been poison. But it’s more likely that one of history’s greatest musical geniuses died of a fever.\n\nRussell Torrance presents Classic Breakfast on ABC Classic (Monday to Friday, 6am–10am).\n\nImage Details\n\nActor Tom Hulce in the 1984 film Amadeus, directed by Milos Forman. Forman died April 14, 2018. He was 86."
