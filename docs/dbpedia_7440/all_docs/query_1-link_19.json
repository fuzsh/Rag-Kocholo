        "text": "Amadeus is an American dramatization film that follows the stage play Amadeus, about the supposed rivalry between the Italian director and composer Antonio Salieri and the venerable Amadeus Wolfgang Mozart, who of course needs no introduction. It stars an incredible cast, including F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri, Tom Hulce as Mozart, Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze Mozart, and Cynthia Nixon as Mozart’s “aid” and Salieri’s spy. The performances in this film are often widely considered to be some of the best in film history, with the movie being nominated for 11 academy awards, winning an Oscar for best picture. Murray Abraham, won an academy award for Best Actor, just barely taking the award over Tom Hulce, who was also nominated for Best Actor. The entire movie’s soundtrack is just Mozart’s work, which is not only perfect for the setting, but in and of itself likely the best works of music in history. In 2019, the film was nominated for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Its performances, casting, unbelievable costume work, music, and filming locations (shot in Prague, with some of the performances in the movie being redone at the theaters where these performances were originally debuted centuries earlier) amounts to nothing less than the culmination of Western High art, and it has committed a great injustice on a man’s good name, this being that the film has given its depiction of the play of the same name.\n\nThe movie’s plot closely resembles the play of the same name, beginning with two of Salieri’s rapacious and self-serving servants bringing pastries to his studying room, only to discover an attempted suicide by Salieri after he drops a knife on his pianos’ keys while proclaiming guilt for his murder of Mozart. Salieri is then committed to what passes for a psychiatric hospital in 1823. Given that Salieri has retained the lion’s share of his sanity, he is given his room with a piano for him to keep himself busy. A Roman Catholic priest is then brought into Salieri’s room to hear his confession, thinking that Salieri has not murdered Mozart. Saleri then gives his confession, which is more or less his entire life story. Keynotes among his story are his rise to prominence in the courts of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, his first encounter with Mozart at the Archbishop’s palace in Vienna, his scheming with others on the emperor’s court to take down Mozart, Mozart’s childlike behavior, his rocky relationship with his father Leopold, his eventual financial and emotional decline, and his eventual downfall and death.\n\nAs stated earlier, the movie is almost perfect, but I have one stipulation: none of it is true. The entire notion of the movie’s plot, that Salieri’s jealousy leads him to shun God, and murder Mozart in an attempt to steal his music, isn’t true. The movie makes a display of Salieri’s supposed infidelity and apostasy, literally burning a crucifix of Jesus on the cross, enticing Mozart’s wife for sexual favors in exchange for making a royal recommendation for government office for Mozart. At the end of the movie the priest giving his confession is too shocked to even say anything afterward. The movie is almost cruel in how it treats Saleri at the end, mockingly making Salieri proclaim himself as “The Patron Saint of Mediocrity”, and the movie ends with Salieri in a wheelchair absolving the priest, but all of his fellow patients in his psychiatric ward of their mediocrity."
