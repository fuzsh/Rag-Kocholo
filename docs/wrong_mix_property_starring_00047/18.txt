As we all gear up for legendary filmmaker George Miller‘s hotly anticipated FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA to drop, we thought the time was right to revisit the very first entry in his storied franchise, the original MAD MAX.

Set in a not-too-distant dystopian future, when man’s most precious resource — oil — has been depleted and the world plunged into war, famine and financial chaos, the last vestiges of the law in Australia attempt to restrain a vicious biker gang. Max (Mel Gibson, in the role that launched his career), an officer with the Main Force Patrol, launches a personal vendetta against the gang when his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son are hunted down and murdered, leaving him with nothing but the instincts for survival and retribution.

“Staging the improbable car stunts and crashes to perfection, director George Miller succeeds completely in bringing the violent, post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max to visceral life.” (Rotten Tomatoes)

“If punk is a sensibility as well as an adjective, ‘Mad Max’ is a punk movie. Its Australian setting enhances it, authenticating its futuristic aura.” (Boston Globe)

“[The] film has been consigned to the grind houses, where audiences are responding as Miller wants them to. From there Mad Max will find its way to the film schools and revival houses, where its tough-gutted intelligence may be appreciated.” (TIME Magazine)

“If you haven’t seen writer-director George Miller’s ‘Mad Max’ in quite some time, then it’s very likely you’re not even remembering it right.” (Film Frenzy)
