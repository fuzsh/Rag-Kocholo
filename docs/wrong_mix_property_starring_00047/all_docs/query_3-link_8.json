        "text": "An Australian actress who was cast in various Australian action films in the 1980s, Joanne Samuel has acted on major motion pictures, as well as playing recurring roles on television series. When Samuel was a frequent face on television, she acted on the Australian soap opera \"The Young Doctors,\" but was written out when chosen to play Mel Gibson's wife in \"Mad Max.\" The original actress for the character had gotten into a car accident and Samuel was the back-up for the part. The dystopian action film introduced the world to Australian New Wave cinema and Samuel became a sought-after actress. She became a regular fixture on the long-running soap opera \"Skyways,\" and remained on the show for over 100 episodes. Samuel's first leading role was in the horror film \"Alison's Birthday,\" playing a teenager terrorized by a deadly religious cult. In 1987, the actress was seen in the action thriller \"Nightmaster\" opposite Nicole Kidman. By the 1990s, Samuel became interested in family oriented projects and appeared in the Australian sitcom \"Hey Dad...!,\" which chronicled the life of a single father raising his children. She has also played the school principal in the immensely popular children's musical group film \"The Wiggles Movie.\" Before she retired from acting, her last appearance was on the medical drama \"All Saints.\""
