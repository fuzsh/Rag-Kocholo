        "text": "#5 in my ranking of the Mad Max franchise.\n\nPeter Weir‘s The Cars that Ate Paris helped to ignite the whole crazy cars craze in Australian exploitation cinema, and one of the beneficiaries of that was a young doctor turned filmmaker George Miller. Aiming to make a silent film with sound, telling the story kinetically, it’s obvious from the very beginning that Miller was a consummate director, but the script he had developed with James McCausland, demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge of how movies work dramatically, prioritizing action beats and world-building over actual dramatic arcs properly laid out. It’s an interesting contrast.\n\nIn a decaying world where authority is becoming both more extreme and less effective at maintaining order, the roads are becoming battlegrounds between the Main Force Patrol and the crazies who ride them. We start with a complex and ever-changing chase between Nightrider (Vincent Gil) and the police where Nightrider makes mincemeat of two separate patrol cars before Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) gets involved, scares the Nightrider so much in a game of chicken that all of his bravado is sucked out of him in an instant, and watches as Nightrider crashes and burns. This opening is really strong, action filmmaking, and it shows that Miller was a force to be reckoned with from the start. It’s followed up with a look at the world through the eyes of the MFP, their degrading supplies around cars, and the need to keep Max on the force because he’s the best of them, up to an including Max’s captain, Fifi (Roger Ward), securing materials for a souped-up V8 interceptor that will surely get used later, yes?\n\nThis opening twenty minutes is probably the best in the film, and it’s kind of unfortunate because that strong opening yields to a largely meandering following hour or so where there’s this search for a story. It centers around the Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the leader of a biker gang, seeking vengeance for Nightrider’s death. Now, a more competently written script would have the Toecutter zeroing in on Max pretty early in this journey. Instead, the Toecutter is more about general mayhem while talking about getting vengeance for Nightrider. He terrorizes the small town where Nightrider’s body gets delivered. He chases down random people who happen to be nearby. He eventually gets around to killing some cops, but it feels more incidental rather than an intentional effort on his part to get closer to the man who killed Nightrider.\n\nAt the same time, Max is hanging with his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and their baby, generally being happy but without any real sense of danger to themselves. Sure, Max feels some pressure when talking to Fifi about wanting to quit or when he’s out on the road, but he’s not being targeted and neither is his family. And the film takes this on for a surprisingly long amount of time. It’s like we’re watching random events rather than a dramatic series of events building towards a conclusion.\n\nHowever, it does ultimately come together in the form of a revene story…about 75% of the way through the film when the Toecutter happens to come across Jessie and the baby while the Rockatansky family is out on a vacation drive, his gang chases her down and kills the two. Finally, the Toecutter and Max are on a path towards vengeance and destruction, and the film picks up once again with Max getting all decked out in black, taking the souped-up black Interceptor, and heading on a crash course to the Toecutter.\n\nSo, where’s the appeal outside of the first twenty minutes and the final ten? Are the other sixty minutes just worthless tedium? Not really. They have individual charms that just don’t feed the rest of the narrative all that well. A lot of it has to do with performances. Keays-Byrne is something of a crazed force as the main antagonist, and he’s interesting whenever he’s on screen. Gibson is, of course, the star, and he shows that he’s a real actor from the beginning, providing Max with all of his skills even in this silly bit of exploitation. I also get a kick out of Ward, nearly always shirtless, trying to lord over Max. Samuel, though, is largely a nothing as Jessie, her role really not having much to work with to be completely honest. I remember the first time I watched this film, many moons ago, and I centered my lack of enthusiasm on the film around the family dynamics between Max and Jessie being too perfect. Well, I think that’s still something of an issue, they feel too fairy tale for my tastes, but it’s honestly a small part of the film until…you know…she’s brutally run down.\n\nIf the point of Max’s change in the end towards him being the eponymous Mad, then the focus should probably be a bit more about him and Jessie while mixed with his desire to protect her instead of just enjoy a drive out into the peaceful Australian countryside (which undermines the whole world in collapse thing). The script really needed a rewrite to refocus things towards that sense of danger and revenge because when that sense of danger, decay, and revenge is front and center, the film works best.\n\nSo, the real star is George Miller, director, but the real drag is George Miller, co-screenwriter. Another draft, potentially written by someone else, could have smoothed things out and given it real dramatic structure, but the director did his all with what he had.\n\nRating: 2.5/4"
