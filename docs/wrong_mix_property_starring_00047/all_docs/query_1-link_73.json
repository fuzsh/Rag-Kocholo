He was even caught giving the younger singer-songwriter a neck massage at a well-liked Hollywood eating place. The courting didnât closing very long, regardless that.\n\n17 Head Over Heels: Violet Kowal\n\nItâs no longer actually sensible to cheat on a spouse when youâre probably the most well-known faces on the earth, but, alas, this appears to be what took place with Mel.

It was a rant in opposition to her that used to be the starting block of his troubles.\n\n15 Head Over Heels: Leslie Hamel\n\nIt has gave the impression that Mel led type of a double existence whilst he was married to Moore, which included a secret relationship with actress Suzanne Somersâ step-daughter, Leslie Hamel.

But thatâs all.\n\n12 No Chance: Julia Roberts\n\nThis one is sensible â as in, they might glance just right together as a couple, but it just wasnât supposed to be. Julia Roberts was once Melâs leading lady in Conspiracy Theory, however each were in relationships/marriages on the time. Their chemistry was once undeniable and, in fact, rumors began, but each events say that friendship is all thatâs between them.\n\n11 No Chance: Maria Bello\n\nDuring the 90s and the early 2000s, Mel used to be starring in films with some well-known, and very stunning, women, one in every of whom used to be Maria Bello of Coyote Ugly popularity. Both starred within the 1999 mystery Payback. At the time, Mel was once running round on his first wife, Maria used to be with boyfriend Dan McDermott, and she seems like the kind to knock any person out for cheating.\n\n10 No Chance: Rene Russo\n\nActress Rene Russo occurs to be one of Melâs closest female pals and anyone who has no longer best began in numerous films with him however has subsidized him up every so often. They both starred in the Lethal Weapon franchise and even got in combination a few years again to be able to have fun the anniversary. But relationship? No, by no means.\n\n9 No Chance: Sarah Silverman\n\nWhile a large number of Hollywood has forgiven Mel Gibson for his appalling past and phrases, one particular person has now not: comedian Sarah Silverman. When it was once introduced that Gibson would co-write and direct the remake of the movie The Wild Bunch, Silverman quoted Gibsonâs anti-Semitic rant and used to be subsidized up through every other tough women. No love lost between those two.\n\n8 No Chance: Whoopi Goldberg\n\nWhile a large number of the Hollywood elite have both forgiven Mel or just forget about his past behavior, every other girl in his nook is actress Whoopi Goldberg, who, when on The View, loudly sponsored up her pal when the other women have been attacking him at the air. Does this imply there are feelings concerned? Highly unsure. Sheâs only a excellent pal.\n\n7 No Chance: Helen Hunt\n\nOne of Melâs more memorable romantic comedy roles was once within the hit film What Women Want, where Mel may just learn the minds of women and begins to make use of it to his merit. His romantic pastime within the film used to be additionally his pageant, played by Helen Hunt. Both had atypical chemistry in the movie but it by no means went beyond that.\n\n6 No Chance: Goldie Hawn\n\nNot many of us have in mind the film Bird on a Wire, which starred Mel as a person who faked his loss of life with the intention to get away from some bad guys.

During this time, Hawn used to be with Kurt Russell.\n\n5 No Chance: Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nMel has been recognized to have some beautiful tough women friends, even after his occupation and private life spiraled into a freefall. Mainly women who he had worked with up to now, like Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred with him in Forever Young. While Curtis continues to be a pal of Melâs, she doesnât in reality talk about him a lot (for excellent explanation why, we assume).\n\n4 No Chance: Joanne Samuel\n\nYou would possibly recognize Joanne Samuel from her look as Melâs spouse within the movie Mad Max. âHe had âitâ â your eyes just went to him,â she stated in a radio interview. âHe used to be a phenomenal actor, a classically trained actorâ¦but he did have that superb presence on screen that set him apart.â The two are buddies (and best buddies) nowadays.\n\n3 No Chance: Teresa Palmer\n\nJust by having a look at her, youâd figure that actress Teresa Palmer is EXACTLY Melâs type of lady friend this present day (sheâs way more youthful than him and has slightly little bit of the same look that a few of his other present girlfriends have). But, nope, sheâs just some of the beauties who starred in his film Hacksaw Ridge and gushes over the director.\n\n2 No Chance: Joely Richardson\n\nSure, all of us consider the memorable scenes that featured Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger from the movie The Patriot â mainly as a result of that they had some good ones enjoying father and son. But there was once also some between Joely Richardson, who performed Melâs past due wifeâs sister and the aunt to his children. Their chemistry was once abstract, but you felt it. Too unhealthy theyâre simply pals.\n\n1 No Chance: Marisa Tomi\n\nBased on the seems to be of this very photo, actress Marisa Tomi seems to be utterly enamored with her former co-star Mel Gibson. Theyâre walking the purple carpet right here right through the premiere of What Women Want, the place Tomi performs, you guessed it, a lady enamored with Mel. Maybe it was just for the sake of the movie? Unfortunately, they too by no means dated.\n\nReferences: dailymail.co.uk, vanityfair.com, hope1032.com.au, indiewire.com\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhuZq%2BforKvecyeo2afmZfAsLqMoZisZZSWwaawjGpqZq%2BYpHq4u9Slm6esXZmus7GO"
