The play explores the lives and discoveries of three brilliant women, Henrietta Leavitt, Annie Cannon, and Williamina Fleming who worked at the Harvard Observatory as “human\n\ncomputers” in the early 1900s. As women, they were expected to “resist the temptation to analyze” and simply log discoveries made by men. Their work was measured in “girl hours,” and they were not permitted to touch the “Great Refractor” telescope.\n\nDespite such restrictions, Henrietta, Annie, and Williamina chart thousands of stars, and their exciting discoveries set the standard still used today for measuring distances in space. However, their success comes at a cost to their personal lives. Based on the real-life contributions of these three historical figures, Silent Sky celebrates these\n\nremarkable women, who, through their humor and perseverance, fought for professional recognition--and respect--in a man’s world.\n\nSHOUT!\n\nIt was a year-long Spoken Word festival, with performances on:\n\nSep 22, 2021; Oct 27, 2021; Nov 17, 2021, and Jan 25, 2022 in Thompson Recital Hall, with Guest Artists and DePauw students performing, culminating in DePauw students performing their original work on March 11-12, 2022 in Meharry Hall.\n\nThe production was then chosen for the Region 3 Festival of the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival to represent Indiana at the Celebration of Associate Productions, where there was one last performance at the Region 3 Festival in Flint, Michigan in January of 2023.\n\nshout:verb\n\nto speak with a very loud voice, often as loud as possible, usually when you want to make yourself heard in noisy situations, or when the person you are talking to is a long way away or cannot hear very well:DePauw Theatre, in conjunction with the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, present SHOUT!

The production will bring in guest poets to provide workshops and performances in preparation for our Grand Finale spring production.\n\nWords are powerful. They can be weapons that wound, they can be twisting lies that cut like a cold wind, they can be shared whispers between loved ones.

Visited by the ghosts of former students and acquaintances, the old man tries to defend himself, believing the answer lies coded somewhere between the lyrics to Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and the process of building a giant kayak.\n\nEdges Proximity: Songs for the Pandemic\n\nSelections from:\n\nEdges\n\nThe Theory of Relativity\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Edges)\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Neil Bartram (The Theory of Relativity)\n\nDirected by Tim Good\n\nMusic Direction and Video Editing by Steven Linville '06\n\nCoaching and Piano Accompaniment by Laura Brumbaugh\n\nAudio Editing by Matt Johnson\n\nPart One: Belonging • Nov. 7, 2020 • Watch on YouTube!\n\nPart Two: Relationships • Nov. 21, 2020 • Watch on YouTube!\n\nPart Three: Interwoven Lives • Dec. 19, 2020 • Watch on YouTube!\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL\n\nBy Charles Dickens\n\nA Zoom Production\n\nThis Christmas Eve classic follows Ebenezer Scrooge as he’s haunted by the ghosts of his past, present, and future.

Giving new writers a voice and venue has been a priority for nearly thirty years in DePauw Theatre, and this year we present three short plays by women writers. In Where’s the PA? by senior Megan Mannering, a production assistant on a popular reality show finds herself thrust into a starring role when the lead actress stomps off the set. As a popularity storm roars on social media, our spotlighted heroine finds herself forced to confront her true self rather than her mediated fabrication. A Father’s Joy, by senior Kate Woods, finds an estranged daughter tasked with eulogizing the dead father she blames for her mother’s untimely death. The problem is the dead father wants the last word. And in Online Classes, by senior Caroline Knight, good intentions go south when a young teacher creates a falsified online persona to “friend” a social outcast from her class.\n\nTROJAN WOMEN\n\nDIRECTED BY CAROLINE GOOD\n\nAPRIL 11-13 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nAPRIL 14 | 1 P.M.\n\nEuripides’ Trojan Women is the one of the greatest anti-war plays ever written. It depicts the suffering of women and children after every war. It has been used many times to protest against war and to act as a warning for audiences who see it. It can also be a consolation for those who are suffering, because in it they see that over the ages, others too have suffered. In our moment in time when war should be obsolete, it is a time filled with perpetual war, fueled by a hunger for power, and yet rather than spreading democracy, the tragedy of displacement, death, and destruction is spread and must be endured by those current victims of war, just like the Trojan women. In contrast to the grief of the women, the barbarism of the so-called civilized Greeks is an indictment of all imperialists. Hence, the unfortunate relevance today of this story that was written over 2,000 years ago.\n\nSPRING SPECTACLE OF SHAKESPEARE\n\nDIRECTED BY SHAKESPEARE IN THE SCHOOLS STUDENTS\n\nPROGRAM DIRECTOR AND INSTRUCTOR OF SHAKESPEARE IN THE SCHOOLS COURSE, GIGI JENNEWEIN\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 4\n\nCloverdale Schools\n\nSouth Putnam Schools\n\nNorth Putnam Schools\n\nGreencastle High School\n\nIn its 8th year, the Spring Spectacle is a partnership between DePauw University and Putnam County schools. The program trains DPU students to direct local middle and high school students in the mounting of fully staged 90-minute Shakespeare plays. The Spring Spectacle is inspired by and produced in association with Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, MA.\n\nYOUNG FRANKENSTEIN\n\nBOOK BY MEL BROOKS AND THOMAS MEEHAN\n\nMUSIC AND LYRICS BY MEL BROOKS\n\nDIRECTED BY STEVE TIMM\n\nMUSICAL DIRECTION BY STEVEN LINVILLE ’06\n\nCHOREOGRAPHY BY JARED NORMAN ’12\n\nOCT. 5-7 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nOCT. 8 | 1 P.M.\n\nFrom the creators of the record-breaking Broadway sensation, The Producers, comes this monster new musical comedy. The comedy genius, Mel Brooks, adapts his legendarily funny film into a brilliant stage creation – Young Frankenstein!\n\nGrandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced \"Fronk-en-steen\") inherits his family's estate in Transylvania. With the help of a hunchbacked sidekick, Igor (pronounced \"Eye-gore\"), and a leggy lab assistant, Inga (pronounced normally), Frederick finds himself in the mad scientist shoes of his ancestors. \"It's alive!\" he exclaims as he brings to life a creature to rival his grandfather's. Eventually, of course, the monster escapes and hilarity continuously abounds.\n\nEvery bit as relevant to audience members who will remember the original as it will be to newcomers, Young Frankenstein has all the of panache of the screen sensation with a little extra theatrical flair added. It will surely be the perfect opportunity for a production company to showcase an array of talents. With such memorable tunes as \"The Transylvania Mania,\" \"He Vas My Boyfriend\" and \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" Young Frankenstein is scientifically proven, monstrously good entertainment.\n\nOriginally Produced on Broadway By Elliot Martin, Vy Higginsen and Ken Wydro; produced in association with Yale Repertory Theatre (Lloyd Richards, Artistic Director; Benjamin Mordecai, Managing Director); associate producer, Jeffrey Steiner, Kery Davis and Charles Grantham. World Premiere at Yale Repertory Theatre; Second Production at Huntington Theatre Company (Peter Altman, Producing Director; Michael Maso, Managing Director); Originally presented as a staged reading at the 1984 National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Cent\n\nPresented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI).\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST\n\nWRITTEN BY OSCAR WILDE\n\nDIRECTED BY M. SUSAN ANTHONY\n\nNOV. 16-18 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nNOV. 19 | 1 P.M.\n\nJoin Algy and Jack, two dashing (and clueless) men about town, and Cecily and Gwendolyn, two charming (and ruthless) young women bent upon matrimony. Add an orphan infant in a handbag, two sickly imaginary dependents, and the infamous Lady Bracknell – and you have The Importance of Being Earnest. Oscar Wilde’s farcical comedy, subtitled “A Trivial Comedy for Serious People,” has delighted audiences since its premiere in 1895. No one is what he (or she) seems in Earnest – and Wilde’s scathing satire mocks social conventions, pomp and pretense – and marriage. In particular, The Importance of Being Earnest skewers stereotypical gender relations and introduces the “New Woman” in a frothy comedy often deemed “the greatest English stage comedy of all time.”\n\nJOE TURNER'S COME AND GONE\n\nWRITTEN BY AUGUST WILSON\n\nDIRECTED BY GUEST ARTIST KATHRYN BENTLEY,\n\nARTISTIC DIRECTOR, BLACK THEATRE WORKSHOP, SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY EDWARDSVILLE\n\nFEB. 1-3 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nFEB. 4 | 1 P.M.\n\nAugust Wilson's Joe Turner's Come and Gone is set in a Pittsburgh boarding house in 1911. Owners Seth and Bertha Holly play host to a makeshift family of people who come to stay, some for days, some longer, during the Great Migration of the 1910s when descendants of former slaves moved in large numbers from the South toward the industrial cities of the North, seeking new jobs, new lives and new beginnings.\n\nAmong those on the move are Herald Loomis and his young daughter, Zonia. Haunted by the past, they are headed wherever the road takes them in search of the long gone Martha, Herald's wife, and Zonia's mother. Herald arrives at the boarding house unsettled, dark and secretive. Seth Holly is suspicious and wants him out almost as soon as he arrives, but Bertha and the others see him differently, and by action and example, they help set him on the way to recovering his lost spirit and finding a new life. Directed by Guest Artist Kathryn Bentley, Director of the Black Theatre Workshop at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n\nJoe Turner’s Come and Gone is presented by special arrangement with SAMUEL FRENCH, INC.\n\nHAMLET MOSTLY\n\nDIRECTED BY ANDREW HAYES\n\nAPRIL 12-14 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nAPRIL 15 | 1 P.M.\n\nHamlet is Shakespeare’s most recognizable play, but whose story is it? Join us for a mostly Shakespeare language performance that explores the interpretation, ideas and relationships of the play we all know so well through an experimental and energetic re-telling of the story. Hamlet Mostly is a collaboration between its original storyteller, the man we think we know as Shakespeare, and this production's director, cast and crew.\n\nSPRING SPECTACLE OF SHAKESPEARE\n\nDIRECTED BY SHAKESPEARE IN THE SCHOOLS STUDENTS PROGRAM\n\nDIRECTOR AND INSTRUCTOR OF SHAKESPEARE IN THE SCHOOLS COURSE, GIGI JENNEWEIN\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 5\n\n1 P.M.

This is the central question in Bertolt Brecht’s timeless parable about Shen Te, the good prostitute, who must ultimately employ bad practices to have even the most basic of life’s necessities. While the title of the play suggests a Chinese setting, it is no stretch to imagine – as we do – that the story happens in a modern U.S. city, in one of those places, according to Brecht “where man is exploited by man.”\n\nWhen Shen Te alone satisfies the need of visiting “gods” to prove success with their governing policies, she is rewarded with money. Not unsurprisingly, Shen Te uses her windfall to better herself and the lives of her impoverished friends and neighbors. But her good deeds are exploited and impossible to sustain, and Shen Te is forced to resort to deceit and oppression nearly killing off her much desired and admired goodness.\n\nAs with most of his work, Brecht is critiquing societal politics that make it so difficult to adhere to moral principles. And he hopes – as do we – that his work will inspire play-goers to question why and work towards change.\n\nSTREET SCENES OF PUTNAM COUNTY AND DEPAUW: ORIGINAL STORIES BY, FOR AND ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY\n\nCOLLECTIVELY CREATED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS\n\nDIRECTED BY TIM GOOD\n\nMARCH 16-18 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nMARCH 19 | 1 P.M.\n\nANGELS IN AMERICA, PART ONE: MILLENNIUM APPROACHES\n\nWRITTEN BY TONY KUSHNER\n\nDIRECTED BY STEVE TIMM\n\nAPRIL 21-22 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nAPRIL 23 | 1 P.M.\n\nAngels in America, Part One: Millennium Approaches is the first half of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize winning drama detailing the lives of two couples struggling to make sense in a world torn apart by disease, sex and religion.

A prodigiously smart piece of theatre that touches on fractal geometry, gossipy speculation about Lord Byron, contemporary academic backbiting and the physics of uncertainty.\"\n\n-San Francisco Chronicle\n\nSEMINAR\n\nBY THERESA REBECK\n\nDIRECTED BY M.

The musical Parade challenges the problems of anti-Semitism, racism, provincialism and blind hate, by asking us to get to know these characters as real people. The music and lyrics by Tony Award-winning composer Jason Robert Brown (The Bridges of Madison County, Songs for a New World), take you on an emotional and personal journey inside the relationships and problems of the people caught in this turmoil. Parade transcends the surface of the case, and asks us to consider whether the real evil doesn’t live inside each of us.\n\nPresented by DePauw Theatre and the School of Music with support from the Prindle Institute for Ethics and funding from the Anne Prindle Johnson and David S.

Inspired by encounters during his sabbatical travels to the Everglades, wild rivers of Montana, isolated waterways of northern Florida and boreal forests of the north country, Timm’s characters confront a variety of nightmares, fears, shortcomings and creatures – both human and non-human – on the path to discovery, strength and purpose. Some of the pieces contain adult language and situations.\n\nLIVING DEAD IN DENMARK\n\nBY QUI NGUYEN\n\nDIRECTED BY ANDREW HAYES\n\nMARCH 12-14 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nMARCH 15 | 1 P.M.\n\nWhat if Shakespeare’s characters lived on … no, I mean really lived on as in becoming the undead? That fantasy is the premise of this lively contemporary mash-up of characters from Shakespeare’s plays. What would happen if Ophelia and others were raised from the dead to help the humans fight a Zombie Lord? Spectacular fights and irreverent modern language frame this exploration of familiar characters in a whole new light. May the strongest characters win!\n\nANTIGONE\n\nBY SOPHOCLES\n\nDIRECTED BY CAROLINE GOOD\n\nAPRIL 16-18 | 7:30 P.M.\n\nAPRIL 19 | 3 P.M.\n\nAntigone is a high-stakes, driven, dense drama between the rule-followers and rebels. Antigone’s choices require her to obey divine law and defy authority in order to bury her dead brother. She chooses family over the state and through her civil disobedience, she risks everything. In the ancient Greek tradition, Sophocles’ play explores loyalty – loyalty to family and loyalty to the state. Antigone is an underdog fighting against the establishment, which speaks to us today just as much as it spoke to Athenian audiences over 2,000 years ago.\n\nSPRING SPECTACLE OF SHAKESPEARE\n\nDIRECTED BY AMY HAYES\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 2\n\n2 P.M.

SUSAN ANTHONY\n\nNOV. 21 - 23, 7:30 PM\n\nNOV. 24, 1:00 PM\n\nPoor Mary Haines. As the pampered wife of wealthy Stephen Haines and a Park Avenue socialite in 1930s New York, she believes that her life is perfect. Mary’s friends, however, inform her that her husband is having an affair with Crystal, a perfume-counter salesgirl. Mary must now deal with her straying husband, his scheming mistress, and Mary’s own circle of “friends,” who offer loud and frequent opinions about what she should do. Written by Luce, playwright, journalist, and congresswoman, The Women is a classic of the American stage. Described as a “wicked comedy,” The Women offers a biting critique of women’s relationships with each other – and prompts spectators to consider the nature of happy marriages and true friends.\n\nAs the playwright stated, “The women who inspired this play deserved to be smacked across the head with a meat axe, and that, I flatter myself, is exactly what I smacked them with.” – Clare Booth Luce\n\nFALL FESTIVAL OF SHAKESPEARE AT DEPAUW\n\nFESTIVAL DIRECTOR - AMY HAYES\n\nASSISTANT FESTIVAL DIRECTOR - GIGI JENNEWEIN\n\nDEC. 13, 6 P.M. - TAMING OF THE SHREW, CLOVERDALE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS\n\nDEC. 13, 8 P.M. - ROMEO AND JULIET, GREENCASTLE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS\n\nDEC. 7, 3 P.M. - MERCHANT OF VENICE, NORTH PUTNAM MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS\n\nDEC. 7, 5 P.M. - AS YOU LIKE IT, SOUTH PUTNAM MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS\n\nACHILLES/ACHILLES' SON\n\nBY SEAN GRANEY\n\nDIRECTED BY TIM GOOD\n\nJAN. 20, 7:30 PM\n\nJAN. 26, 1:00 PM\n\nJAN. 27-29, 7:30 PM\n\nAchilles/Achilles’ Son is Sean Graney's bold, new take on seven ancient Greek tragedies focused on the Trojan War. (Aeschylus’ The Persians, Sophocles’ Philoktetes and Ajax, Euripides’ Iphigenia in Aulis, Rhesus, Hecuba and The Trojan Woman.) It offers a forum for exploring our current universal problems, addressing the need for citizens to be active, helpful parts of their society.\n\nThe project mirrors Greek communal festivals, mixing theater, music, food and debate. Achilles/Achilles’ Son seeks to create a micro-society, where we can discuss ethical issues raised in the play. These issues include, but are not limited to: the role of leadership, the value of life, respect for the dead, the nature of war and responsibility to family. Free food included.\n\nTHE COMEDY OF ERRORS\n\nBY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n\nDIRECTED BY ANDREW HAYES\n\nAPRIL 10-12, 7:30 PM\n\nAPRIL 13, 1:00 PM\n\nWhat happens when not one, but two sets of identical twins that were separated shortly after birth suddenly find themselves in the same city? Come and see. Shakespeare’s first play tells the comic tale of these two sets of twins whom fate separated then reunited. In our Wild West version, the twins find themselves in the American West of the 1870’s. When Antipholus and Dromio of Omaha find themselves in Monterey, California, wives mistake husbands, masters mistake servants and general mayhem ensues.\n\nINTO THE WOODS\n\nMUSIC AND LYRICS BY STEPHEN SONDHEIM\n\nBOOK BY JAMES LAPINE\n\nDIRECTED BY TIM GOOD\n\nMUSIC DIRECTION BY STEVEN LINVILLE ’06\n\nCHOREOGRAPHED BY DEBORAH GRAMMEL\n\nSEPTEMBER 27-29, 2012 - 7:30 P.M.\n\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2012 - 3 P.M.\n\nInto the Woods starts with familiar fairy tales, such as Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella, but very soon asks hard questions about the meaning of community, and how we treat each other. Witches can be right; Giants can be good. Supported by a full orchestra, the stirring music of Stephen Sondheim is brought to life to remind us that even though the “woods” are dark and dim, our strength lies in the fact that we all depend on you, me, her and him.\n\nPresented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI).\n\nTHE CRUCIBLE\n\nWRITTEN BY ARTHUR MILLER\n\nDIRECTED BY M. SUSAN ANTHONY\n\nNOVEMBER 8-9, 2012 - 7:30 P.M.\n\nNOVEMBER 11, 2012 - 5 P.M.\n\nNOVEMBER 13-17 - 7:30 P.M.\n\n“I have given you my soul, leave me my name!” cries John Proctor, as he rages against the atrocities occurring at Salem, Massachusetts in 1692. This production will be part of a community-wide conversation centered on the question “What are you willing to put your name to?” Described as a “gripping” and “powerful drama,” this Tony-award winning play depicts a dark time in colonial Massachusetts, when fear and greed incited the persecution of innocents accused of witchcraft.\n\nBroadway star and 1958 DePauw University graduate David Cryer will portray the fiery Deputy-Governor in a production of The Crucible at his alma mater in November. Cryer and his wife, choreographer and actress Britt Swanson, will join a cast of students and local actors Larry Sutton (DePauw professor emeritus of communication and theatre) and Jack Randall Earles in the Tony Award-winning play by Arthur Miller.\n\nBATTLE, BABY, BIRD: NEW WORKS BY DEPAUW PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nDIRECTED BY STEVE TIMM\n\nMARCH 7-9, 2013 - 7:30 P.M.\n\nMARCH 10, 2013 - 3:00 P.M.\n\nDePauw Theatre's long tradition of encouraging and developing student written plays goes mainstage with these original student works.

The New York Times writes, “… Mr. Whelan is a speculative playwright with a keen sense of history.” London’s The Daily Telegraph states, “Every character comes to life and, although he doesn’t appear, Shakespeare is a powerful presence… He (Whelan) writes beautifully…\n\nTHE SPRING SPECTACLE OF SHAKESPEARE AT DEPAUW\n\nDIRECTED BY AMY HAYES\n\nMAY 3, 2013, MOORE THEATRE, GCPA\n\n6 P.M.

JULIUS CAESAR (NPHS, NPMS)\n\nInitially funded by a Ball Venture Grant, this program is based on a nationally recognized and awarded program started by Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, MA. It exists to bring Shakespeare into the lives of teenagers, enabling them to experience the height and breadth of Shakespeare’s emotion, characters and stories through physical and tangible performance, while empowering them with Shakespeare’s language. At DePauw, we train University students to work with high school and middle school students, teaching the material in a trusting and energetic environment by going into the schools every week and shepherding the students on their own turf. The younger students learn to use and trust their bodies and their voices to these demanding and rewarding plays. The program culminates in a festival of Shakespeare performances at the end of the semester.\n\nURINETOWN\n\nMusic by Mark Hollmann\n\nLyrics by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis\n\nBook by Greg Kotis\n\nDirected by Susan Anthony\n\nMusic Direction by Steven Linville ’06\n\nThe 2002 Tony award-winning Urinetown depicts the harshness of life in a society that has depleted its natural resources. Following a 20-year drought, the worldwide water shortage has led to a government ban on private toilets, and all of the \"public amenities\" are controlled by one powerful company that profits – by charging admission. A young hero emerges to inspire the desperate poor to rebel. Musical numbers in Urinetown parody famous songs from Broadway hits, including Les Miserables, Evita, West Side Story and Annie. One critic notes, “ Of course, you’re not supposed to like that title – that’s part of the big, good-natured and remarkable successful joke that is Urinetown.” You won’t want to miss this “… terrifically spirited send-up of musicals and their conventions.”\n\nPresented through arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI).\n\nHEDDA GABLER\n\nBy Henrik Ibsen\n\nDirected by Larry Sutton\n\nIn 1890 Henrik Ibsen created what many think is his most interesting and revealing study of a woman’s character – Hedda Gabler. The play is traditional in structure but breaks away from overly sentimental plays of the earlier 19th century and presents a world in which traditional social convention and morality appear inconsistent and irrelevant. The character of Hedda is a study of a frustrated, isolated woman striving to assert herself and control the world around her. Although she appears clever, assured, and proud, she lacks the inner strength to live independently of the world’s social and moral conventions.\n\nPresented through arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI).\n\nMYSTERIES ... AND SMALLER PIECES\n\nCollectively Created by The Living Theatre\n\nDirected by Tim Good\n\nMysteries ... and Smaller Pieces is a collective creation by The Living Theatre that changed theatrical history. Mysteries is the first play to be presented on the world’s major stages without fictional characters, plot, scenery or costumes. The virtually wordless composition redefines the nature of theater as pure communication between performers and audience. Relying on nonverbal sounds and improvised actions, Mysteries invokes the Dionysian sources of drama, offering the audience the opportunity of assisting in a series of rituals meant to liberate the actor’s deepest resources.\n\nThe Heidi Chronicles\n\nBy Wendy Wasserstein\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nWhat has the Women’s Movement done for women? The Heidi Chronicles, the 1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Wendy Wasserstein asks this and other questions by tracing the life of a female art historian. Wasserstein’s main character, Heidi Holland, comes of age during the pivotal years of the Women’s Movement. Through her relationships with both men and women, we watch her struggle to determine what women have really gained and at what cost. The play has a wonderful mixture of probing intellectual questions and old-fashioned theatrical humor. Come see what the New York Daily News called, “not just a funny play, but a wise one.”\n\nGERDA’S STORY: MEMOIR OF A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR\n\nBASED ON THE MEMOIR OF GERDA NOTHMANN LUNER\n\nDRAMATIZED BY TIM GOOD AND J.C. PANKRATZ '12\n\nDIRECTED BY TIM GOOD\n\nThis moving tale is based on the authentic account of Gerda Nothmann Luner’s Holocaust survival. As a young girl, all of Gerda’s hopes and dreams are forever shattered when Nazis invade her homeland. Alone, Gerda journeys to safety by way of a foster family in Holland, experiencing arrest, deportation, and a remarkable series of circumstances that lead to her emigration to America. A post-performance discussion on Friday will feature Gerda's husband, Charles Luner. Don’t miss this extraordinary narrative of hope and courage.\n\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING\n\nWritten by William Shakespeare\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nWhat happens when the battle is over and the victorious and vanquished return home? Love, of course. Join us for a new twist on Shakespeare’s timeless comedy. Our setting is DePauw University, 1925. Pedro, Claudio, and Benedick return to Greencastle having triumphed at Wabash in the annual Monon Bell Game. Lucky Claudio also scores the love of the Mayor’s daughter, Hero. But Wabash’s John, Pedro’s brother, is a disgruntled loser in the classic rivalry, and instigates a vengeful plan to disgrace Claudio’s fiancée and destroy the intended marriage. Can love triumph over deception? Watch as the various plots twist and unravel in this comic race to happiness.\n\nAT THE DINER\n\nWritten by Emily Terrell '11\n\nDirected by Steve Timm\n\nLoosely based on the Greek myth of Io, At the Diner tells the story of a young woman waitressing at a Midwest diner, who has decided to break away from her going nowhere existence and forge ahead at the life she’s always wanted. Io's plans go drastically awry, however, when she becomes the prey of Zeus and nemesis of his wife, Hera. With no recourse, Io is swiftly enveloped in the couple’s tragic cycle of lust, secrecy, and revenge. This first play by senior Emily Terrell examines the classic Greek theme of fate versus free will within an imaginative modern context.\n\nLady Windermere's Fan\n\nBy Oscar Wilde\n\nDirected by M. Susan Anthony\n\nAs the play opens, the young and happily married Lady Windermere, a “good woman,” receives two items for her birthday: a lovely antique fan and the startling news that her husband may be having an affair with an older woman, the beautiful and famously promiscuous Mrs. Erlynne. But is the hold Mrs. Erylnne has on Lord Windermere of the adulterous kind? And why is she so interested in Lady Windermere? At the play’s crisis, Lady Windermere has risked her reputation and her happy life to obtain revenge upon her husband, only to be saved by none other than Mrs. Erylnne, the true exemplar of a “good woman.” First produced in 1892, Lady Windermere’s Fan, like many of Wilde's comedies, is a stinging satire on the morals of Victorian society, particularly the institution of marriage.\n\nTARTUFFE\n\nby Moliere\n\nDirected by M. Susan Anthony\n\nIt is 1668, and Monsieur Orgon, a wealthy Parisian, has fallen under the spell of Tartuffe, a swindler who masquerades as a holy man. Although the other members of Orgon’s household see Tartuffe for what he really is, Orgon dismisses their concerns and recklessly lavishes on his “holy” friend money, possessions--even his daughter in marriage. Meanwhile, Tartuffe lies, cheats, steals and does his best to seduce Orgon’s wife. By the time Orgon finally recognizes his folly, it could be too late to save his fortune and his family! Moliere’s comic masterpiece so brilliantly skewers religious hypocrites that the play, when first introduced to Paris audiences, was banned for five years. Described as a “delightful romp,” Tartuffe is acknowledged as one of the greatest comedies of Western literature.\n\nEURYDICE\n\nby Sarah Ruhl\n\nDirected by Gigi Jennewein Fenlon\n\nOn the day Eurydice marries her true love Orpheus, a tragic misstep sends her plummeting to the surreal depths of the Underworld. Memories are forbidden in this world of the dead, but an unexpected reunion with her father vividly awakens Eurydice’s mind to the love she felt in life. When in his search for her, Orpheus uses his music to penetrate the gates of the Underworld, Eurydice must painfully decide whether to remain with her father or return with her earthly love. A modern tale of love and loss, Eurydice is playwright Ruhl’s imaginative interpretation of the classic Orpheus myth told from the heroine’s point of view, abounding with surprising plot twists and quirky humor.\n\nBECAUSE THE UNIVERSE TENDS TOWARD ENTROPY\n\nA collection of one-act plays by Chekhov, Strindberg, Picasso and Goodman\n\nDirected by Tim Good\n\nThe horrifying things that we do to one another, and the lengths to which we go to try to repair them, take center stage in this assemblage of one-act plays from Modernist masters. Chekhov's riotous farce, The Marriage Proposal, is followed by Strindberg's exploration of infidelity in The Stronger. Pablo Picasso's only play, Desire Trapped by the Tail, offers a funny, abstract take on personal relationships. The stories conclude with Dust of the Road by Kenneth Sawyer Goodman, where we encounter Judas eternally wandering the earth, trying desperately to undo the damage he has done.\n\nPOLVADERA\n\nWritten by Steve Timm\n\nDirected by Ron Dye\n\nDuring the Great Depression a young woman’s hope to escape the rural Midwest for the big city is compromised when she makes a gruesome discovery in a neighbor’s field. Haunted by the discovery and by her ability to witch water, she instead seeks refuge in the canyon country of southeastern Utah. But both her past and water are relentless in pursuing her. Thirty‑five years later she’s forced to return to the same field where she makes yet another terrible discovery. In this new play, Professor Timm shrewdly explores the impact of polvadera, or ‘the dust we leave behind.”\n\nEINSTEIN AND THE ROOSEVELTS\n\nMusic by Nancy Ford\n\nBook and lyrics by Gretchen Cryer\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nWritten by the Broadway award-winning team and DePauw alumni Nancy Ford ('57) and Gretchen Cryer ('57), Einstein and the Roosevelts is the premiere of an inventive musical presenting some lesser-known history of one of America’s most influential couples. The story takes place at an after-life birthday party thrown for Eleanor in the cosmos to which Albert Einstein has been invited to provide entertainment with a violin that summons up moments from the past. The production's imaginative revelation of buried secrets and passions promises to both entertain and educate by combining history and whimsy to illuminate the characters' past choices surrounding love, marriage, and politics during wartime.\n\nNATURAL SELECTION\n\nWritten by Eric Coble\n\nDirected by M. Susan Anthony\n\nIt’s the very near future and humans are coping with Earth’s devastation. People risk radiation poisoning when they step outdoors. Children attend virtual school. Friends interact via internet. Some populations, such as Native Americans, have been nearly eradicated, so representatives are displayed in “Cultural Pavilions.” In seeking a genuine Indian, curator Henry Carson encounters a most charismatic and unsettling Navajo, who soon teaches everyone a few things about tolerance and borders. A dark comedy that examines our blind dependence on technology, our isolation from each other, and our detachment from our own spirituality, Natural Selection, which premiered at Actors Theatre of Louisville in 2007, is being presented in conjunction with DePauw's ArtsFest 2008: Art & Borders.\n\nTWELFTH NIGHT\n\nWritten by William Shakespeare\n\nDirected by Amy Hayes\n\n“If music be the food of love, play on….” So begins one of Shakespeare’s greatest comedies. Part love story, part high jinks, part philosopher’s musings, and part intrigue, Twelfth Night examines gender, practical joking, and the nature of true love, making us wonder if clothes really do make the man. Collaboratively created with live music, imaginative costumes, and fast-paced hilarity, this show is a joyful romp with a romantic and moving climax.\n\nThe Who's TOMMY\n\nMusic and lyrics by Pete Townshend and Des McAnuff\n\nDirected by Steve Timm\n\nThe Who's Tommy is a musical based on the rock opera Tommy, written and recorded by the 1960's band The Who. The story follows the rise of the title character, Tommy, from a traumatizing childhood event that leaves him psychosomatically deaf, dumb and blind through an abusive adolescence to stardom as a world champion pinball player. This mythic tale of a young boy's journey from pain to triumph includes such classic rock singles as \"See Me, Feel Me\" and \"Pinball Wizard\" and promises to be one of the most electrifying evenings of rock and roll ever to play in the theatre.\n\nMEDIEVAL TALES\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nThe production is a collection of short works from the late Medieval/early Renaissance when theatre as we know it was beginning to reemerge in the Western world. With the late 15th century morality play Everyman as its centerpiece, this assortment of tales explores the medieval worldview on religion and domestic life, and captures the humor, daily concerns and lifetime dreams of a continent and culture on the cusp of a multifaceted explosion.\n\nSTEVE HERE\n\nWritten and directed by Steve Timm\n\nBased on encounters during months of backpacking and kayaking in wilderness areas across the country, this new work tells the stories of people immersed in the wild. Common to all is the search for meaning in the struggle between life and death in the wilderness, and the challenge to find peace of mind in an environment that is both beautiful and violent. Produced in conjunction with ArtsFest 2007, the play includes excerpts from Of Wolves, Moose and Daughters, written as part of a residency at Isle Royale National Park.\n\nCHILDREN OF EDEN\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Stephen Schwartz\n\nDirected by Tim Good\n\nFrom the composer of Wicked and Godspell comes the telling of epic stories from Genesis told through music. In Children of Eden, Stephen Schwartz brings us the relationship of God with Eve and Adam, and the trials facing Noah's family in The Flood, in songs such as \"Lost in the Wilderness\", \"In Whatever Time We Have,\" and \"Spark of Creation.\" These tales of struggle and hope remind us that we are all still \"children of Eden.\"\n\nOUR TOWN\n\nWritten by Thornton Wilder\n\nDirected by Gigi Jennewein Fenlon\n\nIn this age of cell phones, Internet and reality shows, Thornton Wilder's 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning American classic reminds us to slow down, open our hearts and minds, and embrace the significance of our day-to-day experiences. Our Town is one of the most produced dramatic works of the 20th century, possibly because it so succinctly captures - with warmth and humor - the eternal truths of human existence.\n\nQUILTERS\n\nWritten by Molly Newman and Barbara Damashek\n\nMusic and lyrics by Barbara Damashek\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nQuilters is a musical journey through the joys, struggles, amusements, and sorrows faced by the women who helped settle the American frontier. This intricately woven collage combines the art and craft of quilting with dance, music, and drama to tell richly-textured stories attesting to the great courage and spirit of our female ancestry. As America is largely a nation of settlers and immigrants, Quilters has the power to touch a chord in all of us.\n\nTHE ORPHAN OF CHAO\n\nAdapted from the folk tale by Wang Yan\n\nNew English translation by Sherry Mou\n\nDirected by Tim Good and Sherry Mou\n\nThe laws of heaven ultimately win in this ancient Chinese story of power and revenge. When the evil General Tu-An Ku has the entire Chao clan slaughtered, several give up their own lives to assist with the rescue of the lone survivor, the title character, in the hopes that he will grow up to avenge Tu-An Ku's ruthless political persecution and clan cleansing. Produced in conjunction with ArtsFest 2006: Art and The Silk Road, the production is highlighted by performances in the traditional Peking Opera style.\n\nINHERIT THE WIND\n\nWritten by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee\n\nDirected by Steve Timm\n\nBased on the famous \"monkey trial\" courtroom battle between lawyers Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan during the sultry summer of 1925 in Dayton, Tennessee, this American classic weaves the gripping story of the prosecution of high school teacher John T. Scopes for his teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution against state law. Inherit the Wind has riveted stage and film audiences for over 50 years with its compelling depiction of the ongoing debate of creationism vs. evolution.\n\nTHE REAL INSPECTOR HOUND\n\nWritten by Tom Stoppard\n\nDirected by Susan Anthony\n\nThe perfect season ender, The Real Inspector Hound is a smart and snappy lampoon of self-important theatre critics and the predictable English weekend country-house murder mystery. While reviewing the production, critics Moon and Birdboot trade pompous critiques and mourn their disappointing careers. Soon, however, the two are swept up into the action and onto the stage, with startling (and hilarious) results. Stoppard’s searing commentary and outrageous characters make for an engaging comedic romp.\n\nSWEENEY TODD\n\nMusic and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim\n\nWritten by Hugh Wheeler\n\nDirected by Susan Anthony\n\nStep into the 19th century barbershop of Sweeney Todd, where the floor is littered with more than hair clippings as Todd’s irrepressible thirst for revenge against a crooked judge has expanded to include his unfortunate customers. Add to this the resourceful proprietress of the pie shop downstairs who soon has the people of London lining up in droves to savor her mysterious new meat pies, and you’ll discover a multiple award-winning musical thriller! At the play’s premiere in 1979, The New York Times opined, “There is more artistic energy, creative personality and plain excitement than in a dozen average musicals.\"\n\nAS YOU LIKE IT\n\nby William Shakespeare\n\nDirected by Andrew Hayes\n\nOne of Shakespeare’s greatest comedies - where anything can and does happen - is reset in America of the 1950s. His juxtaposition of town and country relations is as fresh today as it was over 400 years ago. With power-plays, banished children, dueling brothers and misguided country-bumpkins we see truly that “all the world’s a stage.”\n\nVENUS\n\nby Suzan-Lori Parks\n\nDirected by Gigi Jennewein Fenlon\n\nYou’ve never seen anything like her. She’s an exotic African beauty: her dark skin, her gorgeous eyes, her full bosom. And she’s a big-bottomed girl! A novelty. She’d make a splendid freak! The Hottentot Venus! Pulitzer Prize-winning author Parks has crafted Venus from the true story of Saartjie Baartmann, who was deceptively lured from her South African home to a life of exploitation and disappointment in early 19th-century London.\n\nIN THE SILENCE YOU DON’T KNOW\n\nby Samuel Beckett\n\nDirected by Tim Good\n\nSix short plays. 4 with no words. 1 with no actors. 1 with just heads sticking out of urns. Sample the existential world of the Nobel Prize-winning author of Waiting for Godot, Irish playwright Samuel Beckett. When it’s quiet, with the silence screaming in your ears, you see the bleakness, the pointless vacuum of nothingness before you, and you go on anyway…"
