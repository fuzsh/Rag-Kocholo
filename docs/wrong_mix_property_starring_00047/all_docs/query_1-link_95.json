        "text": "Mad Max Minute - Happy Feet (2006)\n\nMore than 20 years after directing Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, George Miller returns to the director’s chair again for the animated children’s movie: Happy Feet. Elijah Wood is Mumble, an emperor penguin born with the curse of a terrible singing voice, something unheard of in a colony that relies on singing songs in order to find a mate. Despite his vocal shortcomings Mumble has the secret power of dance and uses it to strut, shuffle, and kick-ball-change his way into the hearts and minds of his fellow penguins. Surprisingly, there is a lot more to this movie than that: fish shortages, penguin religion, fearsome seals and whales, and of course the mystery of alien abduction.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Whether you know this movie by its original title or the American recut: ‘The Blood of Heroes’, it’s a story of a young woman’s dream of claiming glory, and an old man’s quest to reclaim his honor. Along the way we meet colorful characters, strange, yet familiar, locations, and learn that, at the end of the day, mastery is its own reward. A huge \"Thank You\" to Joe Devitt-Rix for helping us find a copy of the international version.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Ziemba called, “a decent rip-off that moves slow and never crosses the line.” When young Alison Findlay and her friends decide to play with an Ouija board their fun in interrupted by an ominous spirit warning our heroine to stay away from “them” on her nineteenth birthday. Flash forward a few years and despite the otherworldly warning, Alison is heading home to spend her nineteenth birthday with her Aunt and Uncle. Before she’s aware of what is going on, Alison is trapped in the clutches of a demon-worshipping cult and it’s up to her boyfriend, Peter, to rescue her before it’s too late.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Okay, so it may not be the same story, but the elements are there: Motorcycles, high-speed chases, awkward ear-piercing, and a cast so full of actors that will later appear in Mad Max that it’ll make your head spin. Before you listen, please be aware that the version of the movie we saw on YouTube had an abnormally long run time, so there are some ultimately inaccurate statements about how long this movie actually takes to watch.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

As William Wallace, Gibson leads a colorful cast of Scotsman on a bloody campaign to oppose King Edward “Longshanks” of England, in the First War of Scottish Independence. A long movie warrants a long podcast, so buckle in with us as we praise Gibson’s improved acting ability, rage against prima nocta, and end up talking more about court intrigue than battle. Did we like Braveheart? Should you spend 3-hours on a Scottish war epic directed by an American raised in Australia? Listen and find out.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Anyone worried about spoilers should watch the movie before listening to us talk about the movie because we go through everything that happens. There’s a blind radio DJ, inept police officers, a naked woman on a motorcycle, and even some faith healers on the long road from Colorado to California. We also talk about what we liked, what we didn’t, and whether we would recommend this film.

The discussion questions focus on our villains: 1) How was Toecutter as an antagonist for Max? Could he be considered a rival? 2) Does Johnny the Boy have a character arc? Could he also be considered a main character in this movie? Last of all, we outline how we’ll handle hiatus material and give our final thoughts on Mad Max.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Special note is given to the TV newsreader, most of the directing staff, and some of the special effects people. Discussion questions for this episode: 1) Was Jessie a fully realized character? Should she have been featured more or less? 2) What role did Jim Goose play in Max’s story? How does he compare to Jessie as a companion to Max?\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

With his vengeance complete Max drives along an empty road and the movie fades to black. We talk about Max leaving Johnny the Boy behind, Max having nothing left to live for, and the excellent choice of music for the end credits. We also discuss the following question: 1) Who is Max? What kind of person was he at the beginning of the movie? At the end?\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

With that, Max turns and walks away, leaving a crazed and desperate Johnny to his fate. There’s a lot of consideration for the pros and cons of Max’s contraption design, and the conversation turns to what we would do if we found ourselves in Johnny’s situation.

Deaf to Johnny’s shouting and pleading, Max takes the lighter from Johnny’s neck and begins putting together a contraption using the bits and pieces scattered around the wreckage.

Meanwhile, Johnny the Boy is hard at work trying to get himself a new pair of boots until Max arrives with a shotgun to Johnny’s head. Johnny tries to talk his way out of the situation, but Max is unwavering and commands Johnny to attach a handcuff to his own ankle. No animals were harmed in the making of this episode.

As Max drives into the prohibited zone once again the sun goes down and though his eyes are heavy, Max refuses to succumb to sleep and the next morning finds something that may lead him to the man he’s after. Along the way we wonder how much time has really passed, call attention to a deleted scene, and propose an alternate storyline wherein Max would find redemption.

The two engage in a high-speed game of cat and mouse before an unexpected third party appears and catches Toecutter off guard, resulting in arguably the most iconic crash in the movie.

It’s a brutal minute that sees Max falling down, picking himself back up again, and finally getting back in the driver’s seat before speeding off to catch Toecutter. We talk about tight pants, the tricky task of identifying Australian birds of prey, and do a bit of math concerning speed and distance. Also, The Mad Max Minute does not advocate vigilante justice.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Seeing the tables start to turn Toecutter retreats leaving Max to his long painful walk back to the parked Black on black. We bid farewell to the best second-in-command Toecutter could ask for, even as we blur the line of who exactly we’re rooting for to win, and talk about Toecutter running away instead of staying to fight.

Stopping to investigate, Max is on his guard but notices far too late that he has been caught in Toecutter’s trap. Bubba Zanetti adds injury to insult by running over Max’s outstretched arm as he grasps for his shotgun. We hear the return of the Code 3, talk about exploding knees, and explore the ways that Max is and isn’t like a Jedi.

It’s an exercise in futility as Max tries to get around the massive, slow-moving obstruction, but eventually, the road widens out and Max is able to resume his chase. Rick has some rather strong feelings about this minute, mostly stemming from his own feelings about being stuck in slow traffic, whereas Julia is much more understanding.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.

Elsewhere, Johnny finds a highway call box and alerts Toecutter of the Bronze that is now hunting them. Before long Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti are back on the road, with a familiar face shadowing them. We address the infamous stuntman rumor, talk about some rather illegal traffic wrangling, and spend a fair amount of time wondering how Max was able to plant photographs in Toecutter’s helmet.\n\nWe have a listener's discussion page on Facebook.
