        "text": ">\n\nRather, it’s pre-apocalyptic. But the handwriting is certainly on the wall…and on the open roads.\n\nThis celebrated cult film might more accurately be described as dystopian in conception because the filmmakers imagine a world, “a few years from now,” in which widespread lawlessness has taken hold, and the authorities — increasingly more fascist in tone, powers, and demeanor — are helpless to prevent a culture-wide death spiral into anarchy and chaos.\n\nAt one point in the film, our hero — police officer and family man Max (Mel Gibson) — admits that he’s “scared,” and the audience wholly shares that trepidation. Max’s vicious world is one without a safety net, in which the laws of the jungle dominate. Miller enthusiastically takes the film beyond the bounds of movie decorum and good taste right from the start — from the opening sequence — and leaves viewers wondering just how far he will tread into taboo territory.\n\nThe result is a film that has lost none of its dreadful, visceral power in over three decades.\n\nNightrider believes himself a “fuel-injected suicide machine,” and survives all attempts at pursuit and restraint. At least that is, until Max (Gibson) — the best — joins the chase.\n\nFinally, Nightrider is killed in a high-speed wreck. Unfortunately, his “friends,” led by the gang leader Toecutter, desire vengeance. One of Toecutter’s minions, Johnny, is apprehended by Max’s friend, Officer Goose (Steve Bisley), but then released by effete, officious lawyers. Next, it is Goose who becomes a target for Toecutter’s mad revenge.\n\nAfter Goose is burned and maimed on the road by Toecutter, Max resigns from the force. With his wife Jesse (Joanne Samuel) and young son in tow, he heads out on a vacation from his responsibilities. Unfortunately, Max’s family almost immediately crosses paths with Johnny, Toecutter and the others, and pays the ultimate price. Max’s wife and son are run down on the open road, and left dying.\n\nEnraged, and with no legal recourse, Max takes command of a souped-up police interceptor, and engages his enemies on the open highway, outside the bounds and restrictions of the law.\n\nAs is the case with all works of art, this film arises from a very specific context.\n\nAccordingly, Max progressively loses his faith that society’s decaying infrastructure (as represented by the ramshackle local police center or “halls of justice“) can stop the world from spiraling towards destruction.\n\nThe price is the very eventuality that Max so dramatically fears all along. He knows, even starting out, that there is very little difference between the cops and the “terminal psychotics” who vie for control of the roadways. When Max’s family and friends die, that line is blurred entirely. Max realizes, contra Fifi, that there can no longer be any heroes. Heroes only work in context of a functioning civilization and support system.\n\nSo yes, Max gets his bloody vengeance in this film, but his ultimate fear is realized too. In breaking the laws of civilization, the only difference between him and the Toecutter’s minions remains that he possesses a bronze badge. What would his wife and son think of him now?\n\nNow, a threshold is widely defined as the point at which a physiological or psychological effect begins to be produced, and that seems to be precisely what Toecutter is fostering in both his friends and his enemies. He is sponsoring and encouraging madness, psychosis and violence. Indeed, there seems to be a plague of madness and nihilism sweeping the world in this film, and Toecutter fosters it in his cohorts (such as Nightrider) and his protege (Johnny)."
