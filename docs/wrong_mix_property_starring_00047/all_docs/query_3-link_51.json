        "text": "The release of Mad Max: Fury Road trailers have routinely imploded the internet, each new vision of director George Miller’s re-jigged hell-for-leather franchise leaving fanboys salivating and work productivity levels in states of smouldering ruin.\n\nSet in a future dystopian universe partial to leather-heavy wardrobes and spontaneous explosions, Mad Max has always blown some fresh air on large-scale action movies by dirtying up their traditionally glossy aesthetic.\n\nHollywood in particular has a long history of producing clean-looking world-gone-wrong movies; even dark classics like The Omega Man and Soylent Green beam with shiny colours and glossy production values. The grubby but beautiful design and infectious on-the-ground carnage present in Fury Road footage has been around from day one, since the cantankerous titular character first hooned down Anarchie Roach in 1979.\n\nThe original movie wasn’t just a gasoline-dowsed action pic that rocketed the careers of Miller and star Mel Gibson. For several decades it was also an unprecedented success: squeezed from a budget of around $350,000, some of the crew literally paid in slabs of beer, Mad Max gobbled up around $100m at the international box office.\n\nIt took faux-DIY scary movie The Blair Witch Project to take away its mantle as the most profitable feature film in history (and that was intentionally crafted to look cheap while Miller and his crew worked slavishly hard for their sensational look and feel). The second instalment, 1981’s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, was in technical and aesthetic terms a superior beast to its predecessor – but it also cost 10 times the original’s budget and benefited from storytelling groundwork laid down by it.\n\nJust as the sombre ending of the sixth James Bond film, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, established 007’s emotionally recalcitrant attitude towards women, the first Mad Max movie makes a similar case for why its iconic boot-clad bad-arse got so cranky in the first place.\n\nAway from the explosions and torn up bitumen is a tender romance between Max (Gibson) and his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel). Surprisingly tender, perhaps, given the extent to which the franchise has become synonymous with hardboiled action.\n\nHardboiled is certainly how it begins, with one of many chaotic chase scenes that fly across the screen with bat-out-of-hell momentum. The story takes place in a future world where an energy crisis has led to the disintegration of society and proliferation of freaky-looking motorcycle gangs that terrorise and pillage outback communities.\n\nMembers of the Main Force Patrol attempt to uphold whatever crumbs of law and order remain. A screaming psycho named Nightrider (Vincent Gil) has escaped police custody and is throttling down the highway, providing his very own colourful commentary: his vehicle is a “fuel-injected suicide machine” and it’s “cruising at the speed of fright”.\n\nNightrider successfully evades the force until Max takes on the job of pursuing him and the joyride ends in a fiery crash. Max’s involvement in fighting the Acolytes, the gang to which Nightrider belongs, has elements of American cop and superhero movies. Colleague Fifi (Roger Ward, infamous for portraying a hulking villain in 1982 Ozploitation classic Turkey Shoot) implores Max not to quit the force.\n\n“They say people don’t believe in heroes any more,” he says. “You and me Max, we’re gonna give them back their heroes.”\n\nIn a Hollywood movie, a scene like that would be delivered straight. Here Max laughs it off and says he doesn’t buy that crap (Fifi replies: “You gotta admit, I sounded good there for a minute”). The over-arching spirit of the film is anarchic, if not downright nihilistic: just as the world Miller depicts has become increasingly ravaged, the core of Mad Max itself feels like it’s been perverted past the point of return. A grisly anti-Hollywood ending sees Max’s wife and son pay a horrible price, cementing the protagonist’s lone wolf philosophy and unrelenting crabbiness.\n\nThrough the haze of nostalgia, it’s easy to forget how plain weird the film is; how many moments challenge any kind of logic definition. The scene in which gang members string up and dry-hump a mannequin, told by their leader that the lifeless statuette is “not what she seems” and “full of treachery”, feels like just one of many remnants from an awful dream.\n\nMad Max has always radiated an otherworldly vibe, a slightly sickly sensation that something at its core is fundamentally wrong. James Wan and Leigh Whannel, co-writers of 2004’s grisly horror flick Saw, have acknowledged their film couldn’t have existed without it. If you need to ask why, you’ve either never seen the finale to the original Mad Max or it’s become lost in a blurry memory of spinning wheels and BDSM outfits.\n\nFreed from the shackles of conventional action move storytelling – goodies defeating baddies and all the tropes we’ve come to expect – brings a weird kind of liberation: we are there ultimately for the thrill and rush of the ride. On this front, Miller and his crew have never let us down."
