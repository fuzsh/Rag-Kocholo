        "text": "I also have another thought: Milchan (and his Regency company) could strike a new deal with The Walt Disney Company, but not only would he produce films released under the 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures labels, but also under the Walt Disney Pictures label, allowing Regency to do some more family-oriented films, whether they would be an original film, an adaptation, or a live-action remake of an animated Disney classic. Perhaps Regency could also help produce a Marvel Studios feature, maybe a Daredevil reboot that's set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nI also have another thought: Milchan (and his Regency company) could strike a new deal with The Walt Disney Company, but not only would he produce films released under the 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures labels, but also under the Walt Disney Pictures label, allowing Regency to do some more family-oriented films, whether they would be an original film, an adaptation, or a live-action remake of an animated Disney classic.
