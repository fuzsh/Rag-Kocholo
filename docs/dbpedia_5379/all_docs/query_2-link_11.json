        "text": "Arnon Milchan was born in Rehovot, British Mandate Palestine, present-day Israel; December 6, 1944. He is an Israeli film and television executive producer. Throughout his professional career he has received nominations for the Oscar Awards and the BAFTA Awards. He has produced films such as Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Pretty Woman (1990), Fire Against Fire (1995), Los Angeles Naked (1997) or Fight Club (1999), among others.\n\nMilchan collaborated in negotiations and purchases of weapons for the Israeli defense army for many years. He is said to have helped Israel build its nuclear arsenal.\n\nShimon Peres himself said about him: “Arnon is a special man. I was the one who recruited him… When I was in the Ministry of Defence, Arnon was involved in a large number of defense-related contracting activities and intelligence operations. His strong point is making connections at the highest levels… his activities gave us an immense advantage strategically, diplomatically and technologically.”\n\nIn November 2013, Milchan himself admitted in the Israeli documentary Uvda to having carried out arms trading deals for the Israeli government throughout the 1970s.\n\nHis father owned a fertilizer company. He earned a degree from the London School of Economics. In 1991 he created his own production company New Regency Productions, a subsidiary of New Regency Enterprises. He is in the ranking of the world's billionaires according to Forbes magazine in 2010.\n\nThroughout his professional career he has produced numerous films. Once Upon a Time in America (1984), starring Robert De Niro, was one of his first works. Later came the romantic comedy Pretty Woman (1990), for which he was nominated for the BAFTA for best film. Also in the 90s, his name appeared in the credits of films such as JFK (1991), whose cast was headed by Kevin Costner; the children's film Free Willy (1993); the film adaptations of John Grisham's novels The Client (1994) and A Time to Kill (1996); and the thriller Heat (1995). At the end of this decade he was nominated for the Oscar for best film and again for the BAFTA for the drama LA Confidential (1997). The latest titles produced in the 90s are, among others, the romantic drama starring Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage “ City of Angels” (1998), the action film “Entrapment” (1999), with Catherine Zeta-Jones; and Fight Club (1999), with Brad Pitt.\n\nThe 2000s began with the comedy “Big Momma's House” (2000) and the thrillers “Not a Word” (2001), with Michael Douglas, and “High Crimes” (2002). Later, the drama directed by Richard Gere and Diane Lane “Unfaithful” (2002) would arrive; and the film adaptations of the comic “Daredevil” (2003) and, again, John Grisham's novel “Runaway Jury” (2003), whose cast was led by Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman. In 2005 he worked as executive producer on the most successful film of his career to date “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” with $478 million raised globally. Among his latest projects of this decade are the drama “Stay” (2005) and the thriller “The Sentinel” (2006), in which Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria appeared.\n\nIn the 2010s he produced the comedies “What Happens in Vegas” (2008), “Marley & Me” (2008); the horror film directed by Alexandre Aja “Mirrors” (2008); the film starring Tom Cruise “Knight and Day” (2010) and the drama whose cast was led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, “Love and Other Drugs” (2010)."
