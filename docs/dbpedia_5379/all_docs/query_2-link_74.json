Azrikam Milchan Husband of Tehila Milchan\n\nFather of Naava Milchan; Amir Miltchan and Gil Milchan.\n\nThe story of Chaim Eliezer Milchan\n\nBorn on an estate near Goniondz, district of Bialystok, Poland, on the 3rd of Tevet Tr\"m (late 1879). His father Dov was \"Ben - Torah\", who was also known as \"a hero\" to the Jews. The local hooligans often \"felt his heavy hand\" when trying to run wild and attack the Jews. His mother was Matatia, daughter of Eliezer Jezrael.\n\nMatatia was known for her great sense of justice and charitably\n\nHis bible teachers in the \"Cheder\" , ignited his spirit and filled his heart with the desire to renew the glory of Israel in its land as in the \"judges\" and the \"kings\" and \"prophets\". At the age 12 he was sent to a Yeshiva in Lumza, where he was studying the Torah every night until 2, and was greatly affected by the \"Musar movement\", Especially The book \" Path of the Just \" by Ram\"chal. His teachers recognized his great promise in term of his sharp perception.\n\nBut he did not want to waste the years of his youth in exile, for the sake of a rabbinical career. In 1904 he immigrated to Israel with his sister Malka.\n\nWhen he reached the port of Jaffa he witnessed the harsh stiffness of the Turkish government against Jewish immigration. At 4 in the morning he parted from the ship into the boat, to be taken to the shore, but the Turks did not let him go on shore. The ship would not let him returned either. So the boat was next to the ship without food or water for 12 hours, to which eventulaly the captain took pity on him and gave him some water. At the end he was allowed to return to the ship. He traveled to Beirut and returned to Jaffa but again was not allowed to go to the shore. He continued on to Port Said (Egypt) and from there came again to Jaffa, but directly from the ship he was about to be returned to Odessa. This became known to the Jews in Jaffa, and with help fromf R. Ezekiel Danin (Suchowolski) who went to at the head of Jaffa Ali Khamis, he was taken of the ship and was brought on to land by the coast guards.\n\nAt first he lived in Jaffa and acquired knowledge of the Arabic language. He then went to work in the vineyards of Nes Ziona and lived in an orchard near Nahal Rubin. Malaria attached itself to him there and remained with him for many years. While working for one day he had to rest for two days because of the high fever. Alternating his days of work and idleness he would study the Torah and the wife Rabbi Chaim Moshe Prize was looking after him as a mother of mercy.\n\nLater he worked at the Rishon Lezion winery and lived in a hut built from eucalyptus. During the harvest the head of the winery - the well known Bloch, found him eating from a cart a cluster of grapes and ordered to fire him. Now all his days were filled with pains and fever. When Dr. A. A. Mazia checked it out he immediately tols him to travel abroad in order to save his life.\n\nFour years he was at home with his parents, year and a half of which he was with fever bouts regularly, as if there was still a resident of the Land of Israel. He continued to study Torah and to read the Hebrew Enlightenment literature. He made a Zionist propaganda among the youth of the surrounding towns and taught them songs of Zion. He was especially successful after the appearance of Herzl and the first World Zionist Congress, which occurred during that period. When the orthodox in the nearby town found out that the Zionist wanted to make their own minyan, their Rabbi forbade to lend them a Torah. The young Zionists, and Joshua Sofrsky amongst them, received the book of Torah paid by his father, R. Dov Milchan They a threw a parade - a victory parade. Haim Eliezer was also involved in the youth department and organized the reading\n\nof Hebrew literature and most of the books for their library were bought with his money, as the most affluent member.\n\nIn Tr\"s he returned to Israel. Worked for a while in Ness Ziona and then bought a plot of land in Rehovot. R' Aron Eisenberg, who knew him from his previous period of employment and suffering in the country, was a great help to him in advice and guidance and even the best man when he married Esther Michele, daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Shlanc from Jerusalem.\n\nHe continued being busy into an old age in agricultural work, almond groves, vineyards and citrus. He also devoted time to public needs. Elected to the board of the early colony and served as a volunteer for several years as the Board Secretary. Was for 18 years a member and secretary of the winegrowers local council member of the syndicate farmers, member and treasurer of the school, for many years a committee member farmer, member of the local magistrates, spindle assembly's founding (Provisional Committee) after the entry of the British army south of the country during - the first World war. During that war he served in maintaining - a night on call, like other residents. One night shots were fired at him and he miraculously survived. He was elected to the \"Yishuv committee\" and gave Dr. Chaim Weizmann, head of the commission's a report on the political situation in relation to the English and the Arabs.\n\nAPA citation\n\nTidhar, D.

I don't even go to my own premieres, but this is for a good cause, Israel's youth movement,\" Milchan said. \"I'm not personally involved in any way; it's almost like a surprise party.\"\n\nMilchan provided his own surprise for the occasion, when, after accepting the Legacy of Citizens Lifetime Achievement Award, he called tennis champ Serena Williams to the stage and shared the award with her.\n\nMilchan was born in Rehovot, near Tel Aviv, 63 years ago as an 11th-generation sabra on both sides of the family (not the Milchan side!).\n\n\"On one family side we go back to [the great medieval Bible commentator] Rashi, on the other side almost to King David,\" he said. When he met Yasser Arafat, the late PLO leader, Milchan told him, \"I'm more Palestinian than you are.\"\n\nDuring their meeting, Milchan also discovered another side of the old terrorist.\n\n\"Arafat told me that he had seen my movie, 'Pretty Woman,' at least 20 times,\" Milchan said. \"A bodyguard took me to Arafat's bedroom, and there was a cassette of the movie.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Milchan was a star center forward for Tel Aviv Maccabi and the national soccer team.\n\n\"I had the choice of becoming a professional soccer player or going to the university,\" he recalled. \"I made a mistake and went to school.\"\n\nHe has four children, ranging in age from 5 to 40 and five grandchildren \"as of yesterday.\"\n\nAt age 20, Milchan inherited a debt-laden fertilizer company from his father and turned it into one of Israel's largest agro-chemical concerns. Today, with worldwide business investments and profitable movies, he confirms Fortune magazine's estimate of his worth at $3.1 billion.\n\nMilchan served in the Israeli army during the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. After getting his feet wet in the Israeli and British movie industries, he was ready to take on Hollywood.\n\nNow the founder and head of New Regency Productions, Milchan is credited as the producer of approximately 120 feature films. Among his best known titles are \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" \"Brazil,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" \"JFK,\" \"Free Willy,\" \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\"\n\nAlthough he is involved in many facets of Israeli life, Milchan takes no part in the country's film industry or, for that matter, in making Hollywood movies on Jewish or Israeli themes.\n\n\"I have a high regard for Israeli movies, but you've got to specialize,\" he said. \"You can't make a 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' which opened in 3,000 American theaters, and then a Hebrew-language film with English subtitles that plays in a few art houses.\"\n\nMilchan doesn't do documentaries or films on Holocaust themes, he said, \"although if somebody brought me a great script, like 'Schindler's List,' I might make it. But I'd rather give money to someone else who can do a better job than I could.\"\n\nHe does give money to Israeli causes, such as $1 million to the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Tel Aviv, for which he also served as chairman.\n\nMilchan said he put up $100 million for a pet project to establish a doctorate-granting university in the Galilee, with a top faculty (\"I wished that teachers were the highest paid people in Israel\") to attract Jewish, Muslim and Christian students.\n\nThe project has been stalled for two years, which Milchan blames on \"government changes, academic opposition and bureaucracy,\" but if it doesn't take off, he plans to initiate a major hydraulic energy scheme instead.\n\nMilchan is not involved in the L.A. Jewish community \"because I only live here, in Malibu, three months each year,\" he said. The rest of the time he spends in Israel, where he has houses in Herzliyah and Bet Yanai, near Caesarea, or in his London residence.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Milchan's name frequently popped up as an \"arms merchant\" in a criminal case involving the illegal shipment to Israel of 800 krytrons, small electronic devices that can be used for triggering nuclear weapons. Milchan was never charged in the case, but he acknowledges that one of his companies served as a front in the transaction, \"with the full knowledge of the Israeli and American governments.\"\n\nMilchan follows Israeli politics closely and is fond of dropping the names of his high-level friends, particularly Shimon Peres (\"his first letter he wrote as president went to me\"), but also Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Likud Party leader Binyamin (\"Bibi\") Netanyahu.\n\nHe recalled that in 1965, he put up $3,000 to help David Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan and Peres form the short-lived Rafi Party.\n\nAs always, he said, he likes to operate behind the scenes and asserted that he helped then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon persuade Peres to join the new Kadima Party. Currently, Milchan said, \"I'm trying to make peace among the left, right and center.\"\n\nHe is more circumspect about playing any role in American politics. \"If I did, I wouldn't tell you, except in private, but I know the players,\" he said.\n\nToward the end of the interview, Milchan mentioned a just-published 25-page cover story on him in Cigar Aficionado magazine written by its publisher, Marvin R. Shanken. Milchan, who said he no longer smokes stogies, offered to hand-deliver the magazine to the interviewer's home, via his chauffeur. He emphasized that he had vetted the article before publication and that every word was true.\n\nMilchan closes out the Cigar interview with some introspective thoughts.\n\n\"I really, really believe that I have the skills, the courage, the conviction and the know-how to make a difference in the peace process in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I can get in a room, no different than I got into a room with Arafat,\" Milchan said. \"I can get in the room and work out a deal.... I can get with the Iranian guy. I think if I really want something, it is to work with the next administration in Israel and the United States, whoever is the president here, whoever is the prime minister in Israel, and get myself hired to be the go-between, between Arabs and Jews.\n\n\"I will deliver this one,\" he added. \"The point I'm making here, I'm the most qualified person I've ever met to make peace. It will be my best movie, and I can do it. That's my big dream.\"\n\nArnon Milchan (Hebrew: ????? ????'?‎; December 6, 1944) is one of the most prolific independent film producers in Hollywood history, having produced over 120 full-length motion pictures [2]. Mr. Milchan is also a former key Israeli intelligence operative from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.[3][4] Milchan produced many films such as The War of the Roses, Once Upon a Time in America, Pretty Woman, Natural Born Killers, Under Siege, The Devil's Advocate, The Fountain, Unfaithful, L.A. Confidential and many others. He is an Israeli citizen, and a resident of Israel.\n\nMilchan was born in Rehovot, British Mandate for Palestine, today's Israel, in 1944, to a father who owned a fertilizer company,[5] which Milchan turned into a successful chemical business.[6] He later diversified his holding company (Milchan Brothers) into plastic, animal health care products, fiber optics and pharmaceuticals. At the height, Milchan owned thirty businesses in seventeen different countries. He also earned a degree from the London School of Economics, before being recruited to LAKAM, a top secret Israeli intelligence organization responsible for obtaining technology and material for Israel's nuclear program, and other highly secretive programs.\n\nMilchan became involved in the American movie business in 1977, after an introduction to American producer Elliot Kastner. Most notable among Milchan's film collaborations was his early work with Martin Scorsese. He developed close friendships with Robert De Niro, director Roman Polanski, and directors Sergio Leone, Terry Gilliam and Oliver Stone. Milchan started his own production company in 1991 called New Regency Productions. Through his company, in partnership with Warner Brothers, and later with Rupert Murdoch at 20th Century Fox, and other business ventures, such as Puma, Milchan has attained a net worth estimated at about $3.8 billion as of 2012, and is listed as the 290th richest person in the world by Forbes.[7] This estimation is disputed by the authors Doron and Gelman in Confidential, and considered too low. Their dispute is based on the fact that Forbes only estimate his transparent assets (Regency Enterprises/ New Regency) and does not his non-transparent assets into consideration. Non-transparent assets are for example accounts held in dozens of banks around the world. Those accounts were fueled by commissions coming from selling weapons to Iran, South Africa and Taiwan. Money earned in those countries were for Milchan's own account. The money Milchan received by brokering weapons for the State of Israel were put into offshore accounts to serve special purposes for the State of Israel.\n\nArnon Milchan has produced many films such as Once Upon a Time in America (1984) (in which he also makes a cameo appearance as the chauffeur), Brazil (1985), Pretty Woman (1990), Under Siege (1992), Natural Born Killers (1994), Boys on the Side (1995), L.A. Confidential (1997), Unfaithful (2002), and Knight and Day (2010), among others.[8]\n\nSpeculation about Milchan's involvement in arms dealing and intelligence activities was sparked after \"the indictment in 1985 of Richard Kelly Smyth, an aerospace executive who had made illegal shipments of Krytrons (nuclear triggers) through one of Milchan's companies.\" This remained hearsay until biographers Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman confirmed in a book published July 2011, that Milchan was indeed involved in espionage and arms-dealing. The research in Confidential - The Life Of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon established that \"at least through the mid-1980s [Milchan] was a full-fledged operative for Israel’s top-secret intelligence agency, Lakam. His activities included \"buying components to build and maintain Israel’s nuclear arsenal\" and supervising \"government-backed accounts and front companies that financed the special needs of the entirety of Israel’s intelligence operations outside the country.\".[9] Interviewed regarding Milchan's intelligence activities, Israeli President Shimon Peres stated:\n\n\"Arnon is a special man. It was I who recruited him.... When I was at the Ministry of Defense, Arnon was involved in numerous defense-related procurement activities and intelligence operations. His strength is in making connections at the highest levels.... His activities gave us a huge advantage, strategically, diplomatically and technologically.\" (interview dated February 8, 2010, documented in Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman's \"Confidential: Secret Agent turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan\" p. xi)\n\nMilchan is also the owner of the WTA broadcasting rights and is married to former South African tennis professional Amanda Coetzer. He is also the owner of the Israeli network which transmits Israeli television programming to the United States and Canada. He is also a partner in Israel's all-news cable Channel 10.\n\nis one of the most prolific independent film producers in Hollywood history, having produced over 120 full-length motion pictures [2]. Mr. Milchan is also a former key Israeli intelligence operative from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s.[3][4] Milchan produced many films such as The War of the Roses, Once Upon a Time in America, Pretty Woman, Natural Born Killers, Under Siege, The Devil's Advocate, The Fountain, Unfaithful, L.A. Confidential and many others. He is an Israeli citizen, and a resident of Israel."
