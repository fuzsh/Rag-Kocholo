He also produced the play \"Ipi Tombi\" and the New York production of \"It's Nice to Be Civilized\" before segueing into a successful career in Hollywood film production. Milchan's hits include \"The War of the Roses\" (1989), \"Pretty Woman\" (1990), \"Under Siege\" (1992), \"Free Willy\" (1993), \"The Client\" (1994) and \"Heat\" (1995). In recent years, he has branched out into feature financing through his New Regency Productions, which has overseen such films as \"Carpool,\" \"Northstar,\" \"Bogus\" and \"A Time to Kill\" (all 1996). In early 1996, he made a bid to purchase Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer."
