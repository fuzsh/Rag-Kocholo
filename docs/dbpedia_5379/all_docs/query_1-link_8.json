        "text": "By JANET MASLIN\n\nn \"The Mirror Has Two Faces,\" Barbra Streisand plays a shy, unglamorous college professor whose finer qualities go unappreciated by the people in her life.\n\nAs an actress she's on familiar and solid ground with such a role, but Ms. Streisand has produced and directed this romantic comedy, too. Elaborately lighted, carefully coiffed and always the center of attention, she can play plain Jane with the broadest of winks, like Grandma being impersonated by the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nMs. Streisand keeps this disingenuousness light and amusing during the film's glossy first hour. Then she demolishes her audience's good will with hubris that goes through the roof. Beguiling as she can be in duckling roles, she becomes insufferable as this story's gloating swan.\n\nAnd this film, unlike her much more accomplished \"Prince of Tides,\" cannot fall back on a bigger, better story whenever the issue of the star's appearance and lovableness ceases to be Topic A.\n\nWe know that Rose Morgan (Ms. Streisand) is nice because she has a hearty appetite, frumps about in her pink bathrobe and hollers, \"Aw, ya stupid bum!\" while watching a Yankees game.\n\nBut she is overshadowed by her vain, decadent sister (Mimi Rogers) and vain, pushy mother (Lauren Bacall). Or at least that's what the screenplay says; the film's visual style does everything possible to contradict it. Rarely does Ms. Streisand appear in a two-shot without glowing twice as brightly as the person on the other side of the frame.\n\nThen Rose's sister arranges a meeting between Rose and Gregory Larkin, a brilliant mathematician played by Jeff Bridges, who has never before had to mention both Socrates and Descartes in the same movie.\n\nBridges, groomed to hunky perfection as the film's pet man, manages to make himself quite funny and charming in the deadpan role of a humorless professor. Greg is the Ralph Bellamy type. \"It's like you're having a math party and you only invited yourself,\" Rose tells him once the two of them hit it off.\n\nRose and Greg have great times in romantic settings, which the film captures invitingly. But something is wrong. Greg, having been clumsily seduced and abandoned by Elle MacPherson in a scene meant to establish him as heterosexual, has decided that physical contact with women is a bad idea.\n\nStill, he wants to marry Rose so they can share some form of platonic perfection that only Greg understands. It involves twin beds, nervous excuses and Greg's saying things like: \"Trees! They're so fascinating. They don't even have to touch to propagate.\"\n\nAs written by the enterprising Richard LaGravenese with an emphasis on lively wisecracks for Ms. Streisand, this material might even have worked if reality had been allowed to intrude. But Greg is left one-dimensional and unexplained, looking more than a little weird before the story is over.\n\nAnd Rose is made a monument to pretzel feminism. Beginning to feel insulted by a man who likes her for her mind, she twists her thinking and trumpets her independence by being made over as a Cosmo girl.\n\nMakeup goes on. Hair turns blond. Rose goes shopping. And the film, which earlier incorporated a portrait of President Clinton, now plugs Donna Karan. \"What? What?\" cries Rose, while teaching her English class in a low-cut black dress. \"Yes, I have breasts! They cannot, however, be the subject of one of your papers.\" Rose's students laugh admiringly. They often do.\n\n\"If physical appearance doesn't matter, then what's wrong with this appearance?\" Rose asks defiantly. Nothing, except the film never believed appearances didn't matter in the first place, and Rose's cosmetic triumph is so gratingly overdone.\n\nPierce Brosnan, as the secondary pet man who once jilted Rose, now sees the error of his ways. Bridges actually spits his coffee while doing a double-take. \"I don't care if you are pretty!\" he finally tells her. \"I love you!\"\n\nAnd Greg and Rose, who may at long last be deciding to have sex as the final credits roll, are seen doing a stiff, endless, faux-happy tango in the middle of the street. This scene is staged by the only director on the planet who wouldn't have yelled \"Cut!\"\n\nThe overkill of \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" is partly offset by Ms. Streisand's genuine diva appeal. The camera does love her, even with a gun to its head. And she's able to wring sympathy and humor from the first half of this role.\n\nThe film also has a big asset in Ms. Bacall, though she plays a mother so targeted for disapproval that she might as well be wearing a bull's-eye on her back. Ignoring all that, and delivering her lines with trademark tart panache, Ms. Bacall cuts an elegant and sardonic figure. Ms. Rogers, as Rose's crass sister, is also naughty fun.\n\n\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild profanity, brief bedroom scenes and no real sex.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe Mirror Has Two Faces.
