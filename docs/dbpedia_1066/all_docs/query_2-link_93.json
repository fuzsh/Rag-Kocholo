        "text": "As I waited in an airport for a delayed flight a few days ago I was watching a little boy about 4 years old. He had two, almost-empty bottles of water. First, he twisted off the cap of one, then the other. Then he carefully screwed the cap from one onto the other. Success!\n\nThen he unscrewed both again. Next he began to pour the remaining water from one to the other, first with the destination bottle upright and the pouring bottle at about a 45° angle. To my amazement, his hand was steady and little water spilled. Then he tried another combination. The destination bottle upright and the pouring bottled completely upside-down, with the two bottle mouths adjacent to one another. The water started to spill, and he quickly stopped. He then repeated the original plan; it worked. Then he tried to second plan again; it failed again. He then screwed the bottle tops back on.\n\nNext he tried to squash one bottle with the top on. It resisted. He took the cap off and squashed it, but it bounced back to original shape. He tried that on the second bottle with the cap partially screwed; it held squashed for awhile. He then screwed the top tight and it held permanently. He was so thrilled he showed his parents what he had done.\n\nResearch is sometimes defined as the creation of new knowledge. Over time, each of the disciplines has developed frameworks that define its research methods. When the frameworks are followed well, the discipline approves the new knowledge after rigorous peer review and critique.\n\nIn contrast, learning in the university classroom has often seen faculty deliver the pre-digested knowledge of a field. This is a very compact way of transmitting information, but strips the student from exciting step that created that knowledge. For many students it also makes it difficult to remember the information. It has been abstracted from the excitement of discovery.\n\nThe little boy in the airport was a scientist, forming alternative hypotheses, collecting observations, testing the alternative explanations, replicating measurements, making conclusions. He thereby experienced the pure joy of discovery. I suspect his learning was deep and permanent.\n\nOutside the university, adults learn in ways not possible as little as 10 years ago. When I need to learn about a new area quickly I turn to internet search engines first. I type in a short phrase and within a few iterations I’m exposed to essentially all human knowledge associated with that phrase.\n\nThe information I receive is generally overwhelming in its scope. It comes from all disciplines simultaneously. It includes both the simple and the complex. It is “noisy” in the sense that there is a lot that is only tangentially related to what I need; it is unfiltered.\n\nClearly this is the kind of experience that will dominate the life-long learning experience of Georgetown graduates in the future. It will be a world where data will be the cheapest commodity.\n\nSo, how do we best prepare them for that world?\n\nLooking over my own shoulder at those moments of internet search, I’m struck at how much they resemble the act of research. They begin with a question (a field of inquiry). We collect observations in that domain (data collection). We study the different observations to seek synthesis (data analysis). We often invent alternative conclusions (hypothesis generation). We seek more data to help us choose the correct conclusion. We draw inference about the truth. And then, like all good scientists, we make deductions for our own individual purpose.\n\nI suspect that it’s useful for a Georgetown undergraduate to go through these steps over and over again, in courses on the arts, humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Repeated exercises of question formulation, observation acquisition, analytic synthesis, hypothesis formulation, inference, and deduction provide a powerful conceptual framework. Research-based learning can provide tools used throughout a lifetime.\n\nThinking of the little boy in the airport, that kind of learning is great fun, too."
