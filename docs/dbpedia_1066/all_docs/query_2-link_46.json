        "text": "Authors might incorporate fantastical elements, absurdity, or metafictional aspects into their narratives. Robert Scholes, a noted literary critic, is known for popularizing the term, associating it particularly with postmodern literature. Let us look at the meaning, themes, purpose and examples of fabulation in literature to find out more.\n\nFabulation meaning\n\nThe meaning of fabulation is that it is a form of postmodern fiction that developed in the 20th century that experimented with the traditional conventions of realism by blending fantasy, magic, myth supernatural elements in the narrative.\n\nIn a broad sense, fabulation refers to the creation or composition of stories. However, in a literary context, it's often used to describe narratives that break away from the boundaries of realism and incorporate elements of myth, fantasy, and allegory. It embraces the fantastical and the absurd, blurring the line between reality and fiction.\n\nFabulation: A mode of contemporary fiction that blends realism and fantasy.\n\nThe term fabulation was first coined by the American literary critic Robert Scholes, in his work The Fabulators (1967), to describe 20th-century novels that contained elements similar to magical realism.\n\nHe further elaborated on this literary mode through his subsequent essays: Structural Fabulation: An Essay on Fiction of the Future (1975) and Fabulation and Metafiction (1979).\n\nFabulation main ideas\n\nThe main ideas of Fabulation are derived from the genres of metafiction, postmodern fiction and especially magical realism. However, what sets fabulism apart is that it blends fantastical elements from well-known myths, fairy tales, and folktales, and retells these stories in a more realistic setting.\n\nHere is a table of all the genres that often overlap with fabulation:\n\nFabulation and relationship to other genres\n\nFabulation themes\n\nFabulation has many main themes, many of which coincide with the genres of magical realism. However, here are a few main ideas that set fabulation apart from other similar postmodern fictional genres.\n\nFantasy\n\nA key idea of fabulist works is that they make use of fantastical and magical elements. However, unlike magical realism, which uses general magical elements, fabulist works recreate the fantastical concepts popularised in famous fairy tales, myths and fables. Usually, it blends these stories in a more realistic setting, to create a more modern retelling of traditional fairytales.\n\nSince the reader is expected to know about the fantastical concepts as they are inspired by famous fairytales and myths, fabulist works rarely explain the magical elements in their stories. Instead, they are normalised as a part of the story's reality and are almost presented as unremarkable and mundane.\n\nC.S Lewis' novel Till We Have Faces (1956) is a fabulist retelling of the ancient Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nAllegory\n\nMuch like fairytales, myths and fables, works of fabulation serve a didactic purpose. Fabulation uses age-old myths to impart moral lessons through the use of allegories and symbolism.\n\nAllegory: A literary device where a character, place or event or anything that has a physical form personifies a larger idea or moral.\n\nSymbolism: A literary device where when an object, occurrence, or action represents an idea or meaning beyond itself.\n\nIrrealism\n\nFabulist works are inspired by the literary philosophy of irrealism.\n\nIrrealism is a literary philosophy that believes that the universe has infinite worlds and possibilities, and it is fiction's duty to represent these diverse versions. This means that the world of fiction should not have to necessarily coincide with the accepted version of social reality, and can tap into versions of the universe far beyond human consciousness. This can be done so in a way that is 'normalised' and unexplained by laws of physics, science and technology that bind our current reality.\n\nIn an irreal story, however, not only is the physics underlying the story impossible, as it is in these other genres, but it is also fundamentally and essentially unpredictable (in that it is not based on any traditional or scientific conception of physics) and unexplained.1\n\nIn the novel, Beloved (1987) by Toni Morrison, strange and supernatural occurrences in the story are treated as unsurprising to the characters in the story, as though it is a part of their everyday lives. The author makes no effort to explain the existence of these supernatural elements as they are taken to be 'normal' parts of the story's version of reality.\n\nIn this paragraph, the protagonist of the novel deals with a ghost as though one would deal with a normal person- by having a conversation.\n\nSethe and Denver decided to end the persecution by calling forth the ghost that tried them so. Perhaps a conversation, they thought...\"\n\n(Chapter 1)\n\nExperimentation\n\nFabulist works often experiment with chronology, plot structure, form, and narrative style. This gives fabulist novels an unpredictable and tense nature. They often surprise the reader with offbeat climaxes, resolutions and cliffhangers.\n\nFabulist works also experiment with narrative style by often adopting metafictional narrative techniques that often blur the lines between fiction and reality. This could involve:\n\nCharacters that are aware of their fictional nature\n\nBreaking the fourth wall by allowing the narrator and characters in the story to directly address the readers\n\nInterjecting commentary by the writer or narrator on the events of the story.\n\nRemember that metafictional novel are novels that are self-aware of their fictionality and re-emphasise this quality through their structure, narrative voice and characters.\n\nPurpose of fabulation\n\nWhile magical realism often focuses on political and social commentary, fabulist works focus on the entirety of the human experience and impart larger life philosophies to the reader.\n\nAs mentioned before, works of fabulation are inspired by well-known traditional fairytales, myths and fables, and therefore, impart the same moral lessons to their readers, but in a way that is entertaining, experimental and understandable. They do so by making complex moral and psychological concepts more allegorical and symbolic so that they are easier to grasp.\n\nBy blending reality and fantasy, fabulist works also draw the reader's attention to make social realities more stark and obvious. Since fabulist works subvert reality, they draw our attention to the reader's actual reality and influence them to question what they believed was known, familiar and 'normal'.\n\nFabulation literature examples\n\nHere are a few examples of literature that falls under the fabulation narrative style:\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five (1969) by Kurt Vonnegut - This novel incorporates elements of science fiction and time travel into a story about the horrors of war, embodying the fabulist approach.\n\nOne Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) by Gabriel Garcia Marquez - This work, a prime example of magical realism, presents a fantastical narrative that merges the ordinary and the extraordinary.\n\nThe Life of Pi (2001) by Yann Martel - This novel uses fabulation to tell a story that blurs the lines between reality and imagination, exploring themes of faith and survival.\n\nGiles Goat-Boy (1966) by John Barth\n\nGiles Goat-Boy (1966) is a postmodern fabulist novel about a human boy raised as a goat, who becomes the Grand Tutor (a Messiah) of the universe. In the novel, the universe is allegorised as a university, whereas great religious leaders are represented as Grand Tutors.\n\nThe novel has many recognizable religious and Cold War (1947-1991) allegories. For instance:\n\nSome of the characters playing 'Grad Tutors' closely resemble famous religious leaders, Greek philosophers, poets and heroes, either by their name or characteristics.\n\nSatan has been renamed the Dean o' Flunks and resides in the Nether Campus (which represents hell).\n\nPredictably, the Last Judgment is referred to as the Final Examination.\n\nOther figures reincarnated as tutors include Jesus Christ, Buddha, Moses, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Odysseus.\n\nEven though the lines between fiction and non-fiction have been blurred within this novel, readers are still able to identify prominent characters and the allegories they represent.\n\nThe novel also contains metafictional qualities, as it begins with the text being 'discovered' by the author. Therefore, throughout the novel, the author often provides humorous and insightful commentary on the events taking place within the novel.\n\nAmerican Gods (2001) by Neil Gaiman\n\nAmerican Gods can be considered a fabulist novel as it blends modern and ancient mythology into fiction. In this novel, the protagonist Shadow Moon is caught in a war between the Old American Gods and New American Gods. The Old American Gods are merely modern-day recreations of famous gods from Greek, Egyptian, Welsh, Norse and Hindu mythology. For instance:\n\nMr Wednesday is Odin\n\nLow-Key Lyesmith is Loki,\n\nMr Ibis is Thoth\n\nMr Jacquel is Anubis\n\nThe Elephant God is Lord Ganesha\n\nMama-Ji is Goddess Kali\n\nSimilarly, the New American Gods are manifestations of modernity, each one representing technology, Internet, media, globalisation, automobiles, cosmetic surgery and conspiracy theories.\n\nFabulation - Key takeaways\n\nFabulation is a mode of fiction that developed in the 20th century that experimented with the traditional conventions of realism by blending fantasy, magic, myth supernatural elements in the narrative.\n\nFabulation is often used interchangeably with the genres of metafiction, postmodern fiction and especially magical realism.\n\nThe main ideas within fabulation include:\n\nFantasy\n\nAllegory\n\nIrrealism\n\nExperimentation\n\nWorks of fabulation of well-known traditional fairytales, myths and fables, and therefore, impart the same moral lessons to its readers, but in a way that is entertaining, experimental and understandable.\n\nExamples of fabulation in literature include:\n\nGiles Goat-Boy (1966) by John Barth\n\nAmerican Gods (2001) by Neil Gaiman\n\nReferences\n\nG.S.
