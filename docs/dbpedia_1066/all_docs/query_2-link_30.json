        "text": "How is intelligence measured? How is it possible to just have one way to measure intelligence? Is there really only one way to measure every individual’s intelligence? According to psychologists Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg there is. Gardner and Sternberg have developed two different theories to do so. Howard Gardner’s theory of intelligence is the way in which one carries out life goals. Gardner chose eight abilities that held to meet criteria: linguistic (speak and write well), logical-mathematical\n\nThe Gettier Problem is a widely acknowledged philosophical question, named in honour of Edmund Gettier who discovered it in 1963, which questions whether a piece of information that someone believes for invalid reasons, but by mere happenstance is correct, counts as knowledge. Before the Gettier paper was published, it was widely believed that the Tripartite Theory of Knowledge- which states that Justified True Belief equaled knowledge- was fact. This means that with three conditions, one could know\n\nAs Robert Lee Frost, an honored American poet once said, “A poem begins as a lump in the throat, a sense of wrong, a homesickness, a lovesickness.” Frost earned respect through his expertise in colloquial language, and his descriptive interpretations of rural life. Frost often analyzed social and philosophical leitmotifs using settings from early twenty-first century New England. Frost was honored in his lifetime with four Pulitzers. Furthermore, focusing mostly on analyzing Frost’s most popular\n\nRAL INSTITUTIONALISM Neoliberal Institutionalism is one of many schools of international relations theory often used to both describe and predict trends and characteristics of the global political landscape. The ‘new’ liberal institutionalist school of international relations theory owes it roots to the functional integration study of the 1950’s and 1960’s, and the complex interdependence scholarship of the 1970’s and 1980’s (Lamy p.132). As part of the larger umbrella of liberal approaches, neoliberal\n\nThe day a white man stepped foot on to Canadian soil, was the start of troubles Indigenous people have dealt with. There have been so many events and cases where Indigenous people just want what they have rights over. “So far as actual events are concerned, Oka, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Delgamuukw and Nunavut..” were the only few that had made headlines in the news during the 1990s. There are so many little conflicts that government has with indigenous people that no one is aware\n\nContextualism today, is defined as the truth of a particular knowledge ascription dependent on the context in which that truth is uttered. Over the past century and decades there have been many great debates between philosopher’s over contextualism and how it can be used to disregard Skepticism. I agree with Cohen’s defense of Contextualism in regard’s to both how he answers Skepticism and Conee’s objections. Cohen starts off his defense of Contextualism by first explaining the skeptical\n\nDiscovering My Leadership Style Finding a leadership style is like finding the dress or suit that fits just right. It may take several attempts, but once you find the one that fits, it is usually the one you will keep. For this class, we were asked to take a 50 question survey from Kent University to help us figure out what type of leadership style fits us best. From the results provided from the test, my leadership style was typed as participative. When reading more about participative leadership\n\nDescribe your personality using a color, animal, or an object of your choice. If I had to describe myself as an animal, I would choose a dog. Surprisingly, I didn’t just choose this because I like dogs. Don’t get me wrong dogs are fantastic; but I chose a dog because of its characteristics. Everyone knows about that little dog that barks louder than any dog on the block. That dog is me; except lucky for you I don’t bark, nor am I covered in hair with a tail. What I mean to say is, from a distance\n\nRobert Ballard: Exploration of the Deep Sea Robert Ballard was one of the great explorers who discovered numerous secrets about the deep sea and science while encountering new creatures and natural resources as he explored and exchanged new ideas of using technology and incorporating it into his discoveries. Ballard is known for two of his most famous findings: the shipwreck of the Titanic and the Bismarck. The ideas of using technology to assist with his findings helped him create his own equipment\n\nAll literature reflects the values, attitudes and beliefs of the context of construction. Thus, this means that whenever we study any text, we must develop a deep understanding of how the context impacts upon the purpose of the texts and the writers intended discourses.
