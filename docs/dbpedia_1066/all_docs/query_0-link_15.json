        "text": "The MJP began in 1995 at Brown University, with funding from the University and small local grants, as a website of digital editions of periodicals connected to the rise of modernism in the English-speaking world.\n\nOur first major project began in 1996: a digital edition of The New Age, a British weekly magazine edited by A. R. Orage, from 1907 to 1922. In the course of preparing this edition, the MJP generated various supporting materials, including essays on contributors to the magazine, historical introductions to each six-month volume, and biographical sketches of over a thousand artists mentioned in the magazine, along with images of their work. Our edition of The New Age was completed, with the aid of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, in 2004.\n\nThe University of Tulsa joined the MJP in 2003. In 2005, using copies in Tulsa’s McFarlin Library, we were able to add Dana, an Irish magazine of 1904-1905 best known for first publishing James Joyce. In that same year, the MJP redesigned its technological infrastructure from scratch, both to accommodate growth and to bring its materials and methods into conformance with the best practices of the digital library community. At the same time, in response to requests from members of the Modernist Studies Association, the MJP added a digital edition of the well-known Vorticist magazine, Blast, based on copies in the McFarlin Library. The MJP’s website was also redesigned from the ground up, adding a data-driven, standards-compliant interface to the MJP’s resources.\n\nWith the help of another NEH grant during the 2008-2009 academic year, the MJP added a run of Poetry Magazine, from 1912 through 1922, and The English Review for the period when Ford Madox Hueffer (Ford) edited it, from 1908 to 1910. In the following year, the MJP completed a digital edition of Scribner’s Magazine, from 1910 through 1922. A third NEH grant, during the 2010-2011 academic year, allowed the MJP to produce editions of The Crisis, The Freewoman, The New Freewoman, The Egoist, The Little Review, and Others. During the 2011-12 academic year, the MJP also added an edition of The Dome (first series: 1897-1898) as well as a set of pages devoted to the Imagist Anthologies (1914-1917). That year also saw the launch of the MJP Lab, an area of research and teaching modules plus data downloads to support computational analysis of the periodicals. A fourth NEH grant from 2014-2016 allowed the MJP to add the muckraking years of McClure’s Magazine (1902-1911), a run of The Smart Set (1913-1922), The Masses, Camera Work, and The Seven Arts.\n\nIn 2016, the MJP began to migrate from its scratch-built infrastructure into the new Brown Digital Repository. The BDR offers new possibilities for computational analysis and use of our data through an Application Programming Interface (API). In 2019, we completed a brand new website with enhanced magazine viewing options. We are currently preparing a new round of digitized periodicals.\n\nSean Latham, Senior Advisor\n\nBeginning in 2003, Bob was joined by Sean Latham as co-director the MJP at Tulsa. A former Project Manager of the MJP at Brown, Sean is Editor of the James Joyce Quarterly at Tulsa, a Professor of English there, and the author of books and articles on modernist literature and humanities computing. He hosted the meeting of the Modernist Studies Association (MSA) at Tulsa in October 2006 and was President of the MSA in 2008-2009. In 2014, Sean became Director of the Oklahoma Center for Humanities at Tulsa, and stepped down from active involvement in the MJP; he is currently a senior advisor to the project.\n\nSusan Smulyan, Director of the MJP at Brown\n\nSusan joined the project in 2012 to help oversee the MJP's latest NEH grant. She is a Professor of American Studies at Brown as well as Director of the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage. She is the author of Selling Radio: The Commercialization of American Broadcasting and Popular Ideologies: Mass Culture at Mid-Century, and co-editor of Major Problems in American Popular Culture. She is currently interested in the relationship between the public arts and the public humanities.\n\nJeffrey Drouin, Director of the MJP at Tulsa\n\nJeff was the project's associate director from 2011 before replacing Sean as the Tulsa director in 2014. He is an Associate Professor of English with a special focus on Modernism and the Digital Humanities. His first book, James Joyce, Science, and Modernist Print Culture: The Einstein of English Fiction, was published by Routledge in 2015. He is currently completing a digital humanities and book project on church architecture and memory in Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu.\n\nClifford Wulfman, Technical Advisor\n\nCliff holds a PhD from Yale University in modern literature and an MS in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania. He has published work on modernism and humanities computing, including Modernism in the Magazines, which he co-wrote with Bob Scholes. Cliff is currently the Coordinator of Library Digital Initiatives at Princeton University, where he directs the Blue Mountain Project and is and a consultant for the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton."
