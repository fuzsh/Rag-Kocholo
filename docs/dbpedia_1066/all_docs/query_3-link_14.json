        "text": "Language is foundational to all learning. Whether it is the medium for the communication of our thoughts or whether it comes from the texts we consume and produce, there is little doubt that we are constructed and we construct ourselves through language. For these reasons and more, the most important participants in our most important institutions are those who teach language at the primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. It is from the inspiration and genius of these individuals that our citizens, our workers, our social theorists, our artists, our scientists, and our leaders emerge. There is no higher social calling, no work more honorable than teaching critical approaches to the consumption and production of language. It is no accident, either, that English is a core subject required of the 69 million students enrolled in primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institutions in the United States. Our English teachers, however, face a myriad of challenges that threaten to intervene in the potentially symbiotic relationship between language pedagogy, social consciousness, and individual liberation. The changing nature of literacy, the technocratic demands on the K-16 literacy curricula from an information-based economy, the fragmentation of college English departments, and external constraints imposed by the latest testing regime leave these educators alienated, ambivalent arbiters of a hotly contested and highly ambiguous discipline. At the same time, the proliferation of new literacies; the development of women's studies and cultural studies; and the emergence of semiotics, discourse, and critical literary theories have made the study of language, literacy, and literature as relevant and desirable as ever.\n\nIn this nation's schools, there must be an increased focus on dialectical and critical though if there is ever going to be substantive societal change. Due to No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the increased focus on standardization and uniformity of thought, there has been a move away from critical thinking and the fight for social justice. This article discusses Marx's notion of dialectical thought and its necessity in the secondary English/Language Arts classroom. This is interwoven with examples of techniques and projects that help students view the world around them in a more critical fashion.\n\nDrawing on post-colonial theory, the study offers a critical reading of the current status of the 'Middle Eastern' educational systems, the English literary education, in particular. It also considers the contribution of post-colonial theory in educational and literary studies by exploring possibilities to challenge hegemonic ideologies and relations of power in education. I argue that being at the heart of colonial relations, 'post-colonial' educational systems are still largely entrapped by a modelling approach which was rooted during the era of colonialism and further consolidated by the unequal contemporary world relations. The creation of this capitalised structure has established an enduring relational system between the centre and the margin; and in the long run, keeps the latter cleaving to the values of the first. In the literary sphere, such ideologies still perpetuate their regulation and dissemination of the 'high cultural' or 'canonical' traditions. In an attempt to address these inherent problems, the study explores the possibility of forwarding the post-colonial critical tenets by curving out wholesale the notions 'Hybridity', 'Third Space', Diaspora and Dialogism in the context of Critical Pedagogy. The study contributes to a wider debate in critical educational and literary studies by means of disrupting and problematising the meta-narratives and discourses of universality and standardisation. It also contributes to theory and pedagogy by exploring strands of theories so far believed to be discrete."
