All initial and/or processing fees are non-refundable.\n\nTypes of Membership\n\nJUNIOR\n\n(under 18) Junior members pay no annual dues, and may not vote or hold office. At age 18 they are automatically upgraded to regular membership. Applicants for junior membership pay a, one time, non-refundable application fee of $50. REGULAR\n\n(18 or over) Dues for regular members are $50 a year. Applicants for regular membership pay a non-refundable application fee of $75. Their dues are waived for the current year. LIFE Life membership, which exempts members from payment of annual dues, is open to a member of any age for a fee based on their age. Junior members shall become Life Members upon payment of $1,000.00. Regular members between the ages of 18 and 40 years shall become Life Members upon payment of $750.00. Regular members over the age of 40 years shall become Life Members upon payment of $600.00. New Applicants for life membership pay this fee in addition to a seperate check (processing fee) of $50. HONORARY Honorary membership is granted to a maximum of three people a year by vote of the general membership. Honorary members, who cannot be eligible by reason of lineal descent, are chosen for having rendered outstanding service to Texas by furthering the aims and goals of the Sons of the Republic of Texas. POSTHUMOUS Application for posthumous membership may be made on behalf of any deceased person who would otherwise be eligible for membership, so long as his death occurred after the founding of the SRT (March 30,1922). The $150 fee includes processing and a bronze grave marker.\n\nReinstatement\n\nSee Renewal Below\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAll donations in excess of the annual dues are tax deductible. Dues are payable in advance for each calendar year. A member can vote and hold office in one chapter, but can hold dual membership in other chapters on payment of $6.00 for each additional chapter. A member may transfer his membership affiliation to another chapter, but must request in writing. A processing fee of $30 must be paid for each supplemental ancestor that the SRT acknowledges.\n\nAnnual Dues\n\nAnnual dues shall be assessed for the calendar year, January 1 to December 31, and shall be payable in advance to the Organization. Dues will be considered delinquent ninety (90) days after January 1 of the then current year, and after dues become delinquent the member may be suspended for non-payment of dues at the direction of the Executive Committee. A prior notice of delinquent members will be sent to the chapter prior to the annual meeting.\n\nRenewal\n\nAfter a membership suspension, a member may be dropped from active membership and denied all benefits arising there from. A member, suspended for non-payment of dues may be reinstated by paying dues for the year's which his reinstatement is effective ($50) and a fifty $50.00 reinstatement fee.\n\nBelow, please find the applications in both Word and PDF.
