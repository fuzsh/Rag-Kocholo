        "text": "Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821 following 11 years of conflict. With independence achieved, Mexico struggled to find its own independent identity, first establishing a monarchy then a constitutional republic. The need to protect the northern frontier prompted the government to establish colonization laws that allowed colonists into Texas. Large groups of people moved to Texas, with the attraction of land and an opportunity to start over. People, such as Stephen F. Austin, helped to facilitate the arrival of immigrants to Texas by ways of colonies and land grants. Many of these colonists, along with the native population, enjoyed a semi-autonomous way of life far from the capital in Mexico.\n\nThe Texas colonists’ autonomy was challenged with the centralization of power in Mexico City. In 1833, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was elected President of Mexico. When he abolished the Constitution of 1824, it prompted a Mexican Civil War and the Texas independence movement. His political views would change from federalism to centralism, causing Mexico to fall into a civil war and Texas to seek its own independence. Laws changed curtailing the influx of immigrants as well as the autonomy that Texans had grown used to. Texas, with its lower population, was joined to the neighboring state of Coahuila, forming the state of Coahuila y Texas.\n\nOn October 2, 1835, the Texas Revolution began as tension boiled over and shots were fired in the town of Gonzales. The Mexican Army had been sent to recover a cannon that was loaned to the town for protection against aggressive native tribes. Upon their arrival, 18 men stood on the opposite side of the river and refused to hand over the cannon. The Mexican Army searched for a way to cross the river, but while searching were called back by the colonists to discuss the cannon.\n\nThis time there were approximately 180 men on the other side of the river – outnumbering the Mexican Army force of 100 dragoons (mounted infantry). The people of Gonzales once again refused to return the cannon, arguing that they were fighting to uphold the Constitution of 1824.\n\nThat night, the men of Gonzales crossed the river searching for the Mexican Army. It was foggy and both defensive forces bumped into one another in the night. Both groups fell back to await daybreak.\n\nThe following day, October 2, 1835, both groups met on the field of battle. The Texans fired a shot at the Mexican Army, leading to the start of the Texas Revolution. The Mexican Army retreated to arrange for a parlay. Discussions did not lead to a resolution, and therefore the fighting continued. The Mexican Army realized they were outnumbered and retreated to Bexar.\n\nAfter this encounter, the Mexican Army returned to San Antonio without the cannon, which was seen as a victory for the Texan army. Emboldened, Texan forces decided to follow and march to San Antonio as well.\n\nWith General Cos’ soldiers gone, but in expectation of a counter-attack, the Texans began to fortify both the Alamo and the town. The Texans worked to repair the Mexican constructed entrenchments and fortifications, and brought additional cannons to the site. Just after the Siege of Bexár and the Battle of the Alamo, the Alamo had over 30 cannons on site. Some were distributed to other locations in Texas to help prepare for ensuing clashes. Because San Antonio de Bexár was located on the main roads leading into Texas, it was of strategic importance in maintaining supply lines as well as communications. The Texans saw it was necessary to maintain it in order to protect the settlements located to the east.\n\nJust as General Cos’ Army headed towards the Rio Grande to Mexico, General Santa Anna’s Army were marching north towards Texas, unbeknownst to the Texans. Their plan was to take back the town of Bexár and end the Texas Revolution once and for all.\n\nSanta Anna’s Army began to arrive in San Antonio de Bexár on February 23, 1836. Their arrival prompted members of the Texan Army to enter the Alamo, which was by now heavily fortified.\n\nThe Alamo had 18 serviceable cannons and approximately 150 men at the start of the siege. As the Mexican Army arrived, a parlay was called by one of the two Alamo Commanders, James Bowie, a famous adventurer and knife fighter. Green B. Jameson, chief engineer of the garrison met with Mexican officials. Santa Anna’s terms were surrender at discretion, meaning he would decide their fate. The other Alamo Commander, 26-year-old William B. Travis answered with a cannon shot from the 18-pounder cannon. The Siege of the Alamo had begun. Santa Anna ordered a red flag to be flown from San Fernando Church showing that no quarter would be given.\n\nOn February 24, 1836, with the garrison surrounded and the Texan Army at the Alamo outnumbered, one of the most famous letters in American history was written by William B. Travis. It was addressed, “To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World.” This letter was a passionate plea for aid for the Alamo garrison. He ended the letter “Victory or Death” – the only outcome this battle could have. That letter left the Alamo and the siege continued.\n\nOn March 1, 1836, 32 men from the town of Gonzales arrived to aid the Alamo. This brought the number of defenders up to almost 200 men.\n\nOn March 2, 1836, Texas declared its independence from Mexico.\n\nOn March 3, 1836, courier James Butler Bonham arrived at the Alamo with word from Robert Williamson informing Travis help was on the way. Unfortunately it would not arrive in time.\n\nOn March 5, 1836, Santa Anna held a council of war, setting forth this plan for a four pronged attack of the garrison."
