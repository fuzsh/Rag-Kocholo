        "text": "Assuming that Texas went independant from Mexico in 1836 as it did in OTL, then; let's see; I can see Utah becoming a state in the late 40s, maybe California around the same time, irregardless of the gold discoveries, but the Californios would probably remain in control of the state [as should have happened in OTL, but the Anglo- Americans treated them very unfairly]\n\nColorado would have come in sooner or later, probably not until at least the '60s or maybe the 70s [OTL '76] with a strong Spanish influence, somewhat offset by miners and mountain men from the US.\n\nWith Santa Fe as the capital, and it being a long established town, I can see NM joining as early as the late '40s, but again, the Spanish [Not Mexican] influence would be very strong here.\n\nAriz. was too empty of any but Indian tribes to be eligible for statehood until near the turn of the century. Likewise Nevada. In OTL, it was the first of the mountain states to get statehood [1864] but it was empty of people except for a few silver miners. A political decision caused it to be a state about 25 years before it should have been. And as for Wyoming, the map of Mexico before the American land grab of '48 shows only the SW corner of Wyoming being Mexican territory. It too, was not fit for statehhod till about 1890. I can just imagine it as a state when Red Cloud/Spotted Tail went on their rampage in '66. Oklahoma was, I believe, all US territory and never a part of Texas, in any event, the indian treaties which had been signed, probably precluded it from doing anything much different than the 1907 ststehood as in OTL. As from anything south of the border, I won't even speculate about that, we would need to look at the War of the Reform and the French intervention to discuss that.\n\nWhy would Texas federalise? How.... americocentric.\n\nI really don't see Texas expanding that much, at least not for a long time. They couldn't control Sante Fe (only made one attempt to do so) which was in their claimed borders. For that matter, they couldn't control anything west or south of San Antonio really. It'll take decades of growth before they could control their claimed borders, let alone expand from there.\n\nSo they would stick with counties as the largest political subdivision for sometime.\n\nYou're right, it's probably close to ASB, but imagine if you would that they weren't broke, and did expand.\n\nYou're right, it's probably close to ASB, but imagine if you would that they weren't broke, and did expand.\n\nI think people are two quick to say ASB. It's unlikely, but not ASB given enough time. I was reacting to oudi14's schedule.\n\nTexas isn't going to want to go to a state structure where the original Texas gets so badly outnumbered, so if they did go to a state structure the original Texas (by which I mean the actual occupied part) would likely be split up into states. I'd see these states (I'm not going to guess names)\n\nSan Antonio/Austin/Hill Country\n\nRio Grande Valley\n\nNorth Central (Greater DFW)\n\nNorth East\n\nSouth East (Greater Houston)\n\nWest Texas and New Mexico\n\nA state north of New Mexico (the parts of Utah/Colorado)\n\nA California including Arizona\n\nBaja/Sonora/Chihuahua\n\nNo Texas Empire....\n\nbut perhaps an expanded Confederation of the Rio Grande.\n\nTexas if it stays independent and out otf the US will be relegated to only the original state of Tejas.\n\nHow ever they could support the Confederation of the Rio Grande and even join that to attempt to become an influential part of that new entity along the North of Mexico. However, whether Texas would be more influential than the Span/Mex states of Nueva Leon, Tamaulipas and Coahuila would be doubtful... It would depend on immigration patterns in the aftermath.\n\nSuch a state if it successful took in Alta & Baja California, Nueva Mexico, Sonora and Chihuahua could fill the vacuum of North Mexico as an immigrant state. Catholic immigration from Europe anyone? It would have a hard time defending the region though from Mexican reassertion of sovreignty without either US or outside European support.\n\nStates...of such an expanded Confederation:\n\nTexas\n\nTamaulipas ( original Mexican boundaries)\n\nNueva Leon\n\nCoahuila ( Same as Tam.)\n\nSonora\n\nChihuahua\n\nAlta California Norte\n\nAlta California Sul\n\nBaja California\n\nBaja Nueva Mexico ( Think basically West Texas here)\n\nAlta Nueva Mexico\n\nColorado ( what is Otl Arizona south of the Colorado River)\n\nDeseret/Utah, (depending on the influence of the Mormons)"
