You actually need both Criswell & Shull references to figure out what you have and even then you might not be able to figure out which variety you actually have. If you have questions about the cataloging of any CF note don't hesitate to write me for my opinion. If I don't have an answer for you, I will contact Mike Stair for his opinion. I consider Mike to be the foremost authority on these Consolidated Fund notes.\n\nI will do my best to explain what variety I'm offering and why I've assigned a number that might not be found in Criswell or Shull. There are listings that don't exist in Criswell as well as Shull and others that have yet to be assigned a number by Shull.\n\nHOUSTON none in stock at this time in stock none in stock\n\nCF 8 $500 #\n\nCF10 $100 #\n\nAUSTIN none in stock at this time\n\nCF14 $100\n\nCF 15A $100 #\n\nRepublic of Texas\n\nAustin Change Notes: A1 $1 A2 $2 A3 $3 These notes have blank reverses\n\nThere may be archival tape closing cuts as well as pin-holes I do not mention in my descriptions.\n\nA1 $1\n\nA1 $1 # none in stock at this time\n\nA2 $2\n\nA2 $2 # none in stock at this time\n\nA2 $2 #4415 There are old stamp hinges closing some, but not all of the cut cancellations on the back. If you think you might submit this note to a 3rd party grading service sometime in the future, let me know and I'll remove those stamp hinges. They list cancel closing hinges as \"repairs\" and it isn't hard to remove them at all. This note has a Tight Cut, yet the borders are well defined.

It's just a \"Dirty\" thick paper variety. This note grades Fine Plus in my opinion. It has Nice Color, Contrast & Balance. PMG grades it as Very Good 10 and it has a Fricke \"PLUS\" sticker so even he thinks it is better than PMG graded it. $750.00 obv obv\n\nA3 $3 #2407 This note has Great Color & Contrast and Wonderful Paper; but, the Balance is a little off. The slant at the left end isn't the fault of anyone except the printer who who didn't allow the paper to dry evenly. It didn't have enough pressure at top left and drew inward.

The reverse Color is a bit faded. For some reason, the paper and ink used for the $100's and $500's didn't hold the orange ink on the reverse as well as it did for the other denomination from what I have witnessed over the years.
