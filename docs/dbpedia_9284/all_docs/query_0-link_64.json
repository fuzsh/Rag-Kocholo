        "text": "Montgomery Texas happens to be one of the oldest towns in Texas and the Birthplace of the Texas Flag! Prior to being chartered in 1837, Montgomery had been known as Lake Creek Settlement known to some as Montgomery Settlement and also known as Montgomery Prairie. In Montgomery's early days, it was the trade center for a large farming area, where stagecoach and telegraph lines crossed. The first school was established in 1839 and in 1848 the City of Montgomery was incorporated. A building boom occurred in the 1850's and some of the fine homes built at the time remain today with descendants of the original owners or early owners occupying them.\n\nThe Lone Star Flag with its vivid colors of red, white, blue with a single inset 5-point star has served as a proud symbol of Texas. At the request of Mirabeau B. Lamar, President of the Republic of Texas, commissioned Dr. Charles Bellinger Stewart a resident of Montgomery to create the Texas Flag. The Lone Star Flag was officially adopted in 1839, and since that time has adorned flagpoles across the State of Texas. Dr. Stewart's original drawing signed by President Lamar is held at the State Archives in Austin. A copy of the original drawing can be viewed in our N.H. Davis Pioneer Complex & Museum. Dr. Stewart is buried in the New Montgomery Cemetery, found in 1868.\n\nOn May 30, 1997, the House of Representatives of the 75th Texas Legislature officially commemorated Montgomery County as the Birthplace of the Lone Star Flag."
