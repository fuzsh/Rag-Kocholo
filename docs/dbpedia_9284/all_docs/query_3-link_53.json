Only three members may be elected to the order in any one year.\n\nTo be eligible for Knighthood in the Order of San Jacinto, a person must be an active member of The Sons of the Republic of Texas, either by lineal descent or as an honorary member.

Their main purpose was to accompany the Texas Veterans Association members to their annual reunions. The Texas Veterans Association ceased to exist when its last member, Alphonso Steele, died in 1911. With the demise of the Texas Veterans Association, the Sons of the Republic of Texas slowly became inactive.\n\nOn March 2, 1922, the ideals of the Texas Veterans Association adopted by the first Sons of the Republic of Texas once again inspired the formation of a new organization. Its revitalization was due in a large part by the realization that Texas heritage would not be remembered without constant reminders to the community. Membership requirements for the SRT were broadened to include any male being a direct descendant of a resident of the Republic of Texas. The San Jacinto Chapter, located in Houston, Texas, received the first charter. On October 20, 1934, the SRT was incorporated under the laws of Texas as a non-profit corporation.\n\nThe SRT has been an active leader in preserving Texasâ rich heritage. In 1936, the SRT was instrumental in the design and construction of the San Jacinto Monument and the founding of the Museum. In 1957, the SRT influenced the Texas legislature to appropriate funds for the construction of the Texas State Library and Archive Building. In 2003, the SRT and other historical organizations worked with the Texas legislature to designate March as Texas History Month. In 2005, the SRT led the movement for the Texas legislature to designate the third Saturday in September of each year as Texian Navy Day.\n\nThe Sons of the Republic of Texas (âSRTâ) values and respects the privacy of each of its members.
