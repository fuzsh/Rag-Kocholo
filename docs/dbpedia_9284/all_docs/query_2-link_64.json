        "text": "In 1997, when members of an armed militia surrounded his house in the scrubby mountains of West Texas, Joe Rowe felt an odd rush of relief. Rowe’s conflict with the group, which called itself the Republic of Texas, had been simmering for years. The Republic of Texas believed that Texas was a separate nation not under the control of the United States. The group was becoming increasingly popular across the state, converting more of Rowe’s neighbors to its cause. He knew that the militia was eyeing his house as a potential headquarters. When he and his wife, M.A., would go to town for a few hours, they’d return to the feeling that someone had been inside their home. So that April morning, when the guns finally came out, part of Rowe was satisfied to be dealing with the reality of armed conflict, rather than just the fear of it. “Now I know how they’re gonna do it,” Rowe recalled recently. “We’re finally going to get this party over with.”\n\nRowe is a rail-thin man with white hair that grazes his shoulders. In the nineteen-eighties, when he was working in the oil industry, he bought a plot of land with a commanding view, arranged an early retirement, and set about building an adobe house among the junipers and piñon pines. The land was in the Davis Mountains Resort, a remote community that attracted people who valued independence over amenities. Water came from the communal well; to get rid of your trash, you drove it twenty-plus miles to the dump in town. In exchange for a certain amount of self-reliance, you could count on being generally unbothered. Landowners were, however, subject to fees of several dollars a month, which, Rowe said, largely went to maintaining the community’s unpaved, lightly rutted roads.\n\nOne of Rowe’s new neighbors was a former winemaker from Missouri named Rick McLaren. “He was crazy, but smart,” Rowe recalled. “He was like an evangelist preacher. He could talk so fast that, when he got through, you had no idea what he’d said but you felt like you’d heard one hell of a story. Very persuasive.” McLaren was well known locally for his legal filings, which were so abundant that they had their own dedicated cabinet in the county courthouse. In the nineties, McLaren latched on to an idea: that the annexation of Texas, in 1845, was illegitimate, which meant that Texas wasn’t part of the United States. He began recruiting people to join him as citizens of the Republic of Texas, assuring them that as citizens they wouldn’t be subject to taxes, or to many of the fees and regulations that came with being a U.S. resident. He persuaded one couple to stop paying their mortgage, because debt was unconstitutional, and persuaded many others that the D.M.R. assessment fees were illegitimate.\n\nThe Rowes were skeptical, but plenty of their D.M.R. neighbors, who skewed libertarian, were receptive to McLaren’s ideas. “People were ready for him,” Rowe said. “It was like the Messiah had come.” Calling himself the consul-general of the Republic, McLaren set up an embassy in an old travel trailer behind the D.M.R. store. The Republic of Texas, which aligned with the burgeoning sovereign-citizen movement, began to draw followers across the state. Members made their own license plates and issued a notice of eviction to the state’s governor, George W. Bush. They sued the federal government, claiming that it owed the Republic ninety-three trillion dollars in reparations stemming from the Civil War.\n\nIn 1995, McLaren began placing orders for things—Republic of Texas passports, star-shaped badges that said “Ranger”—which he attempted to pay for with his own version of money, which he called warrants. “That’s when I realized this was just a scam,” one former affiliate told me. The movement splintered into factions. From his West Texas embassy, McLaren sent faxes to militia groups around the country and invited their members to come to the D.M.R. to train. “There’d be fifteen, twenty, thirty people coming out to do military exercises for three or four days,” Rowe said. “Just shooting their asses off. Automatic weapons. Then they’d leave and another bunch would come in.” McLaren was surrounded by bodyguards. He drove with one car in front of him and another behind. “It was like he was a goddam South American dictator,” Rowe said.\n\nRowe told me that, years earlier, when his friend Pablo Acosta had been on the run from the law, Rowe hid him overnight in a pump house. (Acosta went on to be a powerful drug smuggler.) “So I have mixed emotions about some of these hardened criminals,” he said. But McLaren’s antics struck him as a step too far. Rowe’s house stood on a hill at the entrance of the community; from his second-story deck, he could see everyone coming and going. His location, plus the role that he played in collecting assessment fees, put Rowe in McLaren’s crosshairs; he learned that the group was now calling him “Military Target Number Two.” (No. 1 was a federal judge who’d ruled against McLaren.)\n\nAs tensions mounted, Steve Bailey, the local sheriff, drove two hundred miles to Midland to meet with the Texas Ranger Barry Caver. He explained that any problem with the Republic would likely exceed his capacity. He and a deputy were tasked with patrolling one of the largest counties in Texas. The Republic outnumbered and likely outgunned them, and it was said that the group had booby-trapped the land around the embassy.\n\nIn late April, 1997, Rowe’s son and grandchildren came to visit. One day, they saw a group of people gathered on a ridge overlooking the house. The sunlight glanced off something—binoculars? A rifle sight? Either way, Rowe says, “I was hot.” He tried to confront the men, but they sped away in a white van. He called Sheriff Bailey. “I said, ‘This shit has gone on long enough, and I’m not going to tolerate it. Now I gotta worry about my little bitty grandkids getting hurt?’ ” According to Rowe, Bailey assured him that if he ever saw any of the Republic of Texas members outside the D.M.R., he’d do his best to bust them. The next morning, Rowe saw a familiar white van heading into town. He called Bailey, who pulled over a Republic of Texas member named Robert Scheidt for speeding. When he searched the van, he found several illegal weapons, including an automatic rifle.\n\nRowe heard Bailey announce the arrest over the police scanner, which he figured meant that McLaren had heard it, too. McLaren had been saying that any arrest of a member of the Republic would be taken as a declaration of war. Shortly after the arrest, Rowe heard a car pull into his driveway. His dog, Luca, went wild on the porch, letting out the special barks that she reserved for people she didn’t like. Rowe watched as a handful of people in fatigues surrounded the house. As M.A., his wife, called 911, Rowe cracked the front door open. He saw a man he recognized, Greg Paulson, crouching steps away. Paulson called out to him, demanding that he cede the house to the Republic of Texas.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, I don’t want to give it to you,’ ” Rowe said. He was in a decent defensive position, and had his pistol trained right between Paulson’s eyes. But then he thought about M.A., who was standing in a room surrounded by windows, and about Luca, out on the porch. He’d read in a militia manual that one of the first steps in taking over a civilian location was to neutralize the pets. Rowe offered to disarm if Paulson promised not to shoot Luca, and Paulson agreed. But, when Rowe set the pistol down, the movement seemed to startle Paulson, who fired off a three-round burst from his Soviet-era rifle. A bullet struck Rowe in the shoulder. He fell to the ground, “bleeding like a stuck hog,” he said. “And that took the piss and vinegar out of me.”\n\nThree Republic of Texas members came into the house: Paulson; his wife, Karen; and a jittery man named Richard Keyes, who looked, according to Rowe, as if he couldn’t wait to shoot somebody. As M.A. applied pressure to Rowe’s shoulder, the Republic of Texas members informed them that they were prisoners of war. But they seemed overwhelmed by what they’d got themselves into.\n\nAfter M.A. stanched the bleeding, Paulson asked Rowe to put his guns in a pile in the living room. (When I asked Rowe how many that was, he seemed briefly overwhelmed by the question. “Shit,” he said. “In the house? There’s nine in that cabinet,” he said, then gestured with his cigarette to different corners of the house. “Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen . . . eighteen I know of.”)\n\nAs word of the hostage-taking spread, hundreds of law-enforcement officers converged on the D.M.R. The recent, disastrous sieges at Waco and Ruby Ridge, where aggressive federal responses resulted in the deaths of more than eighty people, loomed large in everyone’s mind. According to Ranger Caver, who ran the operation, the Attorney General, Janet Reno, “didn’t want any part” of dealing with the siege. “Knowing that the federal government had already received two black eyes for Waco and Ruby Ridge, she couldn’t stand another hit like that,” Caver said.\n\nInside the house, Rowe listened to his CB radio and heard McLaren calling for backup. (Texas Rangers eventually detained a number of people attempting to come to McLaren’s aid, including seven armed men arrested at a truck stop in Pecos.) He had the surreal experience of watching his own hostage-taking covered live on CNN. Rowe stood with Paulson on the deck and gazed out at the police cars massing at the entrance of the community. “The more of them he saw, the more scared he got,” Rowe said.\n\nMcLaren eventually agreed to a prisoner swap of sorts: Scheidt, the man who’d been arrested that morning, in exchange for the Rowes. When it was time to make the switch, Paulson was stymied. The group had a getaway car, but earlier that day Keyes had shot out its tires in an attempt to block the road. Paulson asked Rowe if he could borrow his pickup instead. Given the situation, “I thought that was a strange request,” Rowe said. But, in the past twelve hours, he and Paulson had developed a grudging relationship. “He said, ‘What do you want me to do with the keys?,’ and I said, ‘I don’t care, just throw them on the floorboard.’ He said, ‘You know, I’d feel better if I locked it.’ ”\n\nAfter the swap, an ambulance took Rowe to the hospital. Meanwhile, Keyes and the Paulsons joined the half-dozen remaining members of the Republic holed up at the embassy. McLaren periodically sent followers out to deliver what he called diplomatic pouches to the Rangers, communiqués with “just volumes of this legal jargon and all this stuff,” Caver later recalled. “It didn’t mean anything to me.”\n\nFinally, after about a week of this, Caver said, “I got tired of it.” He began making preparations to take action against the embassy the following afternoon. That day, Scheidt turned himself in. That night, McLaren’s wife, Evelyn, told them she’d think about it and give a response at 8 A.M. the next morning. But hours went by, and there was no word from her. “We finally pick up the phone and call her,” Caver said. “She had been doing typical ladies’ stuff. She was in the bathroom primping, doing her hair and her makeup.” Eventually, Evelyn came out.\n\nMcLaren had drawn up a ceasefire document full of wordy stipulations, which Caver signed in front of Evelyn. That seemed to be enough for McLaren, who gave himself up a couple hours later, as did the Paulsons. McLaren considered the surrender a win; as he saw it, the United States had entered into a formal treaty with the Republic of Texas. Two remaining holdouts, Keyes and Mike Matson, refused to surrender and fled into a canyon. Matson was killed a few days later in a gun battle with authorities, after he killed a tracking hound, which had attacked him, and shot at a police helicopter. Keyes was captured four months later, on the other side of the state. McLaren, the Paulsons, Keyes, and a supporter named Richard Otto all received lengthy sentences and remain in prison.\n\nRowe took his injury in stride. “The score ended up being State of Texas six, Republic of Texas one,” he said. “We won that ballgame.” His wife had a harder time recovering. “She never got over people coming in her house like that—the violation,” he told me. A few years after the hostage-taking, they divorced. When I asked how it felt to continue to live alongside people who’d supported McLaren, Rowe shrugged. “Some people still sympathize with him,” he said. “My momma used to say, You keep stirring shit, you make it stink. Why stir it up? I don’t have any hard feelings.”\n\nHe does have hard feelings about the television producers who interviewed him a few years ago, for a segment that included a reënactment. In the reënactment, Rowe said, his house was a trailer behind a chain-link fence. (His actual home is an elegant two-story adobe building with lofty ceilings and an eighteen-foot stone fireplace.) As M.A., they cast an actress who Rowe says looked nothing like his ex-wife. “Now, she’s my ex-wife and all that, but she’s a damn fine-looking woman,” he said. “And for my dog, my faithful dog, they used some scroungy-looking thing.” Luca was a registered blue heeler and, Rowe says, also damn fine-looking.\n\nBefore I left, Rowe pulled aside a painting of a covered wagon to show me a hole in the wall made by one of Paulson’s stray bullets. I asked him whether, given the polarized state of the country, he could see something like the Republic of Texas standoff happening again. After all, Texas secession, once a subject confined to the fringe’s fringe, is increasingly becoming a topic of debate in mainstream Republican circles. “I think if Rick McLaren was available he could stir up some hell,” Rowe said. There’s even a small part of him that understands the appeal. When Cliven Bundy mounted a standoff against the federal government in 2014, Rowe said, he felt sympathetic. “But that’s a fool’s errand,” he said. “That’s not the way you win.”"
