Before Texas became a state, it was a country. The Republic of Texas was a country born out of a fight for independence, on the backs of men and women at places like Gonzales, the Alamo and San Jacinto.

​In 1845, the Lone Star State was born. Texans are very proud of their history. And, we at Lone Star Bee Company are very proud of our name!

​​One of the many things that we Texans love about our state is the deep sense of pride that is shared by our residents. Texas’s pride is the result of a fascinating and dramatic history that is like no other U.S. state. One of our state’s well-remembered historical chapters occurred when Texas stood on its own as a nation; as the Republic of Texas.

Texas was once an independent, sovereign country known as the Republic of Texas. The republic declared independence from the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836 and existed until February 19, 1846. The boundaries of the country reached far north into states known today as Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming and westward into New Mexico and the size of the Republic of Texas totaled roughly 389,200 square miles.

​The first flag to represent the Republic of Texas was the Burnet Flag, which displayed a single gold star on a dark blue background. In 1839, the Lone Star Flag was official adopted and still represents the state of Texas today.
