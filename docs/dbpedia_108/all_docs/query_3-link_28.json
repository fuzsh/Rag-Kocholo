        "text": "On Font Weight\n\n1. Example: Lucida Basic font weights.\n\nLucida Basic font weight names combine traditional weight names with CSS font-weight numbers.\n\nThe combination of a name + number specifies weights within each Lucida style and also coordinates weights and names between different Lucida families.\n\nNames like “UltraThin”, “Thin”, “Normal”, and “Black” suggest the visual impression of each weight. Corresponding CSS numbers, 100, 200, 400, and 800, respectively, indicate that each weight in the list is twice as dark as the previous one.\n\nOther progressions are also definable in this naming method. For example, in the series of Normal (400), Bold (600), and ExtraBlack (900), each successive weight is 1.5 times as dark as the previous one.\n\nThe many gradations of weight in Lucida allow a typographer or graphic designer to choose different kinds of weight progressions for different contexts, different printing methods, different display methods, from ebooks to display screens of different resolutions.\n\nThis table shows the series of weight names and numerical designations.\n\nIn this naming system, when several weights in one style \"suite\" are installed, they will usually sort by relative weight, so users can see an orderly gamut of weights and choose a desired weight more easily.\n\nOther examples of Lucida font weight series can be seen at:\n\nLucida Matrix\n\nLucida Sans Suite\n\nLucida Sans Texts\n\nGray tone of text. The ratio of the thickness of vertical stems in letters like ‘l’ to its font x-height is a way that type designers measure relative weights. In Lucida Lite (Light) weight, the x-height is 7.3 times the vertical stem thickness. In Lucida normal weight, the x-height is 5.5 times the vertical stem thickness. In Lucida bold, the x-height is 3.7 times the vertical stem thickness. As weight goes up, the stem/x-height ratio goes down. This method is a good rule-of-thumb, but the bolder weights are not as visually bold as the number indicate.\n\nA more accurate way to indicate visual weight is to measure actual ink coverage of each weight, or, for modern digital devices, the percentage of black pixels in the total area of the typeface body when the font is set solid, that is, with no extra leading or inter-line spacing. This may be more difficult to measure, but gives a more precise estimation of the graphical facts. A third method, which typographers have used for five hundred years, is to estimate weight by eye and use a name descriptive enough to convey the visual impression. That is how we get names like “light”, “bold”, and “black” to denote what are essentially all tones of gray.\n\nCSS # weight\n\nStandard CSS weight steps are multiples of 100, including 200, 300, 400, 500, and so on up to 900. For some usages, however, particularly in body text, finer increments are needed to fine-tune tone and readability. Therefore, several Lucida weight steps are offered in finer increments: 150, 250, 350, 375, 425, 450, 550, 650, 999 (this last is really 1,000, but some systems and applications don’t recognize four digit CSS weight numbers.\n\nWhy do the Lucida fonts offer more weight gradations?\n\nTo allow UI designers, graphic designers, and typographers to tune text and display tones and readability in a wide range of contexts. By choosing from among fine gradations of light and dark weights, a designer can adjust users’ perceptions of text. The goal is not “thin” or “fat” typography but readable typography.\n\nExtremes. Ultrathin (100) on the light end and UltraBlack (999) on the dark end are the current extremes of the Lucida weight gamut. Maximum weight is ten times minimum weight, offering a dramatic range of expressiveness, from fashionably thin to powerfully bold.\n\nMain text. Lucida fonts offer finely graded weights for main text, also called running text or body text in a normal reading range. The central weights are Book (350), Text (375), Normal (400), Thick (425), and ExtraThick (450) weights. These subtle gradations enable designers to fine-tune the tone of text in different technical and expressive contexts, for different polarities (black on white versus white on black), colors, and backgrounds, and for different resolutions and technologies of screen displays as well as different printing technologies and paper qualities. The visual impact of a typeface can vary substantially in different contexts. For instance, text in reverse polarity, dropped out of a black or colored background, is more effective if its weight is slightly darker than the weight in black on weight. The fine gradations of Lucida weights permits subtle adjustments.\n\nCSS # versus Pixel %. Weight increments measured by stem to x-height ratios, as expressed in the Lucida CSS weight numbers, are not quite the same as increments expressed by pixel counts. In the CSS weight numeration of Lucida Sans, the Lite (Light) weight of 300 is 75% of the Normal weight of 400, and the Bold weight of 600 is 150% darker than the normal weight, while the Black weight 800 is 200% (twice) the weight of Normal 400. All very exact.\n\nHowever, tonal values measured as pixel percentages show a lesser weight progression. Lucida Lite (Light) weight is roughly 75% of the Normal weight, but the Bold weight is only 132% darker than the normal weight, and the Black weight is only 158% darker than the Normal weight, not 200%.\n\nWhy the difference between the two methods of measure? Because the x-height/stem ratio doesn’t take into account other particularities of type design, including white areas above the x-line and below the base-line, x-height, letter widths, or spaces inside and surrounding the letters. In many type designs, bold weights are somewhat wider than normal weights, thus reducing the emboldening effect of increased stem thicknesses.\n\nPerception of weight. The final perception of a type design is the image in the mind of the reader, as Adrian Frutiger once said. And so it is with type weight, too. Numbers are essential in practical typography, but ultimately the typographic designer’s goal is to create an image in the mind of the reader, and that is still a difficult and mysterious task. That is why experienced and altruistic typographers are needed to assess the visual impressions of typographic compositions. To envision the experience of the reader and estimate the legibility of text, designers are not always right, nor are weight calculation invariably accurate, but designers and engineers must do their best for readers. As renowned Swiss typography teacher Emil Ruder wrote nearly 50 years ago: “Typography has one plain duty before it, and that is to convey information in writing.” And he wrote this warning: “There is a standing temptation for the typographer to use his type primarily as a tone of grey and thus to allot it a purely aesthetic and decorative role. It is a sign of immaturity to use a grey surface or a grey tone as a basis for a design into which the typography has to fit as best it can.”\n\n2. A Short History of Type Weights\n\nDifferences in typeface weight have been recognized and named by printers and typographers for over five centuries. In English typographic terminology, the earliest weight distinction was between the gothic styles called “black-letter” (or “black letter”, “blackletter”) used in early English printing by William Caxton, compared to the roman style, developed in Italy, particularly by Nicolas Jenson in Venice 147-1480, which early English printers called “white-letter” (or “white letter”). Some roman types were slightly lighter or darker than others, and some blackletter types slightly lighter or darker than others, but by and large, blackletters were darker than white-letters- more ink on the page. However, printers’ choices between gothic or roman, blackletter or white-letter, were not motivated by weight but by style.\n\nFor cultural reasons, principally the intellectual and artistic hegemony of Italian Renaissance typographic fashion, roman replaced gothic in several countries over two centuries: in Italy by the late 15th century; in France by the early to-mid 16th century; and in England by the late 16th century, and in the Low Countries, Belgium and Holland, at about the same time as in England, or not long after (except for beer :-).\n\nToday, most readers in the Americas and Europe are accustomed to roman types. Most readers of roman would say it is more legible than gothic, yet gothic remained popular in German speaking countries and regions until the 20th century. Gothic types have survived and in many cases have thrived in several contexts, particularly in beer labels and signs in Flemish, Dutch, and German-speaking countries, and also in Mexico. During the Christmas holiday season, typography in English-speaking countries goes gothic and blackletter, when Old English textura and other styles of English blackletter, like the Burgundian Bâtarde used by Caxton, make their annual comeback. From Thanksgiving to New Year’s day in America, blackletter becomes surprisingly legible to roman type readers. God rest you merry, Gentlemen.\n\nIn the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution gained steam in England, new uses arose for typography in the marketing and advertising of manufactured goods. Typefounders responded by founding more faces for “display” typography, including advertising, posters, handbills, labeling, and ephemera. Among the new promotional type styles were roman faces of heavier weight, surpassing the old gothic blackletters in darkness but still roman in structure. In the vanguard were the so-called “Fat Faces”, which had pronounced thick-thin contrast like Bodoni or Didot designs on steroids. Then came heavy weights with slab-serif faces, the “Antiques” and “Egyptians”, nearly monotonic in stroke thicknesses. Also there were heavy weights of sans-serifs, structurally more like slab-serif faces lacking serifs than roman book faces with the serifs cut off. Related to the Egyptians was a seriffed style called “Ionic”, which had bracketed serifs and a little more contrast between thick and thin than the Egyptians. Following Ionic, the first “Clarendon” typefaces was released in 1845. It was heavy, like many slab-serif faces, but its serifs had bracketing, like Ionic. Clarendon faces began to be used with normal weight roman text faces for headings, emphasis, and other distinctions from the roman text faces. In the early 20th century, typefounders began to integrate bold weights into families of normal weight romans and italics. The Cheltenham and Century families by Morris Fuller Benton for American Typefounders are notable examples.\n\nBy mid-20th century, most new text type families included at least one roman bold weight, and by the late 20th century, most new type families, as well as revivals of older classic faces like Garamond or Baskerville, included two or more bold weights, with names like “semi-bold” and “bold”, or “bold and extra-bold”, with italics of matching weight. In the 21st century, new typeface families often have four or more weight gradations.\n\nTypeface weight names\n\nTypeface weights have mostly been named on the basis of subjective impression, using metaphorical words like “normal, “semi-bold”, “demibold”, “bold”, “extra-bold”, “heavy”, “black”, and so on. Names like these give an ordinal sense of boldness within a type family. Intuitively, “bold” is darker than “semi-bold”, and “extra-bold” is darker than “bold”. However, even after a century of naming bold weights, there is still no standardization between type families, such that the bold of one family will be the same weight as the bold of another family. The “”demibold” of one font family could be heavier than the “bold” of another family. Or not.\n\nTwentieth century German typographic nomenclature included several named weight gradations, including “mager” (thin), “leicht” (light), “buch” (book [weight]), “normal\" (normal), “stark” (strong), “kräftig\" (hefty), \"viertelfett\" (quarter-bold), \"halbfett\" (half-bold), \"dreiviertelfett\" (three-quarter-bold), \"fett\" (bold), and “extrafett” (extra bold). Not all of these were used within a given family. As with English type weight names, there was no standard of use of the German weight names between families. These were, and still are, impressionistic, not numerically calibrated weights.\n\nFat. The German type weight terms were borrowed from common items, especially edibles and particularly dairy products. “Dreiviertelfett” in German is used of margarine, cheese, and other items containing fat or weight, and also of typefaces with visual weight (e.g. Venus, Folio, Futura. Viertelfett was used of cheese, margarine, and typefaces (e.g. Helvetica). Halbfett also of cheese, margarine, typefaces (e.g. Helvetica, Neuzeit, Optima, Palatino, etc.). Extrafett could describe creams as well as typefaces (e.g. Syntax, Folio, Helvetica, etc.).\n\nIn traditional French typographic nomenclature, weight locutions are similar. “Graisse”, meaning “fatness” in general, is equivalent to English “weight” in type terms, and the weight gamut includes several terms based on the adjective “gras” for fat: “maigre” (thin), “normal” (normal), “demi-gras” (demibold), “gras” (bold), “extra-gras” (extra bold). There appears to be some shifting in recent years, so perhaps our French colleagues will let us know the latest.\n\nIt may seem odd to equate the amount of black in a typeface with the amount of fat in a cheese, but once we take into account traditional printers’ anthropomorphic terminology in talking about a type “face” or “body”, then the metaphor between “weight” on a type and weight on a person seems natural.\n\nBut, typeface weight is not necessarily based on fat. In Italian, from which we get wonderful terms of art like “chiaroscuro”, typographic weight names denoted grades of light and dark, like “chiaro” (light), “neretto” (bold), “nero” (black), “nerissimo” (ultrablack).\n\nUnivers decimal weights. In his Univers typeface family, launched in 1957 and designed for universal use in many countries, Adrian Frutiger broke with traditional weight names, which vary from language to language, and devised a two-digit decimal system of naming for consistency across languages, cultures, and nations. In Univers, light roman weight is designated “45”, normal “55”, bold “65”, black “75”, and extra black “85”. Nearly two decades later, the Frutiger family was launched with the same designation system, adding “95” as ultra black. Linotype launched the Neue Helvetica family using the same system, in which “25” designates ultra light, “35” thin, and “95” black. In Univers Next, launched in 1997, the weight gamut and decimal numbering system were extend with an additional digit, “130” became ultralight, “230” thin, “330” light, “430” basic, “530” medium, “630” bold, “730” heavy, “830” black, and “930” extra black. For typographers accustomed to the earlier two-digit naming, the three-digit system requires some extra learning. Neue Frutiger, launched in 1999, and Frutiger Next in 2000 did not continue the decimal nomenclature.\n\nNormalcy. There is no standard for “normal” weight, that which would be used for running text in books, magazines, newspapers, or on digital screens of computers, tablets, phones, watches, e-books, automotive displays, and other electronic texts.\n\n“Normal” weights nonetheless fall into a fairly narrow range. For Latin typefaces, their “black” coverage ranges between 15% to around 22%, as measured by the black area (ink or pixels) of the letters within the white area surrounding and inside the letters at their nominal body size, with no leading or extra line spacing.\n\nFor old-style seriffed book faces like Garamond and Caslon, the black percentage is around 16%, give or take a few percent. For 20th century sans-serifs, such as Helvetica or Lucida, and for recent fonts designed for screen display, which tend to have bigger x-heights and heavier thin strokes, the normal weights tend to be darker, around 20%-22% black, give or take a few percent. Old-style book faces were designed for letterpress printing, which deposits more ink on paper and thickens the image though ink-squash around the edges of characters, so letterpress printed texts are slightly darker than modern outline renderings of the fonts would indicate. Some modern sans-serif faces, which became popular in offset lithographic printing are darker than the classical book faces because their slightly heavier weights were not attenuated by the thinner ink films and slight attenuation of lithographic rendering.\n\nDepending on imaging technology and anti-aliasing algorithms, typefaces on screen displays may be slightly darkened or lightened. For example, on brightly back-lighted high-resolution digital displays, it may be necessary to darken a typeface slightly in order to make it look more like its printed rendering. When Apple moved to “Retina” displays, which on laptops have resolutions of 220 pixels per inch instead of the old CRT resolutions around 72 pixels per inch, Bigelow & Holmes created a slightly darker Lucida Grande Bold weight for Retina displays. The new bold weight was only 4% darker than the old, but that was enough to restore the apparent degree of “boldness”.\n\nBoldness. Just as there is no standard for “normal” weight across typeface families, there is no standard for “bold” weight. Within a typeface family, boldness is relative to “normal” weight. As seen in the table above, boldness can be expressed as a percentage of gray tone or as a ratio between stem thicknesses, or as a visual judgment.\n\nRelated to findings in the psychophysics of sensory quantities like physical weight, brightness, or loudness, differences in typeface “boldness” seem to follow a progression based on a multiplicative factor. For many typefaces, the minimum factor for the difference between normal and bold weight is around 1.3 to 1.5, depending on method of measurement. Measured by ratio of stem thickness to x-height, the minimum step for a noticeably bold weight is a factor around 1.5 times the normal stem/x-height. That is, if the normal weight stem is a unit of 1.0, then the bold is around 1.5 units. The next major step in weight, say between bold and black, is roughly 1.5 times the bold, or between 2.0 times the weight of “normal” to around 2.25 times the normal stem thickness.\n\nDesigners may prefer a greater degrees of boldness, to make sure it is noticeably more emphatic than normal, but not so bold that it is distracting in text.\n\nUsing the stem/x-height ratio, Lucida Grande Bold is 1.5 x Lucida Grande regular. Palatino Bold is 1.54 x Palatino normal. Arial Bold is 1.6 times x Arial regular. Times Roman Bold is 1.7 x Times Roman normal. Baskerville Bold is 1.8 x Baskerville normal (depending on version of Baskerville). Verdana Bold is 1.9 x Verdana regular. Microsoft’s ClearType fonts, designed for improved screen display technology, tend to have bold weights between 1.5 to 1.7 times the respective normal weights.\n\nIf we switch from measurements based on stem/x-height ratios to black-to-white coverage based on black/white pixel percentages, measure is a bit more complicated (no pun intended) but gives results in decimal percentages.\n\nTonal values measured as pixel percentages show a lesser factor of increase. For example, Lucida Lite (Light) weight is 25% lighter than the Normal weight, in both stem/x-height ratio and in black pixel percentage, but in the progression from normal to blacker weights, the Bold weight is only 28% darker than the normal weight, not 50%, and the Black weight is only 37% darker than the Normal weight, not 100%. The exact percentages are influenced by the structure of the design, the x-height, the details of terminals and serifs, the letter fitting, and other factors determined by type designers.\n\nDefinitely bolder versus just noticeably bolder. As discussed above, weights that are“definitely bolder” than normal weight are around 1.5 times normal to 1.3 times normal, depending on the kind of measurement. What about the “just-noticeable difference” or JND used by psychophysicists? How small a difference in typeface weight is just barely noticeable to users or readers? In a small scale study we found that the just-noticeable weight difference for a lower-case sans serif typeface was approximately 3%. Some subjects didn’t detect that small a difference, but more of them did. This accords fairly well with our industrial experience. When our studio developed a minimally darker “bold” weight of Lucida Grande for Macintosh “Retina” displays, the increased darkness was roughly 4%. The small weight increase was just enough that interface designers could notice and prefer the difference, but not so much that average users noticed anything amiss.\n\nA just-noticeable difference is a percept with little or no contextual meaning, being barely detectable, but a definitely noticeable difference carries semantic weight; it distinguishes one sort of text from another, emphasizes a meaning, denotes a definition, keys a topic, indexes a list or a table. Therefore, typographers and interface designers want that difference to be noticeable. In practical typography, type size is another dimension of noticeability, so when a typographer wants something to be clearly more than definitely different, bigger sizes is compounded with bolder weight.\n\nIn summary: what do we know?\n\nDo we know what type weight is the ideal “normal”? No.\n\nDo we know what weight is the ideal “bold”? No.\n\nDo we know how many weights can be used for all desired shades of authorial meaning while enabling readers to understand all the differences? No.\n\nDo we know which design ideology should be our sole guide? Not hardly, as John Wayne would say.\n\nAll these questions must still be determined by context, experiment, visual judgment, analysis and intuition. Weight numbers definitely help, and they are getting better the more we study them, but so far, they remain at best, signs on the road to understanding, not our destination.\n\nBigelow & Holmes\n\nNote: We are grateful to Rolf Rehe for his helpful and amusing comments on the “fett” adjectives in everyday and typographic German.\n\n© 2015\n\nNote: This essay was originally published in 1989 in Fine Print: The Review for the Arts of the Book. In the intervening quarter-century, vast terrains of typography have shifted from print to screen, and many “books” are now read on digital displays, not in print. We can no longer limit typography discussions to the art of the book; we have to consider the art of typography in both analog and digital, print and screen. For that reason, in 2012, I organized a symposium at Rochester Institute of Technology on \"Reading Digital\", to review the science, technology, art, and design of reading and typography in the digital realm.\n\nBut, this essay was written 23 years earlier. Looking back on it, I see that some of my views have changed over time because of new media, new knowledge, or new interpretations of old knowledge, but the basic distinctions are, I believe, still the same; the shift to digital typography has not changed them.\n\nThe parts about vision science could and certainly should be updated because research on vision and reading has made considerable progress since the 1980s. Reading scientists have found out more about the visual processes underlying reading, and some recent findings are intriguing as well as relevant to typography.\n\nI think it is safe to say, however, that we don't understand much more about the art of typography than we did 25 years ago, or 80 years ago, or, come to think of it, 500 years ago. Jan Tschichold, who created brilliant typography as a modernist and followed it with brilliant typography as a classicist, showed us that.\n\nTo rewrite this out-of-print essay to include newer technological and scientific developments would probably require a book length disquisition, so I am making it available as-it-was but in digital form for reading on screen instead of in print. This blog version contains the original text, footnotes, and references, but, for now, lacks the illustrations, although the image captions are present. The original composition for print was in Lucida Bright, a new type at the time, but here the text is composed in Lucida Grande (or whatever font one's browser substitutes). The original footnotes are marked by numbers in parentheses, e.g. (1), in the main body of text, and listed by number at the end of the essay.\n\nFORM, PATTERN & TEXTURE IN THE TYPOGRAPHIC IMAGE\n\nby Charles Bigelow\n\nIN HER FAMOUS ESSAY, \"The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should Be Invisible,\" Beatrice Warde argues that typography is not an art.\n\n\"Type well used is invisible as type . . . . That is why it is mischievous to call any printed piece a work of art, especially fine art: because that would imply that its first purpose was to exist as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for the delectation of the senses. . . . . printing in English will not qualify as an art until the present English language no longer conveys ideas to future generations and until printing itself hands its usefulness to some yet unimagined successor.\" (1)\n\nIn a less-known but no less important essay, \"Clay in the Potter's Hand,\" Jan Tschichold argues that typography is an art:\n\n“Decisions on matters of higher typography, such as in a title page, need a really highly developed taste, related to what is needed in creative art. They may produce forms which are quite as perfect as good painting or sculpture. From the experts they should receive even more respect since the typographer is more strictly bound than any other artist by the unchangeable wording of the material before him. None but a master can call the dead leaden letters to true life.\n\nPerfect typography is certainly the most elusive of all arts. Out of stiff, unconnected little parts a whole must be shaped which is alive and convincing as a whole. Sculpture in stone alone comes near in its obstinacy to perfect typography. For most people it offers no special aesthetic charm as it is as difficult of access as the highest music . . . .” (2)\n\nWarde bases her argument on pragmatics: because typography is useful, because it conveys ideas, it cannot be art, for art is, by implication, aesthetic and sensual rather than utilitarian and rational. Tschichold bases his argument on sophistication, in the sense of complexity or refinement: because typography can be as developed, perfect, difficult, and elusive as the fine arts, it must be an art itself.\n\nIn claiming that the typographic whole is constructed from elementary parts, that it is greater than the sum of its parts, and that it can be alive, Tschichold is espousing \"holism,\" a philosophy which asserts that complex systems exhibit emergent characteristics that cannot be predicted from knowledge of their components - simply put, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - and \"vitalism,\" a relative of holism, which says that a certain kind of complex system possesses a vital, living essence that does not exist in its constituent parts.\n\nTypography is a complex system which comprises type­ faces, which in turn comprise alphabets, which in turn comprise letters, all of which may be selected, combined, and arranged according to many different principles in a vast number of ways. The perceptual effect of a typographic work cannot, according to a holistic view, be deduced from simple knowledge of the individual letterforms.\n\nWhat Warde and Tschichold both are trying to do in these apparently contradictory essays is to define and understand the aesthetic principles of typography. They both observe that most readers do not notice good typography. Nevertheless, because printed text is a dominant visual experience of modern civilization, those readers will spend hours a day and years in a lifetime viewing printed pages.\n\nTherefore the principles that govern the typographic image are potentially important to everyone who works with printed texts - writers, editors, publishers, teachers, librarians, and bibliophiles - as well as to the printing historians and typographic designers who scrutinize type pages with professional eyes.\n\nIn this essay we examine two fundamental typographic principles, size and combination, and show that out of their interaction emerge three qualitative levels of the typographic image: form, pattern, and texture.\n\nSIZE\n\nVARIATION OF SIZE within a text is one of typography's signal contributions to the art of literacy. Size variation was not unknown before typography - it can be found in Latin and Greek alphabetic manuscripts, Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions, and Chinese logographic brush writing and block printing, but it has developed in typography to a greater degree than in those chirographic, epigraphic, or xylographic traditions.\n\nMultiple sizes of type in a text are not strictly necessary, either for sense - typewritten texts composed in a single size of type have served authors, editors, teachers and students well for over a century - or for beauty - certain incunabula composed only in one size of type are still regarded as paragons of typography. Yet, variation of type size makes text clearer, more dynamic, and more engaging. Size variation is a mainstay of typographic design. Without it, the modern book would be dull, and the modern newspaper impossible.\n\nSize is so important to typography that the creation of a spectrum of different sizes of type occupied the careers of the greatest punchcutters of the golden age of typography. After Claude Garamond cut his first definitive romans, like the St. Augustin size (approximately 14 point) in Jacques DuBois' In Linguam Gallicam Isagoge printed by Robert Estienne in 1531, three generations of punchcutters labored to create additional sizes in Garamond's idiom. The Konrad Berner Foundry type specimen of 1592 shows the Garamond style of roman face available in a series of sizes from Canon (approximately 48 point) to Nonpareil (approximately 6 point), cut variously by Garamond himself, Robert Granjon, Pierre Haultin, and Jacques Sabon. Christopher Plantin's folio type specimen of 1585 shows a similar range by most of the same hands, with yet larger sizes of roman by Hendrik van den Keere (though in a style noticeably different from Garamond's). Toward the end of the sixteenth century, Guillaume Le Be I and Jacques de Sanlecque also cut sizes of roman in the Garamond style. Moreover, Granjon in his long and prolific career cut many sizes of italic faces in his own distinctive styles, examples of which are also shown in the Berner and Plantin specimens. (3)\n\nIMAGE The Konrad Berner type specimen, Frankfurt, 1592.\n\nWhy is size so useful? Tschichold's comparison of typography to music suggests analogies that may illuminate the role of size in typography. Large letters are used for emphasis in text, as loud notes are used for emphasis in music or loud voices in conversation. Hence, size in type is somewhat like loudness or dynamics in music. Just as different parts of a musical composition are loud or soft (in musician's terms, forte or piano) different parts of a text are large or small.\n\nType size is more closely analogous to musical pitch, but in a spatial rather than a temporal dimension. (f) In typography, spatial frequency is the number of black and white alternations per unit of distance, just as musical frequency is the number of acoustic vibrations per unit of time. In a given length of line, a small size of type fits more letters, and hence more alternations of black stems with white counters and spaces, than does a large size; hence, smaller type has a higher spatial frequency.\n\nIMAGE minimum chains at different sizes\n\nA typeface that is available in a range of sizes is like a musical instrument which can produce a scale of notes of different pitch. A typographic composition that includes different type sizes thus comprises \"notes\" of different visual pitch, just as a musical composition comprises notes of different audible pitch. When a reader views a whole page, different type sizes are perceived simultaneously, thus constituting a kind of spatial harmony; when one reads a linear text, the types are perceived sequentially, thus constituting a kind of spatial melody.\n\nAn analogy can also be drawn between the visual qualities of the typographic notes produced by a typeface, and musical \"timbre.\" Typographic timbre is a complex visual sensation resulting from the interaction of the proportions, details, and spacing of the typeforms, just as musical timbre is a complex acoustic sensation that results from the sum of the harmonics (partials or overtones) produced by the shape and design of an instrument. A typeface family that includes related variations, such as roman, italic, and bold (and perhaps sans-serif as well) permits the typographer to adjust visual timbre somewhat independently of spatial frequency or size. (4)\n\nA concept related to size is \"scale.\" A scale is a fixed series of measures, and hence to scale type is to enlarge or reduce it. When scaling leaves letter proportions unchanged, it is termed \"linear.\" Linear scaling is standard in photographic and digital typography. Opposed to linear scale is non-linear or optical scale, adapted to the eye rather than the machine. Harry Carter, in \"The Optical Scale in Typefounding,\" demonstrates that the traditional proportions of typeforms differ according to whether type is large, medium, or small. In particular, he shows that type designed for a small scale tends to be wider, have a larger x­ height, thicker hairlines, and more exaggerated serifs, joins, and terminals than type for a large scale. (5)\n\nIMAGE Times Roman fonts of different design sizes, scaled to\n\nsame x-height to show proportional changes according to scale.\n\nSimilarly, Daniel Berkeley Updike observes that, \"A design for a type alphabet that may be entirely successful for the size for which it is drawn, cannot be successfully applied to all other sizes of the same series. Each size is a law unto itself . . .\" (6)\n\nTraditional punchcutters and scribes made such proportional changes in order to optimize legibility. Recent research in visual perception suggests that such proportional changes are necessary because the human visual system has non-linear sensitivity to visual features of different spatial frequencies. (7)\n\nToday, photographic and computer techniques can render almost any size of type with ease and precision. Type size has become a continuum instead of a sparse series of fixed sizes and proportions. Because innumerable fine gradations of size are now possible, the typographer must strive to understand the principles that govern the appearance of types at all sizes.\n\nThe range of sizes in text is commonly divided into three main scales: large, medium, and small. (8) These refer to apparent size more than physical size. Apparently small type may be physically small, e.g., 6 point type in a newspaper classified advertisement read at a distance of twelve inches, or physically large, e.g., two-foot high type on a bill­board read at a distance of ninety-six yards, but both appear to be the same size because they subtend the same degree of visual angle at the retina of the eye. {0.3 degrees of visual angle} (type size = 1/144 of distance)\n\nIn general, large scale type is used for the display of particular words or phrases, as in titles; medium scale for the main or body text, and small scale for reference text, like footnotes in books or classified advertising in newspapers. However, the actual sizes depend on context. In a book, the medium scale text may be composed in 12 point and small scale footnotes in 9 point, whereas in a newspaper, the medium scale text may be in 9 point and the small scale classified advertising in 6 point. (8)\n\nThe textual significance of a given size of type is based on relative scale - the relationship of a given size of type to the other sizes of type on the page. For example, a small amount of large type positioned above a large amount of smaller type usually marks the former as a title or heading for the latter, whatever their actual sizes may be. Relative scale has meaning, whereas absolute size is merely a physical fact.\n\nCOMBINATION\n\nIN TEXT COMPOSITION, size is always associated with another fundamental typographic principle, combination, as a direct consequence of the nature of language.\n\nAs a medium of communication, typography is twice removed from its content. At the first remove, writing is a visual representation of language, and at the second, typography is an industrialized representation of writing. To the reader, the letters that compose a text are recognized in passing but are not themselves objects of contemplation; rather, the words, and behind them, the ideas expressed by the text are of primary interest. As if to acknowledge these two aspects, the word \"text\" has dual meanings. First it is the printed artifact - the perceptual object, and second it is the linguistic construction - the conceptual object. Although text is used mainly in the latter sense today, its etymology suggests the former, as the modern word is derived from Latin textus, a weaving, referring to the woven pattern created by written letters arrayed on a page. (9)\n\nIMAGE Text composed in type based on the Textura script, so named because of its woven appearance. From the Gutenberg Bible, c. 1455, the first European book printed from movable type.\n\nBecause the art of weaving involves the creation of a two­ dimensional fabric from a one-dimensional thread, an obvious analogy with typography can be drawn, for speech is a one-dimensional string in time woven by typography into a two-dimensional plane in space. As the revolutionary Russian typographer El Lissitzky observed, \"We have two dimensions for the word. As a sound it is a function of time, and as a representation it is a function of space.\" (10)\n\nTypographic weaving is composition, the repetition and recombination of a small number of letterforms into strings and the assembly of those strings into masses of text. It reflects what the French linguist André Martinet has called the \"double articulation\" of language. (\"Articulation\" here being itself a double entendre, meaning both segmentation into components and pronunciation.) Though apparently of infinite variety, the utterances of a language are constructed from a finite set of meaningful segments - words or \"morphemes\" - which constitute the first articulation. The words themselves are constructed from a much smaller set of sound units - \"phonemes\" - which constitute the second articulation. A language may contain myriads of words but will have fewer than a hundred distinct sounds (English, for example, has some forty-five phonemes {and some 250,000 words}. Since there are so few individual phonemes in relation to the large number of words, each phoneme is repeated many times in many combinations. (11)\n\nTo represent language in a graphic medium, typography likewise utilizes the repetition and recombination of elements. In alphabetic typography, the graphic signs or \"graphemes\" are letters. In logographic typography (used for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in varying degrees) the graphemes are characters. Individual letters signify sounds or phonemes, the second articulation, and combinations of letters (or single characters in a logographic script) signify words or morphemes, the first articulation. As is true for the phoneme, the single letter generally has no meaning by itself; its significance lies in its differentiation from the other letters, and its combinations with them to produce higher-level meaningful segments.\n\nTHE TYPOGRAPHIC IMAGE\n\nTHE INTERACTION of size and combination creates three levels of the typographic image: form, pattern, and texture. Each level contains a range of sizes in varying degrees of combinatory complexity. Although size is a quantitative aspect of type, the emergent levels of the typographic image are qualitative.\n\nForm\n\nThe design of a letter is a study in form. The letterform is a dualistic rendering: black and white, intaglio and relief, figure and ground, on and off. The contour that separates and defines the polarities of the letter image creates the interaction between letterform and counterform, interior and exterior, positive and negative space. The resultant perception includes lines, such as fair curves, straight edges, smooth joins, and sharp corners, as well as shapes, such as solid regions, empty hollows, delicate taperings, and abrupt ter­minations.\n\nIMAGE: Lucida Bright lower-case a\n\nAt the level of form, the letter is viewed at a large scale. In the large letter, interior area dominates contour line because of a geometrical relationship known to the Greeks: the area of a form increases in proportion to the square of the size, whereas the length of the contour that defines the form increases in direct proportion to the size. When a letter is large, the area of the interior is large in proportion to the line of the contour, and much of that region is relatively far from the contour. Hence, the mass (or void) tends to dominate the image. However, this tendency is partly counteracted by mechanisms in the human visual system, such as lateral inhibition, that extract edges from images and de-emphasize monotonous surfaces. (12)\n\nAt its largest perceptual size, the letterform is isolated. Extracted from the context of the alphabetic system, the iso­lated letter becomes an object of contemplation, not mean­ ing. It is pure form, its semiological role vacated because alone the letter has no significance. It is an abstraction. As Eric Gill wrote, \"Letters are not pictures or representations. They are more or less abstract forms.\" (13)\n\nForm invites abstract analysis. Renaissance humanists and artists analyzed the shapes of letterforms with the com­pass and straightedge of Euclidean geometry.\n\nIMAGE Capital Q letter construction by Sigismondo Fanti Theorica et practica ... de modo scribendi fabricandique omnes literarum species, Venice, 1514.\n\nEnlightenment academicians used the grids of Cartesian geometry. Today's computer scientists use the mathematical formulae of splines and conic curves.\n\nBecause letterforms can easily be scaled to any size by modern typographic technology, the finest details of the forms, formerly examined only by experts, can now be appreciated by everyone. The letter under the lens of photographic and digital typography is like the work of art under the lens of the camera, as discussed by Andre Malraux in The Voices of Silence:\n\n“In an album or art book the illustrations tend to be of much the same size. Thus works of art lose their relative proportions; a miniature bulks as large as a full-size picture, a tapestry or a stained-glass window . . . In this way reproduction frees a style from the limitations which made it appear to be a minor art.”\n\n“Indeed, reproduction (like the art of fiction, which subdues reality to the imagination) has created what might be called \"fictitious\" arts, by systematically falsify­ing the scale of objects; by presenting oriental seals the same size as the decorative reliefs on pillars and amulets like statues . . . Sometimes the reproductions of minor works suggest to us great styles which have passed away - or which \"might have been.\" “ (14)\n\nAt a large scale, the letterform ceases to be a minor art, and takes its place with the forms of painting, sculpture, and even architecture as objects of study and contemplation. The letter as form is displayed, as Beatrice Warde said above, \"as an expression of beauty for its own sake and for the delectation of the senses.\"\n\nThe effect that the forms of letters will produce when combined into text is often impossible to predict because many of the characteristics of an alphabet design emerge only en masse. The next level of the typographic image, the level of forms in combination, is the level of pattern.\n\nPattern\n\nCombined into words and lines of text, the forms and coun­terforms of individual letters become elements of a periodic structure. The shapes of stems, bowls, serifs, and other features of a letter relate to similar features of other letters, as the forms of counters inside a letter relate to the counters of other letters and to the spaces between letters. Because there are only a few different letterforms in an alphabet, each form is repeated many times in many combinations, and the relationships between forms and counterforms extend beyond near neighbors to entire lines and columns. The sum of these relationships is a pattern.\n\nThe level of pattern occurs at a medium scale, where the interior area of a form no longer dominates the contour line. Instead, these two different aspects of a geometric figure tend toward equilibrium. Because much of the interior area of a form lies close to the contour, the interaction of contours with areas, edges with surfaces, gives the text image an active quality.\n\nA text pattern is complex because it results not only from the repetition of whole letters, but also of letter parts. Letters are constructed from more primitive graphic elements. In handwriting, these elements are kinesthetic movements - gestures and strokes - which leave graphic traces; in type design, they are graphic features which can be consistently combined, such as stems, bowls, diagonals, cross­ bars, hairlines, joins , serifs, and terminals. Because the letters share a small number of elemental features, the structure of the text pattern is derived from symmetries and transformations of repeating letter parts as well as from repetitions of fully formed letters.\n\nThis constructive, systematic nature of typefaces is a result of the formal interactions of the letters during a long, common history. The development of the alphabet shows a transformation of originally iconic or pictorial signs, linked by relationships of resemblance to the objects signified, into abstract, symbolic shapes which have stronger formal linkages to each other than to the things they signify. The alphabet represents a system of sounds, not a collection of isolated entities, and thus no letter exists in isolation. Graphically, each letter must be unique in order to carry its particular significance, but it must also be fashionable by the same means as the others, writable by the same hands and tools, constructible from the same elements.\n\nPattern begins with the word and comes to full flower in the line and column. The line of type is a one-dimensional pattern, like a frieze, based on the repetition of geometric figures in a line. For efficient packing, the continuous line of type is cut into segments which are arrayed in columns, creating a two-dimensional type page which, like wallpapers, tilings, and fabrics, is based on repetition in a plane. This structural relationship of type to pattern has been familiar to typographers for centuries. Robert Granjon in the sixteenth century and Pierre Simon Fournier in the eighteenth excelled in the creation of floral forms or fleurons that could be combined into ornamental patterns to accompany their typeforms combined into text. (15)\n\nIMAGE Page of prospectus designed by Jan Tschichold, 1947. The individual forms of the large capitals are evident, and the beginnings of pat­ terns are seen in the word combinations. The lines of smaller capitals exhibit stronger patterns, while the individual forms are less evident.\n\nThe patterns that emerge from text are nevertheless different from those of ornamental friezes and tilings because the latter, though often beautiful and intricate, convey relatively little information despite multiplicity of forms. The mathematical principles that govern the tiling of the plane make it possible to predict exactly when and where a given geometric element will occur in a pattern. Hence, there is little new information derived from each repetition of the pattern. (16)\n\nIMAGE Granjon arabesque.\n\nA third dimension of pattern is found in the codex form of book, which, like a crystal, is composed of parallel text planes in space. The codex book is, however, a cognitive more than a visual structure, since it relies on the reader's memory of the patterns on successive pages rather than on simultaneous perception of them. The third dimension of book structure is often emphasized in modern books created as art objects or experiments.\n\nSo-called \"hyper-texts,\" used for reading and accessing complex computer data bases, have structures that rely on the computer's memory to keep track of page sequence, which can be arbitrarily complex and convoluted, and seldom follows the regular, linear sequencing of the codex. Yet, so far, the basic designs of the typographic pages of hyper-texts remain repetitive and book-like.\n\nTypographic tilings are only partially predictable. The periodicity of a typographic pattern is approximate rather than exact, flexible rather than rigid, surprising rather than predictable, because the text constantly changes. The occurrence of a given letter or word space in a particular position is determined not by rules of geometry but by rules of language and the idiosyncratic choices of an author. (17)\n\nThe pattern made by a typeface is greatly influenced by the amount and distribution of space between lines and between letters. The typical text column makes a striped pattern which the typographer can augment or diminish by using more or less leading - interline spacing. Within the line, visually even letterspacing is often held to be ideal. A regular spatial frequency of alternating dark stems and white spaces creates a smooth rhythm with a look of stability and repose. Techniques for the regular spacing of capitals have been described by Tschichold and for the even fitting of lower case by Walter Tracy. (18)\n\nPerfectly even spacing is difficult to achieve in practice because the arbitrary shapes of letters inevitably cause some degree of irregularity of fitting in standard typographic technology. Not all letter combinations seem equally spaced. But some degree of irregularity in letterforms and spacing may be preferable to monotonous regularity, just as in music, slight inharmonicity of partials, or overtones, cre­ates the complex, wavering quality that makes a piano tone \"warm,\" whereas precisely harmonic partials produce bland sounds. (19)\n\nIn contemporary advertising typography, the unstable, restless patterns of tight letterspacing are preferred. The busy, frenetic effect of so-called \"sexy\" spacing, in which the letters tend to rub up against each other, are common in the typography of mass market persuasion, where arresting, staccato patterns draw the reader's attention to texts that might otherwise be ignored.\n\nTight packing of letters also magnifies the logographic aspect of typography. Reduction of space between letters within a word emphasizes by contrast the space between words, thus articulating the text into an archipelago of word islands, rather than continuous strings of letters. The semi­-crystalline lattice of letters on the page is thus interrupted by holes, but holes that have a purpose and meaning. In typography, the word space has developed as a representation of a psychological rather than an acoustic reality, since there are rarely gaps or pauses between words in continuous speech. (20) The importance of the blank space as a logo­graphic mark in English text is indicated by its frequency, greater than e, the most frequent letter.\n\nFurther, close letterspacing creates characteristic word images by emphasizing the irregularity of a given sequence of features in a word, thus distinguishing its shape from that of other words. By subdividing the letter pattern into characteristic chunks and gaps instead of a continuous flow, alphabetic typography takes on some of the qualities of logographic Chinese writing.\n\nTexture\n\nThe realm of texture is the habitat par excellence of the serious reader, where the text reaches its greatest mass and density and the ultimate visual qualities of the literate image emerge. At the level of texture, line dominates area; forms are obscured; patterns become aggregates. Small, the letters are seen as though at a distance, through an intervening atmosphere, resembling more the attenuated figures sculpted by Alberto Giacometti than the forms and volumes shaped by Henry Moore.\n\nWhen letters are seen at a small size, it is difficult if not impossible to discern the exact forms of fine features such as serifs, joins, and terminals, though these are obvious at a large size. Linearity replaces interiority. The area of the interior of the small letter is small compared to the length of the contour, and most of the interior area lies along the contour. At the level of texture, the letter is mainly line, an aspect intensified by the edge-detection mechanisms of the human visual system. Textures are complexes of edges.\n\nPatterns evident at a medium scale become so dense at the small scale that statistical qualities emerge; the density or \"color\" of the text, its granularity, and its weave can be seen directly. Out of the myriad interactions of features and spaces, texture emerges. That a basic quality of the text emerges from multiplicity was known both to traditional and to modern typefounders. Pierre Simon Fournier observes in his Manuel Typographique:\n\nOne letter measured singly may seem neither appreciably too big nor too small, but ten thousand composed into printed matter repeat the error ten thousand times over, and, be this never so small, the effect will be the opposite of what was intended. The same trouble also occurs when a stroke is made either too thick or too thin relative to its length, which makes a letter look clumsy and faulty, with­ out the reason for it being always easy to find out. (21)\n\nChauncey Griffith, designer of twentieth-century news faces, found the ready analogy between textiles and text typography:\n\n“But the individual piece of type is like a thread. A single thread might be dyed crimson, scarlet, or pink and the human eye would find the difference hard or impossible to detect. But once that thread is woven into cloth, the color is very apparent. So type must be judged after it is woven into the texture of a paragraph or a page.” (22)\n\nAlthough the level of texture is where most reading takes place, the vocabulary of texture is the least developed of the three levels of the typographic image. At the level of form, terms like line, space, and mass, commonly applied to draw­ ing, painting, and sculpture, can equally apply to type. At the level of pattern, notions of symmetry, homology, and periodicity, commonly applied to tessellations and mosaics, can also apply to type. But at the level of texture, few standard terms are available. Typographers use , \"color\" for achromatic density - the darkness or lightness - of printed text, or a few ad hoc expressions like \"spikey,\" \"wormy,\" or \"stolid,\" depending on one's feeling for metaphor. In the realm of texture, poets may need to come to the aid of printers by providing words to describe the images of the \"black art.\"\n\nOne memorable observation on typographic texture was made by Heinz Peyer, a Swiss poet, who said that reading a text composed in Helvetica was like walking through a field of stones, whereas reading a text in Syntax was like walking through a field of flowers. (23)\n\nForm is often susceptible to logical analysis, and pattern somewhat so, but texture evades precise description because its repetitions are so numerous, its features so small, and its interactions so refined, that the multifarious complexity of the emergent image resists orderly analysis. Texture requires a holistic more than an analytic under­ standing. This is an aspect of a deeper and larger philosophical difficulty stated by Pascal in his famous comparison of the intuitive mind to the geometrical mind:\n\nThese (principles) can be seen only with difficulty, they are sensed more than seen, and it is infinitely difficult to make them known to those who do not sense them for themselves. These things are so delicate and so numerous that a sense of great delicacy and precision is necessary to perceive them and to judge correctly and accurately from the perception, and in most cases it is not possible to prove the judgment logically as in geometry, because not all the necessary principles are available and it would be an infinite undertaking to gather them. It is necessary to see the whole thing all at once, in a single glance, and not by progressive reasoning . . . (24)\n\nAs a consequence of the complexity and refinement of texture, psycho-physical and mathematical studies of its perception have used statistical analyses and formalized notions of clustering, orientation, and brightness. However, the visual elements and arrangements used in such perceptual studies are simple compared to the complexity of let­terforms in actual text, and hence such studies, though suggestive, have so far been minimally relevant to typography. (25)\n\nFor various purposes, typefounders, telegraphers, cryptographers, and information theorists have made statistical measures of the frequencies of letters and letter combinations in various languages. (26)\n\nWhen coupled with knowledge of the forms of the letters, such statistics can partially indicate texture. For example, Updike notes that differences in letter frequencies change the appearance of a type page. He favorably compares Latin text, with its frequent u's, m's, and n's, infrequent diagonally stroked y's, and infrequent descenders, to English text, with its greater frequency of diagonals and descenders. (27)\n\nUpdike's personal preference for the texture of Latin was, however, a matter of taste more than objective judgment. The letter frequencies of Latin and English actually seem rather similar when compared to those of non-Indo-European languages. Had Updike broadened his literary horizons beyond Europe and New England to native American texts published by his contemporary Franz Boas, he might have noticed, for example, that literary texts in the Chinookan languages of the Pacific Northwest have a plenitude of diagonals and descenders that the texture of English seems staid, and Latin dull in comparison. (28)\n\nIMAGE Texts in Latin (from Cicero's first oration against Catiline), English (from D. B. Updike's Printing Types), and Clackamas Chinook (from Jacobs' and Howard's Clackamas-Chinook Texts) show different textures resulting from different letter frequencies. Composed in Syntax-Antiqua.\n\n[Below, the same texts are repeated, but in the default text of this blog, usually Lucida Grande.

The charm of the early Italian types has perhaps never been equalled; and the like is true of the Renaissance manuscripts\n\nnugwagimx lga dayaxbt, aga danmax wilxba diqalpxix. luxwan dawax wakayim, luxwan agunax alatxwida, la::niwa ilkalakiya ldimamt. galakim, «adi::! kinikstx nayka. nagalgat adalutk. idmilxam a: :nga wakadacu ikdudina.»\n\nWhen the typographic image is understood to comprise distinct levels of different aesthetic and functional qualities, the opposing arguments of Warde and Tschichold can both be seen to be true. At the level of form, typography is a fine art. Its works are accessible to the aesthetic sensibility of the viewer as well as to the intellectual analyses of the art historian, and its shapes are susceptible, at least to some degree, to the logical analyses of the mathematician and scientist. At the level of texture, typography is a utilitarian craft. Its forms are aesthetically transparent to the reader, and its emergent visual qualities, though obvious to the beholder as a holistic image, are resistant to articulate analysis, as its perceptual workings remain for the most part mysterious to the scientist. Typography as pattern articulates form with texture, presenting a bivalent image - formal yet functional, ornamental yet informational - leading on the one hand toward the isolated shape and on the other toward the emergent image. As a whole, then, typography can be seen both as a tool for thought and as an object of contemplation, a conveyor of sense and a delight to the senses.\n\nNOTES\n\n(1) Beatrice Warde, ''The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should be Invisible,\" in The Crystal Goblet.

Wade Baskin, trans. New York: The Philosophical Library, 1959.\n\nArticulation into words is a notion familiar to typographic literates because words are separated by blank spaces in typography (though they were not so in classical Greek and Latin manuscripts). \"Morpheme \" denotes an elementary meaningful unit of language, which may be a word or a significant part of a word. An English noun such as \"bird\" is a morpheme, as is the plural suffix represent­ ed by the letter \"-s\" in the plural noun \"birds.\" Written morphemes may or may not be separated by word spaces, depending on the orthography of a language. ***\n\n\"Phoneme\" denotes a psychologically distinguishable sound of speech. Unlike a word, a phoneme generally has no meaning in itself; its role is to be different from other phonemes and to make meaning through its interactions and combinations with them. Articulation into phonemes is familiar to readers of alphabetic scripts because many, though not all, phonemes are uniquely represented by a single letter. In English orthography , for example, the letters b, d, p, and t, among others, represent consonantal phonemes. Most orthographies are not, however, perfectly phonemic. English vowel phonemes, as a notorious example, do not have simple, one-to-one correspondences with the letters of written English. {Few languages have more than 100 phonemes, except some of the Africa Khoisan languages which have a rich repertoire of click phonemes.)\n\nFloyd Ratliff , \"Contour and Contrast.\" Scientific American, June, 1972; David H.

It was my great pleasure to contribute to her journal as an associate editor and writer over many years.\n\nThe NY Times Magazine Relaunch\n\nThe New York Times magazine launched a re-design on February 22, 2015. Editor Jake Silverstein discussed the new design in the NY Times on February 18, “Behind the Relaunch of The New York Times Magazine.”\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/behind-the-relaunch-of-the-new-york-times-magazine-by-jake-silverstein.html\n\nThe article mentions new fonts and shows four of them in 2-letter (‘Gg’) samples, asserting, “Not a single letter in this relaunch issue has ever seen the light of day.” Three of the fonts illustrated are primarily display faces: they are used in headlines, subheads, pull-quotes, call-outs, or other short pieces of text, and are set at distinctively bigger sizes than the body text. For example, the new, condensed, bold, slab-serif display face is set at approximately 13 or 14 point, with its x-height around half the body size, at 6.75 points. A new, geometric sans-serif (like great-grand-child of Futura by way of Avant Garde Gothic) is used at text sizes, as small as 6.5 to 7 point with x-height of 3.46 points.\n\n(Throughout this essay, the emphasis is on x-height as the indicator of visual size, rather than body size or font size. The reasons are explained in a paper, \"Does print size matter for reading?\" by Gordon Legge & Charles Bigelow (see reference below). Measuring physical x-height size on paper is easier than measuring body size, which is a little more elusive, comprising ascender + descender length + a “gap” of white space, which may be confusable with inter-line spacing or \"leading\". In what follows, I try to avoid confusion by distinguishing between physical x-height measured on actual type in print, versus x-height ratio or percentage of body size, determined for a given font by dividing its x-height by its body size, using the EM units of the font. For example, if a given font, say Times Roman, has an EM of 1,000 units for its body, and an x-height of 450 units, then its x-height ratio is 0.45 or 45%. To figure out what size that will be on paper, multiply the x-height ratio by the point size of the type. For our Times Roman example, when set at 10 point, it will have an x-height of 4.5 points (10 x .45 = 4.5).)\n\nThe “relaunch” article does not mention or show a sample of the new text font, but as body text, it is by far the dominant font in the magazine. It is what anyone who actually reads the magazine for the articles reads most. I estimate that of approximately 35,000 words in the magazine, at least 95% of them are composed in the text font. In print, the new text font has an x-height of 4.12 points, and body size around 9.5 points. In x-height, that is approximately what Times Roman would look like set at 9.25 to 9.5 point, depending on the version of Times.\n\nShort reason why the relaunch is not more legible than before.\n\nIf you don’t have time to read all this long article, here’s the short answer.\n\nThe text type size in the relaunch is nearly at the “critical print size” threshold where text become harder to read. Studies of the relationship between type size and reading speed show that reading speed slows down substantially when the x-height of the text font falls below the equivalent of 4 points, read at an average distance of 16 inches. For some readers, and under some reading conditions, critical size may be bigger, like 4.5 or 5 points, so text type needs to be correspondingly bigger to maintain legibility. If critical print size is equivalent to an x-height of 4 point, then the size of the new text typeface in the NYT Magazine does not actually fall in the sub-optimal range, but it is close enough to flirt with it. Critical print size may vary among different readers, and if it is bigger for some readers, say 4.5 to 5 point, then a print size of 4 point will fall in the suboptimal range for those readers. The previous text face in the NY Times magazine was slightly bigger in x-height than the new one, so the new one is probably not more legible than the old one.\n\nThe Long Story\n\nIf you have time to read the long story, here is the reasonings, history, science, measurements, and calculations. (Disclosure: In my 30+ years of teaching typography, the most common student comments were that my digressions, side-tracks, and tangents were more interesting than formal lectures, so I’m including plenty of side-courses.)\n\nHow much do we read?\n\nA lot. Denis Pelli, who researches reading and neuroscience at New York University, has observed that someone who has reached the age of 50 has read one billion letters (roughly 200 million words). I estimate that more than 90% of those letters were composed in small sizes in text fonts. The bigger sizes in display fonts are just thin icing on the big cake of a lifetime of reading small text type.\n\nAnalog versus digital\n\nReading, especially among younger readers, has been migrating to electronic devices for the past two decades. An increasing percentage of younger readers are reading news, magazine articles, blogs, tweets, text messages, and books on computers, tablets, and even phones. Older readers, however, formed their reading habits back in the old days when print was king, and are likely to be a large cohort of the loyal subscribers to the New York Times Sunday edition and magazine.\n\nOlder readers and aging eyes.\n\nThe age of readers should be considered in the design of print publications, because readers older than 40 to 50 are afflicted by vision deficits, the most common of which is called “presbyopia” or “far-sightedness”. Presbyopia is a loss of flexibility of the lens of the eye, with consequent difficulty focusing on near objects. It is usually noticed first in reading but also affects other activities like sewing and handwriting that involve seeing small objects up close. Readers can compensate by holding pages farther away, but presbyopia progresses as we age, so eventually, our arms aren’t long enough. Moreover, the farther away a page is held, the smaller the type is optically, until it is too small to read. A common correction for presbyopia is eyeglasses or magnifiers that enlarge the type image and bring it into focus. Other visual impairments and eye diseases like cataracts and macular degeneration also occur more often in the eyes of older readers.\n\nRenaissance printers, readers, and type sizes\n\nExcept for its name (literally, “old man vision”, although women may be affected more than men and at earlier ages), presbyopia is hardly a new discovery. Italian Renaissance printers took it into account in the late 1400s. They used roman type sizes that were roughly 15 to 17 point in today’s measure. Book buyers of that era included humanists, lawyers, bureaucrats, clerics, aristocrats and others who could afford to buy books, often because they had higher incomes from being further along in their careers. Hence, many of them were presumably presbyopic. Accordingly, printers used fonts big enough that their customers could read the text without eyeglasses, which were rare at the time.\n\nIt could be argued that the technology of Renaissance printing wasn’t good enough to cut, cast, and print small sizes of type. While that is plausible, the Venetian printer, Aldus Manutius, provided a counter-example. In 1501, Aldus produced the first portable or pocket books, which by virtue of being smaller were less expensive (paper being a major expense to printers then as now). Smaller size made the books more affordable to a greater number of readers, broadening the market.\n\nFor his small books, Aldus used a new typeface, the first italic ever, cut by Francesco Griffo, a Bolognese punch-cutter who worked for Aldus in Venice. Griffo’s new italic type was cast at roughly 11.3 point, slightly less than 70% of the size of Aldus’ famous roman type, also cut by Griffo, which was around 16.5 point. The Griffo-Aldus italic resembled the fashionably prestigious humanist handwriting of the era, and this association appears to have helped promote sales, so much so that Aldus’ book format and his italic type style were soon plagiarized by other printers, who produced fake Aldine editions.\n\nHumanist hipsterism to Italic handwriting & type\n\nIf wealthier, older readers preferred bigger types in the Italian Renaissance, why did Aldus’ pocket books become so popular? Lower cost is one reason. Cheaper books appealed to younger people, who would probably have had better vision and wouldn’t have been bothered by smaller type size. Another reason is that Aldine portables were the height of humanist style. In 15th century Italy, humanism was as fashionable as modernism was in 20th century Europe and America. To those who may say that modern modernism is, well, more “modern” than humanism, we must point out that in their time, the humanists were modern, and besides, they knew a lot more Latin than modernists today.\n\nAnother factor that may have enabled reading of smaller type is the use of eyeglasses, which were becoming more affordable in the 1500s. With glasses, small type would have been readable even for older readers.\n\nWhat about the common belief that italic type is harder to read than roman? It may be true for today’s readers, but it doesn't seem to have been true in 1501 and for a few decades afterwards. Aldine portable books were composed entirely in italic type, but still they were very popular. The notion that italic is less legible than roman may be due more to cultural preference and familiarity than to basic factors in the visual system. The hip handwriting of the humanists was italic: if you couldn’t write italic, you weren’t cool; probably couldn’t even get a date. Beginning some twenty years after Griffo’s italic for Aldus, popular manuals on how to write italic were published by writing master like Ludovico degli Arrighi and Giovanantonio Tagliente, so everyone who read and practiced could become cool, at least in handwriting. Even Queen Elizabeth I of England wrote a fine italic hand as a young woman. As queen, one of the coolest ever, she had men do that work for her.\n\nSurviving copies of Aldine portables are often elegantly bound and decorated with hand painted ornamentation and rubrication, so despite lower-cost, book buyers obviously valued the little books very highly indeed. A good thing, too, because they are like readable little jewels, pleasures to hold and behold, a tribute to a humanist printer-publisher-promoter and his brilliant type cutter. Of course, to actually read them, there’s that Latin issue again.\n\nImportant numbers, for later use\n\nI will note now, for future reference, that the x-height of the Aldine roman was around 6.85 points, equivalent 0.343 degrees of visual angle. The x-height of the Aldine italic was around 4.72 points, equivalent to 0.236 degrees of visual angle. That 0.236 degrees will be important later, as I will explain.\n\nDisplay types\n\nReturning to the present era, display types, like the ones used in the redesign of the NY Times magazine, are usually set at sizes big enough for readers of any age. Some display types look weird (and at least one of the new fonts doesn’t disappoint in that respect), but perceived weirdness in display typefaces is usually an aesthetic and semiological impression based on cultural expectations, not on basic legibility. Display types are designed to attract, arrest or assault readers’ visual sensibilities, to get people to look at the text. If an odd-looking display type seems hard to read, well, apart from its shock value and “look at me” attitude, it is more for ornamentation than easy reading, and its size is usually big enough to overcome most legibility limitations. Moreover, titles and headlines are normally only a few words or short sentence, so display types evade the problem of uncongeniality in extended reading.\n\nDespite the beliefs of many readers and a surprising number of editors and graphic designers, real weirdness in type lies not in display types at large sizes, where we see pictorial or iconic weirdness: big hulking slabs of font concrete, scribbling sarabands of font ribbons, fuzzy font teddybears, creeping font caterpillars bristling with spines, or sans-serifs which would be dull except for being eaten away by acid like the walking dead of fontology. The sort of stuff young designers love because such monstrosities repulse staid adults. Ha!\n\nSmall text types\n\nNo, true font weirdness is in text types at small sizes. That is where things get non-linear and unpredictable. If permitted to compare the humble world of typography to the lofty realm of physics, small type is to big type as quantum physics is to Newtonian physics. In Newton’s normal sized world, things are continuous and reasonable in our normal experience of sensible things, but when physics delves into the quantum world of the extremely small, things get discontinuous, weird, and irrational to our common sense. A remark attributed to Richard Feynman is, “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.” A similar remark by Niels Bohr is, “Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.”\n\nSo it is, albeit to a vastly lesser degree, with small text type. If you look at a typeface at a large size and think you know how it will look small, you are likely mistaken. The visual appearance of type at small sizes has little to do with the fair curves, crisp edges and clever details visible at large sizes. The reasons are both subtle and complicated, and I think neither vision scientists nor type designers understand them fully, although type designers have been dealing with the problem a lot longer, at least since Griffo in 1501, and before him, scribes were writing even smaller letters with crow quill pens. Marginalia in early books are often smaller and more crisply crafted than the types. Throughout the history of typography, only a handful of designers knew how to cut type that worked well at small sizes. Of course, there were only a handful of designers in most eras. Today we are blessed with many more type designers, thanks to digital technology and more education in the art of type design, but it seems that relatively few modern designers know how to make good tiny type, or good type tiny.\n\nAn advantage for type designers is that they can use 20/20 hindsight to study previous designs and assess their own trials and errors to see what works and what doesn’t, and thus develop better approaches to designs for small sizes. The disadvantage is that designers often lack scientific methods to measure and evaluate their success or failure objectively, so they rely more on received craft lore, which is sometimes very good but sometimes not so hot.\n\nAn advantage for scientists is that they use controlled experiments, measurements, and calculations to establish testable values for what is going on between the graphical objects, eye, and brain at small sizes. A disadvantage is that scientific findings alone don’t provide enough guidance for designing practical types that are acceptable to the majority of readers, in part because cultural history and aesthetic standards are sometimes arbitrary. But, science can guide designers, and designers can create forms for scientists to study, so there is reciprocity.\n\nCritical Print Size\n\nOne of the most important scientific findings about legibility has come from studies by Gordon Legge, a psychophysicist and reading researcher at U. of Minnesota. He calls this finding the “critical print size”; it is the threshold of fluent reading. Above the critical print size, people read fluently at their top or easy reading speed. Surprisingly, increases of type size much above critical print size barely increases reading speed. Speed remains nearly constant, along a long plateau even as type size increases, until, at a very large size, roughly ten times the critical print size, reading speed eventually starts to decrease.\n\nBelow critical print size, however, reading speed falls sharply as size decreases. A graph plotting reading speed against type size looks like a cliff - a long, horizontal, nearly flat plateau with a steep, nearly vertical drop-off at one end. Below the critical print size, a reader’s vision falls off the cliff and plunges toward illegibility, as seen in the drop at the left of this graph.\n\nReading speed (words per minute) vs. print size (x-height in degrees). Data are replotted from four experiments. Legge et al. (2007) used the RSVP method (open circles). The other three studies used scrolling text—filled circles: Legge et al. (1985), matrix sampling; filled squares: Legge et al. (1985), blur; and triangles: Akutsu et al. (1991). The data points are means across subjects. RSVP is known to yield much higher reading speeds than scrolling text, accounting for the vertical shift in the curve for Legge et al. (2007). From Legge & Bigelow, see References below.\n\nProfessor Legge has been publishing papers on this phenomenon since the mid-1980s, but he points out that it was recognized by the psychologist Edmund Burke Huey in 1908. Huey in turn credited some earlier studies for similar findings. For fluent reading, Huey recommended that the minimum size of printed type x-height should not be below 1.5 millimeters. That number turns out to be important to the present study, and I will come back to it later.\n\nThe reasons why reading speed decreases precipitously when size falls below the critical print size are not fully understood, but presumably are a combination of factors and limitations in the human visual system. One limitation is acuity - how well we can see very small objects. As objects, like letters, get smaller, we have more trouble seeing them. The familiar Snellen eye chart with its slab-serif capital letters at different sizes is a test of visual acuity. Another limitation on reading is a phenomenon called “crowding”- how well we can recognize separate symbols when they are crowded together. Crowding is rarely tested by doctors or ophthalmologists, but it turns out to be an important factor that limits legibility at small type sizes. Another limitation is contrast between letters and background. Most type is nominally black on white, but often, the black isn’t really black, nor the white really white. Contrast usually doesn’t slow reading speed much until it is quite low.\n\nAnother possible factor in the NY Times magazine is the contrast sensitivity of the human visual system in relation to the rotogravure printing process of the magazine. Rotogravure renders images with a grid of tiny cells, the same in two-dimensional cross-section like a pixel pattern, but of varying depths. The cells get filled with liquid ink when the gravure cylinder is charged, and depending on how much ink fills a cell, that little part of the image or text is a lighter or darker tone of gray on the page.\n\nFor type, this also means that the letter image is dithered around the edges by gray pixels where letter features do not align exactly with the gravure cell boundaries. This is a little like anti-alias gray-scaling of type on screens. The gray-dithered pixels occur even on straight line edges, as well as on curves and diagonals, giving them a dithered, feathered, or chewed appearance when viewed in magnification. When type edges are dithered and grayed, some of the finer details of the letterforms are lost while some noise is added, but it is unclear (at least to me) how much this affects legibility. Reading can be remarkably resistant to blur and noise.\n\nOther factors affecting reading speed are discussed in Professor Legge’s book, Psychophysics of Reading in Normal and Low Vision (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 2007).\n\nTexture\n\nAt very small type sizes, letters are crowded together, our visual system gives up trying to recognize the letters, and text stops making sense, becoming “texture”, as Sarah Rosen and Denis Pelli have written (see References below). As a typographer, I use the word “texture” somewhat differently. I would say that body type in readable text sizes has a recognizable texture. Is “texture” necessarily inscrutable? This is a matter of definition, not of phenomenon. As a typographer, I think of texture as an emergent quality that can be used to recognize different typefaces, qualities, and aesthetics in text that is still legible. Years ago, I was lucky enough to be a student of Hermann Zapf, and later to work for a time with Zapf and Max Caflisch, a great Swiss typographer who had been an assistant to Jan Tschichold. These guys were in their 60s then, and they could look at a page of text and recognize not only which type it was, say Garamond, but which version of Garamond from which foundry or composing machine. They could tell by the texture.\n\n[For more about texture in typography, see my essay “Form, Pattern & Texture in the Typographic Image” after this article in the blog: http://bigelowandholmes.typepad.com/bigelow-holmes/2015/03/form-pattern-texture-in-the-typographic-image.html]\n\nNY Times Magazine text.\n\nNow again we return to the legibility question of the relaunched NY Times Magazine.\n\nThe text type design is not specifically shown or mentioned in Mr. Silverstein’s article. The text typeface design appears to be a “text” variant of one of the new display typefaces, but because it is set small, it is not easy to distinguish all its features.\n\nThe text type features\n\nIt may well be, as Mr. Silverstein writes, that this face has never before seen the light of day, but its parts certainly have. It is a hybrid of historical precedents that are separated by hundreds of years and imitate features from several different designs cut by different historical designers. One batch of features is derived from types cut by Johann Michael Fleischmann, an 18th century type punch-cutter who was born and trained in Germany but spent his adult career working in the Netherlands. Another bunch of features comes from types cut by Robert Granjon, a 16th century French punch-cutter, who flourished two centuries earlier than Fleischmann. Some of the Granjon-esque features are not exactly imitative of Granjon’s own cuttings, but appear to derive from a 1913 reworking of Granjon’s types by the English Monotype corporation under the direction of its works manager, F. H. Pierpont.\n\nThe Monotype-reworked Granjon of 1913 is called Plantin, after Christophe Plantin, a renowned printer of the 16th century, who used types cut by Granjon. French by origin, Plantin spent most of his illustrious career in Antwerp, where a museum of printing is now housed in his former establishment.\n\nAnother set of borrowed features in the new type is its near-triangular serif structure, typical of “Latine” style French types of the 19th century. A good modern revival of Latine is Adrian Frutiger’s Méridien of 1957, a revised version of which is called Frutiger Serif.\n\nWhen I look at a page of the relaunched NY Times magazine, I cannot, unlike my tutors Zapf and Caflisch for types of their era, recognize the face by its texture. Instead, I feel a queasy sense of presque vu - as if I’ve seen it somewhere before but can’t quite remember exactly what, where, or when. I feel like the hapless time traveler jerked around in Alain Resnais’ disorienting classic movie “Je t’aime, je t’aime”, in a past out of control.\n\nNevertheless, despite its time-traveling melange of borrowed features, the new text typeface is crisply drawn and well fitted. Its legibility problem is not its design per se, but its size.\n\nMeasuring type size by visual angle\n\nTo realize this, we need to return to the “critical print size” studied by Gordon Legge and his colleagues. Critical print size is measured as a visual angle subtended at the retina of the eye. Although a very useful measure, it is unfamiliar to most typographers, designers, and editors, which is may be why the new text in the NYT magazine is no more legible than the old. Actually, the new text may be slightly less legible, despite the effort of creating a new font.\n\nPoint size of type is a numerical measure that developed over the past 300 years. First attempts to determine numerical sizes of type began around 1694, long predating the metric system, and the most recent integration of point sizes with the English inch system occurred in 1984, with the PostScript measure of exactly 72 points per inch. Point sizes are good for general use, but not really accurate for measuring the perceived size of type. The problem with a single physical measure of type size, like nominal point size, is that visual size changes with viewing distance. If you hold a page half as far away as normal, the type will look twice as big, If you hold the page twice as far away as normal, the type will look half as big. To the eye, closer means bigger, farther means smaller. With text type, the reader’s eye is, or should be, be the primary thing we care about. This is something that art directors and graphic designers must to consider - they need to see things through their readers’ eyes.\n\nUp close, type subtends a bigger angle at the retina; farther away, a smaller angle; this is why vision scientists use visual angle — it is a measure that takes both physical/graphical size and viewing distance into account. Recall that when you take an eye test at a doctor’s office or department of motor vehicles, you have to stand or sit at a prescribed distance for which the test is calibrated. The test measures visual acuity for a certain viewing distance, and certain letter sizes.\n\nVisual size, as measured by visual angle, helps us understand the relationship between type size and reading distance. To get an idea of visual angle in relation to type size and viewing distance, it is helpful to recall some high-school geometry. (Wait, don’t stop reading yet; you aren’t really going back to high-school; I promise things will clear up again after this rough patch.)\n\nImagine a thin right triangle with its sharpest angle at the eye, and the triangle side opposite that angle as the x-height of a font on a page perpendicular to the line of sight to the eye. OK? Try sketching it. Got it?\n\nSo now we have a long straight line from the eye to the baseline of some type. That long line is one leg of a right triangle, and the x-height perpendicular to it is the other leg of the right triangle. So now we have two sides forming a right angle.\n\nNow imagine the third side, called the hypotenuse in geometry (don’t worry, there is no test on the material), running from the top of the x-height to the eye, where it joins the other long leg to make that sharp angle of the skinny right triangle. So now we have a triangle. What we want to do is measure that sharp angle in degrees. That is the visual angle that we use to estimate legibility.\n\nTo repeat (after that harrowing brush with geometry), visual angle uses two perpendicular measures: the height of the type and the distance to the eye. That enables us to compare visual sizes independent of distance. If we halve the viewing distance but keep the type size, it will look twice as big, but if we halve the viewing distance and also halve the type size, it will appear the same size to the eye, at it did at normal distance and size. And, if we double the viewing distance and also double the type size, it will appear the same size as normal distance and size.\n\nThis can be grasped visually by printing out text at different type sizes and viewing it at different distances. Compare, for example, a typeface printed at 12 point and viewed at 8 inches to the same face printed at 24 point and viewed at 16 inches, and one printed at 48 point and viewed at 32 inches.\n\nIf you know the size of the font and the distance from the page to the eye, you can calculate the angle at the eye, using trigonometry. What is best to measure? In measuring the size of a font in relation to reading, for the Latin alphabet, the x-height is more useful than body size or capital height. Gordon Legge and I offered arguments in support of using x-height in our paper, “Does print size matter for reading? A review of findings from vision science and typography” in the Journal of Vision, 2011. (See references below.)\n\nIn arguing in favor of x-height measurement, we don’t claim that a big x-height is always better for type, but rather, that x-height is usually the best indicator of perceived size. If someone prefers to measure capital height, for example, which may be more useful in German-literate countries where all noun begin with capitals, the visual angle for capitals can be found the same way as for x-height.\n\nOf course, it is important when comparing measurements of visual angle, to be sure that all items in the comparison are measured the same way, all x-height, or all capital height, or all body size.\n\nThe critical print size found by Legge is approximately 0.2 degrees of visual angle for the x-height of the type ion print. In his book, Psychophysics of Reading in Normal and Low Vision (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ, 2007), he states that in some studies, the critical size is as large as 0.3 degrees, while in other studies, as small as 0.17 degrees, and that a visual angle of 0.2 degrees is a consensus size for normally sighted readers across several studies. Different findings from different laboratory studies suggest that critical print sizes may vary for different people in different situations. In the everyday world of practical typography, critical print size can be expected to vary at least as much as in the laboratory. Some readers may have keen eyesight, others may have uncorrected vision deficits; some lighting conditions may be bright, some dim; some readers will be younger readers, some older. A 1991 study by Akutsu, Legge, Ross, and Schuebel (see critical print size graph above) showed that not only does reading speed slow down for text below 0.20 degrees of visual angle, but that it slows more among older readers than younger. At angular sizes between 0.3 degrees and 1.0 degrees (approximate x-heights of 6 point to 20 point), older readers without eye disease read as fast as younger readers, but at very small or very large sizes, the older readers read only 70% as fast as young readers. Because many young people have moved their reading to electronic media, the remaining loyal readers of the print edition of the NY Times Magazine are likely to be older and to need a larger print size for maximum reading speed.\n\nTherefore, to support a wide readership, type sizes should not be aimed at the youngest readers with the best vision under optimal conditions, but to a wider range of average readers under various conditions. Remember that the successful Italian Renaissance printer, Aldus Manutius, used roman types with x-height around 6.85 points or 0.343 degrees, well in the range for older readers, and italic type with x-height around 4.72 point or 0.236 degrees of visual angle, somewhat smaller than the range for older readers but still well above the 4 point and 0.2 degrees of the critical print size. The type designs that Aldus used have been deservedly praised, but the sizes at which he used them were also well-adjusted to his readership.\n\n"
