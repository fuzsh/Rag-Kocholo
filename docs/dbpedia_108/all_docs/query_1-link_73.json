The journal welcomes contributions, either experimental or theoretical, related to the field of laboratory medicine. It is the leading forum for peer-reviewed, original research on innovative practices in today’s clinical laboratory. In addition to being the most cited journal in the field, Clinical Chemistry has the highest Impact Factor among journals of laboratory medicine, clinical pathology, analytical chemistry, and clinical laboratory subspecialties, such as clinical chemistry, molecular diagnostics, transfusion medicine, and clinical microbiology.\n\nTopics of interest include:\n\nAnalytical techniques\n\nArtificial intelligence applied to laboratory medicine\n\nClinical investigations in which laboratory testing has played a major role\n\nClinical Microbiology\n\nData processing\n\nGenomics\n\nLaboratory instrumentation\n\nMolecular diagnostics\n\nStatistical analyses of data\n\nTest utilization or testing-related health or financial outcomes\n\nContributions should consist of subject matter that is original and significantly advances the state of knowledge of laboratory medicine, and conclusions that are justified from the design of the experiments and the data presented. The information must be sufficiently detailed to permit replication of the work by a competent professional in the field.\n\nAll Clinical Chemistry submissions, correspondence, and reviews must be in English. Equal consideration is given to original manuscripts in English from any country, regardless of ADLM membership. It is, however, advised that authors whose primary language is not English enlist the aid of a colleague proficient in English scientific writing or a professional editing service. Regardless of language editing, manuscript content and writing responsibility remains with the author; however, professional writing/editing services are available to assist authors. Please visit the Language Services page for a list of resources.\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the current International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals.\n\nContributions are submitted via ScholarOne Manuscripts. Please contact the Editorial Office via e-mail (clinchemed@myadlm.org) should you have any questions or need assistance. Please also visit OUP's Journals Authoring pages for information about publishing in an Oxford Academic journal.\n\nStandards for Reporting Scientific Data\n\nDescription of Analytical Methods and Results\n\nStatistics\n\nStudies with Human Subjects\n\nInclusive Language\n\nClinical Trials\n\nAnimal Studies\n\nOpen Access Requirements\n\nNaming of Genes and Description of Genetic Variation\n\nDescription of Analytical Methods and Results\n\nManuscripts describing the development and performance evaluation of new or improved quantitative methods and instruments should ideally include data describing linearity, imprecision, stability, analytical specificity, recovery, limit of detection, comparability with other analytical methods, lower limit of quantification, and reference interval(s). One goal of method evaluation is to demonstrate the robustness of the assay as it might perform in clinical research studies or in clinical practice. Inclusion of some human clinical or research data should accompany new or improved method descriptions and the clinical and/or analytical advantages of the new or improved methods over existing methods should be described.\n\nAt a minimum, quantitative method evaluations should address imprecision, linearity, lower limit of quantification, stability, and specificity. Some experiments from the 2018 Food and Drug Administration final guidance for industry “Bioanalytical Method Validation” could be relevant, but they are often limited in scope. Other example experiments are provided in an Opinion published in Clinical Chemistry and attempt to generate data predicting longer-term performance of the assay. However, the most rigorous examples of experiments that would inform readers of the utility and robustness of new quantitative assays are found at the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (e.g., EP-05, EP-06, EP-17, EP-07).\n\nQualitative or semi-quantitative methods should also present method evaluation data regarding accuracy, method comparisons, and stability.\n\nDescription of a reference interval study should include details about sampling; selection of subjects, including their number, age, race and ethnicity, and sex distribution; the statistical method for summarizing the results; and other factors that would influence the values obtained.\n\nStatistics\n\nDescribe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty. Avoid sole reliance on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of P values, which fails to convey important quantitative information. The statistical software programs used should be reported with the version and any applicable statistical packages. A flowchart with inclusion and exclusion criteria should be considered to improve understanding of the underlying design and decisions made for the final dataset that is analyzed.\n\nAuthors should follow EQUATOR Reporting Guidelines.\n\nAdditional considerations for authors include:\n\nFor normally distributed data, use means and standard deviations (SDs).\n\nFor not normally distributed data, present median and interquartile range (IQR) or range.\n\nPercentages should be presented along with the numerical values.\n\nPresent results numerically (e.g., absolute values, relative risk, etc.).\n\nPresent measures of uncertainty, such as standard error or 95% confidence limits.\n\nMeasures of association should be reported with 2 decimal places.\n\nP values should be preceded by effect estimates and measure of uncertainty, e.g., “1.21(1.11-1.31; P=0.01)\"\n\nPresent P values between .001 and .01 to the nearest thousandth. Present P values greater than or equal to .01 to the nearest hundredth. Present P values greater than .99 as \"P>.99.\" Present very small P values exponentiated, e.g., 1.2*10-7.\n\nDescribe if P values are one-sided or two-sided.\n\nClearly describe which analyses are the pre-specified as main, secondary, subgroup, exploratory, and sensitivity analyses, or post-hoc analyses.\n\nInclude a description of sample size considerations and/or power calculations.\n\nDistinguish between statistical and clinical significance.\n\nThe precision of the results should be clinically and scientifically meaningful.\n\nThe significance threshold should be adjusted for multiple comparisons. For hypothesis testing, this can be done by Bonferroni testing or other methods. For exploratory analyses, false discovery rate may be used.\n\nThe manuscript should report and manage missing data and justify these with appropriate assumptions. Missing data can be handled multiple ways, including multiple imputation and inverse probability weights in the statistical models. Sensitivity analyses can include investigating “missing not at random” (MNAR).\n\nFor time-to-event data, proportional hazards should be tested and reported. If the proportional hazard fails to hold, time-dependent effect estimates should be presented. Competing risk assessment should be considered if appropriate.\n\nFor clinical trials, P values are not traditionally presented in table of characteristics. If there are any imbalances in the comparison groups, this should be reflected upon as chance or non-random randomization. It should be clear which analyses are intention-to-treat and which are per-protocol, and the for the latter, why this method of analysis was chosen over intention-to-treat.\n\nOther measures for follow-up studies include absolute event values, absolute risk, median survival, total follow-up time, mean follow-up time, etc.\n\nFor observational studies, consideration should be given to confounding and how this is handled in statistical analyses.\n\nFor observational studies, which attempt to estimate a causal effect, appropriate assumptions should be described, and appropriate statistical methods should be used (such as inverse probability weighting, instrumental variables etc.).\n\nValidating findings in more than one dataset is recommended.\n\nStudies with Human Subjects\n\nFor studies with human subjects, Clinical Chemistry adheres to the recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). All investigators should ensure that the planning, conduct, and reporting of human research are in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration as revised in 2013. All authors should seek review and/or approval to conduct research from an independent institutional, local, regional, or national review body (e.g., ethics committee, institutional review board). If the journal inquires as to whether the research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their approach and demonstrate that the local, regional, or national review body explicitly approved the aspects of the study under question. Submissions such as Clinical Case Study, Clinical Toxicology Series, Genetic Metabolic Series, and What Is Your Guess? should also comply with an author’s local requirements for publishing case reports. Some countries and institutions do not consider case reports to be human subjects research, but may require a patient’s informed consent.\n\nAny identifying information, including names, initials, or hospital numbers, will not be published in written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes, and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. In this context, informed consent for this purpose requires that an identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should disclose to these potentially identifiable patients whether any identifiable material might be available via the internet as well as in print after publication. Authors should obtain and archive written patient consent forms in accordance with local regulations or laws and will be required to attest in writing upon submission that they have received and archived written patient consent. A general consent form provided by Oxford University Press and recognized by the journal can be downloaded here. When informed consent has been obtained, this will be indicated in the published article. Please describe in the Materials and Methods section of the submitted manuscript if informed consent has been received.\n\nApproval by a responsible review body does not preclude editors from forming their own judgment on whether the conduct of the research was appropriate. The journal may request documentation of review and/or approval of the research study by an independent body.\n\nIn studies that report race and ethnicity, the data source and method of identification should be described. For example, the data source could be an electronic medical record, laboratory information system or public database. The method of identification could be subject self-identification. When race and ethnicity are reported, they should be capitalized (e.g., Asian, Black, Hispanic, White).\n\nInclusive Language\n\nLanguage used in manuscripts should avoid bias. Authors should carefully consider the language used with regard to categories including age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity, and/or socioeconomic status.\n\nAge-based bias should be avoided. Rather than terms such as “elderly” or “aged,” authors are recommended to use specified ages and distributions or more precise descriptors such as “less than [<]” or “greater than [>].” For example, “subjects less than 1 year of age” or “subjects greater than 65 years.”\n\nSex should be used for describing biologic differences between male, female, and intersex. Gender should be used for describing self-identification, psychological, social and/or cultural factors. Sex should not be used interchangeably with gender. Whenever possible, avoid the use of sex- or gender-specific pronouns. Consider the use of gender neutral terms such as “they” or “them.”\n\nSpecific terms for sexual orientation such as “lesbians” or “gay men” should be used instead of the term “homosexuals. The use of sexual behavior descriptions such as “men who have sex with men,” “MSM,” “women who have sex with women,” “WSW,” or “bisexual people” may be considered. However, the journal recognizes that data may be derived from sources that have historically used other terms; the use of alternative terms should be described in the methods.\n\nRace and ethnicity are social constructs. In studies that report race and/or ethnicity, the data source and method of identification should be described. For example, the data source could be an electronic medical record, laboratory information system or public database. The method of identification in the data source should be specified (e.g., subject self-identification). When race and ethnicity are reported, they should be capitalized (e.g., Asian, Black, Latino, White). Racial and ethnic descriptions are preferred as adjectives instead of nouns (e.g., Asian participants is preferred over Asians). Combinations of race/ethnicity with geography should not be hyphenated (e.g., Asian American is preferred over Asian-American). The terms “multiracial” and “multiethnic” may be used when the subpopulations are defined; the term “mixed race” should not be used. Overly broad terms that should be avoided include “people of color,” “Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC),” “Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME),” and Black and minority ethnic (BME).”\n\nAvoid the use of “non-” categories for statistical comparison. For example, rather than a comparison between “White” and “non-White,” the categories could be “White” and “Racial/ethnic minority groups.” If an “Other” category is used, additional details of the research subjects in this category should be provided. Generally, abbreviations for race/ethnicity should be avoided if possible; however, abbreviations may be used in tables and figures.\n\nFor socioeconomic status, terms such as “low-income” or “limited-income” are preferred over “the poor” or “the unemployed.” For disease state, describe patients as having a disease rather than being diseased. The language should be focused on the person/patient instead of the disease. For example, the preferred terminology is “patients with a BMI of [BMI range]” or “patients affected by obesity” instead of “the obese.”\n\nSee “Methods” in the “Text” section in these author guidelines for additional recommendations on the use of race and/or ethnicity in biological interpretation.\n\nFor further reading, guidance on inclusive language, and preferred terms see the AMA Manual of Style, 11th Edition, Section 11.12: Inclusive Language.\n\nClinical Trials\n\nStudies that report the results of a clinical trial should adhere to the recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).\n\nClinical trials must be registered in a public trials registry at or before the time of first patient enrollment. The registration number should be reported during the submission process, listed at the end of the abstract, and included in the text at the first use of a trial acronym.\n\nA data sharing statement should be included that indicates the following: whether individual deidentified participant data (including data dictionaries) will be shared (“undecided” is not an acceptable answer); what data in particular will be shared; whether additional, related documents will be available (e.g., study protocol, statistical analysis plan, etc.); when the data will become available and for how long; by what access criteria data will be shared (including with whom, for what types of analyses, and by what mechanism).\n\nAnimal Studies\n\nStudies reporting experiments on animals should adhere to the recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). When reporting experiments on animals, authors should indicate whether institutional and national standards for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed. Further guidance on animal research ethics is available from the International Association of Veterinary Editors’ Consensus Author Guidelines on Animal Ethics and Welfare.\n\nOpen Access Requirements\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other funding authorities have implemented policies for open access to funded research studies. For example, NIH has implemented its \"Policy on Enhancing Public Access to Archived Publications Resulting from NIH Funded Research.\"\n\nAny paper funded (in whole or part) by the NIH should have NIH clearly listed as a funder, and those papers will be automatically deposited to PubMed Central with a 12-month embargo. These NIH-funded papers will be automatically submitted to PubMed Central (PMC) after they have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication. This “accepted manuscript” is the version of the manuscript after the author’s final revision but before post-acceptance editing and copyediting.\n\nAuthors also have the option to request that their papers be made open access at the time of online publication, for a fee. Authors will receive instructions on how to select an open access license after acceptance. For more information, visit OUP's Open Access page.\n\nFor all publications in Clinical Chemistry, content is made freely available 12 months after the publication date.\n\nSee section below for additional information: Submission/Publication Fees\n\nNaming of Genes and Description of Genetic Variation\n\nHuman genes should be named according to the HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) approved gene names and symbols. Human gene symbols are italicized and symbols for proteins are not italicized. Genes names which are written in full are not italicized. For genes which have undergone a recent change in name or symbol, the authors should use the most up to date HGNC gene symbol with the legacy symbol in parentheses. For example, the gene lysine methyltransferase 2A historically had a name and symbol of mixed-lineage leukemia and MLL, respectively. In a manuscript, the first mention of the gene should be written KMT2A (historically referred to as MLL).\n\nGenetic sequence variants should be described according to Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature.\n\nAdditional Guidelines for Reporting Findings\n\nFor original research studies, authors should comply with the following guidelines for diagnostic accuracy, outcomes studies, microarray experiments, and quantitative real-time PCR.\n\nStudies of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD)\n\nOutcomes Studies (CONSORT)\n\nMinimum Information about a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)\n\nMinimum Information about Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE)\n\nMinimum Information about Digital PCR Experiments (dMIQE)\n\nEstimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)\n\nStudies of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD)\n\nFor studies of diagnostic accuracy of tests, complete the STARD Checklist for Evaluations of Diagnostic Accuracy. Upload the completed form at submission.\n\nThe STARD guidelines include:\n\nProvide literature reference(s) describing the evaluated test(s) and criterion \"gold standard\" test(s) or include detailed descriptions of them.\n\nFollow accepted methodologic standards including the following:\n\nSpecify spectrum of evaluated patients (age and sex distributions, eligibility criteria, and summary of symptoms or disease stage).\n\nAnalyze pertinent subgroups of subjects (e.g., symptomatic and asymptomatic patients).\n\nAvoid verification bias (usually by application of a \"gold-standard\" test to all subjects rather than to a clinically selected subset).\n\nCategorize test results and patients independently to avoid reviewer bias (usually by performance of tests with blinding to patient information and vice versa).\n\nProvide confidence intervals (or SE) for indices of diagnostic accuracy such as sensitivity/specificity, likelihood ratios, and areas under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\n\nIndicate the number of indeterminate test results and their use (if any) in further data analysis.\n\nProvide laboratory data on analytical imprecision of the test (usually day-to-day CV at two or more concentrations) or reproducibility of observer interpretation (e.g., for a visually read, dichotomous [positive/negative] test).\n\nA flow diagram is strongly recommended.\n\nWhen evaluating diagnostic accuracy in clinical studies, simple testing of the significance of differences between mean values of patient groups (e.g., by Student t-test) provides insufficient information to assess diagnostic accuracy.\n\nOutcomes Studies (CONSORT)\n\nOutcomes studies (CONSORT)\n\nThe CONSORT guideline and checklist should be used for randomized controlled trials.\n\nMinimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)\n\nNCBI MIAME Guidelines\n\nMIAME describes the minimum information about a microarray experiment that is needed to enable interpretation of the results of the experiment unambiguously and potentially to reproduce the experiment. Microarray studies should comply with the reporting guidelines of MIAME.\n\nMinimum Information About Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE)\n\nMIQE Checklist\n\nFor studies that include quantitative real-time PCR experiments, complete the MIQE checklist for evaluation of qPCR experiments and upload during electronic submission. The full text of the MIQE guidelines is available online.\n\nRecommended nomenclature should be used, including:\n\nqPCR for quantitative real-time PCR\n\nRT-qPCR for reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR\n\nreference genes instead of housekeeping genes\n\nhydrolysis probes instead of TaqMan® probes\n\ndual hybridization probes for HybProbes® (LightCycler®) probes\n\nquantification instead of quantitation\n\nCq instead of Ct, Cp, or TOP\n\nquantification cycle instead of threshold cycle or crossing point\n\nThe MIQE guidelines are intended to help authors plan, perform, and present qPCR experiments. They are also a guide for reviewers and editors to judge the quality of qPCR data. Incomplete information may be grounds for manuscript rejection. Use of Supplemental Data is encouraged as necessary.\n\nMinimum Information about Digital PCR Experiments (dMIQE)\n\nFor studies that include digital PCR experiments, complete the digital MIQE checklist for evaluation of digital PCR experiments and upload during electronic submission. The full text of the dMIQE guidelines is available online with a checklist.\n\nEstimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)\n\nFor studies including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the manuscripts should use the CKD-EPI 2021 refit equations without the race variable where possible. When an alternative equation is used, this should be accompanied by an explanation in the methods section (for example, “CKD-EPI 2021 refit equation is not validated for this population”).\n\nThe equation for age ≥18 years in a single expression for eGFRcr is:\n\neGFRcr= 142×min(Scr/κ, 1)a×max(Scr/κ, 1)−1.200×0.9938Age×1.012 [if female]\n\nwhere κ = 0.7 (females) or 0.9 (males)\n\na = −0.241 (female) or −0.302 (male)\n\nScr = serum creatinine in mg/dL; divide by 88.4 for creatinine in µmol/L\n\nAge (years)\n\nThe coding for implementing the single equation is nuanced. The “min(Scr/κ, 1)” factor indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1.0 and “max(Scr/κ, 1)” indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1.0.\n\nSee Inker LA, Eneanya ND, Coresh J, et al. New Creatinine- and Cystatin C-Based Equations to Estimate GFR without Race. N Engl J Med 2021 Nov 4;385:1737-49.\n\nOriginality and Reproducibility of Research\n\nPlagiarism and Duplicate Submissions\n\nPreprint Publications\n\nAvailability of Data, Materials, and Code\n\nPlagiarism and Duplicate Submissions\n\nClinical Chemistry uses the recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance on policies and procedures regarding overlapping publications. All manuscripts are evaluated by plagiarism detection software prior to publication. Misconduct including, but not limited to, the following is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate removal of a paper from consideration by the journal.\n\nSubmissions that are under review or that have been previously published with another journal\n\nManuscripts that have substantial overlap with a manuscript that has already been published\n\nManuscripts that have substantial overlap with a manuscript previously published by the authors (self-plagiarism)\n\nPreprint Publications\n\nAuthors retain the right to make an Author’s Original Version (preprint) available through various channels, and this does not prevent submission to the journal. For further information see our Online Licensing, Copyright and Permissions policies. If accepted, the authors are required to update the status of any preprint, including your published paper’s DOI, as described on our Author Self-Archiving policy page.\n\nClinical Chemistry will consider submitted papers that have had a previous version posted on a preprint server on a case-by-case basis. In examining submissions with an existing preprint, the editors will consider such factors as whether the submitted manuscript will add meaningful new information to the literature. Authors must declare at first submission that their paper is available as a preprint and must provide the name of the preprint server, the DOI, and a link to the preprint. This information should be included in the cover letter to the editor, in the designated field in the submission system, and in a statement at the end of the manuscript. If the authors fail to declare the existence of a preprint at initial submission, this may be cause for rejection.\n\nEditors will not look favorably on work generated by a particular methodology that has only been listed or referenced in the preprint and has not gone through the peer-review process. A manuscript may not be posted to a preprint server once it has already been submitted and is under consideration by the journal.\n\nAuthors must retain their copyright to the preprint and will be required to transfer copyright to the journal if the manuscript is accepted. The preprint itself cannot be indexed in PubMed or MEDLINE.\n\nPreprints may be cited in the references section; however, the editors will determine their suitability on a case-by-case basis. References to non-peer-reviewed, methods-based papers are not permitted.\n\nAvailability of Data, Materials, and Code\n\nWhere ethically feasible, Clinical Chemistry strongly encourages authors to make available to readers all data and software code on which the conclusions of the paper rely. We suggest that data be presented in the main manuscript or additional supporting files—or alternatively deposited in a public repository which guarantees long term access. If the latter option is chosen, it is important to preserve data as it was at the time when the paper was submitted to the journal, and any subsequent modifications or additions should be clearly indicated as separate files. If authors choose not to share data and/or software code, then they need to provide an explanation for not sharing this information. This information needs to be made available upon reasonable request. The journal may decline to publish a study which it deems has insufficient information for reproducibility.\n\nFor information on general repositories for all data types, and a list of recommended repositories by subject area, please see Choosing where to archive your data. A commonly used repository for source code and files is Github; however, code on Github may undergo changes over time. If authors share code or files by Github, they should also deposit the code and data in a repository that is static and is associated with a digital object identifier (DOI) (e.g., Figshare, Zenodo). The static version of the code will promote future replication of a published study.\n\nClinical Chemistry supports the Force 11 Data Citation Principles and requires that all publicly available datasets be fully referenced in the reference list with an accession number or unique identifier such as a digital object identifier (DOI). Data citations should include the minimum information recommended by DataCite:\n\n[dataset]* Authors, Year, Title, Publisher (repository or archive name), Identifier\n\n*The inclusion of the [dataset] tag at the beginning of the citation helps us to correctly identify and tag the citation. This tag will be removed from the citation published in the reference list.\n\nTypes of Submissions\n\nArticle\n\nClinical Case Study/Commentary\n\nClinical Chemist\n\nClinical Toxicology Series\n\nCorrection\n\nEditorial\n\nGenetic Metabolic Series\n\nLetter to the Editor/Reply\n\nLooking to the Past\n\nNews & Views\n\nOpinion\n\nPerspective\n\nPoint/Counterpoint\n\nQ&A\n\nReflection\n\nReview\n\nSpecial Report\n\nWhat Is Your Guess?\n\nArticle\n\nResearch or scientific articles are submitted directly by authors. There are no restrictions on topics that are considered for publication, as long as the subject matter is original and relates experimentally or theoretically to the field of laboratory medicine. The information must be sufficiently detailed not only to enable readers to understand and appreciate the material presented, but also to permit replication of the work by other scientists in the field.\n\nArticles should contain a structured abstract limited to 250 words and formatted to include separate headings of: Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions. The main text (excluding abstract and references) should not exceed 3,500 words. The manuscript should have no more than 40 references and a total of 6 tables and/or figures. Supplemental data are permitted for Articles.\n\nArticles should list no more than 20 authors, with any additional contributors listed in the Acknowledgments. Although exceptions are rare, if more than 20 authors are desired to be listed, you may email clinchemed@myadlm.org detailing each author's contribution to your submission, which will be forwarded to the editor for consideration.\n\nAuthors may submit short videos to complement their Articles. Videos can be used to illustrate a laboratory technique, hardware prototype, or clinical presentation that would benefit from such an addition, or to visually communicate to the reader novel features, special steps in a procedure, pitfalls, or other information that may not be easily conveyed through text or a figure. Videos should be of high quality, no more than 5 minutes in length, and submitted as .mp4 files. Please do not send proprietary file types such as .wmv (Windows Media) and .rm (Real Media) files.\n\nAuthors of Articles will be prompted at submission to provide a Brief Summary of their work, not to exceed 100 words. In the event of acceptance, this will be recorded and included as an audio file in all online versions of the table of contents. This summary may also be used in whole or in part in social media by the journal. The Brief Summary should address the following questions:\n\nWhat was the paper about/what was the rationale for the study?\n\nHow did you approach the problem?\n\nWhat were your findings?\n\nWhat are the implications of the findings and how do they add to the field?\n\nA simple phonetic spelling of the first author’s full name should also be provided in the Brief Summary. The Brief Summary may also be used by the journal to promote a publication on social media.\n\nClinical Case Studies/Commentary\n\nClinical Case Studies are submitted directly by authors. These articles are intended to be educational, with the goal of helping to develop or improve problem-solving skills. Clinical Case Studies may report unusual (although not necessarily rare) biochemical manifestations of disease, atypical presentation of disease, situations where the laboratory helped in making or clarifying a diagnosis, or information that would be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of a disease.\n\nA Clinical Case Study should not include an abstract. It should, however, include a case description followed by the case discussion, limited to 1,500 words total. References are limited to 10, and the tables and figures are limited to 2 in total. Authors should include 3-5 brief questions regarding the case that would stimulate discussion and learning about the disease state. These questions will be circulated to educational centers before publication. The author should also list up to 5 points to remember at the end of the manuscript. The questions and points are not included in the manuscript count of 1,500 words. The case should read as a bit of a mystery or diagnostic dilemma. The case title, case description, and questions should not disclose the diagnosis. Supplemental data are not permitted for Clinical Case Studies. No more than 5 authors should be listed.\n\nTwo accompanying Commentaries (invited by Clinical Chemistry editors) will introduce additional concepts that may be useful to readers, discuss confounding factors that might affect a diagnosis or analytical result, and/or provide comments about the case itself.

Submissions should not exceed 600 words in length and should include no more than 2 tables or figures and 5 references. No more than 5 authors should be listed. Supplemental data are not permitted.\n\nFor the Genetic Metabolic Series, authors should follow their local regulatory requirements for case reports. See above on Studies with Human Subjects for further details.\n\nLetter to the Editor/Reply\n\nLetters are submitted directly by authors and can be used to report an observation or to discuss a previously published original Article. Letters in response to papers other than Articles will not be considered for publication. Letters report observations on interferences, suggestions to improve test performance, or other observations that are of importance to the wider audience. A Reply to a Letter may also be solicited by the editors. The one figure or table provided should be concise and should not be multipart (i.e., Fig. 1A, 1B, 1C, Part 1, Part 2).\n\nA Letter to the Editor or Reply is limited to 750 words. It should not include an abstract. The references are limited to 5, and only 1 table or figure is permitted. Supplemental data are not permitted for Letters to the Editor or Replies.\n\nLetters to the Editor and Replies should list no more than 8 authors, with any additional contributors listed in the Acknowledgments. Although exceptions are rare, if you wish to include more than 8 authors, you may email clinchemed@myadlm.org detailing each author's contribution to your submission, which will be forwarded to the editor for consideration.\n\nIn some instances, editors may request that a submission of another article type to Clinical Chemistry be decreased to meet the requirements of a Letter to the Editor.\n\nLooking to the Past\n\nLooking to the Past falls under the Clinical Chemist. This feature is designed to look back at a prior article or topic in the field that still has relevance or links to current practice. Submissions should not exceed 750 words in length and should include no more than 5 references and 1 table or figure. No more than 5 authors should be listed.

Supplemental data are not permitted for Perspectives.\n\nPoint/Counterpoint\n\nThese articles are typically invited submissions from experts in a selected discipline and provide different viewpoints on a topic that may be controversial, lacks consensus in the scientific community, or may be of high public interest. In most cases an author or group of authors is asked to write the first half of the article, describing the importance of the topic, challenges to be addressed, current limitations, and/or unmet needs. A second author or group of authors is invited to provide a “Counterpoint” discussion of a different viewpoint or critical factors.\n\nPoint/Counterpoint submissions should not include an abstract. The manuscript is limited to 1,500 words, 15 references, and 1 table or figure. Supplemental data are not permitted for Point/Counterpoint.\n\nQ&A\n\nThis invited feature is meant to highlight a timely and important issue, either clinical or analytical, through a series of questions posed to leaders in the field by a moderator. The moderator is required to include 1) an introductory paragraph and 2) the following for each expert: a high-resolution, publication-quality photograph, and the expert's professional title and institutional affiliation. Five to 8 questions may be posed to 3 to 5 experts with the moderator documenting the answers. Submissions are limited to 5,000 words. Please note that participant photos should follow these guidelines:\n\nTIF is the preferred format for images. PDF, JPG, and PPT will also be accepted.\n\nUpload photographs as individual image files. Do not embed in the Word document or submit as multiple slides in a single PPT file.\n\nResolution should be minimum 300 dpi. Lower resolution will result in a blurry appearance in print.\n\nImages should be professional headshots, if available.\n\nPlease include photographs with each revision submission.\n\nReflection\n\nThese articles are invited submissions. Reflections are authored by highly accomplished scientists in their field who have greatly contributed to science. Reflections will be reserved for special issues and will focus on the specific advancements the individual has made in his or her field.\n\nReflections are limited to 3,500 words and should not include an abstract. The references are limited to 40, and 1 table or figure is permitted. Supplemental data are not permitted for Reflections.\n\nReview\n\nReview articles are typically invited submissions. Reviews are intended to provide coverage of a topic, including background clinical or analytical information, the relevance and importance of the subject matter, and potential future directions. The use of illustrative figures or tables is encouraged.\n\nComprehensive Review\n\nA Comprehensive Review article should cover multiple aspects of a topic including the background context, clinical relevance, analytical techniques, and potential future directions. There should be a structured abstract with headings of Background, Content, and Summary limited to 250 words. The text should not exceed 5,000 words. The manuscript should have no more than 75 references and a total of 6 tables and/or figures. Supplemental data are permitted for Comprehensive Review articles.\n\nComprehensive Reviews should list no more than 15 authors, with any additional contributors listed in the Acknowledgments.

See above on Studies with Human Subjects for further details.\n\nExpedited and Embargoed Submissions\n\nExpedited Submissions\n\nEmbargoed Submissions\n\nExpedited Submissions\n\nOriginal research articles with profound implications for clinical or scientific practice may be considered for Expedited Submission. Authors should direct a presubmission inquiry to the editor-in-chief at clinchemed@myadlm.org. The editor-in-chief will determine whether the manuscript qualifies for expedited submission within 2 business days. The initial peer review for these submissions will typically be completed within 3 business days. Authors are expected to provide revisions for expedited submissions within 3 business days. If an expedited submission is accepted, the journal will aim to publish the article online one week from acceptance.\n\nEditorial acceptance without additional review may be considered for articles that have been previously peer reviewed, but not accepted, by a prominent medical and/or scientific journal (e.g., Impact Factor greater than 10). For this pathway, the complete decision email from the prior journal, including all reviewer comments, needs to be submitted. Furthermore, in the submission cover letter, the authors should verify that all communications with the prior journal are not under a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement. The authors should also verify that all prior journal emails and reviewer comments have been provided intact and unedited. The submission to Clinical Chemistry should include a point-by-point response to the previous journal’s reviewer comments. Although the expedited submission may be accepted without additional peer review, the authors will need to format the article to the requirements of Clinical Chemistry and perform any necessary revisions within 3 business days.\n\nArticles accepted through the expedited submission mechanism will be designated as “Editor’s Choice” and be free to view.\n\nEmbargoed Submissions\n\nAccepted articles are published online as soon as proofs have been reviewed by the author and finalized. If your institution is planning to issue a press release related to your submission in the event of its acceptance, you may wish to request delayed publication in the form of an embargo. You may indicate your request for an embargo during the submission process. If your manuscript is accepted, the journal will contact you to coordinate an appropriate embargo period. All embargoes will be at the discretion of the editor and the journal.\n\nManuscript Preparation\n\nAuthor Contribution Requirements\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nManuscript Guidelines\n\nJournal Categories\n\nManuscript Sections\n\nSubmission/Publication Fees\n\nAuthor Contribution Requirements\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nClinical Chemistry follows the recommendations for authorship set out by The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In accordance with these recommendations, manuscripts are considered for publication with the understanding that each listed author must meet all of the following four criteria:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work\n\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content\n\nFinal approval of the version to be published\n\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nContributors who do not meet all 4 criteria for authorship should be named in the Acknowledgments. The submitting author assumes full responsibility that all authors listed in the manuscript have met the required criteria of eligibility for authorship and that nobody who qualifies for authorship has been omitted from the list. Individual author contributions can be described in detail using the CRediT taxonomy during submission.\n\nAuthor limits may be imposed for certain submission types. Please review the specific requirements for your submission type. Please list only the allowed number of authors in the author list; remaining contributors should be listed in an Acknowledgment. Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the editor.\n\nIf more than one author should be considered as co-first authors, or as co-corresponding authors, please indicate this clearly in a footnote on the first page of the manuscript.\n\nNatural language processing tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT or Large Language Models, do not qualify as authors, and the Journal will screen for them in author lists. The use of AI (for example, to help generate content, write code, or process data) should be disclosed both in cover letters to editors and in the Methods or Acknowledgments section of manuscripts. Please see the COPE position statement on Authorship and AI for more details.\n\nChanging the Author List\n\nAny change in authors and/or contributors after initial submission must be approved by all authors and the editor overseeing the manuscript. This applies to additions, deletions, change of order to the authors, or contributions being attributed differently. If a change is made to the author list after submission or during any revision, the corresponding author must upload a signed request letter to the online submission system as a supplemental file or send the letter in an e-mail to clinchemed@myadlm.org explaining the reason for the change. Each author, including the author to be added or removed, will be required to sign an Author Change form indicating their agreement. Any additions or deletions must be made in the electronic submission record as well as on the manuscript itself and are subject to approval by the editor.\n\nGroup Authorship\n\nIf you are including the name of a group or consortium in your author list, please clearly identify the group members who can take credit and responsibility for the work as authors by listing them in the byline. All members of the group named as authors should meet all four criteria for authorship, including approval of the final manuscript, and they should be able to take public responsibility for the work and should have full confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the work of other group authors. They will also be required as individuals to complete the author disclosure form. Additional group members not included in the author list should be listed at the end of the manuscript and will be named in MEDLINE as Collaborators.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nNatural language processing tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT or large language models, do not qualify as authors, and the Journal will screen for them in author lists. The use of AI (for example, to help generate content, write code, or process data) should be disclosed both in the cover letter to editors and in the Methods or Acknowledgments section of manuscript. Please see the COPE position statement on Authorship and AI for more details.\n\nManuscript Guidelines\n\nThe following guidelines are based on the ICJME recommendations for manuscript preparation.\n\nMS Word document (.doc or .docx) is required for all submissions.\n\nAll figures must be uploaded separately as Image Files in Tagged Image File Format (.tiff), Encapsulated Postscript (.eps) or PowerPoint (.ppt) with embedded fonts.\n\nAll submissions must be double-spaced, 1 inch margin, twelve-point font size in Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman font. Symbol font should be used for non-text characters.\n\nAll submissions must have line numbers included in the text.\n\nDo not use headers or footers.\n\nThe guidelines for length restrictions, abstract, reference, table and figure, and supplemental data limits are as outlined in the chart below:\n\n*Word limit consists of the body of the manuscript only; it does not encompass the title page, abstract, acknowledgments, references, tables, figure legends, figures, or Clinical Case descriptions, questions, and points to remember.\n\n**Structured abstracts contain the headings (1) BACKGROUND, (2) METHODS, (3) RESULTS, (4) CONCLUSIONS for all applicable article types except for Comprehensive Reviews and Mini-Reviews. Abstracts for Comprehensive Reviews and Mini-Reviews contain the headings (1) BACKGROUND, (2) CONTENT, (3) SUMMARY.\n\n***If a figure accompanies the paper, the image should not be multipart (i.e., Fig. 1A, 1B, 1C, Part 1, Part 2).\n\n**** Supplemental Data are accepted for online publication only and are limited by submission types.\n\nFonts and Formatting\n\nMS Word document (.doc or .docx) is required for all submissions.\n\nAll figures must be uploaded separately as Image Files in Tagged Image File Format (.tiff), Encapsulated Postscript (.eps) or PowerPoint (.ppt) with embedded fonts.\n\nAll submissions must be double-spaced, 1 inch margin, twelve-point font size in Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman and Symbol font (for non-text characters).\n\nAll submissions must have line numbers included in the text.\n\nDo not use headers or footers.\n\nUse standard abbreviations and define all nonstandard abbreviations.\n\nReporting of Concentration Units:\n\nOnly traditional units will be used for tables and figures in the printed version of a report; SI conversion factors will be provided in legends. SI units are available on the BIPM SI Units page.\n\nAnalyte concentrations will be expressed in the text in the traditional mass unit (mg/dL, ng/ml, and so forth) followed by the SI unit in parentheses. Exceptions would include those analytes in which SI units are used globally, such as electrolytes (use mmol/L for sodium, potassium, chloride, and CO2 values), or cases in which the traditional unit and the SI unit differ by only a factor of 1000 in both the numerator and denominator (e.g., ng/mL vs µg/L). In such cases, the unit of measure consistent with common practice will be used. The unit of measure mg/L should be used only when referring to SI units or when national or international guidelines require or recommend that the concentration of an analyte be expressed in that unit of measure, such as for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\nThe unit of measure U/L will be used for most enzyme activities.\n\nJournal Categories\n\nArticles are grouped in the journal according to subject. Upon submission, authors are required to select the journal category that best describes their manuscript from the list indicated below:\n\nAnimal Laboratory Medicine\n\nAutomation and Analytical Techniques\n\nCancer Diagnostics\n\nClinical Immunology\n\nClinical Microbiology\n\nDrug Monitoring and Toxicology\n\nEndocrinology and Metabolism\n\nEpidemiological Studies\n\nEvidence-Based Medicine and Test Utilization\n\nGeneral Laboratory Medicine\n\nHematology\n\nHemostasis and Thrombosis\n\nInfectious Disease\n\nInformatics and Statistics\n\nLaboratory Management\n\nLipids, Lipoproteins, and Cardiovascular Risk Factors\n\nMolecular Diagnostics and Genetics\n\nNutrition\n\nOther Areas of Laboratory Medicine\n\nPoint-of-Care Testing\n\nPediatric Laboratory Medicine\n\nProteomics and Protein Marker\n\nManuscript Sections\n\nTitle Page\n\nAbstract\n\nText\n\nFunding and Disclosures/Conflict of Interest\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nReferences\n\nTables\n\nFigure Legends\n\nFigures\n\nSupplemental Data (Supplemental Figures, Tables, Methods)\n\n1. Title Page\n\nThe first page of the manuscript should include the following information:\n\nFull title of submission, which should include only generic, not trade, names when describing a test, assay, etc.\n\nRunning header title of fewer than 50 characters (including spaces)\n\nList of all authors (first name, middle initial, and last name, in that order; do not include educational degrees, certifications or professional titles)\n\nNames of each author’s institution (for Q&As and Opinions only, also include the professional title for each participating expert)\n\nName, address, telephone, and e-mail address of the corresponding author;\n\nKeywords\n\nAny previous presentation of the manuscript (e.g., platform presentations, posters)\n\nWord count\n\nNumber of figures and tables\n\nList of abbreviations, in order cited; and\n\nlist of any “Human Genes\" discussed in the paper. For each gene, indicate the gene symbol and gene name approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. Include other name(s) that are used in the paper or are widely used in the literature for the gene.\n\n2. Abstract (Structured and Unstructured)\n\nStructured abstracts should be formatted to include separate headings of: Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions. For Mini-Review and Comprehensive Review articles the headings should be: Background, Content, and Summary. Both structured and unstructured abstracts are subject to a limit of 250 words.\n\nUnstructured abstracts do not require separate headings.\n\nClinical Case Study, Commentary, Editorial, Letter to the Editor, Reply, Opinion, Perspective, and Point/Counterpoint submissions do not require an abstract.\n\nIn addition to appearing at the beginning of the manuscript, abstracts must be supplied in the abstract field during online submission.\n\n3. Text\n\nThe text should be formatted with headings of Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe introduction should provide the context and specific objectives of the manuscript. For original research articles, a brief summary of the literature and the objectives and/or hypothesis should be provided. For review articles, the relevance of the topic to laboratory medicine should be provided.\n\nThe introduction should not include the methods, results, or conclusions of the study.\n\nMethods\n\nFor studies with human subjects, or materials collected or derived from patients, the methods section should begin with a statement describing the review and approval of the study by an independent institutional, local or national group (e.g., Institutional Review Board). See separate section on Studies with Human Subjects.\n\nThe criteria should be described for the inclusion and exclusion of human subjects and/or their derived samples. Sex should be used for describing biologic differences between male, female, and intersex. Gender should be used for describing self-identification, psychological, social and/or cultural factors. Sex should not be used interchangeably with gender.\n\nThe source of a study subject’s race and/or ethnicity (e.g., electronic medical record, laboratory information system) as well as the method of classification (e.g., patient self-identification) should be provided. If the categories of race/ethnicity in the data source (e.g., electronic medical record) do not match the Journal’s style, the categories from the original data source should be used in the manuscript; the additional information on the original data source should be explained in the methods section. Authors should exercise caution when analyzing and/or providing biological interpretations or conclusions based on race and/or ethnicity. Historically, laboratory medicine has had many reported associations between race and health outcomes; however, these associations have oversimplified or ignored multiple confounding variables including social determinants of health, as well as other socioeconomic, structural, institutional, cultural, demographic, or other factors. Thus, discerning the contributing role of each of these factors is difficult. If an author includes race and/or ethnicity based analysis or the derivation of algorithms/scores, then the author must provide an accompanying justification of the analysis in the methods and an explanation of the broader applicability to individual patients in the results and discussion.\n\nThe methods section should concisely provide the necessary information needed for reproduction of the study. All analytical methods used should be described. If the analytical method was previously published, then a brief description with reference to the original description is sufficient. If the analytical method used is novel, then a detailed description should be provided. For materials used in the study, commercial sources should be described with the name and location of the company.\n\nThe methods should include a description of the statistical methods and software used in the manuscript. See separate section on Statistics.\n\nResults\n\nThe results should provide information in a logical order. The key findings from each table and/or figure should be highlighted in the results. The results should not be a comprehensive recitation of all of the information contained in the tables and/or figures.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe discussion should begin with a brief summary of the key findings of the study and an explanation of how the findings are novel or relevant. The results should be discussed in the context of the published literature and unique, unexpected or expected results should be emphasized.\n\nThe limitations of the study should be described (e.g., retrospective study design, limited number of study subjects, unclear generalizability). The discussion should address the original objectives of the study and whether they were met. Future directions for research can be described.\n\nThe discussion should be supported by the results of the study.\n\n4. Funding and Disclosures/Conflict of Interest\n\nThe Journal requires all authors to disclose any potential conflict of interest at the point of submission. It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to ensure that conflicts of interest of all authors are declared to the Journal.\n\nThe authors should provide a concise and accurate statement listing all funding sources from any time period and disclosing any conflicts of interest relevant to the study that have occurred within the past 3 years. Authors without conflicts of interest, including specific financial interests and relationships and affiliations relevant to the subject of their manuscript, should include a statement of no such interests at the end of the manuscript. Failure to include this information in the manuscript may delay evaluation and review of the manuscript.\n\nIn addition to including a statement of conflict of interest in the manuscript, the authors are required to complete a Conflict of Interest form during submission. Each co-author should individually assess and complete the form. A form must be submitted even if there are no conflicts of interest to disclose, in which case the Conflict of Interest form and manuscript should state “none declared.” The corresponding author will be required to upload a form for each author at submission.\n\nEach author is expected to disclose any relevant financial relationships held personally within the past 3 years. Any companies or proprietary entities producing scientific services, which have an investment, licensing, or other commercial interest in the subject matter under consideration in the submitted manuscript, must be disclosed. A conflict of interest exists when the position, activities, or relationships of an individual, whether direct or indirect, financial or non-financial, could influence or be seen to influence the opinions or activities of the individual. For more information, refer to OUP’s definition of conflict of interest.\n\nSuch information is held in confidence while the manuscript is under review and does not influence the editorial decision on reports of research; upon acceptance, relevant information is added to the manuscript for publication. The Journal follows the COPE guidance for any undisclosed conflict of interest that emerges during peer review, production, or after publication.\n\nAuthors of editorials are expected to be free of significant financial associations with companies that may be affected by topics discussed in the manuscript and must also complete a full disclosure at the time of submission.\n\n5. Acknowledgments\n\nAcknowledgments are limited to 60 words and should follow the main text of the manuscript directly above the reference section in a separate paragraph heading labeled “Acknowledgments.” They should not appear as footnotes.\n\n6. References\n\nReferences should appear in a separate section directly following the body of the manuscript. The section must be labeled “References” with no additional punctuation. In-text citations should correspond to the numbered references in this list and should be formatted as follows: (1) or (1, 2).\n\nItalic or boldface type is prohibited in the referenced citations.\n\nList and number the references in the order that they appear in the text.\n\nDo not use the MS Word document numbering tool. Number each reference manually with the numeral and a period, followed by a space.\n\nFor articles with more than seven authors, list the first six authors followed by \"et al.\" For seven or fewer, list all authors.\n\nAuthors’ names are inverted (last name, first/second initial). Do not add periods or commas within an individual author name; however, separate author names with a comma and end the author list with a period (Smith J, Doe JJ, Adams B.).\n\nCapitalize only the first word of the title or subtitle, and any proper names that are part of the title. The title should end with a period.\n\nThe Journal names should be abbreviated as indicated at PubMed. For a list of journal abbreviations, please visit: LinkOut Journals.\n\nDo not add a period after the journal abbreviation, but continue with a space followed by the year.\n\nThe year should be followed by a semicolon and then the volume number, which is followed by a colon and then the page numbers. Delete redundant numbers, for example 1998;12:231-45.\n\nDo not include the months in parentheses; this information is not needed.\n\nUse inclusive page numbers for articles and book chapters.\n\nAbstract and supplement numbers should be provided, if applicable. Citations of unpublished abstract books, manuscripts in preparation or under review, personal communications, and manufacturers’ information should only be cited in the text and should not appear in the reference list. Unpublished material should be cited in the text as “unpublished observations,” and written permission from the source is required. Personal communications should also be listed parenthetically and should contain the first initial and last name of the contact as well as the month and year of the communication. A copy of written permission from the contact to use the communication must also be provided. Published manuscripts and manuscripts that have been accepted and are pending publication should be cited in the reference list.\n\nIn-press references cited in the reference list must be accompanied by a copy of the cited manuscript and a letter of acceptance, or a complete author proof from the publisher. These resources should be uploaded as supplemental data along with the manuscript and other print materials.\n\nClinical Chemistry style is available in the Endnote reference formatting program. Endnote users please note that the reference output from Endnote may not be exact and should still be checked carefully against the examples listed below. In particular, journal names may not be abbreviated correctly in the output. If you have used PubMed for journal name abbreviations, it is recommended that you take the following steps:\n\nOpen the output style for Clinical Chemistry.\n\nIn the settings along the left of the style window, select Journal Names.\n\nSet the Journal Names option to \"Don't Replace.\"\n\nThen, use \"File - Save As\" to save a copy with a new name.\n\nRefer to the Endnote Help Center for further assistance.\n\nReference Style\n\nJournal article with seven or fewer authors:\n\n1.

They should appear embedded as part of the submission directly following the reference section. Each table should appear on an individual page. Manuscripts will be returned to authors if the tables are uploaded as separate table files. (Manuscripts will not be returned for this reason if tables have been uploaded as supplemental data or if they are to be considered figures, in the special circumstances described below.)\n\nEach table should be clearly labeled and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals (Table 1, Table 2, etc.). The abbreviations used must be defined. As with the text, reporting of concentration units consists of analyte concentrations expressed in the text in the traditional mass unit (mg/dL, ng/ml, and so forth) followed by the SI unit in parentheses.\n\nTables should not be divided into parts. Separate parts (Table 1A, Table 1B, etc.) will be considered separate tables and will count toward your overall table/figure count.\n\nTable captions should be limited to 60 words.\n\nEach column of an individual table must have a heading and be clearly defined. Indicate explanatory footnotes with superscript lowercase italic letters in alphabetical order.\n\nTables will be converted into a standard format for publication that will not include color. Large or complex tables or tables that include graphic elements should be submitted as figures or as supplemental data for online publication only. The Editor may choose to make any table supplemental as he/she deems necessary.\n\nIf a table has been published previously, acknowledge the original source in the table caption. You must obtain written permission from the copyright holder to reproduce the table and upload this permission as supplemental data. Please specify whether the table has been exactly reproduced or adapted from the original source, and provide a copy of the original table if it has been adapted. Even if the table has been modified, it may still require a permission. Any costs associated with table permissions will be borne by the author. Contact the editorial office (clinchemed@myadlm.org) if you are not sure whether permission is needed.\n\n8. Figure Legends\n\nFigure legends must be listed together on an individual page directly following the tables or the references if the submission does not include tables. Each figure requires a figure caption and should be clearly labeled (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.). Multi-panel figures and figures with parts (a, b, c, etc.), should be distinctively labeled (Figure 1A, Figure 1B, Figure 2A, etc.).\n\nFigure legends should be limited to 60 words. The abbreviations used in the figure must be defined.\n\nIf a figure has been published previously, acknowledge the original source in the figure caption. The authors must obtain written permission from the copyright holder to reproduce the figure and upload this permission as supplemental data. Please specify whether the figure has been exactly reproduced or adapted from the original source, and provide a copy of the original figure if it has been adapted. Even if the figure has been modified, it may still require a permission. Any costs associated with figure permissions will be borne by the author. Contact the editorial office (clinchemed@myadlm.org) if you are not sure whether permission is needed.\n\n9. Figures\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nAccessibility and Color Fees\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nOxford University Press provides helpful tips on figure preparation. All figures must be uploaded separately as image files. Preferred formats are .tif, .tiff, and .eps. Formats including .jpeg, .jpg, .pdf, and .ppt are accepted if of adequate quality. If uploading .ppt images, the graphics must contain embedded fonts with one image per slide, one slide per file. Note that the use of .ppt format is discouraged, as figures render differently when opened in different versions of the software. Line drawings should be provided as vector graphics if possible. Each image should have a resolution of 600 dots-per-inch (dpi).\n\nThe submission system is designed to retrieve the manuscript file and separate image file(s) and combine or merge the files into an individual Portable Document Format (.PDF) for reviewing purposes. It is the responsibility of the author to verify the quality of the image file(s) after the conversion to PDF. It may be necessary to alter the individual image file(s) to ensure the content is not lost or misconstrued in the merged PDF.\n\nSubmissions will be returned to authors if the figures are embedded within the manuscript file and not uploaded separately or if the figures have become illegible in the merged PDF.\n\nDo not place unnecessary graphics, such as borders, in or around your figure. Pay particular attention to the quality of the lines, symbols, and patterns. Published figures are reduced to 1 column (85mm) or 2 columns (176 mm) in width. If, at that width, the figure symbols or lettering are not clear, you will need to increase the font size. Letters should be 8-10 points when reduced, and subscripts no less than 6 points. Initial capitals and lowercase letters and a medium (not bold) sans serif font are required.\n\nThe x-axis and y-axis should be clearly labeled, and the units of measurements given. This includes using decimal points instead of commas, italicizing species or gene symbols, and using U.S. English.\n\nAccessibility and Color Fees\n\nClinical Chemistry is committed to making content accessible to all readers. All color figures should be formatted so that their meaning will also be clear in black and white (i.e., using patterns or shades of gray in place of colors).\n\nAuthors may be asked to revise figures to improve accessibility. Oxford University Press provides detailed recommendations for making your artwork as accessible as possible. When preparing your figures, please consider the following general principles:\n\nMeaning should not be communicated only through color—avoid referring to color in the manuscript as the only cue to meaning. Use other cues such as text labels or varying pattern.\n\nExaggerate lightness differences between foreground and background colors. An online color contrast tool such as WebAIM can assist with optimizing contrast.\n\nIn line graphs, have a label next to the plot line (with or without leader line, as necessary); use different stroke styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted); and use different symbols for data points.\n\nIn bar graphs, label individual bars so the reader does not need to rely on perceiving colors in the legend; use a color palette with high contrast between shades; use patterns or textures with, or instead of, color; and ensure there is sufficient contrast between the bars, and between the bars and the background.\n\nDo not use color for typography unless absolutely necessary—it is best to use black text on a white background.\n\nThe costs of publishing color figures in print will be borne by the author for all article types except Q&As. Costs are $820 for each color figure published in print. There is no charge for figures that are color for the online version, but are black and white for the print publication. Upon acceptance, authors will have the opportunity to request online-only color figures. If online-only color figures are not requested, authors will be billed for the color costs. If online-only color figures are requested, color figures should be submitted to the Journal, and the figures will be converted to grayscale by the printer. Authors should not attempt to convert the figures or submit both color and grayscale versions. Optimizing your figures according to the accessibility principles stated above will ensure that both the color and grayscale print versions are clear for readers.\n\n10. Supplemental Data (Supplemental Figures, Tables, Methods)\n\nFigures or tables too large for print, manuscript material that exceeds the limitation for the specific submission type, or appendices should be submitted for online publication only. These files should be marked and uploaded separately as supplemental files during submission and should be referenced consecutively within the main text as supplemental data (i.e., \"Supplemental Table 1,\" \"Supplemental Figure 1,\" “Supplemental Table 2,” etc.). When labeling your files and referencing them within the main text, name them “Supplemental” and do not add the word “Data” (i.e., “Supplemental Table 1,” not “Supplemental Data Table 1” or “Supplementary Table 1”).\n\nGrouping all Supplemental tables, figures and text together into one or two files is preferred. If all Supplemental Figures or all Supplemental Tables are contained in a single file, that file should be referred to as \"Supplemental Figures\" or “Supplemental Tables.” The filename you provide will be used to label the file at publication, so please use a clear and descriptive filename.\n\nAll supplemental figures/images must have a legend embedded within the supplemental figure. All supplemental tables must have a title embedded within the supplemental table. All supplemental methods must have a title embedded within the supplemental text. Do not include the supplemental figure captions in the main text of the manuscript. Supplemental files must be provided in formats that are widely accessible to readers. Many readers of the Journal do not have access to the programs needed to open .eps figures, so do not use .eps format in a supplemental file.\n\nPlease be advised, supplemental data are permitted for Article, Mini-Review, Review, and Special Report submissions only. Manuscripts of all other types with supplemental data will be returned to authors.\n\nSupplemental data will be reviewed as part of the manuscript and will be evaluated for its importance and relevance.\n\nIf accepted and posted online, the supplemental data will be referenced in the text of the print article directing readers to the website.\n\nSubmission/Publication Fees\n\nAuthors are not required to pay submission fees in order to submit their work to Clinical Chemistry. If color figures are present in an accepted submission, authors will be required to pay a fee for color figures in the printed version of the publication as described above. There is no charge for figures which are color online and black and white in print (authors will be prompted for this option after the manuscript is accepted). Q&A authors will not be charged for color printing of experts’ headshots.\n\nClinical Chemistry offers the option of publishing under either a standard license or an open access license. Please note that some funders require open access publication as a condition of funding. If you are unsure whether you are required to publish open access, please clarify any such requirements with your funder or institution.\n\nShould you wish to publish your article open access, you should select your choice of open access license in our online system after your article has been accepted for publication. You will need to pay an open access charge to publish under an open access license.\n\nDetails of the open access licenses and open access charges.\n\nOUP has a growing number of Read and Publish agreements with institutions and consortia which provide funding for open access publishing. This means authors from participating institutions can publish open access, and the institution may pay the charge. Find out if your institution is participating.\n\nOnline Submission and Tracking\n\nScholarOne Manuscripts\n\nRegistering\n\nChanging Contact Information and Password\n\nCRediT\n\nORCID\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nManuscript Transfer\n\nScholarOne Manuscripts\n\nClinical Chemistry uses the ScholarOne Manuscripts manuscript submission, tracking, review, and publishing system.

Authors should choose from the contributor roles outlined on the CRediT website and supply this information upon submission. You may choose multiple contributor roles per author. Any other individuals who do not meet authorship criteria and made less substantive contributions should be listed in your manuscript as non-author contributors with their contributions clearly described. Following manuscript submission, any changes to contributor roles require the approval of the editor.\n\nORCID\n\nAuthors are encouraged to register with ORCID and associate their ORCID iDs with their accounts in ScholarOne. Authors may create or link an ORCID iD during account creation, or at any time under \"Edit My Account,\" following the instructions provided.\n\nThe ORCID iD will populate automatically during manuscript submission for all listed authors who have linked their accounts to a valid identifier. Authors who wish to link an ORCID must update their own individual accounts; submitting authors are not permitted to add ORCID iDs on behalf of their co-authors. Unauthenticated ORCIDs included as text in the manuscript file will not be published.\n\nMore information about ORCID is available.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nPlease see FAQs and Help for more extensive help.\n\nManuscript Transfer\n\nIn the event that your paper is rejected, you may be interested in submitting it to Clinical Chemistry's sister journal, The Journal of Applied Laboratory Medicine (JALM).
