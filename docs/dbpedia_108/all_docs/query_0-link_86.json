        "text": "The task of finding typography for the website you are designing can be daunting. At the time of writing this article, there are over 1,000 Google font families, almost 2,000 Adobe fonts, 15,000 fonts at Fonts.com, and almost 35,000 fonts at MyFonts.com\n\nWith additional requirements for the fonts, like font pairing, their weight, readability, range of styles, and more, the task of finding the right fonts for your website can be an overwhelming challenge, to say the least.\n\nLuckily, this guide is here to help you find the best fonts for you. We’ve researched and found 40 of the best fonts for websites\n\nWebsite fonts account for 90% of the design. Therefore, choosing the right one with knowledge is critical to your site’s success. Here are some of the key reasons why:\n\n1. Font Choice Reflects Your Brand Character\n\nMost marketers know their brand’s message, but your font choice needs to reflect and represent your brand’s character. For instance, a romantic font like calligraphy or a quirky meme will not reflect your brand if you have a formal charity organization.\n\nSimilarly, if your font needs to reflect a bank, playful fonts will not build trust, and your readers may not take your brand seriously. Therefore, brand choice also revolves around understanding your target audience.\n\n2. Readability and User Experience\n\nThese issues are intertwined. Often, readers have to press their faces up against the screen to read the text. Having to do so does not positively affect their user experience. If the font is too tiny, potential leads may vanish in seconds. Similarly, choosing huge fonts is bad practice as they “shout” at the reader, which is deterring.\n\nAlso, having too many fonts comes across as confusing and unprofessional, especially if they are on the same page. The best practice is to choose a maximum of two or three fonts to ensure uniformity and clarity throughout your site. Fonts not only affect user experience but interests, navigation speed, and many other aspects.\n\n3. Business Growth\n\nUX is directly related to business opportunities. If your visitors feel comfortable reading your site content, they might stay longer than planned – especially new visitors.\n\nSites that provided readers with engaging content written in a premium, reliable font catch and retain attention. Achieving this helps you build consumer trust, increase your competitive advantage, and improve business opportunities and profits.\n\nFonts are essential for your brand or company because you want them to evoke positive emotions, provide easy readability, and improve your bottom line.\n\nSans serif fonts are those without (French: sans) markings at the end of the letters (serifs).\n\nSans serif fonts are usually simple in design, which makes them versatile in terms of placement and use. They go well in the body of a page or in header text. They can also be used to tame an otherwise unique-looking website design.\n\nIf you want to give your text a clean, minimal look and to encourage visitors to read the page all the way through, then sans serif is the font for you\n\nSerif fonts are similar to sans serif fonts in terms of having a stable and predictable structure, only they come with markings at the end of the letters (serifs).\n\nSerifs have a long history in typography which is why the style of these fonts often feels more traditional and sophisticated than others. In terms of where you can use them, serifs can be used in either the body or header text of a web page.\n\nAnother reason you might opt for a serif over other fonts is accessibility. Because serifs come with markings at the top and bottom of their characters, letters that sometimes resemble one another (like the capital “I”, lowercase “l”, and number “1”) are easily distinguishable.\n\nIn web typography, how you display numbers requires the same degree of care and consideration as letters. Although, finding an ideal font for numbers can be a challenge.\n\nNumbers are often used for data visualization, i.e. pricing tables, infographics, or special offers on landing pages. How you display these numbers can have a profound impact on the success of your webpage.\n\nFor example, if you’re using them in tables or calculations, they should use tabular lining figures. This means each figure comprises the same width and height so that the numbers line up properly next to and on top of one another.\n\nAnother thing to look for is whether the font family includes number symbols that are related to what you’ll use them for (e.g. punctuation, currency, calculations, etc.). And similar to choosing regular fonts, you’ll want to ensure that none of the numbers too closely resemble one another, like the “1” and “7” figures.\n\nIt always seems like what was old is new again, so it’s no surprise when retro or vintage fonts appear on websites despite their dated look.\n\nOne of the reasons why retro always seems to be cool is because of nostalgia. When consumers are reminded of the “good old days” through typography, they’re likely going to feel a strong emotional attachment to whatever they’re reading.\n\nAnd it’s because of this association they make to the past, even if it’s not done in an obvious way.\n\nEvery font has its unique character, and font designers inject specific meanings in the fonts they create. So, when a site designer picks a font, it elicits a particular emotion, such as happy, welcomed, relaxed, daunted, positive, enticed, or earnest.\n\nFor this reason, designers need to understand the psychology behind each font type to design the website correctly. Fonts also provide audiences with a taste of your company culture as quickly as website colors and graphics.\n\nAlthough the typographical features of serifs often classify fonts, they can also be described as having more human-like personalities. In other words, the appearance of the font (irrespective of what the words say) gives off a specific mood and feel, which can alter the effectiveness of your content.\n\nTherefore, learning to predict how your font might make your audience feel is another assurance that your content achieves the optimal effect. While there is no predictive equation (no Times New Roman always equals THIS specific mood), we have grown up in a culture where personality associations have developed. Therefore, much of the prediction may be based on awareness and instinct.\n\nWhen choosing the best web fonts for this list, we wanted to make sure that they each meet specific requirements and characteristics.\n\nLegibility: Fonts, where each character is easily distinguishable from one another — a characteristic that will help you improve accessibility and the reading experience.\n\nReadability: Fonts that are designed for use in specific parts of the site (i.e. big, bold fonts in headers vs. clean, simply styled fonts in the body).\n\nComfort/Familiarity: Fonts that make readers comfortable. Web design choices that deviate too far from the norm, can create an unnerving experience for visitors and unexpected or uncommon typefaces can contribute to that.\n\nAnother factor we considered was the weight of the font. Many web fonts aren’t pre-installed with WordPress, your theme, or your drag and drop page builder plugin.\n\nThis may cause issues with loading speeds depending on how your site is optimized (as well as consistency in how they’re displayed from browser to browser). So, if this is a major concern for you, we’ve tried to include at least one lightweight web-safe font in each category.\n\nIncluding typefaces that cover a wide range of styles (e.g. grotesque, geometric, slab, etc.) was also important. It’s just like any other element in web design — you need your typeface to blend with the overall personality of the website and sometimes the most basic and popular fonts won’t do.\n\nHillenberg is a font family with 10 different vintage styles. The one you see above looks like something out of the Old West. There are grunge fonts that can give your site’s lettering a rustic, wood-carved look. There are lined fonts that might make your text look like an old Hollywood marquee.\n\nIf you’re playing around with different retro styles, this is a good font to check out as it has a variety of options built in.\n\nLazer 84 calls to mind a very specific time period: The 80s. Roadhouse. Child’s Play. Baywatch. It wasn’t uncommon to see brushed fonts used at the start of movies or TV shows back then.\n\nIf you find yourself designing a website for a company formed in the 80s that wants to play upon the styles of that time, this font would work great for your titling and headers. You could also use it for any tech-friendly website with a retro video game look to it (think Street Fighter).\n\nIn 2013, the designer of Exo decided that it was time to give the futuristic-looking font a facelift, and thus, Exo 2 was born.\n\nThe two fonts are nearly identical geometric sans serifs. The main difference between them is that Exo 2 isn’t as stretched out and has softer edges, which improves the readability of the font. Although Exo 2 does have a futuristic edge to it, it’s still a clean font that would do well on a variety of websites trying to make a powerful statement.\n\nThere are actually a number of Noir fonts out there. This Pro Noir font, however, comes with 12 fonts, so you have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you use it.\n\nThe light version of the font — which you see above — is a simple sans serif that could realistically be used anywhere on a website. On the other hand, the dramatic bold and heavy styles could be used to create titles and logos that resemble old film noir marquees.\n\nPrivus is a neat geometric font that comes in three styles. The one you see here is called “Light”. Really, though, it turns each character into a maze. Then, there’s the “Medium” font, which is a heavily outlined font with random openings in the characters. And “Bold” is a large, filled font.\n\nIf you’re looking to do something creative with your titles or logos, this font has a lot to offer. You could use just one of the distinctive styles or layer two of them for an unusual optical effect.\n\nTimeBurner is an interesting font. While it’s easy to read thanks to the geometric lines and curves that make up the letters, there are unique twists throughout.\n\nThe lowercase “e”, for instance, comes up short on the end. It doesn’t appear incomplete, it just looks as though a certain segment length was used to complete the bottom of the letter. That same segment appears to be the tail in the letter “g” as well. Your visitors and readers might not pick up on that specific detail, but they’ll certainly take notice of this eye-catching font.\n\nThere are tens of thousands of fonts available online. Narrowing down the choices and finding the ones that will fit your website the best, can be challenging, but, luckily, this guide will aid you in the process.\n\nWhen choosing fonts, remember that you should aim to pair no more than two or three for each website you design. This will give your interface a consistent look from start to finish, which helps strengthen brand recognizability. It will also encourage readers to focus on reading what’s written as opposed to marveling over all the crazy selection of fonts littering your pages.\n\nFor additional guidance on how to choose the right font for your website, read this comprehensive article. And when you find the font that’s right for you, you’ll learn that adding custom fonts to WordPress is an easy task, especially with Elementor."
