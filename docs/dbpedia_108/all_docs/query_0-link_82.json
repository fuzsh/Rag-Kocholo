When used right, they fit in well with almost any type of design. Here are a few tips on proper condensed fonts usage.\n\n1. Use Sans-Serif Fonts\n\nCondensed and narrow fonts are often used in creative and modern designs, especially for crafting titles and subheadings. However, they are also a great choice for paragraphs and body text as well.\n\nThe key is to choose the right condensed font. Since condensed fonts have narrow spacing, they tend to make long paragraphs a bit hard to read. As a result, it’s a good practice to use condensed sans-serif fonts for paragraphs to improve readability and reduce clutter.\n\n2. Create Big and Bold Titles\n\nCondensed fonts are best used for titles and headings. Especially when you’re trying to capture the user’s attention with a big bold title, a narrow font is a perfect choice for achieving that goal. Go as big as you want and create designs that turns more heads.\n\n3. Find the Right Font Pair\n\nUnlike when using regular fonts styles, you need to pick and pair fonts more carefully when using condensed fonts. Finding the perfect secondary font to match the narrow designs of your title font will require some effort.\n\nWhen looking for a font to pair with a condensed font, you don’t need to find another condensed font. In fact, a regular sans-serif font often pairs well with a narrow font. You can use fonts with different styles and weights as well. Find a pair that makes it easier to differentiate between titles and paragraphs.\n\n4. Pick a Font Family\n\nIt’s always a good idea to pick up a font family when using condensed fonts as they include the font in multiple styles and different weights. This way you can use the same style of font for both your titles and subheadings using variations of weights.\n\n5. Use Fonts That Match the Design Theme\n\nEven condensed and narrow fonts come in various styles and designs. For example, there are condensed fonts with fun and quirky designs that are most suitable for designs yoy make for children. Then there are fonts with elegant serif designs that are perfect for luxury brands.\n\nWhen choosing condensed and narrow fonts, consider using fonts that match the overall theme of your design or project."
