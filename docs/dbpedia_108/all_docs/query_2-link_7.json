        "text": "I'm looking for a font for the base of a corporate logo - a clean, fairly geometric, sharp sans-serif (Helvetica-esque, basically).\n\nMy specific unusual requirement for one of my ideas is that the capital A has a square or square-ish top and vertical sides, rather than a pointed triangle. So, for example, the lower two-thirds of the A should resemble a H, and the window in the A should be a little similar to that of a P except symmetrical (either rounded or square is fine).\n\nThis is fairly unusual, and I know I'm going to have to do quite a lot of modifications, but I'm cautiously optimistic that there's something out there which would serve as a good base and minimise the amount of font-hacking I need to do. If I can't find anything, I'll experiment with hacking something together using a suitable font's H and P.\n\nA great answer would be either:\n\nA font with this sort of A in as close as possible to the above simple, clean, geometrically balanced, corporate style\n\nOr, better still, some reliable steps I can take to filter my font browsing to fonts with this type of A. So far, I've not found any way to do this.\n\nTo give one example, Nova Square (thanks PieBie) has the type of A shape I'm looking for - but it's too much of a sci-fi-ish typeface than the clean sharp corporate look I'm aiming for:\n\nHere's a crude example I made earlier:"
