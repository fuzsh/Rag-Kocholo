        "text": "On Font Weight\n\n1. Example: Lucida Basic font weights.\n\nLucida Basic font weight names combine traditional weight names with CSS font-weight numbers.\n\nThe combination of a name + number specifies weights within each Lucida style and also coordinates weights and names between different Lucida families.\n\nNames like “UltraThin”, “Thin”, “Normal”, and “Black” suggest the visual impression of each weight. Corresponding CSS numbers, 100, 200, 400, and 800, respectively, indicate that each weight in the list is twice as dark as the previous one.\n\nOther progressions are also definable in this naming method. For example, in the series of Normal (400), Bold (600), and ExtraBlack (900), each successive weight is 1.5 times as dark as the previous one.\n\nThe many gradations of weight in Lucida allow a typographer or graphic designer to choose different kinds of weight progressions for different contexts, different printing methods, different display methods, from ebooks to display screens of different resolutions.\n\nThis table shows the series of weight names and numerical designations.\n\nIn this naming system, when several weights in one style \"suite\" are installed, they will usually sort by relative weight, so users can see an orderly gamut of weights and choose a desired weight more easily.\n\nOther examples of Lucida font weight series can be seen at:\n\nLucida Matrix\n\nLucida Sans Suite\n\nLucida Sans Texts\n\nGray tone of text. The ratio of the thickness of vertical stems in letters like ‘l’ to its font x-height is a way that type designers measure relative weights. In Lucida Lite (Light) weight, the x-height is 7.3 times the vertical stem thickness. In Lucida normal weight, the x-height is 5.5 times the vertical stem thickness. In Lucida bold, the x-height is 3.7 times the vertical stem thickness. As weight goes up, the stem/x-height ratio goes down. This method is a good rule-of-thumb, but the bolder weights are not as visually bold as the number indicate.\n\nA more accurate way to indicate visual weight is to measure actual ink coverage of each weight, or, for modern digital devices, the percentage of black pixels in the total area of the typeface body when the font is set solid, that is, with no extra leading or inter-line spacing. This may be more difficult to measure, but gives a more precise estimation of the graphical facts. A third method, which typographers have used for five hundred years, is to estimate weight by eye and use a name descriptive enough to convey the visual impression. That is how we get names like “light”, “bold”, and “black” to denote what are essentially all tones of gray.\n\nCSS # weight\n\nStandard CSS weight steps are multiples of 100, including 200, 300, 400, 500, and so on up to 900. For some usages, however, particularly in body text, finer increments are needed to fine-tune tone and readability. Therefore, several Lucida weight steps are offered in finer increments: 150, 250, 350, 375, 425, 450, 550, 650, 999 (this last is really 1,000, but some systems and applications don’t recognize four digit CSS weight numbers.\n\nWhy do the Lucida fonts offer more weight gradations?\n\nTo allow UI designers, graphic designers, and typographers to tune text and display tones and readability in a wide range of contexts. By choosing from among fine gradations of light and dark weights, a designer can adjust users’ perceptions of text. The goal is not “thin” or “fat” typography but readable typography.\n\nExtremes. Ultrathin (100) on the light end and UltraBlack (999) on the dark end are the current extremes of the Lucida weight gamut. Maximum weight is ten times minimum weight, offering a dramatic range of expressiveness, from fashionably thin to powerfully bold.\n\nMain text. Lucida fonts offer finely graded weights for main text, also called running text or body text in a normal reading range. The central weights are Book (350), Text (375), Normal (400), Thick (425), and ExtraThick (450) weights. These subtle gradations enable designers to fine-tune the tone of text in different technical and expressive contexts, for different polarities (black on white versus white on black), colors, and backgrounds, and for different resolutions and technologies of screen displays as well as different printing technologies and paper qualities. The visual impact of a typeface can vary substantially in different contexts. For instance, text in reverse polarity, dropped out of a black or colored background, is more effective if its weight is slightly darker than the weight in black on weight. The fine gradations of Lucida weights permits subtle adjustments.\n\nCSS # versus Pixel %. Weight increments measured by stem to x-height ratios, as expressed in the Lucida CSS weight numbers, are not quite the same as increments expressed by pixel counts. In the CSS weight numeration of Lucida Sans, the Lite (Light) weight of 300 is 75% of the Normal weight of 400, and the Bold weight of 600 is 150% darker than the normal weight, while the Black weight 800 is 200% (twice) the weight of Normal 400. All very exact.\n\nHowever, tonal values measured as pixel percentages show a lesser weight progression. Lucida Lite (Light) weight is roughly 75% of the Normal weight, but the Bold weight is only 132% darker than the normal weight, and the Black weight is only 158% darker than the Normal weight, not 200%.\n\nWhy the difference between the two methods of measure? Because the x-height/stem ratio doesn’t take into account other particularities of type design, including white areas above the x-line and below the base-line, x-height, letter widths, or spaces inside and surrounding the letters. In many type designs, bold weights are somewhat wider than normal weights, thus reducing the emboldening effect of increased stem thicknesses.\n\nPerception of weight. The final perception of a type design is the image in the mind of the reader, as Adrian Frutiger once said. And so it is with type weight, too. Numbers are essential in practical typography, but ultimately the typographic designer’s goal is to create an image in the mind of the reader, and that is still a difficult and mysterious task. That is why experienced and altruistic typographers are needed to assess the visual impressions of typographic compositions. To envision the experience of the reader and estimate the legibility of text, designers are not always right, nor are weight calculation invariably accurate, but designers and engineers must do their best for readers. As renowned Swiss typography teacher Emil Ruder wrote nearly 50 years ago: “Typography has one plain duty before it, and that is to convey information in writing.” And he wrote this warning: “There is a standing temptation for the typographer to use his type primarily as a tone of grey and thus to allot it a purely aesthetic and decorative role. It is a sign of immaturity to use a grey surface or a grey tone as a basis for a design into which the typography has to fit as best it can.”\n\n2. A Short History of Type Weights\n\nDifferences in typeface weight have been recognized and named by printers and typographers for over five centuries. In English typographic terminology, the earliest weight distinction was between the gothic styles called “black-letter” (or “black letter”, “blackletter”) used in early English printing by William Caxton, compared to the roman style, developed in Italy, particularly by Nicolas Jenson in Venice 147-1480, which early English printers called “white-letter” (or “white letter”). Some roman types were slightly lighter or darker than others, and some blackletter types slightly lighter or darker than others, but by and large, blackletters were darker than white-letters- more ink on the page. However, printers’ choices between gothic or roman, blackletter or white-letter, were not motivated by weight but by style.\n\nFor cultural reasons, principally the intellectual and artistic hegemony of Italian Renaissance typographic fashion, roman replaced gothic in several countries over two centuries: in Italy by the late 15th century; in France by the early to-mid 16th century; and in England by the late 16th century, and in the Low Countries, Belgium and Holland, at about the same time as in England, or not long after (except for beer :-).\n\nToday, most readers in the Americas and Europe are accustomed to roman types. Most readers of roman would say it is more legible than gothic, yet gothic remained popular in German speaking countries and regions until the 20th century. Gothic types have survived and in many cases have thrived in several contexts, particularly in beer labels and signs in Flemish, Dutch, and German-speaking countries, and also in Mexico. During the Christmas holiday season, typography in English-speaking countries goes gothic and blackletter, when Old English textura and other styles of English blackletter, like the Burgundian Bâtarde used by Caxton, make their annual comeback. From Thanksgiving to New Year’s day in America, blackletter becomes surprisingly legible to roman type readers. God rest you merry, Gentlemen.\n\nIn the 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution gained steam in England, new uses arose for typography in the marketing and advertising of manufactured goods. Typefounders responded by founding more faces for “display” typography, including advertising, posters, handbills, labeling, and ephemera. Among the new promotional type styles were roman faces of heavier weight, surpassing the old gothic blackletters in darkness but still roman in structure. In the vanguard were the so-called “Fat Faces”, which had pronounced thick-thin contrast like Bodoni or Didot designs on steroids. Then came heavy weights with slab-serif faces, the “Antiques” and “Egyptians”, nearly monotonic in stroke thicknesses. Also there were heavy weights of sans-serifs, structurally more like slab-serif faces lacking serifs than roman book faces with the serifs cut off. Related to the Egyptians was a seriffed style called “Ionic”, which had bracketed serifs and a little more contrast between thick and thin than the Egyptians. Following Ionic, the first “Clarendon” typefaces was released in 1845. It was heavy, like many slab-serif faces, but its serifs had bracketing, like Ionic. Clarendon faces began to be used with normal weight roman text faces for headings, emphasis, and other distinctions from the roman text faces. In the early 20th century, typefounders began to integrate bold weights into families of normal weight romans and italics. The Cheltenham and Century families by Morris Fuller Benton for American Typefounders are notable examples.\n\nBy mid-20th century, most new text type families included at least one roman bold weight, and by the late 20th century, most new type families, as well as revivals of older classic faces like Garamond or Baskerville, included two or more bold weights, with names like “semi-bold” and “bold”, or “bold and extra-bold”, with italics of matching weight. In the 21st century, new typeface families often have four or more weight gradations.\n\nTypeface weight names\n\nTypeface weights have mostly been named on the basis of subjective impression, using metaphorical words like “normal, “semi-bold”, “demibold”, “bold”, “extra-bold”, “heavy”, “black”, and so on. Names like these give an ordinal sense of boldness within a type family. Intuitively, “bold” is darker than “semi-bold”, and “extra-bold” is darker than “bold”. However, even after a century of naming bold weights, there is still no standardization between type families, such that the bold of one family will be the same weight as the bold of another family. The “”demibold” of one font family could be heavier than the “bold” of another family. Or not.\n\nTwentieth century German typographic nomenclature included several named weight gradations, including “mager” (thin), “leicht” (light), “buch” (book [weight]), “normal\" (normal), “stark” (strong), “kräftig\" (hefty), \"viertelfett\" (quarter-bold), \"halbfett\" (half-bold), \"dreiviertelfett\" (three-quarter-bold), \"fett\" (bold), and “extrafett” (extra bold). Not all of these were used within a given family. As with English type weight names, there was no standard of use of the German weight names between families. These were, and still are, impressionistic, not numerically calibrated weights.\n\nFat. The German type weight terms were borrowed from common items, especially edibles and particularly dairy products. “Dreiviertelfett” in German is used of margarine, cheese, and other items containing fat or weight, and also of typefaces with visual weight (e.g. Venus, Folio, Futura. Viertelfett was used of cheese, margarine, and typefaces (e.g. Helvetica). Halbfett also of cheese, margarine, typefaces (e.g. Helvetica, Neuzeit, Optima, Palatino, etc.). Extrafett could describe creams as well as typefaces (e.g. Syntax, Folio, Helvetica, etc.).\n\nIn traditional French typographic nomenclature, weight locutions are similar. “Graisse”, meaning “fatness” in general, is equivalent to English “weight” in type terms, and the weight gamut includes several terms based on the adjective “gras” for fat: “maigre” (thin), “normal” (normal), “demi-gras” (demibold), “gras” (bold), “extra-gras” (extra bold). There appears to be some shifting in recent years, so perhaps our French colleagues will let us know the latest.\n\nIt may seem odd to equate the amount of black in a typeface with the amount of fat in a cheese, but once we take into account traditional printers’ anthropomorphic terminology in talking about a type “face” or “body”, then the metaphor between “weight” on a type and weight on a person seems natural.\n\nBut, typeface weight is not necessarily based on fat. In Italian, from which we get wonderful terms of art like “chiaroscuro”, typographic weight names denoted grades of light and dark, like “chiaro” (light), “neretto” (bold), “nero” (black), “nerissimo” (ultrablack).\n\nUnivers decimal weights. In his Univers typeface family, launched in 1957 and designed for universal use in many countries, Adrian Frutiger broke with traditional weight names, which vary from language to language, and devised a two-digit decimal system of naming for consistency across languages, cultures, and nations. In Univers, light roman weight is designated “45”, normal “55”, bold “65”, black “75”, and extra black “85”. Nearly two decades later, the Frutiger family was launched with the same designation system, adding “95” as ultra black. Linotype launched the Neue Helvetica family using the same system, in which “25” designates ultra light, “35” thin, and “95” black. In Univers Next, launched in 1997, the weight gamut and decimal numbering system were extend with an additional digit, “130” became ultralight, “230” thin, “330” light, “430” basic, “530” medium, “630” bold, “730” heavy, “830” black, and “930” extra black. For typographers accustomed to the earlier two-digit naming, the three-digit system requires some extra learning. Neue Frutiger, launched in 1999, and Frutiger Next in 2000 did not continue the decimal nomenclature.\n\nNormalcy. There is no standard for “normal” weight, that which would be used for running text in books, magazines, newspapers, or on digital screens of computers, tablets, phones, watches, e-books, automotive displays, and other electronic texts.\n\n“Normal” weights nonetheless fall into a fairly narrow range. For Latin typefaces, their “black” coverage ranges between 15% to around 22%, as measured by the black area (ink or pixels) of the letters within the white area surrounding and inside the letters at their nominal body size, with no leading or extra line spacing.\n\nFor old-style seriffed book faces like Garamond and Caslon, the black percentage is around 16%, give or take a few percent. For 20th century sans-serifs, such as Helvetica or Lucida, and for recent fonts designed for screen display, which tend to have bigger x-heights and heavier thin strokes, the normal weights tend to be darker, around 20%-22% black, give or take a few percent. Old-style book faces were designed for letterpress printing, which deposits more ink on paper and thickens the image though ink-squash around the edges of characters, so letterpress printed texts are slightly darker than modern outline renderings of the fonts would indicate. Some modern sans-serif faces, which became popular in offset lithographic printing are darker than the classical book faces because their slightly heavier weights were not attenuated by the thinner ink films and slight attenuation of lithographic rendering.\n\nDepending on imaging technology and anti-aliasing algorithms, typefaces on screen displays may be slightly darkened or lightened. For example, on brightly back-lighted high-resolution digital displays, it may be necessary to darken a typeface slightly in order to make it look more like its printed rendering. When Apple moved to “Retina” displays, which on laptops have resolutions of 220 pixels per inch instead of the old CRT resolutions around 72 pixels per inch, Bigelow & Holmes created a slightly darker Lucida Grande Bold weight for Retina displays. The new bold weight was only 4% darker than the old, but that was enough to restore the apparent degree of “boldness”.\n\nBoldness. Just as there is no standard for “normal” weight across typeface families, there is no standard for “bold” weight. Within a typeface family, boldness is relative to “normal” weight. As seen in the table above, boldness can be expressed as a percentage of gray tone or as a ratio between stem thicknesses, or as a visual judgment.\n\nRelated to findings in the psychophysics of sensory quantities like physical weight, brightness, or loudness, differences in typeface “boldness” seem to follow a progression based on a multiplicative factor. For many typefaces, the minimum factor for the difference between normal and bold weight is around 1.3 to 1.5, depending on method of measurement. Measured by ratio of stem thickness to x-height, the minimum step for a noticeably bold weight is a factor around 1.5 times the normal stem/x-height. That is, if the normal weight stem is a unit of 1.0, then the bold is around 1.5 units. The next major step in weight, say between bold and black, is roughly 1.5 times the bold, or between 2.0 times the weight of “normal” to around 2.25 times the normal stem thickness.\n\nDesigners may prefer a greater degrees of boldness, to make sure it is noticeably more emphatic than normal, but not so bold that it is distracting in text.\n\nUsing the stem/x-height ratio, Lucida Grande Bold is 1.5 x Lucida Grande regular. Palatino Bold is 1.54 x Palatino normal. Arial Bold is 1.6 times x Arial regular. Times Roman Bold is 1.7 x Times Roman normal. Baskerville Bold is 1.8 x Baskerville normal (depending on version of Baskerville). Verdana Bold is 1.9 x Verdana regular. Microsoft’s ClearType fonts, designed for improved screen display technology, tend to have bold weights between 1.5 to 1.7 times the respective normal weights.\n\nIf we switch from measurements based on stem/x-height ratios to black-to-white coverage based on black/white pixel percentages, measure is a bit more complicated (no pun intended) but gives results in decimal percentages.\n\nTonal values measured as pixel percentages show a lesser factor of increase. For example, Lucida Lite (Light) weight is 25% lighter than the Normal weight, in both stem/x-height ratio and in black pixel percentage, but in the progression from normal to blacker weights, the Bold weight is only 28% darker than the normal weight, not 50%, and the Black weight is only 37% darker than the Normal weight, not 100%. The exact percentages are influenced by the structure of the design, the x-height, the details of terminals and serifs, the letter fitting, and other factors determined by type designers.\n\nDefinitely bolder versus just noticeably bolder. As discussed above, weights that are“definitely bolder” than normal weight are around 1.5 times normal to 1.3 times normal, depending on the kind of measurement. What about the “just-noticeable difference” or JND used by psychophysicists? How small a difference in typeface weight is just barely noticeable to users or readers? In a small scale study we found that the just-noticeable weight difference for a lower-case sans serif typeface was approximately 3%. Some subjects didn’t detect that small a difference, but more of them did. This accords fairly well with our industrial experience. When our studio developed a minimally darker “bold” weight of Lucida Grande for Macintosh “Retina” displays, the increased darkness was roughly 4%. The small weight increase was just enough that interface designers could notice and prefer the difference, but not so much that average users noticed anything amiss.\n\nA just-noticeable difference is a percept with little or no contextual meaning, being barely detectable, but a definitely noticeable difference carries semantic weight; it distinguishes one sort of text from another, emphasizes a meaning, denotes a definition, keys a topic, indexes a list or a table. Therefore, typographers and interface designers want that difference to be noticeable. In practical typography, type size is another dimension of noticeability, so when a typographer wants something to be clearly more than definitely different, bigger sizes is compounded with bolder weight.\n\nIn summary: what do we know?\n\nDo we know what type weight is the ideal “normal”? No.\n\nDo we know what weight is the ideal “bold”? No.\n\nDo we know how many weights can be used for all desired shades of authorial meaning while enabling readers to understand all the differences? No.\n\nDo we know which design ideology should be our sole guide? Not hardly, as John Wayne would say.\n\nAll these questions must still be determined by context, experiment, visual judgment, analysis and intuition. Weight numbers definitely help, and they are getting better the more we study them, but so far, they remain at best, signs on the road to understanding, not our destination.\n\nBigelow & Holmes\n\nNote: We are grateful to Rolf Rehe for his helpful and amusing comments on the “fett” adjectives in everyday and typographic German.\n\n© 2015\n\nBig News: Women on the Money!\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has just announced that a portrait of a woman will appear on the $10 bill. Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew will make the choice by the end of the year.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/us/portrait-of-a-woman-to-share-space-on-the-dollar-10-bill-with-hamiltons.html\n\nSupport the woman nominee of your choice, and keep those cards and letters pouring in to the Treasury!\n\nA woman on the ten dollar bill would be a great milestone, but we ought to run the numbers to see how much the Treasury really values that woman. First, the woman will have to share the $10 with Alexander Hamilton: she will appear on only half the bills. Second, the $10 bill is worth only half the $20 bill. Third, there are four time more $20 bills in circulation than $10 bills (2 billion $10s versus 8 billion $20s). Hence, the woman will appear on a half of a half of a fourth - only one-sixteenth - of the 160 billion bucks that Andy Jackson commands on the $20. Is that fair?\n\nIt’s disturbingly similar to the total compensation of the thirteen women compared to that of the 187 men among the 200 best paid American chief executives, around one-sixteenth. It’s almost like Treasurer Jacob Lew adjusted the woman’s place on the currency to match the gender imbalance of American executive compensation. Maybe he didn’t want to embarrass the boys’ club by letting a woman look more valuable than the lads.\n\nThe WomenOn20s site, which was mentioned several weeks ago in Part 1 of this essay, announced in May that its voters (600,000 in all) chose abolitionist, underground railroad conductor, and suffragist Harriet Tubman to be their candidate for the first woman on the $20 dollar bill.\n\nhttp://www.womenon20s.org/meet_the_winner\n\nHere is what literate and witty Gail Collins, NY Times columnist (also former NYT editorial page editor and author of America’s Women) says about Tubman versus Jackson.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/opinion/gail-collins-tubman-versus-jackson.html\n\n(For Part 1 of this essay on Women's Literation, see:\n\nhttp://bigelowandholmes.typepad.com/bigelow-holmes/2015/05/womens-literation-part-1.html )\n\nOK, enough about money, now back to literacy and women’s rights.\n\nWhy spend more time on this subject?\n\nFirst, as a fundamental precept of human rights, women should have access to education equal to what men have, and where the State supports education, it has the obligation to educate girls equally as well as boys, women as well as men.\n\nSecond, out of sheer self-interest, anyone who works in the typographic industry should favor women’s literacy because it potentially doubles the size of the market for books, magazines, newspapers, fonts, and related forms of information exchange mediated through literacy, including social media and search. Moreover, in commerce, women’s literacy has a multiplier effect because women are the major consumers in modern literate society: they buy not only for themselves but on behalf of others in their families. Women make decisions on major family purchases of new cars, homes, health care, vacations, and other big-ticket items. In modern societies, information that influences buying decisions is often conveyed through literacy, including package labeling, signage, reviews, and advertising.\n\nWhether one’s motivation is morality or money, women’s literacy is a key factor in success.\n\nPart 1 of this essay traced connections between education of women in the 19th century and achievement of women’s suffrage in the early 20th century in Britain and America. The pattern for Britain and America was that women’s literation came first, followed by educated women agitating for the vote and eventually getting it, but one or two generations (40 to 50 years) after universal education had been instituted for girls as well as boys.\n\nBut is the Anglo-American pattern a fluke? Does it apply to other countries?\n\nIn modernizing, industrializing European nations, the sequence from women’s literacy to women’s suffrage is often similar to the Anglo-American pattern, but around the world, in countries formed from former colonies, former kingdoms or empires, or derived other political structures, the sequences and outcomes of women’s literation often differ.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\nFRANCE: the Gallic approach to women’s literacy and suffrage\n\nIn France, as was true in western and European civilization since antiquity, the aristocracy was generally more literate than lower classes, and in each social class, women were less literate than men. The lowest literacy rates were among women in the laboring class and rural populations. France differed in politics, religion, culture, and industry from Britain, but literacy disparities between men and women were not dissimilar. In the 19th century France, literacy rates for men ranged, roughly, from 20% to 60%, and for women, 10% to 35%, with a great deal of variation depending on urban versus rural location, social class, and geographic region.\n\nBefore the French Revolution, and for several decades afterwards, primary schooling in France had been provided and administered mainly by the Catholic Church. After the Revolution, French Republican (revolutionary) politicians favored secular education as part of a broader conflict between radical and conservative ideologies. Radicals and Republicans were anti-clerical and anti-monarchist, hence and supported free, secular public education for a secular society. Political conservatives, favoring the church and monarchy, believed that education administered through the church would better inculcate traditional religious and political values. This opposition was not unique to France or to the 18th and 19th centuries. Similar disputes over secular and religious education remain rife in many countries today, albeit involving different religions and political systems.\n\nWhether secular or religious, public or private, the number of primary schools in France did increase during the 19th century and gradually raised literacy rates for men, but not as much for women; girls were still excluded from education during much of the century.\n\nBut, after almost a century of debate on education, in 1881 and 1882, the French parliament passed two laws that established universal, free, secular, and mandatory elementary schooling for girls as well as boys. These laws are often called the “Jules Ferry” laws after the minister of public instruction credited with their creation and implementation.\n\nFrench hopes for public schooling resembled those that motivated the British Education Act. One goal was to strengthen France in international industrial competition by educating industrial workers, who, it was asserted, needed more education than farmers. An urgent goal was to raise the human quality of France’s armed forces, which had suffered a humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, when the Prussian military was better organized, better led, and used more modern transportation (railroad) and communication (telegraph) than French forces. A third goal of education was to reinforce the French political system by providing a literate electorate. A related goal, for the Republicans, was to strengthen the secular state with secular education, thereby diminishing the power of the conservative church and its monarchist supporters.\n\nIf, like Britain and America, France had a fifty year gap between girls education and women’s suffrage, it would have instituted women’s suffrage around 1932, fifty years after the Jules Ferry laws were passed. In the event, women's suffrage was not passed in France until 1944, and the first national elections in which women could generally vote was in 1945, sixty-three years after the second Jules Ferry law of 1882.\n\nFrance, which had declared the “Rights of man and of the citizen” in 1789, in the French Revolution against the old monarchist regime, did not get around to recognizing women’s rights until 1944, some 155 years later.\n\nThat was not because France lacked outstanding literate women during those years. In the 19th century, George Sand (pseudonym of Aurore Dupin) was a famous novelist notable also for her non-conformist life style. Her contemporary, Flora Tristan was a prolific writer and campaigner for women’s rights and socialism, but died relatively young and is less well remembered outside of France, but Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa wrote a novel about her and her grandson, Paul Gauguin.\n\nIn the early 20th century, there was the popular novelist Colette, probably best known in the US for her novel Gigi, which was made into a musical and popular film starring Maurice Chevalier, Louis Jourdan, and Leslie Caron in the title role. Très French. Colette was also notorious for her liberated life style.\n\nMost relevant to this essay is France’s pre-eminent feminist philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir, the peer of France’s most celebrated philosophers and intellectuals, including her long-time partner, Jean-Paul Sartre, and others of their time, including philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty and anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. Despite her brilliant intellect and achievements, De Beauvoir was not able to vote until she was 37. Her influential feminist treatise The Second Sex, was published in 1949.\n\nGERMANY: the Prussian approach\n\nIt is more difficult to chart the course of elementary education of girls in Germany because there was a great deal of variation among the different German states prior to the unification of Germany in 1871 (achieved after Prussia’s defeat of France). Among the various, independent German states, Prussia took an early lead in education as well as in warfare. During the first half of the 19th century, Prussia established free primary schooling, including girls and boys, and promoted professionally trained school teachers, state funded schools, and secular education. Higher education for girls was, however, limited by the conservative German attitude toward women’s education expressed in the old maxim: ”Kinder, Küche, Kirche” maxim (“Children, Kitchen, Church”).\n\nNevertheless, secondary schools for girls were established in Prussia in 1872. Some 46 years later, women’s suffrage in Germany was established near the end of World War I, in 1918, after Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated and the German Imperial government was replaced by a revolutionary government. The first German national elections in which women could vote were in 1919, nearly the same time as in Britain and America, but a quarter-century ahead of France.\n\nOTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES\n\nSome European countries established women’s suffrage in advance of England and Germany, while others lagged behind, some far behind.\n\nScandinavia\n\nIn accord with the socially progressive proclivities of Scandinavian societies, Finland instituted women’s suffrage in 1906; Norway in 1913, Denmark in 1915. Sweden allowed women some voting rights in the 18th century but rescinded them in 1771. In 1862, Sweden restored the right to vote in municipal elections to tax-paying women who were unmarried, divorced, or widowed. (Married women had to let their husbands do the voting.) National women’s suffrage was not instituted until 1919, in time for the national election in 1921.\n\nIn several countries, women’s suffrage was established around the end of WWI or WWII. Profound disruptions of society followed by establishments of new social or political orders seemed to favor women’s suffrage: Poland, in 1918; Netherlands, in 1919; Italy, in 1946; Belgium, in 1948; Greece, in 1944 (partial), and fully in 1952.\n\nFormer British colonies had established some levels of women’s suffrage before Britain itself: New Zealand in 1893; Australia in 1901-1902, Canada in 1917-1918. Apparently, women’s suffrage was more easily established in countries distant from the main European and American nexuses of power.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSwitzerland lagged behind in women’s suffrage, but in literacy, Switzerland was one of the first countries in Europe to institute free, compulsory, primary schools. By the late 19th century, most Swiss women were literate, and Swiss women had begun to petition the government for the right to vote. Women increased their efforts in the early 20th century, notably at the time of the Swiss General Strike in 1918.\n\nDespite Switzerland’s early and progressive efforts in education, women’s literacy alone did not soon result in women’s suffrage. It took a hundred years. The campaign for suffrage became mired in male bureaucracy at the federal level, and male voters were generally against it.\n\nAs a nominally neutral country that did not directly experience the upheaval of war and social disruption, the Swiss temporized on the issue of women voting, even in face of renewed demands at the end of WWII. In 1959. two-thirds of Swiss voters (all men, of course) rejected women’s suffrage. It seems remarkable that the birthplace of Helvetica - that clean, orderly, precise, sober paragon of progressive typography, the graphical emblem of the corporate information age - remained a decisively sexist bastion even in the liberated swinging ‘60s. While Swiss typography was aesthetically conquering Europe and America, patient Swiss women back at home were denied the right to vote at the federal level until 1971. It suggests that the dangerous actions of English and American suffragettes may not have been ineffective in advancing the vote.\n\nThese short histories have touched only on Anglo-American and European literacy and suffrage. What about Asia? Let's look at the fascinating subject of literacy and gender in Japan.\n\nJAPAN\n\nWomen have been literate in Japan for more than 1,000 years but did not receive the right to vote until 1946, under pressure from the occupying American forces determined to reform aspects of Japanese society after WWII. In traditional Japan, as in Western societies, literate women in Japan were principally members of the nobility. The first, and perhaps the greatest, Japanese novel, the Tale of Genji (Genji Monogotari) was written perhaps a few years after 1,000 AD by a noblewoman known by her pseudonym, Murasaki Shikibu (Lady Murasaki, or literally, “Lady Purple”).\n\nYaeko Sato Habein, in The History of the Japanese Written Language, University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, 1984, writes that \"Genji Monogotari is the most widely studied and best-known tale of the Heian period, or perhaps, of the entire history of Japanese literature.\"\n\nYasunari Kawabata, Japanese novelist and Nobel laureate in literature, said: \"The Tale of Genji in particular is the highest pinnacle of Japanese literature. Even down to our day there has not been a piece of fiction to compare with it\". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji\n\nMurasaki Shikibu, as a literate woman in the sophisticated Heian period of medieval Japan, wrote in a cursive Japanese syllabic script called Hiragana. Derived from cursive Chinese brush writing, Hiragana represented only the syllables of spoken Japanese, not the words represented in borrowings of Chinese logographic script. The relatively small numbers of syllables in Japanese are represented by some 50 characters in Hiragana (augmented by some diacritics and digraphs), contrasted with the thousands of kanji characters based on Chinese logograms which educated Japanese men wrote.\n\nWhen Lady Murasaki wrote her great novel, kanji was men's writing, and hiragana was women's writing. This gender distinction and discrimination excluded many women from the Chinese literature read by men, but aristocratic women nevertheless became skilled at writing poetry and prose fiction and were sophisticated in the art of personal correspondence. Calligraphic skill was a much-prized accomplishment of aristocratic women and contributed greatly to their aura of attractiveness, as memorably described in The Tale of Genji.\n\nCalligraphic elegance as a major contribution to a woman’s attractiveness is a distinctly alien notion in contemporary American media, where the alleged attractiveness of female celebrities, actresses, and super-models is hardly based on their handwriting. (It must be admitted, however, that the Kardashians have done wonders in popularizing the use of the letter ‘K’ in trash magazines. The letter K is only the 22nd letter in frequency of usage, only 0.69% in text (ignoring the difference between frequency of capital and lower-case), but the Kardashians must surely have vaulted K up several levels in frequency in supermarket check-stand celebrity magazines and tabloids.)\n\nOver several centuries, the kanji and hiragana scripts ceased to be discriminated by gender and instead were been merged into a complex writing system. The logographic kanji characters are used for nouns, verb stems, adjective stems, and some adverbs, while the syllabic hiragana characters are used for particle words and inflectional prefixes and suffixes to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. To over-simplify it, the different scripts are used for different parts of speech.\n\nKanji is used for most lexical words and hiragana for most grammatical particles and part-words. In addition to kanji and hiragana, another syllabary, katakana, which represents the same syllables as hiragana but looks different, was originally used for exegesis of Buddhist texts, but has also become a component in standard Japanese writing where it is used for foreign words. Yet another script, romaji - Latin characters and numerals - has also been merged into the system for use in signage, acronyms, and company names. A fifth category of Japanese written symbol, emoji (“picture characters”) includes smile faces, hearts, arrows, icons, animals, faces and other characters to signify common objects, events, instruments, emotions, and other accoutrements of daily life. (See: Janet Shibamoto Smith, \"Japanese Writing\" in Peter Daniels and William Bright, The World's Writing Systems, Oxford U. Press, 1996.\n\nAlthough the Japanese writing system has become rich and complex by absorbing and adapting different scripts, that has not hampered literacy nor the growth of a modern high-technology society in modern Japan. When General MacArthur was the “Gaijin Shogun” (officially, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) in post-war Japan, a group of American educators advocated abolition of the “Chinese-derived ideograms” in favor of the alphabet, without which Japan would never achieve technological parity with the West. Ah, educators, what would we do without them? The Japanese did adopt the Latin alphabet but also kept their traditional writing. Now Americans are adopting emoticons and emoji.\n\nhttp://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/the-rise-of-emoji-on-instagram-is-causing-language-repercussions/\n\nThe number of emoji has increased to more than 800, although emoji frequency of usage is unclear; possibly it follows Zipf’s Law. For example, take a look at the hundreds of “Apple Color Emoji” in Apple OS X. Developed in the modern technological consumer era, these icons have a toy-like, commercial, fun graphical look compared to the far older, formal brush-written scripts that long ago diverged from iconic forms.\n\nIn terms of character frequency in printed text, kanji characters range from slightly more than fifty percent of printed Japanese text, to slightly less than twenty-five percent, depending on the nature of the text and the literary register. Kanji usage is in inverse proportion to hiragana and katakana, but the relative proportions vary according to context. Publications of general interest and government publication may contain more than fifty percent kanji, but in magazines specifically for men or for women the percentage of kanji may fall below thirty percent. (See: http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/2005/Tomoda.html)\n\nHence, in some contexts, hiragana, after a complex process of socio-linguistic-graphical evolution over a thousand years, has become as frequent or more frequent in text than kanji. To over-simplify the situation, women's script has become more popular than men's script in some contexts in modern Japanese literacy. By social patterning, there has been a retrograde devolution back toward the Heian era distinction of syllable-script for women, word script for men (government, etc.). Moreover, this process is not yet over.\n\nA 21st century literary phenomenon in Japan is the cell phone novel, “keitai shousetsu”. These are written by young women (and sometimes by young men, perhaps writing as women) often by typing in hiragana on phone keyboards, easier than typing kanji. Cell phone novels often portray the lives of young people and employ more kana and non-standard punctuation to convey nuances of meaning and vernacular. There are claims that these cell-phone novels, which may use higher percentages of hiragana characters, and also a higher percentage of katakana, than in standard prose, are of lower artistic quality than traditional literature, but, nevertheless, and once again, women are in the forefront of literary innovation in Japan, and they are innovating in what was formerly women's script. Originally published on-line, several cell phone novels have subsequently appeared in print.\n\nLady Murasaki doesn’t need homage, but she’s receiving it on hundreds of thousands of cell phones anyway.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/world/asia/20japan.html\n\nIn terms of Japanese literary style, the frequency of kanji compared to kana may be analogous with the frequency of Latinate to Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. More kanji = more educated in Japan; more Latin = more educated in English. But educated style doesn't necessarily mean more popular literature. Compare, say, the short-word prose style of Ernest Hemingway or Dashiell Hammett to the Latinophilic prose of Henry James. Who is read more often today, outside of academic literature courses? Browsing the “Mystery” section of a bookstore finds far more followers of Hammett’s style than of Henry James’. You have to go to the smaller “Literature” section for the more Latinate style. That is, if there is a nearby bookstore you can go to anymore.\n\nIt would be interesting to know the frequencies of kanji, hiragana, katakana, romaji, and emoji in cell-phone novels compared to traditional novels. In the age of digital texts, it would not be too hard to compile such data for cell-phone novels because they are first \"published\" in electronic form, and hence the characters can be identified an tallied by their digital codes. The same for ebooks of traditionally styled novels.\n\nFor further discussion of this, see:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/books/review/EParker-t.html\n\nOne other homage to Murasaki Shikibu. In 1980, Shiseido, the giant Japanese cosmetic company, brought out a perfume named \"Murasaki\" in honor of the Heian novelist (presumably her name recognition, after a mere 1,000 years, helps sell the product in Japan). On the perfume bottle and packaging, Murasaki's name was written in cursive hiragana characters, as she may have written it herself, a thousand years ago, and the color of the perfume is purplish, signifying the meaning of her name. Today, when sold in the west, \"Murasaki\" perfume is translated into Latin letters in a cursive informal script that conveys some of the same deft freedom as the original hiragana. Thus the spirit of Lady Murasaki’s hiragana echoes in the west.\n\nAssociation versus Causality\n\nThe histories of the path from women’s literacy to women’s suffrage in Britain, America, several European countries, and Japan, show a strong association. First comes women’s literation, then women’s liberation (at least in the form of voting rights).\n\nIs the association causal? Does women’s education result in women’s political power? It seems plausible, and certainly, there is strong belief in the connection, both among those who favor it and among those who oppose it.\n\nWhat about the reverse process? When women gain the right to vote before a substantial number of them are literate, does that result in expansion women’s rights?\n\nSuch questions of causality cannot be answered in laboratories, and historical events and processes often appear to be affected by multiple factors, so it is difficult to prove which factors, if any, caused which results. Nevertheless, we can look for illustrative examples.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt is the home of one of the oldest literate civilizations on earth. Rudimentary Egyptian writing appeared as early as 3300 BCE, in the form of marks on pots and tags for objects. Egyptian Hieroglyphics arose around 3100 BCE, and, including its descendant scripts, Hieratic and Coptic, was used in Egypt for over three thousand years, well into the Greco-Roman period. Estimates of literacy rates in ancient Egypt are around one percent of the population, perhaps less. Among the Egyptian aristocracy, women had property rights, social status, and political power; and some even became Pharaoh, like Queen Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty (circa 1500 BCE), but evidence for women’s literacy is scanty.\n\nIn Ptolemaic (Greek) and Roman Egypt, the literacy rate may have risen to 5% to 10%, similar to literacy rates in Greece and Rome at the time, but it is not clear how many women numbered among the literates, but at least some women were literate. The Roman historian Plutarch wrote that Cleopatra, shortly before her suicide by the bite of an asp, wrote and sent a letter (tablet) to Octavius Caesar, who had just defeated Cleopatra’s lover, Marc Antony.\n\nAfter the Islamic Arab conquest of Egypt in the 7th century AD, the official administrative language became Arabic, written in Arabic script. Evidence for Arabic women scribes is generally scanty, although one tradition relates that in Baghdad, the renowned 11th century calligrapher Ibn al-Bawwab learned calligraphy from the daughter of Ibn Muqla, a famous calligrapher of a generation earlier who had devised the naskh style of Arabic script and passed it on to his daughter. Other accounts, however, name different teachers for Ibn al-Bawwab.\n\nIn modern Egypt, women’s suffrage was enacted in 1956, but today, an estimated 23% of Egyptian women remain illiterate, especially among the poor, among whom women’s illiteracy rates may range as high as 36% in some parts of the country. Universal suffrage has not resulted in universal literacy for women.\n\nThe histories of other African countries also suggest that women’s suffrage does not necessarily entail expanded rights or education for women. Forces blocking women’s rights appear to include colonialism and its aftermaths, as well as persistence of traditional political, cultural, and religious beliefs, and in addition, poverty.\n\nUnder colonial rulers, most African countries did not permit voting by non-white men and women, but when former colonies gained independence, women’s suffrage was often part of the liberation and formation of a new state.\n\nSudan\n\nSudan lies immediately south of Egypt and was the home of several ancient civilizations, including the Meroite empire, which used writing derived from Egyptian hieroglyphic and demotic writing. With the advent of Christianity in the Sudan in the 6th century AD, the Meroite script was replaced by Coptic script. With the advent of Islam in Sudan, Arabic script became dominant. Literacy rates in ancient and medieval times seem to be unknown but presumably low, as in Egypt.\n\nSudan today is linguistically and graphically diverse, with more than one hundred languages spoken in Sudan, and written variously in Arabic, Ethiopic, and Latin scripts. Published literacy rates do not distinguish among languages and scripts, so it is not clear how literacy is distributed in society, although there are typical distinctions between urban (more literate) and rural (less literate) and upper class (more literate) and lower class (less literate).\n\nSudan has been riven by colonial and civil wars, including the current Darfur conflict, and is now one of the poorest countries in Africa. Sudan gained independence from Egypt and Britain in 1956, but short-lived civilian governments have been followed by a military coups d’état.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, formal elementary education for girls began but expanded slowly. By the late 1940s, educated women began to campaign for women’s rights through the formation of women’s unions and associations. Women gained the vote in Sudan’s constitution in 1953, but by 1956, only around 4% of Sudanese girls and women were literate. A new constitution was adopted 1964, but in 1968, a civilian government was overthrown by military coup, and in 1989, another military coup established a government with a former general as president. Although there have been subsequent elections, the same former general, Omar al-Bashir, remains in power after 26 years, despite being accused by the International Criminal Court of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. A few days ago, he had to flee a conference in South Africa in order to avoid arrest under a warrant from the International Criminal Court.\n\nBy some measures, literacy rates for Sudanese women resemble those of pre-industrial Britain of the 1600s or early 1700s, with only a third of women literate, but recent surveys give much higher estimates: 63% most recently, 35% in earlier surveys, but only 10% estimated in the 1970s. It is not clear what spurred the increase in literacy, assuming the figures are accurate, which they may not be. Differences between estimates highlight the difficulty of gathering accurate statistics in a country torn by social strife, civil wars, repressive regimes, and governmental manipulation of information.\n\nSudanese women are said to have voted in large numbers in Sudan’s national elections in 2010, but the incumbent male president, former general Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in the 1989 coup, won re-election with 68% of the vote, while Sudan’s first female presidential candidate, Dr. Fatima Abdel-Mahmood, received only 0.3% of the vote. Apparently, women did not vote for the woman candidate for president, but the election was clouded by alleged vote rigging, ballot stuffing, and other irregularities. In 2015, President al-Bashir extended his 26 year reign as President by winning 94.5% of the national vote. Opposition parties boycotted the vote and protested election fraud.\n\nRestrictions and repressions of Sudanese women in most areas of society today suggest that suffrage alone is not a reliable predictor of women’s rights and social equality. [see wikipedia article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality_in_Sudan and other\n\nhttps://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/sudan-one-of-worst-countries-for-women-s-rights-survey\n\nhttp://www.sudanupdate.org/REPORTS/WOMEN/WOMEN.HTM ]\n\nThe re-election of former General Bashir after 26 years in power may lead some Americans to criticize the frequency with which former generals and colonels take power in third world countries, but we should remember that twelve former generals and six former colonels have been elected President of the United States. Forty-one percent our presidents have been former high-ranking military officers. Some were outstanding. Washington is revered, Ike is liked, and TR (Teddy Roosevelt) was our greatest conservationist President, but other former officers did not serve with much distinction in office, and some didn't serve for long. Former general William Henry Harrison (“Old Tippecanoe”) lasted only a month and a day.\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nAfter long-standing ethnic and religious divides between the northern and southern parts of Sudan, a 2011 referendum led to the division of the country and formation of a new country, the Republic of South Sudan, from what had previously been Southern Sudan.\n\nDashing hopes for successful independence, South Sudan has been convulsed by a protracted, multi-party civil war fueled by political, regional, ethnic, and tribal rivalries. Over a million people have been displaced within the country and half a million have fled to neighboring countries. South Sudan has been in conflict with Sudan over oil production and revenue. The UN and international aid agencies have reported multiple atrocities, including torture and execution of civilians, and mass rapes of women and girls, and the UN aid coordinator was recently expelled by the government in retaliation for criticism.\n\nSouth Sudan has one of the highest illiteracy rate of any country in the world. Its recent literacy figures are reported as 40% for men and 16% for women. Despite ostensible women’s suffrage, the situation for women in South Sudan is among the worst in the world, amid conflict, poverty, and famine. South Sudanese women have the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, 2,054 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nThe vote has not brought appreciable benefit to the women of South Sudan.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAlthough the chronology was somewhat later, women’s literacy and suffrage in South Africa followed the British pattern, but only for the colonial white population. A literate vanguard of white South African women - descendants of British, Dutch, and other European colonists - advocated for women’s suffrage for two decades, finally gaining the vote in 1930, achieved with less violence and imprisonment than in Britain two decades earlier. In 1931, all white adults, women as well as men, were granted the right to vote when South Africa, which had been a self-governing “dominion” of the United Kingdom, became a sovereign nation, although still allied with the UK in the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nFor the indigenous African population, however, the vote and other human rights were restricted or eliminated by colonial governments. South Africa had been successively colonized by Dutch, British, and other Europeans in the 17th and 18th century. After a series of wars between European colonizers and ethnic Africans, and then between different European colonizers (the Boer wars) in the 19th century, South Africa came under British rule. It gained nominal independence from Britain in 1910, but, in the European pattern, white men, but not women, had the right to vote\n\nIndigenous black South Africans of either sex, despite constituting the majority of the population, were denied voting and other human rights and oppressed by a plethora of racist restrictions under the umbrella of “apartheid”. After long struggle, universal suffrage for all ethnicities of South Africa was eventually achieved in 1994. Since then, South Africa has conducted regular elections and has not suffered from the coups d’état that chronically affect many newly independent and third world nations.\n\n(The history of suffrage for Native Americans is not something that the United States can be proud of. Disenfranchisement of indigenous populations was a common colonial practice. Some Native American women, notably in the Iroquois Confederacy, exercised a range of political powers, including nomination of chiefs, but after the American Revolution, the Iroquois, who had sided with the British, were suppressed and their lands confiscated. Native American women and men were not granted full US citizenship until 1924, but their voting rights continued to be denied or limited by several states until the sweeping Voting Rights Act of 1965. Even after that law, voting rights for Native Americans, as for African Americans, continued to be blocked and hindered in several states.)\n\nAfghanistan\n\nWomen’s suffrage was first granted in Afghanistan in 1923, but revoked in 1929 after a change in government. A new constitution in 1964 again granted women the right to vote. Women’s rights were further advanced in later years under various governments, but in the late 1970s, Afghanistan became a pawn in a proxy war between the Soviet Union and the US. The CIA provided money and weapons to Afghanistan’s mujahideen to fight the Soviet-backed forces, but no appreciable funds to secure or advance women’s rights. After the Soviet Union withdrew its military support for the socialist government, Afghanistan became embroiled in civil war until the 1996 victory of the Taliban, a movement of religious fundamentalists. The Taliban revoked most political and social rights for women, undoing three-quarters of a century of incremental progress for women. After the US and Britain ousted the Taliban through military intervention, yet another Afghan constitution granted voting rights to women, who were able to vote in 2004.\n\nAfter a decade of financial, developmental, and military support and political pressure from the US, estimates of women’s literacy in Afghanistan range variously from 12%, 15%,18%, to 32%, or higher, depending on the survey, date, and segment and locale of the population surveyed. The highest figures are for younger groups, perhaps indicating beneficial effects of a dozen years of American aid for girls’ education. As American forces withdraw from Afghanistan, there is pessimism about whether educational and political advances for women will be maintained. Despite ostensible women’s suffrage and ostensible progress in education, Afghanistan has been ranked as one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women, especially for women activists.\n\nFrom the Sudan, South Sudan, and Afghan examples, it appears that wars and revolutions can depress women’s rights and education, but, as noted above for the European, American, and Japanese histories, gains in women’s suffrage often appears to follow war or revolution if a substantial portion of women are already literate and have some economic, if not political, power, and if the political systems of the country stabilizes.\n\nThe social distortions and lingering effects of colonialism are often cited as reasons for political instability in former colonies. Fifty years of political independence may not be a long enough time. After a country becomes independent, how much time is needed before women’s rights are established? In the United States, it took 144 years between the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the granting of women’s suffrage in 1920. In England and France, it took around 1500 years, give or take a few decades. Roman armies withdrew from England around 410 AD, and from Gaul around 450 AD. Of course, the pace of history is faster today than it was 1500 or 2000 years ago, or so we imagine. I would bet that when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, everybody in Rome thought events were moving very fast indeed.\n\nEven today, more than two centuries since the 13 Colonies, Americans should not feel overly superior about our democracy and voting rights. “Between one-quarter and one-third of all eligible voters - more than 50 million Americans - are not registered [to vote].”\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/opinion/hillary-clinton-voting-rights-and-the-2016-election.html\n\nWe still have a long way to go, so let's get back to women on the money.\n\nDon’t forget to tell Treasurer Jacob Lew which woman you want to see on the $20. And if she only gets on the $10, then demand that your bank offer $10 bills in its ATMs!\n\nBrief Bibliography\n\nFRANCE\n\nFor history of education in France, see François Furet and Jacques Ozouf, \"Three Centuries of Cultural Cross-fertilization: France\" in Literacy and Social Development in the West: a reader, edited by Harvey Graff, Cambridge University Press, 1981. Further discussions of the development of literacy in early modern Europe can be found in the same volume.\n\nFor a book-length treatise by Furet and Ozouf, see Reading and Writing: literacy in France from Calvin to Jules Ferry, Cambridge U. Press, 1982. Furet and Ozouf frame their discussion in terms of social class, rivalry between church and state, and competition between nations.\n\nA broad discussion of literacy, spanning millennia around the world, is by Albertine Gaur, Literacy and The Politics of Writing, Intellect Books, Bristol, Portland, 2000. Gaur is the former Head of the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books at the British Library. (I often assign her earlier book, A History of Writing, as a textbook when I taught digital typography at Stanford.)\n\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Literacy, edited by David R. Olson and Nancy Torrence, Cambridge U. Press, 2009, includes essays on historical literacy, Chinese literacy, and literacy in the Arab world, among other wide-ranging topics.\n\nBritish social anthropologist Jack Goody has written several books with thoughtful, deep views of literacy, not limited to a present day Anglo-American focus. See, for example: The Domestication of the Savage Mind; or The Interface between the Written and the Oral; or The Logic of Writing and the Organization of Society.\n\nOther topics are referenced by URLs in the text, and recourse to Wikipedia is also helpful for many of the topics.\n\nWOMEN’S LITERATION (Part 1)\n\nThe year 2020 is the 100th anniversary of the 19th constitutional amendment, which granted women the right to vote. The amendment was proposed by Congress on June 4th, 1919 and ratified by the states in August, 1920.\n\nIn Britain, the year 2020 is the 150th anniversary of the Elementary Education act of 1870, which instituted primary schooling for girls as well as boys, beginning a new era in literacy.\n\nAlthough separated by fifty years, an ocean, and a common language, these events are connected by women’s literation.\n\nA Woman on the $20\n\nTo commemorate ratification of the 19th amendment, there is a campaign to put a portrait of an outstanding American woman on the $20 bill.\n\nWith the slogan, “A woman’s place is on the money,” a website “WomenOn20s” proposed an on-line ballot of fifteen women candidates for the $20 bill. Candidates were: abolitionist and suffragist Harriet Tubman; US First Lady and campaigner for human rights and women’s rights, Eleanor Roosevelt; renowned civil rights activist, Rosa Parks; American suffragists Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth (also abolitionist), and Alice Paul; birth control activist Margaret Sanger; writer and founder of National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan; politicians Shirley Chisholm, Patsy Mink, and Barbara Jordan; scientist Rachel Carson; Red Cross founder and nurse, Clara Barton; New Deal Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins.\n\nA New York Times “debate” about the campaign posted arguments by several women activists, scholars and writers, who variously favored Truth, Anthony, Carson, Sanger, Lazarus, Perkins, and Mankiller, and also nominated Emma Lazarus and Harriet Beecher Stowe, not on the two WomenOn20s lists.\n\nAfter a primary round of balloting, the WomenOn20s field was narrowed to four candidates: Tubman, Roosevelt, Parks, and Wilma Mankiller, first woman principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, added to the short list by “strong public sentiment”. You can vote your choice from those four on the website. Polls close at midnight on May 10, Mothers’ Day.\n\nOf course, those are not the only outstanding American women whose portraits deserve to be on the $20 bill. WomenOn20s started out with a list of about 100 candidates.\n\nNevertheless, there’s no reason to be limited to candidates proposed by WomenOn20s. If you have another woman to nominate (remember, only the dead can be on the money), send a letter or email to your congresswoman, if you have one (only 20% of US Senators and only 19.3% of Representatives are women). Of course, you can always write to your male congressman, too.\n\nLet’s not forget Sacagawea, the Shoshone Native American interpreter and guide for the Lewis & Clark expedition of 1804-1806. Strictly speaking, she was not a suffragist or abolitionist nor even a US citizen, but her ancestors had walked (or paddled) to the Americas and populated the continents ten thousand or more years before boatloads of European conquistadors, colonists, opportunists and religionists swarmed onto the shores and claimed the land as theirs. By ancestry, Sacagawea was a more genuine American than Lewis or Clark, or anyone descended from the hordes of arrivistes, parvenus, and Johnny-come-latelies. But, beyond the distinction of ancestry, Sacagawea, the only woman on the expedition crew, distinguished herself by equalling the men in courage, resourcefulness, and industry, and surpassing them in linguistic ability, helping the expedition negotiate with diverse Native American tribes as it passed through a vast, unfamiliar, and often dangerous land.\n\nBorn into a Shoshone tribe decimated by introduced diseases, when Sacagawea was a girl, she was captured and enslaved by a rival tribe, and then as a teenager was sold in marriage to a French Canadian trapper, Toussaint Charbonneau, later hired by Lewis and Clark. A young mother at the time, Sacagawea accompanied her husband and cared for her baby over thousands of miles of hard traveling.\n\nA century after the Lewis & Clark expedition, the National American Woman Suffrage Association meeting in 1905 lauded Sacagawea (also spelled Sacajawea and Sakakawea, sometimes translated as “Bird Woman”) as a paragon of American womanhood.\n\nLewis and Clark had low opinions of Charbonneau (though the men liked his cooking) and Clark later regretted that they hadn’t paid Sacagawea for her services. (They paid Charbonneau $500.) In 2001, to recognize Sacagawea’s meritorious service to fledgling America, President Bill Clinton promoted her to honorary “Sergeant Sacagawea.” Of course, women’s rights include equal pay for equal work, so President Clinton should have supplemented Sacagawea’s posthumous honor with back pay equal to her husband’s plus two centuries of compound interest. That would be worth many million dollars today and could be used for things like scholarships for Shoshone girls and women. Perhaps a future President Hillary Clinton would remedy her husband’s omission.\n\nMaybe Sacagawea was omitted from the candidates for the $20 bill because she has appeared on stamps and money before. With Lewis and Clark, she was portrayed on a 1954 stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of their expedition, and she appeared alone on a stamp in 1994. With her baby on her back, she is portrayed on the one dollar “Sacagawea” coin, which features Native American motifs on the reverse, changing from year to year. Nevertheless, it is time to award her another promotion, from the one dollar coin to the twenty dollar bill, where she would gain greater recognition. When was the last time you filled your pockets with dollar coins from your ATM? (Over six billion $20 bills are in circulation, but only 50 million Sacagawea coins.)\n\nThose who feel it would be poetic justice for Sacagawea to replace Andrew Jackson, a notorious persecutor of Native Americans, can still vote for a Native American woman, Wilma Mankiller, former principle chief of the Cherokee nation, on the WomenOn20s site. Jackson presided over the infamously brutal “trail of tears” removal of the Cherokee from their indigenous lands in the southeastern states to Oklahoma, so it would be right and just for a Cherokee woman to kick Old Hickory off the Twenty.\n\nCommemoration in Britain: “Suffragette”\n\nIn Britain, there do not yet appear to be official plans to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the 1870 Education Act, but a cinematic celebration of women who fought for the vote is scheduled for release this autumn, some three years short of Britain’s centennial of women’s suffrage.\n\n“Suffragette” is a movie about British Suffragette leaders Emmeline Pankhurst, Edith New, Emily Davison, and their followers. It stars Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter, Meryl Streep and other luminary ladies of the silver screen. A movie blurb says they were “foot soldiers of the early feminist movement.” That’s understatement, like saying SEAL sniper legend Chris Kyle was “a grunt in Mesopotamia.”\n\nThose legendary suffragettes were firebrands, literally. After their peaceable agitations for the vote were rebuffed, they resorted to arson, vandalism, assault, and battery. They set fire to post boxes, smashed windows, fought police, harangued the Prime Minister, interrupted Parliament, and blew up a house being built for the Chancellor of Exchequer, David Lloyd George (he wasn’t there at the time). Suffragette Emily Davison was trampled to death at the Epson Derby when she stepped onto the track to grab the King’s horse.\n\nThe Suffragette fight went on for decades of struggle and suffering, beginning in the 19th century. Around 1905, it entered a violent phase when frustrated women became disobedient, both civil and uncivil. Between 1905 and 1914, more than 1,000 suffragettes were imprisoned, and many were sentenced to hard labor. Imprisoned suffragettes protested by going on hunger strikes but were then force-fed. In a charade of justice, with covert repression, the force-fed women were occasionally released until they regained some of their health and then were re-imprisoned. Out on the streets, some suffragettes, angered by the inhumane force-feedings of their sisters (think water boarding with calories), beat up the prison doctors responsible. The furious women whipped the doctors with riding crops (or dog whips or horse whips, depending on which reports are believed).\n\nThe harsh treatment that police and prison authorities gave those militant women sounds familiar. Would those genteel, decorous, modestly dressed, ideologically driven women be labeled terrorists today?\n\nWhatever label may be applied to those women, their efforts and sacrifices eventually gained the vote for British women in 1918 (initially only for women over 30; extended to women over 21 in 1928).\n\nThe movie “Suffragette” focuses on charismatic characters and their dramatic struggles. Pre-release photos show Edith New (played by Bonham Carter) knocking down a cop with a wicked punch. Floyd Mayweather, take note.\n\nMovies seldom dwell on reading (action looks better on screen), so the screen story doesn’t highlight the fundamental, crucial social fact that in the 19th and early 20th centuries, nearly all the suffragettes in Britain were literate.\n\nA century earlier, that hadn’t been the case. In 18th century England, most women were illiterate, not much different from what had prevailed throughout most of history. Only in the early 20th centuries did women’s literacy in England achieve near parity with that of men. Although there had been calls for women’s suffrage in the early 19th century, it was not until 1900 that literate women were numerous enough to attain critical mass and really start the pot boiling. Having achieved equality of literacy with men, women no longer accepted political inequality and agitated ever more strenuously for the vote and political power.\n\nComparing the suffragette movement in England and the suffragist movement in America (the minor difference between the terms is an instance of our two countries being separated by a common language), it is evident that literacy for a few women was not enough for social change, but literacy for lots of women was.\n\nLiteracy for the few (women).\n\nIn European history, there is a long tradition of literate aristocratic women, but in any given era, there seem to have been relatively few of them. In part, that may be because their writings have not survived, so we simply don’t know of them, and in part because few literate women were recognized for their literate works even in their own times, so their writings were not copied as often as those of men, and thus have not survived.\n\nWomen’s literacy in earlier eras.\n\nGreece\n\nIn classical Greece, literacy was principally the domain of upper-class men, like the poets, playwrights, philosophers, scholars, and mathematicians whose works survive. Exceptions to masculine primacy were women poets like the celebrated Sappho and the lesser known Anyte and Nossis. Most of their works, alas, survive only as fragments.\n\nIn Greek-speaking Egypt in the early Christian era, Hypatia of Alexandria was an exceptional author of mathematical and philosophical treatises. (She was murdered by a Christian mob, but that appears to have resulted from religion and politics, not sexism per se.)\n\nRome\n\nLiteracy in ancient Rome was likewise the domain of aristocratic men, like, Caesar, Cicero and Virgil. There are references to a number of literate aristocratic women, but only a few examples of poetry, correspondence, or graffiti survive from a handful of known Roman women writers, including Cornelia, Sulpicia, and Balbilla, who are hardly household words today. The authorship of some writings attributed to them is even disputed.\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nThe Middle Ages appear to have been somewhat better for women’s literacy, in part because they produced more and part because more of their written materials survive. In addition to aristocratic women literates, as in earlier eras, many Medieval nuns (some from aristocratic families) were literate and worked in monasteries as scribes, copyists, and correspondents. Some spent their time copying older manuscripts, but some wrote original texts, like the celebrated polymath and mystic, Hildegard of Bingen, a prolific author who wrote varied works on theology, herbal medicine, wrote sermons and music, and carried on a wide correspondence. Hildegard also invented an alphabet to transcribe a secret variant of Latin she had invented.\n\nIn poetry and romance, women troubadours or “trobairitz” of 12th century Provence composed poetry and songs from a woman’s perspective. Several examples have survived, and while it is assumed that those aristocratic women poets, like the Countess of Dia, were literate, their actual methods of composition are unknown. The phenomenon of women troubadours does not appear to have been prevalent in other areas and eras or to have survived into later eras.\n\nRenaissance\n\nThen came the Italian Renaissance with its wave of literate humanism. In aristocratic and scholarly households, some daughters, as well as sons, received literate educations. Vittoria Colonna, daughter of the Duke of Urbino, Federico Montefeltro, received such an education. Through marriage, she became Marchesa of Pescara, and in widowhood, was an accomplished poet who corresponded with her close friend Michelangelo as well as with notable Italian Renaissance writers like Baldassare Castiglione, Pietro Bembo, and other luminaries.\n\nItalian anthologies of women’s poetry were popular in the latter half of the 16th century, and not all the poetry was by noblewomen. Women commoners wrote as well. Isabella Andreini, the most celebrated commedia dell’arte actress, wrote sonnets and plays. A portrait said to be of Andreini was painted by Paolo Veronese. Veronica Franco, a famous courtesan of roughly the same era as Andreini, late 1500s, was a prolific author, particularly on women’s issues. A portrait presumed to be of Franco is attributed to Tintoretto, or Veronese. Most Italian humanists were men, it is true, but it is also evident that women’s literacy was no longer restricted to the aristocracy; more women were becoming literate to a greater extent than in earlier eras. The Renaissance is closer to our time, and more texts have survived than from earlier eras; moreover, printing multiplied and distributed more copies of all writings, including those by women. Examples of their actual handwriting seem scarce.\n\nOur knowledge of the handwriting of women writers of the Renaissance is fragmentary. Vittoria Colonna’s handwriting, for example, was a relaxed humanist cursive, less strict and regular than her friend Michelangelo’s italic handwriting. Albinia de La Mare’s fine treatise on the Handwriting of Italian Humanists gives examples of writing only by men. Likewise, most of the study of Renaissance handwriting focuses on the works and manuals of male writing masters like Arrighi and Tagliente. In both sense of the word “writing” — texts and handwriting — we know far more of the Renaissance works of men than of women.\n\nIndustrial England\n\nFrom the sunlit palazzos of cultured Renaissance Italy, let us skip over the Mercantilist and colonialist eras to the later years of the Enlightenment, to early industrial England, where the next great advance in women’s literation gathered momentum among the dark Satanic Mills.\n\nIn late 18th century England, around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, literacy rates were around 50% to 60% for men, depending on social class and region. Literacy was markedly higher in the upper-classes, as usual. Literacy was much lower among women, below 40% most areas and lower still in some industrial regions. In Lancashire, an early industrial city, women’s literacy fell below 20%.\n\nIt should be emphasized that in studies of 18th and 19th centuries, “literate” does not mean that a person read David Hume or wrote like Jane Austen; but simply that person could sign his or her name in a parish registry upon marriage. Because reading was taught before writing, signing one’s name presupposed some ability to read.\n\nHence, at the beginning of the 19th century, women lagged far behind men in literacy in England, but eventually caught up with men little more than a century later, in the decade before the “Great War” (World War I). This was also the decade when the militant phase of the women’s suffrage movement erupted.\n\nHow did women get from Mary Wollstonecraft’s 1792 manifesto “A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” to suffragette agitation of the early 20th century, to the granting of women’s suffrage in 1918 in Britain and 1920 in America? The answer appears to be, literation.\n\nCritical Mass of Women’s Literation\n\nBy the early 20th century, literacy rates in Britain had risen above 90% for both men and women, although men had a higher rate because there was a still a cohort of older women who had grown up without schooling. In terms of relative progress, however, girls had done much better than boys. Since the late 18th century, the literacy rate for men had not quite doubled, but for women it had had tripled or quadrupled.\n\nElementary Education Act of 1870\n\nThe major factor in women’s literation was a confluence of social initiatives promoting elementary education. Until the middle of the 19th century, schooling for girls, apart from home schooling by literate parents or governesses, more often concentrated on social graces than literacy or numeracy. In Jane Austen’s novel Pride and Prejudice, published in 1811, Miss Bingley, educated in a school for wealthy young women, summarizes the goals of an elite curriculum:\n\n“A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word [accomplished]; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.\"\n\nBeginning in the late 18th century with private and church-based schooling initiatives, education for girls and boys gradually gained support, culminating in the national Elementary Education Act of 1870, which provided schooling to all children between ages of five and twelve. The bill was first read in the House of Commons on February 17, 1870, and its second reading was in the House of Lords on July 25 of the same year, when it was passed.\n\nA principal political justification for the Education Act was to maintain and increase England's industrial competitiveness. Although earlier generations of education reformers had emphasized the morally uplifting effect of literacy on character, progressive political leaders pushed for the Education Act by arguing that an educated populace was needed to maintain England's industrial preeminence in world markets, and to improve the competence of England's armed forces, who needed to read in a technically advanced military. Moreover, it was believed that a literate populace would be more knowledgeable and would vote more wisely.\n\nLiteracy and the Industrial Revolution\n\nAn important enabling force for the dramatic increase of women’s literacy was the Industrial Revolution, which facilitated literacy by decreasing the cost of books and magazines (among many other manufactured goods), thereby making reading matter more affordable and plentiful, and giving it greater variety, thus appealing to more of the populace, including more women. Among its myriad social effects, the Industrial Revolution also raised personal incomes and standards of living, enabling more people to buy books and magazines that had become cheaper.\n\nThus, an increasingly literate British populace interacted with industrialization in a virtuous circle. More readers encouraged longer print runs with greater economies of scale, resulting in cheaper books that the growing numbers of readers were better able to afford. More education and cheaper books increased levels of literacy, generating more readers who bought more books. And so on.\n\nUniversal literate education requires literate resources — schoolbooks and libraries — so another consequence of nationally sponsored education was the growth of the textbook market, still a lucrative publishing sector today.\n\nAnother virtuous circle (assuming that consumerism is a virtue) was that a more literate populace could read and be influenced by advertisements, handbills, labels, packaging, and posters promoting the myriad manufactured goods churned out by English industries. Hence, greater literacy promoted greater domestic consumption of industrial products, further fueling English industry. Because one of the functions of women was to act as domestic purchasing agents for their families, the three-to four-fold increase of literacy rates for women multiplied the positive effects of literacy on an emerging consumer economy.\n\nA generation or so after the 1870 Elementary Education Act, schooling for women had produced a large cohort of literate women and increased their economic power, but not their political power. Girls who began school in the decades after the Education Act were young women in the first decade of the 20th century, when suffragism became militant. Not all suffragettes were young then, nor were all educated in public schools, nor were all violent, but nearly all the suffragettes and the women who sympathized with their cause were literate.\n\nHence, the 1870 Education Act, along with earlier initiatives to provide schooling to girls as well as boys alike, resulted in a possibly unanticipated but powerful social movement — women’s suffrage. Fueled by the tremendous rise in women’s literacy, the women's suffrage movement, which had been smoldering for more than a century, burst into flames, literally, at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nNear the end of the nineteenth century, a new generation of literate English women began to campaign for the vote. Having become equal in literacy to men, and almost equal in numbers, literate middle-class women demanded political equality as well. Although Mary Wollstonecraft had argued eloquently for women's rights a century earlier, the new generation of suffragists and suffragettes were more organized, more militant, and, as they were continually rebuffed, eventually more violent in their actions.\n\nLiteracy & Suffragism in America\n\nIn the United States, education of women did not have a centralizing national initiative like the British Education Act of 1870, but by fits and starts, private, local, and state initiatives, and patchwork progress, the education of women and women’s suffrage eventually resulted in a large group of literate women, who, like their militant sisters in England, agitated for the vote, with similar obstruction by the authorities. The American suffragists, as they were called, eventually in their push for political power, in 1920, only two years later than in England.\n\nAs in England, the American suffragist movement was in large measure initiated and propelled by literate women, but was also supported by non-literates. Abolitionists and suffragists Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth grew up without formal schooling because education of slaves was illegal in most southern states, not least because of beliefs that slave literacy would lead to slave rebellion.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 19th century, American suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony received primary and secondary schooling. Stone went to Oberlin college as well. Stone and Anthony worked as school teachers when young, and were incensed at being paid less than men for the same job. Politically they began as abolitionists but later focused on women’s suffrage and rights. In 1848, Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and others organized a women’s rights convention at Seneca Falls, New York, where Stanton proposed voting rights for women. In 1878, Cady and Anthony proposed an amendment to the Constitution granting women the right to vote. It would not happen until 42 more years of struggle and agitation had gone by, and 72 years after Stanton’s voting rights proposal of 1842.\n\nAlice Paul and Woodrow Wilson\n\nIn the early 20th century, Alice Paul, a young American with college and graduate degrees, went to England to study but joined the suffrage movement and was soon imprisoned for pro-suffrage destruction of property. She went on a hunger strike, and was force-fed along with imprisoned English suffragettes. For her, England had been a training camp in militant suffragism. In 1910, Paul returned to the US where she continued the provocative tactics she had learned in England, organizing and agitating for the vote for women. President Woodrow Wilson initially opposed women’s suffrage and was infuriated when Paul and other women picketed the White House, bearing placards reading, \"Mr. President, What will you do for woman suffrage?\" and “Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait for Liberty?” and when those didn’t influence Wilson, “Kaiser Wilson”. Picketing women were arrested for “obstructing traffic”. Wilson pardoned some of those arrested, but Paul was imprisoned and eventually put in a prison psychopathic ward. There, she went on a hunger strike and was force-fed.\n\nPublic outrage against the brutal treatment of imprisoned suffragists eventually forced President Wilson to switch sides and support a women’s suffrage amendment. In 1918, charges against the women picketers were thrown out and Wilson declared support for women’s suffrage amendment. It was passed by Congress in 1919 and ratified by the states in 1920, just in time for women to vote in the 1920 presidential election. Roughly 33% of eligible women voted, and The New York Times commented, “Women have good and sufficient reason to be fairly well satisfied with this, their first participation in a great national contest.” (December 19, 1920.)\n\nAlice Paul had more advanced degrees than Woodrow Wilson. He got to be President in the White House; she got force-fed in prison.\n\nThe winner of the 1920 election was Warren G. Harding, now viewed as America’s second-worst president, but we shouldn’t blame that on neophyte women voters. An estimated 55% of men voted in 1920, two-thirds more than the percentage of women, so Harding’s corrupt and incompetent presidency can mainly be attributed to a poor choice by male voters. Women did vote for Harding, however, because he was a “dry” — against alcoholic beverage; the temperance movement and Prohibition were supported by many women. In the 1928 election, around 60% of women voted for Herbert Hoover, but in 1932, around 57% of women voted for Franklin Roosevelt, so fears that women would vote unwisely were unfounded, or, at least, they voted no more unwisely than men.\n\nThe vote was won for women, but that was not, of course, the end of the struggle for women’s rights. The struggle continued, propelled in large measure by literate women, and by women and girls who want to become literate.\n\nWhat can be gleaned from the history of women’s literation?\n\nIt’s not like women’s striving for equality and defiance of authority should have come as a sudden surprise. Men have feared such eventualities for thousands of years. In Euripides’ eloquent tragedy, “The Bacchae,” written in 405 BC, women rebel against male authority, and not in a nice way. If the play were a supermarket tabloid today, the headline would read: “Women rip King to death with bare hands! Crazed by mind drug made from grapes! Ringleader is his mother!”\n\nWith fears like that, no wonder the ancient Greeks tried to keep literacy away from women. Euripides didn’t get first prize for the play, one of his greatest, but for millennia it has survived as a warning about militant women.\n\nWhen critical masses of women became literate but didn’t have equal rights with men, they started marching in the streets, picketing government institutions, breaking the law, beating up men, fighting with police, burning things down, blowing things up, and, even when thrown into prison for their alleged crimes, they continued defying male authority. Worse, their militancy was contagious, attracting followers from other countries to absorb the ideologies, learn the tactics, and carry the tools of insurgency back home.\n\nThis is reminiscent of recent events, although it happened a century ago.\n\nThose militant women exercised tremendous patience, dedicating their lives to a cause that lay in the far future. Despite arrest, imprisonment, force-feeding and other physical repressions, many of the suffragists lived remarkably long lives, continuing the struggle, without reaching their goal.\n\nLucretia Mott, co-organizer of the Seneca Falls convention of 1848 calling for women’s suffrage, died at age 87 in 1880, forty years before her efforts bore fruit in the 19th amendment. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who organized the 1848 convention with Mott, fought for women’s rights until her death at age 86 in 1902, eighteen years before the 19th amendment. She never got to vote. Susan B. Anthony began working for women’s rights around 1852 and died at age 86 in 1906, fifty-four years of fight without a right. Harriet Tubman died at age 91 in 1913, sixty-four years after escape from slavery, 50 years after Emancipation, and decades after supporting women’s suffrage, still didn’t get to vote. Alice Paul, younger than the previous suffragists, finally got to vote at age 35, after a dozen years of agitation, arrest, and imprisonment. She obtained three law degrees and continued the struggle, dying in 1977, age 92, having lived to see the Equal Rights Amendment pass in 1972, but before it failed to be ratified.\n\nProbably almost everyone in modern techno-industrial societies would agree that literacy is vital, yet its far-reaching ramifications can be unexpected and hard to discern until we take a long view. Changes in the commerce of literacy are sometimes obvious, like the failing financial fortunes of newspapers and magazines as readers migrate from analog print to digital screen, but the unforeseen consequences of deeper changes, like women’s literation, can take much longer to become manifest. The connection between women reading and women voting is one of those.\n\nSome would claim the connection is not causation but mere association, a form of the “post hoc, ergo propter hoc” fallacy. That is, “After this, therefore, because of this”. Nevertheless, the education of women in large numbers, not just aristocratic women or cloistered nuns, has been regularly followed by women achieving political power, although the time lag varies. In some countries, the vote came sooner after literation, in others, later. In France, the birthplace of the Enlightenment and a beacon for human rights, universal education for girls as well as boys was instituted in 1882, but women’s suffrage was not legally instituted until 1944 and the first elections in which women voted were in 1945. France’s most renowned feminist, the eminent philosopher and writer, Simone de Beauvoir, was 37 before she was allowed to vote. She wrote her most famous work, The Second Sex, about women’s oppression through history, when she was 38. The Vatican banned it.\n\n— Chuck Bigelow\n\n[Calligraphy by Kris Holmes]\n\n(The next part of these remarks concerns issues of literation and suffrage beyond the Anglo-American experience, and the third part discusses matters of typography, education, and literation.)\n\nSelected References\n\nWeb sites.\n\nFor “A woman’s place is on the money”, go to: http://www.womenon20s.org\n\nFor the process of WomenOn20s selection, go to: http://www.womenon20s.org/the_process\n\nTo vote on the money, go to: http://www.womenon20s.org/vote2\n\nFor the NY Times debate, see:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/03/18/putting-a-woman-on-the-20-bill\n\nFor Sacagawea, there are many web sources, including these:\n\nhttps://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/sacajawea/\n\nhttp://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0302/feature4/fulltext.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacagawea_dollar\n\nhttps://franceshunter.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/lewis-and-clark-on-u-s-postage-stamps/\n\nhttps://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/sacagawea.html\n\nFor actions by suffragettes, go to:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette\n\nhttp://www.thesuffragettes.org/history/militant-suffragettes/\n\nFor an eminent suffragette, go to:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst\n\nFor a trailer and information about the movie Suffragette, see:\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3077214/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\n\nFor the Education Act of 1870, go to:\n\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/school/overview/1870educationact/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_Education_Act_1870\n\nhttp://www.bl.uk/collection-items/synopsis-of-the-forster-education-act-1870\n\nBooks.\n\nOn literacy in ancient Greece and Rome, see: Ancient Literacy, by William V.

In the intervening quarter-century, vast terrains of typography have shifted from print to screen, and many “books” are now read on digital displays, not in print. We can no longer limit typography discussions to the art of the book; we have to consider the art of typography in both analog and digital, print and screen. For that reason, in 2012, I organized a symposium at Rochester Institute of Technology on \"Reading Digital\", to review the science, technology, art, and design of reading and typography in the digital realm.\n\nBut, this essay was written 23 years earlier. Looking back on it, I see that some of my views have changed over time because of new media, new knowledge, or new interpretations of old knowledge, but the basic distinctions are, I believe, still the same; the shift to digital typography has not changed them.\n\nThe parts about vision science could and certainly should be updated because research on vision and reading has made considerable progress since the 1980s. Reading scientists have found out more about the visual processes underlying reading, and some recent findings are intriguing as well as relevant to typography.\n\nI think it is safe to say, however, that we don't understand much more about the art of typography than we did 25 years ago, or 80 years ago, or, come to think of it, 500 years ago. Jan Tschichold, who created brilliant typography as a modernist and followed it with brilliant typography as a classicist, showed us that.\n\nTo rewrite this out-of-print essay to include newer technological and scientific developments would probably require a book length disquisition, so I am making it available as-it-was but in digital form for reading on screen instead of in print.
