        "text": "Design Guidelines\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to our hub for partner guidelines and assets. We want to make it easy for you to integrate Spotify in your platform while respecting our brand and legal/licensing restrictions. These guidelines have been developed to ensure that all Spotify users receive the same delightful user experience - no matter which platform they listen on.\n\nNote that by using these resources, you accept our Developer Terms of Service. Usage of these resources may also be covered by the Spotify End User Agreement and our Privacy Policy.\n\nAttribution\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nContent available through Spotify is owned by many different rights holders. If you use any Spotify metadata (including artist, album and track names, album artwork, and audio playback) it must always be accompanied by the Spotify brand.\n\nAttribute with the Spotify logo\n\nTo comply with our licensing agreements, you must always attribute content from Spotify with the logo. In partner integrations, you should always use our full logo (icon + wordmark). We do allow using only our icon if it's featured as an app icon on the app screen of a device.\n\nSpotify logo and icon\n\nThe logo is the combination of a wordmark with our icon.\n\nOur icon is a shorter version of our logo. Only use it if you do not have enough room for the full logo.\n\nLogo and icon use must comply with our Logo & Color Guidelines.\n\nUsing our content\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nIf you're using artwork and/or metadata provided by Spotify.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\nFor album and podcast artwork\n\nYou may only use the artwork provided by Spotify.\n\nArtwork must be kept in its original form. Don't animate or distort it in any way. This includes applying overlays and blurring.\n\nIf screen real estate is limited, it's OK to not include any album artwork.\n\nFor metadata\n\nTrack, artist, playlist, and album titles must always be presented with the metadata provided by Spotify.\n\nThe metadata must always be legible.\n\nYou may truncate metadata if space is limited. The user should always be able to view the entire metadata.\n\nDon't manipulate any content or metadata.\n\nFor podcasts\n\nFor podcasts, two sets of metadata need to be supported:\n\nTitle of episode\n\nPodcast name\n\nWe recommend using two lines in your layout for the title of the episode, since podcast episodes often have longer titles than music. The third line is then used for the podcast name\n\nConsiderations\n\nYour layout should be able to accommodate these character counts:\n\nPlaylist/album name: 25 characters\n\nArtist name: 18 characters\n\nTrack name: 23 characters\n\nBrowsing Spotify content\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nIf your app links to a user's Spotify account and there's a dedicated space to display Spotify content. Platforms that aggregate content from multiple audio providers must give Spotify fair treatment - anything made available to all other partners must be available to Spotify.\n\nFollow these guidelines\n\nContent provided by Spotify\n\nSpotify will provide rows - or shelves - of recommended content.\n\nSpotify provides metadata and decides what metadata should be shown to the user, such as headlines and naming of unique contexts and groups of contexts, for all relevant surfaces.\n\nSpotify should determine and populate your content categories. We've optimised our APIs to cover several use cases and serve the most relevant content to each user.\n\nHow to display provided content\n\nDon't manipulate any content or metadata.\n\nSpotify content should never be seated next to content from similar services.\n\nDedicate the full row (shelf) in the view to Spotify content.\n\nNever show more than 20 items in a content set. At the end of each content set, a link to the Spotify app should allow listeners to keep exploring the category.\n\nUse Spotify's logo or icon to attribute content.\n\nLinking to Spotify\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nOn a platform where Spotify already exists. If you have built an integration on a platform where the Spotify client exists (mobile and desktop integrations), always link to the Spotify app. The Spotify app is the default playback mechanism. For full access to Spotify functionality, users should be directed to the Spotify application installed on the partner platform. If the app is not installed, the user should be directed to the app store so that they can install Spotify.\n\nUsing Spotify metadata\n\nIf you use any Spotify metadata (including artist, album and track names, album artwork and audio playback) it must always link back to the Spotify Service.\n\nHow to link to Spotify\n\nIf the Spotify app is not installed then the link should say, GET SPOTIFY FREE\n\nIf the Spotify app is installed then use any of the following text strings: OPEN SPOTIFY, PLAY ON SPOTIFY or LISTEN ON SPOTIFY\n\nThe link to Spotify must follow Spotify's attribution requirements and be accessible in your companion app.\n\nPlaying views\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nWhen you're showing any playing views in your app.\n\nFollow these guidelines\n\nFollow Spotify's attribution requirements, you must always attribute content from Spotify with either the Spotify logo or icon.\n\nFollow the artwork and metadata requirements.\n\nAlways link to the Spotify app (when the Spotify client is available on platform).\n\nOur recommendation: It is recommended that no play controls other than play/pause are provided in your app.\n\nWhy? Disabling and enabling play controls in response to restricted actions for Spotify Free may result in a confusing experience for the user. For example, the user may not understand why the skip back option has been disabled. Rather than explaining these restrictions to the user or creating a frustrating UX, we recommended you don't provide play controls.\n\nIf you choose to show play controls in your app, the following requirements need to be followed:\n\nHandling Spotify Free restricted actions in your companion app\n\nUse the restrictions returned in SpPlaybackRestrictions to correctly set the playback state in the companion app and to respond to the user when they try to perform a restricted action.\n\nPlay controls must either have a disabled state to indicate that they are restricted or they should not be displayed at all.\n\nMake clear that the track progress bar is for information only - there should be no indication that the user can seek.\n\nUpgrade information in Spotify Free\n\nWhen the user tries to perform a restricted action you may display this messaging.\n\nPremium messaging for Android:\n\nSpotify Premium lets you play any track, ad-free and with better audio quality. Go to spotify.com/premium to try it for free.\n\nPremium messaging for iOS:\n\nSpotify Premium lets you play any track, ad-free and with better audio quality.\n\nHandling playback actions for podcasts in your companion app\n\nPodcasts need to have the option to seek 15 seconds forward or backwards.\n\nYou can parse the track URI in order to differentiate between podcast episodes and regular tracks.\n\nLiking a song\n\nThe Like feature should only be available from the Now playing view and should signal back to Spotify. The liked song must not be saved by the partner. When the user is liking a song, the icon should change to it's active state and show a message saying “Added to Liked Songs”. If the user taps the heart again to unlike the song, show a message saying “Removed from Liked Songs”. The like action is represented with the heart icon and can be downloaded here:\n\n.svg .png\n\nIn all playback views where content from Spotify is playing (fullscreen views, widgets, bars, skipped song notifications) make sure to follow these guidelines:\n\nShowing entities\n\nWhen does this apply?\n\nIn Spotify Free, for on-demand playback and shuffle play.\n\nFollow these guidelines\n\nFor Spotify Free, you have to support two types of layouts for tracklists when showing a playlist/album entity:\n\nFor on-demand playback, the user will be able to see and play all tracks in the playlist/album.\n\nFor shuffle play the user will only be able to see a content summary of the playlist/album and then start shuffle playback. The user can't pick a particular song to play, it will start playback in shuffle.\n\nDisplaying explicit content\n\nUsing the Web API, your app can determine whether or not a track or a podcast episode is marked as containing explicit content. Consider using this information in your app to help users discover the content that is appropriate for them.\n\nApps that serve users in South Korea should follow local regulations governing explicit content. When displaying a tracklist or a piece of content to a user in South Korea, your app must display an explicit content badge next to the title of any explicit track or podcast episode. See the Web API reference documentation for more information about the explicit field.\n\nSample explicit content badge for a white backgroundSample explicit content badge for a dark background\n\nUsing our logo\n\nWe are very proud of our logo. Follow these guidelines to ensure it always looks its best. Our logo is the combination of a simple, modern wordmark with the icon.\n\nDownload Logo & Icon\n\nUsing the icon\n\nOur icon is a shorter version of our logo. Use the icon on its own only if you do not have enough room for the full logo or in cases when the Spotify brand has already been established. While the icon can exist without the wordmark, the wordmark should never exist without the icon.\n\nUsing the logo\n\nThe Spotify green logo, pictured top left, is our primary logo colorway, and it should only be used with black, white, and non-duotoned photography.\n\nWhich color logo to use\n\nThe Spotify green logo should only be used on a black or white background, for any other background you should use a monochrome logo.\n\nThe black logo should be used on light colored backgrounds. The white logo should be used on dark colored backgrounds.\n\nExclusion zone\n\nThe logo and the icon's exclusion zone is equal to half the height of the icon (marked as × in the diagram).\n\nMinimum size\n\nEstablishing a minimum size ensures that the impact and legibility of the logo aren't compromised.\n\nLogo misuse\n\nIt's important that the appearance of the logo remains consistent. The logo should not be misinterpreted, modified, or added to. Its orientation, color, and composition should remain as indicated in this document — there are no exceptions.\n\nUsing our colors\n\nWhile embracing a much more colorful language in our brand communications, Spotify Green is our resting color, used only in situations where the brand palette is not being used.\n\n*Note that this green is darker than the green we use on the Spotify logo, which we refer to as light green. The green featured above is optimized for accessibility and legibility. Light green is only intended to be used with the official Spotify logo.\n\nSpotify Green should only ever sit on white, black, or a non-duotoned photograph. Spotify Green mostly exists in the app. Don't use Spotify Green with a color from the brand palette or a duotoned image.\n\nLogos and naming restrictions\n\nNaming your application\n\nIf you are registering your application with us (in the developer dashboard) you will need to enter the name of your app. This name will be used in communications to your app's users when you seek authorization to access their data. We have a few pointers to consider when naming your app:\n\nIt shouldn't imply endorsement by Spotify, but suggest to users that it is “for Spotify” is acceptable.\n\nIt cannot begin with “Spot” or be similar to “Spotify” in sound or spelling.\n\nYour application's logo\n\nYour logo should not include, or look similar to the Spotify logo or any of its brand elements (e.g. Spotify Green, the circle, and the waves). Don't incorporate Spotify's trademarks, in whole or in part, in the name of your company, product, application, service, or website.\n\nDon't pair brands\n\nDon't use the Spotify brand together with any other brand or in any co-branded communications. Pairing of brands is not permitted under our Developer Terms.\n\nFonts\n\nWhat font to use?\n\nWe recommend you to use the default sans-serif font for the platform you are working on.\n\nUsing our typeface\n\nIf you want to use Spotify Circular in your integration please seek approval via brandapproval@spotify.com. After approval,you will be granted links to the web and desktop fonts, and instructions on how to license them correctly before use.\n\nUsing fallback fonts\n\nIn cases when you can't use Circular (or it doesn't contain the characters needed), you have to chose one of our fallback fonts.\n\nFor example, you won't be able to read “丸っこい” in Circular, because it doesn't contain Japanese Hiragana characters. So those displays using the default sans-serif font for whatever operating system you're reading this on.\n\nIf you can't use any custom fonts in your work, try commonly available defaults in this order:\n\nDefault sans-serif for the platform\n\nHelvetica Neue\n\nHelvetica\n\nArial\n\nThank you!"
