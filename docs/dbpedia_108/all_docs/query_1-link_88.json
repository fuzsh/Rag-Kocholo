        "text": "inspiration Book Design, Fonts 25 Perfect Fonts for Books\n\nWhether you’re creating a cover for your literary debut or looking for the perfect font to typeset inside pages, these 25 fonts are perfect for book design.\n\nFrom classic serifs for typesetting to quirky fonts for children’s books, historic novels or vintage covers, below you’ll find the perfect bookish typeface for your next project.\n\nDesigning a cover? Discover fantastic fonts for book covers here.\n\nAdobe Garamond\n\nDesigned by Robert Slimbach and released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is an updated take on the typeface styles created by Claude Garamond, which date back to the sixteenth century. An utterly classic and failsafe choice for typesetting books, Garamond also features gorgeous italic glyphs which can be used to embellish chapter headings or cover titles.\n\nCaslon\n\nAn Old Style serif originally created in 1722 by English typefounder William Caslon, Caslon is a beautiful and traditional typeface for typesetting. Most famously used as the type style for the Declaration of Independence, this timeless typeface is consistently used by designers looking for classic literary style.\n\nPS Fournier\n\nPS Fournier is centuries in the making. Originally based on the type designs of Pierre Simon Fournier from the eighteenth century, the first version of Fournier was released in 1924 by Monotype. In 2016, Stéphane Elbaz of Typofonderie revisited Parisien Fournier’s work and released a polished, contemporary version for print and web. A transitional serif, PS Fournier balances tradition with humanist character, making it an elegant and versatile font for book design.\n\nBaskerville PT\n\nOriginally inspired by the work of english type designer John Baskerville, Baskerville PT was created by Dmitry Kirsanov, Arina Alaferdova and published by foundry ParaType. While Baskerville PT can be used for typesetting it has been created with larger display text in mind. Cover titles, chapter headings and author names will all benefit from its darkly dramatic elegance.\n\nTimes New Roman\n\nAn enduring classic serif that will never go out of style, Times New Roman is literary, authoritative and ultra-legible, making it an excellent all-rounder font for book design. A transitional serif released by Monotype foundry in 1931, created by Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent, the typeface is best known for its use in newspaper design. Today, it endures as a classic and clean typesetting font for books, magazines and eBooks.\n\nITC Avant Garde Gothic\n\nBased on the typeface created for Avant Garde magazine, ITC Avant Garde Gothic is a sultry Seventies font which would bring vintage flair to book cover designs. Team with contemporary colour schemes to dilute its retro edge or pair with sepia-tinted photography for authentic retro style.\n\nAlbra\n\nA fluid, organic serif with high legibility, Albra is a retro-tinted serif font that works beautifully for both display text and typeset pages. A unique alternative to more traditional serif fonts, this is a great font choice for book designers looking for something subtly different.\n\nLinotype Centennial\n\nDesigned by Adrian Frutiger Linotype Centennial was released in 1986 and celebrates a century since the invention of linotype printing. A celebratory serif that showcases features of classic American type design, this is the cool alternative to traditional serifs like Caslon and Baskerville for typesetting book text.\n\nSkolar Latin\n\nLooking for a typeface for a non-fiction book? Skolar Latin is direct and factual, with exaggerated, sculptural serifs that make data-focussed text feel more authoritative. Try teaming with infographics or setting image captions in this effective, simple serif.\n\nSilk\n\nTrue to its name, Silk is a fluid, organic serif typeface with a delicate, elegant appearance. Created by Rakel Tómasdóttir, Silk is available in 14 weights, making it a versatile book font for typesetting inside pages or creating beautiful chapter titles. Romantic or historic novels will bring out the best of this elegant typeface.\n\nLooking to Create Your Own Book Designs?\n\nCreate your own pro-standard books and book covers in Adobe InDesign with the NEW Self-Publish Starter Kit. Included in the Self-Publish Starter Kit are 7 cover and inside page templates for InDesign, with a choice of 7 cover design styles, sized to standard US and UK/European sizes.\n\nThe kit comes complete with instructions for exporting your book as a printable book and as a reflowable or fixed-layout EPUB (eBook), ready for uploading to book retailers such as Apple Store, Kindle Store, Kobo and Google Play."
