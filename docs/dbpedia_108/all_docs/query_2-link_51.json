        "text": "Who can use this feature\n\nAnyone with can edit access to a file can update text properties.\n\nCJK languages refers to scripts that use Chinese characters and their derivatives. This includes Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, and Korean.\n\nSupported fonts\n\nIf you are using the Figma desktop app, you can use any fonts already on your computer. If you're using Figma in the browser, you can install the Figma Font Helper to access fonts installed on your computer.\n\nMac\n\nFigma supports the following native fonts, by language:\n\nSimplified Chinese 简体中文: Song, ST Heiti, ST Kaiti, Fang Song\n\nTraditional Chinese 繁體中文: Apple LiSung, LiHei Pro, LiSong Pro\n\nJapanese 日本語: Osaka, Hiragino\n\nKorean 한국어: Hangangche, Seoul, Apple SD Gothic Neo\n\nWindows\n\nFigma supports the following native fonts, by language:\n\nSimplified Chinese 简体中文: SimSun, KaiTi, Microsoft YaHei\n\nTraditional Chinese 繁體中文: Ming Light, Microsoft JhengHei\n\nJapanese 日本語: MS Gothic, MS Mincho\n\nChinese 中文: Microsoft JhengHei, Microsoft YaHei, SimHei\n\nKorean 한국어: Dotum, Gulim, Batang, Gungsuh\n\nFont fallback\n\nFont fallback allows you to use characters and icons that aren't specifically supported by that font.\n\nIf a font doesn't support a character you input, Figma will render that specific character in a Noto font. No more empty spaces or missing character icons.\n\nFor people writing in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, Figma may choose the wrong version of a character.\n\nTo fix that, you can select your text and update the font to use the specific Noto font for your language. Or select another font that supports the language you’re writing in.\n\nGoogle Noto Fonts\n\nGoogle has a repository of open-source fonts that support a variety of syllabary and logogram based languages.\n\nSearch for languages, regional variations, and font names on the Google Noto website.\n\nFilter by Language when looking for Google Web Fonts.\n\nFigma includes a selection of popular Google Noto fonts in the font picker. This covers both the Serif and Sans Serif versions.\n\nSelect a Noto font\n\nYou can update the font for a selection of text, or an entire text layer.\n\nSelect the text layer you want to update.\n\nOpen the Design tab in the right sidebar.\n\nClick the next to the current font family.\n\nSearch for and select the relevant Noto font.\n\nFigma lists Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Noto fonts in shorthand. For example: Noto Sans Simplified Chinese is shown as Noto Sans SC.\n\nSC = Simplified Chinese\n\nTC = Traditional Chinese\n\nJP = Japanese\n\nKR = Korean\n\nYou’ll see the full name for any other Noto Sans or Noto Serif fonts. This includes: Bengali, Javanese, Malay, Telugu, Tai, Thai, Tamil, Gujarati and Kannada."
