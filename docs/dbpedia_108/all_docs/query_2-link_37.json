These categories can be considered broad top level groupings and fonts should fit within one or more of these categories:\n\nFilling in your item Information (tags and attributes)\n\nTags:\n\nQuality tags are important for all item types. In this case, tags allow you to further categorise the style or genre of your font.\n\nPlease ensure you describe the aesthetics, style, mood and genre within the item tags: e.g. Brush, Handwritten, Display, Marker, Poster or Vintage.\n\nAttributes:\n\nAttributes tell subscribers important technical information about your font and allow them to filter results to find fonts that meet specific criteria.\n\nThe following attributes are available:\n\nAttribute Options Description Web Font Yes, No Does your font include a Web Font version? Spacing Normal, Monospace, Condensed, Expanded Select the spacing that applies to your font. If your font includes multiple styles with different spacings, please select all relevant options. Optimum Size Large, Small or Any Size If your font is primarily intended to be used at Display/ Poster size select \"Large\", If your font is mostly for use in bodies of text select \"Small\". If your font works well at any size, please select \"Any Size\" Serif or Sans-Serif Serif, Sans-Serif, N/A Although there are categories for \"Serif\" and \"Sans-Serif\" fonts however we also think it's important to classify all fonts based around this classic font attribute. See the FAQ below.\n\nFAQ: Why are there both Categories and Attributes for Serif & Sans-Serif?\n\nGenerally all fonts are either Serif or Sans and we think it's important to also capture this information as an attribute for all fonts. If your font can't be classified as either then please select \"N/A\".\n\nThe attribute is another way to indicate if your font is \"Serif\" or \"Sans-Serif\" and becomes more applicable when your font is within other categories such as \"Decorative\" or \"Script\".\n\nYou can select multiple categories where that makes sense e.g. \"Script\" and \"Serif\" is OK because your font could be both. However, you should only select one of \"Serif\" or \"Sans-Serif\", because they are mutually exclusive."
