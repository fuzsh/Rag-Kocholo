        "text": "Increase your patience and tolerance of the edits that the employer makes on the project! You can improve the process of the project's conclusion by creating a justification plan and presenting your own plan and idea. Don't forget to receive a complete brief from the client before all these things And then benchmarking a lot of the project in question is very important and necessary\n\nTypography is the art of arranging letters and text together in a way that makes the text legible, clear and visually appealing to the viewer. Typography includes the style, shape and structure of the font, which aims to create emotions and convey specific messages to the audience. In short, typography is what keeps the text alive.\n\nAlways be updated! Have enough study and research in your field of activity to enter the contract meeting of your projects with full hands. Be so proficient in your expertise that at least your client will not find technical faults from you, because this is the most dangerous fault for all designers. because if you are questioned technically by a person who knows nothing about graphics, it means that you really need to practice and study in the field of graphics. And this ignorance of yours makes your customers less and less every day. Always Stay up to date and don't be afraid of learning\n\nTypography is first of all functionality. It is the logical and consistent use of hierarchy in a text. It is the use of the right size and spacing for the right purpose. The better understanding and implementation of the above-mentioned the better you will be able to produce good accessible content for people with dyslexia. It is important to know what level of dyslexia your reader is struggling with to be able to push the envelope further than what the above-mentioned \"rules\" provide. It's difficult for a designer to work with typography for people with special needs as functionality often will challenge aesthetics - but then again it is also a great opportunity to try to create something beautiful and yet functional.\n\nTypography can make a big difference for people with dyslexia. Some fonts are easier to read than others, because they have clear shapes, consistent widths, and adequate spacing. Some fonts can also reduce the visual confusion that dyslexics may experience, such as mistaking letters or words that look similar. Choosing the right typography can help people with dyslexia to focus on your content, rather than struggle with the form.\n\nChoosing the right typography, like using fonts without fancy decorations, giving enough space between letters, and keeping lines of text shorter, can really help make graphics easier for people with dyslexia to read. This matters because dyslexic readers often find certain font styles and layouts easier on their eyes and brain. So, when designers focus on using dyslexia-friendly typography, they're making sure that everyone can understand and enjoy their graphics, creating a more inclusive and accessible experience for all.\n\nWhen selecting a font for dyslexia, it's important to keep a few guidelines in mind. Sans serif fonts, such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica, are usually the most legible and clear. For maximum readability, fonts should be large and bold, but not too bold as to make the graphic look cluttered. Additionally, use fonts with a high contrast to the background color and try to limit the number of fonts used in one graphic to two or three for a consistent and coherent look.\n\nWhen designing a graphic, you should pay attention to more than just fonts. Alignment and spacing should be taken into account, with text aligned to the left and enough space between lines, words, and paragraphs. Keeping text short and simple, breaking it into smaller chunks, and using headings, subheadings, bullet points, or numbers can help organize information and make it easier to scan. Color should be used sparingly and purposefully, with no more than a few colors that are not too bright or too similar. Additionally, a plain and solid background is best to reduce visual distraction and noise.\n\nTo make my graphics more accessible for people with dyslexia using typography, I arrange text with fonts like Arial, Helvetica, or Calibri, ensuring a font size of at least 12pt with increased line spacing. I avoid italics and underlining, use high-contrast colors, left-align text, and limit line lengths to 50-75 characters. I organize information with bulleted lists, avoid all caps, and provide clear headings for easy navigation, creating a more readable and user-friendly experience.\n\nThe best way to test your typography for dyslexia is to ask for feedback from people who have dyslexia, or use tools that simulate dyslexia. You can ask them to review your graphic and tell you if they find it easy to read, understand, and remember. You can also use online tools, such as Dyslexia Simulator or OpenDyslexic, to see how your graphic looks like from a dyslexic perspective. You can then make adjustments and improvements based on their input and suggestions.\n\nTypography is an intricate and intriguing subject, and there is much more to discover. If you would like to learn more about typography for dyslexia, the British Dyslexia Association has a guide on how to create dyslexia-friendly print materials, such as typography, layout, and design. Additionally, the International Dyslexia Association has a fact sheet on how dyslexia affects reading and writing, as well as how to support dyslexic learners. Furthermore, the Dyslexie Font is a font created especially for people with dyslexia, based on scientific research and user feedback.\n\nTest it out. Of the ~40million that have it; only 2 million know they have it. Infographics/visual aids are proven to help reduce visual stress and improve comprehension. You could even test yourself via free online self assessment tests to provide insights on traits etc.\n\nI have found that capitalization of the first letter of each word really helps. You can skip applying this to short obvious meaning words that the mind fills in the blanks for. The key words and critical verifying words that really matter should be capitalized. Why? They give the eye an anchor to process and keep sequence of meanings in order. Try it for yourself! It wonâ€™t slow your reading down. You can play with leading in between sentences to differentiate individual word packages.\n\nShorter Lines. More Kerning. Larger Fonts. Leading lines to guide the reader's eyes. Illustrative Graphics to reduce the need for reading. If you're specifically designing for dyslexic people, the idea is to rely as little as possible on text. When you have to use text, apply it in creative and illustrative ways. Tell stories. Engage the reader."
