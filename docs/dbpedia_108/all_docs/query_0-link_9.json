        "text": "A variety of fonts are permitted in APA Style papers. Font options include the following:\n\nsans serif fonts such as 11-point Calibri, 11-point Arial, or 10-point Lucida Sans Unicode\n\nserif fonts such as 12-point Times New Roman, 11-point Georgia, or normal (10-point) Computer Modern (the default font for LaTeX)\n\nWe recommend these fonts because they are legible and widely available and because they include special characters such as math symbols and Greek letters. Historically, sans serif fonts have been preferred for online works and serif fonts for print works; however, modern screen resolutions can typically accommodate either type of font, and people who use assistive technologies can adjust font settings to their preferences. For more on how font relates to accessibility, visit the page on the accessibility of APA Style.\n\nUse the same font throughout your paper, with the following exceptions:\n\nfigures: Within figure images, use a sans serif font with a type size between 8 and 14 points.\n\ncomputer code: To present computer code, use a monospace font such as 10-point Lucida Console or 10-point Courier New.\n\nfootnotes: When inserting footnotes with the footnotes function of your word-processing program, use the default font settings. The footnote font might be smaller than the text font (and have different line spacing), and it is not necessary to change it.\n\nInstructors and publishers vary in how they specify length requirements. Different fonts take up different amounts of space on the page; thus, we recommend using word count rather than page count to gauge paper length if possible."
