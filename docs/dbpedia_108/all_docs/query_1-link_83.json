        "text": "Swish is a contemporary geometric font with two 3D orientations that create an alienating effect. The direction is shifted around the center of the horizontal axis. The font is inspired by the change of perspective that the artist Escher used in his drawings. It is a complete Latin font in which all the accents are present. The unique thing about this font is that it is also a stencil letter. The Swish font is designed to work in any printed and on-screen contexts, including logo design, brand identities, websites, packaging, posters and headlines. Optimized for latin based languages. Leon Hulst for TypeFaith Fonts.\n\nSwiss 721™ is a sans serif family that ranges in style from thin to black while mixing in a few unexpected, but beautifully made and ironically flattering, outline weights that spice up the grotesque design. Couple these upstanding letterforms with matching italic styles and you have yourself a beautiful tool that is as legible on screen as it is off, has the technical prowess to conquer even the trickiest of design riddles and will work in a myriad of projects. Swiss 721 is a staple sans serif that you’ll never be sorry you have in your library. It’s been said that a simple sans serif is one of the most difficult typefaces to design. This is because when letters are reduced to their most basic details, irregularities and inconsistencies in design become immediately visible. The Swiss 721 typeface family is a quintessential example of letterforms distilled to their essence while still possessing warmth and verve. Based on mid-century sans serif typefaces, Swiss 721 is a versatile family of weights and proportions ideally suited to a wide variety of print and interactive design projects and is equally at home as headlines on billboards as it is navigation content on small screens. Swiss 721 takes the essence of mid 20th century sans serif typefaces and melds it with modern design consistency and a systematic weight range.\n\nSwiss Interlock represents the extraordinary meeting of two disparate cultural phenomena of the mid-twentieth century. Its compact frame combines the International Style of the late 50s, which championed the clarity of sans serif, with the interlocking lettering characteristic of 60s counterculture aesthetics. The remarkable result is a tightly woven face with unexpected letter pairs that warm an otherwise cold industrial appearance. Swiss Interlock’s unusual origins make it comfortable on everything from album cover artwork and snack food packaging, to home improvement applications and automotive-themed advertsing. Like all good subversives, House Industries hides in plain sight while amplifying the look, feel and style of the world’s most interesting brands, products and people. Based in Delaware, visually influencing the world.\n\nSwiss 721™ is a sans serif family that ranges in style from thin to black while mixing in a few unexpected, but beautifully made and ironically flattering, outline weights that spice up the grotesque design.

OpenType® fonts of Swiss 721 also benefit from a rich character set and a range glyphs supporting most Western European and many Eastern European languages.\n\nSwiss Folk Ornaments were inspired by old Swiss embroidery designs. Swiss Folk Ornaments - Critters & Things is composed of critters (animals) and other things, hearts, pitchers, and a basket. In the character set all critters face to the left. In the shift+character set, under each respective key, all critters face to the right. There are a total of 72 ornaments in this font. Swiss Folk Ornaments - Floral is composed of floral designs. There are a total of 56 ornaments in this font. Swiss Folk Ornaments - Geometric is composed of symmetrical geometric designs. There are a total of 42 ornaments in this font.\n\nThe Swiss typewriters were famous for their unique precision. As complex digitalizations and macro shots were a start for the inspiration and studies, each character has been carefully re-crafted from the ultra high def scans of the printouts made on a special bleed-proof paper. Today’s characters such as @, euro sign and most of accents have been crafted according the original alphabet design. The idea was to digitize and keep a saving of the original typewriter including all its functions (e.g. underlining key) . It’s surprisingly very legible at small sizes. Thanks to an x-height tighter and more spaced, a glyph design less detailed and more neutral/simple than other fonts found on american or italian typewriters. The final artwork can be set at very large sizes due to the highly detailed glyph design. Swissa Piccola Regular is loaded with more than 150 glyphs created with the typewriter to avoid letter repetition in a word. This OpenType feature can be accessed through the 'discretionary ligatures' option. Plus it comes with two stylistic sets : one with an original underlining feature, another with a slashed-x feature. In which all characters are unique and also have been originally typed with the typewriter. It contains more 600 glyphs in total. The two features are separated in another two fonts (Swissa Piccola Slashed x and Underlined) in case a non OT-savvy app is used. If you wish to obtain exactly the same prints as the original Swissa Piccola typewriter, you should set your font at 11.3 pt and 19.5 pt of line spacing. The Swissa Piccola font was originally offered in a dedicated limited edition packaging.\n\nAn Swish is a unique handwritten font. Crafted in ink to become digital. Initially it was created as a kind of textural filling of spaces - walls, posters, clothes. In the process of creation, it became clear that it can solve different problems. It can become a logo or a great solution for identity. With the apparent density of the set and the negligence of the forms, it remains quite readable. It can work with different spacing options. There is a feature in the font that changes the second character when two identical letters meet. Also added icons (lightning, heart, eye) that can decorate your projects.\n\nRevolution Gothic P font family is designed based on Revolution Gothic and a distressed offshoot from the original. Revolution Gothic is an arranged and extended version of PAG Revolucion released from Prop-A-Ganda type foundry in 2008. The original font is inspired by retro propaganda posters and wallpainting in Cuba from the 60s to 80s. And the original PAG Revolucion is the most popular font from Prop-A-Ganda. The glyphs that damaged by printing the original had been tweaked by hand work with great care to be looked like natural damaged effect. This Revolution Gothic P family contains basic Roman, Italic, Bold and it’s Italic to suit a wide range of your creative works and it will be one of the most powerful solutions for printing and web.\n\nReleased on the occasion of the 2012 London Olympics, Olympukes 2012 was a new set of pictograms telling the ‘real’ story of the Olympics and extending the unofficial project that began in 2004. The occasion of the London games provided an opportunity to revisit the complex contradictions of the modern Olympics and to acknowledge the geopolitical shifts of the intervening eight years. The 2012 games arrived at a time of great economic and political uncertainty for the nation and Europe. Greece – the host of the 2004 games – was now located at Ground Zero of a disintegrating Eurozone and the United Kingdom was two years into a programme of austerity enacted by the coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Given that the previous London Olympics had been held in 1948, in a climate of recovery and austerity after a devastating World War (1948’s Olympiad was dubbed the ‘Austerity Games’) there was a sick irony to the 2012 games' arrival. The suppression of human rights in order to deliver the perfect games for PRoC’s Beijing games shocked no-one and yet, in London, the security measures seemed grossly excessive. Then again, in a country with an estimated 1.8 million cctv cameras, perhaps we shouldn’t have been so surprised. Another aspect of the Olympics that returned for 2012 was the unfettered commercialism – if you think the Games are about pure sport, about noble human endeavour, think again.

It is a calligraphic style that always being seen in traditional Chinese banquet menu. Incorporated a feeling of masculinity, fill with strength and energy and attracts eyeballs of customers. It was written with a thin ball pen in a unique, personal and expressive writing style, such that it is realistic, natural and masculine. Contrast of strokes is low and the text is visible and eye-catching. Its light to medium stems (豎) make it suitable for small text to subheading with little conglutination. All strokes are irregular, inconsistent, irregularly oriented and tightly coupled. Spatial distribution, positioning, size and relative proportion of radicals fully reflect a natural and personal style. It is one of the few proportional-width font in a full scale. It is best suited for casual lively atmosphere, illustrations, set upright (non-slanted), non-condensed."
