        "text": "It came from a distant solar system, beyond any space we know. With superior knowledge and the ability to totally destroy the world as we know it...unless we act now...and find the strength to...arghhh... Naaah, I am just pulling your leg. The Serious Damage font could be used for something dramatic as the font for a movie poster, featuring the next \"earth will be destroyed by aliens\" movie. But it is suitable for more than that! With its straight lines and chunky letters, dramatic or not, Serious Damage could be a good choice!\n\nSelected as one of “Our Favorite Typefaces of 2013” by Typographica.org, Dark Angel is the first completely new take in decades on the traditional “blackletter” font style. It began its journey towards the light years ago when this style was born as a sketch for a new logo for the California Angels baseball team (renamed shortly thereafter the Anaheim Angels). The Angels logo never happened, but that sketch has risen from the dead and become the basis for this brand new font design—and was also the source for the name. It’s kind of blackletter in feel, but as a display font it’s so much more. It is far more legible than most “Old English” or “Gothic Script” styles, and incorporates many features never before seen in them, such as swashes, tails and a plethora of ligatures. Dark Angel can be purchased in its regular solid form, or as Dark Angel Underlight—a handtooled font. If these two fonts are purchased together, the Family package will contain a third font—Dark Angel Highlight. With this font layered over the basic font, you can achieve two–color typesetting when the highlight and the base font are assigned two different colors. Dark Angel has enough language support to make the builders of Babel envious—its 1,163 glyphs can be used to set copy in 59 different languages. From A to Z: Afrikaans, Albanian, Basque, Bemba, Bosnian, Catalan, Cornish, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Filipino, Finnish, French, Galician, Ganda, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Kalaallisut, Kamba, Kikuyu, Kinyarwanda, Lithuanian, Luo, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Manx, Morisyen, North Ndebele, Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Nyankole, Oromo, Polish, Portuguese, Romansh, Sango, Shona, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Swiss German, Turkish, Welsh, and last (but not least) Zulu. PLEASE NOTE: Dark Angel is a cross-platform font which depends to some extent on certain advanced OpenType features, therefore it can be used to its full potential only with programs that support those features. ADDITIONALLY: When setting Dark Angel one should ALWAYS select the “Standard Ligatures\" and “Contextual Alternates” buttons in your OpenType palette. Please see the “Read–Me–First!” file in the Gallery section.\n\nSporty and brawly, Magnesit Dark creates impact everywhere it lands. Impressive headlines are its specialty, but it feels right at home used in packaging, branding and poster design. Very tall x-height, wide language support and minimalistic yet playful appearance, make it suitable on any serious typographic job. Three distinct styles expand the possibilites even further: the straight to the point Regular, the friendly Soft and the determined Hard styles share metrics across related Magnesit and Magnesit Stencil families, so you can mix and match to achieve exactly the effect you need. Magnesit Dark works great with illustrations, the generous shapes can be easily filled with strong imagery to great effect. Based on the best-selling Grim, Magnesit is a vast improvement of the concept with long awaited addition of lowercase, reworked proportions, spacing and kerning, expanded language support and useful icons to satisfy even the most demanding typographers’ needs.\n\nI was in a bit of a gloomy mood just before I created this font. I had no inspiration whatsoever (which always affects me in a bad way). I was trying to create a font using broken satay skewers, as using those gives the letters a unique look. I broke about 25 skewers and they all broke ‘the wrong way’. Yes, it’s pathetic, I know, but that’s how it is. I decided to go to the gym and do a little workout, hoping my dark mood would pass. When I came back, I broke one more skewer and lo and behold, it broke exactly the right way! I made this font in one go, using that fantastic skewer and lots of Chinese ink. Darkness Rising comes with all the diacritics you’ll need, plus double letter ligatures and some cool underlined alternates.\n\nDARK LIGHT is a graffiti-style display font with individuality in each letter. Use this font to create a unique style that will pique the interest of many people. Not only that, but your project will look more attractive and natural if you use it. This graffiti font is great for product logos, poster titles, headlines, packaging, film titles, logotypes, gorgeous writing, and trendy graffiti designs, among other things. Of course, if you utilize this font in your numerous creative projects, they will be perfect and outstanding. Use this typeface right away for your one-of-a-kind and remarkable projects."
