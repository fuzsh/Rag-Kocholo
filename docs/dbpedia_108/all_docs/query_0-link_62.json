It's beautifully legible, offers an excellent reading experience, and has a superior typographic range that includes accents, non-Latin characters, and more.…",

        "text": "I like it in the screenshot, but that isn’t how it looks on my laptop! It looks all blotchy to me 😦 (especially the “i”s and “l”s)\n\nI completely disagree. I was a graphic Designer for 35 years and have always found that for large blocks of copy, serif typefaces are easier for the eye to distinguish. That’s why you don’t see many books printed with sans serif typefaces, and when you do see it, it just looks…off. More examples are newspapers and dictionaries. It may be that we are just more familiar with serif faces, but I only use a sans serif when I’m using it for a headline or to make a point, otherwise, it confuses the eye. being dyslexic myself, I find the serif faces give each character more difference and I’m able to pick out individual letter with more ease. And as a personal style preference, I think sans serif faces just look cheap. Sorry.\n\nI have to say I don’t like it. I really hate simple things – its another word for STUPID. The font is harder to read. the font has little curves and its really just artsy and overstylish. I suppose WP doesn’t care about people loosing their vision with harder to read fonts. People do in fact age over time, and these fonts don’t help.\n\nTo be frank all these SANS typefaces are really overrated.\n\nRobert Seth Vorisek, You are only partially right 😉 Also, sorry…\n\nIt has long been known that serif fonts used in print and on the web without serifs. And all because of a difference in the perception of the eye of information (text) that we see on the printed material (when the light is off), and on the screen. I understand what you are – because also worked in magazines and on the web. And I fully support the author of this article. ‘Open Sans’ not only free, perfect looks on the screen (which is very important), but it is also multilingual. What is very important for the web. (Sorry my English ;)) I hope all understood me)\n\nIt’s not really all that different though, is it? I like it well enough but I do think it will be much more difficult for the visually impaired to read & work with.\n\nMaybe it’s just my laptop but the text looks thinner and paler than before. I can probably get along ok with it but I do hope you will change it again, if you should get lots of co,plaints from bloggers with eyesight difficulties.\n\nI generally like sans serif fonts, but in this case I personally don’t find it the best solution. I too have the issue with confusing “i” and “l” and the letters in the body look “dirty”, not well-defined, and I’m on win 7 on chrome which is supposed to look good.\n\nAnd the serif font in the headline was looking more elegant than now. But it’s a matter of personal preference, since wp is the coolest thing since cms systems.\n\nIf I will manage to get the font to look clean, I’ll be happy. Then the rest doesn’t matter if it doesn’t affect my themes.\n\nOpen Sans …. gives the whole page an open feel – just like it says on the tin! Reading Patrick’s concern about his eyesight, I wonder if its worth seeing if a .0something added weight would make a tiny but magical difference to those with sight struggles? VP who cites “studies” that recommend other typefaces – the best study of all is being brave enough to try something new, gauge response and go from there. I reckon WordPress, you’ve got this pretty spot on – marvelous!\n\nYou’ll forgive me, but In stark contrast to a few of the above posts, t’was the first thing that I noticed upon publishing my very next article, which I’d lovingly articulated in elegant Georgia font, only to be momentarily defaulted into Open Sans hell. I must say that I was appalled. Simplicity is the bleach of life, and Open Sans is an attempt at artificial perfection, a sad, lifeless and anemic font. Georgia, by comparison, is a warm fire on a snowy, moonless night.\n\nI agree with the graphic designer above. Serifs are there for a purpose and that purpose is character recognition. I’ve worked in newspaper design for 20 years and the golden rule is use a serif typeface for large blocks of text. Readers’ eyes tire more easily with a sans face because character recognition becomes harder. For captions, panels, small posts, design features, headlines, the new sans face is ideal and elegant. But if you’re producing posts that are text-led, then choose serif every time.\n\nI don’t like it. It is way too thin, especially on a retina screen. This is partially a design problem – there needs to be more use of contrasting weights to help distinguish the hierarchy of information. The pair kerning looks amateurish, but maybe this is a browser rendering issue. The letterforms are reminiscent of some of the more awful sans serifs of the 1980s; don’t get me started on the numerals.\n\nHistoricity should play a part in typeface choice for any project; the helvetica family, while bland, ubiquitous and a bad choice for body text, at least speaks of “elegant, well-architectured” and considered design. Open Sans was designed to enhance the readability of body text, but it just looks awful in just about every other instance.\n\nThis looks like a work in progress — I note that there are several places where helvetica is still being used, and my wordpress.com dashboards are still using helvetica. I have always associated consistency as a value of the WordPress brand — so why does this feel so half-baked?\n\nMy suggestion — find a companionable serif for headings, and make more use of contrasts in weight.\n\nI do agree with the several peeps who’ve noted that serif faces have always been more legible than sans. Are we just used to sans online? Or is it a function of the medium? Do serif faces look better in hi-rez print, but on lower rez screens do the serifs just get messy and sans becomes functionally more legible?\n\nBut my real question is why in your A-B sample does the new face look SO much better and clearer? Does it have a larger x-height? Or do the old faces have a “fuzz” around them. For sure it looks great, but it actually looks so great, it makes me wonder if there’s another effect also in place.\n\nAfter a couple of wonderful years at wordpress.com we recently migrated to a self-hosted installation. Any info on how to use Open Sans in that environment?\n\nI do hear the peeps that complain Open Sans is too stark and minimal, but the improved legibility is so dramatic, to me it can only be a win. Thanks & Congratulations!"
