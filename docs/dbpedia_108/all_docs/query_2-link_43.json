In this concept, I (digitally) installed the collection Badass Libre Fonts by Womxn, a project of Loraine Furter, in Baltimoreâs brutalist KAGRO building. Badass Fonts is free, feminist, open-source, and exists only online. How do those values and resources become physical?\n\nThe concept includes a space that is free and open â because space is a resource â in which the public can modify material by screenprinting typefaces onto it. The former deposit box is converted to a mailbox, and a typographic mural activates the side of the building facing the art school MICA. Windows are added to the building's simple, Brutalist form to ensure a level of transparancy that mirrors the form and values of the Badass Libre Fonts website. Leslie Fienberg, a who was a typesetter before a writer documenting queer/trans* experience, reminds of what âhas not yet been writtenâ on the front of the facade.\n\nShoshana Schultz\n\nWeb: www.shoshanarose.work\n\nInstagram: @shoshana__rose\n\nONÂ SHOW Â­â Exhibition by the MICAÂ Design League at MICA Baltimore, March 2019\n\nPicture Ellen Lupton\n\nABeeZee by Anja Meiners is a childrenâs learning font. Open, friendly and simple, the definite shapes support the process of learning to read and write. The italic carefully reminds young readers of fluent writing movements and inspires them to create their own unique handwriting.\n\nAbhaya Libre by Sol Matas and Pushpanada Ekanayake is a Latin and Sinhala font (Sri Lanka), inspired by the style of the original Sinhala, with the notable inherent contrast in between thick and thin strokes, was modified to tally with the visualization logics of Latin typefaces.\n\nAbril Fatface by Veronika Burian and JosÃ© Scaglione is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance.\n\nÃcrata (Serifas) by Aspacia Kusulas, Karla Mateos, Romina HernÃ¡ndez, Sandra Morales y Tamara Segura, is a font made to smash the Patriarchy. It was developed, as part of the 1st Typographic Tournament of the LetrÃ¡stica Community 2020 in Mexico.\n\nAlmendra by Ana Sanfelippo is a typeface design based on calligraphy. Its style is related to the chancery and gothic hands. It is intended to be used in long texts, especially young childrenâs literature.\n\nAlmendra Display by Ana Sanfelippo is a typeface design based on calligraphy. Its style is related to the chancery and gothic hands. It is intended to be used in long texts, especially young childrenâs literature.\n\nAmarante by Karolina Lach uses unconventional Art Nouveau inspired shapes. Amarante is a display face but works surprisingly well in text and headlines too.\n\nAmaranth by Gesine Todt is a friendly upright italic design with a slight contrast and distinctive curves.\n\nAndada by Carolina Giovagnoli is a text font with an organic-slab serif, hybrid style, a solid design of medium stroke contrast.\n\nAnthony by Sun Young Oh is inspired from artworks by British sculptor Anthony Caro. The form of this typeface comes from his sculptures that are leaning against each other. The typeface is packed with alternates for most letters that are pseudo-randomly picked when you write some text. Sun Young Oh is a graphic designer from South Korea who studied graphic design in HfG Karlsruhe in Germany. Her focus lies in building and experimenting with new tools to create humour and play through design. She often applies random combinatorics through a self-generated system to produce unexpected visual results.\n\nArbutus Slab by Karolina Lach is a sturdy, medium contrast, slab serif typeface inspired by 18th and 19th American jobbing type. The generous spacing found in this design means that it can be used at fairly small sizes which makes it surprisingly versatile.\n\nArmata by Viktoriya Grabowska is a low contrast sans serif text face, with a mixture of familiar and unfamiliar shapes.\n\nAsadera by Las Plebes (MÃ³nica Elizabeth MunguÃ­a Cejudo, Rebeca Anaya Martinez, Jassiel Rivera Arreola, Karla P. Pasten LÃ³pez y Nitzchia Elena DÃ­az Zazueta) is a Neo-grotesque sans-serif font that features a low contrast, which is ideal to be used for UI and web projects. It was developed, as part of the 1st Typographic Tournament of the LetrÃ¡stica Community 2020 in Mexico.\n\nAsul by Mariela Monsalve can be described as a baroque humanist typface. It has semi-serifs and it is a type revival project developed for editorial use. It is based on a typeface found in some Argentinian books and magazines from the early 20th century.\n\nAuthentic Sans 60, 90, 130, 150 by Christina Janus and Desmond Wong is a typeface intended for situations where Oriya Sangam MN seems too sophisticated and LiHei Pro too vulgar, or vice versa. Authentic Sans explores the semiotic and aesthetic idiosyncrasies of the anonymous Latin glyphs included with CJK system fonts; the typeface aims to subvert the Eurocentric standards of typographic quality and refinement.\n\nAuthentic Sans Condensed 60, 90, 130, 150 by Christina Janus and Desmond Wong is a typeface intended for situations where Oriya Sangam MN seems too sophisticated and LiHei Pro too vulgar, or vice versa. Authentic Sans explores the semiotic and aesthetic idiosyncrasies of the anonymous Latin glyphs included with CJK system fonts; the typeface aims to subvert the Eurocentric standards of typographic quality and refinement.\n\nBitter by Sol Matas is a contemporary slab serif typeface for text, specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device.\n\nCaladea by Carolina Giovagnoli and Andres Torresi is a modern, friendly serif font which works with Afrikaans, Baltic, Basic Latin, Catalan, Central European, Dutch, Esperanto, Euro, Turkish and Western European languages.\n\nCambay by Pooja Saxena is a libre Devanagari typeface family designed to match the Latin Cantarell. It comes in two weights, Regular and Bold, in upright and oblique styles. The oblique styles are slanted with only the absolutely necessary optical corrections.\n\nCambo by Carolina Giovagnoli and AndrÃ©s Torresi is a modern Latin typeface inspired by the contrast, style and ornaments of Khmer typefaces and writing styles. Its main objective is to be used to write Latin texts in a Khmer context, but it is also an elegant choice for all kinds of texts.\n\nCantata One by Joana Correia is a high contrast extended Didone style text face. In addition to being useful in medium to large text sizes, Cantata One is meant to evoke luxury when used in display sizes. Cantata One was originally inspired by hand written letters made with a pointed pen on an old handmade map of New York City.\n\nCapriola by Viktoriya Grabowska is a sans-serif typeface whose unique style draws upon forms seen in handwriting and italic types. Skeletons of the most characteristic glyphs are inspired by quick handwriting and based on a single hand movement (G,a,g,k,e).\n\nCatamaran by Pria Ravichandran Latin and Tamil text type family designed for the digital age. The Tamil is monolinear and was designed alongside the sans serif Latin and Devanagari family Palanquin.\n\nCherry Swash by Nataliya Kasatkina is a contemporary, monolinear slab-serif with eye-catching forms and elegant swash capitals.\n\nCirrus Cumulus, dessinÃ©e par Clara Sambot, est une typographie sans courbes mais avec plusieurs alternatives au point mÃ©dian et des glyphes inclusifs et non-binaires. CirrusCumulus by Clara Sambot was designed without using curves and is a hybridization of two styles: it has a lineal-style lowercase set, as well as a script-like uppercase set, while some glyphs adopt italic forms which produce unusual combinations, arabesques and ligatures. CirrusCumulus includes a large panel of characters that can be used to draw figures, shapes or patterns, a variable ligature system, and many non-binary and inclusive glyphs.\n\nCoconat Regular and Bold Extented by Sara Lavazza is an arrogant two style non-conventional type family: a flared fair-proportioned regular style which changes completely its impact in the extended bold version.\n\nCombine, dessinÃ©.e par Julie Patard, est hybride, sa structure est fluide et ses dÃ©liÃ©s sont dÃ©calÃ©s. La Combine est en perpÃ©tuelle Ã©volution depuis 2018, et elle contient les glyphes inclusifs qui permettent de s'adresser Ã tous.tes les indisciplinÃ©.es, les rÃ©sistant.es et Ã touxx les amoureux.ses de la libertÃ©. La Combine combine plusieurs types de typo, elle est nÃ©e de l'intersection des courbes d'une linÃ©ale et d'une didone.\n\nCompagnon Light and Roman by Juliette DuhÃ© and LÃ©a Pradine finds its inspiration in the online archives of Typewriter Database specimens and combines different periods of the history of typewriter typefaces.\n\nCompagnon Bold by ChloÃ© Lozano is a bolder script member of the Compagnon family below. Inspired by typewriter archives, it brings the constraint of being a linked script monospace.\n\nCourgette by Karolina Lach is a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface. The genre is traditionally used at large sizes but Courgette was carefully made for the web, with low stroke contrast that works well in smaller sizes and even in text.\n\nDauphine regular et italic (et Dingbats, â¦), dessinÃ©e par Coline Sunier, StÃ©phanie Vilayphiou, Alexandre Leray et Charles MazÃ© dans le contexte de la nouvelle identitÃ© de l'ÃSAD Valence, est une typographie sans sÃ©rif basÃ©e sur des lettrages relevÃ©s sur des cartographies de la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cle jusquâau milieu du XXe siÃ¨cle, et conÃ§ue dâaprÃ¨s des modÃ¨les pour dessinateurs industriels ou cartographes franÃ§ais et amÃ©ricains. La graisse et les formes de la Dauphine se rapprochent des signes mono-linÃ©aires utilisÃ©s en cartographie tout en faisant rÃ©fÃ©rence aux modÃ¨les destinÃ©s Ã lâapprentissage de lâÃ©criture par le squelette des lettres. La Dauphine est lâunique typographie de lâidentitÃ© visuelle et est utilisÃ©e sur lâensemble des supports. Elle se compose dâun romain, dâune italique (romain penchÃ©) et de dingbats dans une graisse moyenne.
