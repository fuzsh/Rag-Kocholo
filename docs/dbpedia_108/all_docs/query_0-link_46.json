        "text": "The Freight Collection comprises a compelling array of intertwined typeface families ready to add unique style to any project. What Joshua Darden started as a serif family inspired by the warmth and pragmatism found in 18th-century Dutch typefaces now ranges across multiple weights, widths, and optical sizes — from Big, Display, Text, Micro, Macro, and Sans — all of which include companion italics. That’s 156 fonts that can be bold and daring as effortlessly as they can be quiet and unassuming."
