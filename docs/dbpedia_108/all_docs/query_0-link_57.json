        "text": "Ink!Sans is an out!code character who does not belong to any specific alternative universe (AU) of Undertale. He exists out of them but can interact with them. Ink!Sans supports the artists to keep contributing to the fandom and generally embodies an artistic aesthetic that even follows him in his combat abilities.\n\nWhat is an AU? An AU (or alternative universe) is a spin-off of an official storyline/concept that explores the different possibilities of said concept by putting characters in a different setting, with different abilities, or in different social situations, etc. In this case, Undertale’s storylines and characters have AUs based on them. The entirety of the AUs is called the Multiverse.\n\nThe fandom’s production (mostly of those said AUs) are Ink’s essence of living; as long as it’s creative and productive, he’s healthy and energic.\n\nInk!Sans can appear everywhere in any AU of his liking from any kind of liquid. He uses them as portals.\n\nHis big brush gives him the ability to create anything he likes and make it come to life, with the exception of dead characters.\n\nRegarding fights, Ink!Sans finds purpose in trying to limit the damage done by other out!code characters who wish to disrupt the original scripts of AUs. That includes people who wish to undo the consequences of genocide timelines. Ink!Sans prioritizes the respect of timelines’ scenarios over emotional conflicts.\n\nInk!Sans does not create AUs nor characters. He simply likes to think that he guards them from what he considers to be anomalies to the original scripts and intentions of the creators.\n\nThis is Ink!Sans’s official FAQ. Any other wiki or faq page about him with additional information is not verified.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- OFFICIAL DESIGN -\n\nCheck out this post for notes about his outfit and additionnal doodles.\n\nThe following bits of information are based on Ink’s lore and backstory. You can read more in the backstory section.\n\nBrown overwhelms the palette because it is often the color gotten when all paints are mixed together.\n\nYellow and green being the first colors Ink experienced, they both have a tribute in the outfit.\n\nInk tuck in his overalls and wears them as pants.\n\nLack of shoes translate his carefreeness and mobility.\n\nThe light green color on his gloves simulates the tablet glove digital artists use.\n\nThe white undershirt speaks of how Ink attempts to cover his lack of soul, but his emptiness sometimes shines through.\n\nInk!Sans often tries mixes of paints and scribbles notes on his scarf because of his bad memory.\n\nHis pupils change shape and color every time he blinks. It is speculated that they represent an AU with each shape and color combination, and each time they appear, it means Ink is watching the AU’s events unfurl through his eyes as if he was constantly observing. Ink claims that the shapes and colors are just random. They are never seen in white.\n\nThe rainbow vials on his stash belt are paint bottles with heart-shaped tops that cover the range of the rainbow.\n\nHis brush is most of the time carried on his back.\n\nUnder all the clothes, his bones are colored and marked by strange shapes.\n\n♦ What are his heart-shaped vials for?\n\nHis vials keep paints of color that are adapted just for him, and each vial gives him a range of emotions. He fills them at his Doodlesphere regularly. Ink needs these since he doesn’t have a soul and can’t feel on his own. Drinking a bit of all of them regularly allows him to maintain a normal constitution. If anyone else tried drinking them, it would just taste like paint.\n\n♦ Which emotions do they all represent then?\n\nRed is wrath/aggressivity, and yellow/orange is euphoria. Between these two colors, there is a hue of emotions for all the other colors, and it is up to you to think of their meanings :-)\n\n♦ Why do his eyes change shapes and colors?\n\nInk has the tendency to drink a bit of all the colors at once to be able to balance the feelings and act as close to a normal person who can control his emotions and react accordingly to most situations. Since all the colors are into his body at the same time, his eyes feature all of them.\n\n♦ Do shapes have particular meanings too?\n\nNot really, that’s pretty random. Two canon shapes do have meanings: his eyes are shaped like yellow stars when he’s excited or amazed, and one turns into a red target when he is fighting an enemy.\n\n♦ Does Ink not having shoes hurt his feet?\n\nInk hardly feels physical pain like most skeleton characters. That’s what having bones for a body does! And being soulless plays a role in that too.\n\n♦ Does Ink blush in rainbow?\n\nYes, he does! He also happens to grow momentaneous rainbow freckles when he is positively emotional.\n\n♦ Does Ink have a rainbow tongue?\n\nYes, he does!\n\n♦ Is there an official human design for Ink!Sans?\n\nThere currently isn’t an official human version of this design!\n\nInk used to have an older outfit:\n\nThis design was heavily inspired from CookieHana ( https://www.deviantart.com/cookiehana )’s Pokemon trainer character Pen. The issue is the reason why the outfit was changed. Read this post for the whole explanation!\n\n♦ Will I still be able to use Ink’s main old design?\n\nI would ask you to please prioritize Ink’s new design, given the circumstances. I know I cannot stop everyone from using this old design, and I will not come for you if you use it. I would simply want my wish to be respected given I allow people to use him for so many projects, professional ones included.\n\n♦ Will I have to scrap the artworks I made of Ink in his old design but did not post yet? Will I have to change to Ink’s new design in my comics/animations immediately?\n\nYou don’t need to scrap your artwork of Ink’s older design! Please feel free to finish it and post it online, I will absolutely not hold it against you. You are also free to conclude your comics and animations with Ink’s old design if it was already started before the announcement and you can’t make the new design fit at all. I will only ask that if you can make the change of Ink’s design fit with your storylines and start using it from there, please do so as soon as you can. I would really appreciate it. <3\n\n♦ Will the alternative versions of Ink (like Fresh!Ink) have to change designs too?\n\nNo, characters like Fresh!Ink or specific designs you made of Ink to fit in your AUs do not have to change!\n\n♦ Will you revamp Fresh!Ink’s design?\n\nAt the moment, I don’t plan to! I would rather let the monstrosity be what it is! :-)\n\n♦ Can we still draw the alternate outfits you made of Ink?\n\nIf you are talking about these two following designs, yes, you can absolutely continue using them! <3\n\n♦ Will these two alternate outfits get revamped?\n\nI’m not planning to currently!\n\n♦ Will all of the Ink fusions/fan children have to change designs too?\n\nNo, they do not require a change either at all!\n\n♦ Which outfit do you like more?\n\nI’m happy with what I did for the 2020 design, but Ink is still Ink and I honestly love him regardless of what he wears! <3 On that note, people are totally free to create outfits for him as they have in the past!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- PERSONALITY -\n\n♦ What’s his character like? (personality, quirks...)\n\nInk!Sans has a tendency to get too excited about things. He also has very short memory and will forget about different things - sometimes stopping mid-sentence to try and remember what he just said a few seconds before.\n\nHe is very passionate about art and likes to motivate characters and creators. He’s able to change clothes on people just by a paint of his brush, and he loves to create the kind of outfit they like. Even though he uses art as a tool, no one really saw his drawings or paintings.\n\nHe’s a mischief-maker. Pranks are his guilty pleasure.\n\nInk in general acts wittily and provocatively.\n\nWith him hardly having a proper social understanding, he’s blunt in his teasing and mocking just like in his ability to give support and to be kind.\n\nHe’s really forgetful (which is why he takes notes on his scarf).\n\nInk approaches enemies carefully. He will never try to attack them first, but will mostly focus on trying to discover their motives and talk them through it. Although he does come off as a jerk in first impression, he does know what to analyze to understand the issue so he can brush people the right way and hopefully have them listen.\n\nHe loses his pencils all the time.\n\nHe happens to sometimes randomly vomit ink, mostly when he gets too emotionally shaken, whether from passion or shock.\n\nInk supports all kinds of art, like painting, literature, dance, music, etc.\n\nHe is afraid of whiteness, of absence of presences or shapes around him, loneliness, huge empty spaces...\n\nInk does not appear as a perfectly well-behaved character. He can sometimes be inconsiderate in his mocking and cruel in his opinions, and deep down he sees other characters as story characters and not as people like him like a proper story would. He has a very special morality that sometimes shows to be really separated from his emotions. He can be identified as chaotic neutral.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- BACKSTORY -\n\nBefore asking any question related to this subject, please first check out the His Story comicwhich retraces Ink’s backstory.\n\n♦ What is Ink’s original name?\n\nThe same name as his original AU.\n\n♦ What is Ink’s original AU? Who made it?\n\n_____tale. The owner does not have a proper identity, it could be anybody.\n\n♦ Did Ink tear off his soul?\n\nYes, he did. He erased himself from his AU which had only one unfinished timeline with no possibility to reset.\n\n♦ Where did he end up?\n\nHe ended up in what will become his Doodle sphere.\n\n♦ What happened to his old AU?\n\nIt supposedly stayed exactly the same, unfinished and forgotten.\n\n♦ Who is the artist that splashed him with colors?\n\nIt could be anyone in the fandom. You, your friend, or any artist ever!\n\n♦ Where do those tattoos come from?\n\nHis tattoos are extremely tiny, nearly unreadable bits of binary. They are parts of the multiverse’s core code that stuck onto him and formed marks on him when he traveled from his AU to what will become his Doodle sphere. :-)\n\n♦ If Ink runs out of those paints and is unable to refill them until the colors in him eventually fade, what would happen?\n\nInk would become a husk, like an empty shell. He will simply stop moving, responding, and will not have any of his senses working. Ink’s body can be completely controlled by someone else, but his ink abilities will not be available anymore until he is refilled with paints. Surprisingly enough, it’s very easy to defeat him!\n\n♦ Why doesn’t Ink just make himself/steal a soul?\n\nHis duty to protect the timelines forbids him to steal a soul for himself. He also cannot make himself a soul because he cannot revive what is dead. Although he knows his emotion vials have a weakness, he believes it is a better advantage than a soul that can be visible and destroyed. Let’s say it’s less expected. :-)\n\n- THE STATE OF HIS STORY COMIC -\n\nThe narratory caption webcomic “His Story”, Ink’s backstory, has been officially marked as complete on the 5/23/2020. Although part 6 wasn’t planned to be the final part of the comic, it hasn’t been updated for 3 years and I honestly had already made the most important parts about his backstory already. I will gladly keep talking, drawing and reblogging art or content of him regardless! <3 Ink is an abandoned project who managed to pull himself out of his situation to turn into this grand, known figure of protection and creation, and all this journey comes with its consequences and traumas. He is an insecure, self-centered character with abandonment issues who has a hard time trusting his emotions. He is a paradoxical spin-off of the concept of Undertale’s original multiverse fandom! :-)\n\nThe comic stops on Ink discovering a portal between his Doodle Sphere and the multiverse, which is the beginning of his tale as a multiverse out!code character. He discovers the different AUs and believes that the strength and emotions he has been given were accidental gifts from the creators and, just as much as it is for selfish reasons (to stay alive and feel like his existence has purpose), he decides from there to claim himself as a guardian of these universes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- ADDITIONAL LORE AND FACTS -\n\n♦ When was Ink created?\n\nHe was created in January 2016!\n\n♦ How did you come up with the idea of Ink?\n\nI was trying to find a new AU concept because I was very unsatisfied with my contributions to the fandom, and I really wanted to try my hand at an out!code character. I came across a picture of a brush made specifically for chinese and japanese ink, and it sort of clicked. I thought it would be fitting to have something that fit the incredible dynamic and power the newly AU Multiverse craze was starting to be, and that a version of Sans supporting the various creations that were appearing would be cute! :-)\n\n♦ Why did you base yourself on Sans and not another character?\n\nSans was my favorite at the time, and the awareness he had on how he was part of a game that was bound to forever restart and trap him into silence was a groundbreaking character trait we had barely seen before, and it was what made him explode around the fandom.\n\n♦ What is the Doodle sphere?\n\nIt’s basically Ink’s personal multiverse. If you know how HTML and CSS work, the multiverse’s core code is the HTML and his Doodle sphere is the CSS that goes with it (the core code is the mechanic and the Doodle sphere is the design that makes it pretty and possible to visit.)\n\nThe Doodle sphere is a colorful world where big-sized buckets float. Each bucket is an AU. The liquid in these buckets is a portal inside the AU.\n\nInk doesn’t exactly live to a designated area, he travels all the time. The Doodle sphere just happens to be his “base” to come back to.\n\n♦ What are Ink’s weapons?\n\nAs written above, Ink is not one to attack first for two reasons: he would rather solve conflict rather than attack someone, and fighting uses a lot of ink out of him. The vials he drinks are not only used for emotions, they are also what enables him to manipulate ink and summon his various capacities. Although not necessary for him to manipulate ink, his big brush is a vessel to concentrate his powers and have more precision and range. This brush feels light to him, but is relatively heavy for anybody else.\n\nOut of this ink stored inside him, he can create different moves, implying Sans-like attacks, like black colored bones and blasters. Those blasters shoot ink that can boil or solidify.\n\n♦ What are Ink’s hobbies other than his role as a guardian?\n\nHe plays the flute! He also enjoys learning how to sew so he doesn’t always rely on his powers.\n\n♦ What is Ink’s assigned font?\n\nHis assigned font is Note this! (https://www.dafont.com/note-this.font) but there’s absolutely no obligation to use it! <3\n\n♦ When is Ink’s birthday?\n\nIt’s on April 15, World’s Art day! :-)\n\n♦ What is Ink’s canon gender?\n\nInk is a male and uses he/him/they/them pronouns.\n\n♦ What are Ink’s canon height and weight?\n\nInk is slightly shorter than original Sans (Comic Sans = 4 feet, so Ink Sans = 3.8 feet).\n\nHe doesn’t weigh much since he’s all bones and fabric, but he does look “big-boned” (meaning his bones are wide, literally lmao.)\n\n♦ Is Ink ambidextrous (meaning he uses both hands to draw and write)?\n\nYes he is!\n\n♦ What is Ink’s canon age?\n\nInk doesn’t really age, but the way he’s portrayed simulates an adult in his twenties.\n\n♦ Is it okay if I draw him / RP him with another gender, age or height?\n\nOf course, as long as you don’t force your opinion on others. If people blame you for not respecting his original gender, kindly link them to this FAQ to show them that I see no problem with my character being portrayed this way. <3\n\n♦ What is Ink’s canon sexuality?\n\nInk is not interested in being in a romantic or sexual relationship with anyone.\n\n♦ Is it okay if I draw him / RP him with another sexuality?\n\nOf course, as long as you don’t force your opinion on others. If people blame you for not respecting his original sexuality, kindly link them to this FAQ to show them that I see no problem with my character being portrayed this way. <3\n\n♦ Who is Ink canonly shipped with?\n\nInk isn’t and won’t be canonly paired with a partner.\n\n♦ Is it okay if I draw him / RP him with a partner?\n\nOf course, as long as you don’t force your opinion on others. If people blame you for not respecting his original situation, kindly link them to this FAQ to show them that I see no problem with my character being portrayed this way. <3\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- INK!SANS & OTHER AUS -\n\n♦ What are the AUs he visited?\n\nPossibly as much as he can!\n\n♦ Are there any other Ink!Characters?\n\nThere are currently no other official characters related to Ink!Sans or what we could call the Inktale AU.\n\n♦ Are you the one who designed Fresh!Ink?\n\nI am! This is the post I made about his design!\n\n♦ What are Ink’s relationships with Undertop!Gaster and Zephyrtale!Gaster?\n\nUndertop Gaster ( @under-top ) is one of Ink’s father figures. They slowly bonded over the wisdom and experiences the reality of knowing of the out!code world gives. Although Gaster has two sons (Undertop Sans and Papyrus), he does consider Ink as part of his family. Gaster is a charismatic ringleader who plays pretend as an in!code, but he has a lot of insomnias, hallucinations and nightmares from his past as an out!code as well as the genocide timelines of Undertop following him. He often talks about it with Ink. Ink is very curious about Gaster’s unending desire to refuse to embrace his out!code state and purposefully blend in his AU, but he relates about the idea of wanting to have a concrete place in the world. They allow themselves to have cynical talks about the Multiverse quite often, but they also manage to nurture a tender familial friendship through it.\n\nZephyrtale Gaster (or Aster) is part of one of my first Undertale AUs, Zephyrtale! Aster has been an in!code all his life until he met Undertop Gaster, and a little while later, Ink!Sans. He has ever since slowly been confronted to the knowledge of learning about the Multiverse and all that it implies and develops a passion for studying it with Ink’s help. They progressively develop a friendship, and thanks to Aster, Ink grows fond of learning how to do things without relying on his creative powers, like building machinery, creating blueprints and studying astrophysics. Although they did not bond the same way, Aster, just like Gaster, sees Ink like family too.\n\n♦ What are his relationships with Underswap!Sans, Error!Sans, Dream!Sans...\n\nIt’s up to you to decide which types of relationship you think fit the most! :-) As long as you don’t force your opinion on others or claim any of them to be canon.\n\nKnow that Ink is not canonly paired with anyone and that any couple including him is fan-made.\n\n♦ What do you think about Error!Sans x Ink!Sans?\n\nIt’s cute! People are creative with their dynamic. I’m glad you guys are having fun, that’s the whole point! Any shipping is welcome!\n\n♦ What are your thoughts on people using Ink for RPs / shippings / their own AUs / NSFW pieces / etc ?\n\nI don’t mind, I’m glad people are having fun with him. It’s his purpose after all! :-) As long as no one feels harmed in the process then it’s fine with me. The only thing that wouldn’t be fine is using him without credit!\n\n♦ I’ve been hearing about Ink and a Loveball event, what is that about?\n\nSomewhere in 2016 if I recall correctly, I participated in an Undertale community roleplay event called the Loveball where I was invited to roleplay as Ink!Sans. It was basically a lot of multiverse characters grouped in a big mansion for one evening, dressed up for a fancy party. This event was very popular and marked a big step for the development of the Multiverse part of the fandom.\n\n♦ Are there comics about Ink?\n\nInk in Underswap (canceled, it will not update anymore)\n\nHis Story (Ink’s backstory, completed)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- INKTOBERTALE -\n\n♦ What is Inktobertale?\n\n#inktobertale is a spin-off from the very famous Inktober challenge. During the month of October, a list of prompts for drawings about Ink!Sans will be released: each day will have an assigned prompt people can interpret and draw out! The challenge will continue every day until the 31st of the month. The point is to come up with creative ways to respond to the prompts using Ink!Sans and to manage to draw something every day until the end of the month!\n\n♦ Is it only about Ink!Sans?\n\nThis theme was created and voted as an Ink!Sans challenge, since there are a lot of other Undertale Inktober challenges. Inktobertale will focus on the character of Ink!Sans. However, you can include other characters to interact with him!\n\n♦ Does it only have to be traditional and inked?\n\nNo, you can work with any medium you want, even digitally! :-)\n\n♦ Am I obligated to do all the days / do the days in the right order?\n\nYou are free to skip, swap or alternate days as you like. Feel free to even swap between different Inktober challenges! The point is to have fun and experiment this month, so make this challenge a fun experience! <3\n\n♦ How many Inktobertale challenges have been organized so far?\n\nInktobertale has been organized every year since 2017. The next Inktobertale challenge will be organized in the upcoming October of 2021!\n\n♦ What are the tags for Inktobertale?\n\n#inktobertale\n\n#inktobertale(insertyear)\n\n#inktobertaleasks (this is the tag I use when answering questions about inktobertale)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- INK & THE PRISM COLLECTION -\n\n♦ What is the Prism Collection?\n\nThe Prism Collection was the name of an Undertale/Ink merch line I made for Ink’s fifth birthday in 2021. It was a 5-item sale that took place two times, first as a preorder sale from April to May and second as an extra-sale in late October.\n\nIt included an Undertale double-sided acrylic charm, an Ink holographic glitter sticker, an Ink 5 sticker-pack, an Ink wooden charm and an Ink print set of two exclusive artworks.\n\n♦ Will you sell these products / products including Ink, UT or your other AUs again?\n\nIt’s the only merch project including Ink I’ve planned to do and these products are not available for purchase anymore. My future merch will focus on personal themes and projects.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- INK!SANS TAGS -\n\n♦ What are the tags for Ink!Sans?\n\nI will always use either all or some of those tags on my posts:\n\nink!sans\n\nink sans\n\ninktale\n\nink fanart\n\ninkechos (this tag is for any post related to Ink that isn’t official or fan work)\n\n/!\\ #inkechos contains mostly secondary headcanons about Ink. If you have time to spare and want to know more about him and his interactions with other characters, I’d recommend you check out this tag on my blog!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- CONTACT & PERMISSION TO USE INK!SANS -\n\n♦ I want to send you an ask, where do I do that?\n\nYou can do it here!\n\nIf it does show you “not found”, it means the asks are closed. Please wait until they open again! :-)\n\n♦ I want to send you a submission, where do I do that?\n\nI’m not really comfortable with submissions, so I rarely open them. However, I will inform whenever I do!\n\nI can’t reply to all the asks I receive, I apologize. I either don’t have the time and/or will, or the answers are already there in the FAQ!\n\nI appreciate the gesture and especially the hard work and kindness if it’s fan art or something along those lines, but I reblog what I want to reblog. <3 I hope you understand!\n\nPlease do not make me a direct character of your comics, animations, etc. I do not feel comfortable being portrayed and characterized by people who do not me personally.\n\n♦ Can I repost your work if it’s with credit?\n\nNo. If you respect my work, do not repost it.
