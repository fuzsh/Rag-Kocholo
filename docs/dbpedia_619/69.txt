Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George

The Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George is a British order of chivalry founded on 28 April 1818 by George IV, Prince of Wales, while he was acting as prince regent for his father, King George III. It is named in honour of two military saints, Michael and George. The Order of St Michael and St George was originally awarded to those holding commands or high position in the Mediterranean territories acquired in the Napoleonic Wars, and was subsequently extended to holders of similar office or position in other territories of the British Empire. The Order’s motto is Auspicium melioris aevi (‘Token of a better age’). The banners of arms of the Knights and Dames Grand Cross are hung in the Chapel of the Order, which is in St Paul’s Cathedral. It is at present awarded to men and women who hold high office or who render extraordinary or important non-military service to the United Kingdom in a foreign country, and can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs.
