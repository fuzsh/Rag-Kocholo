        "text": "\"Point me!\"\n\nThis article is about the prestigious award. You may be looking for the organisation founded by Merlin in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Order of Merlin (abbreviated O.M.) was an award bestowed upon wizards and witches who had achieved great things for the wizarding world. It had three different award levels: First Class, Second Class, and Third Class. It was the wizarding world's equivalent to the Order of the British Empire, with first class being the equivalent to the most senior order: a knighthood.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAn organisation called the Order of Merlin was founded by Merlin in the Middle Ages.[2] Merlin believed that wizards and witches should help Muggles, and, thus, the Order of Merlin established rules against the use of magic on Muggles.[2]\n\nThe award known as the Order of Merlin was created in commemoration of Merlin and was first given out by the Wizengamot in the 15th century.[1] It is unknown whether this award was connected to the earlier organisation of the same name.\n\nAs often happened with such highly coveted awards, Ministry of Magic favourites seemed to receive the Order of Merlin, especially the higher classes, more often than one might expect. Notable unworthy recipients were Cornelius Fudge, who gave it to himself despite his less-than-distinguishable career, the fraudulent Gilderoy Lockhart, the treacherous Peter Pettigrew, and Arcturus Black, who was widely believed to have bought it by loaning the Ministry a large amount of gold.[1]\n\nMinerva McGonagall's Order of Merlin award which she kept in her office at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry became a Foundable in the Calamity which affected the wizarding world in the late 2010s/early 2020s. It was returned to her office by members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[3]\n\nAppearance and classes[]\n\nThe Order of Merlin consisted of a \"handsome\" golden medal which hung on a coloured ribbon indicating its class.[1]\n\nThere were three different classes of Order of Merlin that were awarded:\n\nFirst Class: Awarded for \"acts of outstanding bravery or distinction\" in magic. The colour of the ribbon for this class was green, which was believed to represent Merlin's Hogwarts house, Slytherin.[1]\n\nSecond Class: Awarded for \"achievement or endeavour beyond the ordinary.\" The colour of the ribbon for this class was purple.[1]\n\nThird Class: Awarded to individuals who \"have made a contribution to our store of knowledge or entertainment.\" The colour of the ribbon for this class was white.[1]\n\nKnown recipients[]\n\nOrder of Merlin, First Class[]\n\nPortrait Name Date Notes Podric Batworthy Unknown Batworthy held, additionally, the title of Grand Sorcerer, which suggests he was particularly accomplished in magic.[4] Orabella Nuttley 1754\n\n(Minister Hesphaestus Gore) Awarded for her use of the Mending Charm to repair the Colosseum after it was destroyed by an explosion that occurred when a fight broke out between supporters of two broom racers in 1754.[5] Arcturus Black (III) Between 1901 and 1991 Awarded for his \"services to the Ministry\", which, according to his grandson Sirius Black, was another way of saying that he had given them a lot of gold. Medal thrown into the rubbish when 12 Grimmauld Place was being cleaned out in August, 1995.[6] Tilly Toke and her family 1932\n\n(Minister Hector Fawley) Awarded for saving the lives of several Muggles during the Ilfracombe Incident in 1932.[7] Albus Dumbledore 1945\n\n(Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon) Awarded for his defeat of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, effectively putting an end to the Global Wizarding War. During the campaign to discredit him, it was suggested by Remus Lupin that the Ministry would consider taking away the Order of Merlin from Dumbledore. Dumbledore claimed that he didn't care as long as he wasn't taken off of the Chocolate Frog Cards.[8] However, when Dumbledore's credibility was restored, the Ministry's consideration to retract the medal was cancelled.[9] Norvel Twonk 1957\n\n(Minister Wilhelmina Tuft) Awarded posthumously for saving the life of a Muggle child from a runaway manticore.[7] Peter Pettigrew 1981\n\n(Minister Millicent Bagnold) Awarded posthumously (or so it was believed at the time) for a \"heroic confrontation\" with Sirius Black. The medal was given to Pettigrew's mother.[10] In 1994 and later, it was revealed that he had been the one who betrayed the Potter family, and that Black was just the scapegoat.[11] Cornelius Fudge Between 1990 and 1995\n\n(Minister Cornelius Fudge) Presumably for his work as Minister for Magic; awarded by Fudge to himself, which caused controversy in the wizarding community.[1] Remus Lupin 1998\n\n(Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt) Awarded posthumously for his role as a member of the Order of the Phoenix and for his death during the Battle of Hogwarts. Remus was the first werewolf ever to be accorded this honour.[12] Minerva McGonagall 1998\n\n(Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt) Awarded for her unwavering allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War, and her actions during the Battle of Hogwarts.[13]\n\nOrder of Merlin, Second Class[]\n\nPortrait Name Date Notes Newton Scamander 1979\n\n(Minister Harold Minchum) Awarded \"in recognition of his services to the study of magical beasts, Magizoology\".\n\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class[]\n\nPortrait Name Date Notes Gilderoy Lockhart Between 1982 and 1992\n\n(Minister Millicent Bagnold\n\nor\n\nMinister Cornelius Fudge) Awarded for his encounters with many dark creatures and penning his autobiographic works with instructions on how to safely repel them.[14] In 1993 and later, it was revealed that he had only taken credit for these deeds and had not really done any of them.[15]\n\nRecipients of unknown class[]\n\nPortrait Name Date Notes Cottismore Croyne Unknown May have been awarded for his tenure as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. Albert Gibbering Stump Between 1662 and 1700\n\n(Wizards' Council) For unknown reasons. Damocles Belby Sometime after the mid-1970s[16] May have been awarded for his invention of the lycanthropy-treating Wolfsbane Potion.[17]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe \"Muggle\" counterpart to the Order of Merlin could include the Order of the British Empire, Order of St Michael and St George, or the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert. Each is/was a British system of honours which was divided into various classes and could be won by a person from any rank of society.\n\nSince 1966, the International Brotherhood of Magicians has been awarding its own Order of Merlin to long-standing members.\n\nSince Albus Dumbledore was on the verge of losing his Order of Merlin during Cornelius Fudge's campaign to discredit him and Harry Potter, it means that a certain level of disgrace is capable of causing a recipient to lose the Order of Merlin.\n\nAs Fudge was heavily disgraced for his lack of actions against Lord Voldemort's return (not to mention that the worth of his award was heavily questioned to begin with), it is possible that his Order of Merlin was retracted following his sacking from office.\n\nWhen Peter Pettigrew's true actions of betrayal and frame-up of his friends and his membership in the Death Eaters were revealed, it is possible his Order of Merlin was retracted from his mother's possession.\n\nIt is possible that Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom were awarded the Order of Merlin later in their lives due to their contributions throughout the Second Wizarding War and their crucial roles in the defeat of Lord Voldemort.\n\nIt is also likely that Severus Snape was posthumously given the Order of Merlin, First or Second Class, for his role as a double agent during the Second Wizarding War.\n\nSnape was originally promised to be given such Order of Merlin by Cornelius Fudge for returning Sirius Black (assumed to be a fugitive murderer at the time) to Ministry custody, but Black escaped before Fudge could follow through on his word. It was later stated that the loss of this Order of Merlin hit Snape hard, and this allegedly was the reason that he let it slip that Remus Lupin was a werewolf.\n\nDuring the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, on 12 May 2018, a stage invader disrupted the United Kingdom performance, grabbing singer SuRie's microphone and shouting \"Nazis of the UK media, we demand freedom\", before being swiftly dragged offstage.[18] Australian commentator Joel Creasey described the stage invader as \"some absolute cockhead\" during the live broadcast; on Twitter, J. K. Rowling commended Creasey and awarded him with the Order of Merlin, First Class.[19]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (Mentioned on a Famous Wizard Card)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (First mentioned)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (Mentioned on a Famous Wizard Card)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Mentioned only)\n\nPottermore (Mentioned only)\n\nWizarding World (Mentioned only)\n\nPottermore Presents: Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter Limited Edition (Mentioned only)\n\nHarry Potter: The Character Vault (Mentioned only)\n\nWonderbook: Book of Spells (First appearance)\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite\n\nHarry Potter: Puzzles & Spells (Mentioned only)\n\nHogwarts Legacy (Mentioned only)"
