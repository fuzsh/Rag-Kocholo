        "text": "Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George\n\nThe Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George is a British order of chivalry founded on 28 April 1818 by George IV, Prince of Wales, while he was acting as prince regent for his father, King George III. It is named in honour of two military saints, Michael and George. The Order of St Michael and St George was originally awarded to those holding commands or high position in the Mediterranean territories acquired in the Napoleonic Wars, and was subsequently extended to holders of similar office or position in other territories of the British Empire. The Order’s motto is Auspicium melioris aevi (‘Token of a better age’). The banners of arms of the Knights and Dames Grand Cross are hung in the Chapel of the Order, which is in St Paul’s Cathedral. It is at present awarded to men and women who hold high office or who render extraordinary or important non-military service to the United Kingdom in a foreign country, and can also be conferred for important or loyal service in relation to foreign and Commonwealth affairs.\n\nKnight Grand Cross, Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (post-nominals: GCMG)\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Arthur William Currie GCMG KCB\n\nKnight Commander, Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (post-nominals: KCMG)\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Henry Edward Burstall KCB KCMG\n\nMajor-General Sir George Arthur French KCMG\n\nMajor-General Sir Edward Whipple Bancroft Morrison KCMG CB DSO\n\nCompanion, Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (post-nominals: CMG)\n\nBrigadier-General Wlliam Okell Holden Dodds CMG DSO VD\n\nColonel De la Cherois Thomas Irwin CMG VD\n\nMajor-General William Birchall Macaulay King CMG DSO\n\nBrigadier-General Charles Henry MacLaren CMG DSO\n\nGeneral Andrew George Latta McNaughton PC CH CB CMG DSO CD\n\nMajor-General Henri Alexandre Panet CB CMG DSO\n\nMajor-General Herbert Cyril Thacker CB CMG DSO\n\nOrder of the Companions of Honour (post-nominals: CH)\n\nGeneral The Honourable Henry Duncan Graham Crerar PC CH DSO CD\n\nGeneral Andrew George Latta McNaughton PC CH CB CMG DSO CD\n\nPhoto credit: By Auckland Museum, CC BY 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=83839019"
