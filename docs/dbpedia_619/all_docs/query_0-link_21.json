The Visitors of the Ashmolean offered all the MSS and printed books to the Bodleian in 1858, where they arrived in 1860. The Ashmole collection is in two sequences [MS.] Ashmole 1-1836, containing c. 1,100 printed books as well as MSS, and Ashmole A-H, consisting of 350 printed books. Ashmole 1549-1836 and Ashmole A-H are accessions to Ashmole's original collection from the libraries of John Aubrey (1626-97), Edward Lhuyd (1660-1709), and Martin Lister (1638-1712), and from the University chemical library founded in 1683. Most of Lister's books are in the Bodleian collection shelfmarked 'Lister' (q.v.). The printed books (almost 900 in number) fall into two main categories: (a) a collection of contemporary pamphlets, dealing in the main with English political and theological controversy, including Civil War tracts, poems, sermons, newspapers, and book catalogues, all collected by Ashmole between 1679 and 1690; (b) a library of astrology, astronomy, and kindred topics, including prognostications, ephemerides or astronomical calendars, and a set of almanacs for the years 1571-1690 which, in part duplicates, in part supplements, the more extensive collection of almanacs acquired by gift from Richard Rawlinson, extending from 1607-1747. c. 146 of Ashmole's volumes contain the signature of William Lilly (Merlinus Anglicus, 1602-81). Ashmole's books are bound, for the most part, in unornamented brown calf, bearing only Ashmole's arms in gilt.\n\nElias Ahmole on Book Owners Online\n\nR. T.

The collection was begun by Benjamin Henry Blackwell (1849-1924), and continued by his son, Sir Basil Blackwell (1889-1984), from whom it passed to his son, Julian (‘Toby’) in 1984. Julian gave the collection to the Bodleian in 2014. Its contents include three incunables; other early printed volumes, among which are a small number of Aldines; works of literature from private presses, some with fine bindings, and especially including poetry, a particular love of both Basil Blackwell and his father. The Bodleian also received more than 1,000 volumes, being file copies, including many children’s books published by B. H. Blackwell; and a large collection of volumes printed/published by the Shakespeare Head Press (which had been acquired by a company formed by Basil Blackwell in 1920, and which subsequently became a publisher’s imprint of Blackwell’s in the early 1940s).

Bliss bequeathed to the Bodleian his copy of Wood's Athenae Oxonienses, with many MS additions, but preferred that his library should be sold at auction. At the sale in 1858 the Library bought 745 volumes of the 16th-19th century, including books printed at Oxford, books printed in London in the three years preceding the Great Fire, works relating to the plague, works relating to the Quakers, works illustrative of Oxford and Oxfordshire, editions of and commentaries on the Psalms, works of royal and noble authors, works of the 16th and 17th century poets, and works illustrative of the characters of men in their various occupations. Bliss entered on the fly-leaf the source of his copy, and frequently added bibliographical notes. The miscellaneous antiquarian collections and bibliographical memoranda which Bliss left behind in the University Archives were transferred to the Bodleian in 1933.\n\nCatalogue of..the.. library formed by the late Rev Philip Bliss. .. which will be sold by auction... by Messrs S Leigh Sotheby and John Wilkinson 28 June (9 Aug) 1858.

It contains over 4,000 items, and includes over 100 MSS, and of the printed books, 140 are incunabula (including many rare or unique single sheets); 104 are STC items; 664 were printed in the 16th century and 422 in the 17th century. The collection divides into three sections: (a) c. 2,000 examples of bindings from the 12th-20th centuries, and from many countries. There is an especially strong group of blind-stamped 16th century specimens, and examples of the work of some of the finest contemporary British and French binders. Described as one of the three great English 20th century collections of bookbindings by Mr H. M. Nixon who, in his Broxbourne Library: styles and designs of bookbindings from the twelfth to the twentieth century, London, 1956, describes a representative selection of the most notable examples from each century; (b) The remarkable collection of book sale catalogues and material for book trade history used for, and listed in, G. Pollard and A. Ehrman, The distribution of books by Catalogue to 1800, Roxburghe Club, 1965. 347 items are there described, and there are c. 50 additions. They include the catalogues of printers, publishers, booksellers, auctioneers, and libraries.

[Bibliotheca Seldeniana] The second general collection in the history of the Library (after the division by the four faculties), started c. 1668 and added to up to c. 1840, and originally housed in Selden End. At first it was used for previously un-shelfmarked additions made during 1650-68, the folios being unclassified, the other sizes divided by the four faculty subdivisions (arts, jurisprudence, medicine, and theology). During the period 1789-1823, the subdivision by faculties was abandoned. From 1805-20, while BS. was used for the larger of the volumes in quarto, the shelfmark AS. (q.v.) was used for the smaller volumes in quarto. In the 1830s, there was a revival of the classified BS. sequence. The collection comprises over 16,000 volumes of the 16th-19th centuries.\n\nBuchanan, T. R. (Thomas Ryburn), 1846-1911 Fellow of All Souls and Librarian, Codrington Library. His widow allowed the Bodleian and All Souls to make their selection from his library. The collection of c. 500 printed books, ranging in date from the 15th-20th centuries, received by the Bodleian in 1941, is notable for its specimens of fine printing and its fine bindings. The bindings are chiefly Scottish and European of the 16th-19th centuries, including many plain morocco bindings bearing the arms of J. A. de Thou, and books from the Seillière collection finely bound in red morocco by modern French binders.\n\nThomas Buchanan on Wikipedia\n\nCraster, pp. 286-7.\n\nS.

Of the books selected, 556 were English, and many were literary works, including 48 books now listed as unique copies.

The Library took complete his collection of his favourite authors (notably, Sir Philip Sidney, Samuel Daniel, Charles Cotton and P. B. Shelley) and selected other books not already in the Bodleian, mainly works of English literature, including a number of volumes and pamphlets of modern literature and Buxton's own copies of books written or edited by him.\n\nC.

Bywater chose his books to illustrate the history of classical learning from Bessarion down to the immediate successors of Scaliger and Casaubon, and insisted on fine condition. The collection contains the names of the great, and many of the obscurer, European humanists of the 16th and early-17th centuries. Aristotle and his commentators are well represented. c. 50 books have MS marginalia by scholars, near 200 are autographed, and c. 50 bear the arms of De Thou on their bindings. Most of the books are pre-1650, including c. 150 incunabula (31 of them Greek), and over 1,100 books (459 of them Greek) were printed in the first half of the 16th century, a third of these by Paris presses. In addition the Library acquired some 64 volumes of MS material, including Bywater's correspondence with eminent European scholars.\n\nIngram Bywater on Wikipedia\n\nCraster, pp. 281-2.\n\n'The Bywater Collection', BQR 1 (1915), 80-1.\n\nW.

It consists of 205 bound volumes containing 1,031 items, all produced by and for members of the Catholic Apostolic Church. A breakaway sect from the Scottish Presbyterian Church, the Catholic Apostolic Church was founded in the mid-19th century and the last surviving member was still alive in 2002. The collection contains mainly pamphlets, sermons, and liturgies. It is a significant collection of Catholic Apostolic Church materials that contains many rare items not available in any other institution. It is an essential complement to the already electronically catalogued Catholic Apostolic Church Collection that was donated to the University of Birmingham Library by Hywel Berwyn Evans in 1989 and to the Plato E. Shaw Collection bequeathed to New College Library, University of Edinburgh, by Professor Plato E. Shaw in 1947.\n\nCheney Printers’ Archive. Cheney & Sons began printing in Banbury, Oxfordshire in 1767, and continued in business until 2001. The firm did print some books under their own imprint, but most of their work as jobbing printers. The significance of the collection lies in what it reveals about the breadth and depth of the work of a good provincial printer working near Oxford, and how this developed over time. Much of the archive consists of samples or file-copies of their output (from the 1840s through to the 1950s). There are also chapbooks and specimen books of jobbing printing from the 1840s and 1850s, and 1880 to 1920; and 45 broadsides. A further 9 broadsides and other miscellaneous printed items have been added subsequently.\n\nC. R. Cheney, ‘Early Banbury chap-books and broadsides’, The Library, 4th ser. 17/1 (1936), 98–108.\n\nC.

The Crynes collection has a wide range of historical material which supplemented the Bodleian collections in a significant way: Crynes, in addition to much rare English work, collected particularly those 16th century octavo European editions which had been overlooked in favour of the larger folio volumes preferred by Bodley himself. The rest of his books went to St John's College, and some to Balliol College. In Library Records c. 1382 (‘Disposal of Duplicates 1727–1890), fols 1–4, is a list of Bodleian duplicates sold to Crynes in 1726/7, for which he paid £3. 15. 0.\n\nNathaniel Crynes on Wikipedia\n\nMacray, p. 220.\n\nPhilip, p. 84.\n\nCundall Collection A collection of over 100 books published by Joseph Cundall (1818–1895), the writer, photographer, and publisher; presented by Miss Diana Cundall, the publisher’s great grand-daughter, and complementing copies of works by Joseph Cundall in the library’s legal deposit material, and in the Opie collection of children’s books. Cundall focused particularly on illustration, especially but not exclusively, of children’s books, and the collection contains many books from his early output in the 1840s. Cundall was also interested in photography, reflected in a number of books within the collection. The collection also contains an iconic item of ephemera, a proof copy of the first commercially produced and printed Christmas card (1843).

R. A. (Anthony) Hobson, the distinguished scholar of bookbindings, especially of the Renaissance period; the collection was received by the Bodleian in 2015. This archive of working papers (at least 80 autograph notebooks, 50 boxes and file-folders of scholarly correspondence), and the accompanying ‘reference library’ of works on the history and study of bookbinding, binding decoration, gold tooling, binders and bookbinding patrons was formed by G. D. (Geoffrey Dudley) Hobson (1882–1949), himself an expert in the history of bookbinding, and part-owner of Sotheby’s, and was continued by his son A. R. A. (Anthony Robert Alwyn) Hobson until his death in 2014. Included are Anthony Hobson’s own papers on the history of bookbinding, consisting of notes, scholarly correspondence, photographs and binding rubbings, often heavily-annotated, cross-referenced, and extra-illustrated volumes (with clippings from other publications relating to the text in the books, as well as handwritten notes; in particular, there are a number of extra-illustrated and annotated Sotheby’s catalogues for particular sales handled by the company); and, in addition, there is similar material which had belonged to his father. The ‘reference library’ brings together standard reference works, and places them alongside ephemeral pieces almost impossible to locate easily elsewhere. A. R. A. Hobson’s work marked a new approach to the history of bookbinding, by integrating the detailed study and identification of binders and workshops with the wider study of artistic patronage and humanistic interest, particularly during the Renaissance, and this approach is reflected in the contents of the collection.

Gillam, [The Edgar Wallace collection], BLR, XV, 3 (October 1995) 214-5.\n\nHolkham Collection Purchased in 1953 from the family library of the Earl of Leicester at Holkham Hall, Norfolk, the Bodleian's Holkham collection consists of more than 800 works, broadly representative of the Holkham Library as a whole, including an element of the law library of the early generations of the family, books belonging to Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634), English literature and plays gathered by the 18th century members of the family, classical and other incunabula, and English and Italian literature collected by Thomas William Coke, first Earl of Leicester (1752-1842). It divides into four main categories: 35 incunabula, many very rare, including editions of the Classics; 33 books printed in the United Kingdom up to 1640 (STC), including 5 in Italian and 3 English Bibles; 30 uniformly bound volumes in quarto, the collection of English Restoration plays put together by Edward Coke and his wife, Cary, the parents of the First Earl, consisting of 317 items, 305 of them plays, all but 15 of them printed between 1663 and 1700, the rest not later than 1705; c. 500 Italian works, printed pre-1601, in the main from two sources: (i) more than 150 from the library of Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634), and of these two-thirds are books owned by Sir Christopher Hatton (1540-91), and (ii) the more numerous books bought by the Third Earl. The Italian portion of the collection contains few imprints pre-1525, and few exceptional rarities. It is broadly representative of the Italian books being printed throughout the major portion of that country, when Italy's cultural pre-eminence was still unrivalled, and includes works, original or translated in the fields of theology, philosophy, law, politics, history, travel, biography, antiquities, medicine, agriculture, music, painting, and architecture, as well as poetry, drama, letters, dialogues, and literary criticism. Bindings on the Holkham collection books are representative of the library and its various owners, e.g. Elizabethan bindings are richly represented among the Hatton books, the splendour of 18th century bindings is shown on the First Earl's books.\n\nSir Edward Coke (1552-1634) on Book Owners Online\n\nCary Coke (1680/1-1707) on Book Owners Online\n\nEdward Coke (1676/8-1707) on Book Owners Online\n\nD.

A collection of perhaps a million items in total, mainly of printed ephemera, or non-book printed materials, but including books and pamphlets, chiefly English, formed by John Johnson at the University Press, where it was known as the Constance Meade Collection, and transferred to the Bodleian Library in 1968, where it is known as the John Johnson Collection. Johnson made 1939 the terminus ad quem of the collection. He restricted his collecting of post-1939 material, but he continued to collect current material in some areas until his death in 1955, and later material has been added since the collection came to the Bodleian. The material now ranges from 1508 to the present day.\n\nConstance Meade, the great-granddaughter of Bishop Percy of Dromore, donated to Johnson's collection in 1930 the printed ephemera which had passed into the Meade family with the residue of Bishop Percy's books and papers. During the period when the Bodleian's attitude to ephemera was antipathetic, Strickland Gibson steered material eliminated from the library into Johnson's collection (including almanacs, booksellers' and publishers' lists, and books for young children). Johnson also acquired material originally collected by W. D. Macray (1826-1916), Robert Proctor (1868-1903), and E. W. B. Nicholson (1849-1912). Other specialized sections of the collections include: the Edward Heron-Allen (1861-1943) collection of watchpapers; the E. Maude Hayter collection of valentines and Christmas cards, in addition to Andrew White Tuer's collection; the Sir John Evans (1823-1908) collection of banknotes and paper money; the M. L. Horn (1889-1953) collection of cigarette cards; the F. A. Bellamy and H. F. N. Jourdain collection of postage stamps, postal stationery and material relating to the Post Office. The printed books in the collection are estimated to number over 10,000 volumes, including almanacs, auction catalogues, novels, periodicals, plays, and sermons, dating from the 17th-20th centuries, popular and ephemeral volumes, many not received by legal deposit.\n\nA collection of writing masters copy books (shelfmarked Johnson penmen 1-386), both English and foreign (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the US being the other countries represented), dating from the 16th-20th cent, was built up for Johnson by Graham Pollard. The ephemera collection also includes single sheets by, or relating to, writing masters, chiefly English of the 18th cent, and a small collection of engraved writing blanks, English of the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nGuard books contain c. 440 book prospectuses covering the period c. 1680-1800; 17th and 18th century single sheet proclamations; and single sheet items of the periods covered by STC and Wing.\n\nThe collection of ephemera is largely arranged by subject, in some cases by form of material, and the following are some of the sections: material on the history of book production and the book trade, including 18th century catalogues of the sales of copies or shares in copies, i.e. booksellers trade sale catalogues, thought to have been those belonging to the firm of Rivington; booksale and booksellers' catalogues; catalogues and labels of circulating and subscription libraries of the 18th and 19th centuries; bookplates (one of the largest institutional collections); material relating to private presses, including the Chiswick Press; early news-books and newspapers; prospectuses; playbills and programmes for popular entertainments; broadsides, including ballads; passports; chapbooks and songbooks; Oxford material, including Oxford University societies; Christmas cards; material on authors such as Dickens; on elections; taxation; religion; education; the armed forces; trade and finance; agriculture; food and drink; dress; transport; games and pastimes; sport, etc.\n\nA typed subject guide to the collection is available, together with a printed list of main subject headings (some 700 in number).

The greater part of the collection belonged to Józef Tukaszewicz (1797-1873), classicist, historian, author of books on the history of education and pedagogy and the history of the Church in Poland, particularly the Reformation, teacher of the Polish language, etc. The collection consists of books about Poland written by Polish and foreign authors, depicting a short period of Polish cultural history in relation to the Church and the Reformation, with an emphasis on the development of education, pedagogics and trends in Polish teaching. It contains examples of almost all notable 16th century printers, and also Polish books printed abroad. There are in total 252 16th century titles, 1231 17th and 18th century titles, and 309 19th century titles up to 1840. Most of the books are in Polish, Latin, French and German, a few in Czech. 200 vols. were incorporated into the collection in 1883 which did not belong to Tukaszewicz. The main categories of books are: Polish history; Polish law; political journalism; history of the Church in Poland, a large part of the collection, including Catholic and non-Catholic translations of the Bible and the New Testament, Psalters, lives of the saints, sermons, ecclesiastical regulations, and theological studies and polemics, particularly of the Reformation period; history of education and pedagogics in Poland; and Polish language and literature (belles-lettres).\n\nZ.

Barlow bequeathed 54 mss and those books in his library not already in the Bodleian (others went to The Queen’s College). The quartos and octavos are particularly rich in tracts and pamphlets of the reign of Charles I and of the Civil Wars and Interregnum and in early theology. These tracts for the times (political, theological, philosophical) were often anonymous, and many of their authors have been identified on Barlow’s testimony. The folio volumes from Barlow’s library, not numerous, are dispersed amongst other folio volumes. Some later volumes, not Barlow’s, have been added to Linc., particularly during the 18th cent making a total of c6,000 v.\n\nThomas Barlow on Wikipedia\n\nThomas Barlow on Book Owners Online\n\nMacray, p157-9.\n\nPhilip, p44-8.\n\nRogers, p154-5.\n\nWilliam Poole, ‘Barlow’s books: prolegomena for the study of the library of Thomas Barlow (1608/9–1691), BLR 29/1 (2016), 13–46.\n\nLincoln, Christ’s Hospital School A collection of early printed books on varied subjects from Lincoln Christ’s Hospital School, presented to the library in 2019 by The Foundation of Christ's Hospital at Lincoln.

The collection is rich in 16th-century blind-tooled bindings, with examples by Spierinck, Godfrey, and the Heavy Binder. A central core of the 16th- and 17th-century books was owned by John Smith, thought to be the doctor of this name practising in London between about 1591 and 1620, and nephew of the school’s founder, Richard Smith.

On his death he left all his MSS and his interleaved books, and one 'Moiety' of the rest of his books to his cousin Peter King, later Lord King (1669-1734). The papers and correspondence remained in the possession of Lord King's descendants, who later became the Earls of Lovelace, until 1947, when most were bought by the Bodleian. In 1951 the remainder of the King moiety of Locke's library was discovered at Ben Damph Forest, a seat of the Earl of Lovelace, and were later bought by Mr Paul Mellon (1907-1999) (together with the manuscripts which the Earl of Lovelace had retained). Mr Mellon presented them to the Bodleian, transferring them there in 1978 along with a number of other books from Locke's library which he had in the meantime bought. The Bodleian now holds in its Locke Room, in addition to the MSS purchased in 1947 and MSS given by Mr Mellon, all the books with the location 'Oak Spring' in Harrison and Laslett's The Library of John Locke and other printed volumes from Locke's library, a total of over 800 printed volumes. Volumes from other Bodleian collections known to have belonged to Locke, and some which belonged to the other 'moiety' of Locke's library (left to Frances Cudworth Masham and subsequently dispersed) have been integrated with Mr Mellon's gift.\n\nJohn Locke on Wikipedia\n\nJohn Locke on Book Owners Online\n\nP.

The collection is chiefly of Elizabethan, Jacobean, and Caroline literature, particularly drama, but it also contains some Restoration drama and works by Dryden. Malone's collection of the early editions of Shakespeare's plays and poems in seven quarto volumes (Malone 32-8, kept as Arch. G. d.39-45) represented in Malone's time the most complete collection of early editions ever made. Included in the Malone collection are almost 1,000 printed plays given him by George Steevens (1736-1800) and augmented by Malone in two series: (i) Malone 39-128, containing late-17th and early-18th century editions, (ii) Malone 158-234, most of which are Caroline, though a few are Elizabethan and others are dated after 1660: Shakespeare is largely absent. Included also is Malone's own copy of his Shakespeare of 1790 (Malone 1046-57), heavily annotated for the second edition he did not live to publish.

The printed books include contemporary Protestant theology (English and Continental), and works on Anglo-Saxon and Middle Eastern languages, reflecting his exile in the Netherlands during the Commonwealth, and an interest in linguistics and philology. There are now c. 900 printed volumes in the collection, many of these being additions to the Marshall bequest. The wide variety of his linguistic interests is shown by the presence of languages such as Frisian, Irish and Romanian, which were certainly rare at that period in the libraries of Englishmen.

From 1810 to 1861 purchases were made in medicine and natural history. In 1861 the scientific books from the Radcliffe Library were transferred to the new University Museum building, and in 1902 a new building was provided next to the Museum. In 1861 the Bodleian Curators were empowered to deposit certain scientific books and periodicals in the Radcliffe Library. The Trustees in 1893 handed over to the Bodleian those books on non-scientific subjects which the Bodleian cared to take (see below, ‘Radcl.’), and sold non-scientific works not wanted by the Bodleian.
