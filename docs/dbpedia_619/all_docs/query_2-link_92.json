        "text": "How to use our war DEAD search tool\n\nOur search tool will allow you to interrogate our database to find the various war casualty records we maintain. There are a range of different fields that will allow you to create the right search terms for you. For a more detailed search, you can add further fields by using the Additional Fields. You do not have to use every field in our search tool.\n\nAll of our results are sorted by Relevance. This means that we will attempt to give you the most relevant casualty at the top of the list, with further results listed down the page. The fields that allow you to enter text manually have an option called ‘Match this search term exactly’.\n\nThis allows you a level of flexibility in the search terms. For example, if you searched for First name: Clive, Last name: Smith, you’d get Clive Smith at the top of the list, with other Clives and Smiths in order of relevance down the list.\n\nIf you use Match Term Exactly on the same search, you would only get the result for Clive Smith.\n\nYou do not have to search purely by name, you could, for example, run a search for all casualties listed in a particular cemetery or war memorial, or all that served for a particular regiment.\n\nFIND WAR GRAVES IN ENGLAND\n\nUse the Served With (Country) drop-down menu to search for war dead by the country they served in.\n\nFIND WAR DEAD IN EUROPE\n\nYou can also search by Country Commemorated In to find records that relate to a particular county.\n\nFIND WAR DEAD RECORDS WORLDWIDE\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission records cover countries across the globe.\n\nFIND A GRAVE WW1\n\nIf you are looking for records of war dead from the Great War, select First World War at the bottom of the search box.\n\nFIND A GRAVE WW2\n\nFor Second World War Dead records, tick the Second World War box.\n\nYou can search by name, Service Number, which regiment of the armed forces they served in and by country.\n\nCIVILIAN WAR DEAD REGISTER\n\nYou can also search for records including Civilian War Dead 1939-1945 under the Served In drop-down menu.\n\nTELLING THE STORIES OF THE WAR DEAD\n\nOur work aims to commemorate the men and women of the Commonwealth who lost their lives during the World Wars.\n\nPart of this is telling their stories to ensure they are not forgotten. We do this through the CWGC Archive, our projects, our latest news and search tools.\n\nAdvances in digital technology offer new ways to connect the next generation with the work of the CWGC and the individuals we commemorate. Find out how we use tech to tell the stories of the war dead."
