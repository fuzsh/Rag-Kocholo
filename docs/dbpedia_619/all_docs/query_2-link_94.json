        "text": "This is third part of an article which Mr Phillip Campbell, author of the blog Unam Sanctam Catholicam, has very kindly shared with us, his investigation into what the “progressive” theological journal Concilium was saying about reform of the sacrament of Confession in the years which immediately followed the most recent ecumenical council. The first part was published in February, and the second in March. Once again, we are very grateful to him for sharing his work with us.\n\nA confessional in the cathedral of St Stephen in Toulouse, France. Image from Wikimedia Commons by Didier Descouens, CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\nIn our previous installments in this series on the journal Concilium’s 1971 attack on Confession, we have documented the progressives’ attempts to frame the traditional administration of the sacrament as in a state of crisis (Part 1), and their subsequent call for a redefinition of guilt as a social construct (Part 2). Today we continue with a study of their attempt to recontextualize the nature of reconciliation in order to undermine the foundation of private penance.\n\nChristian Duquoc’s “Repugnance” to the Sacrament of Penance\n\nWe have already had occasion to mention the French Dominican Christian Duquoc (1926-2008) in our previous essays. He was a prominent voice in French progressive circles, with over forty-five titles to his credit from 1942 to 2006; his writings appeared in French, English and Spanish language journals.\n\nFr Duquoc wearing the updated habit of a Dominican Doctor of Theology.\n\nIn the pages of Concilium he stands out as the most vitriolic critic of the traditional sacramental forms, sometimes devolving into downright scorn. In the 1971 issue titled “Sacramental Reconciliation,” he published a scathing criticism of traditional forms of confession, which he castigated as “useless” and “meaningless.” [1] Entitled “Real Reconciliation and Sacramental Reconciliation,” Duquoc’s piece argued that sacramental reconciliation—as experienced by most Catholic penitents in 1971—was insufficiently authentic. He called for a radical reconsideration of the meaning of reconciliation, grounding it not so much in the cleansing of one’s conscience through reconciliation with God, but in communitarian reconciliation grounded in socio-political struggle. As we shall see, Duquoc will ultimately call for sweeping changes to the form of the rite in order to reflect these new priorities.\n\nLike the other Concilium authors, he begins his essay by pointing to a crisis in the sacrament of confession. He frames the situation thus:\n\nYet reconciliation is an object of suspicion owing to the forms it assumes in the Catholic Church, and notably owing to the celebration of penance… The sacrament of penance, as it is practiced today in the Catholic Church, gives rise to many reservations. There are fervent Christians, including priests and religious, who are unable to overcome their repugnance to its method of administration. There are many facile explanations of their allergy: the loss of a sense of sin, forgetfulness of God, distaste for prayer. But these explanations are unfortunately of too universal a kind to throw light upon this particular phenomenon—for they would apply just as much to lukewarm believers who nevertheless experience no distaste for the existing forms of the sacrament of penance and often have recourse to them. It is precisely where Christianity is taken most seriously that repugnance to the sacrament of penance is most apparent. [2]\n\nAs we have repeatedly seen with other progressives, Duquoc takes the crisis of confession as axiomatic; it is assumed, never justified with data. The traditional form of confession is the object of “suspicion” and “repugnance”; it elicits an “allergy” from “fervent Christians.” Duquoc offhandedly dismisses any possibility that this is related to modernity’s eclipse of the sense of God, as spoken of by John Paul II. [3] Instead, he invokes a No True Scotsman fallacy to argue that the problem is the ritual itself, which is said to be universally disdained “precisely where Christianity is taken most seriously.”\n\nPenance: A Superfluous Obstacle\n\nDuquoc argues that the traditional manner of confession is either superfluous or an obstacle to Christian growth.\n\nIn the first place, he claims the rite’s redundancy by an appeal to the Eucharist, the ultimate sacrament of reconciliation. For the Eucharist, “through the sharing of bread, symbolizes not only the reconciliation to come, but offers thanksgiving for reconciliation already received.” [4] And if the Eucharist both effects and foreshadows man’s ultimate reconciliation, then is not the sacrament of penance, in the words of Duquoc, “superfluous, if reconciliation is already achieved”? [5]\n\nHe also argues that penance is an obstacle to Christian growth because it is ineffective. Like other critics of the sacrament, Duquoc views penance as a form of dry ritualism that does not offer men the transformative power that authentic reconciliation should make available. At best, it is a mechanical “process of guilt-shedding… without accession to responsibility”; at worst it engenders an “unhealthy and inward-looking return to the past” that he characterizes as reflecting a “neurotic character”, especially when it comes to sexual sins. [6] For this reason, Duqouc says penance has a “fictive nature,” an empty formalism that yields no meaningful outcomes for those who frequent it. [7]\n\nFor now we shall pass over his first objection that the Eucharist makes penance superfluous — although it should be noted that this argument frequently shows up in progressive literature on the subject. [8] Duquoc’s second point deserves further consideration, for, we might ask, how can he possibly argue that penance is an obstacle to Christian growth? Many Catholics have the experience of going to confession for the same sin repeatedly, but we do not find this formulaic; rather, we find in it an expression of the boundless mercy of Christ. Is not “guilt-shedding” one of the reasons why we frequent the sacrament, so that our conscience may be purified through absolution of sin? Pope Pius XII encourage the frequent confession of even venial sins:\n\nAs you well know, Venerable Brethren, it is true that venial sins may be expiated in many ways which are to be highly commended. But to ensure more rapid progress day by day in the path of virtue, for a constant and speedy advancement in the path of virtue, we highly recommend the pious practice of frequent confession, introduced by the church under the guidance of the Holy Spirit; for by this means we grow in a true knowledge of ourselves and in Christian humility, bad habits are uprooted, spiritual negligence and apathy are prevented, the conscience is purified and the will strengthened, salutary spiritual direction is obtained, and grace is increased by the efficacy of the sacrament itself. Let those, therefore, among the younger clergy who make light of or lessen esteem for frequent confession realize that what they are doing is alien to the Spirit of Christ and disastrous for the Mystical Body of our Savior. [9]\n\nDuquoc’s view is diametrically opposed to the sensibility expressed by Pius XII, for he absolutely repudiates the notion that confession is about personal reconciliation with God through private confession of fault and purification of conscience. What, then, is confession ultimately about?\n\n“Historical Reconciliation”; i.e., Marxism\n\nFor Duquoc, reconciliation is about what he terms historical reconciliation; that is, not a private reconciliation with God through confession of faults, but a social reconciliation with our fellow men through rectifying historic injustices. He writes:\n\nThe current emphasis in Christianity on the dynamic and future character of reconciliation [i.e., concern for the Last Judgment] robs forgiveness of its historicism, reduces it to a private dimension, in short, devalues it. Struggle, as the active and committed form of reconciliation, has pride of place. Forgiveness, seen as obsessed with the past, is an obstacle to the freedom required for political struggle. The shift in emphasis in reconciliation makes the sacrament of penance meaningless; the social import of forgiveness is underestimated. [10]\n\nDuquoc’s argument against penance therefore is analogous to Marx’s critique of Christianity as a whole: by compelling men to think about eschatological rewards or punishments, it distracts them from political struggle against injustice here and now. Some further quotations should demonstrate how seriously he stresses this point:\n\nHere and now we are immersed in the class-war and injustice. Brotherhood, transparency, peace are no more than hopes; whenever they have a germ of reality, the reality is regional… Today, in the Churches, small spontaneous groups, deeply committed and politically like-minded, are fighting for a Church to their image, purified of hierarchical and anonymous relations, a place of free expression. These communities are revolutionary in aims and status… believers most sensitive to collective phenomenon and social injustices are also the most hostile to the existing forms of penance. Militant Christians engaged in trade-unions or political activities, or involved in the class-war, are the first to be infected by the allergy to sacramentality as it exists in the Church today. There is no question at all of indifference to God or to the Gospel of Christ, but in their daily fight for the setting up of a less inhuman society, and in their political projects, the sacrament of reconciliation strikes them as either meaningless or ineffectual. A serious attitude to reconciliation as something to be effected here and now empties of its meaning reconciliation symbolized in the sacramental act. [11]\n\nGiven his idealization of “militant Christians” forming “communities revolutionary in aims” focused on “political projects” and social justice “to be effected here and now” — and his condemnation of any celebration of penance which distracts from this — it does not seem an exaggeration to label Duquoc’s analysis as positively Marxist.\n\nWe can summarize Duquoc’s view as follows: for reconciliation to have meaning, it must be present-oriented, focused on correcting injustices here and now. The traditional method, however, is the opposite of this; traditionally, we are contrite for actions committed in the past and confess in hopes of attaining heaven in the future. For Duquoc, traditional confession seems a Janus-headed monster that focuses attention everywhere but where it ought to be pointed: historical reconciliation in the present.\n\nThe Reform of the Rite\n\nGiven these ideas, how can the rite of penance be reformed to reflect his proposed emphases?\n\nDuquoc begins his analysis of the rite by affirming that any ritual, to be effective, must adequately convey its supporting theology through the symbolic actions of the rite itself, for “we cannot take refuge in appeasing theological meaning so long as this meaning does not become apparent in the rite.” [12] Contemporary traditionalist readers will find this ironic, as the entire drama of the post-Conciliar reform is specifically that the reformed rites do not reflect the Church’s traditional theology. Duquoc, of course sees the problem in reverse: it is the traditional rite doesn’t reflect his new theology. “Current uneasiness regarding the sacrament of penance,” he says, “derives from the dichotomy between the manner of celebration and the meaning of sacramental reconciliation.” [13] In other words, there is a disconnect between the lex orandi and the lex credendi. But unlike traditionalists — who would argue that the lex orandi should be brought into conformity with the lex credendi — Duquoc will simply argue that the traditional lex credendi is wrong. Regarding traditional forms of confession, he says:\n\nThe existing form, inherited from Irish missionary monasticism, robs sacramental penance of its social character and implies that forgiveness and reconciliation belong to an inner conscience. Moreover, it encourages the sentiment already too prevalent in our society that religion is a private affair. So the form of a sacrament does influence its meaning; and as things are now it obscures its true significance. The reform of rites is thus not an undertaking of secondary importance — it is the very condition of understanding what Christianity is about. [14]\n\nThis is a slippery series of propositions. Historically, the claim that the traditional rite of penance was created by Irish monastics is an exaggeration. The contributions of the Irish were more particular; at most we can credit them with the system of specialized penances for specific sins as evidenced in the famous Irish penitentials, as well as the custom of bringing even sinful thoughts to sacramental confession. [15] But to claim the entire rite was their creation is inaccurate, though it is often repeated in an attempt to push the creation of the traditional practice much later into the Middle Ages that it might be shorn of its antiquity. (Incidentally, even if the traditional rite was entirely a creation of the Irish monastics, I’d much rather follow the precedent of an emaciated, wild-eyed 7th century Celtic hermit living on a rock than entrust my spiritual formation to a Concilium author from the 1970s).\n\nRegarding Duquoc’s second claim, that the traditional rite is in danger of making penance a private affair, we have to ask: a private affair in contrast to what? Because it is certainly true that, strictly speaking, there is no “private” sin. Every sin at least involves a broken relationship with God; “Against you and you alone have I sinned, O God,” says the Psalmist (Ps. 50, 6). In addition, every sin wounds the Body of Christ collectively, even in ways that aren’t immediately apparent. And there can certainly be “structures of sin,” as the Catechism says [16], institutionalized expressions of personal sin which perpetuate cycles of evil. But is this what Duquoc means?\n\nNo. Duquoc is contrasting confession as a “private affair” with his view of historical reconciliation — that is, reconciliation as a tool of socio-economic justice:\n\nThe purpose [of reforming the sacrament] is clear; it is provided by the necessary link between forgiveness and reconciliation at the level of true history. The sacramental symbol should make clear that forgiveness is a social function necessary to our history as it makes its way toward reconciliation. [17]\n\nThere we have it. The sacrament of penance to be transformed into “a social function” necessary to bring about socio-economic justice in our current day.\n\nDuquoc’s Recommendations for a New Rite\n\nDuquoc concludes his essay with a blistering criticism of the traditional form, which he decries as being too focused on personal sin. He phrases his criticism as a series of hypotheticals, presumably to maintain plausible deniability that he is actually asserting such things, but his disdain rises to the surface easily enough:\n\nDoes this private form of penance represent a concession to a mediocre form of Christian life? Is it a sacred therapy to appease consciences that are incapable of making their own the evangelical demands? Or does it illustrate an obsession with legalism in our relations with God? Is the institution of confession for faults that do not stop the forward-march of the community ascribable to an unhealthy desire for purity? It is difficult to answer these questions. [18]\n\nBut for those who have been reading attentively, Duquoc has already answered all of these questions in the affirmative. He goes on to complain that the traditional rite “tends to remain silent on political and economic matters” and suggests a reform of penance should adopt an aggressively communitarian perspective. [19] He does not give any concrete rubrical recommendations, but we may presume he envisions something akin to what his fellow Concilium author Franz Heggen proposed in his 1971 fabricated ritual for First Confessions, which was specifically designed to reflect a more communitarian emphasis. [20] Duquoc does argue, however, that whatever new form is adopted, it should encapsulate a symbolic repudiation of the theology underlying the traditional form. His conclusion merits being quoted at length:\n\nThe reconciliation celebrated in the sacrament of penance [i.e., the traditional form] is first and foremost reconciliation with oneself, which becomes the sign of reconciliation with God—this is a far cry indeed from the symbol advocated by the early Church, reconciliation with one’s brother as the sign of reconciliation with God. The form of the administration of the sacrament is not harmless; it favors one aspect of reconciliation. The private form favors reconciliation with oneself in the interior of one’s conscience, sole seat of authentic relationship with God. Other human realities, and notably economic and political relationships, escape all interference from Christianity …\n\n… This situation invites us to a great creative effort in the liturgical domain — otherwise the seeming discrepancy between our history and the symbolic celebration of reconciliation will grow; sacramental reconciliation will be seen as factitious, and be abandoned, or it will appear politically as a structure upholding the status quo. Hence the urgency of discovering new forms of celebration … The rites passed on by our history were imposed on it without sufficient attention being paid to local forms of possible signs of reconciliation. Certainly efforts are being made today to extricate Christian sacramentality from the situation in which it finds itself. Up till now these efforts have not amounted to much — they have combined a public penitential liturgy with private confession [i.e., the penance services of the Novus Ordo]. The gap between reconciliation with oneself and reconciliation with mankind, sign of reconciliation with God, is far from being overcome at the level of symbol. Confession still seems too bound up with an abstract law.\n\nYet I do not think we need despair. The current criticism of the insignificance of the sacrament of reconciliation spurs us on to new discoveries. The Church cannot for long do without an effective symbolization of the social, historical and collective function of forgiveness. [21]\n\nWhat could go wrong? (Victims of a struggle session in occupied Tibet during the Chinese cultural revolution. Public domain image from Wikimedia Commons.)\n\nConclusion: A Wrongness So Big\n\nThe first time I read Duquoc’s essay, I was overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of his errors: a web of bad theological premises and faulty history, tied up with a bow of historical determinism with some logical fallacies sprinkled on top. Its wrongness was so big it was difficult to zero in on where, specifically, his wrongness lay. But upon further readings, I think I can pinpoint a few things that merit special critique:\n\nFirst, Duquoc is simply incorrect about his history. While the sacrament of penance did undergo development over the centuries — and while it is true that penance in the early Church included more communitarian elements — it is simply wrong to posit a dichotomy between some primitive public penance focused on communal reconciliation and private confession focused on reconciliation with God. Both elements have always been present in the Church’s practice. It has always been understood that a sin against our brother damages our communion with God and that we must be reconciled with our neighbor; likewise, it has always been acknowledged that clearing our conscience of all known sins is an integral part of reconciliation with God. St. Paul said he strove to “live in good conscience before God” and affirmed “I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward God and toward men” (Acts 23,1, 24, 16).\n\nFurthermore, contrary to Duquoc’s assertions, private confession was certainly practiced in the early Church. There are many testimonies to its existence, but a particularly poignant text comes from Pope St. Leo the Great, who, in a letter to the bishops of Campania in the year 459, said the following:\n\nI have recently heard that some have unlawfully presumed to act contrary to a rule of Apostolic origin. And I hereby decree that the unlawful practice be completely stopped. It is with regard to the reception of penance. An abuse has crept in which requires that the faithful write out their individual sins in a little book which is then to be read out loud to the public.\n\nAll that is necessary, however, is for the sinner to manifest his conscience in a secret confession to the priests alone... It is sufficient, therefore, to have first offered one’s confession to God, and then also to the priest, who acts as an intercessor for the transgressions of the penitents. [22]\n\nLike many post-Conciliar reformers, Duquoc is simping for a fantastical antiquarian history that never existed.\n\nDuquoc’s Marxist analysis of the needs of the modern Church should be self-refuting in light of five decades of the abject failure of this hermeneutic. While Christians should certainly never turn a blind eye to social injustices or “structures of sin”, as the Catechism calls them, there is no reason such social issues cannot be addressed within the traditional forms. It is mystifying that Duquoc thinks the Church of his day had been silent on economic and political matters; one wonders if he had ever read the writings of Leo XIII or Pius XI—or, for that matter, texts like Paul VI’s Populorum Progressio, published four years before he authored his essay. If Populorum Progressio was “silent on political and economic matters,” then one wonders what constitutes “political and economic matters” for Duquoc.\n\nWe should also note how brazenly he affirms that the post-Conciliar Church is operating under a fundamentally new theology. He does not say this explicitly, but it is at the heart of his argument for sacramental reform: the rite should symbolically express the theology it is meant to encapsulate. But the old rite of the Church does not express Duquoc’s new theology. Therefore, the rite must change: the evolving lex credendi must be reflected in a reformed lex orandi. We see therefore in Duquoc’s argument the underlying assumption of so many reformers that was recently made plain by Cardinal Roche — “the theology of the Church has changed.” [23]\n\nFinally, Duquoc argued that the Eucharist, as the source of reconciliation, gave the sacrament of penance a kind of redundancy; if the Eucharist both effects and signifies our reconciliation with God and man, what is the point of sacramental confession apart from the Eucharistic liturgy? We will take up this point in our next installment when we consider the work of Jean-Marie Tillard, O.P., a peer of Duquoc who argued that the general absolution at the Mass could replace the sacrament of penance.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Christian Duquoc, “Real Reconciliation and Sacramental Reconciliation,” Concilium: Sacramental Reconciliation, Vol. 61, ed.

Available online at https://onepeterfive.com/cardinal-roche-vatican-ii-rupture/\n\nWe live in an age in which the West is under attack. This attack is on the West’s foundational values, which are Christian, and on the Faith itself. At the heart of a Christian society lies the triad of family, nation, and Church—institutions that form the bedrock of societal cohesion, and guide individuals towards a path of spiritual fulfillment through the life of Faith.\n\nThere has been some focus, amongst Christians at least, on how we can reinvigorate the Church and the family through evangelization. However, the value of the nation as an entity and the importance of the identification of Western nations as Christian are subjects that many shy away from. In the post-war liberal consensus, these have been unfashionable topics, to say the least. I think that we are now beginning to recognise that we are paying the price for this mistake, and unless we can once again assert the Christian identity of Western nations, and especially the United States and England - two countries I care deeply about - we will always struggle to save the West. As a Christian, I know that the Faith will prevail, but if the United States especially does not survive as a Christian nation, we may have to go back to new dark ages and start to rebuild from the ashes!\n\nCredit: Tim Buss from North County, San Diego, California, USA, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nCivic art, particularly public statues and monuments, plays a vital role in shaping and preserving a nation’s cultural identity and values. Within the context of a Christian nation, these artistic expressions serve as tangible reminders of the foundational principles upon which the society is built and the ideals it strives to uphold. Public statues and monuments are important to society. They honor and celebrate the heroes and figures, including those who were not known for the Christian faith, who have nevertheless embodied these values and contributed to the nation’s growth and development.\n\nGeorge Washington Sculpture, 1857, Baltimore, Maryland. Credit: Baltimore Heritage CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe choice of artistic style for these public works is a critical consideration. Classical realism flourished in civic art in the West during the 18th and 19th centuries, and emerged as a particularly apt choice for a Christian nation. While some reservations may exist regarding its use in sacred art (I would argue for a more idealised form in church), the classical realist style finds its special purpose in the public square, where it can effectively convey the nation’s character and aspirations. It is a style closely connected to the classical forms of ancient Roman statues, and was developed to communicate a sense of nobility and authority in the person, thereby engendering respect for them and, more importantly, the values they embody.\n\nStatues of religious, political, and cultural icons and individuals who have achieved remarkable feats in science and the arts serve as enduring symbols of the nation’s values and accomplishments. Their presence in public spaces pays tribute to these figures and inspires future generations. This is not to gloss over their faults and frailties, for no one is perfect. Rather, it is to acknowledge that they contributed positively to society despite their imperfections. This message resonates with all of us, who are well aware of our weaknesses, yet can take heart that our flaws need not be a handicap against making meaningful contributions to society ourselves, with God’s help.\n\nThe Lincoln Statue, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington DC.\n\nCredit: Wikipedia, public domain\n\nThose who harbor animosity towards Western nations, inextricably linked to Christianity, often target such public art for destruction precisely because they want to work against this positive message. The vandalism of statues of Winston Churchill (in London), George Washington and Junipero Serra by the neo-Marxist Black Lives Matter mobs exemplifies this sentiment. These acts are driven by a desire to erase the national character embodied by these figures, constituting an attack not just on national values, but on Western values and ultimately on Christ himself.\n\nHowever, amidst the destructive tendencies of recent times, there are signs of hope. Commissions for new public art in the classical realist style, such as a sculpture commemorating the armed forces in the United States and plans for a World War I memorial in Washington, D.C., offer a glimmer of optimism. While these new works must remain true to historical accuracy, serving as faithful records of the sacrifices made by generations past, untainted by the ideological biases of the present, especially the Marxist-driven rewriting of history, their creation is a positive development.\n\nRecent visits to national parks in the Eastern United States, associated with the battles of the American Revolution and the Civil War, have revealed numerous statues commemorating key figures and events. This program should be encouraged, as it connects the public with the nation’s historical and cultural heritage. I would like to see us double down on commissioning such works to assert our national identity against those who wish to destroy it.\n\nJohn Adams, Quincy Massachusetts.

They can be encouraged, for example, to copy the statues - literally drawing inspiration - as an artistic exercise, and summarize the stories in their own words, describing how these figures inspire them to be good Americans or Britons. This exposure can instill a sense of pride and a desire to contribute to the nation's legacy as a Christian nation committed to serving its people and upholding its core values.\n\nProtection against vandalism in public squares within our cities and towns is also crucial – perhaps by installing railings around statues or making it an offence to trespass on designated areas around them and to deface or vandalize these public property statues. It was a cause of dismay to me to see the recent defacement of buildings around the White House in Washington, D.C., where pro-Gaza, anti-Israel graffiti remained unremoved for several days, and no one was prosecuted for this act of vandalism. This was just a few yards from the statue of Lincoln, completed in 1922.\n\nWho could do such work today? A Google search for sculptors producing civic art in the classical realist style produced a long list for me, so there are people around. I immediately thought of sculptors such as Dony McManus and Thomas Marsh in the United States, both believing Catholics, and Alexander Stoddart in Scotland, as people who could undertake such commissions. Stoddart’s sculptures, including one of Adam Smith, exemplify the classical realist tradition. If contemporary Scottish nationalism incorporated Christian values and ideas closer to those of Adam Smith rather than the failing Marxist ideas of the failing Scottish Nationalist Party, then Scots might be persuaded that independent Scotland is a good thing (something that hasn't happened so far), creating a nation that would flourish and in so doing would benefit England as well.\n\nAdam Smith, by Alexander Stoddart; Stefan Schäfer, Lich, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSometime in the 1420s, the Italian painters commonly known as Masolino (“Little Thomas”; 1383-1440/7) and Masaccio (“Bad Thomas”; 1401-28) made an altarpiece for the basilica of St Mary Major in Rome, the dedication of which is celebrated today. The precise circumstances of the commission are uncertain. Many scholars believe that it was originally assigned to Masaccio, who worked on it in the first half of 1428, completing most of the large panels of both sides, but died in June of that year; Masolino would then have been asked to finish the work of his former student. Others believe it was commissioned by Pope Martin V Colonna, whose family had long been associated with the basilica, as part of his preparations for the Jubilee which he held in the year 1423. (The regular 25-year cycle of Jubilees had not yet been permanently fixed.)\n\nEach year, during the principal Mass of the Dedication, a shower of white jasmine petals, representing the miraculous snowfall, is let fall from the roof of the basilica during the Gloria; the ceremony is repeated in the evening during the Magnificat of Vespers. It is seen here in a video taken by John Sonnen of Orbis Catholicus in 2010.\n\nBy the mid-17th century, when the piece had long been out of style, it had been removed to the palace of the Farnese family, and cut into pieces, so that all six of the main panels would be visible together; it was also at that point attributed to Fra Angelico, (most improbably, given the radical difference between his style and that of the two Thomases.) The sections were subsequently dispersed, and are now in three different museums: the larger central panels, which depict the foundation of St Mary Major and the Assumption, are in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples; the panels of Ss Jerome and John the Baptist, and of Ss Gregory and Matthias, are in the National Gallery in London; and those of Ss John the Evangelist and Martin and of Ss Peter and Paul are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Two other panels which may have been part of the altarpiece (but this is also uncertain) are in the Painting Gallery of the Vatican Museums: a Crucifixion scene which would have stood as a cuspid on top of the center, and an image of the Dormition of the Virgin, which would have been part of the predella.\n\nThe central panel of the recto side shows the traditional legend of the foundation of the basilica. In the mid-4th century, a wealthy couple named John and Mary, having no heirs, determined to dedicate their fortune to some pious work, and prayed to the Virgin to let them know what She would like them to do. That night, August 5th, she appeared to them both, and also to Pope Liberius, and told them that in the morning, they would find a part of the Esquiline Hill covered in snow, and in that spot, they should build a church in Her honor. (Snowfalls are exceedingly rare in Rome even in the winter.) Pope Liberius traces out the plan of the basilica in the snow with a hoe, as John and Mary look on.\n\nNeither Masolino nor Masaccio was a native Florentine; Masolino was born in a small town in Umbria called Panicale, about 18 miles west of Perugia, and Masaccio in a town about 24 miles to the south and east of Florence called San Giovanni Valdarno. Nevertheless, they both exemplify the style which predominated in Florence in the 15th century, and exercised a tremendous influence elsewhere. This style leaned strongly away from the richly decorative tradition which had prevailed in the 14th century, especially in Florence’s great rival Siena, known as the International Gothic, and laid much greater emphasis on perspective and the solidity of the figures. This panel, which was originally placed to the left of the panel above, shows Ss Jerome and John the Baptist. The former is included here because of the tradition that his relics were taken from Bethlehem, where he died, to Rome, and laid in the basilica of Mary Major. (If this tradition is true, they were subsequently lost, possibly when the basilica was badly damaged in the Sack of Rome in 1527.)\n\nTo the right of the central panel are Ss John the Evangelist and Martin. The station church for the feast day of the former, December 27, is Mary Major, while Pope Martin V chose his papal name because he was elected on the feast of St Martin in 1417.\n\nThe central panel of the verso side shows the Assumption, which is celebrated ten days after the dedication of St Mary Major."
