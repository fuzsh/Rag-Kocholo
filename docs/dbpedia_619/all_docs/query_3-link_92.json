For more information, see: Government of Bengal, Government of Bombay, and Government of Madras.\n\nPrince Governor\n\nDuring the Qājār period (1794-1925), the government of Iranian provinces was devolved to regional Governors who were often, though not always, Princes of the Royal line, and were therefore referred to in British sources as Prince Governors.

In the early years of the Company, copying documents and book-keeping comprised the greater part of a Writer's duties but it continued to be used as a rank in the Company's service long after the duties of the Company's officials had ceased to be primarily commercial (it last appears as a civil service rank in the East India Register in 1841). The term ‘Writer’ could also mean a copying clerk in an office, either employed at East India House in London or by the Central, Provincial and District authorities in India."
