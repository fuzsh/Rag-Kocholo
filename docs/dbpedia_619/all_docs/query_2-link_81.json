        "text": "Cheers to helping homeless animals! Join us for a special event in which Obbink Distilling is doing its own signature cocktail to benefit Tri-County Humane Society. For every cocktail sold, TCHS will get $1! We'll also have adorable, adoptable animal guests.\n\n** This clinic is part of our Companion Walk **\n\nJoin Tri-County Humane Society for our microchip clinic! No appointment is necessary; this is a walk-in clinic.\n\nMicrochips are permanent forms of identification that can be picked up via scanners. (They are not tracking devices.) All TCHS cats and dogs are microchipped before they leave the building for their new homes, but we're able to do the same service for other animals.\n\nThe cost is $10 plus tax. That little chip can offer a big sense of security.\n\nThe Minnesota Spay and Neuter Assistance Program is bringing its mobile surgery unit back to our shelter!\n\nMnSNAP is a 501Â©(3) nonprofit that collaborates with communities across Minnesota to increase access to affordable veterinary care. We are happy to welcome this organization to our property!\n\nNote: TCHS is the host for these events, but all questions regarding the clinics should be directed to MnSNAP."
