        "text": "On Tuesday, April 25, 2023, Dorothy Bullock in her 101st year. Reunited with her beloved husband John Walker Bullock (2000). Dear mother of Susan Edwards (Allan) of London and Nancy Binder (John) of Waterloo. Loving and proud grandmother of Tom Binder, Ann Binder, Laura Herbert (Mike), and Heather Edwards (Alain Houle). Great-grandmother of Marlee and Cade Herbert. Predeceased by her parents Robert and Louise Nicholson and her four brothers Hugh, Robert, Fred, and Richard Nicholson.\n\nDorothy and John shared so many interests; they were true partners. Their lives centered around family, church, music, and sports.\n\nShe joined Metropolitan United Church in 1942 and was involved in many aspects including the Young People’s Group in the 1940s, the UCW and Bakers’ Dozen. She was the contralto soloist for many years and was a choir member for almost 50 years, with John in the bass section for almost 40 years. They were regular subscribers and supporters of Orchestra London. She loved volunteering at the Kiwanis Music Festival, enjoying all the performances as she assisted the adjudicator with paperwork. Many gatherings of friends or family ended with a singsong around the piano.\n\nDorothy excelled in sports, competing as a WOSSAA track star in Strathroy and continuing as a life-long sports enthusiast. Dorothy and John were avid golfers at Sunningdale, with Mom buying her last new golf clubs at age 90. They curled at London Curling Club and co-chaired the Ceremonies Committee when the Silver Broom came to London in 1981. Playing cards was a big part of her life too, whether it was Knock Rummy with the kids, or bridge with her mother and brothers, and later with Sue and Al. When the family came to visit the card table went up! She also enjoyed many years of playing duplicate bridge with her Sunningdale friends.\n\nDorothy was proud of her contribution to Canada’s war effort. For one summer she and a friend from Strathroy joined the Farmerettes and worked at a farm in the Grimsby area. When she moved to London and was hired by London Life, she became the Mistress of Ceremonies for the highly regarded London Life Troupe Show that toured to entertain the troops in Southwestern Ontario.\n\nA service of celebration for Dorothy’s life will be held at Westview Funeral Chapel, 709 Wonderland Road North, London on Friday, May 5, 2023 at 1:30 p.m., with Rev. Dr. Jeff Crittenden of Metropolitan United Church officiating. A livestream of the celebration of life will be available for those unable to attend in person. To register for the livestream, please click here:\n\nCelebration of Life for Dorothy Bullock\n\nFor those wishing to make a memorial donation, please consider the Sanctuary Renovation Fund at Metropolitan United Church, 468 Wellington Street, London, N6A 3P8."
