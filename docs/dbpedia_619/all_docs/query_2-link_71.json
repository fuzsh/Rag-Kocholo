        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nWhen it comes to the finer shadings of status, the British could never be called slouches at decoding those telltale clues of vocal inflection and sartorial manner that separate noblesse from nonentity, aristo from arriviste.\n\nBut some of that may be about to change.\n\nUntil now, when Queen Elizabeth II summoned some 3,000 of her subjects to Buckingham Palace each year to receive honors known colloquially as gongs (medals) and K's (knighthoods), even the list of the newly anointed notables offered grandeur by grade, respect by ranking.\n\nTo a cacophony of approving grunts from some and disapproving harrumphs from others, however, a body of legislators called the House of Commons Public Administration Committee recommended this month that the list of available aristocratic honors be trimmed drastically, from 16 to 4, and that the word ''empire'' be replaced with ''excellence'' in such medals as the Order of the British Empire. Most radical of all, it urged that knighthoods and their female equivalent, the title of dame, be abolished within five years.\n\nYou can imagine the fuss.\n\nAn editorial in The Daily Express ascribed the proposals to ''political correctness'' within the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair, bent on ''flinging away centuries of precedent and tradition.'' Alan Duncan, a legislator from the opposition Conservatives, called the plans ''childish and trivial.'' The Times of London, by contrast, pronounced the proposed changes ''sensible, practical and welcome.''\n\nAt the center of it all is a system dating back centuries that enables monarchs to reward the loyal for their services and co-opt the useful for their influence -- even, some whisper in the corridors of power, return political favors with medals and titles.\n\nBut whatever else, the rankings let all Britons know their place.\n\nToward the top, there is the Order of St. Michael and St. George, whose subdivisions -- Companion, or C.M.G.; Knight Commander, or K.C.M.G.; and Knight Grand Cross, G.C.M.G. -- gave rise in a television comedy series to a different interpretation of the initials: Call Me God, Kindly Call Me God and God Calls Me God.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
