        "text": "The Honours system of the United Kingdom has a long history with the appointment of Knights Bachelor or “bachelor of England” dating back to the Norman Conquest in 1066. Prior to the introduction of the Order of British Empire in 1917 by King George V, appointments to Orders of Chivalry had been exclusive. The outbreak of the First World War and the sacrifices made in all areas of the society led to a desire to widen the Honours systems..\n\nTimeline\n\n1348\n\nThe Order of the Garter: Founded by King Edward III of England. It continues to be the most senior Order of Chivalry. Ladies of the Garter were appointed soon after its founding which continued until King Henry VII discontinued the practice.\n\n1687\n\nThe Order of the Thistle: Founded on the 29th May by King James VII of Scotland and James II of England to reward Scottish nationals for their service. The Order originally had 12 Members with admission as a personal gift of the King only.\n\n1725\n\nThe Order of the Bath: King George I formally established the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. Comprised of one class known as Knight Companions, with the post nominals KB, the Order was limited to 35 appointments. In the same year, the Order established a Chapel at Westminster Abbey where the first installation of Knights took place on the 21st June 1725.\n\n1815\n\nThe Order of the Bath: The Prince Regent (later George IV) introduced the current three levels of appointments; Knight Grand Cross, Knight Commander and Companion of the Order. The restructure also included admitting a small number of distinguished civilian appointments.\n\n1818\n\nThe Order of St Michael and St George: The Order was founded by the Prince Regent (later George IV,) following the Napoleonic Wars to recognise service by citizens in Malta and the Ionian Islands.\n\n1827\n\nThe Order of the Thistle: Interest in the Order was revived and King George IV increased the maximum number of appointments in the Order to 16.\n\n1847\n\nThe Order of the Bath: Queen Victoria issued new Statutes for the Order, dropping ‘Military’ from the title and allowing civilian appointments to all levels of the Order.\n\n1868\n\nThe Order of St Michael and St George: Changes were made to the Order’s Statutes to encompass all British citizens living or serving abroad and allow for greater recognition of services to foreign affairs. This is still at the heart of the Order today.\n\n1896\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order: The Order was created by Queen Victoria to recognise personal service to the Sovereign, members of the Royal Family and senior representatives of the Sovereign.\n\n1901\n\nThe Order of the Garter: The practice of appointing Ladies of the Garter was revived by King Edward VII when he appointed Queen Alexandra a Lady of the Garter. Lady appointments were restricted to Queen Consorts and not considered ‘Companions’ of the Order.\n\n1902\n\nOrder of Merit: King Edward VII created the Order of Merit to award those who had shown “exceptionally meritorious service in our Navy and our Army or who may have rendered exceptionally meritorious service towards the advancement of the Arts, Literature and Sciences”. The Order was open to both men and women with admission the personal gift of the Sovereign.\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order: King Edward VII created the Royal Victorian Chain as a personal decoration for Royal personage and eminent British subjects and is considered the highest class of the Royal Victorian Order\n\n1906\n\nThe Order of St Michael and St George: A Chapel within St Paul’s Cathedral was dedicated to the Order, with the first Service of Thanksgiving taking place on the 12th June and attended by King Edward VII and the Prince of Wales (later George V), as Grand Master.\n\n1911\n\nThe Order of the Thistle: The new ‘Home Chapel’ of the Order was established by King Edward VII at St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh. Since 1687 and the deposition of King James II and the destruction of the Chapel at the Palace of Holyrood house there had been no Chapel associated with the Order.\n\n1917\n\nOrder of the British Empire: King George V created an Order to honour those who had served non-combatant roles during the First World War. This was the first time women were honoured on such a wide scale throughout all levels of the Order.\n\nCompanions of Honour: Alongside the creation of the Order of the British Empire, King George V also created the Companions of Honour. The honour was to recognise the achievement of those who have contributed to Arts, Science and Medicine.\n\n1918\n\nOrder of the British Empire: The Order of the British Empire was divided into Military and Civil Divisions, which continues to this day.\n\n1926\n\nKnights Bachelor: King George V approved that insignia was to be presented and worn by those who were appointed.\n\n1935\n\nOrder of Merit: Statues of the Order expanded to include those belonging the Royal Air Force (RAF).\n\n1936\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order: King Edward VIII amended the Statutes of the Order to include the appointment of women, and appointed Queen Mary as the first Dame Grand Cross.\n\n1937\n\nOrder of the British Empire: The images of George V and Queen Mary are displayed on the insignia. Queen Mary was appointed Grand Master of the Order and the colour of the ribbon changes from purple to rose pink with grey accents.\n\n1938\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order: King George VI dedicated The King’s Chapel of the Savoy as the “Home” Chapel of the Order.\n\n1940\n\nOrder of the British Empire: It was announced that The King could appoint a person as a Commander, Officer or Member of the Order for gallantry and acts of bravery not in the face of the enemy.\n\n1943\n\nCompanions of Honour: Number of appointments was increased to a maximum of 65 Members\n\n1960\n\nOrder of the British Empire: On the 20th May, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, as Grand Master, dedicated the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n1962\n\nKnights Bachelor: The Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor established their “Home” Chapel in the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great, London.\n\n1965\n\nThe Order of St Michael and St George: The Order’s Statutes were updated to allow the inclusion of women to the Order. Evelyn Bark CMG OBE was the first appointment as a Companion in 1967.\n\n1967\n\nThe Order of St Michael and St George: The appointment of the Current Grand Master of the Order, His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent.\n\n1969\n\nThe Order of Merit: The Order expanded to allow admissions to include Commonwealth Nations that are not Realms. There have been a total of 11 Honorary appointments including, President Eisenhower, Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.\n\n1971\n\nThe Order of the Bath: Women were officially appointed to the Order.
