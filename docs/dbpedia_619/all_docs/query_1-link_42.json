        "text": "nicholson wildlife refuge - franksville, wi\n\nThis 127.4-acre wildlife refuge area may be a work in progress, but it's worth the visit. The area often floods in the rainy seasons, but a recent addition of a boardwalk walkway has made it easier to traverse. Plans are in the works for an observation deck.\n\nUsed extensively by wildlife including Great Blue Herons, Snow Geese, Hooded Mergansers as well as Magnolia Warblers, Red Wing Blackbirds and Savanna Sparrows. A worthwhile stop during migration season. The refuge is located off of 5 Mile Road between Highway H and Nicholson Road.\n\nNo amenities onsite.\n\nPets are not allowed.\n\nLocation: 1210 5 Mile Road, Caledonia, WI (Racine County)\n\nâ€‹For more information, click here."
