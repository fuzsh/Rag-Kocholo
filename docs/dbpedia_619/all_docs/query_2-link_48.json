        "text": "This Knight Commander and Star were made from gold, silver and enamel. No markings.\n\nThe Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George was founded in 1818 by the Prince Regent, later King George IV, to commemorate the British protectorate over the Ionian islands (now in Greece) and Malta, which came under British rule in 1814.\n\nOriginally membership was exclusively for inhabitants of the Ionian islands and Malta, as well as for British citizens who had performed important government services in the Mediterranean area. Since 1879 any citizen of the United Kingdom has been eligible; however, the honor is conferred mostly on officials in colonial affairs, foreign-service officers and diplomats, and others who have performed important duties in Commonwealth countries. Foreigners may be admitted as honorary members.\n\nWilliam IV instituted the three classes of knights of the order, which (in descending order of rank) are Knight Grand Cross or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight Commander or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG, respectively), and Companion (CMG). Membership is limited to 120 Knights Grand Cross, 390 Knights Commanders, and 1,775 Companions. Conferment of the two highest classes of the order entails admission into knighthood, if the candidate is not already a knight or dame, and the right to the title of “Sir” or “Dame” as appropriate.\n\nThe set is in mint condition. With ribbon and case of issue by Garrard & Co. LTD. Measurements: Cross: Weight 66.9 g, Dimensions: 68.9 x 94.6 mm, Star: Weight: 106 g, Dimensions: 81 x 80.2 mm."
