        "text": "Dr. Alfred John “Pete” Nicholson passed away on October 2, 2023, in the comfort and peace of his beloved home in Norton, MA, with loved ones by his side. He was 93. Born on June 22, 1930 to Max and Ethel (nee Alfond) Nicholson, Alfred’s older brother Ronnie nicknamed him “Pete” at an early age. Pete grew up in Lawrence, MA, surrounded by a beloved, extended family of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nIn 1954, Pete married his high school sweetheart, Lorraine “Sis” Silverman. Pete and Sis put down roots in Sharon, MA where they raised their five children, frequently welcomed their extended family and made lifelong friends. In 1996, Pete married Lucille “Lucy” (nee Sherry). Pete and Lucy shared a life welcoming family and friends into their charming homes in Norton, MA and North Palm Beach, FL.\n\nPete attended Phillips Academy, Andover (Class of ‘48), Harvard University (Class of ‘52), and Tufts Medical School (Class of ‘55). From 1957 to 1959, he served as a Captain in the Air Force at Mathers AFB in Sacramento, CA. Dr. Nicholson did his residency at Boston City Hospital and in 1963, and then established his own practice in Norwood, MA. For more than two decades, Pete practiced as a general surgeon, for a time as Chief of Surgery, at Norwood Hospital. In the later part of his career, Pete and Lucy (who was an RN) established and ran one of the first non-invasive vascular labs in the country.\n\nPete relished his well-earned retirement, devotedly tending his English gardens in Norton, keeping watch over the Intercoastal in Florida, conquering the daily crossword, reading fiction and history, and relishing music, frequently singing, humming, playing keyboards, drumming, tapping his feet and bopping to the beat. Pete was a passionate fan of all Boston sports, but in particular, Harvard football, the Patriots, the Bruins and most of all, the Red Sox, eventually being rewarded with the 6 NFL championships and 4 World series championships. Beginning as a teenager and throughout his active adult years, Pete was an extraordinary golfer who relished competitive play and offering instruction to others. Off the links, Pete relished watching golf from his comfy couch or his leather recliner.\n\nPete delighted in watching British comedies series, and would work their comedic catchphrases into casual conversation. He could, hysterically, perform skits of his favorite comedy albums. But best of all, Pete could spin a yarn. That is to say, Pete was wonderfully funny. And while his humorous and whimsical stories and jokes will endure, they won’t be told with his one-of-a-kind panache, exquisite timing, and perfect punchline delivery, more often than not punctuated by his trademark, contagious laugh.\n\nPete drew inspiration from Coach Jim Valvano’s iconic, wise words: “There are three things everyone should do each day. Number one is laugh. Number two is think—spend some time in thought. Number three, you should have your emotions move you to tears. If you laugh, think and cry, that’s a heck of a day.” Pete was a brilliant and talented, passionate and compassionate, sweet and loving, decent and honorable man, who had one heck of a life. His soul and spirit remain deeply within us, always.\n\nPete is predeceased by his parents, his wife Lucy, and his brother Ronald Nicholson. He is survived by his children, Karen (Dane), Dick (Kathy), Peter, Bill (Sarah), and Nancy (Lars), and by their mother Sis. He is also survived by his grandchildren Zoe, Forrest, Zack (Ryan), Ben, Toby, Charlie (Essence), Max and Lydia, and his great-grandchild Emery.\n\nDuring the last years of their lives, Pete and Lucy were profoundly blessed to have loyal, compassionate and loving care-takers and friends Amy (Mark), Edny (Sergio), Hara, and Jamie (Geralyne), to whom Pete’s family are eternally grateful."
