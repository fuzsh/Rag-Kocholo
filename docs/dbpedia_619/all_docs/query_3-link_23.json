        "text": "Earlier this year, actor Daniel Craig officially ended his five-film run as the iconic British spy James Bond, but while Craig might be hanging up his tux for good, he now has one more thing in common with his famous fictional counterpart. Earlier today, Craig was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by Princess Anne—an honor also shared by none other than Bond, James Bond.\n\nThe royal family shared the news on Twitter, with a photo of Anne placing the honors around Craig's neck.\n\n\"We’ve been expecting you…\" they wrote in the caption, \"The Princess Royal presents Daniel Craig with The Order of St Michael and St George - the same honour held by his character James Bond - in recognition of his outstanding contribution to film and theatre.\"\n\nOriginally created in 1818, the Order of St Michael and St George was first instituted to acknowledge those of high rank in the Ionian Islands and Malta, but was later expanded \"to reward distinguished service in British territories, as well as more generally in foreign affairs,\" according the the royal family's website.\n\nIn From Russia with Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the novels by Bond creator Ian Fleming, on which two of the eventual Bond films would be based, it's mentioned that the infamous secret agent himself was awarded a CMG in the early 1950s, presumably for all of his daring-do on behalf of queen and country.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
