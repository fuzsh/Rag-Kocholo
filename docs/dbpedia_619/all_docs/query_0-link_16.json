        "text": "Harriet Tubman (Author)\n\nHarriet Tubman was an American abolitionist, and a close friend and ally of Fredrick Douglass. Both were born into slavery, escaped to freedom, and devoted their lives to advocating for the rights of African Americans. Their friendship and shared commitment to the cause of emancipation solidified their bond and their lasting impact on the abolitionist movement.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (Author)\n\nFredrick Douglass’ influence helped shape Abraham Lincoln’s view on race and equality. While he was initially critical of Lincoln’s policies and cautious approach to ending slavery, Douglass later praised him for his Emancipation Proclamation and commitment to abolition."
