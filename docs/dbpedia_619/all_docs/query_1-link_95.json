        "text": "From Lalit K Jha\n\nWashington, Feb 5 (PTI) A key Senate committee has confirmed the nomination of US General John Nicholson to the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan.\n\nThe powerful Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday confirmed Nicholsons nomination during a Congressional hearing on Afghanistan where the outgoing commander General John Campbell testified before the Senators.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing last week, Nicholson said that he would review the plan to cut US troop level by nearly half by the start of next year and criticized Pakistan alleging that \"safe havens\" continue to exist in the country.\n\nGeneral Nicholson is currently US Army commander of NATO land forces. He has served in multiple capacities including chief of staff of operations for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and US Forces - Afghanistan, director of Pakistan/Afghanistan Coordination Cell for the Joint Staff, and deputy commander - Stability of ISAF Regional Command ? South.\n\n\"Lieutenant General Nicholson is a good friend of mine. He appeared before this committee last week. I would urge you to confirm him; he is the best qualified candidate. If I had to pick one man, I would pick Mic Nicholson to replace me. He will do great in Afghanistan,\" Campbell urged the Senators during his testimony.\n\n\"I believe General Nicholsons view that 5,500, well either be able to carry out the counter-terrorism mission or the train, advise and assist, but not both,\" Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said.\n\n\"When an enemy enjoys sanctuary like that, its very difficult to defeat them,\" he said, adding \"This (terrorist safe havens) has been one of the principal challenges. Its a sanctuary that our enemies, in particular the Haqqani Network, have enjoyed inside Pakistan\".\n\nNicholson said it is difficult to defeat the Taliban and Haqqani network when they enjoy terrorist safe haven. And it such it is important to \"enlist\" Pakistan.\n\n\"In this case, Pakistan, to go after those sanctuaries, and then the other important piece is to build up the defense capacity of the Afghans so that they can keep that level of violence down to a manageable level,\" the General said.
