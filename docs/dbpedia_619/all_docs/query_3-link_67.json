        "text": "History and background information on the Royal Victorian Order\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order (RVO) is an order of knighthood that was established by Queen Victoria in 1896 to recognize distinguished civil and military service in Australia and New Zealand. It was previously known as the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire until it was renamed in 1952 to reflect its focus on service within the Commonwealth realms other than the United Kingdom.\n\nThe RVO has five divisions or classes, each with different levels of precedence. These are the Grand Cross, First Class, Second Class, Third Class, and Fourth Class. Members of the first three classes wear the insignia on their left breast, while members of the fourth class wear it on their right breast. The RVO is conferred upon individuals who have rendered exceptional service to the monarch, the Crown, or the Commonwealth realms. Recipients may be foreign nationals or citizens of any of the realms. The RVO is one of several orders of chivalry recognized by the UK government, along with the Order of the Bath, the Order of St. Michael and St. George, and the Order of the Thistle.\n\nOrders of precedence within the British honours system\n\nThe Royal Victorian Order is an order of knighthood in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. It was founded by Queen Victoria on January 9, 1896, to recognize distinguished civil and military service. The order has five divisions or classes, each with its own specific set of insignia:\n\n* Grand Cross (GCVO) – This is the highest rank in the order, and it is limited to 25 members. Members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters GCVO after their name.\n\n* Commander (CVO) – There are approximately 400 commanders in the order. They are entitled to use the post-nominal letters CVO after their name.\n\n* Lieutenant (LVO) – There are around 800 lieutenants in the order. They are entitled to use the post-nominal letters LVO after their name.\n\n* Member (MVO) – There are approximately 1,700 members in the order.

They are not entitled to any post-nominal letters.\n\nThe orders of precedence within the British honours system are based on the date that a person received their award. Within the Royal Victorian Order, the order of precedence depends on the class of the award.

However, if two or more recipients have the same class, they will be listed alphabetically by surname. In addition, some awards may take priority over others depending on the nature of the award.
