        "text": "Michael, St\n\nMichael, St one of the archangels (Jude 9) whose role is divine messenger and executor of God's judgements. His name means ‘Who is like unto God?’ In Revelations 12:7 he is shown as a warrior leading the hosts of heaven, ‘There was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.’\n\nHe is typically represented slaying a dragon, and he may also be shown weighing souls, sometimes as part of the Last Judgement. His feast day (St Michael and All Angels, or Michaelmas Day) is 29 September.\n\nOrder of St Michael and St George in the UK, an order of knighthood instituted in 1818, divided into three classes: Knight or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG/DCMG), and Companion (CMG).\n\nCite this article\n\nPick a style below, and copy the text for your bibliography.\n\nMLA\n\nChicago\n\nAPA\n\n\"Michael, St .\" The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. .

Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.\n\nBecause each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:\n\nModern Language Association\n\nhttp://www.mla.org/style\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style\n\nhttp://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html\n\nAmerican Psychological Association\n\nhttp://apastyle.apa.org/\n\nNotes:\n\nMost online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers. Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content. However, the date of retrieval is often important. Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.\n\nIn addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations. Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list.\n\nMore From encyclopedia.com"
