        "text": "Terms and conditions:\n\nThird Party Liability. Every person on Anderson & Garland Ltd.’s premises at any time shall be deemed to be there at his own\n\nrisk. He shall have no claim against Anderson & Garland Ltd. in respect of any accident which may occur or injury, damage or loss\n\nhowsoever caused, save insofar as the injury, damage or loss shall be caused by the direct negligence of Anderson & Garland Ltd.’s\n\nemployees.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS OF SALE\n\n1. Definitions.\n\nIn these Conditions Anderson & Garland Ltd. who act only as auctioneers and agents for the vendor, are called “The Auctioneers’’, and the representative of Anderson & Garland Ltd. conducting the auction is called “The Auctioneer’’.\n\n2. General.\n\nWhilst Anderson & Garland Ltd. make every effort to ensure the accuracy of their catalogue and the description of\n\nany lot:\n\n(a) Each lot as set out in the catalogue or as divided or combined with any other lot or lots is sold by the vendor\n\nwith all faults, imperfections and errors of descriptions.\n\n(b) Anderson & Garland Ltd. do not accept responsibility for the authenticity, attribution, genuineness, origin, authorship,\n\ndate, age, period, condition or quality of any lot, unless they have been instructed in writing by the vendor\n\nso to certify, and in such case the Auctioneers do so as agents of the vendor and are not themselves responsible for such claims.\n\n(c) All statements, whether printed in the catalogue or made orally, as to any of the matters set out in (b) above are statements of opinion only and are not to be taken as being or implying any warranties or representations of fact by Anderson & Garland Ltd., unless they have been instructed in writing by the vendor so to certify, and in such case the Auctioneers do so as agents of the vendor and are not themselves responsible for such claims.\n\n(d) Any claim under any Statute must be received in writing by the Auctioneer within ten days of the day of the sale.\n\n3. The Auction.\n\n(a) The Auctioneer has absolute discretion to divide any lot, to combine any two or more lots or to withdraw any lot or lots from the\n\nsale, to refuse bids, regulate bidding or cancel the sale without in any case giving any reason or without previous notice. He may bid on behalf of the vendor for all goods which are being offered subject to reserve or at the Auctioneer’s discretion.\n\n(b) The highest bidder shall be the buyer except in the case of a dispute. If during the auction the Auctioneer considers that a dispute has arisen, he has absolute discretion to settle it or to re-offer the lot. The Auctioneer may at his sole discretion determine the advance of bidding or refuse a bid.\n\n(c) Each lot is put up for sale subject to any reserve price placed by the vendor. Where there is no reserve price (but not otherwise) the seller has the right to bid either personally or by any one person (who may be the Auctioneer).\n\n(d) All conditions, notices, descriptions, statements and other matters in the catalogue and elsewhere concerning any lot are subject to any statements modifying or affecting the same made by the Auctioneer from the rostrum prior to any bid being accepted for the lot.\n\n(e) Vehicles: Can all potential new bidders wishing to bid on a vehicle, please be aware that prior to the sale, they will need to provide full ID in the form of a driving licence/passport and a copy of a utility bill.\n\nAgents buying on behalf of a third party must have written authority from their principal clearly stating their authorisation to bid.\n\nWe will also require a 10% deposit of the lower estimate at the time of registering, which can be done during the viewing period. If unsuccessful, then we will issue a refund immediately.\n\nPlease check further auction details as vehicles are usually but not exclusively sold at midday on auction day.\n\n4. Rescission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other terms of these conditions, if within seven days after the sale Anderson & Garland Ltd. have received from the buyer of any lot notice in writing that in his view the lot is a deliberate forgery and within fourteen days after such notification the buyer returns the same to Anderson & Garland Ltd. in the same condition as at the time of sale and by producing evidence, the\n\nburden of proof to be upon the buyer, satisfies Anderson & Garland Ltd. that considered in the light of the entry in the catalogue the lot is a deliberate forgery, then the sale of the lot will be rescinded and the purchase price of the same refunded. In the event of a dispute then the matter shall be settled by arbitration, the arbitrator to be nominated by the President of the Royal Institution of\n\nChartered Surveyors. Both the buyer and the vendor agree to be bound by the decision.\n\n5. Default.\n\nAnderson & Garland Ltd. disclaim responsibility for default by either the buyer or the vendor because they act as agents for the vendor only and therefore do not pay out to the vendor until payment is received from the buyer. Instructions given by telephone are\n\naccepted at the sender’s risk and must be confirmed in writing forthwith.\n\n6.

Bidders are directed to item 7 of our General Conditions of Sale and are advised to attend our viewing days. We cannot accept returns on the basis of inaccuracies caused by the limitations of photographic reproduction.\n\n8.

Each buyer shall forthwith give his full names and permanent address and if called upon to do so by the Auctioneer\n\nshall forthwith pay to Anderson & Garland Ltd. such proportion of the purchase price as the Auctioneer may require. If the buyer fails to do so, the lot may at the Auctioneer’s sole discretion be put up again and re-sold.\n\n9.
