        "text": "3 May 2024\n\nThe following list shows the sequence in which the insignia of Orders, Decorations and Medals should be worn in New Zealand.\n\nIt in no way affects the precedence conferred by the Statutes of certain Orders upon the members thereof. Post-nominal letters (listed in the right-hand column, where applicable) should be shown in the same sequence as the following “Order of Wear” except in the case of Baronets.\n\nDistinctive New Zealand honours are shown in bold.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Orders of Chivalry and other orders: ribbons\n\nThe ribbons of Orders, when the ribbon alone is worn, will be of the width of the ribbon of the Membership (5th class or 5th level) of the Order. If there is no Membership class the ribbon will be of the width of the ribbon of the Companionship (3rd class or 3rd level) of the Order.\n\n2. Awards for gallantry in the Order of the British Empire and British Empire Medal\n\n2.i\n\nAppointments to, or promotions in, the Order of the British Empire and awards of the British Empire Medal, granted between 6 December 1957 and 19 June 1974 for gallantry, are so described, and a silver oak leaf emblem is worn on the ribbon. When the ribbon only is worn the emblem is worn in miniature. Classification of an award as made for gallantry has no effect on seniority of precedence in the various classes of the Order. A person appointed to the Order between 6 December 1957 and 19 June 1974, for gallantry, and subsequently promoted in the Order, retains and wears the insignia of the lower class with the emblem in addition to the insignia of the higher class whether promoted for gallantry or otherwise. A holder of the British Empire Medal for Gallantry, granted between 6 December 1957 and 19 June 1974, if subsequently appointed to the Order, continues to wear the emblem on the ribbon of the Medal.\n\n2.ii\n\nOn the ribbon of the British Empire Medal for Gallantry, the gallantry emblem is worn above any bar which may have been granted, and when ribbons are worn alone the gallantry emblem is worn farther from the left shoulder than any silver rose emblem denoting the award of a bar.\n\n3. Campaign (including war, operational and peacekeeping) and Special Service Medals\n\nThese medals are worn in the following sequence or in order of the date of participation in the relevant campaign or operation:\n\n3.i\n\nCampaign Stars and Medals awarded for service in the Second World War (1939-1945) should be worn in the following order: 1939-1945 Star, Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star, Arctic Star, Africa Star, Pacific Star, Burma Star, Italy Star, France and Germany Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939-1945, New Zealand War Service Medal 1939-1945.\n\n3.ii\n\nThe New Zealand Operational Service Medal (instituted in 2002 for operational service completed from 3 September 1945) is worn after the New Zealand War Service Medal 1939-1945 and before any specific campaign medal.\n\n3.iii\n\nThe New Zealand Service Medal 1946-1949 (instituted in 1995).\n\n3.iv\n\nThe Korea Medal (1950-53) and the United Nations Service Medal for Korea are worn together where both are held.\n\n3.v\n\nThe order of wearing the following will vary, and will depend upon, the dates of participation in the relevant campaigns or operations:\n\na Naval General Service Medal (1915-1962).\n\nb General Service Medal (Army and RAF) (1918-1962).\n\nc The General Service Medal, 1962 (instituted in 1964).\n\nd The Vietnam Medal (1964) (instituted in 1968). [The Vietnamese Campaign Medal (star) is worn in accordance with the rules governing foreign medals. See Note 5.]\n\ne The Rhodesia Medal (1980).\n\nf The New Zealand General Service Medal (instituted in 1992, in silver for war-like operations, and in bronze for non-warlike (peacekeeping) operations, with appropriate clasps).\n\ng The East Timor Medal (instituted in 2001).\n\nh The New Zealand General Service Medal (instituted in 2002, with a different ribbon for each operation).\n\ni Service medals of the United Nations Organisation, European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, for which permission to accept and wear has been given.\n\n3.vi\n\nThe New Zealand Special Service Medal (instituted in 2002, with a different ribbon for each specific service) is worn in order of date of award after war, operational and peacekeeping medals.\n\n3.vii\n\nThe Australian International Force East Timor (INTERFET) Medal is worn as a Commonwealth medal.\n\n3.viii\n\nThe Medal of the Multi-National Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai is worn as a foreign medal.\n\n4. Mentions in Despatches, King’s Commendations and Queen’s Commendations\n\n4.i\n\nMention in Despatches, 1939-1945. The single bronze oak leaf Emblem signifying in the Armed Forces and the Merchant Navy, either a Mention in Despatches, a King’s Commendation for brave conduct, or a King’s Commendation for valuable service in the air, if granted for service in the Second World War, 1939-45, is worn on the ribbon of the War Medal 1939-45. If the War Medal has not been granted, the Emblem is worn directly on the coat, after any Medal ribbons. (If there are no medal ribbons, the Emblem is worn in the position in which a single ribbon would be worn.)\n\n4.ii\n\nMention in Despatches, 1945-1996. The single bronze oak leaf Emblem, if granted for service in operations after the cessation of hostilities in the Second World War, is worn on the ribbon of the appropriate General Service or Campaign Medal. If such a medal has not been granted, the Emblem is worn directly on the coat after any medal ribbons. (If there are no medal ribbons, the Emblem is worn in the position in which a single ribbon would be worn.)\n\n4.iii\n\nThe single bronze oak leaf Emblem is also used in the Armed Forces to denote a King’s or Queen’s Commendation for brave conduct or a King’s or Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air granted since the cessation of hostilities in the Second World War.\n\n4.iv\n\nKing’s Commendation for Brave Conduct, 1939-1945, and 1946-1951; Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct, 1952-1996. The Emblem of silver laurel leaves granted to civilians, other than those in the Merchant Navy, to denote a King’s Commendation for brave conduct during the Second World War, 1939-1945, is worn on the ribbon of the Defence Medal. When the Defence Medal has not been granted or the award is for services subsequent to the war, the Emblem of silver laurel leaves is worn directly on the coat after any medal ribbons. (If there are no medal ribbons, the Emblem is worn in the position in which a single ribbon would be worn.)\n\n4.v\n\nKing’s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air, 1939 – 1945, and 1946 - 1951; Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air, 1952 – 1996. The oval silver Badge granted to denote a civil King’s Commendation or Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air is worn on the coat immediately below any medals or medal ribbons, or in civil airline uniform, on the panel of the left breast pocket. (If there are no medal ribbons, the Emblem is worn in the position in which a single ribbon would be worn.)\n\n5. Commonwealth and Foreign Orders, Decorations and Medals\n\n5.i\n\nAwards by Commonwealth countries of which the Sovereign is Head of State may only be accepted and worn when approval has been granted by the Prime Minister acting under authority delegated by The Sovereign.\n\n5.ii\n\nAwards by Commonwealth countries of which the Sovereign is not Head of State and Foreign countries may only be accepted and worn when approval has been granted by the Governor-General acting under authority delegated by The Sovereign.\n\n5.iii\n\nThe general rule is that when Commonwealth or Foreign awards are being worn on occasions specifically connected with the donor country, pride of place may be given to the awards of that country. On such occasions, a Commonwealth or Foreign award may be worn in preference, and in a position senior, to that of equivalent awards from the Sovereign. This does not require the wearer to change the order of wear on his/her medal bar.\n\n5.iv\n\nThis Note is subject to, and should be read in conjunction with, the “Rules relating to the acceptance and wear of Commonwealth, foreign and international Honours by New Zealand citizens”, dated 23 July 2007 (and subsequent amendments).\n\n6. New Zealand Memorial Crosses\n\n6.i\n\nThe New Zealand Memorial Cross, sanctioned by King George VI in 1947, is issued to certain relatives of New Zealand military and mercantile marine personnel who lost their lives while on active service during the period from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, inclusive, or who died or subsequently died from causes attributable to that service. The Cross is worn from a narrow purple ribbon about the neck. Women may, however, wear the Cross on the left shoulder with the ribbon in the form of a bow. The Cross is not worn in miniature and the ribbon alone is not worn.\n\n6.ii\n\nThe New Zealand Memorial Cross, sanctioned by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960, is issued to certain relatives of New Zealand military and mercantile marine personnel who have lost their lives while on operational service outside of New Zealand subsequent to 2 September 1945, or who died or subsequently die from causes attributable to that service. The Cross is in the form of a brooch and is worn on the left side below any personal decorations and medals. In uniform, it is worn on the pocket, below any personal decorations and medals. If no personal decorations or medals are held the Cross is worn in a comparable position. The Cross is not worn in miniature and there is no ribbon.\n\n6.iii\n\nThe New Zealand Memorial Cross may be worn by the relatives on those occasions on which Decorations and Medals are worn. Those relatives who receive a Cross in respect of more than one deceased service man or woman may wear the additional Cross or Crosses.\n\n7. Lapel badges and rosettes\n\n7.i\n\nThe lapel badges of the New Zealand Orders, New Zealand Gallantry and Bravery Awards, the New Zealand Antarctic Medal and the New Zealand Distinguished Service Decoration are worn at the discretion of the holder on the left lapel or left side of the dress, on those occasions the full-size or miniature insignia are not worn. Lapel badges are not worn when in uniform. Usually only one lapel badge or rosette is worn at a time.\n\n7.ii\n\nThe Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor rosette is worn by Knights Bachelor in the button-hole on the left lapel.\n\n7.iii\n\nThe rosette or lapel button of the Order of St John is worn in the same manner as prescribed in paragraph 7i, above.\n\n7.iv\n\nThe rosettes of the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Victorian Medals, and the Order of the British Empire and British Empire Medal, are worn in the same manner as prescribed in paragraph 7i, above.\n\n8. Life saving awards\n\nThe Order of St John Life Saving Medals (gold, silver and bronze) and the gold silver and bronze medals awarded by the Royal Humane Society of New Zealand, and ribbons denoting the same, may be worn on the right side of the coat on all occasions when official Orders, Decorations and Medals are worn.\n\n9. Obsolete and other awards\n\nFor the order of wear of obsolete Orders, Decorations and Medals and other awards not usually conferred on New Zealanders, enquiries should be made with the Honours Unit.\n\n10. Wearing of Decorations and Medals by Next of Kin or Family Members\n\n10.i\n\nThe insignia of any order, decoration or medal, including miniatures, lapel badges and ribbons, may only be worn by the person to whom they are awarded.\n\n10.ii\n\nThere is a convention or custom that is widely understood that the next of kin and other relatives may wear, on the right side only, on ANZAC and similar days of remembrance, the military service medals of deceased persons. The convention is a matter of personal discretion and limited to days of remembrance. It applies only to service medals and decorations mounted on a medal bar (full-size or miniature) and not to neck badges, sashes, sash badges, or breast stars.\n\n11. Awards Issued by Non-Governmental and Private Organisations, and Commercially Produced Medals\n\n11.i\n\nAwards issued by non-governmental and private organisations, other than those of the Order of St John and the Royal Humane Society of New Zealand, may not be worn, either with, below or on the right side, with official Orders, Decorations and Medals.\n\n11.ii\n\nAwards produced on a commercial basis may not be worn, either with, below or on the right side, with official Orders, Decorations and Medals.\n\n12. Enquiries\n\nAll enquiries regarding this “Order of Wear” should be directed in the first instance to the Honours Unit, Cabinet Office, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Parliament Buildings, Wellington. The current, approved version of this “Order of Wear” is posted on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's website.\n\n13. Cancellation of previous “Order of Wear”\n\nThe “Order of Wear” dated 4 September 2020 is hereby cancelled."
