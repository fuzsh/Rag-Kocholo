A pioneer of its kind, the Academy is home to a variety of multi-disciplinary anti-trafficking initiatives that include conferences, symposia, trainings, presentations, workshops, research, and publications. Its impact crosses national borders.\n\nOn the 20th Anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, The John J. Brunetti Human Trafficking Academy offered a critical assessment of the state of labor trafficking domestically and abroad. Despite tremendous progress against human trafficking, there is presently an estimated 24.9 million people trapped in forced labor in industries including agriculture, construction, domestic work, and manufacturing around the world. Whether proliferated by disreputable supply chains, propelled by vulnerability in migrations, condoned by culture, emboldened by unenforced laws or even in some cases sanctioned by governments, this year’s Summer Academy examined how to eradicate this modern slavery of epic proportions through a victim-centered approach.\n\nThe Summer Academy was offered in an online format due to COVID-19 and featured 15 cutting-edge courses taught by leading experts in the field nationwide.\n\n“Our work in the field of combatting human trafficking is a natural extension of our commitment to teaching, service, and ethical leadership firmly grounded on the Catholic social teachings. Whether at the recruitment, transit, or at the exploitation site, concerted efforts are needed to address the root causes of trafficking, mainly vulnerability based on inequality and the demand side of trafficking,” said David A. Armstrong, J.D., President of St. Thomas University, in his address to the participants. Academics, attorneys, government officials, service providers, case managers, healthcare workers, investigators, students, and others from faith-based, public, and private sectors dedicated themselves to the rigorous curriculum and engaged in a rich dialogue with the course instructors and each other in the discussion forums. The diverse group of participants hailing from over 10 states and four continents was welcomed by the International Council on Human Trafficking Chairman, and President Emeritus of St. Thomas University, Rev. Msgr. Franklyn M. Casale, and by Professor Tamara F. Lawson, Dean of St. Thomas University School of Law.\n\n“What makes our annual Academy so effective is the fact that in the Catholic intellectual tradition of higher education we deliver the highest value in education through a rock-solid array of front-line courses taught by remarkable experts of international acclaim. We are extremely honored to host so many trailblazers in this year’s Academy who fully and critically dissect the status of affairs in labor trafficking and address the values of good law and policy,” said Professor Dr. Roza Pati, Founder and Director of the Academy, in her opening remarks on A Human Rights Approach to Labor Trafficking.\n\nThis year’s expert instructors included one of the most influential legal scholars alive: Professor Dr. Catharine A. MacKinnon of Harvard Law School. Prof. MacKinnon is among the most widely-cited legal scholars in the English language and over time the most widely-cited woman. She is a forerunner on issues of equality “predicated on eliminating dominance and subordination … MacKinnon [is] an influential legal theorist, helping to transform legal education by calling attention to issues affecting women and transforming the law for women globally by opening the legal system to their injuries and exposing the gendered basis of sex crimes.” (Encyclopedia Britannica). Prof. MacKinnon prepared a distinguished lecture specifically for the Academy focused on The Intersections of Sex and Labor Trafficking.\n\nThe Academy also featured Martha Mendoza, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and 2019 finalist, whose investigations into slavery in the seafood sector and use of technology led to the freedom of more than 2,000 men; Martina E. Vandenberg, who spent two decades fighting human trafficking, forced labor, rape as a war crime, and violence against women and who led novel pursuits of civil litigation against diplomats who exploited women in domestic servitude; Susan French, a former federal human trafficking prosecutor with the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice, who has successfully brought high impact landmark labor trafficking cases such as U.S. v. Calimlim and U.S. v. Kil Soo Lee; Professor Kathleen C. Kim of Loyola Law School, LMU in Los Angeles, the co-author of Human Trafficking Law and Policy, the leading casebook on human trafficking; Professor Dr. Mohamed Y. Mattar, the founding Executive Director at The Protection Project of the Foreign Policy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, and an international expert on anti-trafficking legislation with over 15 years of experience in more than 75 countries; Dr. Elizabeth K. Hopper, Director of Project REACH at The Trauma Center at Justice Resource Institute; Dr. Hilary Chester, Associate Director of Anti-Trafficking Programs of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Migration and Refugee Services; and Professor Nora V. Demleitner, Professor of Law at Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nCourses were also taught by Miami attorneys Barbara Martinez, Former Chief of Special Prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney’s Office SDFL and Global Compliance and Investigation Team at Holland & Knight LLP; Ana Vallejo, Co-Director & Attorney at VIDA Legal Assistance, Inc.; Alicia Priovolos, Director of the Human Trafficking Unit of the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office; and Liza Smoker, Managing Director of the Human Trafficking Academy.\n\nThe Academy’s work is well-grounded on the life, experience, perseverance, courage, and wisdom of survivors of human trafficking who offer most important insights and expertise to guide the Academy’s ongoing efforts. The Academy was honored to host survivors of human trafficking both as expert instructors as well as participants. The Honorable Suleman Masood, a Council Member on the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, and The Honorable Evelyn Chumbow, a survivor of child labor trafficking turned anti-trafficking activist and public speaker who has focused her life’s work on ending modern-day slavery, guided all who attended in the path to empowerment toward an effective fight for human dignity.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, the World Day Against Trafficking in Person was honored at the Summer Academy with courses aimed at examining the impacts of tradition and culture in labor trafficking. In addition, The Honorable Katherine Fernandez Rundle of the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office greeted participants at the Academy with a video message.\n\nThe Academy extends its appreciation to all who participated in this year’s Summer Academy, and to our most generous benefactor, the late Mr. John J. Brunetti. We look forward to offering an entirely new lineup of dynamic courses taught by the foremost experts at next year’s Summer Academy on July 26 – 30, 2021!\n\nThe full list of expert instructors at the 2020 Summer Academy is available here.\n\nIn January and February, 2020, Dr. Roza Pati, Founder and Director of The John J. Brunetti Human Trafficking Academy, traveled to India to educate and train higher-level students and faculty, coming to Kerala from 40 law schools and colleges from all over India, on human rights and human trafficking. She was officially invited by esteemed professor of law — Dr. K.C. Sunny, Vice Chancellor of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies Kochi, and Head of the Department of Law and Dean School Legal Studies of Central University of Kerala. In her presentations and lectures, Dr. Pati focused on academic leadership towards a culture of lawfulness, the value and meaning of the struggle against human trafficking, and the significance of one’s ability to challenge the cultural constructs that have destined certain groups to remain vulnerable and susceptible to human trafficking.\n\nEfforts were particularly focused at The National University of Advanced Legal Studies in Kochi, Emakulam, Kerala, India (“NUALS”) and The Central University of Kerala School of Legal Studies (“CUK”) in Thiruvalla, Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India. In addition, Dr. Pati participated in discussions and roundtables with other faculty, from various law schools in Kerala, Karnataka, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, with whom there is an established relationship thanks to Dr. Pati’s prior lectures tour on human trafficking in the region in 2015. Dr. Pati’s activities included inter alia, a Certificate Program in Human Trafficking Law and Policy in International and Domestic Legal Framework at The National University of Advanced Legal Studies; the Barrister M. K. Nambyar Law Lecture 2020, a named lecture before legal professionals and the Kerala Bar members, on Rights and Their Limits in Comparative Jurisprudence; Keynote Address The Unmet Challenge: Women’s Rights on the Eve of Beijing+25 at the two-day International Seminar on Realization of Human Rights of Women: Changing Dimensions, Challenges and Recourse; Keynote Address Neoliberalism and Human Rights at the International Interdisciplinary Seminar on State, Civil Society and Human Rights: Neoliberal Reflections, organized by the Central University of Kerala School of Legal Studies; as well as daily lectures and discussions with students and faculty from various parts of the country.\n\n“An objective of this work was to train students and interested faculty who focus on research on local dimensions of human trafficking. These initiatives are novel in these schools, as there is little to none done so far on this subject matter. This valuable cooperation between St. Thomas University School of Law and Indian universities will lead to significant advancement in the curriculum of law schools, and other colleges to incorporate so much needed international standards of the protections of human rights, including prohibition of modern slavery. The Indian counterparts welcomed the cooperation, and we have already started planning more certificate programs, symposia, conferences and publications on human rights, human trafficking law, policy and practice. India, the world’s largest democracy, is an amazing country with a rich, multi-religious culture and extraordinary people, and it is but natural that our Academy, located in the world’s greatest democracy, the U.S.A., expands this cooperation with the legal academy as well as the civil society. Indian students are some of the most perceptive and intelligent students I have had the honor to teach, and I look forward to many more encounters with them.” said Dr. Pati, reflecting on her visit to India.\n\nThe Academy looks forward to further fruitful cooperation with academic institutions in India as it strives to exchange thoughts and ideas with India’s future leaders against human trafficking and assist in empowering faculty to disseminate this knowledge throughout the country.\n\nThe event series was designed to focus on the four actions presented in Pastoral Orientations on Internally Displaced People: Welcome, Protect, Promote and Integrate in furtherance of this year’s theme of the Migrants and Refugee Section of the Dicastery for the Promotion of Integral Human Development at the Vatican.\n\n“The John J. Brunetti Human Trafficking Academy and the LL.M./ J.S.D. Program in Intercultural Human Rights continue to lead on the issues that touch the lives of the most vulnerable in our human family, in worldwide solidarity. We encourage the local and global community, all people of good will: to know in order to understand, to be close in order to serve, to listen in order to be reconciled, to share in order to grow, to be involved in order to promote, and to cooperate in order to build, as the Holy Father urges us to do,” said the Academy’s Founder and Director, Prof. Dr. Roza Pati, former member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.\n\nWelcome: The series opened with Welcoming People on the Move: Our Moral Calling to Serve the Most Vulnerable.

He also shared his experience in contributing to the development of standards regarding the due process rights of asylum seekers through a novel interpretation of the country’s constitution in the 1980s, which was, in essence, adopted by the country’s Federal Constitutional Court.\n\nLastly, Thear Suzuki, a Presidential Leadership Scholar and Americas Advisory Talent Leader at Ernst & Young, shared her powerful story of fleeing the Cambodian genocide as a refugee after her family was forced to spend four years in a Khmer Rouge labor camp. Ms. Suzuki also honored the impact of those who welcomed her family and helped them rebuild their lives in the United States, including their sponsor, U.S. Catholic Conference Migration & Refugee Services.\n\nProtect: The Academy partnered with the Immigration Law Student Association to offer From Crisis to Crossroads: Protections in Law for Migrants and Refugees, an event focused on various forms of protections in law for migrants and refugees, including those that protect against human trafficking. The panel of distinguished attorneys was moderated by Minglu Michele Guo, a St. Thomas law student and Graduate Fellow of the Academy. Prof. Michael S. Vastine, Director of the Immigration Clinic at St. Thomas University School of Law, discussed immigration policy and the difficulties that victims of a violent crime, including human trafficking, may face during the application process. Ignacio J. Vázquez Jr., Chief of the Special Prosecutions Section at the U.S. Attorney’s Office SDFL, focused on his work in effectively prosecuting the crimes of human trafficking and human smuggling, as well as the challenges faced by victims of human trafficking in the process of survival. Johanna Oliver Rousseaux, a Presidential Leadership Scholar, president of Americans for Immigrant Justice, and attorney with Jones Day, inspired attendees with her experiences providing pro bono services to refugees and asylum seekers in U.S. detention facilities, and highlighted the need for, as well as the rewarding experience of the pro-bono work to benefit the most vulnerable in the community.\n\nPromote: The Academy was proud to cooperate with U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Migration and Refugee Services and SHEPHERD (Stop Human Trafficking and Exploitation. Protect, Help, Empower, and Restore Dignity) on Promoting the Well-Being of Migrants and Survivors of Human Trafficking: The Role of Local, Community, and Faith-Based Organizations. “Migration is as old as civilization and has enriched our world tremendously creating nations and bringing cultural differentiation throughout the globe. Our Academy hones in on the issue of human trafficking, but there is certainly an intersection between migration, refugees, and human trafficking,” said Rev. Msgr. Franklyn M. Casale, Chair of the International Council on Human Trafficking and president emeritus of St. Thomas University, in his opening remarks. The national panel was moderated and spearheaded by Lisa Lungren, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishop’s National Education and Outreach Coordinator of Immigration and Anti-Trafficking.
