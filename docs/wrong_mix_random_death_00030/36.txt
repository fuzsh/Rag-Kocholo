Hank Williams Jr., AKA "Bocephus," is an artist who has seen many ups and downs in his career. He's won top awards, scored a string of No. 1 hits and even served as the voice of Monday Night Football, but there's a lot more to his story.

Born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in Shreveport, La., he followed in the footsteps of his father, country music icon Hank Williams, in the beginning of his career, mainly paying tribute to his father by singing his music and mimicking his style. But it wasn't until he found his own place in the business that Hank Jr. truly began to find success.

Hank Williams Jr. and Friends was his big breakout album, and joined his unique voice with other artists. It wasn't long after that Hank Williams Jr. had a brush with death in a mountain climbing accident.

In the years since, the country legend has been named Entertainer of the Year multiple times, won Grammy Awards and been inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.
