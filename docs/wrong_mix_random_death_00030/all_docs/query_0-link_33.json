        "text": "Current recipient(s): Dr. Robin Williams\n\nDr. Robin Williams is receiving the Alan Ross Award to recognize her long and impactful career as a paediatrician and child health advocate. Her journey began with receiving a BSc and MD from the University of Toronto and completing her paediatric residency at McMaster and the Hospital for Sick Children. Early practice was in Niagara Falls, where Dr. Williams was a consultant paediatrician and advocate for children and youth while also working in medical education at McMaster University, where she became a full professor of paediatrics in 2002.\n\nDr. Williams retired from clinical practice in 1995 to work as the Medical Officer of Health for the Niagara Region, a position she held for 16 years. Her lifelong interest in child development led to work with Dr. Fraser Mustard on a series of reports that contributed to establishing parental leave and Early Years Centres in Ontario. During the SARS epidemic she participated on the Ontario Scientific SARS Panel whose report and recommendations eventually led to establishing Public Health Ontario. As a founding member of Ontario's Provincial Paediatric Coroners Review committee, she was involved in reviewing unusual child deaths and developing recommendations to improve systems and safety for children for more than 20 years. For her role in conceptualizing and implementing the “18-month well-child strategy” in Ontario, she received the Order of Canada in 2013.\n\nDr. Williams also championed child health causes as an Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health and Special Advisor for the Ministry of Health, focusing on Ontario’s vaccine strategy during the pandemic, working with SickKids (HSC) to support a public information campaign, and building collaboration with the Ontario College of Family Physicians and HSC to educate physicians on COVID-19 and vaccines.\n\nDr. Williams was president of the CPS in 2015 and has chaired the Early Years Task Force since 2008. Her passion for early child development found expression in recent CPS statements on positive parenting, adverse childhood experiences and early relational health, and early literacy. She has been a helpful, welcoming, and inspiring role model and mentor on preventive and public health issues for a generation."
