        "text": "(born 1949). American country and western musician Hank Williams, Jr., was one of the most successful and long-lasting country and western performers. Although in the early years of his career he sang the songs of his legendary father, over time he developed his own voice and sound, a fusion of rock and country.\n\nRandall Hank Williams, Jr., was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, on May 26, 1949. His father—considered by many to have been country music’s finest musician—died when Hank was three. He learned to play a number of instruments when he was a boy, including guitar, banjo, and harmonica. Hank made his singing debut when he was eight and was soon singing 30 to 50 shows a year. At the beginning, he played only his father’s songs. When he was 14, Hank toured with his mother’s traveling music revue, the Audrey Williams Musical Caravan of Stars. His first single was a cover of his father’s “Long Gone Lonesome Blues,” and it landed on the top 10 of the country charts. Within months, at age 15, he had recorded his first album, Hank Williams Jr. Sings the Songs of Hank Williams. By the end of the year (1964), he had recorded two more albums, including Your Cheatin’ Heart, which was the soundtrack to the film biography of his father. In 1965 he wrote and recorded his first original song, “Standing in the Shadows,” which became a hit. He also starred in the film A Time to Sing (1968). On the albums that followed, Williams remained faithful to the traditional Nashville sound, and many were content to have him sing his father’s legendary hits.\n\nIn 1974, after drug and alcohol abuse threatened to lead him too closely down his father’s path, Williams left Nashville. By 1975 he started to record albums that reflected his own tastes and interests. He introduced his “outlaw” sound, a fusion of rock and country, on the album Hank Williams, Jr. & Friends. In the summer of that year, Williams fell while mountain climbing and required extensive facial reconstruction and surgeries. Williams emerged to lead one of the most successful and enduring country music careers. Among his most popular albums were Family Tradition (1979), Whisky Bent and Hell Bound (1979), Rowdy (1981), Hank Williams, Jr.’s Greatest Hits I (1982), Montana Cafe (1986), and Born to Boogie (1987).\n\nWilliams was named entertainer of the year in 1987 and 1988 by both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. In 1989 he wrote the theme music for ABC television’s Monday Night Football, “Are You Ready for Some Football?”—for which he won four consecutive Emmy Awards. Also in 1989 he won a Grammy Award for a version of “There’s a Tear in My Beer,” on which he sings along with his father. “Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts” (1996), featured Williams again singing along with his father, plus his son, Shelton Hank Williams—or Hank Williams III. By 2000 Hank Williams, Jr., had recorded nearly 70 albums. Williams wrote an autobiography (with Michael Bane), Living Proof, that was released in 1979."
