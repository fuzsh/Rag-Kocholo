        "text": "Actor, comedian, director, author, host, stage director, and producer, Patrick Huard, has a career boasting over 30 years and is among the most esteemed and beloved figures in the Quebec public eye. His journey is impressive, whether in front of or behind the cameras and spotlights. A walk of life punctuated by successes, both on solo stages where he is applauded by hundreds of thousands of spectators (such as Le Bonheur, Face à Face, 18 ans et plus), on television (notably in Les Honorables and Taxi 0-22), or on the big screen (highlighting Les hommes de ma mère, Mon cirque à moi, Guibord s’en va-t-en guerre, Mommy, and Starbuck).\n\nAdditionally, he portrayed the investigator David Bouchard alongside Colm Feore in both volumes of the action comedy Bon Cop Bad Cop, for which he also wrote the screenplay. These two films achieved immense success, with the first installment holding the all-time record at the Canadian box office. Patrick is currently working on adapting the universe of the two films into a television series format. Also a host, he can be found at the helm of La Tour on TVA and LOL: Qui rira le dernier? on Prime Video in 240 countries and territories. The remarkable career of this multi-talented artist has been recognized with numerous awards at various gala events (including the Olivier Awards, Genie Awards, Gémeaux Awards, ADISQ Awards, and Iris Awards).\n\nMichael co-founded and is CEO of Blue Ant Media. Started in 2011, the global media company is an international production studio and rights business, and owns and operates eight free streaming channels internationally, in addition to a roster of pay TV broadcast channels in Canada. The company is headquartered in Toronto, with six international offices in Los Angeles, New York, Singapore, London, Washington and Sydney.\n\nFor background, Michael co-founded Atlantis Films Limited in 1978. In its early years, Atlantis was primarily a film and television production house, winning an Oscar in 1984 for its short film Boys and Girls. In 1998, Atlantis acquired Alliance Communications in a reverse takeover and the company became Alliance Atlantis Communications. Under Michael’s continued leadership, as Chairman and CEO, the company operated 13 Canadian television networks and also distributed and produced movies and television programs including the hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. In 2007, Michael retired from Alliance Atlantis after selling the company to Canwest Communications and Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael is the co-founder and Chair of The Samara Centre for Democracy (launched in 2008) which is a non-partisan charity that is dedicated to reconnecting citizens to politics. Samara’s research and educational programming shines new light on Canada’s democratic system and encourages greater political participation across the country to build better politics and a better Canada, for everyone.\n\nMichael is a co-founder and co-owner of Closson Chase Vineyards and Winery in Prince Edward Country, Ontario. Founded in 1998, Closson Chase makes Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris wines.\n\nA member of the Order of Canada, Michael has volunteered with numerous community and industry organizations over many years. He is a Senior Fellow at Massey College and co-author of the best-selling book Tragedy in the Commons.\n\nMichael MacMillan est cofondateur et PDG de Blue Ant Media. Créée en 2011, cette entreprise mondiale est à la fois une compagnie de production internationale et une société de droits, qui possède et exploite huit chaînes de diffusion en continu gratuites à l’international, en plus d’une gamme de chaînes de télévision payantes au Canada. L’entreprise a son siège à Toronto et dispose de six bureaux à l’étranger (Los Angeles, New York, Singapour, Londres, Washington et Sydney).\n\nTout a commencé quand Michael a cofondé Atlantis Films Limited en 1978. Dans ses premières années, Atlantis était principalement une compagnie de production cinématographique et télévisuelle, qui a remporté un Oscar en 1984 pour le court métrage Boys and Girls. En 1998, Atlantis a acquis Alliance Communications dans le cadre d’une prise de contrôle inversée et la société est devenue Alliance Atlantis Communications. Sous la direction de Michael, alors président et directeur général, la société a exploité 13 chaînes de télévision canadiennes, et a produit et distribué des films et des programmes télévisés, dont la populaire série CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. En 2007, Michael a pris sa retraite d’Alliance Atlantis après avoir vendu la société à Canwest Communications et à Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael est cofondateur et président du Samara Centre for Democracy (lancé en 2008), une organisation caritative non partisane dont la mission est de reconnecter les citoyens et citoyennes à la politique. Les recherches et les programmes éducatifs de Samara permettent de jeter une lumière nouvelle sur le système démocratique canadien et encouragent une plus grande participation politique partout au pays, afin de construire une meilleure politique et un meilleur Canada, pour tout le monde.\n\nMichael est cofondateur et copropriétaire de Closson Chase Vineyards and Winery dans le comté de Prince Edward, en Ontario. Fondée en 1998, Closson Chase produit des chardonnays, des pinots noirs et des pinots gris.\n\nMembre de l’Ordre du Canada, Michael est depuis longtemps bénévole pour de nombreux organismes du secteur communautaire et de l’industrie. Il est agrégé supérieur du Collège Massey et co-auteur de l’ouvrage à succès Tragedy in the Commons.\n\nEmmy-nominee Lamar Johnson was recently nominated for his role as ‘Henry Burrell’ on HBO’s Emmy-nominated series The Last of Us opposite Pedro Pascal.\n\nThe Canadian actor, director, model and artist also recently played the lead in the TIFF award-winning film Brother, which earned him a Canadian Screen Award for ‘Best Performance in a Leading Role’ after premiering at TIFF in 2022. The coming-of-age Canadian hip-hop drama hit theaters and on-demand on August 4th and is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nKnown for his work on the Showtime limited series Your Honor with Bryan Cranston, Lamar was previously named one of TIFF’s Rising Stars for his role in the Fox film The Hate U Give opposite Amandla Stenberg, based on the New York Times best-selling novel of the same. Previous credits also include HBO/A24’s Native Son opposite Ashton Sanders; Netflix’s All The Bright Places opposite Elle Fanning and Justice Smith; his feature debut in Kings, directed by Oscar-nominated director Deniz Gamze Ergüven, starring opposite Halle Berry and Daniel Craig; as well as starring in Dark Phoenix opposite Sophie Turner, the final installment of the film series based off Marvel Comics’ popular \"X-Men\" franchise.\"\n\nPaul Thomas Workman launched his life in journalism when he was eight, maybe ten. It was so long ago he can’t remember exactly, except that John F. Kennedy was running for president. He created and sold a mimeographed newspaper up and down the main street in his home village of Arthur, Ontario. Five cents a copy. The proceeds went to bottles of cream soda. And with that, a celebrated career in Canadian journalism was off and running, or at least a long career. He studied journalism at Ryerson, now Toronto Metropolitan University, worked for the Ottawa Citizen, moving on to CBC News as National Reporter in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Quebec. He spent the next 33 years as a foreign correspondent for CBC and CTV, managing to extend an initial bureau chief job in the Middle East into a string of appointments from Jerusalem to Paris to New Delhi, to Washington, to London. He covered the first Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the second Gulf War, the war in Kosovo, the death of the Princess of Wales, the wars in Afghanistan and Ukraine. He is currently unemployed and looking for work.\n\nJane Goodall’s Reasons for Hope is a large format film based on Dr. Jane Goodall’s philosophy of hope for the world. The film is structured around Jane’s 4 main pillars of hope: the energy and dedication of young people, the extraordinary human brain, the resilience of nature, and the indomitable human spirit. Jane Goodall Reasons for Hope is about sustainability and inspiring action. It’s about the incredible resiliency and creativity of people around the world taking action to collectively make a difference. An important part of this project was that Science North was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment during the film production and work towards a net zero film by implementing a number of best practices. The projected carbon footprint of the production was measured before production started without knowing how successful we would be with the implementation of actions and had a projected CO2e footprint of 261.56 tonnes. After the implementation of actions and with the full support of team members and partners such as Rivian the carbon footprint was reduced by more than half to an actual CO2e of 100.46 tonnes.\n\nJeff was born on the Mi’gmaq reserve of Listujug, Quebec. His uncompromising films paint a stark and scathing portrait of post-colonial Indigenous life and culture. He used magic realism, body horror, and sci-fi to pioneer what's now known as Indigenous Futurism. His short films included From Cherry English, The Colony, File Under Miscellaneous and Etlinisigu'niet (Bleed Down). His debut feature film Rhymes for Young Ghouls was a revenge thriller set against the backdrop of the intergenerational trauma caused by Canada's Residential School system and associated genocidal policies. Blood Quantum, his sophomore feature, was a blood splattered zombie film whose Indigenous heroes were immune to the zombie plague. A pioneer of contemporary Indigenous cinema, his fearless storytelling and vision continue to inspire a new generation of filmmakers.\n\nMarilyn Denis is one of the most fun-loving people in broadcasting. In 2023, Marilyn announced she would bid adieu as host of the popular Canadian Screen Award-winning series The Marilyn Denis Show, following 13 incredible seasons and a 34-year career of daily daytime television. Throughout her years on television, Canada’s Queen of Daytime always placed her fans at the center of it all, as she provided a unique blend of entertainment and topical lifestyle information to viewers across the country weekday mornings. Formerly co-host of Roger & Marilyn, the veteran radio broadcaster now hosts Marilyn Denis and Jamar, weekday mornings on Toronto’s #1-ranked radio station CHUM 104.5. Marilyn continues to bring her iconic entertainment and lifestyle interviews to listeners on Marilyn Denis Does a Podcast, which is available on the iHeartRadio app and everywhere podcasts are found.\n\nNamed one of the 2024 100 most influential Black Canadians for the third year in a row, Tonya Williams is an award-winning actress, producer and advocate who has worked for the last 48 years in Canada and the US. Frustrated by the lack of racial diversity on Canadian screens, Tonya founded Reelworld in 2000, advancing opportunities for Black, Indigenous, Asian, South Asian, and People of Colour. Reelworld Screen Institute has expanded to include training programs, the film festival, a summit, and a hiring platform: AccessReelworld.ca. Tonya has been instrumental in creating systemic change in the Canadian screen industry and sits on a number of government groups working to create more access, programs, and funding for equity deserving groups.\n\nActor, comedian, director, author, host, stage director, and producer, Patrick Huard, has a career boasting over 30 years and is among the most esteemed and beloved figures in the Quebec public eye.

It was so long ago he can’t remember exactly, except that John F. Kennedy was running for president.

He spent the next 33 years as a foreign correspondent for CBC and CTV, managing to extend an initial bureau chief job in the Middle East into a string of appointments from Jerusalem to Paris to New Delhi, to Washington, to London.

The film is structured around Jane’s 4 main pillars of hope: the energy and dedication of young people, the extraordinary human brain, the resilience of nature, and the indomitable human spirit. Jane Goodall Reasons for Hope is about sustainability and inspiring action. It’s about the incredible resiliency and creativity of people around the world taking action to collectively make a difference. An important part of this project was that Science North was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment during the film production and work towards a net zero film by implementing a number of best practices. The projected carbon footprint of the production was measured before production started without knowing how successful we would be with the implementation of actions and had a projected CO2e footprint of 261.56 tonnes. After the implementation of actions and with the full support of team members and partners such as Rivian the carbon footprint was reduced by more than half to an actual CO2e of 100.46 tonnes.\n\nJeff was born on the Mi’gmaq reserve of Listujug, Quebec.

His short films included From Cherry English, The Colony, File Under Miscellaneous and Etlinisigu'niet (Bleed Down). His debut feature film Rhymes for Young Ghouls was a revenge thriller set against the backdrop of the intergenerational trauma caused by Canada's Residential School system and associated genocidal policies.
