        "text": "April Verch Band to play at Luna in De Pere\n\nFiddlers and dancers alike will be able to sit in slack-jawed wonder in De Pere Oct. 9 when international performer April Verch and her band take the stage at Luna Coffee and Roastery.\n\nVerch, 36, brings the music of her native Ottawa Valley (eastern Ontario) with her. She describes the music as being high-energy, happy tunes, “with driving rhythm, meant for dancing.” Like most eastern Canadian fiddle music, it’s influenced by Scottish and Irish music, but there’s also a lot of French influence, she told Press-Gazette Media.\n\nThat’s the music of her heritage, but Verch’s award-winning fiddle-playing covers regional fiddle styles from all over Canada and the U.S., including Cape Breton, French-Canadian, American bluegrass and Appalachian old-time and even Texas swing.\n\nOn top of that, Verch has been a step-dancer in the Ottawa Valley tradition since she was a toddler. The dance style, a distant relative of Irish hard-shoe step-dancing, also has clogging and tap-dancing influences.\n\n“The Ottawa Valley style is based on the tiptoes, with more hopping, while some of the others, the other step-dancing and clogging, is more flat, more rooted to the ground,” Verch said. Unlike modern Irish step-dancing, the Ottawa Valley style doesn’t require the dancer to keep his or her arms stiff to the sides.\n\nIt’s a complex, flamboyant, percussive style of dancing, made all the more impressive when Verch does it at the same time she fiddles. The rhythm of the fiddle tune often pulls one way while that of the dance pulls the other, but Verch keeps it all in sync by “putting everything on autopilot. I don’t think while I’m doing it,” she said.\n\nThe Thursday night show in De Pere will in no way be a dull dissertation on music and dance from a remote region of Canada, Verch promised. You’re just as likely to hear several familiar bluegrass chestnuts as well as the April Verch Band take on country standards by Hank Williams and Loretta Lynn.\n\nVerch’s band mates, Cody Walters and Hayes Griffin, bring a litany of musical interests and experiences as wide as Verch’s. Walters, the trio’s bass player, also plays claw hammer banjo in the American mountain style. A Kansas native now living in North Carolina, Walters has been in bands playing everything from Latin jazz to bluegrass. On Thursday, you’ll definitely hear some slap bass, which in no way is part of the Ottawa Valley tradition, Verch said.\n\nGuitarist Griffin, an Ohio native, grew up on bluegrass music and has won numerous flatpicking contests in that genre, but he has also acquired a master’s degree in jazz improv from the New England Conservatory, so he moves comfortably in a variety of musical genres.\n\nThe combination means a blend of traditional and non-traditional styles for an overall sound unique to the April Verch Band.\n\nAll three sing, so there’ll be solos, duets and trios in the show, and all three write songs and tunes both in and outside the traditional styles.\n\n— psrubas@pressgazettemedia.com and follow him on Twitter@PGpaulsrubas.\n\nDO IT\n\nWho: April Verch Band\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 9\n\nWhere: Luna Coffee and Roaster, 330 Main Ave., De Pere"
