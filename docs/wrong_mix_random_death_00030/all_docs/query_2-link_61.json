Thus, all contests heard on the internet are delayed. This delay can last for as much as 30 seconds or more. This means that when 96.9 Country Legends contests are played that require a specific caller to telephone the radio station (such as “Caller number 9 when you hear the sound effect”), listeners to the on-line audio stream may be at a disadvantage in participating over those listeners who hear the contests on-air.\n\nA copy of these rules is available during business hours at the 96.9 Country Legends studios 1820 Heritage Center Way Harrisonburg, VA 22801\n\nUpdated March 6, 2023"
