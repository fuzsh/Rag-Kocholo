In addition to variety-style musical performances, each episode also discussed important themes and messages targeted to youth on issues of social responsibility, community service and the belief in ones self. \"D'Arcy's Beat\" won the \"Can-Pro Award\" from the Canadian Television Programming Association in 2001.\n\nMovies\n\nIn addition to countless appearances on TV and radio, as an actor Dominic has played the part of the singing sheriff (Higgins) in an unreleased movie starring Dolly Parton titled \"The Wishing Well\" (2000) and he appeared in the TV movie \"The Perfect Neighbor\" (2005) starring Barbara Niven and Perry King.

This video is intended to serve as a recommended curriculum for anti-drug programs aimed at school-aged children. Dominic hopes to bring this project to the forefront again as his performance schedule permits."
