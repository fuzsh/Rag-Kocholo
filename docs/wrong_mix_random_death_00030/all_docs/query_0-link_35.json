        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Country superstar Reba McEntire and duo Brooks & Dunn, fresh off a Las Vegas residency, are headed back to the Country Music Association Awards stage for the first time in seven years.\n\nThe three longtime friends and collaborators last performed on the show in 2008, singing “Cowgirls Don’t Cry,” and Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn retired as a duo the following year. But they have reunited for a series of shows with McEntire at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.\n\nPreviously announced collaborations on the awards show, which airs Nov. 4 on ABC (8 p.m. Eastern), include Keith Urban and rocker John Mellencamp, Fall Out Boy and Thomas Rhett, Dierks Bentley and violinist Lindsey Stirling. Eric Church and Hank Williams Jr. will open the show."
