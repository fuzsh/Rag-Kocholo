        "text": "WINNER\n\nNuclear Family\n\nby Jean Van Loon\n\nMcGill-Queen's University Press\n\nJean Van Loon’s father was a metallurgist in an Ottawa lab that contributed to the Manhattan Project. Unbeknownst even to the family, her mother worked for Canada’s Cold War intelligence service. Rooted in memory and history, Nuclear Family carries the reader into the sense of impending nuclear doom and the material wealth that shaped the poet’s childhood.\n\nJean Van Loon is an Ottawa-based writer of fiction and poetry, whose first poetry collection, Building on River, was a finalist for the Ottawa Book Award.\n\nJury Statement for Nuclear Family:\n\nJean Van Loon shapes a poem with scientific precision. This cohesive collection explores the half-life of familial love set against the unimagined consequences of our species’ nuclear achievements. Heart-rending and thought-provoking, Nuclear Family asks us all what we can learn from the wrong end of time.\n\nSuzanna Hall, Her Book\n\nby Jennifer Falkner\n\nFish Gotta Swim Editions\n\nSusanna Hall, Her Book is set over three days in the height of the English Civil War, during which the Queen of England seeks shelter in the house of Shakespeare's eldest daughter.\n\nJennifer Falkner (she/her) is a fiction writer living in Ottawa, Canada, on the traditional, unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe First Nation.\n\nlisan al’asfour\n\nby Natalie Hanna\n\nArbeiter Ring Publishing\n\nBeginning, and ending, with moving invocations for acceptance, lisan al’asfour (bird’s tongue), introduces a personal concept of creation around loss, confirming identity, and matrilineal questions of the child of a single mother forced to immigrate to Canada from Egypt in the 1970s. These poems speak to coming back into softness and strength despite the sorrow and pressure of trauma.\n\nNatalie Hanna is a queer Ottawa lawyer of Middle-Eastern descent, working with low-income populations. Her writing focuses on feminist, political, and personal relational themes. She previously served as Administrative Director of the Sawdust Reading Series (Ottawa) and board member of Arc Poetry Magazine.

Charlotte, daughter of the Habsburg Empress, arrives in Naples to marry a man she has never met.

When they were children, they discovered a book of spells, with dark and unpredictable consequences.\n\nKate Heartfield is the author of the historical fantasy novel The Embroidered Book. Her novels, novellas, stories and games have won or been shortlisted for multiple awards. Kate is the former opinion editor of The Ottawa Citizen.

A graduate of Memorial University’s Creative Writing Master’s program, he has published work in Riddle Fence and the Telegram.\n\nWINNER\n\nCapharnaüm\n\nby Nancy Vickers\n\nÉditions David\n\nElsa is a compulsive collector with a passion for spiders. From childhood until her death, she accumulates all kinds of found, bought or even custom-made objects, which end up cluttering her house to the point where it becomes unhealthy. Her mania damages all her personal relationships and leads her to the worst insanities.\n\nBorn in Saguenay in 1946, Nancy Vickers lived in Ottawa for 40 years. Her novels, short stories and tales are written for young people and adults. In addition to her fourteen award-winning books, she has contributed to several magazines and collective works.\n\nJury Statement for Capharnaüm:\n\nThere’s an old Arab proverb to the effect that entering a hammam is not the same as leaving it. The aphorism applies perfectly to Capharnaüm, as its pages are delightfully crammed with sparkling and flowing prose, supported by a myriad of characters, most of them women, each as unique as the next. And for good reason, since the novel deals with the sordid world of hoarding disorder, an obsession that consists in accumulating objects and/or animals because they cannot disappoint or hurt us. In short, Capharnaüm is a powerful book that stays with you long after you’ve finished reading it.\n\ndire\n\nby Andrée Lacelle\n\nÉditions Prise de parole\n\nIn this three-part poetry collection, Andrée Lacelle reflects on 40 years of writing practice, opening a window on the workshop where her unprecedented works were crafted.

This moving novel is inspired by current hot topics: mental health, systemic racism, police violence, homosexuality and bullying.\n\nClaudia Lahaie spent several years living around the world, in New York, London, Singapore and Cameroon. Her community work is mostly focused on inclusion. Her passion for working with teenagers inspired her first novel, Les voies du slam.\n\nFeux du naufrage\n\nby Gilles Latour\n\nLes Éditions L’Interligne\n\nFeux du naufrage is a poet’s ravenous hunt and endless pursuit, with a disquieting, poignant and visionary authenticity: the reader is witness to the origins of an intuitive apprehension that unfolds in spiralling phrasing.\n\nBorn in Cornwall, Gilles Latour was raised in Ottawa, studied literature in Montreal, and travelled the world working for humanitarian organizations for a living—yet, wherever he goes, his main trade is poetry. He lives in Ottawa, where five of his collections have been published by Les Éditions L’Interligne.\n\nWINNER\n\nLifesavers and Body Snatchers: Medical Care and the Struggle for Survival in the Great War\n\nby Tim Cook\n\nPenguin Random House Canada\n\nFrom Canada’s top war historian, a definitive medical history of the Great War, illuminating how the carnage of modern battle gave birth to revolutionary life-saving innovations.

This history of the Great War is not only a story of sacrifice and carnage but also one of innovation, both in the technology of warfare and the medical technology that supported it and responded to the havoc war wreaked on human bodies. Above all, it is a human story, brought alive for the reader by the author’s judicious use of eye-witness accounts by everyone from military and medical officers to combatants, nurses, and stretcher-bearers.\n\nBig Men Fear Me\n\nby Mark Bourrie\n\nBiblioasis\n\nIn Big Men Fear Me, award-winning historian Mark Bourrie tells the remarkable story of media mogul George McCullagh’s inspirational rise and devastating fall, and with it sheds new light on the resurgence of populist politics, challenges to collective action, and attacks on the free press that characterize our own tumultuous era.\n\nMark Bourrie is an author, lawyer, and former journalist. He holds a master’s in Journalism from Carleton University and a PhD in History from the University of Ottawa. He has won numerous awards for his journalism, and received the RBC Charles Taylor Prize in 2020 for his book Bush Runner.\n\nHanged in Medicine Hat: Murders in a Nazi Prisoner-of-War Camp, and the Disturbing True Story of Canada's Last Mass Execution\n\nby Nathan Greenfield\n\nSutherland House Books\n\nFor three years during the Second World War, 12,000 Nazis were held in a POW camp at the edge of Medicine Hat.

The unanimous decision set a historic legal precedent that employers are responsible for maintaining a respectful and harassment-free workplace.
