        "text": "Jason Petty and his band celebrate 100 years of Hank Williams Sr. and other Country greats.\n\nASHWAUBENON, Wis. – Hank Williams is known the world over as the most influential singer/songwriter ever. Now, acclaimed performer/musician Jason Petty, along with his four-piece band, is bringing the authentic and insightful story of Hank Williams Sr. to life in Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes for a special presentation at the Ashwaubenon Performing Arts Center on Saturday, October 1, 2022 at 7:30 PM.\n\nJason Petty made a striking impression on New York’s Theatre District, starring in “Hank Williams: Lost Highway” which played for nine months to sold out audiences at the Little Shubert Theater. Audiences and critics alike were taken back by Petty’s amazing acting ability in his portrayal of Hank Williams.\n\nPetty won rave reviews from all the major critics, including the New York Times, Variety and Rolling Stone. The NY Post stated it best: “At times it seems as if Petty is not just offering an impersonation of Williams, but channeling his ghost.” Another sign of recognition for Petty’s brilliant performance of Hank Williams was being honored with an OBIE Award, the Off-Broadway Tony Award® equivalent, for Outstanding Actor.\n\nIn Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes, Petty gives audiences a personal look at Williams growing up, how he became famous, who influenced the legendary singer /songwriter, and performers today who are influenced by Williams.\n\nBacked by a four-piece band, just like Williams performed, the show is full of Hank’s hits from ‘Your Cheatin’ Heart’ and ‘I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry’, to ‘Hey Good Lookin’ and ‘Lovesick Blues’.\n\nNot only will the great songs of Hank Williams Sr. be performed, but audiences also treated to a selection of songs from some of Hank’s influences (including Jimmie Rodgers, Carter Family, Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb), and those who were influenced by Hank (including George Jones, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, Elvis Presley and Alan Jackson). “Will the Circle Be Unbroken“, “Wine Me Up” and “Midnight in Montgomery” are just a few of such selections included in the set.\n\nGoing back to the beginning when Hank Williams was given his very first guitar, all the way to how the legend made a lasting impression on popular music, Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes plays to sold-out houses across the country from Broadway to Nashville and keeps audiences clapping their hands and stomping their feet.\n\nThis Ashwaubenon Performing Arts Center tour stop is sponsored locally by Woodside Senior Communities.\n\nHOW TO GET TICKETS\n\nTickets can be purchased beginning August 31, 2022 at 10:00 AM\n\n$35 | Reserved Seating\n\nOnline: AshwaubenonPAC.org\n\nBy Phone: 920-494-3401 or 800-895-0071\n\nIn Person: Ticket Star, 1901 S Oneida Street, Ashwaubenon, WI 54304\n\n###\n\nAbout Ashwaubenon Performing Arts Center\n\nThe Ashwaubenon Performing Arts Center is a state-of-the-art, 730-seat performance venue built for the artistic and theatrical enrichment of the students and community members of the Village of Ashwaubenon and surrounding areas.
