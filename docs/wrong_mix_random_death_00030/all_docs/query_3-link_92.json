This in-person concert will sell out.\n\nPay-what-you-can. Suggested donation $25\n\nThis Chicago-based trio is a vintage-inspired pop rock powerhouse whose songs feature tight harmonies, inventive arrangements, and poignant lyrics. Audiences are amazed at the sound produced by just three guys. Veterans of the stage, their live show engages and entertains with a sense of humor, spectacle, and spontaneity.\n\nZachary Stevenson, Shaun Whitley, and Kieran McCabe banded together in 2018 toeproduce the music and magic of Buddy Holly and the Crickets in our production of Buddy: the Buddy Holly Story. After nearly 100 sell-out performances, the show went on to win 5 Joseph Jefferson Awards including Musical, Ensemble, and Lead Performance.\n\nWhen the production closed, the partnership of these three “Crickets” evolved into an original band that they named The Oh Boys in tribute the Crickets’ song. Their debut EP, “Listen to the Oh Boys” was released on all streaming platforms May 6th, 2023 and is now available on Bandcamp.\n\nZACHARY STEVENSON he/him (performer) is a proud Ensemble member at American Blues Theater. He is an award-winning actor, musician and writer. Originally from Vancouver Island, Canada, Zachary has been coined a “dead ringer for dead singers” by the Victoria Times Colonist for his portrayals of Buddy Holly, Hank Williams, Phil Ochs, and roles based on Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. In 2018, Zachary won the Jeff Award in Chicago for Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Musical) for the Buddy Holly Story, a role he’s honed in more than a dozen productions of across Canada and the United States. Other acting highlights include Hair, Urinetown, Assassins, and Company. Zachary has produced and recorded five independent albums and tours frequency as a musician. He’s been featured as an original artist at countless festivals including the Ottawa Folk Fest, Blue Skies Festival, Summerfolk, Winterfolk (Toronto), Folk Alliance (Memphis, Ottawa and Kansas City), and the Ottawa Blues Festival. He shares a Toronto Virgin Radio songwriting award with songwriting partner, Jeff Bryant, for their song “The Man on Radio”. Zachary is also active as a music director on productions such as Ring of Fire and Million Dollar Quartet. He is currently writing a new one-man show based on the life of folksinger, Phil Ochs entitled Louder Than the Guns.\n\nSHAUN WHITLEY he/him (performer) is an actor, musician (guitar, bass, violin, piano, mandolin), composer, and Jeff-nominated music director in Chicago who has worked with Chicago Shakespeare, Marriott Lincolnshire, Drury Lane – Oakbrook, American Blues, and TUTA, to name a few. At the Chicago’s Apollo Theater, he performed as Carl Perkins in Chicago’s longest running Broadway musical, Million Dollar Quartet. He plays bass and sings with Chicago-based ragtime/rock (sometimes a-billy)/barbershop trio band, The Oh Boys. During the morning hours you can find him sharing music with his kids in my program, Sing Out! with Mr Shaun, at preschools in Chicagoland. He has a beautiful wife and two lovely children who make everyday an adventure."
