        "text": "The Welch Memorial Lecture was established in 1951 to honour Mr. Herbert M. Welch, one of the pioneer members of the association. Mr. Welch was also president of the association from 1949 to 1950.\n\nTo be chosen to deliver this lecture is considered an honor, which is bestowed upon a member of the CAMRT who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession at a national level. The recipient must have influenced the growth of the profession in clinical practice, education, research, and/or administration. The Welch Memorial Lecture may be on the lecturerâ€™s topic of choice. Given that it is the focal point of the Annual General Conference, it is expected that the lecture will reflect the vision and values of the association. The lecture should reflect the outstanding contribution and experience demonstrated by the recipient of this award."
