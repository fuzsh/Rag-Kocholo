        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nBy Haley Mitchell Gowin\n\nThe inaugural Hank Williams Sr. Talent Showcase was held May 6, at the historic Georgiana Opry House.\n\nAfter a thrilling live performance, 20-year-old Emory Berrey of Arab emerged as the winner, impressing the judges with her original song, “It is Finished” which she wrote when going through some battles of her own.\n\n“The song is about what Jesus has already provided to all that believe, and I truly think that His will for us is to be whole and healthy,” Berrey said. “In 2021, the day I released my first song, I lost my ability to sing and it lasted for several months. During my pleading for God to heal me, I kept feeling like I was hearing Him say, ‘You are healed.’ I didn’t understand for a while what that meant since I still had pain. What He meant was healing was available for me in the spirit realm. I just had to reach in my faith and take hold of it.”\n\nTracy Eason, managing owner of the Opry House, musician, and former drummer for the Robbin McCombs and the Aces and Eights band, said the competition gave aspiring young singers between the ages of 16 and 21, the opportunity to showcase their talent and receive some valuable direction.\n\n“We wanted to recognize local talent, give them some exposure and get the word out there about the opry house being open as a cultural environment for the enjoyment of our rural area,” Eason said. “I grew up in Atlanta where I had plenty of opportunities and the chance to experience various cultures. I want the youth here to have these kinds of opportunities.”\n\nEason said Georgiana, Williams’s boyhood home, is a special place, and energy was high in the nearly packed house. The age range for the contest chosen was in honor of Williams’s first performance at the same venue when he was only 16.\n\nThe top six contestants received vocal coaching and were hands-on for much of the production planning where they learned about all aspects of putting a show together.\n\nFor the first round, contestants submitted a video of themselves singing. The judges then chose six acts to move on to the second stage of the competition which was the live performance in front of the judges May 6.\n\nBerrey received a cash prize of $2,500 and a recording session with Leon Everette at The Tool Shed Recording Studio in Ward, South Carolina.\n\nThe second prize went to Brody Cartwright and Joseph Ealum (The BroJoBand) from Greenville who received $1,250.00. The band will perform at the 44th Annual Hank Williams Festival June 3. The BroJoBand used part of their prize money to purchase new equipment..\n\n“My partner Brody and I took a good chuck of our winnings and put it toward a nice PA system and microphones,” Ealum said. “Recently we played a gig with our own equipment for the very first time. We are thankful for the prize money and know it will help open up some opportunities for us.”\n\nThird prize went to Judith “Jude” Oswald from Georgiana who received a brand-new Martin X Series acoustic/electric guitar.\n\n“I’m a beginner with the guitar and I’m very glad to have a nice one to learn with,” Oswald said. “I’m fully self-taught with the ukulele and piano and hopefully I’ll be able to say the same with the guitar. This has been such a wonderful experience because I’ve made some great new friends with similar interests in music, I’ve been able to work on my vocal abilities and stage presence, and it has fueled the flame that is my passion for music. I’m already writing my song for next year’s competition!”\n\nJudges included renowned steel guitar player Lynn Owsley who played with Ernest Tubb and the Texas Troubadours, Lisa Zanghi, who played with Doug Stone and is a current member of the band LA Players, and Jim Vest, CEO of VEST music group out of Nashville, musician, producer, actor, songwriter, publisher, singer, and lead steel guitar player of the world famous “Nashville Cats”.\n\nBerrey said she is thankful for the experience and encourages local young artists to sign up for next year’s competition.\n\n“The entire experience was amazing,” Berrey said. “Each singer was so talented and nice. Ms. Tracy is awesome and put so much hard work into planning the showcase. Thank you to everyone who helped and all glory goes to my Heavenly Father for this opportunity. I am so blessed to be able to record two songs for my album with Leon Everette and I should be finishing up my first-ever Contemporary Christian Album this year, the good Lord willing. We were treated like stars with a limo ride, personalized dressing rooms, lots of freebies and more.”\n\nRegistration and a link to vocal video submission auditions for the second annual event will open June 1, 2023.
