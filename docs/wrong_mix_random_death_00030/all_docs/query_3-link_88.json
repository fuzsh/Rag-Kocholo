        "text": "Heritage Woods resident Juanita Aldridge celebrated her 100th birthday Thursday listening to a musical performance, but she said she’s spent most of her life playing it.\n\n“I started playing the piano and the organ by ear,” said Aldridge, who lives at the Ottawa senior living facility. “My sister and I used to go from church to church and sing and play.”\n\nHeritage Woods hosted a birthday celebration in Aldridge’s honor Thursday, which included a musical performance by Rich Selquist and a presentation of the key to the city to Aldridge from the Ottawa mayor’s office.\n\nAldridge said she discovered she could play without the need of sheet music by just sitting down and playing it.\n\n“I never needed a book,” Aldridge said. “I just play whatever comes to mind when I sit down. Something always will.”\n\nAldridge began playing using a pump organ, the kind of organ that requires it’s player to use their feet along with their hands, before graduating to a pipe organ like is typically found in churches.\n\nShe said she can’t pick a favorite song because every time she tries to, she thinks of another.\n\n“It’s one of those things where whenever I think I pick a favorite, I remember another song I love and then I feel bad about it,” Aldridge said.\n\nAldridge said she’s had fun her entire life and she owes it to clean living: She’s never been a drinker or anything of the sort. She’s always been able to have fun without it, whether she was living in Southern Illinois, where she’s from, or in Ottawa, where she moved to in her later years."
