        "text": "Luke Bryan first moved to Nashville in the early 2000s, after graduating college.\n\nNot long after, Bryan became a member of a Music City publishing house. Among his first cuts was the title track of Travis Tritt's 2004 album, My Honky Tonk History. It wasn't long before he was signed as an artist himself — under the Capitol Music umbrella, Bryan scored another songwriting credit, co-writing Billy Currington's, \"Good Directions.\"\n\nIn 2007, he stepped into the spotlight with his first-ever single, \"All My Friends Say.\" He hasn't stopped gyrating since!\n\nBryan's name is on seven studio albums, seven compilation albums, eight EPs and more than 30 country radio singles. A whopping 20 of them have hit No. 1. As a now-megastar, Bryan has countless awards and accolades and has become a household name thanks to his prime-time spot as a judge on American Idol.\n\nLet's take a ride in the time machine and look back at 34 pictures of a much younger Luke Bryan."
