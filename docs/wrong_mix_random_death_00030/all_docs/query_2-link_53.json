        "text": "Hank Williams, the country pioneer who is among the most influential singer-songwriters in music, was given a special Pulitzer Prize citation.\n\nThe Pulitzer board awarded the late singer for his lifetime achievement, based on a confidential survey of experts in popular music.\n\n\"I don't think any country artist cast a longer shadow than he does, both as a songwriter and a performer,\" Jay Orr, vice president of museum programs at the Country Music Hall of Fame, said Monday. (A Williams family exhibit runs at the Hall of Fame through 2011.)\n\n\"His songs are master works. But there's a mystique about his character that still fascinates the people who have come after him. ... He was the romantic ideal of the hillbilly Shakespeare and his cultural legacy continues to grow.\"\n\nThe citation notes Williams' \"craftsmanship as a songwriter\" and his \"pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\" He joins other recent special citation recipients Bob Dylan, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane on a short list of American masters.\n\nWilliams died on January 1, 1953, at the age of 29, cutting short a career that forever changed American popular music. Hits such as Your Cheatin' Heart, Cold Cold Heart and I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry have been covered by hundreds of musicians across several genres.\n\nMore than 55 years after his death, he remains a central figure in country music.\n\nOrr noted that musicians as diverse as George Jones, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett and Beck have plumbed the rich vein of Williams' music over the years. Williams' descendants - children, Hank Jr. and Jett, and grandchildren, Hank III, Holly and Hilary - continue to add to his legacy.\n\nBorn in Alabama, he grew up during the Depression, dreaming of playing country music. His first big break came when music publisher Fred Rose offered him the chance to record his own songs. His first release for MGM Records, Move It on Over, was a hit in 1947 and he went on to record 11 No 1 songs.\n\nOrr said Williams took his \"honky tonk confessionals,\" to working-class people who identified with Williams' honesty.\n\n\"He really helped to legitimise that confessional mode with songs like Cold Cold Heart - 'Why can't I free your doubtful mind/and melt your cold cold heart?\"' Orr said.\n\n\"That's something we've all wondered about a woman at one time or another.\""
