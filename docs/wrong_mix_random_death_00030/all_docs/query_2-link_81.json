        "text": "Hank Williams is known the world over as the most influential singer/songwriter ever. Now, acclaimed performer and musician Jason Petty, along with his four-piece band, is bringing the authentic and insightful story of Hank Williams Sr. to life in Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes.\n\nJason Petty made a striking impression on New York’s Theatre District, starring in “Hank Williams: Lost Highway” which played for nine months to sold out audiences at the Little Shubert Theater. Audiences and critics alike were taken aback by Petty’s amazing acting ability in his portrayal of Hank Williams, ultimately honoring Petty with an OBIE Award (Off Broadway’s Tony Award equivalent) for “Outstanding Actor”.\n\nIn Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes, Petty gives audiences a personal look at Williams growing up, how he became famous, who influenced the legendary singer /songwriter, and performers today who are influenced by Williams.\n\nBacked by a four-piece band, just like Williams performed, the show is chock full of Hank’s hits from ‘Your Cheatin’ Heart‘ and ‘I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry‘, to ‘Hey Good Lookin‘ and ‘Lovesick Blues‘.\n\nNot only will the great songs of Hank Williams Sr. be performed but audiences will also be treated to a selection of songs from some of Hank’s influences (including Jimmie Rodgers, Carter Family, Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb), and those who were influenced by Hank (including George Jones, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, Elvis Presley, and Alan Jackson). “Will the Circle Be Unbroken“, Wine Me Up” and “Midnight in Montgomery” are just a few of such selections included in the set.\n\nGoing back to the beginning when Hank Williams was given his very first guitar, all the way to how the legend made a lasting impression on popular music, “Hank and My Honky Tonk Heroes” plays to sold-out houses across the country from Broadway to Nashville and keeps audiences clapping their hands and stomping their feet."
