        "text": "Hank Williams set many a music-biz template. He was a “rollin’ stone” before Mick Jagger, and a guitar rogue before Keith Richards. A singer/songwriter before Bob Dylan. A successful talent who couldn’t get out of his own way before (INSERT FAMOUSLY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MUSICIAN OF YOUR CHOICE HERE). Williams was even down with OPP before Naughty By Nature was.\n\nMost of all though, Williams set the template for country star. “Back then the music was called “Country & Western.“) Now, 70 years later, country artists still haven’t surpassed the brilliance in Williams’ landmark recordings.\n\nThe Alabama native wrote songs that connected with listeners in a way few artists do, about feelings and urges that bind us all: love, heartbreak, and wanting to have a good time. A great song hits hardest with a great singer singing it, and Williams possessed a stirring singing voice. It goes straight to your soul.\n\nBetween scoring his first big hit in 1947 “Move It On Over,” and dying in 1953 at age 29 in the backseat of a Cadillac on the way to a Canton, Ohio gig, Williams released no less than 30 top 10 country singles. Another five came posthumously. He was later inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. They eventually even gave him a Pulitzer Prize, too.\n\nBorn Hiram Williams in Mount Olive, Hank also resided in Montgomery, Mobile, Greenville and Georgiana, Alabama during his lifetime, as well as Nashville. Sept. 17, 2023 will mark the 100th anniversary of Williams’ birthday. In honor of that milestone, AL.com put together a list of the top 10 Hank Williams songs. Your list might be wildly different, which shouldn’t be a surprise given all the great Hank songs to pick from.\n\n[RELATED: Hank Williams at 100: Tip your hat to the country icon by visiting these sites in Alabama]\n\n10. “Honky Tonkin’”\n\nReleased: 1947/1948\n\nWritten by: Hank Williams\n\nWilliams recorded proto-party-anthem “Honky Tonkin’” twice.
