        "text": "Country fans know Ingrid Andress for her hit song “More Hearts Than Mine,\" but her introduction to a more varied audience at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby makes her memorable for other reasons.\n\nAndress had the honor of singing the National Anthem on Monday night (July 15), and it didn't go well. She seemed off — as she entered into the first verse, it quickly went downhill as her normally on-tune pitch was greatly off.\n\nAndress is a seasoned singer and performer, but Monday night was notably not her best, as Twitter and the rest of the internet recognized.\n\nThis performance was her first major event since going dark about a year ago. She was taking time away to really discover who she is, she shared with fans, and work on herself, highlighting an intoxicating culture that the entertainment industry can be.\n\nPrior to her performance at the MLB game, a message to fans went into more detail about what's been going on in her personal life.\n\n“I’ve been absent for a minute,” she explains. “I had to part ways with some people who’ve helped me make a name for myself. It sent me into what country American call 'depression,' but I’m not a doctor. It was the lowest point I‘ve even been.”\n\nThe singer has a new single, \"Colorado 9,\" coming on July 24, and just recently resurfaced to social media to promote it after wiping her Instagram clean earlier this year.\n\nAndress had not commented on her National Anthem performance at press time."
