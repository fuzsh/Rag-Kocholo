        "text": "Presented annually by OTA to celebrities that champion the men and\n\nwomen serving in the American Armed Forces, the southern rock and\n\ncountry legend was awarded the Eagle Trophy for his countless endeavors\n\nto support troops overseas and at local hospitals and for supporting\n\nnumerous military charities. Well known for his role as an American\n\nPatriot, Williams, has performed at various military bases and continues\n\nto meet military personnel at every concert appearance.\n\n“I am extremely honored to award Hank Williams Jr the 2013 Patriot\n\nAward. His art, legacy of family and Spirit of Patriotism is exactly\n\nwhy this award exists. He never forgot his roots and why we have the\n\nFreedom we do in America,” says OTA founder and executive director Mark\n\nWoods.\n\nWilliams will join past Patriot Award recipients Toby Keith, Darryl\n\nWorley, Aaron Tippin, Gary Sinise, Charlie Daniels, Mark Wills, and\n\nKISS.\n\nAbout Hank Williams Jr.\n\nThough he began his career in the shadow of his legendary father,\n\nHank Williams Jr. emerged as a formidable Country singer-songwriter in\n\nhis own right with 1960s hits such as “It’s All Over But The Crying” and\n\n“Cajun Baby.” But things changed with the 1979 release of “Family\n\nTradition,” where he broke the Nashville mainstream by adopting a rebel\n\nimage and writing/recording in a style incorporating his Blues and\n\nSouthern Rock influences. The results were staggering as 42 Top-10 hits\n\nfollowed, two CMA Entertainer of the Year honors, three ACM Entertainer\n\nof the Year honors, multiple Grammy nominations and a Grammy award for\n\n“There’s a Tear in My Beer”, a duet with his father using electronic\n\nmerging technology.\n\nAs groundbreaking as Hank Williams Jr. became, it wasn’t just his\n\nperformance that people took note about, but rather his songwriting that\n\nbecame so notable. The driven musician penned hits songs year after\n\nyear scoring 20 BMI Awards. One of the arguably most-heard Country song\n\nof modern times, the four-time Emmy award-winning “Are You Ready For\n\nSome Football?,” which was heard nationally as the theme song of ABC and\n\nESPN’s Monday Night Football telecasts, was aired for 21 years."
