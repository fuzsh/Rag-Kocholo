        "text": "The G. de B. Robinson Award was inaugurated to recognize the publication of excellent papers in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics (CJM) and the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin (CMB) and to encourage the submission of the highest quality papers to these journals.\n\nThe first award was presented for papers that appeared in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics in 1994-1995.\n\nIn even years, the last two complete volumes of the CJM will be under consideration and, in odd years, the last two complete volumes of the CMB. The Editors-in-Chief for the journal under consideration nominate papers from the respective two volumes. The Selection Jury consists of the Associate Editors of the CJM and CMB. A member of the CMS Publications Committee shall be appointed as the non-voting Chair of the Jury. The jurors exercise their own mathematical judgement in distributing their votes. Some of the characteristics which they may consider are; clarity, elegance, conciseness, depth and difficulty, and potential impact."
