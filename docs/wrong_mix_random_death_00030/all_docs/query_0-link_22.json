        "text": "Albert received his first guitar at the age of 11\n\nAward winning Country singer and song writer, Albert Bernicky from Ottawa, Ontario, has been influenced by some of Country’s legends as he was raised listening to the music of Johnny Cash, George Jones, Conway Twitty and Hank Williams. He received his first guitar at the age of 11 and went on to write his first song by the time he was 12 years old. It was a French song entitled, “Oui Mama” which he dedicated to his mother.\n\nIn 2011 Albert wrote and sung his first hit single “We’re Gonna Make It”. Within two weeks of being registered in the U.S., the song charted the Top 20 Country New Releases according to Weekly Radio and Musicregistry.com\n\nThe song reached number one on KILT FM 100.3 Houston, Texas, Outlaw Country and Highway Country Live 365 internet radio.\n\nCanadian Soldier was written in 2012\n\nCanadian Soldier was written in 2012, in part, as a tribute to his military lineage. His mother was the youngest of 17 children with two of his uncles serving in World War II. As well, his stepfather served in the Korean War. Albert wrote Canadian Soldier in honour of them and all Veterans and Troops past and present who fought, and will keep fighting, to save the land we love. Many of them gave the ultimate sacrifice as they died for their country.\n\nMany of them gave the ultimate sacrifice as they died for their country\n\nAlbert made a music video of this song and was later contacted by Rogers Cable 22 in Ottawa to have ‘war footage’ courtesy of the War Amps and the Department of National Defence added to his song. This edited version of the song was featured in a Remembrance Day television broadcast called “Honour and Valour.”\n\nIn addition, Albert performed a charity concert with the proceeds going to the Canadian Legion National Poppy Fund.\n\nAwards\n\nTwo of Albert’s songs have earned him North American recognition and awards. Canadian Soldier was entered in the Nashville 2012 Song & Lyrics Contest winning the Director’s Award. As well, “Jesus Christ Will Come Again” was a finalist in the American Song Writing Awards Spiritual Competition in 2016.\n\nHis next song “Fall In Love With You (All Over Again) is a ballad that was inspired by two exchanges with members of his extended family. The first one came during a reflective moment when he was visiting with his ex-in laws. His ex-sister-in-law said to her husband, “We’re getting older, will you still remember me?” His answer was, “I would just fall in love with you, all over again.”\n\nI would just fall in love with you, all over again\n\nThe second exchange happened between Albert’s aunt and uncle. After 54 years of marriage they ended up residing in a seniors’ care facility because Alzheimer’s/dementia had affected them both.\n\nAs Albert visited his relatives, he often witnessed their loving kindness toward each other. On one occasion he discovered them on the property grounds planning to elope and get married. As the disease took a hold of them, they often forgot people and their names. One evening they had wandered from their own rooms into someone else’s. Albert found them on their sides with his Uncle John’s arms wrapped around his Aunt Florence’s body. That discovery of two people – one 75 and the other 84 – still totally in love touched Albert’s heart. It reminded him of the conversation he had witnessed earlier about ‘falling in love, all over again!’"
