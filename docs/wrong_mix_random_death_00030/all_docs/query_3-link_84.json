        "text": "CARLETON PLACE – Fifteen albums under his belt, Ottawa Valley Troubadour Lyle Dillabough has passed away.\n\nThe Carleton Place singer-songwriter, producer, promoter, writer, broadcaster and humanitarian passed away with family by his side in the Ottawa Civic Hospital on Jan. 30 at the age of 61.\n\nA Carleton Place resident since 1981, Dillabough wrote and spoke often about his struggles with depression, anxiety and addiction compounded by Type 1 diabetes, which he battled for 22 years.\n\nThe troubadour was an accomplished singer and guitarist, and his style blended well with legends of the genre including Ron McMunn, Ray Materick, Valdy, Arlo Guthrie and Murray McLauchlan.\n\nDillabough produced 15 albums during his music career.\n\nIn 2011, he enticed 10-time Juno Award winner McLauchlan, to launch the Carleton Place in Concert series, a means to fundraise for the refurbishment of the auditorium at the town hall.\n\nAnother of his initiatives, the annual October Doo in the Derry in Beckwith, will be continued by the township.\n\nIn 2013, Dillabough received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. Dillabough was also a regular contributor to the Record News and other Ottawa Valley newspapers.\n\nFuneral arrangements are entrusted to Alan R. Barker Funeral Home and Chapel. A musical tribute, celebrating Dillabough’s life and legacy, will occur when circumstances permit.\n\nLyle Dillabough’s albums"
