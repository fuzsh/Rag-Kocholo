        "text": "American musician\n\nMusical artist\n\nRandall Hank Williams (born May 26, 1949), known professionally as Hank Williams Jr. or Bocephus, is an American singer-songwriter and musician. His musical style has been described as a blend of rock, blues, and country. He is the son of country musician Hank Williams and the father of musicians Holly Williams and Hank Williams III, and the grandfather of Coleman Williams. He is also the half brother of Jett Williams.\n\nWilliams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of The Ed Sullivan Show, in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on Shindig![1]\n\nAs Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the country music genre, his style began slowly to evolve. His career was interrupted by a near-fatal fall while Williams was climbing Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975.[2][3] After an extended recovery, he rebuilt his career in the country rock scene.[4] As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of musical instrument skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums.[5] In 2020, Williams Jr. was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[6]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliams was born Randall Hank Williams on May 26, 1949, in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father nicknamed him Bocephus (after Grand Ole Opry comedian Rod Brasfield's ventriloquist dummy).[7] After his father's death in 1953, he was raised by his mother, Audrey Williams.\n\nWhile he was a child, Williams was influenced by a number of contemporary musicians who visited his family and taught him various musical instruments and styles. [citation needed] Among these figures of influence were Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Fats Domino, Earl Scruggs, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.\n\nHe attended John Overton High School in Nashville, Tennessee, where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1964, Williams made his recording debut with \"Long Gone Lonesome Blues\", one of his father's many classic songs.[8]\n\nHe provided the singing voice of his father[9] in the 1964 film Your Cheatin' Heart.[10] He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.[9]\n\nA change in appearance and musical direction\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a \"Hank Williams impersonator\", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.\n\nBy the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to Alabama, in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with Southern rock musicians including Waylon Jennings, Toy Caldwell, and Charlie Daniels. Hank Williams Jr. and Friends (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.\n\nOn August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern Montana. While climbing Ajax Peak on the continental divide (Idaho border) west of Jackson, the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost 500 feet (150 m) onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.[11][12] Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' signature look.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1977, Williams recorded and released One Night Stands and The New South, and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song \"Once and For All\".[citation needed] In 1980, he appeared on the PBS show Austin City Limits during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-Dana Cooper Band.[citation needed]\n\nCountry music career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1976, Rolling Stone wrote that Williams' \"mainstream country material has always been among Nashville's best\".[13]\n\nHe was prolific throughout the 1980s, sometimes recording and releasing two albums a year. Family Tradition, Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound, Habits Old and New, Rowdy, The Pressure Is On, High Notes, Strong Stuff, Man of Steel, Major Moves, Five-O, Montana Cafe, and many others resulted in a long string of hits.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums—18 studio albums and three compilations—that were all certified at least gold by the RIAA. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No. 1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No. 1 singles, during his career.\n\nIn 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987–88, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the Academy of Country Music. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was Born to Boogie.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"Old Habits\", \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", \"Born to Boogie\", and \"My Name Is Bocephus\".\n\nThe hit single \"Wild Streak\" (1987) was co-written by Houston native Terri Sharp, for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, \"If the South Woulda Won\". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the Civil War.\n\nHis 1989 hit \"There's a Tear in My Beer\" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named Video of the Year by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.\n\nHe is well known for his hit \"A Country Boy Can Survive\" and as the performer of the theme song for Monday Night Football, based on his 1984 hit \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for Monday Night Football earned him four Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in Tom Sawyer. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit \"A Country Boy Can Survive\" after 9/11, renaming it \"America Can Survive\". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on CMT Outlaws. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.\n\nHe has also made a cameo appearance along with Larry the Cable Guy, Kid Rock, and Charlie Daniels in Gretchen Wilson's music video for the song \"All Jacked Up\". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's \"Redneck Woman\" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video \"Only God Knows Why\", and \"Redneck Paradise\".\n\nIn April 2009, Williams released a new single, \"Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues\", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album 127 Rose Avenue. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, 127 Rose Avenue was announced as his last album for Curb Records.[14]\n\nMusical style\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, Resonator guitar, piano, keyboards, saxophone, harmonica, fiddle, and drums.[5] Williams began his recording career performing covers of his father's songs. Despite catering to the country music market, Williams preferred to listen to rhythm and blues.[15] Williams also recorded singles under the name Luke the Drifter Jr.[16] (a reference to his father's alias \"Luke the Drifter\"), rock and roll singles under the aliases Rockin' Randall[17] and Bocephus[16] (a nickname given to him by his father), and blues under the name Thunderhead Hawkins.[15] Williams' music has been categorized as country rock,[4] blues rock,[18] southern rock,[19] outlaw country,[20] rockabilly[18] and rock and roll.[18]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nArtists who have cited Hank Williams Jr. as an influence include Delta Generators,[21] Walker Hayes,[22] Sam Hunt,[23] Davin James,[24] Shooter Jennings,[25] Wayne Mills,[26] The Sickstring Outlaws[27] and Gretchen Wilson.[28]\n\nOn April 10, 2006, CMT honored Williams with the Johnny Cash Visionary Award, presenting it to him at the 2006 CMT Music Awards. On November 11, 2008, Williams was honored as a BMI Icon at the 56th annual BMI Country Awards. The artists and songwriters named BMI Icons have had \"a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers\".[29]\n\nIn 2015, Williams was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. On August 12, 2020, Williams was selected to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHis daughter Katherine Williams-Dunning, the only one of his five children to not pursue a music career, died in a car crash on June 13, 2020, at age 27.[30] His son Shelton performs as Hank Williams III; his other children include Holly Williams[31] who is also a musician, as is his grandson Coleman Williams (Hank III's son), who performs under the sobriquet \"IV\".[32] His wife Mary Jane Thomas died on March 22, 2022, aged 58, after complications from a liposuction.[33][34]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliams has been politically involved with the Republican Party. For the 2000 U.S. presidential election, he rerecorded his song \"We Are Young Country\" to \"This is Bush-Cheney Country\". On October 15, 2008, at a rally in Virginia Beach for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, he performed \"McCain-Palin Tradition\", a song in support of McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin.[35] He has contributed to federal election campaigns, mostly to Republicans, including Michele Bachmann's 2012 presidential campaign. However, he has donated to some Democrats in the past, most notably Jim Cooper and John S. Tanner.[36]\n\nIn November 2008, Williams considered a run for the 2012 Republican nomination as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee for the seat held by GOP incumbent Bob Corker, although his publicist said regarding Williams \"no announcement has been made\".[37] Williams ultimately did not run.\n\n2011 Fox and Friends controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an October 3, 2011, interview with Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, Williams discussed a June golf game where President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner had teamed against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Governor John Kasich, saying the match was \"one of the biggest political mistakes ever\". When asked why the golf game troubled him, Williams stated, \"Come on. That'd be like Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu ... in the shape this country is in?\" He also said that the President and Vice President were \"the enemy\" and compared them to \"the Three Stooges\". Later, anchor Gretchen Carlson said to him, \"You used the name of one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe, I think, the president.\" Williams replied, \"Well, that is true. But I'm telling you like it is.\" As a result of his statements, ESPN dropped Williams' opening song from its Monday Night Football broadcast of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers versus the Indianapolis Colts and replaced it with the national anthem.[citation needed]\n\nWilliams later said his analogy was \"extreme – but it was to make a point\", and \"some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood ... I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me – how ludicrous that pairing was. They're polar opposites, and it made no sense. They don't see eye to eye and never will\". Additionally, Williams said he has \"always respected the office of the president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change\". ESPN later said it was \"extremely disappointed\" in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.[38]\n\nThree days later, ESPN announced Williams and his song would not return to Monday Night Football, ending the use of the song that had been part of the broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989.[39] Williams expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who had made the decision. \"After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision,\" he wrote. \"By pulling my opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It's been a great run.\"[40] Williams' son, Hank Williams III, stayed neutral in the debate, telling TMZ.com that most musicians, including his father, are \"not worthy\" of a political discussion.[41]\n\nAfter his song was pulled from Monday Night Football, Williams recorded a song criticizing Obama, ESPN and Fox & Friends, titled \"Keep the Change\". He released the track on iTunes and via free download at his website.[42] The song garnered over 180,000 downloads in two days.[43]\n\nWilliams continued to make his opinions of Obama known and during a performance at the Iowa State Fair in August 2012, he called Obama a Muslim telling the crowd, \"We've got a Muslim president who hates farming, hates the military, hates the U.S. and we hate him!\"[44][45]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hank Williams Jr. discography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Award 2020 Country Music Hall of Fame Inductee Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum 2017 No. 50 in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time Rolling Stone[46] 2007 Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame Inductee Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame 2007 Tennessean of the Year Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame 2006 Johnny Cash Visionary Award CMT Music Awards 2003 No. 20 in CMT's 40 Greatest Men of Country Music CMT 1996 Top Vocal Duo of the Year nomination with Hank Williams III Academy of Country Music[47] 1994 Composed Theme Emmy 1993 Composed Theme Emmy 1992 Composed Theme Emmy 1991 Composed Theme Emmy 1990 Video of the Year – There's a Tear in My Beer TNN/Music City News 1990 Vocal Collaboration of the Year – There's a Tear in My Beer TNN/Music City News 1989 Top Vocal Duo of the Year nomination with Hank Williams Academy of Country Music[47] 1989 Video of the Year – There's a Tear in My Beer Academy of Country Music 1989 Song of the Year nomination – There's a Tear in My Beer Academy of Country Music 1989 Single Record of the Year nomination – There's a Tear in My Beer Academy of Country Music 1989 Entertainer of the Year Academy of Country Music 1989 Music Video of the Year – There's a Tear in My Beer Country Music Association 1989 Vocal Event of the Year – There's a Tear in My Beer Country Music Association 1989 Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals – There's a Tear in My Beer Grammy Awards 1988 Entertainer of the Year Academy of Country Music 1988 Video of the Year – Young Country Academy of Country Music 1988 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1988 Male Vocalist of the Year nomination Country Music Association 1988 Album of the Year – Born to Boogie Country Music Association 1988 Entertainer of the Year Country Music Association 1988 Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male nomination – Born to Boogie Grammy Awards 1987 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1987 Song of the Year nomination – Born to Boogie Academy of Country Music 1987 Single Record of the Year nomination – Born to Boogie Academy of Country Music 1987 Entertainer of the Year Academy of Country Music 1987 Album of the Year nomination – Born to Boogie Academy of Country Music 1987 Entertainer of the Year Country Music Association 1987 Music Video of the Year – My Name Is Bocephus Country Music Association 1987 Male Vocalist of the Year nomination Country Music Association 1987 Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male nomination – Ain't Misbehavin Grammy Awards 1986 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1986 Entertainer of the Year nomination Academy of Country Music 1986 Male Vocalist of the Year nomination Country Music Association 1985 Music Video of the Year – All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight Country Music Association 1985 Male Vocalist of the Year nomination Country Music Association 1985 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1985 Single Record of the Year nomination – I'm for Love Academy of Country Music 1985 Entertainer of the Year nomination Academy of Country Music 1985 Album of the Year nomination – Five-O Academy of Country Music 1985 Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male nomination – All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight Grammy Awards 1985 Grammy Award for Best Country Song nomination – All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight Grammy Awards 1984 Video of the Year – All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight Academy of Country Music 1984 Album of the Year nomination – Man of Steel Academy of Country Music 1984 Entertainer of the Year nomination Academy of Country Music 1983 Entertainer of the Year nomination Academy of Country Music 1982 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1981 Top Male Vocalist nomination Academy of Country Music 1980 Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male nomination – Family Tradition Grammy Awards 1966 Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Album nomination – Father and son: Hank Williams and Hank Williams Jr. Grammy Awards 1965 Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Album nomination – Hank Williams Jr. Sings the Songs of Hank Williams Grammy Awards\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
