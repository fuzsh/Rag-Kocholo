        "text": "Reba McEntire announced new details about the upcoming 60th ACM Awards in 2025. The music legend is set to return as host of Country Music’s Party of the Year for her 18th time, holding that title more than any other artist.\n\nMcEntire and the Academy of Country Music shared a video on social media on Tuesday morning (July 16). McEntire reminded viewers that she announced during the 59th annual show earlier this year that she would return to host the milestone 60th year, “and as your returning host, I’m excited to announce that the 60th ACM Awards will be returning...on May 8, 2025.\n\n“It’s gonna be an absolute can’t-miss show, and I can’t wait to be there with you,” McEntire said. The 2025 show will take place again at the world headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys at The Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas. Tickets will go on sale later this year, McEntire confirmed.\n\nThough the Academy of Country Music has yet to reveal a list of performers and presenters for the 60th show, the 59th annual show earlier this year included a star-studded lineup with Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Kane Brown, Miranda Lambert, Cody Johnson, Kelsea Ballerini and Noah Kahan, husband and wife duo Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, and many more. Some of the genre’s biggest artists marked notable victories, including Wilson’s historic Entertainer of the Year win (she became the first woman to score the coveted Triple Crown award in three years). McEntire closed the show with a fiery rendition of her newest single, “I Can’t.”"
