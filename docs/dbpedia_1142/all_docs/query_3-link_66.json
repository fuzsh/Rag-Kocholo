        "text": "Defects in motor protein-mediated neuronal transport mechanisms have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders but remain relatively little studied in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Our aim in the present study was to assess the expression of the anterograde kinesin superfamily motor proteins KIF5A, KIF1B, and KIF21B, and to examine their relationship to levels of hyperphosphorylated tau, amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), and amyloid-β (Aβ) in human brain tissue. We used a combination of qPCR, immunoblotting, and ELISA to perform these analyses in midfrontal cortex from 49 AD and 46 control brains. Expression of KIF5A, KIF1B, and KIF21B at gene and protein level was significantly increased in AD. KIF5A protein expression correlated inversely with the levels of AβPP and soluble Aβ in AD brains. Upregulation of KIFs may be an adaptive response to impaired axonal transport in AD.\n\nThe sequential enzymatic actions of β-APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), presenilins (PS), and other proteins of the γ-secretase complex liberate β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides from larger integral membrane proteins, termed β-amyloid precursor proteins (APPs). Relatively little is known about the normal function(s) of APP or the neuronal compartment(s) in which APP undergoes proteolytic processing. Recent studies have been interpreted as consistent with the idea that APP serves as a kinesin-1 cargo receptor and that PS and BACE1 are associated with the APP-resident membranous cargos that undergo rapid axonal transport. In this report, derived from a collaboration among several independent laboratories, we examined the potential associations of APP and kinesin-1 using glutathioneS-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In addition, we assessed the trafficking of membrane proteins in the sciatic nerves of transgenic mice with heterozygous or homozygous deletions ofAPP. In contra...\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is an abundant brain-enriched protein that can regulate microtubule assembly in neurons. This function of CRMP2 is regulated by phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Here, using novel phosphospecific antibodies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 (Cdk5-mediated) is increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, while CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation of the closely related isoform CRMP4 are not altered. In addition, CRMP2 phosphorylation at the Cdk5 and GSK3 sites is increased in cortex and hippocampus of the triple transgenic mouse [presenilin-1 (PS1)M146VKI; Thy1.2-amyloid precursor protein (APP)swe; Thy1.2tauP301L] that develops AD-like plaques and tangles, as well as the double (PS1M146VKI; Thy1.2-APPswe) transgenic mouse. The hyperphosphorylation is similar in magnitude to that in human AD and is evident by 2 months of age, ahead of plaque or tangle formation. Meanwhile, there is no change in CRMP2 phosphorylation in two other transgenic mouse lines that display elevated amyloid β peptide levels (Tg2576 and APP/amyloid β-binding alcohol dehydrogenase). Similarly, CRMP2 phosphorylation is normal in hippocampus and cortex of Tau(P301L) mice that develop tangles but not plaques. These observations implicate hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 as an early event in the development of AD and suggest that it can be induced by a severe APP over-expression and/or processing defect.\n\nWe identified axonal defects in mouse models of Alzheimer&#39;s disease that preceded known disease-related pathology by more than a year; we observed similar axonal defects in the early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s disease in humans. Axonal defects consisted of swellings that accumulated abnormal amounts of microtubule-associated and molecular motor proteins, organelles, and vesicles. Impairing axonal transport by reducing the dosage of a kinesin molecular motor protein enhanced the frequency of axonal defects and increased amyloid-β peptide levels and amyloid deposition. Reductions in microtubule-dependent transport may stimulate proteolytic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein, resulting in the development of senile plaques and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is an incurable, fatal illness characterised by years of progressive mental decline. It afflicts half a million people in the UK - more than any other dementia. The primary risk factor is old age so this number is rising as we live longer. Current treatment is palliative while more potent drugs have encountered problems during clinical trials. It is known that the disease results from brain deterioration associated with the formation of microscopic lesions. Genetic mutations cause a small minority of cases but our knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms is limited. The key to improved understanding may be a process vital to brain cells called axonal transport. Disruption of axonal transport seems to be an early event in the progression of the disease and is linked to lesion formation and brain dysfunction so a full investigation of this process should lead to a cure, if not prevention.
