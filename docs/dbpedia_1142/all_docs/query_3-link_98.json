        "text": "Kicking off Halloween in Horror\n\nThis morning (Halloween day) I went to the DMV and oh, what a horrorible place that is.\n\nThey talk about the rise and fall of civilizations. If the “wait time” at the Driver’s License Bureau is any indication, I’d say America is on the rocks.\n\nI’ve been twice in two days. Yesterday I went at 10am because I thought that would be a good time to miss the morning crowd and beat the lunch crowd (also, that’s when I woke up). Guess again! the place was so packed I knew I’d be there all day so turned and left, determined to beat the system later.\n\nThe ingenious plan I hatched was to arrive before the place even opens at 7:00am. Haha, that oughta work, right? The early bird gets the worm, right? No line, right?\n\nThus, this morning at the ghastly hour of 6:55am I could be found bleary eyed, shivering in the dark, stumbling into the DMV, only to be greeted with… an insanely long line! Apparently I wasn’t the only person in Wichita hatching the same sneaky idea.\n\nDespite my best efforts, my wait time was still 40 minutes. Perhaps if I’d arrived 40 minutes before it opened instead of 5, I could have been first in line.\n\nHeads up, they’ve changed the format at 21st and Amidon. Now you don’t shuffle along in a de-humanizing queue reminiscent of food line photos from the former Soviet Union, but instead sit in a well-lit lobby with an assigned number.\n\nAdditionally, they have installed a screen which gives estimated wait times, which is nice. My number was 19, yet somehow they went to number 32 before I was called. Then I was treated with suspicion and my number double checked to make sure I wasn’t cutting.\n\nAs I walked up, trying to straighten the arthritis from my back after sitting so long, I gave the lady a cheerful, “Good morning,” and what I considered (on the inside) to be a pleasant smile. However, my neighborly cheer was not reciprocated. Working there must be a hard life.\n\nYou know, what I also found a bit eerie is how silent it gets in the waiting room with the huddled masses hunched over their smartphones in mesmerized trances. Airports are the same way.\n\nI think someone needs to invent a smartphone app that monitors surroundings and lets users know if there’s ever any reason to look up from the screen.\n\nThe Tube of You\n\nSo one of my best talents is watching YouTube videos. It’s not hard, really, just keep clicking the never-ending recommended clips. Yet I seem to have an innate knack.\n\nIt’s impossible to watch everything on Youtube because eight years of new content is posted daily! Wow.\n\nAwhile ago I watched a bunch of America’s Got Talent clips… and Britain’s Got Talent, Australia’s Got Talent, France Has Talent (France has work to do, by the way).\n\nAhh, good ol’ Susan Boyle.\n\nI found the longer I watched the less talent there was. Pretty soon I’d seen most the ones with over a million hits. As you know, if it doesn’t have at least a million hits, it’s not worth watching.\n\nBut the Talent TV shows got me thinking, “All the glory [or infamy] in these programs go directly to the person on stage. They get their moment basking in glory, and then…?”\n\nSure, some go on to sign a record label, like Boyle. Though even her CD title, “Standing Ovation,” is revealing. Others, less fortunate, fade into obscurity.\n\nNot that it’s wrong to bask in the praise of men, per se, but as Jesus says, “They have received their reward in full.”\n\nGot me wondering what the proper stance is in a show-off skill like musicianship? There aren’t any hard and fast rules, but two things come to mind:\n\nBe inspiring. Ideally through lifting others hearts toward God. This is one reason I’ve primarily played Sacred Music over the years on piano.\n\nCreate beauty! ThePianoGuys do a great job at this. Just watching their works brings peace.\n\nThanks Be, My Heart is Still Pumping\n\nIn other news, I received a heart rate monitor in the mail this week (because I ordered it off Amazon last week).\n\nYep, I’m on a new kick of running. In theory, I’m training for a 100-mile ultramarathon so need the heart rate monitor to fine tune my intensive racing schedule. In practice, I’ve gotten to where I can locomote my body about half hour before it collapses into a jelly-melt on the sidewalk.\n\nTurns out there are multiple “zones” one can exercise the heart in. One for burning fat, one for slow-twitch muscle growth, one for fast-twitch, one for keeling over with a heart attack in the middle of the road, etc.\n\nThen there is the Maximal zone, when your heart is running at 90% capacity (or higher). That zone is not recommended for routine training.\n\nAnxious to try my new monitor, I went on a leisurely jog, intending to target the aerobic level. Within two minutes my heartrate was up to “Maximal Zone.” Yikes.\n\nTried slowing down, but hey, I wasn’t not out to walk, but to run like the wind. Which is to say I was already moving so slow any further reduction in speed would have been walking.\n\nSo I ended up jogging several miles in the high heartrate zone. They say when the heart runs full-out pitter-patter the body doesn’t even burn fat, only carbs! Lucky for me I had downed four butter-biscuits loaded with carbs just before heading out, so I was Ok.\n\nLife Through New Lenses\n\nHere at home I’m wrapping up loose ends before heading to Haiti. One was getting my dilapidated glasses replaced. Been wearing my stodgy pair because the good ones were lost in the Current river whilst canoeing last June. Yes, the expensive $400 ones.\n\nThe worst part about getting a new pair of glasses is the initial adjustment. These ones were particularly stubborn as they’re made from flexible materials difficult to re-flex.\n\nFirst my earpieces needed bent. Then my nose pieces were too close. Then they were too far apart. Then crooked. Finally, all seemed well. The lady had made them comfortable, and I left.\n\nDriving away from the office, I glanced in the rearview mirror and noticed my glasses were slewed sideways on my face… one lens up in the air, the other down low. “That’s odd,” I thought, and pushed the high side down. It came back up.\n\nShucks, they need more adjusting, but am I going to be that “obnoxious customer” who comes back in with more complaints? Not I, too embarrassing. Especially after all the hard work she’d done (think she was new).\n\nSo I decided to swing by good ol’ Wal-Mart on my way home and have them take a gander at my proud new specs.\n\nThere, a motherly type gave me a hard stare before starting in with something to the effect of, “Good gracious, child! these are off something terrible.” Yeah, I know.\n\nShe began working her magic, tweaking, bending, prying, grimacing. She was not impressed, “Honey, ‘ave you jest gotten your head smashed into with a ball?”\n\nHow was I supposed to answer, seeing they were brand new and just laboriously adjusted? I answered truthfully, “No.”\n\n“Then why come these frames are so bent up crooked?” she exclaimed, giving me a hard look, no doubt wondering if the impact had knocked out a few of my memories.\n\nFinally she got them to where they sat crooked on the table between us, but more or less straight on my face. Maybe I need a new facial next, or perhaps a face alignment.\n\nThe End of Horror\n\nSo maybe this post wasn’t so much about kicking off Halloween in Horror as it was about kicking it off in Humor.\n\nHonestly, I didn’t even know it was Halloween today until I went through the McDonald’s drive-thru and a pink ballerina was at the window to take my money (complete with tu-tu).\n\nThat got me wondering if something was up, so I asked her if it was Halloween or St. Patrick’s Day or something and she told me yes, it was Halloween.\n\nDo Pictures Make Our Lives Better?\n\nBack in 1824, Joseph Niépc took the first photograph ever – a view looking out the window of his home in France. Here it is:\n\nThat may have been the first photograph, but believe me, it wasn’t the last, though I’d venture to opine many taken since are hardly more interesting.\n\n188 years later, us humans take photos at prodigious rates. According to a recent USA Today article (dated June, 2012) over 300 million photos are being uploaded to Facebook per day.\n\nThat’s over 100 billion photos per year being uploaded just to Facebook!\n\nI’m as guilty as the next person, having snapped over 10,000 pics in the last year alone.\n\nIt’s easy to go crazy with digital cameras. When I was a kid back in the stone age of film cameras I remember only getting 24 exposures per roll, and couldn’t see what they looked like until after they developed. Couldn’t take so many back then.\n\nBut I wonder, what are all these photos doing for me? I take time to shoot them, I take time to organize and store them, I purchase hard drives to hold them, I may or may not take time to view them later.\n\nYeah, they tell a story, but couldn’t I tell a story in writing? or better yet, in person? Yeah, they may impress someone (there I am, standing in front of x, y, or z), but is that necessary? Yeah, photos capture events, but isn’t that what God gave us memories for?\n\nSpeaking of events, the cost of shooting weddings usually runs between $1,000 and $5,000 dollars. Photography is big business. In more ways than one. If we didn’t have photos we might not have billboards. Or risqué magazines at every convenience store checkout. Or worse.\n\nMost the world never had cameras, and they seemed to have got along fine without them. We tend to think of the “old days” being in black and white, but before 1824 there wasn’t even black and white! All they had was cave art scratched with burnt sticks. And Michael de Angelo.\n\nAs I examine my own motives, I become suspiciously aware that vanity plays the larger part in my desire to have good photos of myself. And pride and impressing others a good deal to do with many of the rest.\n\nOf course, I’m not saying it’s all bad. I’ve taken sunset pictures from nature, for example, which were nice to look at later, and fun to set as my desktop background.\n\nYet, I think taking pictures pulls me away from the present. It focuses my attention on capturing “the moment” so as to live it again in the future. Then in the future looking back at them, I’m again dwelling on the past.\n\nHow often have we missed the real moment in our exuberance to get that elusively perfect shot?\n\nThis post isn’t meant to condemn cameras as “bad,” per se. Surely they have their good points. I enjoy taking pictures as a hobby.\n\nBut I’m beginning to wonder if it’s all a bit much? Maybe photos are overrated? Cameras weren’t given to us by God as standard equipment with birth, so they must not be essential. We don’t have any pictures of Jesus with his 12 disciples… I’m wondering if it is all a clever ploy for my time to be distracted from things more important?\n\nI don’t know, what do you think?\n\nRelated Post(s):\n\nTexting Beyond Our Limits\n\nMy Remarks Following a Visit to the Local Salt Mine\n\nOn Monday I visited the Hutchinson Salt Mine with Luke and Mom.\n\nBeing so deep underground (twice the depth of the height of the Statue of Liberty) was disconcerting. ‘Tis not hospitable for humans down there… had the ventilators quit working we would soon have died from lack of air. I noticed a tangy smell/taste that made my tongue feel acrid. Definitely not my first choice for work conditions. Others may, but I cannot.\n\nThe tour operator instructed us not to lick the salt, whatever we did, because it was low grade only used for de-icing roads, not for human consumption. Luke was quite curious and badly wanted to test the culinary quality, but refrained because – I guess – all the warnings dire. But then, next thing I know he’d done gone ahead and ate a piece! No rules against that. I think he’s Ok, and not palpably ill.\n\nNow its been proven (by us) their salt is fine for people to eat, perhaps we could recommend the mine broaden their market?\n\nLighting down there was skimpy, so if you ever visit, do bring a flashlight. The following picture was taken with my cell phone in the only location lit enough to not need a flash: the Men’s Room.\n\nThe nifty apparatus slung over my shoulder is a rebreathing device that would convert hazardous gas back into oxygen in the case of a fire. In 50 years of mining, there hasn’t been a fire yet, thanks Be. Salt doesn’t burn, which is a plus, and I left all my fireworks at home.\n\nThe floors were smooth and made from saltcrete, (like concrete but from salt). They said if water gets on the floors they’ll melt like the wicked witch from Wizard of Oz.\n\nAt one point in our tour we had to traverse some five yards of unfinished dirt-like ground. Before we did so, we were given solemn warnings on the safety hazards of crossing this hazardous, uneven ground. Good grief!\n\nIt’s times like these I have that little bit of culture “shock,” wondering to myself how a caution like this would be received by someone from the Moi tribe? No doubt a circuit or two would be blown in their brains. They routinely traverse muddy logs over rushing rivers while balancing heavy burdens or carrying a child slung on their back in a handwoven sack and don’t think twice. And here to be lectured on the dangers of walking across some dirt?\n\nThere are other dangers. For instance, from time to time ceilings cave in. That’s dangerous, but thankfully no one so far has been under one when it happened. In fact, no one has died in the mine yet, supposedly.\n\nI found it interesting they told us that, on the one hand, it will take 50,000 more years for the current 9’ ceilings to get squished back into the ground. Yet on the other hand, I saw with my own eyes a ceiling that had caved in with significantly less time (like 50 years). Fortunately, we were all wearing hard hats.\n\nSo it’s a working mine, providing salt for roads all over the US. Like I said, they don’t mine for human consumption. Despite the massive production quantity (including providing anti-ice for Chicago) the grand total of miners down there furiously chipping away are only…. four!\n\nNo joke, four miners. Ha, the wonders of mechanization (and explosives), we no longer need people.\n\nSpeaking of mechanization, saw an article on robots in Popular Science while waiting in the eye doctors office this week. Robots these days have come a long way. They’re now so smart, and learning so fast, it’s predicted we will soon have our own to do our bidding: from brewing up coffee on our automated coffee makers, to putting dirty dishes into our dishwashers (and turning them on), to fiddling with the thermostat when we get too hot or cold, to popping open a refreshing can of Dr. Pepper for us from the fridge. Won’t it be great having our own robots?\n\nThe robot above can get a can of Coke from a specialized fridge, but I’m holding out for one than can bring me Dr. Pepper, which I prefer.\n\nBut back to my subject… All in all, I recommend visiting the famous and romanticized Salt Mines of Hutchin-lore if you ever have the chance. Here it is, one of the premier tourist attractions of my home, and one of the 32 Wonders of Kansas, and I’m just now experienced them at this late point in my life! Inconceivable.\n\nHey, whenever you do visit… if you happen to find Mom’s reading glasses on the train down there, please bring them back for her.\n\nHaiti: Idyllic Isle with a Few Worrisome Woes\n\nTravelling Again!\n\nSo once again I’m travelling, to wit: in Haiti – with all that implies.\n\nUpon arrival last Thursday I hit the ground running and have been until today, which is being used to catch up: doing laundry (by hand in a bucket, using laundry powder purchased in Indonesia), visiting locals at the guest house I’m staying, playing the piano (yes! they have one here), reading, relaxing, and writing.\n\nI’ve slept four different places in the last six nights. One of them was in the Dallas airport, several were miserably hot with no fan, and one was on the concrete floor of a church.\n\nA Quick Overview of What I’ve Been Up To Here\n\nBy any standard, a lot has been crammed into the time so far. By Haitian standards (where nothing runs smoothly) it’s perhaps mildly impressive: Visited an orphanage for 60 girls (twas very poor), visited a bizarre orphanage for 400 boys, traveled with local pastor and friend Watson a couple hours out of the capital to his church for an all-day Sunday wipe-out extravaganza, embarked on several shopping trips, including one to a local Christian bookstore where Bibles were purchased, and am currently staying at a Home for Boys for previous street children where I’m getting to meet and talk with the youth.\n\nHere’s a pic of my friend Watson and his wife:\n\nSon of God Orphanage “Kids Update”\n\nSo Jeremy and I followed up with as many of the Son of God Orphanage kids as we could. The girls seem to be doing well, though don’t have much. 37 of them from Son of God were sent to a single small orphanage that was, I gather, overwhelmed by the influx. We visited it, bringing a bunch of mangos for a token gift. Though the girls seemed happy overall, and the director appears to be kind, it was (to me) a dreary place, and many of them were wearing clothing far beyond the Goodwill stage. I was told 16 of the 37 have already moved on to live with next of kin.\n\nThe boys appear to be doing so-so. They are mixed into a massive orphanage complex. Some seemed happy, but near as I could tell it was in spite of their current circumstances, not because of them. There were kids who remembered us and seemed glad we visited.\n\nJeremy and I spent several days with two of the boys in particular (brothers Daniel and Evenson). They tagged along as we followed up with other kiddos. Jeremy has taken a special interest in their situation.\n\nThe four of us were “batching it,” and the boys rustled up most the food, as they disapproved of the way Jeremy and I cooked. Don’t you know spaghetti needs ketchup, mayonnaise, and tons of oil??\n\nOf the three kids whom I was personally most interested in locating, I found one: Miel, and he seemed OK. Due to odd restrictions I only got to visit with him a minute, but he remembered me and I gave him a hug and told him I was praying for him.\n\nRegarding the other two: Job and his sister Yansommah, I did learn they have gone back to their local village to live with relatives. I hope they are doing fine… Perhaps I can find them in the future.\n\nThe Good News\n\nIt’s not all gloom and bug-bites here. I’ve already met a number of kind people, been impressed by hospitality, and seen acts of kindness, all in less than a week.\n\nAt a basic level, people are similar everywhere: trying to make a living, keep healthy marriages, raise kids, and want the best for their families. Naturally sin puts a wrench in the realization of those desires, and that’s why we need the Grace of God on a daily basis.\n\nThe picture of Watson’s little girl Dorana, sleeping below, kind of sums up for me how the world is the same all over. She was scared of me at first, but eventually warmed up and let me hold her without fussing. Reminded me on my little nieces.\n\nLocal Traffic Hasn’t Improved Since My Last Visit\n\nTraffic and chaos here are as crazy as I remembered, perhaps more so, yet at the same time seem more normal now after having experienced a few other “developing country” cultures.\n\nOne of the local forms of transportation here are vans just like they use back in Ethiopia/Kenya (called Motatus there). This is my third trip to Haiti, but my first to use the public vans, though I’ve spent my fair share of time in them over in Africa. Twice in the last several days I’ve spent a couple hours riding in one, sharing it with some 20 other passengers, my luggage jammed in my lap, hawkers trying to sell me food through the windows, squeezed in tight on both sides, and believe it or not, I felt quite at home!\n\n“This is just like I’m used to in Africa!” I told Watson, adding, “Haiti reminds me of Africa, just about 50% crazier.”\n\nMany Haitians Still Desperate\n\nThe desperate needs here can be quickly overwhelming. Seems everyone has needs. Not wants… needs. A mother asked Jeremy and I if we could help send her daughters to school. Sounds like a simple request that any charitably rich person would be happy to meet. But nothing is simple: that same mother also needed many other things including a roof over her head and… more importantly, food! but so do many others, and it’s hard to know when to draw the line… one can’t bankroll the entire country.\n\nThis is a problem others here wrestle with as well. A Christian man I will meet tomorrow, John McHoul, just wrote a post about a woman here who wants to give up her daughter for him and his wife to care for. His thoughts are poignant, you can read them here. I’ve firsthand seen a similar thing happen, even on this trip.\n\nHow Much Help is Too Much?\n\nIt’s not ideal for Haitians to be dependent on benefactors for their daily bread, purchasing a home, school bills, and everything else, etc. Surely there is another answer? You often hear Haitians need jobs, and they do, but doing what? Foreign investment is low because of political instability.\n\nWatson told me he would like to start a school connected with his church in the rural community he serves: “It would provide jobs,” he explained, “I could hire teachers, cleaners, etc, and I would also make it free for all the students as parents can’t afford it.”\n\nUmm.. where will the money come from to run the school if tuition is free? Where will the teachers salaries come from? Unfortunately, it’s true many parents can’t afford to send their kids to school: many are subsistence peasants living and bartering off garden plots one acre or less in size.\n\nI was told he government would give Watson $100/student per year if he were to start a school. That’s a start.\n\nSince many in the countryside cannot even read, I wondered if there were qualified teachers out there from which to hire? Or would the teaching jobs created be filled by educated folks from the capital?\n\nLocal Norms I’m Reminded Of\n\nBeing here has jostled my memory of other distinctives from this Caribbean island: the staple food of rice and beans, intermittent electrical power, humid heat, waving palm trees, blue ocean, drinking water from sealed plastic bags, all the buildings made from concrete, being bitten alive, the general public showing little sense of “noise respect”, and being regarded as a foreigner (like a curios relic).\n\nThe sporadic electricity is annoying. You never know if it’s going to turn off for five minutes, an hour, a day, longer? Doesn’t seem to be rhyme or reason to it. One evening, after about 24 hours without power it suddenly flicked on and I heard cheering up and down the street.\n\nOf course, to every sunbeam there is a stormy cloud: in this case once the electricity turned on all sense of peace and quiet was wrecked as radios were cranked back up.\n\nInspired by Mueller, of the George Variety\n\nYesterday I finished a biography of George Muller I had borrowed from the church library. Seeing his example of faith in believing God would provide in extra ordinary ways – then seeing God indeed provide was very encouraging, and influenced my opinions on this issue.\n\nMueller primarily wanted to show God strong to a skeptical world, even above the benefits running his Orphan Homes had, in the end, on helping provide for and raise over 10,000 children.\n\nThe timing of my reading the book seemed particularly beneficial in light of the needs I’m seeing here, especially in regards to Orphans.\n\nA verse I’ve been thinking about today is Col 3:2, “Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.” Mueller spent a lot of time in prayer and said himself towards the end of his life he pretty much lived in a constant state of prayer, and the “answers were always coming.” “Devote yourselves to prayer,” says Colossians 4:2 – Mueller did.\n\n“There is life and power, and reality in our holy faith. If you never yet have known this, then come and taste for yourself.” ~George Mueller\n\nGoals for this 10-Day Trip to Haiti\n\nToday I’m heading off to Port-au Prince, Haiti. Should be back next Friday.\n\nGoals for this trip include:\n\nTrying to find and meet with various children from the now-defunct Son of God orphanage to see how they are doing and encourage them in some way.\n\nMeet with two organizations that work with Street Kids (Child Hope and St. Joseph’s Home for boys) to learn more about how they operate and better understand their unique challenges.\n\nVisit Heartline Ministries, where I’m pursuing a volunteering position starting this upcoming December.\n\nSpend time with a local pastor (Watson) to better understand his ministry and learn more about the spiritual climate in Haiti.\n\nBe flexible to learn or do whatever God might have for me!\n\nWhile the goals are worthwhile, all of them are relational and intellectual in nature, not leaving behind a tangible result in the way a construction project would, for example. My hope is to learn some important things and deepen some relationships.\n\nThis will be my third time to visit Haiti, yet I still find it an intimidating place. It’s true I’ve wandered around Israel, Ethiopia, Kenya, and a few other spots outside America by myself, but Haiti is in a class of its own. I feel more comfortable hopping on a Motatu in Addis than a tap-tap in Port-au Prince, but in reality there’s probably not much difference. Perhaps the congestion in Haiti’s capital is what makes it seem worse.\n\nThe extreme poverty does play a role in the intimidation factor… Fox Business News recently ranked Haiti as the #1 poorest country in the world. Despite being impoverished, it is not a cheap place to visit! Think I could do a Caribbean cruise for less money.\n\nI checked the 10-day weather forecast for Port-au Prince and every day the highs are predicted for the mid-90s. Welcome back, summer…!\n\nWould appreciate prayers for wisdom and guidance.\n\nAlso am hoping to find the boy in the picture below. His name is Job, and I’m concerned about him and his sister.\n\nMy Life is a Story, But How’s the Scripting?\n\nLife is a story. Yours is. Mine is.\n\n(heads up, this post isn’t very interesting, just random musings)\n\nOne of the dozen or so blogs I follow is Screenwriting Tips. Every day a thought-provoking tidbit is shared on effective scriptwriting. Below are several I appreciated on “Crafting a protagonist (hero)”:\n\nAt the character bio stage, don’t create characters whose goals fit neatly together like pieces in a puzzle. Instead, give them goals and desires that directly conflict with each other.\n\nYour protagonist gets to be in control during the first twenty pages and the last twenty. For the rest of the script she should be struggling, confused or otherwise on the back foot.\n\nAt the simplest level, antagonists are just characters who force your protagonist to make choices.\n\nThink of your protagonist’s arc in terms of sacrifice. At the beginning of the script, she’s willing to sacrifice very little and gets nothing in return. By the end, she should be willing to sacrifice everything to gain everything in return.\n\nI see elements of these “tips” have unintentionally slipped into my own life, largely against my will.\n\nFor instance, same as in Tip 1 my desires/goals often stand in conflict:\n\nBecome more involved in Kansas / Become more involved in Haiti\n\nAspire for wisdom and humility / Aspire for riches and fame\n\nEat more junk food + never run again / Eat less junk food + exercise\n\nGet married and live a steady life / Stay single and carefree as the wind!\n\nSuch dilemmas.\n\nEven Jesus had quandaries, praying in the Garden that, “this cup would pass.” He hardly relished the upcoming ordeal, yet desired most to execute His Father’s will, which He did.\n\nGuess it’s not a sin to have a conflict, just so long as the good angel comes out on top. Why are the right decisions always the hardest ones?\n\nTip 2 said good stories keep the hero, “struggling, confused or otherwise on the back foot.” I find in life when things get too comfortable, I get uncomfortable… wondering what’s next? Surely goodness won’t last… and usually it doesn’t, though oft at my own bequest resulting from a bad habit of signing up for new challenges, a glutton for punishment.\n\nThey say if you help a newborning chicken (?) crack open its’ shell, it will later die from improper muscle development. Don’t know if that’s true, but instinctively we know difficulty and struggle yields growth… and growth is good!\n\nAll great scripts are replete with struggle and conflict.\n\nIn the story of the Prodigal Son, the prodigal was in control at the beginning of the story and never again, soon he was struggling and confused as his life spiraled downwards from a result of destructively short-sighted decisions. That story is well scripted. Isn’t it ironic his own worst enemy was himself? something often true in my own life too.\n\nTip 3 explained the purpose of antagonists: to provoke the protagonist to action, to decision!\n\nWho or what are the antagonists in our lives? High stress? An annoying neighbor or nagging boss? Moral dilemmas? Ice cream and candy bars? A broken-down car? Disappointments? Internal desires? Bad health? Hurricane Isaac? All the above?\n\nAntagonists are anything that upsets our equilibrium, not just villains.\n\nThough it CAN be villains: I’m currently reading the book, Decision Points by George W. Bush. The discussion over 9/11 revolved around how that event forced our nation to craft new decisions regarding our attitude towards terrorists. Antagonists have a way of forcing the issues.\n\nHaving a bum back five years ago was an antagonist that forced me to face my mortality and eventually resulted in my reevaluating life, changing direction, and making difficult decisions about the future. More immediate, the back pain I experienced for several months forced me then to make a decision on whether to have a positive attitude or a sour attitude. Unfortunately, I made the wrong decision and was pretty sour during that trial.\n\nTip 4 deals with how a well-crafted hero should substantially change throughout a story, particularly in regards to his values and priorities.\n\nPeter denied Christ three times in one evening, yet later was crucified upside down for refusing to denounce Christ! Talk about change, he is a protagonist of the first order.\n\nEver done the exercise where you think back ten years to what an important priority in your life was then? Ten years ago I was 19 and making the cut in college was a top concern. Then you think back 20 years ago and ask the same question… I was 9 years old then and my cup of tea was working towards becoming a computer game programmer. 30 years ago? At that time I was –1 and nervously anticipating birth.\n\nSeriously, I do at times marvel how different I am now than five years ago, or ten. Particularly in values. Looking forward I think, “Where am I headed? What are my goals? What am I fighting for? Are my goals worth fighting for? What type of sacrifices am I prepared to reach my destination?”\n\nConclusion\n\nThe point of this post was to generate thought in how our lives are not just our lives, but also interesting stories complete with intricate plots and character developments.\n\nPerhaps we often miss the forest of our lives for the trees of daily living? I wonder, is my story one of forging ahead to make a difference in things that really matter, or merely moseying in circles? That thought is sobering.\n\nOn a spiritual note, God was working in the lives of honest-to-goodness people in the Bible when they often they didn’t know it at the time. Most Old Testament characters had no idea of the bigger picture their small part was playing. I like to think that in the same way God is using my life to weave a larger tapestry: someday I’ll see it, stand back, and say, “Wow!”\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien, a master story-teller in his own right, wove clues on his philosophy of “story” into the very script of his most famous story, The Lord of the Rings (watch it here):\n\nFrodo: I can’t do this, Sam.\n\nSam: I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be here. But we are. It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn’t. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.\n\nFrodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?\n\nSam: That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo… and it’s worth fighting for.\n\nI would add to Sam’s comment there is a God who promises a new day, a bright one, for those who hold to faith in Him, an invisible being who has made outlandish promises to humans through his Word, the Bible:\n\nAgainst all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations… Without weakening in his faith… he did not waver through unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.(Rom 4:17-22)\n\nWould You Like to Receive Post Updates by E-mail?\n\nWell, now you can, because on the left sidebar I just added a Subscribe button for anyone interested.\n\nThe way it works is you put in your e-mail address and then in the future you’ll be notified whenever a new post is added. Nifty, huh?\n\nTent and Sailboat Camping in Oklahoma\n\nLast weekend Dad and I went on a three day Father-Son campout.\n\nAll great expeditions start at QuickTrip, and this one was no exception:\n\nThe lake we visited, Broken Bow, is known for both its clear waters and also being dotted with scenic islands. I was planning for us to boat to one of those scenic islands and camp on it. Yet… I forgot we’re in America, the land of a million rules, one of which was, “No camping on the islands.” Shucks, why do they have to take the fun out of everything?\n\nSo we car camped, which was just as well…. except that if you know us Middleton’s and car camping we have to look over every possible option before making a decision. For the first hour of driving around various campgrounds I was despairing of ever finding something halfway decent (ie: secluded, flat, scenic, with easy lake access, etc) but then we discovered this beautiful gem, all tucked away in a back corner with nary a soul around (ok, one other soul, but of the “non-alcoholic peacable” variety):\n\nAs far as the sailing went, it was decent. Sometimes we had enough wind, a time or two a storm blew through and we had too much wind, and sometimes we were completely becalmed… But weather conditions are all part of the fun. And the main thing isn’t the sailing anyways, it’s just to be outside, away from the “grind,” and spending time together. I’m 15 months removed from any type of “grind,” but still felt the trip was needed for me to unwind from my unwinding.\n\nHere’s a pic I snapped of the boats on an island we stopped for lunch:\n\nI nearly fell asleep because I’m fairly lazy, as a rule:\n\nHere is a minute worth of non-professional video clips:\n\nAll in all I would say it was a success. Our tent only blew over once (while we were sleeping in it) and we only got stuck on the lake in thunderstorms a few times.\n\nTrivia: Did you know it always rains on Middleton campouts? Yep, this has been documented as far back as 20 years ago (when my re-memory began). I used to say, when we planned a campout, “It’s going to rain” with a *wink* *wink” because we really know it’s all a coincidence, right? Nope, I no longer believe in coincidence, there must be an uncanny force at work, one with a propensive bent towards mischief, I shouldn’t wonder.\n\nThe phenomena could be illustrated well through the recounting of hosts of stories. One of the most dramatic was the Trinity Baptist Father-Son campout Dad organized when I was about 10. I remember our tent collapsing in the night during a salacious downpour replete with continual lightning, thunder, and monsoon-like rains. So we left our tent in a heap and went to sleep in the van. Then someone woke us up a few hours later rapping on our windows and pointing out we were now on an island in the middle of a flash flood! Oh the joys of camping.\n\nMore recently, in Israel I went backpacking several times with my Polish friend Tomasz. He caught on real quick to the whole Nick-Rain-Deal, and by the second time out was already questioning whether he wanted to be camping with me anymore!\n\nNo joke, the two of us went out to the Negev desert and got rained out. Apparently it only pours there on the rarest of occasions (annual rainfall ~1inch). So rare in fact, that the next day we came across geology students who had driven down from Jerusalem just to witness the unique features created by a rainstorm in the desert since it hardly ever happens! Well, what did they expect? A Middleton showed up in Israel.\n\nLastly, here we are in the middle of a drought in Wichita, right? The creek behind my parents house is DRY which has never happened in the 14 years they’ve lived there. Yet… the morning we left for Oklahoma there was so much rain Mom called us later to say there was mass flooding in Wichita! Go figure.\n\nI’m not sure if it’s a Middleton thing or a Nick thing. Maybe I should change my name to Jonah?\n\nLife in the Slow Lane\n\nSo after five weeks working at summer Bible camp, I’m back in Wichita. There were friends I made at camp I most likely won’t see again anytime soon. Sad. But, there are friends here I’m getting re-acquainted with.\n\nThe whole last year of my life seems to be a long series of “hellos” and “goodbye’s.” Frustrating. Sometimes it feels like I have a million acquaintances but no friends. Maybe I should stay put in one place a little longer?\n\nI had to laugh at a sign I recently saw in front of an Automotive Collision Repair Shop that read, “We make friends by accident.”\n\nWhile I too have met many people by accident, I’ve also met many people intentionally. I find my better friends are ones which chose me and not ones I chose. Probably some spiritual lesson there… God can only have true relationship with those who reciprocally choose Him.\n\nWhile I have things to do here back home, it is a bit depressing to not be living the life of high adventure. Instead, I’ve been working on getting my car running again. It was over-heating, but now it’s fixed.\n\nHigh adventure aside, I miss living in community like I did on the Kibbutz in Israel or at Camp this summer (and last summer).\n\nBeen spending some time researching Haiti, where I’d like to go back. Reading about it’s history, culture, people, geography, strengths, weaknesses, and language. Even listened to Haitian Christian music on Youtube, some of which drives me nuts because its too repetetive while other songs I truly enjoy. Good or bad, they greatly enjoy their music. I liked this a capella group and this choir singing Psalm 23.\n\nSpeaking of music on the Tube of You, have you heard ThePianoGuys? Not sure why they have that name because only one out of four plays the piano: 1 cameraman, 1 audioman, 1 pianist, and 1 cellist. They put together fantastic stuff. A few classics are: Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Me and My Cello – but my personal favorite is Bourne Vivaldi.\n\nSince I haven’t written in forever, I forgot to mention the last two weeks I was at camp my job was life-guarding (which was fun). No one drowned so that was a success.\n\nI wish there was more to write about, but my life is pretty slow these days.\n\nCrocs, Moby Dick, a Lost Toothbrush and a Light Princess\n\nI was too quick to laud the merits of Crocs in my last post. This week one of mine sat out in the sun an entire day and (would you know it?) shrunk down at least two whole sizes! No joke.\n\nMade me feel like one of Cinderella’s sisters trying to jam a foot into a glass slipper, my heel hanging out the back. Who would have thunk mere sunshine would shrink a Croc down like cannibalistic natives shrink heads?\n\nThe sun ruined another of my belongings as well. After sitting in the broiling trunk of my car for some time, my laptop battery no longer accepts a charge. This is sad, but someone told me I should put it in the refrigerator to fix it. I tried. It didn’t work. Then they told me I should put it in a ziplock baggy and freeze it. With some trepediation, and after warning my roommates to not be alarmed if they heard a muffled *boom* from the freezer, I tried that as well. Thankfully it didn’t explode, but the trick didn’t fix it either. Maybe I should try throwing it against a concrete wall next?\n\nSo another week has passed at camp. I was a lifeguard, and will be again next week. Nobody drowned on my watch, for which I’m thankful. The only event of note was on a tube float…. one guy got this large hook stuck in his heel! Apparently some aspiring Captain Ahab missed his Moby Dick, only to later, in a roundabout fashion, harpoon a 22 year old human! What’s worse is the hook was attached to a line which was snagged at the bottom of the river. So this fellow was struggling to tread water against the current! With some fanfare we freed him, after one of our number produced a massive knife which he had been swimming with for just such an occasion. Our saved victim was appreciative, and after getting him to shore the hook was removed, only having buried itself in about 1/2 inch.\n\nIn between snatches of this and that I’ve managed to do some reading.\n\nAlmost finished the book, Haiti: the Tumultuous History – From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation. It’s enlightening, but soo depressing and makes me feel angry at Hatian’s crooked leaders.\n\nAlso read a shorter work, The Light Princess, a fairy tale by George MacDonald. It was clever, funny, and fun. The protagonist reminded me of at least one person I know. The chief lesson was that love is the only thing which can bring back into harmony laws out of balance.\n\nIn other news, in my last post I gave my current camp address in hopes of receiving more letters, and it worked! I got a letter! It was from the brother of my brothers’ brother-in-law. So that was exciting. I also got a cheery e-mail from Seth, an older brother of my father’s youngest son.\n\nOne day last week I lost both my Bible and my toothbrush! Can you believe it? I was again reminded of my propensity towards absent-mindedness. After these losses, the quality of both my Bible reading and my teeth began deteriorating. Later, after much searching, both essential items were found (though not in the same place) which made me happy.\n\nI heard a series of messages this past week on King David and how he had a heart after God’s own heart, even though he had failures in his life, some of which were dramatic. These messages were quite encouraging to me (and convicting), and when they get posted online I’ll link to them here. Some main points were that David wanted to know God and actively sought after Him, that he owned up to his mistakes when confronted regarding them, that he was obedient in obeying God, and that he wanted to be where God was and for God to be where he was.\n\nOff subject…. after spending a lot of time with kids this last month, I’ve got to thinking on the topic of “maturity”. What is maturity? I Googled it and the following definition appeared:\n\nThe state, fact, or period of being mature.\n\nBrilliant, Sherlock.\n\nMy definition would include being serious, something I’ve noticed is outside the realm of possibility for many teenagers (especially guys), not to disparage the odd anomalies.\n\nIn the OZARKS, where the Internet is RARE, and the heat is BLAZING\n\nHere at Turkey Hill Bible Camp, finding internet is like finding a burning bush on the North Pole, it just ain’t happening.\n\nLast weekend I didn’t even have time to post a single jot or tiddle on simplefollower. Making up for it now by posting twice in one fell swoop. Impressive, I know.\n\nSo here I be at McDonald’s in Jeff City again, my standard portal into the interwebuhshphere. Camp ended early this week: Friday instead of Saturday. That’s because this past week was the final Youth camp of the summer and an extra day is given for cleaning up the facilities before Family Camps begin.\n\nI didn’t counsel last week but instead was on, “Grounds Crew.” We worked on making a new trail down to the lake and other such illustrious activities like weed-wacking, cleaning bathrooms, and raking leaves.\n\nThe best part of last week was the staff Bible study sessions. We spent an hour each morning and an hour each afternoon in the Word. We used various study techniques like summarizing (we summarized the book of Ephesians), looking at structure (looked at Revelation chapters 2 & 3), examining key words (John 15), and word studies (so do you know the difference between reprove and rebuke? or do you know what the word “Saved” really means?). It was fun and I learned some things.\n\nBeing at camp these past three weeks has been a big spiritual recharge for me. Mainly because I’m in the Bible so much, and around others who are like-minded.\n\nI haven’t done much other reading, unfortunately. I’m currently wading through a History of Haiti, which is fascinating. The history of Haiti is more complex (and bloody) than I realized.\n\nThe only book I’ve finished so far at camp has been Grandpa Jack’s, From Tarshish to Ninevah. I’d link to Amazon, but don’t think he has it up there yet. I enjoyed his stories and especially hearing about his faith in writing. It got me thinking about my legacy of faith and how, in a roundabout way, it had an inauspicious beginning many years ago with a farmer sharing his faith with Grandpa. I even mentioned that story (and the book) in a staff devotional I led one morning last week.\n\nLet’s see, what else can I write about? The news. Well, my knowledge of current events and news is dismal. Someone mentioned a shooting in Colorado and I assumed they meant Columbine, but then later realized there must have been a more recent calamity.\n\nI am, however, not in such a bat-cave as to not know that a new batman flick just premiered: The Dark Knight Rises, or some such. However, I have no interest in watching it, because I don’t like batman, and it looks like a dark movie.\n\nIn other news, I’m being asked (often) what I’m going to do next. I have some ideas, but they don’t make sense (to others), and perhaps not entirely to myself either.\n\nI took comfort in John McHoul’s latest post about our lives being Living Sacrifices. He said, among other things, something may be wrong when our lives make sense. You have to read the whole artivle to get his context, but the gist was that our lives are in God’s hands, and they’re meant to be given up for Him, which means they likely will not look like the “status-quo” deal.\n\nOk, I’d love to hear from you. You being “anyone” who actually reads this, those few and far between people (like my Mom).\n\nI’ve only been checking my e-mail once a week, and hardly using the interwebs at all, which you would think would make checking my mail an exciting event as I get the fun of reading an entire weeks worth of personal letters in one sitting, but there’s a funny phenomena that happens when you don’t write other people: nobody writes you! So my inbox is largely empty.\n\nLuckily, one person sent me a regular letter at camp, which bolstered my spirits. And I hear on the grapevine my niece Kailee also sent me a bonafide letter, which unfortunately got detained in the mail, though I took comfort from her thoughtfulness, and even wrote her back, which was tricky since I didn’t know what important things she had written me about.\n\nLord willing and the creek don’t rise, I should be here two more weeks.\n\nMy address is:\n\nNick Middleton\n\nc/o THRBC\n\n13489 Maires Rd. 301\n\nVienna, MO 65582\n\nWilderness Week\n\nTwo weeks ago (July 15-21) I was one of four leaders on a week-long Current River canoe trip with fifteen teenagers.\n\nHere are a few pictures:\n\n‘\n\nA highlight was the time I spent up late talking with different guys. One night until 2am!\n\nWhen I was a kid (8?) I went on a week long father-son Current River trip led by Tom Richardson. The strongest memories I have of that trip are sleeping on gravel bars and poking my feet on rocks all day because I forgot to bring my water socks (which mom had just bought for me the day before I left). My whole life I’ve felt awful I forgot those brand new water socks on that particular campout (where we all got “Tip-A-Canoe” T-Shirts). Never was there a campout on which they were more needful.\n\nOn this trip I was careful to not repeat history, and carefully packed away my “crocs.” For those who don’t know, I’ve been wearing my trusty crocs nearly continuously for about three months now. Even to such places as church (when I was overseas and didn’t have anything else) and while doing such jobs as construction work (like pickaxing through rock), mechanical work, and plenty of hiking. Crocs truly are versatile, working well for nothing, but getting by for everything. The best part is not having to wear socks anymore.\n\nRemembering the aches put on my 8-year old back by sleeping on gravel bars, this time I packed not one, but TWO sleeping pads for my resting enjoyment. They worked well, and I slept like a dead man, just like I do back home. Which I’m not sure where home is anymore, as I guess I’m technically homeless.\n\nThe funniest thing I saw on the river was a certain man (hillbilly?) doing a back flip off the top of a tall bluff (30 feet?). This fellow was wearing bib overalls (with no shirt) and appeared to be “under the influence”, that is, at least before he jumped. In my opinion he had enough height to do four somersaults, but instead did about 3/4 of one of them, and landed with a perfect belly-buster! Haha, it was so funny. Based on his swearing when he came up, I assume the impact sobered him. At first I wondered if all his organs were ok, but guess they were, probably saved by his jean coveralls.\n\nThe scariest thing I did was swimming back in this cave-room place in the dark in a spring where the water was bitterly cold. For the next half hour of canoeing afterwards (in 100 degree heat) I was shivering.\n\nNone of the kids got hurt, though one ate a minnow. Some kids dared him, and he was about to do it when I walked up, and then he didn’t think I’d let him, but I told him it would probably be fine to eat the minnow, so he did, and, like I suspected, didn’t seem worse for wear afterwards.\n\nSpiritually, I think it was good for everyone. We spent time studying the Bible and each of us leaders shared our testimonies and led at least one devotional time. It was neat seeing certain ones attitudes improving as they were challenged by things they were learning.\n\nThe last couple days you could really tell the fellows were missing civilization. I had a number of them start telling me things like, “I miss my bed, I miss my iPhone, I miss my TV, I miss the internet, I miss my Mom.”\n\nI think being unplugged was good for them and they didn’t get much sympathy from me.\n\nSo that’s my quick report of “Wilderness Week”!\n\nTeen Week Counseling Update\n\nSo I don’t have time to write an update so I’m not going to.\n\nExcept to say Week 1 of camp went by quickly, and is now over. And true to prediction, I am now officially sleep deprived and worn out. But, it starts all over again tomorrow!\n\nSo I didn’t use e-mail or phone this whole past week. Now I’m back in the land of the moderns in Jeff City, but only for a few hours before heading back to booney-ville.\n\nI think everyone was inspired to seek God more through the course of this past week. I know I was, at least.\n\nThe counselor business was tiring: There were ups and downs, some stressful issues, some (slight) injuries, but fortunately for me, at least a well-behaved cabin.\n\nTons of fun was had, most the time. Highlights for me include the laughter and humor I shared with guys in my cabin and also seeing hearts and attitudes soften throughout the week as a result of what they were hearing and thinking about. It was a serious week.\n\nSatan was busy, of course, starting with a lightning strike last Sunday, hitting a tree with several staff underneath, who fortunately were ok, though one had ringing in his ears. Splinters of the tree were thrown up to 60’ away (I measured). The bolt knocked out the camps PA system, which was never fixed and caused scheduling annoyances as a result. Then a main water line broke which shut off water for most of one day.\n\nMoreover, at times I could almost see Satan picking away the “Word of God” seeds being sown. But, Satan try his worst, there was still plenty of good done.\n\nSo tomorrow starts a week of Wilderness Camp, which I’m scheduled to be a leader on.\n\nHeads up for another brief update next weekend!\n\nAround the World in 180 Days (wrap-up post, by request)\n\nI remember more than one night lying in bed late, in the dark, except for a dull street-lamp filtering through cracks in my venetian blinds, feeling restless. Getting up and going for long walks: padding round and round the nearby pond at my apartment with the spraying fountain in the middle. This was about a year and a half ago.\n\nTwas thinking, “I’m tired of here. Maybe I should take a trip. A big trip. Maybe I could make more of a difference somewhere else. Maybe there’s a hungry kid out there on the other side of the globe whom I could give a lunch to. A kid that, if I stayed here, wouldn’t get lunch. Or maybe I would be changed through having my horizons stretched in a wild cross-cultural experience. Maybe I would see reality clearer. Maybe I would see something interesting, at least. Maybe I would see God! Maybe it would be good for me, or perhaps something good would come from it, anyhow.”\n\nIn any extent, I had too many greenbacks burning holes in my pocket to get excited about continuing working a job I was ambivalent towards at best, and downright weary of at worst.\n\nOne night I mustered resolve, packed my car with a sleeping bag and several cans of beans and hit the road, but got sleepy in Western Kansas and pulled over in a field to rest. Next morning I drove back to work and reality. So much for that.\n\nBut then I really did it! quit my job, and after warming up with a western America road trip and six weeks in the Haiti and DR, launched on a six month “vision trip” to some of the furthest flung reaches of the globe. Now I’m back.\n\nWas I profoundly changed? Doubt it, but maybe. Did I reduce my denarii in the bank? Considerably. Do I regret what I did? No. At least not yet.\n\nIf nothing else, after poking around mother earth… she now feels cramped to me, far too small. Airplanes have diminished her girth to survivor status.\n\nSince getting back I’ve had a funny feeling hit me several times, especially at night before I fall asleep: a feeling of my brain being crowded with too many memories. Like an action reel in fast forward: strange people, exotic locales, and bizarre events all race across my mind-screen… causing an overwhelming feeling like I can’t process everything, like the recollections have no context in which to make sense, no appropriate neuron rack on which to hang their tails.\n\nIn short: the proverbial lawnmower deck of my brain is clogged with the wet grass of incohesive experiences, to borrow the colloquialism.\n\nSo I’ve traveled. Got to do fun things, serious things, educational things, religious things, and a few dangerous things (not too dangerous).\n\nA few highlights:\n\nScuba dived in the Red Sea, snorkeled in the Caribbean, surfed in the Indian ocean, and swam off Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. Took a horse full gallop in the Sinai, a boat full throttle down the Omo, and scary mutatos full speed through Africa.\n\nPilgrimaged in the footsteps of Jesus in the Galilee, studied the Bible at the Wailing Western Wall in Jerusalem, and frequented Messianic congregations in Israel. Climbed Saharan sand dunes in simmering heat, punched cattle in the Negev, and drank boiling tea with Bedouins in the dessert.\n\nCame face to face with grinding poverty in Port-au Prince, Addis Ababa, and the Kibera slums. Rode a camel round the Giza Pyramids, a ferry through Venicean canals, and a Land Cruiser through outback bush. Visited remote tribes in both the jungles of Papua and the savannahs of Ethiopia. Went to the source of the Nile in the African highlands, and its mighty exit in Alexandria.\n\nSaw raw Islam in the soaring minarets of Cairo, raw Orthodoxy in the rock-hewn churches of Lalibella, raw Judaism in the yiddish davening of Hasidim, and raw Christianity in the exuberant praise of Haitians.\n\nLived two months within a snipers range of the Gaza strip, visited the border region of Syria, crossed the Sinai, and traversed bandit-ridden northern Kenya. Frequented the epicenter of world tension: the Temple Mount of Jerusalem, and spent time at the birthing place of the Egyptian revolution: the infamous Tahrir Square. Got a haircut in Tahrir square too (thought I’d throw that in). Arrived in Sentani, Indonesia during a time of political unrest.\n\nExperienced the exhaustion of overnight bus rides, the stress of hitchhiking after midnight (alone), the frustration of being unable to communicate, and the isolated feelings of rolling into foreign shanty towns.\n\nNumerous individuals and families provided me with overwhelming hospitality and I was the recipient of multiple gifts and special kindnesses. Had my heart touched through friendships made on four continents. Was inspired by sacrificial examples of living and giving I saw in a number of missionaries. Got to rub shoulders with some special folks.\n\nIn the WWII history department, got to see General MacArthur’s Pacific base in Indonesia, tour the USS Arizona Monument in Pearl Harbor, and was deeply moved by the holocaust museum of Yad Vashem.\n\nDid volunteer work in five countries. Put in enough community service hours to no doubt earn the corresponding Boy Scout merit badge.\n\nSpeaking of which, what about that lunch for the hungry kid on the other side of the globe I’d thought about giving before I left? Well, here and there I was able to give some kids lunch, and even a few adults. It wasn’t much, but something… Some I talked with, others prayed with, some were preached to, others just got food, and a few received a Bible besides. So a soul or two out in this wide world went less hungry, at least for a day, because I left home, and perhaps a few got spiritual food as well.\n\nIn travelling over 40,000 miles, the globe was circumnavigated on everything from the back of a bicycle to the back of a transport truck.\n\nI purchased 18 one-way airline tickets which totaled 30 legs of flights. Total cost for said tickets (including the trip to Haiti/DR last summer) was $3,250. That doesn’t seem too bad… got a few good deals from credit card promotions and always hunted for bottom basement carriers when bought any ticket outright. Hence the extravagant number of layovers and flying inconvenient hours sleeping in airports.\n\nSo how much did the whole trip cost? I don’t know, didn’t keep track.\n\nBut I did touch ground in 12 countries, which is a nice number, but with all that somehow escaped falling in love with any cute foreigner girl, of whom I met several.\n\nTrendy stats aside, what have I learned?\n\nThat, my friend, will have to wait for another post. Mainly because I’m not yet sure what I’ve learned.\n\nBut first, time to head off for quality time staffing at Turkey Hill Ranch Bible camp in Missouri! Sleepless nights, here I come…\n\n(note my Blogging may wane as internet at camp is more sketchy than in remote southeast Asia)\n\nI Feel Welcomed Back!\n\nTomorrow I get back to Wichita once again, yippee!\n\nAlready I’m feeling quite welcome. Spent a week with Luke and Sarah out West, and they treated me royally – we had a great time (at least I did!)\n\nThen a short visit to Seth & family here in Texas which has also been good reconnecting.\n\nMy six year old niece Kailee especially has been pulling on my heart strings. She was quite disappointed I couldn’t stay longer, and cried for a good while tonight over that sad fact.\n\nAfter her cry, she wrote me a note which she then came in and put on my pillow. It read, “I’ll miss you uncle nicky” and drawn around were large hearts colored in red. Then at the bottom she wrote, “Nick and Kailee alwis togethr forevr.”\n\nI went in her room and thanked her, and she elaborated that although we couldn’t be together in person forever, yet we could be together in our hearts forever, which I agreed, and promised also to write her better in the future, which she seemed glad of, and reminded me I had only written her one postcard since last time, over six months ago. Yikes!\n\nYes, traveling the world is good. But having family and friends back home that think you’re ok and fuss over you a little is also good.\n\nIn other news… Amtrak\n\nDon’t know if I’ll ever get around to a full “American Train Report,” but suffice it to say I did spend 28 hours riding one from Los Angeles to Albany, Oregon (supposed to be 27 hours, but they got behind an hour along the way).\n\nHere is a 1 minute clip of scenery I took out the observation car windows:\n\nOf all the forms of transportation I’ve ever travelled, which are many and sundry, this was by far the most comfortable, though perhaps the slowest.\n\nThe seats were spacious, reclined, and even had foot rests which kicked up lazy-boy style. There were even 110V outlets for charging laptops, cell phones, whatever (and of course cell phones worked because we were on land versus the air). In contrast to flying, security with Amtrak was conveniently zero, just walk on.\n\nI rode coach on my Amtrak ride. My ticket was $160… versus $140 for Greyhound or $120 for an airplane flight. Yes, flying would have been cheaper, but sans the experience.\n\nTo ride sleeper-class would have cost another $850, which seemed steep to me, but did include free meals and wi-fi.\n\nSo I finally had my last flight in this big adventure: another red-eye affair from Portland to Dallas – left 1:00am and arrived 6:30am. The timing was inconvenient, there was zero leg room enroute, nor any in-flight snacks or beverages, plus I was given no choice of seat location and my tray had advertisements, not to mention while on the ramp we sweltered because they kept the air conditioning off, but hey, it was cheap: $75! You too can get such discounts by flying the ultra low-cost carrier Spirit.\n\nThat flight marks the 30th one I’ve taken in my trek ‘round the world. *whew*\n\nI guess if I’ve learned anything at all travelling, I’ve learned it’s true what Grandpa Belcher always says: “Wherever you are, there you are.”\n\nAnd here I am, nearly back home!\n\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Aloha’s Court\n\nFrom Tokyo to Honolulu was a red-eye flight. Only slept about an hour that night.\n\nThe weirdest thing happened… I left Japan on Wednesday night and arrived in Hawaii on Wednesday morning! Therefore, I was able to do what few people have ever done: live through a day twice. My lifetime has been extended a day. The only other person I’ve known who did this was Tom Sawyer when he went around the world in a hot air balloon.\n\nThe sunrise from my window seat was spectacular:\n\nIt feels good to be back in the US. Even flying on an American airline was a pleasant twist. Having a captain come over the intercom with a strong American voice and wide Texan accent was reassuring: “Wuall Ladies and Gents, welcome to Delta airlines, looks like today we have a strong tail wind and will be arriving 15-20 minutes ‘head of schedule… now I don’t guess anyone will be complain’n about that,” (brother, you’d be surprised) “…so sit back and enjoy the ride.”\n\nWhen flying foreign airlines I’m used to hearing timorous mumbling from the Captains, if anything.\n\nMy whole life I’ve wanted to visit Hawaii, now I have. What larks!\n\nWas in Hawaii 6 days, 5 nights. Rented a bicycle, so that was my modus transportation. Biked around 80 miles total.\n\nStayed pretty busy (unlike Tokyo). Really wanted to go snorkeling, so did. They were renting snorkeling equipment down on the beach for $20/day. Seemed steep, so after hunting around I found a mask and snorkel set for $12 and so bought my own.\n\nHanauma Bay is especially known for its excellent snorkeling so I of course went there. In order to beat the crowds I got up at 6am one day and biked to the Bay (about 12 miles). The snorkeling was pretty good, but it was windy which made the water turbid, visibility only about 20 feet. The fish were brilliant, but the coral didn’t look in the best shape.\n\nSnorkeling aside, I thought Hanauma Bay itself was especially amazingly pretty, and enjoyed sitting on the hill watching the clear blue breakers roll in below:\n\nAnother day I biked to Pearl Harbor (a looong bike ride). In the picture below I’m standing on the USS Bowfin submarine and you can see the USS Arizona Memorial and Battleship Missouri behind me across the harbor. Can’t believe I actually got to visit this place, I’ve always wanted to come to Pearl Harbor…!\n\nVisiting Pearl Harbor is sobering. It seemed a fittingly appropriate site for me to be confronted with upon re-entering America – seeing the final resting place of 900+ seaman entombed in the Arizona is a strong reminder of the ultimate sacrifice many have given for this country’s freedom and prosperity, which I glibly enjoy the benefits of.\n\nAmerica has its faults, and as a Christian my primary allegiance is to God’s Kingdom, but I have to say that (at least in my opinion) America is the best place going.\n\nWhile I was visiting the Harbor, a local high school band came and put on a concert in the park-like area by the outdoor memorials and restaurant. A number of tourists stopped for a minute to listen and then would move on, but right form the beginning I sat down and listened through their whole show.\n\nIt was quite moving to me. Besides the patriotic music, it just seemed classic Americana what with the kids doing normal American kid activities and parents watching on, supporting their sons and daughters by clapping enthusiastically after every number, even if there were a few sour notes.\n\nTo get in the mood, below is a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner given by the combined Military Academies choirs:\n\n[audio:http://simplefollower.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/national_anthem.mp3]\n\nSomething I didn’t know is that when survivors of the USS Arizona die, they can be buried in the Arizona with their shipmates if they request so. The most recent internment was 2011 – there are still 13 survivors alive.\n\nBut back to Hawaii, it was a mixed bag as far as “feeling” like America. It sure was touristy. But then, on the other hand, little things would remind me of home. Like the smell of water in the air from lawn sprinklers. That smell is distinctively American, as most people in other countries can’t afford to waste perfectly good water by pouring it out on their grass.\n\nBesides all the tourists, the tropical beaches seemed out of place for America. But I suppose that’s because I’m from Kansas. If I were from Southern Florida it might seem normal.\n\nSpeaking of the beaches and ocean, I couldn’t believe how blue the water was! I took the following picture from on top Diamondhead Crater that I hiked up one day. Isn’t that water the most azure you’ve ever seen?\n\nSo on Sunday I went to church at a local Brethren Assembly: Waialae-Kahala Chapel. That was a good time of getting recharged and meeting local believers. A young couple there invited me over for supper which was great, that evening they picked me up at my hostel and drove me to their house. Besides the fellowship, the food was great: a chicken dish with fried onions on top, and pumpkin haupia cake for dessert (local Hawaiian)– oh, also raw tuna, which was a new one.\n\nWe had a grande olde time time swapping tales, and they even volunteered to bring me to the airport the next morning, which was amazingly nice.\n\nSpeaking of church, did I mention last week I attended an International one in Jakarta? Yep. It was a very old church (Gereja Immanuel) from the Dutch colonial days. They had an English service.\n\nHere is a picture of the building in 1875, followed by one I took from the same location in 2012:\n\nI found this Jakartan church to be mostly dead, even though it did have a booming pipe organ. But I know it’s not good to base ones opinions of a church on only one visit, so I’ll withhold further opinions.\n\nSo that’s the quick update on Hawaii from this end.\n\nI’m writing this whilst sitting in the Los Angeles airport where I’m spending the night, and it’s kinda boring. 4am right now…\n\nIn a few hours I take a bus over to the LA Union Station where I then catch a 27-hour Amtrak train up to Albany, Oregon. That should be interesting.\n\nThe Shocking Semantics of Culture Shock\n\nSo the powers that be, whoever they are, have determined Culture Shock has four stages.\n\nHowever, I’m not convinced Culture Shock has only four stages, just as I’m not convinced public speeches have only three parts (introduction, body, and conclusion).\n\nI’ve heard speeches before that were all body; I’ve heard speeches that were all conclusion; and I’ve heard speeches that were all introduction. I’ve also heard speeches that weren’t much of anything, and wondered why I was wasting my time listening to them.\n\nIn my opinion: reality defies description. And life is messy. Yet this doesn’t stop the powers that be from putting Speeches and Culture Shock into tidy boxes.\n\nWhen I say the words “culture shock,” I’m referring to that mouth-opening, jaw dropping, deer in the headlights SHOCK one experiences upon seeing certain foreign practices (like electronic toilets, suited people picking up trash with salad tongs, or men in gourds wielding bows and arrows).\n\nMy version of of culture shock has only one stage: shock.\n\nThe four scientific stages of “culture shock” seem to rather describe four stages of “cultural adjustment.” Concisely, they are:\n\nExcitement / Holiday / Honeymoon (0-3 months)\n\nWithdrawal / Negotiation / Anxiety (3-6 months)\n\nAdjustment / Confidence / Feeling “normal” (6-12 months)\n\nMastery / Enthusiasm / Comfort (12 months+)\n\nI love how the stages even come with precise monthly timelines. Shucks, I’ve gone through all four of those stages before in a New York minute.\n\nTake, for instance, the time I saw a group of Hippos down by a lakeside in Kenya:\n\nFirst, I felt Excitement at viewing such monstrous animals sooo close! It felt like I was on a Holiday, perhaps even a Honeymoon (except I was by myself, so not really).\n\nThen, in my Excitement to get even closer, I accidentally touched a high-voltage electric fence separating me from said hippos, which resulted in Withdrawal, Negotiation, and dare I say? Anxiety.\n\nNext, I Adjusted to the situation, standing back from the fence, and after some time even began snapping photos with Confidence, and several minutes later, when the tingling died down in my leg, started feeling Normal again.\n\nFinally, having Mastered the situation, I turned my back on the lumbering mammals and with a satisfied chortle, muttered under my breath, “Veni, vidi, vici,” as I returned to the Comfort of my lodgings.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, that’s the shocking version of Culture Shock.\n\nOn a serious note, when it comes down to it, Culture Shock is simply dealing with differences – first noticing differences, then reacting to them in some manner.\n\nThe reaction may be naively happy (stage 1), overboardily grumpily (stage 2), with toleration (stage 3), or cheerfulness (stage 4). Other reactions include yelling, belligerence, and manic-depression, to name a few.\n\nNow, regarding re-entry shock I’ll refrain on commenting as I’m still re-entering, and haven’t been away from home long (only 6 months) so am predicting a mild case, if anything.\n\nOne of the first observations I did make upon arriving in the USA was how I could now understand ambient conversations again. This was surprising as I’m used to only hearing gibberish from strangers.\n\nThe first time I noticed this was while heading towards the immigration check-in counter at the Honolulu airport. The man behind me was grumbling about how slow the moving sidewalks were: “They just built this wing of the airport, you’d think they could have made the sidewalks a little faster! it’s like half a mile we have to go here and good gracious, we have elderly folks, they can’t stand up forever!”\n\nSorry buddy, it’s only survival of the fittest in Hawaii. Those who can’t stand longer than the two minutes required to reach immigration are gonna get left behind, turns out the only law they follow here is the law of the jungle.\n\nHonestly, I’m thinking to myself, “Only in America do we complain about the speed of the moving sidewalks.”\n\nI Thought I’d Seen it All, Until I Saw Japan\n\nFirst: Language…\n\nMost the signs in Japan are not in English. And their script is scary-looking. See for yourself, here is the title of this post in Japanese:\n\n私は日本を見るまで私は、私はそれをすべて見たと思った\n\nAnd the people don’t speak English either, hardly a one. Even at the airport, nobody can barely say a word of English! even the customs guy…\n\nMost places I’ve been in the world I’ve noticed a pervasive element of trying to copy things in the West. But I don’t detect that here in Japan, it seems like they’re doing their own thing, setting their own trends, and have no need for English or Western technology.\n\nSecond: Serious Garbage-a-phobia..\n\nI only visited Tokyo, but I was blown away at the cleanliness! I used to pride myself on being a citizen of the cleanest nation, but America now takes a distant second place to Japan (at least downtown Tokyo). Yet personally, I’m still going to stick up for America because I say we have just the right amount of dirty, it proves we’re “real” and not trying to hide anything. What you see is what you get. Going to Tokyo is like visiting someone’s house where everything is so spotless, immaculate, and perfect you think to yourself, “Is this for real! do they live here??”\n\nWhere else can you find trash picker-upper people cleaning the sidewalks dressed in slacks and a collared shirt, searching in vain for an odd candy wrapper to delicately remove with a pair of salad tongs??\n\nI kid you not, the first time I saw these guys picking up the non-existent litter, I did a complete double take, stopped walking in mid-step in literal astonishment, my mouth wide open. Just stared and gawked, I couldn’t believe it.\n\nHere are a few pictures I took:\n\nAnother thing I don’t get is how people walk around here with a dust mask on (not everyone, but some). It looks silly. And there is no smog here, that I can tell. Of all the cities I’ve visited, in my opinion this is one of the least necessary cities to be wearing a dust mask!\n\nThirdly: Non-Hazardous Sidewalks and Street Crossings\n\nImagine my surprise upon seeing (and walking upon) sidewalks like this one:\n\nAfter wandering around in developing countries, I’d gotten used to the hazards associated with walking down the “sidewalk.”\n\nFor instance, here is the main thoroughfare in Sentani, Papua, which, by Indonesian standards is a fairly decent sidewalk:\n\nWhen walking on sidewalks like those above, you have to always be looking down to make sure you don’t fall into sewage or trip on a rock.\n\nFourthly: Complexity…\n\nI like to think of myself as being capable of navigating the ropes of modern civilization without inordinate confusion. But not in Tokyo. Things here are much more intricate than anything I’ve ever been exposed to.\n\nThe subway system, for instance. I’ve taken subways and trains in several major cities without too much trouble (buying the ticket often the hardest part). But in Tokyo, figuring how to get from point A to point B using the subway system requires a guy to be a veritable rocket scientist! Check out this subway routing guide:\n\nCompare to the Cairo subway routing guide below, which was hard enough:\n\nFifthly: Totally Techy Tokyo Toilets\n\nThings are SO complex here that in order to just figure out how to use the TOILET, you practically have to be a brain surgeon.\n\nI kid you not, look at how many buttons and controls were on this toilet in my low-end hostel:\n\nAmerican toilets have one lever. Israeli toilets have two. But the Japanese toilet is a high-end, complex, cutting edge electronics gizmo. With all the training plumbers must need, I bet they get paid well.\n\nAnother surprising feature my toilet had was a sink on top (which was awkward to get ones hands under):\n\nWho’d have thunk about putting a sink on TOP the toilet?\n\nAnd here I thought the sink I once used in Kenya (below) worked just fine. The on/off handle was a valve teed off a water pipe and the drainage went to a bucket underneath.\n\nMy Japanese toilet was so complex, I had to Google a “how-to” guide just to figure it out. This article was helpful, here are some revealing excerpts:\n\nMost toilets in Japan are electronic appliances with a range of features for comfort and cleanliness. At the high end, these toilets have dozens of functions, configuration options and buttons…\n\nElectronic Japanese toilets range in price and features. The most common features are deodorizers, noise makers (for privacy) and heated seat (often on a timer). [A timer!? they have set times for going??]\n\n[Regarding another feature, the disturbing “bidget”]:\n\nThe electronic bidet may have a wide range of controls for water pressure, temperature, pulsing modes, etc. However, to operate it you just need to stop and start it.\n\nMy gosh! deodorizes, noise makers, heated seats, bidgets! what direction is the human race going? Where will this all end? The complete sissifying of the human race, that’s where it will end.\n\nFrom having just come out of the jungle with a stone-age tribe who didn’t even have toilets, much less heated ones, the contrast is mind boggling. (where the jungle folk DO use the bathroom is a mystery, but presumably in the jungle somewhere)\n\nSixthly: Exorbitant Cost…\n\nIn Tokyo I’m having sticker shock. Like massive sticker shock – so bad I reverted to cooking up ramen noodles in the hostel kitchen rather than eat out.\n\nI’m not alone in my opinion, this LA Times article from two days ago reports Tokyo is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates to live (with New York City #33 on the list, if that gives some perspective).\n\nExamples:\n\nChocolate Sundaes from McDonalds cost $2 (compared to 40 cents in Indonesia).\n\nEating out nearly anywhere sets you back at least $10.\n\n$8.50 for one issue of a “Time” magazine.\n\nLodging: I stayed at one of the cheapest hostels in Tokyo, sharing a room with 8 bunks, and it cost $35/night, the most expensive of any hostel I’ve ever stayed at. In comparison, Israeli hostels were usually $15-20/night, Egypt $4-$10/night, and even Honolulu, where I’m staying next, is only $23/night.\n\nOther Observations\n\n1) Guess I’m experiencing a little culture shock. Which is to say I’m noticing cultural differences. Isn’t that what culture shock is? Becoming aware of little cultural differences that before were such common place occurrences they escaped notice?\n\n2) It doesn’t seem like there is much to do in Tokyo. I’m kinda bored. Good thing I’m only staying a couple days. There are lots of museums, but none of them sound interesting. The one closest to my hostel is “The Bag and Luggage Museum,” which nearly puts me to sleep just thinking about.\n\nThe only touristy place that sounded really cool was the Hama Rikyu Botanical Gardens located downtown. I like gardens so went, and with high hopes of spectacularity, I might add.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a misnomer. Something was lost in translation: it was merely a park, not a garden. A nice enough park, but precious few flowers, just trees and manicured lawn. Comparable to Riverside in Wichita.\n\nOne cool thing the park did have was a genuine mountain. Yep, Mt. Shinhinokuchi is located WITHIN the park. Behold! Mount Shinhinokuchi:\n\nPerhaps something else was lost in translation on the signage? Looked to me more like a grassy knoll than a mountain.\n\n3) For one meal, I wanted to eat authentic Japanese food. Who wouldn’t? To this end I asked a local worker at my hostel what she would recommend? Her answer was a resounding, “Takoyaki!” That is, fried octopus tentacles. So, I tried them. Even ate all eight of my tentacles. They tasted better than I was expecting, but were chewier than I liked.\n\n4) Surprising to me is how reserved and “keep-to-themselves” the Japanese people seem, at least in public. For instance, on the subway nobody hardly ever says a word to each other or even appears to acknowledge each others presence.\n\nOn the flip side, this also means nobody is “hawking wares” or bothering me. To wit, they taciturnly ignore me. To the point of ridiculousness, I might add.\n\nDuring my travels I’ve kinda trained myself to pretend I know where I’m going even if I don’t, because in many places showing the slightest hesitation is the equivalent of blood for piranhas: resulting in being pounced upon by some opportunistic entrepreneur offering to help (for a trifling fee).\n\nHere in Tokyo, I’ve pulled out my map in public and studied it and people walked on by, not giving me any notice. So then I decided to play it up and see what would happen. I tried looking really confused (not hard) and walked around in circles on the sidewalk, squinting over at street signs and staring hard at my map in complete befuddlement. All to no avail, Japanese locals kept walking by as if I were the invisible man, giving me no more attention than a passing breeze. Incredible, I couldn’t get any reaction.\n\n6) On the flip side, when I’ve actually bought something, the politeness is a little over the top. Purchased a bottle of water at a gas station the other day and the diminutive checkout man began jabbering away at me in what appeared to be a rapture of delight while putting his hands together in front of himself and repeatedly bowing in respect. I felt honored.\n\nThe End\n\nps I’m finishing this post up here in Hawaii, where I am now. So the content is a little dated, but better late than never…\n\nNext: Nick’s Aloha Report from Honolulu (Summer Edition)\n\nJakarta Ho! A Somewhat Sagacious Soliloquy.\n\nI’m currently in the capital of Indonesia. It feels oh-so Asian. And fairly Muslim too, though I don’t find the locals here as intimidating as their compatriots in the Middle East.\n\nWith over 10 million citizens, Jakarta is populous. But Indonesia itself is populous: the 4th most country in the world (behind China, India, and the US, and only a fraction of the size of those three countries).\n\nI think they call Indonesia the “sleeping giant,” and I believe it: walking around here I’ve seen quite a number of people sleeping on the sidewalks. One sleeping guy was sprawled across three motorbike seats! Now that’s sleeping class.\n\nSpeaking of motorbikes, they’re everywhere. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them. From what I’ve seen, it’s the same throughout Indonesia. And from what I’ve heard, it’s the same throughout Asia. Someone is getting rich off selling motorbikes. Probably someone in China.\n\nJakarta is nicer and cleaner than I was expecting. It’s also quite Western in many ways. You can even find sundry Western restaurants. Such as McDonalds. Another positive thing is that food here is cheap. For instance, my supper last night was $6, but for that moolah I bought a lot: French Fries, a Big Mac, a Coke, a Chocolate Sundae, a Domino’s Pizza, and a Sprite. (my pizza was topped with diced hotdogs which may help explain why it was so cheap.)\n\nThe McDonalds was 3 stories tall and packed to the gills with people. I could only find a seat downstairs, outside, in the heat, amongst the smokers. (there was a seat open inside by the bathrooms, but it stunk there something royal so after enduring about 30 seconds I moved down with the smokers to gulp in secondhand tobacco along with my Big Mac.)\n\nAnother odd thing about my McDonalds experience was being the only non-Indonesian in the restaurant. Being a minority feels weird.\n\nIn fact, being a minority is one thing, but many places I’ve visited around the world (including Jakarta) I’m not just a minority, I’m an oddity! It’s a little unsettling to be gawked at like an orangutan in a zoo. Sometimes people even want my picture. Like today, this random girl wanted her picture taken with me, which I consented (she was cute enough), but the odd thing was she was obviously Muslim, covered from head to toe in nineteen yards of fabric, with only her face showing… I wouldn’t have thought someone so modest would be forward to the point of trying to get her picture taken with a complete stranger. But she did, and then I got my picture taken with her entire extended family (who were also there) and with her extended Jakarta clan (who were also there). Someday in the far future her great-grandkids will be flipping through photo albums and be like, “So who’s the white guy?”\n\nIn other news, I have roommates here in my hostel. One of whom is a long-haired Russian about my age with a prodigious number of tattoos. Another is an Indian (from India) and lastly, an Indonesian from some remote island.\n\nSo the Russian and I talked last night. I asked him what he thought about Putin, and he told me he thought Putin was a blankety piece of blank, but despite that, was great for the people, and he supported him. Along the lines of politics, he also told me he once lived in Portland, Oregon, and his biggest observation from there was how he got weary of hearing so much anti-Bush sentiment. And he assured me he hated Bush as much as the next person, it was just that after awhile it was like listening to a broken record.\n\nSo today I visited the Monas, a massive monument to the independence of Indonesia. It looks kind of like a gigantically anemic ice cream cone stuffed in the ground upside down:\n\nNote from the above picture there is smog here… not much, just enough for certain locals to walk around wearing dust masks.\n\nAt the base of the monument (underneath the ground) there is a vast open room, gloomy, filled with people, and exhibits lining the walls detailing the history of Indonesia gaining its independence.\n\nI noticed the exhibits weren’t all complimentary of their former Dutch occupiers. For instance, one plaque read:\n\nThe Forced Planting (1830-1870)\n\nThe people in Java were forced to grow plants which produce commodities being much in demand in Europe with a view of overcoming the financial crisis suffered by the Dutch as a result of popular up risings in Indonesia. Subsequently, the farmer had no time to cultivate their own and the result was general famine. On the contrary, it helped to make the Dutch prosperous and secure.\n\nSurrounding the Monas is a spacious open park, pleasantly landscaped. Today there were thousands of people thronged there, primarily families enjoying a nice, relaxing outing.\n\nUnfortunately, there is litter all over everywhere. To combat this problem, I observed numerous sanitation folks in orange suits sweeping up and bagging garbage.\n\nI wondered why there was so much trash on the ground in the first place, but once I got to looking I noticed there were hardly any trash cans. I thought to myself, “Self, if they just installed some trash cans here, they wouldn’t have to pay all these cleaner-up people to fight this losing battle.” But then the cleaner-up people would be out of a job, so I suppose the system makes sense at some level.\n\nI also visited the Indonesia Ethnological Museum today. I found the Papua exhibits most interesting, and even learned more about the Kotekas (mens “gourds”). There was a helpfully informative exhibit:\n\nThe museum had a bunch of old golden crowns too (some even inlaid with diamonds). They dated back some 500 years, and one had over 4 lbs of gold! You weren’t allowed to take pictures in the “treasures” area, so I just have to remember what they look like up in my brain. But seeing the headpieces made me wonder what sort of people wore them? The plaques claimed old Indonesian rulers wore them, whoever they were (probably long gone by now). But isn’t it interesting to try to imagine what type of pomp and ceremony those mysterious crowns must have seen?\n\nThere were also exhibits of old bones that were supposedly “missing links.” In America I’m sure there is a rule against displaying live skeletons in a museum, and especially out in the open like they did here!\n\nWell, Jakarta Ja-smartuh, soon I’ll be in Tokyo, this stint here is only a glorified layover. And my stint in Tokyo will be short too…\n\nThe bad thing about being somewhere briefly is everything is a “first,” which means there is a steep and frustrating learning curve for getting around and finding places. For instance, now that I know where the bus station is and how to find the Monas (and McDonalds), it’s already time to leave!\n\nI’ll end this post with a trivia question: Can you guess what the sign below is instructing the reader NOT to do? (it’s a sign from inside the airport)\n\nSorry this update wasn’t more spiritually uplifting… maybe it at least made you smile, and the Bible does say, “A cheerful heart brings a smile to your face; a sad heart makes it hard to get through the day.” (Proverbs 15:13, the Message)\n\nLuxury\n\nI’m back in Sentani. Good ol’ civilization. Even if it’s third world civilization. Even if it’s “wild west” civilization.\n\nDave, who picked us up at the airport, told about how he got stuck in the middle of a local demonstration yesterday in Sentani, including having a guy in front of his vehicle wave a pistol around and shoot a few rounds off over his car roof! Wow, pretty intense. After dodging down a side street to safety, he holed up for awhile where he could hear military and demonstrators duking it out – he estimated a couple hundred rounds were fired. With all that shooting, fortunately only two people were killed.\n\nDemonstrations like that don’t happen real often, and since one just happened it should be awhile before another happens. At least, that’s my theory. I think what the ruckus is over is Papua wanting its independence.\n\nSo let’s see, besides all that excitement, which I missed, I’ve spent the afternoon and evening of today enjoying the finer points of luxurious civilization. Such as…\n\nA hot shower. That is, for a good two minutes, before the heat gave up the ghost and the water turned cold again.\n\nUnlimited electricity, it even stayed on all day! they tell me it’s been spotty here of late (and since it’s always spotty, that must mean it’s been really spotty).\n\nFor supper I had a “western meal” of a chicken burger with avocado juice. Delectable, even if the avocado juice wasn’t “western.”\n\nDrove in a car again, now that I’m back in the land of such novelties as “streets” and “stores.” Though not in the land of “traffic rules.” That is, the only rule is: “There are no rules.”\n\nFor expediency, my driver drove on the wrong side of the road for about a hundred yards, into oncoming traffic. We survived.\n\nSuch luxury am I now enjoying that, unbelievably, I even have air conditioning in my bedroom! And my room is even rat-free, I think (though definitely not ant-free).\n\nBeing chilled again is such a delicious feeling. Until I had to go back outside and was shocked by the heat and skeeters, which, hitherto, (before ten blessed minutes of air conditioning) I had been used to.\n\nDrank deep from a can of Coca-Cola. Ahh, wonderful Coca-Cola! Used to never like the stuff, but since weaned off Dr. Pepper (it’s been like 6 months since I’ve had a DP – may its carbonated soul rest in peace) I’ve turned to Coke to fill the void. But, I’ll say, it’s like the replacing of a favorite dog which has died with a new dog: though there is now a soft spot in my heart for the new dog (Coke), there will always be a deeper soft spot in my heart for the old dog (Dr. Pepper).\n\nAs you can see, I’m drinking deep of luxury. Even having the time to write this silly blog post is a luxury.\n\nThe conveniences we take for granted back in the States are, for most people in the world, over-the-top luxuries. Even the air conditioning I’m enjoying right now would be pretty rare for the average person here in Sentani, but I’m in a missions guesthouse, which has its perks (and this is a mission known, rightly so, for it’s frugality).\n\nBeing with the Moi reminded me how dispensable the veneer of civilization really is. I didn’t know it was possible to live without a supermarket down the street until I spent time in cultures with open air markets instead of supermarkets. But the Moi take this to an entirely new level by eating only fruit and vegetables picked from the jungle or out of their gardens, supplemented by the odd rat, snake, or frog (and occasional chicken or pig). Nary a plastic wrapper or rusty tin can to be seen.\n\nThat such disparity in living habits could exist on the same globe boggles my imagination.\n\nFor two off-beat examples, nowhere in my travelling have I seen the equivalent of a “drive-through” restaurant, or an automatic garage door opener. Those are distinctly American novelties.\n\nIn Bali, I saw a few gated beach resorts, but even those gates were not automatic, but manual. A bored guard holding a long rope operated them by hand.\n\nAnd to think of all the things I consider a “need” (like a digital camera, a laptop, the internet, a car, several pairs of clothes, etc) … when in fact it’s quite possible for me to survive without even a shred of it!\n\nObserving other cultures invariably leads to making fun of other cultures: “The way they do this or that is dumb!” But, after awhile, you start evaluating your own culture a little more objectively too, and say, “Ya know, the way we do this or that back home is kinda strange as well.”\n\nFor example, “Why does everyone live so spread out and alone, by themselves, in the States?” Good or bad, it’s not how most people in the world do it. Even in the Moi, I saw a one-room hut that was a “bachelor pad” housing some five guys. All in about the size of the living room of my old apartment, which by American standards was considered too small for even two people (I mean the entire apartment, not just the living room!).\n\nThe other day I heard someone say, “People think it’s expensive to live in America, but that’s not true. What IS true is that it’s expensive to live like an American.” I would agree. As a case in point, I often see Westerners overseas living at standards below what would be considered average by American standards, but still far higher than nearly any local could ever afford.\n\nThe gap between what is required to keep a human being alive and the way many people live (particularly in the West) is a gulf so wide it defies my cognitive abilities to grasp.\n\nAnd I’m not trying to be accusing of others here, I myself own two vehicles, two boats, a storage unit filled with boxed stuff, furniture loaned out to relatives, and a backpack full of products that alone probably holds more value than what nearly any single person in Ethiopia has to their name.\n\nThis morning on the flight out of Moi-land I read through 1 Timothy and was struck by where Paul said,\n\n“But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.” (1 Timothy 6:6-8)\n\nPhysically, when it comes down to it, all we need is food and clothing. Everything else is extra. And if you ask a Moi, they’ll say you don’t need much clothing, just a gourd and piece of string will do. Or for the women, a grass skirt.\n\nI think for us in the West there is often a temptation to chase after extra, non-essential physical things in life to the detriment of working on other legitimate human needs, like those on the emotional or spiritual fronts.\n\nIn closing, I ask myself, “Am I sad to have left the Moi tribe?” The answer is: yes. But I think who I’ll miss the most are the Brown family. Especially the three young kids (8, 10, and 12 years old) – we had a lot of fun together over the last six weeks! Just this morning, before I left, we fit in a few last games of “modified-UNO” and a “crazy trampoline photo-shoot.”\n\nAs I was getting on the plane in the sticky heat, I stopped to pause and take one last look around, and would you know it but a bumble-bee bit my leg!! I kid you not, it stung like crazy. Luckily, Steve Crockett was there, and since he’s related to Davy Crockett, I let him dig the stinger out. Then I got in the plane before another bee could bite me.\n\nClashing Civilizations\n\nOften my most creative writing thoughts come at an inopportune time for recording said thoughts. One such time is just before drifting to sleep. Like now, but this time I gave in, got out of bed, and pulled out ye old laptop to jot down a few sundry thoughts. I’m not sleepy anyways.\n\nI’m still in Moi-land: a veritable rainforest if ever there was one. Laying in bed underneath a mosquito net listening to the interminable rain drumming away on a tin roof above. Think it’s rained every day since being here: usually starting in the evening or at night. Then each morning wakes bright, sunny, and fresh (and blazing hot).\n\nIt’s so hot here, in fact, that sometimes I sweat prodigious quantities. Like this past Tuesday when I went on a “picnic” down to the river with five other Moi guys (none of whom spoke more than 3 words of English, and one of whom, incidentally, killed another guy once).\n\nFrom the time I left the house to go on the “picnic,” until I returned, was seven hours. Here’s a picture of my sweaty self after the first hour of hiking. I don’t think I’ve ever been so sweaty before, but out in the rainforest there is simply no wind to evaporate the moisture:\n\nNotice the flash had to be used, even though this photo was taken midmorning on a bright sunny day? That’s because the jungle was so dense the light was murky. I used sign language to instruct my obliging photographer to hold the button on the camera down until the “lightning” erupted.\n\nTo me, the hike down to the river (and back up) was grueling, even though it wasn’t a long hike, only about an hour each way. Recently I re-read the incredible book, You’ll Die in Singapore, where the author, a WWII POW escapee, hiked for months through this same type of jungle while at the same time evading Japaneese patrols, fighting malaria, and living off local roots. I can’t even imagine!\n\nSo the Moi guys cut out a walking stick for me shortly after we started. This helped considerably as I attempted to keep up with them on the treacherously slick and steep terrain. The trail varied between a 45 degree muddy angle and a 80 degree muddy angle.\n\nLater, upon returning alive, I was given a compliment (through a translator) that they considered me a strong hiker and were impressed at how I kept up. This cheered me some, until I was also told Supiah can get down to the river in fifteen minutes flat, four times speedier than we slowpoked it! So my “fast” and “strong” rating was relative, and on the generous side. They also said I was at a disadvantage in wearing shoes, unlike them, who go barefoot.\n\nSome of the scenery enroute was stunning (if one could get enough sweat out of the eyes and enough air in the lungs to enjoy it):\n\nDown at the rushing and frigid mountain river we spent a luxurious several hours splashing, swimming, jumping in, cooking food, eating food, and getting cooked by the sun and eaten by leaches. It was a grand time.\n\nThe latter experience (the leaches one) was n"
