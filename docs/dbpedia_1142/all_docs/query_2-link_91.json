Get the Sound Sleep Alchemy Album! The Sound Sleep Alchemy Album was born from inspiration of my own, clients’, friends’, colleagues’, and family’s struggles with stressful or restless sleep, insomnia, waking up in the middle of the night, night terrors and nightmares, and more, as simple sleep hygiene tips did not always work. In my own experiences of terrible insomnia, I needed to go deeper to get to deep sleep; to the root. I am happy to share that I now have restful sleep and when I don’t, I have ways to support myself. Enjoy this culmination of many ancient and modern traditions including Somatic Experiencing, yoga tantra, Ayurveda, spiritual and energetic practices, scientifically-informed and embodied healing techniques, Chinese Medicine, and Family & Systemic Constellations. 🎧 Show Notes: 00:00 Intro 01:15 Opening 03:30 Lessons in Acceptance 04:41 Full on Gardening Mode 05:17 My Voiceover Work and Tongue Twisters 06:47 Main Topic: Momentum and Density 08:08 Working on my Romantic Relationships 09:35 Why is it hard to let something go? 10:18 Momentum 15:03 Enjoing all the time? 16:08 Where in your life do you recognize Momentum? 18:23 Density 19:55 The Importance of Acceptance vs Identification 23:37 Watching my Healing and Shifting into Wholeness 26:12 About Gardening: Bambooing 29:59 The Sound Sleep Alchemy Album\n\n189\n\n189\n\n189: When Tunnel Vision Can Help\n\nListen | Blog Post | Duration: 23 min 17 sec0:23:17\n\nTunnel vision can get a bad rap — but it can be so helpful when you need it.

How I learned about the Wisdom of Silence in my ancestry… A reason I was shy when I was younger… And revealing why I felt unspeakable loss when I was young. About [reverie] on The Embody Podcast: Spiritual Succulents The sweetness, agony, delight, joy, freshness, and fullness of what is — This is Beauty. Here is my ongoing attempt to embrace the All — all that is — including the depths of the unseen yet known, in a Life of Beauty. [Reverie] emerges as a creative outlet for pieces of me, experiments, parts of process, artistry, in any form that honors or interacts with Being. Conversations with the pulse of Life itself… with Beauty. They are gifts from Life to me and to you if it is for you to hear. As a play with the dimensions of Being, I invite you to listen as if you are speaking and all the same, as I am speaking. Without pressure to make sense but to let what wants to flow into any part of your being do so freely — to get LOST. Enjoy in your own way.
