        "text": "Links, Key Quotes, Notes and Resources\n\nConnect with Meredith\n\nMore about DIA\n\nMeredith’s *first* podcast about turning around the “ocean liner” that was the DIA global meeting:\n\nMinute 9\n\nWe talk about how meetings have a personality\n\n“I was always in tune with the personality of the meeting that I was doing”\n\nMinute 11\n\nHow events start way before people walk into the doors, physically or virtually.\n\nMinute 17\n\nMaking a decision to be virtual or to cancel a flagship meeting in June during the first shutdown in March.\n\nMinute 20\n\n“I'll never forget April 8th, because that's my email went out to the program committee, that this change is happening. We can no longer hold our meeting. The DC Convention Center became a field hospital. We have to go 100% virtual, don't panic.”\n\nMinute 23\n\n“It was important for me that when you clicked in, I started referring to this at the virtual convention center. And when you logged into my lobby, you felt like you were at DIA, even though you were sitting in your dining room, or your home office, or in the kitchen, that you felt like, \"Oh, this is different. I'm not watching a recording of something, I'm actually interacting with people. There's a way to connect with people. I'm still viewing content and speakers from around the world,\"\n\nMin 31\n\nThe “old way” to Hybrid: On “the bridge” between virtual and IRL meetings\n\n“before COVID, really, when you heard things like a hybrid meeting, it meant that there were sessions that were live streamed out to maybe the website of the company or association, and that you could log in and be a part of the virtual audience that's watching a live session happening and groups that did it, well would have that moderator, that would be typing in the chat back to the virtual audience, and during a Q&A would address the speaker and say, \"I have a few questions from the virtual audience.\" And that would be the bridge. And that was like really fancy. That was wow, they're live streaming sessions, which is great, because they get that reach. They brought in another audience that couldn't travel, and that was it.”\n\nMin 35\n\nFlipping IRL and Virtual: Two experiences and one meeting\n\n“the way I see it is that the virtual platform still has a place. It still needs to be embraced, and we need to create environments for two audiences, ... two experiences but one meeting.\n\nAnd so you're going to have, when we're allowed to convene large groups. You're going to have a smaller group in person than you would have had probably a regional audience, it's going to have to be socially distanced for us.\n\n“So I look at it like this, I have an audience in the physical space, I have an audience in the virtual space, and both audiences need access to each other, and the content that's happening in each place.”\n\n“I want this to be, if you are on site, you are still going to have access to the virtual platform, so you can tune in to see what's happening there, what kind of networking is happening there, what sessions are being offered there, potentially watch parties, if I have, speakers that could not be physically in person, it may be the reverse. I may have a gathering of folks in an area tuned into the platform. So the reverse is happening, where the speakers are living in the virtual space, there's a virtual audience that's in the platform with them, but now I have a moderator connecting folks from a physical location and checking in with their iPads and phones, and so it's both ways, it's happening now.”\n\nMore About Meredith\n\nMeredith Kaganovskiy is a certified meeting professional, digital events strategist and Senior Project Manager of the DIA Global Annual Meeting.

Thank you for making the time to have this conversation with me.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt's your second podcast interview. I'm excited. So, okay, let's go back to the beginning. Can you tell me your origin story? Like how did you become a Certified Meeting Professional? Ladies and gentlemen, if you've never met a Certified Meeting Professional you're about to. So I mean, how did you find yourself on that path?\n\nMeredith:\n\nI fell into it. I did not know this was a path when... so you start out in college, and you decide your majors, and at that time in my life, I was majoring in marketing, and I was minoring in...\n\nDaniel:\n\nYou can do it.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI can't even speak. I'm so excited. I had a minor in fine arts-\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt is Friday, by the way, in your defense, we just talked about how yesterday felt like. What was it? Little Thursday? No little Friday?\n\nMeredith:\n\nOh, Friday Jr.\n\nDaniel:\n\nFriday Jr., that's what it was.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYes.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt's like dinosaur Jr. [crosstalk 00:01:36]-\n\nMeredith:\n\nEvery day feels like a week, especially if you're working from home with your family and you have school aged children like I do.\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah. So, you're all good. As you are saying.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI'm all good. Look at this back on track. So I decided I'm going to major in marketing, I was going to do a minor in fine arts, Rutgers was like, \"Oh, that's interesting, we haven't had that before. Not sure about that.\" And I said, \"Well, I am. I know this is what I want to do.\" I was very interested in graphic design and new product development, and while I'm on campus, I'm starting to get involved in different student organizations. And when I say involved, for some reason, I can't just be a member, I end up on the board, because I'm like, \"Let's do this, I have this idea,\" and before I knew it, I was bringing students together. I was organizing activities on site. I was drawing up budgets and defending them to student activities. I was founding organizations, we were having fundraisers for those organizations, and I did not know this was a career.\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd then, it's that time where now you have to find a job, I am now competing with 9/11, with folks who have masters, and who are now seeking jobs, and I'm just out of college, and I started seeing event planning and meeting planning, pop up, and I did an internship for meeting planning, and it was awful. I was just booking dinners for doctors in all different restaurants, and I was like, \"If this is meeting planning, I'm out.\" I'm looking to create an experience of some kind, and, learn about what goes into an event, and I'm just making reservations at this point.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo I just had to go back to my marketing roots, and I applied for a job, at an association management company, which I had no idea what that was. I just knew that I worked with a lot of student groups, and they're like associations. So I applied for their marketing position. They saw that I had a meeting internship, and said, \"Hey, we have an opening for an assistant meeting manager, what do you think?\"\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd I said, \"Oh, well, I really would like to have a job\". So, I went in for the interview, and I had to answer a lot of questions about marketing, because I had so much marketing on my resume, and I said, \"It was a great event, marketing\". If you have a great experience, and you met other people, aren't you going to talk about that? So that's where my marketing side comes into the play. And nonetheless, I showed them all these floor plans that I designed and how I took over the Campus Center where I set the buffets up, how I got Q102 radio station to come on campus and be part of the entertainment and they were like, \"This is great, you're hired\". And I've never looked back.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo I've been in meeting planning for over 16 years now, I've always worked with associations and non-profit groups and I love it, I love their mission, I love that I can be a part of their mission, I found myself on medical meetings, the medical side a lot, which is really funny because if you know me, I can't get through any medical show whatsoever. I have so much respect, I could never be a doctor.\n\nDaniel:\n\nYou can't even watch the medical shows.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI can't even watch it. And here I am working for transplant groups. And some of those slides are extremely graphic with those, the organs and all that, so-\n\nDaniel:\n\nI can only imagine.\n\nMeredith:\n\n-it was just ... it's really funny that this is who I'm working with. But I get to bring people together. And they're helping each other to save lives. So, I just fell in love with my place in this. And I've learned a lot since then, and I now continue my work in non-profits, where I am now, we have the full spectrum of life sciences. So I've gone from the working with medical, the medical practitioners, to now working with the regulators and the pharmacy companies and the academics, I feel like I've had the full circle now, and it's just wonderful, and I love it. This is who I get to bring together.\n\nDaniel:\n\nSo interesting. So I mean, I want to just double stitch on that, because you mentioned it twice. It's clear that a core value for you is bringing people together. You just sort of did it reflexively in college, and now you do it professionally, which is really cool.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI love that. I've always felt that in a situation where there's a lot of people gathering, like in an event, for example, I always felt like I was never in the moment, I was always watching, observing, seeing the interactions that were happening, and I always felt like, \"Why am I so weird?\" But, in meeting planning, that's my role. There's a place for me, I get to reflect on the environment that these folks are coming to now, and design against it, and for them. And so I get to bring people together and I just love it.\n\nDaniel:\n\nYou do this for fun top, do you like, I mean, I don't know if you remember parties, back in the day, and the before times. Did you throw parties? Are you a party thrower?\n\nMeredith:\n\nI do like to host. Yeah. I do like to host, I'm the person in the neighborhood who is inviting everyone over, family dinners, and for the big holidays, we do a big, we did, we used to. We would do a big Rosh Hashanah dinner, and most of my friends don't celebrate Rosh Hashanah, but they all look forward to coming to my house. We would have 20 folks at extended tables. And so yeah, I do, I love bringing people together and celebrating.\n\nDaniel:\n\nWhat is the most important Rosh Hashanah food in your perspective?\n\nMeredith:\n\nOh, I might go with the kugel.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIf you don't know, I mean, you offer, is this sweet kugel or is this?\n\nMeredith:\n\nYes. The sweet noodle kugel.\n\nDaniel:\n\nNoodle kugel. You're making me like you're ... like there's memory tears well, they are in my eyes. If you don't like raisins, it's a hard road to hoe, but they kind of just they plump up in the kugel and they're delicious.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYeah. I love a good... like the sweet cheese, and the raisin kugel with... and it has to be the extra wide noodles, don't tell my mother-in-law, because her version of it, bad. And my mom actually likes apricots in hers.\n\nDaniel:\n\nThat's outlandish. Dried apricot?\n\nMeredith:\n\nThe dried apricot.\n\nDaniel:\n\nThat's a type of Jew I've never met. That's fascinating. This is like where they talk about... and this is a total side bar, not necessarily relevant to what we're talking about. But food is our central to experiences. It's a focal point. We talk about it, we talk while we're doing it, with our mouths open. I love this vision of the conversation around the kugel, and whether it's the right type of kugel too, to convene around.\n\nMeredith:\n\nWe can have a kugel debate.\n\nDaniel:\n\nWe can. We can have this whole, like I just turned this whole thing into a conversation about Jewish food, but I don't know about that would be really interesting, only a very small section of people. So, one thing that I heard, which I did not know about you is that you had a background in fine arts. And I heard you say something about how events are like marketing, and so this overlapped. But I'm also wondering how you feel like events are like art, what is the art of bringing people together? What is the art of creating a powerful experience?\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd there's so many facets to that. I will tell you, I am not one to rinse and repeat for... so when I worked with an association management company, for example, I worked with a variety of different associations at the same time. So they're at an association management company so that they can share stuff. So usually they're very niche groups. They're not stand alones, like DIA where I am now. But even in DIA, we have so many niche portions of our membership, because we're the full spectrum of life scientists, even then when I worked in the specialty meetings for DIA, I was always in tune with the personality of the meeting that I was doing. And I didn't try to the [crosstalk 00:10:20]-\n\nDaniel:\n\nThe meeting's personality, the meeting has a personality to you.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYeah. It does. The people who come to the meeting, right? It's for them. So I want to gear it towards them and not make it just, oh, another meeting. There are some practical things that all meetings are going to have, right? You're going to have a place where you view the presentations, for example, but how you view them, that's where the difference is. And so I would play with things like that. I would play with... when we just talked about food and how important food is, to some groups, it's really a key thing, and for other groups, it's not. So I was always designing in mind of who was coming to these meetings and these experiences, and so, when I worked with the heart failure nurses, I would design all their food and beverage around them. So, they could practice what they preach, so we would have, instead of the traditional coffee cake at coffee time, I would have some crazy flaxseed muffins, happening with recipe cards available, to take back with them.\n\nDaniel:\n\nSo it's the little touches that-\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt's a little, yeah, it's the little things. I knew they were coffee addicts, which I could totally appreciate. And so, I would have funny [crosstalk 00:11:41]-\n\nDaniel:\n\nThat's your breakfast every morning, as we established before we ...\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt's my go to breakfast. So I'd have fun signage about coffee, like not before my coffee and caffeine and... that they would appreciate, that made sense to them that made it fun for them to be on site. If I knew there was this meeting was like a reunion to a DIA global annual meeting, it's very much like a reunion. And so we plan different elements so that you can spend time with your colleagues outside of session, in addition to being in session. And I think that's the key differences is, is knowing, you've heard the saying, know your audience.\n\nMeredith:\n\nBut if you want to keep people looking forward to your event, before content is even released, you have to be thinking about their experience from the moment they, if you're talking about the physical event, the moment they walk in, and what their journey is going to be. If you're talking in, you really want to go a level up, then you're talking about from the moment they know about your meeting is going to happen, and what that whole cycle looks like leading... now what's the lead up? What's the build up to your event, and they get to the event, they experience the event, and then what happens after the event? Like what's this relationship look like?\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah. The whole cycle.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThe whole cycle. And that's something I take a lot of joy in stepping back from and looking at, and thinking about what experience do I want these folks to have? Even before, they walk in through my doors.\n\nDaniel:\n\nI feel like this may be the artistry part is, is there's a real balance between all of these elements. If you just focus on the big picture, I feel like you miss the care that goes into crafting these individual moments. But if you just obsess about crafting the individual moments, you can lose the whole work.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYeah. Sometimes you have to focus on the big rocks before you fill in with all the details, right? I had a mentor tell me that once. One of the things I love though, is when you come on site, you feel like you are in... so if we're talking about the DIA global annual meeting, you feel like you're in DIA. You walk in it-\n\nDaniel:\n\nMaybe we should talk a little bit about that, for people who don't know what DIA is, and what kind of work it does, maybe you can share a little background about that.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSure. So DIA stands for the Drug Information Association. We are well over 50 years old. And we bring together the full spectrum of the life sciences community. That is everyone who, works in pharmaceuticals, regulatory, the academics and the researchers, the patients, all different aspects of the life scientists community. And we say we're the crossroads of science and passion and when we come together at the global annual meeting, it's just amazing to see folks who touched so many aspects of life sciences working together. So I will see the folks who are in regulatory spending time with the folks who are our statisticians, who are in the research realm or our patients, are visiting the patient track or they're going to the safety and pharmacovigilance track. They're gaining perspective outside of their own interest areas, at this meeting. So it's just-\n\nDaniel:\n\nNow, and can you give people a sense of the size and scope of this annual meeting?\n\nMeredith:\n\nWe are about 7000 people, and we are out five days, that's about a five day meeting. If you count the pre meeting, short courses, that happen.\n\nDaniel:\n\nWhich we do obviously.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo, there's the pre-day, but we have a big Sunday for us, we do a big opening plenary to kick off the meeting on Monday, and then we run straight through until Thursday afternoon.\n\nDaniel:\n\nWhen did you realize that that meeting was endangered by the pandemic?\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo this meeting means a lot to our society, to the portfolio work. We have meetings that happen year round, our specialty meetings, we also have annual meetings and specialty meetings happening in other countries, we have offices in other countries, but the global annual meeting is the biggest meeting.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt's like the culmination of all the other, all everything sort of comes together.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThat's what I say. I call it the culmination of all the work that is being discussed in our specialty, whether you're on this in the States or across the pond, we have had all those conversations are converging at the global annual meeting. So, end of February, going into March, it started to become a concern. Now because we have offices that are in Europe, and are in Asia, and so we're hearing firsthand from folks who are experiencing COVID, before we are. So come March, we were having some pretty major discussions on the impact this could have. And on that time, if you remember, everyone was talking about, \"Oh, a 14 day shut down, and then everything's gonna be okay.\" It's almost laughable now. And so, June, could be a whole different picture, this is the June meeting.\n\nDaniel:\n\nRight. So there was some optimism of like, well, maybe...\n\nMeredith:\n\nWell, exactly. And, going into making decision, also like what's the convention center doing? So, our office that plans the global annual meeting is in the Philadelphia area, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey, were being quite aggressive with their plans for protecting folks with COVID-19, which I love, you too, right? Because I'm in New Jersey, you're in New York?\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo I was happy to see that, but DC, where the meeting is being held, they're a little bit more relaxed and getting there, DC, Maryland, we were watching very closely those states to see when are they going to start shutting down more things? Is this going to affect the convention center? Can we cancel the convention center? These are all conversations that are happening, and, we're trying to literally keep things as is in that moment, because we didn't want folks to get too wrapped up in talking about it.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo, we almost came to a standstill on the planning side, where we slow down the communications with the program committee, and the speakers because we didn't have answers. We were just trying to assess what is actually happening here. How bad is this? I mean, I remember being told don't wear masks, stop buying masks, the meds need it. So, we didn't have a full grasp of how serious this was. And by the top of April, it was okay, we're making the decision to go 100% virtual, which is eight weeks out from the go live date for this meeting. And at that time, we are now, what does that mean to go virtual? Did we even have a solution? You cannot do a 7000 person meeting in Zoom.\n\nDaniel:\n\nNo.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI mean, we're talking about, I have over 300 sessions that take place, there's a full exhibit hall, there are networking sessions that are happening, there's all kinds of events and activities associated with this meeting. How do you translate that to a virtual experience now, at the time virtual meetings were webinars. The large streaming-\n\nDaniel:\n\nWhich your company did?\n\nMeredith:\n\nWe did, yeah. And we did webinars, but, webinar, I would say 200 folks maybe, to attend a webinar. But, how do you recreate what folks know and come to love at DIA in the physical sense to the virtual. We were lucky enough to have an existing vendor, who is our general service contractor, who said, \"Hey, we started working on a virtual platform\". And what is a virtual platform? So we, start looking at the demo, what this site does, it's basically a website that has the ability to do presentations through sessions, for example, and create session rooms and create virtual exhibit halls and kind of like a virtual concourse.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo we started, moving that way, and I'll never forget April 8th, because that's my email went out to the program committee, that this change is happening. We can no longer hold our meeting. The DC Convention Center became a field hospital. We have to go 100% virtual, don't panic. We are going to get through this. And, soon after that, we realized that we needed to touch base with the speakers and chairs to see can we still participate in all this? What's happening in real life right now, everyone's life's being turned upside down, there was no expectations that everybody would be able to participate, when I say everybody, we're talking upwards, 6 to 700, speakers, chairs, and so we began the process of surveying, who can still participate, from that we started to rebuild the entire program, because not everything could be translated and go to the virtual platform.\n\nMeredith:\n\nMy committee did that within a three week time period, and we had about six weeks to build, and then execute this meeting. So there was a lot of learning and doing at the same time, and then my favorite doing then learning at the same time, because this is how I'm imagining this working, and hoping that I am guiding a lot of people in the dark right now. And asking them to trust me that we're going to recreate something in a virtual realm, that's going to be similar to what you know and love about DIA.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt's heavy stuff. I know,-\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt is.\n\nDaniel:\n\n-it was a really intense moment.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThat's when we met.\n\nDaniel:\n\nThat's when we met. I mean, what was that experience like for you? I mean, I feel like the conversations that you and I had with Robin, working through some of these questions of how to design the experience, they were hard questions, there were a lot of unknowns.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYes, there are lots of unknowns, the uncertainty was palpable. And if you can imagine meeting planners or type A plus personalities. We like to have everything in its place, it's verified, it's nice and ready, there's no question. And now I am adjusting to being okay with the amount of uncertainty that exists and showing my okayness so that I could reassure the folks that were following me, that we were going to be okay. And so when you and I met, I felt it helped center me, because I am flying an airplane in a hurricane that needs to be rebuilt, while in flight. And, when we would meet, you would say, \"Okay, put that aside\". All the technology and the translating, and you would say, \"Let's talk about moments of truth,\" for example. What makes DIA, DIA? And from there, what can we bring into the virtual meeting? That was one of my favorite conversations, was looking at that arc, and looking at what can I not lose by doing this, and I'm glad we did that because it made the difference in this just being some kind of virtual experience to transporting people to I feel like I'm at DIA.\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt was important for me that when you clicked in, I started referring to this at the virtual convention center. And when you logged into my lobby, you felt like you were at DIA, even though you were sitting in your dining room, or your home office, or in the kitchen, that you felt like, \"Oh, this is different. I'm not watching a recording of something, I'm actually interacting with people. There's a way to connect with people. I'm still viewing content and speakers from around the world,\" our philanthropy project, we kept that we tied it into our exhibit hall gamification, and so that was important, because there were so much going on at once. Everything felt like it was on fire or a priority. And so this would be, I think you referred to it as, like a respite, from that.\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah. Honestly, I'm really glad I was able to, the time was a bit of a buffer, in the insanity, like you said, to slow down, and to just focus on the experience of the people. I feel like one of the biggest aha is, you kind of tipped to it much, much earlier in our conversation. I remember when we were sketching out the experience arc, and there was this idea of they have arrived and they feel like they're in the right place, this amazing moment of coming in and being like, \"I'm here, and I feel like, this is where I want to be.\" And that's such a huge and important thing, especially with virtual meetings, because there's so many distractions, I remember, what was the thing that you all did with the tell your dog, you're on vacation?\n\nMeredith:\n\nOh, that genius, that letter came from Kurt who works in our marketing team. And he wrote an open letter to his dog. And when I saw that, I wanted to give a snarky response from my cat. And I just thought it just spoke to acknowledging the world that we're now living in. We're not working at home, we're working with home. And so I loved that acknowledgement of the time that this is happening. And folks, we did accomplish, I mean, folks felt like they arrived. It's like they reached DIA, and they were cheering us on. We knew this hadn't been done like this before. We're very upfront about the newness of it and what we were trying to accomplish, and for the most part, it was achieved. It was just amazing, once we got underway, I was like this is happening. This is really happening, and then, behind the scenes, kind of felt a little normal. I mean, with the exception of the fact that I'm on three different computers and my cell phone, talking with teams, talking with staff who are monitoring sessions.\n\nMeredith:\n\nTo me, that was almost like a sense of normalcy, because when we're on site, there's AV issues. We can't find a speaker, it was just doing it in a different way, and it felt like we were sitting in the same room somehow, even though we weren't all different places, all different states. And it was just very surreal. This was all happening, and you could see people interacting with the platform and what you created and finding their way. And for a meeting planner, when you see attendees finding their way, finding their tribes, of people that they connect with, it's like the most amazing moments, it's the super bowl for a meeting planner.\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, this is going back to the beginning, like the joy of convening, the joy of bringing people together. One of the things that I remember coming out of some of your work, I remember you brought the range of conversational spaces that you were creating this PDF that sort of showed people you brought that to one of the coaching calls, to try and communicate to people that there would be these large experiences and these intimate experiences and I feel like one of the things you did really, really well was to create so many different types of opportunities for people to connect.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThat is my favorite infographic. I'm very visual. There's the other art side, no surprise, I like to see things. And so the infographic that we designed, it showcased all 9, 10 different learning formats that we have, but it organized it in a way that was from, we call it passive, so that it was like a large audience. So it's passive/large audience and that's your opening plenary session where you would see a keynote, for example, and you're sitting in the same room as thousands of other people. All the way down the line, to the more interactive sessions that are small, and so that would be like your round table discussions, for example, or viewing a poster presentation. Poster presentations at the very end, because a lot of times, that's a one-on-one connection that's happening. And it just shed all the range in the middle. So if you went to a content hub, it's a 30 minute rapid insight session with 30 to 50 other attendees in a casual environment.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo we highlighted the environment, audience size, the type of learning, whether you're going to be passive in listening or active in you're actually speaking and have a voice in that session. So that folks can mix and match and design, what met their needs. The way I learn is different than how my neighbor learns. And so we want to give you that opportunity to experience learning your way. But also, I have to say that when you have thousands of people in a convention center, it can feel lonely. Sometimes you don't know how to connect with other people or find people who have the same interest as you do. And so I became this campaign for the inroads. How do we protect inroads? How do we help people cut through the thousands of people. And that meant creating activities like the round table discussions or an engagement exchange where no more than 50 people can participate, and you're sitting at a table with nine other colleagues working on a problem together. So that's the fun part. That is, designing all these different ways for folks to engage with one another, and the content and their learning, because our meeting very much is about learning. Yeah. That's what we do.\n\nDaniel:\n\nI want to talk about how all of this translates into this next uncertain world that we're stepping into, the potentially hybrid world. And I feel like there's fewer patterns of what success looks like. I feel personally, when everyone is digital, it puts everyone on the same footing. And we all remember, I remember, trying to run workshops where we're all in person, and there was like one or two people who were like, \"Can I call in?\" And I'm like, \"No, you're going to have a terrible, terrible experience. Unless we dedicate somebody to carrying you around on a laptop, and being your hands and moving the sticky notes around.\"\n\nDaniel:\n\nAnd that was a really degraded experience, for those people. The only way they could participate is if they got help to get access. What's so interesting about the all virtual world is that it allows everyone to participate across the world, it allows people to participate if they have mobility issues of any type, it really feels like we've made everything more accessible. And what I noticed in hybrid is that it feels like an accessibility issue. The people who are... if there are fewer people remote, and there's more people in person, the people who are remote, feel excluded, because they can't participate in the same ways. There's an imbalance in the capacity to participate. And I can feel this is, I don't mean to trigger any emotions for you. This is like, what are you thinking is going to help bridge some of these experience gaps?\n\nMeredith:\n\nYou are right on. I too turned away folks that wanted to dial in to my workshops, because I knew it just wasn't designed for that and you would not be happy with the experience. So right there with you. And before COVID, really, when you heard things like a hybrid meeting, it meant that there were sessions that were live streamed out to maybe the website of the company or association, and that you could log in and be a part of the virtual audience that's watching a live session happening and groups that did it, well would have that moderator, that would be typing in the chat back to the virtual audience, and during a Q&A would address the speaker and say, \"I have a few questions from the virtual audience.\" And that would be the bridge. And that was like really fancy. That was wow, they're live streaming sessions, which is great, because they get that reach. They brought in another audience that couldn't travel, and that was it.\n\nDaniel:\n\nAnd the moderator would help bring their voices into the room.\n\nMeredith:\n\nRight. And that was the bridge, and that was hybrid meeting and it was like, okay, they have it or they don't. Well, now-\n\nDaniel:\n\nBecause it was sort of a nice to have.\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt was nice to have, yeah exactly.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIn the old world. Yeah. It was a plus.\n\nMeredith:\n\nIt was a plus, and so with COVID-19 happening, meetings and everything just being shut down, it really pushed the agenda of this virtual realm, expanding into meetings, small and large. It was always unknown that, this was a possibility, some folks were actually doing it, limitedly it wasn't the preferred way. And the technology wasn't quite there yet. And so, I like to say, we survived the first wave of virtual meetings, we did a really quick turn, we made it through, now we have a lot of experience to bring in with us into our 2021 planning. And that's right now, we're really designing a meeting that didn't exist before. We can't, I mean, could you do the hybrid as it was? Groups are going to do that. But the way I see it is that the virtual platform still has a place. It still needs to be embraced, and we need to create environments for two audiences, but one experience or two experiences but one meeting.\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd so you're going to have, when we're allowed to convene large groups. You're going to have a smaller group in person than you would have had probably a regional audience, it's going to have to be socially distanced for us and our research, we're working heavily with the convention center to figure out how many rooms can I run, how many people can I have on site, and I know I'm going to either offset that with the virtual platform, so that I can A, offer close to the amount of content that I traditionally offer, and B, bring in the audience size that we traditionally have, or maybe more because that reach, like you just mentioned, with the virtual.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo I look at it like this, I have an audience in the physical space, I have an audience in the virtual space, and both audiences need access to each other, and the content that's happening in each place. And for folks, because you can't see me on you're listening to this, I have my hands crossed, because I'm also, I'm so visual, I'm showing my hands are crossed in two different directions.\n\nDaniel:\n\nSo you want there to be some, cross pollination between those two audiences?\n\nMeredith:\n\nYes, 100%, I want this to be, if you are on site, you are still going to have access to the virtual platform, so you can tune in to see what's happening there, what kind of networking is happening there, what sessions are being offered there, potentially watch parties, if I have, speakers that could not be physically in person, it may be the reverse. I may have a gathering of folks in an area tuned into the platform. So the reverse is happening, where the speakers are living in the virtual space, there's a virtual audience that's in the platform with them, but now I have a moderator connecting folks from a physical location and checking in with their iPads and phones, and so it's both ways, it's happening now.\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd so those are the kinds of discussions that we're having, because I need folks, I want folks to have access to everything in both places, and to feel that they can tune in to something that's happening live in the convention center, but also tune in to what's happening live on the platform, and also playbacks and different chat room opportunities and different lounge opportunities, also with social distancing, as well, we may have folks that are more comfortable sitting in a lobby or their hotel room tuning into a session if they feel there's too many people. So that's what we're exploring right now, and I'm used-\n\nDaniel:\n\nI'm sorry for interrupting you, because you said, one idea in two different ways. And I just want to clarify, which one do you think it is? Is it two audiences in one experience? Or is it two audiences and two experiences?\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo, to me it's two experiences, but one meeting.\n\nDaniel:\n\nThat, okay. Thank you. I get it now. Two experiences, but one meeting.\n\nMeredith:\n\nYeah. So I need to pay homage to what is capable in the virtual platform to make it the best virtual experience for that audience, but also, for the folks that are physically in the building, we need to make their experience, great too, and make adjustments and maybe different offerings to safely convene.\n\nDaniel:\n\nSo why bring physical back in? If it adds complexity, why not just double down on virtual and take what you've learned, and make it better? Make it bigger, because I know that the platform originally, limited the number of speakers you could have, there's no reason to have that limitation going forward. You could just make a better virtual meeting.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThat's true. And, that's not off the table, because we are investigating all different scenarios right now for 2021. I think it comes down to, there are a couple of considerations that are at play here. One of them is, replicating the hallway track. That experience-\n\nDaniel:\n\nYeah, we have a lot of conversation about that in our coaching calls...\n\nMeredith:\n\nyes we did! Because that is the most difficult to replicate, that feeling of I just went to a session and leaves a room and I'm going to talk to people. I'm going to see people and I'm going to share my excitement. I'm going to physically convene with someone, meet them, I'm going to go to the exhibit hall and connect with exhibitors and solution providers. Replicating that in the virtual spaces is very challenging. There's also the engagement level. You're not as immersed in what's happening at the meeting, because you didn't actually go somewhere. As much as I want to transport you, you're staring at your screen, you're interacting because your colleagues are all eye on you, your dog or cat has come into the room, a child, so you're more likely to get up, go do something else. And when you're physically in a meeting, that's less likely to happen.\n\nMeredith:\n\nSo folks, I think, miss that, they miss taking that time away, from their everyday to day, to be somewhere else to learn, and to reconnect with colleagues. On the exhibitor side, the exhibitor experience has been very challenging. Exhibitors feel, when they are in person, and they're more connected with our audience, and this is in general, because I'm hearing from all different organizations, and what they're experiencing. And so, in general exhibitors, they miss that face to face connection.\n\nMeredith:\n\nThey miss being able to showcase their personality, right? And how their booths are built, how they're designed, what attracts people. When they're in the virtual environment, you may have a page listing of all of your exhibitors and you see their logos, but it's not the same. They've now almost been equalized, in a sense. So that's definitely, when we are looking into making this decision, we're talking to all our stakeholders. So we're talking to exhibitors, we're talking to attendees, we're talking to speakers and planning members and leadership, because it's such a big decision, on whether we are able to go, even consider hybrid. And the other part is there's financial implications too.\n\nMeredith:\n\nMany organizations are contracted years out. A meeting our size, is contracted years in advance. And so, there's that as well. I would say at the top of our list is safety though. That will be its priority one, regardless. I do think that if groups aren't able to go hybrid in 2021, you will see that in '22, because I think the virtual component is still going to be with us. I think being with large groups of people it's going to take a while to re-adjust back to that.\n\nDaniel:\n\nIt's such an interesting roadmap. One thing we haven't talked about, and we're running short on time is, the planning conversations. Talking to all these stakeholders and facilitating this dialogue, to get to agreement. Who gets to make the ultimate call? With the consideration that you need to have all these stakeholders on board. You're facilitating some pretty big conversations with these people.\n\nMeredith:\n\nWe are. We're doing focus groups, we're doing surveys. Ultimately, we are doing, we are on the ground, talking with stakeholders. We are documenting all of their feedback, we're preparing reports, summarizing their feedback, we're doing risk mitigation plans and risk assessments, and all of this is prepared and handed over to leadership where they will continue the conversation with our board of directors, and that's where the decision will be made. I'm privy to the front line and having all these conversations and being able to factor in their thoughts and feelings into my plans.\n\nMeredith:\n\nAnd right now I'm planning for two scenarios, right now, at the same time with my Planning Committee, I'm very transparent with everything and why we need to plan this way, and, when we're looking at making decisions, and here's what we need to do in the meantime, because our timeline for content is now. This is a big moment. For our program, we are selecting sessions, that will be in the 2021 program. I meet next week with my program committee, that's 60 volunteers, servicing 13 different educational tracks, and we're guiding them into making the best possible decisions for their tracks, we've implemented caps and how many sessions they can have, which is new, but they understand that we need to have some guardrails up so that we can manage more what we have to plan with, so that I can safely do a hybrid meeting, and or go all virtual, and we're trying to plan once and not have to redo the program again. So...\n\nDaniel:\n\nWow. For other people who are listening to this, any sort of parting thoughts? What haven't we talked about that is important for people to remember if they're thinking about, as I'm sure many people are, this hybrid future, that's coming up, what some sage advice from someone in the trenches, such as yourself?\n\nMeredith:\n\nI would say plan virtual first, even though you are considering a hybrid, you know you can guarantee the platform is going to happen. You can't guarantee that the physical meeting component is going to happen. So the way I look at it is what are my capacity for sessions in the platforms? And how can I organize my tracks, my educational tracks, and I know if it will work in the platform, I can make this work in the physical space, too. I'm actually earmarking what sessions would go to the physical space if we can make that happen, so that I'm not making adjustments to the program itself, but I would plan on what you can count on versus so make sure will work in the virtual world, with the hope that you can put some of this into your physical space and then live stream it back to the platform.\n\nDaniel:\n\nPlan on what you can count on. I love that. And, I'm really leaving with this two experiences, one meeting. I'm sort of what's bubbling in my mind is it sounds like you're talking about Virtual PLUS. Right?\n\nMeredith:\n\nYeah. Yeah, especially I guess Virtual PLUS, I love that, because, whether you are physically in the building, or virtually attending, there's going to be the plus of connecting with one another, and the activities that are happening in another place, so, I think that adds some excitement, to what we're trying to do.\n\nDaniel:\n\nMeredith, I really, really appreciate you sitting down and talking about your wisdom, your experience and your journey. I'm grateful for the time.\n\nMeredith:\n\nI am too, thank you. Thank you for asking me to share my story and the work that we're doing that the association is doing, and I hope it does help other planners out there in their journeys to figuring out what's next for meetings.\n\nDaniel:\n\nI think it will.\n\nLinks, Quotes, Notes and Resources\n\nFind Fred on Twitter @FREDDUST\n\nA video trailer for the book\n\nHis book on Amazon.\n\nThe origins of brainstorming\n\nMin 7\n\nI don't consider myself a facilitator. Certainly, I can facilitate conversations and that's what I like to do and I like doing that, but I really consider myself a designer of conversations. What that means is it allows us to kind of step back and say, “I don't have to be the one, I don't have to be in the conversation. The conversation can be successful.” Often what I'll do is I'll design structures for conversations where somebody else entirely can run them.\n\nMin 8\n\nwhen you start to think of conversation as an act of creativity or if you don't self-identify as somebody who's creative as an act of making, so just like something that you can make, everybody's a maker of some form or another. It allows you to say, “Wait a second, I don't have to just be a victim to this conversation. I can make the construct of the conversation. I can make the rules.”\n\nMin 11\n\nDining rooms became vestigial in America... Often dining rooms became offices and other things. Then not only that, gradually we put TVs everywhere and so in a world where the last thing… Not to get too intimate, but how does having a television in your bedroom affect your… If you have with your partner? The last thing or first thing you're seeing is something.\n\nMin 20:\n\nHave as few rules as possible\n\nRight now I would say, what I'm finding is four rules are often even too much because I think I had a limit of four. I would say given our brain's capacity during COVID and during the political strife and just this, the social moment we're in and our fear and anxiety, I'm pretty good with two.\n\nMin 32\n\nAgainst Active Listening\n\nThe point is we've adopted active listening and put it into places it was never really intended to be. It was not meant to be the primary language of human resources, HR. It was not meant to be a boss's way of not listening to the complaints of a person who reports them and that's how we use it now. We use it as a way of signaling a subtle form of agreement but not really.\n\nMin 49\n\nOn encouraging the world to start designing conversations...and taking time for self care!\n\n“You can do this.

Thank you for making the time for this. I really appreciate it.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI'm delighted. You and I have been talking about this for, I don't know what, like a year and a half, two years so-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah, and thinking about it for a longer. Well, before we get really into it, the first thing I wanted to do is actually, in your book, you talk about keeping a notebook of conversations, tracking examples of conversations that triggered ideal outcomes for us. I wanted to generate some principles for designing this conversation using some inspirations. One of your inspirations is one of my favorite meetings which is the breakfast meeting.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYes.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nCan we talk for a minute about why you like breakfast meetings?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah, and I'm trying to think Daniel. I know we met, we've met over tea I think. But usually the way that I, my preferred way to meet and sorry to be, to wax a little nostalgic would be to go to Balthazar. Because Balthazar was sort of the, Balthazar in New York, in SoHo was sort of like the perfectly timed breakfast. I don't know if you used to go there for breakfast at all, but it's a… I'll back up [inaudible 00:01:38]-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\n[crosstalk 00:01:39] black nostalgia, go for it.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah, of course. Balthazar is amazing. It's like red little booth. It's like if you've been there like a regular as I had for like pretty much 10 years, that meant that you always got the same booth that you wanted.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI always could face the clock so I could always make sure that we were running on time. There’s a giant clock on [inaudible 00:02:03]. The wait staff there is phenomenal. They were just like there, there was never a moment where they missed a meeting and so you knew your conversation would never go more than an hour. The reason I like it is that the first 15 minutes, breakfast happens typically, people have probably done their first round of emails, haven't gotten to the real hell of their day yet-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat will replace like physiologically, it's a great time, our minds are quite active. That place specifically had a very lively atmosphere, but you could still hear people so you, it boosted your energy levels. Then it's like the first 15 minutes is just chit-chat like what you and I had before we got onto this recording and then there's about 30 minutes of like, “Okay, what are we doing? How can we help each other? What's the work?” Then the bill comes and you have a very easy excuse to kind of wrap everything up and you're out. I say that by all conversations, if you're lucky, you're out five minutes before it's supposed to end.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBreakfast is just like, I think kind of the ideal circumstances. Like we actually had to remove this specific reference to that because breakfast can happen anywhere. It's like it’s-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt doesn't have to be Balthazar. That it just happens to be the place where I've seen the magic really, really work. Maybe I can stop though. The finding of the conversation notebook is, at first it was like a conversation journal or a conversation diary and I was just like, “Yeah, not so much.” Because it's like some people are journal, there's, some people are not. It's like… I really was like, “What's the most common denominator?” It's like just a good notebook of inspiration is a really good place to start so.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWhat I loved about this idea is this idea of generating principles and taking inspiration from multiple places. The other one I think you mentioned was the symposia.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nRight.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWhich I really loved when I was a teenager. This is weird and perhaps unnecessary amount of detail, but I actually arranged a series of, we call them conviviums because that was another sort of format of the-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nRight.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nThe coming together, the sharing of… The reading of poetry and the deepening of discussions and the job of the person to spread around the wine in an intelligent way. To not over-serve or under-serve people.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. No, it's like… In essence, the book is my conversations notebook, right? Because it's basically all the things that I've drawn inspiration for but yeah. I have the good fortune of being… In fact, I was on the phone with him on Friday and will be on the phone again with him Wednesday. He's helping me with a dialogue typology or conversation typology that I'm building on crisis conflict and bridge building and between communities. But what's interesting is I used to go to his symposia which we’re in Greece and they were typically on an Island.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nLike last year it was going to be in, on Samos which is a Greek Island and then you could swim across the Turkey and we would host another one in Turkey, the Turkish town there. But I always felt like the formal parts of those, because it was famous economists and politicians and whatever, the formal parts were fine. The informal parts then happened in the evening over wine and relaxing on couches and whatever, those were phenomenal and those are the pieces that he really crafted based on the ancient symposia. I think what he did that was different is he let women in, right? Because-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nSure.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nAncient symposium, we’re not allowed to have women. They were obviously, they were men of all class, interesting, in the ancient Greek Polis and artists to politicians, to the highly wealthy, and it was just like gender was not allowed. But another thing that George also does is he has children. Children and family are allowed to run around and what that does as you know is having children around does two things, it both boosts the oxytocin levels. If you've got children laughing, you have the love hormone triggered in your brain which is amazing.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhich is why children and dogs are great to have, but also he sort of believed that children were a good reminder of our future, right? If we were talking about the future of, in his case, he's a Democrat which in his context is social democracy. It's like very, very, very progressive politics. But having a child in mind as you're thinking about climate change shifts, the way you have the dialogue in [[inaudible 00:06:45] so.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nThis is how deep the rabbit hole goes in terms of being intentional about the kind of environment you're creating because of the kind of conversation that you want to have. You kind of paint this tension of many of us are maybe look at conversations as we are participants of them and instead we can be makers of them. Why is it important to you that we all see ourselves as makers or potential makers of our conversational spaces?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. I think it's really interesting and Daniel I think you and I would agree which is that, I know we've had this conversation like I don't consider myself a facilitator. Certainly, I can facilitate conversations and that's what I like to do and I like doing that, but I really consider myself a designer of conversations. What that means is it allows us to kind of step back and say, “I don't have to be the one, I don't have to be in the conversation. The conversation can be successful.” Often what I'll do is I'll design structures for conversations where somebody else entirely can run them. In fact, I've been doing that for the last couple of years by establishing the rule sets so that it actually feels fair and just and safe for everyone.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThe reason I think that's important is that when you start to think of conversation as an act of creativity or if you don't self-identify as somebody who's creative as an act of making, so just like something that you can make, everybody's a maker of some form or another. It allows you to say, “Wait a second, I don't have to just be a victim to this conversation. I can make the construct of the conversation. I can make the rules.” That's true even in situations where you feel like you can't. Two things, Daniel, one is, as you know from the book, in many cases, the conversation is already scripted, right? Like by the spaces that we have in conversation-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nBy the default patterns and rules that we’re working and living with.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat's right. If I say board meeting to you, what do you think of?\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah, exactly. Those terrible long tables with TV at one end and that space says something.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nRight. Exactly, and so that's not even, I didn't say boardroom, I said board meeting. It's like, so I wasn't asking you to describe the room but that's what you go to. That's the default. If I said AA meeting, you would probably say church basement with-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nyou, know, folding chairs. I said because I've done that with audiences of 1000s of people and they were like the invariably, unless they're super, super, super like on it. That they will describe the space, not describe the rules [inaudible 00:09:24]. We often in, we go, we set ourselves into spaces where the script has already been established for the conversation based on [inaudible 00:09:34] space plays out. There’s so much we can do by just shifting a space which is what, that's why you and I talked about breakfast this morning [crosstalk 00:09:44] [inaudible 00:09:45].\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBreakfast shifts the space and creates a different kind of dynamic and establishes a different agenda. The agenda is different because it's bracketed by certain things. Basically, the fundamental argument is that conversation is the most important human tool that we've had probably for the long, one of the longest. Historically, we've gotten less and less good at it and really we have gotten less good at it. There are plenty of historical examples where we’ve, we were better.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nHow do you measure or how do you… What's the yardstick for less good at it in this case?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWell, as you know in the book, I basically make an argument that at least in the United States or actually really primarily globally, many cases that's I would say Western, that the addition of television, family construct in the 40s really handed dialogue and conversation over to, from the family to the television. In the early 50s remarkable point of innovation for television, we had the TV tray which gave dinner time to the television. We got the… Within a couple of years of that which basically meant that we could skip, we can skip all the things we didn't care about. We had the introduction of-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYou broke up there for just a second, I think it was, you're talking about the clicker, right? [crosstalk 00:11:15] yeah. The TV also changed, instead of having a conversation in the round, we're having a conversation to a wall. We’re not even looking at each other so we're breaking the circle.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nExactly, right. Not only that, it's like so we… It's why I think dining rooms became vestigial in America. It's like no longer like that. Often dining rooms became offices and other things. Then not only that, gradually we put TVs everywhere and so in a world where the last thing… Not to get too intimate, but how does having a television in your bedroom affect your… If you have with your partner? The last thing or first thing you're seeing is something.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYou really have to think seriously. I get the phone thing and I get… I believe Sherry Turkle . Sherry Turkle's was a mega hero of mine, Reclaiming Conversation is like I read the whole thing, yeah. Read over the New York Times piece but it's like… But that's the end of a cycle that we started, [crosstalk 00:12:21] he was the lead, I would say, 80 years ago. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nNo. Also, there's a quote I have in front of me from your book which is that the rules are the software of the conversation that can be written, tried, and rewritten and one of the biggest risks to a creative conversation is treating the rules as fixed as opposed to a set of constraints to be experimented with. I feel like what you're sort of summarizing there is the designer's mindset. That being a maker is I can make it and I can remake it and somebody has already made it, but I can still remake it even though it's already been made for me.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat's right. I'll give you an example from my more historical example of me at IDEO. I think that one of the things that was always interesting at IDEO is that first of all, people believe that IDEO had invented the rules of brainstorming. [inaudible 00:13:13] in the 30s or 40s, I can't remember but it's… In fact, the original rules of brainstorming, the non-ideal rules are way more sophisticated than the one that we know now. I don't know, have you read-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\n[crosstalk 00:13:29]. Yeah. They're good.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThey're genius and he's quite specific. He’s like, “By the way…” That was really one set of rules he had. In his original rules of brainstorming, he'll say, he said, “Hey, and by the way, don't critique, don't judge ideas.” But there'll be judging. That's just going to happen later and there'll be different rules for judging-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah. Which is like a common critique of brainstorming, is like, “You don't come up with ideas that are well founded.” He's like, “Well, no, you critique it.” By the way, I'm going to suggest we both turn off video. I'm getting a couple of laggy moments and so just-\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[crosstalk 00:14:07]. Okay. Let me do that. I'm also going to close my window.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nAmazing. There you go. That's-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIs that better?\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah. Well, we'll see. Or you can just focus on each other's voices.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. What's weird about this is that we're running my internet off my phone right now so hold on a second.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIt's that's we've all been there. I've had to run entire workshops off of my phone.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI know. It's very strange. Okay. Now, it's getting warm in here. Okay. Where were we?\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWell, so I want to ask about rules because you have some rules for rules in your book and I think that it's really great and I think it's worth unpacking the rules for rules. You talk about them being specific, positive, surprising, and brief.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nCan we just unfold that a little bit because forming them as positive, formulating a rule as positive may be surprising for people which would satisfy the third constraint but-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. It's really funny because… Hold on, I'm actually looking for the part of my other book where that is. But yeah, it's like the… Part of the point of the inspiration for rules came from rule setting that's happening right now across America in, [inaudible 00:15:22] across the world in kindergartens. Unfortunately, I don't have it right in front of the camera, what the name of the processes. But basically, what they try to do is establish one or two rules for grade schools and kindergartens and the children come up with the rules themselves.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIs this [Dowe 00:15:44]-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nA great example-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIs this the Dowe Academy?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nNo, it's not. Here it's called the Responsive Classroom-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt's like a thing that's taught and basically what the teachers will work on is how do we make rules for achievement? How do we get something that's going to be our year? It’s going to make us have a better year. Then how is it that it's not negative? An example might be like don't run. It's like so don't know running is like what it's really saying is be safe.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBe safe is the positive of don't run because… By the way that I think don't run could be, you can have a 1,000 rules that make you feel like them to be safe which could be like, don't run with scissors, it's like don't run with an axe, that whatever.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[inaudible 00:16:39]. But be safe is the positive way of doing that. I really believe that we need to kind of be really quite clear around that. I think what's interesting about the be specific and I think Charles Osborne with the original brainstorming rules did a really good job. Is that one of the things that I'm sure you see Daniel in your work, and I've certainly seen in my work is when we're following a rule but we don't know why that rules in place. That comes up a lot for instance in brainstorming, right? Someone's basically like, “Be wild, be un-judgemental, whatever.” There's a specific reason why Charles Gibbs for Why That's The Case.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nHe’ll just be like, he's like, “If you constrain yourself, you will get to less than good.” It's for instance, when people talk to me about empathy, I'm like, “Yeah, sorry.” Not so much empathy, let's go for love because I feel when you go for love, you're… Like the less good version of love is empathy. Or love or the less good version of empathy is understanding or the less good version of understanding is being willing to have a conversation.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI'm like, “Let's go out there.” But the reason why is because I know that we're going to get not so great even if we go for love. These [inaudible 00:18:00] be surprising. But I don't know Daniel, but from the book you should recognize, I think surprise is like what makes things work. Like I ran a five and a half hour Zoom thing off the back of UN Global Assembly week. It was spectacular and people were riveted for five and a half hours. I will say the reason that worked is because we had suspense. You just never knew what was going to come next.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nLiterally, we'd be like, “Okay, we're going to stop now and we're going to put you in democratized bathrooms. Somebody that was like a Nigerian entrepreneur, a prime minister and me and we're like, “Okay, we got five minutes, [inaudible 00:18:44] talk about?” I just think not underestimate the element of surprise both in terms of its memorability which I talk about a lot in the book, which is what makes a story memorable is it’s surprisingness.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThen brevity is like the opposite of what I've just done which is it's like, “We just don't need a spiel. We need like 45 second clarity on why this rule feels right.” The book has this thing where it's like, I don't know if you noticed that’s where it's like, “Do all this and then or don't-”\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI did notice that.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nDepending on the context because at the same time if things are going fine, then let's not overthink it. But it's when things are not going well that you have to stop and really rethinking.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI feel like it's worth bringing up, what this is, are tickling in my brain is brain stuff. Because we were talking about the neuroscience aspect of some of these things. When you're talking about brevity and only having four plus or minus one rules that goes to just a fundamental constraint of the conversation which is the human mind and human memory. We can only keep a couple of things on hand at once.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI think that's entirely right. I think the notion of pneumonics and by the way that actually ties to things like space, right?\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nOne of the reason I talk about, well, the spaces you have is that pneumonic associations happen because of the spaces that we're in or related to the spaces we're in. It's why, if I say, “Where were you at 911, on 911?” You'll be able to tell me because part of your memory making was built on space, the space you're in. Pneumonics are a significant component of this. Right now I would say, what I'm finding is four rules are often even too much because I think I had a limit of four. I would say given our brain's capacity during COVID and during the political strife and just this, the social moment we're in and our fear and anxiety, I'm pretty good with two.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt's like [inaudible 00:20:53], if we have two, that then we will pretty much, I know people remember one and that's… The first one is always be brief, which is like try to stay under 45 seconds in to a single idea. I'm like, “If people can get that, then yeah, we're good.” Then we get much beyond that then… Usually, we can, I can get one more beyond that. Then and over time people will start to adopt it but-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWe're getting towards… Sorry. Based on you breathing in slightly, I was wondering if there was something more you wanted to say about that.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nNo. I was just breathing in slightly.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI made that to mean… Yeah.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhich by the way… Yeah. Which is a good thing to do in a conversation so-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight. Okay. Well, so there's the… My, and there's so many ways I can go with this because you talked about silence as a peaceful interruption. Often, if you are in a conversation and somebody is not being brief, right? They're being verbose and they're holding the space too much, there are ways to interrupt them. You talk about a couple in the book, sort of with a question, but also building those silences in. I'm wondering like how you use silence as a tool in conversation.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. Well, so just to… I'll give you a little, I'm going to backtrack a little bit and we'll go back to silence and then we’ll… But interestingly, one of the most simple ways to build, that build silence in is using it in the agenda of your meeting. An agenda just so you know, agenda comes from the ancient Latin. Agenda, this is the stuff that was cut from the book. They were like, “No one cared a lot-”\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI care about this stuff. Conversation-\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[crosstalk 00:22:28]. Yeah, exactly. But so it comes from the ancient Latin, it actually described a mass so that's why masses, not like religious mass, were actually, the original masses were called agendas. That's how they were put together. If you think about a mass or if you think about any religious service, there's purposeful silenced, whether it be prayer or something else, there is purposeful… There's singing which is, which actually triggers certain kinds of neurochemicals that are positive for us. The way a mass is put together is to build the perfect experience that you can and that's true for many, many, many religious services. It's not just Catholicism.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhat’s interesting about that is that there is a good example where silence, like you might start with silence in a mass and you might have silence midway through and that's prayer, right? The Quaker services start with silence and that silence is maintained all the way through. Silence, psychologically speaking, there's a lot that studied about the kind of creative potential of silence. The psychology of… Like creativity suggests that being silent for anywhere between 45 seconds to a day will allow your mind to trigger unlikely associations, break down the barriers you have around ideas that come up in dialogue.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhich is definitely why you, we'll ask people to sleep on something. Is that it’s like often you'll kind of, it'll, they'll be triggered the next day or it's often why your great ideas come to you while you're on a hike. Like I was just down or in the shower. What you can do and we'll talk about interruption in a second, but one of the things that you can do is you can build a moment of silence into a meeting and so we often think the best time to do that is the beginning, but it can be triggered in 45 minutes in.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIf you know it’s going to, it's an hour meeting and you know the critical decision making has to happen in the last 15 minutes, when might you put in two minutes of silence? Like 44 seconds, 44 minutes in. What I've found is that I do that a lot sometimes the silence is like, “Just write down some things-”\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBut it just really shifts the dynamics. By the way, everything I'm talking about is as applicable in a virtual context as it is in a-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nTremendously yeah. Absolutely.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBut one last thing is that, then there's the people who just run on and on. Like me and so-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWell, this is an interview, is a little different. This not-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBut I once asked a really skilled interviewer how she stopped somebody from going on and on. She was like, “I've never really learned.” I'm not afraid to interrupt, I do it all the time, so that's one thing but there are a bunch of other ways to do it. Like you can simply ask something like, “What are we talking about here?” Which is like a moment to kind of self and analyze. You can ask the person to be like, “Can you just tell me a version of this story but in 20 seconds?”\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYou can give them some constraints around how to do that. There's a lot of different ways to do it. I think the point there is not to be afraid to do it. We'll talk about this in a moment, but I’ll let you ask more questions but that relates a lot to even recognizing the things that are triggers for you as an individual and that make you furious with people and why silence can help you with that for a moment too so.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI saw in the book how you talked about building it in the two thirds mark and I think it is such a powerful thing to give people a chance to have a conversation with themselves.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nRight.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat’s [inaudible 00:26:31].\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nTo make that room for, “Well, what do I think on this? But heard a lot of stuff, 45 minutes is a lot of time. Now, let me collect myself before we just go headlong in for the last...” It is slowing down the pace of the conversation which you talked about. Like having that variability, having some surprise and this fast paced society slowing down is definitely a surprise.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWell, and that's also really interesting. Yes, and it's like I'm a big fan of… What I often say is like… Right now I'm working with an institution and we're dealing with two things which is the financial sustainability of the institution and then the question of diversity inclusion which actually shifts as far as restorative justice in the institution. When I was sort of saying is like we'll have two kinds of conversations and the conversations that are about the sustainability of the institution and how we're going to survive, those are going to be fast and non-inclusive.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nSorry, 200 people, you're not going to be able to hear everything that we're doing about that because that's about making sure this institution continues to survive. Everything that's about culture, diversity, inclusion, race, ethnicity, restorative justice, any of those things, those are going to be slow, public and deliberative and that's because we do not want to get those wrong. Really, we have, we vary paces. It's like… But I'm a big fan of slowing down in crisis. I think crisis triggers as you know that the fight or flight syndrome and we don't actually make great decisions in that context. We just run and run. It's funny because it was Halloween recently, I just was watching some horror movies and it's like all people do is run.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah. Never a good idea, wait and get an axe. That's-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. [inaudible 00:28:25] just drive the car to them over and over again, whatever. It's just like so… Anyway, there's [inaudible 00:28:31] but I do think [inaudible 00:28:33], I cannot tell you if there's one simple tool just to use [inaudible 00:28:38] silence, that's it’s powerful.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWell, I feel like the flip side of this… There was something else that was surprising in your book to me, it was a term I hadn't heard before. I think of, I think about working against that fight or flight response in myself in difficult conversations. Active listening is one of my safety valves. Like I have the active listening script and I activate it and I, it helps me slow down the conversation. But you talked about how… I love that you mentioned Eliza which was like… I'd only read about it. I love the fact that you actually had a conversation such as this with this digital fake therapist who just basically active listens to you but has nothing to say and has no opinion.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nThat you contrast active listening with creative listening which is about stepping into people's stories. I'm just wondering if you can just paint a little bit, especially since we're talking about designing our conversations and being a creative maker of them, what does creative listening mean to you? Why is it important do you think for people to be aware of this as a different option?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah. It means the world to me. To be honest that the chapter on listening was the first, it was the chapter I wrote to sell the book and to be really honest, everyone was like, “You should just write a book on listening.” I was like, “Yeah. I got more to say.” But it's like… But it isn't in essence one of the most substantive elements of the book. Let me be clear, I'm not against active listening everywhere. I'm against active listening in the workplace. I'm against active listening… Well actually, I might be against it most everywhere.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nLet me rephrase, no active listening.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nHowever, I will say the origins of active listening have really, are really smart. Where they were originally intended, they were, they're kind of genius. As you know from the book, Carl Rogers who invented Rogerian Therapy, invented active listening, I would say like in the 40s and 50s, it was one of many of the tools that Rogers used. He was a therapeutical genius. But his premise for it was, in the dominant context where psychology really was either dominated by Freud or Young so it really was psychoanalytic. Carl Rogers didn't believe that a universal theory could solve the secrets of our cognition. He just didn't believe that it had to be Freud or Young.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhat he did is he basically, he built Rogerian Therapy which is really a form of active listening, which was like you saying something to me. Like, “I'm not feeling good today,” and me saying, “Why are not feeling good?” You saying, “I'm not feeling good because I feel like I'm not achieving my goals.” I'm like, “Well, why aren't you achieving your goals?” I'm never really answering the question. I'm never really responding to you and the reason I'm doing that is I'm trying to unlock you. I'm trying to unlock your ability to understand your solution.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBecause he basically saying like, “I'm not sure I can do it.” By the way, this was not his sole form of therapy. He had other forms of-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nOf [inaudible 00:31:52]. He didn't believe it… He set and reset the rules based on where a patient was. That’s actually, that we suspect that most modern therapists are like that. They’re kind of like talking through. I think it gets a little bit weirder when you get into the coaching therapist space and then to be [inaudible 00:32:14] honest, I have a therapist that is like, she's Rogerian, but she's also just like, “Yeah, but you got to just call your mom.” [inaudible 00:32:22].\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt's like… The point is we've adopted active listening and put it into places it was never really intended to be. It was not meant to be the primary language of human resources, HR. It was not meant to be a boss's way of not listening to the complaints of their… Sorry. A person who reports them and that's how we use it now. We use it as a way of like signaling a subtle form of agreement but not really.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYou're like, “Well, this person has been mean to me.” They're like, “Uh-huh”. It's just like, but you're not really listening. That became really problematic for me when my teams had stopped listening and these people were design ethnographers, anthropologists, psychologists and suddenly we'd be in meetings with people that were actually their users and you would hear this. Sorry, you got little bumping, but you could hear the typing, right?\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWhich was note-taking. By the way, written note taking, phenomenal. It's like…. Or doodling, phenomenal. Great ways to listen. Or knitting, great.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYes, yeah.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBut taking notes on a computer is not listening. I made the mistake of being like, “Well, who's a great listener in my life?” I thought of my mother and I was like, “I want you all to listen like my mother.” That didn't really work because not all mothers listen very well. We basically had to build a new psychology in script around why we should think about creative listening. The book however is like a hybrid between that work at IDEO, my own research into Quaker listening, gossip, secret telling, my great-grandmother's ability to tell incredibly short, powerful 20 second stories which I call illuminations and my mother's ability to listen and the fact that my mother had, it was work.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nMy mother was raised in a family home where her uncle was deaf so she basically was raised in silence for most of her life and so she was a phenomenal listener, like really highly in tune. There's really that chapter. When I finished the book, my publisher was like, “It's 200 pages but it's kind of sprawling.” I'm like, “It's kind of this sprawling because it covers everything.” Again, just covers all kinds of things. But that chapter is really a combination of that. The fundamental premise, sorry, is listening should be joyful. Well, while we're listening to somebody, to your point, we should also be listening to ourselves.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThe Quaker concept is, if God is talking, God has always been talking and it's actually why women were allowed to preach in the 1600s, like the first women because why not? God could be talking through anybody. It's like the visual cues of listening really matter, like really seeing people understanding, it's why I think, “Well, I'm having a great communications with my dog right now. It's like brilliant.” We’ve never had better interstitial communications and it's also why we love listening to gossip or we love a secret. A secret is like a non… It’s like a, it's the [inaudible 00:35:55] version of a tweet. It's like a secret is just like this little 10 word story that's just like no scintillating. It captures our attention.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWhat I'm hearing you saying, not to actively listen to you but what I am hearing is the mechanistic approaches to listening of like that listening is taking notes. Whereas what they're really doing is filtering through their own mental model and tagging, right? They're not slowing down and connecting which is a different… I suppose I'm just pretty willing here. It seems like in the same way that we should design our conversations in general, we should be specific about the types of listening that we need to do and maybe it's good to have one researcher who's in the room doing all the tagging.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat's totally right and there could be a moment where it's like it's good to have somebody who's just active listening or it could be good to have somebody who's just witnessing. One of the last hardest symposium I was at, I was a witness and it fell apart and then they were like, “Okay, you and Kemal, you guys were the witnesses, tell us what happened.” We had to be like, “You guys are, you need to go drink.” It's just like [inaudible 00:37:10] I think Daniel, the… Well, first of all, let me just stop. How do you feel about what I just told you? Does it make you feel conflicted? Does it feel-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nNo. It's actually, what I'm remembering a story.\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[inaudible 00:37:25] to me.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nAs you probably have, you have to teach these principles to people and I remember a facilitator who I worked with who would do three rounds of, you put a group of three together and they would do some empathic interviews with each other. In one of the rounds, he asked, he made it so that people could only ask one question and then listen for the whole rest of the, it was five or 10 minutes and people were flabbergasted. They were just, there's a shock. We talk about surprise in the rules. It's like, “Well, you can only ask one question.” They're like, “Well, how can I possibly get good information about this if I only ask one question.”\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nThen the experience of it is, “Wow. I just could just relax.” I knew that I didn't have to formulate my next inquiry. All I could do was sit there and nod and how liberating that can be because you used the word witness and I was like, “Witness. I don't think we think of as a necessary component.” Like, “I'm just going to sit here and I'm just going to absorb everything you're going to have to say I'm, it's my job to uh-huh and to keep pestering you with additional questions.”\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah, and there's so many unique forms like that. It’s like there's the Quaker Clearance Committee which is one where it's like somebody just talks and really all you're allowed to do is take notes and then ask questions that are clarifying. Then if you're a good note taker, then those notes are a gift to the person who you listened to. As you know in the book, I talk a lot about a surprising question, so a great example that I've used recently is, I just met somebody who was dying of prostate cancer on this Island and he, his last night on the Island or to, last of second night on the Island, second last night and we were having a conversation and he kind of opened up about it.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nHe hadn't really talked to anybody about it. Instead of me talking about like a latte, “How does it feel to be almost dead?” or like, “You must feel terrible,” or, “I'm so sorry.” I basically was like, “Well, what's one funny story you have that you can tell in 30 seconds about what you've experienced as you've been diagnosed with cancer?” Then he loved it and he told a really funny story and it opened it up and it allowed us to have a much more broader conversation. Finally, in the end allowed me to make an introduction for his last night on the Island to a psychoanalyst who has been struggling with cancer for four years whereas he's just been diagnosed and I was like, “Let's go have dinner with her.” We did and that was really amazing so.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWe're getting towards… Is a timeless way of building.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYes.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nI want to just draw a circle between the way I think about there's this idea of like we are designing conversations, generating principles and then there are these really specific, we could call them designs for conversations, specific patterns that are just can be eliminations to use… Was it your mother or your grandmothers? Your grandmothers-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt was my great-grandmother yeah-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYour great-grandmothers approach. These inversions of common rules that become patterns that we can create living spaces then ask a surprising and positively oriented question.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nRight.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight. Building silence. Not surprisingly, you described your book as sprawling. I think it's a delightful romp. There's another way of classifying it, but-\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[inaudible 00:41:19] adventure.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah, exactly. It's like there's the [inaudible 0000:41:23] and there's a whole thing. Anyway, that and I don't suppose many people mention a timeless way of building in their books in general. My editor was like, “Why are you bringing this in towards the end?” I'm like, “Because it's important for people to understand that a pattern language matters.” But I don't have a background in architecture, I have a background in industrial design. I'm hoping maybe you can just talk about why or how your design background comes into the way that you're looking at and thinking about the world-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah-\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nAs designable.\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[crosstalk 00:42:00]. It's really interesting because as you know like Christopher Alexander's book of pattern language, breaks down, just for those of you who are listeners who might not have read it or heard it or seen it, it's a quite a tome that I often give to people when they first started thinking about design. Because what he does is he looks back at the historical precedent for 1000s of years of history for why things get built in certain ways. It's everything for, what's the role of an Inglenook? Which is like a four person little table by a fireplace that's kind of embedded and why have an Inglenook and then all the way to what's the role of the beer hall to what's the role of a town square?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt just kind of gets bigger and bigger and bigger. What's interesting about that is that it both relies on history, but it suggests that there are cultural patterns. I would argue cultural patterns that cut across cultures which by the way matters. The power of sitting in a circle with no table in front of you, on the floor is as powerful in Western culture for different reasons as it is in indigenous Western culture, as it is in African culture, as it is in South American. There’s different reasons why that circle holds power. For us, it might be because we learn that as a child because we, our favorite conversations were in kindergarten cross-legged on the floor with a beloved teacher.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nFor indigenous people, it might be that their most spiritual experiences happen in a circle or it might be that the most political experiences happen sitting in a circle. Really, it varies wildly and yet we can see that the pattern persists and that's a good thing. We need those patterns. It's weird that you said it because I have another notion, I have two other notions for books but one is to basically do a pattern language. Like that's quite literally a more broken down version of this. That's like… Because as you know I really liked my chapter, like my little subsections to be no longer than two to three pages.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nOften, [inaudible 00:44:15] rules and I'm like, “I don't know why we couldn't break it down to paragraphs, everything from like one-on-one or to you alone or frankly you and your dog.” Because it's like I really do believe in interstitial communications especially with… You alone, you and your dog, you and your friend, partner, person you hate person, person you love whatever, all the way up to countries and the world so I feel like I'd be really interested in doing that. That's one book on my plate and the other is the community kit which is just basically how fast can you jumpstart community? Because I believe you can do in minutes if you need to.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIf you're sourcing timeless waves of building.\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[crosstalk 00:44:59]. Exactly. It's like… We moved to an Island, this Island two months ago and we had built a community within days of… Like that never happens on this Island. Like it takes years to do that.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWhat was your approach? How did you design your-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nOur approach was very simple. It was like go to the town store, there was only one town store and, but it was owned by an artist because I went to go buy cups and instead I bought a piece of his artwork which was a great compliment to him. He wanted us to meet other people and so it's like literally, he kind of became the host. Then we also, I was like, “We're going to hire a caretaker,” and we were like, “We're going to hire a woman lesbian caretaker,” the first on the Island ever. It turns out everybody was like, “That was the best hire ever.”\n\nFred Dust:\n\nLike, “She's our most beloved community member.” Like, “We've known her since she was four and watched her struggle through all these things.” It's like… That was me hiring the way I've hired in real life. It's like that's like, I always just focused on like, “Let's get the black gay person.” It's like, “Because we need the different voices.” Ironically, what we did here is no different than what I do when I built my team for making conversation that the business, it's what I did when I used to make teams at IDEO. Is just you just plan it in the same way so.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nAlso, Fred, our time for this particular conversation is growing towards the end very rapidly and I want to kind, there's one more sticky note that I have here for my notes. There’s lots more in the book that I didn't take out and put on this piece of paper to be my guide, but there's this quote where you talked about, I want this book to give you the hope I found. I thought that was a really beautiful sentiment. I know that a lot of people look at the current conversation in America and we're recording this on the eve of our election, can you, what is the hope that you found for the future of conversations for us?\n\nFred Dust:\n\nWell, I'll tell you a little surprising funny story which is that I was, that I had talked about a school for severely addicted children in the opening of the book. Then I was doing an interview, it wasn't really, I didn't need to do it because I was done with the book, but one of young women who went to the school asked if I would interview her so I did. I interviewed her and it was fascinating and so revealing and stuff I would never put in the book because it's just like it was so personal. Yet at the end she was like, “Can I ask you a question” I said, “Yes, of course you may.” I’d interviewed both her and her mother, and she was like, “The question is, are you cured?\"\n\nFred Dust:\n\nI was like, “Well, I wasn't sick.” It's like was my first response and then I was like, “Wait a second. I was absolutely sick.” It's like… Because I was, when I started the research I was like… Originally, the book was to be why we lost conversation in the world and halfway through I'd pivot it to be like, “No, it's about people who actually do have the hardest conversation of their lives and they do make it through using creativity.” I realized that I was cured and so what I thought wasn't going to go in the book that is in fact as you know it's like the final paragraph of the book is that story.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nBut what's interesting is that I did that by being like relentlessly seeking out people who were normal every day, people who somehow had a conversation they never thought they could have and they did it through creativity even if they didn't realize they were being creative. When you spend three years, because that's really what it was doing that, you're like, “We can do this.” I will say to you and your listeners, our job right now in the wake of an election that we don't know what the outcome is but in the wake of a year that we know is going to be continuously to be tumultuous and hard if not worse than that is for us to be unrelentingly good about retelling the stories of when conversations have happened that were good and had good outcomes and where everyday people did it.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat's my job. That's my sole purpose right now is like, “You can do this. Don't think you can't.” But by the way, if you can't, it's okay to just take a break and go lie down on the floor like and [inaudible 00:49:49]. But it's like it's our job as humans. It's why we're here, is to discovering the people. Daniel, as you know it's like, I think you can do that with your Trump or Biden voting neighbor. I think you can do that with your… Your job is to do that.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah. It's our human job to do it.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt's our human job.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nRight.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThere is really nothing more important I believe.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nWell, I'm wondering if there's anything left unsaid. Is there anything else that-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nYeah, I will say this because depending on when you're going to drop this, people are going to be heading out home to Thanksgiving and whether that's virtual home or not or they're going to be headed home to high holidays and some sort. It doesn't, that doesn't really matter what it's going to be. I would say that my one piece advice to you is if you can't talk, and there are many reasons you can't talk, it could be things we have fraught conversations while we're cooking because of weight issues in my family. Or it could be I have a Trump voting or a Biden voting relative who I know, voted that way.\n\nFred Dust:\n\nIt really can range wildly. If you can't talk, then just do together. Just be together and do something together. I have a young woman who just reached out to me to say that, after hearing me lecture, she went to her father-in-law and she was like, “I don't want to have a conversation and I don't really want to learn how to play golf but why don't you teach me how to play golf?” Their bond has just been profound through that. She was like, “It's been good enough,” and that's all we need right now. I would keep that in mind.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nYeah. This is almost like the equivalent of the person who knitted in their meetings to help them, to help her stay present, just to help her stay connected. It’s-\n\nFred Dust:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIt's the third object in the conversation.\n\nFred Dust:\n\n[inaudible 00:51:55]. The whole book is like that, which is like it's like, “Do it or don’t.” It's like force the conversation unless you feel like you can't and then just make together. It's like this is an alternative to if you can have a conversation. It's exactly right. It's just like figure out what's working and then lean into that and then get better and better at figuring out how to make that work more.\n\nDaniel Stillman:\n\nIt's such a gentle approach to design, right? It's not didactic, it's not imperialistic"
