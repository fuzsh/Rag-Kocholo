        "text": "When you meet a sturdy eighty – nine year old gentle man with a strong handshake and, an even stronger gait, you are blown away by his energy. That was us when Growth Lane Book Club visited Prof. & Mrs. Edward B. Rugumayo on Friday, October 27, 2023 in Fort Portal City.\n\nThe drive to Fort Portal was bumpy between Mityana and Mubende towns, but the terrain was all activity and cheer. Being October, light drizzles poured as we drove through the leafy farms with maize, coffee, matooke, tea estates, and forests green – cheeked and showy. The stop over at Mubende trading centre got us munching finger licking roadside chicken and gonja (plantain). I like to think that food brings out our character in unique ways. I travelled with three friends from the Book Club, and was joined by other four in a different car. Our stop over at Mubende, got us talking about the tasty gonja and, how we ought to eat minimally in readiness for the sumptuous meal that awaited us at Prof. Rugumayo’s.\n\nThe team I travelled with decided that Kadongo Kamu music through out the journey would be our travel playlist, thanks to Ronald Kalema, who sang along to almost every song. It was more of a karaoke session, as we giggled away. I had never keenly listened to the lyrics, but I learnt some good lessons from the songs that were played. It was educative folklore, quite rich culture and messages carried in those lyrics. I was impressed.\n\nThe five-hour journey was eventful and well earned when we got to Fort Portal City. We were welcomed by cars rattling down the semi crowded streets, motorbikes hooting while darting narrowly among cars, pedestrians and cyclists. The day’s colour was bright and sunny and slowly dissolved into gray, and the distant Mt. Rwenzori peak became opaque silhouettes of crouching giants. Our arrival at Prof. Edward Rugumayo’s home was met with gracious hospitality from him and his lovely wife, Foibe Rugumayo. Mama Foibe introduced and embraced each of us, with a hug for days. I felt instant affection towards her. She reminded me of my mother. “You are Luo like my husband’s descendants. They descend from a Luo lineage,” she excitedly said after I introduced myself. Fort Portal Botanical Garden overlooks his front garden, which he pointed out to us in the valley below. He has done quite some impressive work with it.\n\nThe house proved even more impressive once he led us inside. It’s size was estimated to contain at least three apartments in Kampala. I felt as though I had stepped into a mini palace. We were given a tour of the house, which had antics from all over the world. The glittering tiles from Spain, and doors and windows from South Africa made us marvel at the simple yet unique architecture. The house is earth quake resistant, given the location of Fort Portal, which is prone to earth quakes. I was intrigued by his home office, which had a library and his journals from eight decades ago stacked on the shelves. What amused us all was the bed, which he said he used for his afternoon siesta, when he needed to rest his brain from all the writing. We used the opportunity to sign the dummy book of Why Fireflies Glow. The oohs and aahs that followed when he showed us a book gifted to him by a friend with different images of fireflies was creative.\n\nWe were joined by his friends from Mountains of the Moon University who introduced themselves as; Prof. Dr. John M. Kasenene, Mr. Clovis Kabaseke, Mr. Tom Mboijana and Mr. Moses Bukenya. They all had either worked or were currently working at the University. Conversation flowed from nutrition, environment, ecology, forestry, climate change, politics and history. I had never felt more present drinking from the cup of knowledge of the academicians and citizens who had lived, survived and thrived through generations before us. It was an entire history class for me. Stories of the turbulent years in the 70’s and 80’s were revealed, more vibrantly and truthfully. Mr. Tom Mboijana narrated to us how he had served all the Ugandan Presidents apart from Kabaka Edward Mutesa, while he served as Chef at Nile Mansions, Chobe Safari Lodge and Pakuba Safari Lodge in Murchison Falls National Park. Mr. Clovis Kabaseke narrated his work in forestry, ecology and research. A lecturer in horticulture and expert in herbs and medicinal plants, we were educated about the different species of trees and their medicinal use. In the 60’s as a forestry officer, he created an inventory on the bird species in Uganda.Prof. Dr. John M. Kasenene explained the history of Mountains of the Moon University and how he had recently handed over the Vice Chancellorship after it was transformed into a Public University in 2022. Mr. Moses Bukenya, an Information Technology professional narrated his humble beginnings at Mountains of the Moon University as a pioneer student, who had risen through the ranks to work in a Senior leadership position in the IT department.\n\nWhat I remember most about the visit was the food, which was a three-course meal. I was served the first course by Prof. himself and felt honoured. Foibe took charge of serving every guest, and went out of her way to ensure that we left nothing to waste. We were served ice cream and cake for dessert by her, and she out did herself. We were overwhelmed by her humility and generosity. My stomach worms must have wondered why I over fed them. I guess they surrendered.\n\nAfter lunch, we handed over gifts we had come along with to Prof. and Mrs. Rugumayo. The gracious couple happily accepted the gifts and seemed overly impressed. We used the moment to take a few pictures with Prof. Rugumayo’s book, Why Fireflies Glow together with the couple. The weather outside was gloomy and chilly, and we opted to get back into the cozy sitting room, where we indulged in a question and answer session with Prof. Memories of his childhood and his naughtiness were revealed. I was impressed by his memory of the 30’s and 40’s. He is brilliant and savvy. Further discussion on his leadership role in the National Consultative Council between 1979 – 1980, the Moshi Unity Conference, his life as a diplomat and the Ministerial positions he has held over the years were narrated to us with effortless wisecracking and self- possessed charm.\n\nAt 8:00pm, we had to retire to our places of abode, after spending the best five hours with the Rugumayo’s. Before we did, Foibe showcased her oyster mushroom project at the back of the house and I learnt a thing or two about mushrooms. I found them unassuming, authentic and clean-hearted people. Our Patron, Afande Kasingye, on our return shared a message received from Prof. to the group platform.\n\n“Growth Lane Book Club are the first Ugandans to ever drive to my residence to chat with me about my political and personal life ever since my return to the country in 2005. Thank you for making time to come visit me. You are a brilliant team and I had to go all out to offer you the best service.”\n\nSpecial thanks to the Growth Lane Book Club, especially to those that made the trip. Afande Asan Kasingye, Ronald Kalema, John Mary Luwaga, Martha Nalumansi Oola, Rovince Lillian Ndagire, Allan Odong and Majwega Robert.\n\nOh! We didn’t find any fireflies. Looks like they became extinct according to Prof. Rugumayo.\n\nBy Sheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt is that time of the year when I get to celebrate my father, Mr. Gaspar Vid Okumu our patriot of humility and hard work wrapped in one like a tortilla. This time round, I am giving an opportunity to ‘our’ family and friends to write love notes to you on your special day. So, daddy, this is to you from all of us. Soak it all in. Happy birthday daddy!\n\nMrs. Jane W. Okumu (Wife)\n\nHe is one person who strengthens me in all the trials of life. Even after all the hard work he has put in all his life he has maintained the unconditional love for his family. He is down to earth and respectful of everyone irrespective of their status. Clients love him and admire his gait. He has a ‘swaggerific’ walk, a good sense of humour and is easy to work with. He is not envious and is very happy when others succeed. I pray all his dreams are fulfilled.\n\nLillian Parmu (Daughter)\n\nDad has always been there for us in every way. He has over the years provided all our basic needs, tuition, and school essentials. Always thinking of us before himself right from school and after. His guidance has gotten us to where we are today.\n\nDad taught us humility with his quiet presence. He barely must speak to drive a point home because his actions speak louder than words. Always everyone’s favourite at his former workplace, Ernst & Young where he won several accolades for employee of the year, one of which culminated to a trip to the United Kingdom, head office and tour of the country. He has always been well respected among his peers and I am glad each one of us picked up a quality or two from him to guide us in our everyday lives.\n\nDad is hardworking and has been an icon to each of us. To see him work even in retirement humbles me and it is my hope and prayer that we take after him. He is a workaholic.\n\nOn your birthday daddy, we celebrate you for who you have always been and continue being the pillar we lean on us a family. I thank you for instilling in us life values in an exemplary way. I don’t get to say it often, but you are much appreciated. Your sacrifices and selfless nature deserve a reward.\n\nHappy Birthday Daddy, we love you!\n\nKenneth Okumu (Son)\n\nAs a father, I have come to appreciate Dad even more especially when my children tell me, “Thank you Daddy,” after providing them with their needs. I know I am obligated to provide, but that gratitude is often least expected. I know Dad, I owe you so many thank yous!\n\nJoan Wacheke (Daughter)\n\nHappy Birthday Dad! I am thanking you on this day for being honest, smart, and a strict timekeeper. I learnt these from you, and it has helped me be trusted by people. I recollect one day on my way back to school with a tear on my pillow cover and you cautioned me that, “Even the smallest item you think people might not notice will always be the first impression people have of you.” That was one of the my greatest life lessons. Thank you for being you.\n\nRonny Mupe (Son)\n\nI admire his punctuality and to this day, I try to live my life accordingly. He is a man of very high values and can not easily be swayed once he has made up his mind which has also been the basis of my life.\n\nThank you for making all the sacrifices silently and working hard day and night to get us a better life. I love you. Happy birthday Dad!\n\nSandra Wambui (Daughter)\n\nDad, you were there for me from the day I was born. A permanent fixture, always having my best interests at heart. You are one of the most important people in my life and I love you with my whole heart. Happy birthday Daddy!\n\nNicholas Maina (Nephew)\n\nPapa, in the years I joined your beautiful family, you raised me like your own, right from childhood. I am the man I am because of you. You taught me life lessons that have instilled in me a sense of purpose. I am proud you raised me, and I hope to raise my own children just like you taught me.\n\nThank you for being there for me when I needed you most. On this beautiful day, I wish you a lovely birthday and I love you more than words can express. I am blessed and proud to be your son.\n\nDaniella Atono (Granddaughter)\n\nBeyond a simple, “I love you,” life is made better by having a grand father like you and I would like to say thank you for building a solid family that love and respect each other.\n\nCharles Odongtho (Family friend)\n\nBest birthday celebrations to Dad. Such a fine respectful gentleman, an anchor of Parombo Community Unity, a symbol of integrity, one of the best examples of a true diplomat without an office is what your dad is.\n\nA very consistent man in discipline. May God bless him with good health and long life.\n\nThere you have it dad. All these tributes are heart swelling from all of us. It goes to show how much you mean to us. Keep being your true self. Cyber hug! Much love and respect!\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt’s been a minute since I last checked in here. I hope all of you are walking through this season with your head high seeing that the times are still uncertain with anxiety brought on by the pandemic. I keep thinking some of these stories will help kids ten or twenty years, from now understand that there was once a pandemic that ravaged the world and caused a lot of heart ache to us who lived through it. That once upon a time world over it was mandatory to wear face masks and we could not figure whether a stranger you met had a nose or mouth. We smiled with our eyes to affirm that we were okay.\n\nBeyond our shared memories, and often hidden from the public view, are more personal remembrances. Every year around this time, my mum lights a candle in memory of her late brother, David Munyui Maina, who passed on, on July 27, 2017. Four years later and the pain never goes away. I recently read a story in the The New Yorker about a mother being remembered by her daughter. It read, “Risher recalls the way that her mother used to gather her and her sisters together every Sunday before church and spritz them with perfume, saying, “God is sweet, just like y’all.” That was heart swelling.\n\nEven during these times, how do we minimize the grief that has etched upon our hearts. How do we sympathize and support friends and loved ones who have lost several close relatives without being insensitive? There is a new anxiety-hum, a new quiet that is gripping many people leading them slowly and fast into the throngs of depression. How do we come out of this season sane with all the numbness that has embedded us?\n\nIn memory of Uncle David, I asked mum and my cousins to write about how they miss him and remember him. Indulge in the goodness of his giant persona.\n\nJane Wairimu Okumu\n\nMy dearest elder brother David, time really flies. The past four years have been like yesterday to me one of your surviving sisters. I thought by visiting your grave where you lay in the United States of America, would be a relief but alas! Every day I reflect on this day, water fills my eyes. I know that is the destination for all of us but yours gripped me bad. Never did I see you hospitalized and it hurt that I did not know the pain you endured in your final days. I condemned your family for not letting on but understood when they explained it was against your will to inform me. I later on got to terms with it because I realized you did that to protect me.\n\nYou loved us unconditionally and I commit to continue working hard to ensure all your projects in Kenya thrive with intent to keep your legacy alive. Sometimes, grief feels like a part of my heart died. We were raised together, spent the greater part of our childhood together and the sudden way in which you were ripped away left me feeling wide, open, vulnerable, and hurting.\n\nThe only consolation we have is we know Our Heavenly Father is keeping you safe till we meet again. Continue resting with the angels.\n\nEmma Wambui Wanjiku\n\nUncle Dave, If I am to write, I would write a book about you. I remember your annual visits to Kenya, how you always looked forward to coming home and the love you had for your whole family. It was boundless.\n\nTime really flies. It feels like yesterday, but we are four years later paying tribute. It is harder without your presence and without the presence of your love which shone bright like the sun.\n\nThe day we lost you, it felt like a year without you and this year feels like a century. Even if life does not last forever, one thing I know is that love is eternal, and these four years have not separated my heart from yours.\n\nElaine Wambui\n\nFour years ago, our family went through darkness. We suffered one of the many losses we have endured, shed tears and held our heads in pain. You went to a better place even if we did not see or feel it then.\n\nYou were practically the only father figure we had. We won’t forget that you taught us about being focused, strong and family oriented. We thank God for the years with you and the candle still burns brightly. Rest in Eternal bliss.\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIn March, 2020, as the coronavirus descended on the world, we came to learn that our different roles would evolve. At first the surge did not seem like it would materialize and lead to a succession of border closures. There was just this impending sense of doom. Then, all of a sudden, it was at our doorstep. The President declared the first lock down on March 31, 2020. We are living through the second lockdown fourteen months later.\n\nI sent out a text to Juu asking about how he lived through the pandemic year because, 1) he is a great storyteller and 2) he has unique abilities with words. Here goes his lockdown story.\n\nNever in my life have I pretended not to like certain food. What presents before me in form of a meal is what goes in my belly, and eventually down the toilet, of course. Posho and beans are still my favourite ride or die meal till the day my alcohol and cigarettes kill me.\n\nBut my sister, this lockdown presented facts to me that I had no idea could come to pass. There is this thing/meal/device called ‘mukene’ that really became a gem of some sort in my small apartment. As the high and mighty were busy stocking up on chicken, beef, cereal and all that fancy nonsense that comes out of supermarkets, I had already created a standard almost credit trustworthy relationship with a lady that had the easy basics that would make me a quick, easy to prep-meal in minutes (Yes, I even made a few You Tube videos of the preparation process which I eventually didn’t upload because there was no way I was going to get any female sympathy incase it went viral).\n\nSome lady had a makeshift stall at her house that sold tomatoes, onions, green pepper and mukene. It’s like she had got a vision of the COVID-19 apocalypse before it emerged. She had literally stocked about ten bags at one point. Hustlers or ‘jua kalis’ in my high end neighbourhood (like me) were seen queuing to buy mukene on a daily. This queue was especially overwhelming a day after the Head of State had just finished taking a flask of porridge on national television.\n\nWell, being a pioneer customer, I slipped the lady a note and expressed my discomfort about queuing like I am on a food stamp arrangement (which I totally wished I was at the time). My trepidation being noted, delivery came straight to my gated apartment (kafunda). Yes, mine was an overpriced kafunda. Deliveries were made every three days. Charcoal for Ug shs 2,000, mukene, onions and tomatoes. Cooking oil was a luxury. Water flowed out of the shower head (free). Total minutes hacking my meal, eight minutes tops including mingling my posho. Remember, charcoal had to be preserved with strict firmness.\n\nOkay let’s just say mukene is a meal I never want to see in my life again.\n\nMy neighbour? You mean the single guy like me whom I shared the same block with? Whose apartment was better and more spacious than mine? Okay, all I know is that dude’s meal was standard from day one. A triple decker Rolex (3 Chapatis, 3 eggs and beans) for lunch and a double decker rolex for supper. Standard arrangement. That is how it went for the next three months. I ‘allowed’ the architecture of the guys offals.\n\nMy line of work is in Information Technology and my partner and I had perfected a software and our biggest clients are those whose businesses have never been given a chance to open up, bars and restaurants.\n\nSo what happens when there is a breakdown in our system and a client calls? You look around your empty miserable abode, ofcourse you know there is no such thing as a Ug shs 5,000 note you could have overlooked hiding somewhere under the bed. The rats have abandoned you, they despise you. They are whispering to you, “Juu, just allow we have more money saved than you.”\n\nWhen you come to terms with these facts, you look for your most comfortable sneakers, put on those shorts and don’t give a chicken’s thigh about how badly your legs could use some protein to put on weight. Lastly set your alarm for 4:00am. Anytime between 4:00am and 6:00am is stealth mode for ‘jua kalis’ who know how to push their grind.\n\nSo standard routine; a client calls, I prepare my shoes, shorts and set my alarm for 4:00am. By 4:30am, I am on the road. Ofcourse I had to use out bound short cuts to avoid Local Defence Unit personnel who were on patrol up to 6:00am. My route was pretty simple and very painful but worth it. Two and a half hours later, I would be at the client’s place. There was a time I walked up to Makindye from Kyaliwajala, I almost died. Anyway, this happened like 10 or 15 times before boda bodas tried to get back illegally. Best part is I didn’t need the protein to fatten my chicken legs. After those trips, to and fro, I sort of developed unusual enlarged calf muscles (ntumbwe). My shoes were all history and my toes had totally lost shape but that’s okay. At least I fed the family wherever they were. Oh! And yes, most clients never paid.\n\nI would snuggle down under my blanket and suck my thumb. Dead as a door nail. Some days the weather was rotten, I couldn’t risk getting out of the house. Life felt vacant, vain, intolerable. What loyalty did I owe it? Why not beat fate, why was it lingering over me for this long?\n\nI almost forgot. When Jajja said we were going to get free beans and posho, I knew God had sent a solution to the ‘Hunger Games’ problem. Well guess what! They came within two weeks of lockdown and when they reached our gate, they said, we couldn’t get the supplies because we were ‘bagaga.’ How do they judge people by the houses they live in? I have never looked at someone with such rage in my life. I wanted to pounce on the guys and pour the whole truck of beans down their throats. I was totally devastated.\n\nWhat 2020 taught me was to learn to save. To not feel comfortable because everything looks average. I have learned to be humble because even the most privileged during this period wished they owned a bicycle. In short nothing is what it seems. The world is simply black and white. Any hints of a colorful tint or smudge are an illusion. Life can put you in your rightful place if you feel superior in society.\n\nMy greatest fear is the safety and happiness of my children being compromised. Anything beyond that is manageable.\n\nMy greatest achievement last year was that my job got more interesting. For once I didn’t feel tied down by all the conspiracies and being bossed around.\n\nMany of us have been separated from our loved ones during the pandemic, some of us have lost loved ones. It is going to take time to pick up the pieces and heal as well as adjust to the new normal of home-schooling and the struggle to balance work and parenting.\n\nThere is surging concern about the deterioration of mental health of people globally and this requires access to mental health resources on how to focus on the positive despite the times. I believe this series will uplift all those healing from things they do not discuss with anyone.\n\nToday and for the next six weeks, in honour of these times, I will be bringing you a selection of stories about pandemic parenting and the rich relationships between parents and children over the pandemic year. Soak in.\n\nBy Patrick Oyulu\n\nIf you are having trouble coming to terms with the second lockdown in light of the rising cases of COVID – 19 in Uganda, and the implications to your kids’ education during this pandemic, you are not alone. We walked it too.\n\nI live in what was called the “EPICENTER” of COVID, the Tristate in USA, and New Jersey to be specific. From what was, until far too recently, my son has had to wade through this pandemic that was disruptive to the normal way of life.\n\nAn eighth grade student at the time, the closure in many schools resulted in a roller coaster of emotions for us parents who had to do without a formal graduation ceremony for our son after he completed Elementary School. For kids who look up to this day, it was strange that each kid was summoned at a particular time, alone to go and empty their school locker, return scholastic materials, and received a congratulations gift pack from their Principal, all this without even their parents around. Parents were restricted to the parking lot, quite an emotionally draining situation.\n\nBut you would have to take it back a notch, to when the news about the Wuhan COVID – 19 leaks broke. My heart sunk and I thought about my family. My son’s school. What was to become of it? This was not the stuff of lullabies and sweet dreams. With the closure of schools, I feared for my son’s mental health, and indeed ours. Virtual learning was a new thing. It wasn’t tested. Would it affect morals? How would it affect discipline? More so, how would we parents juggle with this situation when some of us had to go to work?\n\nMy son had always benefited from a predictable schooling system. He is picked up by bus at a specific time, goes through school routines which builds up his discipline, and ultimately confidence in mixing with his peers and interfacing with his teachers. Yet here we were, in a dark, uncertain, and sunken place and the accelerating entropy of it all begun to make my head spin.\n\nFor a week, my son missed the fact that he could not attend class in person. As parents we talked to a few other friends and encouraged the kids to have regular zoom chats. Weekly about 4-5 families would hook up on zoom to discuss the challenges the kids were going through mentally, and we suggested coping mechanisms. As parents we had to remain strong for them. Importantly we told them about the risks of COVID to our health and how as kids, their actions were an important part in fighting this scourge. They increasingly started to understand. Electronic gadgets helped too. The kids became engrossed in electronics. Controlling our son was a problem. Yet we tried. Strict timelines were set for their use, while at the same time, we were also, in many cases, flexible considering we were all trapped in this cage cold life.\n\nAfter a while, my son got comfortable with virtual learning. But as a parent, I felt something was missing. His sense of timing was beginning to slacken. He no longer could adhere to the strict timelines he previously had when waking up. In the past he could wake up in time to catch the school bus. This time round he was getting lazy, probably because he had more sleep time until the virtual learning. But we he beauty of it all was, we kept talking, and instilling in him some of these virtues of responsibility. My son got to know more about balancing schoolwork and housework. He helped a lot in doing house chores and helping in the kitchen. However, being stuck 24/7 indoors required mental strength. As time passed, we accepted the norm. The streets were empty, ghost towns, but my wife, son and I adapted.\n\nAll was good until December 13, 2020. Then the dreaded happened. The pandemic hit us.\n\nMy wife and son got COVID. Where did it come from? Who knew? We had taken a hit. My son, asymmetric hit, but tougher on my wife. It worsened on Christmas Eve and I had to rush her to the Emergency Room. Long story short, my wife survived, but we missed the joys of Christmas and New Year’s Day. In a short span, in addition of being a Dad to my son and hubby to my wife, I became more of everything. The House Help, Cook, “Nurse”, Yote! Yet we were all in quarantine. The Pandemic was trying us. Not this Christmas time God seemed to say. Jesus was on our side.\n\nWe overcame. Lessons learned, resilience gained and onwards we moved. My son carried on with the hybrid system of schooling and we later opted for in-person schooling at the fastest opportunity. It has helped with his esteem, his relationship with teachers, though the time keeping took a hit. We are trying hard to instill that again. The school bus is back, and so are a few of his peers. A good thing for him, and a giant step for us, his parents.\n\nLet us share our stories on the agony of pandemic parenting and build back together. I would like to hear your stories on what it has really been like raising children over the past year. What have been your highs and lows on pandemic parenting? Send your experiences to sheceleblog@gmail.com. I am looking forward to unpacking them here.\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt’s a wrap. The fatherhood series comes to a final close and I have enjoyed transcribing them here. It’s been a fulfilling moment listening to your rich stories and picking lessons on parenting. Today’s post features a unique father who loved his children unconditionally. He was a true African breed and herein are lessons to pick from his parenting. Enjoy the read.\n\nChristabel Akwi Bikorwomuhangi\n\nWhen I think of my father, my heart falls harder and faster than I can remember, not because of things he did that were not pleasing but for the situations that I end up in that remind me of the words of wisdom he would have said to me. I miss him.\n\nWe shared jokes, he was a football fanatic and was loyal to Manchester United. We argued about politics, discussed topics that I was familiar with, which he had no clue about but was willing to learn from me. He kept prompting me with questions with intention to learn about it. Later on, I would hear him ask other people about their views on that particular subject and he would speak knowledgeably about it. After his submission, he always reminded us that he was British trained and they studied more intensely than we do in our times.\n\nRaised in a blended family, our home was a bevy of activity. Despite the crowd, we remained grounded in our values instilled to us by our parents. We lived with our cousins who studied in Kampala and lots of other relatives who were always welcome to stay as long as they wished.\n\nMy father kept us all in check together with my mother whom we fondly call Toto. Never a spanker, his eye did the magic. One look and you would know what was expected of you. Often time, I thought Toto invented the side eye, because one stare and you would literally sit up straight. The Baganda say, “kwefuga.”\n\nThey were such a formidable team that none of us ever succeeded in playing them against each other. Never once did I hear my parents fight till I left home at age twenty six to my marital home. With the crowd and all the children they raised, I still cannot figure out how they kept their cool and contained their mental health. It still remains a mystery.\n\nPapa was a teacher, then headmaster and later became a Magistrate until his retirement. This magnificent Magistrate raised an army that cannot easily be defeated. He taught us to look out for each other, fight for each other even if it meant going physical, to defend. We would later be asked the reason for the fight and on our way home, chances were high that we would all get spanked when we got home.\n\nPapa was a stickler for time. He loathed latecomers, especially if you had an appointment with him. It was wise to show up forty five minutes earlier. That earned us anything we wanted from him. He believed people who kept time were trustworthy and diligent. He did not drink alcohol and despised anyone who did. To him, anyone who drunk alcohol could neither keep their word nor another’s secret.\n\nIt was taboo to be in bed after 5:00am at our home. To Papa, early rising helped us start our day organized. Often time, we would walk around the house to check if everyone was up to their task at 5:00am either laying beds, cleaning up the house or making breakfast.\n\nTasks were distributed the night before by picking folded papers with the number of tasks assigned. There was no “girls’ chores” or “boys chores.” If a boy picked cooking or cleaning, they had to do it. He did not take it lightly when he found girls in the kitchen, he urged the boys to help. We had helps but they were the most privileged I had ever encountered.\n\nIf any of us was genuinely indisposed, we were allowed to sleep until 6:00am, then wake up and catch the morning air to enhance healing. Sometimes, we would take turns to listen on his footsteps coming our way and alert each other to get up and take on their tasks.\n\nAltar time was 9:00pm and it was not acceptable to miss. We worshipped, prayed and sat down to dinner as each one shared the days stories. Papa believed that when work was done early, everyone got time to interact and rest.\n\nMy parents were clean crazy, they ensured we bathed twice a day and dressed up smartly like we were headed somewhere. The house had to be cleaned and every corner dusted. You would think they would smell dust on windows, they always knew where the dust was.\n\nSleep overs were never allowed, not even at aunties’ homes. We were allowed to invite friends over, but never once slept out of home. To this day, I find it strange sleeping away from home.\n\nPapa invested his time in each of us, after breakfast, he would sit each of us down and ask questions that helped him understand his children’s interests and often guided on the best career path to take. His was usually counsel and if he was not sure, he would ask us to write an essay and defend it. At this point, he would explain his view point without being aggressive or hurting our feelings.\n\nAfter University, I got employed in a bank and my parents had retired to the village. My sister took me on at hers and she eventually went to live abroad. I struggled with separation anxiety and when I went to visit Papa once, he welcomed me with a bowl of porridge made with apedur that had always been my favourite.\n\nWhile at the bank, I enrolled for a Masters and this excited him because he always believed in aiming higher. He would never tire of asking about my grades and always insisted I share my results at the end of every semester. He always asked what the best student scored and this would be followed by the question, “Why weren’t you the best?” Eye roll.\n\nMy father was a defender. He was very protective of us and never took to anyone talking ill of Toto. He had a way of keeping us out of ear shot of anything ill spoken about us especially by relatives.\n\nHe loved God, his children and always referred to Toto as his lovely girlfriend. I recollect in second year when he got wind that I was dating someone and it did not rub on well. He reminded us that we were Princesses and if anyone wanted to date or marry any one of us, they had to ask for permission from him, the King. He set the bar high for men who wanted to marry girls from his household. While walking me down the aisle, he said, “If you still want to change your mind, we can just get out of here and leave.”\n\nWhile expecting my first child, he remarked, “My baby is going to have a baby.” He often called me at 5:00am to pray together and wish me a wonderful day. With advanced pregnancy coupled with exhaustion, I would set my alarm at 5:00am in order to be up to talk to him.\n\nMy house was filled with food and other necessities because he always urged my siblings to deliver different items to me. He loved and dotted on me.\n\nHis health started failing after he was diagnosed with prostrate cancer. Whenever he was taken ill, I would ugly cry thinking he would not make it out of hospital alive. It was back and forth until he eventually succumbed on June 22, 2013 at ninety one years old.\n\nWhy was his death a blow? A number of relatives remarked about how we deserved to celebrate his life because he had lived a fulfilled ninety one years. These remarks hurt because to my siblings and I, Papa seemed immortal. He had a solution to every problem, he was brilliant, our shield and eagle. I still struggle with the void. There are several things that changed because Papa was no more but I choose to pick on the lessons. Some days are harder than others.\n\nHolidays are the toughest and I usually call Toto on those hard days, and just stay silent on the phone each of us knowing what the other is going through, but unable to speak or help because as hard as it is to lose a parent, I only imagine how hard it is for her who lost her best friend, her boyfriend.\n\nMy Papa is in a better place. I wish I had more time with him, but we don’t get what we want in life, we get what we have in that moment. It is our choice to use the time to the best of our ability. He is forever my super hero. I love you Papa.\n\nA new series on the agony of pandemic parenting begins next week. I would like to hear your stories on what it has really been like raising children over the past year. The Head of State closed schools for another six weeks and the kids are back home. I would like to hear your highs and lows on pandemic parenting. Send your experiences to sheceleblog@gmail.com. I am looking forward to unpacking them here.\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nOver the past eight weeks, I have focused on stories about motherhood and fatherhood. It has been a joy documenting them and it has taught me the value of small joys. Most of us were raised with tough love and could barely express emotion to our parents. This narrative changed in the stories I received from you. Deep and vulnerable emotions were expressed in the tributes and I cannot say how much this started conversations in families. I would like to thank all those who participated.\n\nToday, my first-born son turns twelve and it is the first birthday we are celebrating with him away. He happens to be in boarding school because he has a lot of the school syllabus to catch up on after the disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\nWhy is this birthday special? It is his final preteen year before he sprouts into the stormy teenage years. Surprisingly, his voice has broken, and I cannot get over the sound of him over the phone whenever we talk. The sound of, “Hi mummy” causes excitement because it sounds heavenly with his intonation.\n\nHe is a joy to have for a son because he makes me accountable for my daily activities. He always asks what tasks I did while at work whenever I get back home. I have learnt to explain every detail about my day from the time I get to office. Some days are busier than others, but he has taught me to be accountable for my time.\n\nHe cares about others and always asks after his friends and relatives. He gets really concerned when someone he knows is indisposed or going through a difficult situation.\n\nHe has a memory of a 20-year-old, never forgetting any one he meets for the first time, by name and face. He baffles me when he meets any of my friends and relatives. Whenever we are paying the person a visit years later, he will remember their name, children, and house.\n\nHe can be an emotional wreck. I reflect on the time his best friend lost his big sister in January 2020 in a freak motor accident, and I had the difficult task of breaking the news to him. I have never been so upbeat. When I could not hold it anymore, I called him to my room and explained carefully what had happened. The wells of emotion that burst out of him were intense, we clasped each other ugly crying. He expressed the same emotion at the funeral service when he saw his friend. I had to hug them both as they embraced each other sobbing terribly. It was one of the hardest moments I have had to deal with. Death sucks.\n\nLast Friday, his class teacher sent me a snapshot of a letter he had written for story telling week, titled, “My dream.” Let me share it here.\n\nMy name is Haile and I am twelve years old. My dream is to excel with my studies, and I intend to do so by getting aggregate four in my Primary Leaving Examinations, Pass O and A level highly and get a master’s degree in Electronic Engineering. Then I will travel to Texas to begin my career at Tesla.\n\nMy biggest dream in life is to make a super car, working as a model engineer at Tesla. The reason I want to become this is because I really like the idea of supercars that Tesla has been able to make into reality. Making and using electric cars will reduce the rate of expenditure on fuel, reduce air pollution and give way for clean energy.\n\nBeing a model engineer would enable me to design a model of the super car of my dreams. When I retire, I will write books to raise awareness on global warming and how it is happening now.\n\nBefore I retire, I would design my last car which would be a luxury Tesla that would go by the name TESLA SUPRA and would only be sold to people who know or learn to drive electric cars.\n\nAfter I read his letter, I quickly shared it with his Dad who smiled with his eyes. He has that rare smile that breaks out from the corner of his lips when he is extremely proud of his kids.\n\nSon, I know you will read this later. I want you to know how proud I am to be your mother. Sometimes I feel like you are growing up too fast for me but that is how every parent feels about their kids. I cannot get over the sight of you reading on the couch or on your bed. Your love for books swells my heart whenever I buy one of your favorites and you hug me for days. I enjoy the moments we get to review and dissect the characters listening to them come alive from your big mind.\n\nI remember our recent date for a photo shoot and sightseeing at the Uganda Wildlife Education Center with your brothers, when you kept sulking, “Mummy, this is boring.” At the end of the day, you were all cheerful and grateful exclaiming, “Mummy this was good fun, thank you for the treat.”\n\nI pray all your dreams come true. You are such a thinker, a reader, and a genius. Conversations with you are about creating new things and innovating for better which warms my heart. May God grant you, your hearts desires.\n\nHappy 12th my son. Love you lots.\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nI have enjoyed unpacking these series on fatherhood over phone calls and chat with some of you. It has become a conversation starter I never imagined. Fathers are anchors in our lives, and I have learnt that our relationships with them develop firm characters in us. It disheartened me for some who I reached out to who revealed going down memory lane being quite traumatizing because they never built relationships with their fathers since they were absent.\n\nSome respondents said their relationships were transactional if they were lucky to be paid tuition for. Folks let us be present parents.\n\nGaspar Vid Okumu\n\nWhen I think of my late father, I remember his generosity. He shared his knowledge with anyone who sought his advice on any subject of his interest like farming methods or cultural practices. He was the second born of three brothers. Being in the middle enabled him bond easily with his brothers in that he became a middle pole which held the roof of the African hut firmly together.\n\nI reflect on the advice he gave me while in Primary Three when my performance in school was poor. He said that I had the opportunity to be what I wanted only if I willed it and worked hard for it and the only route to achieve that was through good education. From that day all my endeavors and efforts were guided by the advice I received from my father.\n\nThroughout my childhood from Primary Four to Senior Four, I maintained the number one position. I did this because of the guidance and words of encouragement from my father. This good performance later earned me a six-year bursary from Madhvani Foundation which enabled me study from Junior One through Senior Four.\n\nMy father’s prophetic advice saved him the burden of paying my tuition thus helping him send my siblings to good schools too. When I reminisce on this, I feel like building an edifice in his honour. Recently while up country supervising my project, I decided to name the access road to the project, Vidensio Mupe Close to ease the work of drivers delivering materials and hopefully guide future visitors to our home. By having the signpost at the junction of the main road many passersby will ask who he was, and his story will be retold.\n\nRebekah K. Mugisha\n\nWhen I think of my father, I am reminded of someone who must have been sent as a messenger on earth to validate some valid points about certain merits.\n\nWhen I think of my father, I am reminded of him as the Lord’s messenger on experiences we had to live to understand and not just be told or read out of a book.\n\nMy father was a messenger, an action messenger on so many things. One needed to have lived with him to get the depth of what it is I am trying to say. He was a messenger on loving deeply. It was either all or nothing. There was a uniqueness with the way he cherished each of his children and revealed it deeply.\n\nGod’s messenger on humour, I recall how each time as kids when we knocked ourselves against hardwood and it hurt so bad, he teased us about it despite the pain we were feeling. He was witty.\n\nA messenger on wisdom, knowing when to give in and when to let go, when to fight and when to delay. A messenger on the combination of strategy and patience – a rare combination; not worried about being considered a fool if he saw the goal in mind.\n\nA messenger on calm, a deep sort of calm, settling our fears amid storms. I cannot forget how he relentlessly asked head teachers to let us study and assured them that he would later pay, not knowing then how the money would eventually come through, trekking from one school to another if only they let us stay another study day.\n\nOn resilience, with a fighter’s attitude, one foot in front of the other, from one doctor’s appointment to another, never losing hope of miraculously getting healed one day.\n\nOn generosity, never letting anyone coming his way for help go away empty handed, no wonder his home was always full, his burial even fuller of throngs coming to lay him to rest.\n\nOn the bigger things in life, letting you understand when loving needed to cover another’s wrongs, “Eh! but daddy!” You were all these and more, teaching not with words but with every single action of your life.\n\nYou are dearly missed. My only hope is that I will look into your face one day, one more time, when we meet again. My greatest promise from the Lord is that indeed I will be able to see you again. One love until we meet again. Forever loved, my Angel.\n\nLydia John Mugarula\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think about the God-fearing man he is.\n\nBorn in 1947, he raised seven of us, five sisters and two brothers. An obsessed business professional from Mzumbe University, he worked with Regional Trading Company (RTC), Tanzania. My parents were the perfect couple, my late mum a smart home maker.\n\nHe is composed no matter what crisis arises. He is a shock absorbent and a good mediator between people amid crises. He always believes the next day will be better no matter how long it takes.\n\nHe keeps a low profile, only showing up in difficult situations to mediate and forge a way forward. He is optimistic and always encourages us to focus on the positive.\n\nNow that he is ageing, minor things tend to worry and unsettle him, but we are always keeping his hope alive. He retired and keeps himself engaged in church activities and this has kept him active.\n\nI miss that my mum is not around to keep him company through his retirement, but we always endeavor to check on him whenever we can. He is my hero.\n\nSandra Wambui\n\nWhen I think of my father, I always smile at how him and my mum have such different energy yet are so connected in a unique way. My dad is a quiet and very principled person, straight forward and will always give you an honest opinion, take it or leave it. He says less and always has crazy sardonic comments that takes an alert mind to pick on.\n\nI vividly remember those early mornings when he would prepare me for school in Primary one. He would cool my hot tea so I could drink it fast enough to beat the reporting time of 8:00am at Shimoni Demonstration School. He never missed any visitation in high school and he always responded to my cries for pocket money I guess because I was the last born and I do not remember ever lacking.\n\nThere is a lot to be thankful for, but I pray God continues to keep him healthy and strong so that I can give him all he needs.\n\nAlain St. Ange\n\nWhen I think of my father, Karl St. Ange, an island boy was the loving father and grandfather who is greatly missed today. A farmer who moved when tourism started in earnest in Seychelles to build his own hotel right on the beach on one of the Seychelles most beautiful islands.\n\nHe was no hotelier by profession, but the human side of him loved to host people. He joined politics to help free Seychelles of the colonialist set up and moved in difficult times to be an elected member of the Island’s Governing Council and Legislative Assembly. After Independence of Seychelles, he became a Minister in the Government.\n\nHis readiness to dish out advice coupled with his jovial nature made him the man who earned the name “Icon of La Digue.” He held the family together and was forever the loving Dad I cherished and loved.\n\nAnonymous\n\nWhen I think of my father, there is nothing much to think about. Thinking about him is a traumatizing experience. My father was never present, absent was his second name. I cannot begin to think about him, to be honest I admire my friend’s fathers because I never got a chance to be my father’s Princess.\n\nHis absence affected me regarding who I dated, I grew up with a sense of rejection and people pleasing demeanor. I do not face conflict in a constructive way and in men I looked for men who were absent in my life. I am learning to unlearn this now.\n\nIf you would like to send a shout out to your father, send an email to sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nThank you all for contributing to the fatherhood series. I have drawn lessons and I hope you have too.\n\nBeginning June, a new series on the agony of pandemic parenting will be shared. I would like to hear your stories on what it has really been like raising children over the past year, the highs and lows. Send your experiences to sheceleblog@gmail.com. I am looking forward to unpacking them here.\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt’s week three of the Fatherhood series and I am blessed to be writing your tributes. It warms my heart when I receive feedback about how your parents react to your beautiful posts and I believe relationships are being strengthened anew.\n\nIt is the President’s Elect Swearing In week and the number of low flying helicopters I have had to hunch under my bed and work table for are countless. Folks, let’s be patriotic and remember to honour our nation and not forget our fathers either. Enjoy the read.\n\nRuth Mbabazi Otieno\n\nWhen I think of my father, I am forced to affirm that Impossible is nothing. He is resilient, fearless, determined, and with faith that moves huge mountains.\n\nKnown by his friends as George, others call him Captain, Canon, Reverend, and yet another small girl in one of the village churches he ministered in called him ‘Ruhanga’ (God) in Rukiga because of the white clerical robes he would don, on Sundays. Well, I call him Taata. He is my daddy.\n\nBorn in a blended family in a village called Kikore in Kabale, where poverty made life unbearable, nobody would even expect him to raise six literate children against all odds. Only a fighter whose main goal is to conquer can handle this.\n\nDad’s parents were able to educate him through class eight and he relayed to us that the only clothes he would boast about was his school uniform. The school uniform was treasured to the extent that it was only worn on school days. The rest of days, hand me downs fit the purpose. On the day he accepted Christ as his personal Saviour, he was draped in his mother’s piece of cloth.\n\nDespite the difficult life, he married my beautiful mama at an early age. They reminisce on how minimalist their wedding was without a wedding gown. He later became a church teacher in a village church even though the ministry was not paying. My dad has a way with people, and he is a hard worker. This saw him rise to the rank of a lay reader in church. Tidy, disciplined, and razor-sharp with only primary school education, he was identified from the village to go and manage a church hostel in Kabale town. It was a conference Centre for the Diocese of Kigezi. I was privileged to be born here, life was good, we were fed on restaurant food daily and my siblings went to good schools. Dad believes in quality even amidst scarcity.\n\nBeing that person that gives his all when given a job, dad outdid himself and he was again picked to go to Nairobi to study to be a Church Army Captain. He had never been to Kampala but had to find his way to Nairobi. He completed his course after three years. The reason he is called Reverend Captain. Perhaps he had come to pave a way for me as I ended up getting married to a Kenyan man. We would later go back to the village as he proceeded on to study to become a Parish priest.\n\nLife in the village with dad at school was the opposite of the beautiful town life. I can not remember us ever having sugar in our porridge, sweet potatoes and beans was our daily bread. My brothers learnt to till the land before they left for school, we learnt to fetch water downhill barefooted, and use a pit latrine. We also discovered that worms could exit the human body physically. However, my dad still held the family together as a father and husband. He made sure none of us missed school or even missed a meal. One thing he taught us was never to covet other people’s lives, a lesson I still hold so dear in my adulthood. By the way, this lesson even taught me never to date for wealth as a young woman. I dated and later married for love.\n\nIn my lifetime, I have never seen dad get a demotion. When he was done with Bible College, he successfully became a Priest, and served in a rural church for only two years before he was promoted to Vicar of our Cathedral at the Diocese of Kigezi headquarters in Kabale town. A year later, he was again chosen to pursue his Diploma in Theology at the Virginia Theological Seminary in Virginia, U.S.A. The Primary Eight graduate was to board a plane and fly to U.S.A unaccompanied. What I am sure of is that both his spoken and written English were perfect. My father has read more books than most of the University graduates including me. I owe him the little English that I know. Dad made us begin reading novels at a very tender age. He was so strict with grammar, we wrote countless compositions, and he would practically wake us up early in the morning to narrate which part of the novel one had completed. Remember, he would read the novels before us, so none of us would make up a story. I can confidently say that I never failed English exams through school. I also read my local dialect perfectly well since I was nine.\n\nDad came back from U.S.A armed with his Diploma in Theology. He became the Sub – Dean of the Kigezi Diocesan Cathedral, earned the title Venerable Canon, before he went to serve as an Archdeacon in his home Archdeaconry for seven years. This time round, we did not go back to study in the village save for two of my siblings. My brother joined Makerere University on private sponsorship. Dad borrowed money for him to begin his course, while my other brother proceeded to a Teachers Training College. My sister and I proceeded to the then best girls’ high school in Kabale, Bishop Kivengere Girls’ School. Dad was so passionate about girls’ education which saw us become a priority as far as education was concerned. It was tough love though, we had to be locked in his office for hours to read, and yes, my sister and I passed our Form Four exams with flying colours. “We are in the Family Liberation Struggle,” he always reminded us.\n\nA strict disciplinarian, he did not know how to sugarcoat words. He is a typical Mukiga, he would never calm us down when he thought he had told us tough words. He let us swallow them bit by bit until we developed thick skins to be able to face the world. The Parishioners were also not spared from his strictness. I remember a time it rained heavily, and the church toilet sunk in. Being a Saturday, he had to figure out what the churchgoers would use the next day. He put up a makeshift structure to be used. Some two men thought it was not pleasant enough and pulled it down. Dad summoned one of them to our house and we heard him say to him “This Church does not belong to your Mama.” Poor man left with his face downcast and he never interfered in church affairs again. But deep within, my dad is a very generous person, very jolly, very loved and a great preacher.\n\nSeven years in a rural Archdeaconry, then back to being a Sub- Dean of the Cathedral again, one would wonder what the Diploma holder had so special that other people with better qualifications did not have. At some point his colleagues started complaining about low levels of education and big positions that were fit for holders of at least a master’s degree. I believe my dad had a special anointing from God. At one point he became a Diocesan Secretary, he oversaw all administrative duties in the Diocese. One in this position is second to the Bishop. This is the time he was my boss since I worked as the Diocesan Information Officer. He had wanted me to be a literature teacher, but I chose to do Mass Communication. I remember him taking me himself up to my hall of residence at Uganda Christian University. I remember the struggle he went through to raise my tuition fees for the first semester. I worked so hard which saw me get a scholarship and that relieved him.\n\nEven as my boss in my early twenties, he did not see that I was an adult. I had to be home by 6:00pm every evening. He did not expect me to talk to men, and closely monitored my dressing. The only time I fearlessly faced him was when I met the love of my life, my husband Bob. Being a foreigner, dad swore that I would never get married to him. He had spent three years in school in Kenya as a student, and he could not imagine how I could handle Nairobi life with githeri (maize and beans), Sukuma wiki (collard greens) and Ugali (maize meal). I wrote him a letter and made him know I was not relenting. He loved me, he feared for his baby girl, but he finally had to let me go after sessions of prayer and fasting for two years.\n\nRev. Canon Captain George Tumwine is now retired but still very active. He is the standard upon which I measure my life. I am yet to catch up with his record of hard work, resilience, strong work ethic, determination, faith, and prayer. He is my role model. Through his life, I see that indeed where there is a will, there is a way. That is my daddy, my hero!\n\nMoses Obbi\n\nWhen I think of my father, I reflect on a time at eight years old, in Jinja town, I asked him why he treated patients free of charge. His response was, “Saving and preserving life makes this world a better place for everyone.” As a child I did not understand him because I felt he was giving away what would make the family better. However, that did not reduce his giving culture to the community.\n\nAt the time the government introduced privatization in Uganda, my father lost his job. We had nothing to fall back to. All his fellow doctors who charged a fee for their community service opened clinics within Jinja, Iganga and Kampala. We had to find the most remote trading center with less medical services to settle in so he could start a business. It took us 14 hours from Jinja to Muhorro trading center on a bumpy road in 1996. The area was isolated, illusory, with minimal trust in medical services where residents lived off traditional ways. My Dad settled in, charged less to attract clients, only 12% paid for his services while the others took credit they never cleared.\n\nIt was a hard time, in Primary seven then, my Dad told me after I raised my concerns. “If you genuinely wish to help people, help them get better and life around you will improve.” My father wanted to positively impact the remote community economically and health-wise. He said the moment he got to Muhorro trading center in Kibaale district, he realized there was a lot required by the residents. According to my father, a healthy neighborhood is what drives growth and development. If one is healthy, then their mental state is good for creativity, have a strong psychological mind to participate in economic activities, and generally live a happy life.\n\nMy father, Mr. Emyedu Ojasi Micheal always had a big heart and took in a lot of responsibilities. He paid school fees for many needy children, sponsored medical bills for unable families, sensitized families on public health and spent most of his time with the community and less with his family. He is retired, not wealthy but happy. He appreciates his role to the community which he indirectly prepared for its current economic boom. He set a healthy foundation for children my age and younger to take over the development of the sub county. Many now work in government offices around the country. He may have been forgotten by the direct beneficiaries, but he is happy to have played his part in the development of Muhorro trading center, now a sub county.\n\nAnonymous\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think about the relationship we never had. It is not cool having a dad who is alive but does not care whether his kids have shelter over their heads, a meal or tuition.\n\nMy father rarely visited at home. He paid tuition once after my mother tried to beg him to. I did not mind his not coming home but it would make sense if he asked after me or tried to call but that was unheard of.\n\nOver the years, I have tried to reach out to him, but our attempted dates always turned out as a rain check. He would either hide or go mute on me. He has disconnected or changed his lines countless times whenever I tried to get in touch with him.\n\nWhen I got married, I thought fathers who loved their children were abnormal because I married one such man. God gave me a perfect husband and my perception of fathers changed.\n\nI had to go through deliverance to forgive my father. It is strange that the last time I called him to let him know, he was so rude over the phone and I have never gotten the courage to call him again. I suffered this trauma of rejection through out my childhood, but God has walked me through the forgiveness and letting go process.\n\nI am thankful to God for my husband because such men are one in a million.\n\nIf you would like to send a shout out to your father, write to sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nI was told of a heartening story about a couple who had just had a baby and were driving back home from hospital. The new father lost his father when he was two-years old. Being new to fatherhood, he did not know how he was expected to navigate this role. With worry written all over his face, navigating the car on the Express Highway, eyes filled with water, he told his wife, “I wish my father was alive.”\n\nI am a strong believer in the power of story telling and recollecting memories of our childhood and how our parents groomed and nurtured us. Therefore, I believe these stories should be retold so that our children read about how their grandparents raised us and impacted us in different ways. Enjoy the revelations.\n\nJane Wairimu Okumu\n\nWhen I think of my late father, John Maina Nyamu it baffles me because he managed to educate sixteen of us. I was raised in a polygamous home, my late mum was a second wife and she had six of us (three boys and three girls). My dad loved us all equally. We grew up together with my half siblings and are quite close to date. I was the out spoken one and he loved me so much. He loved adventure and took us to different places like Mount Longonot in the Great Rift valley of Kenya. He dropped and picked us from school to ensure our safety.\n\nIn our school C.G.H.U Secondary School in Nairobi, a group of thugs from Eastleigh used to bully and torment students. When my sisters and I told our father about it, he alerted Criminal Investigation Detectives who rounded them up and arrested them. He was a Senior Staff in Fire Brigade Nairobi, and his lot were handed over management after the British’s time was up. He and others were taken to United Kingdom for training. On his return six months later, he was appointed Assistant Divisional Officer, Nairobi Fire Service. He was housed within the Fire Brigade and that became our new home. We had the best up bringing there.\n\nDuring Christmas parties for staff and their families, he dressed up as our Santa Claus, handed out gifts to kids and got all fancy and cool. It was good fun and we always looked forward to the festive season. He was always fashionably dressed and had the best hand writing in the whole world with articulateness in English. He used to lecture his staff and his students termed him their best lecturer. After parties he dropped relatives to their respective homes late in the night.\n\nOur relatives held us in high regard and admired the good lifestyle he gave us together with our hard working mum. They were a very smart couple. We never lacked. He was able to send two of my brothers to the United Studies for further studies. It breaks my heart that they are both deceased. I still recall the celebration we had in fire brigade for their send off.\n\nBack then, Fire Brigade was under Nairobi City Council and Nairobi was a very clean City. I reminisce on how the City used to be squeaky-clean owing to their daily cleaning with soap by the City Council trucks. It was a dust free city like England. At the time, basic necessities were provided to the firemen like shoe polish, toilet paper and soap. May God continue keeping him in good hands. Till we meet again.\n\nEmma Kakai\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think of the world’s best dad. He is the embodiment of greatness. He loves me and all my friends. He shows up for my friends, you would think he is their biological father. He has taught me things that are not taught in school like being content. He has always reechoed the benefit of being content with what I have and not fancy other people’s property.\n\nHe always has and continues to affirm my fear of lack because a friend had what I did not. He always encouraged me to work hard and buy the fancy things I would like at the right time. He always stood by his word and when he could afford, he would buy it for me. I remember the missed chance to go to the United Kingdom, but he guaranteed that I would still go when God saw it fit in His perfect time.\n\nHe has always encouraged me to save. We have been out on dates and he made it a habit to remind me to always have money on me. “A lady should always have money on her.” He discouraged me from borrowing beyond my means because it always leads to envy.\n\nMy father is always looking out for others. He rescued a lady who was being beaten by her partner on the street in the wee hours of the night. My sister and I always look forward to our dates. I remember during one of our father-daughter dates while driving around Mengo suburb, we found a lady wailing and distraught because she had lost her child who had been buried. He asked her to get into the car and drove her to her home. She was devastated and had lost her sense of self. We dropped her back to her home and made sure she was safe.\n\nMy father takes interest in people. When we walk into a restaurant, he will make friends with the wait staff, ask about their families and refer to them by their first name. He does this everywhere he goes, the security personnel at different premises and all those people who feel ‘less than’ he always leaves them feeling ‘equal to.’ His humility makes me proud to be associated.\n\nHe is present, he has never missed a visitation day, a parents meeting, birthday and my wedding. We are a sports loving family, he is a Liverpool fan and I am a Rugby fan. He has recruited all his nephews and nieces to join the Liverpool fans Club.\n\nHe is selfless. He builds rapport with his students at Makerere University, mentors them on life and education choices and his easy-going nature has built him long lasting friendships. He never runs out of advice, always willing to openly supply it in abundance. He is genuine and has a clean heart.\n\nHe taught me how to use cutlery, how to be forgiving and apologetic, how to be courteous and kind. He would take a day off work to play with me and spend time with him. He is the world’s best Dad who always shows up. I love him so much.\n\nMaureen Kavuma\n\nWhen I think of my late father, I would say he was my god on earth as the Bible states it. I was raised in an extended family. My father was hospitable; our home was a pure description of Uganda, all tribes under one roof. He was a village Chairman throughout my life and that meant welcoming strangers home including lost souls who later turned into family.\n\nMy father paid school tuition for everyone who wished to go to school and having school fees for us was first come first serve not who was his child or not. He raised me single handedly and I do not owe an apology to anyone for the paths I have taken in this life save for him. He was a businessman who always travelled to Dubai bi-weekly. At school I looked rich because I owned a unique plastic suitcase, a wool blanket and constant supply of tang juice.\n\nHe was a tough guy and a disciplinarian, with close allies at Kibuye Police Station. For any mess, you could easily fall in the hands of some tough officer and walk away with some serious strokes of the cane.\n\nMy dad had no forbearance, he would call us out for any offense one of us had committed regardless of the occasion. I recall at one of the parties we hosted, in the middle of his speech, he disclosed how one of my siblings had misbehaved. He would call you out, introduce you and then publicly share your misdeeds. We always ran and hid during parties whenever he held the microphone.\n\nMy dad is one of the reasons I have reservations about marriage because I have not seen men do what he did. I grew up knowing men as sole providers because of him but I see a different set up all together. When I was in Senior Four, my dad was indisposed, and I remember asking God to keep him alive until I finished school. I am glad God preserved his life. In Senior Six, he was struggling financially, and God blessed me with Government sponsorship when I joined University. My dad is my hero. When he passed on, I was angry with God, but thankful for his life. I have every reason to be thankful for the length of time he lived and nurtured me because I would not be where I am today. Sometimes when I fail to pray, I ask God to bless me from the good deeds of my father. May he continue to rest well.\n\nElizabeth Akullo\n\nWhen I think of my father, I see the greatest and best dad in the whole world. I see pure love, selflessness and unfathomable sacrifice made to make me who I am today. I see a Prophet, Priest and King in my life. I see perfection from imperfection. I see a friend mentor, tutor, life coach and go-getter.\n\nDad instilled in us the greatest form of responsibility, accountability, transparency and integrity. He taught me to love people unconditionally and be humble in life. How God used him to give me life and the best education, possibly I could ever attain in the best schools around the world, it is purely love and sacrifice. My dad showed me the way to go in life, conduct of purity; he gave me counsel and direction in life. I think about correction and a disciplinarian, who never used sticks to spank, rather, books to engage your mind and actions in productive ventures.\n\nWhen I think of my dad, I see God in him. I see a man whose heart is after God. I see a man who values charity, no wonder, so many people passed through his hands. He raised great and mighty men and women. I see a brain behind universities, namely, Nkozi, Lira and Gulu universities. I see the best grandfather ever on earth.\n\nWhen I think of my dad, I see a bullet proof, a rescuer, and a fighter. My father never gives up on anything he desires to accomplish. He is a fighter and results oriented. He pursued me in the bush when I was abducted as a young girl by the Lord’s Resistance Army and was miraculously rescued with a few other Aboke Girls. Even with my naughtiness, he embraced me in love. Even when I was weak in some subjects in class my dad helped raise me up to match first class students. I am forever grateful.\n\nDad is so quick to forgive. I see a gentleman and a gentle soul in my father. I see a person whose moral values and clear conscience cannot be compromised. I see a clean man. God has used him to raise, groom and uplift the under privileged in society. I am so energized and refreshed every time I think of my dad. I find peace and joy in the company of my father. With his prophetic eyes I have been saved from diverse disasters. He spoke into my future, no wonder my life is moving in an upward and forward direction only. I am prospering in life because of avoidance of some mistake’s dad made and admonished us not to repeat. I see a hero when I think of my dad. I see the glory and Grace of God.\n\nI see the best gift of God to my life, family and the world around. With long life, I pray God satisfies him. That he shall flourish in life. That he shall testify of the goodness of God in the land of the living. I love and cherish my dad so dearly.\n\nRita Mihayo Chokala\n\nWhen I think of my late father, I am reminded of how he wouldn’t change his loud laughter because of his uniqueness. Wherever we went, he attracted crowds, ready to listen to whatever story he had to tell.\n\nAt home, a father to his children doing and saying the best he could, his demeanor, actions and words would linger around as a legacy where his children would take it as a gift of exemplary nature for the future to come. Now, I feel grateful and proud through his acts of kindness and love that I am able to conquer the world, however far he may be. He went to be with the Lord in November, 2020.\n\nIf you would like to send a shout out to your father, send an email to sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nFolks, I saw a cricket. I was awe-struck. It was not any kind of cricket; it was a rainbow cricket. Moving slickly in the grass, along a foot path I was treading with my husband and four-year-old son. I had to make them stare at its glamorous beauty. It took me a while to move on. It had close to ten colours on its trim body.\n\nI am thinking about how to write this post after sitting through a three-hour meeting. I am reflecting on how God creates us with different colours and tastes. When I sent out texts to different readers to write about their fathers. I got mixed reactions ranging from, “Eh! I have nothing to write about him, because he was absent,” to “Yes, of course I will write about my father and I love him.” We all have different growing up experiences and I believe it is such an honour to celebrate our parents who gave us life.\n\nThis series will last one month, and I am looking forward to presenting to you these well thought out tributes. Let us get this party started.\n\nBarbra Nekesa\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think of how much he means to me. He has always been a provider, always in charge. I am the last born after three brothers. I was and still am Daddy’s little darling.\n\nMy dad is from the lineage of the late Rev. Canon Wejuli from Busumba village, Busia District. It is a well-known and learned family. He is a hardworking, dedicated and a respectable man. He was an English teacher in Nabumali High School before moving on to the Prison’s Service where he worked and retired as a top-ranking officer. During his work life, he travelled overseas, worked in different districts, and met a beautiful nurse in Western Uganda who later became his wife. One of my late uncles told us he loved her very much. He still gets uncomfortable when she is not with him.\n\nGrowing up, my dad was always protective of me. My male friends can attest to this, they were petrified of him. We are often in stitches when we recall one or two of those encounters. I also recall on one occasion, he picked me up from a Christmas party leaving my older brothers behind and on our way home, for the first time he said “he loved me and didn’t want me staying out late.” He was tough but his soft spot for me never let him question me. He always believed in me. He was so attentive and engaged in anything that concerned me. He was my rock when I faced some rather challenging situations during my teenage years, always offering a shoulder to lean on and encouraging me forward.\n\nHe wrote us letters in school and had a signature we all admired and sort of copied. While in primary school, I took rides in his Peugeot pick-up truck daily as we went to do some market shopping in the town center. To date, he is among the last people I call whenever I get to travel to any place.\n\nHe did not escape the larger family attribute – he had charisma and was witty. He makes light of any moment, even if it is haggling in a market – this trait I picked from him. It is always a joy being around him and even in his later years, he still cracks us up. I love my parents so much and miss being with them; I often check in on them.\n\nSimon Mone\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think about a role model, one who whenever I went to school, always reminded me never to compare myself with the kids of the wealthy. I fondly recollect when we arrived at the gate of Bishop Angelo Negri Primary School in Gulu for the start of the new school term. Seated at the back of a White Suzuki Samurai, my peers from Kampala would land at Gulu Airfield in a Fokker Friendship aircraft. I would tell my Dad how my friends travelled to school and he would tell me to concentrate in class so that I travel like them in future.\n\nMy Dad was the old-fashioned kind, who never visited us in school, but made sure that we were fine. He never spanked us. On every Christmas eve when we went to sleep, he would stealthily place candy in our lockers. All the children under his care woke up to the joy of ‘jingle bells’ because he would tell us that baby Jesus gifted us. He would also belt out the popular Christmas songs in fluent German language that he mastered from the Berlin Agricultural Mechanization College. I remember him as an ardent fan of Chelsea and Germany. We lost him on January 29, 2021.\n\nCharity Jurua\n\nWhen I think of my father, I think about the generous man I was told he was. I did not have the opportunity to spend a lot of time with my father because he died early in my childhood in 1997. I do not have any concrete memories of him, but I have been told he was jolly and a free spirit. My surname is my father’s name. I have had opportunities where I meet people and get asked whether I am Michael Jurua’s daughter. They have many nice things to say about him.\n\nI am grateful that despite his early demise, my sisters and I have never lacked. We have all been able to attain education and get access to the basic needs because he was able to set a foundation. We have managed to live comfortably and are still able to live off what he left for us. His efforts have stood the test of time.\n\nEven in death, my father is my hero. In death I still feel his provision, I might not feel his protection, I might not have experienced his love and had a relationship with him. I really wish I knew who he was, I wish I had a relationship with him, I wish I had something solid to say apart from his provision, but I do not.\n\nI still love him and sometimes often dream about building a tower in Arua City and name it “Michael Jurua Towers” only if I had the funds.\n\nCharlotte Nassali\n\nWhen I think of my father, superhero is the best word to describe him. I lost my mum when I was two, our last born had just been born. We are a family of nine and the oldest was thirteen when she passed on. My father looked after us single handedly (of course with the help of nannies). He purchased all our requirements including underwear and those girly things. He was present throughout our childhood, never remarried and attended to our every need. He is my hero.\n\nDiana Wawuyo\n\nWhen I think of my father, a flood of good memories rushes through my mind, which makes it hard to pinpoint my favourite. But one thing that stands out for me was what my dad did to counteract the negative experience I had in Primary school. The memory is so vivid it feels like it happened yesterday.\n\nWhile in primary school, I was teased for having a big forehead by some girls. Way back when, we had to cut off our hair which I did not fancy because it made my head protrude visibly, well at least that was what I believed. However, when I told my dad, he used this opportunity to remind me that my forehead was just enough, and I was free to cut my hair any way I felt. He also reminded me that I was beautiful. To this day when I get insecure about my forehead, I remember that day in his office and it will forever stay with me. I am grateful to have a father like him. He is great, selfless and a generous man.\n\nThe other lesson I learnt from my father was to always treat people with kindness and I live by that motto. I have seen the importance of treating people with kindness because we all have stories that have shaped us. Therefore, rather than judging people it is best to understand them. I have missed my father especially during this time and always pray that God guides and protects him especially during this pandemic. I want my children to meet him because he will make a fantastic grandfather. They will get to experience what I did and continue to do so God willing.\n\nIf you would like to share a verse about your father, send an email to sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt has been a heartening month writing glowing tributes to mothers by you faithful readers who cheerfully wrote your thoughts. Over time, I have learnt how important it is to pay tribute to loved ones while still alive because those few power words climb on to our skin and live with us for the rest of our lives. They remain memories that never fade.\n\nThis right here is the last of the tributes to mothers and it has been such a joy for me to publish your beautiful stories. I am looking forward to the next series. Knock yourselves out.\n\nSarah Sseggane\n\nVirtuous. My mother is the embodiment of creativity and hard work. She always applied her gifts to various trades to supplement the home income so that my siblings and I could have a decent education and life. She was industrious like the Proverbs 31 woman.\n\nShe was a professional cook, who made pastries, baked, and operated a restaurant. She also had a fabric shop in the City. We were blessed with plenty of clothes because she stitched most of them. As a family we savored sumptuous meals, a skill we picked from her and were the envy of our friends because of the elegant clothes she stitched for us.\n\nA strict nurturer. Mum gave us tough love. She was stern, reprimanded and disciplined each one of us accordingly. She did not spare the rod when it came to discipline. When any of us misbehaved, she would punish and nurse our wounds later.\n\nHospitable. Mum was in her element whenever she hosted people. Often time when we returned from school, we would be welcomed home to a new family member. We were not rich but had enough to go around and share with the less privileged. We had “cousins” from all walks of life and tribe. Mum looked after them, educated them and endeavored to get them jobs or referred them to someone who would later add value to them. Mum had always been a gatherer, and this trait earned her the nickname “nsomba byuma” meaning gatherer of things in Ganda dialect.\n\nGenerous. Growing up, we had to give up our beds for visitors. One Christmas, we looked on as mum split the items we had shopped into smaller packages to share with the extended family. As kids we did not take it in good faith but the older, I grew I realized she was instilling in us the precious value of giving which would be critical in our lives.\n\nStylish. Mum loved style. Her wardrobe was filled with a collection of the most trendy and beautiful African and contemporary clothes, shoes, handbags hats and jewellery. She had a new outfit with matching shoes for every occasion. I must admit at eighty-seven, she still has a good eye for the latest style and will not hesitate to request us to purchase her something when she falls in love with it.\n\nJuliet Kiwanuka\n\nWhen I think about my late mother, I think about the best friend that can never be replaced. She was my biggest cheerleader, anchor, humble and most patient woman I ever knew. She taught me how to have intrinsic faith in God, how to look out for the good in people and not focus on their weaknesses.\n\nShe was quite a disciplinarian who believed in talking to me as opposed to punishing with a rod. She was a good chef who made cassava and beans taste good. She taught me how to make sumptuous meals.\n\nShe was my defender. I once hit a boy with a stone that almost cost him his eye, but she stood by me and paid for his treatment.\n\nWhen I think about my spiritual mother, I think of the most determined prayer warrior I’ve met. She has drawn me close to God, made me a real woman and completed the bits that my biological mother did not complete.\n\nShe nurtured me and taught me that no matter what I go through, I should never give up on my relationship with God. She has taught me to be patient with people and give them a chance to prove themselves.\n\nShe is an excellent teacher allowing people to grow the same way a child grows. I have learnt the importance of keeping calm from her. I developed a temper and became quite defensive after I lost my defender. I almost destroyed my life being defensive by doing things that would hurt me while trying to hurt my brothers.\n\nCarol Donna Ocama\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think about the whirlwind of chaos she arrives with after a long period of silence. First, you will only learn about her visit when she is on her way through one of the younger siblings. On arrival, I cannot wrap my head around how she manages to travel with so much luggage. You would think she is staying for a month.\n\nHer visits are always a fun-fare of activity which the grandchildren love because they know they will have their way with her and get whatever treats their parents had been denying them. Then there is the endless fuss of what has or has not been done right according to her which of course throws us all into commotion. This keeps us on our toes and is a recipe for a collision course.\n\nTime and again, we have disagreed on her methods which causes mayhem. Then for the sake of peace we have to agree to her method and she is elated.\n\nWhen mum is around, it a feast at ours’ everyday because she expects all the siblings to drop by to see her. She is quite hospitable, always inviting friends she has not seen in a while leading to a full house. I notice it is a way of getting all of us out of our shells so that she knows we are alive and well.\n\nAt the end of the day, she will sit quietly in her room with her Bible and Rosary, listening to Mass on Radio Maria. Never hesitant to extend an invite to join her in prayer. After two days, she will announce how she has an exam to supervise or field work assessment and that is her cue to exit. She is up when the sun rises from its slumber into the sky and presents itself boldly at the crack of dawn, before I collect my thoughts and ask when she will be back. She is headed for the bus with her favourite parting words, “I’ll see you people when I come back,” until her next surprise visit.\n\nRebekah K. Mugisha\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I am reminded of a joyous, extremely stylish lady with a bottomless pot of determination for her life goals. My mother never has dull on her lips. She knows what she wants, how she wants it and will go for it.\n\nShe smiles at storms and laughs out loud in the face of\n\ntrial. She knows that in a matter of time on her knees, she will make it through the toughest tide.\n\nShe also loves her lipstick, her stilettos, and the latest trends. At sixty years old, she will give you a run for your fashion money.\n\nHer optimism is her biggest strength, and she will cheer anyone who wants to make it to the next mile. To her everything is possible.\n\nJovic Mirembe\n\nWhen I think of my beautiful mother, I see the most ravishing, trustworthy, hardworking, and warm-hearted woman ever. I thank God every day for giving me such a sweet soul like her.\n\nI reflect on the day I got sent me back home for failure to clear tuition and the way she broke down in front of me because she did not have the money. She did not sit back, she struggled and sent me back after paying up. I love you mum and I am certain that I will make you proud one day.\n\nFancy A. Vida\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I see strength, perseverance, selflessness, patience, and unending love that spreads to all around.\n\nEsther B. Ssematimba\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I feel blessed to have been birthed by her. I honor her and love her daily. She is my nurturer and hero.\n\nRoshmin Ibrahim\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think of beauty with a purpose. The mvule tree (milicia excelsia) that is always there and everything about this tree is useful. My mother is my salt.\n\nNext week we begin the series on fatherhood. If you are interested in sharing a verse about daddy, send an email to sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt has been a worthwhile fortnight writing these series on motherhood. My heart swells when I receive feedback about how emotive mothers get after reading these tributes. Some have expressed heartening thoughts about their children humbling them, despite the tension that has built over the years nurturing them to be good citizens. I have enjoyed writing and the final series will run next Tuesday. I hope this culminates into better conversations, openness and more love shared between parents and children. I also hope we get to hear tales about fathers. Enjoy the read.\n\nCharissa Wandera\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think about resilience, strength and unconditional love. I think that when God was handing out mothers, I was first in line and was handed the best. She is loving, hardworking and quite enterprising. She will move mountains to see her children happy without losing her dignity. Is she perfect? No!\n\nMatter of fact, there are a few times she has driven me up the wall. A case in point is when I confide in her and later on calls me with a solution. Her conversation often time begins like, “By the way, about your other issue, so and so said you should handle it this way.”\n\nWith shock value, I’ll harp on about sharing my secrets and in a calm tone she’ll respond, “But I got you a solution.” I know she means well and has a clean heart but it is still a secret, mummy. The beauty about this, is that I would never trade her for anything in the world. If I can be half the woman she is, my children would be lucky.\n\nAnn Njuguna\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I miss how she picked me up. While growing up, mum once asked me, “Don’t you ever feel cold when you fall off your bed at night? I always find you asleep under your bed.”\n\nI asked her what she meant and she explained that every night while doing her routine check on us to make sure we were tucked in well, she was certain she would find me sleeping soundly off the bed like nothing had changed considering the floor would be cold.\n\nAs I grew older, she maintained picking me up. She picked me up from the brokenness of a heartbreak, she picked me up when I’d lost hope of ever finding a meaningful career or education. She picked me up without questioning me.\n\nAfter she passed on in 2012, I reflected on if she wished I should have been there while she was slipping away. Did she wish I was there to cover her? Or watch her slip away? Or affirm to her that it was going to be alright.\n\nI also reflected on what her final thoughts for us were. Looking back, she must have told God to keep us company. Isaiah 41:10 is a promise God gave me during that season, and He has always been there to pick me up ever since. I miss you mummy.\n\nBarbara A. Etyang\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I am amazed at her strength, love and devotion. I always wonder how she was able to raise my brother, her late brothers three children and I single handedly on a teacher’s salary.\n\nI always try to me put myself in her shoes and reflect on myself at 30 being able to do the same. She showed us that all we need is love and family. It didn’t matter if all she had was almost nothing as long as it was shared amongst family and with love. She is my greatest inspiration on the value of love, long suffering, kindness, perseverance, and tenacity.\n\nInnocent Robert Illemut\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I would gladly say I have the best. No one compares to her. She is my biggest support system. She has one of the biggest hearts, always putting others first. I remember when I was young, I treated her not so nicely, always provoking her, leading me to a major spanking. In that little mind of mine, I thought she was the worst.\n\nBut a mother will always be a mother. I would still end up in her arms when my friends hurt me. I will always be her one and only Innocent. That there, gets me emotive. I am always assured of her unconditional love. If I would be half the woman she is, I bet I would be the luckiest ever. Her traits are like an angel, breathing life into my soul as she bore me willing to love me and expecting the best whether I become the President, CEO or even city gambler on the streets. I sit back with a smile knowing she will always call and check on her baby. I love you mummy.\n\nHildah Rukundo\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I am reminded of the strength of a woman. She bore nine children and I being the first born was able to see how she worked hard to ensure we had food on our table. She always provided and we never lacked neither starved.\n\nMy mother was an unwavering disciplinarian, who I thought was rather annoying until I had my daughter and started relating with the experience. My mother is clean crazy and I am certain I take after her.\n\nShe is also strong willed and has maintained this even in her advanced age. She holds her beliefs and values highly.\n\nShe is highly opinionated. I pray I get to have that strength in my old age. God bless you Mama.\n\nAnita Nakitto Sank\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think of hard work and integrity. A woman so hard working that I once told her, I was incapable of being as hardworking as her but I try to emulate her. Integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. My mother is the most honest person when it comes to money. I have watched her suppliers undercharge her, and she brings it to their attention and pays the right amount of money owed.\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think of a mathematician. Unfortunately, I am an only child whose strength was in English and with zero passion for math. On most visitation days, my math teacher who was aware my mum was a secondary school math teacher often inquired, “What happened to Anita? Why isn’t she good at math like you?”\n\nI take after my father. I hope her grandchildren will be mathematicians.\n\nZoe M. Omon\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think about how hard working she has always been. There was never a time we were sent back home for lack of tuition despite her minimal income. She was a pet farmer. She is principled, although she never spanked us. She instilled in us good values by explaining the importance of being well mannered.\n\nShe is so loving, I look forward to the times I call her and i am almost certain about her hearty response, “Oh! Zoe my baby!”\n\nShe is caring and generous, always going out of her way to slaughter the biggest chicken and hand me her best lesu to wrap around.\n\nShe is courageous and roots for use of polite intonation while speaking to children. She does not advocate for use of strong language especially in the presence of children. She is ageing now but has always been strong boned. God bless her.\n\nNorah Wanok\n\nWhen I think of my mother, a well of emotions overwhelms me. She sacrificed a lot to make sure we had a comfortable life. My mum never had the best, but she would save to ensure we never lacked. We were never sent home due to lack of tuition. She always paid on time. We had all the necessities.\n\nNever did I miss any school trip or party because she always provided when I asked. She is selfless, loving, generous and always looks out for those in need. I never once doubted her inability to visit me and show up with everything I had written on my requirements list while in school.\n\nShe has always been present, whenever I was sick and when I had all my three girls in hospital. She loves God, is prayerful and always reminds me to pray. I thank God for her.\n\nWinnie Ssendegeya\n\nWhen I think of my mother, my heart is filled with joy, love, admiration and gratitude. A special woman who nurtured, sacrificed, and protected my siblings and I in the toughest of times.\n\nShe taught me to be content with the little she provided. She taught us the power of prayer and perhaps the most important lesson from her was love. My mother loved us selflessly. She literally lived her life for her children.\n\nDear God, keep her for us a little longer. I thank God every day for the life of Mama who we fondly call Kaka.\n\nBrenda Wagaba\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think about strength, resilience, patience, sacrifice and love. I think about the meaning of selflessness and truly cannot comprehend the candor of such love.\n\nHer love for me is just a portion of the love God has for me.\n\nMarion T. Nsereko\n\nWhen I think of my mother, I think of comfort, smiles but most importantly God. She emphasized the need for God in my life and belief in myself.\n\nIf you would like to share a verse about your mother, write to me via sheceleblog@gmail.com\n\nSheila Ajok Lubangakene\n\nIt’s high noon here and the series on motherhood continues this week. These stories are beginning to catch fire and I am grateful to all you folks who have responded when I asked. Fasten your belts, sit back and enjoy.\n\nRachel Akugizibwe\n\nWhen I think of my mother, my queen, prayer warrior, madam fix it, my strongest and most dependable support system. My number one fan and cheerleader. At this moment in time, my first born daughter is sitting for her Senior Six finals. This is a milestone for her.\n\nWay back when, when I was I was fifteen years old, I had her. I became a teen mother. My mother took on a role she never signed up for and did so with commitment and grace. To say God knew, would be the truth. My mother, Sarah Amooti, walked with me through the process of teenage motherhood and words can never express my gratitude to her.\n\nFast forward to the final quarter of 2019. I saw my mother at the tail end of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and caused a lockdown the entire 2020. I survived on daily phone calls to her. Due to the mitigation measures in place that included limitation of travel upcountry with the sole purpose of keeping our parents safe, I stayed in Kampala during the festive season. There are days water would fill my eyes because I missed her so bad. I lost my Dad in 2019 and I knew how lonely she was. It had to take a family emergency this year in March to enable us travel to Hoima. The reunion felt surreal. Joy and happiness filled our home when we finally reconnected after over one year. It was euphoric when she asked me to come close and touched my shoulder. That mother-daughter bonding was defining for me. I love her so much.\n\nMarion Nakku\n\nWhen I think of my mother, her hard work and resilience since day one are incredibly unbeatable. She is the true definition of a warrior"
