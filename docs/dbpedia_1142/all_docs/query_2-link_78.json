Growth cone collapse results from concomitant cytoskeletal rearrangements and detachment of adhesion sites from the extracellular matrix, via mostly unknown signaling mechanisms. In cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons, we found that Sema3A treatment stimulates the synthesis of the eicosanoid, 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), whereas Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse is prevented when 12(S)-HETE synthesis is blocked with an inhibitor of 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO). Exogenously applied product of 12/15-LO, 12(S)-HETE, mimics Sema3A-induced collapse. As observed by interference reflection and confocal microscopy, 12(S)-HETE causes the loss of growth cone adhesion sites. The adhesion site effect seems partially independent of the actin cytoskeleton because growth cones treated with Sema3A and 12/15-LO inhibitor remain spread despite actin cytoskeleton loss. These studies demonstrate that 12/15-LO activity is a necessary step in Sema3A collapse signaling in growth cones and suggest a mechanism for its action.",

        "text": "Neuropilin-1 is distributed throughout the growth cone\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence was performed on cultures of primary DRG neurons to determine the prevalence of NP-1-positive neurites in our preparations and to assess morphologically the distribution of NP-1 in their growth cones. Specific NP-1 fluorescence was observed in all neurons and neurites and thus confirmed that our DRG cultures are a valid system for studying quantitatively the growth cone responses to Sema3A (Fig. 1). Controls that omitted the primary antibody were free of fluorescence (data not shown).\n\nDetailed examination of the growth cones revealed punctate NP-1 staining. Labeling extended, at a moderate level, from the proximal domain into the thinnest regions of the growth cone periphery and into the finest filopodia. The staining in these distal regions appeared uniformly punctate. Robust labeling of neurite bundles indicated the presence of NP-1 in neurite shafts. Whether all NP-1 was on the cell surface, and whether its level was higher on neurites than on growth cones, however, was not evident because the optical superimposition of images generated by neurite fascicles contained much more plasma membrane than those of the growth cone periphery. In addition, cytoplasmic membrane elements were present. Areas of intense fluorescence (Fig. 1, asterisk) were observed occasionally in preterminal areas of fasciculated neurites. These may represent accumulations of NP-1-rich precursor membrane waiting to be inserted into the growth cone plasmalemma, they may be the result of NP-1 internalization, or they may serve some other, unknown function.\n\nEicosanoid generation in DRG neurons\n\nWe know that thrombin-treated cortical neurons and isolated growth cones generate 12(S)-HETE and that 12(S)-HETE is necessary for growth cone collapse in that system (de la Houssaye et al., 1999). To test our current hypotheses, we first examined whether Sema3A stimulated the synthesis of 12(S)-HETE. 12(S)-HETE levels were determined in sprouting DRG cultures using an immunobinding assay. Resting 12(S)-HETE levels were ∼11 fmol/μg protein (Table 1). This value is based on total protein in the cultures, rather than just growth cone protein. Because cPLA2 and 12/15-LO activities are enriched in growth cones (Negre-Aminou and Pfenninger, 1993; de la Houssaye et al., 1999), the actual level of 12(S)-HETE in DRG growth cones is likely to be higher. In response to Sema3A treatment for 2 min, the level of 12(S)-HETE increased up to approximately ninefold (Table 1). The limited number of DRG cultures that could be prepared in a single session did not allow for the generation of a dose–response curve. However, in two separate experiments an increase in Sema3A concentration from ∼0.5 to ∼1 nm raised the level of 12(S)-HETE detected 4.9- and 2.7-fold (3.8-fold average). In parallel experiments, the same increase in Sema3A concentration caused a 4.1-fold enhancement in collapse (area decrease, see below). Thus, Sema3A-stimulated 12(S)-HETE synthesis was dose dependent and paralleled the collapse response, at least within a limited concentration range. The Sema3A-stimulated increase in 12(S)-HETE was reduced to below resting level by preincubating the cultures with CDC for 45 min before exposure to Sema3A. In the micromolar range, CDC is a selective inhibitor of LOs, including 12/15-LO (Cho et al., 1991). In cultures that were treated with CDC only, 12(S)-HETE was not detectable.\n\nIs 12/15-LO necessary for Sema3A-induced collapse?\n\nTo answer this question we performed quantitative collapse assays on growth cones of rat DRG neurons in culture. Figure2 shows in representative phase-contrast micrographs the effects of the experimental treatments on growth cone morphology at the beginning (t = 0) and end of a 7.5 min challenge with a subsaturating concentration (∼0.5–1.0 nm) of Sema3A. Quantitation of growth cone collapse was accomplished by measuring total area of the same live growth cones, at the beginning and after 7.5 min of experimental treatment. This was done for 25 growth cones per experimental condition. Measurement of the same growth cones in this before/after paradigm had the advantage of determining actual change in area independent of the highly variable starting configuration of the growth cone. Quantitative results were expressed as the percentage change in growth cone area measured over the experimental time period and are shown in Figure3.\n\nWithin 3 min of Sema3A treatment, many growth cones lost their lamellipodial veils (data not shown). Treatment for 7.5 min (Fig. 2) caused the expected collapse, with a highly significant reduction of >30% of growth cone area (Fig. 3) (p < 10−4) and concomitant loss of filopodia and lamellipodia. Increasing the Sema3A concentration enhanced the collapse response to reach a saturating level at ∼75% of area reduction (data not shown). This resulted often in neurites terminating in a “club”-shaped structure that sometimes possessed a few filopodia. In contrast to thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid-induced collapse (Jalink et al., 1993; de la Houssaye et al., 1999), little or no neurite retraction was observed for Sema3A in this time frame.\n\nTo determine whether signaling involved in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse requires 12/15-LO activity, we preincubated DRG neurons with CDC, a potent and selective LO inhibitor. As a control we used indomethacin, a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, thereby blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins and related eicosanoids, but not of HETEs. The growth cones of cultures pretreated with only CDC and observed over time (up to 2 hr) were fully spread out and veiled with extensive lamellipodia and filopodia (Fig. 2, CDC). By our current criteria they were indistinguishable from untreated cultures.\n\nIn cultures pretreated with CDC, Sema3A exposure for 7.5 min (Figs. 2,3, CDC+SEMA3A) failed to induce growth cone collapse. These growth cones retained their lamellipodia and filopodia and, in some cases, continued to advance. Quantitatively growth cone areas remained indistinguishable (two-tailed t test) from those in CDC-only or control cultures. In contrast, if cultures were pretreated with indomethacin before challenge with Sema3A (Fig. 3,IND+Sema3A), growth cones collapsed, losing ∼25% of their area, essentially as though they had not been pretreated.\n\nEffects of Sema3A and HETE on adhesion sites\n\nGrowth cone collapse must occur as a result of at least two mechanisms: loss of F-actin from the growth cone periphery and disruption of growth cone adhesion sites (de la Houssaye et al., 1999;Zhou and Cohan, 2001). To test directly whether 12(S)-HETE caused alteration of adhesion sites, we used interference reflection microscopy (IRM), which allows the investigator to view, in live cells, changes in cellular adhesion sites. IRM images areas of close apposition of the plasma membrane to the glass coverslip (<10 nm) as very dark; areas of more open cellular apposition appear lighter than background (Izzard and Lochner, 1976).\n\nFigure 4 shows representative IRM images taken of growth cones before and after 7.5 min of challenge. At the onset of challenge, growth cones exhibited a variable but primarily punctate and somewhat radial pattern of close (dark) adhesions with occasional bright (intermediate) adhesion areas (Fig. 4, left panels). After Sema3A or 12(S)-HETE challenge, the growth cone contact area was reduced greatly. Some close contact areas were changed to bright (Sema3A, arrowhead), indicating loosened adhesion. To quantify these changes, growth cone images were processed digitally by thresholding to isolate and measure the dark adhesion sites (Fig. 5A). Over the 7.5 min experimental time period, dark areas of control growth cones did not change significantly (−8 ± 6%; mean ± SEM). In contrast, Sema3A or 12(S)-HETE treatment of the cultures decreased the dark regions by ∼45%, a value that is greater than the growth cone area decrease reported above (Fig. 3). This provides direct evidence that Sema3A and exogenous 12(S)-HETE rapidly cause at least partial dissociation of adhesion sites in growth cones. Quantitatively, i.e., for the population of growth cones analyzed, CDC pretreatment plus Sema3A challenge did not reduce close contact area. Of particular interest was the appearance of a prominent, almost continuous distal band of attachment. Instead of the primarily radial pattern of dark areas at 0 min, we observed an IRM-dark peripheral band adjacent to a more distal IRM-bright rim of close and intermediate attachment, respectively (Fig. 3, CDC+Sema3A, 7.5 min). Although IRM patterns of thin structures must be interpreted with caution, a marginal band of adhesion was evident.\n\nWith a complementary approach we examined how both the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion sites were affected by our experimental treatments. We fixed cultures after challenge and then stained them with fluorescent labels for F-actin and the adhesion site protein, paxillin. In previous studies paxillin has proven to be an excellent marker of adhesion sites (Ross et al., 2000). Figures6 and 7show the confocal images of the attachment areas of the growth cones. CDC-treated (Fig. 6, CDC) growth cones exhibited broadly spread lamellipodia with F-actin-positive radial ridges that originated near the neurite shaft and extended to the distal edge of the growth cone. The area of greatest label intensity was near or at the distal edge. Paxillin staining in these cultures appeared as a partially overlapping, punctate pattern. It was particularly dense in the neurite and central region of the growth cone but extended all the way into the periphery. The function of the high paxillin level in the neurite is unknown. Relative to the other peripheral areas of the growth cone, the paxillin puncta seemed to be slightly more concentrated along the distal edge and the radial ridges highlighted by F-actin. This observation is consistent with a requirement for distal adhesion sites in the spread growth cone.\n\nAfter 7.5 min of Sema3A treatment (Fig. 7, Sema3A), growth cones had lost their lamellipodia and all but a few of their filopodia, with the actin cytoskeleton being collapsed to a proximal, “clumped” pattern, where it colocalized with paxillin. This is consistent with what others have observed (Fournier et al., 2000b). Interestingly, we observed a very similar response in thrombin-treated cortical neurons (de la Houssaye et al., 1999), which supports the idea that proximal “clumping” of actin may represent a universal feature of growth cone collapse.\n\nWe also examined cultures that were pretreated with CDC before Sema3A challenge. In most cases (Fig. 6, CDC+Sema3A), the growth cones remained spread out and retained their lamellipodia despite having lost their radial actin ridges. Fluorescent intensity for both paxillin and F-actin was strongest along the distal edge of the growth cone, where they colocalized (yellow). This yellow band seemed to correspond to the peripheral band of attachments observed by IRM in the same type of experiment (Fig. 4). This led us to suspect that the adhesion sites remained intact, especially along the distal edge, notwithstanding the compromised structural integrity associated with loss of distal F-actin. Some degree of proximal F-actin clumping also was evident in these growth cones.\n\nGrowth cones of DRG neurons treated with 12(S)-HETE lost a significant fraction of their spread area and close contacts (Figs. 2, 3, 4). However, in growth cones that were not yet fully collapsed (Fig. 7,12(S)-HETE), we observed that a significant amount of F-actin remained distributed in the growth cone periphery, chiefly in filopodia, with some actin ridges still evident (see corresponding single channel image). Little or no actin clumping was observed proximally in these cases. Paxillin was distributed in a somewhat more condensed punctate pattern, extensively colocalized with F-actin. The paxillin-enhanced distal edge of the growth cone, characteristic of CDC + Sema3A experiments, was not evident.\n\nRole of eicosanoid in Sema-induced collapse\n\nOur cultured DRG neurons exhibited a uniform population of NP-1 receptor-positive growth cones. This enabled us to investigate the role of 12/15-LO in Sema3A signaling. Cellular eicosanoid generation depends on the supply of arachidonic acid, a PLA2cleavage product. Indeed, the collapsing factor, thrombin, greatly stimulates PLA2 activity in isolated growth cones (de la Houssaye et al., 1999). However, PLA2 is such a widespread biological activity that its changes (e.g., triggered by Sema3A) in a subset of cellular elements (e.g., growth cones in DRG cultures) are difficult to detect against background levels. The next step in 12(S)-HETE synthesis, catalyzed by 12/15-LO, appears to be more specific. The recent introduction of a highly sensitive immunobinding assay for 12(S)-HETE has made it possible to measure Sema3A-induced changes in the level of this eicosanoid.\n\nWhen exposed to Sema3A, DRG cultures increased the level of 12(S)-HETE several-fold. This increase was comparable to that observed for thrombin-treated, isolated growth cones (de la Houssaye et al., 1999). In these earlier growth cone studies, we measured rates of eicosanoid synthesis from exogenous radiolabeled substrate. Because those data are not directly comparable to the actual eicosanoid levels in DRG cultures shown here, we analyzed isolated growth cones with both assays in parallel, using thrombin as the repellent factor. Our results (data not shown) suggest that the 12(S)-HETE accumulation expected from the measured, thrombin-stimulated increase in eicosanoid synthesis [radiolabel assay; see de la Houssaye et al. (1999)] is comparable to the actual increase in 12(S)-HETE as determined by immunobinding. Also of importance, at least within a limited range of Sema3A concentrations, growth cone collapse and 12(S)-HETE generation increase roughly in parallel, suggesting that 12/15-LO may play a role in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse, as in thrombin signaling.\n\nTo test this hypothesis we inhibited 12/15-LO activity by pretreatment of the cultures with CDC, a selective blocker of LOs (Cho et al., 1991). Biochemical measurements showed that CDC decreased even Sema3A-stimulated 12(S)-HETE levels to below control. In these conditions, Sema3A failed to cause growth cone collapse. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, did not interfere with collapse triggered by this repellent. These results indicated that 12/15-LO is necessary for Sema3A-induced collapse. To assess whether 12(S)-HETE is sufficient to cause collapse, we applied exogenous 12(S)-HETE to DRG growth cones, with or without previous CDC incubation. As in the case of cortical neurons (de la Houssaye et al., 1999), growth cones of DRG neurons collapsed in response to 12(S)-HETE, regardless of the presence of CDC. The result indicates that this eicosanoid can reverse the CDC inhibition of collapse and that it is sufficient to cause collapse. Interestingly a regio-isomer, 5(R)-HETE, increased rather than decreased growth cone spread by a small, but significant, amount. Therefore, the 12(S)-HETE-induced collapse is a specific effect of this isomer.\n\nEicosanoids and growth cone adhesion\n\nOur earlier experiments with isolated growth cones demonstrated that thrombin or thrombin receptor-activating peptide causes growth cone detachment from the substratum independent of the actin cytoskeleton. Because experiments involving isolated growth cones are not feasible for DRG neurons, we examined their attachment to the substratum by IRM. Within minutes, Sema3A and exogenous 12(S)-HETE were seen to reduce areas of both intermediate and close contacts. Close-contact areas were shown to change significantly, and this reduction in contact was greater than the decrease in growth cone area observed under the same conditions. However, CDC inhibited the Sema3A-induced reduction in contact area. These observations indicate that 12(S)-HETE diminishes growth cone adhesion.\n\nTo study changes in growth cone adhesion in further detail, we analyzed growth cone collapse by confocal microscopy, using paxillin antibody and phalloidin to reveal adhesion sites and F-actin, respectively. The observed high level of paxillin in the neurite shaft is surprising and difficult to explain at the present. The images of control (or CDC pretreated) and of Sema3A-collapsed growth cones were consistent with earlier reports (Fournier et al., 2000b). Most striking was the result of the CDC + Sema3A experiment: growth cones remained spread out and exhibited a distal, continuously labeled rim of paxillin as if the adhesion sites had consolidated into an adherent margin. The usually radial F-actin pattern had disappeared, but a distal rim of actin, colocalized with paxillin, persisted. Corresponding IRM images did indeed show such a distal rim of attachment. In other words, growth cones remained spread and attached by a peripheral band of paxillin- and F-actin-containing adhesions despite Sema3A-induced F-actin loss more proximally. This result is consistent with what we observed in previous studies in which CDC + thrombin-treated growth cones of cortical neurons remained spread, although the majority of F-actin was lost (de la Houssaye et al., 1999). Therefore, inhibition of 12/15-LO does not appear to block F-actin loss within the time frame of these observations.\n\nIn contrast to the previous experiment, the paxillin- and F-actin-containing rim seen after CDC + Sema3A was not evident in growth cones treated with 12(S)-HETE or with CDC + 12(S)-HETE (data not shown). The growth cones of 12(S)-HETE-treated neurons collapsed, although F-actin retained a rudimentary radial pattern. This would be expected initially, if an otherwise intact growth cone were to lose first its attachments to the growth substratum. These findings are consistent with the 12(S)-HETE-induced loss of paxillin from adhesion sites that we observed in pseudopods of carcinoma cells (Ross et al., 2000).\n\nStructurally, the integrity of adhesion sites and that of the F-actin cytoskeleton are known to be interdependent (Critchley et al., 1999;Small et al., 1999). Our data suggest, however, that growth cone collapse depends to a significant degree on the disassembly and detachment of adhesion sites, via a signaling pathway that may be partially distinct from that regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Support for this interpretation stems from the preferential inhibition of adhesion site disassembly by CDC, as shown here, and from the fact that thrombin-induced growth cone detachment does not require a functional actin cytoskeleton (de la Houssaye et al., 1999). Our observations suggest, furthermore, that the 12/15-LO product, 12(S)-HETE, affects primarily the adhesion sites.\n\nThe search for molecules that mediate Sema-induced growth cone collapse has identified a number of potential signaling elements. Members of the Rho family of GTPases, especially Rac1, have been implicated in collapse (Jin and Strittmatter, 1997; Zanata et al., 2002). Rac1 seems to control the changes of the actin cytoskeleton associated with collapse (Kuhn et al., 1999). However, Rho family GTPases also are necessary for growth cone spreading (Mackay et al., 1995), and Rho may be more important for neurite retraction than collapse (Arimura et al., 2000). Also, inhibition of Rho blocks lysophosphatidic acid-mediated growth cone collapse in neuronal cell lines (Jalink et al., 1994) but causes growth cone collapse in sensory neurons (Jin and Strittmatter, 1997). There is no doubt that Rho family GTPases are involved in the cytoskeletal reorganizations accompanying growth cone spreading and collapse, but it remains unclear whether they are steps in the repellent receptor-activated signaling cascade. The CRMPs (Goshima et al., 1995) have been implicated in collapse but today seem more likely to regulate microtubule dynamics and axon formation (Gu and Ihara, 2000; Inagaki et al., 2001). Therefore, a consistent picture of repellent signaling has failed to emerge so far.\n\nHow 12(S)-HETE regulates the disassembly of adhesion sites and collapse is unknown. Is there cross talk between 12(S)-HETE generation and the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton? Interestingly, 12(S)-HETE has been implicated indirectly in Rac1 signaling (Wen et al., 2000). This could explain our observation that 12(S)-HETE treatment of cultured DRG growth cones causes partial F-actin loss, in addition to adhesion site disassembly. However, our own preliminary data suggest that 12(S)-HETE activates a PKC isoform, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of the adhesion site protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (our unpublished observations), a protein involved in cell spreading (Rosen et al., 1990; Myat et al., 1997; Laux et al., 2000)."
