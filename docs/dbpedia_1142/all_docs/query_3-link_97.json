        "text": "The following article came from Dr. Carol Brown’s research. We have been working together – her Equipping Minds Curriculum uses our Maintaining Brains Everyday, and our Brain Advancement Coaching using her Equipping Minds workbook. Both methods are based on the Pyramid of Potential model of brain development, which I have used for the past 15 years. I knew that this method worked, Carol knew it worked, now she has proven it through rigorous testing. I have added to the article below the references to Brain Advancement Coaching.\n\nFor more information, to find a coach or to become a coach, go to www.brainadvancementteam.com.\n\nIQ and Academic Scores Increase\n\nBy Dr. Carol Brown\n\nStudy supports Equipping Minds increases verbal and\n\nnonverbal abilities, IQ, and academic skills.\n\nIn my doctoral research, I looked at the transfer effects of cognitive development training with Equipping Minds Cognitive Development Curriculum (EMCDC) [Brain Advancement Coaching].\n\nThirty-two students with a diagnosed specific learning disorder (SLD) were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Half of the students trained with EMCDC (Training Group) and the other half received extra academic tutoring (Active Control). Each group received training or academic tutoring for one hour a day, five days a week for 30 hours over 7 weeks.\n\nBEFORE TRAINING: A qualified professional measured their working memory, verbal and nonverbal abilities, IQ, and academic skills. Students in the Training and Active Control attended a private school for students with learning difficulties and were 4th through 8th graders.\n\nASSESSMENTS : Alloway Working Memory Assessment (AWMA-2), Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-2) and Terra Nova Annual Academic Assessment for 2015 and 2016\n\nINTERVENTION: The Equipping Minds Cognitive Development Curriculum (EMCDC) is designed to strengthen existing neural connections and, more importantly, to create missing neural pathways that may inhibit one’s ability to learn. EMCDC employs a holistic approach to cognitive development training through primitive reflex exercises, sensory-motor development exercises, and cognitive developmental exercises [the same as Brain Advancement Coaching, both based on the Pyramid of Potential]. The participants in the training group received cognitive developmental training for 60 minutes, 5 days a week for 7 weeks in a small group of two participants with a trained mediator using EMCDC. The Maintaining Brains Everyday DVD for the primitive reflex exercises and the fear paralysis exercises were done by the participants at home or at school for 15 minutes a day. The sensory-motor development exercises included the use of sound therapy which the participants wore during the one-hour intervention sessions while doing the cognitive developmental exercises. The mediators follow an abbreviated format of the EMCDC full program as the intervention was limited to 30 hours. The participants in the active control group received academic support with a teacher for 60 minutes, 5 days a week for 7 weeks in a small group. All participating learners continued to receive standard special educational support services as a result of their learning difficulties.\n\nAFTER TRAINING: While the Training group made gains in working memory, it was not at a statistically significant level. However, the Training group showed statistically significant improvements in verbal and nonverbal abilities, IQ, and science. In fact, the Training Group made greater improvements in reading, science, language, and social studies than the Active Control Group. The Active Control, who received 30 hours of academic tutoring did not make significant improvements in working memory, nonverbal abilities, IQ, or academic skills. However, they did make gains in verbal abilities.\n\n…the findings from the current study are consistent with Feuerstein’s research that training cognitive functions can have significant impacts on cognitive and academic abilities. The Equipping Minds Cognitive Development Curriculum (EMCDC) is a method of cognitive skill development in the areas of processing, working memory, comprehension, and reasoning, which are based on correcting the deficient cognitive functions as described by Feuerstein.\n\nAdditionally, this present study demonstrated that it possible to use EMCDC to raise the cognitive abilities of learners to an extent that has previously not been linked to learners with these disorders in 30 hours over 7 weeks. The current research found that training in working memory, processing, comprehension, and reasoning with EMCDC does provide convincing evidence to the generalization of verbal abilities, nonverbal abilities, and IQ composite. Similarly, far transfer effects to academic abilities in science were substantiated with significant gains using EMCDC. The results support the findings in neuroplasticity. EMCDC’s use of a human mediator and cognitive developmental exercises, which are based on developing cognitive functions, have a greater impact than working memory training by a computer program alone.\n\nWho cannot possibly reach the goals set for them? Who has to teach children who by definition cannot be taught? Of course, the special education teacher. But it doesn’t always have to be this way!\n\nThe children in special ed who have the designation of learning disabled may have a fairly low IQ score, or are average but cannot learn easily. In order to succeed – which means they can pass courses – they are given a lot of help. They have smaller class sizes, less work, more time and other accommodations. But that does not make a change in how they learn.\n\nToday we know of the concept of neuroplasticity – that the brain can make new connections at any time in life. This means that IQ can improve.\n\nWait; WHAT??!?\n\nYes. Our very tough students, who we drill math facts and sight words into day after day but they don’t stick, can actually improve their capacity to remember, attend, and process. Yes, you, the special education teachers who love your students and hate to see them suffer, can have hope for your charges.\n\nIs there evidence that IQ can change? Of course there is research; see https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/154643/tpr-vol61-no2-cassidy.pdf by Cassidy, Roche & Hayes, 2011. But you know it can improve when we look at Gabby Gifford who has recovered so well from a gun shot wound to the head. This is an obviously extreme case, but after intense occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy, she regained her ability to speak and live a functional life. Without such therapy, she would still be lying on her hospital bed, unable to move or request water.\n\nWith this in mind, doesn’t it seem like it should be simple to improve the ability of a person with Dyslexia to read? With Dysgraphia to write? With Dyscalculia to do math? It is!! This is the area in which I have been working for the past 16 years. Yes, it is simple to improve the brain, but it is not easy.\n\nFirst I must tell you that there is no silver bullet. Although the system I will describe is integrated and comprehensive, has been quite successful, and has helped improve about 95% of the cases I have seen, there remains a couple of mystery cases.\n\nIn the first case I had, over two years of work, this fourth grade student’s IQ score raised by 20 points, and she was out of all remedial classes. She eventually graduated from a private 4 year year college with no accommodations and no tutors with a GPA of over 3.0. A more recent young girl was in 5th grade when I worked with her. She entered Middle School with no IEP or Resource Room and by the end of the year was on the high honor role. This work is life-changing; even life-saving! She is a senior applying to college now.\n\nYou might think that I must be an amazing teacher (perhaps I am, but I honestly don’t know) and that only I can get these results. So read further to hear from other educators and their experiences.\n\nJust a quick note from California. I have a student that a year ago was basically a selective mute on the Autistic Spectrum. I have put a lot of work in class working in the Moro and can report that she changed like a light switch coming on. She is speaking in class, she will transition independently, is reading basic readers, and is exhibiting significantly fewer behaviors to the point that we may be removing the 1:1 behavioral specialist from her IEP.\n\nMark S\n\nOver the years I have seen that no two cases are exactly the same. However, the journey has similar elements, and those elements have been put together into the system I call the Pyramid of Potential.\n\nIn order for the brain to develop, and new connections to be made for permanent learning, you must start with proper nutrition, and low stress. Proper nutrition includes low sugar, omega 3 fatty acids, and sufficient protein at every meal. Low stress is important because trauma or highly stressful situations can damage the connections in the brain.\n\nNeuro-development for kids who struggle in school happens by re-creating the early stages of development to open the pathways to the higher cognitive portions of the brain. This is done through simple physical exercises that take less than 15 minutes a day, and that integrate the primitive reflexes that babies are born with. For example, if the Moro reflex is not integrated, a person may have hypersensitive hearing, or someone who still has the Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex may have difficulties with telling time, or really understanding the passage of time. Integrating the Spinal Galant reflex sets the brain up for improving memory. More information can be found at http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/primitive-reflexes.\n\nDear Kathy,\n\nMy daughter is 7 and struggling a lot in school. She cannot do any math, has difficulty knowing where she is at when she is reading. She has troubles with writing and composing anything to write. I did these exercises with her and after a week, she was up to reading 65 words a minute (she was at 30 a minute prior) and she is recalling more math. I am very excited about this.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLaura Kenney, MOTR/L, CSRS\n\nOnce the pathways have been opened, the sensory motor system can be more easily remediated. If there are auditory issues, sensory integration issues, or dyspraxia (poor motor control), working with an occupational therapist who deals with this and who gives listening therapy can really help. Speech and language pathologists know how to help with the auditory issues as well. Vision therapy is given by behavioral or developmental optometrists, who have additional education beyond your average optometrist. If vision therapy is still necessary after occupational therapy, the length and cost of therapy is reduced by completing the OT first.\n\nOnce the neural pathways are opened and the body is better put together, cognitive training is the next best thing to do. This typically trains the brain to do the skills necessary for academic work that may be lagging, such as memory, processing speed, attention, and logic. The training must be intensive. If it is too easy, the brain does not change because the connections were already there. If the training is too hard and frustrating, the brain shuts down. Challenging work is between easy and frustrating, and is engaging. The training must be done daily for several months in order to make permanent increases in IQ – just like a habit cannot be done once in a while or for only a couple of weeks. With some programs guaranteeing a two year increase in a deficient skill within three months of training, it is absolutely worth it!\n\nNovember 19. 2015\n\nAt the beginning of class last year, I hesitantly sacrificed 10 – 12 minutes to do the Maintaining Brains Everyday exercises. I soon found out that I was not sacrificing one moment of time! Not only were we exercising, but we were getting through the entire lesson cycle! My students were more focused and able to remember what I was teaching them! I noticed improved reading, spelling, and handwriting as well as an overall improvement in their classes. Teacher’s started commenting on how much better they were doing in class and wanted to know what we were doing differently. But most of all, the student’s themselves were excited to share with me the changes in themselves. They noticed a huge difference from the inside out!\n\nBut what I am amazed about this year is that it all “stuck”! My students are much easier to teach this year. I remember saying, “I can teach them to read, but I don’t know if they will ever be a good speller!” That too seems to be changing. At least now, they can remember the rules and why they have to apply them. Last year, I also incorporated Kathy’s Growing Brains Phonemic Awareness using a metronome with my class. They loved it because they could see how they were improving and were able to do things at much higher speeds. Now, whenever we move from one kit to another, we spend very little time on phonetic spelling and can go right to situational spelling and word formulas.\n\nCarol Crawford, CALT\n\nNow you know that the most difficult job can also be the most rewarding!! Imagine having the power and ability to take a frustrated learning disabled child from having low self-esteem and little hope to being on the honor role with no outside help! It is possible, it has been done.\n\nGood Morning Kathy!\n\nAs promised, I wanted to give you an update on how our program has progressed at Lakewood Elementary School (Twin Lakes Wisconsin). Our team of three trainers began by working for six weeks with a pilot group of two 3rd graders. We concentrated on the moro and palmar primitive reflexes and the working memory and processing speed cognitive skills.\n\nHere are the results of our most neediest student after just six short weeks:\n\nSkill: Pretest > Post (Age equivalent scores)\n\nProcessing Speed: 5 > 7.9\n\nWorking Memory: 6.3 > 7.5\n\nLong Term Memory: 5.5 > 6.8\n\nVisual Processing: 5 > 5.2\n\nAuditory Processing: 7 > 8.5\n\nLogic & Reasoning: 5 > 9\n\nWord Attack: 7 > 11.8\n\nClearly, we have a lot going on here in terms of brain based interventions, and I want to sincerely thank you for your help throughout the process. Please let me know if you have any questions!\n\nHave a nice day!\n\nRyan McBurney\n\nFor more information, go to http://www.pyramidofpotential.com. The program Growing Brains Everyday includes the steps from the Pyramid of Potential in a single 150 day curriculum, which requires only 15 minutes a day.\n\nKathy Johnson, MS Ed has been improving brains since 1999, wrote The Roadmap from Learning Disabilities to Success and several other books, curricula and DVDs, does professional development for PESI, Inc., schools and clinics, and volunteers with older adults teaching a memory improvement class. She resides with her husband in Saratoga Springs, NY.\n\nYou have a problem – someone you know cannot read well, and you want to help. Well, help is on the way!\n\nI have learned to look much deeper than an appropriate reading program for the faltering student. If a good reading teacher in a good public school cannot teach a particular child to read, it is not the teacher or the method. There is something wrong that must be considered first.\n\nThere are two main causes of reading difficulties: problems with vision and auditory processing. Today I address auditory processing.\n\nSome people have difficulty learning to read because they have had difficulty processing sounds that they hear. Their hearing is good; in fact many of these people have extremely sensitive hearing. Perhaps their hearing is so good that they can hear far away noises before others, or can clearly hear what is being said in the next room.\n\nSo, even though they can hear well, what they hear does not get properly processed in the brain. They may not be able to easily distinguish the difference between similar vowel sounds like a, e, I, o, or u. Also, they may not be able to hear the difference between m and n, or f, sh, and ch.\n\nHow difficult it must be to learn how to read words like fish, church, men, much, fun, and other similar words! The sounds are too much alike! People with this problem don’t understand the “game” of reading, because it makes no sense. They can hear and understand words in context, but pulling words apart into sounds is too difficult for them.\n\nMemorizing every word is not an appropriate strategy, since there are 50,000 words in the English language. Many kids with reading problems also have memory issues. So what to do? Give up?\n\nNo!\n\nIf someone has an auditory processing disorder, he or she can hear well, but cannot process sounds well. This is because the brain was not set up for this in infancy. Most of the brain groundwork is laid during the first year of life. It happens while the baby is going through physical development – neural development is happening at the same time. The specific stage of development for auditory processing is completed during the Spinal Galant primitive reflex integration, from about birth to 6 months. He or she needs to replicate the stage in infancy by doing simple exercises 10 minutes a day for about a month. To learn more about how to deal with this, go to http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/maintaining-brains.\n\nOnce the reader has created these pathways, he or she can now more easily process sounds, and is ready to learn the correspondence of letters to the sounds they make, for example that the letter e makes the “ehhh” sound. I have been able to teach 12 year olds their vowel sounds in a week once this was complete, whereas their teachers were not able to do this for the past 6 years. I was only able to complete this feat because she did the reflex work first.\n\nAnother option is to do some listening therapy. There are clinics with professional oversight, or some occupational therapists and speech and language pathologists offer home programs. These are wonderful for quickly overcoming hypersensitivity and increasing auditory processing difficulties, but know that it is not a cure. There is a possibility of regression. It appears that a combination of Spinal Galant integration with the listening therapy is the most powerful and lasting. Some options are The Listening Program, Therapeutic Listening, Sound Therapy, Integrated Listening Systems, Tomatis, Ease and more.\n\nA third option is to use a program to teach the missing auditory processing, also called phonemic awareness. Many schools have used a school-wide computer program, and many families have had good results with inexpensive computer programs. Do your homework, as I know there are more programs being developed all the time. Use these programs after the other therapies have been completed for lasting results.Try FastForWord, Earobics or Ear Builder.\n\nTeaching phonemic awareness – blending (putting sounds together into words), segmenting (taking words apart into sounds), and phoneme manipulation (changing the sounds in a word) – is very easy once the child can process sounds well. I added phonemic awareness into the Growing Brains Everyday curriculum, and a Dyslexia Teacher from Texas, Carol Crawford, said it was the best she’s seen. http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/growing-brains\n\nThen learning to read is a matter of teaching the letters that go along with the sounds. Any very good program will do well!Then, to teach reading the words as quickly as I can, I have used Reading Reflex by McGuinness. As a matter of fact, I was able to get a fifth grader to read above grade level in just about 4 weeks. I’m not the greatest teacher in the world, I just set the groundwork and use excellent programs. And you can too!\n\nDyscalculia:\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders [DSM-5] (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2013) is used across the world to provide core standards for diagnosis. Their diagnostic criteria for mathematical impairment in specific learning disorder are problems with ‘number sense, memorization of arithmetic facts, accurate or fluent calculation and accurate math reasoning’ (APA 2013, p. 67). DSM-5 states that if the term ‘dyscalculia’ is to be used then this implies that the diagnosis refers to a ‘pattern of difficulties characterized by problems with processing numerical information, learning arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculation’ (APA 2013, p. 67).\n\nNumber sense is understanding what math is all about. In the past 14 years while I have been helping people of all ages overcome learning issues, I have noticed an improvement with understanding of math after “integrating the Moro Reflex”. Twelve year old Katelyn, a student of mine, after doing nothing else to help her math and after integrating the Moro reflex for about 4 weeks, suddenly went from not being able to count objects correctly (even 3 or 4), to being able to apply math in a current life situation. I may be a good teacher, but there is no way I could do that in a month!!\n\nAlso necessary for number sense is good sequencing, which is set up in the brain while integrating the Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex. Understanding and telling time actually comes from good sequencing – after all, time is just a sequence of moment to moment.\n\nMemorization of arithmetic facts requires good visual and short-to-long-term memory skills. Memory is set up in the brain during the Spinal Galant reflex, so integration of this is a must. In order to have good visual skills, all primitive reflexes should be integrated. Improving visual memory with cognitive training is best done after primitive reflex integrations, so that the\n\nCalculation: In order to do higher level calculation, a sufficient working memory is necessary. The average working memory of a person 7 years old or older is the ability to hold 5 discrete pieces of information in the brain. This means if a person has a low working memory, he or she cannot hold math facts AND steps AND concepts in the brain at once. However, working memory can be improved, using cognitive training (brain training) – just be sure that the reflexes are integrated first. If they are not, the training is less effective and more costly.\n\nFor more information on primitive reflexes, go to http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/primitive-reflexes/\n\nFor more information on how to help your child, go to http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/dyscalculia\n\nIf you are a professional and want more information, go to http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/professionals/\n\nSuccess!\n\nAfter Lia’s first experience with the Moro exercise, she jumped up from her chair and said, “I want to do some math”, promptly sitting down and voluntarily doing some computation problems.\n\nI’m keeping a journal with the interesting things she has said and done since we started doing Starfish. Some things have to do with numbers that used to be confusing that are clarifying, such as saying, “At my birthday party 2 months ago…..” (which was exactly right, not 2 weeks ago or something else she used to say……or just avoid the numbers altogether). Expressive language and articulation are a notch better as well as her desire to be organized. But most of all we see a jump in self-confidence: 2 things she used to be afraid of, swimming and birds, she recently told us she “loved” and has begun swimming the length of the YMCA pool over and over again without stopping or using any flotation prop at all.\n\nHer tutor told me today that Lia automatically got the division facts because she understood them to be the reverse of the multiplication facts she had memorized. (Reverse reasoning has been hard for her in the past.) I’m (happily) having trouble keeping track of all these little triumphs in the journal I’m keeping.\n\nAnne\n\nTo learn about Starfish, go to https://youtu.be/fQ4K9sw7by8\n\nResearch\n\n“Primitive Reflexes and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Developmental Origins of Classroom Dysfunction” describes an overlap of ADHD behaviors and retained infant reflexes. The boys in the study that were diagnosed with ADHD had significantly higher levels of retained infant reflexes than the boys who were not diagnosed with ADHD. The main reflexes that were retained are called Moro, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex (TLR), Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR), and Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (STNR). The retention of these reflexes also corresponded to lower math achievement than the boys who were not diagnosed with ADHD and had lower levels of retained infant reflexes. It was also discovered that an active Moro reflex inhibits the integration of the other three reflexes.\n\nInternational Journal of Special Education 2004, Vol 19, No.1\n\nhttp://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/71757/Important%20Subjects/Primitive_Reflexes.pdf\n\nWhat to do with a concrete thinker? You know, the person that only knows exactly what you say, not necessarily what you mean?\n\nI once had a client whose mom told me the following story: Her daughter was walking out the door, and she said “It’s Cold outside”, to which her daughter said “OK Mom” before continuing to walk out the door. The daughter thought the mom was informing her of the weather, when actually the mom meant that she should put on a sweater! This is common with a concrete thinker – one who has not yet developed deductive reasoning or good logic skills.\n\nAcademically you see this child having troubles with translating word problems into the appropriate math equations. They may also have troubles with reading comprehension. If the comprehension question mirrors the language in the text, the child may be able to find the appropriate text and fill in the blank. But understanding the text and being able to manipulate language surrounding it is difficult. Once metaphors and similes are added into text, such as in 4th grade novels, the child is completely lost.\n\nThe good news is that this skill can be improved! However, for the cognitive skill of logic and reasoning to be most efficiently and effectively remediated, there are some necessary steps.\n\nFirst of all, we need to go back to the first year of life where this particular cognitive skill should have been developed. It is not as though suddenly this child could no longer understand deductively. Instead, this connection in the brain was never created. So the first step is to create it. Through working with clients over the last 15 years, I’ve found that giving simple exercises to work through a very early stage of development, the Moro Reflex, that children start to get there. This is called “integrating” the reflex. The exercises are short and simple, take about 15 minutes a day, and need to be done every day for about a month in order to stick.\n\nTo learn more about the Moro Reflex and the exercise, go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ4K9sw7by8. You can purchase Maintaining Brains Everyday DVD or download at http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/products-for-parents/ for only $34.95 and get even more done for the brain and body.\n\nThe next step is to play games that help with logic and reasoning. My favorite beginning card game is Blink which can be purchased online or at toy stores. Another wonderful card game, which is a little more difficult, is Set. There is a challenging on-line version, but you can modify the card game for beginners. Also, look on-line or at toy stores.\n\nBeyond simple card games is more direct teaching of this. I have very successfully used the logic workbooks from mindware.com. Any and all are good – each workbook is progressively more difficult. Start with workbooks that are well below grade level and work your way up. I especially love their Logic Links workbook or box.\n\nWhen working with a child to improve these skills suing the card games or the workbooks, you must do them every day for at least 30 days, and work at a challenging level. If it is too easy, you are not creating new connections. If it is too hard, frustration builds up and the child gives up. Always stop before the tears start.\n\nFinally, there are programs that have been created that have the full directions given to you so you don’t have to figure out how to correctly create your own interventions: PACE, Equipping Minds Workbook (http://www.pyramidofpotential.com/products-for-parents/ ), and BrainWare Safari. I have used them all and recommend them highly. The best part about using these – many other skills are strengthened too: processing speed, all kinds of memory, reading skills and attention.\n\nOr you can hire a brain coach. Take a look at www.brainadvancementteam.com to see if there is a coach near you. If not, perhaps you want to be a coach. You can work with your own children while completing the program, then if you want, you can coach others. The next class begins October 1, and if you sign up before August 31, there is $50 off the registration fee.\n\nIf you get started now, you will probably see some improvement before September is over. So, have fun!"
