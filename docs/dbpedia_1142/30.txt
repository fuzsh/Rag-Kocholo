Autoimmune encephalopathies extend beyond the classically recognized clinical and radiological spectrum of "limbic encephalitis." They encompass a diversity of neurological presentations with subacute or insidious onset, including confusional states, psychosis, delirium, memory loss, hallucinations, movement disorders, sensory or motor complaints, seizures, dyssomnias, ataxias, eye movement problems, nausea, vomiting, inappropriate antidiuresis, coma, dysautonomias, or hypoventilation. A diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy should be suspected based on the clinical course, coexisting autoimmune disorder (eg, thyroiditis, diabetes), serological evidence of autoimmunity, spinal fluid evidence of intrathecal inflammation, neuroimaging or electroencephalographic abnormalities, and favorable response to trial of immunotherapy.

Detection of one or more neural autoantibodies aids the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy and may guide a search for cancer. Pertinent autoantibody specificities include:

-Neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, such as neuronal voltage-gated potassium channels (and interacting synaptic and axonal proteins, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 [LGI1] protein and contactin associated protein 2 [CASPR2]), ionotropic glutamate receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor [NMDA] and 2-amino-3-[5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl] propanoic acid [AMPA]), metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B receptors

-Enzymes, signaling molecules, and RNA-regulatory proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 [GAD65], collapsin response-mediator protein-5 neuronal [CRMP-5], antineuronal nuclear antibody-type 1 [ANNA-1], and ANNA-2)

Importantly, autoimmune encephalopathies are reversible. Misdiagnosis as a progressive (currently irreversible) neurodegenerative condition is not uncommon and has devastating consequences for the patient. Clinicians must consider the possibility of an autoimmune etiology in the differential diagnoses of encephalopathy. For example, a potentially reversible disorder justifies a trial of immunotherapy for the detection of neural autoantibodies in patients presenting with symptoms of personality change, executive dysfunction, and psychiatric manifestations.

A triad of clues helps to identify patients with an autoimmune encephalopathy:

1. Clinical presentation (subacute symptoms, onset rapidly progressive course, and fluctuating symptoms) and radiological findings consistent with inflammation

2. Detection of neural autoantibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

3. Favorable response to a trial of immunotherapy

Detection of neural autoantibodies in serum or CSF informs the physician of a likely autoimmune etiology, may heighten suspicion for a paraneoplastic basis, and guide the search for cancer. Neurological accompaniments of neural autoantibodies are generally not syndromic but diverse and multifocal. For example, LGI1 antibody was initially considered to be specific for autoimmune limbic encephalitis, but, over time, other presentations have been reported, including rapidly progressive course of cognitive decline mimicking neurodegenerative dementia. Comprehensive antibody testing is more informative than selective testing for 1 or 2 neural antibodies. Some antibodies strongly predict an underlying cancer. For example, small-cell lung carcinoma (ANNA-1, CRMP-5-IgG), ovarian teratoma (NMDA-R), and thymoma (CRMP-5 IgG).

An individual patient's profile autoantibody may be informative for a specific cancer type. For example, in a patient presenting with encephalitis who has CRMP 5 IgG, and subsequent testing reveals muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) binding antibody, the findings should raise a high suspicion for thymoma. Testing of CSF for autoantibodies is particularly helpful when serum testing is negative, though in some circumstances testing both serum and CSF simultaneously is pertinent. Testing of CSF is recommended for some antibodies (eg, NMDA-R antibody and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]-IgG) because CSF testing is more sensitive and specific. In contrast, serum testing for LGI1 antibody is more sensitive than CSF testing.

Cell-Binding Assay:

Patient specimen is applied to a composite slide containing transfected and nontransfected HEK-293 cells. After incubation and washing, fluorescein-conjugated goat-antihuman IgG is applied to detect the presence of patient IgG binding.(Package insert: IIFT: Neurology Mosaics, Instructions for the indirect immunofluorescence test. EUROIMMUN; FA_112d-1_A_UK_C13, 02/2019)

Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay:

The patient's sample is tested by a standardized indirect immunofluorescence that uses a composite frozen section of mouse cerebellum, kidney, and gut tissues. After incubation with sample and washing, fluorescein-conjugated goat-antihuman IgG is applied. Neuron-specific autoantibodies are identified by their characteristic fluorescence staining patterns. Samples that are scored positive for any neuronal nuclear or cytoplasmic autoantibody are titrated to an endpoint. Interference by coexisting non-neuron-specific autoantibodies can usually be eliminated by serologic absorption.(Honorat JA, Komorowski L, Josephs KA, et al. IgLON5 antibody: neurological accompaniments and outcomes in 20 patients. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm. 2017;4[5]:e385. doi:10.1212/NXI.0000000000000385)

Radioimmunoassay:

(125)I-labeled recombinant human antigens or labeled receptors are incubated with patient specimen. After incubation, anti-human IgG is added to form an immunoprecipitate. The amount of (125)I-labeled antigen in the immunoprecipitate is measured using a gamma-counter. The amount of gamma emission in the precipitate is proportional to the amount of antigen-specific IgG in the specimen. Results are reported as units of precipitated antigen (nmol) per liter of patient sample.(Griesmann GE, Kryzer TJ, Lennon VA: Autoantibody profiles of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Immunoblot:

All steps are performed at ambient temperature (18 to 28 degrees C) utilizing the EUROBlot One instrument. Diluted patient serum (1:12.5) is added to test strips (strips containing recombinant antigen manufactured and purified using biochemical methods) in individual channels and incubated for 30 minutes. Positive specimens will bind to the purified recombinant antigen and negative specimens will not bind. Strips are washed to remove unbound antibodies and then incubated with anti-human IgG antibodies (alkaline phosphatase-labelled) for 30 minutes. The strips are again washed to remove unbound anti-human IgG antibodies and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (NBT/BCIP) substrate is added. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme converts the soluble substrate into a colored insoluble product on the membrane to produces a black band. Strips are digitized via picture capture on the EUROBlot One instrument and evaluated with the EUROLineScan software.(O'Connor K, Waters P, Komorowski L, et al. GABAA receptor autoimmunity: A multicenter experience. Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm. 2019;6[3]:e552. doi:10.1212/NXI.0000000000000552)

Western Blot:

Neuronal antigens extracted aqueously from adult rat cerebellum, full-length recombinant human collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5), or full-length recombinant human amphiphysin protein is denatured, reduced, and separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel. IgG is detected autoradiographically by enhanced chemiluminescence.(Yu Z, Kryzer TJ, Griesmann GE, Kim K, Benarroch EE, Lennon VA.
