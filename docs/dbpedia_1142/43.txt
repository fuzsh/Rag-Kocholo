Protein Summary

Description

Plays a role in neuronal development and polarity, as well as in axon growth and guidance, neuronal growth cone collapse and cell migration. Necessary for signaling by class 3 semaphorins and subsequent remodeling of the cytoskeleton. May play a role in endocytosis. This gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse, and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders, and hyperphosphorylation of the encoded protein may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]
