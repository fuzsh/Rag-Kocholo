The program for the film festival is here! Scroll down to find the full list of screening times and descriptions of the films. More detailed info will be published on our newsletter. See you at the festival!

Please join us for our three day Anarchist Film Festival, with a special 6 hour screening on Monday, featuring a broad spectrum of anarchist film, ranging from deceptively childlike animations to in-your-face soft porn, from candid documentaries to surrealist explorations of human nature.

Alongside the movies on Fri/Sat/Sun we will have vegan food and baked goods and merch stands for groups like Abortion Network Amsterdam, the Spanish CNT and the Zapatistas National Liberation Army!

Don’t miss out!
