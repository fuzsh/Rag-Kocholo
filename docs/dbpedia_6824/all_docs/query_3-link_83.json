        "text": "Caveat: this blog is seriously high on my crone/curmudgeon scale of crankiness.\n\nI have problems with these Prop 8 protests. If you don’t already know about the Proposition 8 mess going on in California and nation-wide, here’s a wiki-summary. Yeah, if I’m not working, I plan to join the protest. But no, I won’t be protesting a ban on marriage equality. I’ll be protesting because I care about the legal ramifications and precedents set with passing Prop 8.\n\nThe brouhaha concerning marriage equality is generated by people who say they’re speaking for all LGBTQ people everywhere in this country. Omigod, yes there are TONS of supporters of marriage equality within the LGBTQ world. But not all of us agree with you. Some of us think we should abolish marriage altogether. I’m speaking as part of that minority. We’re mostly radical queers, dyed-in-the-wool feminists, old lefties, socialists and other bogey people whose only desire is purported to be tearing down both church and state, and making everyone’s life a living hell. Some of us think that triage-wise, marriage falls pretty far down the list of priorities of political focus for the LGBTQ world.\n\nI don’t care about a ban on marriage equality. Fuck it. What I care about is the violence done to queer kids. I care about LGBTQ and any freaky kids who get thrown out of their homes for following their heart’s harmless desires. Prioritizing marriage equality is dangerous to the health of those kids. So I ask myself: what’s so important about marriage to the vocal and visible (and probably even majority) of LGBTQ people?\n\nThere nearly 3,000 additional rights awarded to people who are married. These rights are awarded them for why? Inheritance, hospital access, partner health directives, health benefits, sure. But most of the rights awarded to married people are there for the sake of their children’s welfare, safety, and education. Hah!\n\nWhat grinds my coffee beans is that these nearly 3,000 rights hardly ever get taken away from married people who abuse their children, neglect their care, or throw them out, or torture or kill them or make them want to kill themselves because they’re gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer… or any kind of freaky-to-the-married-people kid.\n\nFuck marriage equality. Fuck marriage. We’d be more in line with the US Constitution to abolish marriage altogether as a function of government. We could give everyone the rights that come with marriage, via a civil union—a union that isn’t based in gender, romance, religious belief or number of partners involved in the union. And excuse me, but marriage between a man and a woman, or a man and a man, or a woman and a woman still leaves out a LOT of people!\n\nIf what people want is rights, civil unions for everyone is the answer that wouldn’t make anyone a second class citizen. And church and state would be nice and separate. The way they’re supposed to be separate, remember? If any married couple wants their civil union blessed by the religion of their choice, well fine. And I’m not speaking against religion. I’m religious. I’m a devout, practicing Taoist. (I practice and I fail, but I am a practicing Taoist.)\n\nSo, if you see me at the protest in Seattle this November 15th—and that’s a long shot, because I’m teaching a workshop for queer youth writers in the afternoon, and performing with them that evening—but if I make it to the protest against the passing of Prop 8, you’ll be able to spot me. I’ll be the cranky old tranny holding a poster that says, Overturn Prop 8 but Fuck Marriage Anyway.\n\nWith Love and Respect,\n\nCranky Old Kate"
