        "text": "Cell Count\n\nCurated by Kyle Croft and Asher Mones for Visual AIDS\n\nIn the last ten years, HIV-specific criminal statutes have been used in over 300 prosecutions in the United States, resulting in prison sentences of up to thirty years. The nature of these laws varies across the thirty-four states where they are currently in effect, but the majority criminalize the act of HIV non-disclosure, placing people living with HIV at risk of prosecution and incarceration for consensual sexual activity if they do not notify their partner of their HIV status, regardless of condom use, viral load, or the actual risk of transmission. Other statutes enhance sentences for crimes relating to sex work, heightening misdemeanors to felony status when the defendant is HIV positive. Even states without HIV-specific statutes have prosecuted people living with HIV under aggravated assault, attempted murder, and bioterrorism charges. While recent reforms in California, Colorado, and Iowa speak to a growing movement against HIV criminalization, these laws are often overlooked in conversations about the contemporary landscape of HIV and AIDS.\n\nCell Count brings together artists who unpack the metaphors and assumptions that enable the punishment and incarceration of people living with HIV, presenting nuanced analyses and conceptual refigurings as well as sardonic humor and imaginative revisions. The exhibition reframes conversations around HIV criminalization, questioning the characterization of HIV as a weapon, the conflation of serostatus with guilt, and the framing of non-disclosure as harm. Placing HIV criminalization in a broader context, the exhibition suggests that these laws echo a long history of medically sanctioned violence and incarceration in the United States. Drawing together nineteenth century experiments on enslaved women, the medicalization of homosexuality, and coercive public health practices with the emergence of HIV-specific criminal statutes, Cell Count asks us to consider how medical institutions have been complicit with systems of surveillance and incarceration.\n\nCell Count is accompanied by a 116-page catalog featuring critical essays and reports from activists working against HIV criminalization. Contributors include Che Gossett, Theodore Kerr, Risa Puleo, Timothy DuWhite, Jordan Arseneault, Robert Suttle, Barb Cardell, Thandi Harris, Craig Pulsipher, Eric Paulk, Johnnie Kornegay, David Plunkett, and Alexander McClelland.\n\nThe catalog is available for purchase at the Visual AIDS store.\n\nGallery Hours: Wednesday to Sunday, 1–7 PM, or by appointment.\n\nCell Count includes work by:\n\nJordan Arseneault\n\nBarton Lidicé Beneš (1942–2012)\n\nBrian Carmichael\n\nChad Clarke\n\nChloe Dzubilo (1960–2011)\n\nDoreen Garner\n\nGeorgia HIV Justice Coalition with JB Edify, Shyronn Jones, Myke Johnson, Torrey Marxavian Deville, and Antron-Reshaud Olukayode (1984–2017)\n\nCamilo Godoy\n\nFrank Green (1957–2013)\n\nShan Kelley\n\nM.

Lamar, Alexander McClelland, Dr. Muhjah Shakir, and Chris E. Vargas.\n\nCurator Bios\n\nKyle Croft is the Programs Assistant and Day With(out) Art Project Manager at Visual AIDS and a Curatorial Project Assistant at the Whitney Museum of American Art. He is a graduate student in Art History at Hunter College, where he researches the role of visibility and imperceptibility as political tactics during the 1980s and 1990s. He has assisted with exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum, and the MIX Queer Experimental Film Festival.\n\nAsher Mones is the Special Events Coordinator for Development at Housing Works, where he works with a community of people fighting to end the dual crises of AIDS and homelessness. He holds a BFA from the Cooper Union School of Art (2015) and has assisted with curatorial projects at P!, Project Projects, Locust Projects, and Visual AIDS, in addition to developing his own video and sculpture practice.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nJordan Arseneault is a performer and film curator in Montréal. Arseneault employs song, cello, drag, and original/found text in his performance work. He has developed two social practice workshops, Fear Drag (2010–present), and Disclosure Cookbook (with artist Mikiki, to be performed at M:ST Performative Arts in October 2018). His collaborative performances Serocene (MIX NYC, 2014, with Matthew-Robin Nye) and Propositions for the AIDS Museum(projets hybris, 2014–2017) and his participatory works address issues of criminalization, stigma, HIV/AIDS, addiction, queerness, and community. His agitprop poster Silence = Sex, made for Toronto’s 2013 PosterVirus campaign, was part of Visual AIDS’ 2017 VOICE = SURVIVAL exhibition at the Rubin Foundation’s 8th Floor gallery and is featured in the catalogue for the exhibition Art, AIDS, America in an essay by Sarah Schulman.\n\nBarton Lidicé Beneš (1942–2012) was born in Westwood, New Jersey on November 16, 1942. Beneš first came to prominence during the 1980s with his whimsical constructions of shredded currency and later with his signature “museums,” gridded arrangements of relics from Ancient Egypt to Hollywood. He transformed fragments of our throwaway culture into art that sometimes addressed taboo subjects and often used unconventional materials including cremation ashes, shells, bodily fluids, currency and shredded money, relics, celebrity artifacts and found objects. At the forefront of New York’s burgeoning gay scene in the post-Stonewall era, Beneš was also featured in numerous documentaries about art, AIDS and gay history, including Lovett Productions’ Gay Sex in the 70s. His work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at The Cleveland Museum of Art; North Dakota Museum of Art; The Katonah Museum of Art; The New York Public Library; and Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as Centre Pompidou, Paris; Boras Konstmuseum, Sweden; and Old Town Hall, Prague. His work is in the permanent collections of The Art Institute of Chicago, The Smithsonian, The U.S. Mint and North Dakota Museum of Art.\n\nBrian Carmichael is a peer educator through the Know the Risks program at the Elmira Correctional Facility in upstate New York where he advocates for prisoners living with HIV and Hepatitis C. Carmichael has been an advocate for incarcerated PLWHIV since the late 1980’s. While incarcerated at Vacaville in Correctional Facility in 1989, Carmichael fought for hospice-like conditions for PLWHIV in prison and organized medicine boycotts, writing campaigns and a hunger strike which led to the establishment of the first ever federally funded hospice in any U.S. prison. Carmichael’s painting and sculpture practice allows him to stay in contact with loved ones on the outside and work though the loss he experienced at Vacaville, where so many of his friends passed away from AIDS.\n\nChad Clarke has been living with HIV for 14 years. His personal experience of prosecution and imprisonment has transformed him into an activist against unjust criminalization of HIV non-disclosure. He sits on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Positive People Network and the Prisoners’ HIV/AIDS Support Action Network (PASAN). He is also a member of the Steering Committee of the Canadian Coalition to Reform HIV Criminalization.\n\nTimothy DuWhite is the Program Director at New York Writers Coalition, a non-profit dedicated to providing writing workshops to underserved communities, and much of his work is about being black, queer, HIV positive and having to either navigate or evade varying state apparatuses to remain alive. His writing has been featured at the United Nations/ UNICEF, Apollo Theater, Nuyorican Poet’s Cafe, La Mama Etc., and Dixon Place. He has made appearances and keynote speeches at San Diego State University, Columbia University, Oregon State University and Columbia College Chicago.\n\nChloe Dzubilo (1960-2011) was an artist, performer, activist, and an icon of downtown\n\nNew York City nightlife. She was a member of the Blacklips Performance Cult and singer- songwriter for the punk-rock band Transisters. Chloe advocated for civil rights, adequate health care and dignity for people living with HIV/AIDS, transgender people and drug users. A longtime volunteer for the LGBT Community Center’s groundbreaking Gender Identity Project, she served on its transgender HIV prevention team conducting outreach in bars, nightclubs and on strolls. Chloe was involved with the political action group The Transsexual Menace and went on to direct one of the first federally funded HIV prevention program for transgender sex workers in 1997. Her drawings and collages reflect the world that existed around her with beauty and confrontation, humor and heartbreak.\n\nDoreen Garner is a Brooklyn-based artist born in Philadelphia, PA practising as a sculptor and an inscriber of flesh.

After studying filmmaking at Kent State University, he moved to New York in 1980, appearing in East Village clubs including the Limbo Lounge, Pyramid, ABC No Rio and Club 57. Returning to Cleveland in 1988 to kick a cocaine and heroin addiction, he discovered he was HIV positive, and spent the next several years practicing his art as a ritual of self-healing. He worked in various media, including audience participatory events, monologues, multimedia spectacles, and installations. A six-time Ohio Arts Council fellowship recipient, he performed throughout the U.S. and Canada, and was a regular art critic for the Cleveland Free Times, an alternative weekly newspaper.\n\nChristopher Paul Jordan, born in Tacoma, Washington, integrates virtual and physical public space to form infrastructures for dialogue and self-determination among dislocated people.

He has worked in communities across the United States with poor, disabled, young, LGBT, currently/formerly active drug users and formerly homeless folk. He uses that background to inform both his artistic and movement work with a particular lens of Black, Queer Feminist perspectives that naturally create space for growth rooted in true freedom.\n\nAlexander McClelland is a Canadian-based writer and researcher who is currently working on a doctorate at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture at Concordia University in Montreal. He has been living with HIV for 20 years. His work focuses on the intersections of life, law, and disease. He has developed a range of collaborative and interdisciplinary writing, academic, artistic, and curatorial projects to address issues of criminalization, sexual autonomy, surveillance, drug liberation, and the construction of knowledge on HIV and AIDS. His doctoral work examines the lives of people who have been criminally charged and/or prosecuted in relation to not disclosing their HIV-positive status to sex partners in Canada. His work has been supported through a range of awards, including the Concordia Public Scholars program fellowship, Canadian Institutes of Health Research Doctoral HIV/AIDS Community-Based Research Award, and the Institute for Anarchist Studies Grant for Radical Writers.

Mikiki currently lives in Toronto.\n\nLaurie Jo Reynolds is an artist and policy advocate whose work challenges the demonization, warehousing and social exclusion of people in the criminal legal system. She has spent two decades researching the exigencies of solitary confinement and public conviction registries, retributive extremes that expanded in the punitive turn of the 1990s. She was the organizer of Tamms Year Ten, the grassroots legislative campaign to close the notorious state supermax, which Illinois Governor Pat Quinn shuttered in 2013. During that time, Reynolds also advocated for sex offense policies that truly recognize and prevent victimization and urged policymakers to address the unintended consequences of sex offender registries and restrictions. Reynolds produced listening projects, photography and calling cards. She also conducted bill analyses, designed communications trainings, and organized conferences, symposiums and performances with state officials, justice advocates, and people directly affected by crime and incarceration. Her ongoing work is focused on the impact of public conviction registries. She has received fellowships and grants from Open Society Foundations, Creative Capital, Opportunity Agenda, and United States Artists, as well as Creative Time’s Annenberg Prize for Art and Social Change. She is an inaugural Soros Artist Fellow and Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nDr. Muhjah Shakir is the founding president and CEO of Nature’s Garden for Victory and Peace, Inc., a non-profit 25 acre Community Land Trust located in Tuskegee, Alabama.
