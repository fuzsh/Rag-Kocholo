        "text": "Since the 1960s, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) culture hasdeveloped in big cities and metropolises everywhere (not only in the West, but also inAsia, Latin America and indeed Africa). This essay examines how cities provide thespatial conditions necessary for the formation of such emancipatory movements basedon identity politics and strategies which transcend binary gender dualism. The startingpoint of this investigation is my thesis that only urban life enables LGBTQ individuals tolive their lives fully, realize their (sexual) identities, and furthermore organize themselvescollectively, become publicly visible, and appropriate urban, societal and politicalspaces.\n\nhis article addresses methodological issues emerging from research conducted with Trans in the Center, an LGBT activist group in Tel Aviv, Israel. It addresses some complex issues related to the politics and ethics of applying queer and feminist methodology to qualitative research in a trans, queer and feminist community space. The focus is on two issues: the researcher’s positionality vis-à-vis the participants and selecting the appropriate methodology in relation to the characteristics of the group under study. Such issues demonstrate how queer and feminist principles are articulated and interwoven in geographical-spatial research in two different dimensions: in the research practice and methodology and in the practices and the spaces created by the activity of the researched group itself. I conclude with insights arising from the attempt to apply feminist and queer paradigms in both theory and research, and call for their integration into geographical research.\n\nThis paper offers a reflexive ethnography of a set of queer autonomous spaces created in London over the last five years. It traces the political genealogies of a recent strand of radical queer activism that is broadly aligned with the anarchist and anticapitalist wings of the global justice movement. In line with the usage of the term ‘queer’ by these activists themselves, to refer to a variety of states of being that challenge both homonormativity and heteronormativity, this paper utilises a definition of ‘queer’ that moves beyond the ways in which it has been mobilised by many sexual geographers. The ethnography poses questions about the ‘queer’ in ‘queer geography’ and what it means to be an ‘activist’. This work considers the importance (as well as the limits) of these autonomous queer spaces. It suggests that the process of collective experimentation to build autonomous queer spaces is ultimately more transformative and empowering than the resulting structures.\n\nThis essay reviews three books that center on the globalized city as a key site for unpacking disparate queer cultures. Two of the books discussed make an explicit effort to deterritorialize queer historiography outside the global North. They focus on the everyday experiences of postcolonial subjects in Cape Town and Hong Kong. In a moment of intensified counterterrorism, necropolitical nationalism, and resurgent yet covert forms of empire, both works have much to say about how the lives of sexual minorities are simultaneously affected by and resist Western imperialism. Thus they also enter into an already ongoing debate in contemporary queer studies that challenges the normalization of queer politics as a product of expanding capital both locally and abroad. All three books trace the shifting forms of the nation-state and how it affects the lived experiences of queer populations in the city. In the process, they collectively refuse the seemingly axiomatic notion that queer subjects are always being homogenized by transnational capital and neoliberal cosmopolitanism. Rather, as Andrew Tucker suggests, the hybrid queer cultures present in the city demand a more nuanced understanding of how these communities are shaped by historically, geographically, and politically specific national and cosmopolitan ideals.\n\nIn this chapter, I use my experience with studying gayborhoods as an opportunity to reflect on five methodological problems: (1) how to sample hidden populations; (2) how to interview like an ethnographer; (3) how to bring demographic statistics into conversation with cultural meanings; (4) how to move beyond binary conceptions of the city; and (5) how to identify indicators of queer spaces. These five conundrums collective capture the spirit of \"queer methods,\" a provocative new subfield emerging in sociology and beyond.\n\nIn this paper I ask what forms of affective politics become visible when we move past static ontologies of the “gayborhood” as a form of commercial and residential concentration in decline to theorize gay urban neighborhoods as public spaces of social reproduction, as spaces of queer caring labor in which the dislocations of the neoliberal city are “redeemed”. Through well-documented formal and informal collective action, queers in the urban West have organized in response to health crises, exclusion, and systemic threats of violence. Returning to Chicago school theories of the city as an organism that metabolizes newcomers, and feminist critiques thereof, this paper draws on excerpts from recent gay cinema as well as empirical work at a trans homelessness services organization to think about gay urban space as a network of interlocking sites at which queer intimacies, socialities, kinships, and politics are forged through the mundane caring practices of everyday life. I ask in what ways we can think of gay urban space as continuously made and remade through a politics of unpaid and voluntary sector labor, and argue that the gay neighborhood is a scale that queers, through the messy marrying of public and private, the feminized and racialized work of social reproduction “without which a city is not a city” (Spain 2001: 13).
