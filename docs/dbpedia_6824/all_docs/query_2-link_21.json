IS DEAD; BASH BACK FOREVER! CONCLUDING NOTES Tegan Eanelli W ITH THIS ANTHOLOGY we intend to tell an accurate and holistic story of Bash Back! In doing so, we continue our struggle to construct the queer com- mune. The profits from this book will be distributed to trans and oth- erwise queer anarchists in prison as well as those facing legal cases and criminal charges. Subsequent speaking tours will provide finan- cial support to sustain pre-existing projects and create new transqueer models of resistance. 8 Queer Ultraviolence Through collections of essays, communiques, narratives, images, and interviews, this anthology hopes to account for what Bash Back! was and what happened to it. We have included a number of actions, theories, and other essays that were not explicitly or implicitly related to Bash Back! as a name. In this context, if we do not recognize the actions of related tendencies and publications, then we fail to tell the complete history of Bash Back! as a network and as a tendency. The term queer in this book is used both loosely and inclusively. We view queer as the blurring of sexual and gender identities. Queer is the refusal of fixed identities. It is a war on all identity. In line with the Bash Back! tendency, for the uses of this anthology queer is trans because the gender binary is inherently oppressive. More often than not, our use of the term queer is interchangeable with our use of trans, though that is not necessarily true of the way in which truns-whatever is used. We acknowledge that society ensures Queer is an oppressed identity. Anti-Queer oppression is the systematic violence encountered by people who fall outside of traditional sexual or gender categories. This terminology might be confusing, but it is likely that the content within this anthology will clear the air. Admittedly, it might create more confusion among our straight counterparts. With revolution complete and the black flag burned, the category of queer must too be destroyed. We, anti-capitalist queers, dedicated to dismantling oppression, refuse to recognize any copyright of this book. While we encourage individuals to purchase this anthology as a donation to anarchist and queer prisoners and projects, we understand that many cannot afford to spare what little money they have. We give permission to any and all interested queers to reproduce, and freely distribute this publication. With this in mind and in order to fend 9 off would-be profiteers, we use the Creative Commons License. Fuck intellectual property. Bash Back! originated as a haven for queers already involved in anarchist struggles, and it intended to carve a space for those often disenfranchised from direct action-oriented straight anarchist space. Bash Back! arose in a context in which patriarchy ran rampant in anarchist circles. While comfortable, white college kids dominated the so-called radical queer scene, political correctness was an epidemic illness among the potluckgoing, craft-obsessed queer \"radicals.” It was this frustration with the straight anarchists and queer so-called radicals that gave way to the unique anti-identity politics form of separatism that became rooted in Bash Back! Bash Back! was not just a group or organization, but a militant tendency on the part of queer individuals. While Bash Back! was occasionally public and campy, bashing back was more of an everyday evolutionary occurrence than any sort of activist entity. Most of what can be attributed to the Bash Back! period never made it onto the internet or into newspapers. Bashing back meant bar fights, outrunning lynch mobs, glamdalization, attacking the homes of heterosexist murderers, outright chaos, alleged lootings, theory discussions, self-defense tips, social gatherings, beatdowns, the acquisition of large quantities of pepper spray, and attempts at sexual liberation. It was a temporary counter-culture amongst friend groups and peers that called for nothing short of direct confrontation with the (mostly) straight, (mostly) white and always normative society: the ultimate queer propaganda by queer deed. We chose to divide this anthology into two parts. Communiques and Essays. However, to view Bash Back! as either theorists or actors is a false dichotomy. There were few, if any, boundaries between those who acted and those who wrote. 10 Queer Ultraviolence Complicating the division within this book even more is that much of the theoretical content of Bash Back! came out of action. Communiques that followed militant actions were a regular mode of communicating theory. The essays part of this anthology is indicative of the many theories that both birthed Bash Back! and ones ultimately shat from its corpse. The writings speak for themselves. They represent hard-line separatists and negation-obsessed whores. Some of the essays are accurate expressions of what most of Bash Back! collectively understood. Others illuminate the divides between comrades as a way to overcome our differences and push for a new queer disorder. For better or worse, there are writings that intentionally draw lines within the tendency and post-Bash Back! sects. To grasp Bash Back! in its totality, it is imperative to comprehend all of these ideas. The communiques provide a healthy portion of what Bash Back! conveyed to the world and to each other, via actions or ideas and were distributed online. To specify, and tell the complete story, we have further broken down this part into the following nine subsections. UNCONVENTIONAL QUEERS \"Understandably, we needed a reason to get excited. We needed a chance to position ourselves as a force. We needed to feel strong. Above all else, we needed to find one another as individuals who wanted this world's head on a platter— we needed folks to dance with atop the rubble.\" act up! bash back! an analysis of the radical queer organizing surrounding the 2008 RNC And DNc 11 At the \"October Rebellion” march against the World Bank in Washington, DC, radical queers and feminists were disgusted by the behavior of straight, white participants. Many straight-passing individuals deliberately put queer and trans people in danger in an attempt to save themselves from the police. Cowards co-opted the Anarcha-Feminist identity hy creating a \"non-violent bloc” that worked with the police, which effectively thwarted the efforts of the larger black bloc (see internet appendix ardentpress.com/bashback). The culmination of these two outrageously inappropriate scenes infuriated many transfolk, queers, womyn, and people of color at the march. The Georgetown march was certainly not the first or last time “anarcho-liberal” straights moved into queer space in an attempt to water down queer militancy. Nor was it the first or last time that so- called anarchist men sought to control the bodies of oppressed people. The Republican National Convention (RNC) in St. Paul, Minnesota was set to take place eleven months after the anti-World Bank actions. Radical queers and transfolk in the Midwest frequently networked to share ideas about the planned disruption of the 2008 RNC. It was not until a radical planning consulta in Milwaukee, though that an explicitly trans and queer blockade was proposed. The idea immediately caught fire. Word spread around the United States that the newly formed Bash Back! Chicago would host a Radical Queer Convergence the following April to continue planning queer resistance to the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. Over two hundred people attended the convergence. The weekend of organizing culminated in a march of hundreds against assimilation, the first large radical queer action in Chicago in three years. The 2008 Convergence lead to the creation of Bash Back! Memphis, Bash Back! Lansing and the Queer Action Network out of Milwaukee taking on the name Bash 12 Queer Ultraviolence Back! Milwaukee. It was not long before Bash Back! Denver was born (by announcing radical Queer actions to counter the 2008 Democratic National Convention). A number of other groups and individuals from around the country began to informally associate themselves with the growing Bash Back! network. The texts compiled under the heading \"Uncon- ventional Queers\" are noteworthy because the events in them mark a shift in queer radicalism. The strategy of Bash Back! when it started to organize against the conventions was not to apply militant tactics to so-called queer issues but rather to develop new queer spaces within militant anarchist milieus. It maintained an uncompromising queer attitude while insisting that, like our militant anarchist comrades, we too are against everything. This strategy triggered everything that would represent Bash Back! and everything to come out of it. It also solidified the Midwest as a hotbed of queer-anarchist activity. FORGING A PRAXIS OF VENGEANCE \"We want to destroy everything, in diamond encrusted high heels. The violence of our desire tastes unlike any other bodily fluid; it is a poisonous venom that only the most masochistic of bodies can encounter and crawl towards for a second helping. We invite men in, waiting for the degradation that will warrant vengeance and until then we just shove their cocks in our mouths and swallow, what-ever.” whore theory 13 From its beginning, Bash Back! was closely aligned with the insurrectionary anarchist milieu in the United States. Moreover, historically and currently, some of the most influential voices within insurrectionary anarchism happen to be queer. The earliest and fiercest defenders of queer liberation were militant, mostly individualist, anarchists (see internet appendix: ardentpress.com/ bashback). It is not surprising then, given its close affiliation with insurrectionary anarchism, that the Bash Back! tendency was rooted in a politics of vengeance and that Bash Back! served to further articulate this vengeful praxis. The Bash Back! tendency manifested itself by building a culture of attack. Time and again non-violent detractors have raised questions regarding the validity of tactics rooted in anger. These dogmatic agents of control cannot grasp why the queer proletariat would be motivated to adopt a position of attack at any time and without hesitation. At various points more academic or liberal- minded individuals or groups would attempt to change and in certain ways pacify the tendency. These agents of control, although proficient in disruption, were rarely successful. The systemic and individual oppression of queer people is rooted in the violence of capitalism. Our oppressors use this violence in the most unimaginable and ruthless ways. Their actions are meant to beat us into submission. Vengeance is our reaction to that violence. It is the queer way of beating back those who commit violence against us. It may or may not spur Social Change™, but that is neither here nor there. Vengeance, as a motivation for liberatory action, allows us to overcome the fear their violence has instilled in us. Vengeance is the refusal of submission. Vengeance-motivated crimes associated with Bash Back! or the Bash Back! tendency usually meant direct conflict with 14 Queer Ultraviolence street-level oppression, and were mostly unreported, either by the Media or through communique. The communiques in \"Forging a Praxis of Vengeance\" display the violent confrontations with discriminatory businesses, transphobes in bathrooms, nazis in the streets, murderous police, and rapists. Queers fought misogynist gay bartenders. Wealthy straight and gay neighborhoods were subject to nightly vandalism. Religious people were accosted at their places of worship. An anti-trans murderer had his house attacked with rocks and fire. Democratic offices had their windows broken all over the country. Bash Back! was a culture of attack, one that surfaced every single day. DISPATCHES PROM THE WAR AGAINST GOD \"There is a class of people who, if they do not believe, must at least make a semblance of believing. This class comprising all the tormentors, all the oppressors, and all the exploiters of humanity; priests, monarchs, statesmen, soldiers, public and private financiers, officials of all sorts, policemen, gendarmes, jailers and executioners, monopolists, capitalists, tax-leeches, contractors and landlords, lawyers, economists, politicians of all shades, down to the smallest vendor of sweetmeats, all will repeat in unison those words of Voltaire: 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. For, you understand, 'the people must have a religion;' That is the safety-valve.\" bakunin, god and the state Capitalists, seeking to privatize the Commons of medieval Europe (typically utilized by women to organize anti-authoritarian attacks on 15 feudal lords), manipulated the language of religious texts to unleash a wave of violence against queers and women. Medieval criminalization and enclosure, enacted by the Church and motivated by greed, is the root of patriarchal religion and its development into what we now call capitalism. Capitalist Christianity can only exist if it maintains control of the Commons by enacting systematic violence against queers and women. In recent times a large majority of monotheistic religions have continued their war on all that is queer. Christians in the North, Central, and South Americas have enacted legislation and created a broad heterosexist culture to ensure the survival of the nuclear family. In Africa, it was the imperialist armies of Catholic or Anglican nations that created the culture which has led to the appalling violence against women and queers used to maintain a patriarchal capitalist rule. Prior to, and in many places since, the Arab Spring, authoritarian religion protects capital at the expense of women and queers in the Middle East. The same is true for much of Asia, although one cannot discount State Communism’s behavior— for example the disgusting use of reeducation camps to uphold the nuclear family to create legions of so-called liberated workers. The nuclear family ensures the type of procreation that creates workers and slaves for the capitalist and state communist machines. If an absolute queer or feminist analysis were to go unchecked, as was the case prior to the destruction of the Commons, capitalism, and much of the Church would be unable to function. Few queers can escape the effect religion has had on their lives. When bullies harass and beat young queer people it is in the name of God. When preachers at the pulpit advocate the criminalization of queer acts it is in the name of God. When missionaries tell people at high risk of contracting HIV that the use of 16 Queer Ultraviolence condoms will result in eternity in hell, it is in the name of God. When thousands of transwomen and effeminate gay men turn up in ditches in Sadr City, Iraq, it is in the name of God. When queers take their own lives it is because of those who act in the name of God. When trans and queer people in Honduras take a forefront position in their country’s fight against neo-liberal capitalism they are disappeared and murdered in the name of God. When queers are brainwashed into the belief that marriage or military service is a step toward egalitarianism it is in the name of God and Country. Rape, murder, silence, erasure, imprisonment, torture, assimilation. God, God, God, God, God, God, God. With this in mind, it is logical for any anti-capitalist queer— whose ultimate goal is to destroy capitalism— to conclude that a war on God must also be waged. Unless a theoretical and material war on the historical and contemporary notion of God is won there can never be queer liberation. A disavowal of all religion is common amongst radical queers, and Bash Back! was no different. The reason that many queers have embraced radical politics is because of our disillusionment and eventual hatred of God. Once we realized that God must go, it became clear that all of the institutions that administer His will must burn as well. First the Church, then capitalism, and finally the State. Many young queers are forced to attend evangelical megachurches, which have the sole purposes of creating divisions amongst the poor and profiting off the proletariat’s naivete. The Church must have scapegoats to uphold divisions amongst the oppressed who ensure its survival. Mount Hope Church was disrupted because of the real trauma people within Bash Back! live with, as a result of its specific anti-queer indoctrinated self-hatred. Though this particular offensive of the war began in the Midwest, it was the 17 autonomous cells located the Pacific Northwest of the United States that engaged in the most confrontational anti-God actions. We determined that communiques about disruptions and sabotage that specifically targeted churches should comprise their own section. In this section we are not interested in disproving the existence of God. We are not saying that God does not exist. In fact, God is made real through the actions of His servants. God lives and breathes through His supporters and as such He cannot be simply disproven. Rather He must be destroyed. REJUVENATING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ASSIMILATION \"...Queer means struggling against the racists, the patriarchs, the rich. Queer is questioning the role of white Queers in the displacement of poor people of color. It is stealing from the wealthy, redistributing the stolen booty, and laughing all the way. All of that said, it is undeniable that some Queers uphold the very system that keeps all of us down. Let it be known that we reject the notion that ruling class Queers are queer at all. In fact, we reject their humanity entirely. Queer is solidarity with marginalized people in the war for total liberation. To be Queer is to attack capitalism, utilizing any and all means necessary.\" -from an anonymous flier distributed at the occupy Oakland queer march. Assimilation has created housewives out of militant field-keeping women. It has turned fags into \"Presidential Advisors.” It has made white Christians out of entire races, cultures, and religions. 18 Queer Ultraviolence Assimilation, spurred by capitalism, guaranteed rich and straight- acting gay men were the ones to survive the early AIDS crisis, while poor queers were left to rot. With so many anti-capitalist fags dead. The Advocate was able to get what it finally wanted - the “we are just like straights\" narrative. Today gay men are assimilated into nothingness. The vast majority of lesbians who witnessed the early years of AIDS have become social justice dictators, turned insular, gained power, become liberalized and/or assimilated. With the assimilation of lesbians and gays, there is no more dominant queer counter-culture. There is no more love and no more queer common space. Assimilation is the master tool for the liberal ruling class. Assimilation is typically initiated by the discourse of rights. The gay cowards grovel. They kiss the clean toes of the straights and beg for their scraps of normalcy. As rights have been secured, the money pie is sliced and served to the gay elite. The capitalist establishment, though shy one slice of pie, can again run its course. Liberals then pat themselves on the back, having adopted yet another community into their war on the poor. Although she may be the radio princess of liberal leftism, Amy Goodman would gladly shake the hand of any gay bomh- dropping President. Bash Back! saw physical, anti-queer violence and the violence of assimilation as one and the same. There was no separation of struggles against the Church, fascism, and capitalism. To attack the assimilation of our supposed kin into a system that destroys queerness by disrupting a corporate Pride™ parade was seen in the same light as smashing a military recruitment window or a Nazi’s face. In Milwaukee, Chicago, Buffalo, and Modesto anti-corporate Pride™ demonstrations turned into physical altercations with hetero-supremacists. The largest assimilationist Gay and Lesbian organization, the Human Rights Campaign, was attacked in Washington D.C. and San Francisco. 19 In Minneapolis a Military Recruitment Center was vandalized on at least two occasions in the name of anti-assimilation. The Bash Back! tendency maintained that to destroy assimilation radical queers must build a queer counter-culture rooted in militant direct action. THE 2009 BASH BACK! CONVER- GENCE AND SUBSEQUENT DRA- MA \"Issues of privilege and identity are incredibly important to us and we wholeheartedly agree that they should be talked about. But as it stands now, identities like 'person of color' and 'woman' are being invoked in order to mask reactionary politics, and furthermore, are being employed in ways that contribute to the erasure of our identities as active participants in militant struggle.\" pushed by the violence of our desires A year and a half of explosive growth, action, and culture set the stage for the 2009 Bash Back— or Radical Queer— Convergence in Chicago. By the time the 2009 convergence rolled around, there were Bash Back! chapters in Chicago, Milwaukee, Lansing, Memphis, Philadelphia, Olympia, Seattle, Portland, the Twin Cities, the East Bay of California, Washington D.C., South Florida, and Southern California. These chapters do not include the autonomous individuals or groups that took action in the name of Bash Back! and of queer anarchy all over North America and the world. All that said, few people would view the 2009 Bash Back! Convergence as a success. The lackluster organizing by some BB!ers in Chicago, the willful ignorance of some attendees. 20 Queer Ultraviolence and the handful of disrupters guaranteed the 2009 convergence would end in flames— but only figuratively. Like most organized groups, there were certainly problems and divisions within the convergence organizing committee. Some of the organizers committed to taking on important tasks but rarely followed through. Others were simply overloaded with the stresses of organizing a large gathering of people. At the convergence, disruptions of workshops to address \"more pressing issues\" happened on at least one occasion. Though it was incomplete, to say that the organizing for the convergence was a failure would be inaccurate. Prior to the convergence, a multiple page communique entitled \"Creating Safer Spaces at the 2009 Bash Back! Convergence” was widely distributed. The Safer Spaces statement issued guidelines for all attendees and encouraged feedback in order to open a space to express concerns with the statement. At the convergence itself, space was made for a number of caucuses to meet, discuss issues of oppression within Bash Back!, and organize around shared identities. Huge parties and sex gatherings contributed to the counter-culture being built. The convergence space, though located in a yuppie neighborhood, was completely accessible to all bodies. The defining moment of the 2009 Convergence came as a result of conflict regarding a rather uneventful spontaneous march on Boystown, Chicago’s gay neighborhood. Despite months of propaganda describing the convergence as a space for militant and insurrectionary queers to meet, party, and organize, some who attended were put off by the inflammatory nature of the convergence. It is important to note that the majority of these splits did not happen within Bash Back! but between those who were not deeply involved in Bash Back! and those who were. To this day, forever and always, there is debate 21 regarding the 2009 Convergence. The 2009 Bash Back! Convergence and subsequent drama were probably the most influential events during Bash Backl’s short life. The convergence resulted in the implosion of Bash Back! Chicago, yet chased away who-knows-how- many left-leaning anarchists. It opened the door for a diffuse, militant queer nihilism that dovetailed with Bash Back! between 2009 and its demise. We believe that, as a result of all of this, the 2009 convergence is more historically important than the 2008 convergence, when Bash Back! made its official debut as a national phenomenon, or the 2010 convergence, when Bash Back! officially killed itself. In this section we included internet debates between high-profile, supposed radicals and actual radical queers, the Safer Spaces statement, questions from the People of Color Caucus, initial reports from the spontaneous march, information about the Fabulous 4, and general reactions to the convergence. Take what you will, form your own opinions, and burn the rest. COMMUNIQUES FROM VARIOUS G20 RIOTS '‘Fairy wands, tiaras, hammers, and masks were annexed into our limbs as dangerous prosthetics. Rocks, dumpsters, and black-sequined-dresses were profaned and put into use— thrown through windows, set on fire, and draped over our shoulders as a more fabulous take on riot-attire. Our thresholds-of-self dissolved further into a flood of shattered glass and smoldering garbage across the field of play.” my preferred gender pronoun is negation 22 Queer Ultraviolence To be queer is to defy the laws placed on our bodies by the State, the Church, and all authority. In breaking these laws we demonstrate that our bodies are our own and belong to nothing or no one else. This criminality marvelously extends itself to the queer riot. The intentions of the queer riot are to collectively destroy the property of those who use authority against the oppressed, and to become empowered in the process. It can be of the few, or it can be of the masses. In either instance, the queer riot is a beautiful painting of the reality that our bodies, especially in riot, are indeed uncontrollable. It is true that a riot is not accessible to all bodies, but within Bash Back! there were attempts to create space for all people, despite societal marginalization, to express their rage in such riotous manners. A conscious effort was made hy fellow queers to assist those who took larger risks at the queer riot. In the streets comrades were pushed along in wheel chairs; those with the ability to hear made sure queers who were hard of hearing had clear lines of communication; rioters did not judge those who were unable to participate in the physical manifestation of the riot. This is not to say that the queer riots were not flawed or that the Bash Back! riots were completely inclusive. Rather we acknowledge that the separation that the State and Leftists recommend in regards to the types of people who can \"safely” participate in militant struggle is irrelevant to the Bash Back! queer riots. The practice of the tendency is that people who are oppressed due to race, gender identity, body type, immigration status, occupation, or most other prescribed or chosen marginalized identities or conditions have the strongest desires to see this society fall and therefore are quicker to take confrontational roles to eliminate capitalism. Those who engaged with the Bash Back! tendencies were witness to, and in some cases took part in, riotous events. When 23 BART cop Johannes Mehserle gunned down Oscar Grant in cold blood, radical queers were in the streets of Oakland raising hell. In reference to the rowdy protest of the RNC in St. Paul, the Bash Back! contingent at Chicago's Matthew Shepard March chanted, \"We’ll smash your windows, just like in St. Paul.” Bash Back!— the tendency, the whatever, and the organization— formed just prior to the latest global economic crises. As the wealth of nations disappeared, the Group of 8 , comprised of the eight most wealthy nations, was overshadowed by the Group of 20, made up of the twenty most wealthy nations. Anti-capitalist radicals began to place more focus on G20 summits and the crisis of capitalism. Some of the largest actions taken by Bash Back!— with its hard anti- capitalist stance— centered around resistance to global capitalism and specifically the G20 summits. As part of the anti-capitalist demonstrations against the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, Bash Back! led a violent riot in a notoriously racist, misogynist, and anti-queer college neighborhood. The neighborhood, called Oakland by Pittsburgh residents, is home to every fraternity in the city and has the city’s highest rate of reported sexual assaults. Racial slurs have been thrown at radicals and activists in the neighborhood for years and are commonplace in Oakland. The Garage Door Saloon, owned by a white supremacist and located in this disgusting neighborhood, once came under fire by anti-fascists for hosting a weekly party with discounted tacos and Coronas. The weekly party was called \"Wetback Wednesdays.” In the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, anti-Queer attacks are relentless. Calls of \"Fag!\" and \"Dyke!” are trite. Nearly every fast food chain and many corporate clothing retail stores have storefronts in the neighborhood. Each branch of the United States Military has a recruitment office in Oakland. Carnegie Mellon University, 24 Queer Ultraviolence located in the same neighborhood, has received billions of dollars in defense contracts, and designs artificial intelligence to be used by the US military and domestic law enforcement agencies. Animal vivisections, weapons research, and general tackiness all have a special place in the heart of Oakland, Pittsburgh. There is even a \"Lesbian-Owned\" diner that lovingly welcomes Obama, the corporate lap dog, during each of his visits. In other words, Oakland, Pittsburgh is a festering ground for imperialist capitalism. The Bash Back! riot at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh obliterated attempts to liberalize the organization. Gone were the days of crying over overturned newspaper boxes. The only controversy that erupted from the Pittsburgh riot came when straight anarchists staged a revisionist coup. The straights claimed that the riot was simply \"an anti-capitalist march” or \"Bash Back! themed,\" or refused to mention it all together. A communique circulated entitled “Dear Straight Anarchists WTF?! A Radical Queer Complaint from Queens of the Trailer-Trash.\" The communique lays out the frustrations of queer anarchists with the erasure perpetrated by straight anarchists in their rewrite of the queer narrative at the G20 riots. \"Dear Straight Anarchists...” sparked a long-running debate within anarchist circles about identity, negation, and riot. Amidst all of this glory, one should remember that the Bash Back! riot manifested itself on only a few special occasions and was not without controversy. Though lacking in quantity, these events were particularly spectacular. The large assemblies of violent queers drew the necessary lines in the sand between those who talk about queer radicalism and those who are willing to act for queer anarchy. Pictures of the queer riots were spread via social networking sites, video sharing sites, and the corporate media. The images of queer anarchists committing crimes of mob passion illuminated a new world for disempowered and 25 isolated queers. This new and sexy face of queer militancy drew back the curtains of rage and proved to disenfranchised queers that many of us are willing to unapologetically act according to our violent desires. As such, it is incredibly important for us to highlight the queer riots that took place during the Bash Back! years. TOWARD A CRIMINAL QUEER CULTURE \"...as soon as you begin to act in harmonywith nature the Law garrotes and strangles you—so don’t play the blessed liberal middle-class martyr— accept the fact that you are a criminal and be prepared to act like one.” hakim bey Crime has been the core of queer since queer came into existence. The Church and State criminalize our bodies and sex. We, in turn, embrace this criminalization as a means of survival in the capitalist economy. Ed Meade and Bo Brown robbed banks to fund the George Jackson Brigade, an anti-racist and queer guerrilla cell. Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) turned tricks and mugged straights. They distributed the wealth so younger trans people would not have to resort to the same measures. The list of crimes perpetrated by queers in resistance to capitalism goes on and on. Bash Back! chose not to confuse the criminality of capitalism with the supposed criminality of survival of queer people within capitalism. At many points in time queer challenged the nuclear family and threatened the capitalist work force. Bash Back! sought to create a strong queer counter-culture, which could again challenge capitalism. Resistance was to be made sexier than Abercrombie ad 26 Queer Ultraviolence campaigns and corporate standards of beauty. If we were to foster a deep and criminal counter-culture, we could ultimately destroy assimilation. Everything Bash Back! touched was soon overtaken by sex, criminality, violence, and genderfuckery. It is difficult to separate the criminal queer culture from vengeance and assimilation. In Chicago, Bash Back! \"GlamourQueer Sextravaganza” parties attracted hundreds. After Chicago police broke up one \"Sextravaganza,\" a cop cruiser had its fuel tank punctured. In Seattle, three criminal queer dance parties to counter corporate pride resulted in smashed windows and one in a long stand off with the police. Guelph has seen more than one \"Queeriot Fest.\" Queers in Baltimore dressed in drag and wheat-pasted images of fisting onto bank windows. With these intersections in mind, we found criminality to be so crucial to our queerness, this section had to comprise a sizeable part of the anthology. Death to straighty. No, seriously. ARIEL ATTACK GOES TO COURT \"when the prison bars stop our hands from throwing the fire of anarchy into the world of power, our words become the sharp rasp of escape.” a flame of solidarity from the ccf to the brothers and sisters in chile At the end of summer of 2009, just before the Pittsburgh riots, well- known queer and trans anarchist Ariel Attack was arrested by the Denver Police Department. The Denver Police accused Ariel of smashing eleven windows at the Democratic Party Headquarters of 27 Colorado. What ensued was nothing short of a shit show. The window-smashing propelled issues of transphobia into the spotlight. Everyone, from Democrats and Republicans to self-proclaimed anarchists, was guilty of transphobic verbal assault. Ariel was smeared in the conservative and liberal press throughout the country. The Democrats insisted Ariel was a Republican operative, sent to take revenge on the Democrats after the house passed Obama’s Health Care Bill. The Republicans claimed Ariel was in fact a Democratic double operative, who smashed the windows to discredit the Tea Party movement. Many people who we would have expected to distrust the corporate media instead bought the slander- hook, line and sinker. We decided to highlight this case because Ariel Attack's defense strategy reflected the larger radical queer counter- culture Bash Back! worked so hard to create. Ariel and her entourage prepared for each court date spending hours doing make-up and perfecting costume choices. There was never an appeal to straights— anarchist or otherwise. Ariel did not straighten out by adopting a manly appearance to appease the court's ruler. Her public genderfuckery remained intact as a militant anti-capitalist trans person. Ariel challenged the Denver court system directly. Also, unlike many anarchists or radicals, Ariel did not shy away from her charges or her anarchist principles. Ariel’s devotion to vengeance and direct action was never hidden or glossed over. A silhouette resembling Ariel gripping a hammer and painted with the words, \"It’s hammer time!” were screen printed on t-shirts and sold for her legal defense fund. Images of Ariel, impeccably dressed, shards of broken glass in hand and a fuck-eye glance as if she were about to make love to the camera, were posted on countless internet sites. 28 Queer Ultraviolence The results of Ariel’s uncompromisingly queer defense strategy were profound. After proudly admitting she did indeed smash the windows of the Democratic Party Headquarters, her original felony charge was dropped to misdemeanor \"criminal mischief, and she was sentenced to eleven months of unsupervised probation, and payment of restitution. With no jail time and a slap on the wrist, Ariel Attack undeniably came out on top. Ariel’s case sets an example for how radicals, queer or otherwise, can handle their own trials. Since Ariel’s arrest other anarchists have taken more confrontational positions in the courts. Amelia Nicol, another Denver anarchist, was falsely accused of attempted murder against a police officer. Nicol stuck to her guns, refused bail and fought the charges down to simple misdemeanors. Scott Demuth was brought up on charges for an animal liberation action, and eventually took a plea deal. Scott’s decision to take a plea deal, though landing him in prison for six months, prevented the state from imprisoning others who would have refused to testify at his trial. A jury convicted David Japenga for smashing several windows during the Bash Back! riot in Pittsburgh. He served six months in the Allegheny county jail. Less than a year after his release, David was rearrested for violating his parole when he participated in an illegal march in Pittsburgh, a march in response to two queer people held at gunpoint in an anti-queer attack. David remains in Alleghany County Jail, where he will be held until trial. These and other anarchists should be commended for their valor. Anarchists who pander to our political enemies and water down our beliefs to shave a couple months off an already short sentence sicken us. We do not seek to dictate the terms for each person’s legal defense nor do we want to create a monolithic approach to court battles. We do however encourage a braver, more radical approach. After all, fire to the prisons. 29 ANNOUNCEMENTS, CALLOUTS, AND OTHER RANDOM SHIT YOU SHOULD STILL READ It should be relatively obvious what is to be found in this portion of the anthology. So, just fucking read it. INTRODUCTORY CONCLUSIONS The fight to destroy tomorrow has just begun. Our biggest enemies are the State, the Church, the basher, and capitalism. However, our most heartbreaking enemies are those who subscribe to the purist liberal and academic notions of what it is to be a radical queer, those who spread lies, made wild assumptions and fought tooth and nail to bring down Bash Back! The speculation as to why is endless. Some believe more established radicals and academics were uneasy with the attention Bash Back! received. If Bash Back! continued to hog the spotlight it would potentially take attention away from the radical queer establishment’s own self-serving projects meant to catapult them into fame through radical academia. Some think it is because many of those engaging with the new tendency did not want to fuck those entrenched in the radical queer establishment, and made this clear on several occasions. Still some believe their hatred of Bash Back! came from discomfort with the new tendency to turn queer into a negative army to destroy everything, including the academic and non- profit governance of queer. Either way, these wannabe queer rulers see no room for our revolt, and will stop at nothing to destroy the new queer tendency. 30 Queer Ultraviolence Many believe Bash Back! went too far in alienating progressive allies in the struggle for liberation. In reality Bash Back! did not go far enough. The 'better world’ liberals and radical academics speak of is impossible for queer and trans people. The progressive, liberal, and academic establishments are religious capitalists. They profit off our oppression and our resistance to oppression. Progressives and reformists closed the bathhouses, gentrified our neighborhoods and welcomed straights into our strongholds. Radical academics make tens of thousands of dollars a year yet claim to speak for the queer proletariat while simultaneously labeling the queer proletariat as oppressive. It becomes clear when viewing civilization and society through this lens that everything 'better' is actually in one way or another a hetero-social construct aimed at annihilating trans and queer criminal counter-cultures. As long as academia, the Church, the State, capitalism and civilization exist there can be no truly better world. To that end, everything must be destroyed. Bash Back! and the tendency it spawned did not have the numbers to wage a vengeful war that so many long for. It was barely a significant battle in a war yet to come. A war against progress, regress, and tomorrow. We, the neutralized generation, must lay the groundwork for radical queers who will come after us. Capitalism is collapsing and we must be ready to pull the final nail. If we create the conditions and provide the resources there will be a massive anti- capitalist, trans feminist revolt. Do not disengage with struggle. Queer cannot fall victim to genocide or plague. Our revolt is unstoppable. Trannies and queers, you are warriors, whether you like it or not. Actualize queer commune-jism. With love and arms we will be liberated, fray baroque Introduction 31 f^m un . iques Unconventional Queers Transfolks And Queers To Blockade The RNC November 13, 2007 November 9th through the nth, Milwaukee hosted the Midwest Anti-RNC Planning consulta. During the Sunday break-out strategizing session, a group met to discuss the possibilities of militant Trans and Queer action against Republican National Convention in 2008. Those involved in the discussion expressed their desire for a Trans and Queer bloc to play an integral and aggressive role in the strategy to shut down the RNC. It was proposed that such a bloc could hold one of the key intersections surrounding the convention center or could crash the parties of especially grievous religious fundamentalists. The strategy of creating 15-20 blockades in downtown St. Paul on the first day of the convention is one that allows almost infinite possibilities. Behind the barricades, we will have the opportunity to create the world we wish to see; a world without restraint. To pursue the goal of gender- fucking the RNC, it has also been proposed that a convergence should take place in Chicago the weekend of April 5th. Radical Queers, Transfolk, Anarcha-feminists, and allies from all over the 34 Queer Ultraviolence Bash Back! Points Of Unity Radical Transfolk And Queers Converge In Chicago April 5th Americas are invited to come to Chicago to ensure the end of the old world, and the beginning of ours. More information will be announced when the details of this convergence have been worked- out. We are looking forward to seeing all of you in Chicago in April, and the Twin Cities in September. For the liberation of desire and for dance parties amidst the ruins Members of Bash Back! must agree to; 1. Fight for liberation. Nothing more, nothing less. State recognition in the form of oppressive institutions such as marriage and militarism are not steps toward liberation but rather towards heteronormative assimilation. 2. A rejection of Capitalism, Imperialism, and all forms of State power. 3. Actively oppose oppression both in and out of the \"movement.\" Racism, Patriarchy, Heterosexism, Sexism, Transphobia, and all oppressive behavior is not to be tolerated. 4. Respect a diversity of tactics in the struggle for liberation. Do not solely condemn an action on the grounds that the State deems it to be illegal. In 2004 the party conventions were nothing more than disempowering for queers and transfolk. Boston turned out a large, festive, yet nearly invisible queer kiss-in. The Gays Against Bush Contingent of the UFPJ march in NYC was hurried to the cattle pens and filled its place at the very end of a 500,000+ person march. Queer Fist's Queer Communiques I Unconventional Queers 35 Kiss-in saw extreme police brutality and the arrests of nearly everyone involved. If radical Trans-Folk, Queers and Allies are to confront the oppression we face on a daily basis in the streets from Memphis to Denver to Minneapolis/St. Paul we must learn from the past, plug into the pre-existing overall strategies and be prepared to Bash Back! Bash Back! is a newly formed group of radical TransFolk, Queers, Anarcha-Feminists and allies (that started in Chicago). Bash Back! Chicago’s current focus is hosting a Convergence in April to facilitate radical Queer and Trans organizing against the Party Conventions. Bash Back! Chicago is anticipating that the Convergence will play an essential role in action planning and give us a solid grip on the presence Radical Queers and TransFolk will have at the Conventions this summer. By organizing against the conventions we all hope to pave the way for a long lasting network of radical Transfolk, Queers and Anarcha-Feminists. Bash Back! Chicago folks encourage all like minded radical TransFolk and Queers in other cities to form their own Chapter of Bash Back! and are calling for Trans-Folk, Queers, Anarcha-Feminists, and Allies to join in Chicago April 5th and 6th. As well as strategy sessions, the weekend of April 5th will include workshops, a large party/show/fundraiser, and a rowdy yet fabulous action. Bash Back! is committed to providing safe housing and food to out of town attendees throughout the weekend. With any luck the Chicago convergence will be just as smashing as the Sweaty Southern Queer and Trans Convergence in the Spring of 2006. 36 Queer Ultraviolence Anti- Authoritarian People Ot Color At Bash Back! Convergence Calling All Anti-Authoritarian/Anarchist People of Color (APOC) to caucus, network and organize at the Bash Back! Convergence. On, Saturday, April 5th at the Bash Back!

Communiques I Unconventional Queers 37 One Direction, Trans And Queer Insurrection: A Reportback From The Bash Back! Convergence The weekend of April 4th-6th, radical transfolk, queers, and anarcha-feminists, from all over the country converged in Chicago for the Bash Back! anti-DNC/RNC convergence. In attendance were folks from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, Tennessee, New York, Georgia, Missouri, Colorado, California and elsewhere. Groups including Bash Back!, Queer Action Network, the Revolting Queers, Unconventional Denver, The RNC Welcoming Committee, Anarchist People of Color, Roadblock Earth First!, the Pomegranate Health Collective, and Code Pink were represented. The convergence succeeded in creating a safe space for queer, trans, gendervariant and womyn anarchists to meet and articulate our plans to crash the conventions. Friday night, representatives of Roadblock Earth First! shared information about the current situation in Indiana, where activists are working to stop the construction of the “NAFTA Superhighway”, Interstate-69. Qn Saturday, transgendered activist Midge Potts spoke about her experiences with creative activism and as the first transperson to run for a federal office. Later, Eric Stanley discussed the relationship of queer and trans people to the prison industrial complex followed by a screening of his film Homotopia and the short By Any Means Necessary. Later that day, several people attended a DIY sex toy workshop. 38 Queer Ultraviolence On Sunday, representatives of the RNC Welcoming Committee and Unconventional Denver discussed the proposed strategies for the Republican National Convention (Sept. 1-4 in St. Paul) and the Democratic National Convention (Aug. 25-28 in Denver). At the convergence, space was created for a people of color caucus, a transgender caucus, and a womyn's caucus. The POC caucus discussed the need for a future anti-gentrification conference to discuss strategies to oppose gentrification. In their reportback, the POC caucus aiso asked that anyone distributing the zine Go Light and three anti-RNC stickers featuring a white hunter and dead elephants, indigenous people, and ninjas stop doing so immediately. During the POC caucus, a white auxiliary caucus met to discuss strategies to confront white priviiege and white supremacy. The trans caucus discussed several issues and chaiienges that needed to be addressed at the strategizing session to ensure the safety of transpeople during the conventions. Simultaneously a cisgendered caucus met to discuss what it meant to be a trans-ally. While the womyn's caucus met, a caucus for male privileged folks and a caucus for those who didn't feel comfortable in either met. During the Sunday strategizing session, two proposals were consensed upon for the Democratic National Convention. Unconventional Denver has proposed themes for the actions each day of the convention. It was thus determined that trans and queer action at the DNC should fit within those themes. After the immigrants rights march on “No Borders Day,\" it was agreed that there should be a “no gender borders\" action targeted at assimilationist and transphobic elements of the convention such as the Stonewall Democrats. It was also decided that during the “Free Political Prisoners Day\" there will be an action focused on freeing the New Jersey 4. Communiques I Unconventional Queers 39 The strategizing session then shifted towards addressing proposals for action at the RNC. Bash Back! Chicago proposed a reclaim the streets style dance party blockade to fit within the three-tiered strategy. More specifically, a dance party coupled with hard defenses. The declared intention is to create a situation wherein it is possible to have liberating and festive action, an empowering situation that we can defend and maintain. This will be an action for the first day strategy of the convention. The idea was also proposed that the Log Cabin Republicans be targeted by actions. The session also endorsed an idea proposed by the Revolting Queers of Minneapolis. They described an underwear bike ride action. This will be a more relaxing action to happen later in the convention. Coming out of the trans caucus, it was very clear that transfolk (and womyn and queers) all face increased dangers in participating in direct action. While being arrested is a miserable situation for anyone, it can be especially horrific for trans and gendervariant folks. Thus we are determined to creating safe infrastructure for supporting transfolk at the conventions and within our movement. First, getting transfolk out of jail will be the first priority of jail solidarity. Secondly, in mass arrest situations, we will refuse to be separated by gender and will give gender neutral aliases such as “Jesse Doe” as opposed to John or Jane. It should be noted that this is not only a tactic that will be practiced by those involved with the trans and queer bloc, but should be endorsed by all groups participating in direct action. Bash Back! will work to educate other groups on this tactic leading up to the conventions. Thirdly, we will work very closely with local DNC and RNC organizers to ensure that legal, medical and housing infrastructure all take into account the specific needs of transfolk. 40 Queer Ultraviolence Saturday night, over loo convergence attendees took to the streets of Chicago. The action was a response to the one trans and/or queer person murdered every eight days in this country. We are being systematically murdered, and we set out to show that we are done with the violence and invisibility forced on our bodies. Starting in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, we took the road and marched all the way through and into Boystown. Along the way, we first stopped to confront the Republican party headquarters of Chicago. There, we broke into a dancing and chanting. \"We’re here! We’re queer! Republicans, don’t fuck with us! We’re here! We’re queer! And we don’t fuck republicans!\" The procession then marched to the district police station. Despite the cops’ rhetoric about being “LGBT friendly,\" the reality is that those very cops are complicit in violence against queer and trans people. Thus, we marched to the police station and confronted the perpetrators of anti-queer and anti-trans violence. After obstructing the movement of traffic (including a Hummer limousine), for ten minutes, we marched to the LGBT center. There, we confronted the center for its trans-exclusion, its erasure of sex workers in the queer community, and its involvement with AIDS profiteers and vivisectors. After we had marched through the roads for approximately two miles, police forced the march to stop. We then broke out into a dance party near Wrigley Field. After continuing right in the face of the police for quite some time, the dance party disbanded and everyone got home without a single arrest. This action was extremely empowering. It was the largest radical trans and queer action in Chicago since 2004. Beyond that, it was a march that was uncompromisingly confrontational, yet extremely fun. We took our rage and grief to the doorsteps of those responsible— cops, republicans, assimilationists and AIDS Communiques I Unconventional Queers 41 profiteers— and we danced in their faces. After the strategizing session, three break-out groups met: communications, legai and logistics. The people involved with the communications group bottom-lined reportbacks, calls to action, regional call-outs and working on a website and listserv (bashback@lists.riseup.net). Those in the logistics group talked about the specific medical and housing needs of queer and trans folks. The legal group further discussed the jail solidarity tactics, and the need for know your rights workshops and to raise legal funds. We now have a little less than five months to the conventions, and we have a lot of work to do until that point. In May, well be meeting in the twin cities for the pReNC 5.3. In June, during the weekend of Milwaukee’s pridefest. Bash Back! Milwaukee will host a gathering to further articulate the strategy for September. Thus, we must put out a call for transfolk and queers on the west coast, in the mountains, and in the sweaty south to host convergences and consultas. We've laid out the strategy: now we all need to find out how to piug in, work out the detaiis, and shut this shit down. 42 Queer Ultraviolence Bash Back! Radical Queermos at pReNC On the weekend of April 5th around 100 radical Trans, Queers, Feminists, and allies gathered in Chicago to discuss what our presence at the political Conventions would look like. After hours of discussion, decisions and creating working groups the newly formed Bash Back! network came up with some fantastic plans. In addition to regional con- vergences it was determined that Bash Back! would make call outs for groups of radical Trans and Queer people to continue discussions at ALL major anarchist gatherings throughout the spring and summer. In accordance with this decision we are calling for Trans/Queers/Feminists/Allies to have a breakout group at the pReNC 5.3 in Minneapolis on May 5th. This will be a great time for working groups to come together, report back, and continue hammering out our action plans and logistical needs. Finally, Trans/Queer Minneapolis locals have set up housing specifically for Trans and Queer people. Should people feel they need a safer space and would like to request housing at the Trans/Queer space they should check out http://rncwc.informe.com/a-place-for-queeeers- dt5r.html or email bashbackchi@riseup.net. There are only a limited amount of spaces at this time so reserve your space ASAP. See you in May, Bash Back! Communiques I Unconventional Queers 43 Bash Back! Painting Sector 5 Pink And Blue! June 25, 2008 At the most recent Bash Back! meet up in Milwaukee, Queermos came together to hammer out details about what we want our street party blockade to look like. In recent years, large groups of protesters wearing festive, bright, and outrageous costumes have been able to hold it down longer than the loo conspicuous people wearing all black with sticks (that was not a slam on the black bloc). Radical Cheerleaders, the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army, Reclaim the Streets Parties, Marching Bands, and similar tactics have been pushing the boundaries of confused police for quite some time. Take for example the World Bank/IMF protests in Prague 2000. Three marches consisting of the blue bloc (similar to the black bloc), Ya Basta (padded bloc) and the Pink/Silver bloc (fabulous motherfuckers) were determined to surround the convention center and shut the meetings down. Not only was the Pink and Silver bloc the only march to make it to the convention center but video footage confirms that entire groups of terrified riot police ran at the sight of the march. Never underestimate the power of hundreds of pissed off pink and silver wand waving faeries. After reviewing this and other historical evidence the Bash Back! Milwaukee Consulta is calling for our Street Party Blockade to adopt the colors Pink and Blue. 44 Queer Ultraviolence Light Pinks and Blues are calming colors that can bring out a passive nature in people. When being confronted by angry cops wielding tasers and batons, this can come in handy. Pink and Blue have been assigned to “male” and \"female” sexes for quite some time now. Although it wasn’t until recently that Blue was associated with \"boys” and Pink with \"girls. Before this, Pink was actually seen as a very \"strong/masculine” color and Blue was a \"weak/feminine” color. In keeping with our \"No Gender Borders,” theme we will use society’s bizarre color standards to challenge, alter, reinvent and/or destroy their idea of gender and sexuality. This does not mean y’all should leave the pink/purple and black flags at home. Fly those fuckers high! Also remember to keep safety in mind when preparing your costumes. As much as we may want to look fabulous, or fabulously butch, we must be ready for possible chemical warfare attacks by the terrorists aka various law enforcement agencies. We suggest bringing along shatter-resistant goggles, soaked bandannas/ masks, a hat, waterproof outerwear, your typical mass demo attire. One may incorporate these measures into one’s costume OR bring along a light/handy backpack allowing one to pull them out at a moments notice. Bash Back! attendees of the Milwaukee Consulta were approached by organizers from the Midwest Region about claiming Sector 5 along with the Midwest Cluster(s). We came to the conclusion that we would join onto Sector 5 while still maintaining our decision-making independence. We are NOT a part of the Midwestern Cluster(s) but rather we will be jointly staking claim to sector 5. While many people from all corners of the country will be joining the Bash Back! blockade, at this point in time it seems the majority will be from the Midwest. As Communiques I Unconventional Queers 45 there will be a large number of Midwestern Trannies and Queers, we can effectively serve as a middle ground of trust between Midwest Blockades in our sector and Trannies/Queers from other regions in Spokescouncil situations. Keeping it Fierce, Bash Back! Free the New Jersey 4! Free all Prisoners! Queers Against Capitalism! Trannies For Tumultuousness A Radical Queer Call To Action At The Dnc Bash Back! against corporate power and mindless consumerism. Assimilationist, capitalist politics are not looking out for the interests of queer and trans folx. Reject economic oppression and celebrate real alternatives to hetero-normative capitalism. On Monday August 25th of the DNC the streets of Denver are going to get queered up. Radical queer and trans folx will crash the parties and fundraisers to demand no business as usual. The Democrats (straight and gay) will be out on the town to bask in the glory of their mainstream politics and corporate sponsorships. We too will be out on the town. Maybe we’ll feel like checking out where the Stonewall Democrats are partying... or maybe we'll visit the HRC’s corporate donors. Where ever we end up, we’re gonna smash their spectacle. Show the Dems what a real party looks like (one where you don’t need $1000 to get in the door)! Wear your pink. Bring some black. Wear your cutest capitalism-smashing shoes. Bring your cutest tumult-causing tools. Make anti-capitalist banners, noise makers, music and whatever 46 Queer Ultraviolence else you can imagine will be useful to smash the spectacle of corporate queerwashing. Against Capitalism!: interested parties will gather at 6PM at Civic Center Park. Keep on the lookout for spritely elves in orange bandanas who will be giving out top-secret information on a couple of the choicest fundraisers and parties in Denver. Most of these parties will be starting after 9 or 10, so that gives folks and affinity groups a chance to chill for a few hours, finalize their plans, dress for success, mingle with the crowd. Or folks can play some of the fun direct action games we'll have set up from 6-8 that night, to get some last- minute training before going into action. For Tumultuousness!: When they least expect it, at the appointed time Monday night, we’ll emerge from the shadows to reconvene in downtown and get down and dirty. What surprises and successes will the night hold? That depends on you and what you bring to it. Final Call To Action: Genderfuck The RNC! In just over two weeks time Bash Back!, manifesting in the form of a pink and blue bloc, will bring the Republicans to their knees (Kisses Senator Craig!!!) in the streets of St. Paul. This is a final call to action. We’re getting ready! Those of us stationed in the Twin Cities are working on hammering out the details of a convergence space for LGBTQ radicals. If all goes well, this safe(r) space will be open Friday the 29th through Friday the 5th. As of now we are still negotiating sleeping arrangements with the Communiques I Unconventional Queers 47 possible convergence space. On a separate note, our crew will also be assembling dozens of pink and blue masks to complement the wickedly sexy costumes we hope out-of-towners are preparing. The Revolting Queers are planning to reclaim Gay Space and the Twin Cities Avengers are gathering as many safer sex supplies they can get their hands on! Are you?! Flying Faeries of these awful states, the time to plug in is now! We have heard whispers of radical transfolk and queers coming in from all corners of Turtle Island, but only a small portion have let us know they need housing. If the Bash Back! Convergence gives us any idea, our blockade should be massive. However, some of us are getting nervous due to the lack of formal RSVPs we have yet to receive in regards to fucking up of this grand ole party. What's going on? Let us know who you are, when you are coming and how many of you there are. It is extremely important that we know what our capacity is when hammering out the final details of our blockade! Goings on in the Cities: • On Monday August 25th those BB!ers already in the cities will be holding a spokescouncil at a time and place to be announced. • That same evening a Trans Health Advocacy training will take place at 720 Washington Ave. South in Minneapolis • Saturday August 30th we will hold the second and possibly final BB! spokescouncil somewhere in the Twin Cities. • September ist, all hell breaks loose. • We are down to the wire.

Colorado 4 Detained, 1 Arrested At Bash Back! Demo Against HRC Tonight, August 26, at around 7pm, four members of BASHBACK! were detained with one arrested while demonstrating against a Human Rights Campaign party. According to one witness, the four Communiques I Unconventional Queers 49 were approaching the demonstration in a group and police called them over and began to question them. Approximately lo police in full riot gear surrounded the four and then searched them, took their names, and held them for about 30 minutes at the intersection of E. Colfax Ave. and Clarkson St. Police ran their names through their computer and found an outstanding warrant against one demonstrator. The person was arrested at the scene. Members of I-Witness Video and Indymedia gave the arrestee the legal number (303-830-0277) and were able to record the detention and arrest. The other three were released. According to their flyer, BASHBACK! was demonstrating against HRC because, “Instead of supporting a united queer community, the Human Rights Campaign dumped transgender people from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill banning discrimination based on sexual orientation but not gender identity.\" The flyer continues, \"HRC’s betrayal of trans people is just the tip of an oil-slicked iceberg. Since HRC receives funding from Shell, BP and Citibank, you can bet their vision won’t stray far from corporate agendas. And that includes the Iraq War. Rather than saving the lives of queers here and in Iraq, HRC fights to stockpile the military with queer fodder for Bush's Crusade.” Communique: At 4:00pm today a clandestine troupe of crusty The Queens radical Queers dropped a banner over I-94 in the Are Gumming Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis.

From as early as discussions at NCOR in March, the criticism was made that organizing around the conventions was somewhat irrelevant to queer anarchist struggle. True. Struggles for queers have largely, and rightfully so, been rooted in the desires and needs of queer bodies. From Stonewall, to the White Night Riots, to STAR, to the battles with AIDS, the struggles of radical trannies and queers have always involved matters of empowerment and immediate survival. In that context, it is understandable why many queers would not be quick to put a year of work into the RNC or DNC. After all, our bodies would still be in prison and we’d still be killed on the street without regard for the events of four days in St. Paul and Denver. We get that. But we don’t live in 1969. Queers aren’t engaged in four-day-long street-battles with police anymore. We haven’t burnt cop cars or attacked capitals lately. We aren’t occupying federal buildings, and public sex in enormous squatted buildings is sadly a matter of envious nostalgia for our generation. Rather, we have the banal regurgitation of heterosexuality and patriarchy in the form of campaigns for marriage and military service. Understandably, we needed a reason to get excited. We needed a chance to position ourselves as a force. We needed to feel strong. Above all else, we needed to find one Communiques I Unconventional Queers 51 another as individuals who wanted this world’s head on a platter— we needed folks to dance with atop the rubble. The author of this tragically incomplete analysis cannot attest to anything that happened in Denver, but really hopes someone else will. While fun, and a worthwhile experience, what happened with the Bash Back! blockade in the streets of St. Paul was neither outstanding, nor as wild as it could have been. A lot of shit was put in the roads; shit in the roads got broke, one persyn was arrested, another got fucked up by a horse. The blockade created a situation that kept buses from entering the Excel on Kellogg for about 40 minutes. Later, folks got into a few scuffles with the Westboro Baptist Church. Oh, and a terrified and bewildered corporate journalist got a great story about a \"funnel cloud\" of tire slashing, cop terrorizing, genderfuckers. From the perspective of this participant, more could have happened. The conflict could have been escalated, and the ante could have been upped. I can say, though, that standing down a charging line of horse cops, linked arm-in-arm with friends and lovers in their sexiest attire has left me with a certain taste for conflict— a taste not easily satisfied. Over a year in advance of the conventions, it was articulated that the most important reason to organize against them lay in their potential as catalysts to create lasting networks and to escalate social conflict in this country. For this reason, the conventions were an enormous success for Bash Back! and for radical queers. Bash Back! as a network, was born entirely out of anti-convention organizing. This organizing made possible the outrageously successful Radical Queer Convergence in April, and the formation of a slew of new queer anarchist groups throughout the country. There are now Bash Back! groups in at least six cities or areas (Chicago, Denver, Memphis, Michigan, Milwaukee 52 Queer Ultraviolence and Upstate New York), as well as crews of radical trannies and queers in several other towns. To be clear, the relationships and networks we’ve built are here to stay. We've fucked one another, we’ve slept on each others’ floors, we’ve sat for hours in lovely parks applying glitter to our costumes. That doesn’t go away after four days. The only place we’re going is forward. The work we’ve done to create a network of queer and trans anarchists has been amazing. Now the next few months and year will truly tell how well we’ve done. We have a lot of momentum and a lot of passion, with that, we have an opportunity to invigorate and embolden queer organizing in this country. We don’t intend to let that opportunity pass. We know what we want, and in the flurries of kicking horses and streams of pepper spray, we’ve found others who want it just as bad. We have only one direction: the queerest of insurrections. Communiques I Unconventional Queers 53 Forging a Praxis of Vengeance Bash Back! Update: Nazis To Protest Pridetest Milwaukee May 16, 2008 The National Socialist Movement (NSM), A racist neo-nazi organization, has announced its intentions to protest Milwaukee’s Pride Fest the morning of Saturday June yth. Coincidentally, Bash Back! Milwaukee had put out a call for radical transfolk and queers to come to Milwaukee the very same weekend. Thus, Bash Back! Milwaukee and Milwaukee Anti-Racist Action are calling for all radical trannies, queers and allies to go all out against the Nazis the weekend of June 6th - 8th. Following our previous call-out. Bash Back! will still be hosting an RNC strategy session the night of Friday the 6th. Plans are also still in the works for guerrilla workshops and anti-capitalist/ anti-assimilationist actions all throughout Pride weekend. Sunday the 8th a Radical Trans/Queer contingent will j oin the Pride Parade. The difference is that now our plans for the weekend will have the added fun of fucking with the American Nazi Party. We can use all the help we can get for the weekend. We would love canned food, pink and black flags, banners, rotten vegetables, sex toys. 54 Queer Ultraviolence drums, more canned food, and anything else you can bring. If you are planning to stay the weekend in Milwaukee, Bash Back! MKE will arrange places for y'all to stay and some stuff for y'all to eat. in love and rage. Bash Back! Milwaukee Milwaukee: Bash Back! Statement On Contronting Nazi Scum June 9, 2008 In the afternoon of Saturday, June yth. Bash Back! and other anti-fascists confronted the neo- Nazi group, the National Socialist Movement, who had come to protest Milwaukee’s Pridefest. The leaders of the LGBT Community asked that people simply ignore the Nazi threat to our communities. These same leaders ensured that police would be in full force to defend the NSM and to arrest and assault those who came to oppose the Nazis. In short, the organizers of Pridefest and the \"leaders” of the LGBT community sold out all of us. Neo-Nazis are not a group of passive Christians who want only to condemn our abstract souls to hell. These people want us dead. If given the chance, they will kill us. Nazis (uniformed and otherwise) have murdered thousands upon thousands of trans and queer people, and millions of others. We haven’t forgotten their intentions. We haven’t forgotten of what they are capable. We will never allow their tyranny again. We will never accept any threat to our bodies and our community. The same people who ask us to ignore these thugs demand our composure and complacency when our friends and lovers are Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 55 murdered. The “leaders” of this community have shown they will never stand with those they claim to serve. They would rather see well-protected neo-Nazis than a well-defended queer and trans community. Nobody will protect us if not ourselves. In the last year, reported violence against us had risen by 25%. One queer or trans person is murdered every eight days in this country. Nazis move freely into our neighborhoods to terrorize us on the streets. Police brutalize queer and trans people on a regular basis. Yet still, the supposed leaders and politicians of the LGBT community do nothing and ask us to do the same. When will we bash back? On February 12, 2008, Duanna Johnson was brutally beaten by a Memphis police officer after she refused to respond when the fucker called her \"he-she” and \"faggot.” That night, Johnson became yet another of the countless trans women of color to be targeted and severely beaten by police in this country. The media coverage of the incident was enormous, after Duanna’s mother went to MSNBC with the attack. To seem as though they gave a fuck in front of the media, the department fired two officers, although neither was prosecuted... This past Sunday, Duanna Johnson, a close friend and comrade was found murdered on the streets of Memphis. Already, there is speculation that one of the officers is behind the murder, as countless evidence has simply vanished... Bash BackMemphis will be holding a meeting Thursday November 20th, at a location TBA to decide how the Memphis radical queer and trans community will address this situation. Urgent: Trans Woman Of Color Murdered By Memphis Police! 56 Queer Ultraviolence Bash Back! Memphis Kicks Off Avenge Duana Campaign In the evening hours of Saturday, November 22nd, anonymous BB! Memphis operatives called in to request that a hearse, a casket, and a dozen pink daisies be delivered to Officer Bridges McRae, Duanna Johnson’s attacker, as he dressed for church on Sunday. A note attached to the flowers read: \"See you soon... -Duanna BB!” Officer Bridges McRae is responsible for beating Duanna Johnson with handuffs and fists just months prior to her “mysterious” death. It is clear that McRae and others in the notoriously anti-trans/queer Memphis Police Department had it out for Duanna. Bash Back! News, clandestine queers, and above ground activists know that the MPD murdered Duanna. Anyone who denies this fact is living in the bubble that Bash Back! is dedicated to bursting. Milwaukee Bash Back! Drops Banner in Memory Of Duanna Johnson In the frigid night of November 20th, a cadre of Bash Back! miscreants in Milwaukee dropped a banner from a bridge that read \"R.I.P. Duanna” in memory of Duanna Johnson, a transwoman murdered by police in Memphis. The 20th was National Transgender Day of Remembrance and we couldn’t let the atrocity of Duanna’s murder go unrecognized. Let it be known to all racist, transphobic thugs: \"your days are numbered”. Act up! Bash Back! Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 57 Philly: Bash Back! Disrupts Traffic In Response To Trans Kiiiings In response to the recent murder of of Duanna Johnson, Philly’s incompetence in trying Erika Keels’ murderer, and to show our love to all the Trans Folks who lost their lives to hate. Bash Back Philly took to the streets in our first action to mark the beginning of our existence. As people left the hollow towers that cover our world in shadows to go home to another day of gray, we here at Bash Back Philly had a different plan for them. Slowly, block by block, we reclaimed the streets, blocking traffic to leave the pink body outline of our murdered family member and the words \"Stop Trans Murder”, passing out flyers to raise awareness to the most recent of our people's murders and the lack of respect our city shows for us. As the snow and rain beat down on our backs we continued our Reclaim The Streets avoiding potential arrests and angry cars trying to run us down. The people out in the streets were with us though, which was inspiration enough to continue our action. Passersby, wage slaves, and of course upper class gays were all learning that our queerstory is not all about San Francisco. That we are everywhere and we will not lose our lives and family without a fight. This Message brought to you by Bash Back Philly (the city that cracked the Liberty Bell) 58 Queer Ultraviolence Memphis: Two Days, Two Actions For Duanna April 26, 2009 Milwaukee: Solidarity With All Cop Killers March 28, 2009 On Saturday, a memorial was cemented into a wall along Cooper Street in honor of fallen trans warrior Duanna Johnson by an autonomous cell of BB! Memphis. Located just two blocks from the Gay and Lesbian “Community Center\" and around a number of gay bars and yuppie hang outs, the site was chosen over the site of her murder. This was in protest of the gentrification of Cooper-Young— once the major hub of all queer sex workers and their clients— by rich white gays, and their subsequent economic and forced removal of trans people, people of color, and sex workers. Further, we contend that these gay gentrifiers and their co-conspirators, the police, are responsible for destroying the centralized trans sex worker community of Cooper/Madison— making them at least partly responsible for her murder. On Sunday, at 9:10AM, another action was undertaken by another autonomous Bash Back! operative, a self-proclaimed \"Satanic tranny”, while Bridges McRae and his wife attended Sunday church services at Calvary Chapel in Brandon, MS. The operative pulled out a knife and accidentally sliced all four tires of McRae’s SUV as well as one tire of a Sheriff cruiser parked in the church parking lot, escaping into the countryside. On March 21st, Lovelle Mixon shot five police officers, killing four before dying in the gunfire. In Oakland we see the fabric of capitalist normalcy being ripped to shreds. Daily instances of racist police violence are transformed into rupture and thrown back in the faces of our oppressors. In Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 59 January, days of rioting followed the police murder of Oscar Grant. This week, people danced in the streets as cops were shot. At the hospital, others snuck into the emergency room to chant that the shooting was vengeance made actual upon the police. People rallied to honor the memory of Oakland’s newest folk hero. Oakland, reterritorialized as a terrain of war against the social order. In 1959, we fought the street battles with the police as they harassed queers at a donut shop in Los Angeles. In 1966, police brutality against street queens in the Tenderloin mutated into queens beating cops with their purses. In 1969, a seemingly-ordinary police raid on a queer bar in New York erupted into four days of sustained rioting. In 1979 we burnt cop cars in the streets of San Francisco. We meet queerbashers with bricks, mace and batons. To bash back is to reverse the flows of power and violence; to explode the hyper-normal into situations of previously- unthinkable revolt. We thus find the deepest affinity with all who fight back against the affective poverty and oppression of this world. As the police and media work to defame and slander Lovelle Mixon, we express our total solidarity. Until every queerbasher is beaten to a pulp and police are but a memory. Yours for the social war. An Unknowable Cell of Bash Back! On March 26th, Bash Back! operatives dropped a banner from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Union. The banner read only: “We (heart) Lovelle Mixon\". R.I.P. Lovelle Mixon 60 Queer Ultraviolence Chicago: Unicorn Cum On Nazis, Or How We Embraced Our Love For 90S Pop Culture Fist Fight Your Oppressors! June 29, 2009 Early afternoon, punktime, in Chicago, Illinois, a carful of trans, genderqueer, queer, POC, cismale submissives and female-bodied insurrectionists started driving down the road towards the highway. We didn’t care that we were driving because the environment is already destroyed and 2012 was an inside job, so we co-opted the technological beasts of our masters to use for our own means, speeding towards the northern suburbs. We hoped to smash straight into anarchists protesting nazis protesting socialists, in the absurdity that has become our reality— policed by... police. Leaning out the car window with our teenage angst anthems playing full blast, we looked straight into the eyes of the guilty pleasure of our childhood, none other than Blink 182's Travis Barker. U-turn! Parking lot! Out we jump! Followed him by foot into the doughnut hole of capitalism, \"Hey!,” we yelled, “Come beat up nazis with us!\" After canceling a few appointments, he agrees to jump into the speeding steel vehicle. Off we go again, with our black flag flowing majestically out the window, it’s folds fluttering in the cloudless sunny sky like a butterfly. Into the barren wasteland that is suburbia— Not only suburbia, but one which is constantly bombarded by metal cages which explode with the fumes of the rich. More parking lots, a Target, hotels, dotted here and there with moving smudges of human. Cop cars! Lots of black clothing! No, these are not the BDUs and helmets so common to police, the military, and neo-nazis. These are the masks and hoods of our Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 61 friends! Countless bodies mingling, waiting, scheming. Some engage in dialogue with the cops, most do not. The scene is one like that of the most melodramatic Battle In Seattle spin-off films— hostility, tension building up. We arrived at just the right time! A sign above the heads of our enemies flashes: \"JONAS BROTHERS! DEMI LOVATO!” But our American Apparel looks better than those of the pre-teen Disney channel stars outing the National Socialist Movement’s pedo- affiliation. Did you read Bill White’s resignation letter? The polished heads of our enemies hide behind the thinning hair of other enemies, nazis behind cops... Kind of a tragic equation: 20 and 5. We surged forward like a tidal wave of destruction, and the thin blue line broke like a popped balloon. Cops scattered! Some took sides. After the previous dialogue with those who had arrived prior to punktime, an officer throws his badge to the ground and dons his shirt like a mask! He screams “ANARCHY! CHAOS!’’, and lives all the burning desires he has waited so long to imagine. We charge, but not to the cops, or the nazis, towards the cars!!! Into the trunks we reach! Out we return, with bullet-proof vests, with helmets and snazzy face shields, with tasers, with teargas, with cool little walkie-talkies. This is dispensed to the crowd; those without protection seek it, those who came with it, break it out. We are beyond verbal confrontation. Not a word is uttered as brass knuckles, knives, rotten fruit, stale muffins, and flag poles fly through the air! Panes of glass are broken over heads! The silence ends: \"FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS! FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR FIST FIGHT YOUR OPPRESSORS!” These words scratch our throats abrasively, like 62 Queer Ultraviolence the granules of concrete which roadrash the faces of those we’re confronting. The ISO, a monolithic political organism that acts as a parasite, born in the bowels of some Marxist theological hell-laboratory, feeds on babytape and dreadlocks. It begins with a rash, and quickly transforms into a thick red sludge that enters through the ear canal to cloud autonomous thought. It turns its hivemind to the melee. Out of the hotel erupts a group of zombified college students. Upon closer inspection we realize they have ISO! Communist philosophy oozes from their eyeballs. They run, with arms outstretched, schedules in hands, cameras and microphones dragging behind them. Thank yous are drowned out by the sounds of the original crowd. They are pulled in. We make no distinction between national socialist or international socialist. All feel the power of our collective fight. The cops have deserted us. Here and there, bodies drop to the ground... Their bald heads, red armbands and shiny boots adorn the pavement. One small masked, hooded figure removes the boots from a fallen douchebag, ties the laces together, and hits the last Xbox fanatical Youtube-using racist in the face, knocking him to the ground! They drape the boots over their shoulders and yell “I was the r6 year old blonde-haired Aryan chick you friended on New Saxon!” On second glance, the small figure appears to be a rather androgynous queer POC destroyer of worlds. We look around as the dust settles. None of us has fallen. There are a few scrapes. Travis Barker has a broken leg. We attend to the wounds of our companions and walk away... As we look over our shoulders and the sun sets, we see one of those ridiculous metal cages explode fumes into the hotel full of Trotsky cookies and matching tracksuits. Onward ho! Your town next! Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 63 Providence, Rl: What Queer?! Solidarity March With Athens, Gaza, And Oscar Grant Today 30 or so people gathered, in response to a call put out by What Queer?!, Providence’s radical queer organizing collective, and marched, funeral- procession style, between locations of state violence. We delivered speeches and memorials, paying tribute to those effected by state violence. We reminded Bank of America, TEXTRON, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Providence Police Department, and the Army National Guard Recruiting Center of their roles as perpetrators of this violence. Today we mourned Alexandros Grigoropoulos. Today we mourned Oscar Grant III. Today we mourned the 800 dead in Gaza. Today we mourned all of our fellow Rhode Islanders who are incarcerated and awaiting deportation for the crime of working the state's least appealing jobs. Today we mourned the American teenagers who are coerced into joining the military, whether it be out of economic necessity or sparkly false advertising. Today we mourned every person who has ever been raped, murdered, and beaten by the police. Today we mourned the environmental devastation perpetuated by Bank of America. However, we won't just mourn— we will continue to struggle towards a better world, fighting the fight all these people were taken away from all too soon. Our collective grief was witnessed by many passersby, who were given funeral-style fliers explaining our presence. A coffin was carried, and a brass band played. “Shrines” were left at the buildings of each purveyor of state violence, piles of flowers and framed statements calling out their atrocious acts. This procession was called for by 64 Queer Ultraviolence What Queer?!, and was coordinated with the help of Providence Students for a Democratic Society, Brown SDS, Northeast Anarchist Network, individuals from the Industrial Workers of the World, Direct Action for Rights and Equality, Olneyville Neighborhood Association, the What Cheer! Brigade, International Socialist Organization, and other autonomous individuals. We hope this will be the first of more frequent coordinated actions between many groups in Providence. As queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming people, we recognize that the violence that is ever-present in our lives is also perpetuated around the world. There are no single issues. Collective liberation = collaborative triumph over our common oppressors. Bash Back! News Responds To Death Threats To those who have threatened to kill us in the past week: You have put us in camps. You have imprisoned us otherwise. You bombed our bars and clinics. You helped pass anti-Gay legislation. You have killed us in the streets and beat us in your schools.

Statement Ot Support To Those Who Evicted The RCP Yesterday, March 14th, the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) was forcibly evicted from the San Francisco Anarchist Book Fair. Surprisingly some “Anarchists” have criticized the move and have even defended the Maoists' right to free speech. These Anarcho-Liberals have gone so far as to suggest that throwing water on the RCP’s literature is violence. Soon after the incident, the RCP started a petition denouncing their eviction. Dozens of so- called \"Anarchists\" signed the petition. These Bash Backlers think the petition is a fantastic idea, and we want to thank those who signed the petition of a historically heterosexist organization. Now we know whose side you all are really on. Until 2003 the Revolutionary Communist Party held the position that Homosexuality was a product of Capitalism. Lesbians, they claimed, were a reaction to the sexist society that Capitalism created. Gay men were a reflection of patriarchy and the dominant bourgeois culture. After the Revolution queers would be eradicated. The RCP and other state communists are not allies of Queer people or Anarchists. While we do admit there are bigger and better battles to fight, any space that is safe for the RCP is not safe for Queer people. Respect should not be shown to bigots masquerading as revolutionaries. They are our enemies, and should be treated as such. Freedom of speech is a liberal construct. Qppressors already have their stage. The Communiques I Forging a Praxis of Vengeance 67 oppressed must steal it from them. We want to thank those who evicted the RCP and destroyed their literature. We also want to give a big Fuck You to everyone who signed that stupid fucking petition. Some Pissed Off Members of Multiple Bash Back! Chapters Bash Backiers In Support Of Autonomous Animal Action Call For Trans-Species Solidarity With Tllllkum March 4, 2010 An autonomous cell of Bash Back! is calling for solidarity with sea criminal Tillikum, the orca responsible for killing a trainer at Sea World Orlando at the end of February. We consider the attack on Dawn Brancheau to be an act of social war, as Tllllkum gave new breadth to the waves he monotonously created through his awe-inspiring splashes. Tillikum destroyed what destroyed him by transforming his commodified body into an organ of the war machine; thus, enacting an orcan-strike. For too long he had been confined as a spectacle for the American populace to consume. The affect of his bodily revolt has aided in helping us all realize the potentiality of realizing our underlying desires. Members of the American Family Association have come out in favor of stoning Tillikum to death for this strike against systems of domination. In response, the nonhuman political prisoners at Sea World Orlando have organized the first chapter of Splash Back!, an insurrectionary tendency of sea animals dedicated to destroying all forms of oppression. Bash Back! must be allies in the struggle for animal liberation, as well as against the religious right which has sought to criminalize the bodies of queers and orcas for so long. We are calling for 68 Queer Ultraviolence solidarity actions with Tillikum across the country to support animal autonomy and resistance. Orcas have been criminalized for too long; the time for sea animal liberation is now. Solidarity with all Trainer Killers! Gang Of Queers Beat Down Nazi At Albany Pride March June 16, 2009 We found 41 year old \"Spanish Blue Blood,\" a self proclaimed \"stormtrooper” of the National Socialist Movement and senior moderator of the NSM’s official party forum, sitting on a bus bench waiting for a crew that never showed. The second he saw us he split for the street but didn’t get far til we caught up with him and gave him what he deserved. “Spanish Blue Blood,” who lives in the Colonie area of Albany, had been trying for weeks to draw up enough people to stage a counter protest of Albany’s Capital Pride march but apparently he couldn’t even get a single person out. He recently celebrated his 41st birthday on June 9th so we delivered some belated gifts— in the form of tightly balled fists. The gang beat him until the cops showed and we made our way back into the park with no arrests.
