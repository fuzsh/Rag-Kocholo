        "text": "The following version of Trans Activism UK’s Open Letter to the BBC, complete with signatories present at 8pm UK on Friday October 29th, is the version which will be sent in digital and physical formats to multiple members of staff at the BBC.\n\nAt the time of finalising, the letter has over 20,000 signatories, over 12,000 of whom have been email verified and added to this letter.\n\nIn addition, you can follow @TransActivismUK on Twitter for updates on our planned January 8th 2022 protest outside Broadcasting House London.\n\nDear Tim Davie,\n\nOn Tuesday 26th October 2021 the BBC published an article by Caroline Lowbridge titled ‘We’re being pressured into sex by some trans women’*¹.\n\nOn that same day we, the members of the grassroots organisation Trans Activism UK, penned an open letter reacting to the frankly harmful nature of the article, concerned about the fact that the BBC has openly violated its own impartial journalism guidelines as well as its mission statement and values;\n\nWithin the hour we had over 1,500 signatures, by the next morning, there were over 8,000. At the time of writing this on Friday 29th October, the open letter has been signed by nearly 20,000 people, nearly 12,000 of which have been verified via e-mail (this number would be higher however our letter’s popularity resulted in the website encountering server issues and crashing). It remains live and the number continues to grow.\n\nThis includes a huge amount of cisgender lesbians who are extremely concerned by this dangerous article and the negative, transphobic light in which it paints them.\n\nThe signatories are global and diverse, including staff and representatives from the LGBT Foundation, The Nelson Trust, Sparkle, Girlguiding, The Knights and Orchids Society, Gay & Lesbian Switchboard Ltd, Proud Swans, Trans Pride Brighton, Pride In Surrey, Leeds Pride, Hastings Pride, DIY Pride Brighton, Swindon & Wiltshire Pride, Pride in London, Portsmouth Pride Trust, Pride in Gloucestershire, Bradford Pride, Bristol Pride, Bi Pride UK, Manchester Pride Protest, Southend Pride and Medway Pride Radio, Meath Live and Anti Conversion Therapy Coalition, Indigo Gender Service, UK Parliament, regional Police Independent Advisory Groups, the NHS, members of the Order of the British Empire, registered gender specialists, Gay Times, Seventeen Magazine, Condé Nast, Parenting Magazine, NBC, ITV, The F-Word, journalists both freelance and members of a variety of outlets, Aardman Animation, lecturers from a variety of Universities, the NEU, members of the clergy, Rolls-Royce, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, members of multiple different political parties, and a wide selection of both past and present BBC employees.\n\nWe wish to present this letter to you now to request that you seriously consider its contents and recognise both the harm that you have done as well as acknowledge and act upon the violations of your publishing guidelines.\n\nIt is vital that, as a public service, you hold yourself accountable for the damage that you have done.\n\nWe shall await your recognition, apology, rectification and commitment to improving your corporation’s practices.\n\nThe day this open letter was written (26th October 2021), you published an article on the BBC News website by Caroline Lowbridge titled ‘We’re being pressured into sex by some trans women’¹.\n\nThe article headline may use the word “some”, but the clear implication of the article and its headline is that transgender women as an overall minority group pose a threat to cisgender lesbians, and should therefore have their rights restricted in the UK.\n\nThe implications proposed in this article suggest that transgender women generally pose as a risk to cisgender lesbians in great enough numbers that it is newsworthy, and something that the general public should consider to be a common occurrence rather than a matter of incredibly rare, isolated experiences.\n\nThe article uses a deeply flawed study that doesn’t meet BBC guidelines*², and anecdotal accounts from known transphobic hate groups who actively campaign for transgender people to lose their legal recognition as their gender.\n\nThe article is based on a single self-selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out*³, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views. The group that was surveyed already believe that transgender women are men, and should be prohibited from legal recognition as women/access to female-gendered spaces out of fear that such access will cause cis women to be sexually assaulted (despite there being no evidence to support this concern).\n\nThis study breaks the BBC’s own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidance/surveys\n\nAdditionally, the article itself acknowledges that outside of this self-selected study, with small sample size, there is basically no evidence for the claim that this is happening in any sort of numbers that would justify generalising this as a widespread experience.\n\nThe article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry-picked individual cases. It cites a more than 50% figure from Get the L Out’s survey result, with the implication being that most cisgender lesbians will have experienced coercion into sex by a transgender woman, despite the following quote:\n\n“Ultimately, it has been difficult to determine the true scale of the problem because there has been little research on this topic – only one survey to my knowledge”.\n\nThis quote comes directly from the perspective of the survey organiser:\n\n“While acknowledging the sample may not be representative of the wider lesbian community, she believes it was important to capture their “points of view and stories”.\n\nThe article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK and the fact that gender reassignment is protected by the Equality Act 2010.\n\nThe fact that the people cited in this article largely do not acknowledge that transgender women are women, by referring to them as men, should make it clear that they are not representative of the wider community of cisgender lesbians, or the wider UK public.\n\nMost of the people that the articles cites do not talk about not wanting to sleep with transgender women with penises, but rather they talk about not wanting to sleep with people that they consider to be men, or see as having male genitals. This should make it very clear the biased view that those interviewed have on the legal status of the gender of transgender women.\n\n“I can hear their male vocal chords. I can see their male jawline. I know, under their clothes, there is male genitalia. These are physical realities that, as a woman who likes women, you can’t just ignore.”\n\nYou do not have to be attracted to a woman, cisgender or transgender, who has a deep voice, or a square jaw, but to call those male physical attributes, or to suggest that anyone attracted to women can never be attracted to those attributes, not only implies that cisgender women with these attributes are not women but also implies that any transgender people with those attributes are no longer women.\n\nIt also overlooks and invalidates the population of cisgender lesbians who are attracted to and in relationships with transgender women.\n\nIf someone is a transgender woman, you are not obligated to be attracted to her, to want to have sex with her, or to be with her in any way. You do not have to find attributes such as “a deep voice” or “a square jaw” attractive. If a transgender woman has a penis, you do not need to have sex with her, or interact with her genitals in any way, regardless of whether or not you are attracted to women.\n\nHowever, to repeatedly insist that these attributes mean that the transgender woman is in fact male is an act of transphobia, because in the UK she is recognised as a woman/female.\n\nA transgender woman with a deep voice, a square jaw, and a penis that you do not want to have sex with is not a man. She is a woman that you don’t find attractive.\n\nThe previously cited woman also notes she would feel the same if the transgender woman in question had lower surgery (reconstructive transgender genital surgery). So, she would still feel that a transgender woman is a man, even if the said woman had a vagina rather than a penis.\n\nAgain, this makes it clear that the person interviewed inherently feels that transgender women are not and can never be women. That is not someone who should be used as an unbiased source on the topic of transgender women’s existence. You do not have to be attracted to transgender people, finding us unattractive is fine, but to believe that we fundamentally are not and cannot ever be our legally recognised gender is both transphobic and factually incorrect*⁴.\n\nThe article also references the phrase “Gold Star Lesbian”, a term used to shame and invalidate any lesbians who have ever interacted with men sexually. The term implies a hierarchy of lesbianism, where someone who for example has slept with a man while in the process of discovering their identity and later recognises that they are a lesbian is considered to be less of a lesbian than someone who never slept with a man. It’s an exclusionary badge of honour used to gatekeep people out of the lesbian identity simply because they took some time to get there.\n\nIn the context of this piece, the cited porn actress claims that they do not want to sleep with a transgender woman, because they “have only ever slept with women”. In the context of the gold star nickname, this implies that they, again, inherently do not see transgender women as women. The issue is not posed as them not wanting to sleep with someone with a penis, but that they see the transgender woman as a man, and that they would be less of a lesbian for sleeping with them. This again reinforces the idea that “true lesbians” don’t sleep with transgender women, a fact which is not accurate.\n\nNowhere in this piece does the journalist Caroline Lowbridge speak to any cisgender lesbians who are attracted to transgender women, giving readers the impression that all lesbians are of the opinion that transgender women are not women and that no cisgender lesbians are in successful relationships with transgender women.\n\nThe article also cites LGB Alliance. This group has registered charity status in the UK but appears to be breaking the charity commission’s rules for behaviour and conduct of a UK charity⁵. A UK charity can campaign for the rights of a single group, but cannot exist solely or predominantly to campaign against the rights of a minority group⁶.\n\nThe LGB Alliance has a proven track record of focusing primarily on gender identity and transgender issues, for example, their recent LGB Alliance Conference on 21st October 2021 advertised a timetable of four panels, three of which focused on transgender topics and/or were being hosted by known anti-trans activists (the final fourth panel appeared to just be a closer).\n\nThe group has not shown any evidence of campaigning for LGB (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual) issues such as halting LGB conversion therapy, addressing LGB hate crimes or tackling the high level of homelessness in the LGB community.\n\nRather, they have been known to be both actively biphobic⁷, homophobic⁸ and discriminatory towards the LGBTQ+ community as a whole*⁹.\n\nAt the aforementioned conference, an attendee claimed that transgender people are not real, that transgender people should not have legal recognition, and that transgender people should be eradicated from existence. That was met by cheers by conference attendees, and not criticised or countered by those on stage, or representatives of the charity itself.\n\nAdditionally, Jen Ives, a transgender woman, was the victim of a hate crime at the LGB Alliance conference:\n\nhttps://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/25/lgb-alliance-conference-trans-jen-ives\n\nLGB Alliance is an anti-trans hate group that you, the BBC, have represented as simply an LGB rights group, and uncritically platformed. When LGB Alliance told the journalist, Caroline Lowbridge, “We know a minority, but still a sizeable minority of trans women, do pressure lesbians to go out with them and have sex with them and it’s a very disturbing phenomenon”, they again had no actual evidence.\n\n“We don’t have figures but we are frequently contacted by lesbians who relate their experience in LGBT groups and on dating sites.”\n\nAgain, the one study that is cited is self-selected, of a small sample size, and from a group with a clear bias. The other groups claiming this is an issue have not provided evidence. This does not meet your own BBC guidelines for evidence*².\n\nSome of the people cited in this article who claim that they were called anti-trans for refusing to sleep with a transgender woman are actually very vocal online about wanting to see rights reversed and removed for the transgender community, showing a clear history of bias. In many cases, those interviewed in this article have deliberately misrepresented why people view them as anti-trans.\n\n“Debbie Hayton has been accused of propagating hate speech against the trans community, despite being trans herself.”\n\nThe article does not elaborate further on this statement, but Debbie Hayton is one of the few transgender people you allow to speak for the piece. Debbie is a transgender person who is very well known for being willing to stand by the views of the anti-trans community, saying what they and those platforming them want to hear*¹⁰. Selecting a known anti-trans figure for this piece as one of your only transgender voices is very telling, as they’re in a very small minority of transgender voices who would use their position in this article to not dispute the piece’s biased claims.\n\nDebbie Hayton’s claim, for example, that most transgender women are attracted to women because they are actually just straight biological males is, again, based on zero evidence.\n\nThe inclusion of it here is clearly an attempt to have a transgender person parrot the article’s implication that transgender women are not just straight men, but rapists, a claim that this piece makes repeatedly and does not push back against.\n\nBy claiming that transgender women try to date women because they are actually straight men perpetuates the idea that transgender women are misleading sexual predators. The fact that Debbie Hayton is willing to make unfounded claims, and insist that transgender women are truly men and not actually women, is an element of why they have been labelled transphobic amongst the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nGet The L Out, the group behind the featured survey and a group that is cited in the piece as having “demonstrated” at London Pride 2018, actually jumped the barriers at the event*¹, refusing to let the march go ahead until they were allowed to lead at the front of the march, handing out fliers claiming that transgender women should be banned from women’s spaces and be stripped of legal recognition because they are all potential rapists.\n\nThey also screamed transphobic obscenities at anyone holding a transgender flag watching the march, deliberately misgendered those with transgender pride flags, and threatened police involvement on any transgender people who were provoked by their bigoted actions.\n\nThis is an example of the kinds of groups that you, the BBC, are citing in this article. You are citing groups with an incredibly strong anti-trans bias, and not making that clear to readers. The survey results come from a group that believes that transgender people should not feel safe at Pride, and should have to face misgendering, slurs, and claims that they are rapists. This is not an unbiased source.\n\nWe do not dispute the claim that there are likely isolated cases of cisgender lesbians who have been pressured in the past into sex by transgender women who viewed their genital preference as transphobic, nor do we dispute the individual claims of those interviewed in this article. However, to paint this as a widespread occurrence, or the norm, is incredibly dangerous. It is obviously a tragedy any time any person is coerced into sex and their consent violated, but the answer to that is not to paint an entire minority group as potential rapists.\n\nThis article feels reminiscent of media coverage of gay people using public bathrooms in decades past, suggesting that the experiences or fears of a small group of individuals should justify the media’s implication that gay men are a sexual assault risk in public toilets (a claim that was, in fact, shown to be based on lies*¹¹) That kind of coverage was bigoted in decades past, and it remains so today.\n\nThe article also feels reminiscent of the style of generalised fear-mongering used by far-right news organisations against minority groups more broadly, beyond the LGBTQ+ community. This reminded one of our signatories of Asian ethnicity in particular of right-wing attempts to paint all non-white groups as dangerous based on fringe cases and anecdotal accounts.\n\nAny person who wants to refuse, or withdraw consent to a relationship, romance, or sexual encounter is always entitled to do so and this is not up for debate. No matter the context, demanding that someone sleep with you without consent is a crime of the vilest order. Nobody should ever attempt or even consider forcing another person to have sex with them.\n\nTo find out that a transgender woman has a penis, and decide that you do not want to sleep with her, is your right. This is overwhelmingly the opinion of the transgender and LGBQ+ community as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, this article completely overlooks the massive rates of violence faced by transgender people*¹², and the huge risk they encounter when revealing their transgender status to partners. Most transgender women are genuinely terrified of the possibility of violence should they reveal their transgender status and accidentally anger their partner at that moment. Transgender women are not in the habit of revealing that they have a penis as a surprise, alone with a partner, at the last moment before intimacy, because that is something that is incredibly dangerous, and puts them at great risk of violence.\n\nIn a wider context, there is a broad history of LGBTQ+ people of various backgrounds being accused of being sexual predators that this article plays into. Gay and lesbian people were accused of being bathroom predators by the media in the ’80s, bisexual people were accused of being sexual predators in the ’90s and 2000s, and transgender people are right now being targetted very strongly in that same manner.\n\nMost groups campaigning to restrict transgender rights in the UK recycle homophobic talking points near-verbatim without evidence. Bathroom bills were introduced in the US because of fears that transgender people in bathrooms could lead to sex offences, despite there being no evidence that decades of transgender people in public bathrooms had caused any such crimes.\n\nThose in the UK who campaign against Self-ID for transgender people use the argument that it will lead to an increase in sexual assaults, despite nothing of the sort happening in any other country where Self-ID has been implemented.\n\nRare examples of sexual assaults by transgender people are held up as “evidence” against every transgender person, to promote a clearly anti-trans agenda. This article plays into the idea that LGBTQ+ people are sexual predators, and that a handful of anecdotes is enough to paint an entire community with that brush.\n\nAdditionally, this article doesn’t only contain anti-trans disinformation and bigotry, but it also contains biphobic sentiments. The only Bisexual woman referenced in this piece, who is not named, is held up as the scary villain forcing a lesbian into sex that they do not want to consent to. Considering that Get The L Out and LGB Alliance were heavily cited in this piece, this does not come as a surprise, as both groups have a history of disrespecting bisexual individuals*⁷, particularly any who see transgender people as their legal gender.\n\nEither through incompetence or malice, the article fails to note that Lily Cade, the aforementioned cisgender lesbian and porn actress interviewed for the piece, has a history of allegations of coercing and sexually abusing other cisgender lesbians, dating back years.\n\nThe allegations against Lily Cade appear to have been substantiated by an apology she posted online, explaining her side of events, containing these quotes:\n\n“I feel ashamed now. I thought that that girls went along with me because they enjoyed it, but they did it because they felt like they couldn’t say no. I thought it was all in fun, but it wasn’t. I played a sexual predator in movies, but it was supposed to be tongue in cheek.”\n\n“I thought I was better than porn’s serial gropers, but I guess I was just the female of the species.”\n\nConsidering the nature of the article, we believe that failing to note that a cited interviewee has admitted to those offences is a clear indication of bias or incompetence in the reporting. Either this was missed due to journalistic failures, or it was deliberately omitted to avoid exposing that coercive sex can happen by any perpetrator, regardless of gender or gender identity.\n\nAdditionally, the article does not make it clear if Lily Cade was connected to the headline of the article. She is quoted as telling a story of being scheduled to film with a transgender woman and then cancelling the shoot when discovering the woman’s transgender status. At no point does Lily make any claim that the transgender woman or the production company tried to pressure her to do the scene anyway, adding to some of the confusion around her inclusion in the article.\n\nThe BBC has been continually platforming anti-trans hate groups, and anti-trans perspectives, without covering the perspectives of the transgender community themselves. This is a particularly egregious example, but it’s certainly not an isolated incident.\n\nPlatforming bigotry is not impartiality, and the BBC needs to recognise that. Painting an entire group as potentially dangerous based on a handful of anecdotes and unreliable (or biased) sources is a deeply dangerous act.\n\nIt is vital that the BBC, which is a government-endorsed public service that claims to be committed to achieving impartiality with the output of its content, rectifies this act with a sincere apology, amendment of the article to clarify the falsehoods and damage within, and commits to realigning with their original mission statement*¹³.\n\n*¹ https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-57853385\n\n*² https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidelines/accuracy/guidelines\n\n*³ https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-44757403\n\n*⁴ https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/\n\n*⁵ https://drive.google.com/file/d/12q_P2aIvcf00_8T9QXq2ZR3M8znESd1-/view & https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/speaking-out-guidance-on-campaigning-and-political-activity-by-charities-cc9/speaking-out-guidance-on-campaigning-and-political-activity-by-charities\n\n*⁶ https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/equality-act-guidance-for-charities/equality-act-guidance-for-charities\n\n*⁷ https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/01/20/lgb-alliance-t-shirt-bisexual-closet-glasgow-polo-lounge-nicole-jones/\n\n*⁸ https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/19/lgb-alliance-same-sex-marriage-twitter-transgender-homophobia-owen-jones-baclash/\n\n*⁹ https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/08/19/lgb-alliance-charity-commission-tweet/\n\n*¹⁰ https://inews.co.uk/news/neu-teacher-union-trans-lgbt-committee-446404\n\n*¹¹ https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2017/10/fake-news-1949-painted-gay-men-predators-decades/\n\n*¹² https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/17/trans-people-twice-as-likely-to-be-victims-of-in-england-and-wales\n\n*¹³ https://mission-statement.com/bbc/#:~:text=BBC%20mission%20statement%20is%20%E2%80%9Cto,society%20while%20fulfilling%20its%20objectives\n\nYours sincerely,"
