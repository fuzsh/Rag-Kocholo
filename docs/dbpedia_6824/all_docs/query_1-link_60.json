        "text": "Kids know, experientially and perhaps not with clearest logic, when they are not being parented. They know when that bond has been interfered with or damaged. I certainly did. I loved my mother, May Butler, very much and she loved me, but she wasn’t a functioning mother, not in any traditional sense. There wasn’t enough clear space in her head or broken heart for that to be even remotely possible. I desperately needed another parent.\n\nOur family, the Butlers, weren’t in any way a traditional clan, tragedy and its obvious fallout would play a huge part in how we were familiarly shaped. Before I was born my mother had lost two children – a toddler and a baby. In 1962, when she was four months pregnant with me, my dad, Jimmy Butler, would up sticks and abandon an already life-shattered May for another woman. In the grip of crippling poverty my mother was left with five sons and me on the way.\n\nGrief, marital breakdown and increasing financial impoverishment had already shaped my mother’s psychological landscape, when in 1970 the unthinkable happened. In a short, very sharp, six-week period, my brothers James, aged 27, and Thomas, 21, were killed in two separate and tragic incidents: both falling while working on demolition sites. The shockwaves this sent through my family and community were seismic and life at 6a Blackstock Gardens would never be the same again; grief ripped through, rapier-like, and without remorse.\n\nGrief is powerfully savage. Even in the darkest of silences it’s raw, strobing and barbaric. Although never explicitly stated, the consensus was that grief belonged only to adults. Adults can be very selfish like that … I was eight and, I assure you, grief doesn’t belong only to adults.\n\nMy brothers had often thrown me to the sky and I would acrobatically twist in the air, somehow landing on their backs. I missed the chortling freedom of “sky touching”, then gently thudding on the masculine solidity of their shoulders. My brothers had strong, very broad shoulders and just their physicality “gone” was heartbreaking enough.\n\nI clearly remember the dense Catholicism of their funerals and the whole of our community out. I recall getting into a too-long black car and through rosary-tinted windows seeing so much weeping. Women and men not quite understanding, an almost synchronised swaying of heads collectively chorusing their silent disbelief. My brothers’ funerals were huge events; there were hundreds of mourners, and to this over-imaginative kid it seemed like thousands. Looking back, it felt a little like being a working-class Kennedy.\n\nMy mother, who had been agoraphobic since I was four, took the full force of the blast, the devastating agony of losing two more children in such a short space. This finally and irreparably shattered her already fragile spirit. For years, she was just gone. Grief does that, takes you away. Although sitting or standing in front of me she, in all actuality, wasn’t there: hollow, empty and constantly searching. Her head expectantly darting to every night-time noise, her face lit hopeful with a split second of “just maybe”, and then, nothing … thumb to lips, body rocking.\n\nOf course, there were times she was caring, attentively aware, motherly. Then, without warning, a screeching hurling whatever-to-hand-at-you banshee. May was a prodigious hurler. My remaining brothers were seriously wild, feral young bucks drinking, drugging and painting the town a fighting blue: they, too, had to fill in the gaps. They would booze a lot with my father, a shadowy figure, a ghost dad and me his ghost kid – we would only briefly meet four times. So it was just me at home with my mother, looking after her, calming her down, having nightly to improvise stories to send her sleeping … rapidly becoming her parent. Who, then, was to parent me?\n\nLiverpool’s 1970s dockland areas where I grew up were fully employed and alive, their streets crowded with factory shift workers and the sparky, threadbare cheek of thundering kids. It was constantly on the move: vibrant, confident, whistling, chattering … all the things sitting alone with my mother wasn’t. Just being in those eclectically noisy streets was respite enough; jigging in and around their ribald, animated anarchy was soothing and becalming.\n\nWe lived in a giant red-brick tenement, a ghetto slum supposedly, but not to me. As far as I was concerned, it was an enormous Tolkien-like castle with huge arches and long landings stretching to the gothic eternities of industry. My Liverpool was lit by glowing factories, roaring traffic and fire-spitting braziers, its pubs a sing-song medley of glamorously beehived women and sharply tailored suitors. It felt warm, alert, responsive and the storytelling … oh, it told stories all right: funny, scary, edgy, bawdy, all-encompassing tales. It welcomed me, held my attention, played, spoke and sang.\n\nThere could be any number of dark scenarios being played out at home, usually me completely enveloped by the retching, sobbing physicality of my mother. I could feel her cloth and bones heaving in and out around me, often at a suffocating pitch, like being ensconced in a pulsing cave of grief. My natural reaction was always to escape, to breathe, but I knew I had to be buried alive until the sobbing which could go on for hours, stopped. In my fleshy, pink, polycotton cave all I could think about was the colourful noise of outside and how to get back to it.\n\nThe great plus of May’s agoraphobia was that I had to run all the house errands, or as we say in Liverpool, “do the messages”. So I was always hatching some dark, Machiavellian plan to sneak to the shops. First, to be free of my sorrow-bedraggled ma (tears weigh a tonne) and second, to gleefully run into the welcoming, partying maelstrom of outside. And that’s when it dawned on me, a revelatory moment. “Outside” was my other parent. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t suddenly call outside “mother” or anything daft like that, but it was doing all the exciting things my actual parent wasn’t. I longed to be with it, to run into its invisible, smoggy arms, wanted it to take me with a polluted hand and lead me somewhere, anywhere but home.\n\nBlackstock Gardens was sandwiched between three main traffic arteries: Scotland Road, Vauxhall Road and my favourite, the Dock Road. They were huge city-long highwaying thoroughfares leading from the docklands to the rest of the country. I’d walked down and around them, known and wildly flirted with all three, but it was the Dock Road stealing my heart. From a once-working, peopled vivacity to its aching, sprawling emptiness, it completely had me.\n\nDominated by a huge five-sided clock it was Atlantean, mythical and ever-changing as the weather. Its architecture a Gulliver red-brick giant and me its Lilliputian child skipping among the huge, rusting chains and towering warehouses of its breath-defying landscapes. In those early discoing 70s, it very much danced, parties of people pouring in and out of its many pubs. There was a tremendous energy in those auld Dock Road ale-houses, ancient and Rabelaisian, especially in their cackling, crackling ladies of the night. They were often very kind to me, those women, concerned I was out so late, always asking me why. I couldn’t tell them I was escaping my parent to be with my parent. They would lovingly shoo me home, often with some loose change, a bag of smoky bacon crisps and a giant bottle of dandelion and burdock.\n\nThen, in what seemed no time at all, those gregarious, boozy after-work dos became redundancy parties. Not long after that, there were few pubs and even fewer people. What was a be-cobbled corridor of drunkenly chaotic celebration became a ghost road.\n\nWeirdly, I think I loved my abandoned Dock Road even more. After all, I was no stranger to loss and used to the company of ghosts – my real mother entertained them all the time. The difference was, this grieving parent was wide open, didn’t close in, didn’t choke; it had the sky and it was never the same sky twice. No sudden rage or crumbling wailing, its treacly tears weren’t sobbing down the back of my neck, they were the Mersey gently lapping against its side. In many ways we were the perfect parent-child relationship. I knew what it was like to care for an injured, empty parent. This time though, I had a parent able to care for an injured, empty child. I was wholly comforted by these surroundings; they filled me up, its huge anima-like emptiness made me feel safe, safe enough to finally access confidence, confident enough to even be scared.\n\nIt simply let me be. I let it be. We were conjoined by a playing, freeing independent sense of kinship and sorrow. Its continuing entropy and my ageing youth were naturally bonded by the simple complexities of needing. We holistically needed each other. More than that, we were made for each other.\n\nThe Dock Road was my wall-less, ceiling-less parent helping me touch the sky by myself – something my real mother was completely incapable of. Being so acutely agoraphobic, May Butler didn’t experience sky for more than 30 years."
