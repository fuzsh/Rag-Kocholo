Woven into the story of Yoshi’s adventures in love, resistance, and sex, is a critique of the crushing violence of homonormativity and its deadly perpetuation of US patriotism, conservative kinship structures and affective accumulation. Homotopia holds cinematic assumptions hostage through its motley assemblage of never-passing crew. Race, gender, ability and desire are reworked through an anti-colonial take of queer struggle creating a visual rhythm of melancholic utopianism that knows there may be no future but still hopes today is not their last. Love revolution, not State delusion, Homotopia. http://homotopiafilm.net/\n\n8:30 PM\n\nBetter This World\n\nA case of solid journalism that happens to be cinematically interesting, “Better This World” traces the curlicues and conspiracies surrounding the trials of two protestors arrested during the 2008 Republican National Convention. Filmmakers Katie Galloway and Kelly Duane de la Vega sympathize with the protestors, but they also consider the facts of the case by listening to the key players. Result is a docu thriller with twists that will catch many by surprise. Sept. 6 airing on PBS’ “POV” makes Stateside theatrical chances slim, but global biz and fest play should be terrific.\n\n10:00 PM\n\nPanel Discussion with scott crow, Larra, Arwyn\n\nSunday:\n\n9-10:30-\n\nBREAKFAST\n\n10:30-11:30\n\nRadical Education\n\nAbraham De Leon (San Antonio, TX)\n\nPrison Abolition and Know your rights:\n\nCritical Resistance Houston (Houston, TX)\n\n12:00-1:00\n\nSolidarity With Peoples Movements: From Palestine to New Orleans to Egypt\n\nJordan Flaherty (New Orleans, LA)\n\nConsent Panel\n\nB.E.T.C.H – Beautiful Educated Thunder Cunts from Hell (Houston/Austin, TX)\n\n1:00-2:30-\n\nLUNCH\n\n2:30-3:30-\n\nThe Portrayal of Arabs in the Media and the Houston Palestine Film Festival\n\nHadeel Assali, (Houston,TX)\n\nDOA Bloc: Anarchism and Contentions With Mainstream Organizing\n\nGrace (Phoenix, Arizona)\n\n4:00-5:00-\n\nFrom Bonnot to Colton: Illegalism Through History\n\nAragorn!

They move effortlessly through heavy real topics of gender and sexuality in an accessible, humorous way. Relying heavily on performative transformation, a contemporary approach to textiles in a collaboration with media art.\n\n6:45\n\nHousekeeping\n\nHousekeeping has been screened in Stockholm, Sweden, and San Francisco.\n\n7:00\n\nThe queer farmer film project is a documentary that captures the intersection of queer and farming. From urban gardening projects to rural agriculture–the QFFP gives a voice to the many faces of queer farmers, and the slow foods movement.\n\nThis short was screened at the San Francisco 2009 Tranny Film Fest, and in New York. The project was also covered in Curve Magazine’s Lesbian Localvores article in the2010 July/August issue.\n\nFor more info please visit: http://queerfarmer.blogspot.com/\n\n7:30\n\nJustice On Trial\n\nJustice on Trial navigates the tempest of the Abu-Jamal trial by reviewing the known facts of the case. It demonstrates that the major violations in the Abu-Jamal case — judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, racial discrimination in jury selection, police corruption and tampering with evidence to obtain a conviction– are not special to this case. Instead, they are commonly practiced within the criminal justice system and account for the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans and Latinos in the United States. The case of Mumia Abu-Jamal is a microcosm of greater problems in the criminal justice system in the United States today. The attention that its many violations have received make the Abu-Jamal case one of the most important civil rights cases of our time.\n\nOutside Workshops:\n\nHouston Indymedia, Houston underground media explosion\n\nSouthern Radical Space Roundtable\n\nPresented by: Monkey Wrench Books (Austin,TX)\n\nInternalized Sexism (Womyn Only)\n\nArwyn (ATX)\n\nReal School(HTX)\n\nMutualism\n\nWill Schnack (Arlington, TX)\n\nTABLES:\n\nLOCAL:\n\nSedition Books (Houston, TX)\n\nCritical Resistance (Houston, TX)\n\nSDS/Fair Labor Action Committee (Houston, TX)\n\nEarth First!/Rising Tide North America (Houston, TX)\n\nZine Fest Houston (Houston, TX)\n\nWaste and Void Distro (Houston, TX)\n\nTEXAS:\n\nIndymedia (Houston/Austin, TX)\n\nBETCH – Beautiful Educated Thunder Cunts from Hell (Houston/Austin, TX)\n\nBroken Brick Distro (San Antonio, TX)\n\nMonkey Wrench Books (Austin, TX)\n\nTumbleweed Infoshop (Austin, TX)\n\nRadical Mental Health (Austin, TX)\n\nEcology Action (Austin, TX)\n\nNATIONAL:\n\nLittle Black Cart (Santa Cruz, CA)\n\nAK Press (Oakland, CA)\n\nPM Press (Oakland, CA)\n\nIron Rail (New Orleans, LA)\n\nSeth Tobocman (New York, NY)\n\nTaala Hooghan (Flagstaff, AZ)\n\nLong Haul Infoshop (Berkeley, CA)\n\nSlingshot!
