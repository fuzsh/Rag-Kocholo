Homotopia-

Set sometime in the future-present Homotopia chronicles a group of radical queer’s dedicated to exposing the trouble with gay marriage, dismantling the State, undoing Empire, while looking totally fierce. Woven into the story of Yoshi’s adventures in love, resistance, and sex, is a critique of the crushing violence of homonormativity and its deadly perpetuation of US patriotism, conservative kinship structures and affective accumulation. Homotopia holds cinematic assumptions hostage through its motley assemblage of never-passing crew. Race, gender, ability and desire are reworked through an anti-colonial take of queer struggle creating a visual rhythm of melancholic utopianism that knows there may be no future but still hopes today is not their last. Love revolution, not State delusion, Homotopia. http://homotopiafilm.net/

8:30 PM

Better This World

A case of solid journalism that happens to be cinematically interesting, “Better This World” traces the curlicues and conspiracies surrounding the trials of two protestors arrested during the 2008 Republican National Convention. Filmmakers Katie Galloway and Kelly Duane de la Vega sympathize with the protestors, but they also consider the facts of the case by listening to the key players. Result is a docu thriller with twists that will catch many by surprise. Sept. 6 airing on PBS’ “POV” makes Stateside theatrical chances slim, but global biz and fest play should be terrific.

Feast Of The Beast- by Mev Luna

A performative video about a monster hell bent on consuming pronoun cakes representing the gender spectrum in an attempt to “undo” gender, but in the process becomes “undone” by the commentary from the curator and the mass amount of cake consumed.

Feast of the Beast has been screened at Artist’s Television Access in San Francisco, and as part of Open Your Golden Gates in Berlin, Hamburg, and Montreal.

Mev Luna is a new strong voice in postqueer movement using their twisted modern day perversion as a new form of sexual identity. They move effortlessly through heavy real topics of gender and sexuality in an accessible, humorous way. Relying heavily on performative transformation, a contemporary approach to textiles in a collaboration with media art.

Justice On Trial

Justice on Trial navigates the tempest of the Abu-Jamal trial by reviewing the known facts of the case. It demonstrates that the major violations in the Abu-Jamal case — judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, racial discrimination in jury selection, police corruption and tampering with evidence to obtain a conviction– are not special to this case. Instead, they are commonly practiced within the criminal justice system and account for the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans and Latinos in the United States. The case of Mumia Abu-Jamal is a microcosm of greater problems in the criminal justice system in the United States today. The attention that its many violations have received make the Abu-Jamal case one of the most important civil rights cases of our time.
