        "text": "Watch the Atlanta Falcons live without cable on the device of your choice, including Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, Roku, and more.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAtlanta Falcons player to watch – #70\n\nImportant channels\n\nTop picks\n\nCons\n\nFAQ\n\nFind Your NFL Team By Conference\n\nSeveral live TV streaming services, including DIRECTV STREAM, Fubo, and Hulu + Live TV offer full coverage of the Falcons season for local fans, plus the NFL Playoffs and Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nOur top pick for watching the Atlanta Falcons live without cable, Fubo, carries WAGA-TV, FOX 5 Atlanta, ESPN, CBS, and NBC, and also offers an upgrade to watch the Braves and Hawks on Bally Sports Southeast. Out-of-market Falcons fans can watch the team by adding NFL Sunday Ticket to YouTube TV.\n\nFor local Falcons fans that plan to stream games on mobile or a tablet, NFL+ offers by far the best value.\n\nAtlanta Falcons player to watch – #70\n\nWhen we tune in to watch the Falcons this season, we will have an eye on #70 LT Jake Matthews. Matthews’ salary will take a whopping $28,358,823 of salary cap space for the team this season. That is a mind-blowing number. It will be fun to watch the Falcon’s OL play to see whether they can keep the Falcon’s QBs upright.\n\nFalcons fans can follow Jake Matthews on Twitter, here.\n\nImportant channels\n\nThe Falcons play in the NFC, and as the channel with the TV rights to most NFC games through 2033, FOX will be an essential channel for watching regular season Falcons games. The local FOX affiliate in Atlanta is FOX 5, WAGA-TV. When the Falcons are facing an AFC opponent, some games may also be broadcast on CBS Atlanta 46, WGCL-TV. A handful of times each season, the Falcons will also play on national TV on ESPN, NBC, and Amazon Prime.\n\nNFL coverage for each channel:\n\nCBS – In-market AFC games / some NFL Playoff games / Super Bowl LVIII\n\nFOX – In-market NFC Games / some NFL Playoff games /\n\nESPN – Monday Night Football / some NFL Playoff games\n\nNBC – Sunday Night Football / some NFL playoff games\n\nAmazon Prime – Thursday Night Football\n\nThe table below documents the live TV streaming providers that carry the most important channels for watching the NFL.\n\nFuboDIRECTV STREAMHulu + Live TVSling BlueYouTube TVParamount+ ABC CBS ESPN FOX NBC NFL Network NFL RedZone\n\nNote: Sling TV carries FOX and NBC, but only in select markets.\n\nTop picks\n\nFubo offers full local Falcons coverage for NFL fans in the Atlanta TV market.\n\nPros\n\nFull local Falcons coverage. Watch the Falcons in-market on Fubo from the pre-season all the way through Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nFast and easy to setup. fuboTV carries all the channels you need for watching NFL football and is easy and fast to setup, plus the service offers a 7 day free trial.\n\nExcellent choice for older family members. Having been Fubo customers on and off for years, the app is an excellent choice for older family members who might not be as tech-savvy.\n\nFollow your team feature. The ability to curate the Fubo experience by team goes above and beyond, with fuboTV even texting users in advance so they don’t forget when their favorite team is on.\n\nExtensive college football coverage. We have used the app extensively and highly recommend it for watching football. Fubo also carries the regional sports networks ATL sports fans need to watch the Hawks and is also a good option for following Georgia and Georgia Tech football this season.\n\n4K upgrade\n\nCons\n\nOnly 1,000 hours of DVR\n\nLacks TBS and TNT\n\nWatch FOX broadcasts from Atlanta on Sling TV Blue.\n\nPros\n\nWatch WAGA-TV FOX 5 for cheap. Although Sling TV only carries local channels in select markets, you can watch the Falcons games that appear on FOX on SlingTV Blue if you are in the Atlanta TV market.\n\nBudget friendly. Compared to Fubo, Sling Blue offers a savings of about $500 per year.\n\nUpgrade for Monday Night Football. There is also the option of upgrading to Sling Orange & Blue to get ESPN, and Monday Night Football, but this makes Sling too pricey to justify the cost.\n\nCons\n\nDoesn’t offer full Falcons coverage. Although NFL fans in ATL can get a good chunk of Falcons games with Sling TV Blue, there will be gaps in coverage. One solution is to add Paramount+ to Sling Blue to gain access to the Falcon’s games that air on CBS. Going this route would still save about $400 per year over most competing streaming services.\n\nDIRECTV STREAM carries the channels Falcons fans in the Atlanta TV market need to watch every game.\n\nPros\n\nFull Falcons coverage from Atlanta. Yes, DIRECTV STREAM carries all the channels you need for NFL action in the base package.\n\nUpgrade for Bally Sports Southeast. Additionally, the platform is a great choice for Atlanta sports fans because DTV carries Bally Sports Southeast, the regional sports network that broadcasts the Hawks and the Braves, in the “Choice” package.\n\nWatch UGA football. Although the majority of Georgia football games can be streamed on DIRECTV STREAM in the base package, upgrading to “Choice” ensures full coverage with the addition of SEC Network.\n\nCons\n\nLacks NFL Sunday Ticket\n\nUser interface lags behind competition\n\nHulu + Live TV carries the channels to watch the Atlanta Falcons in-market and nationally televised games, including the preseason, NFL playoffs, and Super Bowl.\n\nPros\n\nUnlimited DVR\n\nFull coverage for local ATL Falcons fans\n\nNFL Network for international games. Hulu + Live TV carries NFL Network, a key channel for following the NFL’s growing lineup of overseas games, such as games played in London.\n\nWatch UFC PPV and Fight Night. I am a current Hulu + Live TV subscriber largely because of the ESPN+ bundle, which allows me to stream UFC events, including the Ultimate Fighter, direct from the Hulu app. This setup is way more convenient than having to switch over to the ESPN app and order from the ESPN+ tab, which can be frustrating on some devices.\n\nCons\n\nIn-app UFC PPV purchases can be buggy\n\nLacks Bally Sports Southeast upgrade\n\nRead our Hulu + Live TV review.\n\nYouTube TV carries CBS, FOX, ESPN, and NBC, all the channels you need to watch the Falcons live online.\n\nPros\n\nFull Falcons coverage for local ATL fans + a 14 day free-trial\n\n4K upgrade\n\nLongest free trial. At a generous 14 days, YouTube TV currently has the longest free trial in the industry for watching the Falcons for free.\n\nInnovative sports features. YouTube TV has innovated in the sports streaming space with features like Key Plays and Stats View. We also love the 4K plus add-on.\n\nGreat for multilingual families. My wife is Japanese, and we are raising our kids to be bilingual. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED when I logged into the YouTube TV family share and saw how seamless the transition was from English to Japanese for my wife’s account. Atlanta is a growing city with an international population with thousands of families who would benefit from the seamless language transitions offered by YouTube TV.\n\nWatch the Falcons out-of-state. YouTube TV is the home of NFL Sunday Ticket, which means Falcons fans can follow the team no matter where they live.\n\nCons\n\nGoogle account required to signup, which can slow down the signup process\n\nAdding NFL Sunday Ticket is very expensive\n\nLacks Bally Sports Southeast upgrade, which means no Braves and Hawks regular season\n\nRead our YouTube TV review for sports fans.\n\nIf you don’t live near Atlanta and want to watch every Falcons game, NFL Sunday Ticket, the NFL’s out-of-market premium package, is the best option.\n\nNew for this season, YouTube TV now has the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket.\n\nIf you don’t live close to Atlanta, you can watch every 1 and 4 PM regular season Falcons game live without cable on NFL Sunday Ticket.\n\nBe aware: NFL+ is only available on mobile and tablets.\n\nHowever, if you are an ATL fan who watches on your phone, NFL+ offers full local coverage of the Falcon’s season through the NFL playoffs for savings of over $800 versus Fubo. NFL+ offers a 7 day free trial.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I watch Atlanta Falcons games on Paramount+?\n\nNot usually, no. The NFL on CBS broadcasts AFC games, and the Falcons are an NFC team. You can watch the Falcons on Paramount+ when you are in-market for the game, and the Falcons are playing an AFC opponent, like the Broncos or Patriots.\n\nCan I watch the Falcons on Bally Sports Southeast\n\nNo, you cannot watch the Falcons on Bally Sports Southeast, but you can watch in-market Braves and Hawks regular season games on the channel.\n\nWhich regions are in-market for Falcons games?\n\nExcept for nationally televised games, like Monday Night Football, the NFL broadcasts most games regionally based on zip code. As such, Atlanta fans in the Atlanta area or nearby markets like Augusta, Georgia, will have the easiest path to live-streaming Falcons games every Sunday on their local FOX and CBS affiliate.\n\nBased on a review of the 506 Sports coverage maps, I would estimate that the following areas will be in-market for Falcons fans, which means most games will be on their local FOX affiliate week to week:\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\nAthens, GA\n\nAugusta, GA\n\nColumbus, GA\n\nMacon, GA\n\nSavannah, GA\n\nHuntsville, AL\n\nThe tricky thing for Falcons fans is that the in-market territories for Atlanta games can fluctuate from week to week. The good news for Falcons fans who find themselves out-of-market for a given game is it is easy for this season to add NFL Sunday Ticket to YouTube TV.\n\nFind Your NFL Team By Conference"
