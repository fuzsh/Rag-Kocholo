The editors at SportsTVJobs.com have compiled research on the Top 30 sports broadcasting cities and scored each city by opportunity. The \"Sports Broadcasting Job Opportunity Score\" weighs a city’s potential for sports broadcasting jobs based on how many local TV stations, sports networks and professional sports teams exist in the designated market area (DMA).\n\n#1 Los Angeles, CA\n\nLocal TV Stations Regional Sports Networks Professional Sports Teams KCBS (CBS) Fox Sports Net Dodgers (MLB) KNBC (NBC) Fox Sports West Angles (MLB) KTLA (CW) Fox Soccer Channel Lakers (NBA) KABC (ABC) Fox Deportes Clippers (NBA) KCAL (Ind.)

Highest potential for work scores more points.\n\nRegional Sports Bureau Points Assigned = 10\n\nNot all Regional Sports Networks are created alike. Fox Sports Net employs a system where one production center will serve multiple networks. For example: The majority of the FS Carolinas staff is based at the FS South production center in Atlanta. FS Carolinas has a staff locally in Charlotte, larger than most local TV stations but smaller than full-sized regional or national sports networks.\n\nLocal TV Stations\n\nPoints Assigned = 5\n\nLarge markets have anywhere between 5-10 people in their sports department (i.e. a city like New York with multiple teams across all sports). The smaller markets are typically staffed with 2-4. Less potential jobs compared to a Regional or National Sports Network.\n\nProfessional Sports Teams\n\nPoints Assigned = 2\n\nProfessional Sports teams have their own broadcasting departments that produce original programming and are involved in team activities. The hardest of the three to crack because the demand is so high. If you got to work for your sports team, would you leave? Exactly. A job opening is rare and the staffs are usually small to begin with.\n\n* These are Nielsen estimates of local television market size as of January 1, 2010 Copyright © 2010 The Nielsen Company.
