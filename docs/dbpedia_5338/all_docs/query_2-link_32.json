        "text": "The NFC South is wide open heading into 2023, and two young QBs in the division get the chance to go at it in Week 1.\n\nBryce Young is set to make his NFL debut Sunday when this year's No. 1 overall draft pick and the Panthers travel to Atlanta to face off against Desmond Ridder and the Falcons.\n\nMORE: Full NFL coverage map for Week 1 broadcasts\n\nThe Matt Rhule era in Carolina ended earlier than expected, as the head coach was fired just five games into his second season after the Panthers began last year 1-4. Interim head coach Steve Wilks helped improve the team, as Carolina went 6-6 down the stretch to finish 7-10.\n\nAfter failing to make the postseason and still in search of a franchise QB, the Panthers made the bold decision to trade up for the No. 1 pick at the draft, landing Young. With the talented QB out of Alabama at the helm, it's a new look on offense for Carolina, which brought in running back Miles Sanders and wide receivers D.J. Chark Jr. and Adam Thielen while saying goodbye to wide receiver D.J. Moore.\n\nFor Atlanta, this marks the first season when Ridder, a 2022 draft selection out of Cincinnati, has the starting job to begin the season. The Falcons struggled under Marcus Mariota last season, finishing the year 7-10 with Ridder taking over for the veteran QB by the end of the year.\n\nThe biggest talking point with the Falcons entering this season is running back Bijan Robinson, who was selected eighth overall in this year's draft out of Texas. The dynamic running back is expected to be a focal point in the Falcons' offense.\n\nMORE: Watch Panthers vs. Falcons live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nHere's how to watch the Panthers and Falcons square off in NFL Week 1.\n\nWhat channel is Panthers vs. Falcons on today?\n\nTV channel (national): Fox\n\nTV channel (Charlotte): WJZY\n\nTV channel (Atlanta): WAGA\n\nLive Stream: Fubo | Fox Sports app | DAZN (Canada)\n\nThe Panthers vs. Falcons game will broadcast regionally on local Fox affiliates.
