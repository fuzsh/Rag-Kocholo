        "text": "If you’re thinking about cord-cutting in favor of using streaming services, one of the things you might be wondering is how you can watch local channels, news, and live sports without cable.\n\nIn a hurry? Sling Blue comes with NBC and Fox in select markets. Or you can integrate it with an antenna. Save 50% on your first month of Sling TV.\n\nFor many people, antennas are a solid option, but they don’t work for everyone. And frankly, some people just don’t like the hassle of using an antenna.\n\nOne of the most popular cable TV alternatives for streaming live TV is Sling TV. With Sling, you get many of the most popular cable channels, such as ESPN, CNN, HGTV, Disney, NFL Network, Fox News, TBS, TNT, MLB TV, and more, streaming live to your device.\n\nBut what about your locals? Read on to learn more what local channels you can expect to receive when you sign up with Sling.\n\nSling TV: The Basics\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Sling TV, you should probably head over to our full review to provide a general overview of plans, channels, devices, and generally how it works. Here’s what prospective Slingers should know:\n\nSling TV is a live TV streaming provider\n\nYou can use it to watch live sports, movies, TV shows, and more\n\nYou can pay as little as $40.00/mo, and there are no contracts\n\nIf you do prepay two or three months, you can get free or discounted devices (more on that below)\n\nYou can use it with many of your favorite devices (such as Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, Android or iOS mobile devices, smart TVs, and other streaming devices)\n\nThere are various three main Sling TV packages, Sling Orange, Sling Blue, and Sling Orange + Blue, ranging from 30+ to 50+ channels\n\nThere are lots and lots of add-ons, including bundles like the Lifestyle Extra or the Sports Extra, plus individual services like Showtime, MGM+, Discovery+, and AMC+.\n\nAll plans come with at least 50 hours of cloud DVR storage.\n\nSling TV With Antenna\n\nAs the first live TV streaming service, Sling TV has a connection to the days when most channels could not be streamed. And that was most true of local network affiliates. As a result, Sling allows subscribers to integrate an antenna with its service in a way that no other service can.\n\nUsing an AirTV device (see below), you can get your HD antenna channels incorporated right into the Sling app. So the fact that you don’t have streaming access to over-the-air channels doesn’t really matter.\n\nHow To Stream Local Channels with Sling TV\n\nWhile a Sling TV subscription is one of the best ways to get popular national cable channels, the truth is its local channel selection for streaming is lacking.\n\nSling does not offer the near-universal coverage of big providers like DIRECTV STREAM. But that’s to be expected. The Sling Blue plan is half the cost of its lowest priced plan.\n\nSo what can you expect from Sling’s local station selection?\n\nABC\n\nABC is now available in select markets with the Sling Blue plan. It is available in the following areas:\n\nIf you live in one of these areas, the cost of Sling Blue goes up $5 over the base $40.00/mo price.\n\nPretty much everything on ABC Sports, like NBA games or college football, is available with ESPN3, which is included in the Sling Orange package for $40.00/mo.\n\nCBS\n\nSling TV has never carried CBS in its channel lineup, and we don’t expect them to add the channel in the foreseeable future. Other services like FuboTV and Hulu Live TV do let you stream CBS in many markets.\n\nYour other option is to combine Sling with Paramount+. The base plan ($4.99/mo) offers you on-demand access to it as well as all the CBS Sports live broadcasts. You can get your local CBS affiliate through the premium plan ($9.99/mo).\n\nIf you want this channel, check out our guide on how to watch CBS online with other streaming services.\n\nFox\n\nLocal Fox affiliates are available in select locations with the Sling Blue plan. These locations are:\n\nNBC\n\nThere are fewer NBC affiliates available:\n\nNote that the Sling Blue plan offers both Fox and NBC in just seven cities: Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.\n\nOther Local Channels\n\nCan You Watch PBS on Sling TV?\n\nNo, you can’t watch PBS on Sling at this time. As a matter of fact, most of the major TV streaming services do not carry PBS. The only two are DIRECTV STREAM and YouTube TV.\n\nIf you want to watch PBS without an antenna or cable, your best bet is to download the PBS Video app on your device to access its content, or visit pbs.org.\n\nCan You Watch The CW on Sling TV?\n\nNo Sling package offers The CW at this time. Hulu Live and FuboTV currently carry CW stations in most markets. There’s also the CW app, which carries some on-demand content from the network.\n\nCan You Watch Telemundo on Sling TV?\n\nNo, Sling does not carry Telemundo streaming in any of its packages at this time. If you want to watch Telemundo online, you can get it with fuboTV, Hulu Live TV, and other streaming services.\n\nSling TV With HD Antenna\n\nSling TV doesn’t just make it easy for you to integrate OTA channels, it makes it cheap — or even free.\n\nThere are three deals Sling TV offers on hardware:\n\nHD Indoor Antenna: This $49.99 value is free when you prepay for two months of Sling. It allows you to watch local channels, although you will have to use a separate app for that.\n\nAirTV 2 + HD Indoor Antenna: This $149.98 value costs $49 when you prepay for three months of Sling. With this set-up, you can have access to your streaming and OTA channels together in your Sling TV guide.\n\nAirTV Anywhere + HD Indoor Antenna: This $244.98 value is just $99 when you prepay 3 months of Sling. It’s got all the benefits of the AirTV 2, plus you can DVR from your local channels just like your Sling TV channels.\n\nNote that Sling also offers a free AirTV Mini ($79.99 value) when you prepay for two months. That’s a great deal, but despite the name, it will not allow you to pipe your OTA channels into the Sling TV guide. It does include content from other streaming services, like Netflix, in one channel guide with your Sling content.\n\nWith any of the three options above, you will have access to all the local OTA channels in your area. This will, of course, depend upon your antenna and location. But under most circumstances, you should be able to get the Big 4 channels if not PBS, Telemundo, Univision, and UniMas.\n\nSo, while you still need an antenna to get all of your locals, the ability to integrate them directly into your Sling TV interface makes it really convenient to stream your local channels at home or on the go.\n\nSee our guide to Sling’s discounted devices and freebies.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nFor more information on this popular streaming service, check out our complete Sling TV review. It has all the details on channels, prices, device compatibility, and more.\n\nSave 50% on your first month of Sling TV.\n\nSave 50% on Sling TV Now\n\nFAQs\n\nDidn’t Sling TV used to carry ABC?\n\nSling carried ABC in its Broadcast Extra add-on package in its early days. However, Sling ditched the Broadcast Extra bundle after losing Univision and UniMas in a contractual dispute. But in 2023, Sling TV brought back ABC as part of its Sling Blue plan in 8 metro areas. It costs $5/mo extra for the channel.\n\nDoes Sling TV have any regional sports networks?\n\nNo. If they’re a must-have dealbreaker for you, DIRECT STREAM has the best regional sports coverage, though fuboTV may give them a run for their money when they start carrying the Bally sports networks again. Hulu Live and YouTube TV each have a handful as well. Just be warned: they don’t come cheap.\n\nWhy isn’t Sling TV’s local coverage better?\n\nTo keep their prices low. NBC might be NBC to you, but KVLY-TV in Fargo, North Dakota might as well be Discovery or CNN or HBO to KNAZ-TV in Flagstaff, Arizona — even though they’re both NBC affiliates. And if a TV service wants to carry them, it has to negotiate and contract with both the network HQ, which owns and operates a lot of the stations, as well as individually with all the independently-owned ones.\n\nAll of that adds up, and is a big part of why the bigger services cost so much more. Sling prefers to offer free antennas, giving the power and control back to the subscriber.\n\nIf Sling TV doesn’t carry Fox or NBC in my area, can I still watch them on their websites?\n\nUnfortunately not. Sling does support TV Everywhere, the universal login system used by TV providers to let subscribers watch programming through their website or app. But TV Everywhere can only provide you access to content you get through your subscription. If your local affiliate isn’t part of your subscription, you won’t be able to access it through TV Everywhere.\n\nWouldn’t it be cheaper if I just skipped local channels and live sports altogether?\n\nYes, it would — you just described Philo ($28/mo) or Frndly TV ($7.99/mo). For most folks, live sports, current news, and local events are the mainstays of broadcast TV, but not for everyone. These services specialize in a variety of fun, entertaining channels at a price that can’t be beat.\n\nWhat kinds of things can I watch on local channels with Sling TV?\n\nSling TV allows you to watch a lot of shows, movies, and events. To make it easier to find stuff you will like, we’ve created guides for viewing different kinds of things. That’s especially true when it comes to sports. Read on!\n\nHave a look at our guides for watching the NFL regular season — like Sunday Night Football, Monday Night Football, and NFL RedZone — as well as special games like Thanksgiving Day football and the Super Bowl itself.

Races such as the Singapore Grand Prix, Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Australian Grand Prix, and the final F1 season race, the Abu Dhabi GP, and three right here in the United States! Plus, the race that tests pure endurance: 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nAnd if NCAA Sports are your thing, we have guides for soccer, ice hockey, volleyball, lacrosse, men’s golf, bowl season, and the Women’s Beach Volleyball Championship.

But it’s no problem with Sling. See our guides on English Premier League on Sling TV along with the 2023 season schedule and Boxing Day guide, tune into Ligue 1 for French soccer action, or check out Brasilian soccer (including Brasileirão Série A and its top teams). Not to mention AFCON and the FIFA World Cup itself.\n\nDomestic soccer fans will want to tune in for CONCACAF Gold Cup and Champions Cup.\n\nFor more international sports, there’s the 2023 Rugby World Cup Final in Paris. Cricket fans will find much to like in our 2023 season guide along with information about the T20 ICC World Cup Finals, ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, and the ODI World Cup and Finals.
