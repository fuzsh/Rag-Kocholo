        "text": "Morning anchor Jessica Brown will leave WXIX-TV Friday to anchor at WCVB-TV in Boston, the nation's 10th largest TV market.\n\nBrown has worked nine years at Fox 19 in Cincinnati, market No. 36.\n\n\"After 9 years, this will be my last week at Fox 19 (So crazy and tough to say). I've loved spending my mornings with you, laughing with you and even embarrassingly crying with you, but most importantly sharing with you what’s important and happening in your communities,\" she posted on Facebook Monday morning and Twitter.\n\n\"I'm heading to to Boston, MA for an amazing opportunity at WCVB,\" she said.\n\nAt the Boston ABC affiliate Brown will co-anchor noon and 4 p.m. weekday newscasts, the station announced. The Boston station is owned by Hearst Television, which also owns WLWT-TV.\n\nBrown, a Ft. Lauderdale native, joined Channel 19 in August 2012 to launch the weekend morning newscast with Dan Wells. She was promoted to weekend morning co-anchor in January 2018 to work with Wells again after Kara Sewell went home to Texas.\n\nThe Florida State University graduate began her news career at WAGA-TV in Atlanta, and came to Cincinnati from KSNF-TV and KODE-TV in Joplin, Mo.\n\n\"THANK YOU so much for allowing me to be a part of your mornings and just letting me be me! It's bittersweet for sure – if you know me at all you know I'm a believer in being open to the unexpected and really just leaning in and going for it,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"I'm not gone just yet though lol You’re stuck with me til Friday! I'll have more to share with you then,\" Brown wrote."
