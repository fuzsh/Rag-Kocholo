        "text": "Baseball fans relying on Comcast Xfinity to watch the Atlanta Braves will be unable to do so starting today.\n\nBally Sports Regional Networks, the broadcasting platform for most Braves games, is currently unavailable for Xfinity customers due to failed negotiations between the two companies.\n\nThis blackout affects Xfinity subscribers in Georgia. Comcast customers attempting to tune into Bally's channels will be greeted with a message regarding Bally Sports' bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe timing of this blackout is particularly inconvenient for Braves fans, as the team faces the Mariners in a crucial series finale. Scheduled for 3:40 p.m. on Wednesday, the Braves must secure a win to avoid a sweep.\n\nLooking ahead, the Braves are set to engage in a three-game series against the Dodgers starting Friday through Sunday. However, these games, too, will be broadcasted on Bally Sports.\n\nComcast says it will provide a refund to customers."
