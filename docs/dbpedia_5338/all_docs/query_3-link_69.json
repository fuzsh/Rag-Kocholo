        "text": "St. Pete police are investigating after finding human remains inside a home connected to Kelli Fisher, who disappeared more than two weeks ago.\n\nSPPD said the remains were found during a follow-up investigation of the house fire in the 1700 block of Prescott Street South, where Fisher was last seen. Detectives, the fire department and medical examiner were at the home on Wednesday after the remains were discovered.\n\nFOX 13 crews could see plywood being carried in and out of the home, as investigators gathered bags of evidence. Police said they're not currently connecting the fire to Fisher's disappearance, and they're awaiting autopsy results to find out who the remains belong to.\n\nPREVIOUS: St. Pete woman vanishes without a trace, family hoping for tips: ‘Please come forward’\n\nFisher was last seen at her aunt’s house on Prescott Street South on July 16. Next door is a home also owned by the family, where they said Kelli sometimes stayed as well. Investigators say the 42-year-old drove away in her aunt's car that day and hasn't been seen since.\n\nThe car was later found in an abandoned lot about a mile and a half away near 28th Avenue South.\n\nOn Sunday, there was a kitchen fire inside a home where Fisher stayed on Prescott Street South, next door to her aunt's house, where she's also known to spend time. Police previously said they did not believe Fisher was in the home at the time of the fire.\n\nWednesday's discovery comes one day after the family of Fisher and SPPD held a press conference asking the community for information in her disappearance.\n\n\"We’re asking the community if you know anything, if you’ve heard anything. If you’ve seen her, I’m pleading with you to get in touch with the St. Petersburg Police Department,\" said Fisher’s sister, Latifa Jackson.\n\nNeighbors who live on Fisher’s street said they didn’t even know she was missing. They said police didn’t interview them or ask to see their Ring doorbell video.\n\n\"I didn’t see any flyers, no one called there, there wasn’t any word of mouth,\" said neighbor Rae Centeno.\n\nThey said, while they consider the neighborhood safe, there is a lot of activity from nearby businesses at all hours of the night, and they worry about what could have happened to her.\n\n\"It’s heartbreaking, I feel like as a community we need to do a better job of looking out for our people,\" said Centeno.\n\nFOX 13 asked SPPD whether a tip came in after the press conference which led to the re-investigation at the home on Wednesday, but police said they didn’t have that information available today.\n\nFisher's family was at the scene on Wednesday, but understandably did not want to talk.\n\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to contact the St. Petersburg Police Department at 727-893-7780 or call 911. You can submit a tip anonymously by texting SPPD to TIP411 (847-411).\n\nWATCH FOX 13 NEWS:"
