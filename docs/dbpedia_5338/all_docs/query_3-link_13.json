        "text": "Starting on November 1, DirecTV will no longer carry FX, FSN, SPEED, National Geographic Channel, FOX Soccer, FOX Soccer Plus, FOX Deportes, FUEL TV and Fox Movie Channel.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nWhat's Happening?\n\nDespite Fox Networks’ offer of an extension during our ongoing negotiations, DirecTV has informed us and their customers that unless we agree to their demands, they “will suspend our networks on November 1.”\n\nDirecTV sent us a proposal on Tuesday afternoon. They have given us no chance to respond before taking an unnecessarily aggressive posture and going public. It is disappointing that they have chosen bad faith tactics over meaningful negotiation.\n\nWe have proposed to keep the Fox Networks on DirecTV for the same price, and on the same terms as they are currently carried while we attempt to work out a fair agreement. Unfortunately, DirecTV has decided that unless they get their way, they are going to pull the plug on their customers.\n\nDirecTV’s current agreement ends on November 1 and they have informed us that they will drop some of America’s most popular networks — FOX Sports Networks (and our 19 regional sports networks), FX, SPEED, National Geographic Channel, FOX Soccer, FOX Soccer Plus, FOX Deportes, FUEL TV and Fox Movie Channel.\n\nThe 19 FOX Sports Regional Networks include:\n\nFOX Sports Arizona\n\nFOX Sports Carolinas\n\nFOX Sports Detroit\n\nFOX Sports Florida\n\nFOX Sports Houston\n\nFOX Sports Indiana\n\nFOX Sports Kansas City\n\nFOX Sports Midwest\n\nFOX Sports North\n\nFOX Sports Ohio\n\nFOX Sports Oklahoma\n\nFOX Sports Southwest\n\nFOX Sports South\n\nFOX Sports Tennessee\n\nFOX Sports West\n\nFOX Sports Wisconsin\n\nPrime Ticket\n\nSportSouth\n\nSun Sports\n\nPlus, soon, you could lose the following local FOX stations:\n\nAtlanta : WAGA – FOX 5\n\nAustin : KTVC – FOX 7\n\nBaltimore My Network TV WUTB – 24\n\nBoston WFXT – FOX 25\n\nChicago WFLD – Fox Chicago\n\nChicago My Network TV WPWR – 50\n\nDallas : KDFW – FOX 4, My Network TV KDFI – 27\n\nDetroit : WJBK – FOX 2\n\nGainesville : WOGX – FOX 51\n\nHouston : KRIV – FOX 26, My Network TV KTXH – 27\n\nLos Angeles : KTTV – FOX 11, My Network TV KCOP – 13\n\nMemphis : WHBQ – FOX 13\n\nMinneapolis : KMSP – FOX 9, My Network TV WFTC – FOX 29\n\nNew York WNYW – FOX 5\n\nNew York My Network TV WWOR – 9\n\nOrlando : WOFL – FOX 35, My Network TV WRVW – 65\n\nPhoenix : KSAZ – FOX 10, My Network TV KUTP – FOX 45\n\nTampa : WTVT – FOX 13\n\nWashington D.C.
