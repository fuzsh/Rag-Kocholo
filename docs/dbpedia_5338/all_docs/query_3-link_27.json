        "text": "Atlanta's Digital TV Channels\n\nAtlanta is second in the nation for the number of digital stations available\n\nThe Free Channels You Can Receive With An\n\nAntenna from Atlanta Digital TV\n\nBelow is a list of the over 100 FREE Digital TV channels that can possibly be received in the Atlanta, GA area with an Over-The-Air antenna all can be received if your address is in a perfect area. Because digital TV doesn't use as much bandwidth as the old analog TV, each station can provide more channels (sub-channels) per frequency, thus the dot or dash numbers .2 .3 .4 etc. channel numbers. The primary channel will always be the .1. 2.1 is ABC or WSB channel 2 as you know it from cable, satellite and analog TV the dot .1 channels are usually HD. Some stations are low power and for a specific area like KTN Korean 47.1, is in Norcross and its signal doesn't go very far. WANN is low power but, shares a very high major tower. It holds its own with the high power stations in the metro Atlanta area but still, its signal won't reach as far as a million watt major channels. Most of the major Atlanta stations have a strong signal reaching well into and past the suburbs. Sub-channels (the .2 +) allow for more content & advertising to be provided to viewers. Most of the sub-channels are broadcast in SD 480i or standard definition.\n\nSome of the digital station's upgrade, add and change channels occasionally. So you should RE-SCAN your TV or Digital Box on a regular basis or you may not see the new sub-channels or changes some TV's will add them automatically.\n\nMost all of the stations are transmitted using the UHF band. Four stations use the VHF band. The UHF band is an ultra high frequency that has a shorter range than the VHF band. That is why it can be tricky to receive digital TV in the Atlanta area with its hills, buildings & trees. UHF frequencies are affected by trees, buildings, even strong winds moving tree limbs. TV signals often act like light beams traveling straight but can be reflected in a different direction.\n\nMany people who used to have an old antenna on their home had the old style log periodic type all band VHF/Uhf/FM antenna with the long rods in the back and short rods in the front which, which will work with digital TV, it just won't perform as well as the newer designed and smaller UHF/VHF-hi broad lobe antennas we use that are far better designed for the Atlanta reception area.\n\nUnlike Analog TV where you could still watch a weak and snowy picture with good sound, with Digital TV you will either have a perfectly watchable picture or an unwatchable picture that will be pixilated with the sound cutting in & out. We always use a higher gain antenna than is necessary for the strongest trouble-free reception. The HD picture will be the same no matter the digital signal strength.\n\nThe major Atlanta network stations in the list below are highlighted in RED and most .1 channels are in HD. These channels are a must have and any others channels received are a bonus. Some low power channels may broadcast intermittently. New channels can be added at any time. Some channels are low power stations and their signal will not reach as far as the major high power stations and may not be received at your address.\n\nThe Atlanta Channels Online TV Guide\n\n> www.TitanTV.com <\n\n\"Click Here\" For An Online TV Channel Guide.
