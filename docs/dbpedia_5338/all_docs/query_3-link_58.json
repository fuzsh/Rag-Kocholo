        "text": "Bizarre cases through the years of humans spontaneously combusting and dying have led to questions and theories about these incidents.\n\nIn the latest episode of TMZ’s \"Strange and Suspicious,\" a panel of guests delves into the documented cases.\n\nWhat is spontaneous human combustion?\n\nSpontaneous human combustion is a situation when a human body is found with significant portions of the middle parts of the body reduced to ashes, much less damage to the head and extremities, and minimal damage to the direct surroundings of the body, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nHave there been reported cases of spontaneous human combustion?\n\nThe mysterious death of Mary Hardy Reeser was a reported case of spontaneous human combustion investigated by authorities.\n\nReeser decided to enjoy a cigarette before bed and allegedly died in her sleep. Citing an article from the St. Petersburg Times, WFLA-TV in Florida reported the day of the incident in 1951 that Reeser’s body \"disintegrated\" because of a fire, but the apartment she was in did not have the kind of damage that a fire would produce.\n\nBay News 9 in Florida reported that the 67-year-old woman’s body was nearly cremated except for parts of her body.\n\nIn an FBI report obtained by WFLA-TV, the news outlet noted that the room Reeser was found in was a mystery because of the condition of the woman’s body and that the room was untouched but showed signs of extreme heat on the ceilings.\n\nIn 2010, Michael Faherty burned to death on his living room floor in Ireland from what the Irish Independent reported was spontaneous human combustion. The 76-year-old man’s case was one of the first reported cases in the country.\n\nThe first known case of spontaneous human combustion happened in the late 14th century in Italy, when a knight drank wine one night before bursting into flames, per Business Insider.\n\nWhat could cause spontaneous human combustion?\n\nSeveral things must occur for a human body to burn to ashes. The National Institutes of Health notes that the burn victim has to die for the body fat to begin melting. A tear in the skin must occur for the melted fat to soak the burned clothes, igniting an effect that produces heat for an extended period of time.\n\nThis story was reported from Washington, D.C."
