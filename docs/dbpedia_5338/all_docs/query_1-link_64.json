        "text": "What Channel Is Fox On DirecTV?\n\nYou can watch Fox on DirecTV on Channel 398 and Channel 399 throughout the country. Besides these two channels, there’s lowered numbered channels, where you can watch the great shows on Fox like Hell’s Kitchen or 911.\n\nLowered numbers are all over the place. In SF, Fox is on Channel 2 but it’s on Channel 69 in San Diego.\n\nWe researched the top 100 cities and zip codes in the US and found out where the lowered-numbered channels are so you have more time to watch your favorite shows.\n\nWant to save money on your TV bill?\n\nSwitching to Fubo could save you $200+ a year. The first month is free and you can cancel any time.\n\nCheck it out by clicking the link below.\n\nFox DIRECTV Channel Guide\n\nYou can find our guides for other broadcast channels on Directv like ABC, CBS, and NBC here.\n\nThere are other Fox channels like FS1 and Fox News on DIRECTV. We’ve figured out where those channels are in your area.\n\nMost Common Fox Directv Channels\n\nThe most common channels where Fox will be on DirecTV in the country are channels 2 and 5.\n\nChannel 2 is the right channel for Fox in San Francisco, Honolulu, Detroit, Brownsville, and St. Louis.\n\nIt’s interesting but KTVU is a special super affiliate for Fox in San Francisco.\n\nYou can go to Channel 5 to watch Fox in Washington DC, Atlanta, Las Vegas, and New York.\n\nThere are also two cities where Fox is available on two lowered-numbered channels – Louisville and Minneapolis.\n\nMinneapolis residents can watch on Channel 9 and 29 while those who reside in Louisville can watch on Channel 41 and Channel 59.\n\nHigh Numbered Channels\n\nAs a broadcast channel, Fox is usually one of the first channels on your TV guide.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s a number of big cities in the US where that’s not the case. This is a legacy of Fox starting in the 1990s as a disrupter to CBS and NBC.\n\nSome cities where this is the case include San Diego and Omaha. We put a fuller list of higher-numbered Fox channels below.\n\nSan Diego: 69\n\nBakersfield: 58\n\nCharlotte: 46\n\nBaltimore: 45\n\nNorfolk: 43\n\nOmaha: 42\n\nSacramento: 40\n\nFox On Directv (CA/TX/FL)\n\nWhile every part of America is special, we found that there is a high density of big cities in California, Texas, and Florida.\n\nThat’s where the majority of Directv customers live.\n\nFor the other broadcast channels, we could see patterns in which channels ABC or CBS were located in these big states.\n\nThat wasn’t the case for Fox. For example in Florida, Fox is on Channel 4 in Fort Worth but it’s on Channel 35 in Orlando.\n\nWe put the channel lists for DirecTV on Fox for CA, TX, and FL below.\n\nLower Your TV Bill With Fubo!\n\nWe hope our guide was useful. We work hard to make sure that fellow Americans get the best experience with their cable companies.\n\nIf you want to save money and get more channels, try out Fubo.\n\nThey have channels like NFL Network and GAC that aren’t in all DirecTV packages.\n\nClick the link below to get started."
