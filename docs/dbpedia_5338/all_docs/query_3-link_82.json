        "text": "SOUTH FULTON, Ga. - An Atlanta police officer has been charged in connection with an early morning shooting outside a bar in South Fulton.\n\nMelvin Potter was charged with obstruction and was booked into the Fulton County Jail.\n\nAccording to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Potter was leaving a bar in the 5000 block of Old National Highway around 1 a.m. on Monday. Investigators say he was walking someone to their car when he got into an argument with another group of people.\n\nThe argument escalated, and shots were fired, at least one of which struck 38-year-old Devon Anderson. Investigators say Potter fired those shots.\n\nAnderson was rushed to an area hospital, where he later died.\n\nAn autopsy was scheduled to be performed by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nInvestigators say more charges are possible pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nAccording to the Atlanta Police Department, Potter was relieved of duty after learning about the shooting.\n\nThe GBI is asking anyone with information about the case to call the GBI Regional Investigative Office in Atlanta at 770-388-5019 or anonymously by calling 1-800-597-TIPS (8477)."
