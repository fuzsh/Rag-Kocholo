        "text": "Rupert Murdoch's plan to takeover BSkyB looks set to go ahead, now that culture secretary Jeremy Hunt has OK'd News Corporation's plan to spin off Sky News.\n\nThe news subsidiary will be spun off into a new publicly listed company called Newco. That would then allow the proposed £8bn purchase of the 61% of BSkyB it does not already ownNews Corporation is to license the Sky News brand to the operation for seven years, providing an incentive to renew a second funding deal. buy up the rest of BSkyB - he presently controls 39.1% of the company which is increasingly dominating British broadcasting.\n\nEarlier this year, a memo signed by a coalition of British media companies, including the Guardian, asked then Business secretary Vince Cable to refer the proposed takeover to Ofcom. Cable later had to resign.\n\nSo, just how powerful would Murdoch become in the UK? According to a confidential report from respected media analyst Claire Enders to Vince Cable - subsequently leaked to media site BeehiveCity - it would substantially change the British media landscape.\n\nAs Dan Sabbagh writes on BeehiveCity:\n\nAllowing the deal to go through would amount to Britain's 'Berlusconi moment'\n\nYou can download the leaked report at the site and it includes tonnes of data and a damning final verdict on the proposed takeover.\n\nThe key points are, according to Enders:\n\nProducts currently separately offered by BSkyB and News Corp titles may be combined in bundles… Strategic initiatives of this nature could lead to a much more rapid decline in competitor newspaper circulations than we have assumed, boosting News Corp's newspaper market share above 40% by 2014…\n\n…Stories from Sky News (especially video) will presumably be carried more and more frequently on News Corp websites … Progressively, News International papers and BSkyB channels, particularly Sky News, may merge into one stream of fact and opinion. If this occurred, plurality would decline, even if the combined organisation continued to maintain newsrooms that are nominally separate…\n\n…The loss of the independent BSkyB shareholders will allow News Corp greater opportunity to influence, tacitly or otherwise, the editorial coverage of Sky News and other BSkyB channels…\n\nThe final point is perhaps the most serious:\n\nWe believe … that there is a risk of a reduction in media plurality to an unacceptably low level\n\nWe've extracted the key data from the report for you below - plus a list (probably not exhaustive) of News Corporations' operations, from the group's website.
