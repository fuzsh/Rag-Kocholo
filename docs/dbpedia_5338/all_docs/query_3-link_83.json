        "text": "So, now we’re here…\n\nFourteen survivors from the first field of 405 have made it to the Georgia Dome for the GHSA Championships on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThere are some interesting story lines; the opportunities for some firsts along the way if one team wins one of the seven games at the end of the year… some teams can reclaim their place as a champ that haven’t had the chance in a while…\n\nExample: Mays in 5A, coached by Corey Jarvis. Their win over Stockbridge means Mays became the first city of Atlanta school to make the state finals since Brown in 1991. The last Atlanta public school to win a title was Southwest in 1973. Mays can win its first state title.\n\nHere’s how the Atlanta teams fared in the semi-finals with Friend of GPB, Ace…\n\nIn 6A, Colquitt is looking to finish the season winning Game 15 under Rush Propst, putting the pedal down after trailing McEachern early at Mack Tharpe. Jake also gives us a look at GAC-Fitzgerald, Benedictine-Brooks, Commerce-Irwin.\n\n((HT: WALB-TV))\n\nWALB.com, Albany News, Weather, Sports\n\nIn triple-a, Washington County won the coin toss and got to host Blessed Trinity to try and secure another trip to the Dome. But they had to get past the Titans to do it.\n\nBig Marvin got back into the studio in time to tell the story.\n\n((HT: 13WMAZ-TV))\n\nAnd in single-a, two heavyweights went at it with Mt. Paran Christian trying to stop the 27-game Aquinas win streak for a bid in the private side finals. Kevin Faigle has the look at that game and Washington County’s win over BT as well.\n\n((HT: WRDW-TV))"
