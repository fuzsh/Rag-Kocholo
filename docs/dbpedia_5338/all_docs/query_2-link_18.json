        "text": "One day, Atlanta Falcons fans will know peace! But at the moment, the Falcons’ vibes heading into the 2024 NFL season are predictably unpredictable. Between breaking in a new coach and starting quarterback with Raheem Morris and $100-million-dollar-man Kirk Cousins, the Falcons’ record next season is anyone’s guess.\n\nCan Kirk Cousins be the missing piece for a Falcons offense that’s long underperformed despite being stacked with talent? How long will it take until everyone gets sick of Michael Penix Jr. in-season speculation? Here’s what you need to know to watch the 2024–2025 Atlanta Falcons.\n\nIf you have a cable or streaming TV subscription, you’ll be able to watch most Falcons games, but the number of games you’ll get depends on your location because of the NFL’s TV blackout policies.\n\nWant to watch Atlanta Falcons games for free next season? The Mohu Leaf 50 is an over-the-air (OTA) antenna that can pick up broadcast networks like CBS and FOX for free.
