        "text": "5 P.M. UPDATE: Debby, still a tropical storm, continues its slow trek away from the Georgia coast. As of 5 p.m., the storm's center was about 120 miles east-east of Savannah, or about 50 miles southeast of Charleston. It was north-northeast at 3 mph.\n\nWhile the storm is moving on, the outer bands of rain continue to move through the Savannah area, adding to an already flooded city. It rained so much that Bullock County officials are warning a dam near Statesboro could soon fail. Several nearby homes are already flooded.\n\nCypress Lake has swelled after Debby dumped several inches of rain.\n\n\"It's ruined My house. It’s ruined. Everybody's house through here,\" said resident Nelson Burnsed, whose home was flooded.\n\nBurnsed has lived here for about three decades. He says he only had time to get his dogs and the essentials. He’s preparing to lose everything.\n\n\"They say, my house is fixing to topple over and go and go into the crate and nobody can stop it,\" Burnsed said.\n\nThose who live here say the excessive rainfall filled up multiple lakes upstream and caused dams to breach. All the water came rushing into Cypress Lake and now the National Weather Service is warning the dam here is in imminent danger of failing.\n\n\"We've seen this on hurricanes or New Orleans floods, but I myself would never thought that we would be involved in it,\" said resident Jackie Rushing.\n\nWith dozens of homes underwater, people in this community just want to know when the flooding will recede.\n\n\"It's a bad situation, I hope law with them, and I hope the Lord with us too. And you just pray for us 'cause we're not going through a good time,\" said Burnsed.\n\n12 P.M. UPDATE: In Savannah, the water levels have remained consistent, but there's a significant development. Roads in the area, including Plymouth Avenue, are still covered with water, according to FOX 5 Atlanta meteorologist Alex Forbes. However, the water has receded enough for cars to pass through.\n\nThe water is not stagnant, but is flowing towards US 80, entering the storm drain system, and eventually making its way to the Savannah River. FOX 5 Atlanta observed a nearby U-Haul facility with many submerged boxes in the parking lot. According to the manager, most of these boxes are empty, so personal belongings are not at risk. However, the building managers have yet to inspect the inside for any water damage.\n\nSchools in Chatham County are closed today. The rain is moving north, and the sun is starting to emerge, providing hope that the water will soon drain out to the ocean.\n\n5 A.M. UPDATE: After nearly two days of rain, parts of South Georgia are bracing for ever more water as the storm continues its path offshore.\n\nThe storm is now about 90 miles east of Savannah and 65 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nWith reservoirs and storm drains at nearly max capacity and the ground saturated, flooding is a serious threat.\n\nClose to a foot fell down-coast from Charleston to Savannah, where the National Weather Service reported 6.68 inches just on Monday. That’s already a month’s worth in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches.\n\nSavannah resident Michael Jones said water gushed into his home Monday evening, overturning the refrigerator and causing furniture to float. Outside, the water seemed to be everywhere and was too deep to flee safely. So Jones spent a sleepless night on his kitchen table before firefighters going door to door came in a boat Tuesday morning.\n\n\"It was hell all night,\" Jones said.\n\nAlthough most of the storm was gone from Georgia, officials are warning of more dangerous weather and flooding to come.\n\n\"Do not let this storm lull you to sleep,\" Gov. Brian Kemp said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n11 P.M. UPDATE: Despite moving offshore, the rain continued to downpour in Savannah through the night. Some streets are already underwater.\n\n\"It was the first time I had ever seen anything like this,\" resident Shanell Miles said.\n\nWhile Miles said Debby didn't come as a shock, the flooding it brought just outside her home was completely unexpected.\n\n\"When I woke up this morning it was flooded very, very bad,\" she explained. \"It’s something I thought that I would never see in my life because you normally see it on pictures.\"\n\n\"This is exactly what we were concerned about with this storm, which was a large amount of rainwater in a few hours,\" said City Manager Jay Melder. \"And we see that the street is flooding, and we see a little bit of structural flooding here in the neighborhood.\"\n\nWhile crews spent hours Tuesday afternoon working to clear pipes to help drain the water, Miles said she's just thankful the water stopped rising before it could seep into her home.\n\n\"I'm very thankful and I thank the Lord,\" she said.\n\n4:45 P.M. UPDATE: Tropical Storm Debby is officially back over open water, about 10 miles east of Savannah, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest public advisory.\n\nThe storm surge warning from Savannah River to South Santee River in South Carolina has been discontinued. A Tropical Storm Warning is now in effect for the Altamaha Sound.\n\n12 P.M. UPDATE: At noon on Tuesday, Savannah was in the center of the storm. The rain and wind have stopped temporarily, but are expected to pick up again. The storm is moving very slowly at this time and is crawling to the east and northeast at about 6 miles per hour.\n\nThe center is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, according to meteorologists. It will drift offshore for a while before it moves inland again over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nHistoric flooding in parts of Georgia and South Carolina continue to be a major concern.\n\nIn Pierce County's Blackshear, the rain and wind picked back up again after a relatively dry morning. Isolated areas of flooding also started to appear. This area, which was hit hard by Hurricane Idalia last year, is experiencing milder conditions this time around, according to residents. Still, it's not easy getting around.\n\n\"It's hurting me. I do land surveying, and it's been pretty rough right here this week. I'm probably not going to be able to work,\" said Blackshear resident Stephen Duncan.\n\nIn Lowndes County, particularly the Valdosta area, around 24,000 customers are currently without power. Crews are actively working to restore electricity. The city manager of Waycross reported minimal flooding issues, attributing the improvement to the clearing of canals and installation of larger pipes after last year’s storm.\n\n\"This is becoming our new normal with storms unfortunately,\" Waycross City Manager Ulysses Rayford said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp addressed residents in the affected areas during a press conference on Tuesday morning, emphasizing that the danger is not yet over, with a second round of severe weather expected.\n\nThe governor stressed that the Southeast region is currently experiencing a brief respite after the first wave of heavy rain and strong winds. However, Tropical Storm Debby is predicted to return, bringing 4 to 8 inches of rain and potential severe flooding along the coast.\n\nApproximately 47,000 residents were without power, and ports in Brunswick, Savannah, and Charleston remain closed, according to Kemp. The governor also said the Georgia National Guard has deployed 300 soldiers and airmen to provide support as needed.\n\nOfficials urge South Georgia residents to stay off the roads to allow emergency responders, GDOT, and utility crews to address storm-related incidents effectively. The emphasis is on enabling crews to clear roads and perform necessary search and rescue operations before the storm's anticipated return.\n\nUnfortunately, Georgia officials have confirmed one death due to the storm.\n\nDuring the current lull, power crews are working diligently to restore electricity to as many residents as possible before the next round of storms hits.\n\nFULL PRESS CONFERENCE BELOW\n\nEARLIER TUESDAY: Debby continues to cut through north Florida and south Georgia on Tuesday morning. The storm is expected to cause historic, if not catastrophic, flooding along Georgia's coast with 20 to 30 inches of rain possible.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Tuesday, sustained winds continued to be at 45 mph as it continued to trek northeast at 6 mph. Debby's pace slowed slightly, with the center of the storm located about 30 miles southwest of Savannah.\n\nA major flood threat will remain in place for parts of Georgia and the Carolinas for the next few days.\n\nThe storm is responsible for at least four deaths in Florida and at least one death in Georgia.\n\nGet location-based weather alerts on your mobile device by downloading the FOX 5 weather app and allowing notifications.\n\nBiden approves Georgia emergency declaration\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved an emergency declaration for South and Coastal Georgia due to the threat Debby poses.\n\nThe action, taken late Monday night, allows for federal assistance to supplement the state and local response efforts and speeds the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nAs part of Biden's action, the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA are coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nBiden has already approved similar requests from South Carolina and Florida's governors.\n\nSavannah area under curfew ahead of Debby\n\nChatham County, which is the greater Savannah area, issued a curfew starting at 10 p.m. on Monday evening through 6 a.m. on Tuesday. On Monday afternoon, the Savannah waterfront was nearly empty as rain began to pound the area.\n\n\"It was raining kind of hard this morning and then lightened up a little bit, but it's picking back up right now so we’re feeling it,\" said Madi Blackford, who is visiting Savannah from Ohio.\n\nAuthorities are warning people to expect flooding in areas which do not normally see it.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, Savannah's mayor told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\n\"This is a once in a thousand-year potential rainfall event. And we have to be mindful of that,\" said Savannah City Manager Jay Melder.\n\n\"This is nothing to play with if you don’t have to be on the street, don’t be on the street,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I'm prepared. I already brought all the stuff that I had on my balcony, inside, you know, my plans and my beach chairs and my table. And I already have my light, and my fridge stuck up. Hopefully the power doesn't go out,\" said Savannah resident Juan Edenhofer.\n\nPHOTOS: Severe flooding in Florida after Debby makes landfall\n\nSome residents spent the day filling sandbanks in a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area is already saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: VP Kamala Harris cancels trip to Savannah on Friday\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\n\"We could see a stall or a meandering motion around coastal portions of the southeastern United States,\" National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a Saturday briefing. \"So that’s going to exacerbate not just the rainfall risk, but also the potential for storm surge and some strong winds.\"\n\nNearby Jekyll Island has declared its own state of emergency through at least late Thursday evening. Government buildings and non-essential services will be shutting down as Monday afternoon.\n\nSavannah mayor says parts of city may end up underwater\n\nFOX 5 Atlanta spoke to Savannah Mayor Van Johnson who was very frank about the severity of the anticipated storm Monday night.\n\n\"We plan for a once-in-a-century storm,\" he admitted. \"We don't plan for a once-in-a-millennial-type of storm, and that's where we are right now.\"\n\nThe mayor said residents should mainly be concerned about all the rain and the flooding Debby is expected to bring to the low country. He said at least a foot of rain could be expected in most areas.\n\n\"What people enjoy about this area is, right now, what's making it very hazardous for us,\" he said, referring to Savannah's proximity to the water and the unique lifestyle it's able to provide. \"It's a dangerous time. It's a dangerous space.\"\n\nOfficials say the worst of the storm in Savannah will arrive at around 11 p.m. on Monday. School will be canceled in Chatham County through Wednesday.\n\nTybee Island braces for Debby\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So, we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nSouth Georgia closed down as Debby blows through\n\nA 19-year-old man has died after a tree fell on his home in Moultrie around 3 p.m. on Monday, according to the Colquitt County coroner. Emergency management officials say Justin Cox was the only person home at the time. Moultrie is about 185 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nAbout 35 miles southeast of there, residents in Valdosta spent Monday afternoon bracing as Debby brought winds, toppling trees, and heavy rains causing flooding.\n\nMany of the businesses in downtown Valdosta were closed and residents were left in the dark with thousands of power outages reported.\n\nNavigating the roadways was also difficult. Traffic lights were out along with the power and debris, such as trees, limbs and other loose objects were blowing into the streets.\n\nEmergency management officials said there haven't been reports of major issues, at least not to the extent seen during Hurricane Idalia almost a year ago. Officials said people have been taking this one seriously.\n\n\"There's a lot of, you know, storm trauma and PTSD from a year ago. And then we had two storms with straight line winds that caused more damage to existing houses. There's still houses with tarps and repair. Many people just got their houses back livable. And then we're concerned with that. We did. I feel like this storm very serious,\" said Michael Smith, CEO of Greater Valdosta United Way.\n\nCrews have been actively working to remove as much debris as possible so crews can begin to restore power.\n\nMeanwhile, officials are setting their sights on the Withlacoochee River, where it is expected to reach moderate flood stage overnight.\n\nThe Red Cross does have a shelter open at Park Avenue Church with about thirty people or so taking shelter there as of Monday afternoon.\n\nDebby forces flight cancelations\n\nTravelers flying out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to any areas impacted by the storm over the next couple of days should check their flights before heading to the airport.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nGeorgia Power ‘all hands on deck’ for Debby\n\nAs of 5 a.m., Georgia Power reported more than 10,000 outages and the Georgia Electrical Cooperatives more than 30,000. Most of the outages were in the southern portion of the state.\n\nThe Georgia Power Storm Center at its Atlanta headquarters was filled and buzzing with activity on Monday. The command post is being manned round the clock as officials brace for Debby's impact in South Georgia.\n\n\"We start tracking a storm, days sometimes weeks in advance, to make sure we have all the equipment, the resources that we need,\" said Georgia Power spokesperson Amanda Arnold.\n\nSEE ALSO: Generators and CO poisoning: A Cherokee County couple’s warning\n\nStorm Center Manager Jason Stott and others here monitor the situation in real time to ensure Georgia Power crews and partners in neighboring states are in place, and ready to respond to potential damage and power outages once Hurricane Debby moves through Georgia.\n\n\"Coordinating the statewide response, engaging with our local leadership teams, crews that are already out in the field working, those crews that we had pre-staged to respond immediately,\" said Stott.\n\nKemp issues ‘state of emergency’ for Georgia\n\nGov. Brian Kemp has authorized thousands of members of the Georgia National Guard to prepare for possible deployment in the southern part of the state as Tropical Storm Debby continues its path across Florida.\n\nKemp signed the new executive order on Monday morning, less than three hours after the storm made landfall.\n\nIn the order, Kemp authorized the Georgia Department of Defense to prepare up to 2,000 troops to be used in the preparation, response, and recovery efforts.\n\nThis order came after Kemp declared a State of Emergency over the storm.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, there is a high risk of flash flooding over southeast central Georgia on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe State Operations Center began working at full capacity at 7 a.m. on Aug. 4 as Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) monitored the storm.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation has equipment loaded and immediate-response strike teams and other crew members on alert statewide to respond to massive flooding and other storm damage.\n\n\"We could see damage to transportation infrastructure,\" said GDOT spokesperson Scott Higley. \"Heavy rainfall can mean washed out roadways and all sorts of problems.\"\n\nLike many Georgia agencies, GDOT is paying close attention to the storm.\n\n\"What we’ve seen are some downed trees, some debris on the roadways,\" said Higley.\n\nWorkers have been on the ground preparing since last week.\n\n\"Clearing out storm drains, making sure we have the ability to clear away that heavy rainfall.\" Higley said. \"They’re cleaning up debris as they can that’s being produced by the higher winds of the storm.\"\n\nThe biggest concerns are flooding.\n\n\"This will be a prolonged storm front,\" Higley said. \"Which, of course, creates tremendous problems in terms of rainfall amounts.\"\n\nThat could lead to washed out roads and other unforeseen problems.\n\n\"We could see damage to transportation infrastructure.\" said GDOT spokesperson Scott Higley. \"Heavy rainfalls can mean washed out roadways and all sorts of problems.\"\n\nVolunteers ready to assist in Debby recovery efforts\n\nMeanwhile, the volunteers with the Southern Baptist Convention's disaster-relief teams are gearing up and getting their equipment ready.\n\n\"We can have wind damage, but if it’s a lot of water, then our main concern is flooding,\" said Lee Hurtt, who directs the relief effort.\n\nArmed with power tools, sprayers, and more, the teams plan to rolls out of Noon Day Baptist Church to south Georgia to help where they can with picking up the pieces and helping those in need, all free of charge.\n\n\"Remove any damaged part of the building, carpet, floor, that kind of thing,\" said Hurtt.\n\n\"We’re glad to provide service, but we’re sorry they’ve been personally impacted,\" said Hurtt. \"Some are just so devastated that it’s really, really tough on our hearts.\"\n\nIt is all to ease the pain of people who may be suffering through the worst day of their lives.\n\n\"We’re glad to provide service, but we’re sorry they’ve been personally impacted,\" said Hurtt. \"Some are just so devastated that it’s really, really tough on our hearts.\"\n\nThe American Red Cross also ready to respond where needed. The humanitarian organization began moving dozens of staff, volunteers, supplies and other resources to the area more than a week ago.\n\n\"Right now, we have over 140 people at or deploying to the coast of Georgia,\" said Suzane Lawler, regional communications manager for the American Red Cross.\n\n\"I would encourage people, if there is an evacuation notice, that flooding is going to be prevalent in your area and local authorities say you need to get out, get out,\" Lawler added.\n\nFlorida flooding as Debby moves through\n\nFernandina Beach, Florida, located just north of Jacksonville, was already experiencing significant wind and rain from Tropical Storm Debby as of noon on Monday. This weather pattern will intensify across south Georgia, affecting cities from Valdosta to Waycross.\n\nIt is predicted to approach Savannah by early Tuesday with winds of 45 mph and will continue toward Charleston by Tuesday evening. Despite its slow movement from Savannah to Charleston within 24 hours, the storm is expected to turn westward before moving north toward Raleigh and Richmond as the weekend approaches, likely downgrading to a tropical depression.\n\nSEE ALSO: Catfish appear on flooded streets in Pinellas Park\n\nThis slow-moving system will result in substantial rainfall along the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines, potentially leading to severe flooding.\n\nIn Jacksonville Beach, the winds were strong. Heavy rains are being reported with winds at 39 mph out of the south.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents in the Big Bend area of Florida. There have been no reports of deaths there, but there have been reports of deaths elsewhere in the state.\n\nSEE ALSO: Debby blamed for four deaths in Florida; storm continues to impact northern part of state\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nDebby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.\n\nFor more weather coverage and the latest local forecast, visit the FOX 5 weather page.\n\nFlood safety tips\n\nDON'T drive or walk through standing water\n\nDON'T drive around barricades\n\nDO stay away from downed power lines\n\nDO prepare your cellar or basement to hold yourself or your family in case you need to seek underground protection\n\nDO find a windowless, interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible in case underground shelter is not available to you\n\nDO develop and communicate a plan, especially if you have children/older loved ones/pets, so that everyone is aware of what to do and where to go in the case of an emergency\n\nDO build a kit filled with emergency items such as water, non-perishable food, flashlights, batteries etc.\n\nLearn more"
