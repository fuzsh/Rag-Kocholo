On Tuesday, the AJC reported, that Atlanta United are working on a deal to televise or stream all Atlanta United games. It hasn't been made clear whether Eales is looking for a local or regional deal. Though he did claim there was "lots of local interest" in broadcasting Atlanta United games.

"Now it's time to work out the best one for MLS, Atlanta United, and the local market," he went on to say.

A local partnership would mean a station like WSB (Atlanta's ABC affiliate), WAGA (FOX), or WXIA (NBC) would televise games. However, the club would be missing out on a wider audience if they chose a local partnership over a regional. The Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Braves games are televised on Fox Sports South or Southeast and reach viewers all over the region. The Atlanta Hawks averaged above 2.2 million viewers for the 2014-15 regular season for instance.

All MLS teams are required to air all games so they can be streamed to MLS Live, the league's online streaming service.

The current MLS league wide partnership includes nationally televising three games per weekend. Friday night on Unimas/Univison, and Sundays on ESPN and FOX Sports. Some Atlanta United games will likely be televised nationally but most will not.
