A stylist with a wide range of strokes, CD Gopinath's Test record was not in keeping with his reputation as one of the leading run scorers in first-class cricket. He made an impressive debut when, in his first Test against England in 1951-52, he scored 50 not out and 42. The first was a classy knock full of flowing strokes while the second was a fighting effort, scored when Indian wickets were falling fast. Again in the final Test at Madras he did well scoring 35 and helping Polly Umrigar add 93 runs for the seventh wicket. Thereafter he was more out-of than in the team, predominently because of a poor tour of England in 1952. He fared much better in Pakistan in 1954-55, averaging 58.33 in all first class games. Brought back against Australia at Calcutta in 1959-60, he was top-scorer with 39 in the first innings. But that was his swan song.

In the Ranji Trophy however Gopinath remained a heavy scorer, finishing with 2349 runs (51.06) with a highest score of 234 against Mysore in 1958-59. One of his finest innings was 175 for South Zone against the visiting New Zealanders in 1955-56. He captained Madras for several years. He had a comparatively short first-class career due to business commitments but in the seventies re-emerged as chairman of the national selection committee and in 1979 he managed the Indian team which toured England.
