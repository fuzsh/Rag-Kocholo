        "text": "Well, as promised I am back with the part 2 of the Bhutan post (those who have not read my last post, please do that before you start reading this). Last post ended with the question regarding how Bhutan is sustaining itself so well inspite of having so many visitors annually. Well, the answer lies in a simple but visionary tourism policy: a) Every tourist has to shell out Rs. 1200 per person per night of stay as SDF (Sustainable Development Fee) b) Mandatory stays at not less than three-star accommodations and use of only SUVs for sightseeing, irrespective of the number of tourists. c) It is mandatory to hire both - a Guide and a driver throughout the trip. No entry to monuments without guide. d) Monument entry fee is kept very steep, at Rs.300- Rs.1000 per person. e) No outside cars are allowed, only local cars to be hired.Same applies to drivers- its mandatory to hire local drivers only. In essence, Bhutan's tourism policy prioritizes quality over quantity of tourists, it ensures that only a particular segment of tourists visit Bhutan to preserve its cultural identity. It doesn't encourage any visitors who pose threat to its sustainability, not even at cost of lucrative monetary incentives. Its evident that inspite of 70% of tourists being Indians, there is still no presence of a McD or Starbucks or even a ICICI or HDFC bank - only local banks are functional.In airlines too, only 2 local airlines (DrukAir and Tashi Air) ply on their runways. No foreign Debit/ Credit Card work- it's a cash economy for tourists. Bhutan is a proud self sufficient economy prioritizing local resources, so foreign companies can't convince it of boosting the economy with their presence. To cater to its culturally diverse tourists alongwith balancing its Buddhism philosophy, its amazing to know there is not a single slaughter house in entire Bhutan. Non-veg food, especially Chicken and Mutton are easily available, but meat are being 100% imported.Women empowerment can be seen practically everywhere. Nearly 50% of tourist drivers and Tour guides were women (including our driver).Recently, Bhutan government has allowed tourists to buy Duty- free Gold resulting in gold prices being much cheaper than India. This masterstroke ensures more Indian tourists every year, hence more Tourism fund collection driving the overall economy towards self sufficiency. We can argue that the population (entire Bhutan's population is less than our Thane region) undoubtedly is a key factor contributing towards its sustainability, still its not a rocket science and there is absolutely no doubt why India can't emulate this policy. A simple stringent penalty system on spitting, littering, honking and wasting food can do wonders.Lets hope for a change.Till then Be happy, Be content.
