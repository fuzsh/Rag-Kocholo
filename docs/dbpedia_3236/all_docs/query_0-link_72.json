It began on January 1, 2001 and will end on December 31, 2100. It is the first century of the 3rd millennium.\n\nThe rise of a global economy and Third World consumerism marked the beginning of the century, along with increased private enterprise and deepening concern over terrorism after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.[1][2][3] The NATO intervention in Afghanistan and the United States-led coalition intervention in Iraq in the early 2000s, as well as the overthrow of several regimes during the Arab Spring in the early 2010s, led to mixed outcomes in the Arab world, resulting in several civil wars and political instability.[4] In February 2022, Russia conducted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has since became the largest conventional military offensive in Europe since World War II, resulting in a refugee crisis and disruptions to global trade. Since October 2023, the Israel–Hamas War is an armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups, which has been taking place chiefly in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel. The United States has remained the sole global superpower, while China is now considered to be an emerging superpower.\n\nIn 2022, 45% of the world's population lived in \"some form of democracy\", although only 8% lived in \"full democracies\".[5] The United Nations estimates that by 2050, two thirds of the world's population will be urbanized.\n\nThe world economy expanded at high rates from $42 trillion in 2000 to $101 trillion in 2022, and though many economies rose at greater levels, some gradually contracted.[a] The European Union greatly expanded in the 21st century, adding 13 member states, but the United Kingdom withdrew. Most EU member states introduced a common currency, the Euro. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), also greatly expanded, adding 13 member states.\n\nEffects of global warming and rising sea levels exacerbated the ecological crises, with eight islands disappearing between 2007 and 2014.[6][7][8]\n\nGlobally, from January 2020 to May 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic began to rapidly spread worldwide, causing more than 7 million reported deaths,[9] and around 18.2 to 33.5 million estimated deaths,[10] while at the same time, causing severe global economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression in 1930s.[11] COVID-19 vaccines were widely deployed in various countries beginning in December 2020. Widespread supply shortages, including food shortages, were caused by supply chain disruptions and panic buying. Reduced human activity led to an unprecedented temporary decrease in pollution. Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed in many jurisdictions, and many events were cancelled or postponed during 2020 and 2021. Telework became much more common for white-collar workers as the pandemic evolved. Misinformation circulated through social and mass medias, and political tensions intensified.[12]\n\nDue to the sudden proliferation of internet-accessible mobile devices, such as smartphones becoming ubiquitous worldwide beginning in the early 2010s, more than two thirds of the world's population obtained access to the Internet by 2023.[13] After the success of the Human Genome Project, DNA sequencing services became available and affordable.[14][15] There were significant improvements in the complexity of artificial intelligence, with American companies, universities, and research labs pioneering advances in the field.[16] Generative AI-based applications such as ChatGPT and DALL-E have accumulated billions of users, and allow users to instantly generate complex texts, images, art, and video, comparable to the sophistication of human work.[17] Research into outer space greatly accelerated in the 2020s, with the United States mainly dominating space exploration, including the James Webb Space Telescope, Ingenuity helicopter, Lunar Gateway, and Artemis program.[18][19]\n\nPronunciation\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a lack of general agreement over how to pronounce specific years of the 21st century in English. Academics have pointed out that the early years of previous centuries were commonly pronounced as, for example, \"eighteen oh five\" (for 1805) and \"nineteen oh five\" (for 1905).[20] Generally, the early years of the 21st century were pronounced as in \"two-thousand (and) five,\" with a change taking place around 2010, when pronunciations often shifted between the early-years form of \"two-thousand and ten\" and the traditionally more concise form of \"twenty-ten.\"\n\nThe Vancouver Olympics, which took place in 2010, was being officially referred to by Vancouver 2010 as \"the twenty-ten Olympics\".[further explanation needed]\n\nSociety\n\n[edit]\n\nAdvances in technology such as ultrasound, prenatal genetic testing and genetic engineering have modified demographics[clarification needed], changing the genetic makeup of the human population. Because of sex-selective abortion, fewer girls have been born in the 21st century (and since the early 1980s) compared to past centuries, mostly because of son preference in East and South Asia. In 2014, only 47 percent of Indian births were of girls.[21] This has led to an increase in bachelors in countries such as China and India. The first genetically modified children were born November 2018 in China to significant controversy, beginning a new biological era for the human species.\n\nAnxiety[22] and depression[23] rates have risen in the United States and many other parts of the world. However, suicide rates have fallen in Europe and most of the rest of the world so far this century, declining 29% globally between 2000 and 2018, despite rising 18% in the United States in the same period. The decline in suicide has been most notable among Chinese and Indian women, the elderly, and middle-aged Russian men.[24][25]\n\nKnowledge and information\n\n[edit]\n\nThe entire written works of humanity, from the beginning of recorded history to 2003, in all known languages, are estimated to amount to five exabytes of data.[26][27] Since 2003, with the beginning of social media and \"user-generated content\", the same amount of data is created every two days.[28] The growth of human knowledge and information continues at an exponential rate.[further explanation needed]\n\nTelecommunications in the early 21st century are much more advanced and universal than they were in the late 20th century. Only a few percent of the world's population were Internet users and cellular phone owners in the late 1990s; as of 2023, 67% of the world's population is online,[13] and as of 2019, an estimated 67% own a cell phone.[29] In the 2010s, artificial intelligence, mainly in the form of deep learning and machine learning, became more prevalent and is prominently used in Gmail and Google's search engine, in banking, with the military and other areas. As of 2022, 8.6% of the world's population still lacked access to electricity.[30]\n\nIn 2001, Dennis Tito became the first space tourist, beginning the era of commercial spaceflight. Entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Richard Branson are working towards commercial space exploration, colonization and tourism, while China and India have made substantial strides in their space programs. On 3 January 2019, China landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first to do so.[31]\n\nCulture and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: International relations since 1989\n\nWar and violence have declined considerably compared to the 20th century, continuing the post-World War II trend called Long Peace. Malnourishment and poverty are still widespread globally, but fewer people live in the most extreme forms of poverty. In 1990, approximately one-in-four people were malnourished, and nearly 36% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty; by 2015, these numbers had dropped to approximately one-in-eight and 10%, respectively.[citation needed]\n\nThe Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal drew international attention to the possible adverse effects of social media in influencing citizen's views, particularly regarding the 2016 United States presidential election.[further explanation needed]\n\nConcepts such as eco-friendly lifestyles, recycling, and upcycling are having a profound impact on daily lives. Sustainable fashion, architecture, and food culture are all important elements that will facilitate the development of an environmentally conscious culture well into the future.[citation needed]\n\nPopulation and urbanization\n\n[edit]\n\nThe world population was about 6.1 billion at the start of the 21st century and reached 8 billion by November 2022. It is estimated to reach nearly 8.6 billion by 2030,[32] and 9.8 billion by 2050. According to the United Nations World Urbanization prospects, 60% of the world's human population are projected to live in megacities and megalopolises by 2030, 70% by 2050, and 90% by 2080.[33]\n\nLife expectancy has increased as child mortality continues to decline. A baby born in 2019, for example, will, on average (globally), live to 73 years—27 years longer than the global average of someone born in 1950.[34] Ten million Britons (16% of the United Kingdom population) will, on average, live to 100 or older.[35]\n\nClimate change remains a serious concern; UN Chief António Guterres, for instance, has described it as an \"existential threat\" to humanity.[36] Furthermore, the Holocene extinction event, the sixth most significant extinction event in the Earth's history, continues with the widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats as a by-product of human activity.[37]\n\nEconomics, education and retirement\n\n[edit]\n\nEconomically and politically, the United States and Western Europe were dominant at the beginning of the century; by the 2010s, China became an emerging global superpower and, by some measures, the world's largest economy. In terms of purchasing power parity, India's economy became more significant than Japan's around 2011.[38]\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies that are not controlled by any central bank. These currencies are increasing in popularity worldwide due to the expanding availability of the internet and are mainly used as a store of value.\n\nThere is an ongoing impact of technological unemployment due to automation and computerization: the rate at which jobs are disappearing—due to machines replacing them—is expected to escalate.[39] Automation alters the number of jobs and the skills demands of industries. As of 2019, the production output of first world nations' manufacturing sectors was doubled when compared to 1984 output; but it is now produced with one-third fewer workers and at significantly reduced operating costs.[40] Half of all jobs with requirements lower than a bachelor's degree are currently in the process of being replaced with partial- or full-automation.[41]\n\nThe World Economic Forum forecast that 65% of children entering primary school will end up in jobs or careers that currently do not yet exist.[42]\n\nA rise in the retirement age has been called for in view of an increase in life expectancy and has been put in place in many jurisdictions.[43][44]\n\nLinguistic diversity\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2009, Ethnologue catalogued 6,909 living human languages.[45] The exact number of known living languages will vary from 5,000 to 10,000, generally depending on the precision of one's definition of \"language\", and in particular, on how one classifies dialects.\n\nEstimates vary depending on many factors, but the general consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages currently spoken. Between 50% and 90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.[46]\n\nThe top 20 languages spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population. In contrast, many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with fewer than 10,000 speakers.[46]\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the 21st century.\n\n1998–2003 – The Second Congo War continued into the early 21st century. A 1999 ceasefire quickly broke down and a UN peacekeeping mission, MONUC, was unable to control the fighting. Troops from Rwanda and Uganda continued to support rebel groups against the Democratic Republic of the Congo and rifts also grew between Rwanda and Uganda as they accused each other of supporting rival rebel groups as well. Laurent Kabila, president of the DRC, was assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph Kabila, took power. Throughout 2002 steps were made towards peace and Rwanda and Uganda both removed their troops from the country. On December 17, 2002, a massive treaty officially ended the war. However, the DRC only holds power in less than half of the country, with most of the eastern and northern portions still controlled by rebel groups, where there is still significant infighting. In addition, Rwanda still supports anti-DRC rebels and anti-Rwandan rebels continue to operate from the DRC. The war killed an estimated 3.9 million people, displaced nearly 5.5 million, and led to a widespread and ongoing famine that continues to result in deaths. Severe human rights violations continue to be reported.[47]\n\n2000–2005 – The Second Intifada, a major Palestinian uprising against Israel, is estimated to have led to the deaths of approximately 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis.[citation needed]\n\n2001\n\n[edit]\n\nJanuary 20:\n\nGeorge W.

In 2005, the ICC decided that Darfur war criminals would be tried, and on July 14, 2008, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir was charged with 5 accounts of crimes against humanity and 2 accounts of war crimes, even though the ICC had no power to enforce such charges. The war ends following a peace agreement on August 31 2020.\n\n2003–2010 – The U.S.-led coalition invades Iraq on March 20, 2003, and overthrows the government of Saddam Hussein (who is executed by the Iraqi government on December 30, 2006). Coalition troops remain in the country to install a democratic government and fight an escalating insurgency. In addition to an insurgency against the American presence, Iraq also suffered from a civil war for several years. The war was soon seen as the central front of the War on Terror by many governments, despite growing international dissatisfaction with the war. The total death toll has been estimated at near 150,000 but these estimations are highly disputed, with one highly disputed study guessing even over 1 million.[65] After the U.S.-led coalition initiated a troop surge in 2007, casualty numbers have decreased significantly.
