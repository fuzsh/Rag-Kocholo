        "text": "For the past 2-3 days, I was preparing to write a year end LinkedIn post and was hit by the #writersblock. For me and SS Consulting Kochi, the year has been eventful and learning enabling - so there are many areas which I wanted to touch, hence the confusion. To make matters worse, the month also marks completion of 16 yrs of moving to a Tier 2 City in India to pursue my #lifepath and the last 9 years off a monthly #salary but enabling salaried roles in #IT and Non-IT #smebusiness, by established as well as first timer run businesses. So when I saw this video today from Firstpost, it took me back to the days in 2007-08. Then, it was the global #financialcrisis led meltdown that was affecting the IT Industry. It's interesting to see the similarity with 2023. Looking back, I recollect speaking with #optimism about IT industry at a panel discussion (one of the first ones I was invited for) organised by the Rajagiri Centre for Business Studies - calling upon the #depth focussed #Talent to stay tuned to opportunities that existed amidst all crisis. I then had the mandate to hire about 100 people that year so could make myself heard. Yes, within 2-3 yrs, Shilen Sagunan led #ArbitronIndia to hire over 200 people and build up a #WorkCulture, which Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode professors helped us to describe as #ResponsibleFreedom. Here is a video which we had made over 13 yrs ago to attract #talent to that #Startup journey, much before startup became viral as a term - https://lnkd.in/gGt4NE4h It's with the same optimism that I'm looking ahead to 2024 and beyond. Yes, the times are tough, like it was in 2008-2014. But those times also brought with it a different level of depth based exposure to #humancapital and #humancentric design possibilities. I'm too small to give advice but here are the things that keep helping me in such journeys: 1. Steer clear of PR stuff and popularity seeking personalities - they are usually the #lowhangingfruits, easy to find but can take you far away from depth in any area. Sadly, they are the first users of #internet enabled tools to reach their usually short term goals - this can be a tough skill to learn in 21st Century. 2. Tough times produce better #leadership role players - most of these will not have a 'title' that's associated with a #leader - watch out for #results that these humans create - stay true to your path and make it easy for such players to find you, as #Talent. I'm grateful to many such humans who helped me discover my own strengths. 3. Keep connecting with #Science, especially those updates within this space that impacts #humanbehavior - these are unturned stones that can #connect you to unique opportunities for finding and designing solutions for 21st century's problems. Keep looking out for #purpose led journeys in 2024. Here's wishing you all the very best that you can seek and find for yourself in 2024 üòç https://lnkd.in/gtECTZrd"
