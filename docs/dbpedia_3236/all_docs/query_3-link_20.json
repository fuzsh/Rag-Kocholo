        "text": "Stephan et al. (2007, 2008) reported three novel species, Enterobacter pulveris, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter turicensis isolated from dried fruit powders, powdered infant formula (PIF), a number of PIF-production environments and other dried food ingredients. These species of the genus Enterobacter were originally isolated during initial work being carried out to define the genus Cronobacter, as described by Iversen et al. (2007, 2008). The original decision used to justify their exclusion from the genus Cronobacter was clearly based on differences in their phenotypic characteristics, as well as data from DNA–DNA hybridization and the phylogenetic analysis of the rpoB gene (Stephan et al., 2007, 2008). However, these novel species do share several phenotypic and metabolic characteristics with members of the genus Cronobacter, such as resistance to desiccation, production of a yellow Pantoea-like, carotenoid pigment (Lehner et al., 2006) and constitutive metabolism of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, which is the feature used in the differentiation of presumptive colonies of members of the genus Cronobacter growing on most chromogenic Cronobacter isolation agars (Iversen et al., 2004).\n\nThere is no indication that Enterobacter pulveris, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter turicensis pose a threat to public health. In contrast, it is well-documented that members of the genus Cronobacter (except for the single species Cronobacter condimenti) are opportunistic foodborne pathogens and known to be rare, but important, causes of invasive life-threatening neonatal and infantile infections; which can lead to severe disease manifestations such as brain abscesses, meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and systemic sepsis (Bowen & Braden, 2006).\n\nRecently, Brady et al. (2013) re-evaluated the taxonomy of the genus Enterobacter, based primarily on multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) by partial sequencing of four housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoB, infB and atpD), and these authors proposed that Enterobacter helveticus, Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter turicensis should be recognized as species of the genus Cronobacter. The authors asserted that phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated nucleotide sequences of these four genes provided differentiation between previously described members of the genus Enterobacter; grouping them into five strongly supported MLSA groups. MLSA group E included the seven described species of the genus Cronobacter along with Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris. A closer examination of the phylogenetic tree from this study, however, reveals that MLSA group E consists of two well-differentiated clades; one of which contains the seven well recognized species of the genus Cronobacter and the second clade consisting of two subclades, one containing Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris and the other containing Enterobacter turicensis.\n\nIn an effort to further clarify the taxonomic standing of these three species, we performed genome-scale analyses using whole-genome sequencing data from multiple strains from each species, to augment previously reported genotypic and phenotypic results (Stephan et al., 2007, 2008). By reapplying this polyphasic approach to include new whole-genome sequence data, these data clarify the taxonomic standing of these species. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) (Goris et al., 2007), by blast, was computed using the JSpecies package (Richter and Roselló-Móra, 2009). 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, using partial sequences downloaded from the NCBI GenBank repository and representative of the seven type strains of species of the genus Cronobacter, Enterobacter cloacae and the six newly assembled genomes of Enterobacter pulveris, Enterobacter turicensis and Enterobacter helveticus was computed after alignment with clustal w using the mega5 phylogeny suite (Tamura et al., 2011). The tree was generated using the maximum-likelihood method.\n\nGenome-scale phylogeny was computed using a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approach: 23 genomes of members of the genus Cronobacter, 12 whole genome assemblies for members of the genera Klebsiella, Escherichia, Citrobacter and Salmonella, available at NCBI, and assembled genomes of Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris reported by Grim et al. (2013), Gopinath et al. (2013) and Stephan et al. (2013) were used to create a local blast database. Using Cronobacter sakazakii BAA-894 as the reference strain, this database was queried using in-house Perl scripts (Perl scripts will be made available upon request). A SNP-profile was generated for 300 randomly chosen BAA-894 homologues found among the 51 genomes and used to create a phylogram using mega software version 5 (Tamura et al., 2011). This phylogram was then used to compare the genomes of species of the genus Cronobacter with the six Enterobacter pulveris, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter turicensis strains using a novel k-mer analysis scheme. A k-mer is a motif of a coding sequence in a genomic sequence and it is defined by its oligonucleotide size and frequency distribution within a genome. K-mers are not necessarily found more than once in a genome and this is characteristic of analyses developed for k-mers of 25 oligonucleotides or more. The analysis was carried out by developing a database of 25-mers for each sequenced strain, then by computationally identifying unique and shared k-mers among the strains of the two genera.\n\nPCR analysis for the prevalence of plasmid-encoded virulence factor genes (plasmidotyping) and other genotyping assays such as PCR analysis for the presence of the Cronobacter-specific zpx (zinc metalloprotease) gene and species-specific cgcA (diguanylate cyclase) and rpoB genes were performed as described previously by Franco et al. (2011), Kothary et al. (2007), Carter et al. (2013), Stoop et al. (20 nd Lehner et al. (2012).\n\n16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny is shown in and is in agreement with previous partial and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing results for members of the genus Cronobacter as described by Iversen et al. (2007) and Enterobacter helveticus, Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter turicensis (Stephan et al. (2007, 2008). The 16S rRNA gene sequence-based tree of the tested members of the family Enterobacteriaceae appears not to be reflective of the phylogenetic relationships among the species and genera as observed using other methods. In addition, the resolution of the tree is not sufficient to capture the subtle differences among species of the genus Cronobacter and these related species.\n\nDNA–DNA hybridization results are summarized in Table S1 (available in the online Supplementary Material) and as reported originally by Stephan et al. (2007, 2008) clearly indicate that all three species of the genus Enterobacter investigated in this study are in fact three distinct species, as comparisons among the strains of each proposed species fall well below the accepted 70 % DNA–DNA relatedness threshold. Furthermore, the results indicate that the two strains of Enterobacter helveticus, 513/05T and 1159/04 (100 % DNA–DNA relatedness), and the two strains of Enterobacter pulveris, 1160/04 and 601/05T (99–100 %), are highly clonal. The two strains of Enterobacter turicensis, 508/05T and 610/05, were also highly related to one another (95 %). These results are probably explained by the fact that each pair of strains was isolated from a similar desiccated, powdered food or food production environment.\n\nUnfortunately, DNA–DNA hybridization studies are not generally utilized to delineate genera boundaries. From Table S1, it is clear that the two strains of Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter helveticus are more closely related to each other (54 %) than either is to http://dx.doi.org/10.1601/nm.10710 Enterobacter turicensis (23–27 %). From our previous work, we found that the DNA–DNA hybridization values are consistent with those among species of the same genus (Iversen et al., 2008), in this case, the genus Cronobacter.\n\nANI has emerged as one of the predominant genomic alternatives to DNA–DNA hybridization. We conducted numerous pairwise ANI analyses between genomes of Enterobacter pulveris, Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus and members of the genera Cronobacter and Enterobacter, as well as other enteric bacteria (Table S2). The pairwise ANI values between each of the two strains of the three species of the genus Enterobacter are in excellent agreement with the DNA–DNA hybridization values. An ANI value of 95 % has been set as a species threshold, corresponding to a DNA–DNA hybridization value of 70 % (Goris et al., 2007). The current species epithet designations among the six isolates of members of the genus Enterobacter examined in this study are in agreement with this threshold (Table S2). This analytical approach would support efforts aimed at clarifying taxonomic relationships within the core members of the genus Enterobacter as well (Table S2).\n\nWhile ANI has been extensively applied to the examination of species delineation, we propose that this analysis can be extremely informative in questions regarding genus-level demarcations. We included several species of two genera, Cronobacter and the core Enterobacter group, in our ANI analyses. In both cases, the minimum pairwise ANI values between species within each genus are greater than 85 %. Other pairwise species ANI values in Table S2, such as between Dickeya dianthicola strain IPO 980 and Dickeya solani strain MK10 (91.8 %), or Citrobacter freundii strain 4_7_47CFAA and Citrobacter spp. strain KTE151 (92.1 %), fall within this threshold. Still other pairwise comparisons; for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae KPNIH1 and Klebsiella mobilis (Enterobacter aerogenes) FG135 (84.5 %), or Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens SP1 and Kosakonia radicincitans DSM 16656 (83.5%), indicate that this threshold should in fact be lower, or that these taxonomic relationships need to be re-examined more closely. Interestingly, strains of Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris have pairwise ANI values that support the inclusion of these two species in one genus, while pairwise ANI values between Enterobacter turicensis and this group indicate that they are indeed two distinct genus-level taxonomic groups (Table S2).\n\nAlthough pairwise ANI values provide a benchmark of divergence (or similarity) between two genomes, evolutionary relationships between more than two genomes cannot be inferred from this analysis. Therefore, genome-scale phylogenetic analysis using SNP profiles ( ) and k-mer analysis was performed. When 300 random genes of Cronobacter sakazakii strain BAA-894 were used to assess for the presence of SNPs in their homologues from each of the 40 other enteric genomes, a stable phylogenetic profile emerged. This approach allowed for the repeated examination of any random number of genes for validation, and in each case a top-level, five-clade phylogram pattern emerged. shows a representative tree in which five major clades were noted. In clade I, strains from all seven species of the genus Cronobacter with validly published names (Iversen et al., 2008; Joseph et al., 2012) grouped together. The two genomes of strains of Enterobacter cloacae used in this analysis grouped within clade III, along with isolates of the genera Citrobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia and Klebsiella. Lastly, the isolates of members of the genus Pantoea grouped within clade V. Interestingly, the two strains of Enterobacter turicensis grouped separately in clade IV, being distinct from the clade containing the Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris strains, which grouped into clade II. These results unambiguously confirm that these six isolates classified as members of the genus Enterobacter are not members of the genus Cronobacter nor of the genus Enterobacter, and furthermore, these data indicate that these bacteria should be placed into two new unique genus-level taxonomic groups.\n\nFurther genomic analyses using k-mer signatures confirmed and supported these observations. Based on the above phylogram, k-mer signature sets were generated for each group of genomes. Over 29 000 unique k-mer signatures for Cronobacter sakazakii, approximately 67 000 signatures for Cronobacter malonaticus, 36 500 signatures for Cronobacter turicensis, 64 000 for Cronobacter muytjensii and 36 500 signatures for Cronobacter dublinensis were generated at genus-level for the genus Cronobacter (clade I). In contrast, k-mer analysis for Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris together (clade II) contained over 166 000 signatures compared with approximately 152 500 signatures for Enterobacter turicensis (clade IV). When all the genomes from clade I were combined for the genus Cronobacter clade (genus-specific k-mers), the number of k-mer signatures was approximately 6000 compared with approximately 14 000 k-mer signatures for the strains of species of the genus Enterobacter in clades II and IV. Subsequently, k-mer analysis showed that there were only 908 k-mer signatures in common between all genomes of members of the genus Cronobacter in clade I and the genomes of members of the genus Enterobacter in clades II and IV. Together, these results indicate that Enterobacter helveticus, Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter turicensis are genomically distinct from any member of the genus Cronobacter; that the members of the Enterobacter helveticus/Enterobacter pulveris clade are more related to each other than to either of the Enterobacter turicensis isolates; and these three species of the genus Enterobacter may represent two distinct taxonomic groups, as shown in the phylogram in .\n\nPhenotypic characteristics that differentiate Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter helveticus from species of the genus Cronobacter were based on results from ID 32 E and API 20 E tests (bioMérieux) and Biolog phenotypic microarray analyses (Biolog) as reported by Stephan et al. (2007, 2008), Iversen et al. (2008) and Joseph et al. (2012). Based on their corresponding phenotypes, this phylogenetic placement is further supported by the fact that Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter helveticus can utilize 5-keto-d-gluconate, trans-aconitate, quinate, p-hydroxybenzoate and protocatehuate while Enterobacter turicensis cannot utilize these substrates. Also by using the API 20 E test kit and the Vitek 2.0 Compact GN card (Vitek software version 5), Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter helveticus are ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)-negative ( ). Biochemically, Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris can be clearly differentiated from members of the genus Cronobacter, as shown in , by the following common phenotypic characteristics: ODC, Voges–Proskauer test, methyl red test, arginine dihydrolase, mucate utilization and palatinose utilization (Iversen et al., 2008; Stephan et al., 2007, 2008). Key biochemical reactions which differentiate Enterobacter pulveris from Enterobacter helveticus are the ability of Enterobacter pulveris to ultiize sucrose, d-arabitol, raffinose and fumerate as a carbon source and to produce acid from cellobiose, d-arabitol, sucrose and l-rhamnose, whereas Enterobacter helveticus cannot utilize or produce acid from these substrates. Furthermore, lytic phages targeting the different species of the genus Cronobacter do not lyse Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus or Enterobacter pulveris (not shown).\n\nGenotypic analysis using PCR-based assays for the detection of targets specific to members of the genus Cronobacter included α-glucosidase, rpoB, zpx (zinc metalloprotease) and cgcA (diguanylate cyclase) genes as described by Iversen et al. (2007), Stoop et al. (2009), Lehner et al. (2012), Kothary et al. (2007) and Carter et al. (2013). Results of these analyses among strains of Enterobacter turicensis, Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris showed that these strains were negative for these gene targets, further extending support for our phylogenetic findings. In addition plasmidotyping studies, as described by Franco et al. (2011), showed that only Enterobacter turicensis strains 610/05 and 508/05T contained a plasmid of the IncF1B type with a repA replication gene, and all other plasmid gene targets for members of the genus Cronobacter were not identified by PCR analysis (Grim et al., 2013). This analysis also demonstrated that this plasmid lacked the two iron-acquisition systems, which together comprise gene clusters of the common virulence plasmids of members of the genus Cronobacter.\n\nComparative genomics also revealed a number of distinguishing genotypic characteristics, including several species- and group-specific chaperone/usher fimbriae, bacteriophage, or prophage-like elements, plasmids, transposons and several metabolic traits (Grim et al., 2013; Gopinath et al., 2013; Stephan et al., 2013). Specifically, both strains of Enterobacter turicensis used in this study possessed a type III secretion system and two conjugative plasmids. Conversely, both strains of Enterobacter pulveris and Enterobacter helveticus possessed operons for the catabolism of l-idonate, an unspecified β-xyloside, putrescine, fructose and lysine, as well as the pga biofilm operon and the lsr autoinducer-2 operon. Between these two species, and of note, the two strains of Enterobacter pulveris possessed operons for the catabolism of sialic acid (nan), mannitol/arabitol and sucrose, and identical CRISPR elements, while the two strains of Enterobacter helveticus possessed a unique homologous maltose 6-phosphate utilization operon, as well as a haemin ABC transporter. Interestingly, Enterobacter helveticus strain 1159/04 harboured a smaller plasmid homologous to IncN2 plasmids shown to carry the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1)-encoding gene (Chen et al., 2012; Grim et al., 2013; Poirel, et al., 2011).\n\nKothary et al. (2007) have reported that members of the genus Cronobacter contained a zinc metalloprotease gene, zpx and that the nucleotide region encompassing the conserved zinc-binding site was a useful genus-specific target for the detection of members of the genus Cronobacter. Kothary et al. (2007) showed that the advantage of this genus-specific assay is that these closely related species of the genus Enterobacter were differentiated from members of the genus Cronobacter because they do not yield the 350 bp amplicon. Phylogenetic analysis of zpx sequences, shown in Fig. S1 demonstrates that these three species of the genus Enterobacter possessed related, but distinct zpx orthologues, which strengthens the support for the distinct and separate taxonomic relatedness of these species proposed on the basis of the genome-scale phylogenetic analyses described in .\n\nTherefore, since no minimal requirements for genus characterization exist (Wayne et al., 1987) and based on the genomic and phenotypic data reported here, we propose reclassifying Enterobacter turicensis in a new genus named Siccibacter gen. nov., which is to separate this species from the genera Cronobacter and Enterobacter. It is also proposed that Enterobacter helveticus and Enterobacter pulveris are reclassified in a separate genus, named Franconibacter gen. nov.\n\nDescription of Siccibacter gen. nov.\n\nSiccibacter (Sic.ci.bac′ter.
