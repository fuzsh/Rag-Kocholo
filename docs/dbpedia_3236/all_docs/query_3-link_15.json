        "text": "Streamlined development workflows to keep your project on schedule with efficient use of effort\n\nDevOps plays a critical role in the rapid IT service delivery mechanisms. And when it comes to Drupal development, DevOps can be instrumental in streamlining project delivery. DevOps constitutes Dev which refers to software application development and Ops which denotes IT operations. DevOps is not a framework or a workflow but is more of a culture.\n\nHere are the benefits of DevOps:\n\n- High velocity\n\n- Scalability\n\n- Faster delivery\n\n- Security\n\nIn this session, we will talk about the streamlined DevOps workflows using Acquia cloud IDE and Acquia CI/CD Pipeline. There by the developer's time and effort can be utilised efficiently.\n\nD7 impending EOL\n\nFor a website to be a high performing space, it is imperative to upgrade to the stable release of the content management system like Drupal. With Drupal 7 reaching its EOL, Drupal 9 should be the go-to version for the website. Therefore, upgrading to Drupal 9 would be a significantly important business decision with future in mind. This migration to D9 from D7 is not a straight forward move. It needs a thorough investigation of the current website and assess the impact for the Drupal upgrade.\n\nIn this session, we will go through the different modules available in the Drupal community which helps to assess the changes that is necessary for the upgrade. We will also cover the approaches and steps that should be taken to complete the upgrade.\n\nDrupal Contributed modules:\n\n- https://www.acquia.com/products/drupal-cloud/migrate New tool suite by Acquia\n\n- https://www.drupal.org/project/migration_advisor Module supported by Moonraft\n\nWeb Vitals are crucial for UX: Implementing core Web Vitals in your Drupal Site\n\nWeb Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web.\n\nSite owners should not have to be performance gurus in order to understand the quality of experience they are delivering to their users. The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the Core Web Vitals. Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners, and will be surfaced across all Google tools. Web Vitals are consider into 3 major thresholds like LCP, FIP and CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading. First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, pages should have an FID of 100 milliseconds or less. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of 0.1. or less.\n\nIn this session, we present a detailed explanation about web vitals and ways to apply them in web development on the go during the development phase.\n\nSetting up independent sites from a single codebase\n\nMultisite is one of the most highly rated features of Drupal. Drupal allows separate, independent sites to be served from a single codebase. Each site can have its own database, configuration, files and base domain or URL. A new site can be spun up from an existing codebase with minimal configuration or downtime.\n\n- Contents\n\n- What is Multisite\n\n- Use-case for implementing Multisite architecture\n\n- In depth view of a Multisite Architecture\n\n- Steps to take to create a new site.\n\n- Common gotchas\n\n- Demo\n\n- Questions\n\nPWA vs AMP: Knowing the difference while building your Drupal website\n\nProgressive Web Apps (PWA) are built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver experiences to anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase. PWAs are web applications that are designed to be capable, reliable, and installable—the three pillars that enable an app-like functionality, giving users the experience of a mobile app even while accessing it on a browser.\n\nAMP facilitates faster loading web pages for mobile devices. To keep JavaScript from delaying page rendering, AMP allows only asynchronous JavaScript. AMP components may have JavaScript under the hood, but they’re carefully designed to make sure they don’t cause performance degradation.\n\nIn this session, we will compare the overall usability of the two from a real-time-oriented point of view.\n\nDifferent ways to Approach Drupal to build a Brochure website vs Transactional data website\n\nThe attributes of a static website vs transactional is very different. Hence, its very significant to know the different route/ approaches that we should follow before project execution of a static vs transactional site.\n\nIn this session we will go through the main differences with static vs transactional site.\n\nWe will go through some use cases.\n\nContents\n\n- When is a site said to be static and when is it dynamic\n\n- When do I need a dynamic or static website\n\n- Areas to focus when building a dynamic website\n\n- Performance\n\n- Security\n\n- SEO\n\n- Integrations\n\n- UI\n\n- What if I need a hybrid\n\n- Caching for anonymous user vs logged in user\n\n- Page layouts for pre login pages vs post login pages\n\n- SEO\n\n- Questions\n\nStay upgrade ready, anytime. Assess any Drupal site's migration readiness at the click of a button\n\nWith Drupal Migration Advisor, you get to instantly assess the time and\n\neffort needed by your website to upgrade to Drupal 8 and\n\nhigher. This session will demonstrate a detailed assessment of a website, at the end of which you get to generate a self-heuristic report on your migration effort analysis, weightage of media assets, total migration time & costs, higher version compatibility, platform composition, and advice for greater performance\n\nAchieve 3X faster website load time, with headless Drupal implementation. Here's how!\n\nA headless CMS offers a great approach for sites that require functionality beyond what Drupal normally supports. When you decouple, you have the opportunity to choose the best tool for individual technical requirements. Drupal core contributor and Rafter Gopi illustrates how an enterprise-quality CMS can be set up for free, paired with a great modern development experience and all the benefits of the JAMstack, like performance, scalability, and security. You will learn how to integrate headless Drupal into your system and make your site's pages load 3X faster."
