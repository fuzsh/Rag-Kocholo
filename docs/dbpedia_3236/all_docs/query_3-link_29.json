        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAbout one-third of the annual hospital budget is spent on buying materials and supplies, including medicines.[1] The pharmacy is one of the most extensively used therapeutic facilities of the hospital and one of the few areas where a large amount of money is spent on purchases on a recurring basis. This emphasizes the need for planning, designing and organizing the pharmacy in a manner that results in efficient clinical and administrative services.[2] The goal of the hospital supply system is to ensure that there is adequate stock of the required items so that an uninterrupted supply of all essential items is maintained. A study conducted by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms in India has revealed that not only does the quantity of medicines received fall short of the requirement but also the supply is often erratic. Even common medicines are out of stock and remain so for a considerable period.[3] Of the various explanations for non-availability of even simple medicines in the third world countries, a large number are related to materials management. A study from a 1,500-bedded state-funded hospital has claimed that review and control measures for expensive drugs brought about 20% savings.[4]\n\nInventory control in hospital pharmacy is very essential in a developing country like India.[5] As resources are limited, it is essential that the existing resources be appropriately utilized. With the existing drug budget, if rational drug use and improved drug management practices are followed, more number of patients can be served. It is essential that health managers use scientific methods to maximize their returns from investment at a minimal cost.[5–8]\n\nDrug inventory management stresses on cost containment and improved efficiency.[9] Each item may be considered critical and there is a perceived need to supply very high levels of service.[10] There is no denying that stocking hospital pharmaceuticals and supplies can be expensive and tie up a lot of capital, and bringing efficiencies to such important cost drivers - often 30-40% of a hospital’s budget - can present meaningful savings.[11] Thus, a hospital materials manager must establish efficient inventory system policies for normal operating conditions that also ensure the hospital’s ability to meet emergency demand conditions.[12] But, it is impossible and unnecessary too to monitor every drug used in the health system. High-cost and high-volume drugs come in priority, whose intervention is likely to cause the greatest clinical and economic impact. In the whole process, it is important to trace the costliest medicinal products first, those that consume the major portion of the budget, and then design a strategy to further study and identify their use pattern. The study of use pattern will help in designing appropriate corrective measures. ABC analysis is an important tool used worldwide, identifying items that need greater attention for control.[5–8,13]\n\nABC analysis is a method of classifying items or activities according to their relative importance. It is also known as “separating the vital few from the trivial many” because, for any group of things that contribute to a common effect, a relatively few contributors account for a majority of the effects. The analysis classifies the items into three categories: the first 10-15% of the items account for approximately 70% of cumulative value (cost) (category A), 20-25% are category B items that account for a further 20% of the cumulative value and the remaining 65-70% are category C items, amounting for a mere 10% of the total value.[5–9,14–16]\n\nThe limitation of ABC analysis is that it is based only on monetary value and the rate of consumption of the item. In a hospital, an item of low monetary value and consumption may be very vital or even life saving. Their importance cannot be overlooked simply because they do not appear in category A. Therefore, another parameter of the materials is their criticality.[7]\n\nVED analysis is based on critical values and shortage cost of the item. Based on their criticality, the items could be classified into three categories: vital, essential and desirable. There could be serious functional dislocation of patient care services in hospital when vital drugs are not available even for a short period. If essential items are not available beyond a few days or a week, the functioning of the hospital can be adversely affected. The shortage of desirable items would not adversely affect patient care or hospital functioning even if shortage is prolonged.[5,7,17]\n\nA combination of ABC and VED analysis (ABC-VED matrix) can be gainfully employed to evolve a meaningful control over the material supplies. Category I includes all vital and expensive items (AV, BV, CV, AE, AD). Category II includes the remaining items of the E and B groups (BE, CE, BD). Category III includes the desirable and cheaper group of items (CD).[17]\n\nIn the present study, ABC, VED and ABC-VED matrix analysis of the pharmacy store of PGIMER, Chandigarh (a 1,500 bed tertiary care teaching, research and referral health institute catering to the major portion of northern India), was performed to identify the categories of drugs needing stringent management control.\n\nThe specific objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the annual consumption of items of pharmacy and expenditure incurred on them for the year 2007-08, (2) evolve a priority system based on ABC and VED and ABC-VED matrix analysis, (3) identify the item categories requiring greater supervisory monitoring.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nProvision of care in tertiary care hospitals is sensitive to the timely availability of facilities, including drugs. In case of drugs, besides the criticality factor, the cost factor must also be taken into consideration, as can be seen from our study, where about 10% of the drugs consumed about 70% of ADE of the pharmacy. This is the group requiring greater monitoring as it has fewer drugs consuming most of the money. We also noted that not all the drugs in this group were vital or essential. It also had drugs from the desirable category. Categorization of drugs by the ABC-VED matrix model helps to narrow down on fewer drugs requiring stringent control.\n\nABC analysis\n\nThe present study showed that if ABC analysis is considered alone for drug inventory, it would help effectively control the recommended 58 (13.78%) items in the A category, with almost 70% of ADE of the pharmacy, but it would compromise on the availability of items of vital nature from B and C categories (35 items, 8.31%). The results of the study are comparable with similar studies conducted in India [ ].[9,17,19–20]\n\nTable 3\n\nCategoryPresent studyGMCH, Goa study[17]Service hosp., AFI study[20]GMCH, Nagpur study[9]CGHS study[19]A13.7812.9314.4610.7617.81B21.8519.5422.4620.6322.60C64.3767.5363.0868.6159.59V12.1112.367.3923.765.14E59.3847.1249.2338.1258.90D28.5140.5243.3838.1235.96I22.0922.9920.9229.1521.58II54.6341.6748.9241.2656.16III23.2835.3430.1629.5922.26\n\nVED analysis\n\nIf VED analysis alone is considered, ideal control can be exercised on the identified vital and/or essential items, accounting for 89.52% of ADE of the pharmacy. However, category A also contains six desirable items with 3.34% of ADE of the pharmacy and hence it is not possible to ignore the desirable group completely. The comparison with similar studies in India showed high variation in the percentage of vital, essential and desirable items [ ].[9,17,19–20] This could be because different institutes have different service profiles, depending on the specialty services available.\n\nABC-VED matrix analysis\n\nIn a combination of ABC and VED analysis, the resultant matrix makes it possible to focus on 93 (22.09%) items belonging to category I for strict managerial control as these items are either expensive or vital. The annual expenditure of these items was 74.21% of ADE of the pharmacy. AV, AE and BV subgroups of category I consist of 68 items (16.15%) that are expensive (70.12% of ADE), and their being out of stock is unacceptable as they are either vital or essential. To prevent locking up of capital due to these items, low buffer stock needs to be maintained while keeping a strict vigil on the consumption level and the stock in hand. A two-bin method of ordering needs to be followed for these as this will eliminate the risk of item shortage. CV items (19, 4.51%) are drugs of low cost but high criticality and take up 0.74% of ADE of the pharmacy. Because this amount is negligible, these items can be procured once a year and stocked as their carrying cost is low.\n\nAD items (only six, 1.43%) consume 3.34% of the ADE. These items should be monitored for economic order quality, and their order placement must be made after careful study of the need. Rational use of items in this subgroup, including their removal from the list if possible, can bring about substantial savings without affecting patient care.\n\nCategory II items (230, 54.63%) consumes 22.23% of the ADE. These items can be ordered once or twice a year, thereby saving on ordering cost and reducing management hassles at a moderate carrying cost and without blocking substantial capital. Category III items (98, 23.28%) consume 3.57% of the ADE. These items can also be ordered once or twice a year, thereby saving on ordering cost at a moderate carrying cost and without blocking substantial capital. The comparison with similar studies in India is shown in .[9,17,19–20]"
