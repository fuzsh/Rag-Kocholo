        "text": "Well, this post is related to Communication.When we hear Communication, it boils down to English as a language. In spite of my wife being a Soft Skills Trainer and my best friend a Communication Expert, I still believe what Amitabh Bachchan said long time ago – English is a very funny language. For eg. Let’s examine three words: Incapable, Inflammable and Invaluable. Incapable means NOT CAPABLE, Inflammable means FLAMMABLE and Invaluable means VERY VALUABLE. But this post is not about English, that’s not my forte. This post is about my observations about how people communicate in different parts of India showcasing the linguistic diversity we possess and not to offend anyone. Lets begin with Mumbai and Delhi. While many of my Delhi friends typically add “iyo” after every verb like “Phone kariyo” and “Kal Miliyo”, our Mumbai friends add “ega” for every verb, like “Main phone karega” and “Tujse Milega”.Another dear friend from Satna (MP) always say “Mere Uncle Aaj khatam ho gaye” to denote her uncle expired.She was once late for office, the reason being “Aaj bahut paani gir raha tha”- I thought maybe some overhead tank was leaking but no, this was her way to indicate there was heavy rainfall. Now coming to Gujarat (I am from Ahmedabad and have spent my first 25 years there, most importantly, my wife is a Gujju), Gujju guys have a special characteristic in pronouncing “sh” as only “s”. It’s a coincidence that 70% of Gujju boys names end with a “sh” but end up being called as Hites, Kamles, Jites etc. A point to note is that Gujjus pronounce this way only if the “sh” is at the end of a name. They correctly pronounce words like Shiv, Shakti, Shani etc. There can also be many conflicts/ misunderstandings due to this dialect diversity. Most people from Bihar and UP never use “Main” in their dialect – they always use “Hum” even though in singular tense. Now, if a UP guy in Mumbai tells “Hum kal pahunch jayenge” may be understood as full family coming.There is an offensive side too.Cite this – “Teriyuma” in Tamil means Do you know? An innocent word like Teriyuma when spoken by a Tamilian in Mumbai sounds like “Teri Maa” which is offensive. Same goes for Marathi word \"Lavkar\" being taken as \"Love Kar\". Lastly the vocabulary too changes according to location, gender and status. In Mumbai, a Virar ka Chokra, Bandra boy and SOBO guy co-exist. Even vegetables are not spared. A Baingan at Virar turns Brinjal in Andheri and becomes an Eggplant in Bandra to be finally called an Aubergine at Colaba. While males eat ICECREAM all times, females eat Gelato, Popsicle, Sorbet etc. Males drink Coffee, while females drink Capuccino, Latte, Mocha etc. So basically,what i wanted to share is the fact that we don't need to compare other countries to study cultural diversity. We are so many countries within a country, and maybe that’s why we are Incredible India.

It all began with a negative atmosphere - WC starting just 5 days after IPL, Rohit - Hardik chemistry, team selection ignoring promising youngsters and the funniest part - there was not a single player in the WC squad from SRH and KKR teams, the two best teams which played the finals of IPL and had 4 players from MI which stood last in the points table. Still this team performed and became a Champion, all members contributing collectively. This win was a practical application of the famous Aristotle quote\" The whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". I have enlisted 5 takeaways for the students from this World Cup win: 1. RAHUL DRAVID – The Coach of 2024 was the captain of 2007 WC team which was India's worst WC performance, irony being both WCs being played at the same venue - West Indies. It teaches us perseverance. The Universe will give us second chance if we are patient and focussed. 2. ROHIT SHARMA - Knowing your team and keeping the organization always before self is what we can learn from him. 3. VIRAT KOHLI - Performing at Crunch situations and Leveraging our strengths are key takeaways from him. He batted in 3 phases in the final – Aggression, Calm, Aggression – teaching us we should know when to curb our ego and unleash our potential for the organizational benefits. 4. RISHABH PANT - His role in this WC win was like what Sales Promotion does to Sales- immediate boosting of sales. Pant's cameos gave the score an impetus required, which was very handy in hindsight. This was done by him after recovering from a fatal road accident which kept him bed ridden for a year, doubting he will ever play cricket again. DON’T QUIT was his motto always. 5. HARDIK PANDYA - Perhaps the ultimate Redemption story of this World Cup. Considered a National Villian, got Booed the entire IPL season, rumours of a Divorce, over and above getting the last over to bowl where he would have been crucified if India had lost. Any normal human would have succumbed to that pressure. But Hardik Pandya delivered, and as they say rest is History. We all face criticisms around us, but choosing to ignore the noise and focus only on task ahead is what makes us a true Champion. We may not be perfect in our work, but little contribution here and there to the organization may be that “EXTRA” required to win. SKY’s catch in the final, Jaddu’s sixer against Australia which took the score par 200 – these things may look trivial but so important in the overall context of the result. All the best to you all and may you win your own version of World Cups in life - love, family, happiness, job, money, success. PS: I have not mentioned Bumrah here, as we all know he is Faultless Genius. I wanted to discuss how we can overcome our limitations and move on in life.

Last post ended with the question regarding how Bhutan is sustaining itself so well inspite of having so many visitors annually. Well, the answer lies in a simple but visionary tourism policy: a) Every tourist has to shell out Rs. 1200 per person per night of stay as SDF (Sustainable Development Fee) b) Mandatory stays at not less than three-star accommodations and use of only SUVs for sightseeing, irrespective of the number of tourists. c) It is mandatory to hire both - a Guide and a driver throughout the trip. No entry to monuments without guide. d) Monument entry fee is kept very steep, at Rs.300- Rs.1000 per person. e) No outside cars are allowed, only local cars to be hired.Same applies to drivers- its mandatory to hire local drivers only. In essence, Bhutan's tourism policy prioritizes quality over quantity of tourists, it ensures that only a particular segment of tourists visit Bhutan to preserve its cultural identity. It doesn't encourage any visitors who pose threat to its sustainability, not even at cost of lucrative monetary incentives. Its evident that inspite of 70% of tourists being Indians, there is still no presence of a McD or Starbucks or even a ICICI or HDFC bank - only local banks are functional.In airlines too, only 2 local airlines (DrukAir and Tashi Air) ply on their runways. No foreign Debit/ Credit Card work- it's a cash economy for tourists. Bhutan is a proud self sufficient economy prioritizing local resources, so foreign companies can't convince it of boosting the economy with their presence. To cater to its culturally diverse tourists alongwith balancing its Buddhism philosophy, its amazing to know there is not a single slaughter house in entire Bhutan. Non-veg food, especially Chicken and Mutton are easily available, but meat are being 100% imported.Women empowerment can be seen practically everywhere. Nearly 50% of tourist drivers and Tour guides were women (including our driver).Recently, Bhutan government has allowed tourists to buy Duty- free Gold resulting in gold prices being much cheaper than India. This masterstroke ensures more Indian tourists every year, hence more Tourism fund collection driving the overall economy towards self sufficiency. We can argue that the population (entire Bhutan's population is less than our Thane region) undoubtedly is a key factor contributing towards its sustainability, still its not a rocket science and there is absolutely no doubt why India can't emulate this policy. A simple stringent penalty system on spitting, littering, honking and wasting food can do wonders.Lets hope for a change.Till then Be happy, Be content. Note: The information provided is based on discussions with my guide and information provided by him. Parita Shroff Shetty @KOHINOOR BUSINESS SCHOOL KOHINOOR EDUCATION COMPLEX, MUMBAI SUBURBAN, Minouti Naik\n\nI recently had the privilege of visiting Bhutan, one of the happiest countries, and it's no exaggeration to say it's among the most stunning places I've ever seen. The verdant landscapes and captivating valleys were a delight to behold, but it was the warmth and hospitality of the Bhutanese people that made it more beautiful. My curiosity led me to find why Bhutan ranks so highly on the Happiness Index. The answer is as simple as 2+2=4, they just do what they love to do without any peer pressure or competition. In fact in Bhutan, grades aren't the sole criteria for employment, rather, one's interests hold greater significance. Engaging in conversations with our local guide and driver unveiled numerous intriguing facets of Bhutan, which I believe are worth sharing, especially with all my students: 1. There are no beggars in the entire country. Most people are self sufficient, having some cultivation taking care of their daily food requirements. 2. Everybody is content, as they do what they love doing: there is minimal expense to take care of, as medicines and children education are free. 3. There are many govt- run Old Age Homes where the senior citizens are taken care of, free of cost. 4. The practice of maintaining happiness diaries allow individuals to document moments of joy, providing a tangible account keeping track of the times they had been happy in a year. 5. Bhutanese reckon their age from conception, considering the nine months spent in the womb, so actually all Bhutanese are 1 year younger than their stated age in absolute terms. 6. There is only a single Airport at Paro, which is as open as it can get without any tight security. The reason again is its peaceful coexistence with other nations, reflecting its lack of external threats. We Indians though, are not habituated to see airports sans any armed security forces. 7. Unlike India where we have numerous state wise number plates an then sub- divided into region zones, there are ony Two types of Number plates on vehicles- BP and BT standing for Bhutan Private and Bhutan Taxi respectively. During our ten-day stay, we marveled at the absolute absence of litter, honking horns, or disgruntled faces being angry or frustrated on anything—an experience that prompts questions about its sustainability. With a total country population of only 7 lakhs and nearly 3 lakhs tourists visiting annually, how does Bhutan maintain its pristine environment and harmonious society so amazingly well? How it ensures being a Carbon negative country inspite of so many foreign (read Indian) tourists. Well, Bhutan's Sustainability mechanism will be covered in my next post. PS : Drop your thoughts in the comments below, and stay tuned for part 2 for more on Bhutan's best sustainable practices.

So I thought of penning down 5 Must watch-movies for management students that can be viewed along with your internship. These movies will provide that 'extra' learning during your internship. 1. GAFLA GAFLA is an underrated but a breakthrough cult movie on Share Markets. It is inspired by the Scam of Harshad Mehta and sketches a beautiful yet realistic graph of its protagonist, providing several takeaways for management students like Stock Market strategies, gauging customer needs and financial management. The film also teaches us WHAT NOT TO DO more as compared to what to do, in order to be successful. Where to watch: YouTube 2. ROCKETSINGH – SALESMAN OF THE YEAR A Must watch for every Marketing student, the film itself is a learning tutorial for Sales and Marketing concepts, displayed beautifully through our protagonist Rocket Singh, played aptly by Ranbir Kapoor. Be it major concepts like team building, leadership qualities, Sales Cycle, to little nuances like how to get appointments through cold calling, customer satisfaction and ethics in sales, this film has it all. Where to watch: Amazon Prime 3.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS This is rated as one of the most inspirational movies of all time. Will Smith plays the real-life iconic character of Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman, who lives with his little kid and how he faces all odds and challenges to emerge as a winner.The biggest takeaway, especially in the current scenario, is that it teaches us to create our own definition of happiness and be content with all that we have got. Where to watch: NETFLIX 4. UDAAN Originally, a Tamil film named Soorarai Pottru, starring South Superstar Suriya in a role of his lifetime, it is available in Hindi as UDAAN. This extraordinary film, inspired from the book SIMPLY FLY by Captain Gopinath is one of the best films on entrepreneurship to be made. Anybody who wants to be an entrepreneur should watch this film to get an idea about the mindset of an entrepreneur. The film is more relatable, because unlike other films, the hero is not larger-than life, but a simple vulnerable character who loses more than he wins, but the secret of success lies in getting up back after every knock. Where to watch: Amazon Prime 5. EK RUKA HUA FAISLA This film is a Masterclass on Negotiation Skills. Based on an English Film - 12 Angry Men, it deals with 12 people deciding on the fate of one young man accused of murder. It is 11 versus 1 at the beginning and how negotiation skills are executed to convince others forms the crux of the film. Every management student should watch this film, as, irrespective of his/her specialization, negotiation skill is a key skill required for everyone to excel in life.

Friendship, like customers in marketing, can indeed be categorized and segmented. In this digital era, we may have 5000 Facebook friends, 2000 LinkedIn connections, and 1000 WhatsApp contacts, but if we introspect, do we truly know even 20% of them? When I say \"know them,\" I literally mean knowing them. So, when we claim to have many friends, it's crucial to specify the type of friends we're referring to. Just like a pack of cards, our friend groups also often consist of Jokers (humorous ones), Jacks (Jugaadu ones), Kings (pampered ones), and Aces (brightest among the group). Based on my understanding and experience, I've categorized friends into four sets: Set 1: Eternal Friends (usually found in school or college days, rarely found after 25 years of age) These friends are the ones with whom we share a timeless connection. Even if we don't communicate for a year, reconnecting feels seamless, as if no time has passed. Our emotions are genuine, and the bond is mutual. They comprehend our silence and perceive the unspoken. Whether acknowledged or not, we trust that they'll be there for us whenever needed. Set 2: \"Har ek Dost Kamina Hota Hai\" (mostly found in schools, colleges, but can enter at any age) These friends embody fun and mischief. Friendship to them means teasing, joking, and delighting in each other's discomfort. Yet, they are the first to rush to our aid in times of need. With them, there are no barriers or pretenses; it's raw and authentic. We quarrel, reconcile, share a drink, and repeat. The bottom line: we argue when together and miss them when apart. Set 3: Convenience/Companionship (usually in later stages of life) These friends are made along life's journey, often by circumstance rather than choice. They could be colleagues, commuting partners, neighbors, morning walk gang, community guys, gym buddies, or even bar mates. Friendship here revolves around shared activities and companionship. However, the emotional depth of these friendships determines the future once the shared task or activity concludes. Set 4: Backup Friends (found at any age) These friends serve as a safety net. Almost everyone has at least one friend in this category—the one we turn to ONLY in times of crisis, confident they'll bail us out. Typically, they're either exes or perennial Samaritans, ever ready to help others. (In short losers form this set who are always looking for redemption) Films like Dil Chahta Hai, Rock On and 3 Idiots may have glorified friendship to another level but still defining friendship is challenging, and finding true, pure friendship in today's world is rare. So, if you find it, hold onto it tightly. PS: The famous fable of Shri Krishna and Sudama goes like this—Sudama asks Shri Krishna, \"Dosti ka Matlab kya hota hai?\" and Shri Krishna simply replies, \"Jisme Matlab ho woh Dosti nahi.\"\n\nOf late, from the psychological perspective, I have been wondering the similarity between suicidal tendency and Resignation tendency. Three striking similarities come to my mind instantly : a) When we have a very bad day at office/ life, or we feel very low these tendencies appear out of nowhere. b) If we take control over our emotions for 15-20 minutes at that very point and let the time pass. Next day is a new day and we laugh at ourselves on how such stupid thoughts can cross our mind. c) This tendency occurs only when we think ourselves as losers or weak and believe that we dont have power to fight the system or even survive through it. I pondered a lot about why people may resign in an organization - Ofcourse, I am not counting those who resign for better opportunities, but i am considering those who resign out of frustration. The reasons for such resignations can be - work not recognized, your credit given to somebody else, partial treatment towards others, unnecessary harassment by boss who doesn't like you, sexual harassment at workplace (nowadays applicable for males too), too much work pressure, loss of interest in job . Many times we believe we can't continue with our current job and Resignation is the only Remedy. But is it true ? What is the guarantee that we would not face the same situation in the new organization. Quitting is never the solution. But then what is? Like suicidal tendency, resignation tendency too passes away organically after a certain time frame. A few solutions I could think of to get rid of such thoughts are: 1. Attach some motivation towards work. It can be Money, or some family Responsibility or some EMI or even some good company of a colleague. But ensure you have a reason to wake up and go to office everyday. 2. Always have a Plan B or back up in life. If you have a back up plan ready, you would not panic every time your boss fires you. Your life should not be dependent on one job and it should not dictate the way you live. The day you can live with the thought that your job is just ONE component of your life, life will be more relaxed. So keep planning your own back up very early while at work. Having an alternate income will give you confidence to not compromise at work place. 3.Take out the External Validation part out of your life and see the difference.The moment you are not bothered about people validating your efforts, you have won half the war. Most of resignations , and even suicides, happen because you feel you are not valued. C'mon, congratulate yourself on your achievements and see the magic. You are valuable to yourself and you should know your value. The day you yourself realize your real value, these frustrations will never creep up and life will be lot more easier. So relax, chill and enjoy your Work and Life, because both are Beautiful if you look at them from the right perspective. PS: As Elbert Hubbard quoted \"Dont take life too seriously, You will never get out of it alive.\"\n\nBeing a Working Woman in Mumbai is a great challenge in itself but a working woman commuting by local trains needs one degree more respect. More so if she gets down or transits from stations like Kurla and Dadar, she needs to be saluted. A Literal Salute. My many female friends and colleagues often mention that 8 hours of work is not their phobia, but 5 mins of crossing over in between platforms is. A nightmare which they face each day. As I too get down at Kurla for my work, I can’t escape but to observe the ordeals faced by women daily , while ascending the foot over bridge to change platforms, during the peak hours in the morning and evening. These women have to make way amidst a sea of males who are waiting for an opportunity to touch/feel them on any pretext. There are multiple cases of molestation, groping and inappropriate touching which goes unreported, but are actually faced by these women. Some women blurt abuses while majority of them ignore and take it as one of their several mandatory daily chores and suffer silently. I have been witnessing this now for several years every day morning at Kurla and so this raises a very alarming question - Why this has not changed over years and why is no one complaining about it? Maybe as the working women already have their hands full with office work, household chores and family responsibilities they don’t want to get involved in further \"Mental stress\" and so they choose to let it go. Another reason may be \"Accepting is better than expecting\", so they have \"accepted\" this morning norm that Men will be Men and have got used to this 5 minutes of agony and not \"expect\" that anything is going to change and probably that is why they ignore it and move on. So what could be the solution to this menace? We don't need a big Rani Lakshmibai type solution or Women empowerment slogans. A small subtle step would be very effective. Probably every woman should be strong enough to raise their voice and handover this mischief mongers to railway police; 5-6 severe punishments would definitely make others such cheapsters more alert. Also maybe there should be some policemen/ women deployed near crowded staircase during peak hours just to keep these pervert men in check. Or perhaps 1 footbridge among the usual 3 can be reserved for women so that they can feel free and secure. Whatever rules government or railways put up, the ultimate solution can only be initiated from within a woman herself. So more respect and Power to the Ultimate Working Woman of Mumbai. Happy Journey! PS: If anybody can share few solutions/tips to tackle this situation would be helpful.\n\nSo finally the World Cup is here, perhaps the most important one because it arrives at a time when ODI is losing its charm, giving way to T20 cricket. No better venue than India to regain its lost glory as all pitches would aid mouth watering clashes, hoping to bring back the lost interest of the audience by November 19th. To start with, we will all cheer for The Men in Blue obviously, but pragmatically the odds favour strong all round teams like England and Australia. This time every team looks balanced and capable of beating any team on a given day, so a lot depends upon how India manoeuvre its resources. I just want to share my SWOT analysis of the current Team India Strengths 1. Top class batting order and all batsmen in form 2. Return of Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav with full fitness and hunger 3. No job ambiguity. Everyone knows their role and what to do. 4. Inclusion of Ashwin means all like - to- like backup ready incase of injuries. Weakness 1. Biggest weakness is the top order vulnerability against left arm seamers , and unfortunately almost all teams have a top left arm pacer who can swing the ball both ways - Boult, Starc, Afridi and Jansen to survive their fiery first spell. 2. Of late, Indian batsmen have shown inability to play against top class spin too. So in Indian pitches assisting spin, have to watch out against the likes of Rashid Khan, Theekshana, Zampa and Adil Rashid. 3. No.5 dilemma - Kishan, SKY or Iyer. Each share a common characteristic of being devastating on his day but completely lost on other days. So hope the one selected performs at this crucial position. 4. Batting form of Ravindra Jadeja is very crucial as India lacks bowling allrounders in its team. Fact that none of the Top 5 can bowl only adds to this woe. Opportunities 1. Familiar pitches and full crowd support to cheer them 2. Last Word Cup campaign for stalwarts Rohit and Virat, so they will be 200% motivated to go on a high. Threats 1. The only disadvantage of IPL - it allows all major foreign players to be accustomed to Indian playing conditions , that could neutralize our home conditions advantage. 2. India is the only team to play all its 9 matches at 9 different venues. Commercial viability is important but that should not be at the cost of team's fatigue. So C'mon India Once More...But keeping emotions aside, May the BEST TEAM win !"
