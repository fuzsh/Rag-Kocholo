        "text": "Subhayan Chakraborty in Chennai\n\nIn the twilight of his life, at theage of 93, when most individuals retreat into solitude and nostalgia, CoimbataraoDoraikannu Gopinath stands as testament to the enduring love for cricket that unites millions of Indians. He is the last living connection to India’s cricketing adolescence, the lone survivor from that historic first Test winin February 1952.\n\nAs the world eagerly awaits the start of India’s World Cup campaign, Gopinath, who resides just a stone’s throw away from Chennai’s hallowed MA Chidambaram Stadium, will also tune in to back the Men in Blue on Sunday.\n\nDespite Bollywood actors receiving coveted ‘Golden Tickets’ for the showpiece tournament, Gopinath, whose ten Tests for India spanned nearly a decade, hasn’t received any official invitation. Yet, in the face of this oversight, he holds no grudges and is preparing to cheer for India from the comfort of his own living room.\n\n“I am going with India to defeat Australia, and win this ODI World Cup opener,” he asserted during an exclusive interview with RevSportz.\n\nAmidst the buzz and excitement, two narratives converge – that of Rohit Sharma, with his burning desire to fulfill an “unfulfilled dream,” and Virat Kohli, on the brink of joining the exclusive club of players who have lifted the coveted trophy twice. Gopinath reflected on the timeless legacy of Sachin Tendulkar, and Kohli’s mission to end India’s decade-long wait for an ICC tournament victory.\n\n“Sachin Tendulkar is a lovely person, he’s a nice man, very humble, and didn’t show off,” said Gopinath, whose discerning eye has also notice subtle changes in Kohli’s game. “I feel Virat Kohli is not as consistent as he was in the past,” he said. “Now, I feel, he is taking more risks in his shots, and I feel that is because of T20 cricket.” Brought up in the age of MCC coaching manuals, Gopinath emphasised the importance of playing with a straight bat.\n\n“But then, as I said, he is a tremendous player and has an unbelievable record,” added Gopinath. “I think he’ll come good. He’s a very good player and he has got the confidence and the reflexes to do well in this World Cup and in the future.”\n\nWith Kohli’s recent century, his 47th in ODIs, rekindled the debate about whether he could match Tendulkar’s record of 100 international hundreds, Gopinath wasn’t sure that was possible. “Whether Kohli will get 100 centuries, I am not sure,” he said. “With Sachin, I was sure because of his technique and temperament.”\n\nWhen the conversation shifted to India’s chances in the World Cup, Gopinath radiated boundless optimism. “I would say, a 70 per cent chance of winning the World Cup,” he said confidently. He stressed the need for key batters to play their parts, recognising the need for calculated risks in a format where even totals of 350 are no longer safe.\n\nBefore concluding the interview, Gopinath had a heartfelt message for the batters representing India, who will encounter various conditions across nine different cities during this demanding tournament. “I would say, the batsmen should play to the needs of the team, depending on the score, the conditions, and what the team needs in that particular situation,” he said. “You can’t hit every ball. If you have scored 150 runs, then you can afford to unleash every shot, without fear of getting out. However, if your score is a vulnerable 170-6, then you must tread cautiously. You have to bat as per the requirements of the moment. That’s all I would say.”"
