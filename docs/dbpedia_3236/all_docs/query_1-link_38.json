        "text": "Relevant topic for early career / #Life IMHO - thank you Agnes Jose for this nudge. My take - start as early as possible so one gets to explore and create a unique #lifepath. My younger son just got his email ID activated at 13 years of age - I would encourage him to explore LinkedIn between 13-15 years ðŸ˜Ž. Sharing a relevant TED talk to support this rationale in comments #TalentConnect #Talent #careerpath #Collaboration\n\nFor #responsiblefreedom to create any impact, the core of what humans call #work should be linked to that humanâ€™s #purpose. #WorkFromHome #Freedom #talentConnect\n\nFriends and connections - Do Check this out on LinkedIn Learning! I have made it free for you with the link below. #teammanagement #NeuroScience #BrainScience\n\nThe last two decades have given us more options to use advances within Science, especially those relating to human brain, for influencing human behaviour itself. Glad to see that Linkedin has curated a set of courses around #Neuroscience. Hereâ€™s what I thought of my most recent #LinkedInLearning course.\n\nOur #TalentConnect team at SS Consulting Kochi are #hiring for these roles with our clients. Know anyone who would be a good fit? #KeralaITJobs #TechTalent #KochiJobs #JobsInKochi #Talent\n\nReceived this in my #Twitter spam messages today and got me thinking. Will this have takers? Will a #purpose oriented entrepreneur want to do this kind of approach to growth? Love to hear from my LinkedIn connections and followers.
