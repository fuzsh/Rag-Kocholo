Adam\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSmall bore (R8 size) hybrid ball bearings made with 60NiTi races and silicon nitride balls are under development for highly corrosive aerospace applications that are also exposed to heavy static (shock) loads. The target application is the vacuum pump used inside the wastewater recycling system on the International Space Station. To verify bearing longevity, life tests are run at 2000rpm for time periods up to 5000 hours. Accelerometers with data tracking are used to monitor operation and the bearings are disassembled and inspected at intervals to assess wear. Preliminary tests show that bearings made from 60NiTi are feasible for this aerospace and potentially other industrial applications that must endure similar operating environments.\n\nRolling-element fatigue life of silicon nitride balls: Preliminary test results\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParker, R. J.; Zaretsky, E. V.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nHot pressed silicon nitride was evaluated as a rolling element bearing material. The five-ball fatigue tester was used to test 12.7 mm (0.500 in.) diameter balls at a maximum Hertz stress of 800,000 psi at a race temperature of 130 F. The fatigue spalls in the silicon nitride resembled those in typical bearing steels. The ten-percent fatigue life of the silicon nitride balls was approximately one-eighth to one-fifth that of typical bearing steels (52100 and M-50). The load capacity of the silicon nitride was approximately one-third that of typical bearing steels. The load capacity of the silicon nitride was significantly higher than previously tested ceramic materials for rolling element bearings.\n\nBall clay\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVirta, R.L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFour companies â H.C. Spinks Clay Co., Inc., Imerys, Old Hickory Clay Co. and Unimin Corp. â mined ball clay in five U.S. states in 2012. Production, on the basis of preliminary data, was 900 kt (992,000 st), with an estimated value of $42.3 million. This was a slight increase in tonnage from 886 kt (977,000 st), with a value of $40.9 million in 2011. Tennessee was the leading ball clay producing state, with 63 percent of domestic production, followed by Texas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Indiana. Reported ball clay production from Indiana probably was fire clay rather than ball clay. About 69 percent of total ball clay production was airfloat, 20 percent was crude and 11 percent was water-slurried.\n\nStructure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-Number (SOFBALL): Preliminary Results From the STS-83 and STS-94 Space Flight Experiments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRonney, Paul D.; Wu, Ming-Shin; Pearlman, Howard G.; Weiland, Karen J.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nResults from the Structure Of Flame Balls At Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL) space flight experiment conducted on the MSL-1 Space Shuttle missions are reported. Several new insights were obtained, including: much lower buoyancy-induced drift speed than anticipated pre-flight; repulsion of adjacent flame balls due to their mutual interaction; remarkable sensitivity of flame balls to small accelerations resulting from Orbiter attitude control maneuvers; and very similar net heat release for all flame balls in all mixtures tested. Comparison of experimental results to computational predictions reveals limitations in current models of H2-02 chemistry for very lean mixtures. It is discussed how the results of these space experiments may provide an improved understanding of the interactions of the two most important phenomena in combusting materials, namely chemical reaction and transport processes, in the unequivocally simplest possible configuration.\n\nPreliminary metallographic studies of ball fatigue under rolling-contact conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBear, H Robert; Butler, Robert H\n\n1957-01-01\n\nThe metallurgical results produced on balls tested in the rolling-contact fatigue spin rig were studied by metallographic examination. Origin and progression of fatigue failures were observed. These evaluations were made on SAE 52100 and AISI M-1 balls fatigue tested at room temperature (80 F) and 200 to 250 F. Most failures originated subsurface in shear; inclusions, structure changes, and directionalism adversely affected ball fatigue life. Structures in the maximum-shear-stress region of the balls of both materials were stable at room temperature and unstable at 200 to 250 F. Failures were of the same type as those found in full-scale bearings.\n\nEnhancement of perfluoropolyether boundary lubrication performance: I. Preliminary results\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJones, W. R., Jr.; Ajayi, O. O.; Goodell, A. J.; Wedeven, L. D.; Devine, E.; Premore, R. E.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA ball bearing simulator operating under starved conditions was used to evaluate the boundary lubrication performance of a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) Krytox 143 AB. Several approaches to enhance boundary lubrication were studied. These included: (1) soluble boundary additives, (2) bearing surface modifications, (3) 'run-in' surface films, and (4) ceramic bearing components. In addition, results were compared with two non-perfluorinated liquid lubricant formulations. Based on these preliminary tests, the following tentative conclusions can be made: (1) substantial improvements in boundary lubrication performance were observed with a beta-diketone boundary additive and a tricresyl phosphate (TCP) liquid surface pretreatment; (2) the use of rough Si3N4 balls (Ra = 40 micro-in) also provided substantial improvement but with concomitant abrasive wear; (3) marginal improvements were seen with two boundary additives (a phosphine and a phosphatriazine) and a neat (100%) fluid (a carboxylic acid terminated PFPE); and surface pretreatments with a synthetic hydrocarbon, a PTFE coating, and TiC coated 440C and smooth Si3N4 balls (R(sub a) less than 1 micro-in); and (4) two non-PFPE lubricant formulations (a PAO and a synthetic hydrocarbon) yielded substantial improvements.\n\nA kicking simulator to investigate the foot-ball interaction during a rugby place kick.\n\nPubMed\n\nMinnaar, Nick; van den Heever, Dawie J\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFoot-ball interaction is an important aspect in rugby place kicking but has received very little attention in literature. This preliminary study presents an adjustable mechanical kicking simulator used to investigate different foot positions and orientations during the foot-ball interaction on resultant ball motion. It was found that changes in foot position and orientation during ball contact can have a large influence on ball motion. It is believed that with further research an optimal place-kicking technique can be found to maximize energy transfer to the ball while still maintaining accuracy.\n\nResults of the NIST National Ball Plate Round Robin.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaskey, G W; Phillips, S D; Borchardt, B R\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis report examines the results of the ball plate round robin administered by NIST. The round robin was part of an effort to assess the current state of industry practices for measurements made using coordinate measuring machines. Measurements of a two-dimensional ball plate (240 mm by 240 mm) on 41 coordinate measuring machines were collected and analyzed. Typically, the deviations of the reported X and Y coordinates from the calibrated values were within Â± 5 Î¼m, with some coordinate deviations exceeding 20.0 Î¼m. One of the most significant observations from these data was that over 75 % of the participants failed to correctly estimate their measurement error on one or more of the ball plate spheres.\n\nPreliminary results on passive eddy current damper technology for SSME turbomachinery\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCunningham, R. E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nSome preliminary results have been obtained for the dynamic response of a rotor operating over a speed range of 800 to 10,000 rpm. Amplitude frequency plots show the lateral vibratory response of an unbalanced rotor with and without external damping. The mode of damping is by means of eddy currents generated with 4 c shaped permanent magnets installed at the lower bearing of a vertically oriented rotor. The lower ball bearing and its damper assembly are totally immersed in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -197 deg C (-320 deg F). These preliminary results for a referenced or base line passive eddy current damper assembly show that the amplitude of synchronous vibration is reduced at the resonant frequency. Measured damping coefficients were calculated to phi = .086; this compares with a theoretically calculated value of phi = .079.\n\n75 FR 2108 - Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-01-14\n\n...-804, A-412-801] Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom: Extension of Time Limit for Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews AGENCY... reviews of the antidumping duty orders on ball bearings and parts thereof from France, Germany, Italy...\n\n76 FR 2647 - Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-01-14\n\n...-804, A-412-801] Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom: Extension of Time Limit for Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews AGENCY... administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on ball bearings and parts thereof from France, Germany...\n\n75 FR 26920 - Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-05-13\n\n...

Studies have shown that repetitive heading could lead to degeneration of brain cells, which is similarly found in patients with mild traumatic brain injury. A two-degree of freedom linear mathematical model was developed to study the impact of soccer ball to the brain during ball-to-head impact in soccer. From the model, the acceleration of the brain upon impact can be obtained. The model is a mass-spring-damper system, in which the skull is modelled as a mass and the neck is modelled as a spring-damper system. The brain is a mass with suspension characteristics that are also defined by a spring and a damper. The model was validated by experiment, in which a ball was dropped from different heights onto an instrumented dummy skull. The validation shows that the results obtained from the model are in a good agreement with the brain acceleration measured from the experiment. This findings show that a simple linear mathematical model can be useful in giving a preliminary insight on what human brain endures during a ball-to-head impact.\n\nApplication of the Blobo bluetooth ball in wrist rehabilitation training\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHsieh, Wei-Min; Hwang, Yuh-Shyan; Chen, Shih-Ching; Tan, Sun-Yen; Chen, Chih-Chen; Chen, Yu-Luen\n\n2016-01-01\n\n[Purpose] The introduction of emerging technologies such as the wireless Blobo bluetooth ball with multimedia features can enhance wrist physical therapy training, making it more fun and enhancing its effects. [Methods] Wrist injuries caused by fatigue at work, improper exercise, and other conditions are very common. Therefore, the reconstruction of wrist joint function is an important issue. The efficacy of a newly developed integrated wrist joint rehabilitation game using a Blobo bluetooth ball with C# software installed was tested in wrist rehabilitation (Flexion, Extension, Ulnar Deviation, Radial Deviation). [Results] Eight subjects with normal wrist function participated in a test of the systemâs stability and repeatability. After performing the Blobo bluetooth ball wrist physical therapy training, eight patients with wrist dysfunction experienced approximately 10Â° improvements in range of motion (ROM) of flexion extension, and ulnar deviation and about 6Â° ROM improvement in radial deviation. The subjects showed progress in important indicators of wrist function. [Conclusion] This study used the Blobo bluetooth ball in wrist physical therapy training and the preliminary results were encouraging. In the future, more diverse wrist or limb rehabilitation games should be developed to meet the needs of physical therapy training.

Recent studies have shown some differences in swing timing and movement coordination, when a player faces a ball projection machine as opposed to a human opponent. We focused on the time of movement initiation and on stroke timing during returning tennis serves (simulated by a ball machine or by a real server). Receiversâ movements were measured on a tennis court. In spite of using a serving ball speed from 90 kph to 135 kph, results showed significant differences in movement initiation and backswing duration between serves received from a ball machine and serves received from a real server. Players had shorter movement initiation when they faced a ball machine. Backswing duration was longer for the group using a ball machine. That demonstrates different movement timing of tennis returns when players face a ball machine. Use of ball machines in tennis practice should be limited as it may disrupt stroke timing. Key points Players have shorter initial move time when they are facing the ball machine. Using the ball machine results in different swing timing and movement coordination. The use of the ball machine should be limited.

The ball screw stop is mounted on the ball screw proximate the first end to translate therewith. The ball screw stop engages the ball nut when the ball screw is in the extend position, translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging the ball nut, and prevents further rotation of the ball screw upon translating the predetermined distance.\n\nBall Screw Actuator Including a Compliant Ball Screw Stop\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWingett, Paul T.

The types of ball possession are classified as Individual Ball Possession (IBC), Individual Ball Action (IBA), Individual Ball Control (IBC), Team Ball Possession (TBP), Team Ball Control (TBC) und Team Playmaking (TPM) according to different starting points and endpoints and the type of ball control involved. The machine learning approach used is able to determine how long the ball spends in the sphere of influence of a player based on the distance between the players and the ball together with their direction of motion, speed and the acceleration of the ball. The degree of ball control exhibited during this phase is classified based on the spatio-temporal configuration of the player controlling the ball, the ball itself and opposing players using a Bayesian network. The evaluation and application of this approach uses data from 60 matches in the German Bundesliga season of 2013/14, including 69,667 IBA intervals. The identification rate was F = .88 for IBA and F = .83 for IBP, and the classification rate for IBC was Îº = .67. Match analysis showed the following mean values per match: TBP 56:04 Â± 5:12 min, TPM 50:01 Â± 7:05 min and TBC 17:49 Â± 8:13 min. There were 836 Â± 424 IBC intervals per match and their number was significantly reduced by -5.1% from the 1st to 2nd half. The analysis of ball possession at the player level indicates shortest accumulated IBC times for the central forwards (0:49 Â± 0:43 min) and the longest for goalkeepers (1:38 Â± 0:58 min), central defenders (1:38 Â± 1:09 min) and central midfielders (1:27 Â± 1:08 min). The results could improve performance analysis in soccer, help to detect match events automatically, and allow discernment of higher value tactical structures, which is based on individual ball possession.

In this paper, we propose an estimation system for 3D ball motion, including speed and angle of projection, by using acoustic vector and infrared (IR) scanning sensors. Our system is comprised of three steps to estimate a ball motion: sound-based ball firing detection, sound source localization, and IR scanning for motion analysis. First, an impulsive sound classification based on the mel-frequency cepstrum and feed-forward neural network is introduced to detect the ball launch sound. An impulsive sound source localization using a 2D microelectromechanical system (MEMS) microphones and delay-and-sum beamforming is presented to estimate the firing position. The time and position of a ball in 3D space is determined from a high-speed infrared scanning method. Our experimental results demonstrate that the estimation of ball motion based on sound allows a wider activity area than similar camera-based methods. Thus, it can be practically applied to various simulations in sports such as soccer and baseball.\n\nReexamination of Ball-Race Conformity Effects on Ball Bearing Life\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZaretsky, Erwin V.; Poplawski, Joseph V.; Root, Lawrence E.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe analysis in this report considers the life of the ball set as well as the respective lives of the races to reassess the effect of ball-race conformity on ball bearing life. The related changes in ball bearing life are incorporated in life factors that can be used to modify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO Standards. Two simple algebraic relationships were established to calculate life factors LF(sub c) to determine the effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L(sub 10) life for deepgroove and angular-contact ball bearings, respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact ball bearings, the life can vary between +16 and -39 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Comparing the two ball bearing types, the life factors LF(sub c) for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for angular-contact ball bearings.\n\nModeling of Particle Acceleration at Multiple Shocks Via Diffusive Shock Acceleration: Preliminary Results\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParker, Linda Neergaard; Zank, Gary P.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe present preliminary results from a model that diffusively accelerates particles at multiple shocks. Our basic approach is related to box models (Protheroe and Stanev, 1998; Moraal and Axford, 1983; Ball and Kirk, 1992; Drury et al., 1999) in which a distribution of particles is diffusively accelerated inside the box while simultaneously experiencing decompression through adiabatic expansion and losses from the convection and diffusion of particles outside the box (Melrose and Pope, 1993; Zank et al., 2000). We adiabatically decompress the accelerated particle distribution between each shock by either the method explored in Melrose and Pope (1993) and Pope and Melrose (1994) or by the approach set forth in Zank et al. (2000) where we solve the transport equation by a method analogous to operator splitting. The second method incorporates the additional loss terms of convection and diffusion and allows for the use of a variable time between shocks. We use a maximum injection energy (Emax) appropriate for quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular shocks (Zank et al., 2000, 2006; Dosch and Shalchi, 2010) and provide a preliminary application of the diffusive acceleration of particles by multiple shocks with frequencies appropriate for solar maximum (i.e., a non-Markovian process).\n\nBall motion and sliding friction in an arched outer-race ball bearing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamrock, B. J.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe motion of the ball and sliding friction in an arched outer-race ball bearing under thrust load is analyzed. Fatigue life evaluations were made. The analysis is applied to a 150-millimeter-bore ball bearing. The results indicated that for high-speed light-load applications the arched bearing has significant improvement in fatigue life over that of a conventional bearing. An arching of 0.254 mm (0.01 in.) was found to be optimal. Also, for an arched bearing a considerable amount of spinning occurs at the outer-race contacts.\n\nBall Aerospace Long Life, Low Temperature Space Cryocoolers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGlaister, D. S.; Gully, W.; Marquardt, E.; Stack, R.\n\n2004-06-01\n\nThis paper describes the development, qualification, characterization testing and performance at Ball Aerospace of long life, low temperature (from 4 to 35 K) space cryocoolers. For over a decade, Ball has built long life (>10 year), multi-stage Stirling and Joule-Thomson (J-T) cryocoolers for space applications, with specific performance and design features for low temperature operation. As infrared space missions have continually pushed for operation at longer wavelengths, the applications for these low temperature cryocoolers have increased. The Ball cryocooler technologies have culminated in the flight qualified SB235 Cryocooler and the in-development 6 K NASA/JPL ACTDP (Advanced Cryocooler Technology Development Program) Cryocooler. The SB235 and its model derivative SB235E are 2-stage coolers designed to provide simultaneous cooling at 35 K (typically, for Mercury Cadmium Telluride or MCT detectors) and 100 K (typically, for the optics) and were baselined for the Raytheon SBIRS Low Track Sensor. The Ball ACTDP cooler is a hybrid Stirling/J-T cooler that has completed its preliminary design with an Engineering Model to be tested in 2005. The ACTDP cooler provides simultaneous cooling at 6 K (typically, for either doped Si detectors or as a sub-Kelvin precooler) and 18 K (typically, for optics or shielding). The ACTDP cooler is under development for the NASA JWST (James Webb Space Telescope), TPF (Terrestrial Planet Finder), and Con-X (Constellation X-Ray) missions. Both the SB235 and ACTDP Coolers are highly leveraged off previous Ball space coolers including multiple life test and flight units.\n\nBall valve extractor\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHerndon, Charles; Brown, Roger A.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAn apparatus and process for removing a ball valve is provided. The ball valve removal tool provides a handle sliding along the length of a shaft. One end of the shaft is secured within an interior cavity of a ball valve while the opposite end of the shaft defines a stop member. By providing a manual sliding force to the handle, the handle impacts the stop member and transmits the force to the ball valve. The direction of the force is along the shaft of the removal tool and disengages the ball valve from the ball valve housing.\n\nBall clay\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVirta, R.L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nPart of the 1999 Industrial Minerals Review. The state of the ball clay industry in 1999 is presented. Record highs in the sales and use of ball clay were attained in 1999 due to the continued strength of the U.S. economy. U.S. production was estimated at 1.25 million st for the year, with more than half of that amount mined in Tennessee. Details of the consumption, price, imports, and exports of ball clay in 1999 and the outlook for ball clay over the next few years are provided.\n\nBall motion and sliding friction in an arched outer race ball bearing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamrock, B.

H. B. S.; Aziz, M. H. A.; Ong, N. R.; Sauli, Z.; Alcain, J. B.; Retnasamy, V.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe ball grid array (BGA), a form of chip scale package (CSP), was developed as one of the most advanced surface mount devices, which may be assembled by an ordinary surface ball bumps are used instead of plated nickel and gold (Ni/Au) bumps. Assembly and reliability of the BGA's printed circuit board (PCB), which is soldered by conventional surface mount technology is considered in this study. The Ceramic Ball Grid Array (CBGA) is a rectangular ceramic package or square-shaped that will use the solder ball for external electrical connections instead of leads or wire for connections. The solder balls will be arranged in an array or grid at the bottom of the ceramic package body. In this study, ANSYS software is used to investigate the stress on the package for 2 balls and 4 balls of the CBGA package with the various force range of 1-3 Newton applied to the top of the die, top of the substrate and side of the substrate. The highest maximum stress was analyzed and the maximum equivalent stress was observed on the solder ball and the die. From the simulation result, the CBGA package with less solder balls experience higher stress compared to the package with many solder balls. Therefore, less number of solder ball on the CBGA package results higher stress and critically affect the reliability of the solder balls itself, substrate and die which can lead to the solder crack and also die crack.\n\nBall clay\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVirta, Robert L.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe article reports on the global market performance of ball clay in 2009 and presents an outlook for its 2010 performance.

In addition to the first discovery of autochthonous coal-balls in the Foord Seam, Nova Scotia, its shale parting also contains hypautochthonous coal-balls with histologically preserved plant structures. The coal-ball discovery helps fill a stratigraphic gap in coal-ball occurrences in the upper Carboniferous (Bolsovian) of Euramerica. The autochthonous and hypautochthonous coal-balls have a similar mineralogical composition and are composed of siderite (81-100%), dolomite-ankerite (0-19%), minor quartz and illite, and trace amounts of 'calcite'. Similar is also their permineralizing mineralogy, which consists of dolomite-ankerite and siderite. Their low pyrite content and carbonate mineralogy, and nonmarine origin, differentiates the Foord Seam coal-balls from other Euramerican coal-ball occurrences. A preliminary geochemical model, which is based on oxygen and carbon isotopic data, indicates that siderite in both the autochthonous and hypautochthonous coal-balls is of very early diagenetic (nonmarine) origin from 13C-enriched bicarbonate derived from bacterial methanogenesis of organic matter.\n\nDevelopment of CMOS MEMS inductive type tactile sensor with the integration of chrome steel ball force interface\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYeh, Sheng-Kai; Chang, Heng-Chung; Fang, Weileun\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis study presents an inductive tactile sensor with a chrome steel ball sensing interface based on the commercially available standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process (the TSMC 0.18 Âµm 1P6M CMOS process). The tactile senor has a deformable polymer layer as the spring of the device and no fragile suspended thin film structures are required. As a tactile force is applied on the chrome steel ball, the polymer would deform. The distance between the chrome steel ball and the sensing coil would changed. Thus, the tactile force can be detected by the inductance change of the sensing coil. In short, the chrome steel ball acts as a tactile bump as well as the sensing interface. Experimental results show that the proposed inductive tactile sensor has a sensing range of 0-1.4âN with a sensitivity of 9.22(%/N) and nonlinearity of 2%. Preliminary wireless sensing test is also demonstrated. Moreover, the influence of the process and material issues on the sensor performances have also been investigated.\n\nExperimental evaluation of 150-millimeter bore ball bearing to 3 million DN using either solid or drilled balls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nScibbe, H. W.; Munson, H. E.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nSeven 150-mm bore ball bearings were run under 8900 Newton (2000 lb) thrust load at speeds from 6670 to 20,000 rpm (1 to 3 million DN). Four of the bearings had conventional solid balls and three bearing had drilled (cylindrically hollow) balls with 50 percent mass reduction. The bearings were under-race cooled and slot-lubricated with Type 2 ester oil at flow rates from 4.35 to 5.80 liters per minute (1.15 to 1.57 gal min). Friction torque and temperatures were measured on all bearings. No significant difference in torque was noted, between the solid and drilled ball bearings. One bearing of each type was rerun at 17,800 Newtons (4000 lb) thrust load. The solid ball bearings performed satisfactorily at 3 million DN. However, at about 2 million DN the drilled ball bearing experienced a broken ball and cracks appeared in two other balls as the result of flexure fatigue. Metallurgical examination of the cracked balls indicated a brittle structure in the bore of the drilled balls.\n\nHaving a Ball with Fitness Balls\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcNulty, Betty\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFitness programs can be greatly enhanced with the addition of fitness balls.

New application of springs increases reliability of equipment in which ball screws commonly used. Set of three springs within lower screw of ball-screw mechanism absorbs impacts that result when parts reach their upper and lower limits of movement. Mechanism designed with Belleville springs as shock-absorbing elements because springs have good energy-to-volume ratio and easily stacked to attain any stiffness and travel.\n\nExperimental evaluation of stresses in spherically hollow balls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNypan, L.

Strain gage rosettes were used to determine principal strains and stresses in the steel ball models statically loaded in various orientations. Dimensionless results are reported for the balls under flate plate contact loads. Similitude considerations permit these results to be applied to calculate stresses in hollow ball bearings proportioned to these mass reductions.\n\nStemless ball valve\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurgess, Kevin (Inventor); Yakos, David (Inventor); Walthall, Bryan (Inventor)\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA stemless ball valve comprising: a right flange; left flange; ball with an axis pin and two travel pins; ball seal on either side of the ball; guide sleeve with inner walls comprising two channels; cartridge guide holder; inner magnetic cartridge; and outer magnetic cartridge. The ball is situated inside of the guide sleeve, and a travel pin is located in each of the two channels. The guide sleeve is situated inside of the cartridge guide holder, which is located adjacent to and outside of the inner magnetic cartridge and secured to the inner magnetic cartridge such that when the inner magnetic cartridge rotates, the cartridge guide holder also rotates. The cartridge guide holder is secured to the guide sleeve such that when the cartridge guide holder rotates, the travel pins move within the channels in the inner walls of the guide sleeve, thereby causing the ball to rotate.\n\nEffect of soccer shoe upper on ball behaviour in curve kicks\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIshii, Hideyuki; Sakurai, Yoshihisa; Maruyama, Takeo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nNew soccer shoes have been developed by considering various concepts related to kicking, such as curving a soccer ball. However, the effects of shoes on ball behaviour remain unclear. In this study, by using a finite element simulation, we investigated the factors that affect ball behaviour immediately after impact in a curve kick. Five experienced male university soccer players performed one curve kick. We developed a finite element model of the foot and ball and evaluated the validity of the model by comparing the finite element results for the ball behaviour immediately after impact with the experimental results. The launch angle, ball velocity, and ball rotation in the finite element analysis were all in general agreement with the experimental results. Using the validated finite element model, we simulated the ball behaviour. The simulation results indicated that the larger the foot velocity immediately before impact, the larger the ball velocity and ball rotation. Furthermore, the Young's modulus of the shoe upper and the coefficient of friction between the shoe upper and the ball had little effect on the launch angle, ball velocity, and ball rotation. The results of this study suggest that the shoe upper does not significantly influence ball behaviour.

C.; CÃ¢rlescu, V.; Olaru, D. N.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe authors investigated experimentally and theoretically the friction torque in a modified thrust ball bearing having only 3 balls operating at low axial load and lubricated with NGLI-00 and NGLI-2 greases. The experiments were made by using spin-down methodology and the results were compared with the theoretical values based on Biboulet&Houpert's rolling friction equations. Also, the results were compared with the theoretical values obtained with SKF friction model adapted for 3 balls. A very good correlation between experiments and Biboulet_&_Houpert's predicted results was obtained for the two greases. Also was observed that the theoretical values for the friction torque calculated with SKF model adapted for a thrust ball bearing having only 3 balls are smaller that the experimental values.\n\nFatigue life of high-speed ball bearings with silicon nitride balls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParker, R. J.; Zaretsky, E. V.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nHot-pressed silicon nitride was evaluated as a rolling-element bearing material. The five-ball fatigue tester was used to test 12.7-mm- diameter silicon nitride balls at maximum Hertz stresses ranging from 4.27 x 10 to the 9th power n/sq m to 6.21 x 10 to the 9th power n/sq m at a race temperature of 328K. The fatigue life of NC-132 hot-pressed silicon nitride was found to be equal to typical bearing steels and much greater than other ceramic or cermet materials at the same stress levels. A digital computer program was used to predict the fatigue life of 120-mm- bore angular-contact ball bearings containing either steel or silicon nitride balls. The analysis indicates that there is no improvement in the lives of bearings of the same geometry operating at DN values from 2 to 4 million where silicon nitride balls are used in place of steel balls.\n\nRespiratory disease in ball pythons (Python regius) experimentally infected with ball python nidovirus.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoon-Hanks, Laura L; Layton, Marylee L; Ossiboff, Robert J; Parker, John S L; Dubovi, Edward J; Stenglein, Mark D\n\n2018-04-01\n\nCircumstantial evidence has linked a new group of nidoviruses with respiratory disease in pythons, lizards, and cattle. We conducted experimental infections in ball pythons (Python regius) to test the hypothesis that ball python nidovirus (BPNV) infection results in respiratory disease. Three ball pythons were inoculated orally and intratracheally with cell culture isolated BPNV and two were sham inoculated. Antemortem choanal, oroesophageal, and cloacal swabs and postmortem tissues of infected snakes were positive for viral RNA, protein, and infectious virus by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot and virus isolation. Clinical signs included oral mucosal reddening, abundant mucus secretions, open-mouthed breathing, and anorexia. Histologic lesions included chronic-active mucinous rhinitis, stomatitis, tracheitis, esophagitis and proliferative interstitial pneumonia. Control snakes remained negative and free of clinical signs throughout the experiment. Our findings establish a causal relationship between nidovirus infection and respiratory disease in ball pythons and shed light on disease progression and transmission. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

The design employs NASA's aerodynamics technology analysis of air loads of the tank and Shuttle orbiter that was performed under the Space Shuttle External Tank program. According to Wilson, this technology provides 'the most symmetrical ball surface available, sustaining initial velocity longer and producing the most stable ball flight for unmatched accuracy and distance.' The dimples are in three sizes, shapes and depths mathematically positioned for the best effect. The selection of dimples and their placement optimizes the interaction of opposing forces of lift and drag. Large dimples reduce air drag, enhance lift, and maintain spin for distance. Small dimples prevent excessive lift that destabilizes the ball flight and the medium size dimples blend the other two.\n\nEffect of ball geometry on endurance limit in bending of drilled balls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMunson, H.

Adam; Thomas, Fransua; Stanford, Malcolm K.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRolling element bearings made from highly-elastic intermetallic materials (HIM)s, such as 60NiTi, are under development for applications that require superior corrosion and shock resistance. Compared to steel, intermetallics have been shown to have much lower rolling contact fatigue (RCF) stress capability in simplified 3-ball on rod (ASTM STP 771) fatigue tests. In the 3-ball tests, poor material quality and microstructural flaws negatively affect fatigue life but such relationships have not been established for full-scale 60NiTi bearings. In this paper, 3-ball-on-rod fatigue behavior of two quality grades of 60NiTi are compared to the fatigue life of full-scale 50mm bore ball bearings made from the same materials. 60NiTi RCF rods with material or microstructural flaws suffered from infant mortality failures at all tested stress levels while high quality 60NiTi rods exhibited no failures at lower stress levels. Similarly, tests of full-scale bearings made from flawed materials exhibited early surface fatigue and through crack type failures while bearings made from high quality material did not fail even in long-term tests. Though the full-scale bearing test data is yet preliminary, the results suggest that the simplified RCF test is a good qualitative predictor of bearing performance. These results provide guidance for materials development and to establish minimum quality levels required for successful bearing operation and life.\n\nBall Bearing Mechanics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHamrock, Bernard J.; Dowson, Duncan\n\n1981-01-01\n\nLoad-deflection relationships for different types of elliptical contacts such as those found in a ball bearing are developed.

Ball bearings subjected to radial, thrust and combined ball loads are analyzed. A design criterion for fatigue life of ball bearings is developed. The section of a satisfactory lubricant, as well as describing systems that provide a constant flow of lubricant to the contact, is considered.\n\nModeling of Particle Acceleration at Multiple Shocks Via Diffusive Shock Acceleration: Preliminary Results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParker, L. N.; Zank, G. P.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nSuccessful forecasting of energetic particle events in space weather models require algorithms for correctly predicting the spectrum of ions accelerated from a background population of charged particles. We present preliminary results from a model that diffusively accelerates particles at multiple shocks. Our basic approach is related to box models (Protheroe and Stanev, 1998; Moraal and Axford, 1983; Ball and Kirk, 1992; Drury et al., 1999) in which a distribution of particles is diffusively accelerated inside the box while simultaneously experiencing decompression through adiabatic expansion and losses from the convection and diffusion of particles outside the box (Melrose and Pope, 1993; Zank et al., 2000). We adiabatically decompress the accelerated particle distribution between each shock by either the method explored in Melrose and Pope (1993) and Pope and Melrose (1994) or by the approach set forth in Zank et al. (2000) where we solve the transport equation by a method analogous to operator splitting. The second method incorporates the additional loss terms of convection and diffusion and allows for the use of a variable time between shocks. We use a maximum injection energy (Emax) appropriate for quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular shocks (Zank et al., 2000, 2006; Dosch and Shalchi, 2010) and provide a preliminary application of the diffusive acceleration of particles by multiple shocks with frequencies appropriate for solar maximum (i.e., a non-Markovian process).\n\nFluid Mechanics of Cricket and Tennis Balls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMehta, Rabindra D.\n\n2009-11-01\n\nAerodynamics plays a prominent role in defining the flight of a ball that is struck or thrown through the air in almost all ball sports. The main interest is in the fact that the ball can often deviate from its initial straight path, resulting in a curved, or sometimes an unpredictable, flight path. It is particularly fascinating that that not all the parameters that affect the flight of a ball are always under human influence. Lateral deflection in flight, commonly known as swing, swerve or curve, is well recognized in cricket and tennis. In tennis, the lateral deflection is produced by spinning the ball about an axis perpendicular to the line of flight, which gives rise to what is commonly known as the Magnus effect. It is now well recognized that the aerodynamics of sports balls are strongly dependent on the detailed development and behavior of the boundary layer on the ball's surface. A side force, which makes a ball curve through the air, can also be generated in the absence of the Magnus effect. In one of the cricket deliveries, the ball is released with the seam angled, which trips the laminar boundary layer into a turbulent state on that side. The turbulent boundary layer separates relatively late compared to the laminar layer on the other side, thereby creating a pressure difference and hence side force. The fluid mechanics of a cricket ball become very interesting at the higher Reynolds numbers and this will be discussed in detail. Of all the round sports balls, a tennis ball has the highest drag coefficient. This will be explained in terms of the contribution of the ``fuzz\" drag and how that changes with Reynolds number and ball surface wear. It is particularly fascinating that, purely through historical accidents, small disturbances on the ball surface, such as the stitching on cricket balls and the felt cover on tennis balls are all about the right size to affect boundary layer transition and development in the Reynolds numbers of interest.

One end of each axis and travel pin is fixedly attached to the ball, and the other end of each axis pin is lodged into a notch in the first or second flange such that the axis pin is allowed to rotate in the notch. The guide sleeve comprises two channels, and one end of each travel pin is situated within one of the two channels in the guide sleeve. An outer magnetic cartridge causes the inner magnetic cartridge and guide sleeve to rotate, and when the guide sleeve rotates, the travel pins move up and down within the channels in the guide sleeve. The movement of the travel pins within the channels in the guide sleeve causes the ball to rotate, thereby opening and closing the ball valve.\n\nThe relationships between impact location and post-impact ball speed, bat torsion, and ball direction in cricket batting.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeploe, C; McErlain-Naylor, S A; Harland, A R; King, M A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThree-dimensional kinematic data of bat and ball were recorded for 239 individual shots performed by twenty batsmen ranging from club to international standard. The impact location of the ball on the bat face was determined and assessed against the resultant instantaneous post-impact ball speed and measures of post-impact bat torsion and ball direction. Significant negative linear relationships were found between post-impact ball speed and the absolute distance of impact from the midline medio-laterally and sweetspot longitudinally. Significant cubic relationships were found between the distance of impact from the midline of the bat medio-laterally and both a measure of bat torsion and the post-impact ball direction. A \"sweet region\" on the bat face was identified whereby impacts within 2 cm of the sweetspot in the medio-lateral direction, and 4.5 cm in the longitudinal direction, caused reductions in ball speed of less than 6% from the optimal value, and deviations in ball direction of less than 10Â° from the intended target. This study provides a greater understanding of the margin for error afforded to batsmen, allowing researchers to assess shot success in more detail, and highlights the importance of players generating consistently central impact locations when hitting for optimal performance.\n\nQuartz ball valve\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGoetz, C.; Ingle, W. M. (Inventor)\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA ball valve particularly suited for use in the handling of highly corrosive fluids is described. It is characterized by a valve housing formed of communicating segments of quartz tubing, a pair of communicating sockets disposed in coaxial alignment with selected segments of tubing for establishing a pair of inlet ports communicating with a common outlet port, a ball formed of quartz material supported for displacement between the sockets and configured to be received alternately thereby, and a valve actuator including a rod attached to the ball for selectively displacing the ball relative to each of the sockets for controlling fluid flow through the inlet ports.\n\nBall bearing heat analysis program (BABHAP)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThe Ball Bearing Heat Analysis Program (BABHAP) is an attempt to assemble a series of equations, some of which are non-linear algebraic systems, in a logical order, which when solved, provide a complex analysis of load distribution among the balls, ball velocities, heat generation resulting from friction, applied load, and ball spinning, minimum lubricant film thickness, and many additional characteristics of ball bearing systems. Although initial design requirements for BABHAP were dictated by the core limitations of the PDP 11/45 computer, (approximately 8K of real words with limited number of instructions) the program dimensions can easily be expanded for large core computers such as the UNIVAC 1108. The PDP version of BABHAP is also operational on the UNIVAC system with the exception that the PDP uses 029 punch and the UNIVAC uses 026. A conversion program was written to allow transfer between machines.\n\nBall-morph: definition, implementation, and comparative evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhited, Brian; Rossignac, Jaroslaw Jarek\n\n2011-06-01\n\nWe define b-compatibility for planar curves and propose three ball morphing techniques between pairs of b-compatible curves. Ball-morphs use the automatic ball-map correspondence, proposed by Chazal et al., from which we derive different vertex trajectories (linear, circular, and parabolic). All three morphs are symmetric, meeting both curves with the same angle, which is a right angle for the circular and parabolic. We provide simple constructions for these ball-morphs and compare them to each other and other simple morphs (linear-interpolation, closest-projection, curvature-interpolation, Laplace-blending, and heat-propagation) using six cost measures (travel-distance, distortion, stretch, local acceleration, average squared mean curvature, and maximum squared mean curvature). The results depend heavily on the input curves. Nevertheless, we found that the linear ball-morph has consistently the shortest travel-distance and the circular ball-morph has the least amount of distortion.\n\nPreliminary Results of a New Auxiliary Mechatronic Near-Field Radar System to 3D Mammography for Early Detection of Breast Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhanbarzadeh Dagheyan, Ashkan; Molaei, Ali; Obermeier, Richard; Westwood, Andrew; Martinez, Aida; Martinez Lorenzo, Jose Angel\n\n2018-01-25\n\nAccurate and early detection of breast cancer is of high importance, as it is directly associated with the patients' overall well-being during treatment and their chances of survival. Uncertainties in current breast imaging methods can potentially cause two main problems: (1) missing newly formed or small tumors; and (2) false alarms, which could be a source of stress for patients. A recent study at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) indicates that using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) can reduce the number of false alarms, when compared to conventional mammography. Despite the image quality enhancement DBT provides, the accurate detection of cancerous masses is still limited by low radiological contrast (about 1%) between the fibro-glandular tissue and affected tissue at X-ray frequencies. In a lower frequency region, at microwave frequencies, the contrast is comparatively higher (about 10%) between the aforementioned tissues; yet, microwave imaging suffers from low spatial resolution. This work reviews conventional X-ray breast imaging and describes the preliminary results of a novel near-field radar imaging mechatronic system (NRIMS) that can be fused with the DBT, in a co-registered fashion, to combine the advantages of both modalities. The NRIMS consists of two antipodal Vivaldi antennas, an XY positioner, and an ethanol container, all of which are particularly designed based on the DBT physical specifications. In this paper, the independent performance of the NRIMS is assessed by (1) imaging a bearing ball immersed in sunflower oil and (2) computing the heat Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) due to the electromagnetic power transmitted into the breast. The preliminary results demonstrate that the system is capable of generating images of the ball. Furthermore, the SAR results show that the system complies with the standards set for human trials. As a result, a configuration based on this design might be suitable for use in realistic clinical\n\nHow Magnus Bends the Flying Ball--Experimenting and Modeling\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTimkovÃ¡, V.; JeÅ¡kovÃ¡, Z.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudents are well aware of the effect of the deflection of sports balls when they have been given a spin.

Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number-2 (SOFBALL-2)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRonney, Paul; Weiland, Karen J.; Over, Ann (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nEveryone knows that an automobile engine wastes fuel and energy when it runs with a fuel-rich mixture. 'Lean' burning, mixing in more air and less fuel, is better for the environment. But lean mixtures also lead to engine misfiring and rough operation. No one knows the ultimate limits for lean operation, for 'weak' combustion that is friendly to the environment while still moving us around. This is where the accidental verification of a decades-old prediction may have strong implications for designing and running low-emissions engines in the 21st century. In 1944, Soviet physicist Yakov Zeldovich predicted that stationary, spherical flames are possible under limited conditions in lean fuel-air mixtures. Dr. Paul Ronney of the University of Southern California accidentally discovered such 'flame balls' in experiments with lean hydrogen-air mixtures in 1984 during drop-tower experiments that provided just 2.2 seconds of near weightlessness. Experiments aboard NASA's low-g aircraft confirmed the results, but a thorough investigation was hampered by the aircraft's bumpy ride. And stable flame balls can only exist in microgravity. The potential for investigating combustion at the limits of flammability, and the implications for spacecraft fire safety, led to the Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number (SOFBALL) experiment flown twice aboard the Space Shuttle on the Microgravity Sciences Laboratory-1 (MSL-1) in 1997. Success there led to the planned reflight on STS-107. Flame balls are the weakest fires yet produced in space or on Earth. Typically each flame ball produced only 1 watt of thermal power. By comparison, a birthday candle produces 50 watts. The Lewis-number measures the rate of diffusion of fuel into the flame ball relative to the rate of diffusion of heat away from the flame ball. Lewis-number mixtures conduct heat poorly. Hydrogen and methane are the only fuels that provide low enough Lewis-numbers to produce stable flame balls, and even then only for\n\nPurification of Tronoh Silica Sand via preliminary process of mechanical milling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nH, Nazratulhuda; M, Othman\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe purification of Tronoh silica sand is an important step in expanding technical applications of this silica sand. However no research on purifying of Tronoh silica sand has been reported. This study is focused on ball milling technique as a preliminary technique for Tronoh silica sand purification. The objectives are to study the effect of ball milling to the purification of the silica sand and to analyze its characteristics after the ball milling process. The samples before and after milling process were analyzed by using XRF, XRD, SEM and TEM. Results showed that the purity of SiO2 was increased, the size of the particles has been reduced and the surface area has increased. The crystalline phases for the silica before and after 4 hour milling time were remained constant.\n\nCeramic Rail-Race Ball Bearings\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBalzer, Mark A.; Mungas, Greg S.; Peters, Gregory H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNon-lubricated ball bearings featuring rail races have been proposed for use in mechanisms that are required to function in the presence of mineral dust particles in very low-pressure, dry environments with extended life. Like a conventional ball bearing, the proposed bearing would include an inner and an outer ring separated by balls in rolling contact with the races. However, unlike a conventional ball bearing, the balls would not roll in semi-circular or gothic arch race grooves in the rings: instead, the races would be shaped to form two or more rails (see figure). During operation, the motion of the balls would push dust particles into the spaces between the rails where the particles could not generate rolling resistance for the balls\n\nTracking of Ball and Players in Beach Volleyball Videos\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGomez, Gabriel; Herrera LÃ³pez, Patricia; Link, Daniel; Eskofier, Bjoern\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper presents methods for the determination of players' positions and contact time points by tracking the players and the ball in beach volleyball videos. Two player tracking methods are compared, a classical particle filter and a rigid grid integral histogram tracker. Due to mutual occlusion of the players and the camera perspective, results are best for the front players, with 74,6% and 82,6% of correctly tracked frames for the particle method and the integral histogram method, respectively. Results suggest an improved robustness against player confusion between different particle sets when tracking with a rigid grid approach. Faster processing and less player confusions make this method superior to the classical particle filter. Two different ball tracking methods are used that detect ball candidates from movement difference images using a background subtraction algorithm. Ball trajectories are estimated and interpolated from parabolic flight equations. The tracking accuracy of the ball is 54,2% for the trajectory growth method and 42,1% for the Hough line detection method. Tracking results of over 90% from the literature could not be confirmed. Ball contact frames were estimated from parabolic trajectory intersection, resulting in 48,9% of correctly estimated ball contact points.

It is very time-consuming. To solve this problem, a method based on coordinate transformation between machine system and object system is presented. With the fixed points' coordinates of the ball plate measured in the object system and machine system, the transformation matrix between the coordinate systems is calculated. The laser interferometer measurement data error due to the placement of ball plate can be corrected with this transformation matrix. Experimental results indicate that this method is consistent with the handy adjustment method. It avoids the complexity of ball plate adjustment. It also can be applied to the ball beam calibration.\n\nDetonator-activated ball shutter\n\nDOEpatents\n\nMcWilliams, R.A.; Holle, W.G. von.\n\n1983-08-16\n\nA detonator-activated ball shutter for closing an aperture in about 300[mu] seconds.

Adam; Thomas, Fransua; Stanford, Malcolm K.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRolling element bearings made from highly-elastic intermetallic materials (HIM)s, such as 60NiTi, are under development for applications that require superior corrosion and shock resistance. Compared to steel, intermetallics have been shown to have much lower rolling contact fatigue (RCF) stress capability in simplified 3-ball on rod (ASTM STP 771) fatigue tests. In the 3-ball tests, poor material quality and microstructural flaws negatively affect fatigue life but such relationships have not been established for full-scale 60NiTi bearings. In this paper, 3-ball-on-rod fatigue behavior of two quality grades of 60NiTi are compared to the fatigue life of full-scale 50mm bore ball bearings made from the same materials. 60NiTi RCF rods with material or microstructural flaws suffered from infant mortality failures at all tested stress levels while high quality 60NiTi rods exhibited no failures at lower stress levels. Similarly, tests of full-scale bearings made from flawed materials exhibited early surface fatigue and through crack type failures while bearings made from high quality material did not fail even in long-term tests. Though the full-scale bearing test data is yet preliminary, the results suggest that the simplified RCF test is a good qualitative predictor of bearing performance. These results provide guidance for materials development and to establish minimum quality levels required for successful bearing operation and life.\n\nTwo Balls' Collision of Mass Ratio 3:1\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOgawara, Yasuo; Hull, Michael M.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nStudents will sometimes ask why momentum and kinetic energy concepts are both necessary. When physics teachers demonstrate situations that require both an understanding of kinetic energy and momentum, a favorite is Newton's cradle, or a comparable demonstration of two balls of equal mass hitting each other. However, in addition to the case of two balls of equal mass, if a ball hits another ball of three times the mass with equal speed, the results are also interesting, and, like the equal-mass demonstration, both kinetic energy and momentum are critical for understanding the motion.\n\nHow Magnus Bends the Flying Ball - Experimenting and Modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTimkovÃ¡, V.; JeÅ¡kovÃ¡, Z.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nStudents are well aware of the effect of the deflection of sports balls when they have been given a spin. A volleyball, tennis, or table tennis ball served with topspin results in an additional downward force that makes the ball difficult to catch and return. In soccer, the effect of sidespin causes the ball to curve unexpectedly sideways, resulting in a so-called banana kick that can confuse the goalkeeper. These surprising effects attract students' attention such that the motion of sports balls can be used to capture the interest of students towards the physics behind it. However, to study and analyze the motion of a real ball kicked in a playfield is not an easy task. Instead of the large-scale full-size sports ball motion, there can be designed and studied simpler experiments that can be carried out in the classroom. Moreover, digital technologies that are available at schools enable students to collect data from the experiment easily in a reasonable time. The mathematical model based on the analysis of forces acting on the ball flying in the air can be used to simulate the motion in order to understand the basic physical principles of the motion so that the best correspondence may be found.\n\nEffect of Hoop Stress on Ball Bearing Life Prediction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZaretsky, Erwin V.; August, Richard; Coe, Harold H.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA finite-element analysis (FEA) of a generic, dimensionally normalized inner race of an angular-contact ball bearing was performed under varying conditions of speed and the press (or interference) fit of the inner-race bore on a journal. The FEA results at the ball-race contact were used to derive an equation from which was obtained the radius of an equivalent cylindrical bearing race with the same or similar hoop stress. The radius of the equivalent cylinder was used to obtain a generalized closed-form approximation of the hoop stresses at the ball-inner-race contact in an angular-contact ball bearing. A life analysis was performed on both a 45- and a 120-mm-bore, angular-contact ball bearing. The predicted lives with and without hoop stress were compared with experimental endurance results obtained at 12000 and 25000 rpm with the 120-mm-bore ball bearing. A life factor equation based on hoop stress is presented.\n\n76 FR 22372 - Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-04-21\n\n...In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on ball bearings and parts thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for the period May 1, 2009, through April 30, 2010. We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below normal value by certain companies subject to these reviews. We have also preliminarily determined that Schaeffler Technologies GmbH & Co. KG is the successor- in-interest to Schaeffler KG with respect to the order on ball bearings and parts thereof from Germany. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

Another common objective is to hit the ball so that it spins as fast as possible, since the trajectory of the ball through the air is strongly affected by ball spin. In an attempt to enhance both the coefficient of restitution (COR) and the spin of a golf ball, I conducted several experiments to see what would happen when a 45-g, 42.8-mm diameter golf ball bounced on: (a) a 58-mm diameter, 103-g Super BallÂ®; (b) an 8-mm thick, 56-mm diameter circular disk of Super Ball material cut from a large Super Ball and glued to a 3.4-kg lead brick; and (c) a 3-mm thick sheet of rubber glued to a 3.4-kg lead brick.

The detection of 0.2-mm-diameter shot balls in gas-cooled turbine blades is possible for thermal neutron radiography. A tagging processing is more useful for a distinctive image of newer turbine blades. Areas of concern for the tagging process include the solution concentration and the possibility of a slight washing of the blades. The location of the shot balls within the turbine blades tagged with Gd((2%, 5%)+water) was shown. Shot balls were placed externally on a turbine blade (F100-700, F100-200) surface in order to check for a dead zone from a surface examination. The image is produced from neutron radiography after a 5 min exposure time. When the blade is tagged with 2% and 5% Gd with slight washing, the shot can also be effectively seen on the SR-45 film. Shot balls are more obvious on a neutron image SR-45 film than an image plate or a DR film.\n\nBall Collision Experiments\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCross, R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nExperiments are described on collisions between two billiard balls and between a bat and a ball.

M.; Triapriani, Y.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this present work, the grinding balls from high chromium white cast iron (ASTM A-532) were produced by using sand mold-gravity casting. The simulation casting process was conducted before making these grinding balls by using SOLIDCastâ¢ version 8.2.0. The gating system design and the pouring temperature of hot metal were investigated clearly to obtain grinding balls with no-defect. The sound casting of grinding balls was resulted by using the proper gating system with the addition of vent air on the top of each grinding ballâs mold. The dimension of vent air was reduced by the increasing of pouring temperature, thus it resulted on the increasing of the yield production of grinding balls.\n\nAtmospheric Tar Balls: Particles from Biomass and Biofuel Burning\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPosfai, Mihaly; Gelencser, Andras; Simonics, Renata; Arato, Krisztina; Li, Jia; Hobbs, Peter V.; Buseck, Peter R.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTar balls are amorphous, carbonaceous spherules that occur in the tropospheric aerosol as a result of biomass and biofuel burning. They form a distinct group of particles with diameters typically between 30 and 500 nm and readily identifiable with electron microscopy. Their lack of a turbostratic microstructure distinguishes them from soot, and their morphology and composition (approximately 90 mol% carbon) renders them distinct from other carbonaceous particles. Tar balls are particularly abundant in slightly aged (minutes to hours old) biomass smoke, indicating that they likely form by gas-to-particle conversion within smoke plumes. The material of tar balls is initially hygroscopic; however, the particles become largely insoluble as a result of free radical polymerization of their organic molecules. Consequently, tar balls are primarily externally mixed with other particle types, and they do not appreciably increase in size during aging. When tar balls coagulate with water-bearing particles, their material may partly dissolve and no longer be recognizable as distinct particles. Tar balls may contain organic compounds that absorb sunlight. They are an important, previously unrecognized type of carbonaceous (organic) atmospheric particle.\n\nThe effects of ball size distribution on attritor efficiency\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCook, T. M.; Courtney, T. H.\n\n1995-09-01\n\nA study was undertaken to determine how media dynamics are altered when differently sized grinding balls are used in an attritor. Cinematographic techniques identify the extent of segregation/mixing of the differently sized balls within the attritor as a function of impeller rotational velocity and small ball number fraction. This permits determination of rotational velocities needed to most efficiently use the tactic of milling with differently sized media. Cinematographic observations show that the close-packed media array, assumed when balls of the same size are used for milling, is disrupted when differently sized balls are used. Monitoring powder particle numbers as a function of milling time for the situations when the same and differently sized balls are used can be used to assess relative milling efficiencies. Results indicate powder deformation, fracture, and welding are enhanced through employment of differently sized balls. This conclusion is reinforced by observations of microstructural characteristics of powder processed with the different type of media.\n\nAerodynamics of sports balls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMehta, R. D.\n\nResearch data on the aerodynamic behavior of baseballs and cricket and golf balls are summarized. Cricket balls and baseballs are roughly the same size and mass but have different stitch patterns. Both are thrown to follow paths that avoid a batter's swing, paths that can curve if aerodynamic forces on the balls' surfaces are asymmetric. Smoke tracer wind tunnel tests and pressure taps have revealed that the unbalanced side forces are induced by tripping the boundary layer on the seam side and producing turbulence. More particularly, the greater pressures are perpendicular to the seam plane and only appear when the balls travel at velocities high enough so that the roughness length matches the seam heigh. The side forces, once tripped, will increase with spin velocity up to a cut-off point. The enhanced lift coefficient is produced by the Magnus effect. The more complex stitching on a baseball permits greater variations in the flight path curve and, in the case of a knuckleball, the unsteady flow effects. For golf balls, the dimples trip the boundary layer and the high spin rate produces a lift coefficient maximum of 0.5, compared to a baseball's maximum of 0.3. Thus, a golf ball travels far enough for gravitational forces to become important.\n\nAerodynamics of sports balls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMehta, R.

Twenty-two adolescent soccer players were tested in juggling a soccer ball and in the control of an approaching ball at a pre, post and retention test. The participants were randomly divided in a small ball size and bigger ball size training group that both trained four times per week for 6 weeks. At the post and retention test both groups enhanced performance in soccer juggling test with no difference between groups and no increase in ball reception performance at these tests. It was concluded that about intra task transfer and retention of soccer juggling skills, it does not matter if you increase (small balls) or decrease the difficulty (larger balls) when using the same amount of practice time within the skill acquisition phase in soccer juggling. In addition that for ball juggling and ball reception (inter task) these two tasks differ too much in afferent information and movement characteristics that no positive transfer between these two skills no positive intertask transfer can be expected.\n\nRelativistic-microwave theory of ball lightning.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, H-C\n\n2016-06-22\n\nBall lightning, a fireball sometimes observed during lightnings, has remained unexplained. Here we present a comprehensive theory for the phenomenon: At the tip of a lightning stroke reaching the ground, a relativistic electron bunch can be produced, which in turn excites intense microwave radiation. The latter ionizes the local air and the radiation pressure evacuates the resulting plasma, forming a spherical plasma bubble that stably traps the radiation. This mechanism is verified by particle simulations. The many known properties of ball lightning, such as the occurrence site, relation to the lightning channels, appearance in aircraft, its shape, size, sound, spark, spectrum, motion, as well as the resulting injuries and damages, are also explained. Our theory suggests that ball lighting can be created in the laboratory or triggered during thunderstorms. Our results should be useful for lightning protection and aviation safety, as well as stimulate research interest in the relativistic regime of microwave physics.\n\nRelativistic-microwave theory of ball lightning\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, H.-C.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nBall lightning, a fireball sometimes observed during lightnings, has remained unexplained.

The many known properties of ball lightning, such as the occurrence site, relation to the lightning channels, appearance in aircraft, its shape, size, sound, spark, spectrum, motion, as well as the resulting injuries and damages, are also explained. Our theory suggests that ball lighting can be created in the laboratory or triggered during thunderstorms. Our results should be useful for lightning protection and aviation safety, as well as stimulate research interest in the relativistic regime of microwave physics.\n\nRelativistic-microwave theory of ball lightning\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWu, H.-C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBall lightning, a fireball sometimes observed during lightnings, has remained unexplained. Here we present a comprehensive theory for the phenomenon: At the tip of a lightning stroke reaching the ground, a relativistic electron bunch can be produced, which in turn excites intense microwave radiation. The latter ionizes the local air and the radiation pressure evacuates the resulting plasma, forming a spherical plasma bubble that stably traps the radiation. This mechanism is verified by particle simulations. The many known properties of ball lightning, such as the occurrence site, relation to the lightning channels, appearance in aircraft, its shape, size, sound, spark, spectrum, motion, as well as the resulting injuries and damages, are also explained.

Spinks Clay, Kentucky-Tennessee Clay and Old Hickory Clay. In 2006, an estimated 1.2 million tons of the mineral was sold or used domestically and exported. Forty-percent of the total sales is accounted for ceramic floo"
