He contributed a quick 35 in the final Test of that series when India recorded its first Test victory. He toured England in 1952 and completely failed with the bat. At home he played Tests against Pakistan in 1952/53 and Australia in 1959/60, and toured Pakistan in 1954/55. He was chosen in the team to West Indies in 1952/53 but turned down the invitation."
