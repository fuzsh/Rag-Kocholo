        "text": "Welcome to the September edition of the COMA newsletter. A week after the COMA grand Onam celebrations, I am still feeling a sense of excitement and exhilaration. It was an absolute success, and a testament to the meticulous planning by the COMA Executive Committee and the enthusiasm of the event volunteers. The celebrations embodied the true spirit of Onam – bringing people together to celebrate traditions and camaraderie.\n\nThe athapookkalams were a sight to behold, and transformed the venue into a visual delight. Members adorned in traditional attire like kasavu sarees and mundu enhanced the visual spectacle of the celebrations. The sadhya was a culinary treat with an array of authentic dishes including delectable payasams and boli, all served in fresh banana leaves.\n\nOur chief guest Prof. Gopinath Muthukad truly shone as a beacon of altruism and selflessness. His ability to rally people together for his cause is extraordinary, and his unwavering commitment to the cause of differently abled children in Kerala is an inspiration to all of us.\n\nThe chenda melam team from Detroit drummed up a storm and kept us on the edge of our seats. The performance was nothing short of extraordinary and left us all in awe and deeply proud of our rich Malayalee cultural heritage. The event’s entertainment selection was a blend of traditional and contemporary music and dance performances, ensuring everyone had an enjoyable experience. The MC team did a great job ensuring the event ran smoothly, and most importantly keeping the audience fully engaged.\n\nThe Onam event was a roaring success encapsulating the spirit and tradition of Onam, and creating an opportunity for charitable giving, raising an incredible amount for a very worthy cause. Thank you COMA EC 2023 for the dedication and passion that made this Onam an unforgettable celebration for all of us.\n\nCOMA officials handing over the first check to Prof. Muthukad.\n\nഓർമ്മിക്കാൻ ഒരു അമേരിക്കൻ ഓണം – Suprabha Arimbassery\n\n(Suprabha hails from Valayanchirangara, Ernakulam. She is currently in Columbus, Ohio visiting her daughter Anjana Nair and family.)\n\nഎക്കാലത്തെയും നല്ല ഓർമ്മയായി മനസ്സിൽ സൂക്ഷിക്കാൻ ഒരോണവും കൂടി. നാട്ടിലെ ഓണപ്പരിപാടികൾ നഷ്ടമായെന്നോർത്ത് അമേരിക്കയിലെത്തിയ ഞങ്ങൾക്ക് ഇവിടുത്തെ ഓണാഘോഷങ്ങളിൽ പങ്കെടുക്കുവാൻ ഭാഗ്യമുണ്ടായി. വളരെ സന്തോഷകരമായ കാര്യം തന്നെ. ആഘോഷപരിപാടികൾ കാണുവാനായി ഒരു സ്കൂളിൻടെ ഓഡിറ്റോറിയത്തിൽ എത്തിയപ്പോൾ കേരളത്തിലെ ഒരു ആഘോഷത്തിലെത്തിയ പ്രതീതി. എല്ലായിടത്തും മലയാളത്തനിമയാർന്ന വേഷവിധാനങ്ങളും സംഭാഷണ ശകലങ്ങളും, പരിചയപ്പെടലുകളും പരിചയപ്പെടുത്തലുകളുമായി സ്നേഹബന്ധങ്ങൾ പരിപോഷിപ്പിക്കുന്ന നമ്മുടെ കൂട്ടുകാർ. അല്പസ്വല്പം പരിചയപ്പെടലുകൾക്കു ശേഷം കണ്ട പൂക്കളം വർണവിസ്മയം തീർത്തു. പ്രകൃതിദത്തമായ പൂക്കളാൽ അണിയിച്ചൊരുക്കിയ രണ്ട് വലിയ പൂക്കളങ്ങൾ വളരെ മനോഹരം.\n\nഅതു കഴിഞ്ഞ് ഒന്നാന്തരം ഓണസദ്യ. കേരളീയ സമ്പ്രദായത്തിൽ വാഴയിലയിൽ പപ്പടം, പഴം, പായസം ഇവ കൂട്ടി ഓണസദ്യ കഴിച്ച ശേഷം ഓഡിറ്റോറിയത്തിനകത്തേയ്ക്കു കയറിയപ്പോൾ കണ്ടത് – ഉത്സവപ്പറമ്പിലാണോ എന്ന് തോന്നുമാറ് ഒരാന. നെറ്റിപ്പട്ടം കെട്ടി, കോലം വച്ച് – വളരെ നന്നായിരുന്നു ആ കാഴ്ച. തുടർന്ന് ചെണ്ടമേളത്തിന്റെയും പുലികളിയുടെയും അകമ്പടിയോടെ മാവേലിത്തമ്പുരാൻടെ എഴുന്നള്ളത്ത്. മാവേലിത്തമ്പുരാൻടെ വരവും എതിരേല്പ്പും താളാത്മകമായി കൊട്ടിക്കയറിയ ചെണ്ടമേളവും സദസ്സിനെ ഗൃഹാതുരത്വത്തിന്റെ തലത്തിലേക്കുയർത്തി.\n\nവിശിഷ്ടാതിഥിയായെത്തിയ ശ്രീ ഗോപിനാഥ് മുതുകാടിനൻടെ ഉത്‌ഘാടനപ്രസംഗം ഗതകാല സ്മരണകളെ ഉണർത്തുന്ന ഒന്നായിരുന്നു. തുടർന്ന്‌, കലാപരിപാടികളുടെ ഒരു വേലിയേറ്റം തന്നെയായിരുന്നു. ഓണപ്പാട്ടും, തിരുവാതിരകളിയും, കൊച്ചുകുരുന്നുകളുടെ ഫാഷൻ ഷോയും, ക്ലാസിക്കൽ, സിനിമാറ്റിക് ഡാൻസ്, മ്യൂസിക് ബാൻഡ് ഫ്യൂഷൻ, കവിതാലാപനം തുടങ്ങിയവ കൊണ്ട് കുറേ സമയം വേറൊരു ലോകത്ത് എല്ലാം മറന്നിരുന്നുപോയി. ഓണോത്സവത്തെ ശ്ലാഖിച്ചുകൊണ്ടുള്ള ഒഹായോ സ്റ്റേറ്റ് സെക്രട്ടറിയുടെ സന്ദേശം കേട്ടപ്പോൾ വളരെ സന്തോഷം തോന്നി.\n\nഇത്ര ഭംഗിയായി ഇതവതരിപ്പിക്കാൻ ചുക്കാൻ പിടിച്ച COMA ഭാരവാഹികൾക്കും, അർപ്പണബോധത്തോടെ ചിട്ടയായ പരിശീലനവും, പരിശീലിപ്പിക്കലും നടത്തിയ അംഗങ്ങൾക്കും കുട്ടികൾക്കും, എല്ലാത്തിനും എല്ലാ പിന്തുണയുമായി നിൽക്കുന്ന എല്ലാ കുടുംബാംഗങ്ങൾക്കും എത്ര നന്ദി പറഞ്ഞാലും മതിയാകില്ല. കൂട്ടായ പ്രവർത്തനത്തിൻടെ പ്രതിഫലനമാണ് ഇത്രയും നല്ലൊരു ദൃശ്യ ശ്രാവ്യ വിസ്മയ കാഴ്ച. ഇതാസ്വദിക്കാൻ അവസരം ലഭിച്ചതിന് വളരെ അധികം നന്ദി, സന്തോഷം.\n\nMy trek to the Annapurna Base Camp – Deepa Jayabalan Menon\n\n(Deepa Menon among her friends and family is best known for someone who is always living on the edge, loves travel, adventure sports, trekking, and diving (underwater and sky). On a sunny nice day she can be found hiking, and is always working on her next bucket list item.)\n\nTrekking to Annapurna Base Camp… it was indeed one of the beautiful decisions of my life.\n\nI leave a part of myself to the Himalayas every time I visit her. Himalayan ranges are my all time high; it gives a unique energy to reach and to be around her in spite of all the difficulties, tough terrains, and multiple days of walking.\n\nIt was an amazing experience to walk through the distinct landscape full of rich mountains, terraced fields, peculiar Gurung and Thakali villages, and the diverse variety of flora and fauna. The trail goes with gradual and steep ascents and descents alongside terraced rice paddies, lush rhododendron forests, and high altitude landscapes.\n\nNearly all of the villages to Annapurna Base Camp are the ethnic communities of Gurung and Thakali. We were able to find a few tea houses spread through the villages. These tea houses are the go to places to discuss and exchange notes with local villagers and tourists from other countries. Interacting with the staff, guides, and porters on the trail gave us a glimpse into their way of life and above all enjoy the traditional Nepalese style local dishes and tea.\n\nAs we were gradually moving towards the base camp through the villages, the vegetation shifted from tropical forests to alpine terrain with grasslands on rocky mountains. It was monsoon season so the sky was never clear and it rained daily. I would call it a monsoon and waterfall trek. I had multiple leeches biting me and we were always drenched in rain.\n\nThe last stretch to the Annapurna Base Camp was a walk on moraines. The evening we reached Machapuchare (base camp), the sky was not clear and we couldn’t see the mountain range, and we were disappointed. The locals said that this time of the year the sky is never clear and we may not be able to see anything.\n\nAnd then the miracle happened. At 3:30 AM the next day, we woke up looking at the clear sky, visible galaxies, and the vast Annapurna mountain ranges. No words could do justice to her serenity. She is majestic, magnificent, yet looks calm and beautiful. We were surrounded by the various peaks of Annapurna as well as other mountains like Gandharvachuli and Machapuchhre.\n\nThe knee pain, leech bites (blood loss), getting drenched, lack of sleep, high altitude sickness… everything just magically disappeared. The journey might have been strenuous and silent but in the end, I always have a beautiful story to narrate. 🙂\n\nOnam Meals-on-Wheels Marathon\n\nOn Sep 3rd, Sunday, COMA coordinated a Meals on Wheels marathon by delivering 5 routes in tandem, including 16 volunteers, both adults and youth. This is the 9th year since COMA started doing Meals on Wheels as a regular community activity, and given that this year’s Onam was primarily a fundraiser for Prof. Gopinath Muthukad’s charitable causes, it was proposed to kick off the Onam celebrations by doing a Meals on Wheels marathon. The invitations were sent out with very little notice but all 5 route slots were filled up within an hour of the announcement. Thank you to the volunteers who stepped up so very quickly.\n\nRoute Volunteers\n\nSmitha Sasindran, Sudeepa Pramod, Ramya Janaki, Ameya Pramod\n\nPramod Theckile Madathil, Roopesh Sathyan, Arnav Roopesh, Avnita Pramod\n\nNish Nishant, Pradeesh Puthiyattil, Shibu Nair\n\nSmitha Nishant, Deepa Jayabalan Menon, Yogalakshmi Venugopal\n\nArun Davis, Abel Davis, Nikhil Nair\n\nCheck out this short 2-minute video for a slideshow of photos from past route deliveries as well as brief interview clips with some of our youth volunteers from the marathon.\n\nOnam 2023 Media Links\n\nYouTube Videos (video credits – Pramod Pudhiyattil)\n\nEvent Photos (credits – Arun Davis, Sachin Sugathan, and Roopesh Sathyan)\n\nPhoto Booth pictures (credits – Arun Davis, Anish Manaliparambil, Issac Domini, and Retheesh Ravindran)\n\nCOMA Talks Onam Promo (produced by Girish Sasankasekhar)\n\nCandid and pre-event snaps (credits – Rahul Vishnu)\n\nWe are about half way through the summer and I hope everyone’s having a good time enjoying picnics and barbecues and fireworks. While we were lucky enough to escape extreme heat and floods here in Ohio, we have had quite a few days with air quality issues due to the Canadian wildfires.

Jose and Arun Davis, and he lives in Dublin, Ohio. He will be going to 7th grade in Henry Karrer Middle School in the fall. His favorite hobbies are reading books, fishing, and playing on the Nintendo Switch.)\n\nHello, my name is Loki. Although you might not recognize my name as one you have heard many times before as the name of a wolf, you have probably heard some of my nicknames: The Big Bad Wolf, Fenris, Old Father Wolf, Werewolf, Wolfie, Death, Wolf, etc. Does it ring a bell? If not, then you are simply not normal. I am the infamous and notorious wolf who ate the moon, the one that demolished and destroyed two houses by just blowing them over, the one that ate the boy that cried “wolf”, the one that ate a grandma and came up with the genius plan to dress up like her in order to devour the little girl in the red hood who came to offer treats to her! I am the BIG. BAD. WOLF.\n\nNow that my dramatic introduction is finished, let me tell you about my current situation. Because I am the Big Bad Wolf (BBW), I have had to take blame for many of the crimes I have been fabled to commit. Of course, because of all of the crimes I have been said to have committed, I have been arrested and entitled for a lifetime in prison. As though that were not enough, the humans and animals that captivated me further punished me by hiring an elite group of assassins to capture and murder every other wolf in existence so that they could make sure that they had tortured the right wolf. Worst of all, they decided that they would confiscate all my belongings, crush my den, and even throw my pups into the Volcano Of Doom while showing me the live video of them being thrown into the volcano. I was DEVASTATED.\n\nThe security guards in my prison even had the nerve to give away all my money to the three devilish boars and that blood stalking hoodie for the “trouble” I had caused. In reality, they had just framed me and had made stories, fables, and fairy tales with false information about me! They even took a video of me sneezing and a video of me dressed up as a grandma for Halloween just to Photoshop it and get false evidence of my “crimes”. And, the security guards around my prison thought it would be fun to force me to watch the footage of my pups being thrown into the volcano and having their life taken away from them every time it was time for me to go to my stone hard bed.\n\nIt has been five years since the day I was thrown into the nightmare of the life I am living, and the security guards thought it would be a great idea to celebrate by forcing me to listen to the screams of my pups as they were thrown one by one into the Volcano Of Doom throughout the entire day. Today, for breakfast, they gave me fish bones without a scrap of meat – just like they did for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; even though they knew that I am not a little dog that loves to chew on bones all day. After eating dinner, I pulled out the newspaper I got as a birthday gift five weeks ago from a stranger with a black hoodie that covered his face, named, Fauks. Strange, I felt like I somehow knew that name a long time ago before the day I was thrown into prison.\n\nAs I opened up the old newspaper, I noticed that there was a small box around the size of a phone hidden by the newspaper. As I opened the box, I wondered what could possibly have been gifted to a beast like me who has no living friends or family in this world. I looked inside and was taken by surprise by the fact that inside the box, there was a small key the size of a thumb. As I peered inside the box again, I noticed that there was also a shiny gold coin a little bigger than a quarter, a leatherback book with no words on the spine, the front, or the back of the book, a blood red pen, and a small roll of parchment addressed to me. I unrolled the roll of parchment and was astonished by what I saw in front of my eyes…\n\nSreejith Chandran’s Random Ramblings\n\n(One half of his brain has gone nomad and the other has gone in search of the first.

He lives in Lewis Center with wife Vijaya and two children, Hrishikesh and Niranjan. He hails from Kannur.)\n\nOn July 8th, Saturday, the Central Ohio Malayalee Association organized a thrilling canoeing event at Trapper John’s Canoe Livery, about 10 miles southwest of Columbus. With the promise of a picnic with an enticing Kerala-style “Pothichor” lunch, the event received significant attention and participation. A diverse group of enthusiastic participants, including young children, adults, and seniors joined to enjoy the experience. The group included long term residents of Central Ohio and someone who just moved in a couple of days earlier.\n\nTrapper John’s Canoe Livery served as the perfect venue for this adventurous outing. The previous day’s heavy rains had caused concerns about the event’s feasibility, and canoeing had been suspended. Organizers were closely monitoring and constantly in touch with Trapper Johns to provide updates to the participants. By Saturday morning, skies were clearer and we proceeded with the event as planned. Aware of the forecast predicting rain later in the day, the organizers aimed to complete the trip and enjoy the picnic and lunch before the weather changed.\n\nParticipants began assembling at the starting point in the morning, meeting old friends and making new friends. The chosen excursion was the “Sampler” trip, which takes one to two hours, covering approximately three miles of canoeing along Big Darby Creek. This trip starts at Trapper John’s and ends just before the I-71 bridges, where the participants are picked up and brought back to the starting point. As we had planned for the picnic at the end point, we drove there and parked our vehicles and came back to start canoeing.\n\nAt the booking office, the guides provided detailed instructions and warnings about safety measures. They stressed that individuals uncomfortable with the water level and flow conditions should refrain from canoeing or kayaking, especially due to the rain on the previous day. Most of the members proceeded with the plan; a few had to take care of small children as they were not allowed to be onboard a canoe.\n\nEquipped with paddles and life jackets, we formed groups of two, some with children, and embarked on our kayaks and canoes. Some brave souls opted to ride alone! For many participants, navigating the kayaks and canoes proved to be more challenging than expected. Novices struggled to manage and guide their vessels, often spinning around in the slow-moving water! However, the river was gentle and wide at the starting point, and offered ample space for the crowd to do some practice and find their rhythm. As we paddled along the slow-moving water, the crowd gradually thinned out. After some initial hiccups, people began enjoying the tranquility. The journey offered numerous opportunities for capturing cherished memories. The serene waters provided the perfect backdrop for photographs, allowing us to freeze moments!\n\nAs the journey progressed, there were more surprises! The river narrowed and deepened, and the water flow was faster at several places, challenging the paddlers. Rocks, fallen trees, and other obstacles along the way made controlling the canoes and kayaks increasingly difficult. The situation became worse for a few, as two people paddling at either ends of the canoe were not able to coordinate well. Some of us bumped into these blockers, causing the vessels to capsize, and leaving us in neck deep water. Fortunately, the mandatory life jackets saved us from serious problems, except minor scratches and bruises. Some canoes floated away after flipping, needing the rescue team from Trapper John’s to help bring the canoes back. Someone commented that the experience was closer to “whitewater rafting” but in a much safer environment!\n\nMost of the people reached the finish line by noon, but heavy rain began to pour soon after, threatening the picnic spirit. Some riders got stuck at different obstacles and were delayed finishing the ride. However, the enticing Kerala-style “Pothichor” provided a much-needed relief for the participants. We enjoyed the lunch under the shades of trees and inside our vehicles – while some curious children wandered around in the rain. Despite the inclement weather and some challenging situations, this event was an exciting experience and a lot of fun for the participants. Kudos to the executive committee for planning such an exciting and challenging event for the community!\n\nMember Achievements\n\nMalavika Nair becomes Golf Player of the Year\n\nShe achieved this amazing feat by winning all 8 Columbus municipal junior golf summer tournaments!

He has been part of the Central Ohio Malayalee community since 1995. Austin is an avid runner, hiker, and enjoys playing soccer as well as traveling to new and exciting destinations.)\n\nEach year, over 6 million visitors arrive to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. Fewer than 1 percent of them take the hike down to the bottom of the canyon, termed the Grand Canyon Rim to River to Rim hike. Last summer, myself and 12 other members of our community (Prabhu & Aarti Kumar, Jay & Deepa Menon, Ashish & Sangeetha Muthiraparambath, Shibu & Vidya Nair, Valsan & Vijaya Palika, Binoy Rappai, and Yoga Venugopal) decided to take up this challenge.\n\nThe Rim to River to Rim is a 17.5 mile hike completed in one day. The elevation drop to the bottom is approximately 5000 ft. It is an extremely challenging hike, since you have to hike down 5000 ft, and then hike back up 5000 ft when you are already tired. You must endure blistering heat of 100+ degrees F while hiking under direct sun. If a hiker is hurt or unable to walk further, the only way to be rescued from the canyon is through helicopter rescue. Thus the saying goes, “Going down is optional, but coming up is mandatory”. A lot is at stake taking a hike like this. In the ensuing months, we prepared for the hike physically, mentally, logistically, and gear wise.\n\nOn June 3rd, 2023, we embarked on this epic hike at 4:20 AM in the morning. As we went down the South Kaibab trail, the views were magnificent, with the early morning sun glistening the rocks, showing the majestic grandeur of the canyon. After 7 miles of hiking, we reached the forcefully gushing Colorado river at the bottom of the canyon and saw the famous Phantom Ranch. Many of us sent postcards from the ranch to family and friends, then ate our lunch, devoured the delicious lemonade at the Phantom Ranch Store, and rested.\n\nAs we started our climb back up, the canyon had already reached 100 degrees F, and the sun was blazing at our backs. The climb became strenuous, our bodies were running out of hydration, and the elevation was daunting. We took breaks to rest and hydrate. As we went further, it became even steeper. Looking up was demoralizing, since we saw how much more we had left to climb. It was a brutal and strenuous hike, but we took one step at a time, enjoyed the views in between, and the comradery of the team and the jokes made the hike easier.\n\nFinally, at 6 PM, we reached the top. We were physically beat up and drained. The canyon is unforgiving and it has surely humbled us, but we are awed by the beauty of nature’s art, and at the end, the feeling of finishing the hike was exhilarating. This has been a once in a lifetime experience for all of us!\n\nColumbus Tuskers Cricket Team are the Champions of Ohio! – Arun Chand\n\n(Arun Chand hails from Trivandrum and has been living in Dublin, OH since 2010. He is a sports enthusiast, and loves playing sports and games. He currently works for Cardinal Health.)\n\nThe Tuskers cricket team (the Malayali cricket team of Columbus) has won the inaugural Kairali Cincinnati Cricket Tournament 2023! The tournament was organized by Kairali Cincinnati, the Malayali organization serving Cincinnati and nearby areas. They have a very strong Malayali cricket community, and have a beautiful facility to conduct cricket tournaments.\n\nBackground – Tuskers team was thrilled when our incumbent COMA president and Tuskers comrade, Shibu Nair, told us about the invitation we received to participate in the Cincy cricket tournament. We were a bit concerned when we found out that many of the Tuskers players had already made vacation plans to India during the time. Hence, we reached out to a few of our fellow Malayali players (who play with other teams in Columbus), and all who were available eagerly committed to join us.\n\nVenue – The tournament was well organized in the sprawling Miami Meadows Park cricket grounds near Cincinnati, Ohio. The facility is fascinating, and has four full cricket grounds with prepared pitches. It’s also the home ground of the Cincinnati Malayali teams. The tournament comprised teams from various cities in Ohio.\n\nTournament day – Columbus Tuskers made travel plans to reach the ground (Miami Meadows) on time for our match. It was bright, sunny, and not too hot – a perfect day for cricket. We were greeted by the host team and spent the initial hour socializing and doing some practice, after our long drive early in the morning.\n\nThe tournament bracket was not favorable to the Columbus Tuskers team. Our first game was with the ‘Cincinnati Tuskers’ team (the best Malayali team in Cincy and also the host team). If we were to lose against them, we would have to beat the mighty ‘Cleveland Arikombans’ team next by a big margin to reach the finals.\n\nFirst match: When the match was about to start, the Cincy captain came to us and introduced himself. He was pleasing and confident, and casually advised us (in Malayalam) – ‘Our team has all professional players, and it’s going to be very tough out there (for you), don’t sweat it’! We were bewildered by that statement and laughed it off; but it indeed provoked us to give our best! The Cincy team won the toss and elected to bowl first. Our team has a strong and deep batting line up, and we made plans to score big. But things didn’t go as planned. The Cincy bowlers were really good (coupled with home conditions), and our batting collapsed. We managed to score a meager 61 runs in 10 overs, which we knew was well below par. We were dreading a humiliating defeat.\n\nThe Cincy team started off well by scoring 18 for no loss in 3 overs. Our bowlers fought back very hard, and they lost a few quick wickets. They started to crumble under the pressure. We won the close match by just 4 runs, and got boosted by the result.\n\nSecond match: We faced the losers of the other pool in the next round since we won our first match. It was an easy game for us since the opponent team was no match to our strength. We won by a huge margin and stormed into the finals.\n\nOther teams: ‘Cleveland Arikombans’ was a good team and had won their first match by a very big margin. The host, Cincy team, needed a big win over them to qualify for the finals. Their decider match was exciting, and the Cincy team managed to pull off a huge win to face us in the finals.\n\nThe FINALS: We had understood the pitch and ground conditions by then, and were well prepared for the finals. The host team tested our grit by serving us with a delicious biryani for lunch, which was hard to resist! We all started a bit dizzy after the break. The Cincy team won the toss and opted to bat first. They scored a decent total of 85 runs in 12 overs, thanks to some power hitting from their middle order batsmen. Our batsmen were better prepared, and chased down the total with a few balls to spare, and were never in any concern.\n\nWe had a lot of fun and enjoyment playing the tournament, and also made a few friends. We celebrated the victory after the prize distribution, and came back to Columbus with pride and satisfaction. A day well spent indeed!\n\nAbout the Tuskers cricket team – The Tuskers cricket team was formed in 2021 after a few years of concerted effort in bringing together Malayali cricket players in the Columbus area who were earlier playing for various other teams. The Tuskers team is now a regular participant in the Columbus area cricket tournaments, and has proven its prowess by reaching the finals of many tournaments, and has already beaten some of the top teams in Columbus!\n\nChar Dham trip – Visit to Yamunotri – Venu Nair\n\n(Venugopalan (Venu) Nair, a native of Kottarakara, Kerala migrated to the USA in 1975. He is currently retired (from American Electric Power in 2009), and lives in Westerville, Ohio with his wife Komalam. He has two sons and four grand children. Both sons along with their families live in Indianapolis.)\n\nAfter a day of visits to some holi places in Haridwar (Dakheswara Mahadeva temple, Swami Abhedananda ashram, glass temple complex, to name a few) and puja at Kankhal, we started the Himalayan tour on four buses. Our tour manager Mr. Krishnan Nair and tour guide Mr. Rajan gave us the protocols to be followed throughout the tour. Each bus could seat 30 people. Big buses can’t handle the narrow roads in the Himalayas. Rajan read the names allocated in each bus. All seven of us were in the same bus so we could be together for the rest of the trip.\n\nWe started the journey after a brief prayer. We found roads through the Himalayas were much improved compared to the last time we traveled through there a few years ago. We would stay in Barkot, which is 190 km away from Haridwar. We were following the Yamuna river most of the time.\n\nOn the way, we stopped a couple of times to stretch our legs and have breakfast and lunch. These were prepared by the kitchen staff early morning.\n\nWe passed through Dehradun, the capital city of the state of Utharkhand. On our way, we saw so many small shops carrying fresh fruits and vegetables on the road side. The beauty of the mountains started to show from there on, and we felt we were really in Devabhumi which is what the place was called. Since we started early morning, it was still dark outside. As sun started to show, the green foliage and deep valleys started to show. The river Yamuna could be seen as a silver tape at the bottom of the valley. We would cross it a few times as the road takes us from one hill to the next.\n\nWe reached Barkot in the evening around 5 pm. Barkot is a popular hill station near Uttarkashi, about 4000 feet above sea level. This is a town in the middle of thick forest and is a tourist place. This place is known for its natural beauty and challenging trekking trails. We stayed at a hotel in Barkot for the night.\n\nThe next day we started for Yamunotri. We traveled by bus up to a place called Janki Chatti. It’s elevation is 8700 feet. This place provides a panoramic view of the Himalayas with snow capped mountains. This place is 6 km form the Yamunotri temple.\n\nFrom here, we were to go to the temple by either walking, on horse back, or some one carrying us. As soon as the bus stooped, a throng of people surrounded us. They were trying to get us to go with their horses. It was all chaotic, I wish they had a better way. After some bargains, we selected a person who seemed very reasonable and friendly. He brought seven horses for the seven of us and four people to handle the seven horses. The pictures show us on horseback going up to the Yamunotri temple from Janki Chatti. It is 6 kms each way.\n\nAfter a long climb on the horseback, we reached the temple by noon. The ride on the horseback was very uncomfortable, more when we were coming down. It becomes more so when there are steps. There are two hot water pools, one for ladies and the other for men. We took a bath in the pool and got refreshed.\n\nThere is also a small pool near the temple where the water is much hotter. One can cook potatoes and rice in it and offer to the Devi and receive it back as prasad. The picture below shows us in front of the temple. It was taken after Darshan.\n\nOn the way back, we got down near a restaurant on the roadside and partook the packed lunch we carried with us. We also got down from the horse in between and walked some distance, which was good for both us as well as the poor horse. We came back to Barkot by evening and stayed there for the night.\n\nCommunity News\n\nYashoda Murali wins National Gold Medal\n\nCongratulations to New Albany High School Junior and COMA Youth Wing member Yashoda Murali for winning a National Gold Medal in the 2022 Scholastic Art and Writing Awards for her colored pencil drawing “Lady Hazel”.

Among those, the much dreaded final examinations and the much awaited end of school year, the beginning of venalavadhi, and the ushering in of our very own March Madness – the nostalgic maambazhakkaalam.\n\nMarch in the United States is the start of longer and warmer days. With spring breaks for schools and colleges, parents and children begin to realize the end of academic year is nearing. For families who are planning on spring break vacations, I hope you enjoy a carefree and relaxed schedule and come back refreshed and renewed!\n\nCOMA has been supporting the Meals on Wheels program for several years now, helping with their mission to deliver meals and friendly greetings to homebound seniors. Gayatri Thampy, one of our volunteers, has very graciously contributed a detailed writeup of her experience. If you were curious about what is involved in Meals on Wheels volunteering, her writeup gives you every little detail you will ever need to know.\n\nI hope all of our families have a safe and relaxing time during the upcoming spring break. For my friends who are observing Lent or Ramadan, I wish you all a blessed and fulfilling fasting season.\n\nSreejith Chandran’s Random Ramblings\n\n(One half of his brain has gone nomad and the other has gone in search of the first. Glorifying his random ramblings and packaging it is his main hobby! Otherwise sane and grounded.)\n\nഎന്തിനോ വേണ്ടി തിളയ്ക്കുന്ന സാമ്പാർ\n\nപിന്നിട്ടവഴികളിലൂടെ തിരിച്ചുപോകുമ്പോൾ …\n\nപുനർജനിക്കുന്ന പുൽക്കൊടികൾ …\n\nവീണ്ടും വിരിയുന്ന പൂക്കൾ …\n\nപതിയെ തളിർക്കുന്ന ഇലകൾ…\n\nപറയാൻ മറന്ന വാക്കുകൾ…\n\nനിസ്സംഗമായ നിന്റെ മന്ദഹാസം ….\n\nനഷ്ടസ്വപ്നങ്ങൾ …\n\nഒരു ജന്മത്തിന്റെ കാത്തിരുപ്പു …\n\nവരുമോ നിന്റെ നിശ്വാസം.\n\nVolunteering for Meals on Wheels – Gayatri Thampy\n\n(Dr. Gayatri Thampy is a former economic anthropologist and taught at Denison university until 2020.)\n\nMy family and I decided to volunteer for Meals on Wheels after Nish Nishant created a WhatsApp group to organize volunteers. Our daughter Sumitra needed volunteer hours for her school service record. We thought this would be a great opportunity to cover this school requirement.\n\nWe drove our first route on 25th of December, 2022. It took about 4.5 hours as the weather and driving conditions were really bad. Because of our experience in December, we decided to volunteer again in February. This time, it only took about 3.5 hours.\n\nThe task is quite simple. COMA delivers Meals on Wheels two Sundays per month. The volunteering family goes to the Meals on Wheels pick-up location at 670 Harmon Ave around 10:30 am. You drive into the farther parking lot and pick up a folder that lists your route number. Inside this folder, you will find sheets with addresses of the clients, along with details of meals each client is supposed to get. You then pick up two cases that have the same route number listed on them. One of them contains hot lunches and the other contains cold lunches, snacks, juice, and milk. These cases easily fit into the trunk of a sedan. It is a good idea to do a quick count of the lunches, juices, and milk and make sure they tally with what you expect based on your list. Both the times we volunteered, we found that there was a mismatch.\n\nNow, you follow the order of the list from the beginning and drive to the corresponding addresses and deliver the appropriate items. Make sure you knock loudly and wait for 5-7 minutes as many individuals have mobility and hearing issues. If no one comes to the door, try to call the listed phone number. If no one answers, mark the entry as “undelivered”. You will need to fill out an online form at the end of your route for these individuals.\n\nDeliveries may be to houses or to apartments. If the door was visible from our car, we allowed our kids to deliver to the house. For apartments, we went in with one of the kids. In some cases, either my husband or I delivered to an apartment. At the end of the route, you return the cases and folder back to the MoW location. I recommend taking some snacks and drinks along with you in case you get hungry or tired. You may need to use nearby gas stations if kids need a bathroom break.\n\nThis was an eye-opening experience. Most of the individuals in both our routes were white. I had read and watched documentaries about white poverty in USA. This was the first time I confronted it. Some of the cold lunches we delivered only had a couple of slices of bread and some cheese in it. We were astonished by this, but realized that basic groceries like a loaf of bread and bags of cheese were inaccessible to many people. Due to the nature of urban development and dominance of cars for transportation, these areas are food deserts for people who are poor, unwell, and living alone.\n\nPeople in apartments seemed worse off than those in houses. In some apartments, the building windows were broken and was covered with a thin sheet of plastic wrap. The inside of some of the buildings were dank and dark, and several apartments had eviction notices posted on the doors. Note that the temperatures in December were less than 5 degrees with strong winds.\n\nI felt that more than volunteer hours, it was really important for our kids to understand their privileges and be exposed to the lives of less fortunate people. Volunteering for Meals on Wheels helped them become curious about the causes of such poverty and isolation in our society. They now avidly watch John Oliver’s segments on various issues in “Last Week Tonight” and express an interest in reading more about some of these topics. After covering our routes, I decided to research this program a bit more.\n\nMeals on Wheels is a program based on public-private partnership. It is designed to deliver meals to senior individuals who are unable to purchase or prepare their own meals. It is largely funded through community contributions, though it does receive some federal support through the Older Americans Act Nutrition Program of 1972, Medicaid, and USDA grants. They sometimes also commission studies on hunger and other needs among seniors.\n\nAccording to these studies, before the pandemic, 9.7 million seniors were threatened by hunger and 25% of seniors lived alone. A volunteer delivering a meal is often the only person an individual in this program may see over the course of the day. Thus, a Meals on Wheels volunteer does the added function of serving as a wellness check on a senior and alerting the organization if they were unable to deliver the meal to the person. So this program also helps reduce the public costs of hospitalizations from falls and illnesses.\n\nIn 2017, federal funding for the program was cut by 1.5 million dollars and the Community Services, Community Development and Social Services Block Grants, upon which some Meals on Wheels programs rely for funding were also eliminated. It is therefore imperative to support this program through volunteering and donations. If you are undecided about whether this activity is for you and your family, I recommend riding along with a volunteer family so you can see for yourself what it’s like. It is a small time commitment, without much strenuous physical activity, and you would be contributing to making our society caring and compassionate.\n\nMy experience travelling with Tuskers – Anoop Nair\n\n(Anoop Nair is a Software Engineer living in Delaware Ohio. He loves to scribble, paint, and travel when he is away from coding. Following cricket and experimenting with his culinary skills are other pastimes.)\n\nOne fine evening during a fireside chat, after being a little jingled, Pradeesh told me about Columbus Tuskers travelling to Miami, Florida for their next Malayalee Soccer league. He casually asked me if I am interested to join them, of course only to cheer and support. My first reaction was “what the heck will I be doing there; I am nowhere into soccer”? But then for a moment, I was carried away by thoughts of sunshine, beaches and delicious sea food (touchings), away from the pesters of gloomy Ohioan winter and most importantly with no strings attached. When I told my wife about this conversation I had with Pradeesh, to my surprise she told me I should go (I saw in her eyes as if she is getting a blank cheque to be cashed later). Whatever it be, I booked my airplane tickets along with other folks. Team’s itinerary was – A day of soccer (leagues, knockouts and the finale) and a day and half to recover (don’t think too much into the recovery, poor guys are fighting out the scorching heat of Miami!).\n\nIt is the day of travel and my phone hooted at 3 AM (economic flights always come with a price), got dressed up and reached the CMH airport. Met other team members of Columbus Tuskers, led by our own dynamic president Shibu Nair. Most of them were familiar faces in COMA, except for couple of guys whom I was meeting for the first time. All of them ardent lovers of soccer and passionate for playing. Their body language, enthusiasm and zeal said it all. I forgot to mention that there were couple of other guys too travelling with the team like I was, to cheer and boost. The excitement started building up and I recollected my last guys-only trip I had with a such big group – may be in my college! Huh!!\n\nAfter exchanging all pleasantries, Tuskers flew out of Columbus and landed in Orlando. We took some pictures with the cabin crew and went to rent the cars (thanks to Aslam Ikka, preferred customer of Avis for taking care of all bookings even though wait time for the preferred customer was more than the flight time to Orlando). Finally, we drove to Miami and checked into an Airbnb property. It was a decent house that could accommodate all 15 of us, with a beautiful patio looking into a sprawling swimming pool. For a moment, it felt like I landed in Kerala – warm and beautiful weather, Palm and Coconut trees lining the horizon, Mango trees in the backyard adorned in their flowers and all tropical fauna you habitually see in Kerala.\n\nAfter sprucing up into their summer attire, Tuskers headed for some game day eve practice. As the team was busy fine tuning their skills, we cheerleaders slugged some drinks. It is truly an amazing mood gulping some cold beer in the month of February roaming around in your shorts – something you can just dream about in Columbus. But hats off to the dedication and passion of Tuskers for restraining themselves and just focusing and thinking about the game next day. They were engaged in making game plans and strategies, rectifying mistakes, helping each other in correcting their game, practicing their shots and what not. I was completely moved by their sincerity and devotion for the game.\n\nIt’s the Game Day! Guys woke up as early as 5 AM and geared up for the D-day, adorned in their Tuskers yellow and black jerseys. We reached Flamingo Park, Cooper City where 12 Malayalee teams from different parts of the US had assembled to fight for the MASC (Malayalee Arts and Sports Club) Miami Soccer trophy. What a festive atmosphere it was; like an Ulsavam (temple fest) back in Kerala. The hospitality by MASC Miami was paramount. Boiled organic Kozhi Mutta and Tharavu Mutta straight from the MASC president’s farm were the highlights of the breakfast.\n\nGetting into the game, Tuskers were facing the hosts, MASC Miami, in the event opener. Our boys were keen to conquer the home team and announce their arrival to the other soccer giants of US Malayalee leagues. Being an early morning game, we were surprised to see a lot of dew. Ref blew his whistle, and the ball was set into motion. The game progressed and soon our striker Subash struck the first goal of the tournament. It was a moment in the tournament, and I must admire MASC commentators for their superb Malayalam commentary laced with all kinds of wits and humors throughout the tournament. Though Tuskers had an initial lead, there seemed to be a lack of coordination and communication between the players which was quite evident. Wet ground was certainly a factor resulting in some misjudgments. Soon the home team struck back, and we lost our lead, but somehow, we did manage to score a second goal and maintain the lead. It was just 20 seconds for the final hooter and some of us among the spectators had already started blowing the victory bugle. Alas, Miami scored an equalizer! Tuskers had to settle for a draw against the home team who were never at par with us. We could see a lull in our side, dropped shoulders and agony on their faces summed it up.\n\nSoon, Tuskers were back to the strategy table analyzing what went wrong and how they can do better; after all it was not a defeat, and the first game is always a lesson in learning. Luckily, we had a break of 3 hours before our next group game and that was enough to rejuvenate and revive. On the other side, more group games were in progress, I was thrilled to see some fantastic game of soccer by teams like New York, Philly, Atlanta etc. while I was scouting around. Florida sun was now sweltering, and we could see other teams getting tired out, cramping and all. Hydration was the mantra and again MASC had done a great job with supplying more than adequate water and other sports drinks to all teams. Me and my fellow spectators ensured we too kept ourselves hydrated and chilled with some beer and cocktails in our car bar. Meanwhile, in the other group match Miami was thrashed by Minnal Charlotte 5-2 and the Tuskers were next up against Minnals on a turf blistered by the noon sun.\n\nTuskers were now facing an upbeat Minnals, there was a better coordination between our players this time and within 10 minutes into the play, we were able to draw first blood with a superb strike by Geeno. We maintained our lead until after the half time but were equalized by Minnals in the second half. The equation was simple – a draw or a win will take us to the Quarter Finals and our defenders stood like a wall. Game had moved into its final minute when Basil Jacob hit the ball into the top left corner of Minnals’ post from a lobbied corner kick, giving Tuskers their first victory. It was not just a victory for Tuskers, they emerged as the group toppers. That was a terrific game with a right finishing touch, helping Tuskers to get back into their rhythm.\n\nMood was high and lively in our camp, and we had a sumptuous lunch provided by MASC. The overall event management by MASC was commendable – from the grand opening ceremony by the city mayor to the food, the medical services, timeliness and the closing ceremony – everything was well planned.\n\nTuskers moved into their Quarterfinal battle against Houston United, who were a reputed side playing as an organized team for the last 10 years in various US leagues. We could now feel the heat on the field and of course Florida’s sun triggering frequent dehydration and cramps to our players. Houston had a tough goalkeeper taking down all chances that our strikers fancied. Tuskers fought their heart out and our defenders along with the Goalkeeper Anil sealed our post and we ended up with a goal-less draw. The game moved into a penalty shootout, which was a first for the tournament and attracted a lot of spectators. Soon, 5 strikers lined up from each team ready to take a hit on the post. Houston with their super skilled goalie had an upper hand and were the favorites. The first bout of 5 penalty shoots ended in 3-3, thanks to a flying save by our goalie Anil. It looked like neither team was ready to budge. Another set of 3 penalty shoots began and the final shot by a Houston player went over the post and we stormed into the semifinal. By the end of this game, Tuskers who looked rookie in their opening game were posing serious threats to some of the Malayalee soccer giants. They were thrilled but at the same time remained calm and composed for the semifinal.\n\nTuskers entered their semifinal bout against Arsenal Philadelphia who were a much younger side and had already stamped their authority in the tournament by thrashing their opponents by huge margins in group stages and Quarters. Apart from young legs, they seemed to be a bit rough too and as a result we were soon at the receiving end of a tough penalty call by the ref which was a surprise to the opponents too. They converted the penalty and took a lead. It was a fiery game, and we were at the receiving end again with another penalty which was nicely saved by our goalie. Our players started getting cramps and medical staff were frequently seen on the field. Battling all odds, our striker Geeno breached Philly’s defense and levelled the scores, but he himself went down with a muscle cramp. There were some intense battles of shots before Philly struck again, taking a lead and eventually Tuskers went down 2-1 fighting valiantly. We lost the semifinal, but the effort we put in, the coordination and skill we displayed were supreme.\n\nWe stayed up in the park to watch the thrilling Finale between the defending champions New York and Arsenal Philadelphia. Eventually New York were crowned as the champions yet again. MASC put a tremendous effort organizing this event and it was nothing less than a pooram with a festive Malayali atmosphere and Chendamelam.\n\nNext day and a half were a much-needed break for the team when we all enjoyed some wonderful time together exploring beaches, sunshine and cocktails before boarding back to reality in Columbus!\n\nColumbus Tuskers is not just a soccer team, it’s a bonding of individuals playing out their passion, displaying dedication and sincerity on the field, and outside of the field they are a bunch of jovial, fun loving, buoyant individuals with never ending jokes and banters, who are the best to hang out with. I thoroughly enjoyed this trip with Tuskers and wish them success in all their future leagues!\n\nMember Achievements and Milestones\n\nDr. Soumya Mary Kurian\n\nCongratulations to Dr. Soumya Mary Kurian for earning her doctorate in Nursing Practice from Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN.\n\nDr. Kurian has been practicing as a Nurse Practitioner in an outpatient opioid treatment clinic for over six years.

February is all about celebrating love in all its forms – romantic, familial, friendships, and even radical self-love. Some of my best Valentine’s Day memories are of getting hand made cards from my son during his kindergarten years. Whether your plans for Valentine’s Day include a romantic night out with your partner, or cooking a nice meal for your family, I recommend taking the opportunity to show appreciation for all the love you are blessed to have in your life.\n\nI hope you did not miss the COMA February event with the indoor games and the evening entertainment.

She is a neuroscience graduate from UC and her interests include writing and traveling.)\n\nWell, mom and dad, I just graduated from college. I’m a new grad all over again. Crazy, right? I can go around saying I have a bachelors now. I got a physical copy of my diploma a couple days back and every time I pass it as it sits on my dressing table, I am still marveled by the fact that the 4 years passed by. I’m in the midst of applying again, but this time I’m applying to graduate schools and let me tell you, I don’t miss it at all. I forgot what it was like to write essays that sum up your whole personality in 800 words. I also forgot what it was like to wait for your dream school to let you know if you got in or not. However, one thing that is different this time around is that I have in-person interviews which is something that I have been struggling with considering how much I dread interviews.\n\nOther than graduate school applications, I have got to say I am enjoying the post grad life – I am back in the city of Columbus, sitting on kitchen countertops as I complain to my mom about pretty much anything life related, going on Costco trips with my dad, and dealing with my brother’s mood swings. Also, I finally got a job after consistently applying which is how I pass most of my time. My 12-hour shifts consist of seeing patients of all ages, taking their vitals, running tests on them if they need it, and sending out their labs. On the days I don’t work long hours, you can find me on the couch reading and listening to music. One of my new year resolutions this year was to write more. I lost touch with writing for a bit while in college but it’s nice to get back into the rhythm of it and thanks to Smitha aunty, I was able to write to you guys for this month’s edition of the newsletter.\n\nThat pretty much sums up my whole life as a new graduate. While it may not be the typical route one takes right after graduating from undergrad, it’s nice to take a break and see where life takes you. So, yeah, I may not have my life completely planned out, but that’s okay. In fact, now that I had the time to see my career goals in a different light, I feel more passionate about pursuing my desired career path. With that being said, I’m excited to see what this year will bring. Hopefully, an acceptance letter.\n\nI hope the new year is good to all of you!\n\nSreejith Chandran’s Random Ramblings\n\n(One half of his brain has gone nomad and the other has gone in search of the first. Glorifying his random ramblings and packaging it is his main hobby!

On a sunny nice day she can be found hiking, and is always working on her next bucket list item.)\n\nMotivation and Inspiration are two sides of the same coin. Motivation involves outside forces whereas inspiration comes from within. We can be motivated by a motivational speaker, but that doesn’t last long, however when we are inspired by something or someone, that stays within for a longer time.\n\nThe three things that have inspired me and have always worked for me are:\n\n“The Alchemist’s Law”\n\n“What you will, shall come to you”\n\n“Embracing shades of gray”\n\n“The Alchemist’s Law” is a reference to Paulo Coelho’s novel “The Alchemist”. The novel follows the journey of Santiago, a shepherd boy, who sets out on a quest to fulfill his personal legend, or life’s purpose. Throughout the journey, Santiago encounters several obstacles, but he is guided by a series of universal laws, and the most important law of all, is: “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” It’s easier said than done, the point here is, even for the universe to conspire to help you with something, first, you need that desire, want, or self-drive to achieve it. Setting goals or wanting to come out of a difficult situation is easy, but then the constant push and struggle to make the “desire” to “reality” will be the true test.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “What you will, shall come to you” suggests that our thoughts, desires, and intentions have a powerful impact on our lives. It suggests that the universe responds to our will and helps us manifest our deepest desires if they are in alignment with our true selves and our life’s purpose. The idea is that if we focus our thoughts and actions on what we want, we can create positive outcomes and attract abundance and joy into our lives. However, it’s important to keep in mind that manifestation is not just about positive thinking, but also about taking inspired action and being open to opportunities as they arise. The idea is to align your will with the flow of the universe and trust that what you truly desire will come to you in due time.\n\nThe last and my favorite one is, “Living positively and embracing shades of gray”. Life is never black or white, or for the computer geeks, it’s not always 1 or 0. We need to be finding joy, gratitude, and meaning in life while also recognizing that not everything is simple or easily classified as good or bad, right or wrong. This approach involves being open to multiple perspectives, embracing ambiguity, and striving for balance and understanding, rather than rigidly adhering to black and white thinking.\n\nI feel that by combining a positive outlook, and embracing grey with a nuanced and inclusive perspective, one can lead a more fulfilling and meaningful life. I always believe!\n\nCOMA Meals on Wheels program\n\nIf you would like to sign up for the Meals on Wheels program (2nd and 4th Sundays of each month), please join this WhatsApp group.
