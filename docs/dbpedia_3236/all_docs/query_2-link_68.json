        "text": "Amritsar Govindsingh Milkha Singh (pronunciation ) (31 December 1941 – 10 November 2017) was an Indian Test cricketer. Milkha Singh was a left-handed batsman and an occasional right arm medium pace bowler. He came from a famous cricketing family which also produced A. G. Ram Singh and his more successful brother A. G. Kripal Singh. He was a brilliant schoolboy cricketer and his exploits led to a first-class debut at the age of 16. He represented South Zone Schools in the interzonal Cooch Behar Trophy and scored 114 in the final against West Zone. This led to the vice captaincy of the Indian Schools that toured Ceylon that year. Milkha, who studied at Loyola College, Chennai, was twice voted the best collegiate cricketer and represented university and state. He played four Test matches. He made his debut in 1959-60 against the Australians, toured Pakistan in 1960-61 and played one Test against England in 1961-62. In the Test against England, the Indian team also included A.G. Kripal Singh and Vaman Kumar, the only instance when three Tamil Nadu players appeared in an Indian side. Milkha was only 19 when he played his last Test. He scored more than 2,000 runs for Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy and was the first player to score a century in the Duleep Trophy.\n\nAmritsar Govindsingh Ram Singh (14 July 1910 – 11 August 1999) was an Indian first-class cricketer. An allrounder, he bowled slow left-arm orthodox and was a left-handed middle order batsman. His son A. G. Kripal Singh played Test cricket for India.Ram Singh played for Madras and was just the second player to achieve the Ranji Trophy double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets. He was the first bowler to take 5 wickets in an innings and 10 wickets in a match in the Ranji Trophy. He achieved that feat in the very first match of the Ranji Trophy, playing for Madras against Mysore. He took his best ever innings figures of 8 for 14 in a Madras Presidency Match, playing for the Indians against the Europeans. He was a much loved cricket coach for the schoolboys of Sir M Venkatasubba Rao Boys School in T Nagar, Madras during the late 1970s and the 1980s. His dedication to the game and to the young cricketers was something which those he coached have kept very close to their cricketing hearts.\n\nAakash Chopra pronunciation (born 19 September 1977) is a former Indian cricketer, who played for the Indian cricket team from late 2003 until late 2004 as a defensive opening batsman and close catcher in Test matches.

An article by Aakash Chopra has also appeared in the book \"Sachin Tendulkar : The man cricket loved back.\" (2014). He is known to be overly critical at times, which has led to fans' scrutiny. He can be seen commentating in various international matches and IPL matches telecasted on Star Sports Network Channels like Star Sports-1,1 Hindi, 2, etc. giving the Hindi Commentary in his trademark voice.\n\nAashish Rakesh Kapoor pronunciation (born 25 March 1971) is a former Indian cricketer who played in four Test matches and 17 One Day Internationals from 1994 to 2000. He was member of the 1996 Cricket World Cup Squad but was dropped and was never able to make it back to the national ODI team after 2000. He was 200th Test Cricketer to represent India.
