        "text": "Note: Sign in to the developer console to build or publish your skill.\n\nThe Alexa Skills Kit supports several slot types that define how data in the slot is recognized and handled. The provided types fall into the following general categories:\n\nNumbers, Dates, and Times\n\nPhrases\n\nLists of Items\n\nAvailability\n\nSome built-in slot types show an availability indicator:\n\nAvailable: The slot type fully available and not considered a preview or beta.\n\nPublic beta: The slot type is offered as a public beta and might improve and change as we receive feedback and iterate on the feature. Please provide your feedback on Stack Overflow.\n\nDeprecation path: Although the slot type is available, it's on the path to deprecation and use is discouraged. Amazon recommends using an alternative, which generally provides better recognition.\n\nIf no availability is shown, the slot type is considered Available.\n\nThis table summarizes the slot types that convert the user's utterance into data types, such as numbers and dates. See the sections after the table for more details and examples.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, these slot types are available in all supported locales.\n\nSlot Type Short Description\n\nAMAZON.AlphaNumeric\n\n(Public beta)\n\nConverts letters, numbers, hyphens and periods into alphanumeric sequences. For example, converts \"sixteen a.\" to 16a.\n\nYou can use this slot type with all locales except Arabic (SA).\n\nAMAZON.DATE\n\nConverts words that indicate dates into a date format. For example, converts \"today\", \"tomorrow\" or \"july\" to 2015-07-00T9.\n\nAMAZON.DURATION\n\nConverts words that indicate durations into a numeric duration. For example, converts \"five minutes\" to PT5M.\n\nAMAZON.FOUR_DIGIT_NUMBER\n\nConverts words that represent four-digit numbers into digits. For example, converts \"six oh four five\" to 6045.\n\nAMAZON.NUMBER\n\nConverts numeric words into digits. For example, converts \"five\" to 5.\n\nAMAZON.Ordinal\n\n(Public beta)\n\nConverts ordinal numbers into digits. For example, converts \"first\" to 1 and \"second\" to 2.\n\nAMAZON.PhoneNumber\n\n(Public beta)\n\nConverts the numbers or words that represent a phone number into a string format without punctuation.\n\nAMAZON.TIME\n\nConverts words that indicate time into a time value. For example, converts \"four in the morning\", to 04:00 and \"two p m\" to 14:00.\n\nAMAZON.AlphaNumeric\n\n(This slot type is in public beta)\n\nConverts letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods into alphanumeric sequences.\n\nUse this slot for input such as postal codes and flight numbers. The Alexa service sends your service the recognized alphanumeric sequence.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"w. q. p. four five nine\": wqp459\n\n\"five nine b. dash\": 59b-\n\n\"dot four b. five f.\": .4b5f\n\n\"r. g. two two four\": rg224\n\n\"q. f. five six eight\": qf568\n\n\"n. one nine t. l.\": n19tl\n\nYou can use this slot type with all locales except Arabic (SA).\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nConverts words that represent dates into a date format.\n\nThe date is provided to your service in ISO-8601 date format. Note that the date your service receives in the slot can vary depending on the specific phrase uttered by the user:\n\nUtterances that map to a specific date (such as \"today\", \"tomorrow\", or \"november twenty-fifth\") convert to a complete date: 2015-11-25. Note that this defaults to dates on or after the current date (see below for more examples).\n\nUtterances that map to just a specific week (such as \"this week\" or \"next week\"), convert a date indicating the week number: 2015-W49.\n\nUtterances that map to the weekend for a specific week (such as \"this weekend\") convert to a date indicating the week number and weekend: 2015-W49-WE.\n\nUtterances that map to a month, but not a specific day (such as \"next month\", or \"september\") convert to a date with just the year and month. Note that the format differs between English and other languages:\n\nAll English locales use the format YYYY-MM. For example: 2018-09.\n\nAll other languages (French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish) use the format YYYY-MM-XX. For example: 2018-09-XX.\n\nUtterances that map to a year (such as \"next year\") convert to a date containing just the year. Note that the date format differs between English and other languages:\n\nAll English locales use the format YYYY. For example: 2018.\n\nAll other languages (French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish) use the format YYYY-XX-XX. For example: 2018-XX-XX.\n\nUtterances that map to a decade convert to a date indicating the decade: 201X.\n\nUtterances that map to a season (such as \"next winter\") convert to a date with the year and a season indicator: winter: WI, spring: SP, summer: SU, fall: FA)\n\nUtterances that map to a relative date (such as 'this weekend' or 'one night ago') convert to a complete date: 2015-11-24. The resolved value depends on the current date.\n\nResolving Years\n\nIf the user's utterance does not specify a year, Alexa defaults to dates on or after the current date. For example, the utterance \"February first\" returns the next \"February first\" date, so the year will depend on the day the user says the utterance:\n\nIf today is January 31, 2017, the slot returns 2017-02-01.\n\nIf today is February 1, 2017, the slot returns 2017-02-01 (today's date).\n\nIf today is February 2, 2017, the slot returns 2018-02-01 (the next instance of February first).\n\nExamples:\n\n\"today\": 2015-11-24\n\n\"tomorrow\": 2015-11-25\n\n\"november twenty-fifth\": 2015-11-25\n\n\"next monday\": 2015-11-30\n\n\"this week\": 2015-W48\n\n\"next week\": 2015-W49\n\n\"this weekend\": 2015-W48-WE\n\n\"this month\": 2015-11\n\n\"next year\": 2016\n\n\"this decade\": 201X\n\n\"next winter\": 2017-WI\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.DURATION\n\nConverts words that indicate durations into a numeric duration.\n\nThe duration is provided to your skill in a format based on the ISO-8601 duration format (PnYnMnDTnHnMnS). The P indicates that this is a duration. The n is the numeric value, and the capital letter following the n designates the specific date or time element. For example, P3D means 3 days. A T is used to indicate that the remaining values represent time elements rather than date elements.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"ten minutes\": PT10M\n\n\"five hours\": PT5H\n\n\"three days\": P3D\n\n\"forty five seconds\": PT45S\n\n\"eight weeks\": P8W\n\n\"seven years\": P7Y\n\n\"five hours ten minutes\": PT5H10M\n\n\"two years three hours ten minutes\": P2YT3H10M\n\n\"three and a half weeks\": P3.5W\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.FOUR_DIGIT_NUMBER\n\nProvides recognition for special ways four-digit numbers are often spoken. This is useful for input such as PIN codes, validation codes or years that are often said as single or groups of digits. The user can speak the number in a variety of ways. The Alexa service sends your service the recognized digits.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"six oh four five\": 6045\n\n\"six zero four five\": 6045\n\n\"six oh forty five\": 6045\n\n\"sixty forty five\": 6045\n\n\"six thousand forty five\": 6045\n\n\"five double six four\": 5664\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.NUMBER\n\nConverts numeric words into digits.\n\n\"three\": 3\n\n\"ten\": 10\n\n\"fifty five\": 55\n\n\"one oh four\": 104\n\n\"one hundred four\": 104\n\n\"one hundred and four\": 104\n\n\"five thousand two hundred and thirty five\": 5235\n\n\"nine eight zero three four\": 98034\n\n\"minus five\": -5\n\n\"two point five\": 2.5\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.Ordinal\n\n(This slot type is in public beta)\n\nConverts words representing ordinal numbers into digits.\n\n\"third\": 3\n\n\"tenth\": 10\n\n\"first\": 1\n\n\"fifteenth\": 15\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.PhoneNumber\n\n(This slot type is in public beta)\n\nConverts the numbers or words that represent a phone number into a string format without punctuation. Local phone number formats for each locale are supported. The following table shows examples for US phone numbers.\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nAMAZON.TIME\n\nConverts words that indicate time into time values.\n\nValues that represent a specific time are provided to your skill in ISO-8601 time format. Midnight is represented as 00:00.\n\nNote that this slot also supports time-related utterances that map to a time period such as \"evening\". This type of utterance returns a time period indicator instead of an ISO-8601 formatted time. For example, \"evening\" returns the value EV. The following time period indicators can be returned: night: NI, morning: MO, afternoon: AF, evening: EV.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"noon\": 12:00\n\n\"midnight\": 00:00\n\n\"six\": 06:00\n\n\"four twenty three in the morning\": 04:23\n\n\"five am\": 05:00\n\n\"one thirty in the afternoon\": 13:30\n\n\"two fifteen pm\": 14:15\n\n\"eleven fifty nine at night\": 23:59\n\n\"this morning\": MO\n\n\"now\": 13:30\n\nUtterances that map to a relative time (such as 'five minutes ago') convert to a complete time: 11:55. The resolved value depends on the current time.\n\nYou can use this slot type with all supported locales.\n\n(Back up to Numbers, Dates, and Times)\n\nPhrases\n\nPhrase slot types allow for input from a user with fewer constraints on format and content. Make sure that your skill uses no more than one phrase slot per intent.\n\nThe following phrase slot type is supported.\n\nSlot Type Short Description Examples Supported Languages AMAZON.SearchQuery A search query like you might enter into a search engine, for example for searching a database. Why is the sky blue\n\nWhat is the capital of Maryland\n\nRestaurants near me\n\nArabic (SA)\n\nEnglish (AU)\n\nEnglish (CA)\n\nEnglish (IN)\n\nEnglish (UK)\n\nEnglish (US)\n\nFrench (CA)\n\nFrench (FR)\n\nGerman (DE)\n\nHindi (IN)\n\nItalian (IT)\n\nJapanese (JP)\n\nPortuguese (BR)\n\nSpanish (ES)\n\nSpanish (MX)\n\nSpanish (US)\n\nWhen you expect some user input to follow a predictable pattern while other user input is more open-ended, your intent can use a phrase slot to capture the less predictable input while using custom or built-in slots to capture the more predictable input.\n\nAMAZON.SearchQuery\n\nAs you think about what users are likely to ask, consider using a built-in or custom slot type to capture user input that is more predictable, and the AMAZON.SearchQuery slot type to capture less-predictable input that makes up the search query.\n\nThe following example shows an intent schema for SearchIntent, which uses the AMAZON.SearchQuery slot type and also includes a CityList slot that uses the AMAZON.City slot type.\n\nMake sure that your skill uses no more than one AMAZON.SearchQuery slot per intent. The Amazon.SearchQuery slot type cannot be combined with another intent slot in sample utterances.\n\nEach sample utterance must include a carrier phrase. The exception is that you can omit the carrier phrase in slot samples. A carrier phrase is the word or words that are part of the utterance, but not the slot, such as \"search for\" or \"find out\".\n\nSee Interaction Model Schema for the complete intent schema compatible with the developer console and the Skill Management API.\n\nList Types\n\nThese slot types each represent a list of items. You can extend some of these slot types with additional utterances by defining a custom slot type with the same name and adding the additional items as custom slot type values. For more examples of utterances and slot values, see the sections below.\n\nImportant: A built-in slot type is not the equivalent of an enumeration. Values outside the list are still returned if recognized by the spoken language understanding system. Although input to the slot type is weighted towards the values in the list, it is not constrained to just the items on the list. You can either perform validation and error checking in your own code, or define slot validation rules in your dialog model and then delegate the dialog to Alexa to prompt the user for acceptable values.\n\nFor details about how entity resolution works with these built-in slot types, see Entity Resolution for Built-in Slot Types.\n\nList Slot Types\n\nThe built-in slot types available depend on the language selected for your skill. These tabs show the set of types available for the supported languages.\n\n(Back up to List Slot Types)\n\nExtend a Built-in Slot Type with Custom Values\n\nYou can add your own custom values to a subset of the built-in list slot types. This action appends the values you provide to the built-in values defined by Amazon. For example, AMAZON.City provides recognition for cities. If you must collect additional cities – such as smaller towns that might not be included – you could add them to the list by extending the type. The slot would then recognize both the original set of values as well as the custom ones you added.\n\nYou can also define synonyms and identifiers for values you add to a built-in slot type. For details, see Entity Resolution for Built-in Slot Types.\n\nExtending a built-in slot type only applies to the specific skill. For instance, if you extend AMAZON.City with additional cities for one skill, those changes don't apply to any other skills that also use AMAZON.City.\n\nExtend a Slot Type\n\nBefore you can extend a built-in type, you must add it to your skill. In the left-hand navigation, view the types under Slot Types. If the slot type to extend isn't included, add it to your skill:\n\nTo add the slot type to extend\n\nOn the Build page, navigate to Custom > Assets > Slot Types.\n\nClick + Add Slot Type.\n\nSelect the Use an existing slot type from Alexa's built-in library option.\n\nFind the built-in slot type you want to add.\n\nYou can filter the slot types by name.\n\nFor each built-in type to add, click +Add Slot Type.\n\nTo save your changes, click Save Model.\n\nTo extend a built-in slot type, add values to it just as you would a custom type.\n\nTo add values to a built-in slot type\n\nOn the Build page, under Custom > Assets > Slot Types, select the slot type to edit.\n\nFor Slot Values, enter a value, and then click the plus sign (+) or press Enter.\n\nTo save your changes, click Save.\n\nFor more about creating and editing slot types in the developer console, see Create and Edit Custom Slot Types\n\nSlot Types You Can Extend\n\nYou can extend most of the list slot types with additional values. To determine if a slot type can be extended, see the Ext column in the table of list slot types above.\n\nBuilt-in Intent Library Documentation\n\nNavigate to all built-in intents in the Built-in Intent Library.\n\nLearn more about using the built-in intent library:\n\nUnderstanding the Structure of the Built-in Intent Library\n\nImplementing the Built-in Intents\n\nStandard Built-in Intents\n\nLearn more about building your voice interface:\n\nChoose the Invocation Name for a Custom Skill\n\nCreate the Interaction Model for Your Skill\n\nBest Practices for Sample Utterances and Custom Slot Type Values\n\nInteraction Model Schema\n\nAlexa Design Guide\n\nThe built-in intent library incorporates material from Schema.org, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (version 3.0) (the \"License\").
