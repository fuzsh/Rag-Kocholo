Sanctuary – a collection of new works on paper – explores form, composition, and color. The collection intends to act as a counterweight to the trials of modern daily life. The works were neither premeditated nor post-rationalized. They are about everything and nothing.”\n\n7/21-9/14 – Wanderings: A Walk In The Woods by Derrick Burbul @ Fred Simon Gallery\n\n“To wander is not to be lost, and, to wonder is not to be ignorant, but both lead to imagination and hope. With this work, Burbul hopes to find deeper connections to those fragments of understanding that fill our lives, and wander past the artificially neat 20 images of similar looking work putting on the facade of understanding.”\n\n5/20-9/17 – Presence in the Pause: Interiority and its Radical Immanence @ Bemis Center\n\n“Specifically, Presence in the Pause spotlights a group of women and non-binary artists born between 1975-1985, who collectively uncover and chronicle the intimate and immanent aspects of daily life, spotlighting interiority as not only personal but political.”\n\n5/20-9/17 – Jennifer Ling Datchuk: Eat Bitterness @ Bemis Center\n\n“Jennifer Ling Datchuk’s work is an exploration of her layered identity–as a woman, a Chinese woman, as an “American,” as a third culture kid. Trained in ceramics and often working with porcelain and other materials often associated with traditional women’s work, such as textiles and hair, her practice discusses fragility, beauty, femininity, intersectionality, identity, and her personal history. Through material culture, the history of craft, and by championing the handmade, she challenges the social, political, and cultural systems that continue to hold women back.”\n\n8/10-10/1 – “Falsescapes” – Josh Powell @ Garden Of The Zodiac\n\n“A visionary storyteller, Powell weaves together densely layered and textured images from printed materials, drawing and painting, a manner of building an image that is analogous to the fragmented societal narrative he creates. Building on past work that has touched on skeptical views of the industrial-military complex, Powell has fashioned dystopian landscapes borne of questioning: What does the world look like when there are no borders, states or countries? Amidst the chaos, where might order and beauty be found? Can the familiar be reconstituted from destruction? Are we the watchers or the watched?”\n\n6/11/23-5/12/24 – “Sharing the Glory: The History of Baseball in Omaha” @ Douglas County Historical Society\n\nFarmers And Other Markets\n\n9/1 – Benson First Friday\n\nFridays\n\nOmaha – Night Market @ Midtown Crossing (last Fridays, 6-10pm, May-August)\n\nOmaha – Gifford Park Neighborhood Market Jam 6/23 – The Stone Crowes (6-9pm)\n\nSaturdays\n\nCouncil Bluffs – YMCA S.
