Kansas, where an estimated 2,500 fans stormed the stage.\n\nThat teenage trauma Elvis Presley had about 2,500 Topeka misses envying a microphone Monday night in Municipal Auditorium\n\nThe rock-and-roll recording sensation strode onto the stage like a musical Paul Bunyan with a guitar for an axe.\n\nAnd for 20 minutes, he made love to the “mike,” completely felling most of his already-sold audience.\n\nAnticipating demonstrations similar to those in other cities, Topeka police took no chance.\n\nSeveral stood at stage-side through Presley’s short performance which followed a variety show.\n\nBut the guards were not needed. The stage was too high and Presley was out of the building by a secret exit and into the Hotel Kansan before the youths caught on.\n\nIt was a little hard to be sure above the continuing squeals and clapping—but the sensuous 21-year·old from Memphis apparently sang some of the songs which have pushed him to the top of the Hit Parade.\n\nThough he didn‘t give the titles, it was obvious the young fans had heard the loud tunes before.\n\nHeartbreak Hotel,” “Blue Suede Shoes,” “Money Honey,” and “Hound Dog” were among them.\n\nWith movements which would put a burlesque queen to shame, Elvis squirms out his songs. He keeps himself so breathless from the physical contortions that the pleasant timbre of his lower baritone notes can seldom be detected.\n\nDressed in his famed red coat and black shirt and pants, Elvis has the effect of an earlier Frank Sinatra, with a more robust appeal.\n\nHis songs not only transform his fans, but that walk on stage apparently brings a metamorphosis in him.\n\nOff stage. despite some published reports, Elvis is a polite young man, who prefixes nearly every sentence with “Yes, mam,” or “Thank you, mam.”\n\nWith a hair cut and a shave for his sideburns. he would not turn many heads on Kansas Avenue. His light brown hair tops very blue eyes and full lips.\n\nHe is amazed by it all. It wasn’t long ago that he walked into a public recording studio to cut a record “just to hear myself sing.”\n\nThe money ( reported $7.500 a week), which permits him to own several Cadillacs and maintain a new home for his parents, is easy to take, he admits.\n\nThough he soon will make a movie, Elvis said he has “got what I want. But I’d just like to keep giving the people something that they want to hear.”\n\nWhether rock-and-roll is here to stay he doesn’t know.”\n\nHe says he will “start worrying when the, girls don‘t mob me.”\n\nHowever, he no longer exposes himself unnecessarily.\n\nPolice have had to guard him at all his recent Western and Midwest stops.\n\n“There is no sense getting your clothes torn off,” he said.\n\n“Several times they got everything but my pants and I had quite a fight for those.”\n\nHis garb on arrival at Municipal Airport might explain some of this.\n\nThe singer had on nothing above the waist but a loose-fitting, two button shantung suit coat which exposed considerable bare chest.\n\nHis style was “just an accident,” he says. But he claims to “admire anybody in any profession that is good at it.”\n\n“A great singer, I could listen to all night. I don’t care whether it is opera or jazz.”\n\nHe is quick to refute many egotistical statements attributed to him in magazines and newspapers. ‘\n\nThe draft may catch him soon, but in the meantime he claims no matrimonial intentions.\n\nOf the Time Magazine remark attributed to him in this connection-“Why buy a cow when you can get milk through a fence?”—he says, “I never said that.\n\nEngagement – Tour Ref: 1956\n\nInfo: Date: Venue: Location: Showtime: Crowd: Show type: Pics: Ads: Info May 21 1956 Municipal Auditorium Topeka KS (7:00 PM) 2500\n\nThe Presleys lived at Audobon Drive\n\nMay 21, 1957\n\nJailhouse Rock Production\n\nAt 7.00 a.m. Elvis had a makeup appointment for the fitting of the “butch cut” wig that he would wear in the prison scenes of Jailhouse Rock\n\nThe Presleys lived at Audobon Drive, Graceland purchased on March 19.\n\nThe Military Service Disruption\n\nMay 21, 1958\n\nMilitary service at Fort Hood in Texas., for basic training as part of the Second Armored Division.
