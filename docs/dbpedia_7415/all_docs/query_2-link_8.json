In the early 1980s, Cowsill performed and recorded with Jan and Dean and is heard playing percussion and singing back-up vocals on Tommy Tutone’s hit, \"867-5309/Jenny.\"\n\nDuring this time he also toured as the drummer of Dwight Twilley’s band. Cowsill began playing with the touring Beach Boys on keyboards and vocals in 2000. He moved to the drums in 2008, and was featured as lead vocalist on such songs as \"Wild Honey,” \"California Dreamin’,” “Darlin’,” and \"Sail On Sailor.\"\n\nIn 2011, Cowsill was chosen to play with Brian Wilson’s band-- along with Al Jardine and Mike Love--on The Beach Boys’ sold-out 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour.
