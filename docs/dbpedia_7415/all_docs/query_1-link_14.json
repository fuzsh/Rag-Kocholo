        "text": "It is true that Disneyland itself has been reckoned a large stage, where a grand show takes place! Within that grand show are many smaller “stages” - attractions, exhibits, restaurants, shows and entertainment! Tomorrowland too, has also been referred to as one of Disneyland’s many stages. All these facts considered, through the decades, Tomorrowland has had more stages than the Carousel of Progress. Some of these stages were very small for spotlighting small acts (like the General Dynamics Stage used by the Yachtsmen), while some of these stages (like the Space Stage, or Tomorrowland Bandstand) had the ability to accommodate large casts of stage stars and personalities (like the New Mouseketeers or the All-American College Singers) and their “back-up bands”! Please step this way as we explore the progression of the Tomorrowland Stage!\n\n“The Tomorrowland Stage Lands”\n\nAfter both the Flying Saucers and Tomorrowland Art Corner disappeared from a large terrestrial area of Tomorrowland, stars would descend upon the former Disneyland Space Station location during the massive Tomorrowland refurbishment due to be unveiled during the summer of 1967! Revealed were two different stages that would showcase live entertainment.\n\nTomorrowland Terrace (would rise both out of the ground, and in popularity) for its “happening bands” and “now sounds” of today! However, so many talented acts could not be contained on just one stage. So a second stage - the Tomorrowland Stage (also called the Tomorrowland Bandstand) - would bring more “out of this world” (often in two-week engagements), to this corner of Disneyland! According to “INFORMATION ON DISNEYLAND'S NEW TOMORROWLAND - A WORLD ON THE MOVE” (©️ 1967 Wed Enterprises, Inc): “Special events - musical attractions and dances -are presented at the Tomorrowland Bandstand, located on the concourse between Flight to the Moon and The Character Shop.”\n\nMany popular musicians performed from the Tomorrowland Stage! Now, let’s take a look at just some of that big-name talent - the “stars” of the Tomorrowland Stage!\n\nIn the following section we’ll attempt to chronicle the Tomorrowland Stage’s performers by the year of their occurrence!\n\n1967 : During the winter season of 1967, you may recall the exciting sounds of Randy Sparks and “Back Porch Majority” emanating from Tomorrowland Stage for five shows daily (12:00N-6:00pm) and The Mustangs performing “the top songs of the hit parade” (for four shows daily), from December 26th, 1967 thru January 1st, 1968. During the time, the exciting vocal group “The New Establishment” performed popular songs during seven shows daily (from 12:00N - 7:00pm). [“Disneyland Holiday Talent Master Schedule,” prepared for the period of December 16, 1967 through January 1, 1968]\n\n1968 : The summer of ‘68, Tomorrowland Stage was host to four variety shows daily. There was an “18 member group comprised of talent drawn from colleges and universities” and a Special Vaudeville Show featuring headline talent and variety acts, Monday thru Friday. Disneyland “Spring Fling” (occurring April 6th, 1968) brought The Mustangs (with Special Guest Bobby Vee) to the Tomorrowland Stage! The Country Music Jubilee of 1968 (starring Noel Boggs and His Band, Harry Newman, Brad Melton and Cathie Taylor, with guest MCs) had three shows daily, performed at 3, 5, and 7. On August 12, 1969, the true-life Apollo Moon Landing was watched live with the help of a giant screen on the Tomorrowland Stage.\n\nDuring 1968, “On Stage USA” may have been presented from the Tomorrowland Stage. Acts included Jack Carter and Jaye P. Morgan (July 29-August 2), Phyllis Diller (August 12-16), Bill Dana & Theresa Brewer (August 19-23). During 1968, the “Country Music Jubilee” may also have been performed from the Tomorrowaland Stage with acts including Minnie Pearl (August 4), Roy Clark (August 11), Judy Lynn Show (August 18), and Horner & Jethro (August 25).\n\n1969 : The Tomorrowland Stage also hosted dancing and live bands during Spring Fling 1969! Sunday June 29th brought the Country Music Jubilee (starring Homer & Jethro, Charlie Louvin & The Gang, and Cathie Taylor, with guest MCs). Shows were performed at 3, 5, and 7. Henson Cargill performed one night - Sunday, June 6th.\n\nWithout a doubt, the most momentous event to ever occur on the Tomorrowland stage was the viewing of an event which was occurring some 238,900 miles away - that of the Apollo Moon Landing, on July 20, 1969. This was the very same Apollo mission on which Astronaut Gene Cernan wore his Mickey Mouse watch. The entire event was broadcast live on the Tomorrowland Stage (the future site of Space Mountain and Captain EO).\n\nDuring the following days (July 21 - 25), On Stage U.S.A. ran, including Tony Martin, Shari Lewis, the Fuller Brothers, Patti Page, the Doodletown Pipers, and special guest musical director John Scott Trotter.

These appeared (with Space Mountain) during the summer off 1977.\n\n1978 : It was “showtime” and “get-up-and-go-time” as the members of the New Mickey Mouse Club often made promotional live performances during the era contemporaneous with its late 1970s televised run (appearing during both the summer of 1977 and the summer of 1978 inside Disneyland). The New Mouseketeers Show again entertained throngs of cheering Disneyland guests on June 29, 30, and July 1, July 30 - August 5, 1978. The Kids of the Kingdom starred in a separate daytime show during this period. September 3-9, 1978, The Magnificent Music ‘N’ Motion Machine Starring Papa Doo Run Run and Lite Fantastic delighted guests daily Monday thru Saturday, at 8:15 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. The All American College Singers and the Kids of the Kingdom performed during four shows (during afternoons during July 30 - August 5, 1978), while The Magnificent Music ‘N’ Motion Machine starring Papa Doo Run Run and Lite Fantastic performed three shows (11:00 a.m., 12:30 & 1:30 p.m.) in the morning and early afternoon.

The (c. June, 1981) show was described as a “new singing, dancing, salute to the worlds of Hollywood, Broadway, Big Brass Bands, and the Big Top.” Sing!Dance!Disney! was “a medley of popular Disney tunes presented live by a group of energetic Disneyland performers”! Michael Iceberg & the Iceberg Machine, Krash, and Papa Doo Run Run performed during daytimes and evenings.\n\nTruly, the highlight of all shows came when Halyx debuted their “unearthly sights and outrageous new rock sounds” from the Tomorrowland Stage (from June 20th-September 11th) during the summer of 1981. This act (of humans, extra-terrestrials and artificial intelligence) is something that needs to be seen to be believed!\n\n1982 : Disneyland Easter Party brought Peaches and Herb to the Space Stage (April 3-10, twice nightly, at 8:30pm and 10:30pm.\n\n1983 : February 12 & 13, 1983 the L.A.

During the nighttime, Porter Wagoner, Mel Tillis, Charly McClain, and Boxcar Willie each performed three shows!\n\nAll-New Mickey Mouseketeer Julie Piekarski remembers performing at Disneyland. In interview with Disney History 101 Corespondent, she recalled :\n\n“We performed at Disneyland. We did three shows a day, six days a week for thirteen weeks, and also two parades a day. And I have to tell you, it was amazing! It was not like work.\n\nI was like thirteen or fourteen years old at the time, and who wouldn’t love going to Disneyland everyday? It was awesome! …We were on the ‘Space Mountain Stage’. That’s the one I remember most. We did do one performance during Easter Time and we were by the Small World Stage. But my favorite was when we did the Space Mountain Shows and we were there for almost a whole summer. Whenever there was a break, we got to go and ride Space Mountain (like several times in a row). Then we would go and eat lunch and go back and do a show. That was a really great memory to have, for sure!…\n\nI loved doing the singing and the dancing! We did some Broadway revue shows. And then we did the 60s, the 70s, and the 80s theme show. But a number that I really enjoyed doing was a number called ‘Friends’ which was originally written for our show - the Mickey Mouse Club. We would… sing it, and then we would get to go out into the audience and bring up someone from the audience… That was really cool! We’d get out there. We were always excited, scoping out the audience… who we thought we’d bring up. And what was really amazing and sweet is that we were there for so many weeks in a row that we had a fan base that would keep coming back to every show, every day, throughout the whole summer. We kinda got to know our fans, which I loved and I treasured. That was one of the most memorable experiences - that I would get to go down into the audience, bring up these fans. They looked up to us (and we’re just regular people), but it was so cool to have them up on the stage with us, and we would sing our song ‘Friends’ to them. I really enjoyed doing that.”\n\nJulie also recalled when they filmed the All-New Mickey Mouse Club television show at Disneyland. “Friday was Showtime Day, and it was done at Disneyland. We would have our Honorary Mouseketeers come on at that time. We went to Disneyland for two weeks out, to film all those shows. We got to actually be in the Park when it was closed. We would get there really early in the morning and we’d also film during the day. They would block off our area in Carnation Plaza and then we’d also stay at night when the Park was closed. It was too cool just to be in the Park and nobody else was around. It was so quiet.”\n\nThere are several memories that Julie carries with her from this experience. “I got to be in charge of Mickey. Mickey would be in our shows at the end… and I would get to go ‘Off Stage’ and hold his hand and walk him ‘On.’ That was just a really amazing experience to think that I had that honor and that responsibility. The was really neat.”\n\nThe Kids of the Kingdom were singers, dancers, and college talent which made numerous daytime performances from the Space Stage during the early 1970s. Back on November 24, 1970, the Kids of the Kingdom performed at an international Bank of America convention in San Francisco. They previewed their new routine that they would perform on New Year’s Day atop Bank of America’s entry into the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. Among the group was ”Linda Piesik, Rich Briggs, Tom Ranier, Amy Sheridan, Connie Bubar, Jim Eskew, Lady Lee, Gerald Lee, Candy Herzer, Paul Hough, Jim Schick, Sherman Segraves, Kathy McFadden, Vince Pirillo, and Joe Croyle. Also along for the trip were Barnette Ricci, Ron Swartz, and Sonny Anderson, all of Entertainment.” [“Inside Disneyland,” Vol.5, No.1]\n\nThey even performed here alongside the Osmonds for a television special! They were part of the 1975 daytime entertainment in Disneyland during the celebration of the American Bicentennial. During the 1980s, the Kids of the Kingdom headed east, and performed in The Magic Kingdom, and they even performed at Tokyo Disneyland after the Park opened on April 15, 1983.\n\n“Brochures were sent to junior colleges and universities across America detailing the unique workshop offered on the Disneyland and Disney World ‘campus,’” according to Disneyland LINE (published August 6, 1975).\n\nAccording to the same Disneyland LINE article, that same year (of 1975), there were “700 inquiries for additional information, some 400 video-tape auditions…received for consideration, This method of selection resulted in 93 musicians who will perform on both Disney stages for 10 weeks, yielding the above unorthodox equation.\n\nThe taped auditions were viewed and judged by Larry Billman, Barnette Ricci and Gerry Schroeder who selected Disneyland’s Kids of the Kingdom. Besides the Kids - 6 males & 6 females - an additional 8 musicians were selected for the stage band ; trombone, electric bass, 2 trumpets, guitar, piano, traps and a saxophone player who doubles on the flutes and clarinet. This composition is duplicated at Walt Disney World, resulting in a similar company.\n\nChoreographed by Barnette, the show emphasizes our Bicentennial Sumer of ‘75 and begins when Tony Moore runs on-stage and proclaims ‘…And for the next 20 minutes we’re going to show you why we love America!’\n\nThe Kids for 1975 arrived June 15 for orientation. In the morning they were introduced to Ron Swartz, Director of Operations in Entertainment, and were briefed on the summer’s expectations for Disneyland’s Kids of the Kingdom. Beginning 10 days of intensive rehearsals, they worked under the able direction of Gerry Schroeder from Golden West College, Larry Boye from Ball State, Indiana who leads the vocal group in Florida.”\n\n“Production - Where the Universe Begins”\n\nThe 16-minute, child-like and imaginative 3-D film (with its mesmerizing, and hauntingly beautiful theme), was directed by the then-experimental film director and producer Murray Lerner (Academy Award, 1980 ; Best Documentary Feature “From Mao to Mozart”). Rick Carter (who would, decades later, go on to serve as Art Director and Production Designer for James Cameron’s Avatar) was integral to the animation design of the film. The final film’s surreal usage of distinct and profound imagery - of clouds, dandelions, kites, a pegasus, the circus, and a magician - certainly helped viewers of all ages “make memories”. According to the Disney News (Summer, 1984), “Beginning with a handful of children racing against a meadow and gazing at clouds, it also brings a frothy pink-and-white cluster of spring blossoms right to the tip of your nose. The sense of proximity is so realistic that more than one visitor reaches out to touch them. Dandelion spores float through the air , turn into stars, and are then transformed into a sun whose rays become water right before your eyes. In another scene, a child’s kite changes from a bird to fish to a whole school of fish, to a flock of birds, bird wings, the flying horse Pegasus, a real horse, and then a spirited steed on a merry-go-round. The brass harness ring of the carousel horse floats out at the audience, tempting all to try to catch it. Then the ring itself turns into a moon, then bats, then frightening witches and their masks and finally the sphinx.”\n\nMany-a-guest (temporarily transported inside a child’s imagination) would be left wondering, “Do they mirror what we think, or sense, or feel?” These unusual (and animated) visuals were created by Colossal Pictures, at a time when CGI was experimental and new. In fact, long before Pixar’s animated feature-length theatrical smash-hit Toy Story, the 3-D 70mm “Magic Journeys” was a contender in the Pixar Short Film Festival. “Magic Journeys” holds a record as the first 3-D motion picture to feature computer generated 3-D animation. Last, (but no less-essential to the film’s success), is the film’s theme song (or, score). “Magic Journeys” (for which the film was named) was both written and composed by the “Legendary” Richard Sherman and Robert Sherman, and sung by the Disney Studio Chorus. It is (in our opinion) the most beautiful piece that the duo has ever conceived! Richard and Robert would also write and compose the memorable “Makin’ Memories” for the pre-show area of the attraction.\n\n“From Disneyland to Walt Disney World - All At Once, You’re On Your Way”\n\n“Magic Journeys” had its appropriate debut at Walt Disney World EPCOT Center’s Imagination Pavilion, on October 1st, 1982). From EPCOT Center’s opening day, guests would “soar on the wings of imagination” in a way like never before, at a Disney Park. Two years later (and hot on the heals of its Epcot Center success), the exciting new 3-D film would also open at Disneyland. The venue where it would debut would be called the “Magic Eye Theater” (sponsored by Kodak Film). Though under construction, its soon-to-open its doors excited Tomorrowland guests. “Magic Journeys” would officially open at the brand new air-conditioned Tomorrowland “Magic Eye Theater” on June 16th, 1984. “Magic Journeys” was such a popular attraction, that a third film was sent to Tokyo Disneyland, and opened January 17, 1985 (replacing the film “Eternal Seas”). By this time a total of three separate Disney Parks screens were showing the one-time experimental film - “Magic Journeys”!\n\n“In A Flash They Disappear”\n\nA year later (in 1986), “on the wings of unexpected sounds and sights”, “Magic Journeys” finally departed from both EPCOT Center (during February 9th, 1986) and Disneyland (during July of 1986). Tokyo Disneyland was the last venue to close “Magic Journeys”, doing so during 1987. Within just two short years (by about May of 1986) of showing at Disneyland, the popular short film not only proved the potential success of 3-D animation, but the popularity of Disneyland’s own 3-D Magic Eye Theater, and this would open the door for other new adventures for decades to come! In fact, few months later, a new adventure unlike any other would debut at both the Magic Eye Theater at Disneyland and the Journey Into Imagination Pavilion at EPCOT Center!\n\n“No Beginning, And No Ending”\n\nDuring 1987, our collective “Magic Journeys” seemingly came to an end. However, this enchanting attraction (featuring some of the most cinematically ground-breaking imagery) was just too good to dispose of. As “fortuosity” would have it, another venue would soon become available, when a popular attraction would also make its move to Tokyo Disneyland. Yes, on December 15th, 1987, Magic Journeys would again debut (for its 3rd time running), this time in Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom’s own Fantasyland Theater, replacing the Mickey Mouse Revue. At this location, the “Magic Journeys” would continue for a six-year run (this time, until December 1st, 1993)!\n\nBy the end, the show bears the distinction of running on a total of four major Disney Parks screens (i.e. Disneyland Magic Eye Theater, Magic Kingdom Fantasyland Theater, EPCOT Center’s Journey Into Imagination Pavilion, and Tokyo Disneyland).\n\n“Far From ‘An Un-Remembered Dream’”\n\nDecades after the films debut, the imagery and the sounds of “Magic Journeys” prove it to be far from “an unremembered dream”. Still, many for audience members look back on our “Magic Journeys”, perhaps wondering “Were they real?”. For those that recollect the attraction, we search for touchstones to help us relive this attraction once again. Will the film see some form of a limited release at some time in the future? This remains to be seen. Though we currently don’t have any “Magic Journeys”Vintage Views in our gallery at Disney History 101, we hope to have caught just a few “little pieces of time, making them yours, and making them mine”, with our retrospective on the attraction!\n\nFIRST RUN (September 18, 1986 - April 6, 1997)\n\nSECOND RUN (February 23, 2010 -)\n\n\"Disneyland Enters a Whole New Dimension\"\n\nCaptain EO was 3-D motion picture space adventure in Tomorrowland at DISNEYLAND, TOKYO DISNEYLAND, and in Discoveryland at DISNEYLAND PARIS.\n\nJust how does an attraction like this come to reality? Disneyland LINE (published September 11, 1986) explains : ”’It was said that Michael Jackson was a Disney aficionado’, recalls Michael Eisner. ‘So we called him and asked if he would like to do something with the Parks. He said definitely, but only of we could get George Lucas involved. Meanwhile, George had been saying he’d do something but would have to have someone as talented as Michael Jackson be in it. So then we got Michael and George, and they both said we needed a director that was without equal. And we went right to Francis Coppola.”\n\nFrancis Coppola was truly without equal during the era, having directing award winning films as Caddyshack and Yentl. Another talent included the renowned Italian cinematographer Vitorio Storaro, who acted as a visual consultant during the two week shoot. John Napier acted as theater and costume consultant to Captain EO.\n\nA version of the script entitled “Captain Eo and the Space Knights” had been prepared by April 29, 1985. That draft of the script was almost recognizable with characters Captain EO, Major Domo, Minor Domo, Ody & Idy, Flutter, and “an odd-looking three foot high pink elephant-like creature called Hooter.” The villain - the “High Leader” - is also referred to as the “High Witch” I the script.\n\nJoe Rohde was a designer for the Captain EO 3-D film. Joe believed: “We design places. My philosophy about research is that in order to make places, you have to know places, and in order to know places, you have to go to them.”\n\nThe planets were certainly “lining up…and bringing brighter days” as the new show headed to the Magic Eye Theater during the Fall of 1986! Yes, the Walt Disney Company, Executive Producer George Lucas, invited audiences to experience a “once-in-a-lifetime motion picture experience” - a 3-D musical space adventure starring Michael Jackson singing original songs, in a Francis Ford Coppola film written by George Lucas! Only two theaters in the world would exclusively run this film - and one of them was at Disneyland! Soon, Space ships and lasers shot over the audiences’ heads, and Michael Jackson seemed to dance right off the screen and toward guests in crystal clear 70mm 3-D stereo film images. In addition, pyrotechnics enhanced the show experience. By Sunday, May 15th, the televised audiences were treated to a behind-the-scenes look of the production in “Captain EO - Backstage,” hosted by Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nOn July 24th 1986, at 9:00 pm, a Private Screening of the 17-minute film Captain EO was held in Tomorrowland’s Kodak Magic Eye Theater. A few months later (and in the great tradition of Disneyland attraction opening events), the Captain EO Grand Opening Parade and Grand Opening NBC Television Special was recorded live (by Marty Pasetta Productions) from Disneyland on Saturday, September 13, 1986. The Galactic Premier of Captain EO (for Cast Members) occurred five days later, on Thursday, September 18th, 1986 (from 8:00 PM to Midnight), including a complimentary meal at The Space Place or Tomorrowland Terrace. The public unveiling took place the following day (on September 19th), a day before the television special (hosted by Patrick Duffy and Justine Bateman) aired on Saturday, September 20, on NBC. Horseless Carriage Club of Southern California members (wearing turn-of-the-century wardrobe) shuttled approximately 75 notable celebrities (like Margot Kidder, Jane Fonda, O.J. Simpson, Patrick Duffy, Dorothy Hamill, Charles Bronson, Alan Thicke, and Nell Carter) down Main Street U.S.A. and toward a reception at the Plaza Inn. (As a “sidelight”, Marty Pasetta Productions made a donation to the Horseless Carriage Club of Southern California in a special agreement).\n\nThere, the invited guests awaited the grand ribbon cutting ceremony presided over by Francis Coppola, Anjelica Huston, and George Lucas. Then the invited guests were off to the big “Premiere” showing under the fiber optic star field! As guests exited the Magic Eye Theater, an instrumental track of Michael Jackson’s “Another Part of Me” (originally recorded during 1985 and 1986) could be heard. Even more - guests who were “there to change the world” during the Premier Weekend, could exchange their ticket vouchers for a “Captain EO Starfighter T-Shirt.” The premier party continued for a total of 60 hours, until 10 p.m., on September 21st.\n\nBy August 21, 1986, \"Captain EO“ Attractions Hosts and Hostesses administered the following Theater Load Live Spiel: “Please move all the way across your row, filling in every available seat. The 3-D glasses are designed to fit comfortably over your prescription glasses. At the conclusion of Captain EO, we ask that you return the glasses to the bins after you exit the theater. The glasses were not intended for use outside of this theater and will impair your normal vision.”\n\nCelebrations were in order for Walt Disney Company employees at “Walt Disney Imagineeringland” on November 15 & 16, 1997. A Captain EO Video Insert Stage was shown every half hour beginning at 9:30.\n\nCaptain EO returned for another run (as a posthumous tribute to the “King of Pop”), starting February 23, 2010. The attraction was then billed as Captain EO Tribute! It ran until sometime before Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy sneak peek (in on July 4th, 2014)."
