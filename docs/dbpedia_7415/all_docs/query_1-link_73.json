The delay merely heightened the pandemonium in the Auditorium.\n\nThirty minutes before his arrival, the big hall started rocking with waves of rhythmic applause and cries of “We Want Elvis!” The crescendo mounted to a hysterical pitch when the stage lights came on.\n\nThe curtain parted and a blue jacketed master of ceremonies bubbled: “Bless your hearts, you’re going to get him.” That touched off another round of screaming.\n\nThen the crowd booed and hissed intermittently as another act performed. Plainly they wanted Elvis.\n\nIn Person; In Purple\n\nThe master of ceremonies returned, fumbled through an introduction that no one cared to hear and then it happened.\n\nOut of the curtains on the right emerged a broadly smiling Presley, garbed in a violet purple coat and black silk slacks. A guitar was draped over his shoulders as he slinked toward the microphone.\n\nInstantly, the crowd was on its feet, screaming and waving. The front rows surged forward.\n\nPresley continued to beam, wrestled the microphone toward him and suddenly burst into the opening notes of his most popular song “Heartbreak Hotel.”\n\nThat was more than the teenagers could take sitting down. On the left side of the auditorium, they rose in a body and stormed down the aisle, then stood screaming on the brink of the stage.\n\nPresley gyrated wildly on stage, drawing louder screams each time he flicked a leg in hula dancer fashion.\n\nPolice Herd Them Back\n\nPolicemen scrambled down the aisle after the teen-agers and finally persuaded them to return to their seats.\n\nThe screaming never subsided during the rendition.\n\nThe notes came through only now and then, but it didn’t matter.\n\nREALLY SENDS ‘EM – Elvis Presley “sent” these teen-agers “a-rockin and a-roll-in” while singing and shaking out one of his self-styled “hi want you, hi need you” songs. This front row scene was typical in the packed Robinson Auditorium last night. The ticket demand was so great that Presley presented a second show.\n\nArkansas Democrat Photo by Cranford Little Rock Public Library\n\n‘Elvis Rocks Little Rock’ CD | Elvis Presley Bootlegs\n\nLittle Rock Columnist was Fair to Elvis Presley in 1956\n\nLooking back: Elvis Presley visits Robinson Auditorium on May 16, 1956\n\nEngagement – Tour Ref: 1956\n\nInfo: Date: Venue: Location: Showtime: Crowd: Show type: Pics: Ads: Info May 16 1956 Robinson Auditorium Little Rock AR (7:00 PM) Yes Info May 16 1956 Robinson Auditorium Little Rock AR (9:30 PM) Yes\n\nThe Presleys lived at Audobon Drive\n\nMay 16, 1957\n\nJailhouse Rock production\n\nThe Presleys lived at Audobon Drive, Graceland purchased on March 19.\n\nThe Military Service Disruption\n\nMay 16, 1958\n\nMilitary service at Fort Hood in Texas., for basic training as part of the Second Armored Division.
