        "text": "”It was appropriate, then, that Vicki Peterson opened the Troubadour show alongside her husband John Cowsill. Peterson, of course, is best known as a member of the Bangles, while Cowsill was in family band the Cowsills. For two decades, he’s been the drummer in the Mike Love-led Beach Boys too.\n\nIt’s wonderful to see Peterson and Cowsill on stage together; not only is their affection for each other beautifully evident, but their harmonies are gorgeous. To be fair, the Cowsills, the Beach Boys and the Bangles are all known for their harmonies so it only makes sense. They opened with the Cowsills band song “You In My Mind,” and played a couple of songs by John’s late brothers — Barry’s “Come to Me” and Billy’s “Vagabond.”\n\nClick the link below for the full article:\n\n​\n\nwww.laweekly.com/the-dream-syndicate-find-themselves-at-the-troubadour/\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nVicki Peterson of The Bangles (whose work includes #1 hit “Walk Like An Egyptian” and several other Top 10 songs, such as “Eternal Flame” which is the biggest single by an all-female band in history) teams up with John Cowsill, drummer/vocalist for The Beach Boys for over 23 years and original member of the platinum-selling family band, The Cowsills to lovingly present their debut Americana album comprised of songs written by John’s brothers, Barry and Bill Cowsill titled, Long After The Fire.\n\n​. . . MORE ABOUT US\n\n​\n\nVicki is a founding member of the 1980’s group The Bangles, one of the most successful bands of that decade with over 6 million gold and platinum albums sold. The band’s music has transcended generations with more than 6 million current monthly listeners on streaming platforms, 300 million views on TikTok, and over half a billion channel views on YouTube as of 2024.\n\nPeterson later wrote and performed with her good friend (and eventual sister-in-law) Susan Cowsill as The Psycho Sisters. The duo soon found themselves absorbed into the critically acclaimed New Orleans’ songwriters collective The Continental Drifters, and remain with them today. Throughout the 90’s, Vicki stayed active appearing on albums with Tom Petty, John Doe, Belinda Carlisle and also toured with The Go-Go’s on their 1994-1995 reunion tour. The Bangles reunited in the 21st century to release four more albums, including a collection of rarities, and a collaboration with the Los Angeles bands Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade and the Three O’Clock.\n\nJohn began working in clubs, singing and playing drums with his brothers when he was seven years old. The band grew to include their mother and little sister and The Cowsills became a worldwide sensation in the late 1960’s, enjoying several Top 20 hits including “Hair” (#1 in four countries and #2 on US Billboard) and “The Rain, The Park, & Other Things” (#2 on US Billboard with over 3 million copies sold).\n\nIn 1981, John landed on the Tommy Tutone hit, “867-5309 (Jenny).” He also toured with Jan and Dean before becoming a mainstay of the Beach Boys touring band, playing guitar, piano, and finally sitting at the drum kit for over two decades.\n\n​Throughout his career, John has performed live and/or recorded work with Bob Dylan, Mamas & Papas, Harry Chapin, The Smithereens, Maroon 5, Hermans Hermits, Mickey Dolenz (The Monkees), and Chuck Berry."
