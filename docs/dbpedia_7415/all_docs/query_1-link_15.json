The endorsements below are for the Extreme Isolation headphones on our site.\n\nPaul Gilbert has been playing loud electric guitar since he was eleven years old.

Save your ears too!”\n\nwww.paulgilbert.com\n\n“To put it simply, these are the best sounding isolation headphones on the market. The audio clarity is amazing and they are ‘extremely’ comfortable to wear.

For years I have made my own headphones for the studio as I had trouble finding anything that would give me the isolation that I needed and the sound quality at the same time. I am so excited to have found my ideal solution. The EX-29 is by far the best isolation headphone on the market today.”\n\nRyan Hoyle, Collective Soul www.ryanhoyle.com\n\n“I have been using the Extreme Isolation Headphones now for 5 years, and in terms of overall quality, endurance and performance, nothing comes close!!!!! I have used them on every Megadeth record I have performed on, and even on an entire tour leg back in 2004, when I was suffering from extreme ear infection and vertigo – The Extreme Isolation Headphones literally saved my ears from further damage, and for that alone I owe a lot of gratitude to them. I simply will not use anything else, end of story.”\n\nShawn Drover MEGADETH www.megadeth.com\n\n“I can hear the click but I don’t hear the Guitar. Can you turn the drums down in the cans? I don’t feel like I’m in the pocket with the bass and piano. These are things I don’t have to say or worry about since I’ve had my Extreme Isolation headphones. I can play the music with more feeling and expression because I hear everything so much better. Extreme Isolation headphones made for drummers by a drummer. Only one thing could be better-every body in the room has a pair.”\n\nCharles Collins\n\n“Being involved in both the music and voiceover industries, the headphones I use serve many purposes. Not only is isolation a key factor, but sound quality, durability and comfort are all important as well. My clientele is a mix of both long-time musicians who are accustomed to working in the studio and new aspiring voice talent to whom the studio experience is a brand new adventure. The Direct Sound EX 29’s work well for both the seasoned professional as well as the novice. In fact, we have even started recommending these headphones to graduates of our classes through Voices For All, our voiceover education and training company, for use in their home studios.”\n\nPaul Benedetti Founder and Managing Partner, Voices For All www.voicesforall.com Paul Benedetti\n\nFivefold during rehearsal using JamHub’s TourBus silent rehearsal studio and Your Essential Headphone Kit, the perfect match!

I laughed the first time I came up against a Marshall stack 8 feet away. Truly incredible.”\n\nJohn Cowsill began his career as a drummer and singer at the tender age of seven, playing clubs in Newport, Rhode Island, with his brothers. The Cowsills became a sensation in the late sixties, earning several top 10 hits, numerous television appearances (including their own hour-long TV special), and touring worldwide. After the family members went their separate ways in the early seventies, John played drums, percussion and sang with artists as diverse as Dwight Twilley, Bette Midler, Tommy Tutone and The Smithereens. He has also worked with Buzzy Feton, Billy Payne, Ernie Watts, Harry Chapin and the Bangles (his wife is the Bangles’ Vicki Peterson). During the eighties, John toured with Jan and Dean, who introduced him to Mike Love. John joined the Beach Boys in 2000, initially as a featured vocalist playing piano and percussion. John is presently back in his comfort zone–the drum seat–playing, singing, and touring year-round with the Beach Boys.\n\nFor a list of current Beach Boys dates, go to Beachboysfanclub.com for tour info.\n\n“I was using the Extreme Isolation Headphones in the studio, recording our latest album ‘Doomsday Machine’…They are both comfortable and isolate good enough to get separation from the acoustic drum sound.

All the best and thanks!”\n\nLarry Aberman – Currently performing with Cirque du Soleil’s “Zumanity” at New York New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas | www.larryaberman.com\n\n“Extreme Headphones are an important tool in my musical life. I practice with them without music for ear protection, I plug them in my Ipod, when I am preparing for a show so I can practice with the music. (the headphones allow me to hear the music over the drums which, is really nice.) I also use them when I am recording in my home studio for track playback. I really do enjoy my Extreme Headphones, they are VERY USFUL in many ways!”\n\nGaylelynn McKinney, drummer myspace.com/gayelynnmckinney\n\n“I recommend the EX-29 to anyone working in the audio field at any level: from the amateur to the experienced professional.”\n\nExtreme Isolation Headphones advocate Enrico Sesselego is an internationally respected instructor and recording engineer who has worked with The Yardbirds, Jeff Beck, Steve Vai, Slash, and Paul Gilbert among many others in the music industry.\n\nEnrico Sesselego\n\n“These headphones have the most clean and balanced sound I ever had during a studio recording or practicing.

I am taking them on our second tour to Europe to use live. They are truly amazing.”\n\nMike Young, aka “Powder,” drummer for “The Saddle Tramps”\n\n“Concentration is everything to me when I am in the studio. Direct Sounds Extreme Isolation headphones help keep me focused on the only sound I needed to hear… me!”\n\nA-me, Shock City Records recording artist www.myspace.com/listentoame\n\nA-me\n\n“In Shock City Studios’ Control Room A we can mix at up to 124 dB and trust us, every client wants to. To protect the mix we must protect our ears by using Extreme Isolation Headphones. They allow us to listen critically while blocking up to 29 dB of ambient sound! They are also great for tracking singers and acoustic players because they also keep the sound in… that means no click tracks or scratch takes bleeding into the mic. Our studio would not be complete without them. The secret is out, they’re not just for drummers anymore.”\n\nChris Loesch & Doug Firley Co-Owners & Producers Shock City Studios, St. Louis, MO www.shockcitystudios.com\n\nShock City\n\nIsaiah Fogle, a young drummer on a mission!

I use them for live shows instead of floor monitors, as well as using them in the studio. They are awesome, especially when using a click track. After being onstage my ears used to ring quite often.

Everyone there has always gone the extra mile and beyond to assist me.”\n\nSheldon “RocKit” Miller Drummer with “On The Rocks” (Seattle) www.myspace.com/sheldondrums\n\nRobert Lunte is the founder of the internationally renowned contemporary voice training studio known as, The Vocalist Studio.
