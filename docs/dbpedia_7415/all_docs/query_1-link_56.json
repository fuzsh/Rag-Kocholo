Where in the past the motor car manufacturers bragged about \"3-passenger seats\", this year some seats are nearlyroomy enough for four persons. Fifty-five inch front seats make their appearance on the new Hudsons and Terraplanes, and a new idea in \"yard\" sticks— a fifty-five inch \"yard\" stick— is being used to dramatize the great width of these 1937 automobile seats. The above picture shows a Hud- son representative using the fifty-five inch \"yard\" stick to demonstrate the wide front seat in a Terraplane.

By EDITH M. BARBER T\"\\TETS or drug's? The pendulum ■-* swings. A generation ago the American people dosed themselves liberally with patent products, for definite ailments and for that \"run- down feeling.\" The discovery of the importance of proper diet both for the prevention of illness and, to some extent, for its curative powers, especially after the discussion of the vitamin question had become com- mon, resulted in a new attitude toward the foodj question. It also resulted in a new type of medicinal products which, while offered us at drug stores, are actually food con- centrates. Now forms of codliver oil for the sake of its vitamins A and D con- tent, haliver oil with its especially huh vitamin A as well as D content, sometimes in the irradiated form, for the sake of the large amount of vitamin D. are now often pre- GLENCOE GALLATIN COUNTY Charles Nesbit Kirby of Cincin- nati, spent the holidays With hi? grandparents Mr. and Mrs. C.

Calcium and phosphorus concentrates are now available, prepared from fresh milk, and are particularly useful in cases where milk itself can not be used in the amounts necessary, as well as in special conditions such as preg- nancy and certain skin diseases. Instead of old - fashioned tonics, concentrated foods made from co- conuts, bananas and milk are often regommended. For certain condi- tions, especially in intestinal dis- turbances, vitamin B and C concen- trates prepared from yeast or wheat germ are available. You may even get in capsule form combinations of four vitamins, A, B, D and G. In case you can not take vitamins A and D in oil or capsule form, you may now take them through injec- tions directly into the muscles. The fact that these products are avail- able does not, of course, make it any less important to choose a well rounded diet which, excepting in ! the case of children who need extra vitamin D. will usually prevent con- ditions which need special dietary^ drug treatment.

Attendants seize sec- tions of the powerful body and trail after Lantz. Within thirty seconds Blondie is pinned to the floor — seven attend- ants on board. • After feeding, the python's teeth are examined and occasionally a lit- tle dental work is required. Armed with forceps, cotton and antiseptics, the dentist explores the reptile's upper and lower jaws for loose teeth which pythons try to shed. IF i IT IS WALTON & READNOUR WALTON, KY.

Population to Near Peak of 135,000,000 by 1950 Washington. — The slowing down of the growth in population, re- vealed by the Bureau of the Census, lends credibility to forecasts by gov- ernment sociologists that population may reach a peak of 135,000,000 perspns by 1950, become stationary for a while, and then decline. The decrease in population growth is attributed chiefly to immigration restrictions. A contributing factor has been the declining birthrate. Births have increased slightly in the last two years, but the increase is regardea as a temporary interrup- tion of a long time down trend. The population slightly more than doubled between 1890 and 1935 to 127,521,000 estimated as of July I, 1935, by the Bureau of Census. Cur- rently, the population numbers more than 128,000,000 persons. P RINTIN G OF ANY KIND YOU WANT WE CAN DO IT Prices Reasonable ~WRI' MOTTO WALTON ADVERTISER WALTON KY.
