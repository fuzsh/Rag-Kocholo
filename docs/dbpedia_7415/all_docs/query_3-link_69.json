The mighty Dwarves finally get the big spot' Here He Who Cannot Be Named rocks out. Photo by Krk, color manipulation by Hal Lovie. oops by Pete T Barnes that man has tost his head and the children think it's funny. they play keepaway from the rest of his body as it runs around sightless tripping over pumpkins and melons that just won't do as a temporary substitute. he should've kept it better fastened, I think, for a policeman might approach and say are you trying to be clever? * and he couldn't answer. the poor fellow, mocked by elementary school brats, but how can one resist tossing about a ball that talks? Go Paper Boat by Upside-Down Brown Self-Indulged by Gtandy Doone Hast week 3 saw a little brown cockroach crawling on the formica of my kitchen table as 3 was eating a doughnut for breakfast .Actually. the cockroach wasn't so little, and since 3 had nothing to squash it with. 3 captured it in my hand. 0 thought of throwing the cockroach down the sink hole, but decided it might crawl back out. and reappear later on top of my kitchen table once again. 3 thought of throwing the cockroach onto the floor and crushing it with my foot, except that 3 had on no shoes or stockings and a feeling of squeamishness kept me from killing the cockroach in this manner as weLL JAs the little legs of the cockroach were by this point tickling the palm of my hand intolerably. 3 decided that any action, however rash. mou\\A comfort me far greater than no action at alL So 3 ate the cockroach. OMow. my belly is near bursting with cockroaches. Occasionally, one or two of the cockroaches will crawl from my anus, and 3 will kill them. Dut for the most part, the company of cockroaches remain perfectly contented within my stomach. 3 once thought about taking a large kitchen knife and slitting myself in the belly to release all the cockroaches living inside me. Dut 3 decided not to. Just the thought of all those cockroaches crawling all over my flesh damn near kills me. This paper boat I made out of paper went sailing down the gutter because there was all this water going down it and I was running alongside of it going \"Go, paper boat go!\" Bad Husband by Charlie Paulson Do you, violence, agree to take this race, human, as your lawfully wedded wife? Do you say okay to the program in which you will overwhelm the faculties of common sense; disable the mechanism that replaces conflict with conversation; will you kick the shit out of cute domesticated animals, and push around anyone who blocks the light you pretend to read by, justifying your motives even though they be ugly and irrational? Oh yes oh yes, pucker up, send us to the conjugal bed, - Reverend, you know it; of course. Do you, humanity, accept this vile, unmerciful butcher as your number one bud. Will you be there morning, noon and night to nurture, fellatiate and stroke this nastiest of spouses. Are you prepared to let it lay waste to benevolence, except as a ruse for fostering more pain and/or destruction? Don? bother answering. The wedding march was marched by soldiers throwing handfuls of gunpowder, and the open bar served blood on tap. There was laughter in the streets and Yippee- ki-yay behind the triggers and cannons. and all these cars were honking at me because I was blocking their way and they had to get to work; I mooned them, flipped them off and said \"oh yeah, I’ve gotta work too, and besides, I’m not polluting like you;\" and the drivers all stuck their toupeed heads out the window and said \"Oh yeah, what about that litter?\" and I looked over as the boat went down the sewer~OH!~But it came out of the next manhole because it wasn’t ready to die, there was still more raging torrents to conquer and it took a left on Main and I made the bus wait while I crossed against a red chasing the boat and it stopped to save a little rat from drowning and the rat became its captain but he didn’t get a power complex; Serial murderers replaced Gandhi and King on t-shirts and there were protests when there was no war. Satan ran into a dark cellar, fleeing the mod that wanted his horns and tail for fireplace trophies. Those who had tried to object to the marriage were excommunicated. Rumor has it they're out there, pooling their resources, spreading propaganda to recruit members for their crusade. because he knew the boat was his equal and should be treated like a brother or sister if Mom’s around; I was really surprised that the boat wasn’t getting soggy - it must’ve been made out of absorbing-proof paper and it picked up speed and so did I even though I was getting kind of tired because I didn’t have any breakfast because who’s got time for breakfast when there are raging torrents to deal with? An agent of violence who hasn? been heard from since, eavesdropped on one of their meetings. He wasn? quite sure what they were discussing, but he heard them chanting something that sounded like di-vorce, di¬ vorce, DIVORCE. The Hunchback by Kastle Combs The hunchback takes a seat among the erect, to be confronted by overpowering stares and sideward glances. Muttering and cursing the self confident, he forgets how to remember, leaving kindness and sorrow behind. Slouching, he stands, and lags alongside his broken dreams. The remnants of newly dying roses weigh heavy upon his soul. His heart, a clenched fist, bites back tears of lost hope and desire. Peering out from darkened sockets, the inner blackness comes forth like a junk in the mist His visions; altered by cruelty, his mind; adjusted by contempt. The T.V. Diner Culture Poem (excerpt) by Ken DiMaggio that’s where I get my culture from! from McNewspapers that read like McDonalds and from McNovels that read like Me- Cheeseburgers and from McMovies with the depth of Quarter Pounders and from McMusic pre-packaged and trayed like french fries Big Macs and other micro- fried things in styrofoam containers yes that’s how I get my culture a culture that unthinkingly places killers along side of Santas and Santas along side of Coca Cola and Coca Cola along side of the killing fields of Cambodia along side of newly built Polynesianed- styled retirement villages in Florida! That's how I get my culture! which is why it makes sense to be mediocre genocidal unimaginative and a half-hearted Christian and that’s why so many of us go to the University and major in business lose our sense of verbal and analytical capabilities and graduate as obedient and trained Dobermans and pit bulls Untitled by Rod Sperry WHEN THEY MET ON THE CORNER, he said to her, *1 don't think I love you anymore' She paused, looked down, took a breath and then LOOKED UP and held her fingertips to the heavens. SCREECH! a truck plowed over a statlonwagon full of boy scouts black clouds cracked at hundreds of miles an hour above them an avalanche tumbled through a quiet village houses crumbled the roads opened up and filled with flood water, streaming with the contact of lava from volcanoes that had been dormant for millions of years the blood of millions of people began to boil even the firehouses burned down there was nothing left it was just him and her and the corner they were standing on and he broke the silence and said to her ‘I have changed my mind, I love you more than ever.' Untitled by Vladix I have become a feeling, my nails have grown so l can scratch memories from thought. Sometimes I bleed and I have become a feeling unknown to me, am emotion brought to me by the western winds. But my sense escapes me to where l cannot comprehend what I've become. All that I know is that apathy is no more. But with that l was at rest, and now I have a mind in question, without sleep or sense. Yet my nails still scratch memories which only scar my thought, and what l have become is something like a sound in silence. Pleasing, yet disturbing. Not knowing, no, never knowing. Wbatcba Waitin For ? by Mox Sonnabend Lower yourself onto my throbbing hypothesis, there's no danger of it becoming restrictive, as I have bad my premises rerouted The postulates it arose from are quite a departure from the old ways ; and I promise if it threatens to hurst out of its parameters I will cease plotting its coordinates up youry-axis The variables and exponents that come into play are of such exciting degrees that there may even be abbreviated exclamations that resemble gasps, or if the set becomes really stuffed with integers, groans. The theories are so very new, dear student, you will surely have no choice but to squeal with delight. It's a hypothesis that dares new terrain, swings from chandeliers and when any of its functional elements dry up, provides for automatic relubrication! How about that! Allow yourself to be caresses by the network of subequations of my highest common denomina¬ tor, which are hot enough to melt an igloo. Quick! Connect! The positively devastating philosophy's about to come pouring from the canvas stomach of the macrocosm! Unbutton your anxiety and just slip right out of that preconceived notion, get ready, get strong, be brave and maybe we'll come out of this ridiculous mess with a useful proof. Untitled by Jeff Mikhailovich Happiness is a warm gun to have and to hold, for better or worse, until death do you part, forever hold your piece. The storm clouds are brewing rain will fall soon She's coming- Mother War in all her vanity the new disease with no cure GODRIOT everyone's coming to the party. and like our Santas along side of Serial Killer culture ALL OUT WAR #2, SI.50, S42 318 Hamilton Bl.

STUFF THE BALLOT BOX (UP YOUR ASS) Flipside; This letter is one of shock more than disgust. I just got the Flipside readers poll issue and am questioning your Flipside readers or readers poll should I say. #39 label that has not released a good LP in years”, SST #1. Okay, 111 go with that. Homestead, yeah I really haven't liked anything since Squirrel Bait, Combat Core, yeah never really remember putting anything good out ever by that label. Taang! I disagree. I think Taang! is the best indie label going I’m not totally in defense of Taang! I don’t like every record they’ve put out, but shit I don’t like every Sub Pop or Dischord record either. I think these are really the only three labels that have stuck to their guns as putting out stuff that is good. Most labels haven’t diverged in anyway. Touch & Go used to be my favorite label, but I must honestly say I don’t like the direction they’ve gone, but I think they put out what they really believe is good... but I see stagnation with the same flow of stuff. I say Taang! is the most diverse label there is. I mean a Boston Hardcore label was the original intention. Gangreen, Last Rights... but fuck, Killslug was a turning point. This showed they weren’t a HC label. Then Stranglehold, Manic, Targets, Lemonheads... fuck. Maybe Taang! distribution doesn’t get to Flipside subscribers, I just thought that was weird seeing Taang! in that category. It doesn’t fit. I buy a lot of records and I must admit I think in the past couple of years my 10 fave records at least three are on Taang! (Dear faceless pussy that didn't sign your name; I too disagree with the majority ofthe polls, but that is what was voted. Did you bother to vote? 1 didn't think so. - Krk) SLAG RELIGION Dear Flipside: Here's something I don't understand that I'd like you folks to explain. As an oldtimer, I’ve seen this over and over thru the years, and its always stupid, usually hypocritical, and frequently just plain mean. I'm talking about doin' the slag. Now, of course, Kirk's the worst offender, devoting a whole page last issue (#70) to slagging Bad Religion. But others do their slagging in snide little asides here and there. This is a partial score card. BAD RELIGION-independent label-slagged SOCIAL DISTORTION-major label-slagged JANE'S ADDICTION-m^jor label-not slagged RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS-major label-slagged SONIC YOUTH-major label-not slagged FAITH NO MORE-major label-slagged What's the logic here? What's a sellout? Someone on a major? Then Jane’s Addiction deserves slagging too, as do Kirk's gods Sonic Youth. Or is a sellout someone whose music has become \"more accessible?\" In this case then, Sonic Youth and the Chili Peppers should be it. Bad Religion is on their own DIY label, and their music is consistently great and still as punk as ever. More likely, as what seems to be the case with Kirk, a sellout is a band he didn’t like in the first place that is now popular/successful. What's the matter, Kirk, are you jealous? The only overnight success on this list in Jane's Addiction (although Perry's paid his dues). The others have been at it for ten years to get where they are now. That's hard work and admirable dedication, not a sellout. This is the reality. If a band is really good (creative, distinctive, committed, tight, hardworking etc), the odds are that their audience will grow-if the band stays together long enough. Eventually they’ll become nationally or internation¬ ally successful, limited by the degree to which their music is \"accessible.\" Main¬ stream tastes do change to include a few truly challenging bands, just very slowly (I remember when Bowie was really wild). If a band gets popular, they have to play largervenuessotheirfanscan seethem. Largervenueschargemoremoney. Being popular results in the band actually making enough money to do their music full time! Is that a crime? Does that fact alone mean they're no longer punk? Fuck no! Most of us have shitty jobs and would love tube able to give them up to do music or writing (or whatever) full time! What’s your job, Kirk? Still living with/off your folks, eh? Where’d you get the dough to go to NY for the NMS? How can you afford to spend over $80/month on music? That’s at least $ 1000/year, 2-3 months income for me. And, of course, you go to shows absolutely free, being a major underground music journalist! Most of these successful bands use the money they don’t need to live on to start/ expand their own their own labels and/or help out struggling bands. That’s the main thing that keeps punk going (Dischord, Alternative Tentacles, etc.). And a popular punk band wins new fans for punk-not just poseurs but folks who live in the boons and haven't previously had the opportunity to hear punk. Be honest- that's how many of us got into punk in the first place. Your own policies at Flipside also make such a stance hypocritical, for example your new policy of not reviewing cassettes. While I understand your reasons, if you're really going to support the great but obscure, struggling punk bands, cassettes and demos is where they 11 be found. Bands that can afford vinyl are already either rich or successful, by my standards. Cassettes are the only truly punk medium for getting your music out-anyone can afford them. Vinyl requires a minimum of $750 to just do a 7\"- more than an entire month's living expenses for me and many of the working poor who don't have rich/middle-class parents or a generous fan, etc. And in this area, we pay to play 90% of the time. But I'm not jealous of successful bands. They give me a hopeful example, and I can learn from their methods and growth. If you just plain don't like a band's music, that’s perfectly legitimate. For example, I think the Motor Morons 7\" is the worst fucking shit I ever heard, as does everyone else I played it for. Kirk thinks it's great. We all have different tastes, and a uniform, conformist punk community is not our goal (unless you are militant SE and PC). A holier (punker) than thou attitude is detrimental to a scene-just another example of how many of us can’t overcome the bad examples given to us by mainstream society to really create an alternative that doesn't marginalize those who are different. So let's support the deserving, even if their music's not to our taste, and save the slagging for real sellouts: Rollins is giving fashion advice in the new Yuppie Details!! And I’m sure he doesn't need the $$. What does he do to help the punk community? Ifl'mwrong about him, please correct me (with facts). Finally, unless you actually know the folks concerned, it’s hard to say who’s a sellout (or a poseur), isn't it? Check out the lyrics to \"Do The Slag\" on the DK’s Bedtime For Democracy. Sick of it all, Jillian Oblivion Rochester, NY (Jill, Baby, Let's get a few things straight. 1 don't recall ever mentioning \"sell out\" when writing about Bad Religion, but who cares, your tear soaked letter still bored me even more so than the bands you listed (except Sonic Youth, of course). Who by the way have released twice as many records, toured a dozen times more and have also \"endured\" quite a bit more than your gods, Bad Relation. Sonic Youth never went \"into the unknown\" to play music they \"really wanted to play \", broke up, then reformed years later and played the same old shit. Sonic Youth never stuck to a boring formula just to sell records and most importantly Sonic Youth never claimed to be socially I politically correct in their lyrics. And that is my biggest beef 1 don't care that Bad Relationis popular. Goodforthem, they’can sell thousands ofrecords,goodforthem. They can fool idiots like you into believing in them, good, great, hooray for Bad Relation. But I don't buy it. Get it through your thick skull. 1 don't can what some \"long time scenester\" like you says. You pay 20 bucks for a punk rock gig. Yeah, I live at home and I've got it made. 1 have a full time job making two or thne times as much as you probably do, you untalented loser. Yeah, 1 spend all of my money on records, alcohol andgameboy cartridges. You jealous? I spend mon money on film and batteries than you do on tampons you bloody cunt. I don't think it’s too much to ask to be on a guest list Fuck, 1 'm going to put stupid bands name, or picture or interview in ten thousand copies of a \"major underground zine\" (and no, I'm not a fucking journalist). Besides, you talk about me \"slagging\", how about me giving positive reviews? How about all of the good things I fucking do? Interviews or photos orotherbands that you do like? Oh, those don't count Of course the Dead Kennedy's would do a song like \"Do The Slag\" on\"Bedtime...That was the biggest piece of shit ever. Plus, I'm sure they had tons of bad reviews for all that other crap they released. That was a one record band, and I hope you know which record was the only one worth buying. Which brings me to another dull point. It's not that I hate bands once they become popular or once they get signed to a major, it's just that most popular bands aren't capable of writing more than a dozen hit songs. After that is usually just formula back wash. Live these bands can only keep their audience awake by playing the \"old\" songs. Face it, it's true. Whatever, I’ve wasted enough time on you, and don't ask me for facts about Rollins just cuz you got your panties all wet, but I will sell you an 8x10 picture of him in loose black shorts for 20 bucks. Your pal, Krk PS- Oh, one more mistake on your part. Whenyou speak of the \"no tape reviewing policy\" - you're speaking of the yellow bellies at Maximum Rocknroll. We try to review tapes but most of them suck shit, and by the way you speak of them I can tell you are in a shitty band yourself. You want to review tapes ? Send us a LARGE selfaddressed envelope and a few bucks for postage. We 'll see how much \"punk rock\"your pristine ears can endure, short cakes. If you want to catch up with me in NYC this summer, send a picture and a phone number. Later babe. YOUTH GONE WHAT Dear Flipside, I’m outraged. In regards to a letter written by a \"Chuck What” in Flipside #70 where he talks of a Victor Bazzarro who clams writing most or even some of Youth Gone Mads material, and not getting credit for it. First of all I’m ENA, I been around. Who are you Chuck What? Some dick from Fullerton who I forgot to put on the guest list at the Cuckoos Nest? And who is this Victor Bazzarro, and is he really dead, or was it that he was never with us in the first place because of this acute alcohol problem. (Get it). Anyways I’m ENA and I've been around. I wrote everythingthat Youth Gone MadhasrecordedtodatealongwithTammiEstquivel, and we've been doing this since 1978. In fact some of the songs were written by JohnnyTastemaker. When he was only 9. Illlethimputhis2centswhen I'mdone. We have never heard of either Victor Bazzarro or Chuck What. And if you whoever you are had enough guts to print your address, I’m sure you would get so much hate mail that you actually would drink yourself to death. DEAR CHUCK WHAT, YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. Signed ENA, Youth Gone Mad, NY, NY. PS: We don’t care what you think of us anyway. Johnny / Youth Gone Mad (Ena - And all this time we thought YOU wrote the letter! - Al) TELL US SOMETHING NEW Flipside; Well its over. Danzig has completely sold out. As if an interview with Glen in Spin wasn’t enough, now they’re on the cover, and are seen on MTV 1 s Headbangers Ball sandwiched between Poison and Trixter. For years I’ve always thought of Glen as this god. That vision is now gone. If you watch the Danzig home video you’ll learn that Glen is a very educated and interesting person with some cool philosophies on religion, life, etc. Listen to some of the stuff he says. The things Danzig are doing now seem totally against everything Glen has ever said. With all his talk about religion, I actually received a card from Danzig saying \"Merry Christmas\" on the front. I like Danzigs music (not as much as Misfits or Samhain of course). Hive in a small boring town in western Mass. Danzig was supposed to do a concert about an hour from here. So I wrote Danzig informing them that I was going to the show. A week of so later I got a phone call and the lady (PJ) told me that I was on the list to meet the band and to bring my camera and whatever I wanted signed. Words can’t describe how happy I was. The night of the show my friend Tammy called and told me the show was canceled. I called Katinas (the place they were supposed to play) to verify. It was true. Said the stage was too small to fit in their huge Danzig skull background. The only thing that the stage was to small for was their huge fucking egos! There were 800 tickets sold. 800 people waiting and the pricks wouldn’t play. Thanks Danzig. Sunshine YET ANOTHER GG ALLIN LETTER! Dear Flipside Having been a reader of your mag for about ten years now, I find it amusing to see that the majority of your letters are about the exact same subjects as they were a decade ago. Something is stagnant here. Let’s start something new. The subject of mental illness for example. As a psychology major and ha ving had my own real-life psychotic break, I can say with much authority that GG Allin is finally where he belongs - behind bars. (Yer a little late, he’s out now - ed). Now before GG starts calling me ignorant, let me point out that I received the highest score in my abnormal psych class and did a little unin¬ tended extra credit work in Patton Mental Hos¬ pital at the same time. GG is paranoid, delu¬ sional, a danger to himself and others, with a touch of megalomania on the side. Sure, he has the right to express himself freely, but the right to free speech does not include the right to be taken seriously. Certainly not when it endan¬ gers the safety of others. As a human being, I pray for his soul, and pity his miserable existence. People, he’s not a leader, he’s merely pathetic but equally interesting. He’s like watching a mental \"20 car pile up.\" Yes Al, he gets (got) a reaction, but a brainless speck of pollen gets one also. Why am I focusing so much on this particular self destructive man? Because he embodies so many of the negative traits that exist in all of us. Because I understand GG Allin (his predictable reaction to this will be to deny my understanding) am I not like him? We can choose to either climb out of the toilet of ourselves, or flush it. GG I know for certain that one day you will fall on your knees and find God. (I can hardly wait for the letters from all you God haters.) Just like me, you'll wait until your life is no longer in your hands, and death is but a second or two away. Whatmakesyouaconfidentyoumayask? When a man really wants to die, he dies. He doesn't wait around to see how many people care. Climb out of the same pit I did GG, and enjoy life. Marcus Solomn Alta Loma, CA (Marcus - It's people like you who make me want to be like GG. - Al) OUT ON THE TOWN Dear Kids, This letter is a response to no one in particular, but to a persuasive attitude that serves as a preamble to any discussion of the NY Scene. After reading band interviews and letters in your magazine and others, all I hear from New Yorkers is that \"The Scene Sucks!\" I’ve been living here 8 years now and let me tell you I've seen almost every band. To be sure, some, but so what? There’s still plenty ofbands that kick motherfucking ass. Ill tell you what is lame though, those fucking poser douchbags that can't cough up 5 bucks to go see somebody other than the same 10 or 12 bands that everyone else goes to. Punk fucking rock. I don’t need someone to tell me a band is cool to go check them out. Equally pathetic is the common complaint that the clubs here suck. Perhaps if some of these whining pussies were paying cover instead of trying to snake their way onto the guest list, then maybe promoters could afford to pay bands some fucking money. More often than not, when these loosers get in for free, they don’t buy drinks until later when they go to their favorite dive. No wonder clubs shut down or go disco. Also it seems to me that according to a lot of these people, every club is great when it opens, then almost immediately it sucks until it closes when low and behold it magically transforms into one of the greatest clubs ever to grace the scene. The truth is we've got our problems in the NY scene (don’t we all) but there's a lot of cool shit going on here if you give a fuck to get off your ass and bust out a few bucks. In fact, ifyou wanted to, you could go out every night (to two clubs even) and see good music and get away pretty cheap, provided you didn’t insist on going to see only trendy bands. In closing I’d just like to say that the only motivation I can identify for dissing your own scene(insteadofsupportingit)is to make yourselflook good. How daring you are if you can survive in a bad situation, huh? Wake the fuck up. Jim 0™ ^ f IA- ijui O' < Y'Q- Woll cln turn up » 1 P.O.&nc 3E3UV, fi ! /j °lo 6o%\\\\ \\\\[\\\\ Si till!

Dumb fuck dorks should get out and check out \"new\" bands and paying 5 bucks isn't too bad I'll vouch for the fact that there are a lot of cool clubs in NYC.

But 1 know money's hard to come by - so if l can scam a list you know 1 will. Your bud • Krk) THE CRITICAL EXPERIENCE Dear Flipside Just got a recent issue (#70) and reading it realized how much of a kick 1 get whenever I find a new issue. I live in London (England) and can't get all the stuff you review/see the bands you cover, but whenever I’m in America you can be sure I look out for bands you've mentioned I think I might like. Flipside is a great read. Full of energy and enthusiasm and genuinely positive. Not jaded and full ofbullshit opinions. The people involved obviously care and I can’t think of a more up front and honest publication. Entering some of the debates/commentaiy going on in the letter column, here's my thoughtson punkvsany-other-music. Ilisten to all kinds ofshit. Rangingfrom grunge thru bands like Lord, No Means No, Leather Nun, The The, Clash, Love & Rockets.and a million others. There is a point to such a long listing. What do the above have in common? Lyrically they offer something which is not exactly in tune with the existing order of this world, and musically they either oppose standards set by the music industry or use existing forms in a way that expresses their non¬ conformity and indiretuality. Put another way, they evoke though their music a mood and a feeling which gets beyond muzak. Ok, so what is this sensitivity they evoke? Well, this might be obvious, but here goes - what all these artists evoke, in my opinion, is a more honest view/feeling about this world, based around a diverse but shared rejection of this worlds crushing order and diversion. Music surely primarily is about feeling/ sensuality/and sex (usually). Lyrically it usually offers the acceptance of existing order of things views on sex/love/romance and does not criticize the way this world is structured, except in a kind of shrug of shoulders \"that’s life\" acceptable, incorporated scene. Musically, muzak represses. It’s now a kind of straight-jacket: safe, somethingyour granny can snap a finger to. It reinforces a very pedestrian way of dancing, and looking at the world. In my view, the kind of music I listen to is about something else - a world that is not neat and orderly, it’s a bit dangerous, it’s a fucking struggle to get through to anyone; the existing order does all it can to stop it, distort it or absorb it and sell it back in a less challenging form. So punk vs the rest. Listening just to punk surely limits you and the way you can feel / express yourself. This world just loves\" you to target yourself / limit who you are / can be, cut yourself off from their human beings. Surely we should all be open to any music / poem / book / comic / film / art / experience that is critically honest and gives us a great resource: looking at the world through others eyes of course we all need some sort of focus in our own life and punk is a great resource. Thousands of good bands to go and see, records to hear and the likelihood at any gig you can make friends with like- minds folk. Punk is by definition a critical experience and forme a rich and rewarding form of music, but it’s not the be-all and end-all. Well, anyone who wants to write me about my views - please go ahead. Ill be in San Diego for the big comic book convention in early July- anyone there who wants to meet up, gig, swap tapes and generally hong out - make contact! The New York address is do friends and I get mail forwarded OK. So Flipside - thanks for all the energy and hard work that makes the magazine so special-1 hope that my contribution back stirs up some comments in you letter column. Regards. David Stanlake 76 Corroll ST, Brooklyn, NY, NY 11231 ”WHAT’S HAPPENED TO THE SCENE?’LETTER Dearest flipside and everyone reading this, I know your obviously tired of getting \"What’s happened to the scene?\" letters, but being a part of the underground for close to a decade, I cannot help but to raise my frustrations towards what has become a stagnated, dying scene. To be very truthful, I feel the scene is basically dead! I had noticed the changes in 1986 and I cannot say they have been very positive. I have seen pretty much everything from marxist, fascist, capitalist, and religions assholes influencing (and dividing) the scene to dumb lamefucks who see the scene as some excuse to be some exclusive clickey social club to use and fuck your \"friends\" over. Also, I see a major lack of creativity out there music-wise. The stuff being put out by most of the bands out there is nothing, but a mishmash of boring metal with neo-1970's Led Zeppelin/ Eagles noise. Those who consider this shit as \"punk\" are absolutely misguided and naive. I realize that changes are always inevitable, but when these changes are more self-defeating than benefiting, it fucks things up. Much of the new music that’s been coming out basically sucks sheepshit! It will never compare with what was done 13 years ago. You can take almost any recent band like Mudhoney, Hole, Beat Happening, Thee Hypnotics, and compare them to let's say Fear, Angelic Upstarts, Buzzcocks, and Adolescents, the more recent bands I mentioned would be fucking blown back to the stone age. The only recent bands I can think of that are actually worth listening to are Sheer Terror, Gwar, Operation Ivy, and any SKA band now playing. In fact SKA is pretty much the only real part of the underground that has people with their shit together. Don’t get me wrong! There’s some cool people in what's left of punk/hardcore just like anything else, but there are those fiickheads who think they are punk by dressing up and \"acting\" the part. Anyone that doesn’t fit in to their own personal amusement. It's even more pathetic when they are fucking each other over. I've been fucked over so many times by assholes who I thought were my friends. It isn't even worth going to shows anymore. It seems that shows are attended by those 90% who go to show off the new color of their mohawk or new boots or stick together in their little \"packs\" and dare not mingle. Anyways, wasn’t the whole idea of punk \"Fuck society\" instead of \"fuck your friends!\" Proven fact that punk is really dead. Face it kids! There is no unity. Just another division and nothing more. There are 4 common enemies of the underground. Those things are Marxism, Fascism, Capitalism, and more recently religion. As a whole the left wing have firmly set foot onto the late, great scene. A few years ago, I went to a show in Berkeley and there were some people from the Revolutionary Communist Party passing out flyers, newspapers, and other bullshit. You see these idiots organizing demonstrations and bragging how they are going to oust the government and praising Mao and Lenin, whom were as oppressive as any Saddam Hussein would be. Many of the \"punks\" eat that shit up. Maybe that’s why whenever we drop bombs on a coun¬ try like Iraq, there are more people whining about that than when Soviet tanks rolled through Afghanistan or Lithuania. Why weren’t those demonstrators out protesting those atrocities as well as US atrocities? Because the commu¬ nists are among the main organizers of such demonstrations and have to blow - up one side of the coin without looking at both sides of an issue. Nogovemment is a good one. Which leads to Fascism which made a poor attempt to take over the underground with their \"Sieg Heil\" salutes and talks of \"White Power\". While they tried to push that in, they nearly destroyed the Skinhead and Oi! name and what skins are really about thanks to an already distorted media. Capitalism and that same media machine even exploited punk and it kills me to see chain shops selling Sid Vicious memorabilia (fuckin’let the guy rest in peace!) and leather jackets with punk bands already painted on. Rich kids who don’t know what the fuck is going on watch the TV view of punks and skins and they get mislead like flocks of sheep. It is very likely that's why some of these kids use the underground as a social dick. Then we go on to religion. What the fuck is this Krishna crap? And what of these Christian \"punk\" bands? Give me a fuckin’break! These are tools of brain washing (just like the media!) and never should have even been considered. Now you've got a bunch of Ray Cappo clones dandng around chanting. What's next? Catholic priests doing Black Flag covers? I really hate to think what’s next on the bullshit list, nor I don’t think I want to know anyway. The bottom line is I’VE HAD IT WITH YOU ASSHOLES OUT THERE THAT HAVE FUCKED THE SCENE OUT OF EXISTENCE. YOU SUCK! FUCK YOU VERY MUCH!! Now if you’ll excuse me, I'm going back to my Skatalites tape and my bottle of beer. A YOB in Seattle. (Dear Seattle dork; Sounds like your problem has more to do with your friends, or lack of them, than it has to do with \"punk rock\" or your \"scene\".

Fear, Angelic Upstarts, Buzzcocks and Adolescents - what a load of shit. There are plenty of bands that can match and surpass those bands with intensity and originality. Maybe it's not Hole, Beat Happening, Mudhoney (and definitely not) thee Hypnotics, but 1 guarantee there are dozens of bands in existence today than can kick ass over any stupid TSOLI Vandals reunion shit. Take it from me you lazy fuck, I've seen every band that has come through LA since god knows when. As for all that religious I political diarrhea, who cares? And what will all your crying doin the long run? Nothing. Yerpal, Krk). I AM CAKE Dear Flipside and riff raff, I have finally been driven to write. Some of you pay attention to a specific point I'm making. Time for war. First- \"Cake\" & who the fuck is this idiot and get him (or her) the fuck out of Flipside. The Butthole Surfers \"BLOW AWAY the Grate¬ ful Dead in their instrumental prowess”? Who the fuck are you kidding? Another typical ex¬ ample of some little fucking ”punker” trying to gain acceptance among his \"peers” and \"read¬ ers”. I'd like to think most people would know better. Now, I personally love the Dead and I'm not going to get on a defense kick (It ain’t worth it fuck faces), but whenever Gibby Hayes or any of you other fuckin morons writes a song as good as \"Looks Like Rain\" Ill gladly kill myself. Second-1 caught that infamous Bad Religion show at the Palladium...it was great to finally see T.S.O.L. as I was too young the first time around and I want to thank you guys for making an effort...and doing something..for some of us it was a special moment in life. Thank you!! However.Jt was easy to see why I stopped going to shows. Fuck the door price; who would want to go to a show to be \"entertained\" and spied on by pigs (LAP.D for you ignoramuses) and security and then watch some idiot doing jumping jacks on stage? Fuck you buddy and fuck the rest of you for loving it. (Good luck in college, babe, hope my grammer and syntax pass your (talk about grammer, asshole-CAKE) fuckin test.) Which brings me to the conclusion of my wrath-Any group or individual who uses \"I SPY\" in their logo or personal philosophy should be blown in two and then ass-raped. No For An Answer and all you fake religionists take note. Well, believe it or not, Peace and ta-ta GUESS WHO? (Well you want a reply, huh? First off, you dick, HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEW BUTTHOLE SURFERS ALBUM???? Have you heard that particular song (it being \"PSY')? To me, the song personifies the brilliance of the Butthole Surfers instrumentally. You must be a real tough guy to deal with by your tone in the letter. It amazes me that people like you exist who are ignorant and are afraid to branch out andexperience new shit. Don't give me your \"wanna-be-tough\" image whichyoure showcasing in your letter 'cause I don't particularly need it. Why don't we meet and talk about our little problem? I'm sure that I could change your mind about certain...things. Also, you ignorantly misspelled Gibby Haynes' name, but that's alright 'cause I'm sure that you 'll still graduate from High school (or grade school) before summer. \"Oh, what fools these mortals be\" said Puck in those great Shakespearean plays of yesteryear and you (whoever the fuck you are) are absolute proofof that. Belie ve me, you spineless jellyfish (I'm getting mean, aren't I), I am not a \"little punker trying to gain acceptance\". I am CAKE: Flipside reviewer. Period. I think the Grateful Dead are tired, but not particularly because they've been around for over twenty-five years. It's because the excitement is gone. Sure, they have millions of fans, but so does Vanilla Ice. (Believe me, I'm not comparing the Dead to that inane asinine rap-frat.) Personally, I think that Grand Funk Railroad are more revellent today than the Grateful Dead will ever be because you can hear elements of their music in today's indie world (grunge-grunge-grunge). Instrumentally, the Dead are brilliant, don't get me wrong, but they're predictable, dude. Anyway, thanks for replying to my review and FUCK YOU, YOU COMPLACENT BAS¬ TARD!!! \"Ignorance comes in many forms and sizes\"-unknowngenius quote from 1393 and found in an abandoned shoe in 1974 when I visited La Coruna, Spain whilst 1 vomited trying to change my brother's diapers. Really!!!) LEFT WING RIGHT WING Flipside, Hello there, how ya all doing? Well, after years of crying about how shitty society is and complaining how some drastic changes need to be made, I've come to this conclusion. Changes are being made....for the worse. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm getting fed up. If you think you've escaped the main-stream society by hiding in the back allies, woods, mountains or wherever your secret cubby hole is, it’s only time before they find you and squeeze what they want out of you. And you know what happens to non-participants. You get to help fill up their new jails and prisons. This fiickin greedy ass police government has got to be stopped. NOW! I too have a dream of peace, love and anarchy. Its unrealistic to think we can go straight from where we're at now to anarchy. What I’m suggesting is all you anarchist and basic freedom lovers, to take a look at the Libertarian Party. True, its still a form of government but I think their platform will get us alot closer to our own goals. Then we can work from there. The Libertarians believe in \"Live and let Live\" as long as your not hurting anybody else. Isn't that what we want? Lets pitch in and fight for a freer country before its too late. At least call their 800# and see what they have to say. I think you'll agree with me. Here itis-Libertarian Party 1-800-682-1776 Fuck the Democrats and Republicans, we want our freedoms back. Thanks for listening. Punker \"D\" 901 Talbert Ave., Simi Valley, Ca. 93065 PEACE, LOVE, ANARCHY P.S. Viva La Punk Rock LET THEM EAT ACID CAKE SAID Hello Folks at Flipside! This is a letter intended for print, but if not, oh well... This is my review of THE DOORS movie that I didn't see...I had/have no desire to see it & hearing about it from people that have make me not even want to rent it for $1... maybe in 20 more years... something to look forward to, right? Ha! I think acid is boring, personally I’d rather save my dreams for sleep... I dunno, I'd just prefer to see a movie about speed freaks or something. The only problem would be that no one would go cuz the movie would go by so fast. If you wanna see a cool \"Hollywood\" movie, get MOMMY DEAREST. That's a great movie, I don’t care one way or another about that dork Christina Crawford or her story...her mom was a good actress. Quite frankly, I don’t care about Joan Crawford's personal life either... But MOMMY DEAREST, it's a great revenge theme, and mother/daughter fist fights are much more exciting than seeing some prick like Jim Morrison fuck a bunch of dumb teenage girls-talk about boring! Besides, both Joan Crawford and Jim Morrison are dead, and I bet none of you know that I’d be much more impressed by a person that had been slapped in the face by Joan Crawford than fucked by Jim Morrison... Signing oflf, Wendy the Witch, Palos Verdes, Ca. (Insanity prevails. 1 have, as of yet, not seen the much heralded THE DOORS film, but 1 believe that it will have more of an impact than a film about peoples'sexual fetishes with clothes-hangers. Anyway, Wendy, you sound pretty insane. 1, though, have enjoyed my experiences with LSD (at Disneyland; aTikki Party) and think that you should VENTURE FORTH and experience the experience 'cause you never know what lies around the comer, ya know? - CAKE) THE FISH BOWL PROBLEM Dear Krafty Cheeze and Flipside, Your letter brings up a subject which I’ve wanted to whine about for awhile. But first I do agree with one point in your letter. I would love to read more about a variety of L.A. undercround/ alternative/ etc bands in Flipside. I’ve become real tired of the \"good ole Flipside circle of bands\". But I wonder, who are you? Why did you use a fake name? Are you in one of the bands you mentioned? Face it, if you're in an L.A. band and you want to get your shows reviewed, interviewed etc, then you gotta play the L.A. scenester game and intentionally make friends with the LA zine people (I'm refering to all editors/writers of Flipside and Ben Is Dead) and KXLUd.j.s which brings me to another subject. The bullshit scenester KXLU circle. Several of those bands you mentioned are comprised of past and present KXLU d.j.s. It's no secret that if you play friendly with many ot the d.j.s on that college radio station then they will play your band. But, back to those bands. Distorted Pony (they’re ok, one of the better local bands but they're hardly original. A second rate Big Black is more like it.) are all former KXLU d.j.s and gee wniz do they get plugged on the station. Slug (a big joke and one of the worst bands I've ever seen. C'mon let's get pretentious and make noise. Wow.) are all current d.j.s at the station (with maybe the exception of one) and surprise surprise. KXLU is always playing them with no mention of them being KXLUs very own. Two of the guys TJ» DtQQEDt lull FARM, on US HwyUfceKtUatyroe*. J \\ . ' \"\"i<on. grows Dutch trim.

If you’re a new band and want to get played, like I said, you’ve got to kiss up to someone. Same with the zines I mentioned. You have to be \"in\" or forget it. And, can’t forget how it’s cool to slag a band, either in print or on the air, if you don’t know them. Flipside and Ben Is Dead you are both guilty of this. I’m sick of this L.A. attitude and the hanging out at clubs and talking to people just so the band is noticed. It’s bullshit. The L.A. industrial/noise scene isn’t new or original. It’s already become stale and boring. Please Flipside, tey .to seek out the bands that are in no category and/or keep to themselves and have individual style. KXLU d.j.s please stop playing your games and start seeking out and playing a variety of unknown L.A. bands. And Krafty Cheeze use your real name. What are you afraid of? For some reason 111 assume you're in one of those bands you men¬ tioned. Robert Alatorre (Yes my real name. Yes, I’m j in an L.A. band). (Bob, (Yes, you're probably in some stupid LA band); Let's get a few things straight. I don't cover \"Flipside bands\". 1 don't give a fuck about a band just cuz someone else does. I cover bands that I, most importantly than anything else, like. 1 cover bands that have enthusiasm. Bands that release their own records. Bands that tour. Bands t / ■t that are into it; not just ot get a \"review or f I \\ interview\", but to play their music, because that's all that matters to them. Let's face it, 90% of ALL LA bands couldn't cross the 101 Freeway unless a record label or fanzine helped them. Most LA bands are lazy, can't tour, can't release their own singles and just plain suck. 1 don't cover bands that \"kiss up\". No one ever does any of that shit to me, nor do they do it to any of the people that I know. I don 'tknow who I what you 're crying about. 1 can't speak for Ben Is Dead. 1 know a few of them, but how they handle their coverage is their trip. And 1 don't have a radio and know nothing about KXL U, except they interview a lot of cool bands and plug lots of otherwise unheard of gigs (so I'm told by these bands). Slug I know nothing of either. Distorted Pony 1 saw once and wasnt' impressed. Butl'm only one of the \"writers\" here at Flipside. Aljknow is into LA He always gives preference to LA bands, not only in Flipside but on the cover as well. Something I wouldn't do, for reasons I've already mentioned Gus, who does seem to write about the same 12 bands over and over is an LA club local. Healways writes about LA, matter of fact, that's all he writes about! Cake, our newest contributor writes a lot about LA too. Now that I think about it... so does Martin McMartin, Thrashead and even Pooky! So it sounds like you band is the only LA band that hasn't gotten coverage. Maybe there's a fucking reason for that? But being the fair, all around swell dude that 1 am... send me a tape, record, whatever, of your hand and ifl like it I'll go see ya and do what I do, no matter how shitty I do it. Don't forget the guest list thing because much to the contrary of what everyone thinks, 1 don't have all access to LA. And rich, I'm not. - El Krky. Al here, I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth - Now that Krk gave you a formal invitation to send us your stuff, maybe you 'll do some promotion. Geez, you could have even mentioned YOUR bands name at the end of the letter! If you don't want a plug,fer christsakes, what do you want? Now in defense of \"friends\" all 1 have to say is that there is a big difference between people who are friends (as in the LA experimental people) andass kissers. When people try to kiss ass or blatently ask for us to do an interview with them (not to mention put them on the cover!), that is such a turn off that it ends up being the last thing that we'll ever do. But as Krk said, if you're good, you're in there. We interview 12 to 15 DIFFER¬ ENT hands per issue and never does the same band get the cover twice! How do you see that as a \"circle of bands\"? A lot of the LA scene knows each other because they do what they love to do- go to the clubs! You see the same people enough and you become friends. You play with the same bands enough, you become friends. It has nothing to do with ass kissing. If you are out there doing it, you are it. And we will see you. But, if you sit at home waiting for the phone to ring, you can just sit there and the world will pass you by. You'll never get noticed, hell, you don't even exist. - Al) SUB POP RULES Hey Flipside, I’m getting a big kick from all of these anti-Sub Pop letters of late. Granted, the label is the \"flavor of the month\", but that probably has something to do with the fact that they put out an awful lot of 1 st rate vinyl, by good, no bullshit bands. Why else would bands like Fugazi, L7, Lubricated Goat, Laughing Hyenas (June ’91), Sonic Youth, Babes In Toyland, Dwarves, the Derelicts and the worlds best band, 19' r t t (c^€ C ur fi&'j & ; ^ thee Headcoats put shit out on the label? You can't deny the quality of the majority of Sub Pops shit... Bill Valentine, Glendora Ca. NO, IT DOESN'T Dear Flipside; First of all this letter is not going to be another ridiculous Wax Trax vs. Sub Pop diatribe. But I feel competed to raise a question many in the past have raised. Why do you show so much bias and attention to noise/ grunge/ dirge bands and what exactly does this genre of music have to do with punk rock? I think the Wax Trax vs Sub Pop \"issue\" is kinda funny because both styles of music have their basic origins in the various \"noise\" scenes of the mid to late 70’s New York. For instance the early \"industrial\" (ie Throbbing Gristle) and the \"no wave\" scenes. The only real difference between a Revco and a Babes In Toyland is one relies on synth/samples and the other relies on guitar for its brand of oppressive noise. Noise bands have long been a pet-peeve of mine. This is because where as thev often mas¬ querade as being \"punk\" the are really the antith¬ esis of punk rock (And there’s never been a \"po¬ seur\" punk rock band? - Al). Punk rock from the Ramones to the present has always been a liber¬ ating maximum rock thing. Noise has tradition¬ ally been a pretentious rock meltdown kind of thing. A band like Hole might borrow some guitar maneuvers from 70’s arena rock but whereas those early rock types played songs that, no mat¬ ter how lame, meant something to somebody, * dCa f-\" TUe i reader- ! / - ■A'Azi': . £JL. . Hole just incorporates it into the pit of lifeless sound that it creates. Punk rock has also traditionally been an outlet for non-stereotypical rock type people to play some kick ass music and have a say at the same time. Those Sub Poppers L7 with their long locks, rock star poses and Janis Joplin-like vocals have no more resemblence to a Poly Styrene or a Julie Sin 34 than Lita Ford or Janet Jackson. In the evolution of any movement - whether it be music, art or whatever there are two ways to evolve; progressive and back to basics. Both are equally valid and worthy and both have their time. For the past several years punk rock has gone the progressive route, incorporating metal influences left and right. At first the results were exciting (I totally disagree - Al)- the crossover/ speedcore bands - and helped revitalize the scene at a time when things were looking grim. But over time this \"experiment\" in metal punk fusion backfired and inadvertantly opened the door for countless \"alternative\" hard-rock act s to pass themselves of as a punk type thing. I mean, come on, what exactly is so punk about Mudhoney? If that’s punk, who in the hand rock realm isn’t? Certainly a Slayer or an Anthrax has just as much resemblence to punk rock as they do. Lastly, I’d like to say that even if the Sub Pop and noise rock types did play punk rock that still wouldn’t change the fact that they’re a counterforce against the greatest invention of punk rock - the \"punk rocker\". I didn't get into this scene to be a fuckin' neo-hippy, head banger or rocker hairmonger. I was attracted to the same fucking kick-ass music and the greatest and most liberating \"alternative\" identity we ever encountered - the punk. I use that term in the most enlightened sense (I’m no fashion freak). PS: Al, if the early L.A. punk scene had been dominated by lands like Clawhammer and the Melvins would you have gotten into it? (Only if they cut their hair. - Al) Thanks for your time - Quinn (To Queenn, Oh God, another piss poor excuse for commentary, but you did bother to write and some bored people actually read the letters section, willfully. So... I like grunge, I love\"industrial\" and I will always give punk rock the first shot. I write about what I write about. There is nothing behind it except honest enthusiasm. Look at the alst two issues: # 70 Babes In Toyland, Bewitched, Laughing Hyenas, Tar (all weird \"noise lgrunge\");Cringer, Monsula, Fixtures (all punk in one way or another); Bosstones, Riot Act, Shadow Project, Ultra Violet Eye (other weird shit); Vaginal Creme Davis (ultra trippy fucker!). #71: Bom Against, Accused, Aggression, Glycine Max (all as fucking punk as you're going to get); Fastbacks, Hunger farm, Weather Bell, X (off beat punk); Helmet, Killing Joke, Skinny Puppy (\"noise \"or whatever you call it this month); Loompanics Ltd (more weird shit). Now looking directly at these two line ups, how could you ask for more? If you want solid Ramones punk rock, go start your own fucking fanzine you cry baby little shit. 1 really like where Flipside is at and all the stupid mail we get isn't going to change what 1 cover (1 doubt it will bother Al much either). 1 like diversity and that's what 1 cover. Punk? Can you tell me what punk is? And what's so great about it that makes you cling to it like flies on shit? Kapt. Krk). The Dwarves are punk rocks biggest bluff. Scrawny, unfed, over amped, reckless, perverted and in your face. Alone each Dwarve is just that, another harmless, ugly face in the crowd. Together, with bloodied instruments in their hands, they become quite the opposite of what their name implies. Playingfasterand louder than one another. They appear to be fueled by substances I wouldn't take on a dare. The scary truth is... some times they play sober and perfectly conscious. Where all that rotten drive comes from, only the devil could answer. Oh, and you don't even have to like the Dwarves. They already accomplished exactly what they set out to do • stand the whole punk rock circuit on it's mohawk. Weather you want to admit it or not, you've already given them more attention and thought than you would have a band you do like. That alone is reason for me to like 'em. But hey. He Who Can Not Be Named, slashes, (literally) out some of the raunchiest chops since I don't know when, often playing songs 3 times fasterthan intended. I've seen these guysdo 14 minute sets (Gaslight) and an extensive 22 minute beating (Country Club). All of which were attention demanding and all alarm¬ ing with raw brilliance. If you're a girl, don’t stand too close to the stage, because if Blagg don't get ahold of you, a bouncer might (Bogarts!). The Dwarves don’t give a fuck about anyone but themselves, and 111 pay to see that. and photos by** adv . [Mis* as, as *f\"V» P CQ is-, is, v , * Gr sin as. an^ Isaacus ; Hcb. yn AS IS by Dan Druff >|J)| Aq so;oqd nv Hank-guitar Roj-guitar Bill-drums Steve - bass Alfie - vocals Druff: Do you ever consider leaving Orange County? Bill: Yes! Roj: Definitely. Druff: What's wrong with being a band in O.C.? Steve: It's an undedicated following. Alfie: There doesn't seem to be much of a crowd inter¬ ested in live music anymore. I dunno if it's because they're spoiled or because they're content with CD's and MTV. Roj: People would rather go see a DJ turn fuckin' discs than see a band. Bill: They want to see a ’neat’ looking band that jumps around a lot on stage. The music doesn't matter that much anymore. Druff: Why don't you jump around then? Roj: We're too busy creating art! Alfie: I jump around! Bill: Without trying to sound cocky, the music is kinda complicated to jump around to. Druff: Ok, the music... when I first heard you guys in early '88, you were very O.C. punk rock. About a month later you went in this new direction. Bill: That's because of personnel changes. Roj: Maybe it was because we didn't know how to play anything else. Druff: Was Mozart really a big factor? (Long pause). That's what I thought, am I wrong? Bill: Hank's gotta answer that one. Hank: Huh? Druff: I remember you saying Mozart, uh... Hank: Yeah, I used to fall asleep everynight listening to Mozart. And wake up with it. Druff: How'd you get into that? I've never met anyone our age who listens to Mozart. Hank: I was such a hyperactive kid I had to listen to classical music to calm me down. Druff: And that really worked? Hank: Yeah, it helped. Bill: Look at him! (Laughter! Hank is practically asleep). Druff: What do the rest of you think of Mozart? Alfie: I love him. He's a genius. Bill: I appreciate him, but I don't really listen to him. Alfie: All I can say is I listen to him at least a couple of times a week. Hank: He was like a punk in that century. He did what he wanted, whether it was accepted or not. We're influ¬ enced by that. Alfie: Taking things to extremes... using some types of methods and styles that are unorthodox. He didn't mind doing that... and no one in this band does either. Steve: Yeah... people have told us our music is too ’busy’. Hank: Too many notes. Druff: Oh yeah. Bill: They just need to give it a chance and listen to it a few times. Alfie: A band like Rush probably could be criticized the same way we are... well, we're not criticized that much... but look at their following. Hank: We're also influenced by Dixie Dregs. They're a real ’busy’ band, just instrumental. Druff: Do you see yourselves reaching that type of status? Bill: We have real complications fitting-in the music scene... any part of the music scene. Rush fit in a certain way, but we can't even fit in that way. We're not punk, we're not straight ahead rock. We're just outcast beyond anything. We don't try, that's what's fucked. Hank: We're not real hard like a speed metal band. Yet we're not mellow like a ’Cure’ band. We're right inbetween. We're so far... uh.. far... Steve: Farvegnugen! (Laughter). Bill: (Laughing) Shut up! Hank: We're so inbetween, that... Bill: Let's just say we're versatile. We have at least one song that will appeal to somebody no matter what they're into. Hank: We're on our own road right now. Druff: What would you call it? Alfie: ’Honest’. I swear, not even a joke. We're slaves to our own musical desires, more than our audience's. We're taking an uncommon route in the fact that we're not trying to jump on a bandwagon. Druff: Are there any other bands you'd like to be billed with? Who's audience do you think you could swipe? Hank: We could play with anyone. Bill: The only ones I've thought o fare big bands. Real big, like Living Colour, or Faith No More, or Rush. There's no bands that haven't made it that we can think of that we'd want to play with. Alfie: I wouldn't mind playing with Big Drill Car. Druff: That's exactly what I was thinking. Hank: Or All. Roj: We can play with anyone and get away with it. Alfie: We've played with... Hank: Glam... Steve: (Weird voice) ’Riiiings Of Satuuuuuuuurn’, aaaaa! Bill: ’Nitro’. Alfie: And at the opposite end with some of these hardcore bands, at the Dungeon for example. Bill: We played with ’Roxy Music’ at Goodie's last time. Or ’Spandau Ballet’ or something. Alfie: We didn't really NOT fit in, but, I dunno. Druff: If anyone recognizes Alfie and Hank from Almost 21 ... Hank: Hasn't happened yet. Alfie: Yeah it has. Once. Hank: Once. Druff: I was thinking some people might think this band is a distant relative of Almost 21... Bill: Or an Alfie Agnew project. Alfie: I was the last one to join the band, so... it isn't an ’Alfie Agnew project* at all. We've seen flyers that say ’Alfie Agnews As Is*. The majority of the material was already written when I joined. Druff: I heard a clerk in a record store say ’That's Rikk Agnew's little brothers new band.’ That must really piss all of you off. Alfie: I guess there's no way to escape the fact that I belong to a certain brotherhood who belonged to cer¬ tain bands. Druff: You must get sick of ’There's Rikk and Frank's little brother!’ Alfie: I don't mind. I'm proud to be their brother. I just wish that when people judge As Is, they don't judge it on account of me, and especially on the fact that I was in Adolescents or Dl. It's such a different thing. It's not comparable. I'm not saying what I did was better or worse or whatever, it's just not comparable. Hank: We've all grown up with the OC sound. We're just doing it OUR own way. Different. Alfie: Now people can look at it with a fresh pair of glasses. Druff: Ok, since you'd like to leave O.C. but can't, what are you going to do to break through here? Bill: That's why we called YOU, Dan! (Laughter) Alfie: We figure you can interview us every month... get us on the cover! We're just going to keep trying to hack away, that's all we can do. The scene's at an all time low. The last breakthrough in music was punk rock back in 1976 or whatever. It's been 15 years, you'd think it would be ripe for a new type of breakthrough or something! Bill: C'mon, we've got the new 60's going on! Druff: Yeah, you're talking like the whole ’New Roman¬ tic’ thing never happened! Everyone: Oh God, oh shit, oh fuck. Etc... Alfie: When something comes out, I'd like to be riding the top of the wave. Druff: Do you really think AS IS is that revolutionary? Alfie: Well, revolutionary is a little, urn... Druff: Pretentious. Alfie: Flamboyant. Druff: Are you ready to do an album? Everyone: Yeah! Druff: How do you envision it? Steve: A debut album. (What a smartass). Druff: No shit Sherlock. Of course, you could do your second album first. Steve: There you go! Then we wouldn't have to worry about the ’Boston’ syndrome. (I'm sure you're all aware of the band ’Boston*). Bill: We're not going to be one of those bands where people say * I like their old stuff, but their new stuff sucks.’ Druff: What will the cover look like? Steve: It wouldn't have us on it. Bill: Just weird art on the front. Hank: I'd like to find a new artist off the street. Maybe there's some genius out there. Someone honest. Druff: So when's the record coming out? Bill: Whenever we play a party, people come up and say ’I've never heard a band this good play a party! Why don't you guys have a record out?’ We don't know what to say. We don't know why we're not on vinyl. Alfie: The right people don't know about us. Everyone loves us except the makers and the shakers in the business. Bill: We need a manager. Roj: It goes back to the scene. People come up at shows and say ’You're the best band I've seen in a long time!* But where are they at the next show? Steve: They've only seen two bands! (Laughter) Alfie: It's really frustrating. People just don't seem to appreciate it anymore. I remember back in the good 'ol days people would die just to find a place for a band to play. You didn't even have to flyer, and you could pack the place. People would love it and be so appreciative. Druff: But look how many bands there are now. Bill: Everybody and their mom is a musician. Alfie: Maybe they have a right to be spoiled 'cuz they're flooded with so much shit. But there's not a lot of places to play. When you cut out ’pay-to-play’ you cut out most of your top billings. Druff: You won't do pay-to-play? Alfie: We can't! Steve: We did. Bill: We've done it a few times and we've lost our ass. Hank: We refuse to pay to play now. We've lost some shows, but oh well. Bill: It sucks cuz a lot of the A&R people only go to the pay-to-play clubs. Hank: If you think I'm a tree, cut me down but leave the leaves. Everyone: (Laughter) WHAT?! Alfie: Where'd that come from? Druff: Steve, you played guitar for years before playing bass in AS IS, right? Steve: Yeah, 12 years. I still play guitar. It was a change, I had to undergo to be in a band. I came here 6 or 7 years ago... Druff: From where? Steve: From Ohio, I left my band in Ohio. Druff: What were they like? Steve: We were pretty much punk rock. Bill: C'mon, give 'em the name. Steve: Oh, ’Savage Tractors’, (laughter) I was gonna see about singing for AS IS but when they found out I had a bass, they decided ’fuck the singing.* As far as playing bass, I enjoy it. Druff: Do you ever miss playing guitar Alfie? Alfie: Yeah, major. I feel naked without it. Druff: How come you don't play? Alfie: Cuz most of the places we play there's no room for a forth neck. No, actually it's just not required of me. If it was, I would play. The only way I could add to it right now would be with keyboards. Druff: What's your story Bill? Bill: I moved to Illinois when I was 14.1 was in a couple of punk bands. One ofthemwasa... kinda like a hardcore/ skinhead/Grateful Dead/ thrash band. (Laughter). Three of the guys had skin heads, me and the other guy cut our hair real damn short just to go along with them, but we knew we weren't skinheads. The three skins would go to Grateful Dead shows and fry their brains out! We played as fast and as loud and as obnoxious as we could for 8 months and then I quit. Moved out here, and hooked up with these guys in '87. Later I had to quit this band. I think we've all quit at one time or another. I quit for awhile, Hank quit, Roj quit... Roj: My mom thought I worshipped the devil. Druff: Seriously? Roj: Well, when I started playing guitar... Druff: Yeah, what makes you think you can play Roj! (Laughter) Roj: It's all the expensive equipment that I bought. Bill: Didn't you once work for Roger, Dan? Druff: No... Roj: I believe Dan cleaned the bathrooms... (Laughter) Druff: How imp"
