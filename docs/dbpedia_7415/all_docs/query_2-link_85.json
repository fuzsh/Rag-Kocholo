        "text": "Happy 75th birthday to the inimitable Loudon Wainwright III! When I was a child, you were my father's favorite singer/songwriter featured on local radio, with your heady hit, \"Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road,\" & as an adult, I rediscovered your unique musical offerings, developing a whole new appreciation for songs that had yrs prior flown right over my naive little head, like \"Strange Weirdos,\" \"Red Guitar,\" & \"Unrequited to the Nth Degree,\" as sincerely (chortle, guffaw) performed by you on SNL's 1st season when I was 12 yrs old. In late 2018, I won tix to Rufus @ the Masonic in S.F. Dateless but content, I gave 1 ticket to a stranger, utilizing the other myself. This amazing gig turned me on to yet another aspect of your family's genius: talented musical offspring doing their own creative thing! So please, enjoy your blessed day secure in the knowledge that strange weirdos around the globe adore you & yours, without ever having met you in person. In other words, you done good, my man! Many happy returns, sharonthedyslexicmess in NorCal.\n\nSharon R Wolfe\n\nWayne Osmond 70? David Soul 78? Paul Michael (Manfred) Glaser is also 78, but not tomorrow. I can recall purchasing Osmond Brothers 45's at McCrory's & G.C. Murphy's 5 & Dime, & had some of their L.P.'s on 8-track when I was in grade-school. I also had a giant poster of Donny Osmond & his big, toothy grin on the wall between my bunk-beds back then, too. LoL I was a die-hard \"Starsky & Hutch\" fan from the age of 12, would never miss an episode if I could help it. I also had a poster of them on my wall & crushed heavily on Soul's \"Hutch\" as an adolescent/pre-teen. Anybody remember his singer/songwriter/guitarist musical endeavors? Dude wasn't half bad. At least we sang along. They even graced the cover of our 6th grade \"Bananas\" kids' magazine, which I still have stashed on a shelf somewhere. Approx 2 yrs ago, I rediscovered them via YouTube, falling in love all over again w/them & the series' San Pedro/downtown L.A. settings/backdrops. I still like Soul, but decades later find my \"Hutch\" crush has morphed into a \"Starsky\" one. Changing times, changing tastes, I suppose. \"Starsky & Hutch\" was not the sole reason I dreamt of moving to L.A. beginniing in the 7th grade, but the series definitely planted a seed that would ultimately bear fruit by my 21st year. I no longer live in L.A., but recall those wild years almost as if they happened yesterday. Made many a youthful mistake, yet still glad I took the plunge, otherwise I would not have my beloved, East L.A.-born boy. So Happy 78th Birthday, Mr. Soul, you hot-toddie, you. And a Blessed 70th to you too, Mr. Osmond, who, along with your brothers, frequently serenaded this little girl to sleep via those chunky-clunky 8-track tapes stored in a carrying case under my bed. Many happy returns to you both! Love, Sharon.\n\nSharon R Wolfe\n\nAw no, not again! Just when u think things couldn't possibly get worse - when u find yrself actually praying for the Reaper to take even one afternoon off, to just go home early today & forget about us for a little while, another giant lays his greatness down one last time...only to find he's not really that sleepy, & so heads out to the local pub w/his mate, Grim, for a pint or two before retiring, then never returns. This is my 1st hearing of Mr. Watts' passing, so I know nothing re his cause of death, but my personal sentiment is that he wouldn't have made it to the age he did w/o his music. Some ppl have so much rhythm in their bones, they have no choice but to let it out for all the world to experience. They live to play & oft die that way, essentially pursuing both one's calling & one's bliss; which, if done successfully, can make one a very famous-yet-content person. I mean, if they weren't enjoying at least some part of their lifetimes as musicians, they could've retired any time over the past several decades & sat on their laurels for the duration, living off royalties, guest talk spots, & residuals. It wouldn't have made them any less popular or prolific, their catalog of musical offerings to the world is quite substantial & guaranteed memorable. Charlie Watts, as a man & a member of his notorious band, will be forever loved & admired by his fam & his fans. Currently, my household is mourning more loss simultaneously - of close family members, near & dear friends, multiple former bandmates, plus lifelong musical idols - than we've ever had to deal with at any one point in time. We seem, as of late, to be in a perpetual state of mourning which gets overwhelming real fast, I'll tell u. But that's not good ol' Charlie's problem, he's beyond all bothers of the living now. My sincerest condolences to his family, bandmates, friends, & fans planet-wide. May he rest in peace 'cause he's earned it, & rock in peace 'cause he can. Straight up, Charlie was The Man. And what a legacy this one man left behind! Blessed Be He.\n\nSharon R Wolfe\n\nI used to sing, \"Bye-Bye Love,\" & \"Wake Up, Little Susie\" as a toddler to my parents, little friends, toys, anything that would sit still long enough to listen. How do I know? Mom thought it so cute she never let me live it down! Yes indeed, a mother's love is even strong enough to distort soundwaves, for in all truthfulness, I prob sounded more like Mushmouth from Fat Albert that either of the Everly Bros back then, seeing as I was still too young to pronounce my words properly (baby teeth). I know death as the Big Inevitable, but acceptance of this is another thing entirely. The Brothers are no more, & never again will we hear their sweet voices weave shiver-inducing harmonies that once upon a time, could quite literally make us weak in the knees, prompting even the most tone-deaf among us to cheer them on while joining in song. We still have their recordings, those that haven't already been lost, but as years pass, fewer will remain in circulation. The world has lost yet another incredible artist with an instantly recognizeable, exceptional voice. But it will be a very long time before the outstanding musical legacy, regardless of personal issues, of Phil & Don, the Everly Brothers is forgotten. My beliefs are my own, I won't bore you with those, but I'd like to think in some manner, the Boys are true brothers again, playing, working, fishing, swimming, arms over shoulders in familial camaraderie, their brotherly love no longer tainted by industry pressures, impossible deadlines, & outside forces beyond their control. Yes they made the big-time, and deservedly so, but in many ways at the expense of their relationship. If there ever is a family reunion in whatever their vision of heaven might be, may all be forgiven. May Phil's fam join w/Don's, ancestors rocking the children, while all who had a hand in creating these two amazing men gather round while they entertain their long-lost relatives w/a few simple tunes of love, salvation, & heartfelt reconciliation. And when they're ready, not when some record exec tells them they can, they'll set their guitars down for a rest, & head on dn twd the shade trees together, to watch the water roll by and partake of the scrumptious picnic awaiting them at the Everly Family Homecoming Celebration. Rest in Peace 'cause u've earned it, & Rock in Peace when the Spirit moves u. Blessed Be, Isaac Donald Everly.\n\nSharon R Wolfe"
