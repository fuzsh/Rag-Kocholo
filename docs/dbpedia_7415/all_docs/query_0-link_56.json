        "text": "Graphic above by Julianne Woodson\n\nWhat are the best songs played on Top 40 radio during the 70s that were not released as singles by record companies?\n\nObviously, there are no definitive answers to my question. If I asked the above inquiry to 100 folks, I would surely receive one hundred different responses.\n\nWith this latest music blog message, I will be revealing my top selections based on these factors: Growing up in Roanoke, Virginia, listening to WROV 1240 AM and then being employed by the legendary top 40 station, starting in 1974.\n\nMy regular radio listening started in the spring of 1967 after my parents gave me a transistor radio. I quickly discovered WROV and was hooked on their Top 40 format.\n\nThen in the summer of 1967, I commandeered a desk-top tube radio from our kitchen and permanently kept this device in my bedroom. On most nights that summer, I would tune in 50,000-watt, clear channel AM radio stations, such as WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nWhen I started listening to the radio 55 years ago, I quickly realized that Top 40 stations aired only songs that were released as 45-rpm singles by record companies. The biggest album from the 1967 “summer of love” was “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” by the Beatles. Since Capitol Records didn’t release any singles on the Fab Four album, there were no songs from the LP regularly played on Top 40 outlets.\n\nIt wasn’t until late 1968/early 1969, that I noticed Top 40 radio playing album tracks. The Beatles “White Album” came out during November 1968 but Capitol Records did not release any singles from the LP in America. However, many top 40 formatted stations played select cuts from the self-titled Beatles album.\n\nOn WROV Roanoke, they played three tracks from the Beatles “White Album.” First, the station aired “Back in the U.S.S.R” and then followed up with “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” and “Rocky Raccoon.”\n\nAbove is an audio clip when I was a guest DJ for a My Fab Four segment on SiriusXM’s the Beatles Channel. Featured on this audio clip: “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” & “Back in the USSR” from the “White Album.” Two of my four favorite Beatles songs of all-time.\n\nForward to the 70s. Most Top 40 stations were still on the AM band at the beginning of the decade. The emergence of FM radio in the late 60s and early 70s created challenges for existing AM radio stations.\n\nSince music sounded 100% better on FM, ratings for AM Top 40 stations starting declining. To compensate for the competitive disadvantage AM Top 40 radio had against new FM signals, many long-standing AM outlets decided to tweak their traditional playlists.\n\nMost Top 40 AM stations in the early 70s started playing the longer album version of songs rather than the shorter edited 45-rpm single record. Many of these AM outlets also embraced the playing of “non-single” album tracks on their hot rotation playlists.\n\nSometimes an AM Top 40 station playing an album track would result in a record company releasing a song as a 45-rpm single. This happened during my first job in radio at WROV in 1974.\n\nDuring early September 1974, WROV music director Chuck Holloway started playing the song “Black Water”, which was a track from the Doobie Brothers “What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits” album. After just a few spins on Holloway’s nighttime DJ air-shift, “Black Water” became an immediate hit in Roanoke.\n\nSoon after, Phil Beckman at WQRK Norfolk and Buzz Bennett with KDWB Minneapolis added “Black Water” to their playlists. Finally, Warner Bros Records released the song as a single and the Doobie Brothers achieved their first number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 during March 1975. WROV received a gold record for being the first radio station to play and break “Black Water” as a hit song in America.\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the ten best classic Top 40 hits of the 70s. These were songs that received heavy airplay on WROV 1240 AM Roanoke, played as an album track and not released by a record company as a 45 RPM single.\n\nMy countdown of songs in this category is based solely on my experience of living in Roanoke, Virginia and listening to Top 40 WROV. The ten selections below are from my point of reference and are not meant to be a definitive listing of top album tracks aired on Top 40 radio in America during the 70s.\n\nBefore starting the countdown, here are some clarification points on non-single album tracks played on Top 40 radio:\n\nInformation on album tracks not released as 45 RPM singles pertains only to the United States.\n\nTime frame for non-single songs is up to 24 months after an album was initially released.\n\nSince only singles were eligible to appear on Billboard Hot 100, album tracks didn’t qualify to chart in the 70s.\n\nSome songs that were originally album tracks only may have subsequently been released as a single, years or even decades after the first release of a song.\n\nLater versions of singles could be in a variety of formats: 45 RPM, 12 Inch disc, Cassette, CD or Digital Download.\n\nWith the 2001 advent of iTunes, all songs on countdown can now be purchased as a digital single: via multiple Internet platforms.\n\nWhile the album tracks from the countdown are associated with airplay on WROV, all of the selections are still well-known songs in the 21st Century. Most can be heard daily on various radio outlets: classic rock, classic hits, oldies and multiple SiriusXM channels in 2022.\n\nA song just outside of my top 10 countdown is an album track that WROV played during 1976: “Turn the Page” from the Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band LP, “Live Bullet.” Two singles were released from the album: “Nutbush City Limits” and a medley of “Travelin’ Man/Beautiful Loser”\n\nWROV’s Music Director and DJ Bill Jordan provides information below on why he decided adding “Turn the Page” to his station’s playlist in 1976: “I was music director during a pretty interesting time at WROV. We had morphed into sort of a Top 40/Album Oriented format, and readily played album cuts that “fit” the sound we wanted.”\n\nJordan continues, “A friend switched me on to Bob Seger’s “Turn the Page” from his “Live Bullet” album. We started playing it in very light rotation and it quickly exploded. Record stores couldn’t keep the album in stock.\n\nIn fact, “Turn the Page” became so popular that Capitol Records considered delaying the release of the “Night Moves” album. In 1977, Seger performed at the Salem Civic Center in his last show as an opening act for Black Sabbath.\n\n“Turn The Page” brought the house down. Great times!”\n\nIt is now time for the countdown. The top ten radio hits of the 70s not released as 45 RPM singles:\n\n10. Southern Man—Neil Young\n\nFrom the “After the Gold Rush” album: Released September 19, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Terry Young 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” and “When You Dance, I Can Really Love.”\n\n“Southern Man” is found on two albums: Neil Young’s 1970, “After the Gold Rush” LP and a live version on a live 1971 Crosby Stills Nash & Young album, “4 Way Street.” WROV DJ Terry “Motormouth” Young played this track on his 7 to midnight shift during the winter and spring of 1973. The fast-talking DJ went on bigger radio stations like WLEE Richmond and WCAU Philadelphia. Terry Young was also on SiriusXM’s 60s on 6 channel during the first part of this century.\n\n9. Isn’t She Lovely—Stevie Wonder\n\nFrom the “Songs in the Keys of Life” album: Released September 28, 1976\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Rob O’Brady 1977\n\nSingles released from album: “I Wish”, “Sir Duke”, “Another Star” and “As.”\n\nWhen Stevie Wonder’s album “Songs in the Key of Life” came out, many consumers wanted Tamla Records to release “Isn’t She Lovely” as a single. Wonder didn’t want his over six-minute song to be edited and refused to have his song cut up into a shorter 45-RPM record. Many Top 40 stations played the song anyway, including WROV. Rob O’Brady would often play Wonder’s album track on his morning drive show and announce that it was dedicated to his loyal listeners, fondly known as “O’Brady’s Ladies.”\n\n8. Let It Flow—Eric Clapton\n\nFrom the “461 Ocean Boulevard” album: Released July 1974\n\nWROV DJs I Associate with Song: Chuck Holloway, Bart Prater & Rob O’Brady 1974\n\nSingles released from album: “I Shot the Sheriff” and “Willie and the Hand Jive.”\n\nWhile most Top 40 stations added “Willie and the Hand Jive” to their playlists after Eric Clapton hit number 1 with “I Shot the Sheriff”, WROV went in another direction. Music director Chuck Holloway added the album track “Let it Grow” to its hot rotation and aired in all day-parts. Clapton plays a dobro on this track and Yvonne Elliman provides backup vocals on this melodic tune.\n\n7. South City Midnight Lady—The Doobie Brothers\n\nFrom “The Captain and Me” album: Released March 2, 1973\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Bart Prater & Larry Bly 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Long Train Running” and “China Grove.”\n\n“South City Midnight Lady” is quite different from most Doobie Brothers songs. The tune features a pedal steel guitar, strings and synthesizer. I distinctly remember WROV’s morning DJ Larry Bly playing the song regularly in the fall of 1973. However, I mostly associate this Doobie Brothers song with afternoon announcer Bart Prater. “South City Midnight Lady” was Prater’s favorite song that he played on WROV. The legendary Roanoke DJ played it regularly on the station between 1973 and 1981, before leaving to work at crosstown K92 FM.\n\n6. The Chain—Fleetwood Mac\n\nFrom the “Rumours” album: Released February 4, 1977\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Rob O’Brady 1977\n\nSingles released from album: “Go Your Own Way”, “Dreams”, “Don’t Stop” and “You Make Loving Fun.”\n\nFleetwood Mac (FM) was hot on Top 40 radio in 1977 with four-top 10 singles. Fans wanted more songs to be played from the “Rumours” album and WROV obliged by adding a fifth song from the LP. “The Chain” is the only FM song from the album with writing credits from all five members (Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood. The band also regularly opens their concert tours by playing “The Chain.”\n\n5. Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding—Elton John\n\nFrom the “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” album: Released October 5, 1973\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Chuck Holloway 1974\n\nSingles released from album: “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting”, “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\n“Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding” was too long for a single release, but we played it at WROV in 1974 when I first started working for the station. Coming in at over 11-minutes long, this rock song was aired only after 7 pm and then up to 5 am the next morning. Chuck Holloway played it at least once every evening on his air shift. This medley of two songs from the “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” album, is a renowned musical masterpiece by the Bernie Taupin/Elton John duo.\n\n4. I Heard It Through the Grapevine—Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nFrom the “Cosmo’s Factory” album: Released July 8, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Bill Thomas 1970\n\nSingles released from album: “Travelin’ Band/Who’ll Stop the Rain”, “Up Around the Bend/Run Through the Jungle” and “Lookin’ Out My Backdoor/Long as I Can See the Light.”\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) had 3-double sided top 5 hit singles from their “Cosmos Factory” album. In the fall of 1970, many Top 40 stations played CCR’s 11-minute cover version of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” At WROV, the CCR album track only aired during night time air shifts. 7 to midnight DJ Bill Thomas played the album track on Roanoke’s top 40 outlet.\n\nIn 1972, CCR broke up and John Fogerty had a nasty falling out with his record company. Fantasy Records released an edited 3:53 version of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” as a single. It peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973. Obviously, this version cuts out most of the outstanding instrumental ending with the Motown cover tune.\n\n3. Maybe I’m Amazed—Paul McCartney\n\nFrom self-titled “McCartney” album: Released April 17, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Jack Fisher 1970\n\nApple Records was in a quandary in April 1970: Paul McCartney officially confirmed that the Beatles had broken up, and the last Fab Four album, “Let it Be” was set to be released in May, along with the Beatles single, “The Long and Winding Road.”\n\nOn top of all that activity, a self-titled “McCartney” debut solo album, came out just a week after the news that the Beatles were history. It was then decided by Apple Records that no singles would be released from Sir Paul’s LP. That didn’t stop WROV from adding the album track “Maybe I’m Amazed” to its playlist. It was a midday favorite of legendary DJ Jack Fisher.\n\nForward to December 1976: an album by Paul McCartney & Wings was released called “Wings Over America.” This live LP featured a cover of “Maybe I’m Amazed” and it became the lead single from the album. This new rendition peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1977.\n\n2. Baba O’Riley—The Who\n\nFrom the “Who’s Next” album: Released August 14, 1971\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Dan Alexander 1971\n\nSingles released from album: “Won’t Get fooled Again” and Behind Blue Eyes.”\n\nThe opening track from the 1971 “Who’s Next” album is “Baba O’Riley.” The song most music critics consider as the best ever recorded by the Who was not released as a 45-RPM single 51 years ago.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: “Baba O’Riley” appears in Time magazine’s “All-Time 100 Songs” list, Rolling Stone’s list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time”, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.”\n\nMy fond memory of hearing this album track played on WROV: DJ Dan Alexander created comedy bits on his AM drive show, under the fictional character name of Marvin Meriweather. One morning just after Alexander started playing “Baba O’Riley”, Marvin shouts out the chorus refrain: “It’s only TEENAGE WASTELAND, they’re all WASTED.” It was truly a LOL moment for me.\n\nStairway to Heaven—Led Zeppelin\n\nFrom the “Lead Zeppelin IV” album: Released November 8, 1971\n\nWROV DJs I Associated with Song: Terry Young and Shane Randall 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Black Dog” and “Rock and Roll.”\n\nMy number 1 selection on the countdown is “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin, which is the signature song by the English band. WROV’s Terry Young played the song every night in 1973, when he was employed by the station.\n\nComposed by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, “Stairway to Heaven” is considered by many as the best rock song of all-time. This Led Zeppelin tune was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, voted as the third “Greatest Rock Song” by VH1, ranked #31 on the Rolling Stone “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” listing and inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nLed Zeppelin didn’t release many singles during their career and their greatest song was only available as an album track during the 70s decade. Without a doubt, “Stairway to Heaven” is the number 1 song played on WROV/Top 40 radio in the 70s and not released as a 45 RPM single.\n\nNow that I have submitted my top ten 70s album tracks that weren’t released as singles, I am curious to find out your opinions of this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nIf you were living in the 70s and listened to Top 40 radio were any of the tunes listed above played on your home town station? Or maybe a Top 40 outlet in your community played different album tracks than the songs that I documented in this article?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the best album tracks that never were released as a 45 RPM record during the 70s. I look forward reading your responses. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nIf you have lived in central or southwestern Virginia over the past 50 plus years, chances are you have heard music written by Tommy Holcomb. The Roanoke, Virginia native has created hundreds of musical TV/radio commercials, which have been aired throughout Roanoke/Lynchburg media markets, as owner of Tommy Holcomb Productions.\n\nHolcomb musical talent is much more than just creating ads for clients. He is also a founding member of two successful Roanoke pop/rock/folk bands during the 60s, 70s and 80s: The Vikings and Woodsmoke. Holcomb’s journey creating music is renowned among those associated with history of the rich Roanoke music scene.\n\nI had an opportunity to conduct a phone interview with Holcomb earlier this month, as we discussed a musical career spanning over 60 years. I have known Tommy since 1975. We first met at WROV 1240 AM Roanoke, when Holcomb was delivering a commercial that he produced to the radio station where I was employed.\n\nHolcomb’s musical roots started the summer before his senior year at Patrick Henry High School in 1961. Tommy started a band named the Vikings, along with his fellow classmates Allen Nelms and Lane Craig.\n\nAfter Nelms and Holcomb graduated from high school, the young adults left Roanoke to attend the University of Virginia (UVA). The Vikings occasionally played gigs together, when Nelms and Holcomb were in college at UVA between 1962 and 1966.\n\nUpon graduation from college in 1966, Holcomb and Nelms returned to Roanoke and resurrected their Vikings band. One of the guys joining this new version of the band was the legendary WROV 1240 AM DJ Fred Frelantz. Another prominent person that was added to the Vikings was Joy Ellis in 1969.\n\nFor the next 7 years, the Vikings became the house band for the historic Coffee Pot Roadhouse restaurant and concert venue. The band signed a recording contract with London records during 1967.\n\nDuring the early 70s, Holcomb’s Vikings band recorded a couple of albums before the group broke up in 1975. Forward to 1982, the Vikings came back together again and held a series of reunion concerts at Caesar’s Club in Roanoke. After the success of those shows, the band decided to resume performing live concerts.\n\nVikings band continued playing shows during the mid 80s, and the group changed their name to “Roanoke” when they signed a record contract in 1984. The following year, two singles were released but received limit airplay locally on the biggest Top 40 station in the Roanoke Lynchburg market: K92 FM 92.3. Consequently, these songs did not chart nationally.\n\nThe final ending for the band became reality in 1986, with the tragic, untimely death of group member Fred Frelantz. For a complete history of the Vikings band, I am providing a link to an article that Holcomb wrote for the Roanoker Magazine in 2006, that is reprinted via the WROV History Online Website.\n\nThe other band that Holcomb was associated with during the 70s is Woodsmoke. Along with Joy Ellis, the band was formed in 1975 and attracted a younger audience than patrons who came to attend Holcomb’s original Vikings band shows.\n\nWhile Holcomb is known for his singing and playing in Roanoke bands since the 60s, he is not just a one trick pony. Equally as impressive is his creative talent writing music with Tommy Holcomb Productions.\n\nIn the field of advertising, Tommy has created hundreds of commercials featuring his musical genius. Before starting his own ad agency, Holcomb joined fellow Vikings band member Fred Frelantz, to work at Creative Advertising in Roanoke.\n\nDuring his time at Creative, Holcomb wrote a musical jingle for Smartwear clothing store. Tommy enlisted his Vikings bandmates playing music and utilized Joy Ellis on vocals for the spot.\n\nMuch to the surprise of Holcomb, his Smartwear commercial actually won a national ad agency award in 1971. After his multiple success writing musical spots at Creative, Holcomb decided to launch out with his own ad agency.\n\nOver the years, Holcomb has created many wonderful, catchy musical ads. Below is a Roanoke jingle medley, a compilation of various musical ads that Holcomb has produced.\n\nThree years ago, Holcomb was honored by the Roanoke chapter of the American Advertising Federation (AAF), with its Silver Medal Award. This AAF 2019 achievement recognized Tommy’s “outstanding lifetime contributions to advertising furthering the industry’s standards, creative excellence, and responsibility in areas of social concern.”\n\nTommy Holcomb doesn’t just write music for advertising. He also has written songs about and for the city of Roanoke.\n\nRoanoke’s centennial happened in 1982 and Holcomb was commissioned by the Virginia City to write a song for the 100-year celebration. The composition is called “Roanoke Shining Through.” A YouTube video of this tune features paintings by Eric Fitzpatrick and photographs by Terry Aldhizer.\n\nAnother excellent tribute to Roanoke is a song written and performed by Holcomb called “Looking Back.” Tommy fondly remembers living in the “Star City of the South” during younger years.\n\nDuring 2011, Holcomb tried his hand in radio and hosted a show called Retro Roanoke Radio (RRR) on Sunny FM 93.5. The format of the weekly program had Holcomb playing 60s/70s oldies, talking about Roanoke in the 20th Century, airing musical spots he created and interviewing pop/rock artists.\n\nSome of the artists that Holcomb interviewed on RRR were Davy Jones, Melanie, Petula Clark, Anne Murray and Robbin Thompson.\n\nFor the past 15 years, Holcomb has been the Music Producer for the Miss Virginia Pageant. Seven years ago, Tommy wrote an orchestra score for one of Virginia’s official state songs: “Our Great Virginia” written by Mike Greenly. Miss Virginia contestants performed this arrangement during the 2015 pageant.\n\nAn excellent podcast I want to recommend is episode 3 of the Larry Dowdy Mic Side podcast, where the retired popular Roanoke area DJ interviews Holcomb. There is superb interchange of information provided by Dowdy and Holcomb with this Mic Side episode.\n\nIt is clear to me that Holcomb exemplifies humility, as he has woven an awe-inspiring tapestry of living experiences within the area of music.\n\nAs I reflect upon Holcomb’s music legacy, he has enriched the lives of countless Roanoke residents with musical magic. For over 60 years, Holcomb has continued to share his music talent with folks all across the Roanoke Valley and Southwestern Virginia.\n\nWithout a doubt, Roanoke continues to be blessed, receiving wonderful gifts of harmonies and melodies by this marvelous music man: Tommy Holcomb.\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nI am amazed by the popularity of one hit wonders, and how the topic brings back nostalgic memories for many folks. Three articles that I have written over the past couple of years, about 1969, 1970 and 1971 one hit wonders, are among my most viewed messages of all-time.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” of 1972. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 50 years ago.\n\nI have fond memories listening to Top 40 radio during 1972. I turned 17 that year and lived in Roanoke County, Virginia. During daytime hours, I was a regular listener to a couple of local Top 40 AM radio stations: WROV and WBLU.\n\nMy go to station was legendary WROV 1240 AM, which was the top-rated radio outlet in Roanoke. The WROV DJs that I remember during 1972 include Bart Prater, Larry Bly, Dan Alexander, Ron Tompkins, Phil Beckman and Charlie Bell.\n\nWBLU 1480 AM was the other Top 40 outlet in the Roanoke radio market. The only times that I listened to WBLU was traveling via school bus to and from Glenvar High School, and during an afternoon art class that I took during my junior year.\n\nAt sundown, WROV reduced their power and WBLU signed off the air, so I tuned in radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. Since radio waves changed on a nightly basis, I would listen to a variety of 50,000-watt, clear channel AM stations on any given night.\n\nThere were three main stations that I listened to during the nighttime: WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM and WABC 770 AM New York. On the Big 89 WLS, I remember DJs John Records Landecker, Fred Winston, Chuck Buell and JJ Jeffries. When tuning in WCFL, I would listen to Larry Lujack, Big Ron O’Brien and Bob Dearborn. With WABC, I regularly heard Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) and Dan Ingram.\n\nA Top 40 radio station that is memorable to me in 1972 was WAPE 690 AM Jacksonville. My family was on vacation in Florida during July ’72 and I talked my parents into letting me visit the WAPE studios that was located in Orange Park. Since it was my dream to become a DJ once I graduated from high school, getting to visit the “Big APE” was extremely exciting for me.\n\nDuring my tour of WAPE, I got to meet music director and afternoon DJ Cleveland Wheeler, who gave me a quick look around the station. Then before leaving, Wheeler allowed me to view the “Big APE” main studio, where Larry Dixon was working his midday DJ shift.\n\nMy visit to WAPE was influential in my pursuit to make radio a career. Less than two years later, I landed a job with WROV Roanoke in April 1974. I was thankful that I had the opportunity to tour the “Big APE” during the summer of 1972.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nAny songs peaking outside of the Top 40, are always excluded for consideration.\n\nSongs that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are never considered as second hits.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nWhen I started researching the topic of 1972 one hit wonders, I found some interesting data. There happened to be no artists with only one hit, among the 20 biggest songs from 50 years ago. Below are the top records for 1972, according to Billboard magazine:\n\n1 “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” Roberta Flack\n\n2 “Alone Again (Naturally)” Gilbert O’Sullivan\n\n3 “American Pie” Don McLean\n\n4 “Without You” Nilsson\n\n5 “The Candy Man” Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n6 “I Gotcha” Joe Tex\n\n7 “Lean on Me” Bill Withers\n\n8 “Baby, Don’t Get Hooked on Me” Mac Davis\n\n9 “Brand New Key” Melanie\n\n10 “Daddy Don’t You Walk So Fast” Wayne Newton\n\n11 “Let’s Stay Together” Al Green\n\n12 “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” Looking Glass\n\n13 “Oh Girl” The Chi-Lites\n\n14 “Nice to Be with You” Gallery\n\n15 “My Ding-a-Ling” Chuck Berry\n\n16 “(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don’t Want to Be Right” Luther Ingram\n\n17 “Heart of Gold” Neil Young\n\n18 “Betcha by Golly, Wow” The Stylistics\n\n19 “I’ll Take You There” The Staple Singers\n\n20 “Ben” Michael Jackson\n\nBefore I start sharing my 1972 one hit wonders countdown, I need to correct inaccurate information on the topic. Some Internet sites erroneously give 1972 one hit wonder status to songs and artists with multiple Top 40 hits. Clearly, the two singles listed below ARE NOT 1972 ONE HIT WONDERS:\n\nBrandy (You’re a Fine Girl)—Looking Glass\n\nOne of my all-time favorite epic story songs from the 70s is actually a two-hit wonder. During the summer of 1972, “Brandy” was a number 1 song. Looking Glass had a follow up hit in 1973 with “Jimmy Loves Mary Ann” which peaked at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. If “Brandy” had truly been the only hit for Looking Glass, it would have made #1 on my 1972 one hit wonder countdown.\n\nLayla—Derek & the Dominoes\n\nIt is absurd to place Eric Clapton as a one hit wonder. Clapton is the writer, singer and lead guitarist for the song “Layla” which was recorded under his band’s name of Derek & the Dominoes. The only 3-time member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, had 16 Top 40 solo hits, including covering his song “Layla” in 1993. The legendary guitarist also charted multiple top 40 hits, as a member of Cream and the Yardbirds. Absolutely, Eric Clapton is NOT a one hit wonder.\n\nAs I surveyed all true one hit wonders from 1972, I found 13 high quality singles that are on my countdown. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant. Ahead of my countdown beginning, I want to share some extra songs that didn’t make my Baker’s Dozen listing.\n\nNovelty records that were one hit wonders in 1972:\n\n• Jungle Fever—The Chakachas\n\n• How Do You Do—Mouth and Macneal\n\n• The Delegates—Convention 72\n\nSix-extra ’72 one hit wonders.

Arlo Guthrie’s biggest Top 40 hit.\n\nHold Your head up—Argent\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Hot 100 #5, 50th Biggest Song of 1972.\n\nAs a founding member of the Zombies, Ron Argent was keyboardist and a chief song-writer for his British rock band. He penned 3 of the Zombies biggest hits: “She’s Not There”, “Tell Her No” & “Time of the Season.”\n\nIn 1969, Ron Argent left the Zombies and formed a new rock band, named after himself: Argent. Three years later, the band released the album “All Together Now” which featured Argent’s only song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100: “Hold Your Head Up.”\n\nHere is what legendary keyboardist Rick Wakeman proclaims in a Louder Sound Dot COM quote: “Rod (Argent) is a good friend, and I’m not just picking people because they’re my mates, I’m picking this because it’s brilliant. The organ solo in “Hold Your Head Up” is, for me, one of the finest organ solos on a record. It’s brilliantly put together, and from an era where you couldn’t go back and correct notes and redo things. It’s a true solo. A little work of art, so it has to go in. It’s just brilliant, so good.”\n\nThe first time that I heard Argent’s song was via radio, on WAPE Jacksonville and the Big APE played it multiple times the week I was on vacation in Florida (July ’72). I loved the song when it was a hit and still have fondness for the tune nearly 50 years later. Without a doubt, my top number 1 outstanding one hit wonder from 1972 is “Hold Your Head Up” by Argent.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my countdown of 1972 one hit wonders, I am curious to find out your opinion on this topic. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique. The songs that you feel are the best may be completely different from my selections.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best one hit wonders from 1972? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nI leave you with lyrics from a 1972 Mac Davis authored song, “I Believe in Music” that pop rock band Gallery covered during 1972: “Music is the universal language, and love is the key, to peace hope and understanding, and living in harmony.” Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nOver the years, I have had many conversations about 70s disco music with friends or acquaintances. At some point during those types of musical discussions, I will ask the question: “What do you consider to be the best Top 40 disco hits of the 70s decade?”\n\nResponses to my inquiries about the greatest disco hits will vary but many folks will choose multiple songs by the same artist, when selecting their favorite 70s disco tunes.\n\nWhile there isn’t anything wrong with picking multiple songs from the same artist in a listing of the best disco songs from the 70s, I am choosing different methodology in coming up with my own compilation of superior disco singles.\n\nFor this music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the 20 best disco singles by 20 different artists. Here are the rules and criteria that I have set forth for this musical exercise:\n\nEach artist, group, band or singer will have just one song listed on the top 20 countdown.\n\nAll selections were hits on Top 40 radio and charted at number 20 or lower on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nI deem each of my selections to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nSong charted nationally on Billboard Hot 100 between 1975 and 1979.\n\nThe term “disco” is shorthand for the word discothèque, a French word for “library of phonograph records.”\n\nPlease note that I will not be giving a complete history of disco music with this message. For those who long for more information, there are multiple books, articles and links via the Internet on this topic.\n\nGenesis of disco music wasn’t instantaneous but evolved during the first years of the 70s.\n\nBelow is a partial listing of Top 40 hits that were precursors to the formation of disco between 1971 and 1973.\n\nTheme from Shaft—Isaac Hayes\n\nFunky Nassau—The Beginning of the End\n\nRock Steady—Aretha Franklin\n\nJungle Fever—Chakachas\n\nSoul Makossa—Manu Dibango\n\nSuperfly—Curtis Mayfield\n\nPapa Was a Rolling Stone—The Temptations\n\nMasterpiece—The Temptations\n\nLove Train—The O’Jays\n\nThe Love I Lost—Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes\n\nDuring the first few months of 1974, a couple of proto-disco songs became hits on top 40 radio. Both tunes reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100:\n\nLove’s Theme—The Love Unlimited Orchestra (Barry White)\n\nTSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)—MFSB and the Three Degrees\n\nDuring April 1974, I landed my first job in radio, working for Top 40 WROV Roanoke (1240 AM). For the next 18 months, I witnessed firsthand the tremendous growth of disco music at Roanoke’s top rated Top 40 outlet.\n\nOne of the most popular songs that I played during the summer of 1974 on WROV is “Rock the Boat” by the Hues Corporation. This up-tempo classic R&B/Soul tune was number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is considered by some music historians as the earliest disco song to be a mainstream hit.\n\nAnother landmark recording of disco music from the summer of 1974 is “Rock Your Baby” by George McCrae. Co-written and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC & the Sunshine Band, the song sold over 11 million copies worldwide.\n\nOther Top 40 disco hits in 1974:\n\nNever Can Say Goodbye—Gloria Gaynor\n\nYou’re the First, The Last, My Everything—Barry White\n\nWhen Will I See You Again—Three Degrees\n\nKung Fu Fighting—Carl Douglas\n\nIt was during the summer of 1975 that I realized that disco music was going to be huge, when “The Hustle” by Van McCoy was the number 1 song in Roanoke and nationally on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMy radio station WROV had a remote broadcast at the Kings Inn, a nightclub on Salem Avenue in downtown Roanoke. I was engineer for this 3-hour remote and spun 45-rpm singles, which included all of the top 10 songs from the WROV playlist.\n\nWhen I played Van McCoy’s number 1 hit during the first 15 minutes on the Kings Inn remote, just about every patron at the nightclub went on the dance floor to “do the hustle.” Because of the overwhelming positive response when I played the disco hit, Kings Inn management requested that I spin “The Hustle” a few more times before the remote was scheduled to end.\n\nAfter I consulted with my fellow WROV staff members, I broke the station’s format and played “The Hustle” two other times that evening. Close to 100 percent of everyone in the building danced on my second and third plays of Van McCoy’s hit. Needless to say, disco music was alive and well in Roanoke that night at the Kings Inn.\n\nThe Royal Kings were the house band for Roanoke’s 70s premier nightclub, the Kings Inn. Photo is a scan from a Roanoke Times newspaper article, provided to me by band member Larry Wheeling, who is pictured above.\n\nOther Top 40 disco hits in 1975:\n\nPick Up the Pieces—Average White Band\n\nLady Marmalade—LaBelle\n\nExpress—BT Express\n\nThat’s the Way (I Like It)—KC & the Sunshine Band\n\nFly, Robin, Fly—Silver Convention\n\nJive Talkin’—The Bees Gees\n\nMy time playing disco records ended in November 1975 as I accepted a full-time radio job with AM/FM combo WRIS 1410 and WJLM 93.5 Roanoke. However, I still tracked the genre of music listening to various Top 40 stations including WROV, WLS Chicago and WABC New York.\n\nBefore I reveal my countdown of supreme disco hits, I am sharing ten songs that I considered for the Top 20 but didn’t make the cut. These selections are listed in random order with no repeat artists:\n\nDisco Inferno—The Tramps\n\nCar Wash—Rose Royce\n\nMiss You—Rolling Stones\n\nDon’t Leave Me this Way—Thelma Houston\n\nI Love the Nightlife—Alicia Bridges\n\nKnock on Wood—Amii Stewart\n\nWho Loves You—The Four Seasons\n\nTurn the Beat Around—Vickie Sue Robinson\n\nAin’t No Stopping Us Now—McFadden & Whitehead\n\nRing My Bell—Anita Ward\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below, comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the “bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nI now present what I consider to be the top 20 best disco songs from the 70s. As Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show, “Now on with the countdown.”\n\n20.

Stayin’ Alive—The Bee Gees (1978)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 4th Biggest Song of 1978\n\nComing in second on the countdown is my selection by the Bee Gees. Written by brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, biggest song from the “Saturday Night Fever” motion picture soundtrack. Great guitar hook with a pulsating beat.\n\n“Stayin’” Alive” is one of the most iconic disco songs from the 70s. Rolling Stone ranks it at number 99 on their “Greatest Songs of All Time” listing. Placed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. This signature song from the Bees Gees, is my second-best disco single of the 70s.\n\nI Feel Love—Donna Summer (1977)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #6 Hot 100, 96th Biggest Song of 1977\n\nWhen I think of the greatest disco artist from the 70s, there is only one person who fits that bill: Donna Summer. The “Queen of Disco” was one of the leading female vocalists during the disco era of music and then extending into the early 80s.\n\n“I Feel Love” is one of the most influential songs of the 20th century. Music historians believe that the 1977 disco hit, had a major impact in the development of electronic dance music (EDM). Many who chronicle music history, consider the Donna Summer single to be the first ever recorded EDM song.\n\nSummer’s ground breaking song also had a significant impact with other genres of music, such as New Wave, Punk Rock, Synth-Pop, House, and Disco, during the late 70s, early 80s and beyond.\n\nGiorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte produced and co-wrote “I Feel Love” along with Donna Summer. The use of a Moog synthesizer, with a repetitive beat, gives the tune a hypnotic, rhythmic feel, that was popular on disco dance floors all across America.\n\nWithout a doubt, I proclaim that “I Feel Love” by Donna Summer is the most supreme disco hit from the 70s.\n\nAfter I finished compiling information for the 20 songs listed above, I realized an interesting fact. Over the past 5 years, I have regularly played many of these songs at wedding receptions, class reunions and other similar events where I am hired for DJ gigs. My 20 selected disco tunes are still popular with those who want to dance.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my countdown of the top 20 supreme disco songs of the 70s, I am curious to find out your opinion on this topic. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique on what I consider to be the best disco songs. The songs that you feel are the best may be completely different from my selections.\n\nI am asking for your opinion: What do you consider to be the best disco songs from the 70s? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nIf you are a fan of 70s disco music, I welcome your comments below. I leave you with these lyrics by Alicia Bridges and Susan Hutcheson: “I love the nightlife, I got to boogie on the disco ’round.” Disco on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best 45-rpm single in the category of epic story song during the golden age of Top 40 radio?\n\nMany would select “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin as it is arguably one of the greatest classic rock songs of all-time. However, the most iconic tune from the “Led Zeppelin IV” album was never released as a 45-rpm single.\n\nAnother tune that some music critics would point out as the best epic story song would be “A Day in the Life” from the Beatles. Of course, there were no 45-rpm singles released from the 1967 legendary Fab Four, “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album.\n\nAlthough, “Stairway to Heaven” and “A Day in the Life” are outstanding epic songs that tell a story, neither song meets the criteria of being released as a 45-rpm single. Both legendary songs were only available for purchase on “long play” 33 1/3-rpm record albums.\n\nThe golden age of Top 40 radio (1965 to 1980) is the time period that I am using for selecting the best epic story songs. All selections were hits on Top 40 radio and charted at number 30 or lower on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nI will be counting down my favorite epic story songs into two silos. My first list will feature songs less than 5 minutes long. The second countdown will consist of selections over 5:00 in length.\n\nIn the early days of Top 40 radio, 45-rpm singles generally averaged under 3 minutes long. Eventually, record companies started releasing singles longer in length. “Like a Rolling Stone” from Bob Dylan was the first 45-rpm single over 6-minutes long and the iconic tune peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965.\n\nThree years later in 1968, there were two smash hit singles that broke the 7-minute mark. “MacArthur Park” by Richard Harris at 7:21 in length, peaked at number 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.\n\nThen came the first 7-minute long single to reach the number 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100: “Hey Jude” by the Beatles. The song spent 9 weeks at the top spot in America and was the biggest selling single of 1968.\n\nAs the 70s decade started, some of the biggest top 40 hits were story songs that were 5-minutes or less in length.\n\nTie a Yellow Ribbon round the Old Oak Tree—Tony Orlando & Dawn\n\nNight the Lights Went Out in Georgia—Vicki Lawrence\n\nMe and Bobby McGee—Janis Joplin\n\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down—Joan Baez\n\nBad Bad Leroy Brown—Jim Croce\n\nSome of the most superb epic top 40 hits during the 70s, just didn’t develop a good story line. Eric Clapton’s song “Layla” falls into this category. The Derek and the Dominoes summer of 1972 hit has excellent guitar playing but contains weak lyrical content.\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be counting down two sets of epic story songs. My first listing will be songs that are all 5-minutes in length or less. The second list will be comprised of singles over 5-minutes long.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article, comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nWith my two countdowns of epic story songs, I am sharing my personal favorites. Songs which I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant. Now it is time to reveal my first countdown: Best epic story songs that are less than 5 minutes in length:\n\n10. In the Ghetto—Elvis Presley\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1969: #1 Hot 100: 35th Biggest Song of Year\n\nDescribes the vicious cycle of poverty, violence and despair. With an inner-city Chicago newborn, growing to adulthood. Comeback hit for the “King of Rock and Roll.”\n\n9. Take the Money and Run—Steve Miller Band\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts for 1976: #11 Hot 100: 98th Biggest Song of Year\n\nMessage about two bandits being pursued by a detective. Couple heads to El Paso and then south, possibly to Mexico or beyond. Lead single from the “Fly Like an Eagle” album.\n\n8. Eleanor Rigby—The Beatles\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1966: #1 Hot 100: 90th Biggest Song of Year\n\nBaroque Pop. John Lennon and Paul McCartney lyrics are commentary on loneliness, isolation and despair. Double A-side single with “Yellow Submarine.”\n\n7. You’re So Vain—Carly Simon\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1973: #1 Hot 100: 9th Biggest Song of Year\n\nThe signature song of Carly Simon. Describes a former lover who has a narcissistic personality disorder: Self-centered with vanity issues. Received Grammy Hall of Fame award in 2004.\n\n6. Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)—Looking Glass\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1972: #1 Hot 100: 12th Biggest Song of Year\n\nElliot Lurie of Looking Glass has an engaging story: Brandy works in a seaport harbor town as a barmaid and the man she loves is a sailor. Unfortunately for Brandy, the seaman is never in port and honestly declared to her before leaving for the last time: “But my life, my lover and my lady is the sea.”\n\n5. City of New Orleans—Arlo Guthrie\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1972: #18 Hot 100: 45th Biggest Song of Year\n\nLate singer-songwriter Steve Goodman portrays a train ride from Chicago to New Orleans on the Illinois Central Railroad and their legendary “City of New Orleans” rail line. The song was written in 1971, after Amtrak took over servicing the famous railroad route from Illinois Central. Arlo Guthrie’s biggest Top 40 hit.\n\n4. Harper Valley PTA—Jeannie C Riley\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1968: #1 Hot 100: 11th Biggest Song of Year.\n\nCountry singer-songwriter Tom T Hall created a most unusual story for this crossover Top 40 hit. The Harper Valley PTA meeting was a wild and wacky affair as an “unfit mother” addresses her concerns about the hypocrisy of multiple other members with the school organization.\n\n3. A Boy Named Sue—Johnny Cash\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1969: #2 Hot 100: 36th Biggest Song of Year\n\nShel Silverstein’s lyrics about a father abandoning his son at age 3, with only a guitar and naming the boy Sue, became the biggest hit song for Johnny Cash.

Harry Chapin’s signature song gives a sorrowful picture of a father neglecting his son as a child. When the son becomes an adult, he actually neglects his father, in the same exact way that his father treated him during childhood. This folk-rock song gives a baleful warning with outstanding lyrics.\n\nOde to Billie Joe—Bobbie Gentry\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1967: #1 Hot 100: 3rd Biggest Song of Year\n\nMy number 1 selection for short epic story songs goes to “Ode to Billie Joe” written and recorded by Bobbie Gentry.\n\nLyrics for “Ode to Billie Joe” are written in the form of first-person narrative, by a Mississippi Delta teenage daughter. The song begins on the 3rd of June, with the narrator having mealtime conversations with her parents and brother.\n\nWhile most of the dinner conversation is on mundane activities and events, the mother shares the big news from Choctaw Ridge: “Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.”\n\nThe dinner conversations continue with various unrelated dialogue but an important fact is revealed. The daughter and Billie Joe may have been in a relationship and both may have been together “throwing somethin’ off the Tallahatchie Bridge” just before Billie Joe’s death?\n\nBobby Gentry provided brilliant lyrics on “Ode to Billie Joe” and it is my favorite epic story song that is under 5 minutes long.\n\nThe ten songs from my first countdown above, include some of the most beloved hits from the golden age of Top 40 radio. Now is it time for my second countdown. These are the best epic story songs over 5 minutes in length:\n\n10. Space Oddity—David Bowie\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1973: #15 Hot 100: 97th Biggest Song of Year\n\nFirst released as a single in July 1969, same month as Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the moon.

A set of brothers ask their mother pointed questions on the topic of a dead father: The siblings never knew their father and have only heard bad things about the man’s character. Won 3 Grammy Awards in 1973.\n\n8. Same Old Lang Syne—Dan Fogelberg\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Chart 1980: #9 Hot 100: 79th Biggest Song of 1981\n\nDan Fogelberg wrote an autobiographical account of a Christmas visit to his parents’ home during the mid 70s.

Bohemian Rhapsody—Queen\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1976 & 1992: #9 Hot 100 & 18th Biggest Song of 1976: #2 Hot 100 & 39th Biggest Song of 1992:\n\nRock opera suite written by Freddie Mercury. Queen’s composition is about a young man who accidentally killed a man and is facing pending execution.

Hotel California—Eagles\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts 1977: #1 Hot 100: 19th Biggest Song of Year\n\nOne of the most iconic rock songs from the 20th Century is “Hotel California.” Co-written by Don Felder, Glenn Frey and Don Henley, the words depict both literal and symbolic interpretations of Southern California lifestyles from the 70s.

American Pie—Don McLean\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Charts 1972: #1 Hot 100: 3rd Biggest Song of Year\n\n“American Pie” is perhaps the most mis-interpreted song in pop/rock music history. This much we know: The 1959 plane crash deaths of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens, is “the day the music died” according to Don McLean’s written masterpiece.\n\nThe author goes on to explore cultural changes within rock ‘n roll, proclaiming philosophical angst, disillusionment and disappointment with rock music created after 1959. McLean also includes the mention of multiple political events with his complex lyrics. “American Pie” comes in as my second favorite epic story single that is over 5 minutes long.\n\nWreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald—Gordon Lightfoot\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100: 36th Biggest Song of Year\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot comes in with my number one epic story song of all-time with “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.”\n\nThe topic that Lightfoot wrote about is based on an actual historical event. On November 10, 1975, the SS Edmund Fitzgerald ship sank during a storm on Lake Superior, with the entire 29-man crew dying that day.\n\nAfter reading an account of the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking in a Newsweek magazine article from 11/24/75, Lightfoot came up with the lyrics to what became his biggest record. The song paints a haunting and poignant picture of the last voyage with the Great Lakes freighter.\n\nWithout any doubt, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” by Gordon Lightfoot is my number 1 favorite epic story song from the golden age of top 40 radio.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my thoughts on the best epic story songs, I am curious to find out your opinion on this topic.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique on what I consider to be the best epic story songs of all-time. The songs that you may feel are the best, maybe be completely different from my selections.\n\nSo I am asking for your opinion: What do you consider to be the best epic story songs from 1965 through 1980? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I fondly remember and cherish all of the epic story songs that I shared with you on this music blog message.

Obviously, there are no definitive answers to my question.\n\nHowever, I will be sharing what I consider to be the top 20 MTV songs and clips broadcast by the pioneer 24 hour-a-day music channel during their premiere year (August 1, 1981 – July 31, 1982).\n\nDuring the first full year of MTV’s existence, the music video channel struggled as it was not available on most cable providers in the United States. It wasn’t until the third year of MTV that it became a major force and revolutionized the music industry.\n\nMTV was launched the first day of August 1981. The new cable channel played music videos 24 hours-a-day and featured hosts known as video jockeys (VJs). These individuals gave information on the music clips played and provided news about the artists that aired on MTV.\n\nThe programming that MTV utilized during the first year was similar to AOR (Album Oriented Rock) or Top 40 radio formats. Initially, MTV played established artists but later became a venue for many new pop rock bands during the second and third years of operation.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, here are the first 10 videos aired by MTV on August 1, 1981:\n\n* “Video Killed the Radio Star” The Buggles\n\n* “You Better Run” Pat Benatar\n\n* “She Won’t Dance With Me” Rod Stewart\n\n* “You Better You Bet” The Who\n\n* “Little Suzi’s on the Up” Ph. D.\n\n* “We Don’t Talk Anymore” Cliff Richard\n\n* “Brass in Pocket” The Pretenders\n\n* “Time Heals” Todd Rundgren\n\n* “Take It on the Run” REO Speedwagon\n\n* “Rockin’ the Paradise” Styx\n\nVideos for songs played within the first year of MTV must be judged differently than clips made during the 1983 to 1985 time period. Many of the early clips aired on MTV were of concert footage or live show performances. The production of concept videos soared after MTV’s debut and was a mainstay for the music TV cable channel during the 80s decade.\n\nBy 1985, there were many excellent created videos that made the MTV hot rotation. “Take On Me” by the Norwegian synth-pop band A-ha had a superb clip. The award-winning video used pencil-sketched animation and live-action footage combination called rotoscoping.\n\nAnother bodacious video clip from 1985 is “Money for Nothing” by Dire Straits. Opening lyrics on the song are provided by guest vocalist Sting singing the promotional phrase of the video channel, “I Want My MTV.” The ground breaking clip was MTV’s, “Video of the Year” in 1986.\n\nWhen MTV started on 8/1/81, the music TV channel aired many existing videos of songs that had been top 40 hits from either 1980 or the first 7 months of 1981.\n\nOf the top 10 biggest records from 1981, only half of the songs had videos available that could be aired by MTV. Below are the Billboard top-rated songs of 1981:\n\n1 “Bette Davis Eyes” Kim Carnes\n\n2 “Endless Love” Diana Ross & Lionel Richie\n\n3 “Lady” Kenny Rogers\n\n4 “(Just Like) Starting Over” John Lennon\n\n5 “Jessie’s Girl” Rick Springfield\n\n6 “Celebration” Kool & the Gang\n\n7 “Kiss on My List” Hall & Oates\n\n8 “I Love a Rainy Night” Eddie Rabbitt\n\n9 “9 To 5” Dolly Parton\n\n10 “Keep on Loving You” REO Speedwagon\n\nAfter the launching of MTV, most every major record company would produce some type of music video for new song releases. These record companies hoped that MTV would add their new song to its regular rotation of music clips.\n\nBelow are the ten biggest singles of 1982 according to Billboard and a selection from the videos MTV aired on their network:\n\n1 “Physical” Olivia Newton-John\n\n2 “Eye of the Tiger” Survivor\n\n3 “I Love Rock ‘n Roll” Joan Jett & The Blackhearts\n\n4 “Ebony and Ivory” Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder\n\n5 “Centerfold” The J. Geils Band\n\n6 “Don’t You Want Me” The Human League\n\n7 “Jack & Diane” John Cougar\n\n8 “Hurts So Good” John Cougar\n\n9 “Abracadabra” Steve Miller Band\n\n10 “Hard to Say I’m Sorry” Chicago\n\nOne of the chief criticisms of MTV during its first 18 months of operation was the lack of music by Black artists being played on the cable TV channel. It wasn’t until March 1983, that Michael Jackson’s video for “Billie Jean” was added and became the first video by a Black artist to be aired in heavy rotation on MTV. Without a doubt, “Billie Jean” is the best video from the second year of MTV.\n\nFor the rest of this message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the best songs and videos that were aired on MTV during the first 12 months. My selections all were top 40 radio hits and peaked at number 20 or lower on the Billboard Hot 100 between August 1981 and July 1982.\n\nPlease note: I am not declaring that my picks are either the “best or greatest” that MTV played during its first year. The song choices are my personal favorites from this time period. I deem the top 20 songs to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nChart information for my favorite Top 20 MTV song of the countdown comes from, “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn. I consider Whitburn’s publication to be the “bible” of Top 40 music reference and still proudly own a hard copy of this excellent music guide.\n\nAs legendary DJ host Casey Kasem used to proclaim on his weekly American Top 40 show, “Now on with the countdown.”\n\n20. Don’t Stop Believin’—Journey\n\nPeak Positions of Billboard Charts: #9 Hot 100: 73rd Biggest Song of 1982\n\nFirst of two Journey songs on countdown. Arena rock anthem of the 80s.

Every Little Thing She Does is Magic—The Police\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #3 Hot 100: 79th Biggest Song of 1982\n\nMy top selection was written by the Police front man/bassist Sting in 1976 but wasn’t recorded until 1981 for the “Ghost in the Machine” album. The song is unique among Police music as the tune features Jean Alain Roussel on piano and synthesizer. Andy Summers, Stewart Copeland and Sting blend together a perfect pop song, that is truly magic for me. “Every Little Thing She Does is Magic” is my pick for best song and video aired by MTV during the first year in business.\n\nNow that I have my countdown of favorite first-year MTV songs and video that were hits on Top 40 radio, I am curious to find out your thoughts on this topic.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with the critique of my favorite MTV videos and songs from 1981-1982. Your top selections maybe be completely different than my choices. There are no right or wrong answers, just various opinions about the music song videos MTV played during their first year in business.\n\n“I Want My MTV” was the main promotional slogan from the music TV cable channel in the early 80s. MTV doesn’t play music videos anymore but I still can enjoy watching video clips 24/7 via YouTube and or the Internet.\n\nI still have fond memories of MTV songs and videos from the first year: 1981-1982. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nHow many individuals in America can claim the following: Being a teen dancer on American Bandstand when the show was aired from Philadelphia, and years later as a DJ, meeting the Beatles backstage at the band’s first American concert in Washington D.C. during February 1964? The only person that I know who fits this bill is Jack Fisher.\n\nSo just who is Jack Fisher? Born in Wilmington, Fisher is most prominently known as a premier DJ with WROV 1240 AM Roanoke, Virginia during the golden days of Top 40 radio. I consider the legendary WROV announcer to be among the “Mount Rushmore” of radio personalities who worked in the Roanoke radio market during the 60s and 70s.\n\nI first met Fisher almost 46 years ago when I worked for WROV during 1975. I reconnected with him earlier this month and interviewed Fisher via phone from his current home of Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\nFisher was born in Wilmington, Delaware and was involved with a variety of athletic sporting activities during high school. He also loved listening to rock ‘n’ roll, dancing and attending concerts. His first taste of glory came during Fisher’s teen years at a TV show called Bandstand in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, WFIL TV in Philadelphia broadcasted a live daily program called Bandstand. During 1956, Dick Clark became permanent host of the program and in 1957, ABC picked up the show for its television network. Clark’s show was renamed American Bandstand with ABC’s distribution of the program for a national audience.\n\nWithin the first year of ABC’s takeover of American Bandstand, the show had a national teen dance contest. Fisher was a regular dancer on Clark’s TV show, and he entered the dance competition with a partner. The couple placed 4th place in the national dancing event.\n\nThe radio career of Jack Fisher started in the early 1960s at a small station in Georgetown, Delaware. Next up, Fisher moved to Portsmouth, Ohio and honed his skills at a bigger radio station. In late 1963, Fisher landed a major market job at Top 40 WEAM 1390 AM Washington, D.C.\n\nOn February 11, 1964, the Beatles performed their first American concert at the Washington Coliseum. Each of four DC Top 40 radio stations sent one of their DJs to emcee this debut Beatles show. With Fisher being the newest DJ hired at WEAM, he was “stuck” being the station’s representative for this historic concert event.\n\nWEAM DJ Jack Fisher got to meet the Beatles backstage prior to this legendary first American concert. Fisher told me during our phone conversation that John, Paul, George and Ringo were all respectful to him. The Fab Four were also friendly to the other Washington DJs and media members before they embarked on stage for their DC show.\n\nObviously, meeting the Beatles was the most memorable event of Fisher’s employment in the DC radio market. Less than a year after starting at WEAM, Fisher was let go by the station. While searching for DJ jobs in major markets, it was actually in Roanoke, Virginia where Fisher finally found a permanent home for his radio career. In November 1964, Fisher was hired at work at WROV 1240 AM.\n\nWROV dominated the Roanoke radio market. The station was small in radio power: transmitting only 1,000 watts in the daytime and 250 watts at night. Even though WROV’s coverage area was only 25 miles wide, the station totally controlled radio listenership within the Roanoke Valley.\n\nStarting on the 7 pm to midnight DJ shift, Fisher quickly became one of WROV’s most beloved on-air personalities. Early in 1965, Fisher moved to the afternoon slot (2pm to 7pm) and he continued in that capacity for the next seven years.\n\nOne of the first bits that Fisher created after coming to WROV was a big promotional campaign to have the Beatles perform a concert in Roanoke. According to the WROV History online website, “Fisher embarked on a campaign to bring the Beatles to Roanoke. Though several local businessmen were eager to sponsor the event, it never came to be. But, the attempt gained Jack much notoriety in the market.”\n\nBelow is a WROV aircheck of Fisher making a phone call on air to try and speak to George Harrison of the Beatles. Courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nFor a short time period in 1966, Fisher was paired with another popular WROV DJ Fred Frelantz and the two announcers shared co-hosting duties with an afternoon show. The “Fisher & Frelantz Fling” team were a dynamic duo: complimenting each other well, writing humorous skits and creating memorable parodies on their daily radio show.\n\nFrom the WROV History website and Pat Garrett: below is a Jack Fisher/Fred Frelantz aircheck of the fictitious beautiful downtown Bonsack Christmas parade. Fisher and Frelantz are the emcees for this “event.”\n\nThe Fisher/Frelantz duo were also heavily involved within the Roanoke community representing WROV at numerous events. Between the two of them, they emceed nearly every music concert that was held in the Roanoke Valley during the mid to late 60s.\n\nWROV sponsored concerts were normally held at one of two locations during Fisher’s first years employed by the station: Victory Stadium or the Salem Civic Center. During our phone conversation, Jack shared with me the most notable shows that he emceed were Paul Revere and the Raiders, James Brown, the Temptations, the Beach Boys, Wilson Pickett, Glen Campbell and Herman’s Hermits.\n\nI found it interesting that when Herman’s Hermits first came to Roanoke for a concert, Fisher formed a bond with the band’s lead singer Peter Noone. Fisher and Noone stuck up a friendship and they continue to communicate with one another on a regular basis, 56 years after their first meeting in Roanoke.\n\nThe most memorable WROV event that Fisher participated in came during the summer of 1969. June is National Dairy Month and Fisher had lunch with a cow in the parking lot of Crossroads Mall in Roanoke.\n\nPat Garrett from the WROV History Online Website, describes Fisher’s event: “Jack arrived in a limousine decked out with a tuxedo, for his lunch with the cow. Jack remembers “A large long table was set up with the cow on one end and me on the other, the cow ate hay, I of course dined only on dairy products. Several thousand people attended this event.”\n\nFor almost 7 years, Jack Fisher was a prominent radio voice with WROV. By 1971, Fisher decided to switch careers. He left WROV to work for Brand Edmonds advertising agency. Even though Fisher no longer was employed by WROV, he left the station on good term.\n\nSince Fisher was still in good graces with WROV station owner Burt Levine, he was asked occasionally to work some part time weekend gigs with WROV throughout the mid to late 70s. It was during one of these temporary gig jobs with WROV, that I first met Jack Fisher.\n\nAt WROV, I was hired to be a remote engineer by the Top 40 radio station. My responsibilities at the station included setting up equipment for remote broadcasts, running the soundboard and playing records, while a WROV DJ was in charge of announcing duties.\n\nOn Labor Day 1975, I was the engineer for a remote at Lowe’s and the DJ assigned to work with me was Fisher. It was a “solid gold holiday weekend” and I played all 50’s and early 60’s songs that day. I grew up listening to Fisher on WROV when I was younger, so it was a thrill being able to work with the legendary Roanoke DJ at that remote broadcast.\n\nInto the 80s, Fisher continued to be associated with WROV with various assignments. By this time, ratings for the once dominant Roanoke Top 40 station had fallen and WROV owner Burt Levine hired two of his former DJs for help: Jack Fisher and Fred Frelantz.\n\nStarting in March 1981, the dynamic duo of Fisher and Frelantz were back on the air at WROV: Hosting an “oldies” show once a month on Saturday afternoons. Fisher would begin the broadcast at 12 noon, and then Frelantz would join his DJ partner at 2 pm to close out the 6-hour show.\n\nWhen Frelantz moved out of Roanoke in 1982, Fisher assumed hosting the once-a-month oldies show by himself. Three years later, Frelantz moved back to Roanoke and the “Fisher/Frelantz Fling” was back as a two-man-operation.\n\nUnfortunately, the Fisher/Frelantz DJ partnership ended in June 1986, when Fred Frelantz died in an apartment fire. After this tragic death, Fisher once again hosted the oldies show as a solo DJ.\n\nThe WROV oldies show was continued by Fisher until he signed off for the last time on October 26, 1991. Below is an aircheck of Fisher’s final words on his oldies show. The clip is courtesy of the WROV History Online Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nOnce Fisher’s radio days had ended, he became involved in a project about American Bandstand. As the executive producer of the 1997 PBS TV documentary called “Bandstand Days”, Fisher utilized his knowledge about the dancers featured on Dick Clark’s TV show.\n\nNominated for an Emmy, Bandstand Days explores the origins, history and memorable experiences of dancers who performed during the Philadelphia days of American Bandstand. The documentary has footage of the TV show from 1957 and interviews some of the dancers from that era of the teen music program.\n\nJack Fisher has not slowed down during his retirement years. In 2016, Fisher co-wrote a book with Susan A. Sistare called “Blue Skies and Green Lights.” Fisher’s fictional account is billed as “a tale of music and magic of the 50s and 60s” and is loosely based on his real-life experiences with American Bandstand, the Beatles and radio stories about WROV Roanoke.\n\nIf you are looking for a light, easy and good read, I would recommend Fisher’s book. I enjoyed reading “Blue Skies and Green Lights” during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is available for purchased through Amazon.\n\nOne other activity that Fisher has been involved with since 2015 is teaching a class at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. As part of the Furman adult continuing education program, Fisher’s, “Music and Culture of the 60s” class explores how music and culture are tied together during the 60s decade. If I lived anywhere near South Carolina, I would love to take Jack’s course.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I spoke with Jack Fisher during a phone conversation earlier this month. After my interview with Fisher, I emailed the former DJ a list of six questions about important aspects of career and life experience highlights. Fisher’s responses to my questions are found below:\n\nDJ Dave: What is your most memorable encounter with Dick Clark and your days as a dancer on American Bandstand as a teen?\n\nJack: “Bandstand was local TV show in Philadelphia from 1952 until it went national on ABC-TV in 1957, becoming American Bandstand. Dick Clark staged a jitterbug contest that was designed as a way to test the national TV audience response. There were many at ABC who thought a bunch of kids dancing on TV for two hours every afternoon would not work.\n\nOn the first day with in studio judges, my partner Dottie Horner and I won. There were 10 couples in a dance off over several weeks. Millions of votes by postcard came in proving that American Bandstand was a hit. Despite getting over a million votes, Dottie and I came in fourth.”\n\nDJ Dave: Please describe what it was like meeting the Beatles backstage at their first American concert in Washington D.C. on February 11, 1964?\n\nJack: “The Beatles did their famous appearance on the Sullivan Show, Sunday February 9th, 1964. Two days later, the band performed their first live American show in Washington DC. I was doing 7 to midnight DJ shift on WEAM AM, the only 24-hour rocker in Washington. I along with 3 other jocks with other D.C. stations were invited to be at the concert.\n\nThey gave each of us Beatle Wigs and we stood at corners on the stage with the Beatles prior to the show. Backstage before the show we had access to the Beatles. Jack Alex from WEEL and I were talking to John Lennon, who said to us “we hope we can get two years out of this.” Knowing the fickle nature of the music business we replied “we hope so, it’s a tough business.”\n\nDJ Dave: Working with fellow WROV Roanoke DJ Fred Frelantz must have been special? What made your broadcasting partnership flourish over the course of 20 plus years, until the untimely death of Frelantz in 1986?\n\nJack: “On the Fisher and Frelantz DJ partnership: This was a perfect pairing of two radio personalities. We instinctively were on the same page and we both were writers who created memorable bits. Just like the “Bonsack Christmas parade” segment we broadcasted together and is still talked about to this very day. Fred and I were just a great pairing. My friend and partner passed away in a fire during 1986. He was the best!”\n\nDJ Dave: During the summer of 1969, you were part of a legendary DJ staff at WROV, working with Bart Prater, Fred Frelantz and John Cigna. Before leaving the station in 1971, you also worked with Larry Bly and Dan Alexander. How did a small station like WROV attract and keep legendary DJ talent during the golden age of Top 40 radio?\n\nJack: “1969 was a memorable year of course for music and news, men landed on the moon and of course there was Woodstock. The lineup that year at WROV was as good of a DJ staff that was ever assembled for the Roanoke radio market.\n\nJohn Cigna, who came from 50k watt WOWO Fort Wayne, Indiana, held down morning drive. Fred Frelantz was doing mid days, I worked afternoon drive and Bart Prater had the 7 to midnight shift. Come on man, that was entertainment. Why did so many talented DJs like this lineup and later jocks like Larry Bly and Dan Alexander work at WROV? It was Burt Levine, the owner of the station. Burt spotted talent and let it happen.”\n\nDJ Dave: What are two or three events, concerts or remote broadcasts that you participated in while working at WROV, that still are enduring or meaningful to you in 2021?\n\nJack: “During my full-time employment with WROV, I worked at most every event that was sponsored by the station. I had a great time with Beach Boys, Wilson Pickett, and let’s not forget the bomb with Tiny Tim! One of my favorites was the Temptations. After I introduced the Motown vocal group, bass singer Melvin Franklin took my microphone and thanked me for playing “My Girl” at the end of my WROV oldies show every week. That was special.”\n\nDJ Dave: Can you tell me about the class that you have been teaching since 2015 at Furman University about the history of rock and roll?\n\nJack: “Currently I teach a class at Furman’s Life Long Learning class. THE MUSIC AND CULTURE OF THE 60S. During class time, I focus on a different year, discussing the music and major events that happened during that particular year. Each class demonstrates how music and culture influenced each other during the 60s decade.”\n\nAs I have chronicled highlights of Fisher and his important life events, it is clear he has woven a wonderful tapestry of living experiences within the rock and roll genre of music. Fisher’s stories of American Bandstand and the Beatles, as well as eventful radio DJ years with WROV Roanoke are fascinating, interesting and legendary.\n\nListening to WROV and Jack Fisher every afternoon when I was a teen still has a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember Fisher as an excellent DJ during the golden age of Top 40 radio. Without a doubt, Jack Fisher remains a legacy within Roanoke radio history here in the 21st Century.

Each of these Southern California groups were hit makers during the mid to late 60s, with a refreshing brand of music called Sunshine Pop.\n\nWith my latest edition of DJ Dave’s Musical Musings, I will be counting down what I consider to be the best Sunshine Pop Top 40 singles from the 60s decade. My selections were all hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, during the golden age of Sunshine Pop (1965-1969).\n\nWhat is Sunshine Pop? Wikipedia describes the type of rock music as, “cheerful, upbeat music which is characterized by warm sounds, prominent vocal harmonies, lush vocals, light arrangements and sophisticated productions. Rooted in easy listening and advertising jingles, sunshine pop acts combined nostalgic or anxious moods with an appreciation for the beauty of the world.”\n\nOriginating in California during the mid 60s, Sunshine Pop combined segments of folk-rock, soft pop, progressive rock, Baroque pop and Psychedelia. Some tunes in this category are slow grooves, but most songs featured breezy, up-tempo beats.\n\nThe term Sunshine Pop did not exist during the 60s so it is difficult to pin-point an exact beginning to this sub-genre of pop rock music. It appears that Sunshine Pop happened because of multiple musical influences as a wide range of musicians and record producers converged together around Los Angeles, California, during 1965 and 1966.\n\nSome of the more instrumental players in the development of Sunshine Pop include:\n\nThe Beatles and “Beatlemania” permeates America in 1964\n\nBritish Invasion bands other than the Beatles (1964-1965)\n\nFolk rock bands like the Byrds/Roger McGuinn\n\nPhil Spector Wall of Sound record producer\n\nJohn Phillips of the Mamas & the Papas\n\nBrian Wilson of the Beach Boys\n\nPet Sounds album by the Beach Boys\n\nCurt Boettcher Record Producer\n\nThe Wrecking Crew: Los Angeles session musicians\n\nThe Beatles are the most influential band of the rock era and they changed the course of musical history during the 60s. The band’s impact on all types of pop/rock music is legendary and their musical fingerprints are all over what now is called Sunshine Pop. “Good Day Sunshine” from the Beatles “Revolver” album is noteworthy for being influential with the California pop/rock sounds coming out of Los Angeles during this time period.\n\nObviously, the Beatles are not considered a Sunshine Pop band. However, the Fab Four did record similar types of songs during their career. Two examples that come to my mind are George Harrison’s, “Here Comes the Sun” from the Abbey Road album and the 1967 Baroque Pop masterpiece from Paul McCartney, “Penny Lane.”\n\nOne other major influence of Sunshine Pop is the Brian Wilson produced album, “Pet Sounds” by the Beach Boys. Rolling Stone magazine ranks Wilson’s 1966 project as the number one, “greatest rock album of all time.” The album incorporates rock, pop, and jazz with vocal harmonies and is considered a template for the genre of Progressive Rock. “God Only Knows” is a gem from the superb album.\n\nThe peak for the first wave of Sunshine Pop happened during the “Summer of Love” in 1967. Young people flocked by the thousands to the San Francisco, California neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury, searching for peace, love and tranquility. Music played a huge part of this cultural revolution.\n\nDuring the spring of 1967, John Phillips wrote and produced a song called, “San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)” that his friend Scott McKenzie recorded as a single. The song immediately became a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and was an inspiration for those creating Sunshine Pop music in the 60s.\n\nWhile I was researching information for this topic, I found that there were 12 core bands or groups that are associated with Sunshine Pop of the 60s decade:\n\nThe Association\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\nThe Buckinghams\n\nThe Cowsills\n\nGary Lewis & the Playboys\n\nHarpers Bizarre\n\nThe Mamas & the Papas\n\nThe Monkees\n\nSpanky and Our Gang\n\nStrawberry Alarm Clock\n\nThe Turtles\n\nThe Rascals\n\nOf the 12 artists listed above, many of them recorded more than just Sunshine Pop songs. There is much musical diversity among these top pop/rock performers.\n\nThere are also 6 lesser-known Sunshine Pop bands and groups from this time period. These artists tended to have regional hits and didn’t chart high enough on Billboard or Cash Box music charts to become major hits on Top 40 radio during the 60s.\n\nThe Peppermint Rainbow\n\nYellow Balloon\n\nThe Sunshine Company\n\nThe Parade\n\nSagittarius\n\nThe Cherry People\n\nThere are also two other artists and songs that I want to highlight, which are actually Baroque Pop but sound similar to 60s Sunshine Pop:\n\nPretty Ballerina—The Left Banke\n\n98.6—Keith featuring the Tokens\n\nBefore starting the countdown of my 25 best Sunshine Pop singles of the 60s, I want to share information on how I determined my top songs in this category.\n\nWith this article about Sunshine Pop, I am including only American artists who had major hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart between 1965 and 1969. Every song on my countdown peaked at least at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Eleven tunes peaked at number one.\n\nAs I surveyed all the top 40 Sunshine Pop hits from the 60s, I found 25 high quality singles that are on my countdown. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\nI submit to you, my top 25 best Sunshine Pop singles. As Casey Kasem used to say on his weekly American Top 40 show: “Now on with the countdown.”\n\n25. Sunday Will Never Be the Same—Spanky & Our Gang\n\nPeaked at #9 Billboard Hot 100: 1967\n\nDebut single by band. Lead vocals by Elaine “Spanky” McFarlane.
