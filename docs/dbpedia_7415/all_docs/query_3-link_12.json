        "text": "Vicki Peterson (The Bangles) and John Cowsill (The Cowsills, The Beach Boys) will be performing LIVE music at the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall Of Fame (97 Main Street, Stony Brook, NY) on Friday Aug. 9th at 8pm.\n\nFor tickets, visit: https:// longislandmusicandentertainmen thalloffame1.thundertix.com/ events/232446\n\nAbout Vicki Peterson & John Cowsill\n\nVicki Peterson and John Cowsill have been married for 20 years and playing music together for…maybe two.\n\nVicki is a founding member of the 1980’s group The Bangles, one of the most successful bands of that decade. She later wrote and performed with her good friend (and eventual sister-in-law) Susan Cowsill as The Psycho Sisters; the duo soon found themselves absorbed into the New Orleans’ songwriters collective The Continental Drifters and remain with them today. The Bangles reunited in the 21st century to release four more albums, including a collection of rarities, and a collaboration with the Los Angeles bands Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade and the Three O’Clock.\n\nJohn began working in clubs, singing and playing drums with his brothers when he was seven years old. The band grew to include their mother and little sister and The Cowsills became a sensation in the late 1960’s, enjoying several Top 20 hits. In 1981 John did some session work, landing on the Tommy Tutone hit, “867-5309 (Jenny)” and recorded and toured with Dwight Twilley. He also toured with Jan and Dean before becoming a mainstay of the Beach Boys touring band, playing guitar, piano, and finally sitting at the drum kit for over 20 years.\n\nVicki and John, along with their friend actor/musician Bill Mumy recorded three albums as The Action Skulls, including a pandemic-themed bluegrass record and their latest, From A Running Horse, released just this year.\n\nA loving tribute featuring songs written by two of John’s brothers, Bill and Barry Cowsill was recently finished by Vicki and John. Long After the Fire is due for release in early 2025.\n\nWe feel a strong connection to all the Cowsills. One of our inductees, Artie Kornfeld, has written or co-written many of their early hit songs and has produced their early albums. John’s brothers and sister performed and inducted Artie at our induction gala in 2018 which took place at The Space in Westbury. As the drummer in the Cowsills, John has previously played on our very grounds in Stony Brook in the late 1960’s at the legendary outdoor amphitheater Dogwood Hollow as part of the Stony Brook Music Festival."
