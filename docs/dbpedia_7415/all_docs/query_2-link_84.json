        "text": "Clover\n\nListen/Download – Clover – Wade In the Water\n\nGreetings all.\n\nI hope the new week finds you all well.\n\nThe track I bring you this fine day is something very groovy indeed.\n\nThe old spiritual ‘Wade In the Water’ has long been one of my favorite songs, whether presented in its original setting, or interpreted in a wide variety of different ways.\n\nThere are remarkable versions by Graham Bond, the John Bishop Trio, Ramsey Lewis and countless others, mostly working within a soul, R&B or soul jazz context.\n\nIt was only recently that I had my mind blown wide open by a couple of psychedelicized versions from the late 60s/early 70s (you can hear the other one over at Funky16Corners).\n\nI stumbled upon the version you see before you today a while back while searching for info about another version of the song.\n\nThe band Clover was already familiar to me as an early stop in the career of none other than Huey Lewis (he played harmonica with them), featured guitarist John McFee (later of the Doobie Brothers) as well as the band that backed Elvis Costello on ‘My Aim Is True’.\n\nWhat I did not know is that their history went back much further than that.\n\nThe band got their start in 1967, signed with Fantasy records in 1969 and recorded for the first time in 1970.\n\nTheir version of ‘Wade In the Water’, which appeared on their first album (sans Huey Lewis) and on the Australian EP you see before you.\n\nThe basic structure of the song remains intact, with the band adding a dollop of countrified soul, and as soon as the guitar starts soloing, the whole thing takes on that SanFran ballroom, light show, freakout vibe, like a slightly heavier Grateful Dead.\n\nThough the song has a wide variety of interpretations, some purely spiritual, others connected to the Underground Railroad, it has a sound and a structure that are fairly simple, cyclical, and with an element of call and response powerful in an almost physical way.\n\nIf you listen to the wide variety of presentations of ‘Wade In the Water’, both religious and secular, it becomes obvious that no matter how it is played and/or sung, it always manages to retain its form, which is why it works as a capella gospel, and as swirling psychedelia.\n\nClover went on to record a few albums, and after their dissolution, McFee went on to the Doobies, Huey Lewis and Sean Hopper (part of another later line-up) to the News and lead singer Alex Call co-wrote ‘867-5309’ for Tommy Tutone, which probably keeps him rolling in piles of hundred dollar bills to this very day.\n\nI hope you dig the tune (and make sure you check out the version at Funky16Corners) and I’ll see you all next week.\n\nPeace\n\nLarry\n\nPS Head over to Funky16Corners for some soul.\n\nNino Tempo and April Stevens\n\nNino and April on Shivaree, with bagpipes and the T-Bones…\n\nListen/Download – Nino Tempo & April Stevens with the Guilloteens\n\nGreetings all.\n\nReady to have your minds blown?\n\nA couple of years back I grabbed the most excellent Rhino ‘Where the Action Is’ set.\n\nThere was a lot on there that I’d heard (or already had on vinyl) but there was also a grip of absolutely incredible stuff that was new to me.\n\nAmong the tracks that really knocked me back on my heels, was the record you see before you today, ‘I Love How You Love Me’ by Nino Tempo and April Stevens.\n\nI was already a fan of their work, especially their biggest hit, ‘Deep Purple’ (long a fave of mine) but I had no inkling they had anything as game changing as this up their sleeves.\n\nThere was probably a gap of a few years between when I first heard – and fell in love with – the track and when I finally scored the 45.\n\nWhen that hot little biscuit finally fell through the mail slot, I had my mind blown all over again.\n\nRhino set the standards for quality reissues, and the annotation is generally second to none, but the notes in the box set missed a something very interesting in regard to this record.\n\nAs you’ll see when you look at the label, the notes to ‘Where the Action Is’ omitted one crucial detail, that being that the band on the record (credited right there on the label) was none other that the mighty Guilloteens!\n\nThe Guilloteens on Shebang with Casey Kasem\n\nHailing from Memphis, bit having settled in LA for their recording career, the Guilloteens (billed on the 45 as the ‘Guilloteenes’) waxed some incredible 45s for HBR and Columbia, especially the savage ‘Hey You’.\n\nThough he is best known for his performing partnership with his sister, Nino Tempo was also an early associate/acolyte of Phil Spector’s. I have no doubt that his time in the studio with Spector had an influence on this record.\n\nThe word that comes to mind when I think about this record is ‘inspired’.\n\nHow Tempo decided to take the Paris Sisters 1961 hit and toss it into the blender with 1965 folk rock and a fucking set of bagpipes (?!?!), and managed to alchemically take all that incongruity and convert it into just over two and a half minutes of magic is one of the truly remarkable (if obscure) achievements of mid-60s pop.\n\nThere’s just no reason any of this should work, but no matter how many times I listen to this record (and it’s up in the hundreds now) it just keeps sounding better and better.\n\nThe Paris Sisters original was (surprise!) a Phil Spector production. Despite having a melody that at first listen seems syrupy, the record has a cavernous, hypnotic sound.\n\nTempo’s treatment of the tune, re-casting it in a Byrds-y jangle is stunning. He tears the song from its somnambulistic origins, gives it an au-go-go tempo, and even tosses in a little bit of fuzz guitar for the longhairs in the crowd.\n\nBut then, there’s the bagpipes.\n\nI can almost see Tempo, like a bug-eyed mad scientist huddled behind a rack of bubbling test tubes having a eureka moment and pulling a Scotsman out of a sack.\n\nThere’s not a single, logical path from ‘I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better’ to ‘Loch Lomond’, yet the addition of the bagpipes – which Tempo has said were inspired by the modal guitar sound of the Byrds – is pure genius.\n\nInterestingly, Nino and April’s ‘I Love How You Love Me’ went Top 40 in a number of regional markets, and a year later Paul and Barry Ryan copied the arrangement and had a Top 20 hit with the song in the UK.\n\nIt’s a great, great record and one you ought to download and push on your friends as a public service.\n\nI hope you dig it, and I’ll see you next week.\n\nPeace\n\nLarry\n\nPS Head over to Funky16Corners for some soul.\n\nDMZ\n\nListen/Download – DMZ – Out of Our Tree\n\nGreetings all.\n\nThe past month or so has been an especially tasty one in regard to the acquisition of new (old) records, including some long (long, LONG) time want list items (for here and over at Funky16Corners).\n\nIt was during the digimatization process, and plowing through the crates to prep for the next episode of the Iron Leg Radio Show, that I happened upon an especially old record that I had unjustly neglected for years.\n\nFlash back to the very early 80s, and my brothers and I are hanging out in our parents backyard, doing nothing remotely productive, and we happen to hear on the radio that REM were going to be playing that evening at the Capitol Theater in Passaic.\n\nWe rapidly dragged ourselves out of our lawn chairs (without spilling our beer) and hightailed it up to Crazy Eddies.\n\nYou see, back in the olden days, before the computers and the beep-beep, bloop bloop and what not, you used to have to go somewhere special to buy concert tickets, usually Ticketron (anyone remember those rainbow colored tickets?).\n\nThere were a couple of Ticketron outlets nearby, one inside of a Macys department store (?!?) and the other inside Crazy Eddies.\n\nCrazy Eddies was (for those of you too young or too far from the NY area to remember) an appliance/record/tape chain, with lunatic TV commercials, that eventually collapsed under the weight of its founder’s criminal activity.\n\nThough I wouldn’t generally go to Crazy Eddies specifically to buy records (for guys like us it was a place to get stereo equipment and blank tapes), if I’m in a store, and there are records to be had, who am I to look the other way??\n\nSo, we buy our tickets for the show, and I headed over to the “imports” section, where in addition to overpriced French prog rock albums, you could find all kinds of domestic independent label stuff.\n\nThough I can’t be 100% sure, I think this was also the day I grabbed the Vipers Jem/PVC LP, but the real score (though I didn’t know it at the time) was a remaindered copy of a four or five year old release by a band called DMZ.\n\nDMZ, formed in 1976 and dead in the water two years later, is now best known as the band that introduced the world to the charms of Jeff Conolly, aka Mono Mann.\n\nIt was still a few years before I would hear about the Lyres, so that meant nothing at the time, but I did recognize that the album included a cover of the Sonics ‘Cinderella’, so I forked over my 99 cents, and headed home.\n\nWhile my ears were still stuffed full of sweet, power pop/new wave candy, I had started to develop a taste for punk (zee raw, seexteez zound) and DMZ brought it.\n\nI found myself dropping the needle on the opning track, ‘Mighty Idy’ a lot, but the cut that really rattled my cage is the one you see before you today, a cover of the Wailers 1966 slammer ‘Out of Our Tree’.\n\nThe importance of the damp, depressing Pacific Northwest to the development of punk, 60s and beyond cannot be underestimated.\n\nBands like the Kingsmen, the Sonics, Don and the Goodtimes, and Paul Revere and the Raiders all made awesome sounds (some, like the Sonics far beyond awesome), but the mighty Wailers were there first.\n\nThe group had their first hit with ‘Tall Cool One’ in 1959 (again in 1964), and over the next few years their R&B/frat sound morphed in sometimes savage garage punk.\n\n‘Out of Our Tree’ was released in 1966 and it is one of those records that wears the era like a badge of honor.\n\nYou get pounding drums, combo organ, fuzzed out guitars and wailing (of course) vocals, and the overall effect is powerful enough to shoot grandma out of her chair like a roman candle.\n\nConolly, one of the great rock and roll maniacs and a devoted record collector brought his love of 60s punk to DMZ, and the result was very cool indeed.\n\nNow, if you were to set to Googling, you would discover that there is something of a critical consensus out there which suggests that the DMZ album suffers from sub-par production by Flo and Eddie.\n\nI am here to tell you that this is bunk.\n\nWhether this is a case of “I don’t think it sounds punk (read, INEPT) enough!” or “I love the Lyres and this doesn’t sound enough like the Lyres!” I can’t say for sure, though both schools of thought seem to be in play.\n\nHaving been around then, I fully understand the tendency to associate clean, professional production with ‘the man’ and loosey goosey indie 45s recorded in a basement somewhere to be the ne plus ultra, but as is often the case, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nI would suggest getting yourself a copy of the album (or just download the MP3 here), and turn it the fuck up.\n\nThe production is right on the money for 1978. DMZ sound like an era-appropriate punk band and Flo and Eddie gave the bass and drums (especially the drums) quite a bit of sonic punch.\n\nJeff is solidly savage, and while the organ could be a tiny bit louder, it is there, and you’d have to be a fool to deny that DMZ does the Wailers proud.\n\nNot long after DMZ imploded, Conolly, Rick Corraccio and Paul Murphy went on to form the Lyres, one of the greatest live bands of the 1980s and beyond.\n\nAs always, I hope you dig the sounds, and I’ll see you next week.\n\nPeace\n\nLarry\n\nPS Head over to Funky16Corners for some soul."
