        "text": "Roy Orbisonâ€™s vocals backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nRoy Orbisonâ€™s sons – Roy Jr., Wesley and Alex – have done much to preserve and expand their fatherâ€™s legacy. Theyâ€™ve overseen reissues of Roy Orbisonâ€™s MGM catalog and an expanded thirtieth anniversary version of the Black and White Night concert film, released the first-ever issue of 1969 album One of the Lonely Ones, and wrote a new biography. Their latest offering grafts classic Orbison vocals onto new, classical arrangements, multiplying the vocalistâ€™s operatic flights with the power of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. This is producer Nick Patrickâ€™s third such creation, having pioneered this concept with Elvis Presleyâ€™s If I Can Dream and The Wonder of You.\n\nAlthough there is certainly a marketing angle to this release, there is also a great deal of thought in the conception and artistry, and the execution rises well above pure commercialism. The strings of Orbisonâ€™s original hits pointed the way, and these full orchestral arrangements fill out the emotional images drawn by Orbisonâ€™s soaring vocals. Patrickâ€™s arrangers have studied the original records and leveraged many of their percussion and melodic motifs. The results remain familiar while also feeling freshened up; they donâ€™t always have the raw impact of Fred Fosterâ€™s original productions, but neither do they stray so far away as to lose the connection.\n\nSome tracks fare better than others. The intro to â€œItâ€™s Overâ€ offers hold-your-breath drama, â€œRunning Scaredâ€ reaffirms the songâ€™s basis in Ravelâ€™s â€œBolero,â€ and expanded strings on â€œBlue Angelâ€ and â€œLove Hurtsâ€ add lushness and power to the originals. On the other hand, â€œOh, Pretty Womanâ€ seems to diminish the originalâ€™s wonder and yearning, and the vocal on â€œDream Babyâ€ doesnâ€™t quite sit in the pocket. Later material is given ELO-styled rock treatment thatâ€™s less effective than Jeff Lynneâ€™s original productions. As with most covers projects, this one wonâ€™t have you tossing out your singles and albums, but for fans whoâ€™ve listened to these songs a thousand times, itâ€™s nice to hear something new in the familiar. [Â©2017 Hyperbolium]\n\nRoy Orbisonâ€™s Home Page\n\nLavish expansion of 1968 and 1970 Woody Guthrie tribute concerts\n\nBear Familyâ€™s lavish three CD, two book set collects material from two live tribute shows, featuring performances by Arlo Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Bob Dylan (his first appearance after his motorcycle accident), Odetta, Joan Baez, Richie Havens, Jack Elliott, Country Joe McDonald, Tom Paxton and Earl Robinson, along with narration from actors Robert Ryan, Will Geer and Peter Fonda. The first tribute included an afternoon/evening pair of concerts staged at Carnegie Hall in 1968, the second tribute was staged at the Hollywood Bowl in 1970. Material from both tributes was released in edited, collated and resequenced form on a pair of 1972 LPs, Part 1 on Columbia and Part 2 on Warner Brothers, and eventually reissued on CD and MP3.\n\nIn honor of the fiftieth anniversary of Guthrieâ€™s passing, Bear Family has gathered all of the extant concert materials – including the entire Hollywood Bowl concert – to recreate the original, scripted concerts by adding back narration and musical performances that were elided from the LPs, and adding in interview clips that shed light on Guthrie and the productions. The three CDs are fitted into the back cover of a 160-page hardbound book that overflows with photos, essays, press clippings, remembrances, artist and production staff biographies, ephemera, notes on production, recording and filming, a discography, a bibliography and a filmography. The book is housed in a heavy-duty slipcase alongside a reproduction of the 1972 volume, The TRO Woody Guthrie Concert Book, which itself includes photos, sheet music, and song notes from Guthrie and Millard Lampell. All together, the package weighs in at over five pounds!\n\nLampellâ€™s script for the shows threads together Guthrieâ€™s songs and autobiographical writing, Lampellâ€™s script tells Guthrieâ€™s story through the people he met, the stories he sang and the musicians he influenced. Highlights of the New York shows include Will Geerâ€™s knowing tone in describing his longtime comrade, the then-recently minted starlight of Arlo Guthrie shining on his fatherâ€™s â€œOklahoma Hills,â€ the sound of Pete Seegerâ€™s banjo and his physical embodiment of the folk movementâ€™s hard-fought roots, and Tom Paxtonâ€™s mournful â€œPastures of Plenty.â€ Dylanâ€™s band-based triptych stands apart from the more traditional folk arrangements of his castmates, and shows the directions heâ€™d been developing during his eighteen month hiatus.\n\nFor all the camaraderie and good feelings of the Carnegie shows, they werenâ€™t without controversy, as Phil Ochsâ€™ snub led to the deeply bitter feelings recounted in his interview. Ochsâ€™ was particularly critical of Judy Collins and Richie Havens, the latter of whom had only then recently released his debut and performed at Woodstock. But Ochsâ€™ recriminations were misplaced, as both artists commune with Guthrieâ€™s legacy; Collinsâ€™ embrace of â€œPlane Wreck At Los Gatos (Deportee)â€ is tear inducing, and Havensâ€™ slow, rhythmic performance of â€œVigilante Manâ€ is hypnotic. The show closed with the cast singing Guthrieâ€™s alternate national anthem, â€œThis Land is Your Land,â€ sending the audience out to share Guthrieâ€™s music with the world.\n\nThe Los Angeles show largely repeated the script from New York, with Peter Fonda replacing Robert Ryan in the co-narrator chair, and Arlo Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Odetta, Jack Elliott and Richie Havens newly joined by Joan Baez, Country Joe McDonald, Earl Robinson and a house band that included Ry Cooder. Dylanâ€™s semi-electric set felt like an outlier among the acoustic arrangements of 1968, but by 1970, the house band is heard throughout much of the Hollywood Bowl program. Stretching the songs further from their acoustic origins emphasizes their their continued relevance as artistic and social capital. The band-backed songs also provide contrast to acoustic numbers such as Baez and Seegerâ€™s audience sing-a-long â€œSo Long, It’s Been Good To Know Yuh.â€\n\nBaez sings both â€œHobo’s Lullabyâ€ with empathy and tenderness, and the bandâ€™s support on Odettaâ€™s â€œRamblinâ€™ Roundâ€ inspires a looser performance than she gave in New York. Country Joe McDonald, who began his solo career the year before with Thinking of Woody Guthrie, sings a rousing version of â€œPretty Boy Floydâ€ and provides original music for the previously unrecorded Guthrie lyric â€œWoman at Home.â€ Woody Guthrieâ€™s performance style echoed most strongly in Ramblinâ€™ Jack Elliottâ€™s â€œ1913 Massacre,â€ and placed back-to-back with Arlo Guthrieâ€™s blues-rock take on â€œDo Re Mi,â€ highlights how amendable the songs are to reinvention.\n\nThe Los Angeles recording is more detailed than the tapes made from the house system in New York, and though itâ€™s musically rich, with Guthrieâ€™s passing two years further in the past, it doesnâ€™t feel as urgent as the earlier shows. Disc three is filled out with interview clips that shed light on Guthrie and the tribute concerts. As Arlo Guthrie recounts in interview, and Lampell echoes in his opening essay, Guthrie had developed a legacy in the â€˜30s and â€˜40s, but it was the folk revival that really cemented his popular artistic immortality. The tribute concerts consolidated the discovery of the revival, acknowledging the original context in which Guthrie wrote, and renewing his songsâ€™ significance by highlighting their ongoing relevance to then-current issues. The shows employed the folk tradition as stagecraft.\n\nThe interview segments are interesting for their mix of accurate and misremembered moments. Arlo Guthrie remembers the New York shows as benefits for the Guthrie children, when they were actually fundraisers for the newly formed Huntington Chorea organization. Rick Robbins remembers Dylan having been an unannounced surprise guest, when his role was actually advertised beforehand. This set is deluxe, even by Bear Familyâ€™s uniquely high standards, but it rests comfortably on two memorable concerts. Those seeking only a taste of the concerts might check out the CD reissue of the original concert albums. But for a fully immersive experience, this two-book, three-CD set is a welcome gift for the holidays. [Â©2017 Hyperbolium]\n\nWoody Guthrie Website\n\nA Cowsill, Barnes and Bangle band together\n\nAction Skullâ€™s principals – John Cowsill, Billy Mumy, Vicki Peterson and Rick Rosas – each have extensive show business resumes. Cowsill began his music career in his familyâ€™s eponymous band, played with Dwight Twilley and Tommy Tutone, and plays drums as part of the Beach Boys touring band. Mumy started out in television and film before breaking into the music industry with Barnes & Barnes, worked with America and Rick Springfield, and records solo albums. Peterson rose to fame with the Bangles, and subsequently played with the Continental Drifters and Psycho Sisters alongside her sister-in-law Susan Cowsill. Rosas, who passed away in 2014, was a sought-after Los Angeles studio musician who played with Neil Young (including reunions of Crazy Horse, CSN&Y and Buffalo Springfield), Joe Walsh, Johnny Rivers and others.\n\nThe bandâ€™s genesis dates to 2013, when Cowsill, Peterson and Mumy met and sang together at a party. Mumy introduced Rosas into the mix a few days later, and quickly began writing new material for the quartet. Collaboration and demos were soon followed by live sessions at ReadyMix Music, a studio that has hosted Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon and other L.A. luminaries. The group describes their music as â€œcanyon rock,â€ and that â€˜70s vibe rings through the psych-tinged guitars and three part harmonies, but their sound isnâ€™t nostalgic. Rosas death in November 2014 put the eight finished tracks on the back burner as the three remaining Skulls returned to their individual careers. But they knew they had something, and they knew that Rosas performances should be heard. So they recorded three more tracks with Mumy and John Cowsillâ€™s son Will on bass.\n\nThe finished collection includes both solo and group vocals, often swapping within a song, and songwriting collaborations that give the album variety, but with a real group sound. The album opens with the Revolver-ish â€œMainstream,â€ with each vocalist taking a turn up front and banding together on harmonies. Several of the songs wander into imagined worlds. â€œIn the Futureâ€ wonders what our bad habits will look like in hindsight, and â€œIf I See You in Another Worldâ€ ponders the strength of a relationship freed of its current context. Relationships figure into many songs, as the album considers physical and hypothetical separation with warm looks homeward and lonely gazes outward. Whether this is a one-off or turns into an on-going project, itâ€™s a terrific artifact of four accomplished artists coming together to make music. [Â©2017 Hyperbolium]\n\nAction Skullsâ€™ Home Page\n\nPeter Caseâ€™s on-stage magic from 1998 and 2000\n\nPeter Case has had a music career that few of his contemporaries can match. Breaking in with Jack Lee and Paul Collins as the Nerves, no one would have guessed it was the beginning of a musical road thatâ€™s now stretched more than forty years. Caseâ€™s second band, the Plimsouls, garnered a major label contract, tours and an appearance in Valley Girl, but this too ended up as prelude to a solo career launched by his eponymous 1986 album. Unlike the rock â€˜nâ€™ roll of his earlier bands, his solo work – both on record and in performance – put a greater focus on his songwriting, and itâ€™s that songwriting thatâ€™s highlighted in these tracks taken from live radio performances in 1998 and 2000.\n\nBoth performances are drawn from Caseâ€™s appearances on KPFKâ€™s FolkScene. The earlier set highlights material from Caseâ€™s Full Service, No Waiting, while the latter set combines material from Flying Saucer Blues and earlier releases, and adds covers of Mississippi John Hurt and Charlie Poole. Both sets were engineered by FolkSceneâ€™s resident engineer, Peter Cutler, and sparkle with the showâ€™s warmth and Caseâ€™s creativity. Case is joined by the Full Service album band for the 1998 set, and by violinist David Perales for the later tracks.\n\nAt 40, Case was thinking deeply about the path from his childhood to his present. The title track is filled with the memories an ex-pat relishes in revisiting his hometown, while â€œSee Through Eyesâ€ laments the incursion of doubt that middle age brings. Case remembers his San Francisco years in â€œGreen Blanket (Part 1)â€ and â€œStill Playinâ€™,â€ and explores the roots of his rambling in the acoustic â€œCrooked Mile.â€ The first set closes with the adolescently hopeful â€œUntil the Next Time,â€ while the second set opens in a more present frame of mind with â€œSomething Happens.â€ Two years on, Case was still remembering notable moments from his past, but also looking forward.\n\nThe songs easily fit the band setting, but the starker guitar-and-violin arrangements of the second set provide Caseâ€™s singing and lyrics a more intense spotlight. He slips easily into the acoustic picking of Mississippi John Hurtâ€™s â€œPay Dayâ€ and wears the lyric with a familiarity that belies its mid-60s origins. Case moves easily between blues and folk, and Parales violin provides moody underlines, rapidly bowed sparks and intricate, emotional accompaniment, highlighted by his ornamental line on â€œBeyond the Blues.â€ Peter Cutlerâ€™s recording is clean and unaffected, and presents Case as you might expect to hear him in a club or on a street corner, with his musical magic at full power. [Â©2017 Hyperbolium]\n\nPeter Caseâ€™s Home Page\n\nAn Americana biography of romantic dissolution\n\nA West Texan singer-songwriter named after Kris Kristofferson has a lot to live up to. But thereâ€™s a soulfulness in Phillipsâ€™ voice, the sort you hear on deep Van Morrison tracks, and a redemptive faith in his songs that suggests Bruce Springsteen. His album ponders the end of a relationship, and though written in the first person, the stories are biographical rather than autobiographical. The split viewpoint lends a philosophical angle that musters a friendâ€™s pain and outrage from an observational angle. The songs battle the lethargy of aftermath, ponder second chances to end things cruelly, and find their way to forgive and move on to what could be renewal. â€œHad Enoughâ€ opens the album with a moment of realization that signals the oncoming emotional thaw. A growing understanding of just how unraveled heâ€™d become leads to confession and confrontation as he begs for reaction, castigates himself and looks for an exit.\n\nPhillips finds out that letting go sometimes turns out to be harder than remaining unhappy, as neither the conventions of â€œRom Comâ€ nor the rebound of â€œ18 Year Old Girlsâ€ prove to be a sustainable escape from real world endings. The latter features a terrific neo-psychedelic guitar coda that suggests Television playing Americana, and elsewhere the album explores country, gospel, and in the closing â€œHock the Horses,â€ a Latin rhythm. Gordy Quistâ€™s production balances guitar sustain with deep bass notes and gently shuffling drums, pushing Phillips ever-so-slightly forward in the mix to emphasize his emotional isolation and personalize his plight. The crucible of a failed relationship leaves scars on the tested, but even one step removed, the sparks of recrimination and salve of forgiveness make for intensely revealing stories.
