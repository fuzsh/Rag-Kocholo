It's pretty obvious to me that this is the way to do history now, with the essentially unlimited storage capacities of our computers and our interconnectedness. I read a short story once about aliens among us foiling human attempts to band together to bring large projects to fruition so that we don't get too advanced. I sure don't have any better theory.\n\nIn November 2005 I bid $2 on a stack of teen magazines at the auction at Spence's Bazaar in Dover, Delaware. I suppose I got about $1 worth of fun out of them, so, to not take a loss, I'm putting the Beatle mentions on the web.

Flat, Jerry Loudmouth, the Jerry Blah Fat show, or how a loudmouth D.J. gets a tv show of his own. How did it happen? . . . It sure is a mystery. . . . But who are we to say that loudmouth D.J. shows are on the way out? . . .\n\nIf you want honest-heavy radio where you can hear the Moonglows, and gospel and the cuts on the British Jimi Hendrix album, or jazz or entire albums - write to HP [Hit Parader]. If you really dug the SGT. PEPPER album, you must be bored to tears with your local jock-yock radio shows.\n\nWrite us letters telling us what changes you want and we'll see that they get into the right hand. . . . Just remember that pop music radio exists only because you listen to it. - jim delehant\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 8.\n\nWe Read Your Mail\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . First of all, I'm far from being \"anti-Stones\", but this LP really has my personal Yech Award. THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST is the greatest mishmash of sounds ever put on wax. . . .\n\nThe Stones could have done so much better if they had not tried so obviously to top SGT. PEPPER'S. Such far-out sounds could be expected of some psychedelic groups, but the Stones are out of their bag on these things. Any comparison between MAJESTIES and SGT. PEPPER'S would be little short of sacrilege.\n\nIt would seem that the only groups prepared to progress to \"programmed\" music are the Beatles (of course), the Mothers, and perhaps the Beach Boys (whose SMILEY SMILE was almost great). . . . - Tom Altizer; Tazewell, Va.\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . Sure, I love the Beatles and other groups, but I think a lot of people who put down the Monkees are being unfair. The Monkees never asked to be a group, so how can people say, \"The Monkees are trying to be another Beatles\"? The Monkees and Beatles are two entirely different groups with entirely different sounds. . . . - Audrey Fulton; Newball, Calif.\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . I am not a Beatles fan, but I constantly hear criticism of them as musicians and songwriters. They are obviously excellent in both fields. I listen to a lot of jazz guitarists and a great deal of their albums include compositions by Lennon-McCartney. It seems senseless to me that someone would criticize such talented people because they aren't appealing to them. . . . - Andrew Evanoff; Kenosha, Wisconsin\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . I'm glad the Rolling Stones changed their style. Their new album is a gas, so is the new Beatles'; but it's not as good as SGT. PEPPER. . . . - Judi Slandi; Philadelphia, Pa.\n\nDear Editor:\n\nWith the end of 1967 came the release of the second Beatle album of the year, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR - a soundtrack album from the Beatle-produced television film of the same name. The film's plotless story line is concerned with the turning of an ordinary bus trip into a very mystical and wonderful event. . . .\n\nNearly all of the songs on the album employ sound effects or tapes slowed down or played backwards, creating a weird effect in some cases and realism in another. The bus sounds in the title tune make one feel as if one was right in a bus terminal. . . .\n\nInstead of talking about all the songs in this letter, I'd much rather suggest that everybody go out and buy it. . . . I personally feel it is every bit as good as SGT. PEPPER. . . . Thank you, Beatles. . . . - Mike Kushner; Peel Village, Brampton, Ont., Canada\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 17,52.\n\nTHE RHYTHM OF ROCK\n\nIn today's kaleidoscopic world of rock, probably the most standardized thing is the rhythm. Lyrics, instrumentation, and singing style in rock are as varied as those in any other form of music. But about 90% of today's rock, from I Am The Walrus to Boogaloo Down Broadway, is tied together by the same rhythmic concept. Four heavy beats to the bar, 1 2 3 4, with lighter beats coming right in the middle of the spaces between the heavy ones - 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. Musicians call it \"straight time.\" . . .\n\nThe development of the electric bass was no instantaneous process either. The first groups to use it - Negro R&B bands as well as white instrumental groups - used it only in the most rudimentary fashion, duplicating the square parts that had been played on the acoustic bass since the beginning, or doubling guitar parts sometimes. But gradually people began to see its possibilities. . . .\n\nFor the rock world as a whole, there is no doubt that the most influential modern bass player is Paul McCartney. McCartney can take credit not only for establishing a cogent musical style on the instrument, but also for bringing it up to the \"front line,\" making it equal to the guitar in prominence. Visually as well as musically, McCartney provided the first inspiration for at least half the electric bass players going today. . . .\n\nIn the past couple of years, many musicians who have experimented widely and wildly with harmony, lyrics and tone have, however, been content to go along with the standard groove, rhythmically; the need to play for dancing has definitely been a factor here. But other groups have begun to crack the time barrier - at least occasionally. The Mothers of Invention especially, and the Beatles (on Within You Without You, for instance.) . . . - barry hansen\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 22.\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES - On A Satanic Subject\n\n. . . On a table [in Mick Jagger's apartment] are a pile of stereo cartridges for his car by artists like the Beatles, Ravi Shankar and the Temptations.\n\nA young man with shiny hair and friendly face is using the phone. He is Glyn Johns who is a pop star in Spain and the Rolling Stone's sound engineer in England, or wherever they may record. . . .\n\nThe idea of the album title, THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST, was Mick's, taken as a corruption from page 2 of a British passport which reads, \"Her Britannic Majesty... requests and requires, etc.\" . . .\n\nWill they attempt a film of their own in the same manner as the Beatles have with Magical Mystery Tour?\n\n\"We've never been a four-headed monster in the same sense that the Beatles have - there was very little unified purpose about the Rolling Stones. We're just five people who come together to make records.\" . . .\n\nIs Mick at all worried that the content of the present album may be too far advanced for many of the Stones' fans. . .?\n\n\"No. There are lots of easy things to listen to, like Sing This Song Altogether. As an album I don't think it's as far out as SERGEANT PEPPER. It's primarily an album to listen to, but I don't feel people will think we've gone totally round the bend because of that.\" . . .\n\nAfter the recording [in the BBC Top Gear studio] I had a few words with Brian. . .\n\n\"Yes, of course, the album is a very personal thing,\" agreed Brian. \"But the Beatles are just as introspective.\" . . . - keith altham\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 26.\n\nThe Nonstop\n\nPETE TOWNSHEND\n\n. . . \"As the Stones begin to lose their surface aggressions it becomes more apparent where their ideas come from. They've never had any ideas!\" Pete exclaimed. \"They've always been borrowed or stolen. 'Satisfaction' came from 'Nowhere To Run' by Martha and the Vandellas. They told me. The same with 'Last Time'. It was a Staple Singers song. Yet they say that they wrote it.\n\n\"Their ideas have always been very obviously inspired by other people, and yet they've been one of my biggest influences. They've probably influenced me even more than the Beatles.\" . . .\n\n\"One of the groups that make it a point to go around and see groups and allow groups to influence them, even though they're way above it, is the Beatles. And yet Eric Burdon put them down rigidly the other day when I was talking to him.\" . . .\n\nPete believes that what is happening now is that people in pop music who really work on their records are becoming that kind of pillar [like classical music became]. The San Francisco groups, The Beach Boys, the Beatles . . . are reaching the paramount height and raising their music to the level of an art form.\n\n\"Everyone else is just selling albums,\" he said. . . . - don paulsen\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 35.\n\nMUSIC SPOTLIGHT\n\n. . . / The whole idea behind the term \"Beautiful People\" is nauseating. / Yech Award goes to It's A Gas by The Hombres. Best Record is I Am The Walrus by The Beatles.\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 44.\n\nPROCOL HARUM Opens Up\n\nRobin Trower & Barry Wilson\n\nRobin Trower has a face like a punchy boxer who stepped into the ring once too often. . . .\n\n\"I've always known I would make it. If I didn't believe this I couldn't go on. Look, five and six years ago we were playing James Brown stuff, and before the Beatles came we were doing all that gear; it broke big and we just got left behind. I'm twenty-two and I've been playing since I was fourteen. I've been a full-time musician since I left school.\" . . .\n\n\"I'm B. J. [Barry J. Wilson] I'm a drummer. Twenty years old. . . .\n\nBarry seeks respect from the other members of the group. What they say and think matters to him. Who does he respect? \"The Beatles, that's the obvious one. Oh, it's too varied to say. I personally respect Ravi Shankar, B.B. King, Dionne Warwick... I could go on forever.\" . . . - francis gaye\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 46.\n\nGRANNY'S GOSSIP\n\nHi! I have lots of news about the Beatles and a whole bunch of other people, so let's get on with it... George Harrison finally has a solo movie assignment. He's writing the sound track music for \"Wonderwall\", a British movie directed by a friend of his, Joe Massot... The Beatles \"Magical Mystery Tour\" got poor reviews from tv critics in England but the average person (none other than Person Belgrade) said that \"their enthusiasm far outshines the show's slight amateurism.\" . . . The Beatle-owned boutique, The Apple, is doing a swell business and the boys are thinking of starting a chain of stores selling hippie clothes, jewelry, records, books and psychedelic stuff. They're also considering a chain of nightclubs. . . . John Lennon's books were adapted for stage by England's National Theatre. One person (not Belgrade) who saw the show reported that \"some people were in hysterics - but not many.\" . . . Warning: Don't be fooled by the little gold sticker on the latest Mitch Ryder album that reads \"Contains complete uncut version of What Now, My Love.\" The album version doesn't contain any dirty words or anything. It's simply fifty seconds longer than the version that was played on radio a few months ago. . . . I'll bet you were wondering when I was going to get around to mentioning the Monkees... There, I've mentioned them. . . . Paul McCartney and Jane Asher took a holiday in Scotland.\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 51.\n\nLONNIE MACK\n\nFour Years After \"Memphis\"\n\nHP: \"Memphis\", your one big record, has kept you going ever since 1963.\n\nLonnie: Yeah, we've been going ever since, touring all over. . . .\n\nHP: What do you think of the Beatles?\n\nLonnie: I think they're real good. I don't especially care for their overall sound, but they write beautiful songs. Yesterday was an excellent piece of material but I think Sam and Dave did it best.\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 55.\n\nTHE LEFT BANKE\n\nFour young men who have become trademarked by a big, well-produced sound, the Left Banke, see the growing size of pop music orchestrations and productions as leading pop music to new acceptance in circles that never before paid attention to teen-oriented sounds. . . .\n\nBass player Tom Finn explained, \"Pop music still has its own characteristics that set it apart from classical or folk... or opera. But it's starting to take ideas from all of these. The Beatles are starting to write numbers that are almost like symphonies. I hear the Who is experimenting with a teenage opera. Our own numbers take a lot from the Baroque and classical musical periods.\" . . . - ken schaffer\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 56.\n\nA BEATLE ENGINEER\n\n. . . It was the Rolling Stones who turned them [the Beatles] on to one of the best recording studios in Britain. At Olympic Sound . . . Keith Grand and Eddie Kramer hold sway over the control panel. Some time ago they had the pleasure of working with John, Paul, Ringo and George on All You Need Is Love and Baby, You're A Rich Man. Here Eddie recalls it like it was.\n\nWhen we did Baby, the whole track was completed that same night, mixed and everything, and voices put on. This is very unusual for them because they normally take two or three days to do a track. . . .\n\nBaby didn't have the bass on the first time around; they dub it on later, which seems quite a clever way of working.\n\nThen John - when we were doing this track he was actually in the control room with a microphone, so that he could sing the lyrics to the others in the studio. To edge them on he used to say, jokingly, \"come on, Beatle people,\" which had everyone in stitches! It was very sweet.\n\nOn that track, all those backwards-sounding effects you hear are not really backwards things. . . . Various instruments were all played live in the studio and by trickery we've got it to sound backwards. . . . If you overdrive the compresser . . . it can make them sound backwards. . . .\n\nTowards the end of Baby we use a special sound effect where you have a very wavery piano note that keeps on cropping up. That's an Olympic Sound special! At the end of the session, all the engineers ended up playing percussion of some kind. You can hear it on the record. . . .\n\nThey come in and they kick it [their song] about in the studio and, once they've got their basic sound, they say, \"OK, let the tapes roll\" and we just let 'em roll for about half an hour. When they record, they count themselves in, and when they get to the end, they go, \"One, two, three, four,\" back to the top again - no break. . . . On the last take, on the four-track master of All You Need, it just goes on and on.\n\nAll You Need was done basically for a television program for which we laid down the backing track. George played violin, Paul played Spike Heatley's five-string bass, which he picked up in the studio, George Martin played piano and John played harpsichord. . . . What I found out, first of all, is that whenever one of them writes a song, he'll take charge of the session. In this case it was John, with a lot of advice from Paul.\n\nThey take charge completely, but George Martin is the one who interprets their ideas. . . . Without a doubt, he really is the fifth Beatle. . . . The string things [arranged by George Martin] on All You Need, for example. They were a follow-up from what George was doing on the violin. . . .\n\nThey really are great musicians. Take Ringo, for instance: his sound just happens. You just stick a mike in front of him and you don't have to equalize the sound or anything. It's the same with Paul's bass. You just put a mike in front of the bass and it's there; you don't have to alter the sound at all. . . . - valerie wilmer\n\nHit Parader, May 1968, page 58.\n\nMY Favorite Records\n\nBy Otis Redding\n\n(Otis gave us this information several months before he was killed.)\n\nOne of my favorite albums is REVOLVER by the Beatles. I love the way they do Yesterday. . . . [Sam Cooke] really knocked me out the way he did Try A Little Tenderness. . . . But Yesterday is my all-time favorite. I also like Day Tripper by the Beatles. . . .\n\n*** HIT PARADER, July 1968 ***\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 6.\n\nthe scene\n\nRESULTS OF THE POLL\n\nTen years ago we ran a popularity poll. Remember? Of course not. However, we finally got around to tabulating all two million six hundred and seventy-eight ballots . . .\n\nThere was a tremendous amount of confusion in the Dream band category . . . The other winners in the dream band were Dizzie Gillespie - accordion, Jim McGuinn - name dropping, Mia Farrow - best guru, Everett Dirksen - best fuzz-box, Pete Townshend - best 12-string roll-on . . . - jim delehant\n\n[I included that for the Mia Farrow/guru side-slapper. DS]\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 14.\n\nExperiences With THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE\n\n. . . A record reviewer submitted the following review to his editor:\n\n\"The best part of the new Jimi Hendrix album 'Axis - Bold As Love\" is the startling double-fold cover. More lavish and audacious than the Sgt. Pepper cover, it depicts Jimi and his two musical companions as a 20-armed tattooed Hindu god . . . \"\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 17.\n\nTHE ROCK REVOLUTION\n\nKIND OF A DRAG\n\n. . . The gravest mistake being made is to treat their [Buckley, Cohen and Arlo Guthrie-type \"bards\"] music as a \"Movement\". There is simply an insufficient number of honestly creative people in the pop field to place the music on such a high pedestal. In the wake of the enormous popularity enjoyed by very nondescript groups it becomes embarrassing to state that there are perhaps a dozen or so names that deserve praise. (Some of them: Dylan, the Beatles, the Stones, Beach Boys, Mothers of Invention, Butterfield, Ray Charles, the Memphis Sound, Tim Hardin, Aretha Franklin, and a few more we never hear about, either because they don't comb their hair the right way or because they do not enjoy the services of a good press agent.) . . . - juan rodriguez\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 28.\n\nYOUNG RASCALS\n\nThe Continuing Story\n\nOn our latest album, \"Once Upon A Dream,\" we have done so many things because we feel there are no limits anymore, thanks to people like the Beatles. They opened up the door to so much variety. First of all, if it wasn't for the Beatles, there would be no groups. They've opened up the lyrical sense of songs and now they've opened up the musical sense. Now there are no barriers or limits.\n\nIf something is done differently and in good taste, it's appreciated by a lot of people. That includes the teenyboppers, too. . . . When they dig something like \"I Am The Walrus,\" that proves how far their taste has come.\n\nWhen we're doing a song that I have written, I like to keep a Rascal flavor in there. . . . If people hear the song on the radio, they will identify with the Rascals, and they will know us, because we have our trademark just like the Spoonful, Beatles or Stones. . . .\n\nThere's an Indian song that Felix plays sitar on. He's become quite a sitar player. . . . He's quite friendly with Ravi Shankar, who probably showed him some things. It's astonishing because he only got the sitar a short while ago . . .\n\nI like horns to emphasize a point on a song, not to fill up a record and make it sound like all horns. The Beatles use horns in a very nice way. . . .\n\nEveryday we learn something new musically. What we learn, we put on the record, and this might teach other people what we've learned. Just like the Beatles have done. . . .\n\nOur manager, Sid Bernstein, is the greatest man in the world. He booked the Beatles at Shea Stadium, he's had the Stones, Hermits, D.C.5. But, we're his group. We're like one organization.\n\nIt was very exciting for our organization to do something as big as the Madison Square Garden concert in New York. It was the biggest concert given since the Beatles at Shea Stadium. . . .\n\nWhat we want to do now is project an album as a whole medium of entertainment for us. Listening to a Rascals album will be like going to a Rascals' concert. This is how we want to make it. \"Sgt. Pepper\" is like listening to an evening with the Beatles.\n\nWe hope to have an annual Christmas show. . . . - gene [cornish] and jim\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 28.\n\nWORDS TO YOUR FAVORITE HITS\n\nLady Madonna\n\n(As recorded by The Beatles/Capitol)\n\nLennon\n\nMcCartney\n\nLady Madonna children at your feet . . .\n\nThe Inner Light\n\n(As recorded by The Beatles/Capitol)\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nWithout going out of my door . . .\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 35.\n\npictures I hear by Brigitta\n\nI'm not going to be ashamed to admit that I have fallen in love with the Bee Gees. . . .\n\n\"The Earnest of Being George\", as its title tells us, quite intentionally sounds like the Beatles in 1965 - (\"Run For Your life\"). . . .\n\n\"Birdie Told Me\" is an immensely attractive little song with the shuffling Music Hall quality of the Beatles' \"Your Mother Should Know\"; although \"Birdie Told Me\" is a more cosmopolitan song . . .\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 42.\n\nInside THE BEE GEES\n\nMeet Vince Melouney\n\nHis first chart success came with a group called the Vibratones. At this time the progressives on the Australian scene, Vince among them, were looking towards England for their inspiration.\n\n\"We got a couple of English lads into the group, a singer, a rhythm guitarist, and they brought over English ideas. This was when the Beatles were just getting big and we did a lot of their numbers.\" . . .\n\nSuccess was to come, however, when Vince joined a group called Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs who don't mean a light here but in Australia notched up a total of seven No. 1 hits.\n\nThe group had the distinction of knocking \"Ticket To Ride\" from the No. 1 spot while the Beatles were over there . . . - nick logan\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 44.\n\nTHE NORTHWEST ROCK SCENE\n\nFrom the Northwest came the best-selling record artist of all time, still far ahead of the pursuing Beatles... and that would be Bing Crosby. . . .\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 46.\n\ngranny's gossip\n\nThe Beatles are expected to begin their full-length movie in late summer or early autumn. I hope so. . . . Bob [Dylan] has continued to remain in hiding. He hasn't even attended a Gabby Hayes Fan Club meeting in almost two years. . . . The Young Rascals didn't want, and fortunately didn't receive, much publicity about their taking Swami Satchidananda with them to Hawaii. They ate macrobiotic foods and meditated a lot. . . . The Beatles have said that they would return to the United States for a tour if they could be sure that audiences would listen to their music quietly without screaming. Petitions signed by fans promising to be quiet if the Beatles come back are being started all over the country. If you send petitions signed by all your friends to me, I'll forward them to the boys. . . . The Beach Boys are keeping busy. Brian and Carl Wilson have been hanging around with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who'll be doing a college tour with the group. . . . \"Candy\", the ribald comedy movie with cameo appearances by Ringo Starr, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn and many others, hasn't even finished filming yet, but already it's been tentatively scheduled for a television showing on ABC-tv in 1972. . . . The Scaffold received a little help from their friends on their new album. Paul McCartney produced it and Jimi Hendrix, Graham Nash of the Hollies and ex-Traffic guitarist Dave Mason, who some are calling the fourth Scaffold, made various contributions. . . . Remember Ricky Nelson? He's now the proud father of twin sons. Maybe he's thinking of doing a family tv series? . . . This year's edition of Who's Who In America lists the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Rolling Stones, Mamas and Papas, Donovan, Country Joe & The Fish, Grateful Dead, and the Monkees. The only other pop stars recognized previously are the Beatles and Elvis Presley. . . . The Beatles' Apple Films may do an hour-long documentary movie on the life and work of famous dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn... Famous writer Derek Taylor, who once was the Beatles' press officer, has returned to London from California to head their Apple Records. . . . Sid Bernstein, manager of the Young Rascals, is planning a pop music festival in New York City sometime late this June. The Rascals, the Beatles and other celebrities are on the board of directors. Teen volunteers, from all over the country, are needed to publicize the festival. If you'd like to help, write to POP FESTIVAL, c/o Sid Bernstein . . . If you're wondering why your old Granny hasn't been going to the movies lately, it's because I've been too busy going to nightclubs and concerts. . . . In the Village, . . . the Candymen, who now include an incredible live version of \"I Am The Walrus\" in their repertoire, have played the Electric Circus recently. . . . Till next time, hang loose.\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 55.\n\nwe read your mail\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . I wish to bring to your attention an album which certainly deserves mention in your fine magazine - OF CABBAGES AND KINGS by Chad Stuart and Jeremy Clyde. . . .\n\nI also believe that Hit Parader could do well with no further articles on America's contribution to mediocrity: The Monkees. Rather run more articles on the Beatles (still the greatest), Donovan, Chad and Jeremy (of course), and others like them who are creating music . . . - A satisfied reader; Bristol, Tenn.\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . Say hello to Granny for me and tell her I saw Person Belgrade peddling pinwheels on Broad and Market yesterday. Person deserves better. Give him a job or something. . . . - Marian Calabro; Kearny, N.J.\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . Somebody has finally given recognition to what must surely be one of the most phenomenal groups on the contemporary scene, The Vanilla Fudge. . . . However your description of their single, You Keep Me Hangin' On, as being \"overworked\" is terribly unfair. This song, I feel, ranks along with such achievements as East-West, The End, and A Day In The Life for mind-blowing power. . . . - David Henman; Saint John, N.B.\n\nDear Editor:\n\n. . . Every time I read your magazine, I get a kick out of the Yech Award. But I think it's unfair to condemn records because there has to be some talent there or else it wouldn't have been recorded. I don't think that All You Need Is Love and 96 Tears should have gotten that award because they were good records. . . .\n\nFinally, I'd like to see a large analysis of the Rolling Stones' new album, THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST. It is an unbelievable album. I also feel that SGT. PEPPER was the album of the century. The Beach Boys' WILD HONEY is also very good. I hope your magazine will give the latter a good review. . . . - A reader; Phillipsburg, N.J.\n\nDear Editor:\n\nI agree fully with the letter . . . about the STRANGE DAYS album by the Doors. I'd go so far as to say it is better than SGT. PEPPER. . . .\n\nIn your Platter Chatter of the last issue, you put down SATANIC by the Rolling Stones. If you don't like that, how can you like MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR by the Beatles? . . . The Stones, in my opinion, were trying to copy SGT. PEPPER, and the Beatles' LP was all of the old singles, plus a few good ones (Magical Mystery Tour, You Mother Should Know). I think that both groups could do much better. . . .\n\nWith all the fancy covers on LPs the music seems to be getting worse. Groups are spending too much time on the covers.

I really like the fact that the Beatles locked themselves in a recording studio for ten days and tried to sound as unlike the Beatles as possible. They came out with Yellow Submarine, although I know a lot of people thought it was rubbish. I think it was an advancement, especially for them. But there are so many things, even if you don't realize it at the time. So many musical forms you can be influenced by.\n\nHit Parader, Jul 1968, page 63.\n\nnew stars on the horizon\n\n. . . A new group for whom a long life is being forecast is Grapefruit, a four-man combination based in London.\n\nTheir personal manager is head of The Beatles' Apple Publishing Company, which also publishes their songs. Their recording manager is Terry Melcher (son of film star Doris Day) . . . It was John Lennon who solved everyone's problems by suggesting their name - Grapefruit.\n\nGrapefruit came into being via a chance meeting between Terry Doran, managing director of the Beatles' Apple Publishing Company, and John Perry [Grapefruit lead guitarist to be] in a London club. . . .\n\nWithin a week the four of them [including George Alexander, a good bass man suggested by Doran, and Geoff and Pete Swettenham, two schoolmates of Perry] were in the recording studios. . . .\n\nRCA Victor in Britain, delighted with the sound the four boys produce, signed them up and released their first disc, Dear Delilah, in Britain on 19 January. Grapefruit uses Beatle and Bee Gees-like orchestral backings, sound effects and bass rhythms.\n\nThen a problem arose: What to call the group. Suggested names were tossed back and forth but none of them seemed to fit. Then the group's personal manager, Terry Doran, casually asked John Lennon if he had any ideas. Twenty-four hours later John called on the phone and the group was christened - Grapefruit. . . .\n\nGeorge Alexander (bass guitar) born: 28 December 1947 in Glasgow. . . .

HP: I'm told that you play on the Jackie Lomax record (\"Sour Milk Sea\" backed with \"The Eagle Laughs at You,\" one of the first releases on the Beatles' Apple record label). Did the Beatles ask you to?\n\nClapton: Yeah. We did favors for one another. I guess George (Harrison) liked working with me 'cause first of all I worked on \"Wonderwall,\" the sound track music he was doing, and he liked that so he used me on the session. Paul, Ringo, George and me.\n\nHP: They do quite a bit of overdubbing, don't they?\n\nClapton: No. Nothing at all, except the voice and except for a small part of the guitar solo, the last part of the guitar solo. . . .\n\nHP: Are you tempted by any Indian instruments?\n\nClapton: No, because I've tried my hand and it's just an impossible thing. It's too late for me to do that in this life. . . .\n\nHP: Do you like any groups now, any artists?\n\nClapton: I've been back in England so I haven't noticed too much of what's going on over here, but I've liked a lot of the groups in England. I like the way the Stones are going and I like the way the Beatles are going. There's a group called Fairport Convention which is ridiculous, frighteningly good.

Left to right Mr. Derek Taylor, Mr. James Paul McCartney, Mr. Peter Asher and Mr. Tony Bramwell, some of whom may be known to you. Hand reaches down to the recording button... push forward... raise the mike and speak.\n\nInhibited by the wayside Question Time, and the first enquiry is an inarticulate one. \"Films? How about films? I mean, you must give me something specific... the United Artists commitment\n\nP. Mac Cee: The only trouble is, Alan, I don't like to be specific. Now, I wouldn't mind if I had a few things to say. But I'm afraid it has to be... general.\"\n\nLooks like it's going to be hard going this. Yes, but I say, and Paul sends up the whole thing wid dis sudden Brooklyn bit about we's just a group of boys who get togedder, by d' roadside, an' we's gonna make it big wid our next album on d' Apple label. . . .\n\nYes, yes, I struggle, but the commitment to United Artists...\n\nP. Mac Cee: \"Right, well go on, and I'll give you some evasive generalization! There's a few films in the air. There's films I'd like to make on my own, with not me in 'em, just people in 'em. Just anything films.\n\n\"Films of what goes on. Films of grass. Films of people moving about. And then films I'd like to make with the Beatles band. Which would be musical films.\n\n\"But... they shouldn't just be musical films, which everybody offers. They should be the other thing as well. And it's probably going to be up to us to think of it, because people don't seem to be coming forward with offers.\"\n\nIt's going nicely now. I'm warming up to it. I ask if the Beatles are now dedicated to making what should be made, and incidentally - there'll be money.\n\n\"If you didn't need money to get things, and if you got things by swapping 'em then by a roundabout method we'd be dedicated to swopping.\n\n\"We're only dedicated to doing.\"\n\nBut then, I say, you're obviously out to expand Apple and make it a thriving concern, and Mr. Asher agrees but points out that the reason is not to make a fortune. Mr. Taylor agrees and says the Apple policy is to make and sell hits, hits, hits - hit records, hit films, and hit electronics.\n\nSuddenly: \"There's something else you want to know, Alan, and I'm willing to give it to you. But if you just sort of say: 'Films,' then I'll say: 'Right, Alan. Eggs.\"\n\nGet a bit hurt. Ah yes, I say, but you know what I want to know. \"Yes,\" beams Paul, \"I know I do!\"\n\nMr. Derek Taylor puts it all in focus: he interviews me. Alan Smith, he says - are you dedicated to making money, as it is said of you that you are? I have to admit it, I am. I believe money will help my loved ones and me and to live in comfort and style. \"And style?\" emphasizes Mr. Taylor - \"you're in good shape, Alan.\" It was nice to have me on the show. I'm being put down, and although goodwill dilutes the sting, it's still a bit uncomfortable being grilled by so many chefs at the roadside barbecue. So it's back to the car and I think - Right, Mate. No punches pulled this time. Turn the tape over, put it at the beginning, switch on and know I'm wiping out Cilla Black and Davy Jones with every word.\n\nDo the bold bit about now, look here, I interview many artists and most of them are specific, you know.\n\n\"O.K. then,\" says P. Mac Cee, feet up and defences coming down. \"Whenever we lay off recording for a long period of time - which we do - we get out of the habit, and it's not together and it's not happening. It takes a couple of weeks to get to know each other again and how we play.\n\n\"For instance, when I went to L.A. I heard things on the radio that completely changed a lot of things I'd been thinking about music and about sounds I was hearing. So it made me write a few songs differently or arrange them differently.\"\n\nLong discussion about Apple and what it means and what it stands for. Paul points out that in the past there were creative people who had to go on their knees for work, and for records and films and to get the breaks, man. \"And everyone gets down on their knees and grovels a bit.\"\n\nThe idea now is that Apple is an organization where you don't have to do that, where if you're good you get recognized. The trouble is that so much of the pop and record at the moment is run by people who don't have a clue what it was about.\n\nThe ones who do know - it shows. Jerry Wexler, Herb Alpert, Berry Gordy and so on. When you have thinking, involved people like this, it isn't necessary to depend all the time on the Big Fat Men.\n\nStart to get around to the no-punches-pulled bit. Talk about cripples, or disabled persons, as my correspondent of last week tells me. (Sorry. A word can cut like a knife.)\n\nWhat about helping people like this, I ask. What about giving them the money to buy things to make things, to obtain their satisfaction and self-respect?\n\nPaul: Well, what about helping the cripples?\n\nMe: Because maybe they're having a hard time of it, and you're doing all right. Don't you believe in human kindness?\n\nPaul: Cripples are not necessarily having a hard time of it. And even if they are having a hard time of it - it's their own hard time. It is, man. It doesn't matter what you say about helping cripples or India... there's no way to pour millions of pounds into India and make India all right.\n\nLet me get to your conscience, I say. You must have seen, in India, people with their bellies hanging out with hunger. No, says Paul. I didn't see that. Have you?\n\nBut doesn't it worry you? \"No,\" says Paul flatly, \"starvation in India doesn't worry me one bit. Not one iota. It doesn't, man.\n\n\"And it doesn't worry you, if you're honest. You just pose. You don't even know it exists. You've only seen the Oxfam ads. You can't pretend to me that an Oxfam ad can reach down into the depths of your soul and actually make you feel for those people - more, for instance, than you feel about getting a new car.\n\n\"If it comes to a toss-up and getting a new car, you'd get a new car. And don't say you wouldn't - 'cos that's the scene, with you and most people.\n\n\"The point is also 'Do you really feel for Vietnam?' and the answer is the same. Maybe I'd rather listen to a rock record than go there to entertain, and maybe, underneath, that's true in all of us. I know one is morally better than the other, but I'd never get around to it. I'd be a hypocrite.\"\n\nSays he believes in something called God, but anything and everything is God. Never thinks about eternity or outer space - more concerned with inner space.\n\nThe Crunch. Ask him to analyze himself and tell him I have always believed him to be Likeably - repeat, likeably - Insincere. . . .\n\nPause. \"To you, possibly,\" says Paul. \"Because I think 'Here's an interview!' I don't' think Alan Smity, person, at all. I think I have to watch what I say because you don't say certain things to papers.\n\n\"Whenever I'm face with a Pop Press Conference or a drink with the reporters, I can't be sincere... 'cos I wouldn't be there. But I suppose that by being pleasantly insincere, I can at least get to know people on some level in the short space of time.\"\n\nLong conversation and then finally, a statement. \"The Truth about Me,\" says Paul, \"is that I'm... Pleasantly Insincere!\n\n\"And really that's the Whole Truth, and nothing but.\" - alan smith\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 14.\n\nJOHN SEBASTIAN ON THE ROAD AGAIN\n\n\"Each group's music has its source at a different time and has its particular culmination at a certain point, that point where you take it about as far as it can go. For us, our [the Lovin' Spoonful] magical time was about two years ago now. . . .\n\n\"It was really good chemistry. It goes away though. It goes away fast sometimes, it goes slow, it goes away according to how well you can handle it, how mature you are going into the group, and now everybody is sort of out of it. That doesn't really include everybody. Certainly the Beatles are perfectly active. The Stones have a beautiful kind of rejuvenation process. . . . But there are a tremendous number of groups who have broken up, and they're all of a peculiarly common school. . . .\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 18.\n\nIs ARTHUR BROWN All There?\n\n. . . \"We are going to aim for as many people as is possible to get them into our thing, you know. So you get the single out and some of the singles buyers are going to album buyers. Then they are interested in the other things we are going to do.\n\n\"Like John Lennon's books. They sell because people think here is another facet of that interesting bloke. So we have our books and films and within two years we will have built or started on our first fun palace.\" . . .\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 22.\n\nBUFFALO SPRINGFIELD\n\nLast Time Around\n\n. . . Within the Springfield were three of the best pop songwriters, singers and guitarists to be found in any American rock group: Steve Stills, Neil Young and Richie Furay. It is amazing that all three could be contained in one group and perhaps inevitable that eventually they would fragment. The Beatles hold together somehow, but the Beatles have the assurance that they are being listened to. The Springfield never drew sufficient attention to salve the yearnings of three collective egos. A rock writer in a national magazine casually dismissed them as a \"better than average group,\" a brush-off which was symptomatic of their lack of stature outside of Southern California. . . .\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 25.\n\nWHITE BLUES REVOLUTION\n\n. . . The first Butterfield album was released in the late fall of 1965, about the same time as RUBBER SOUL. Even if it didn't quite outsell the The Beatles, the BUTTERFIELD BLUES BAND on Elektra EKS-7294 was an immediate hit. . . .\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 35.\n\npictures I hear, by Brigitta\n\nFor those who don't happen to feel comfortable with the precepts and ideas of Chairman Mao, it's comforting to know we have the Beatles with us in Revolution. The Beatles don't make a distinction as to who commits destruction or repression. They are anti-violence and pro-love. It says so in the song. The Beatles discuss \"Revolution\" with a peaceful and fairly well-ordered sound, more reminiscent of All You Need Is Love, than of I Am The Walrus, in shape and style, which is to say it is repetitious and not brilliantly formed. But the song is philosophically important, because it shows that the Beatles are not apolitical, and that they have taken a look around at the turbulance of world events and want to tell us where they stand. Maybe the Beatles thought of writing Revolution after seeing the film Les Chinoises. The implications of Revolution make an interesting contrast to the sentiments expressed in the Rolling Stones' Street Fighting Man. The Beatles and the Stones never seemed farther apart.\n\nI am glad to know that the Beatles will not contribute to support violent causes of any type, but Hey Jude, in all fairness, would have to be called the \"A\" side of the record. It is quite a darling work of art, though I question the necessity of at least the last minute and a half of the recessional chorus, and it does tax the patience of the disc jockeys.\n\nHey Jude is a warm Caribbean song conceived of Lovely Rita out of Fool On The Hill. What a pure and ecstatic seduction it is, drunk on meditation, orange suns rising and setting all over the place. Yes, Hey Jude is definitely an orange song, with a touch of mauve; guavas and hibiscus - \"...You say goodbye and I say hello...\" breadfruit. No doubt Donovan would like it; so would Genoa Keawe and her Hula Maidens.\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 36.\n\n1988: A YEAR FOR NOSTALGIA - APPLE\n\nIt was good then, good when we were young then, when we were new and The Apple was fresh and the other apples, wrinkling and shrivelling in creaking barrels, tended by old misers and ghostly villains, drew their shroud-skins more tightly around themselves and said \"They'll learn, they'll learn it's no fun, no fun at all.\"\n\nIt was, though. It was fun in Wigmore Street with the office-Beatles, hobbits entranced by their new spring business-suits sprinkled with bright buttons, mandalas and daisies which winked reassurance at the other young revolutionaries and seemed to say: \"We're still on your side, don't let the suits deceive you.\"\n\nIn the early, shining summer of 1968 we had Apple Music, Apple Shops, Apple Films and Apple Electronics. We hadn't made a record and we hadn't made a film. We hadn't sold a single invention and we hadn't opened any shops outside London. What is more, we had spent nearly a million pounds of The Beatles' money. So it was then, when \"But surely it's time you had a record out,\" \"But don't you think it's time...\" \"But it can't be possible for the Beatles...\" when most of the questions began like that, we said \"Yes\" or \"No\" or \"Wait\", because even then it was beyond doubt, beyond the far-shaded tip of a shadow of doubt within any of us forty or so at Apple, that in the fullness of time, the hits would mount and the albums increase across the universe so that every village which had passed the Age of Mud would have the green Apple smiling at them from the record stand beside the record player, beyond doubt that when the patents of the inventions of Magic Alex Mardas were safe from the thievery of the business bandits who at the beginning of time would have stolen the blue-print for childbirth had they been Abel. One week \"The Observer\" came to Apple to see, \"The Mirror\" to reflect, and both were drolly surprised to find that John and Paul came in on time, whatever the time. For Paul it was about half past ten and for John, a man of erratic sleep, three hours later. Each stayed until nightfall, and further, in those days and my goodness we kept busy. We had suggestion boxes for suggestions, and the amazing thing was that the suggestions were read and interpreted and, incredibly, implemented in many cases. \"I suggest we...\" Done. \"May we please have...\" Certainly.\n\nA time-and-motion man would have lost his reason in those days in Wigmore Street. I had a slim shoebox of a room and such were our promises of a hearing for anyone with something creative to offer; anyone off the street who was frustrated with years of screaming for someone to listen; any singer who could climb a scale; anyone with a piece of colored paper which he called a painting; any caller with rhyme he believed to be poetry; any Fellini of the 1970s. Such was our published pledge to be a market place for the lowly artist, a gathering of Beautiful People, that by dusk any night there could be a duo of guitarists \"better than Clapton,\" a Mancunian who saw himself as a mingling of \"Mr. Kite,\" \"John Wesley Harding\", \"Billy Shears\", \"The Mighty Quinn\" and \"Popeye the Sailor Man\" and having thus seen, sought 50,000 pounds to make a film of him acting out the fantasy, California author-to-be with hair like a hedge in Heswell, a sculptress who had never sculpted but who wanted facilities to make a nude out of patent leather and then cover it in oil to induce \"tactile delight,\" (you and whose army?) a Geordie who had caught the Parisian inflections of his French girlfriend and who wanted a flat in which to rehearse - and me, sitting on the floor, on the windowsill, in the waste paper basket, on our hands, on each other's head. All this, and cups of tea, and cigarettes, and Scotch and ahead, a train to dark Dorking, all this was in a cupboard tolerable only to a typist cowed by years of pain.\n\nBut it was good because we met some fine people and some terrible people and that's how it goes. In the big corner room, John and Paul and George and, Ringo would play host to those with goods to sell and needs to be met. Nilsson came in after arriving in England and met Kenny Everett there, and Twiggy came the day before with Justin, both of them looking wonderful and happy and quite rightly. Ron Kass, Apple Music head, fresh to Apple in 1968, from the chieftancy of the outriding Liberty Records International Division, walking with diplomacy from room to room, learning the strange dialect of the Liverpudlian and there were lots of us then - Neil Aspinall, the managing director, with a face like a carving of Alexander the Great, 26, from Liverpool; Alistair Taylor, ex-Nems record store, ex-Epstein's general manager, now Apple's general manager at 33, from Liverpool; Tony Bramwell; 23, Apple Films assistant, ex-Epstein office boy brighter than white white, from Liverpool; Peter Brown, 32, ex-Epstein personal assistant, calm and very smooth and very nice, now special assistant to The Beatles (\"Ringo, I was talking to Mr. and Mrs. Burton and they would love you to have lunch on the yacht next Sunday...\" \"Leslie Grande tells me the Queen would like the Beatles... really it is a frightfully difficult one to solve, however...\") from Liverpool. Me, an adjustable spanner now reunited with The Beatles after a tryst with California, from Liverpool. Mal Evans (with Nel, a former road manager), Mal the grinning giant now helping with the management of Apple's first signed artists, as Artists Relations officer (or \"man\", or whatever anyone outside chose to call his role, for really none of us had any titles then, except when we were negotiating to have one, because Sir Frank or Lord Kenneth or whoever Apple was negotiating with, liked our side to have, titles too). Mal is from Liverpool. Pete Shotton too, Peter The Dane who washboarded Lennon's Quarrymen, who now stands at his right hand. Laurie who lives on the switchboard - Nems and Liverpool. And, of course, The Beatles. They are from there too. From Wallasey we had Brian Lewis, grey-sideburned, slim and a Man-About-the-Globe, 44; from Ireland, Denis O'Dell, 45, Apple Films. Peter Asher, 23, of Gordon now, also, an Apple A&R chief from which London gave one other executive when we were beginning - Stephen Maltz, 26, chief accountant. \"Well,\" they said in the Town, the Town outside our world in Wigmore Street,\" it's just an old pals club.\" \"Well Town\", we said, \"it is. Old pals and new pals and business with pleasure and also a profit and you know it can't be bad.\"\n\nCould it? Well, Peter Sellers came in and saw that it was good, and another fellow determined to find it bad, came in and started a row, and said he had taken a dirty job in a garage and gone to live in Brixton to purge his soul, to learn about suffering, what did we think of that? \"Nothing,\" we said, \"Nothing at all. You're talking --- \" we said (just as we might say to each other, and often did without rancor for The Beatles were nothing in those startling sixties if they were not frank) and he grew angrier than we and left amply satisfied on a nice negative note.\n\nYes, but what did we do then, in 1968 when we had only two signed singers. Two? Yes. James Taylor sharp-eyed, made of bone and wire in North Carolina and Mary Hopkin, fashioned in dew, freckled and shy and mini in a mini skirt from the Rhondda Valley. What tasks had we, when the third Beatles' film had neither name nor script, nor contract, when Apple Publishing looked for its first hit?\n\nWell, what we did was, we planned and talked and laughed and got ready for when - for whenever. We each found work to do and from each other we took work, and to each other we gave work and thus we found the very work we liked doing, and the very work we did best, and we did it well and some of us thought it would have been wonderful, always, to have been allowed to carve our jobs out of a stone of our own choosing, rather than have choked all those years, on the dust of the chalk thrown to us in the name of WORK as a four-lettered euphemism for slavery.\n\nWe bartered with United Artists, and traded with EMI and Capitol; and a dozen rivals, and we prayed as hard to be trusted as we dared to hope, that we ourselves could trust. The Beatles decided to eliminate business lies, lies so standardized by practice that they had become known as \"standard business practice\" and they said they didn't know what \"the party of the third part ult. inst and heretofore\" could mean \"having regard to the precedent\" therefore that form of obscuring the truth was swept into the vacuum which hangs somewhere in the generation-gap, that gap that existed in the 1960's which, remember, was before Youth took over. It was remarkable how diverse The Beatles, already diffuse, became in 1968. From the elegant and exquisite madness of the high Summer of 1967, through the valley of the shadow of the Autumn death of Brian Epstein, up through the Himalayas into meditation, and out of the folds of the Maharishi's conjurors' cloak into George's film with Ravi Shankar in Big Sur, to John's art exhibition at the Robert Fraser Galley, to Paul's collaboration with the Black Dyke Mills Band (Paul's collaboration with whom?) in the Apple recording of Thingamebob,' for the Kenneth Cope TV series, to the magnificent making of the album - successor to Sergeant Pepper, to the new offices in Saville Row, where lingered a quaint aura in which the ghost of Jack Hylton, who had given some of London's most avante garde private film shows in this, his former home, sat chatting quietly with the severed head of a much older host who began his career in the same house with the 18th century Earl of Burlingham.\n\nThrough all of that, The Beatles ran Apple, had the ideas, heard the ideas, adopted them or forgot them, and Apple knew that with such people, its core must be sound and so Apple Corps Ltd. had no apologies to make, nor has now.\n\nThat was all a long time ago and it was a lovely time, because no one had fear for we knew that there was no fear to fear for we believed that as no one feared that which was past, and that as Now and even the Future would soon be the Past, there could be no fear. Then, as now, it does not exist; it cannot exist on its own - derek taylor\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 38.\n\nMARY HOPKIN - FIRST APPLESEED\n\nMary Hopkin left school four weeks before taking her university entrance examinations. Her marathon eight week run on the preposterous Opportunity Knocks TV talent contest didn't allow for sixth form swotting, and alongside a recording contract with Apple Records, any possible matriculation certificate was positively insignificant. So she pressed her navy skirt - the one that got her into so much trouble for being so risque (two inches above the knee) - and passed it on to a younger girl in school.\n\nBut she saved the blazer: \"When she was at school she would never wear it. Now she wants to keep it - for the badge,\" says her mother, fingertip-testing her hands primly across the creases of her dress.\n\nAlthough they will never admit it, none of the Hopkin family can fully realize what is happening to them: can grasp that it was no less than Twiggy who told the Paul McCartney how great their Mary was; can begin to understand the expense and enthusiasm, that only a Beatle launching, his dream organization, could put behind her.\n\nFather, Mr. Howel Hopkin, housing officer with the Pontardawe Rural Council, Glamorgan South Wales, looks on the whole splendid charade of star-creating with a bemused benignity: \"No, I'm not nervous - you get hardened to this sort of thing in local government. It's probably a good training for anything\"... but then... \"your man's takin' a lot of pictures, isn't he? Mrs. Hopkin's father took photographs. Best pictorial photographer in Wales he was - won 13 firsts, he did.\"\n\nAnd Mary herself, at eighteen, the girl from the valleys and Top Rank Dancing in Swansea on Saturday nights; the girl who lost five pounds in weight during her Opportunity Knocks stint. \"I feel so different from those London girls. When you go out with someone here it's just kissing, but I know they take it for granted there - I'm so confused.\"\n\nShe meets us at the front door of their stone' house (mock nineteenth century - actually post-War) in the steep-sided Brynawel Road, Pontardawe, with her hair just washed and fluffy. She's clearly in a state of off-hand nerves. Her answers to pleasantries and compliments come out instantly to hide her shyness; we ask her how she feels about anything (everything) and it's \"all right.\"\n\nWith ease she peels off the events, polite but obviously bored. \"We went up to Cardiff and I auditioned for Opportunity Knocks, and I was chosen from about two hundred. And apparently Twiggy saw me, and I got a message asking me to phone someone at Apple Records called Peter Brown - and when I did I found I was talking to someone with a Liverpool accent, and I found out later it was Paul McCartney - would you like a cup of tea? - and he sent a car for me from London, and he auditioned me, and he asked me if I'd like to sign a contract, and - Mum says \"Would you like some fruit cake?\"\n\nAs she speaks we study her. John Kelly, the photographer whom Paul McCartney sent down \"to record every inch of her life at home,\" is performing strange contortions on the floor, clicking like a madman, pushing his exposure meter under her nose, next to her bust, into her hair, then wandering 'round the floral room perusing the Victorian Swansea Pottery tea service, the gilt painted frame to the Renoir print, the display cabinet of golfing cups, the books on Welsh culture and history. Mary keeps on with her tale - learned pat with the telling. She's slim and flat-bottomed and has a good forehead dusted with powder, fine straight legs not too many weeks out of ankle socks, and an all-embracing air of innocence - not the sweet-little-have-me-if-you-can-get-me sort of girl - all commercial facade, but someone gauche and childlike and with an accusing honesty. Mary Hopkin hasn't time to learn the tricks of any trade.\n\n\"Yes, Mary's always been singing. I wanted her to be in serious singing and music. Perhaps be a music teacher or something.\" Her mother is talking and pouring tea and cutting cake and becoming chief narrator. Mary sits quietly, only interjecting to disagree when her mother's innate sense of public relations looks like opening a credibility gap. \"Of course it was in chapel that she started singing - doesn't everybody in Wales? She's been faithful in Tabernacle (the Pontardawe Congregational Tabernacle) since she was four, but she can't go as much as she'd like to now, because of all the late nights.\n\n\"As a child she was always sweet-tempered and not a bit mischievous (Mary cringes under the weight of her blushes). And she's quiet around the house, too, and very cool. When she had to go to Cardiff to make her first television appearance I was in a terrible state rushing - trying to get her ready, but she insisted on having a good breakfast. She never panics, you see.\"\n\nMrs. Hopkin races on: \"You have to trust them don't you? I mean if she'd been going to the University she would have had to leave home. She's had a sheltered life but she'll be able to live in London with her sister (Carol who starts at a London art college in September). If she keeps on as she is now we'll be happy with her. I would have liked her to have gone to Cardiff College of Music, of course, but now this has happened... well...\"\n\nProfessionally, Mary's career began with some engagements in Working Men's Clubs in South Wales, (\"the furthest I got was Brigend, near Cardiff') and some appearances singing folk songs on Welsh television programs. She was given her guitar, which is now battered and cracked, three years ago, together with a mandolin. She never learned to play the mandolin, but caused a positive liturgical crisis when she took her guitar down to Tabernacle one Sunday morning.\n\n\"My interest in folk music was started by a golfing friend of my father's. He's a sanitary inspector called Ieuan Lewis. He's very interested in Welsh culture and began looking for songs for me. He was at Dylan Thomas' funeral, you know.\"\n\nWe nod with fitting reverence.\n\n\"It was through him that I became interested in Judy Collins and Joan Baez.\" And it doesn't take a very acute listener to spot their influence in her singing.\n\nIn the T-shaped valley town of Pontardawe (population: 10,000, industry: light engineering) Mary's already a star.\n\nEven the cats, they say, voted for her when she appeared on television, and everybody wants to know the Hopkin family now. A walk through the rural lanes, (and equally rural streets,) with Mary is a running congratulation, shrilled in a garbled mixture of Welsh and English from behind every privet hedge, or lace curtain, and from out of every slow moving car. This could only happen in Wales. Could any but the Welsh share another's good fortune and success without a trace of envy or malice? If Mary Hopkin lived in London the neighbors wouldn't give a damn.\n\nStanding on Elephant Rock above the town at night, father Howel Hopkin becomes almost sentimental: \"They're all from 'round here, you know: Richard Burton was born just over there, Ray Milland more this side, Donald Peers in that direction, and now Mary Hopkin down here in Pontardawe. \"\n\nSays Mrs. Hopkin: \"All my mother's side were very musical - nice tenors, you know. And we entered Mary in the Eisteddfods and the Urdd Festival - but she never won anything for the singing. I would have liked her to have been a serious singer, she had voice training in Cardiff every Saturday morning, but when Paul McCartney phoned... She's always been a Beatle fan, thought. Her bedroom wall was covered with their pictures one time. When they first started we were on a touring holiday in North Wales, and had to stay three days in Llandudno, because they were going there and Mary wanted to see them.\"\n\nBack at home again the telephone drills its alarm. Mother, making ham sandwiches, answers: \"It's to say you must go to London tomorrow, and have you learned the songs that Paul asked you to?\n\nMary takes the phone herself. Mother continues. \"While you were out Elizabeth Taylor was on the telly. Oh she was beautiful. She's bought this Claude Monet painting, they said.\"\n\nAnd then confidentially to her daughter: \"Don't you go up to London in a first class carriage, because I don't want you sitting by yourself. You never know who might get in with you. Go second class with everybody else. Well, you never know.\"\n\nAlready, after a few television appearances, Mary Hopkin is becoming a national favorite. In a time when the girl next door is a randy little nymph she offers an aura of simplicity. When she sings, her voice is pure and straight. She's the daughter every father would want.\n\nShe Says: \"There's a man in Ireland whose dying of cancer and he wrote to me asking for a record. He only has a few weeks left to live. It makes you wonder...\n\n\"No, I've never been in love. I think it's daft the way some of the girls at school were always in love with a different boy. There's no one at all now. I just haven't the time. And when I'm in London I feel so much of a country bumkin alongside all those sophisticated girls. Still I'll be happy to get to London now and again.\" - derek taylor\n\n- THOSE WERE THE DAYS\n\n(As recorded by Mary Hopkin/Apple)\n\nGENE RASKIN\n\nOnce upon a time there was a tavern . . .\n\nHit Parader, Mar 1969, page 40.\n\nMICK JAGGER\n\nAnd Censorship\n\n. . .

More and more people from different backgrounds are meeting and exchanging ideas. The classical thing is only a small part of it. The more things we get influenced by, the more we learn.

Take a small country like Ireland, one of the most musical countries in the world. It has one of the largest folk literatures of any nation. However, Ireland hasn't produced a Beethoven or a Brahm probably because it's unnecessary. The Irishman's need is taken care of in his folk literature and it's right from the people. In America, the folk literature comes out in Motown and the Jesse Colin Youngs and in a broader sense, the Beatles. Harmonically these young people are using changes that are very interesting and perhaps even purer than jazz. They're drawing on a rural feeling which is country western and blues.

To this day, their power has not subsided, in fact, their influence penetrates deeper into the initial trusts they established. They have raised standards in so many areas involving communication that there is no longer any need to accept shuck. Their influence on the film industry alone is enough to merit a book on the subject.\n\nThe animated film, \"Yellow Submarine\" inspired by the Beatles music and personalities, will undoubtedly add new dimension to the Walt Disney style full-length film feature.\n\nBy far the most enthusiastic reactions to \"Yellow Submarine' screenings have come from art directors and designers and other film makers who recognize this as a real milestone in the art of animation.\n\nDesigner Dong Kingman was so impressed, he asked for a special screening for the faculty of the Famous School. Peter Max, himself the talk of the art world, said it was the most \"fantastic\" movie he'd ever seen.\n\nThe Beatles were more surprised than anyone that their first Apple movie venture generated so much interest. They worked closely with producer Al Brodax right from the inception of \"Yellow Submarine\", wrote four new songs (\"All Together Now,\" \"Only A Northern Song\", \"Hey Bulldog,\" \"It's All Too Much\") and helped choose old Beatle songs that would fit the mood of the story. The song \"Yellow Submarine\" was the original inspiration for the film and the other songs included are \"Eleanor Rigby\", \"Love You To,\" \"A Day In The Life,\" \"When I'm 64,\" \"Nowhere Man,\" \"Lucy In The Sky,\" \"Sgt. Pepper,\" and \"With A Little Help From My Friends.\"\n\nKing Features, producer of the Beatles tv cartoon series, also had a hand in presenting the film based on an original story by Lee Minoff. The man responsible for the marvelous color drawings is design/director, Heinz Edelmann.\n\nThe story goes like this.\n\nOn a peaceful day in the happy kingdom of Pepperland, a concert by Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is interrupted by an anti-music missile attack from the Blue Meanies. The Chief Blue Meanie, his assistant Max, and their 99 numbered henchmen turn their splotch guns on the docile Pepperland populace, determined to rid the world of music, happiness and love (\"A world without music is a Blue world.\")\n\nOld Fred, conductor of the Band, flees to the old Lord Mayor, who puts him into the Yellow Submarine for a last-minute escape. The sub surfaces in Liverpool where Ringo wanders the shore in boredom. Old Fred explains the situation and Ringo takes him home to John, found painting with words; Paul, playing classical music; and George, who appears out of a haze of transcendental meditation.\n\nArmed with a battery of puns and four new songs, the Beatles board the Yellow Sub and head for Pepperland. They are detoured through the Seas of Time, Music, Science, Monsters, Consumer Products, Nowhere, Phrenology, Green and Holes.\n\nThey romp through time warps; chase Lucy through her \"Sky With Diamonds;\" climb clocks and soup cans; telephone the Queen; get battered in a giant pinball machine, serenaded by Albert Schweitzer, and frowned in an avalanche of apples; among other strange adventures.\n\nCharacters they encounter on their mad \"modyssey\" include Shakespeare, Freud, the US Cavalry, Father MacKenzie, Moses, Cicero, Paul's clean old grand-dad, Napoleon, Methuselah, Mozart, cowboys, Indians, King Kong and the Sheik and several unidentifiable \"things.\" Ringo takes a liking to the super-intellectual Boob, (a poetic personification of the \"Nowhere Man\" and \"The Fool On The Hill\") and takes him along on the trip. In the Sea of Green he is captured by a giant blue hand.\n\nA pepper-powered sneeze propels the Beatles through the Sea of Holes into occupied Pepperland; now almost completely drained of color by the splotch bomb blitz. The Lord Mayor is astonished by the resemblance between the Beatles and the original Sergeant Pepper Band.\n\nDisguised as Apple Bonker, the Beatles sneak past the Meanie guards into the musical instrument compound. Then it's Beatles versus Meanies, guitars against splotch guns. Even the Boob turns up to deliver a few blows against the \"blue menials\". The battle is a swinging affair. The Chief Blue Meanie rallies his forces, including the ferocious Flying Glove, the Butterfly Stompers, the Hidden Persuader Men with guns in their shows, the Snapping Turtle Turk, with his mouth in his belly and the Count Down Clown with his nosecone nose. Can Good triumph over so much Evil? The outcome is a colorful secret - a surprise ending which carries the fantasy right into the theater itself.\n\n[With picture of Yellow Submarine characters, The Blue Meanie, The Apple Bonkers, The Boob, The Submarine, Jack The Nipper, Robin The Butterfly Stomper, and Mini Meanie.

The people were openly accepting all forms of music to go along with the words - jazz riffs, classical riffs, Afro-Cuban. It was so obvious where it was all heading, but the record industry didn't see it at all. The Beatles blew the lid off and Jim McGuinn was in awe of the Beatles at the time.

A&R stands for artist and repertoire.\n\nBoth the record companies and the artists relied heavily on the A&R man. He really controlled the destiny of the artist and as far as recordings were concerned, he had a job as long as he could produce hits - any kind of hit.\n\nWith the advent of the Beatles the entire attitude about producers changed. The Beatles had more of a say about their records than any previous artist. They were the ones who decided what and how they wanted to record. They relied on George Martin, too, but they were the first to stand up for their own creative rights. That started the era of the independent producer. The power has changed hands, so to speak.\n\nNow, generally, creative groups are recorded by independent producers.

Groups reached far and wide for other musical sounds . . . Then, beginning in 1966, we had the great syntheses . . . The Beatles led the way, of course, with Revolver . . .\n\nSgt. Pepper seemed like the ultimate, but there was always the expectation that future albums would exceed Sgt. Pepper just as it had exceeded what went before. Then came the Christmas rush of 1967 when everybody tried to do just that. Axis, Bold as Love... Their Satanic Majesties Request... After Bathing at Baxter's... Magical Mystery Tour. A lot of good music, a lot of albums sold, but somehow none of the far-out sounds and weird head trips blew our minds like what had come before. . . .\n\nExperimentation is much more suspect now than before, and audiences and critics wear a new skepticism.\n\nAnd into this atmosphere comes Jimi Hendrix and his new superalbum. . . . This album seems more fit for the times than any other album that has come out so far this year. (This is being written before the appearance of the Beatles' and Stones' new albums; I just thought I should point that out.) . . .\n\nHouse Burning Down is some kind of a social commentary on riots, perhaps Hendrix' equivalent of the Beatles' Revolution.

Little Richard. That's who I'd love to record. He's a fantastic character with a fantastic voice - and whether he's singing rock or gospel, he's still great.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison unconsciously tapped his soft shoe in rhythm as he talked and we both jumped at the deep end of nostalgia as we chatted about the good old days when El was King and Richard used to tuttifruit his head off.\n\nExtending his \"I'm a Rocker Again\" thesis and continuing his comments reported recently George said he didn't care to dwell on the \"Mystical Beatle George\" any more.\n\n\"It's still all 'Within You, Without You,'\" he added, \"but I don't want to go into that any more 'cos now I'm being a rock and roll star.\"\n\nThe crooked grin broke into a crooked smile.\n\n\"I'm still writing, though, and after 'Sour Milk Sea,' I've got a few songs I've done on the next Beatles' LP. At least, I think they'll be on it. We haven't worked it all out yet.\n\n\"I've got a lot of songs kicking about in the air, and there's also about two or three I've got at home. But I don't know whether to do 'em or not.\n\n\"Sometimes I write them and with the mood I'm in, they're OK. But I come back to 'em later and I'm not in that mood anymore, so I think: \"Oh, well... Rubbish!\n\n\"I've been doing that for years.\n\n\"Come to think of it, I've probably thrown away at least 20 good songs which, had I followed them through, would have been at least as good as all the other ones.\n\n\"Sometimes I put on a tape at home, and I find there are five bits of songs I wrote around 1954-5-6 or seven, that I just forgot completely about.\n\n\"I've got a song I liked when I first wrote it, and I still like it, but in between I thought: 'Aw, this is a bit too much. People are not gonna believe this.'\n\n\"Anyway, I took it out recently, looked at it, and I know they're still not going to get it. The reason is it still tends to have that deep meaning thing - and I'm trying to get out of that.\n\n\"I now want to write songs that don't have any meaning, because I'm a bit fed up with people coming up and saying: 'hey, what's it all about? What does it mean?'\"\n\nI asked George if he got any really creative experience out of writing and recording.\n\nHe said: \"Of course - it's all like a challenge. You get the idea and you've got the bit of plastic to put it on but then there's the actual thing of going through all that bit of getting musicians together and making people do things the way you want, trying to get the best out of it.\n\n\"And then, in the end, when you've done all that, you've got a little thing there, like a painting... and you put it out... and people say: 'Oh, it's a load of ... man.'\n\n\"But it doesn't matter. Not to me anyway, because you get a lot of people who do like it, and it is worth while.\"\n\nWe got onto the Beatle Fan's Biggest Hope Of All - will the Beatles ever play live again?\n\nAnswer from George, with that smile again: \"It just depends. The thing I'd like to do most of all is play resident in a club.\n\n\"Not to go touring... because I didn't like all that traveling and playing, and all that sort of thing.\n\n\"But if we were to do a live show, I'd prefer to do it like at the Top Ten in Hamburg for three months, and just play in the one place for about three months.\n\n\"Then we could get rid of the myth once and for all of the Beatles being Something Apart from everybody else.\n\n\"Obviously, we go through cycles. At the moment, it's all that bit like getting my guitar out again, and it's happened quite a bit on this next album of the Beatles.\n\n\"We've got 'together' for it. Like, in the early days we were pretty good because we played for so long in one place. That's why I'd like to do a resident spot. Then you've got your amps and your drums set up, and get used to the one sound.\n\n\"All these people come to see you, too, so you can't hide. You can't fake anything. It's like, you know, you've got your trousers down. And there's nothing to hide.\n\n\"Now, we're trying to get as funky as we were in the Cavern. 'Cos in the Cavern and Hamburg, all we really were was thump-thump-thump. But so together, you know, because we were playing all the time. And those were the days when we used to think that 'Twist and Shout' was too way-out for a single. All very Shadows it was, then, and getting into suits.\n\nThe next album is much simpler than 'Pepper' because it's more down to guitars, bass and drums, and maybe a piano. There's a nice one of Paul just playing with his guitar, singing by himself but with just a bit of brass on it.\"\n\nWe got on to the subject of the King, and George said:\n\n\"I remember at school there was all that thing about Elvis. You never really wanted to go to school, you wanted to go out and play or something. So when some record came along like Elvis' 'Heartbreak Hotel,' and you had this little bit of plastic... it was so amazing. Now, it's hard to realize that there are kids like I was, where the only thing in their life is to get home and play their favorite record, and maybe it's ours.\n\n\"We know Elvis is great. We know he is. He stopped being a rocker, and they made him go into the Army and by the time he came out he was a clean healthy American doing clean healthy songs and films. But basically, he's got such a great bluesy voice.\n\n\"It would be great if the Beatles and Elvis could get together for an album. It really would.\" -alan smith\n\nHit Parader, Apr 1969, page 58.\n\nmy favorite records\n\nby Stevie Winwood\n\n. . . But I like all kinds of music at different times.

I heard James Brown say the other day he never made it big until the Beatles mentioned his name a few times. Now, James Brown has been around for almost fifteen years doing that same thing. The white market fell onto a lot of things through the Beatles. In the Negro market if you're good that's all they need. Negroes always liked any kind of music if it was good. I haven't changed my style since I first started and now I can play the same thing in a white joint or a Negro joint.\n\n*** TEEN SCOOP, June 1968 ***\n\nTeen Scoop, Jun 1968, page 7.\n\nTEEN SCOOP POST OFFICE\n\nYEA BEATLES\n\nDear Pam: In regard to the comparison between the Beatles and the Monkees, I have to tell you that there is none. The Beatles have better voices and the songs they write have meaning and worth. I know that the Beatles and their songs will be around long after the Monkees have gone. - Judy Schwartz; Amityville, New York\n\nYEA MONKEES\n\nDear Pam: Once and for all I would like to put an end to all the Monkee-Beatle arguing. The Beatles are out and the Monkees are in. The Beatles think they're too good for their fans while the Monkees are always thinking of their loyal followers.

It turned out we had come to the wrong place by accident.\" [The poster is the psychedelic one done by Richard Avedon for Look magazine, with Ringo holding a dove.]\n\nTeen Scoop, Jun 1968, page 40.\n\nTHE YOUNG RASCALS SPEAKIN' OUR MIND\n\nBy Gene Cornish\n\nIn past issues you've met Eddie Brigati and Dino Danelli; now meet Gene Cornish, the down-to-earth Rascal. . . . Professionally, Gene is considered by many (both fans and experts) to be the premier guitarist in the pop field today. Now, as he speaks his mind . . .\n\nThere are two people I strongly admire and wish to be like. One is my father, a knowledgeable man who understands his limitations and has great patience. The other is Paul McCartney, a master at writing and at guitar-playing. McCartney is also a worldly figure... he fits in anywhere.\n\nTeen Scoop, Jun 1968, page 45.\n\nPHIL OCHS\n\n. . . Like SGT.

Well, my search is over! I've found the answer - Transcendental Meditation - and after I've explained it to you, maybe it'll be your answer, too. . . .\n\nIt is taught by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who has become famous as the \"guru\" who inspired and influenced the Beatles with his teachings. . . .\n\nThe Maharishi teaches that it slowly opens a funnel between the lower physical consciousness and the higher phychical consciousness . . .\n\nThe actual practice of meditation takes about 15 minutes, twice daily in a quiet atmosphere. The results are fantastic. . . .\n\nTeen Scoop, Jun 1968, page 66.\n\nLondon Listenings\n\nFrom Maureen O'Grady\n\nLondon (Teen Scoop Special) London is just a beehive of activity, there is so much happening. The Beatles, as usual, are right in the thick of things. Twiggy asked the boys if they would be interested in helping her with her first film. Of course they said yes, and will produce and write the music for her debut.\n\nThey've also signed up their first recording group, the Grapefruit. John Lennon suggested, the rather unusual name. In typical Beatle style, Grapefruit was launched on its professional career at a huge reception in London. John and Cynthia, Ringo and Maureen and Paul and Jane were there. George was in India writing music for the film \"Wonderwall.\" Other big names that attended the reception were Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, the Moody Blues, the Hollies and Cilla Black and Donovan. It was very crowded, and John got so hot and thirsty that he was continually behind the bar helping himself to a drink.\n\nRingo and Maureen really lived it up during the filming of \"Candy,\" which was shot on location in Rome. Ringo found his part, that of a sexy Mexican gardner, a little embarrassing, but he enjoyed the social whirl. Two of the costars in the film are Marlon Brando and Richard Burton. It was dinner one night with Marlon, pub crawling the next evening with Richard and Elizabeth Taylor, then out on the Burton's yacht for the weekend.\n\nIncidentally, the Beatles' \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" which was roundly panned here by the critics, has been dubbed \"The Tragical Misery Tour.\"\n\nThe boys finally got together again, in India. John, Ringo and Paul joined George there for instructions in Transcendental Meditation from the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. . . .\n\n*** TEEN SCREEN, June 1968 ***\n\nTeen Screen, Jun 1968, cover.\n\nTeen Screen\n\n[Photo of Paul McCartney.]\n\nEXCLUSIVE!

If she had lived for any reasonable length of time with the so-called hippies, she would have found that these people can be divided into two distinct groups or classes: The dressy or part-time hippie, and the true, peace and love hippie.\n\nThe first type . . . is the type that is seen most often. The latter class . . . is the group that does the best job and wins the least credit. I believe that the most famous examples of this type are the Beatles. They know what they are talking about and have found where it is at. . . . - Lisa Robillard, Trenton, N.J.\n\nTeen Screen, Jun 1968, page 25.\n\nTHE FOUR SEASONS\n\n\"We won't always be teenage idols!\"\n\n. . .

The Beatles. No one has come close to them, for they are a rarity, explains Frankie. \"The only group to come close is the group I mentioned before, The Monkees, and they have gone as far as they can go in their present situation.
