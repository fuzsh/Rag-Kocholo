Diamond Dave has debuted his own version of power-pop band Tommy Tutone‚Äôs 1981 hit ‚Äú867-5309/Jenny.‚Äù\n\nRoth has recorded a faithful cover of the song, which was a No. 4 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for Tommy Tutone.\n\nRoth posted his cover under the name ‚ÄúJenny Jenny (That telephone song).‚Äù The tune is accompanied by a video featuring two Styrofoam mannequin heads. One of the mannequin heads resembles Roth and is wearing a headset microphone and wraparound sunglasses. The second head has female features, has bottlecaps for eyes, and is mottled with pink paint.\n\nRoth‚Äôs Fans React to His ‚Äú867-5309/Jenny‚Äù Cover\n\nRoth‚Äôs new recording inspired a lot of fans to share their opinion about the tune in the comments section of his Instagram page.\n\n‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm supposed to hate this but‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs pretty cool,‚Äù one fan wrote. ‚ÄúDave ain‚Äôt lost nothing, it‚Äôs just a different Diamond Dave. I dig it, we‚Äôre lucky to have him.‚Äù\n\nAnother commented, ‚ÄúI need these songs available on cd or vinyl, please, make it happen!‚Äù\n\nA third fan wrote, ‚ÄúTraveling back to the 80‚Äôs with Dave is a fun trip.‚Äù\n\nAbout Roth‚Äôs Recent Recordings\n\nDuring the last few years, Roth has posted a variety of previously unreleased tracks on his official website and social media pages. He‚Äôs also made some of these songs available as digital downloads and via streaming services.\n\nMany of the tracks were originally featured in The Roth Project, an interactive comic book Roth debuted in 2020. The online presentation boasted a soundtrack that included tracks Roth recorded several years earlier in collaboration with current M√∂tley Cr√ºe guitarist John 5.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Roth also posted new versions of several Van Halen songs that he recorded with studio musicians.\n\nMore About ‚Äú867-5309/Jenny‚Äù\n\n‚Äú867-5309/Jenny‚Äù appeared on Tommy Tutone‚Äôs second album, Tommy Tutone 2. The song was co-written by Jim Keller, the band‚Äôs lead guitarist, and Alex Call, who‚Äôd been the lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter of the Bay Area group Clover.\n\nDrummer John Cowsill, a member of the family band The Cowsills, sang backing vocals and played percussion on the track. In recent years, Cowsill has played drums with The Beach Boys.\n\nTOPICS: Music/Entertainment\n\nKEYWORDS: music Navigation: use the links below to view more comments.\n\nfirst 1-20, 21-36 next last\n\n1 posted on by nickcarraway\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nGreat song, great singer.\n\n2 posted on by bigbob\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\n‚ÄúA third fan wrote, ‚ÄúTraveling back to the 80‚Äôs with Dave is a fun trip.‚Äù\n\nProbably a little off topic but I‚Äôm sorry I certainly disagree with that. I was 18 when VH first album came out and I saw them live several times.....Roth is a proper jackass.....always has been, always will be.\n\nLast show I saw live happened to be the very last show of that tour and he was so drunk he forgot the words to several songs and eventually climed up on a speaker cabinet, layed down, refused to come down and refused to sing at all.\n\nHe resented Eddie Van Halen for his talent and mentally tortured him for that reason for years.\n\nA very small person with very little character IMO.\n\nSorry, just had to get that out.\n\n3 posted on by V_TWIN (America...so great even the people that hate it refuse to leave!)\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nUnderrated singer who can do any genre credibly, from blues to jazz to new wave.\n\n4 posted on by Behind Liberal Lines\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\nWhy would Eddie Van Halen allow that, since he was in charge?\n\n5 posted on by nickcarraway\n\nTo: stylecouncilor\n\nPing\n\n6 posted on by windcliff\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\n‚ÄúA third fan wrote, ‚ÄúTraveling back to the 80‚Äôs with Dave is a fun trip.‚Äù\n\nLike Dave said, in the 80s ‚ÄúThe Music Smiled, The Clothes Smiled, and the People Smiled‚Äù.\n\n7 posted on by dfwgator (Endut! Hoch Hech!)\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve heard, Eddie wasn‚Äôt the driving force, it was Alex. Eddie just wanted to play and not deal with the drama.\n\n8 posted on by Fuzz\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nWell, they did eventually kick Roth out of the band, much like another primadonna Dennis DeYoung of Styx, they probably had the band believing they couldn‚Äôt make it without ‚Äòem. Both bands finally had enough and found more agreeable bandmates.\n\nStyx got Lawrence Gowan and VH got Sammie Hagar.....very similar scenarios IMO.\n\nI saw a documentary recently about Roth and in it Valerie Bertinelli had some choice things to say about that joker.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not attacking roths singing ability....but his behavior doesn‚Äôt overcome being a total A-hole....not to me anyway.\n\n9 posted on by V_TWIN (America...so great even the people that hate it refuse to leave!)\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nHe is weird as hell. I grew up loving VH but could never stand Roth. He just comes across as phony and not genuine. It‚Äôs like he is playing diamond dave not that he really is Diamond Dave.\n\n10 posted on by 1malumprohibitum\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\nI‚Äôm not really a fan, but I though Roth left because they were becoming too keyboardy, then Eddie asked Patty Smyth to be the singer.\n\n11 posted on by nickcarraway\n\nThe tune is accompanied by a video featuring two Styrofoam mannequin heads. One of the mannequin heads resembles Roth and is wearing a headset microphone and wraparound sunglasses. The second head has female features, has bottlecaps for eyes, and is mottled with pink paint.\n\nVideo destroyed music ...\n\n12 posted on by bankwalker (Repeal the 19th ...)\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\nYes, but for their audience, wasn‚Äôt that a feature, not a bug?\n\n13 posted on by nickcarraway\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\n14 posted on by Dalberg-Acton\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\n‚Äúfor their audience, wasn‚Äôt that a feature, not a bug?‚Äù\n\nLike I said, not when you pay your hard earned money for a ticket only to see the lead singer so drunk he can‚Äôt sing....40 years later and that STILL pisses me off....obviously. lol!\n\n15 posted on by V_TWIN (America...so great even the people that hate it refuse to leave!)\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\nEnjoyed his voice on several songs and when he went solo\n\nI had tickets for a concert in 1984\n\nThe Marine I worked next to told me he‚Äôd seen them before and that the show was awful\n\nWell I had already bought the tickets\n\nI went don‚Äôt remember who I took\n\nThey pretty much just jacked around on stage - I have told people that it was the worst concert I ever saw\n\nI was surprised\n\n16 posted on by SaveFerris (Luke 17:28 ... as it was in the Days of Lot; They did Eat, They Drank, They Bought, They Sold ......)\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nNo, roths official statement was he ‚Äúwanted more control‚Äù got frustrated and left VH....that I DO believe......narcissists are very often control freaks.\n\nSorry if I hijacked your post my friend but I lived VH first hand as I was in my 20s, very much into 80s rock and remember it very well.\n\nRoth reminds me of problem child athletes that have exceptional talent....their behavior is very often overlooked because they can perform.\n\n17 posted on by V_TWIN (America...so great even the people that hate it refuse to leave!)\n\nTo: SaveFerris\n\nThe Marine I worked with who sat next to me told me\n\nOops üò¨\n\n18 posted on by SaveFerris (Luke 17:28 ... as it was in the Days of Lot; They did Eat, They Drank, They Bought, They Sold ......)\n\nTo: V_TWIN\n\nhe is talented, but he would have gotten farther had he gotten a little humble.\n\nIt was too much, like he had no sense of when enough was enough\n\n19 posted on by Mr. K (No consequence of repealing Obamacare is worse than Obamacare)\n\nTo: nickcarraway\n\nNot a lot of point to his doing this except maybe that he wanted to. He brings nothing to it.\n\n20 posted on by TalBlack (I We have a Christian duty and a patriotic duty.
