(Keith photo) 250 New Students Arrive; Become Orientated in Four Days The Fall semester began last Thursday with the arrival of most of the 250 new students. A small army of upperclassmen greeted the new students and directed them to their see 'times temporary and sometimes pen..,jient rooms, an- swered the barrage of questions and lent a hand with luggage. The Orientation crew under the di- rection of William B. Davis, Director of Student Personnel and Richard Gendreau, of the physical education department, worked all week-end at getting new students acquainted with the campus. Thursday, evening new students heard an address by the President of the College, Dr. Robert E. Long and Dean Robert T. Rickert. Friday the students were intro- duced to the curriculum of the col- lege by four divisional chairmen. The rest of the day was spent in math-science placement test and meetings with advisers. Friday night, H. Franklin Baker, HI, of the English department, en- tertained in Bole Hall. On Saturday, William B. Davis, Di- rector of Student Personnel, ad- dressed the assembly on students af- fairs and regulations. All freshmen and new students spent the rest get- ting registered for classes for the fall semester. On Sunday, President Thomas Ragle, of Marlboro College addressed the group. Monday, the orientated freshmen and new students watched as upper- classmen moved in and tried to get registered. '67 VERLYN Is Scheduled For Delivery in Two Weeks The 1966-67 Verlyn is scheduled to arrive and be ready for distribution the third week in September. This year the yearbook staff elected to have a fall delivery date. This practice will be continued with the 1967-68 Verlyn. Fall delivery means that each graduating class can have pictures of its own graduation included in the yearbook. The Verlyn will be mailed to all seniors who graduated last year. All other copies of the books will be dis- tributed at the college from the pub- lications office. All returning students, faculty and staff will be issued books first and freshmen and transfer students may pick up a copy of the yearbook if they want one, as long as they last. This year, individual pictures of all students, faculty and staff members will be re-made. The pictures made last year were not deemed sufficient Photographers from the Leslie Stu- dio in Concord, N. H. will make all yearbook pictures this year. Last Thursday, two photographers were on campus to photograph all faculty and staff members. They will return in January to photograph all students. All students will be notified by card of their appointment with the photographer. As last year there will be no charge for having pictures made. This year the 1967-68 Verlyn will be enlarged to 150 pages, as com- pared to last year's size of 120. Also this year, the staff will go to what is called the collegiate size yearbook, eight and one-half inches by eleven inches. Also included in the 1968 Verlyn will be colored pictures and an ex- panded student life section. The 1968 Verlyn co-editors are Joan Curtis and Linda Hunicke. THE LYNDON STATE Critic VOLUME III, NUMBER 1 The LYNDON CRITIC SEPTEMBER 12, 1967 Largest Enrollment in LSC History As 550 Students Begin Classes Lyndon State College officially opened the 1967-68 school year yes- terday with registration for all up- perclassmen. With a total of 550 students ex- pected to register, it is the largest en- rollment in the history of the college. Of the 550 students, 200 are fresh- men attending college for the first time and 50 are transfer students with advanced standing entering LSC for the first time. Returning stu- dents number about 300, according to William B. Davis, Director of Admissions. Of the 250 students, 60 per cent are male and 40 per cent are female. Telephone Registration Registration also took on a new look this year with the installation of the \"Telephone Registration.\" All students were assigned to four divisional chairmen, Esther Bussell, of the education department; Mary F. Bisson, of the English department; Graham Newell, of the social science department and Paul Stockwell of the science department. The choices were called to a main registration office in classroom B, after working out his schedule for the coming semester. If classes were not filled the student was then fully en- rolled with only his adviser signing his card. After his choices were confirmed over the telephone, students picked up their class entrance slips in Mrs. Stevens' office. Freshmen and transfer students ar- rived on campus four days earlier than upperclassmen and participated in a program of orientation. All freshmen and transfer students registered for classes on Saturday. At the same time, freshmen ar- rived, 60 seniors, who are now in the field student teaching, were finishing a three-day workshop on campus un- der the direction of Mrs. Doris Wells, of the education department. This year for the first time, the college also had a faculty orientation conference. Fourteen new faculty members and a new director of the library and all returning faculty members met for two days in the main lobby of Vail. Pres. Thomas Ragle Concludes 1967-68 Orientation Program Thomas B. Ragle, President of Marlboro College since 1958, was the keynote speaker as the college closed its orientation program for 1967-68. The largest entering class in the history of the college heard Presei- dent Ragle last Sunday afternoon at 2:00 p. m. in the college library. President Ragle, who spoke on lib- eral education, was bom in Boston, Mass. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard College in 1949 and in 1951 received his B.A. degree from Oxford Univer- sity in English language and litera- ture. He also received his Master of Arts degree from there in 1954. Before becoming the president of Marlboro College in 1958 he was an instructor in English at PhiUips Exe- ter Academy. President Ragle is also the presi- dent of the Vermont Foundation of Independent Colleges, a member of the Brattleboro Adult Education Pro- gram, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Stowe School and a member of the Franconia College Advisory Board. His address officially closed the orientation program. 14 Teachers and Library Director 'On Board' For '67 School Year Fourteen new faculty members and a new director of the library joined the staff of the college this year. Edward Robert Sperry, Jr. became director of the Samuel Read Hall Li- brary replacing Daniel Clark. Before coming to Lyndon, Sperry served as law reference librarian at New York University. He received his AB degree with honors in psychology from the Uni- versity of Florida in 1953, and his Master of Arts degree from Florida State University in 1957. He received his Master of Science in Library Science from Florida State University. He has worked as a librarian at the University of Florida, Caney Junior College, Kansas State University and at Valparaiso University. Sperry taught at Sampson Air Force Base and at Oak Ridge Mili- tary Institute. Philosophy Courses Added Kenneth D. Vos will teach philoso- phy, along with several English courses this fall. This will be the first time formal course work in philosophy has been introduced at the college. A graduate of Central College, Pella, Iowa, Vos received his BA de- gree in English literature and philoso- phy in 1952. He received his Bachelor of Divin- ity degree in 1955 from New Bruns- wick Theological Seminary. At pres- ent he is a Ph.D. candidate in a joint program at Union Theological Sem- inary and Columbia University. Vos has published two articles, \"Albert Camus\" and \"Myth, Symbol and Language in Recent Religious Thought.\" Music Adds One Alvin Shulman will join the music department to replace Paul Dorsam. Arthur Hamalainen This past year Shulman served as as- sistant principal violinist for the New Orleans Philharmonic. Shulman has attended Queens Col- lege, New York and Antioch College, and in 1962 received his BA degree in theory and violin from City Col- lege of New York. In 1965 he received his Master of Music with a violin major from the Yale University School of Music. This past summer he participated in the Dartmouth College Congregation of the Arts. Mrs. Joyce Vos, wife of the new philosophy teacher, will teach voice part-time for the department. Two Added To Three Two new members were added to the social science department, educa- tion department and mathematics de- partment. William A. Oates, Jr. and James E. Pooley will join the four-man so- cial science department. Pooley is associate professor of classics (emeritus) at the University of Vermont and will serve as a part-time lecturer in history. He resides in Burlington and will commute to the college. Oates, whose specialty is Southeast Asia, received his BA degree from Yale College in 1958 with a major in political and economic institutions. In 1962 he received his Master of Arts degree in Southeast Asia studies from Yale University. At the present time he is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Yale and ex- pects to complete his degree this fall. The education department will add Dn Arthur Hamalainen and Ralph G. Wright to make it the second largest department in the college. Dr. Hamalainen has been in edu- cation for 36 years. A native of New York state, he received his BS degree in education from Syracuse Univer- sity, and his Ph.D. from Teachers (Con't. p. 4) Page Two The LYNDON CRITIC SEPTEMBER 12, 1967 Lyndon State College THE CRITIC COMMENTS Seldom Witty or Profound But. . . Stitt Asking Questions Seldom witty, rarely profound, only occsaionally relevant, and almost al- ways illiterately conceived, the essay appearing in this region of the \"Lyn- don State Critic\" each week will rep- resent the thoughts and opinions of its editor. These essays, barring some misfor- tune or change in plan, will number thirty. They will deal with divers subjects, ranging from the atrocious war in Viet Nam to problems here at Lyndon State College. During weaker moments our words may ring with authority, perhaps proving true the adage, \"It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.\" For with no experience to back it up, a claim to authority becomes merely a sign of immaturity. The nature of wisdom being what it is, perhaps it is safer for a man never to become content that he has even a small clue to \"the answer,\" re- gardless of his experience patterns. Imagine, for instance, the shock of a poor, elderly, church-going Chris- tian, who, upon awaking early some morning, suddenly sees the mythologi- cal Phaethon being helplessly whip- ped about the sky in an out-of-con- trol chariot being pulled by a team of wild flying horses! Granted this spec- tacle might even send the most stable, open minded man in the world run- ning to a head shrinker for psyche re- pairs, but the poor devout Christian would be utterly destroyed on the spot. It is interesting to note that even philosophers have weak moments, moments of immodesty. Wrote Fran- cis Bacon in his The Advancement of Learning: \"It is my intention to make the circuit of knowledge, notic- ing what parts lie waste and unculti- vated, and abandoned by the industry of man; with a view to engage, by a faithful mapping out of the deserted tracts, the energies of public and pri- vate persons in their improvement.\" Making a \"circuit of knowledge,\" even in Bacon's day would indeed LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS have been an impossible chore. Such is the sort of rut in which we often find ourselves. When all of the little blocks seem to fit nicely to- gether into one simple form, perhaps it is time they were knocked down and rebuilt into a new and different form. And so it should be with the thoughts expressed each week in this space. Our remarks will seldom be witty, rarely profound, only occas- ionally relevant, and usually delivered illiterately. But we will try to remain humble. L. W. LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS For Lang's Sake Another Universal Question: Just How Do Hippies Eat? ,l 0UT &URELY YOU COULP MAKE 50ME .EXCEPTION IN AN BAAEPSENCY?\" Ml CRITIC STAFF NEWS PUBLICATION PRESS Member of Qp Associated Collegiate LYNDON STATE COLLEGE Press Editor-in-Chief Lauren Welch Feature Editor David Lang Business Manager Rose Aleta Milton News Editor Stephen Keith Sports Editor Martin Noble Managing Editor Betty M. Rickert Faculty Adviser William B. Davis One of the multi-problems that has been perplexing me for some time centers around that strange group who call themselves, or are known as, \"Hippies.\" This prob- lem has not been tearing at my soul or driving me to drink, but I would like to have an answer. Simply stated, how do the hippies sustain themselves? Where do they find the means — primarily monetary — to keep themselves fed? Square as I am, I can still see that it takes more than drugs, sex, and spontaneity to keep the human ma- chine — even in the form of an extra- human hippy — in working order (will all hippies listening please excuse the reference to working?). Ironically, hippies also must have the equivalent of at least two \"squares\" a day; they are compelled by nature to conform in at least that department. Hippies do appear to be much dif- ferent from the \"beatniks\" of yore and the \"teeny-boppers\" of contem- porary society. Compared to the hippies, the beatniks were really quite conservative. They detested all forms of manual labor, true enough, but they consistently had to revert to it in order to prevent starvation. Even if this labor came only in the forms of guitar-twanging in local hot spots, posing as artists' models (i. e., as people who stand around letting other people draw pictures of them), or giving interviews (paid) to psychol- ogists and magazine reporters — the labor still came. On the other side of the coin, the teeny-boppers are just a scaled-down version of the more aristocratic, and now passe, \"Jet Set.\" The latter had lots of money (both inherited and la- boriously earned) and spent it freely (an understatement). The t-b's have less loot per individual but more overall — the t-b's outnumber the j-s's a thousand to one — but the money is still available. So, how do the hippies do it? They can't all be rolling in mon- ey. It is doubtful that any great metropolitan centers or small burgs in the sticks would be so charitable as to supply this small but expensive group with regular welfare checks, especially when most of the hippies have at least the equivalent of a high school education and are thus quite job-eligible. It is also doubtful that a small number of John Beresford Tiptons are generously sponsoring the hippy movement. A hippy may be able to sleep in a doorway or on the streets, use public facilities, and keep warm on a cigar- ette lighter; but drugs cost money, whether it is \"acid\" made in a uni- versity lab by an avaricious chemis- try major or \"pot\" dispensed by the local pusher. Occasionally a hippy may have to buy a few clothes or rags, to keep the cold and the police away. Also, the common guitar, a vital necessity, may become too battered to hold a string taut, and a less battered one might well cost a few pence. The hippy is thus caught in that the Establishment — the need for most horrible of the evil clutches of money. The lack of garden area and wild animals (of the lower species) in the middle of Los Angeles makes money a necessity for all. Most of the people earn it or have it provided by estate or insurance. Most of the rest can claim and re- ceive welfare help because of ab- sence of education or overabundance of children. This would seem to leave the edu- cated, independent hippies as fig- ments of imagination; but, because they surely exist, they can only be explained by the possible uses of \"dissenter\" and \"indolent\" as satis- factory reasons on a welfare ques- tionnaire. Mild Mannered Reporter The Hill: Our Own Little Buffer Zone The first day of classes is indeed start of another \"chapter\" in one's an important day. It symbolizes the education, the rediscovery of the col- lege-way-of-life, and the realization of how large Vail Hill is. To get to Lyndon State College, one usually first arrives via automo- bile or at best powered wheels, but in the days following arrival, many students, indeed the vast majority, trudge up and down 'tween Vail and 'Ville wearing leather thin and deep- ly appreciating the difference be- tween hill and mountain. One might derive special signifi- cance from this mile-and-a-half walk, most of it ascending. The distance is a sort of buffer zone or at times a no-man's land to isolate the college and provide the special atmosphere which allows the students and faculty to be \"away from it all,\" indeed, the administra- tion does not enjoy this status. A college with the varied person- alities of LSC needs an eggshell-like X-Factor which on weekends be- comes unavoidably predominant. Ours is the Hill. The freshmen and new students are certainly aware of this situation by now, and may have revolted at the possibilities of such circumstances. Pity. The quality of being apart from all else, even though only a psychologi- cal reaction to the hilltop surround- ings, is one of Lyndon's most prec- ious assets. The returning upper- classmen know about this, and only a few shortsighted individuals com- plain about \"nothing to do on top of Mt. Everest.\" Far from a disadvantage, the situa- tion gives Lyndon an early morning sun, late sunset, and a fantabulous view that is unmatched at any other State College. The Hill may be evil in February but during October and May, the Hill is well worth having, even if we have minor problems during the win- ter months. Vail Hill is part of Lyndon State College and a vital ingredient with- out which, Lyndon would sink to the level of another UVM or other cam- pus engulfed by communities and their individuality crushed by the growth of towns, whose people didn't care much for the college anyway. SK SEPTEMBER 12, 1967 The LYNDON CRITIC Page Three Entering freshmen line-up to register for their dorm rooms on Thursday in Vail Lobby. About 200 students entered the college this week for the first time. (Keith photo) Abolish Student Deferments: As Other College Papers See It (ACP) — President Johnson recently canceled plans for this fall's college deferment tests in a move preliminary to a decision on whether to continue student deferments. The following editorial from the State Press, Arizona State University, Tempe, looks at the pros and cons of the current and pro- posed draft systems. To university students, the most important of the far-reaching reforms proposed by the President's special Commission on the Selective Service is the discontinuation of under-grad- uate deferments. Thus, students would receive the same draft con- sideration as factory workers, file clerks, and ditch diggers. Not sur- prisingly, this recommendation has not been met with universal glee. According to Joe College, a stu- dent is trying to better himself and make an invaluable contribution to his country as one of its intellectual leaders. The poor wretch who is either too stupid or too poor to make it to college is the logical draft choice, says Joe. Perhaps Joe is right, but he might get an argument from Poor Wretch. But avoid for the moment any value judgment concerning who is the more logical draft choice and look at the proposals objectively. The question of student deferments is not black and white. Both the present system and the proposed re- forms have advantages. It is neces- sary, therefore, to construct something of a balance sheet. On the credit side of the present system is the protection from the Mrs. Doris Wells, of the education department, and Steve Metz, work on plans for student teaching. Under Mrs. Wells' direction about 60 seniors participated in a student teaching workshop last week in the library. The 60 seniors are now all over the state in their new student teaching assignments. draft, at least temporarily, of hun- dreds of students who sincerely seek a higher education and have the abil- ity to make the most of it. The mili- tary can offer them nothing, and they can offer the military little except a healthy serving of resentment at the imposition. There are two distinct debits. First, the deferment is only temporary. When a student's education is com- pleted, his age makes him more than ever ripe for the plucking. He is eager to begin his career, but he is likely to be drafted. Second, the present system encour- ages the hanger-on: the guy who comes to school with no intention of offering the university anything and who takes nothing from it except a diploma; the guy who makes it through the graduation on the skin of his teeth and his roommmate's notes: the guy who shudders every time he sees a uniform; the university para- site. Contrast the proposed reforms. Debit: There would be virtually no student deferments; thus, many po- tentially fine students would be drafted. Credit: Once a student makes it past his 19th birthday, in all likelihood he will escape the draft and make plans for his future with confidence. Instead of two or three years of anxious uncertainty, only his 19th year will be tense. Since being a student will not in itself offer any favorable considera- tion from the draft board, the draft dodger will find no advantage in ex- pending the minimum effort required to get through school and thus will not burden the university with his presence. The loss will be the gain of all sincerely dedicated students. Don Picard Named Top Athlete by VSSA Don Picard of Winooski and Lyn- don State College, who has made a name for hunself this summer in the Cape Cod Summer Collegiate Base- ball League was recently elected July Athlete of the Month by the Vermont Sportswriters and Sportscasters Asso- ciation. Picard was a former Winooski High standout during the Spartan cham- pionship days. More recently he played outstand- ing baseball as he led the LSC Hor- net pitching staff to a New England championship. Picard's top competition in the bal- loting came from Arnold Chandler, 1967 Vermont State Amateur Golf champion, who made a spectacular comeback to overcome Rick Smith in the finals. This & That by George Spelvin Heard about the campus the last 5 days: Who is Mr. Staff? Did you see that freshman girl . . .? Temporary, it had better be temporary. Look fast, Mom, you'll never recognize him after a semester of educa- tion and no haircuts. Gee, what a quaint old farmhouse .... Where is the lobby from here? Whatever you do, schedule all 10 o'clock classes and you can sleep late. Where do you go for fun? Who's that guy over there? When do we eat? Do you think there are any hippies here? Why can't I major in music and art? All my courses come at 11:10 a. m. Answer that phone. No, History of Western Civ is closed. No, we don't offer courses in football, try Notre Dame. \"And now I would like to introduce the Senior Serpent, to be followed immediately by the Snake in the Grass.\" I've only been here for three hours and I miss mother already. Where is room TBA? SOME MINOR OBSERVATIONS: Those students who dislike the college the most are always the first to return. Ultimations will get you absolutely no place fast. It's much more fun to be a sophomore than a freshman. Now there are three people on campus who talk funny. When do classes start for all the Alumni that keep showing up? The only real \"night spot\" in the 'Ville is the Fruity Store. WANTED: Nice, quiet jobs in warm climate. Salary not important. Please contact Davis, Rickert and Long immediately.

Jonathan Arnold The first building in the complex will be named for Jonathan Arnold (1741-1793) who was the founder- proprietor of the towns of St. Johns- bury and Lyndon. Arnold was also the author of Rhode Island's repealer of the oath of allegiance to England on May 4, 1776, two months before the U. S. Declaration of Independence. He served as a delegate from Rhode Is- land to the Continental Congress where he argued against the New York and New Hampshire claims upon Vermont. During the Revolutionary War, Arnold organized and was surgeon of the Rhode Island Revolutionary Hospital. After the war Arnold established himself in Vermont where he was a member of the Assembly which vot- ed to accept Vermont's membership in the Union. He was an early trus- tee of the University of Vermont. Jacob Bayley The second building will be named Bayley Hall for Jacob Bayley (1726- 1815) who was Commissary-General of the Continental Army. He found- ed the town of Newbury and was considered to be Washington's clos- est friend in Northern New England. In Vermont history, Bayley is com- monly associated with the Bayley- Hazen Road, a military road begun in 1776 from the Connecticut to northwest Vermont. During the pe- riod of the Vermont Republic (1777- 1791) he was the most influential member of the east side faction. Robert Rogers The third dormitory will be called Rogers Hall for Robert Rogers (1731- 1795). Major Rogers of New Hamp- shire scouted this area of the state in the Fifties, and came to be re- garded as the best scout of the Brit- ish forces during the French and In- dian War. After the St. Francis Raid in 1759, he returned to New England by way of Lake Memphremagog and the Northeast Kingdom. Rogers was branded a Loyalist during the Revo- lution. Later he became connected with the effort to discover a North- west Passage. Luke Poland The last building in the complex will be named for Luke Potter Poland (1815-1887) of St. Johnsbury. As a member of Congress from 1867-1875 he did much to right the wrongs of the Reconstruction Period and was a key figure in the investigation of the Ku Klux Klan and the Credit Mobil- ier Scandal. Poland was largely responsible for the codification of the laws of the United States, published in 1875. Weekly Bulletin SEPT. 12 All classes begin. SEPT. 22 Last day to add courses.

'Through A Glass Darkly 9 Theme For 1967-68 Opening Convocation \"Our task is to work with the real to produce the ideal,\" said Dr. Rob- ert E. Long, President of the college, in his annual convocation address yesterday. In delivering his \"state of the union\" address, Dr. Long pointed out that last year his vision was bright. This year, on a more conservative note, he had reversed his tenses. \"Then I saw face to face. Now I see through a glass darkly. Yet perhaps what I see reflected today in an imperfect academic mirror is an image with which we can work, which we can change, and which in time will be indistinguishable from the brightest vision.\" Dr. Long went on to say that image can be no more than the re- flection of a concrete thing, as ugly or as beautiful as the object itself. He said that the image of a col- lege is different for its president, its faculty, its staff and its students. His concern with the college image is with good reason, he said. \"Next May the evaluation committee of the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools will visit the school to see if the promise we show- ed in 1965 is being realized.\" \"How does the administration now view the college?\" he asked. \"First, Lyndon is a college that takes its educational mission serious- 46 Seniors Are In the Field 9 For Student Teaching Experience Forty-six seniors are away _ from campus this semester doing their stu- dent teaching. Under the direction of Mrs. Doris Wells, of the education department, the week before school started all seniors met at the college for a work- shop before going into \"the field.\" In October all 46 will return to campus for another week of work- shops before going to another as- signment. The majority of the 46 seniors are working in the Lyndonville-St. Johns- bury area. All 46 seniors will return to com- plete their college course work the second semester. Those students teaching in Lyn- donville include: Patricia Smith, Bar- bara LaBounty and David Marks at the Campus School; Nora LaCroix and Kathryn Blair at the Graded School; Joan Isham and Kenneth Ku- lis at the Corner School; Joan Curtis at Wheelock; Jean Zaun and James MacFarlane at Sutton; and Winfield Thomas at West Burke. In St. Johnsbury there is Cleona Ainsworth and Elizabeth Weitzel at the Lincoln School; Peggy Angelico and Marie Gustamachio at the Sum- mer Street School; Mary Gochie at the Arlington School; Linda Hunicke at the Community School and Paula Noble at the Center School. Others who are student teaching include: Sally Achilles at Waterford, Sharon Pelletier at East Concord, Gary Briggs at Gilman, Steven Metz and Lesley Dudley at the Hillside School in Newport, Walter Duttweil- er at Derby Line, George Woods at Glover, Claire Dunne at Barnet, Eliz- abeth Elsasser at Barnet Village, Elizabeth Sturges at West Barnet, Neil Valeriani at Newbury. Others include Mary Letko at the Thayer School in Burlington, Walter Thompson and Roger Bennett in Wilmington, Joseph Peterson, Frank Wilson at the Central School in Bel- lows Falls, Susan Dana at Saxton's River, Judy Gray and Marilyn Simp- son at Richford Elementary, Gunther Wernecke at Thetford, Darlene Kap- lan at Pawlet, Philip Marder at Dan- by Mt.

Six other seniors who have com- pleted their college course work are enrolled in a pilot internship program. The pilot program is set up so that students who have completed all course work except student teaching may become full-time teachers and practice teach at the same time. In all cases this year, the six will con- tinue in the same job after they com- plete their student teaching require- ments this semester. These six stu- dents will be closely supervised by Esther Bussell, chariman of the edu- cation department and Walter Hasen- fus, of the education department. This new program is based on the idea of graduate school where a stu- dent completes student teaching by taking a full-time job. The pilot program was conceived and worked with the cooperation and aid of the Vermont State Department of Education. Miss Esther Mesh State Helping Teacher, is also work- ing closely with the students as well as the principals, superintendents and regular teachers at the schools. The success of the program this year > will set the course for next year's program. Those seniors in the pilot program include: Mary Lunna in grade one in Barton, Richard Whitehill in lang- uage arts — grades 7 and 8 in Barton, Albert Lunna in science, math, social science in grades 6-8 in Glover, Phyl lis Amidon in grades one through three in Concord, Keith McPherson in grade six in Concord, and Victor Lewis in general science in grade nine at the North Country Union School. ly. Second, Lyndon is a college in which the individual is important. Third, This is a friendly college. In sum, the image we are seeking — and never forget that the image is but a shadow of the real thing — is that elusive goal of a community of schol- ars, of varying attainments, united, through respect for wisdom and ex- perience, in a common intellectual adventure.\" Long discussed his concern with the external constituency, \"the gener- al public,\" especially the proposed merger with UVM. Dr. Long feels we have had suc- cess on the state scene but we have somehow failed to make clear \"our right to develop into strong and in- dependent state colleges . . .\" \"Surely we have earned this by the progress recorded within the past ten years . . . \"Despite our development we seem fated to fend off a real threat to our valued institutional autonomy.\" Long closed by saying, \"Clearly I am opposed to the development of an institutional tie with the Univer- sity which will in any way diminish the academic and fiscal autonomy of Lyndon.\" \"I firmly believe that maximum I stitutions, then possible freedom for the college to | let's get to it.\" develop its own philosophy, program, and image will produce our finest contribution to general higher edu- cation, and I have heard no rational argument to persuade me to the con- trary. If such argument were to be couched in terms of economics to be achieved through organic union, I would be highly skeptical. Indeed I am positive that to maintain under any other organizational terms an educational program of the quality of that which Lyndon now follows would in fact be far more costly.\" \"At the base of the issue is this: in the special calling which we all follow, whether as teachers or stu- dents, the formulation, direction, and implementation of educational policy best resides as close to the teaching process as administrative practicality allow. To place control over these vital areas in super-administrations and super-boards is seriously to com- promise the effectiveness of good and imaginative instruction and learn- ing on the college campus. If this is what the current suggestions pro- pose, then I am against them.\" \"If on the other hand, all that is being sought is fruitful cooperation among self-respecting educational in- I am for that. And Student Moving Days Ahead As Poland, Arnold, Rogers Open By Steve Keith The use of Vail Manor as a dormi- tory facility will end this semester. The seventy year old mansion which houses the administration of- fices and several classrooms as well as many faculty offices will be termi- nated from dorm use as Arnold, Rog- ers and Poland Residence Halls are opened for use during the next three months. Arnold Residence Hall is scheduled for opening to men students on Octo- ber first. The four story structure will house 66 men and the first floor will offer a student lounge and the power plant for the entire southeast complex. The first of November should mark completion of one of the two east- ernmost residence halls, either Rogers or Poland. By December first, all LSC stu- dents should be housed in modern dormitories, though the Burklyn campus may be kept in use through- out this semester, due to final exams interfering with any moving activ- ity which might be under way at that time. William B. Davis, Director of Stu- dent Personnel, noted progress on Arnold Hall was consistent with his previous predictions and that the Oct. 1 date was not unrealistic. The eventual purpose of Bayley Hall is to be a second women's resi- dence, the men now occupying the building being placed in either Po- land or Rogers Halls. Bayley Hall contains the Head Residents quarters, occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Arthur F. Costantini, of the college's psycholo- gy department. At the time of the transition of Bayley from men students to Lyn- don's finest, Wheelock Residence Hall will be reduced to its originally planned occupancy of 112 women. For the past two years of operation, the plant has housed at times more than 140 co-eds. With Wheelock housing 112 stu- dents, and the newer buildings hand- ling 242, the total on-campus popu- lation may reach 354 students during the Spring, 1968 semester. Services On Sunday For Franklin Spear Franklin Spear, a junior at Lyndon State College from Wells River, Vt„ was found dead at a summer cottage on Lake Gardner, Bath, N. H. on Saturday. Dr. Paul Choate, medical referee from Monroe, said Spear had appar- ently been dead since last Tuesday. Dr. Choate listed the cause of death as \"apparently an accidentally self-inflicted gunshot wound.\" Spear had enrolled for his classes at the college earlier this week and disappeared on Tuesday night. Last December, Spear was named to the WCAX-TV All-State Soccer Team for his outstanding play on the Lyndon team. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Spear of Wells River. Funeral services were held on Sunday at 3 p. m. at his home in Wells River. Page Two The LYNDON CRITIC SEPTEMBER 19, 1967 Lyndon State College THE CRITIC COMMENTS A Few Short Words on Dormitories And Twenty-one Wasted Years Despite the fact they are located too close to Samuel Reed Hall Li- brary, and Thadeus Stevens Dining Hall, and from an architectural point of view, are not at all suited to their beautiful Vermont hillside setting, the new dormitories are a decided improvement over the monstrosity that is Wheelock Hall. The floor plans are imaginative, and, it would seem, efficient. Rooms are irregularly shaped, creating an il- lusion of size, and providing maxi- mum space for the placement of desks and wardrobes (If they ever ar- rive!). Although the windows are small and do not take fullest advantage of the scenery surrounding the dormi- tories, cleverly, interior walls are be- ing painted white, making the best possible use of light coming in from outside. During the course of the coming year there will undoubtedly be com- plaints about living conditions within the new dormitories. This is prob- ably inevitable. There are basic dif- ferences in philosophy behind archi- tectural planning for institutional fa- cilities and planning for small resi- dential facilities. Few dormitories can be \"homes away from home.\" Some Thoughts on Age The Elizabethan playwright Chris- topher Marlowe, considered by many to be second in greatness as a drama- tist only to William Shakespeare, had a remarkably short length of time in which to establish such a reputation. Marlowe lived only from 1564 until 1592, producing his greatest work, \"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,\" sometime between 1589 and 1592. Poet John Keats died in 1821 at the age of 26. Yet within that short life span Keats was able to produce works which have established him as a major English poet. A child prodigy, Wolfgang Mozart Mild Mannered Reporter Some Very Nice Buildings, But What A Rough Transition Times are rough. Times are very rough. For the past two weeks, the dorm- itory situaiton has steadily grown worse. The situation has seemed to reach a leveling-off point and might become better within another two weeks, but for the most part, dormi- tory conditions have been unclean, overcrowded and noisy. The present conditions exist due to several factors. The campus is in the middle of its three phase build- ing program with the second phase behind schedule. The men's dorm known as Mason's House was with- drawn from use during the summer of 1967 due to living conditions at that location and anticipation of the completion of the southeast campus by September first. The most crucial factor underlying the mess we now have is a ruling by the Board of Trus- tees of the Vermont State Colleges that all dormitories must be filled to capacity and no off-campus housing permissions will be allowed until the 100% occupancy of college facilities is reached. The ruling concerning 100% occu- pancy is the killer. Someone on the Board of Trus- tees or someone who has helped in the planning of these facilities was very shortsighted. Had the figure of 100% been low- er, the Director of Student Personnel, William B. Davis, could have allowed up to 50 students to live in the neigh- boring villages during a portion of this semester or perhaps even the en- tire fall semester. This would have allowed Vail and Burklyn dormitories to handle the influx of students with- out the atrocious overcrowding which has existed the past few days. Any figure below that uncompromising 100% would have allowed Davis to permit many students to live with reasonable discomfort within build- ings unfit for human habitation, but with the excess students living in town. The move to the new dorms would have been simplified . . . but not so. The administration of Lyndon State College must follow orders from the Board of Trustees, the Pro- vost of the colleges and the admin- istration has. The authorities who have issued the unrealistic policy of full occupan- cy should re-examine their motives and consider for a moment the nine students in Vail room #3 who are living in the same quarters occupied by three men at one time last semester. It's a wonder LSC hasn't had a mass meeting to demand better con- ditions or a closing of the dorms un- til such time as the situation changes. It's a wonder Director of Student Personnel Davis hasn't died from ex- haustion or given up in disgust. This, however, hasn't happened Davis is very tolerant. He deserves a raise, a botde of An- acin and 550 Get- Well cards. If we all survive Those Rotten Weeks In The Fall, a celebration will be in order. When barracks become suites, when Vail is quiet and the southeast campus is occupied, reason will have triumphed over insanity. began composing symphonies at the age of eight, and operas at the age of twelve. Early in his life he be- came proficient as a violinist, an or- ganist, and as a harpsichordist. As a lad, the Austrian composer demon- strated his remarkable talents before many leading European aristocratic figures of his day. And here are we — nearly as old as the artists mentioned above when they produced their greatest works — unable to understand them, and ser- iously doubting that we can satis- factorily compose a five page paper due later this semester for \"Introduc- tion to Philosophy.\" _ LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS V&l\\DU&. HE SHOJLPMAWs A SFtENPIP APPITIONTOOIR mOJUY' For Langs Sake A Golden Opportunity: LSC All-Season Country Club Lyndon State College is faced with a golden opportunity — and, as usual, will probably be welcoming the wrong one. The location of the school is cer- tainly picturesque. The grounds are extensive and well landscaped. The mansion is, or should be, a lucrative attraction of great historical value. The other buildings are, well, ade- quate for housing and serving human beings. There is more than ample parking space and we are well sup- plied with attendants and various facilities. So what are we in the \"education\" business for? There isn't even a dol- lar to be gained — by faculty, head office, or, esp., ambitious students — from the big business of school in a little place like Vermont. A little thought and planning in the right direction would reveal how everyone here might become a mil- lionaire with just a little hard work. It wouldn't take much revamping to turn this poverty-ridden, state-con- trolled institution into a very inde- pendent and wealthy all-season coun- try club. A one-and-a-half mile race track could be looped around those two huge soccer-baseball fields. From the multi-million dollar grandstand- casino-and-betting-area (a la Rock- ingham), thousands and thousands of daily customers would pay happily and handsomely for their choices of entertainment, including roulette wheels and card games, horse racing, baseball and soccer games, and night clubs. After the passing of the short sum- mer, we would still continue making millions, thanks to a skier's paradise. Long ski trails would extend from the exclusive little gray chalet on top of the hill right down across the road and almost into the village. Skating and hockey enthusiasts would also feel right at home. In fact, every sport imaginable would be offered, bar all expenses. Cro- quet, curling, and cricket will be of- fered. Professional basketball, foot- ball, and tennis will certainly not be omitted. Any visitor will find to his delight that all sports activities — spectator and participant, individual and team — common to every country in the world — will have found their way into the Lyndon Sports Club curricu- lum. No expense is to be spared in order that the customer gets exactly what he wants. From all appearances, this is the only process by which LSC will be- come world-famous. Education, once an honorable and very worthwhile democratic undertaking, has given up its corny ghost to the more modem, profitable, \"cool\" business of institu- tional sports. Compared to present-day amateur collegiate athletics, the professional sports world is really a pauper. Most countries have huge state-subsidized athletic programs at every academic level. This country will soon have to follow suit, in order to stay in step. Chances are that college sports will one day become so all-inclusive of the student body that the staid old edu- cational process will be entirely for- gotten. If fortune wins out, some enterpris- ing souls will in turn discover a bril- liant new money-making scheme — called academics.

Franklin Baker, III, of the English department, will begin very shortly to produce a weekly radio show. Called, \"Lyndon State College Pre- sents An Experiment in Radio,\" the show will be aired over two local sta- tions, WTWN in St. Johnsbury and WIRE in Newport. Coverage will reach the entire Northeast Kingdom from Sherbrooke, Canada to Little- ton, N. H. The program will be on every Sat- urday morning from 9:30 A. M. to 10:00 A. M. Format for the show will be \"loose\" and will include a large variety of features. Some of the features are interviews with students and faculty, dramatic readings, music taped from concerts here on campus, sports and a regular feature called Campus Cal- endar. The Campus Calendar will be to list and announce those events tak- ing place on the campus in coming weeks. Baker stated the purpose of the program was to train students in an- nouncing, news writing and gather- ing and production of shows for radio. The programs will be taped a few days in advance although some por- tions may be \"live\" to get in any last minute news and events. Expenses for the show will be pick- ed up by the stations or by a local business which may want to sponsor the show. soccer fundamentals for the past week. Bell plans to field a team includ- ing senior goalie, Bruce Aschenbach; veteran fullback, Dave Saddlemire; and junior wing, Ed Beir. The re- mainder of the positions are up for grabs to the underclassmen and the transfer students. Senior, Ed \"Whale\" Schepp and juniors, Jack Strong, Ken Kaplan, and Gerry Forgett are probable starters in tomorrow's tilt, while transfer, Dan Ballentine and freshman, Silvio Tedi- schi are scheduled to see much action. When asked to make some early predictions, Coach Bell replied that he is \"cautiously optimistic\" and that \"barring injuries, we will come up with a speedy and aggressive line and a defense which should hold its own.\" — Must Rebuild — Bell also noted that this is the fifth consecutive season in which he has been forced to rebuild a completely new front line. This in itself, is enough reason for Bell's conservative optimism. Through various means, Coach Bell has lost the services of such stand- outs as leading scorers, Jeff Brash and Doug Meade; goalie, Keith Clayton; and would be veterans, Stan Spencer, Charlie Norris, Steve Metz, Mark Bo- vier, Butch Maxfield, and Jack Roberts. The previously mentioned formed the nucleus of a fine winning team which last year traveled to the New England finals of the NAIA (Nation- al Association of Intercollegiate Ath- letics) playoffs while compiling 10-3- 1 record, best in the school's history. The loss of so many valuable assets, places added importance on tomor- row's scrimmage.

All electrical equipment, including heat, lights and the emergency lighting system, will be handled from this huge circuit box in the basement of Arnold Hall. Arnold Hall, which is due to be completed in about a week, also houses the heating plant for the entire new dormitory complex. Telephones to all suites will be out of the main complex in Vail. Bayley Hall now houses 55 men students who moved in over the past two weekends. The new dorm has five suites with 11 men in each suite. It also contains the apartment of the resident directors, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Costantini. Arnold will house the main reception hall for all the dorms in the complex. Workmen continue their laying of blue stone around the huge courtyard that connects the four dormitories. Very shortly street lights will be installed around the courtyard and flowers will be planted in the center circle of the yard. It promises to be one of the most attractive spots on campus when completed. Due to the delay in shipping of some of the furniture, those 55 students now living in Bayley are living out of a suitcase. It is hoped that new ward- robes, desks and lights will be in soon so that living will become \"normal.\" The furniture for the dorms was specifically designed and manufactured for the new dormitories.

House Education Committee Holds Meeting On LSC Campus The House Education Committee was on campus last week for a meeting. As guest of Rep. Graham Newell and the college, 10 members of the 11-man committee toured the campus, visited at Burklyn and then had lunch in the Thaddeus Stevens Dining Hall. In the afternoon the Committee met in the library to discuss one of the bills to be put before the House. The bill considered is to create a New Hampshire-Vermont interstate school compact. The bill will come before the House when it meets in January of 1968. Rep. Newell is chairman of the Social Science department here at the college. Construction Starts Oct. 1 On New Activities Building Construction is slated to begin October first on the academic activ- ities building. H. P. Cummings Construction Company of Massachusetts was the low bidder for the job. The two and one-half million dol- lar complex will house LSC's auditor- ium, science labs, and music facilities. The sprawling series of buildings will eventually cover the top of the hill which extends from the present gymnasium to the north road of the soccer field, and will connect with a future student activities building near the present cafeteria. The entire series of buildings which will comprise the activities building will house the athletic de- partment, its gymnasium and squash courts, with a swimming pool. The music department will have practice rooms for individuals as well as special rooms for listening to re- cordings and facilities for washing instruments. The auditorium will be equipped with stage equipment for the Drama Club. The stage will have a portion which is able to revolve into the or- chestra pit, bringing the actors right into the center of the audience. The 350 seat auditorium will have two wings seating a hundred people each which opens into the main au- ditorium providing theatre space for 550 persons. The stage is sunk into the center of the auditorium, with the seats in back being well above the stage for better visibility. The Drama Club was consulted by the college and planners to try to customize the auditorium to the needs of a stage company. Scheduled for completion by 1969, the construction of the auditorium section should start by Oct. 1 of this year. THE LYNDON STATE Critic VOLUME III, NUMBER 3 The LYNDON CRITIC SEPTEMBER 26, 1967 Faculty-Student Council Shocked By In the Bed 9 Oryanizations Some people call it being \"in the red.\" Another term often used to de- scribe the phenomenon is \"in the hole.\" Whatever the term applied, it was revealed last week that several or- ganizations supported by student ac- tivities funds spent a non-existent $5,318.31 during the 1966-67 school year. This sobering fact was disclosed by Faculty-Student Council chairman William B. Davis at the first council meeting of the semester on Wednes- day. It is the responsibility of the Coun- cil to present an activities budget to the student body at a General Assem- bly later this fall. The student ac- tivities fund this year should contain about $20,000. The worst offender, the athletic association spent $1,884.05 over its 1966-67 allocation of $6,558. The \"Critic\" spent $1,689.24 over its $3000 budget. \"Verlyn\" costs were about $745 above the projected cost of $2,834. \"The Activities Committee,\" said Davis, \"was allocated $1500 for so- cial events. What they actually spent was just under $3000. Franklin Baker, advisor to the Committee explained, \"We founded our committee after the Bitter End Singer came.\" He said the commit- Richard Gendreau of the physical Doberczak Publishes Two Articles on Fibers Dr. Nicholas Doberczak, of the college's science department, recent- ly had two articles published. The first articles, \"Influence of Ammonia on the Mechanical Proper- ties of Wool Fibers,\" was published in Vol. VI of Proceeding, a publica- tion oS the Shevchenko Scientific Society. The second article was translated from Ukraninian and appeared in a book on cotton, bast and wool fi- bers for the Department of Agricul- ture and the National Science Foun- dation. Dr. Doberczak's portion of the book deals with animal fibers. Born in Ukraine, Dr. Doberczak holds a Diploma of Agrotechnic Sci- ences from LVIW Poltechnic Insti- tute in Ukraine and the degree of Doctor of Agrotechnic Sciences (Ph.D.) from Warsaw SGGW, Poland. He has done extensive research and publishing in the field of ani- mal fibers. Dr. Doberczak is a member of the Schevchenko Scientific Society, Inc. and the Ukraninian Free Scientific- Academy in U. S. A. He came to the college in 1962. tee had not been aware that the $1500 due the folk group would be taken from the committee's fund. The $5,318.31 deficit from last year, according to Davis, has already been paid from this year's fund. Davis pointed out that if the ath- letic association, the \"Critic,\" the \"Verlyn,\" and the Drama Club are allotted this year what they spent last year, the total would reach $16,700. This would not even take into ac- count smaller organizations which are given funds each year. Baker told the Council that the So- cial Activities Committee had held a meeting, and that members had ex- pressed concern over the financial situation. Baker asked what would be done with the funds resulting from the $7 raise in the student activity fee. Last year the student body voted to raise the fee from $33 to $40 per year, the maximum allowable under Vermont State Colleges regulation. \"It was my understanding at the time as well as of the committee that the $7 was ours,\" said Baker. This point was not discussed at any length before the meeting was ad- journed. The Council will again discuss the activities budget at its next meeting on Wednesday. Faculty members serving on the committee are Mary F. Bisson, chair- man of the English department; education department; Walter Has- enfus, of the education department; Frank Baker, of the English depart- ment and William B. Davis, director of student personnel, who is the chairman. Student representatives, elected last spring, include Chuck Landroche and Ed Lucas for men resident students, Helen Flint and Susan Shappy for women resident students, Bonnie Wallace and Leslie Phelps for com- muters. Representatives for the freshman class will be elected sometime next month. LSC Enrollment Largest in History This semester marks the largest total enrollment in Lyndon's history. A total of 528 students have regis- tered with the college for the fall se- mester with 231 freshmen, 104 soph- omores, 88 juniors and 95 seniors. Last year at this time, 457 students had registered, with 186 freshmen, 130 sophomores, 65 juniors and 48 seniors. Ten special students registered this semester, as compared with 18 last fall. Vermonters make up 60% of the total enrollment, as compared with a 2-1 ratio of Vermonters to out-of-state students a year ago. This year, Lyndon has four foreign students, two from Canada, one from Chile and one from Japan. President's '67 Series Opens With Oates' Talk on Indonesia The President's Series for 1967-68 will feature two lectures, three recit- als, one concert, one dramatic read- ing and two plays for the fall semes- ter. Kicking-off the series will be \"The Face of Indonesia,\" an illustrated lec- ture by William A. Oates, assistant professor of history at the college. The lecture will be at 8 p. m. on Oct. 8 in the Vail Lobby. On Oct. 15, Peter Brown and Al- vin Shulman, of the college's music department, will be joined by Bay Mclntyre, professor of music from Goddard College, in a recital of mu- sic for piano trio. \"Upward Bound: The St. Johns- bury Experience\" will be the subject of a documentary report by Balph G. Wright, assistant professor of educa- tion at the college and last year's project director for Upward Bound. His lecture will be on Nov. 5. On Nov. 19 there will be a recital of violin and dance by Malcolm Gold- stein and Carol Marcy of New York and Sheffield. The dramatic reading, \"Brecht on Brecht\" will be given on Dec. 3. A duo-recital by Peter Brown and Alvin Shulman will be on Dec. 17. The Drama Club of the college will give two performances the fall semester. ^ The first will be \"Of Mice and Men\" and will be presented on Oct 14, 20 and 21. The second will be \"Lysistrata\" on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 and 2. The annual Christmas concert by the music department will be at 8 p. m. on Dec. 6. Included as part of the series will be the International Film Series on Wednesday nights. Movies will be shown at 7:30 p. m. in the dining hall. The movies are open to all stu- dents and the public free of charge. Students will also be admitted to all other events in the Series free of charge. Page Two The LYNDON CRITIC SEPTEMBER 26, 1967 Lyndon State College THE CRITIC COMMENTS The Hardest Task Ahead: Creating Order From Chaos On page one of this newspaper the reader will find a rather incompre- hensible report on a serious budgeting problem soon to face the Faculty- Student Council. If the report seems confusing, there is good reason. We who wrote it are confused. We have in our possession a finan- cial report based on facts issued by the business office indicating that as of August 31, $5,318.31 in expendi- tures incurred during the previous school year are being charged against the 1967-68 activities fund. Four organizations, the athletic as- sociation, the \"Critic\", the \"Verlyn\", and the Social Activities Committee have allegedly overshot their alloca- tions by considerable amounts. Long ago we gave up trying to understand athletic spending. At this point we will only report that they allegedly spent $1,884.05 over their $6,558 allotment. The \"Critic\", which was allotted $3000 at the budget meeting last' year, spent $4,689.24. It had been our understanding, until the financial statement was issued last week, that as a \"community\" newspaper, ex- penses beyond the activities allotment would be paid by the college. We acknowledge our apparent error. As of this writing we have heard no justification for the \"Verlyn\" ex- penditure, apparently $750 over its original allocation. Another interesting point involves the expenses of the Activities Com- mittee. While the committee spent somewhat under $3000 on an initial budget of $1500, it turned out that the $1500, through a misunderstand- ing, had been used to pay the Bitter End Singers who appeared at Lyn- don early last fall. Apparently in all innocence, think- ing they had $1500 to work with, the committee spent $1500 and some besides. Later the college did come forth with $750, splitting the cost of the Bitter End Singers. Still another Mild Mannered Reporter Don't Knock The Rock, Baby Hell Is A Cold Place Recently a two-liner appeared on the administration bulletin board in Vail Manor. It was spotted by ap- proximately thirty people. I noticed it and turned away to send notice to a comrade. When I returned, I found a thumbtack, but no paper. Someone had removed the \"disgusting\" bit of reality, in hor- ror or delight I can only conjecture. For all those who were deprived of the joy of the note removed, I re- print without permission of the an- onymous scribe, the Word, as accur- ately as I remember: \"I am small and have plastic par- ents, Does grass grow on Lyndon campus?\" I wonder. What if grass does grow? Who cares? I could care less if the people next door are smoking grass. They don't bother me. Do they bother you? College administrators across the nation have always recognized the Facts of Life: such \"problems\" as hallucinogens, narcotics, homosexual- ity, alcohol and other sundry \"evils\" exist on EVERY CAMPUS, and are present whenever a large group of people meet for any purpose. Lyndon State College is typical in most ways when compared to col- leges with the same population and goals. Lyndon Culture has accepted these \"evils\" as a general cross-section of the Facts of Life. Is this not the sensible course of action? Those involved in the above men- tioned activities, and they form a huge section of an average college population, eventually find those in- terested in sharing mutual pastimes and ignore others. No one is normal in any sense of the word. This is especially true on college campuses. Why does the Establishment insist upon prying into the private lives of the citizens when the citizens as a whole like things the way they are? Skeletons walk around Vail at night anyway, I see no reason for many of Lyndon's more respected students to join the ghosts and memories of long- gone personalities. Don't knock the rock, baby, leave well enough alone. The investigations which most cer- tainly are initiated from time to time can only disturb a fragile existence, within which this college has grown and without which this college will revert back to 1962 and erase the efforts of scores of dedicated men and women over the past seven years. Society realizes, I am sure, that certain conditions of human living exist without the approval of any ma- jority. Such Facts are simply ac- cepted until the very structure of Society itself is endangered. Then and only then is action warranted. Certainly not now and certainly not here at Lyndon. If heads ever roll, some of them may be very familiar. Beware! It only happens in the papers, let's keep it that way. Don't let anything foolish happen on this campus, the place is Heaven on-Earth but Hell is right around the corner. SK complication arises, because the ac- tivities committee was given an addi- tional amount during the fall semes- ter. The Committee probably did not overspend. In the interest of brevity we will dispense with further illustrations of the financial chaos which now exists. We trust a point has been made. We do not believe there has been any dishonesty connected with spend- ing. The situation, in our view, has resulted from misunderstandings and from complications in accounting. Responsibility for the financial disor- ders cannot be attributed to any few individuals. It is not a small task before the Faculty-Student Council, that of creating some semblance of order from chaos. L. W. LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS 11 HE^ A GCOPTBCHEE.. f3MT £5QWETI/V\\ES HOT VePf PATIENT WITH TW^LOmZ. £5TUPENT£, For Lang's Sake The Needs Will Have To Wait: Luxuries Always Get Top Rank There seems to be a strange irony in the way people nowadays regard finances, economics, the cost of liv- ing, etc., etc. Actually, the irony isn't so strange anymore, as it has been a part of the modern consumer's frame of mind for quite a number of years now. The more something costs, and the more of a luxury it is — the more people want it (naturally), and the more they worry about paying for it. This is probably just a natural trait of the most affluent society that has ever existed; it is also a trait that would be very hard to explain or justify to another member of a poor- er society. If a certain commodity is a luxury of considerable expense, the consum- er will splurge and buy it, fretting constantly about the payments and barely managing to scrape together enough money for each monthly pay- ment. Often he will be a long time between payments; then a number of harsh letters mentioning something about an attorney will come from the store. True to his craving for unnecessary luxuries, the poor consumer will search in vain for the required funds, finally giving up and letting the store repossess the object. The grand lux- ury gives way to the dull necessity. But if the item is a fairly cheap necessity, the buyer may well react to the monthly bills with a simple shrug of the shoulders. He is in- clined to let the payments drag in tentionally until they are all paid off; or he may take care of the bill all at once. This fellow will not risk having the cheap, required item repossessed. The consumer has the attitude that, since the luxury product is not whol- ly necessary, he could suffer its re- possession — and he would have had the relatively cheap use of it for quite some time. This average fellow deludes him- self into thinking that he should have the so-called \"necessity\" more than the \"luxury\" (although his desire for the latter is much deeper). This is a fallacy. He should always buy the luxury item first, paying for it all at once if possible. The necessities can wait, or at least the payment of them can. No store would be so hard- hearted as to repossess someone's necessity. Large businesses, social organiza- tions, and various legislative bodies have had the right idea for a long time. (Some individuals are just now catching on.) These groups spend huge sums for products or projects that are far from necessary. But when it comes to allocating only handfuls in very critical areas, these organizations are totally unable to find the funds. Millions are tossed about with ease, at the slightest provocation, on the most trivial of items. But thousands can never be found to provide for programs of the greatest urgency. This system seems to work out all right in the long run, amazingly. Exactly \"why\" or \"how\" is impossible to say. At the very last moment, the urgent programs are handled with what few funds are left. Generally, this last effort is not sufficient to prevent a recurrence of the great needs. But the luxuries will always be there for all to see and admire with awe. D. L.

Sterling School, of Craftsbury, showed the Hornets some tricks as their offense broke through for a single goal in a contest that at times looked like a real game, yet was only practice for both teams. The scrimmage was well worth the loss, as Coach Dudley Bell got his first look at his new players in ac- tion. The game was a success de- spite the lack of Lyndon scoring in that LSC's new players got their first real taste of hard work in preparation for a 14 game schedule ending No- vember second.

The monstrosity has given many fine memories that will not soon be forgotten. The new dorms are great, but no building can match the grace, charm and personality of Vail at night.

Sounds Abound With the addition of several high fidelity systems to the campus, it might be interesting to discuss in this space one aspect of high fidelity and its relationship to the sound one fi- nally hears from his system. The most common complaint about high fidelity systems is that often records just don't seem to sound as good as they did when purchased. Understanding that a phonograph rec- ord manufactured today might possi- bly last ten to twenty years with the proper care, we should turn to one of the most elementary cures. Old Age is a disease which attacks most every record, but fingerprints seem to be a cancerous type of ail- ment. One of the worst things that hap- pens to a record is to have someone pick up or hold a disc with his fin- gers touching the grooves. The result is a deposit of grease and dirt on the walls of the groove. Now this record, when played will react in the following way: When the stylus tip, commonly called the needle, traces around the grooves and comes upon this deposit of grease, the tip is \"gummed up\" in the deposit for an instant before it travels on down the record groove. Now, with this stylus tip partially covered with grease and grime, it will begin its damaging route, spread- ing this \"goo\" throughout the next few grooves. The effect, over a per- iod of dust-catching time is disaster- ous. The dust which inevitably collects on any record when played, sticks to the deposit of grease. The deposit will soon become a permanent part of the record itself unless properly washed, and at times there is no cure for this very sick record. Now how to avoid this possible mess? Keep your records in their proper record sleeves and in their cardboard jackets. Record sleeves made of plastic are especially suited for rec- ord storage, as opposed to their old- er brothers, the paper jackets. Plas- tic is soft, and is not as likely to scratch the delicate vinyl record sur- face. Paper jackets are sometimes re- sponsible for scratches due to dirt getting into them, and the abrasive quality of any amount of dust at- tached to paper is quite sufficient to scratch a record. Paper, however, is still the favorite packaging material for the majority of record companies. The storage of recordings is im- portant if warping is to be avoided. Piling records on the floor beside the record player is like storing your 30-06 in the cellar. The records will warp and the gun will rust. The ef- ficiency of the gun will match that of the records. Records should be stored on end. The record disc will warp if stored like a book. It will warp in so many directions that some records are unplayable after only a few weeks of misuse. Simple as record care is, many people misuse records without know- ing they are, and as such their rec- ord collection slowly turns into a lot of plastic with inaudible music, where a fine collection was only a year ago. Be careful with your records, they cost a lot of money and they are worth more later in life if they are still in good condition. A simple reminder once in a while can add years of enjoyment to your records.

Battle Lines Are Drawn: VSC In White, UVM In Black By Lauren Welch It started in February, manifested itself in heated debate throughout the summer, and was the central text of the President's convocation ad- dress last week. And controversy over the proposed merger of the University of Vermont and the Vermont State College's Board of Trustees will, in all likeli- hood, intensify. For battle lines are drawn, and both sides are tenaciously clinging to their respective beliefs regarding the future course of higher education in Vermont. Blue Ribbon Study Vermont Governor Philip H. Hoff proposed the merger of the boards in February. A blue ribbon committee, the Higher Education Committee of the Legislative Council, was formed by the 1967 legislative session to con- sider the feasibility of such a move. The Committee began its study early this summer. It was late in July that Dr. Lyman S. Rowell, UVM president, expressed the view that \"some kind of a more formalized method of bringing the two groups (the two boards) together for public higher education, is neces- sary.\" It was also during late spring that Dr. Robert S. Babcock, Provost of the Vermont State Colleges, called the proposed merger \"premature.\" Mid-August brought a query from Rowell as to \"whether Vermont can afford to operate three first class lib- eral arts colleges in addition to the University,\" and a reply from Babcock. Said the Provost, \"Vermont desper- ately needs good small liberal arts colleges to do the job that only they can do, just as it needs a strong uni- versity to do the special job that only it can do . . . each has its own pur- poses and functions. The real prob- lem is with that word 'merger'. If it means swallowing up — as it has in many other states — I am confident that the state will not accept the idea.\" Then at a blue ribbon committee meeting on August 17, H. Ward Bed- ford, former VSC board chairman, and Dr. John T. Fey, former presi- dent of UVM, concurred that the 1959 move to bring the state colleges under one board, was at that time considered transitional. Said Bedford, \"In 1959 I think we envisioned an overall board to have in mind integration of all public high- er education.\" Bedford proposed that such a single board be formed. Thomas Ragle, president of Marl- boro College, and featured speaker at the recent freshman orientation activities at LSC, said at the same meeting a unified command over the university and the state colleges is needed. Free Press Stand The \"Burlington Free Press\", in its August 19 lead editorial endorsed the proposed trustee merger. The Uni- versity of Vermont is located in Bur- lington. On August 25, Rowell, the most vocal exponent of the merger plan, was again pitch-hitting for the pro- posal, insisting that the University would not swallow the state colleges. \"We can't afford them (three lib- eral arts colleges) financially and academically.\" Rowell added in his statement to the \"Free Press\", \"If we have a lib- eral arts college, it ought to be a good one. To have to compete for manpower among four schools is an indulgence we simply cannot afford.\" VSC Trustees Statement Following Rowell's statement, an August 28 release reported the VSC Board of Trustees had officially op- posed the merger idea, although Bab- cock was interested in gaining more details. The Board, more adamantly against the proposal, said in its state- ment that such a merger \"could be disasterous.\" Their statement continued, \"If the University of Vermont does have a problem which it and the governor feel demands a solution involving the Vermont State Colleges, then we New Dormitory Problems: Carpeting To Wiring Errors By Steve Keith As Lyndon State College's new dormitories slowly and painfully be- come operational, the college will im- mediately start the endless task of maintenance of the eventual six- building complex. One maid has already been placed on duty in Bayley Residence Hall, her duties being the general cleaning of dorm rooms and keeping living standards as high as possible. The college feels that there is a direct correlation between the clean- liness of student living quarters and morale of the student body as a whole. At a meeting of dormitory students in Vail Manor, last Wednesday eve- ning, William B. Davis, Director of Student Personnel, gave several in- stances which backed the college policy. Davis said that of 22 students liv- ing in the Carriage House the first semester of last year, six were dis- missed on academic grounds. The extreme living quarters apparently had a major influence upon these stu- dents, as the \"mortality rate\" of the Carriage House was much higher than any other dormitory area that semester. Living conditions do in- fluence academic performance. The maid service which is pro- jected for the entire complex will vacuum the rooms, which have wall- to-wall carpeting and at times make beds when the situation in a particu- lar room becomes ridiculous if no- thing else. The maids will keep regular rounds, and will hopefully add years of life to the buildings and their fur- nishings. Some problems have arisen with the carpeting in Bayley Hall. It is not known for certain whether the contract for the carpeting will be re- jected by the General Contractor, Jef- ferson Construction Company, or by Vermont State Colleges Office in Burlington. The carpeting has been one of the main difficulties in open- ing the dorms on schedule. Though no electrical outlets in any bathrooms seems a problem, it was noted last week that holes near the mirrors in the washrooms had been driven through the walls, and this might indicate work of electricians in the area. The four buildings which have been erected on the new campus will enable the college to eliminate Vail dorm as soon as November first, and Burklyn Hall by next semester. stand ready to cooperate as fully as possible . . . Vermont State Colleges have not, at present, any problem which would call for making such a change.\" At their monthly meeting the Trus- tees also expressed concern over the rising cost of construction. Pres. Rowell Answers Rowell answered the Board with an August 30 statement. Said Row- ell, \"They (UVM and the Vermont State Colleges) will stand better treatment in the hands of the legis- lature\" if the merger idea is carefully and honestly studied by both sides. Rowell claimed \"the prospect is very real for increasing competition for available state support.\" On September 7 the \"Enosburg Standard\" printed an editorial by Mrs. Ruth Page, in opposition to the mer- ger plan. As she points out in her own work, Ruth Page is a member of the VSC Board of Trustees. Also on September 7, Babcock again defended his position. Speak- ing before members of the Northern Vermont Chapter, American Institute of Banking, Babcock said, \"There is an additional virtue in the very exist- ence of small liberal arts colleges. . .' They need to exist for teacher train- ing, but by existing, they can serve the additional purpose of providing collegiate education in an atmosphere no longer possible in any multipur- pose university.\" Dr. Long Opposed Dr. Robert E. Long, President of Lyndon State College, recently add- ed his opposition to the merger pro- posal. Said Long in a convocation address before the faculty and student body of LSC last week, \"Clearly I am op- posed to the development of an in- stitutional tie with the University which will in any way diminish the academic and fiscal autonomy of Lyndon.\" The debate will undoubtedly con- tinue. Rowell, Babcock and the four state college presidents are scheduled to testify before the blue ribbon com- mittee at its next meeting on Octo- ber 18. Meanwhile . . .
