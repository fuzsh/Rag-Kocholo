        "text": "John Cowsill (born March 2, 1956) began playing drums and singing at the age of 7, joining his siblings to form the hit 1960’s band The Cowsills. In the early 1980s, Cowsill performed and recorded with Jan and Dean and is heard playing percussion and singing back-up vocals on Tommy Tutone’s hit, \"867-5309/Jenny.\" During this time he also toured as the drummer of Dwight Twilley’s band. Cowsill began playing with the touring Beach Boys on keyboards and vocals in 2000. He moved to the drums in 2008, and was featured as lead vocalist on such songs as \"Wild Honey,” \"California Dreamin’,” “Darlin’,” and \"Sail On Sailor.\" In 2003, he married Vicki Peterson of the Bangles. In 2011, Cowsill was chosen to play with Brian Wilson’s band-- along with Al Jardine and Mike Love--on The Beach Boys’ sold-out 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour. Cowsill appears on that band's subsequent studio album, That's Why God Made the Radio (2012). He also performed on Mike Love's solo albums Unleash the Love (2017) and Reason for the Season (2018). In 2017, Cowsill, Vicki Peterson, and musician/actor Bill Mumy formed the band Action Skulls, releasing two albums: “Angels Hear” (2017) and “A Different World” (2020). Their third album “From A Running Horse” will be released in 2021. Currently, Cowsill continues to tour with The Beach Boys all over the world."
