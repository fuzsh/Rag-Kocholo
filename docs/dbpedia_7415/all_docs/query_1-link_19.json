        "text": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck, born on May 28, 1977, in Cranston, Rhode Island, is a well-recognized American television personality and author. She first came to public attention as a contestant on the second season of the American version of Survivor, where she finished in fourth place. Her vibrant personality and competitive spirit were clearly evident, laying a strong foundation for her future in the entertainment industry. She holds a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from Boston College, emphasizing her diverse talents and interests. Hasselbeck is probably best known for her decade-long tenure on the daytime talk show The View, from 2003 to 2013. As one of the co-hosts, she garnered an Emmy award for Outstanding Talk Show Host along with her colleagues. Her tenure on The View was marked by her conservative views, often leading to heated debates on air. However, it was this spark and divergence of opinion that added a unique flavor to the show and contributed to its popularity. Following her stint on The View, she joined Fox News to co-host Fox & Friends, solidifying her standing in the world of broadcast journalism. Beyond her work on television, Hasselbeck has made a significant impact as an author. She has penned two books that reflect her personal journey and beliefs. In The G-Free Diet, she explores her struggle with Celiac disease, providing a guide for others suffering from the same condition. Her second book, Deliciously G-Free, offers gluten-free recipes, further extending her advocacy for a healthier lifestyle. Hasselbeck's multifaceted career, coupled with her commitment to health and wellness, has made her a dynamic and influential figure in both the entertainment and literary worlds.\n\nGeorge Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878 – November 5, 1942), known professionally as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and theatrical producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \"The Four Cohans\". Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan wrote more than 50 shows and published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \"Over There\", \"Give My Regards to Broadway\", \"The Yankee Doodle Boy\" and \"You're a Grand Old Flag\". As a composer, he was one of the early members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He displayed remarkable theatrical longevity, appearing in films until the 1930s, and continuing to perform as a headline artist until 1940. Known in the decade before World War I as \"the man who owned Broadway\", he is considered the father of American musical comedy. His life and music were depicted in the Oscar-winning film Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) and the 1968 musical George M!. A statue of Cohan in Times Square New York City commemorates his contributions to American musical theatre.\n\nCormac McCarthy (born Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr., July 20, 1933 – June 13, 2023) was an American writer known for his unique writing style, spanning the Southern Gothic, Western, and post-apocalyptic genres. McCarthy's fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985), was on Time magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language books published since 1923. For All the Pretty Horses (1992), he won both the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award. His 2005 novel No Country for Old Men was adapted as a 2007 film of the same name, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and Child of God have also been adapted as motion pictures, while Outer Dark was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction for The Road (2006). In 2010, The Times ranked The Road first on its list of the 100 best fiction and non-fiction books of the past 10 years.\n\nA freckled-faced boy-next-door, actor Van Johnson became a big star at MGM in the 1940s and 1950s when he came to Hollywood from the Broadway chorus. He cornered the market on genial guys who romanced nice girls like June Allyson and Esther Williams in comedies and musicals, which made him a top box office draw during the war and into post-war America. On occasion, he was given a chance to show some dramatic grit in war pictures like \"Thirty Seconds over Tokyo\" (1944) and \"Battleground\" (1949). Johnson's career faded in the early 1960s, though he remained active on television and theater until the early 1990s. Johnson's air of sympathetic concern, boyish energy and sometimes larger-than-life acting style ensured his enduring status as one of the most well-liked symbols of Hollywood's Golden Age."
