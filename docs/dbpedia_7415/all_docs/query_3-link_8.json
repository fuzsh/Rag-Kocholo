        "text": "The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame (LIMEHOF) in Stony Brook has announced an updated list of upcoming August and early September shows, including a must-see performance from The Bangles’ Vicki Peterson alongside The Beach Boys’ John Cowsill, as well as a historic hall of fame induction ceremony and performance honoring legendary hip-hop artists Davy DMX, DJ Hurricane and DJ Jazzy Jay.\n\nFounded in 2004, the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame is an organization dedicated to the idea that Long Island’s musical and entertainment heritage is an important resource to be celebrated and preserved for future generations. The organization, which encompasses New York State’s Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, and Kings (Brooklyn) Counties, was created as a place of community that explores Long Island music and entertainment in all its forms.\n\nAugust 4th – Linda Sussman\n\nLinda Sussman is an award-winning singer-songwriter whose music is an eclectic mix of folk, alternative-folk and blues. Her strong vocals are often compared those of Joan Baez, and her versatile guitar style includes open tunings and, at times, a touch of slide. Sussman has shared her music over the years on stages ranging from the iconic The Bitter End and Kenny’s Castaways in NYC’s West Village to Prospect Park in Brooklyn to Radio Bean in Burlington, VT. Since 2018, she has released five full-length albums, several of which have ranked #1 on the Roots Music Report’s Alternative Folk Album Chart. Her music has been played on over 100 radio programs across the U.S. and abroad. Sussman is most grateful to her studio musicians, Mike Nugent (lead guitarist) and Kevin Kelly (bassist and mixing engineer), with whom she continues to collaborate, and all the stellar musicians who have added spice to her albums. And although Sussman typically performs solo, she and Nugent can occasionally be found onstage together. Additionally, Sussman co-hosts the music series SongBreak with fellow singer-songwriter Josie Bello.\n\nAugust 9th – Vicki Peterson (The Bangles) and John Cowsill (The Cowsills, The Beach Boys) *tickets required\n\nVicki Peterson (The Bangles) and John Cowsill (The Cowsills, The Beach Boys) have been married for 20 years and playing music together for… maybe two. Peterson is a founding member of the 1980s group The Bangles, one of the most successful bands of that decade. She later wrote and performed with her good friend (and eventual sister-in-law) Susan Cowsill as The Psycho Sisters; the duo soon found themselves absorbed into the New Orleans’ songwriters collective The Continental Drifters and remain with them today. The Bangles reunited in the 21st century to release four more albums, including a collection of rarities and a collaboration with the Los Angeles bands Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade and the Three O’Clock.\n\nCowsill began working in clubs, singing and playing drums with his brothers when he was seven years old. The band grew to include their mother and little sister, and The Cowsills became a sensation in the late 1960s, enjoying several Top 20 hits. In 1981 John did some session work, landing on the Tommy Tutone hit “867-5309 (Jenny)” and recorded and toured with Dwight Twilley. He also toured with Jan and Dean before becoming a mainstay of the Beach Boys touring band, playing guitar, piano, and finally sitting at the drum kit for over 20 years.\n\nPeterson and Cowsill, along with their friend actor/musician Bill Mumy, recorded three albums as The Action Skulls, including a pandemic-themed bluegrass record and their latest, From A Running Horse, released just this year. A loving tribute featuring songs written by two of John’s brothers, Bill and Barry Cowsill, was recently finished by Peterson and Cowsill. Long After the Fire is due for release in early 2025.\n\nFor tickets and more information on this performance please visit here.\n\nAugust 11th – Frank Latorre & the King Bees\n\nSeasoned Long Island artist and musician Frank Latoree formed the King Bees in 1990. A five-time winner of the Long Island Blues Society, Latoree is a veteran in the industry. Now, as a three-piece blues rock ensemble with Louie Giusto on drums, Gary Grob Jr. on bass guitar and Latorre on lead vocals, guitar and harmonica, the King Bees will focus on original material written and arranged by Latorre.\n\nAugust 18th – Shindig!\n\nShindig! is a classic rock band that has been playing on Long Island for thirty years. From bars and restaurants to outdoor public parks and private events, they’ve been entertaining the public since 1994. As the years have gone by, some band members have moved out of state and are involved in other musical projects, but these days the band gathers together once or twice a year and reunites for special occasions. “It’s like getting back on a bicycle; it all comes naturally,” say the band members. The special occasion this year is an upcoming performance at the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame in Stony Brook. For this special show, in addition to some original material, the band will be focused on performing covers of material by many of the Long Island Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame’s inductees.\n\nAugust 24th – Performances & Induction of Hip Hop Legends DJ Hurricane, Davy DMX, and DJ Jazzy Jay with a performance by DJ Johnny Juice *tickets required\n\nLIMEHOF will induct legendary hip-hop artists Davy DMX (Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys), DJ Hurricane (The Beastie Boys) and DJ Jazzy Jay (Def Jam) into the hall of fame on August 24th. The three are planning to perform and will be joined by LIMEHOF inductee DJ Johnny Juice (Public Enemy). “The induction of DJ Hurricane, Davy DMX, and DJ Jazzy Jay into the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame highlights the importance of DJs in hip-hop’s early days,” said LIMEHOF Vice Chairman Tom Needham. “These pioneers transformed the art of DJing, making it a central element of the genre and influencing countless artists. Their legacy is a vital part of hip-hop’s story, and we are proud to honor them.” This induction and performance ceremony will celebrate the monumental contributions of these legendary artists to the genre of hip-hop. They will join an impressive line-up of hip-hop performers from the region already inducted, including LL COOL J, Public Enemy, EPMD, Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, Eric B. & Rakim, The Fat Boys, Salt-n-Pepa and Whodini.\n\nDJ Hurricane\n\nDJ Hurricane, born January 12, 1965, is renowned for his electrifying work with the Beastie Boys. Starting his journey in the Hollis, Queens area of New York City, DJ Hurricane honed his skills alongside Run D.M.C. and later became a pivotal figure in the Beastie Boys’ success. His career includes three solo albums featuring collaborations with prominent artists like Xzibit, Public Enemy, Kool G Rap, Black Thought, Papoose, and Talib Kweli. Known for his dynamic performances and innovative production, DJ Hurricane’s influence on hip-hop is immeasurable.\n\nDavy DMX\n\nDavy DMX, also known as David Franklin Reeves Jr., has left an indelible mark on hip hop through his collaborations with Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow, and The Fat Boys. An early associate of Russell Simmons and Larry Smith, Davy DMX’s work in the 1980s set the stage for many future hip-hop sounds. His solo album, “Davy’s Ride,” and his groundbreaking productions have been sampled by top artists like Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Common. Davy DMX’s contributions as a musician, songwriter, and producer have solidified his legacy in the genre.\n\nDJ Jazzy Jay\n\nDJ Jazzy Jay is a foundational figure in hip-hop, instrumental in the creation of Def Jam Recordings alongside Rick Rubin. Jazzy Jay met Rubin and assisted him in laying the foundation for what would become Def Jam Recordings. The label’s first official single was “It’s Yours” by T La Rock and DJ Jazzy Jay. Jazzy Jay also put out Def Jam’s third 12″ in 1985, entitled “Def Jam,” backed with “Cold Chillin’ In The Spot.” In 1986, he participated in the recording of Planet Rock – The Album. Jazzy Jay’s pioneering efforts include producing early recordings by A Tribe Called Quest, Diamond D, and Fat Joe. His own label, Strong City Records, and his influential studio in the Bronx have been critical in shaping the sound of hip-hop. As a DJ, producer, and mentor, Jazzy Jay’s impact on the music industry continues to resonate.\n\nFor tickets and more information on the induction ceremony please visit here.\n\nAugust 25th – Joe Piket & the Storm\n\nJoe Piket has been voted Long Island’s best piano entertainer for the last three years. The LIMEHOF is proud to present Joe Piket and the Storm to kick off their new season of Sunday concerts. Piket has written for movies, cable and television and performed with some very well-known musicians, including some of the musicians on his solo CD, Nine Times Framed. The critical acclaim he received for Nine Times Framed led to the formation of his current band, Joe Piket and the Storm. “People kept asking where they could hear these songs live, so I decided it was time to put a band together and get out and play again,” Piket said. Audiences in New York City and on Long Island have been blown away by Joe Piket and the Storm’s energy, their musical integrity, and their lyrical originality. They have appeared with Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Randy Jackson of Zebra, and Jason Bonham, son of legendary Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. They have also charted on CMJ, and their music is currently being played on most college radio stations. Rave reviews have appeared in Newsday, Good Times, Aural Fix, and L.I.E., as well as many online publications.\n\nSeptember 8th – James O’Malley\n\nBrooklyn-born songwriter James O’Malley has composed some of the most endearing and relatable songs that a music lover could hear. Along the way, he’s appeared on TV, radio, concert stages, and festivals throughout the area. His influences include Tim Hardin, Chuck Pyle, Donovan, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Mickey Newbury, Mississippi John Hurt, Randy Newman, Big Bill Broonzy, Bert Jansch, Gordon Lightfoot, etc. and he learned his fingerpicking basics from legendary folk guitarist Eric Darling."
