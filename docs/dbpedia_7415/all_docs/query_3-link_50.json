        "text": "This post contains my complete running coverage of this annual conference and festival ...\n\n© Chicago Sun-Times\n\nSXSW 2013 opens with names big and small\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 13, 2013 9:00 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — \"It's like Comic Con, but without anything cool.\"\n\nThat early review of South by Southwest came from one of the multitude of hipsters strutting through the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday — the final day of SXSW Interactive and the first day of SXSW Music. This annual conference and festival in the Texas capital has grown into a 10-day event encompassing rollouts of films, digital ventures and new music. The movies and online jibber-jabber started March 8; the music blares on through March 17.\n\nThe relative coolness of what lies ahead remains to be seen, but it's already shaping up to be a typical mix of fresh-faced new bands — the showcasing of which was SXSW's original mission when it began in 1987 — and big-name celebs.\n\nIn the latter category, Depeche Mode, Green Day and Dave Grohl's Sound City Players (an assembly of Stevie Nicks, John Fogerty, Rick Springfield, Rick Nielsen, Corey Taylor and many more) have booked big performances this week. Other formidable names — Iggy & the Stooges, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds — also are among the thousands of artists vying for attention from journalists, record labels and digital media.\n\nThe rumor mill, though, is buzzing about two other megastars: Prince and Justin Timberlake. Both taut pop-R&B legends have been floated as possible surprise showcases during SXSW. The Prince gig is just a rumor, with an unnamed source suggesting that His Purpleness will perform with a 22-piece band Saturday night at the cavernous La Zona Rosa club.\n\nTimberlake — whose new album, \"The 20/20 Experience,\" is out Tuesday (read my review) — is scheduled all week on TV's \"Lat Night With Jimmy Fallon,\" but the Austinist site has pieced together clues toward JT's own possible Saturday night show.\n\nWatch this blog for my own reports. My docket includes the big and the small, from seeing how Green Day emerges from their personal crisis to checking out up-and-comers like Foxygen and Lianne La Havas. I'll also be sniffing out the home-cooking that always pervades SXSW, from Chicago's Wild Belle and Chief Keef to the premiere of the blues documentary \"Born in Chicago.\" Stay tuned!\n\nSXSW: Long live Shoes, long live Camper Van Beethoven\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 13, 2013 6:32 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Janice Greenberg actually teared up a bit at the Camper Van Beethoven show.\n\nThe 46-year-old mother of two from Sonoma County, Calif., stumbled into the Jr. club Wednesday afternoon, squinting from the bright-to-black transition and her jaw hanging down. The band was running through its well-known 1980s indie-rock standard, \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\" — but it was, Greenberg discovered to her considerable dismay, their last song.\n\n\"I had no idea that they ... are they even ... I didn't know they were here!\" she said, close to a wail. \"I love Camper!\"\n\nCamper eased onto the stage Wednesday afternoon and played a 10-song, career-spanning set that was plenty to justify their status as indie-rock grandfathers. What was extraordinary, though — and somehow I always forget this till I'm faced with it — was the skill of the five players. CVB's music can get complicated, not in a convoluted art-rock sense but in a self-taught virtuoso sense. While singer David Lowery wheezes and whines his weird, grumpy-ol'-stoner tales, you've got Jonathan Segel (elegant on violin, especially during \"Sad Lover's Waltz,\" but also adding swooping third guitar to the new \"Too High for the Love-In\") and Greg Lisher (braiding melodies and countermelodies throughout like a pro). New songs like \"Northern California Girls\" — from the recently released new album, \"La Costa Perdida\" — were refreshing live, while old surprises like \"Seven Languages\" still packed a punch.\n\nThe best part, though, was when Greenberg got the good news: Camper's playing again two hours later, at 7 p.m. right next door at El Sol y La Luna, 600 E 6th St. I'd quote her reaction, but she was off like a shot to secure her spot.\n\nTrusty ol' Shoes\n\nAnother legacy act inaugurated SXSW 2013 Wednesday afternoon with a show that was, at least historically, slightly more momentous. Beloved power-pop band Shoes — the lions of Zion, Ill. — played their first concert outside the Chicago area in 18 years.\n\nShoes, an occasional underground delight since appearing in 1975, reunited last year to record \"Ignition,\" their first new album since 1994. Early Wednesday afternoon, at an annual showcase organized by Chicago native publicist Cary Baker (who shepherded the dB's into their comeback at the same place last year), singer-guitarists Jeff Murphy and Gary Klebe, brother John Murphy on bass and drummer John Richardson blasted through their own career-spanning set.\n\nShoes is one of those bands with a consistency that's more than a little frightening. I was bobbing my head through most of \"Say It Like You Mean It\" before I remembered it was one of the new ones.\n\nNo one at SXSW has just one gig anymore: Shoes' play again (their official showcase) at 11 p.m. Friday at Maggie Mae's Gibson Room, 512 Trinity St.\n\nSXSW: 'Born in Chicago' explores '60s blues hand-off\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2013 1:33 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — A day after it was announced as a featured documentary at next month's annual Chicago International Movies & Music Festival, \"Born in Chicago\" had its world premiere here at SXSW on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe film, directed by John Anderson, chronicles the history and tall tales from the generation of young, affluent white kids who gathered in Chicago during the 1950s and '60s, learning to play the blues from the men who had honed the music on their own. Narration by Marshall Chess (son and nephew of the Chess Records founders) mixes into interviews with Elvin Bishop, Charlie Musselwhite, Nick Gravenites, Barry Goldberg (who co-produced the film) and excellent footage of the late Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield. On the other side are snatches of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, plus interviews with Sam Lay and the great Hubert Sumlin.\n\n\"Born in Chicago\" makes Bloomfield, a wealthy Jewish guitar virtuoso (a fact he presents in a funny bit of old footage), appear something of a valiant crusader for crossing the mid-century racial divide, bearing his instrument. Goldberg relates a templated tale of him and Bloomfield venturing into the South Side one night to sit in with Howlin' Wolf — and the hush that came over the club when two white boys walked in. All that's missing is the record-scratching clip from the Dexter Lake Club in \"Animal House.\"\n\nThe film's problematic thesis, though, seems to be that this particular appropriation wasn't like all the other black cultural exploitations by white musicians — because Muddy and Wolf and the gang were apparently so thrilled to be noticed, appreciated and revered by these upper-middle class dilettantes. Chess himself drives the point home about \"these white kids treating 'em like stars,\" and Goldberg assures us that \"people recognized the respect we had for their music.\" Musselwhite — himself the subject of a current generational rediscovery thanks to his recent collaboration with Ben Harper — insists, \"These guys ... were so flattered we knew who they were.\" Just because the original bluesmen welcomed their exploiters, however, does not mean they weren't exploited.\n\nEven Jack White mentions what a \"shame\" it is that it takes white people to \"legitimize\" something like this, apparently never stopping to consider that the music previously had been perfectly legitimate for black people. So only when white people — a bunch of Brits, no less, once the Stones showed up at Chess — stamp their approval does a music become 2 legit 2 quit? Same song, umpteenth verse.\n\nSteve Miller probably sums up the reality of the situation better than anyone in the film: \"Everybody talks about it like, oh, these white kids. We were competing with Howlin' Wolf for gigs. ... It was business.\"\n\nCatch \"Born in Chicago\" at the CIMM fest in Chicago, April 18-21. Four-day passes are on sale now.\n\nSXSW: Chicago's Wild Belle ready for summer\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2013 8:15 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — SXSW originally was created to showcase music that was new, fresh, creative. Wild Belle returned to the festival Wednesday night boasting all three.\n\nThe Chicago-area, brother-sister duo of Elliot and Natalie Bergman kicked off the Wednesday showcases with a packed house at the roomy upstairs Haven club, with lines of eager badge-holders and fans stretching in two directions down the block. Leaning heavily on their new album, \"Isles\" — released Tuesday on major label Columbia — the Bergmans and their band bounced effortlessly through their reggae-driven pop. It was music for the Austin weather: warm, breezy and revitalizing. That they performed a song about being \"bundled up like chickadees\" in Chicago seemed almost to taunt the folks back home.\n\nNatalie is a Kittenish creature — capitalized because, while her vocals certainly purr, she sings with a throaty, Eartha Kitt allure. She performs with a sultry confidence belying the fact that \"Isles\" is the band's debut. Elliot, though, is crucial to the band's unique sound. Puttering about among keyboards, a baritone saxophone and various gizmos, like a thumb piano with an electric pickup attached, he looks like Lazlo Hollyfield and underpins the music with a similarly silent mad genius. Wild Belle's sound is relaxed, summery and always keeps just left of what one might expect them to go. One of those moments where you wish this wasn't a mere 40-minute SXSW showcase.\n\nSXSW: The return of Dixie Chick Natalie Maines\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2013 8:39 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Really, no hoots and cheers when Natalie Maines, covering Pink Floyd's \"Mother,\" sang the song's line about running for president?\n\nMaines, the singer for country's Dixie Chicks, returned to the spotlight in a Wednesday night showcase at the Austin City Limits Live theater during SXSW. Once the flashpoint for debate after disparaging President George W. Bush (telling a London audience in 2003, \"Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas\"), the Lubbock native was back in Austin a decade later to unveil the new Natalie. Performing the entirety of her new album, \"Mother\" — her solo debut since the Dixie Chicks went on hiatus in 2007 — Maines appeared stolid and confident.\n\nIn fact, in the beginning the set lacked much energy at all, plodding through midtempo numbers without much fanfare or enthusiasm. The Pink Floyd cover — a dark choice, but played capably and arranged for arenas — is part of the reason this is being touted as a \"rock\" record, and eventually more of her trademark feistiness backed up that perspective. Politics are still foregrounded: \"I put this on the album because it reminds me of the West Memphis Three,\" she said by way of introducing Dan Wilson's \"Free Life.\" But then — backed as she was Ben Harper and his Innocent Criminals band (Harper co-produced Maines' new album) — she put down her own guitar and launched into Patty Griffin's \"Silver Bell,\" unleashing a pent-up Belinda Carlisle kind of frenzy while rooted at the mike. Suddenly the near faux-hawk hairdo was making sense.\n\n\"Mother\" is due May 7. Incidentally, as Maines pointed out, Patty Griffin also has a new album out the same day.\n\nSXSW: Dave Grohl talks Chicago, inspires the aspiring\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2013 2:08 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Dave Grohl stepped to the podium Thursday morning to deliver the keynote address at SXSW 2013, rolled up his sleeves, tucked his hair behind his ears — and put on reading glasses.\n\nThe move spoke not only to rock's AARP eligibility but to the paternal tone of his address. Largely an autobiography of a lifetime spent pursuing some measure of independence in his music, Grohl's speech aimed not at the media and industry crowding the Austin Convention Center ballroom but at any indie-rock kids who might hear him.\n\n\"There is no right or wrong, there is only your voice,\" he dispensed. \"It's your voice. Cherish it, respect it, challenge it ... Everyone's blessed with at least that.\"\n\nIn Austin to hype his new documentary, \"Sound City: Real to Reel,\" Grohl barely mentioned it, largely trying to inspire with his speech rather than merely shill for his flick.\n\nThe Foo Fighters leader and former Nirvana drummer began his hourlong talk with the moment of his birth, but wrapped it up by stating hope that his own two daughters will find their own way in the world. His remarks retraced that wayfinding, beginning with a K-tel record. His sister bought it in 1975, and it contained Edgar Winter's instrumental \"Frankenstein,\" which he proceeded to scat for the audience. Hearing the tune was a life-changing moment, he said, adding, \"It was the riff. I gave it all up for a f---in' riff.\"\n\nMuch of his tale he has told before, including the other pivotal musical moments he experienced during summer family visits in the Chicago area. He described (somehow) getting into the Cubby Bear to hear local punk legends Naked Raygun (\"The most ferocious noise! Bodies were flying everywhere ... piss and puke. I was in heaven!\") and making the pilgrimage to Wax Trax! Records to begin stocking up on the requisite punk catalog.\n\nGrohl demonstrated the crude multitracking technique he came up with as a teen. With one tape machine, he recorded a few bars of a guitar riff. He placed that tape into another player and played it back, while recording some drum beats on the body of his guitar. Voila — the new recording contained both sounds!\n\nGrohl's rewind was full of life-changing moments — a political punk show in Washington, D.C., a single question (\"Have you heard of Nirvana?\"), the death of Kurt Cobain.\n\n\"When Kurt died, I was lost. I was numb. The music that I had devoted my life to had now betrayed me. I had no voice. I put away my drums. I turned off the radio. I couldn't bear to hear someone else singing about their own pain or happiness.\"\n\nHe re-emerged with a self-made album, which he labeled the Foo Fighters, which became — as once described by Pitchfork, a media outlet he disparaged midway through his speech — \"his generation's answer to Tom Petty — a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock.\"\n\nGrohl's talk about Grohl was a bit thin after recent SXSW keynotes — Bruce Springsteen's rousing music history lesson last year, Bob Geldof's still-poignant pleas for rock's social conscience in 2011 — but it contained nuggets of self-awareness and inspiration for aspiring contemporary musicians.\n\nRepeating a mantra about finding one's individual voice, he confessed, \"F--- guilty pleasure! How about just pleasure? ... I can truthfully say out loud that 'Gangnam Style' is one of my favorite f---ing songs of the past year.\"\n\nDave Grohl's Sound City Players is a temporary supergroup featuring Grohl, Stevie Nicks, John Fogerty, Rick Nielsen and many more. They perform an anticipated showcase later tonight.\n\nSXSW shows off Chicago hip-hop\n\nBy Thomas Conner March 15, 2013 9:26 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Late Thursday night, an official showcase of more Chicago rappers — including King Louie, Lil Durk, Lil Mouse, GLC, Katie Got Bandz — stocked the upstairs Club 119 in the shadow of the Texas capitol. MCs and DJs ringed the club's small stage, waiting to be tagged in like pro wrestlers. Vic Spencer worked the crowd, followed by the dynamic and engaging YP, who boasted of his East Side roots and led the crowd chanting the title of \"Insane\" (alas, no Rockie Fresh cameo). Chance the Rapper was here, too, working his own forceful rhythms despite the tempo of his soothing, soulful tracks. Chance dances like a boxer on stage, and his rhymes (even when not talking about \"tabs of acid\" in \"Brain Cells\") get pretty wild and surreal.\n\nAnd lest you've fallen prey to the notion that all Chicago hip-hop is bleak and violent, Chance shouted with notable ferocity: \"Make some noise if you love your mama!\"\n\nSXSW: Dave Grohl's Sound City Players rock long\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 15, 2013 10:08 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — \"It's gonna be a long f---in' night,\" Dave Grohl promised at the start of his Thursday set with his live musical collage, the Sound City Players. Then the supergroup — Grohl on bass with his Foo Fighters, led by omnipresent hard-rock maestro Alain Johannes — kicked off a song that found Johannes pleading, \"I hope it won't be long.\"\n\nDave Grohl's Sound City Players are a hodge-podge of recognizable names spanning three generations, a promotional ploy for Grohl's new documentary (\"Sound City: Real To Reel,\" about the legendary Los Angeles recording studio) and its accompanying soundtrack. The group features Grohl and his band with Stevie Nicks, John Fogerty, Rick Springfield, Lee Ving (Fear), Rick Nielsen (Cheap Trick), Brad Wilk (Rage Against the Machine), Corey Taylor (Slipknot, Stone Sour), Chris Goss (Masters of Reality), Johannes (Eleven, Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures) and bassist Krist Novoselic (Nirvana).\n\nThey've performed a handful of shows since early January in New York, Los Angeles and London. Grohl said at the beginning of Thursday's SXSW concert outdoors at Stubb's BBQ that this one would \"probably\" be their last. \"So we're gonna make it extra long, extra special.\"\n\nLong we got — close to three-and-a-half hours — and special, too. The result was a rollicking rock and roll revue. Springfield came on for \"I've Done Everything for You\" and, of course, \"Jessie's Girl.\" Taylor and Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins sang Cheap Trick's \"I Want You to Want Me\" and \"Surrender,\" with Grohl on drums and Nielsen on guitar. Fogerty closed the show with Creedence Clearwater Revival hits, including \"Proud Mary,\" \"Bad Moon Rising\" and trading verses with Grohl on \"Fortunate Son.\" Through it all, Grohl stayed on stage playing with everyone's mini-set (switching between guitar, bass and drums), beaming with obvious glee at having assembled this temporary clubhouse.\n\nGrohl's first guest, however, was the most transformative. After half a dozen songs bashed out with Johannes, Nicks stepped to the mic and proved to be more than up to the task of leading a bashing hard rock band.\n\nShe and Grohl pointed at each other as they sang the chorus of \"Stop Dragging My Heart Around\" (see, Grohl is his generation's Tom Petty!), and Nicks performed Fleetwood Mac's \"Dreams\" with the band and \"Landslide\" with Grohl alone on guitar. She sang excellent new song from the \"Sound City\" soundtrack, \"You Can't Fix This\" -- graceful and tuneful, with a leaning, weaving riff more akin to Waddy Wachtel than Lindsey Buckingham. Swinging her ribboned tambourine and wearing shades, Nicks was in great voice and moving with an ease I've not seen on stage in a long time, particularly when the band began a surreal, clanging opening séance to \"Gold Dust Woman,\" as Nicks waved her scarf with her back to the audience and conjured her old witchy self. With the Foo Fighters cranked to 11, Nicks wailed and howled and raised the dead, holding her own with the muscled band all the way through the cacophonous conclusion.\n\nForget Grohl's \"Sirvana\" work with Paul McCartney -- let's have some Fleetwood Fighters!\n\n(Since a couple of people have asked: According to Pee Wee Herman himself via Twitter, the photo on the bass drum head was of Pee Wee, David Lee Roth and Rodney Dangerfield.)\n\nSXSW: Flaming Lips bring 'Yoshimi,' 'The Terror'\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 15, 2013 11:23 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — \"The new record is probably going to freak some people out,\" said Wayne Coyne. \"It is, on purpose, not a hopeful record.\"\n\nHe's talking about \"The Terror,\" the Flaming Lips' new nine-track album due in late April, and as he does it's easy for him to get a little heavy.\n\n\"There are things we have to face as human beings, truths we must explore,\" Coyne says. \"'The Terror' is a certain kind of terror, an uncanny sort of break in nature or your own life. It's not an insane, monster terror. It's the terror of realizing that love isn't the magic bullet. We all wake up with dread of the unknown. It's not about fear of dying, but about the fact that we just don't know what's going to happen anywhere, anytime.\"\n\nWe were sitting in a makeshift green room, a tent in a parking garage behind the venue where the Flaming Lips would perform later Thursday night. Not that parking garage. During SXSW '97 nearly 2,000 people crammed into the second level of a downtown garage to hear Coyne's Car Radio Orchestra, an experiment involving 28 vehicles. Coyne gave each driver a pre-mixed cassette and instructed them to press play and blare the music on cue. Soon, soothing synthesizer parts were swelling from various auto systems, with surreal samples and female orgasm sounds. It was an experiment; one car blew a fuse.\n\n\"The cops nearly shut us down,\" Coyne recalled.\n\nThursday night the Flaming Lips played a more intimate showcase — no confetti, no costumes, thankfully no big plastic ball — performing the whole of their 2002 album \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\" The show was packed — so much so there was still a line down the block when it was over.\n\nFriday night, though, they'll be unveiling the new music in a free show at the Auditorium Shores amphitheater here.\n\n\"We keep saying this is the most depressing but life-affirming music we've ever done,\" Coyne said.\n\nCoyne is also in town this week to promote a film, \"A Year in the Life of Wayne's Phone,\" which had its world premiere Wednesday night at SXSW. The film is a collage of clips Coyne shot with his iPhone.\n\n\"I didn't do this on purpose,\" Coyne said. \"I take so many videos, and my computer guy is always having to empty them off my computer to make room. One day he said, 'We should a movie of these.'\"\n\nSince Coyne shot nearly all the videos in vertical portrait mode rather than the usual horizontal scale, the film features three clips lined up, each running simultaneously. The clips range from interviews, shots of friends (look for Yoko Ono and Rivers Cuomo!), cute animals, the USB skull and Coyne crowdsurfing. The viewer's attention is directed by bringing up the audio on a certain clip, but it's still a disorienting challenge to take it all in.\n\nSXSW: Green Day roars back to life\n\nBy Thomas Conner March 16, 2013 11:31 am\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — In the middle of “Stay the Night,” Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong paused at the microphone, stared at the crowd for a moment and sighed, “Ah, welcome back!”\n\nA turnabout of words. No doubt he was happy to see us — a crowd not even close to capacity at the Austin City Limits Live theater, but certainly a welcoming one. This was Green Day’s return to action after Armstrong’s profane meltdown last September at a festival in Las Vegas, complete with tantrum and smashed guitar. Days later, the band announced Armstrong was seeking treatment for substance abuse and a slate of arena dates was postponed.\n\nFriday night at SXSW, though, Armstrong couldn’t have looked more refreshed, reinvigorated and grateful.\n\nAfter the welcoming comment, he let the crowd sing for moment while he sat on the edge of the drum riser, first gazing back at us with some measure of incredulity, then sitting for a spell with his head in his hands.\n\nThere’s a lot of that in a Green Day show nowadays — the poor band vamping, sometimes for quite a long time, while Armstrong wrangles the crowd. He’s a professional motivator, certainly, and obsessed with airborne limbs (“Get your hands up! This ain’t no caf, motherf—ers!”). Thankfully, the band — Armstrong, bassist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tr Cool and their criminally unsung “fourth member,” guitarist Jason White — was plenty exciting without the constant demands for shouts, singalongs and waving arms.\n\nIn 24 songs over two hours, Green Day ripped through its catalog, reaching back to the early ’90s and slotting in some requisite newbies from this winter’s album trilogy (“Uno!,” “Dos!” and “Tr!”). The hit parade marched along — “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” “Jesus of Suburbia,” the excellent “Know Your Enemy” — including some songs that now wear an extra patina of irony, given Armstrong’s recent troubles, such as “Burnout” and “Basket Case.”\n\nOnly once did Armstrong allude to his recent woes. During “Stop When the Red Lights Flash,” he had directed the band and the audience into a quiet moment and crouched into the microphone to kick off a climactic explosion — but just before he could whisper to a scream, a roadie darted over and replaced the wireless mic right in front of Armstrong’s mouth. The singer barely missed a beat but couldn’t help chuckle a bit. “And I wasn’t even on drugs,” he quipped.\n\nBut while the on-stage comeback was encouraging, SXSW finds Green Day at a possibly crucial juncture. The band also debuted not one but two new documentaries during this festival: “Broadway Idiot,” about the transformation of the 2004 “American Idiot” album into a hit musical, and “Cuatro!” chronicling the making of the recent trilogy.\n\nEach album in that trilogy is, with remarkable consistency, terrible. (I reviewed “Uno!” but couldn’t find the heart to kvetch further about the other two.) So here they are with projects that look backward and forward. If the way forward is merely “Cinco!” then even though the band played the ACL theater like an arena, it may want to prepare itself for such smaller venues. The stoked fire in their bellies on display Friday night either will spark their previously impressive creativity within such a rigid genre, or it simply will warm their evenings as a very entertaining legacy act at the casinos and cruises of the future.\n\nGreen Day reboots its postponed tour starting March 28 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\n\nSXSW: The rebirth of Detroit punk trio Death\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 16, 2013 12:21 PM\n\nBlack musicians did a lot of great things in Detroit in the '60s and '70s. Rock and roll — much less anything that would later be called punk — wasn't always one of them. At SXSW this year, though, a band was on display that defies that notion: Death, a fraternal trio and a rare group that can justly support the claim \"best band you've never heard.\"\n\nDeath was born in the east Detroit home of the Hackney family. Brothers Dannis, Bobby and David, like so many boomer-era musicians, started playing in the early 1970s as the Rock Fire Funk Express. But after witnessing concerts by the Who and fellow Detroiter Alice Cooper, the brothers threw their lot with their city's other musical heroes, punk-rock icons like the MC5 and Iggy Pop. The Hackney brothers then began writing taut, propulsive rock 'n' roll — truly great stuff — which, until a slightly miraculous rediscovery a few years ago, was heard by practically no one.\n\nThe story of the band's derailed promise and eventual obscurity is told ably in a documentary screening at SXSW, \"A Band Called Death.\" Blessed with a rich tale, director-producer Jeff Howlett basically leans back and lets the golden plot points unfold one after another.\n\nOpening with gushing praise from the likes of Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and — was that Elijah Wood?! — \"A Band Called Death\" charts the emergence of this family band and the, for the times, unusual shift from R&B to rock and roll.\n\n\"Then the Who came to town,\" Dannis Hackney says, pausing to emphasize some unspoken gravitas of that moment, \"and when I saw Alice Cooper, all bets were off. I said, 'If we ain't playing this, then we ain't gonna be having no fun.'\"\n\nSinger David Hackney, however, sought to express through the band's new music his own complex cosmology, which included some positive notions about the rebirth and transformation potential in death. Thus, he insisted on the name.\n\nThat made Death pretty much dead on arrival.\n\nThe band's first producer in Detroit, former Stax musician Don Davis, recalls in the film telling the band: \"Have you lost your mind? Nobody is going to buy a song from a group called D-E-A-T-H,\" spelling out what apparently was still an uncomfortable moniker.\n\nThe trio's music caught the ear of hitmaker Clive Davis, who was ready to sign the band to Arista — as long as they changed the name. David refused to budge, insisting (with definitely punkish integrity) that the sacrifice would be a slippery slope. Bobby Hackney, in an earlier interview, recalled, \"He said, 'If they make us change our name, then every little thing they see in us they're gonna wanna change — the music, the style, the concept. Once we change that name, we belong to them. Once we give in to that, Death is, well, dead.'\"\n\nCredibility intact, Death still died. They did, however, manage to secure the master recordings of what was to be the debut Death album. Attempts to release songs independently failed, and the brothers relocated to Vermont and formed a reggae band. David Hackney died in 2000, after insisting that his brothers hold on to those masters, saying, \"One day the world's gonna come looking for this.\"\n\nAmazingly, that's exactly what happened.\n\nBiafra, a rabid record collector, bought a box of singles several years ago: Death's lone indie 45, \"Politicians in My Eyes.\" He mentioned it in an interview. The writer posted the single online as an mp3. Word began spreading of its awesomeness.\n\nThen the rediscovery came full circle. Bobby Hackney Jr. — clearly still dazed and amazed by this as he relates the story in the film — hears the song, likes it, and has no idea it's his dad until he goes as far as to Google some background. He calls home: \"Dad, why didn't you tell me??!!\"\n\nThis is 2008, and the following year momentum has built enough that Chicago-based label Drag City assists the Hackney brothers in restoring those old masters and finally releasing the debut Death album, titled \"...For All the World to See.\" Another compilation of early demos followed.\n\nThis week at SXSW, in addition to the documentary screenings, two bands played showcases: Death, featuring surviving brothers Dannis and Bobby with two extra players, and Rough Francis, a deadly new generation featuring Bobby Hackney Jr., Julian Hackney and Urian Hackney.\n\nEven better: Death will live again on a new record, titled \"Relief,\" in the works now.\n\nSXSW: Justin Timberlake, Prince, Smashing Pumpkins\n\nBy Thomas Conner March 17, 2013 9:06 am\n\nThe final night of SXSW featured two big legacy acts. OK, from a Chicago perspective it was three.\n\nJustin Timberlake, making good on rumors, blew into town after a week on “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” to play an intimate club gig. Here’s a star who will fill Chicago’s Soldier Field this summer, but here in Austin he played the 800-capacity Coppertank Events Center.\n\n(Mind you, this show was only partly about music. Timberlake, now a beer spokesman, was here to promote the newly renovated MySpace web site, of which he’s a major investor, in a concert sponsored by Chevrolet.) Timberlake, backed by a 16-piece band, played for an hour. This writer did not gain admission — I just reviewed his record, and we’ll have plenty of chances to discuss JT further all year long — but there are good reviews here, here and here.\n\nAcross town, Prince played the larger club La Zona Rosa, leading a 22-piece band and performing more covers than his own songs. The nearly three-hour show — in which Prince never played guitar (fail) — did bring something to SXSW that is often hard to find: lots of R&B and funk.\n\n\"They called our people and said they wanted some funk in Austin,” said Prince, before belting out the last bars of a gentle rendition of “Purple Rain.” At least this show sounds like it was better than his previous Chicago fiascoes.\n\nYou won’t see a lot of photos from the Prince show online today, however. Notoriously prickly about photos at his shows, Prince banned all cameras. Even simply using a cell phone got some fans tossed — a biting irony, given that the concert was thrown by Samsung Galaxy and promoters worked the crowd beforehand offering customers fresh phone batteries or device test-drives. But intrepid Chicago photographer Michael Jackson (yup, his real name), shooting for the Sun-Times, landed the image above.\n\nIn other news: Today is Billy Corgan’s birthday — happy 46th! — an occasion the Chicago rocker rang in at midnight on stage at SXSW. The Smashing Pumpkins, still busy and ahead of a new world tour, played a set mixed with hits (“Bullet With Butterfly Wings,” “Tonight, Tonight”) and newer songs from the excellent “Oceania” album, even a cover of Bowie’s “Space Oddity.” Review here, or see the detailed run-down on the Twitter feed from Hipsters United.\n\nSXSW: Wanderings, discoveries, random notes\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2013 12:00 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — If it's Sunday, that means my notes are full of jottings about a dozen other bands I saw and haven't written about yet in the mad rush that is SXSW. Deep breath, here's a wrap-up of the other tunes worth mentioning ...\n\nBest brand-spanking-new band\n\nCHVRCHES, barely a year old, impressed with a strong batch of electronic pop at several showcases, including a Friday day stage. The Scottish trio's debut album isn't due until September, but singer-synth players Lauren Mayberry, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty bear all the hallmarks of a forceful, creative unit with a single mind — perhaps the meaning of the beautiful current single, \"The Mother We Share.\" Their newness is evident in the fact that they still have a ways to go before making their knob-twiddling something to watch on stage, but the songs are there. I haven't heard synth-driven pop this tight and tuneful since Robyn showed up.\n\nMost hopeful feeling at end of showcase\n\nNo one really seems to have demanded this reunion of Chicago's Fall Out Boy, but the band's Friday night showcase — back at SXSW after eight years — at least showed off enough energy and chutzpah to suggest that the comeback is genuinely inspired. Their fans certainly remain adoring, singing along with practically every word that fell from singer Patrick Stump's lips, maybe even his stage banter. The 45-minute slot kept to singles old (\"Sugar, We're Going Down,\" \"Dance, Dance\") and new (\"My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark [Light 'Em Up]\"). Stump flexed his own R&B muscles in a recent solo outing, and the new FOB is highlighting that strength. Even the cover of \"Beat It\" sounded more sincere and natural than one might expect. Definitely whetted the appetite for the new record.\n\nBest stumbled-upon showcase\n\nField Report, a band led by Christopher Porterfield. Two bits of trivia: First, Field Report is an anagram of Porterfield. Second, Porterfield started out a decade ago in DeYarmond Edison, the band Justin Vernon fronted before creating Bon Iver. On his own, Porterfield is much warmer and far rootsier. At a Saturday SXSW showcase, his six-man band — plenty of plaid shirts and trucker hats, neither of which seemed to be worn with much hipster irony — delivers supple, textural Americana that fit right in with the venue's sponsorship by a home-improvement cable channel (as if his music was in itself an answer to the advertising banners hung around the bar, asking, \"What does home mean to you?\"). Singing well-written songs about New Mexico and a \"bible school choir,\" Porterfield guided the band up and down various crescendos to achieve maximum emotional impact, all the while maintaining an appropriately pensive expression. \"Is everyone drinking enough water?\" he asked between songs. Bassist Travis Whitty chided him: \"Concerned dad up here.\" Aw shucks.\n\nBest return on investment in buzz\n\nNew York quartet Parquet Courts entered the festival with considerable, though understandably hesitant, buzz. The band's proper debut album, \"Light Up Gold,\" out in January, is a complex chart of steady rhythms, snaking words and clean but often jarring guitars. It's not an album that immediately broadcasts \"great stage show!\" On stage Saturday night, the band lazed into action, blurring the line between hasty SXSW sound check and actual opening song. Driven by the rhythm section — featuring bassist Sean Yeaton, who spends the show contributing occasional backing vocals with hilariously distended tongue, like a punk Loudon Wainwright III — guitarists Andrew Savage and Austin Brown were free to work at their own pace and inspiration, pulsing their instruments to propel the song or torturing them a bit. The momentum of the Strokes, the late-night \"Stoned and Starving\" haze of the Dandy Warhols, plus occasional Sonic Youth squall. Adds up to a good time.\n\nBest personal thrill with very little note-taking\n\nA longtime Robyn Hitchcock fan, I wasn't going to miss perennial SXSW performer Robyn Hitchcock's early Saturday show, particularly since it was celebrating his 60th birthday (complete with tarantula-topped cake and red wine, which Hitchcock referred to as \"lady petrol\"). The British legend was supported by a number of pals — Ken Stringfellow (Posies), Scott McCaughey (Young Fresh Fellows, Minus 5), Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., Ministry, tons), Linda Pitmon (Steve Wynn) — and for a moment, with Kelly Hogan on stage and Jon Langford in the wings, it seemed the band might turn into Robyn Hitchcock & the Chicagoans. Langford never materialized on stage with Hitchcock, though. Nor did R.E.M.'s Mike Mills (grinning, looking more content than I've seen him in years), who was at the bar and had played bass behind Stringfellow as the opening act. Nonetheless, Hitchcock told his usual bizarre stories and sang an impressively wide variety of songs — newish ones (the beautiful \"Dismal City\"), old ones (\"Queen Elvis,\" \"Ole Tarantula,\" \"Alright, Yeah\") and covers (\"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Don't Let Me Down\") — as well as rapping a bit about the new pope.\n\nBest delayed reaction\n\nLord Huron was highly recommended to me by friends at last year's SXSW, but I missed their showcase at a cramped little club. Fast forward one year and on Wednesday night they were filling the spacious ACL Live theater, ahead of Natalie Maines' comeback set, with some enchanting folksy harmonies and rhythms. Those harmonies have earned them far too many Fleet Foxes comparisons — and they're sometimes a bit thinner and wispier than that — but when those rhythms crank up they come alive. \"Time to Run\" does just that, and every band member is armed with some percussion instrument — a shaker, maracas, singer and bandleader Ben Schneider with a small snare. Good tunes when they get up and go.\n\nBest hangover showcase\n\nEmmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell played NPR's Radio Day Stage inside the Austin Convention Center. It was Friday morning, and the soft-spoken angel that is Emmylou strolled out in her boots — cue the Janis Ian song — and quipped that everyone here deserved a merit badge just for navigating through the festival. She meant the confusion and enormity of SXSW, but when she and Crowell played Kris Kristopherson's \"Chase the Feeling\" (\"And you got loaded again / Ain't you handsome when you're high\") many vacant-eyed attendees were nodding with understanding, not rhythm.\n\nWorst showcase logistics\n\nFoxygen was due to play a half hour set Wednesday night at the Hype Hotel, which they started a half hour late. (Out of all the shows I saw this week, two started on time. That's my main complaint about SXSW's rampant growth. They're starting to lose control of their production.) Foxygen is a great, brassy band that sounds superb on their latest record, \"We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic,\" but that interesting sound was completely swallowed up in the ramshackle venue that was the Hype Hotel, an empty commercial cavern hemmed in with sound-eating drywall that appeared to have been nailed up this month. Bummer.\n\nThis post contains my complete running coverage of this annual conference and festival ...\n\n© Chicago Sun-Times\n\nThis SXSW post is not brought to you by an Austin homeless person\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 13, 2012 6:09 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Perhaps you've heard that the zeitgeist at the annual South by Southwest culturefest is now located in the Interactive segment, rather than the conference's original Music portion. Must be true — the first real controversy of SXSW 2012 occurred before many music critics had landed in the Texas capital.\n\nSXSW is now a 10-day event encompassing rollouts of films, digital ventures and new music. The movies and online jibber-jabber started March 9; the music blares on through March 18.\n\nBut it's a crowded event, with celebrities, journalists and industry types jamming the Austin Convention Center and venues throughout downtown. Last year, nearly 20,000 registrants attended the Interactive portion — which wraps up today, just as the Music showcases begin tonight. As you might imagine, mobile bandwidth comes at a premium.\n\nSo BBH Labs, the techie division of the marketing agency BBH, tried a little experiment.\n\nThey gathered 13 people from a local homeless shelter, gave them mobile 4G Wi-Fi devices and sent them into the throng. Each volunteer wore a T-shirt saying, \"I'm [Homeless Person's Name], a 4G Hotspot.\"\n\nMany have found the campaign insensitive. Wired.com wrote that it \"sounds like something out of a darkly satirical science-fiction dystopia.\" Technology blog ReadWriteWeb called it a \"blunt display of unselfconscious gall.\" In an online op-ed, The Washington Post wondered \"Have we lost our humanity?\"\n\nThe company paid the homeless workers $20 up front and a minimum of $50 a day for about six hours work, said Emma Cookson, chairwoman of BBH New York. They also were able to keep whatever customers donated in exchange for the wireless service.\n\nWhen you log on to one of the Homeless Hot Spots sites, customers are introduced to the person providing the connection and are invited to make a donation. A statement on the page reads: \"Homeless Hotspots is a charitable innovation initiative by BBH New York. It attempts to modernize the Street Newspaper model employed to support homeless populations.\"\n\nSaneel Radia, the BBH Labs director who oversaw the project, told the New York Times the company was not taking advantage of the homeless volunteers.\n\nOther might want to get in on the action, though. My cab driver from the airport said, \"Hell, they can load up my cab and I'll drive around with a hundred hotspots, long as I can keep the meter running.\"\n\nContributing: AP\n\nSXSW dials down the digital, cranks up the music\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2012 9:00 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Let the music begin. For days here in the Texas capital, tastemakers from digital ventures and the film industry have been unveiling their wares at the South by Southwest culture conference. Tuesday night, however, the programming shifted back to what built SXSW a quarter century ago: music.\n\nMore than 2,000 bands will roll their gear into Austin during the next few days, performing on more than 90 official stages. Last year, more than 16,000 registrants attended the music portion of the festival, including artists, publicists, industry scouts and a lot of media.\n\nMusic is a hot topic among digital pioneers, of course, so concert stages were under way earlier in the week. Hip-hop titan Jay-Z performed Monday night for an invitation crowd.\n\nTuesday night, as the Interactive sessions died down, the music showcases revved up. Last year was the first time music showcases started backing into the Tuesday of SXSW week, and there were more this year.\n\nChief among them was the return of Philly singer-rapper Santigold, acclaimed upon her 2008 debut and not heard from much since. Now she's out hyping her upcoming sophomore set, \"Master of My Make-Believe,\" due May 1.\n\nThis being Austin, there was also a crowded fete for the loveable and quirky Daniel Johnston, a beloved area singer-songwriter.\n\nThe music programming starts in earnest today and continues through the weekend, with Bruce Springsteen giving the keynote address midday Thursday and performing later that night with the E Street Band, which launches its next tour this weekend.\n\nGot a SiriusXM radio or a friend who does? The SiriusXMU channel is airing SXSW broadcasts all week, including the Friday night outdoor concert by the Shins.\n\nSXSW: Alabama Shakes deserves the hype\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2012 5:06 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Buzz bands at the annual South by Southwest music conference have a lot in common with those who win best new artist at the Grammys. You tend to not hear much from them afterward. (Last year, conference attendees and wristband fans clawed over each other to get into showcases by London fuzz-rock band Yuck. Who? Exactly.)\n\nPossibly the buzziest of the buzz bands at this year's SXSW (so far) is Alabama Shakes — but this is a band you're going to hear much more from.\n\nFresh out of the piney woods just an hour downriver from the legendary soul studios at Muscle Shoals — and with only a couple of EPs to their credit thus far — Alabama Shakes is a fiery quintet of youngsters playing country-soul that both Skynyrd and Otis could love.\n\nThe anticipation generated one of the largest crowds ever for a daytime showcase at the Austin Convention Center, with several hundred filling a ballroom for the group's Wednesday afternoon performance. The band just played a sold-out gig last weekend at Chicago's Lincoln Hall.\n\nFor the most part, the hype is deserved. Lead singer Brittany Howard is a cool storm, one of those young singers exuding confidence beyond her years and presence possibly beyond this earthly realm. She pulls her accent back, often singing through rounded cheeks that add an extra dimension to her growls and wails. Her voice isn't a wide-ranging beast (her high notes are thin), but it's a beast nonetheless, purring like Macy Gray or exploding in very occasional fits of Janis Joplin.\n\nThe band supports her with remarkably restrained backing, controlling the dynamics of every song — slowing down when it wants to get fast, and vice versa — like making great love. Each player keeps things tuneful but spare — leaving huge spaces for Howard to snake through, then unleashing rare bursts of carefully timed fury. In that respect, they could use a songwriting mentor; at least half the set features rocking soul numbers that develop the same way, always ending with the band grinding hard while Howard wails something appropriately animalistic and urgent over and over (\"Feels good!\" or \"Yes, he did!!\" or \"Well, all right!!!\"). The band's ninth and final song, the dramatic groove of \"You Ain't Alone,\" followed that template and resulted in their second standing ovation of the set.\n\nSXSW: Little Steven on TV, Broadway, Springsteen tour\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2012 8:00 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Little Steven Van Zandt had a good chuckle about an alleged rumor reported this week during South by Southwest.\n\nA writer at Magnet music magazine claimed he'd heard that, for their anticipated Thursday night performance during the annual music festival, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band would be performing a version of the Broadway musical \"The Music Man.\" (The writer later confessed, not surprisingly, \"I made it up.\")\n\n\"You never know, though,\" Van Zandt said during a chat Wednesday with the Sun-Times, laughing heartily at the idea. \"[Springsteen] might have some Broadway up his sleeve.\"\n\nVan Zandt is in Austin this week for a couple of reasons. In addition to the Thursday night show, he's also promoting something SXSW hardly deals with it all: a TV show.\n\nFollowing his turn as a gangster in the HBO series \"The Sopranos,\" Van Zandt is again playing a mobster -- this time in a series produced for Norwegian television, \"Lilyhammer.\" The show was recently picked up by Netflix as the streaming service's first original programming.\n\n\"I was in Norway producing one of my bands there, the Cocktail Slippers [an all-girl rock band from Oslo],\" Van Zandt said, \"and these writers came and pitched this to me. I wasn't planning on playing a mobster again, but it's such a great idea. ... The Norwegians have gone crazy for it because they love America and rock and roll. They love the spirit of individualism, which is a bit of a contradiction for them and their community-based government. My character is someone who doesn't follow the rules, and they're very used to following the rules. Someone like me being a little naughty is exotic to them.\"\n\nAfter the SXSW show, the E Street Band kicks off its tour this weekend. The band performed last Friday at New York's Apollo Theater, debuting the five-man horn section that replaces late saxophone legend Clarence Clemons on tour.\n\n\"We'll be featuring our soul music roots more on this tour,\" Van Zandt said. \"And, you know, this year is a celebration of Woody Guthrie [the centennial of his birth]. Quite a bit of Bruce's music is a tribute to Woody Guthrie. ... It just never ceases to amaze me how Bruce continues to write in a way that is vital and very much of the moment. It always keeps us from even thinking about becoming a nostalgia band, because every tour is a whole new everything.\"\n\nSpringsteen is delivering the SXSW keynote address Thursday at noon. His latest solo album, \"Wrecking Ball,\" was just released, and it debuted at No. 1 this week.\n\nSXSW: John Fullbright comes of age\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 14, 2012 11:48 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Let me tell you my quick John Fullbright story before I go on about how mesmerizing and moving his Wednesday evening South by Southwest showcase was.\n\nWhen I was writing about music in Oklahoma, I covered the annual Woody Guthrie Folk Festival each July in Guthrie's hometown of Okemah. Okemah has one motel, which is taken over by the artists and production crews during the festival. Folk singers, in my experience, don't sleep much, and every night after the shows wrapped up in town most of them would drag chairs into the motel parking lot and swap songs till dawn.\n\nEvery now and then, wide-eyed young buskers would stroll up and try to measure up. Few did — until, several years ago, a teenaged Johnny Fullbright strode into to the circle with a banjo over his shoulder. Tipping his cap, the Okemah native offered to play a couple of his own songs. Soon, Arlo Guthrie's eyebrows raised and he sat forward in his lawn chair, and we all knew we were hearing something special.\n\nSince then, Fullbright has shared stages with Joe Ely and fellow Okie songwriter Jimmy Webb, among others, and he recorded a live album. \"From the Ground Up,\" though, will be his studio debut, due May 8 (Blue Dirt/Thirty Tigers).\n\nFullbright's SXSW showcase — the first of eight gigs he has here this week — was as perfect as if it were a Jonathan Demme concert film. Taking the stage at St. David's Episcopal Church in downtown Austin, the unassuming young singer stepped to the mike with his guitar and harmonica rack. He appears meek and milquetoast in his flesh-colored collared shirt and flat, parted hair, but — sorta like Kelly Joe Phelps — the square look is deceiving. He started plucking and blowing and wailing a first-person account of God setting up humans for their inevitable fall, and suddenly another crowd knew it was going to hear something special.\n\nFullbright synthesizes the best songcraft from his home state — Webb, Leon Russell and, by default, Merle Haggard. Just in his 20s, he mournfully considers how \"all my life I've tested truth / but truth's not always sound.\" I'll give him credit for the double entendre in that last line, because the caliber of the rest of his songwriting is so good. He's got a tune called \"Forgotten Flower,\" a thoughtful country lament, that Tom Waits and Randy Newman could fight over.\n\nPossibly unintentionally, Fullbright filled his set on that church chancel with familiar subjects. He opened with \"God Above,\" a searing blues. He sang, \"Glory, glory, hallelujah,\" then played \"Satan and St. Paul\" and \"Jericho.\"\n\nThe last three songs were plunked out on an upright piano, swinging from his own slow ballad \"Nowhere to Be Found\" to the dancing blues of \"Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do.\" The versatility was natural, authentic, untrained. Webb's oft-repeated endorsement predicts \"that in a very short time John Fullbright will be a household name in American music.\" It may not be hyperbole.\n\nSXSW: Ezra Furman, Sharon Van Etten, Mr. Muthaf---in' eXquire, the great R. Stevie Moore\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 15, 2012 9:33 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — \"Is that a dude in his underwear, just playing?\" asked a guy who wandered into The Jr bar just off Sixth Street on Wednesday night. Why, yes, yes it is.\n\nEzra Furman, the mad Evanstonian who recently relocated to the Bay Area, stepped onto the bare stage for his SXSW 2012 showcase nearly bare-assed, wearing only socks and boxer briefs. The rest of him was just the same — wild eyes, spasmodic poses, a spitting earnestness so unnerving you pray he doesn't make eye contact.\n\nHurling a mixture of songs from his new solo album, \"The Year of No Returning,\" and gems from \"Mysterious Power\" and his Chicago tenure with the Harpoons, the skinny folk-punk wunderkind bared his soul, as well, in songs alternating between naked desperation (\"Bloodsucking Whore\") and mournful reverie (a cover of Tom Waits' \"Bottom of the World\"). In a new song, \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,\" he summed up his SXSW moment, singing, \"I was hideous and handsome.\"\n\n\"I was supposed to be a wide-eyed sort of singer-songwriter, but I don't feel like that anymore,\" he said from the stage. \"Too bad, marketing team.\"\n\n• • •\n\nAcclaimed singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten played a demure set Wednesday night at Stubb's. Getting off to a late start, Van Etten plodded through several songs from her attention-getting 2010 debut, \"Epic,\" and her new follow-up, \"Tramp.\" I still don't quite get the slobbering reverence for her work. No doubt, it's encouraging to hear someone with a voice this lovely treading the well-worn road of dissonant strumming and oblique, soul-bearing poetry blazed by fellow New Jersey-raised Patti Smith. Most of the songs merely wear that path down deeper, though, warbling over organ and cymbal-shy drums until they reach big crescendos that stumble to clumsy halts. They're awfully passionate dirges for someone who seems so chipper and cheery during her brief stage banter.\n\n• • •\n\nMr. Muthaf---in' eXquire and his red-hot New York rap crew continued their SXSW gigs Wednesday night at MI Annex on Sixth Street, and the crowd didn't want them to leave. \"eXquire! eXquire!\" they chanted, begging for one more freestyle, to no avail. MMeX is a weird, Wu-Tang-like mob of half a dozen rappers, and the group's namesake is a hulking, slurring nutjob with percolating flow. Wednesday night, he was spewing syllables so fast and without stopping that he began to slouch and collapse. At the climactic moment, he shot up as his mates punctuated the verse, shouting, \"Breathe!\" Huzzah!\n\n• • •\n\nSince the early 1970s, \"singer\"-songwriter R. Stevie Moore has been producing song after song after song — countless hours of tape — documenting the weird and wonderful corners of his mind. As the Trouser Press record guides have stated for years, \"'Unsung hero' only touches on the injustice of obscurity for this wry, heartfelt artist whose limber genius.\" But he meandered into the SXSW spotlight this week for a few showcases, including a typically bewildering set of songs Wednesday afternoon in the middle of the SXSW trade show.\n\n\"Why would anyone come to South by Southwest to see Lionel Richie?\" Moore sang in a seemingly off-the-cuff ditty about the preponderance of big-name bookings at this year's festival, which was born in the late '80s as a haven for spotlighting up-and-coming talent. \"If I had to choose between Lionel Richie and Sufjan Stevens, it would be a dead heat.\"\n\nA large fella, in shades and with a wild Santa Claus-white beard and hair fluttering every which way, Moore plunked out his crafty lyrics and bent tunes on acoustic guitar. From his bottomless repository of material, he plucked a remarkable cache of quirky love songs, such as \"Traded My Heart for Your Parts\" and, uh, \"I Wanna Hit You\" (which he punctuated with, \"Pow! To the moon, Alice!\"). Looking at him, a deranged Wilford Brimley gargling his notes and strumming herky-jerky chords, the song \"Goodbye Piano\" took on new resonance: \"You're so out of tune / I assume you're dead.\"\n\nSXSW keynote: Bruce Springsteen gives musical history lesson, celebrates Woody Guthrie centennial\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 15, 2012 3:22 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Marveling at the breadth of contemporary pop music, Bruce Springsteen name-checked his own lengthy list of milestone influences during a funny and enlightening keynote address Thursday at the South by Southwest music conference.\n\nThe king of this particular musical Mardi Gras, Springsteen hit town Wednesday night and showed up to jam with Joe Ely and Alejandro Escovedo at the Austin Music Awards. In addition to his keynote speech, the Springsteen blitz continues tonight in concert with the E Street Band, a preview of the tour kicking off this weekend. His latest album, \"Wrecking Ball,\" was released last week and debuted at No. 1 in 14 countries.\n\n\"No one hardly agrees on anything in pop anymore,\" Springsteen said in his opening remarks. He expressed awe at the number of bands booked at SXSW.\n\n\"There are so many subgenres and factions,\" he continued — and then amused the standing-room crowd by listing as many as he could name, dozens of hyphenated musical classifications and creations, from melodic death metal and sadcore to rap-rock and Nintendocore. He ended the list with a slight slump, saying, \"And folk music.\"\n\n\"This is all going on in this town right now,\" he said.\n\nCiting rock critic Lester Bangs' assertion that Elvis Presley was the last thing Americans would agree on, Springsteen said each of the thousands of bands booked during SXSW \"has the belief to turn Bangs' prophecy around.\n\n\"The one thing that's been consistent over the years is the genesis and the power of creativity. It's all about how you're putting what you do together. The elements you're using don't matter. It's not confined to guitars, tubes, turntables or microchips. There's no right way, no pure way of doing it — there's just doing it.\"\n\nSpringsteen then took the rapt audience on a tour through his own musical upbringing, noting each notable inspiration that molded him — from Presley's appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1956 through poetic descriptions of the power he felt coming from doo-wop, Roy Obison, Phil Spector, British Invasion bands, the Beatles, country, soul, Stax, Motown and Dylan.\n\nHe spent extra time on the Animals. \"For me, the Animals were a revelation,\" he said. \"That was the first full-blown class-consciousness I'd ever heard.\"\n\nHe sang and strummed most of \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place,\" a song the Animals made famous, and declared, \"That's every song I've ever written! That's all of them, I'm not kidding. That's 'Born to Run,' 'Born in the U.S.A.,' even the new ones.\" He played the riff from \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" then the riff from his own \"Badlands\": \"Same f---ing riff, man.\"\n\nAcknowledging that this is the centennial year of Woody Guthrie's birth, Springsteen concluded with how he's been inspired by the American folk legend to keep his own lyrical focus on the issues of working people. He was also honest about their differences.\n\n\"I knew I was never going to be Woody Guthrie. I liked the pink Cadillac too much. I liked the luxuries and comforts of being a star. I'd already gone a long way down a pretty different road,\" Springsteen said.\n\nIn the end, Springsteen tried to bring it back to music's colorful mass, the overwhelming amount of it, the dizzying scope of its styles as evidenced in SXSW itself. The thread fans and artists must needle out of the experience, he said, has always been the same no matter how many subgenres there are.\n\n\"Here we are in this town celebrating a sense of freedom that was Woody's legacy,\" Springsteen said. \"We live in a post-authentic world. Authenticity today is just a house of mirrors. It's all about what you're bringing when the lights go down. At the end of the day, it's power and purpose that matters.\"\n\n• • •\n\nThe Woody Guthrie connection bookended Springsteen's keynote.\n\nImmediately before the speech on the same stage, American singer-songwriters Jimmy LaFave and Eliza Gilkyson strummed Guthrie songs, such as \"Oklahoma Hills,\" \"I Ain't Got No Home in This World\" and \"Deportee.\" Colombia's Juanes played a couple of his own songs, spirited tunes in Spanish he said were inspired by Guthrie. All three lead the sleepy SXSW crowd in a singalong of \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nA panel session followed the keynote, titled \"Woody at 100.\" Moderated by Bob Santelli, executive director at the Grammy Museum and a Guthrie scholar himself, the panel featured journalist Dave Marsh, scholar Doug Brinkley, songwriters LaFave and Joel Rafael, and two of Guthrie's children: singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie and head of the Woody Guthrie Foundation & Archives, Nora Guthrie.\n\nNora discussed the pending move of her father's archives — thousands of original lyrics, poems, notebooks, journals, artwork and more — from its current New York home to a new facility in Tulsa, Okla. She also highlighted a theme from Springsteen's keynote about music's many styles, noting that Woody wrote all kinds of music, including love songs and Jewish music.\n\nArlo made some important distinctions about his dad's legacy amid all the discussion of it in this centennial year.\n\n\"There are a lot of different Woodys,\" he said. \"Even having known him along with my sister, I don't know that anybody has the capacity to have fully understand anyone. ... He really had the ability to distill all of us and put it into a way so that we recognize our own voice coming back to us. He said, 'Let me be known as a man who told you something you already knew.' ... Everybody in this room has a little voice they count on that they recognize as being them. My father recognized that voice in him and reflected it back on you so you recognize something that rings true to you. I don't think we're actually celebrating Woody — we're celebrating us. That's the genius of the man.\"\n\nFor a complete list of the numerous Guthrie centennial events around the country, see woody100.com.\n\nPower pop @ SXSW: Big Star tribute, dB's reunion\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 16, 2012 10:32 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — At the 2010 South by Southwest music conference, critics and fans were eager for a scheduled celebration of the '70s band Big Star. The influential pop-rock band was at the height of a popular resurgence, fueled in part by a stellar box set (\"Keep an Eye on the Sky\") released the previous year. A panel session was planned, a hotly anticipated concert, too. But on the first day of the festival, bandleader and power-pop icon Alex Chilton died.\n\nThe pieces of those plans were reassembled in earnest Thursday night at SXSW 2012. In a star-studded concert — featuring a pantheon of alt-rock greats including R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, Wilco's Pat Sansone, Tommy Stinson, Peter Case, Chris Stamey, Ken Stringfellow, Jon Auer, M. Ward and many more, plus Big Star's lone survivor, drummer Jody Stephens — musicians inspired by the band, complete with a 12-piece orchestra, performed the whole of Big Star's \"Third,\" their emotionally tangled and rightly acclaimed album recorded in 1974 and released by 1978.\n\nStamey — also appearing several times at SXSW this week with the reunited dB's (see below) — has made these \"Third\" gigs into something of a pet project, performing them a few times ahead of the festival. But Thursday's gig, back in something of an emotional center for the band and its fans, resonated with obvious love from the musicians, especially a smiling Stamey, who never sang but acted as bandleader.\n\nMixing up the album's various sequences, the show opened with M. Ward on piano meandering through Eden Ahbez's \"Nature Boy,\" an outtake from \"Third.\" Players and singers then started cycling behind the microphone. British pub band the Dunwells delivered \"Take Care\" with Irish balladry and an accordion. The Mayflies' Matt McMichaels lead a steady \"Jesus Christ.\" Auer, who had joined a revived lineup of Big Star, drove slowly through \"Black Car,\" fueled by the string quartet.\n\nStandouts included Stinson, formerly of the Replacements, redeeming himself with a solid version of \"Nightime.\" Watching him in his skinny plaid suit and hipster hat, one could almost forget he now slums in the reconstituted Guns N' Roses. Peter Case, once a svelte New Wave rocker in the Plimsouls, appeared shaggy and bearded and did his best Van Morrison impression through \"Stroke It Noel\" (Stamey's smile was a thousand watts through that one). Sansone's \"You Can't Have Me\" was powerful even without the wailing saxophone and the two drum solos from Stephens.\n\nStephens himself stepped out from behind the kit to sang a couple of songs, including a string-laden \"Blue Moon\" beautifully arranged with a Pachelbel's Canon sway.\n\nR.E.M.'s Mike Mills originally was scheduled to be on stage for the show, but he canceled due to illness. The former band's guitarist, Buck, appeared instead. He merely lurked in the background for two songs, the cover of the Velvet Underground's \"Femme Fatale\" and \"You Can't Have Me.\"\n\nThe show closed with \"Thank You Friends,\" featuring most of the cast back on stage, like a traditional \"This Land Is Your Land\" folk finale.\n\nThe Big Star concert followed a screening of a documentary, still in progress, called \"Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me\" from director Drew DeNicola.\n\n• • •\n\nStamey's a busy boy at SXSW 2012. In addition to corralling that large cast of players for the Big Star tribute, he's got his own showcase on Saturday, plus he and the reunited dB's are scheduled six times here this week.\n\nWednesday afternoon was their first showcase, on the Dogwood patio on West Sixth Street. Featuring originals Stamey, singer-guitarist Peter Holsapple and drummer Will Rigby, plus acclaimed Southern producer and artist Mitch Easter on bass, this latest revival of the beloved '80s power-pop group is hawking a new album, \"Falling Off the Sky,\" due in June.\n\nThey utilized their showcase to show off many of the new tracks — as jangly and tuneful as ever. Holsapple insists the new album is \"a great summertime record,\" and as he sang the new \"World to Cry,\" a wind-blown tree in the courtyard approved by showering the tightly packed audience with new buds.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and tanlines. Another new song jangled over a martial rhythm and lyrics of lament and paralysis. Stamey remarked, \"On my tombstone, I want, 'He wrote one great riff.'\" Then he added, \"Plus a lot of depressing songs.\" He then ripped a scary, dissonant solo from the heart of \"Happenstance,\" which the band balanced with the gentle waves of melody in \"Love Is for Lovers.\"\n\nTheir official showcase is tonight.\n\n• • •\n\nFast forward to the 21st century: Power-pop rocker Brendan Benson was back on stage as a solo act Thursday night. Jack White's partner in the Raconteurs, Benson funnels most of his melodic talents into his solo albums. He has yet to make a bad one, and his next, \"What Kind of World,\" is due in April on his new independent label Readymade.\n\nHis Thursday showcase wasn't as flawless as his records. Stringy-haired and a little adrift, Benson charged gamely through some new songs, though one had to be abandoned after the first verse; he tried to restart it, but flubbed something again and moved on into a duo of the Raconteurs' \"Hands\" and his own \"Cold Hands (Warm Heart)\" (in which he laments, \"Why does it always happen...?\").\n\nSXSW: Fiona Apple's splendid case of nerves\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 16, 2012 12:05 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Alabama Shakes might be one of the buzziest new bands at this year's South by Southwest music conference, but Fiona Apple is the one of the hottest returning-act tickets. After not having been seen outside of Los Angeles in years, and with her last record of emotionally taut pop-cabaret released in 2005, two lines for her second showcase Thursday night snaked around the block in different directions.\n\nPerforming in a Presbyterian church, Apple strode purposefully onto a candlelit stage with a four-piece band and launched into \"Fast as You Can.\" Still a frenetic ball of anxiety, when Apple stands at a microphone without a piano to occupy her hands her nervous energy nearly flings her limbs apart. Thursday night she wore a white shawl over her shoulders, which she immediately took to flipping and waving about like a manic Stevie Nicks. Banging fists against her body, flailing her arms, pounding the piano — one senses that without the music to focus her energy she'd go utterly mad. Then again, she can rein herself and become the perfect picture of Marlene Dietrich smolder, as she did during \"Paper Bag.\"\n\nApple's voice is not a smooth or delicate instrument. It's guttural and trembling and sounds ravaged by a prior hour of sobbing; midway through her Thursday concert, she made a brief show of spraying some salve into the back of her throat. The songs fit the sound — lyric after lyric of man after man who doesn't understand her (the dolt who won't even kiss her in the right place in the new \"Anything We Want\") and heaps of self-doubt (\"I'm gonna f--- it up\" from \"Mistake\"). \"Not that I go to church or anything,\" Apple said, gazing up at the shadowy altar, \"but I'd like to apologize to the building itself for my cursing.\"\n\nThe band supports the crackling tension with herky-jerky soul-jazz phrases, as if Elvis Costello's \"Spike\" is drowning his sorrows at L.A.'s Largo club (home of the acclaimed residencies curated by Apple producer and compatriot Jon Brion). Prone to lengthy vamps and calliope-like refrains, the music's drunken gentility was often pierced by tinny, edgy solos from her guitarist. Every song was a suspense thriller, and as Woody Allen said, \"I hope it lasts.\"\n\nBriefly, anyway — her SXSW showcases kick off a tiny tour, just a few dates including two sold-out shows Sunday and Monday at Chicago's Lincoln Hall.\n\nApple's new album returns to her penchant for lengthy titles — (inhale) it's \"The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do\" — is scheduled for a June release.\n\nSXSW hip-hop fusion: K. Flay, Idle Warship, Robert Glasper\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 16, 2012 5:51 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — Kristine Flaherty grew up in Wilmette. She went to Stanford. She's also a helluva rapper.\n\nWith frenetic flow and live-wire, chicken-dance moves, K. Flay barreled through a Friday showcase at Austin's Red Eyed Fly, crumpling labels and defying genres. Backed by an excellent live drummer, Nicholas Suhr, she crafted loops and samples with real finesse, utilizing grinding guitar sounds and squawky electronic noises for melody and music more than mere beats and punctuation. \"We're going to go to a fun place in our minds,\" she said by way of introducing one song. It was less invitation than advisory — she picked up drumsticks and attacked her own percussion pad, and she and Suhr lost themselves momentarily in a rhythmic freakout of ecstatic proportions.\n\nK. Flay's sharpest weapon, though, is her fast-talking tongue. Her words-per-minute reached the red line almost every time. One song began with a slow, easygoing beat (no drummer), as she started rapping along. The beat kept modulating, faster and faster, and for three or four minutes she kept slinging syllables without a single flub or nonsense gibberish. Who knows what she wound up saying? But given the rest of her wisecracking, hard-hearted material -- all that's out thus far is an EP, \"Eyes Shut,\" available free on her web site -- it's worth hearing at any speed.\n\n• • •\n\nIdle Warship — a new collaboration between acclaimed rapper Talib Kweli and Philly soul singer Res — released an album last fall that was mostly great, a fizzy mix of hip-hop, R&B and rock with just the right balance between all three. The group's SXSW showcases were highly anticipated — but, alas, their Friday afternoon show was ho-hum.\n\nBacked by a live quartet, Kweli and Res ping-ponged their vocal duties and spent an inordinate amount of time asking the crowd for cheers instead of earning them. Kweli turned the word \"soul\" in one song into a falsetto, drawn-out \"Soul Train\" nod, but the music, which is buoyant and bouncy on record, lurched and lagged live. Even the synth underpinning of Corey Hart's \"Sunglasses at Night\" in the song \"Steady,\" which eventually morphed into the whole band singing the Eurhythmics' \"Sweet Dreams,\" failed to brighten the desperate energy on stage. The term \"rap-rock\" has certain negative connotations; this isn't really rap-rock, but it's close. A 21st-century Digable Planets, unfortunately, they ain't.\n\n• • •\n\nIn one sense, I'd like to thank the sound engineers who had difficulty getting things in gear for the Robert Glasper Experiment showcase late Thursday night at the Elephant Room. Without their delay, some room in the tiny, dank club might not have opened up and I'd have missed the whole show standing on queue. The sound was substandard even when the show got under way, but those who made it in heard enough to justify the hype that brought us there.\n\nGlasper is a hip-hop wunderkind. Glasper is a jazz juggernaut. A pianist, a Texas native, he seems to be knitting a new kind of fusion. A set that opens with Coltrane (sax player Casey Benjamin is pretty wicked, see video below) and nearly winds up with Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" might only turn the head of zeitgeist interpreters like Brad Mehldau, but Glasper's quartet followed their open-minded explorations through the jazz tones, hip-hop beats and raucous rock with more ferocity than irony. His latest album, \"Black Radio\" (Blue Note), does the same thing and features guests like Mos Def and Chicago's Lupe Fiasco.\n\nOccupy SXSW: Tom Morello carries Woody Guthrie torch through protest showcase, street party\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2012 10:20 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — During his keynote speech at this year's South by Southwest music conference, Bruce Springsteen referred to folksinger Woody Guthrie as \"a ghost in the machine.\" In the centennial year of his birth, Guthrie has certainly haunted SXSW 2012. Springsteen and many others have sung his songs. \"Woody at 100,\" a panel session featuring his children, Nora and Arlo Guthrie, considered his legacy.\n\nThen Friday night, Chicago-area native Tom Morello capped off his showcase in the middle of the street, leading a throng of Occupy Austin demonstrators in a sing-along of \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\n\"I am the Nightwatchman and this is a one man revolution!\" said Morello (who performs solo under the moniker The Nightwatchman) at the beginning of his SXSW showcase, scheduled inside the Swan Dive bar near Sixth Street and Red River in downtown Austin.\n\nBut days earlier, Morello began reorganizing what the festival had programmed for him. His showcase, he declared, would become Occupy SXSW — all 99 percenters welcome. \"SXSW has a lot of specialty shows — record companies, vodka companies, promoters and things like that,\" he told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. \"I thought it was important that at a music gathering of that size, to have a place where the rebels, revolutionaries, rockers, rappers and the 99 percent could gather and have a mighty SXSW throw down.\"\n\nVia social media and online networks, Occupy Austin spread the word and gathered Friday at the state capitol three hours before Morello's midnight showcase. The group of nearly 100 began marching toward the downtown streets already crowded with SXSW registrants and hopeful music fans.\n\nHow do you get a mob to move through a mob? By dancing. The benevolent Occupiers rolled a sound system with them, blaring mostly disco and dance tunes but also raising a ruckus with \"Killing in the Name\" by Rage Against the Machine, Morello's former hard rock band. About every block, they'd stop and dance, as well as wave some signs and hand out fliers. At Sixth and Brazos, the assembly inadvertently blocked traffic, which laid on the horns. The honking, however, simply raised more cheers and whoops.\n\nSlowly, the demonstrators made their way down Sixth Street toward Morello's venue. One large banner reading \"F--- the Police\" was its own crowd control issue, because gawking passers-by insisted the bearers stop -- so they could take their picture with it. Irony of ironies: Midway down the street the group had to detour slightly after being blocked by a drum circle.\n\nMorello started his official showcase about half an hour late, playing a few songs by himself before bringing on his latest band, the Freedom Fighter Orchestra — and, later, special guest Wayne Kramer from Detroit punk legend the MC5 — to tear through typically fiery Nightwatchman songs, including \"Save the Hammer for the Man\" and \"Union Town,\" as well as Rage's \"Bulls on Parade.\" The previous night, Morello had joined Springsteen on stage during his SXSW concert; Friday, Morello played Springsteen's \"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\" dedicating it to \"the only Boss worth listening to.\"\n\nAs his official timeslot ended, Morello told the crowd — primarily SXSW badge-holders inside — to follow him outside. There, the largely uncredentialed Occupy crowd had been watching the showcase on a video projected on the wall. Morello proceeded to start a second showcase in the middle of the street, which he called \"the people's venue\" — carrying his acoustic guitar, which has \"Whatever It Takes\" scrawled on it (Guthrie's guitar famously sported the slogan \"This Machine Kills Fascists\") — and leading the crowd in a rollicking sing-along of \"This Land.\"\n\nLack of a PA didn't stop him — not when you have the \"human microphone.\"\n\n\"Mic check!\" Morello called, and the crowd began repeating him. In a very Obama-like delivery, he went on: \"They can turn off the PA, but they can't shut this party down!\"\n\nHe told a tale about guitar factory workers in South Korea who were fired because they formed a union. Using the human mic, he taught the crowd the chorus to his \"World Wide Rebel Songs\" and lead another sing-along.\n\nHe then ended the event with yet another Guthrie quip: \"Take it easy,\" he shouted, \"but take it!\"\n\nCatch Morello when he leads a Woody Guthrie tribute concert May 19 at Chicago's Metro, featuring Holly Near, the Klezmatics, Jon Langford, Bucky Halker and more.\n\nSXSW: Hospitality, Ava Luna, Joe Pug\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2012 11:55 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — There's buzz, and there's buzz. When people insist you see a band at South by Southwest, it's usually dicey. When people recommend a band like this — \"Aw, Hospitality. They're really good. I'd like to see them again\" — that you take a little more seriously.\n\nThe buzzy Brooklyn band's Friday night showcase at Frank was definitely worth the recommendations, and then some. Unassuming and sometimes unobtrusive, Hospitality segued from sound check to set without any fanfare or introduction; the snugly packed crowd in the small bar simply enjoyed the revelation that, hey, that beautiful music is the room's centerpiece now.\n\nHospitality, like its namesake, creeps up like that, anyway.\n\nCreating a sound way bigger than the sum of its basic quartet lineup, this is indie-pop with bright colors, effervescent arrangements and, most importantly, real swing. Underneath the big, fat, chiming guitar chords and singer-guitarist Amber Papini's conversational patter is usually a firm beat, certainly a supple groove thanks to left-handed bassist Brian Betancourt. They could probably go toe-to-toe with most dance-rockers from the first wave (Franz Ferdinand, etc.), but they'd also have a calming effect on them. \"The Right Profession,\" from this year's self-titled debut, certainly moves, and \"Friends of Friends\" enjoys a groovy dance break, but other songs sometimes noodle, sometimes vamp, sometimes slip into a positively Pink Floyd reverie.\n\n• • •\n\nIf Steely Dan worked to sound like the actual future, rather than Donald Fagen's nostalgic 1950s Worlds Fair perspective on it, they might sound something like Brooklyn's Ava Luna. A thrilling, lurching, bewildering, surprising frenzy of genre-splicing, this sextet's Friday night return to SXSW at the Iron Bear club rocked and grooved and glitched.\n\nDriven by rhythms that stutter and fray, Ava Luna's 21st-century rock 'n' soul is humanized by no-nonsense vocals. Becca Kauffman and Felicia Douglass bring seriousness and sass, when called for, but it's singer-guitarist Carlos Hernandez that embodies the band's schizophrenic joy. Playing with an ADD tic justifying lyrics like, \"If I could focus,\" Hernandez sings like a less-somnambulant James Blake — all heady methol and melancholy. It's headbanging dubstep, it's postmodern soul, full of sound and fury, and when some feedback began ebbing and flowing between songs — hey, some of us thought it was just part of the band's space-age sound.\n\n• • •\n\nChicago's Joe Pug sounds like a native down here in Texas. Biting his lip, chewing his accent, flashing his winsome smile or sometimes wincing with emotion, Pug is the picture of down-home earnestness.\n\nSqueezing in just five songs for the Folk Alliance showcase on Saturday at Threadgill's, Pug played a handful of thoughtful country-folk tunes from his second album, \"The Great Despiser,\" due next month. That's after he broke a guitar string — on the first strum of the first chord in the first song -- which was surprising given how tender and delicate most of the material is, augmented here with only an occasional electric guitarist and a stand-up bassist. But the new album features guests such as the Hold Steady's Craig Finn, so it's gonna roll. To close, Pug was joined by Austin music legend Harvey Thomas Young for his song, previously covered by Pug, \"Start Again.\"\n\nSXSW: Don Cornelius, 'Soul Train' celebrated\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2012 4:54 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — \"Soul Train\" creator and host Don Cornelius was left out of the Grammys' \"in memorium\" slide show last month, barely two weeks after the Chicago television pioneer was found dead of an apparent suicide, but he was celebrated Saturday at the annual South by Southwest music conference in the Texas capital.\n\nAt an event called \"'Soul Train' Tribute to Don Cornelius,\" NPR's Dan Charnas conducted an amiable onstage chat with Don's son Tony Cornelius about the TV music show's history and legacy.\n\n\"If he'd come back here and see the love from those who miss him so much, I wonder, would he decide to stay?\" Tony Cornelius asked during the session. \"He had so much love to live for. It hurts me that he's not here.\"\n\n\"Soul Train\" was one of TV's longest-running syndicated shows, airing for 36 years. Launched at Chicago's WCIU in 1970, the music performance and dance program went national the following year and was crucial in showcasing black soul and R&B artists to a wider audience, including Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson.\n\n\"Dad talked about that quite often,\" Cornelius said. \"He found a need, and he served it. There was a need to allow not only the music of black Americans but kids an opportunity to express themselves.\"\n\nCharnas showed numerous video clips -- \"Soul Train\" performances, dancers, pivotal moments, Afro Sheen commercials (the sponsorship of Chicago-based Johnson Products was important to the show's early survival) -- and Cornelius commented.\n\n\"When I watch these clips, what comes to mind that people don't understand is these performances were about relationships. It wasn't, 'I want to do \"Soul Train,\"' it was friendships that developed over time,\" Cornelius said.\n\nMany of those relationships began early in Chicago, where Don Cornelius negotiated complete ownership of \"Soul Train\" at WCIU because \"no one believed\" in the show, Tony Cornelius said.\n\nTony Cornelius was around age 12 when \"Soul Train\" premiered. He worked as a runner, cable mover, lighting operator and more throughout the years, eventually becoming an executive producer. From the start, he recalled, \"Soul Train\" was a family affair.\n\n\"My most vivid memory is my mother writing out cards of all the kids who wanted to dance on the show from high schools around the area,\" he said.\n\n\"The groundswell in Chicago was so exciting that [Don] decided Los Angeles would be the place to take it. That's where the stars were, where the acts were.\"\n\nHe took one thing with him, though: the Scramble Board.\n\nMembers of the audience were often selected for the Scramble Board, where they would reorder a jumbled set of letters to spell the name of a prominent black American. Don Cornelius later admitted that the gimmick was always fixed.\n\n\"It's funny, but it's true,\" Tony Cornelius said. \"It's something he felt extremely strong about. We were speaking to the world, not just the dancers, and informing anyone who didn't know Stevie Wonder's name or Thurgood Marshall's name how to spell it and who they were.\"\n\nCornelius said years later he suggested to his father that they update the Scramble Board to something digital or more contemporary. Don refused, saying he wanted to maintain that set piece — the one piece of the Chicago set that traveled to L.A.\n\nIn honor of his father, Cornelius said the family has created the Don Cornelius Foundation to raise awareness, prevention and support for those contemplating suicide and aid for its survivors.\n\nSXSW global: K-pop, Juanes, Bensh, Noa Margalit\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 18, 2012 12:14 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — This year's South by Southwest features music acts from every continent except Antarctica (those penguins aren't as musical as you've been lead to believe). Here's some of the international flavor I sampled this week:\n\n• • •\n\nThe panel session at SXSW 2012 was titled with a question — \"Do Music Moguls Know a Secret About K-Pop?\" — but the non-insider query is simpler: Do you know what K-pop is?\n\nIt's a genre of hyper-produced, often sugary sweet pop music mostly out of South Korea. It's got its own Billboard chart, and in December launched its own festival (K-Pop World, Dec. 7 in Seoul). According to the moderator of this industry panel, it's \"a huge thing across Asia and other parts of the world,\" and it's about to invade the states.\n\nEarlier in the year, I suggested 2012 might have a more worldly sound, including more K-pop. Already in the United States, South Korean idol Kim Hyun-a has attracted media attention, and when K-pop acts tour this country it's not just their music that turns American heads.\n\n\"People often are stopping because of how many people show up\" to these concerts, said Flowsion Shekar, founder of Koreaboo, a Korean news blog.\n\nDavid Zedeck, a booking agent at Creative Artists Agency, said he's selling out 1,700 to 2,500-capacity venues with K-pop, even in interior cities like Atlanta, Kansas City and Denver. The group Girls Generation announced via Twitter that they would premiering a new video at a New York Best Buy. \"We had 1,500 kids show up on a school day — from a tweet,\" he marveled. \"This is bigger than anyone thinks it is.\"\n\nOther prominent K-pop acts include Bigbang, JYP, the Wonder Girls and SMTown.\n\n\"Even though it comes from Korea, it's not of or for Korea anymore,\" said Jeff Yang, the Tao Jones columnist for the Wall Street Journal (\"It wasn't my idea,\" he said sheepishly of his column's name). \"It's become a world music. There are more people who don't understand Korean listening to K-pop than in Korea.\"\n\nYang predicted K-pop could develop in America one of two ways: It could become like Latin music, a cultural identifier for Asian-American communities, or it could establish itself as a platform like hip-hop, inviting collaboration and eventual evolution into something larger.\n\nSome of the latter already is happening. Kanye West previously worked with the trio JYJ (rapping on the single \"Ayyy Girl\") and has said he plans to do more with the group. Snoop Dogg recently appeared on a track by Girls Generation, and DJ Swizz Beatz says he's hoping to help bring K-pop acts like Bigbang (currently atop the K-pop charts, No. 1 and 2) to America.\n\n• • •\n\nIn addition to performing his own and Woody Guthrie's song immediately before Bruce Springsteen's keynote address at SXSW 2012 — one of his first English-language performances — Colombian singer Juanes has been making multiple appearances at the festival all week. He discussed his upcoming May album, \"Juanes MTV Unplugged,\" during a Friday panel session, then performed during the Latin rock showcase later that night.\n\nIn an AP interview, he celebrated the cultural smorgasbord that is SXSW: \"It's such a great opportunity to interact together and exchange culture. I just feel the world now and the world is absolutely sick, you know, so I just see music and culture and art in general as a great idea to change at least our own environment and just connect people to the music. You can just go and walk around the street and you can see bands from I don't know, wherever, and they can sing in Chinese if you want. You just have the opportunity to connect with somebody else you didn't know, and that's good.\"\n\n• • •\n\nThe sheer volume of music at SXSW makes random discoveries possible, probable and the payoff is often good. Thursday night I stopped for stir-fry at one of Austin's better food trucks downtown near Fifth and Brazos. On the corner a trio of Austrian vagabonds was playing to anyone who'd stop and listen. They're called Bensh, and they don't sound like a sidewalk band. Good-spirited pop with flourishes of electronics and gypsy bounce, Bensh's fluid, well-crafted pop caused me to scribble a seemingly bizarre list of comparisons in my notebook: Luka Bloom, Deathray, Syd Barrett, Animal Collective, the Monochrome Set. Much spunkier live than on record, Bensh still made a great impulse download that was perfectly dreamy in the earbuds during a pedicab ride home.\n\n• • •\n\nA showcase of musicians from Israel, sponsored by the Israeli Consul, ran all day Friday in a downtown park. I caught an acoustic set by Noa Margalit, from the rock band the Car Sitters. Listening to her stoic personal songs, you'd never guess how energetic the Car Sitters usually are. Tel Aviv's Margalit — breathy, barefoot, bar-chording the heck out of her guitar — played things close to the vest, at least sonically. Lyrically, she was raging about politics and quality of life, lamenting (or marveling?) that \"it doesn't take much to survive.\"\n\nLater, J. Viewz, aka Grammy-nominated and Brooklyn-based producer Jonathan Dagan, let loose some throbbing beats with a soulful vocalist and great live drums.\n\nThis post contains my complete running coverage of this annual conference and festival ...\n\nRolling into town for SXSW, so is Jack White's Rolling Record Store\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 16, 2011 4:58 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — When I first attended South by Southwest, the annual pop music conference and festival in Austin, Texas (the music industry's spring break), it was 1996, just shy of the event's 10th anniversary — and everyone was already complaining about how big it had gotten. Too many bands, too much press, too much traffic. The film fest had barely started.\n\nThis year is the 25th anniversary of SXSW's music showcases, which are now preceded by SXSW Interactive and the SXSW film festival. The whole things stretches on for 10 days, with a lot of entertainment, a lot of media and a ton of traffic — and now most of the complaints about size and impact have shifted to Interactive. But we're all down here because SXSW still has a rep of previewing the films, music and online experiences that we'll be geeking out about for the rest of the year.\n\nIt starts the moment you get off the plane, where a brave singer-songwriter strummed her guitar on a makeshift stage at the airport bar next to the baggage claim escalators. For the next four nights, the Texas capital will echo with more than a thousand musicians hoping to turn the heads of writers, talent agents, music supervisors, film directors, label execs and more.\n\nJack White was first into the fray this afternoon ...\n\nWhite's in town to unveil his latest venture after his recent confirmation that the White Stripes are no more. White is on a mission to salvage the experience of record buying for a generation of iTunes downloaders. He's put together the Third Man Rolling Record Store — basically a food truck that peddles vinyl LPs, T-shirts and such, plus a sound system. Wednesday afternoon, White worked that system, playing a set in front of the Rolling Record Store, which had set up outside Frank's Diner. He played a handful of songs solo, including a Buddy Holly cover, plus the White Stripes' \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.\"\n\nThe mobile shop rolled here from Nashville for SXSW. White says he plans to travel the country with it, hitting the summer festivals.\n\nSXSW Wednesday: Colourmusic, Wolf Gang, the Kickback, Admiral Fallow, Pete Wentz's Black Cards\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2011 2:56 AM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — SXSW is basically a musical March madness. Here's one man's brackets at the end of Wednesday night's series of showcases:\n\nBRONCHO: When in doubt, follow Martin Atkins. The famed drummer for Public Image Ltd. and Pigface led a spirited panel Wednesday afternoon advising newbies to the music business, then started his evening at the Oklahoma showcase, seeing BRONCHO. Funny about that name: it's in all caps, for some reason, and it's pronounced so it rhymes with honcho. Tulsa's BRONCHO is the latest project from Ryan Lindsey, who manages to meld his experience in the alt-country band Cheyenne and early indie-rock hopefuls the Starlight Mints into a sweaty mix of loping cowpunk and Stiff Records guitar aggression. Atkins was bobbing his head, anyway.\n\nColourmusic: Another Okie quartet, Colourmusic, hoisted the freak flags over Austin's Sixth Avenue early, unleashing a squall of early Flaming Lips feedback, general high-pitched shrieking and, surprisingly, some meaty funk grooves. This is some serious evolution for a band that started as a more folk-driven, Britpop act (see their more accessible debut, the cumbersomely titled \"F, Monday, Orange, February, Venus, Lunatic, 1 or 13\") — and then they met the Lips' Wayne Coyne. Underneath the Brainiac-like furor, though, are some solid, funky rhythms. One fan was moved enough to tear off his shirt, jump on stage and dance ecstatically for all to see.\n\nThe Kickback: Guitarist-singer Billy Yost quipped between songs, \"If you work in the entertainment industry and would like a hot record to put out, boy would we like to talk to you!\" Here's hoping they had their chat. Chicago's the Kickback is a fierce power trio within a quintet — Yost, his brother Danny Yost on drums and bassist Zach Verdoorn. Tighter than a flea's undies, these three plow through every dynamic, from sweetly tuneful to apoplectic fury, buttressed by Billy Yost's apparent natural edginess (his stage banter was taut, nervous, like he was spoiling for a dust-up) and a vein in his neck that bulged whenever things got really good and really loud. It was almost like seeing David Garza at SXSW all those years ago.\n\nAdmiral Fallow: Here's the next Scottish band to watch. In the tradition of Belle & Sebastian, but with a more rock edge and a significantly grandiose songwriting perspective, Admiral Fallow is fertile with song styles and instrumentation. Opening their set late with a quiet tune, a lyric buoyed by rhythm guitars just for atmospherics, not melody, this six-piece played pastoral pop for those who've also been turned on to Mumford & Sons or their own countrymen, Frightened Rabbit. I heard the urgency and persistent rhythm of Dogs Die in Hot Cars (a fabulous but, with that silly name, defunct Scottish band), as well as a lyrical landscape of losers and big spaces that reminded me of American Music Club. With their flutes, clarinets and big drums in addition to the guitars, they could be Scotland Music Club, and they should start opening for the National immediately.\n\nBlack Cards: A small crowd waited for Pete Wentz to shag it from the mtvU Woodie Awards across downtown and finally debut his new band. He jumped on stage early Thursday morning with a crazy fur hat on and cranked up a fairly dime-a-dozen set of dance-rock. Black Cards is led by Bebe Rexha, a personable newcomer who comes off vixenish without being too affected. She's got a great voice, but Black Cards are still waiting for a full house. The groove-based music is deftly led by Wentz's bass, much the way John Taylor's bass was at the forefront of Duran Duran early on, but in the end it was sub-Garbage, especially when the songs took on a reggae flavor, which suited neither Wentz's nor Rexha's strengths. Clutching his Miller Lite, Wentz mubled some stage patter about how \"weird it is when you do something different and people are like, 'That's lame.'\" In that sense, yeah, this was weird.\n\nWandering Sixth Street: In addition to the smorgasbord of music down here, Chicagoans, it's also in the 70s. Strolling the main music row thus makes for easy shopping, with a band neatly framed in the open windows of most clubs. Practically next door to the Colourmusic show was another band with British spelling: Chicago's own Secret Colours, which turned in a set diametrically opposite of Colourmusic's brave frenzy; Secret Colours plays a tender swirl of '60s autumnal folk and '90s shoegaze. Down the way, Ha Ha Tonka smartly showed its Ozark roots in some ripping country-rock, featuring a mandolin player with a harmony voice as high as his instrument and a rhythm section with a driving backbeat. These Missouri boys had the crowd clapping along — and this was the SXChi showcase, sponsored by Chicago's JBTV and Threadless. Around the corner at Latitude, the unofficial British embassy for the duration of SXSW, Lonndon's Wolf Gang drew a crowd. Here's a band that looks like an anachronism — Spandau Ballet's wardrobe, Adam Ant's earring — but sounds timeless, luring a dancing mob on the street with rich melodies and crisp playing. A fellow next to me was lured away from another showcase by the sound. \"American music is so muddled,\" he said. \"This is so British — so clean and clear and, I don't know, some kind of tune to take away with you.\"\n\nSXSW keynote: Bob Geldof pleads for rock's continuing social conscience — 'Say something to me!'\n\nBy Thomas Conner on March 17, 2011 2:25 PM\n\nAUSTIN, Texas — A fine new biography of Queen by Mark Blake, Is This the Real Life?, was recently published. The first chapter details the band's performance at Live Aid in 1985, as fine a piece of stadium showmanship as you'll ever see. It inspired me to drop the cash on a used set of Live Aid DVDs, the four-disc set that was finally compiled a few years ago. Watching the whole spectacle over a long weekend while the spouse was away, I finally came to terms with the fact that, sure, Dylan was there, but so were Spandau Ballet and the Style Council (themselves the picture-perfect illustration of style trumping substance in the mid-'80s). It happened when Elvis Costello came onto the stage. He had one song. He didn't pick one of his own, he didn't push the hit, he instead sang \"All You Need Is Love.\" Live Aid is peppered with such moments, when the music itself reminds us of why we're here — much moreso and certainly more effectively than the marathon concert's occasional news reels "
