        "text": "OLTL History 1979-1989\n\n1979\n\nWhen the police learned that the murder weapon was pawned by Niki Smith, suspicion against Viki grew. Karen was finally free of Marco, her life with Larry was never better, but her greatest fear was that Viki would be blamed for Marco's murder.\n\nA Grand Jury indicted Viki for the murder of Marco Dane. Karen Wolek searched for her hooker friend, Katrina, because she believed Katrina knew who killed Marco. Karen confided this to Talbot Huddleston, who was concerned that Katrina may have seen him kill Marco!\n\nD.A. Herb Callison dropped the biggest bombshell of all by calling a surprise witness -- Marco Dane's twin brother, Dr. Mario Corelli. Mario introduced damaging letters Marco had written to him about how Viki had threatened him.\n\nViki's trial reached a thrilling climax when Karen Wolek took the stand for the defense. Karen had finally found her old friend from \"the life,\" Katrina Karr. In exchange for money she needed for drugs, Katrina gave Karen the combina-tion to a Post Office box, which Katrina claimed contained information revealing the identity of Marco Dane's killer. When Karen went to the Post Office to get the information, she discovered to her horror that Talbot Huddleston had beaten her to it. Also, Katrina had been run down by a car and was now lying comatose in Llanview hospital.\n\nKaren correctly guessed that Talbot was the killer and prepared to break the news in court. As Karen took the stand, she was savagely cross-examined by D.A. Callison, who forced her to reveal her secret life as a hooker! Larry listened in stunned silence as his wife revealed that she had been turning tricks when he thought she was tending to their home. Katrina later came out of her coma and named Talbot as the killer. This was enough to exonerate Viki, but Karen's marriage to Larry appeared to be doomed.\n\nDorian led a vicious campaign to have Larry ousted as Chief of Staff of Llanview Hospital. Dorian ordained her old friend and mentor, Dr. Ivan Kipling, as Larry's replacement A move that the ambitious and cutthroat Dr. Kipling strongly favored.\n\nLarry offered to make another go of their marriage, but Karen realized she'd always be Larry's albatross, and decided to divorce him.\n\nDr. Mario Corelli settled in Llanview. In time, Karen discovered an amazing truth --- Mario was really Marco Dane! He wasn't dead after all! Karen forced Marco to tell what really happened the night he was supposedly murdered. Marco was horrified to discover the dead body of his brother Mario, and made the instant decision to exchange identities with the corpse! Marco implored Karen to keep his secret, telling her that he'd been \"born again.\" Karen agreed on one condition: he had to stop practicing medicine. Marco agreed.\n\nJenny was delighted to be pregnant with Brad's baby. Brad had developed a compulsion for gambling. With his losses mounting, Brad stole Jenny's key to the hospital's pharmacy. Brad gave the key to a mobster named Brick in exchange for forgiving Brad's gambling debts. When Brick and an accomplice tried to rob the pharmacy, they were caught by Dr. Jack Scott, who was shot and paralyzed in the violent exchange.\n\nFeeling guilty that Brad was home alone without her, Jenny asked Karen to look after him. Karen knew that Brad did not like her, but Karen would do whatever Jenny wanted. Brad and Karen clashed at first, but eventually Brad became -fascinated by his sexy sister-in-law. The fascination grew into obsession. One night, Brad tried to seduce his sister-in-law, but the seduction turned to rape. Karen knew she coudn't reveal a word about the rape because if Jenny were to find out, it would all but destroy her. Larry began his own detective work and realized that Brad raped Karen. In a rage, Larry beat Brad to a pulp! Jenny threw Brad out of their apartment. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, and was sentenced to three months in prison.\n\nJenny gave premature birth to her tiny baby about the same time Katrina gave birth. When Karen and Marco were visiting the, Jenny's baby went into cardiac arrest and died before their eyes! In a panic, Karen and Marco switched Jenny's baby with Katrina's baby. Katrina fell into a deep depression when she was told that her baby died. Jenny took baby Mary home, never suspecting that the precious little girl belonged to another woman.\n\nDorian's sister Melinda sank deeper into psychosis, and checked herself into the Compton Clinic. Jenny's sister-in-law, Samantha, came to realize that Tony had only agreed to marry her out of guilt, and called off the ceremony.\n\nWhen Pat discovered that her new husband Adam had put all moral considerations aside in order to get his financial empire back in order, she quickly had their new marriage annulled. For comfort, Pat turned to her TV producer, Dick Grant. In Pat's presence, Dick was a cheerful, charming, very outgoing gentleman. However, unbeknownst to Pat, Dick had developed a psychotic crush on her. When Samantha Vernon discovered that Dick had turned his apartment into a photo-covered shrine to Pat, he kidnapped her, and then Pat, before the police apprehended him.\n\nViki received some joyous news when she discovered she was pregnant with her second child! Meanwhile, Tina had taken up with a rather undesirable young crowd. Joe began suffering all the classic signs of a recurrence of his brain tumor. When Joe learned that he had only a few weeks left, he treated Viki to a wonderful wedding anniversary.\n\nWith time running out, Joe hand-picked his successor as editor of The Banner. He sent for the editor of a small but prestigious newspaper in Arizona. The man's name was Clint Buchanan. Joe broke the news of his prognosis to Viki, shortly before succumbing to his illness. He beseeched Viki to move on with her life after he was gone. Viki poured her energies into working with Clint at The Banner, and fending off a takeover attempt by her arch-rival, Dorian Lord.\n\nClint braced himself for the arrival of his Texas family and friends, including his father Asa's girlfriend Mimi King, his right hand man Chuck Wilson, nephew Rafe Garretson and country singer Johnny Drummond. The one face Clint was happy to see was his high-strung younger brother, Bo, who had been browbeat by his domineering father. But not Asa! Clint had been estranged from his \"Pa\" for years, and was clearly agitated at the prospect of Asa Buchanan's imminent arrival. Quickly, Clint understood that Bo had been sent on a mission by Asa to get Clint to return to the family fold.\n\nDorian became involved in Pat's talk show and Gretel became convinced that Dorian would never give the show back to Pat. Dorian, however, was forced to relinquish the show when Pat booked Asa Buchanan as a guest.\n\nClint dated both Pat and Maggie Ashley, but found himself only interested in Pat. Maggie made a play for Clint, who rebuffed her. However, Pat, unwilling to hurt her sister anymore than Clint already had, refused to have anything to do with him. As the year came to an end, Maggie hatched a plan to steal Pat's identity! By impersonating Pat, Maggie could have Clint all to herself!\n\n1980\n\nMaggie Ashley transformed herself into the spitting image of her sister Pat. After imprisoning Pat in a locked cellar, Maggie began posing as her own sister. Clint finally put the pieces together, and raced to Pat's house, where Maggie was just about to shoot her sister. He found Maggie dead and Pat standing over her with a revolver in her hand. Deeply traumatized, Pat broke up with Clint and found herself drawn to his younger brother Bo, who was in the midst of an affair with his father's mistress, Mimi. Dorian Lord was delighted by this turn of events. She set out to make Clint Buchanan fall in love with her, only to fail when he saw through her manipulative ways.\n\nRichard Abbott returned to Llanview with his new wife Becky Lee, who had signed with Buchanan Enterprises recording label. Becky Lee was pregnant, but a miscarriage landed her marriage to Richard on the rocks.\n\nAsa Buchanan finally blew into Llanview. He hired young Samantha Vernon to work for him. Sam, who was living with skater Mick Gordon, became instantly enchanted with her new lavish lifestyle. Asa was equally impressed by Samantha's youth and her body. So captivated by Asa, Sam did not see that her best friend, Tina Clayton, was seducing Mick! Sexpot Tina was also waging a campaign to attract Bo's protégé, country-western singer Johnny Drummond. When Samantha found out about Mick's affair with Tina, she threw him out. Mick lost out on Tina too, when she landed Johnny Drummond.\n\nIn Paris to visit Pat, Bo was spotted by Pat's new friend, Nicole Bonard. Bo was her son! Nicole Bonard was actually Asa's wife, Olympia Buchanan. Many years earlier, when Bo and Clint were children, Olympia had an affair with ranch hand Yancy Ralston and became pregnant. During an argument, Olympia killed Yancy. When Asa found out, he had Olympia banished to Europe, telling his children that their mother had died. Asa saw a photo of Nicole and Pat in Paris and went into a state of shock! He feared Olympia could ruin his empire and destroy his relationship with his sons and Samantha. Nicole told Pat that \"Bo is not a true Buchanan.\" But before Pat could find out what her cryptic comment meant, Nicole was gone! Asa had her flown to Llanview, where he imprisoned her. Asa hired his nephew, Rafe Garretson, to watch over her, telling the naive young man that Nicole was insane.\n\nAs Bo and Pat fell in love and got engaged, Asa did his darndest to break them up. Asa Buchanan hated strong, independent women like Pat Ashley so much that he forced his own mistress, Mimi King, to try and seduce Bo. She attempted unsuccessfully to lure him into bed. Bo and Asa's relationship grew more bitter and competitive, until Bo finally opted to leave the family fold and start his own company, Lone Star Records.\n\nThe only father that Tina had never known -- Ted Clayton -- arrived in Llanview intent on reconciling with his daughter. However, Ted was actually Tom Clarkson, a recently released inmate who was about to try and con Viki out of her fortune and Tina out of her inheritance. Ted pitted himself against Clint Buchanan, who had taken more than a professional interest in Viki. When Ted learned that Clint was about to propose marriage to Viki, he stepped up his plan by masterminding the kidnapping of Tina. His goal was not only to get his hands on the ransom, but to make himself indispensable to Viki. When Tina was safely returned home, Ted proposed marriage to Viki. Flustered, but touched by his request, Viki opted for time to consider the offer.\n\nKaren Wolek grew nervous every time Katrina Karr visited Jenny and her baby girl, Mary. Jenny found herself drawn to Dr. Peter Janssen and they made plans to marry. But Peter needed a divorce from Melinda, whom Dorian had declared mentally incompetent. This troubling situation put a strain on Jenny and Peter's relationship.\n\nWhen baby Mary became ill with a minor blood disease and needed a transfusion, Peter realized that Jenny could not be her mother. One look at the footprints and Peter saw that Mary Vernon was Katrina's baby, not Jenny's. Karen had switched babies! Tormented by his discovery, Peter promised Karen that he would not reveal the truth to Jenny.\n\nWhen the stress of leading dual lives proved too much, Marco developed selective amnesia. To her horror, Karen Wolek witnessed cool and calm Mario turn into wild-eyed Marco -- and didn't turn back! Karen hid her Jeckyll/Hide pal in a sleazy motel, then had him committed to a sanitarium.\n\nAs the gap in his relationship with Karen widened once again, Larry turned to Ivan Kipling's estranged wife, Faith, for companionship. Karen, who still loved Larry with all her heart, grew jealous of his friendship with Faith. Faith's husband, Ivan, was a brilliant brain surgeon with a host of secrets. Among them was the fact that he was the natural father of Edwina Lewis, who despised him. Kipling shuddered when he saw Karen Wolek for the first time because she had been one of his hookers and could expose his perverted obsession for them.\n\nIvan set a trap for Karen, intending to kill her! In the ensuing struggle, Karen took a terrible tumble down a flight of stairs. Just as Ivan was about to finish her off, two vagrants entered the building, forcing him to flee. Karen was rushed to the hospital in a coma. Ivan, as chief neurosurgeon,was put in charge of her case! He called for immediate surgery, where he planned to kill her -- this time for sure! The moment arrived when Ivan decided to make \"the fatal mistake\" which would end Karen's life, but Kipling's pride and devotion to his profession prevented him from kill-ing her on the operating table.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ivan injected Karen with drugs to keep her silent for as long as possible. Reconciling with his wife Faith, Kipling coerced her into becoming his accomplice. When another attempt to kill Karen failed, the Kiplings escaped to South America.\n\nDorian tried to convince Edwina that Mario was an imposter on the morning of their wedding, but failed. Dorian did manage to get an indictment against Mario, and he was arrested just before the marriage took place. Edwina, in a state of shock, broke all ties with Marco, who went to jail. Larry knew enough to assume that Karen had to have aided and abetted Marco. Larry, caught between his love for Karen and his desire to accept this, asked Karen for time. The following day, a guilt-ridden Karen packed her bags and moved into Ina Hopkin's boarding house. Eventually, Marco and Edwina reconciled and married.\n\nAfter her breakup with Clint, Dorian sank her claws into Llanview's ambitious District Attorney, Herb Callison, who was dating Gretel Rae Cummings. Dorian lured Herb into a secret trip, ostensibly to pick up a campaign contribution. Herb knew that this meant he would have to resume his affair with Dorian, and that if Gretel found out she would break off their long-term romance. Herb flew to Paris and he and Dorian fought over Gretel. Herb flew home only to learn that Gretel had discovered the truth. Gretel, brokenhearted, ended their affair and left Llanview.\n\nWith Dorian's guidance and financial support, Herb won a close election for Governor in the fall. Dorian had obtained a huge illegal campaign contribution from Asa Buchanan in exchange for his winning a state highway contract from the new Governor. Unbeknownst to Dorian, Herb made a secret deal to award the same highway deal to a local mobster. News of these dishonest maneuvers began to leak to the press. At year's end, Dorian made final plans to become the First Lady of Pennsylvania -- just as whispers of \"scandal\" were heard in the inner circles of Llanview.\n\n1981\n\nOn the day of Herb and Dorian's wedding, newly-elected Lt. Governor Ed Hall, convinced of Herb and Dorian's guilt, faced his conscience and resigned from office. With the evidence mounting against him, Herb had no choice but to step down. Herb's career collapsed, and he was forced to take a lowly position as public defender.\n\nMelinda Cramer was on her way back to the Compton Clinic after having threatened Jenny Vernon with a letter opener. Her insane act meant further postponement of Jenny and Peter's wedding. Peter realized that he could never get a divorce from Melinda until she was mentally fit. Melinda overheard a secret conversation between Peter, Marco and Karen about their notorious baby switch and this sent her further into madness.\n\nPat hired Ed Hall, now a private detective, to help her find her missing friend Nicole. Asa finally convinced Samantha to marry him. Asa's nephew, Rafe, developed a genuine fascination for Sam. On Asa's wedding day, Nicole escaped, bought a gun, and hid in the church as the guests arrived. With gun in hand, Olympia prepared to stop the wedding. However, at the last second, Rafe appeared and silently subdued the raving woman, taking her back to her \"prison.\"\n\nAll hell broke loose at the reception when Becky Lee's drunk and hostile ex-husband, Luther Jackson, crashed the festivities. In the ensuing melee, Peter was shot. Fearing he would die, Peter confessed his part as conspirator in the baby switch to a priest. Suspicious of Peter's actions, Brad had secretly placed a tape recorder in Peter's hospital room and learned the startling truth. Armed with the news, Brad threatened to tell Jenny, but found that he could not hurt the woman he still loved with this dreadful secret. Even on Jenny and Peter's wedding day, Brad could not bring himself to stop the ceremony. Kat later confided to Brad her suspicion that he was the father of her dead baby.\n\nBecky Lee and Richard's marriage fell apart when Becky Lee realized that she loved her country-western singing partner, Johnny Drummond. Richard left town and Johnny left his new flame Tina in the dust, to hurry into a romance with Becky Lee.\n\nThe Ted/Viki/Clint triangle lost a side when Clint decided not to pursue a relationship with Viki. Clint sensed, correctly, that Ted Clayton was duping Viki. Despite his words of warning, Viki was happy with Ted, and blissfully unaware that he was actually the head of a counterfeit ring centered in Llanview. Detective Vince Wolek stumbled onto the counterfeit ring, but was poisoned to death before he could blow the whistle. Wanda Webb Wolek was devastated by the death of her dear husband.\n\nMore than almost anyone, Karen felt the pain of Vince's death. Karen befriended Steve Piermont, a member of the counterfeiting ring who she knew could lead her to his boss, and pretended to return to hooking! Away on a business trip together, Clint and Viki shared candlelit dinners and long walks together, and realized they were in love. When Viki returned to Llanview, she resolved to break off her relationship with Ted. Ted drugged Viki with mind-altering chemicals and under his drug-induced spell, Viki was brainwashed into fearing Clint, and marrying Ted!\n\nKaren convinced everyone -- including counterfeiter Steve -- that she had returned to her wild ways. Karen talked Piermont into giving her a job as a runner for the ring. By threatening harm to Edwina, Steve blackmailed Marco into joining the ring. Edwina began wondering about Marco's mysterious \"appointments\" and before long, a sad Edwina asked Marco to move out.\n\nTed, fearing exposure, ordered Steve to put a contract out on Karen and Marco. Steve was faced with a dilemma. Having grown fond of Karen, Steve pleaded with her to run away - or face certain death. Karen refused and went ahead with a counterfeit money drop. In a shootout, Marco was shot in the arm. Ed arrested Steve and asked him to turn state's evidence against Ted Clayton.\n\nAs he was being carted off to jail, Ted resolved to bring Marco Dane and Karen Wolek down with him. When Karen and Marco realized they were being framed, they went on the run. They knew that Steve Piermont was the only one who could clear their names. To track him down, they joined a carnival run by Steve's family -- meanwhile, Ted had escaped from jail!\n\nAfter Clint proved his love by rescuing Viki from the real Ted Clayton, he seemed to be close to his desire. But again Viki was not ready. Finally in frustration, Clint quit his job and went to work for the rival paper, The Chronicle. He also took up with Edwina Lewis. Edwina knew that Clint loved Viki, but believed that it was hopeless, and that she could help him get over his infatuation. Upset over Clint's departure and affair with Edwina, Viki discovered that her feelings for Clint were deeper than she had realized. Finally, Viki dropped her guard and allowed herself to follow her heart and fall in love with Clint. Eventually, Edwina came to terms with the fact that Clint could never love anyone the way he loved Viki. Edwina soon reunited with Marco.\n\nA young girl named Cassie Howard arrived in Llanview and took an unusual interest in Dorian Lord. Dorian was stunned when Cassie finally revealed her secret -- she was her daughter! Stunned, Dorian refused to believe this amazing pronouncement. Cassie was upset by her mother's rejection. Dorian admitted to Herb that, years earlier, she had given birth to a daughter while she was in medical school. One day, Dorian came home to discover that her boyfriend, David Renaldi, had taken off with their baby, Cassie. A concert pianist, David went to live with his mother in California, then left Cassie behind and went off to Europe. In time, Dorian and Cassie agreed to face this new relationship one step at a time.\n\nTony Lord came back to Llanview, where he met and became instant friends with Bo Buchanan. Pat and Clint correctly surmised that Asa was keeping Nicole prisoner somewhere in Llanview. But Nicole escaped, and plotted to get even with the husband who had ruined her life. At the Buchanan Ball, Nicole wasn't the only uninvited guest hiding behind a mask. The evil Dr.Ivan Kipling, who had fled to South America the previous year, had returned to Llanview to wreak havoc once again.\n\n1982\n\nAngry with Asa, Bo renounced the Buchanan name, declaring that his new name was Bo \"Ralston.\" Pat became jealous when Bo began dating Georgina Whitman, a bright and beautiful scientist, who had come to town with Pat's old flame, Tony Lord. Tony and Georgina were on a top-secret project involving solarmite, a rare metal-mineral which they hoped could be mined, processed and then used as a cheap alternative to oil fuel. Discovering huge stores of solarmite under the Llanfair and Moor Cliffe mansions, Bo teamed up with Georgina and Tony, and engaged in a bitter battle with Asa and his new partner, Dorian Lord, who had recently separated from her husband, Herb Callison.\n\nDespite saving each other's lives in a pair of near tragedies from the Solarmite project, Bo and Asa failed to reconcile. The two stubborn men remained estranged. Bo's romance with Georgina fizzled, too, and she left Llanview.\n\nPat came to accept Tony's adventurous lifestyle and married the man she loved in a beautiful wedding ceremony.\n\nBo's quest to discover his \"Ralston\" roots took him to Louisiana where he met his Aunt Euphemia and her nephew Drew, who returned to Llanview with Bo to bring down the Buchanan empire and restore the Ralston fortune. Once in Llanview, Drew developed a fascination for Asa's ex-wife, Samantha. Delila Ralston soon joined Drew in Llanview. Delila had been estranged from her family for years. Before long, Delila found herself a Buchanan of her own -- Asa!\n\nTed Clayton's escape from jail came as no surprise to Tina. By now, she knew that this man who claimed to be her father was as slippery as they come! However, Tina was in the for the surprise of her life when she encountered a smartly dressed woman in an art gallery. Suddenly, the woman whipped off her wig. It was Ted in disguise! Before he could harm Tina, Captain Ed Hall shot and killed him. Tina, traumatized by the stirring events, left town to start a new life. Marco and Karen finally cleared their names in the counterfeiting scheme. Viki accepted Clint's decision to take a new job as executive editor at The Banner's chief competitor, The Chronicle. The battle lines were drawn! Llanview's press war took on new fury when Clint lured prize-winning reporter Edwina Lewis away from The Banner. Working side by side, Clint and Edwina began a torrid affair.\n\nDivorced from Karen, Larry eagerly anticipated marrying Mimi King. Just before the wedding, Larry met up with the renowned Dr. Hugo Wilde, who was actually his mortal enemy, Dr. Ivan Kipling! Kipling coldly informed Larry that he was about to atone for his sins. Placed on an operating table, Larry screamed in horror as he realized that Ivan was about to perform surgery on him. Larry awoke with no memory of what had taken place and was unaware that Ivan now controlled his every move through a device implanted in his brain. Returning to Llanview, Larry never showed up for his own wedding. Instead of marrying Mimi, Larry had gone straight to Karen, telling her that he still loved her dearly. Kipling's ulltimate aim was to capture Karen. When Captain Ed Hall grew suspicious of Kipling's strange activitities, Kipling implanted a device in his brain too. Kipling finally blackmailed Karen into coming to South America with him, to spare the lives of Larry and Ed, who were saved in the nick of time by emergency surgery.\n\nKaren had no choice but to \"marry\" Kipling in a bizarre wedding ceremony at his lavish jungle plantation. Just before Kipling tried to consummate their \"marriage,\" Karen escaped into the jungle! Larry tracked Karen to South America and in a fight to the finish on a river bank, Larry prevailed, sending Kipling to the crocodiles and rescued Karen.\n\nMarco became a movie director, with a little help from Asa's money. Life imitated art on the set of Marco Dane's murder movie, \"Blood Moon\" when the lead actor, Rudy Lavasso, was murdered! Marco and Ed set a trap to catch the killer. When Marco's ex-wife, Edwina, saw a gunman about to shoot him, she threw herself in front of Marco and took a near-fatal bullet. The killer turned out to be Kyle Dickinson, the son of the culprit in the actual Hatchfield murder case. Kyle held Cassie hostage, then Dorian, before being apprehended and locked away.\n\nKaren could no longer hide the truth from her dear friend Katrina. With her back against the wall, Karen confessed to the baby-switching. Peter agonized over the moment that was finally at hand. He raced home from the hospital to face Jenny before she learned the terrible truth from Katrina. -But Peter never made it! Just as Katrina was about to reveal the baby switch to Jenny, the Llanview police arrived with grim news: Peter had been killed in a car accident. In view of Jenny's horrible loss, Katrina said nothing further about the baby switch. Peter's death had momentarily stopped Katrina from revealing the truth to Jenny. Brad convinced Katrina to stay silent by proposing marriage to her. He promised that, if she married him, then Katrina would be little Mary's stepmother, and would see her often. Katrina accepted Brad's proposal, and the secret was finally safe once again. Or was it?\n\nJenny's lingering suspicions drove her to steal the key to Brad's safety deposit box and there she found the audiotape that Brad had secretly made of Peter confessing the switch to a priest. The shocking knowledge of the baby switch turned Jenny into a woman who would take desperate measures to keep her child. With renewed inner strength, she returned Brad's tape and kept the discovery to herself.\n\nJenny's hopes shattered when she encountered Katrina in the cemetery while paying a sorrowful visit to her real baby. Seeing Jenny in tears, Katrina realized that she finally knew the truth. Katrina was faced with a dilemma. Should she fight for her baby in the courts, or marry Brad and be Mary's stepmother? Ever the cad, Brad answered the question for Katrina when she caught him proposing to Jenny!\n\nSadly, Jenny realized she must give her daughter to Katrina to prevent the pain Mary would suffer in a courtroom custody battle -- and to keep Marco and Karen from going to prison. In a tearful, poignant moment, Jenny handed over the girl she loved with all her heart to Katrina. The implications of the baby switch reverberated throughout Llanview. The District Attorney's office began harassing Jenny. Viki, who now knew the truth, countered with an angry editorial in which she knew for a fact that Jenny was innocent. She would only say that this information came from a privileged source of information. Before a Grand Jury, Viki refused to name her source and was sent to jail! Clint and Viki grew closer as he worked on her release. When Viki's prison vigil came to an end, she and Clint became man and wife.\n\nKaren and Larry decided to hold off on their own wedding plans until the baby switch crisis cooled. Their stormy reunion was threatened by the return of Steve Piermont, who had recently been released from jail. While Larry was away at a medical conference, Steve visited Karen, and they kissed passionately. Karen tried to resist, but she finally succumbed to Steve's dynamic presence. When Karen discovered that the mob had put a contract out on Steve, she tried to help him -- and became a target, too. Steve was shot and seriously injured, but Steve and Karen fled town together.\n\nLarry tracked down Steve and Karen, and she was forced to make the painful choice between the two men who loved her. She chose Steve, because his need for her was greater. While a dejected Larry journeyed back to Llanview, Steve and Karen headed for Canada to start a fugitive life.\n\n1983\n\nLarry was devastated when Karen ran off, and on the rebound, Larry and Jenny came close to an affair, but Jenny's feelings for Brad resurfaced. Brad planned to open a new hotel, the Vernon Inn, but when contractors used substandard materials the whole idea almost went up in smoke. When he learned that Kat wanted to go to Florida, he ruined her chances. Jenny learned the truth and broke off their second engagement.\n\nAsa worked hard to win back Bo's love, but Bo still wanted nothing to do with him. Asa had stumbled upon an incredible secret: Bo really was his son after all! The shocking revelation came in the form of a letter from Delila's Aunt Twyla had written to Bo. The letter provided indisputable proof that Yancey Ralston was sterile, therefore, there was no way he could have sired Bo. The news thrilled Asa, but he realized that Bo and Delila believed they were kin had been fighting their mutual attraction. To keep Delila under his thumb and in his bed, Asa kept his mouth shut, and eloped with Delila.\n\nAsa and Brad were taking his new sailing vessel for a trial run in Florida. As they ventured out on the high seas, disaster struck! A gasoline leak caused the craft to explode, and Asa and Brad were thrown into the raging waters. Brad was certain that Asa was lost forever. In his will, Asa divided the bulk of his fortune between Bo and his new wife Delila. In the will, Bo was perplexed by Asa's reference to \"my dear son.\" Brad provided the stunning to answer to Bo's queston when he revealed the secret. Bo, shocked to learn he was a Buchanan after all, was deeply enraged that Asa kept the truth from him.\n\nOf course, Asa wasn't dead at all! Certain there was a conspiracy to assassinate him and that Bo and Delila were having a love affair, Asa instructed Brad to sneak him back to Llanview. While Asa and Brad implemented their plan, Bo and Delila made love, promising themselves they would marry after a respectable period of time.\n\nAt the memorial service honoring Asa, who should show up but the \"dead man\" himself! Seeking to reclaim what was his, Asa set out to keep Delila away from Bo. Confused and incapable of coping with all that had happened, Delila was faced with a dilemma: which Buchanan would she choose?\n\nAfter Delila heard the truth that Asa knew all along that he was Bo's father, but had lied so that he would win her for himself, she left the old man! Stricken, angry, and stubborn, Asa vowed revenge on all those who had betrayed him. Bo rejoiced in the discovery that he was finally free to be with Delila, but Bo had recently made love to Becky -- and now she was pregnant! Becky chose not to tell Bo because she knew he was in love with Delila. A chance encounter- at the gynecologist's office led Delila to discover Becky's delicate condition. Alarmed that Becky would tell Bo she was carrying his baby, Delila pressed for a fast divorce from Asa and a hasty marriage to Bo.\n\nAsa forced Becky to admit that she was pregnant with Bo's baby. Becky threatened Asa, informing him that if he revealed her pregnancy to Bo, he would never lay eyes on his grand-child. Asa offered to support Becky and her baby if she would let him raise the child, but she refused because she had accepted a proposal of marriage from Drew Ralston. But on their wedding day, Drew was shot and killed in a botched robbery at the florist shop where he was buying Becky's bouquet. Becky named her baby Drew. After Asa promised he would not expect Becky to sleep with him, she agreed to become his wife.

Pat left town to accept an exciting new job at a Chicago TV station.\n\nMarco Dane was busy with two new jobs -- running a legitimate health club by day, and a fly-by-night modeling agency called Dreamfaces, by night. For awhile, he led a double \"personal\" life too -- juggling romances with both Samantha and Edwina. Marco struggled valiantly to prevent the two women from discovering his deception.\n\nThe Countess Echo DiSavoy, a world-renowned photographer, arrived in a Llanview to implement a mysterious plot against the very-married Clint Buchanan. Clint became so drawn to Echo that one day he kissed her. Days later, they made love. In the afterglow, Clint's memory flashed to Gizelle, a woman he knew years earlier. Clint struggled to remember more. Who was she? He knew that Gizelle looked exactly like Echo, but that's all he could recall. Echo knew all too well that Gizelle was her dead mother!\n\nFirmly believing that Clint was responsible for Gizelle's fall from a bridge to her death, Echo wanted revenge. She planned to fake her own death -- and frame Clint for the crime. Echo carefully followed her plans, except she never expected to fall in love with Clint! Still, she lured Clint to an old Llanview bridge, engaged him in a bitter brawl, then jumped to her \"death.\" Dorian, who witnessed the encounter, declared in court that Clint pushed Echo!\n\nViki and Marco tracked down the very-much-alive Echo, who confessed her deception. When Clint was set free, Echo moved out of Llanview, leaving Viki and Clint to reconstruct their damaged marriage.\n\nDavid Renaldi charmed Viki in order to get the job as conductor of the prestigious Llanview Philharmonic. David, however, went out of his way to avoid meeting Dorian. After his job was secure and his contract signed, David consented to see her. The rage Dorian displayed when she was finally face to face with him confused everyone. Only David knew the reason for this apparent hatred -- he was the man who had walked out on her years earlier, taking their baby daughter Cassie with him! David made an uneasy peace with Dorian, then struck up an easy friendship with Jenny Janssen. Soon, Cassie returned from school in Europe and, to Dorian's dismay, she was charmed by her newfound father -- and vice-versa. This, of course, only served to enrage Dorian further.\n\nDanger followed David Renaldi to Llanview when it was revealed that this talented concert pianist had once been a spy! When David's old organization recruited him again, he refused adamantly. But before long, David Renaldi found himself lured back into a life of illegal espionage. He was risking his life, and that of his loved ones, by playing secret agent again. Dorian was recruited by the government to aid in their plan to trap and stop David. However, it turned out that the government agents who enlisted Dorian were frauds! Furious at Dorian for her lies, Herb -- who had only recently reconciled with his wife -- walked out again, this time taking Cassie with him!

Once again, Dorian was alone!\n\n1984\n\nDavid and Jenny's wedding was interrupted by Brad and Dorian, who brought David's former wife, Liat, to Llanview.

Tracy took an immediate interest in Larry and vowed to win him over, enlisting the help of a dangerous cohort named Stick.\n\nWhen Dorian fell down the staircase after a struggle with Laurel Chapin, David was the first to discover and rescue her. But when Dorian regained consciousness, and discovered that Jenny might be willing to give David another chance, she claimed that David was the one who pushed her down the stairs. Only if Jenny refused to marry David, would Dorian keep this information from the police. Jenny had no choice.To save David, she had to break up with him, and left town for a religious retreat. Convinced that she could trust no one, Jenny decided to renew her vows as a nun!\n\nLaurel was hit by a car and healed by her new love, Larry Wolek. Laurel confessed the truth that Dorian fell down the stairs and David did not push her! With no obstacles in their path, Jenny was finally free to marry her man, and the two tied the knot.\n\nThe O'Neill family -- patriarch Harry and his three daughters, Didi, Connie, and Joy -- were proud working-class people whose livelihood depended on their work at the Lord-Manning plant, which owners Viki and Clint were considering closing because of severe financial problems. The plant workers, led by feisty Connie O'Neill, hated the Lords and Buchanans. In need of a new life, Bo introduced himself to the O'Neills as Bill Brady, an unemployed laborer. Just another working stiff! In rapid time, \"Bill\" moved into the O'Neill home and found irresistible comfort in this unknown working-class world. Bo rolled up his sleeves and took a job at the plant, and fell in love with eldest daughter, Didi. Didi, however, was engaged to marry the plant's legal counselor, Mark Pemberton, who was secretly draining Lord-Manning funds and committing heinous acts of sabotage at the plant.\n\nBo clandestinely investigated several acts of apparent sabotage that took place. Mark ran scared. Feeling the noose tightening around his neck, he pressured Didi to elope with him. Didi found out that \"Bill\" was a phony and the fact that her \"friend\" Bill Brady was really a Buchanan, propelled her to run away with Mark. In the nick of time, Bo discovered Pemberton's crimes. Mark escaped and took Viki hostage. Posing as Clint, Mark took Viki to the airport. The real Clint arrived in time to struggle with Mark and prevent him from detonating the bomb he had with him. Didi, safe and secure, planted a big kiss on Bo's lips! Bo and Didi were in love!\n\nHarry, hurt by Bo's masquerade, ordered him to move out of the O'Neill house. Thinking that Bo still loved Delila, Didi began to believe that she and Bo were not meant for each other after all. Desperate to prove his feeling for Didi, Bo took two important steps. First, he told Delila that their divorce plans were still on. Second, he abducted Didi against her will and whisked her away to New York. When Bo and Didi got engaged, Asa teamed up with Delila to try to break them up.\n\nAfter failing in scheme after scheme designed to destroy Bo and Didi's relationship, Asa finally packed up Becky and baby Drew and flew to Arizona. Their private plane ran into foul weather and the Buchanans were forced to parachute to the ground before the pilot made a crash landing. Asa and Drew survived the night in an abandoned building. Asa searched high and low for his wife -- but she was gone!\n\nSuffering from amnesia, Becky was working as a waitress in a New Mexico tavern.

Rafe and Samantha were married at the Crown Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, but the ceremony was interrupted when mobster Herve Boudin suddenly raced through the reception room. He had just murdered Leo Coronal, kingpin of an important Philadelphia crime family. Leo's grandson, Rob Coronal, witnessed the shooting, fled the scene, and escaped to Llanview where he took refuge in the deserted Atheneum Theater. There he met and fell hopelessly in love with Cassie Callison! She was equally enchanted with Rob, the son of mobster Alessandro Coronal, who had changed his name to Alex Crown and gone straight, buying a string of legitimate hotels.\n\nAlex had raised Rob alone after his wife, Laurel Chapin, had died in childbirth. Now, years later, Alex discovered that she was alive! Laurel was equally amazed to learn that her son, who was stolen from her at childbirth by Leo Coronal, was hiding out somewhere in Llanview. Together, Alex and Laurel tracked down Rob, who had disappeared after the shooting in Atlantic City. They shared a touching, but tentative reunion.\n\nSamantha Vernon had also caught a glimpse of the killer, Herve Boudin and he shot her at the Vernon Inn health club. Brad and Rafe responded quickly and discovered Sam floating face down in the hot tub. At the hospital, Dr. Larry Wolek pronounced Sam brain dead -- and told Rafe some amazing news. Sam was pregnant when she drowned. To the surprise of many, Delila offered to bear Sam's unborn baby. Rafe agreed and doctors swiftly per-formed an embryo transplant from Sam's womb to Delila's. When the procedure was completed, Dr. Will Vernon sadly turned off the machines that were keeping his daughter alive.\n\nAt year's end, blue-blooded Dorian Lord began an unlikely romance with blue-collared Harry O'Neill, who quickly had trouble dealing with his flamboyant paramour.

While in Venice, Bo met a sexy government agent named Jinx Rollins who was working on the case, too. When Didi found out that Bo was with Jinx, she was jealous and angry, not believing Bo's claim that their friendship was innocent. Certain that Bo was having an affair with Jinx, Didi ended their relationship. Bo rescued Asa, who was shocked to discover Becky was back in Llanview!\n\nAs she cuddled Drew, Becky Lee's memory came flooding back. Now, which man would she choose -- Asa or Jesse?

His plan worked, but when Descamedes, the mob ringleader, was released on bail, Alex took action, shooting and killing his enemy before going underground.\n\nDorian Lord was the only person to discover that Alex Crown was alive.

Rob gave in, but he and Cassie soon continued their romance in secret. When Alex joined the Witness Protection Program, Cassie and Rob were safe and free to marry!\n\nDorian's constant interference in Cassie's life finally destroyed her marriage to Herb. The Callisons divorced in 1985 -- but not before making love in the courthouse elevator! Dorian's fortune was frozen by the IRS after Tina discovered that Victor Lord had once married Irene Clayton.

Kipling, who was last seen being devoured by crocodiles after kidnapping Karen Wolek, now had bionic metal fingers!

Along with his old Communist comrade, Aida York, David completed a secret code to transport American military secrets behind the Iron Curtain. David planned to defect to East Germany with his wife, Jenny, and their teenage ward, Michelle Boudin. At the last second, David changed his mind, telling Aida that he wanted to remain in Llanview with his family. Jenny watched in horror as the communist agents shot David and carried him away on a plane!\n\nJenny did not know if her beloved David was dead or alive. Just as Jenny was getting her life back in order, David escaped from his comrades and reappeared in Llanview. David explained to Jenny that Aida had forced him to work against the U.S. government by threatening Jenny and Cassie's lives. David came up with a plan to fake his death, then leave Llanview with Jenny. However, Brad Vernon discovered the \"death\" plan and asked Jenny to marry him. This time, Brad wasn't being his usual selfish, mean-spirited self. He was doing it for Jenny, so that she could finally find happiness with David somewhere far from Llanview!\n\nAfter Brad married Jenny, he gave his identity and a forged passport to David. As \"Brad and Jenny Vernon,\" David and Jenny fled Llanview forever! After Jenny and David safely escaped, Brad, sitting in a waterfront bar, discovered something in his pocket. It was a note wrapped around a precious opal! The valuable \"thank you\" gift was given to him by David to help him get a new start, too!\n\nTina's search for her real father continued with her discovery of a secret room hidden behind the bookcase in the library of Llanfair. Complete with soft lights and music, she realized that it was Victor Lord's love den. She also discovered eleven original paintings which disappeared from foreign museums during World War II. Tina's adventures in the secret room yielded a startling discovery -- a letter from Victor which was intended to be delivered to Viki. In it, Victor confessed to being the father of Irene Manning's child. Tina shuddered at the realization that she was Victor Lord's daughter!\n\nTina knew Viki would not be pleased to hear that the father whom she idolized once seduced her nineteen-year-old friend! When Tina produced the letter, Viki reacted with anger, insisting that it was a for-gery. Viki began having problems dealing with this new discovery and began having violent headaches. The overwhelming tension of her own foggy memory of seeing Irene in bed with her father caused Viki's -personality to split again. Niki Smith was back!\n\nNiki began frequenting one of her old hangouts, the Backstreet Bar. There she became reacquainted with an old boyfriend -- Harry O'Neill! Harry was stunned to see \"Nicole\" again. He remembered how she had run away when he refused to leave his wife and kids for her. Harry found himself very much in love with Nicole, though his feelings were complicated by his new, sexual relationship with Dorian Lord.\n\nAt The Banner's 50th Anniversary Gala, Viki praised her father publicly and the guests were invited to enjoy a souvenir program commemorating the event. To Viki's horror, a inserted xerox copy of Victor's confessional letter had been placed in every program! With the news now public, a mortified Viki accused Tina and slapped her in the face, before racing away in shame.\n\nMitch Laurence, an unscrupulous scoundrel from Tina's past, came to Llanview intent on marrying Tina for her newly found fortune. While Viki was away, Mitch seduced Tina and continually exerted a sexual hold over her. Trapped in the secret room, Mitch discovered another document. This letter from Victor Lord stated that if Viki should ever suffer a recurrence of her multiple-personality disorder, then his entire estate and control of the Lord Foundation would go to Tina! With Tina's reluctant assistance, Mitch began an evil drive to force Niki Smith out into the open again.\n\nMitch devised a secret plan to kill Clint and frame Niki/Viki for the murder! The scheme went smoothly up until the very last moment when Tina caused Mitch's well-laid plan to backfire. Tina confronted Mitch, grabbed for the gun and a struggle ensued. Dazed from drink, Niki watched in horror as Harry O'Neill stumbled upon the scene. Mitch, mistaking Harry for Clint, fired the gun at him. Harry fell to the floor and died in Niki's arms. When she came out of her dual personality, Viki remembered nothing of this tragic killing. She stood by in stunned silence as Tina was arrested for the murder of Harry O'Neill. Tina's insistence that Mitch was the murderer fell on deaf ears because the unscrupulous Mr. Laurence had an airtight alibi. He claimed to be in Miami at the time of Harry's death.\n\nDuring the murder trial, Tina begged Viki to testify as a witness on her behalf. Viki took the stand where she was peppered with tough questions by Tina's lawyer -- Harry's brother, Pete O'Neill. When the pressure proved too much, Viki turned into Niki in front of a courtroom of stunned spectators. Niki related the truth of the crime, and an APB was put out for the arrest of Mitch Laurence. Mitch escaped, but he was eventually arrested and sent to prison.\n\nNiki had saved the day, but Clint was terrified when Viki failed to re-emerge! He was determined to get his wife back. Sending Kevin and Joey to live with their Grandpa Asa, Clint committed Viki to a sanitarium for a while. When she returned to Llanfair, Niki managed to fool everyone into thinking Viki had returned. She perfected Viki's signature, read her diaries to learn the intimate details of her life, but Niki was faced with one problem -- how could she keep Clint out of her bed?\n\nMeanwhile, Tina had been carrying on her own campaign to get Clint into bed! Her machinations reached a peak the night when a drunken Clint passed out in bed. Seizing the moment, Tina climbed in next to him. Neither of them saw Niki when she opened the door and shocked by the sight, Viki emerged. She tried to call Dr. Polk, but was chloroformed by Stick, a former cellmate of Mitch's, who had come to Llanview on behalf of his friend.\n\nStick was taken by surprise when Viki turned back into Niki and joined in her own kidnapping. She couldn't wait to split the million-dollar reward with him. Niki saw this as her one chance to be free of Clint, free of Tina, and free to finally just be herself. Stick and Niki's plot was soon discovered by a streetwise fugitive from justice named Bobby Blue. Realizing that Mrs. Buchanan was in on her own kidnaping, Bobby demanded a piece of the action.\n\nStick had other ideas. He planned to kill Niki and keep her share of the money. But before he could cut Niki's throat, Clint, Bo and Rafe arrived on the scene and shot Stick. In the aftermath, Tina learned from Bobby that Niki was in cahoots with her kidnapper. Armed with the news, Tina approached Niki and issued an ultimatum: either she divorce Clint now, or Tina would tell all!\n\nNiki was able to get a quick divorce just as Clint figured out that she had been pretending to be Viki. Clint shamed her into confessing, and agreed to keep the secret that the person everyone believed was Viki Buchanan was, in truth, Niki Smith.\n\nTina saw this divorce situation as the perfect time to try to snare Clint, and attempted to get him to marry her by claiming to be pregnant with his baby!\n\n1986\n\nTina threatened to abort her child if Clint didn't marry her! Dorian discovered that Tina was faking the pregnancy and she promptly informed Clint.\n\nBo and Didi's wedding appeared to end in tragedy when Bo was shot walking up the aisle! It was part of an elaborate scheme, engineered by Clint, to traumatize Niki into turning back to Viki. The plan worked and for a few precious seconds, Viki's personality emerged. However, Niki quickly returned, and blasted Clint for this elaborate charade. Niki refused to have anything to do with Clint, wrote him a goodbye letter, then took off! Several weeks after the wedding, Bo and Didi, her sight now returned, left Llanview on an extended honeymoon.\n\nWhen Clint found Viki, he concocted a plan. Clint lured Tina to the inn under the pretense that he had given up on Viki and now wanted only her. He then arranged for Niki to show up at his room just as he was pretending to make passionate love to Tina. Clint's hope was that the sight of him and Tina might shock Viki into emerging, just as the horror of seeing her father and Tina's mother, Irene together those many years ago had caused Niki to emerge. When Niki walked into the room, Clint pushed Tina onto the bed, tearing her blouse just as Victor had done to Irene. Witnessing this horrible sight, Niki stood frozen and transfixed. Everything went as Clint had hoped it would, and a healthy Viki emerged! Clint hugged Viki tightly. The woman he loved was finally back and they shared a tearful reunion.\n\nClint went on trial and was convicted of the murder of Dr. Marcus Polk, Viki's shrink. The murder was actually committed by one of Polk's patients, a psychotic young woman named Tracy James. After Tracy developed a crush on Dr. Larry Wolek, the former psychiatric nurse-turned-patient killed his new wife Laurel by snapping the brakes on her car. Once again, Larry Wolek was a bereaved widower. When Tracy escaped the mental hospital, she held Larry in a secret room in his own basement, which was constructed to resemble his office at the hospital! Tracy proved to be her own worst enemy however. Larry escaped and Tracy, who was planning to blow up half of Llanview with a bomb, until she was distracted by her favorite song, Frank Sinatra's \"I'll Be Seeing You.\" The bomb detonated and Tracy and her cohort Stick were killed.\n\nOn the morning of their wedding, Viki delighted Clint with the incredible news that she was pregnant!\n\nIn Vienna, a dangerous escapade unfolded for David and Jenny Renaldi, who only a year earlier had left Llanview for a safe, new life in Europe. While living on the lam, they were captured by their enemies. Jenny temporarily escaped from her captors and managed to send a coded message home to Viki, Clint, Cassie, and Brad, who traveled to Austria to rescue their friends.\n\nInstant chemistry sparked between Tina and The Banner's new photographer, Cord. Tina was charmed by the tall, handsome straight arrow. Cord confessed his love to her and Tina admitted that she wanted him as much as he wanted her. However, she told him that he was the wrong man for her. Tina wanted money and lots of it! That was something that Cord could not provide for her. But unbeknownst to Tina, Cord was actually Clint's son -- the product of his affair twenty years earlier with Cord's mother, Maria, when they were teens. Some twenty years later, Clint still knew nothing of his son, or of his father's involvement in Maria's disappearance.\n\nTina discovered that Asa had been living another life for years! Posing as a sea captain named Jeb, he had married a woman named Pamela on the faraway island of Malakeva. Armed with this news, Tina decided to set Asa up. Tina convinced Pamela to pretend to be on her deathbed to get Asa to marry her for real! Giving in to Pamela's \"dying wish,\" Asa married her. Seconds after the ceremony, Pamela leapt out of her bed, and confronted Asa. In time, Asa decided he wanted Pamela back in his life. However, it was too late! Pamela planned to sue Asa for divorce and demand half of everything he had!\n\nCord was devastated when his father, Al Roberts, died suddenly of a heart attack. On his deathbed, Al wrote a letter to Cord, revealing that Clint was his actual father. Before Cord could see the letter, Asa stole it. Unbeknownst to anyone, just days before his fatal heart attack, Al had confessed the twenty-year-old secret that Cord was Clint's son to, of all people, Mitch Laurence.\n\nReleased from prison, Mitch Laurence returned to Llanview. Mitch adopted a wholesome new image, posing as a modern day evangelist. In truth, he was a ruthless drug dealer and cult leader, who recruited and drugged young women like wholesome Joy O'Neill, sensitive Allison Perkins and teenager Mari Lynn Dennison to do his dirty work. Mitch told Tina that Cord was Clint Buchanan's son! Tina, who was set to elope with Richard Abbott, kept him at bay as she contemplated her next move. Quickly, she made a decision. Tina dumped Richard -- and eloped with Cord!\n\nUsing the information to her own advantage, Tina confronted Asa and blackmailed him into changing his will so that Cord would immediately receive one million dollars under the guise that the funds were left to him in Al Robert's will. Tina had what she wanted all along -- she was rich!\n\nReporter Cassie Callison, whose marriage to Rob Coronal ended in divorce, began investigating Mitch Laurence's operations. Learning of Cassie's tantalizing million-dollar trust fund, Mitch attempted to woo her. Cassie, eager to get to the bottom of Mitch's dirty empire, pretended to fall under his spell. Eventually, Mitch discovered Cassie's charade. In a violent struggle, Cassie was knocked unconscious. As Mitch prepared to rape her, someone killed him! When Cassie came to, she worried if she had been the one who killed him. Mitch's chief disciple fingered Cassie as the killer. Cassie went to trial, but the charges were dropped when Dorian confessed to killing Mitch. Dorian was convicted of murder and remanded to Statesville Prison. Lucky for Dorian, a hidden tape recorder had captured Mitch's death on tape. When the tell-tale tape (lifted and hidden by one of Mitch's robot-like disciples) eventually surfaced, Dorian was exonerated.\n\nViki passed out when she got her first look at newcomer Tom Dennison. Tom came to town at the behest of Cord's mother, the devious Maria Roberts. Maria noted Tom's resemblance to Viki's late husband, Joe Riley and Maria hoped that Joe's double could drive a wedge in Clint and Viki's marriage so she could have Clint for herself! After she found out that Tom could be Joe's long-lost brother, Viki took him to her cabin in the mountains. While looking through Joe's old papers, they found Joe's birth certificate which confirmed that he was born a twin.\n\nIn a blinding storm, Tom raced Viki to the hospital, where she gave birth to a bouncing baby daughter, Jessica. Clint and Viki shared in the joy of their first natural child together. Before he died, Mitch Laurence had planted a post-hypnotic suggestion in the brain of one of his faithful disciples, Allison Perkins. From the grave, Mitch instructed Allison to steal Viki's baby and make it look as if Niki Smith was the kidnapper.\n\nWearing a Niki-like red wig and a flashy dress, Allison ventured into Llanfair and absconded with Jessica. While Clint, Viki and the authorities frantically combed Llanview for the missing baby, Allison took the child to her mother's house in New Jersey. Maria Roberts found out about Allison and manipulated the situation so that Clint suspected Viki had once again turned into Niki and kidnapped Jessica. Viki was angry at Clint's suspicions and it caused a rift between them. By the time Maria had gotten Allison to return Jessica, Clint and Viki had broken up. Their second marriage was over!\n\nCord was dismayed to hear that Clint Buchanan was his father, and that the million dollars that he believed had been left to him by Al Roberts, actually came from Asa. Tina pretended to go along with Cord's wish to give the money back. However, while Cord was giving Asa a check for the money, Tina was buying the tiny Caribbean island of Devil's Claw, sinking every cent in their joint bank account into the real estate deal. When Cord learned of Tina's lies and manipulations, he broke up with her. Cord journeyed back to Devil's Claw with archeologist Kate Sanders in search of treasure that was rumored to be hidden on the island.\n\n1987\n\nMax Holden showed up in Llanview to ask Maria Roberts, a friend of his late mother, Patricia, for a loan to buy a ranch in Argentina. Maria agreed to give Max a substantial loan on one condition: he must somehow find a way to lure Tina out of town. Max eagerly accepted the mission. When Tina got the news of her pregnancy, she left a message on Cord's answering machine, but Maria got the message first and erased it! Thinking Cord didn't care that she was carrying his child, Tina fled town with Max. Their destination: Argentina!\n\nIn Buenos Aires, Max discovered that the ranch's owner, Don Alonzo, had been murdered. Before long, Max and Tina got mixed up in a dangerous drug ring led by Dante Medina, whose daughter, Gabrielle, Max had recently romanced. Dismayed at his involvement with Tina, Gabrielle didn't tell Max the big news: she was pregnant with his child!\n\nWhen Cord finally discovered that Tina was having his baby, he headed for Buenos Aires to try to convince her to return. Kate (who knew that her brother Jamie was part of the drug ring) journeyed with him. Cord and Kate grew close as they shared a sizzling tango in the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn the ensuing melee with the drug ring, Tina was taken hostage, and tumbled over the ferocious Iguazu Falls, and was presumed dead. Max, Gabrielle, Kate, and Cord returned to Llanview.\n\nClint and Viki's relationship was headed for divorce, when Viki collapsed after witnessing a fight between Clint and Tom. Viki awoke with selective amnesia, which prompted the judge to block their divorce for six months. Tests revealed that Viki had a brain aneurism which required immediate surgery. During successful brain surgery, Viki had an out of body experience in which she took a fantastic journey towards Heaven. Guided by her guardian angel, a quirky little man named Virgil, Viki joyously reunited her with many of her deceased friends and relatives, including Joe, who urged her to return to earth and the man she truly loved -- Clint.\n\nDorian was horrified and deeply hurt when she discovered that her daughter Cassie was having an affair with her boyfriend, Jonathan Russell. Dorian left Llanview to become the United States Ambassador to Mendorra.\n\nCassie and Jon moved in together, but immediately problems surfaced when Cassie came to suspect that Jon was interested in an ex-girlfriend. Rob Coronal returned to town, and he and Cassie grew closer when they worked together to determine who killed Rob's father, Alex. Soon, Cassie and Rob reunited.\n\nMelinda Cramer Janssen, who years earlier had been committed to a mental institution, was finally released in 1987. After years of therapy, Melinda now seemed to be a healthy, assertive, if slightly aggressive, person. With Dorian living in Mendorra, she moved in with Cassie at Dorian's penthouse.\n\nCord's mother, Maria, was racked with guilt over her role in Tina's demise. She admitted to Clint that yes, she encouraged Max to take Tina out of town, and that she lent him the money to buy the Ranch. Maria claimed to have done this only because she thought Max would be good for Tina! Lying through her teeth, Maria never dreamed Tina was really pregnant. Her argument proved convincing and Clint believed her.\n\nGabrielle heard rumors of a white woman being kept alive in the jungle and sent out a guide to investigate. He returned with a feverish and weak Tina! As her fever subsided, a bereft Tina told Gabrielle that she must have miscarried her baby in her terrifying tumble over the falls. When Gabrielle went into labor, Tina helped in the delivery of her beautiful baby boy. Believing that Tina was married to Max -- and that she could give the baby a good life -- Gabrielle turned her newborn son over to her. Tina hurried back to Llanview with the baby, whom she named \"Al,\" after Cord's late father. Tina arrived in Llanview and discovered that Cord was about to marry Kate. She raced to the church arriving moments after the ceremony. She presented Cord with baby Al and collapsed at his feet. With Tina's return, Cord and Kate's marriage was now invalid.\n\nMaria Roberts learned from Gabrielle that baby Al was not Cord and Tina's child. Armed with this news, Maria threatened to expose Tina if she didn't grant Cord a divorce. Tina had no choice but to end her marriage to the man she loved. At the same time, Maria became unhinged! She wanted Clint Buchanan all for herself, and that meant she would have to murder Viki - and frame Tina for the crime! Wearing a blond wig, Maria tried to run down Viki in her car. Fortunately, she was saved by her gardener, Gilbert -- who bore more than a striking resemblance to her guardian angel, Virgil. Next, Maria applied a deadly poison to a pair of earrings that Tina planned to give Viki for her birthday. The poison, designed to kill on contact, accidently spilled on Maria during a scuffle with Tina, who watched in horror as Maria fell to the floor -- dead!\n\nCord anxiously prepared for his second wedding to Kate, which was postponed because of Maria's murder. Tina was arrested, and during her trial, truth that Gabrielle and Max were really baby Al's parents came out. Tina was found guilty and sent to jail. When new evidence surfaced, Tina was cleared of the murder charges, and Tina and Cord made love.\n\nBack at home, Max tried to forget Tina by having a sexy affair with a suave and sexy older businesswoman, Lee Halpern. Lee came to Llanview to open a branch of her shady consulting firm, Dyna-women. Unbeknownst to anyone, Lee was actually Tom Dennison's not-so-late wife, Carol. Mari Lynn had a bitter reconciliation with the mother she had never known. Fortunately, the teenager found solace in the arms of her compassionate boyfriend, Wade Coleman.\n\nAsa was delighted to reunite with Lee's friend, Renee Divine. Renee, who ran a brothel in Nevada, had once had a fling with Asa. Now, years later, they picked up where they left off. Renee was so charmed by her handsome millionaire that she gave up her \"madam\" business and stayed in Llanview to start a new life with Asa. Meanwhile, Max proposed to Tina.\n\nMax's amazing discovery that he was actually Al's father did not deter him from pursuing Tina. Despite her lingering feelings for Cord, Tina finally agreed to become Mrs. Max Holden. Together, they searched in vain for Tina's real miracle baby, who was not dead after all! Assisted by Iguazu Indians, a feverish Tina had given birth to a baby boy in the jungles of Argentina. Together, Max and Tina searched for the child, unaware that the baby, whom they called \"Milagro\" (spanish for miracle), was being held by Max's enemy, Rolo. Rolo was an old associate of Gabrielle's father, Dante Medina.\n\nAfter a struggle with the dangerous Jamie Sanders, Clint was shot in the head, and was blinded. Viki had a difficult time getting Clint to accept his blindness. Clint needed help and found it in Sarah Gordon, his tough-as-nails therapist. Sarah was a tough teacher! She refused to allow Viki or the rest of the Buchanan family to treat Clint like a helpless baby. As a result of her work with Clint, Sarah won the love and affection of the entire Buchanan family. This was especially true of Cord, who turned to Sarah after Kate finally called it quits with him and left town to pursue her scientific studies.\n\n1988\n\nMelinda had witnessed the murder of mobster Alex Crown, so his murderer, Donald Lamarr tried to make Melinda think she was insane. Melinda enlisted the help of her neice Cassie and Cassie's boyfriend Jon Russell in infiltrating the Mountainview Clinic to search for evidence that would implicate the evil Dr. Donald Lamarr in the murder Alex Crown. Melinda's plan was to feign insanity, and, once admitted to the Clinic, she'd dig up the information she needed. Cassie at first was afraid to let her Aunt Melinda go through with the dangerous scheme, but eventually she relented.\n\nMelinda was nearly killed in a psychotic experiment conducted by Lamarr, but she escaped and went to tell the cops. Lamarr snapped and attacked Lee Halpern Sanders, when she learned he was the killer. As he leaned over a scantily-clad Lee on the bed of a hotel room, Lee's daughter Mari Lynn stepped into the room. She screamed at Lamarr to get off of her mother and then pulled a gun on him. As she pulled the trigger, Lamarr threw Lee's body in front of his, and she took the bullet. Mari Lynn had killed her own mother, but only because of Lamarr's evil actions.\n\nMari Lynn went on trial for the crime, pleading that it was Lamarr who was to blame, not her. Melinda and Jon decided to stage an incident in court that would prove Lamarr's guilt. While he was on the stand, a man who bore a striking resemblance to dead mob kingpin Alex Crown stepped into the courtroom. Lamarr panicked and attacked the man, who was actually just a cop in disguise. This was enough to prove Lamarr's guilt and Mari Lynn was freed.\n\nTina had landed Max, so now she desperately wanted to get her miracle baby, Milagro, back! The child had been plucked away from the Iguazu Indians by Max's enemy, the evil Rolo, who demanded a million dollars for the baby's safe return. Max captured Rolo, but his accomplice, Lita, had spirited the baby to Italy. Tina and Max followed in hot pursuit, and rescued the baby in a convent. Back home, Tina introduced \"Milagro\" to the baby's real father, Cord. They renamed the child Clinton James Roberts - \"CJ\" for short.\n\nDuring her vows, Tina absent-mindedly blurted out \"I take thee, Cord\" instead of \"I take thee, Max.\" When Max heard Tina's blunder, he called off the wedding on the spot! Tina's blunder, however, had proven to Cord just how much they still loved each other. But there were obstacles for the couple to overcome; in particular, one gigantic obstacle that came in the form of Cord's Uncle \"Bo.\"\n\nAsa and Renee made plans to marry. Everyone agreed that Renee was the best thing to happen to crusty old Asa in years! The only resistance to the marriage came from Asa's newly-returned son Bo. Asa couldn't help but notice that Bo was acting strangely. The family was shocked when he was able to perform an emergency tracheotomy on Viki after she nearly choked on the some food. He refused to discuss his \"ex-wife\" Didi, and even began exhibiting totally out-of-character romantic tendencies for his niece Tina.\n\nTina, reeling from her mistake at the altar, was particularly susceptible to Bo's sudden charm. One night, they even made love. Bo just wasn't himself because Bo was faux! He was actually the demented Dr. Patrick London, who had undergone extensive cosmetic surgery to look like Bo at the behest of Asa's enemies Elizabeth Sanders and Lord Henry Leighton. Tina was shocked to discover her one-night stand with Bo had resulted in a pregnancy - she was now carrying his child/grandneice or nephew!\n\nDisguised as Bo, Patrick infiltrated the Buchanan Empire and slowly drugged Asa, causing him to lose his mental capacities. \"Faux Bo\" hoped to marry Tina -- then cash in on her inheritance. All the while, the real Bo was being held prisoner in a dingy dungeon, along with his wife, Didi, and his ex-wife Delila. They were watched over by a psychotic woman by the name of Ursula Blackwell, whom Patrick had befriended in the mental institution.\n\nThe Faux Bo was exposedand in the ensuing melee, the real Bo threw him into an electrical panel. In the process, Patrick grabbed Didi and the two were electrocuted. Just before dying, Didi told Bo that she loved him. Becky Lee brought Bo's rebellious teenage son, Drew, to town to attend Didi's funeral. The other survivor, Delila, joyously reunited with her husband Rafe and their daughter, Sammi. Just as Delila returned to Llanview, Cassie left town to visit Dorian in Mendorra.\n\nClint entered a grueling 100 mile horserace through the Arizona desert, determined to show everyone that he could overcome his handicap. Clint was unaware that George Vasquez, Maria's vengeful brother, had slipped asthma medication into his horse's feed that turned the normally docile horse violent! The drugged horse threw Clint, who fell to the dusty ground, hit his head on a rock and lost consciousness.\n\nWhen he awoke, a groggy Clint realized that his vision had returned, but he had been inexplicably transported back 100 years in time to an old west town called Buchanan City. Clint had somehow slipped back in time, and landed in the home of his wild west ancestors!\n\nClint was astounded by the sight of Buck Buchanan, who looked remarkably like his Pa, Asa, and his right-hand man, Cody Vasquez who looked exactly like Clint's son, Cord! Equally amazing was Ginny Fletcher, the town's uptight schoolmarm because she was the spitting image of Viki! Clint realized that Ginny was Viki's great-grandmother.\n\nAn old Indian clairvoyant, Clear Eyes, explained to Clint that he had been called into the past to bring Farmer McGillis' clan and Rancher Buchanan's family together to mend their fences. Clint eventually accomplished the mission and watched with deep satisfaction as the two families celebrated their newfound friendship. Clint's next mission was to reunite Ginny Fletcher with her estranged paramour, Randolph Lord. It dawned on Clint that if he did not accomplish his goal, then Viki would never be born!\n\nSteve Holden married his brother Max's former flame, Gabrielle Medina, and they honeymooned in Arizona. Steve stumbled upon George Vasquez's deception and paid a painful price. To silence Steve, Vasquez hit him over the head with a fireplace poker. George would have killed Steve, but his life was spared by the sudden appearance of Blaize Buchanan. Blaize had been hurled momentarily into the future to alert Viki that Clint had survived a western time warp.\n\nThanks to Blaize, Viki was determined to find Clint. With Clear Eyes' help, Viki made an incredible journey to Buchanan City, circa 1888. She arrived in the nick of time. Clint had become resigned to spending the rest of his life in the past. Just as Clint and Ginny were about to exchange their holy wedding vows, Viki stumbled through the doors and locked eyes with Clint. While they shared a joyous reunion, Ginny fainted from the sight of her \"twin.\"\n\nTogether at last, Viki and Clint went back to Clear Eye's cave, and they were miraculously transported back to the future!\n\nUrsula Blackwell went insane. Always unstable, she had secretly been in love with Patrick London all along. His death caused her to become consumed with Patrick's legacy; the unborn child Tina Roberts was carrying. Afraid that Tina would abort the baby, she decided to make sure Tina never got a chance to do so. Ursula kidnapped Tina and dragged her via boat to a lighthouse off the coast of New Jersey, where she had also imprisoned her wheelchair-bound father, Cornelius. Ursula informed Tina that she would be her guest for the next nine months; until Patrick's baby was delivered alive and well.\n\nTina, not only pregnant with the child of the evil Patrick London, but now imprisoned by Ursula, was terrified. Cord and Max united to rescue Tina, tracking her down to the lighthouse. Meanwhile, Ursula had finally lost it and was readying to kill Tina. Max and Cord burst in, and gunfire erupted, hitting Ursula's father, and sending both him and Tina crashing out a window of the lighthouse and plummeting to the beach below! Ursula's father was dead; his body breaking Tina's fall. Tina miscarried, to her relief, and Ursula was institutionalized. Tina once again set her sights on Cord, who was occupied with Clint's therapist, Sarah Gordon -- but sexpot Tina prevailed.\n\nGabrielle found comfort in Max's arms and seduced him one drunken night as Steve lay in a coma. When Max spurned her, she attempted to smother Steve with a pillow, but she relented just in time. Steve fully recovered. Gabrielle lied to Max, telling him that she was pregnant with his child. Max discovered her charade, and continued to fight his lusty attraction to her. Eventually, Gabrielle felt compelled to tell Steve about what happened between her and Max. However, in her warped version of the facts, Gabrielle told Steve that Max had seduced her! Angry at his brother and fed up with Gabrielle, Steve demanded a divorce.\n\nMari Lynn married the man of her dreams, Wade Coleman. Soon after, Mari Lynn's life took an an amazing turn when she was cast as one of the leads in the TV soap opera, \"Fraternity Row.\" The star of the show was Sarah Gordon's egomanical sister, Megan. When their father, environmentalist Roger Gordon arrived in town, Sarah went overboard trying to please him.\n\nMax and Megan found themselves immediately at odds but nevertheless, they became a couple. When they finally did make love, Megan feared the new feelings of intimacy and tried to move away to California. Her producer, Randy Stone, made the move impossible by blackmailing her. Randy had used a cassette of a porno film she had appeared in early in her career. Max helped Megan to counter-blackmail Randy, and before long, they were together again.\n\nStrangely, Larry tried to convince Viki not to attend her high school reunion. Viki insisted, and found out that no one remembered her being at graduation. Viki learned she had left school during the senior year, had a baby (delivered by Larry) and had the memory erased by a hypnotist. Viki embarked on a crusade to find her daughter.\n\nViki's search apparently ended when she met a young photographer by the name of Christine Cromwell, and her father Leo, who claimed that his daughter was Viki's. Leo claimed he'd had a romance with Viki's alternate personality Niki Smith years ago. For weeks, Viki believed that Christine was her daughter. Christine, an awkward young girl, allowed herself to be drawn into the Buchanan family, and accepted the fact that she must be Viki's child because her father had said so.\n\nWhen Viki set eyes on Roger Gordon, she felt a strange sensation. Memories came flooding back to her. As it turned out, Leo had used Viki's search as a scam. He was a money-hungry louse and decided that if his daughter became a Lord, she would also become rich... as would he. Christine had known nothing of his plan. Viki soon discovered that one of Roger's daughters was her own. But was it sweet Sarah (with whom Viki had developed a strong and loving bond) or feisty Megan (who had been Viki's sworn enemy since the day they met)?\n\nIn November, Llanview celebrated the double wedding of Asa and Renee, and the second marriage of Cord and Tina. Unbeknownst to anyone, Ursula had escaped from the looney bin and set out to blow Tina sky high with an exploding wedding cake. However, instead of Tina, Steve Holden became Ursula's unwitting victim! During the reception, Steve noticed that the cake was rigged to explode, so he threw himself in front of his wife, Brenda. He died instantly. Days later, Steve's widow, Brenda McGillis, received a pleasant surprise amidst the tragedy -- she was pregnant with his child.\n\nTina's pursuit of the Mendorran crown jewels led her to Atlantic City. Tina was held captive by two escaped criminals she thought she would never see again --- Ursula Blackwell and Jamie Sanders! Thirsting for revenge, the demented Ursula strapped Tina in an electric chair. Tina would have fried to her death except the police arrived and arrested Jamie and Ursula and return them to the slammer for good!\n\nMillionaire entrepeneur Michael Grande began searching for the lost city of gold called Eterna. Eterna was an underground mecca that had been blown up years before by its developer, Victor Lord. Michael tried to turn Viki back into Niki, who apparently knew the whereabouts of the lost city.\n\nMichael Grande secretly conspired with Max's mistress, Gabrielle, to wrest away control of his hotel, the Holden Towers. Max grew to despise Gabrielle for what she had done! Max pulled up stakes headed home to Texas.\n\n1989\n\nThrough Michael Grande's machinations, Viki and several others -- including Tina, Cord, Gabrielle, Christine, Leo, Wade, and Roger -- were trapped in the underground city of Eterna! Alone with Viki in the underground city, Roger Gordon finally confessed his long-buried secret: He was raised in Eterna, but had found a way to escape. He met Viki when she was in high school. They made love. One day, Viki watched in horror as the entrance to Eterna exploded. Believing that Roger was dead, she turned into Niki Smith! Viki/Niki gave birth to his Roger's daughter -- Megan! She had carried the baby as Niki, and though she had turned back to Viki during childbirth, Victor Lord immediately had his daughter hypnotized to forget the whole thing! He then paid Roger to take the baby and leave town. Viki was amazed to learn that Megan, who had been her adversary, was actually her flesh and blood! While in Eterna, Viki and Roger's old feelings for each other began to resurface. Led by Clint, the authorities located and rescued everyone trapped inside just before Eterna collapsed.\n\nViki enjoyed an uneasy \"reunion\" with her reluctant daughter, Megan. In time, Viki and Megan mended their fences and came to respect, admire and love each other.\n\nA behind-the-scenes stalker, Neil Delaney, was terrorizing the cast and crew of Fraternity Row. Before being apprehended, Neil kidnapped Sarah Gordon, and held her hostage in the University clock tower. Bo heroically rescued her. As they grew closer, he confessed his feelings to Sarah, but she was hesitant to get involved with the recently-widowed Mr. Buchanan. Before long, Bo convinced Sarah to move in with him!\n\nMegan poured her energies into her acting career. On \"Fraternity Row,\" she received the acting challenge of a lifetime when she was asked to play a dual role. In addition to the straight-laced \"Roxanne,\" Megan would now play Ruby Bright, Roxanne's twin sister, a much wilder character. Viki immediately saw a parallel to Niki Smith, and was concerned for her daughter, but Megan was determined to take on the challenge. Megan even dressed up as Ruby and went to Atlantic City to do \"field research.\"\n\nBrenda McGillis was going through one rough pregnancy. With the father of her unborn child dead, she turned to Larry Wolek for comfort, which he readily offered. Larry and Brenda became very intimate over time, even as her pregnancy was put to the ultimate test. She became unconscious and was inadvertantly trapped in a room where radioactive testing was being conducted. Yet, she survived and readied to give birth to a baby.\n\nAt the same time, Gabrielle was shocked when Michael's very pregnant wife Alicia Grande strolled into town, wanting to reconcile with him. Austin Buchanan, son of Asa's brother, Pike, arrived in town and became obsessed with Sarah. He set out to steal her from Bo. Austin knew that Bo and Michael Grande were mortal enemies, so he rigged the brakes on Michael's car to fail, the accident sent Alicia into labor, and injured Gabrielle instead! Austin framed Bo for Alicia's murder. Austin eventually confessed to the crime, but wanted Sarah to make love to him. She tried to put him off, but he became angry and brutally raped her.\n\nAlicia gave birth to a baby son, Rick (named after Michael's father Garrick), but didn't survive her own injuries and died shortly thereafter. Gabrielle, riddled with guilt by the news of Alicia's death, sneaked into the neo-natal unit to see baby Garrick. As she looked on, suddenly the baby's cardiac monitor went flat and Garrick was dead! Thinking fast, Gabrielle made a difficult decision. Gabrielle knew that his son's death -- coming on the heels of Alicia's death -- would destroy Michael, so she switched Brenda's baby with Alicia's. Brenda was devastated to learn that her baby had died (but who could question it, after the trauma it had suffered in nine short months).\n\nMichael was also in turmoil over Alicia's death, but having their child made it easier on him. But Brenda refused to believe her baby was dead - she had a gut instinct that little Steven was still alive. She pushed away Larry and her new admirer, Dan Wolek, who had returned to town as a doctor. Michael grew closer to Gabrielle, who felt terrible pangs of guilt over her deception. Michael proposed to Gabrielle and she accepted, but bolted from the ceremony moments before her \"I do's\"!\n\nAfter the rape, Sarah shot Austin, and soon discovered she was pregnant with his child. To protect her, Cord and Asa buried Austin's body. However, the evil Buchanan cousin was not dead after all! He crawled out of his shallow grave, and sought revenge on Sarah, resulting in her miscarrying Austin's baby. Austin's reign of terror quickly came to an end. After taking Viki and Megan hostage, Clint found them and shot Austin. Felled by Clint's bullet, Austin plunged out a high-rise window to his death, but not before shooting Viki!\n\nThe traumatic shooting shocked Megan and caused her personality to suddenly split. Instantly, Megan believed she was her soap opera alter-ego, the free-spirited Ruby Bright. Ruby/Megan ran off to Atlantic City, donned a brunette wig, and flirted with some of the high-rollers she encountered. One of them was none other than former Llanview con artist Marco Dane! Marco cheated one of the gamblers in the casino and when the man came after him, Marco grabbed Ruby and hit the road. They traveled for weeks, and Marco actually came to fall in love with Ruby/Megan. But Megan didn't stay submerged forever, and when she finally came around, she demanded that Marco take her back to Llanview. Marco and Megan shared plenty of adventures while together in Llanview, even though Megan decided to continue her romance with Max.\n\nAfter snapping back into reality as Megan, she took up with Prince Raymond Hohenstein from Mendorra. Though she loved Raymond, she realized that he stood to lose his throne by marrying a commoner like her, and she returned to Llanview to get on with her life.\n\nTimes were tough for Rafe and Delila Garretson. Rafe was spending all of his time at the police station while Delila was singing away the hours at Rob Coronal's club. When Rafe demanded that his wife stay home more often and take care of their daughter Samantha, Delila balked. When a recording executive happened upon Delila and offered her a six-month tour around the country, she accepted. Delila pledged to Rafe that she'd be back in six months. Ultimately, Delila remained on tour and Rafe left town with Samantha to join Delila while she pursued her dreams.\n\nWhen Gabrielle's baby switch was finally exposed, she was put on trial for the crime. Max, under intense questioning, confessed on the witness stand to a stunned courthouse that he still loved Gabrielle! Megan, listening in horror to Max's confession, ran from the courtroom. Max tried to win back Megan's love, but it was too late. Gabrielle was found guilty by reason of insanity and remanded to a halfway house with Tina. Tina had been sentenced to six months of incarceration for failing to reveal her intimate knowledge of the notorious baby switch.\n\nDan tried to jump in and take his father's place in Brenda and Steven's lives. He succeeded for a short time, as Brenda temporarily fell for his charms. A jealous Larry had some choice words for his son.\n\nAndy Harrison entered Max's life during the summer of 1989. Max found Andy tearing up his bar, Max's Place! She turned out to be the half-sister he had never known. Andy angrily confronted Max, informing him that their mother, Patricia, had recently died -- and she blamed Max for her death. In time, Max and Andy reconciled. Andy went to work for Max at the bar, where she ran into Dr. Dan Wolek one day. Andy pined after Dan for months, even when he had his eyes set on Brenda.\n\nAfter months of therapy, the traumatized Sarah slowly put the painful past behind her, and became engaged to Bo. They happily planned their wedding, but the highly anticipated event turned sour when Bo's brother, Clint and Sarah's father, Roger, could not keep from getting into jealous fights over Viki.\n\nRoger had a stunning revelation: he and Viki got married when they were kids! At Clint's insistence, Roger and Viki's still-valid marriage was quickly annulled. Clint posed an ultimatum to Viki: either she move with him to Arizona, or their marriage was over. When Viki bid Clint adieu, he turned to Gabrielle's mother, Julia Medina. Julia followed Clint to Arizona, and tried to seduce him. However, Clint pulled away, resolving to return to Llanview and give his marriage to Viki one more try.\n\nWhen Tina was released from the halfway house, she quickly needed a way to get back into Cord's good favor (He was falling for Debra Medina at the time). Tina went to work for Lord Love the Children, a non-profit organization that searched to place \"the right child with the right home.\" The charity was run by the wonderfully caring and religious Ambrose Wyman and his wife Selena. But things went awry when Tina befriended a lonely little girl who claimed that she still had a mother and a father.\n\nA curious Tina began to snoop around in Ambrose and Selena's files. At first, she thought she was just being silly and even went to Ambrose with what the little girl had told her. Ambrose quelled her fears, but later he told Selena they'd have to keep an eye on Ms. Tina Roberts. As Tina got to know the little girl more, however, a nagging worry kept eating at her. She told Cord about the situation and they broke into Lord Love the Children late one night. Tina found the girl's doll laying carelessly in the hallway and instantly knew something was wrong.\n\nWhen Tina and Cord dug further into the mess, the shocking truth was revealed: Ambrose and Selena were using the charity as a cover for an illegal adoption ring: they were kidnapping children and selling them to the highest bidder. Tina and Cord were about to go to the police when Ambrose enacted his final plan. Luring Tina, Cord, Max, Viki and Roger to a warehouse the night of New Year's Eve, he locked them inside with plastic explosives and told them they would all die. The group panicked, quickly turning the warehouse inside out looking for the bomb. When Roger found it, it was quickly disarmed. Ambrose came storming back into the warehouse, brandishing a gun. When Max made an attempt to tackle him, Ambrose fired, nearly killing Max. Cord and Roger wrestled the gun from his hand and Selena and Ambrose were shipped off to prison. Max barely pulled through emergency surgery under Dan and Larry Wolek, but miraculously recovered."
