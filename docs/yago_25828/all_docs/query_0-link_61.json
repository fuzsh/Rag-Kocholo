        "text": "Wanda was one of the greatest characters ever on soaps period. Marilyn Chris was such a great actress. Pity that OLTL didn't realize what they had with her.\n\nThey never really attempted to even build up a family around her that I remember - just some convoluted thing when the Buchanans came on to make her Asa's cousin - but never really capitalized on that.\n\nWhen the Wolek family played out with her only being an in-law too - she just faded away.\n\nHarry O'Neill\n\nAnthony Makana\n\nTed Clayton\n\nJohnny Drummond\n\nWade Coleman (and how he saved Viki from being cremated alive)\n\nRoberta \"Tiny\" Coleman (and how she cleared Tina of Maria's death)\n\nTom Denison\n\nMari Lyn Denison\n\nPatrick London\n\nDavid Renaldi (loved me some David and Jenny)\n\nAlex Crown (until he was murdered and became Sloan Carpenter)\n\nRob Coronal\n\nAristotle Descamedes (played by Steven Hill) - I still remember his crush on \"Dori-anne\"\n\nMelinda Cramer\n\nMario Corelli\n\nIvan Kipling\n\nIna Hopkins\n\nKatrina Carr\n\nMarcello Salta (it's been long enough...the show can rehire Stephen Schnetzer as a new character)\n\nGretel (Rae) Cummings\n\nMimi King\n\nHeron (Viki's butler and husband of Madge the Palmolive lady)\n\nKim (Viki's nanny)\n\nEcho DiSavoy\n\nDrew Ralston\n\nDrew Buchanan\n\nChuck Wilson\n\nBen Davidson\n\nSam Rappaport\n\nJohn Sykes\n\nRoseanne Delgado\n\nLeann Demorest\n\nDuann Demorest\n\nElizabeth Sanders\n\nLee Halpern Denison (the actress has been playing Marty's nurse)\n\nDonald Lamarr\n\nColin McGiver\n\nTroy McGiver\n\nRoger Gordon\n\nAnd I have a soft spot for Piccolino, the Italian giant Tina met while she was disguised as a nun, trying to find her baby Milagro (aka CJ). How he cried when she left and gave her the bleeding heart flower. \"Il cuore di sanguinante.\"\n\nThat is hilarious. Being new to soaps, the whole faux Bo thing had me on the edge of my seat. And then when poor Didi died. I didn't know her from Adam, but my Mom told me how popular they were as a couple. I just loved that story. The beauty of youth lol\n\nIt seems like no matter who was writing the show (lets forget Dena! lol), they always managed to create interesting, compelling characters. I think that is one of the reasons why Ron can bring so many characters back and they all seem to merge so well with the current characters.\n\nOh, and I so miss Wanda. But if I remember, it was her decision to leave. So that can't be blamed on OLTL.\n\nOh, dear, where to begin, lol.\n\nCassie Callison\n\nHerb Callison\n\nRob Coronal\n\nMelinda Cramer\n\nMarco Dane (my ALL-TIME favorite OLTL character)\n\nMari Lynn Dennison\n\nTom Dennison\n\n\"Diane,\" who was released from prison w/ Dorian\n\nRafe Garretson\n\nMegan Gordon\n\nSarah Gordon\n\nMichael Grande\n\nCarla Grey Hall\n\nLt. Ed Hall\n\nBecky Lee Hunt\n\nDr. Ivan Kipling\n\nMitch Laurence\n\nPatrick London\n\nTina (Clayton) Lord\n\nGabrielle Medina\n\nDidi O'Neill\n\nAllison Perkins\n\nRuth Perkins\n\nDelila Ralston\n\nDavid Renaldi\n\nMaria Roberts\n\nJon Russell\n\nElizabeth Sanders\n\nLee Halpern Sanders\n\nPamela Stuart\n\nBrad Vernon\n\nSamantha Vernon (adored the way she'd call Asa \"Mr. B\")\n\nVirgil, the angel, played by John Fiedler (sp?) from \"The Bob Newhart Show\"\n\nJenny Wolek (my favorite OLTL character, next to Marco)\n\nKaren Wolek\n\nDr. Larry Wolek\n\nWanda Wolek\n\nI also remember someone w/ the name \"Hortense\" (?), played by Uta Hagen, as well as Christine Ebersole's character, whose name I'm blanking on at the moment.\n\nI LOVED Jamie & Elizabeth Sanders, and Allison Perkins and her poor mom!\n\nWhen did Niki Smith stop wearing wigs with long red hair?\n\nHas anyone mentioned Tracey James or her sometimes-henchman whose name, I think, was Stick?\n\nOr the character Rick played by Richard Grieco?\n\nOr the young girl named Mary (I think) who Dorian took in, was blackmailed by Jamie Sanders, and ended up falling out a window during a struggle with Cassie?\n\nSophia (Pellegrino?) Loved her... great actress and the only character who actually made Antonio tolerable.\n\nMel Hayes and his daughter Dorothy\n\nTHANK YOU for bringing up Tracey James and you beat me to it!!!! Loved the storyline involving her. She was the psycho nurse (or hospital volunteer, can't really remember) who developed quite an obsession with Dr. Larry Wolek. So much to the point that she cut the breaks on his wife Laurel's car which resulted in her dying in a car crash. She also attempted to kill Cassie by tampering with a stove so that it would release carbon monoxide in her apartment. She stabbed Viki's therapist, Dr. Polk, in the back (literally) and Viki was arrested for the murder. Good stuff back then."
