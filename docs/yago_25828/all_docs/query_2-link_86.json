        "text": "Double Casting\n\nDual and triple roles are very common in soaps especially when there's a dayplayer the productions likes and gives him/her another chance. I must say though that OLTL had less than I expected. I listed all the actor and actress' I could remember who played more than one role on the show. This section is devided by intentional and unintentional dual roles amd under intentional ones we've got identical twins, other look allikes, ghosts and \"The Old West\". Hope you enjoy this.\n\nUnintentional Dual Roles: Two roles or more which were played by the same actor/actress and didn't have a storyline conection, explanation or mention.\n\nIntentional Dual Roles: Two roles or more which were played by the same actor/actress and were explained through a storyline (old west, identical twins, ghosts etc.)\n\nCharacters' names in BLUE are unintentional dual roles\n\nCharacters' names in RED are intentional dual roles.\n\n*** - means an unsure role (only one source to back it) so feel free to add your information (backing it up or falsing it)\n\nIdentical Twins\n\nLee Patterson\n\nJoe Riley (1968-1970; 1972-1979; 1987)\n\nBrother to Eileen and his twin Tom, Joe Riley was the hard living, hard working, hard drinking, Irish Catholic guy. He proved to be a valuable asset to The Banner and Victor Lord greatly admired the tough-as-nails reporter. But he didn't regard Joe as suitable husband material for his daughter, Viki. He has always been good friend to Vinnie Wolek and the two buddies end up falling for the same girl; Joe for Viki and Vinnie for Niki. Joe and Viki finally won over Victor and Viki's alternate personality, Niki - and married. Their bliss was short-circuited when Joe went to California in pursuit of Vinnieï¿½s innocense (Vinnie was charged with murder). Viki was devastated to hear that her husband's car had gone over a cliff. Although his body wasnï¿½t recovered, under pressure from her father, Viki had Joe declared dead.\n\nA couple of years later, a man suffering from memory loss wandered into the diner where Wanda Webb was working. She fell for him and tried to help him when he suffered a potentially fatal brain aneurism. This man also had evidence that the new man in Vikiï¿½s life, Steve Burke, didnï¿½t kill his secratery Marcy Wade. With help, Joe's memory returned and he learned that his precious wife Viki was engaged to Steve. Not wishing to upset Viki's life again and fearing he was going to die soon, Joe kept his return a secret as he provided the information necessary to clear Steve annonimously. Secretly he watched his wife marry another man from the bushes.\n\nAnother attack put Joe in the hospital and it became known to Viki and the town that Joe was still alive. Although Viki still loved Joe, she had made her commitment to Steve and felt that she should remain in that marriage. Cathy Craig was beginning her writing career and asked for Joe's help. Fearing that he would never be able to get Viki back, Joe had a brief fling with Cathy. When Cathy announced that she was pregnant, Joe offered marriage but she refused. To Joe's joy, Viki was able to dissolve her marriage to Steve and the loving couple quickly remarried.\n\nWhen Cathy's baby, Megan, was born, she had a genetic heart defect which was inherited from her father. Viki asked that her husband not be informed of this since she realized that it would make Joe reluctant to have other children. This secret would put a strain on the Rileysï¿½ marriage when it was revealed (by Dorian), but by then Viki was already pregnant. One day while drivingMegan to the hospital, Viki had an accident which resulted in Meganï¿½s death. Cathy blamed Viki for the death of her daughter and was jelouse when Viki and Joe welcomed a healthy son, Kevin Riley.\n\nCathy kidnapped Kevin from the hospital nursery putting the new parents through hell for months. Through this time Joe began to drink a lot and Viki even pushed him from their house. Fortunately their son was ultimately returned to them, whole and healthy and they reconciled. Joe started having trouble headaches and was diagnosed with a brain tumer only Dorian convinced him to hide that fact from his family. Viki found out eventually and the tumer was removed but when Viki and Joe were expecting their second child, Joe started suffering again from recurring headaches and found out he had only few weeks to live. Joe decided against radical treatment, choosing to die at home in his wife's arms. Before his death he brought a new editor for The Banner, Clint Buchanan. Viki was pregnant at the time of his death and later gave birth to their second son Joey Riley Jr. When Viki visited Heaven after her near death experience she saw Joe there.\n\nTom Dennison (1986-1988)\n\nBrother of Eileen and Joe Riley, Tom Dennison grew up in the west away from the Rileys. He married a woman named Carol whom left him with their daughter Mari Lynn. Tom came to town in search of his daughter, who had gotten drawn into Mitch Laurence's religious cult. Clint spotted him, learned that he was a newspaper man, and hired him to work on The Banner. Recognizing that Tom bore a striking resemblance to Viki late husband, Joe, Clint planned a careful introduction but Viki Buchanan fainted when she saw the man. Later on after recovering from the initial shock she searched the mountain cabin with Tom where they found Joeï¿½s birth certificate which stated he was born a twin meaning Tom was Joeï¿½s long-lost twin.\n\nWhen Viki was in labors with Jessica Tom was the one who rushed her to the hospital. After Jessica's kidnapping, and the questions of a re-emergence of Niki Smith, Viki turned to Tom as her confidant. Their relationship became even closer when Viki lost her memory and forgot sheï¿½d remarried Clint. When it was discovered that Viki's problems arose from an aneurysm, Viki regained her memory and her love for her husband.\n\nTom remained in town while his daughter, Mari Lynn was in college. His not so late wife (thatï¿½s what he has told their daughter at least) came to town calling herself Lee Halpern now. Lee left Tom when Mari Lynn was just a little girl and was one of Renee Devineï¿½s girls in Vegas. The reunion wasnï¿½t easy at first and Mari Lynn had a hard time forgiving her mother. Tom didnï¿½ like much of his daughterï¿½s boyfriend, Wade Coleman but when he saw they were serious and were going to get married he accepted the boy to his family. Eventually Tom and Mari Lynn forgave Lee but tragedy came when Mari Lynn accidently shot her mother to death. After Leeï¿½s death Tom decided to leave town and return to the west to work.\n\nGerald Anthony\n\nMarco Dane (1977-1986; 1989; 1990) (1992-1993) on \"General Hospital\"\n\nBrother of Gary Corelli and twin brother of Mario, the Corelli boys were raised by their italian grandmother since their parents had died when they were young. Marco Dane came to town a week beofre Karen and Larryï¿½s wedding and Karen was affraid to see her ex-lover and pimp because he knew she had once been involved in an embezzlement scheme and spent six months on probation in Boston (a fact she hid from her family and future husband). Marco, though, was delighted to find Karen turning tricks for expensive gifts; he decided to become part of the equation, blackmailing Karen into working for him. So as not to appear to be a sponger, he also worked as Dorian's handyman, errand boy and lover. But blackmail was his main vocation. He learned that Melinda Cramer lied about her successful audition for Bruno Weston and threatened to tell the world. He had a brief romance with Sam Vernon but it was over after she found him cheating on her. He was a key witness at Bradï¿½s trial of the murder of Lana McLain and he also worked as a PI when Edwina hired him to spy on Becky Lee. When he was frustrated by Viki's efforts to free Karen from his control, he planned to blackmail Viki by mocking up suggestive photographs of Tina's head on Katrina Karr's nude body but he started to have feelings for Tina so he dropped that plan. Marco started to make Viki think Niki Smith was coming back as a revange. When Marco was found shot to death, Viki went on trial for his murder. Although Viki was exonerated of the charge, at a great price to Karen who revealed she was a hooker. The real killer was Talbot Huddelston who wanted to keep Marco shut since he blackmailed him about being the driver on the hit and run accident which killed Brian Kendall only Talbot didnï¿½t shot Marco, the victim was really his twin brother, Dr. Mario Corelli.\n\nMarco was posing as Mario, even working as a physician at Llanview Hospital. Karen was the first one to find out about this and later he aided her in switching Kat's living daughter for Jenny's dead child. Posing as his good brother, Marco suffered some degree of schizophrenia and Karen admitted him to a mental health institution. Marco (as Mario) was starting to fall for reprter Edwina Lewis and the two were about to get married. On thei wedding day Dorian who was suspectin Mario was really Marco called the cops on him and he was sent to jail after confessing his deeds. Edwina was furios and hurt but eventually gorgave him and married him after all. Although Marco served some time in jail for his masquerade, it did not cure him of his enjoyment of life on the edge. He later worked undercover with Karen among the Llanview underworld to discover Vinnie's murderer. Marco and Edwinaï¿½s marriage was doomed because of Marco's nefarious streak; Edwina wanted him to go to medical school, but he didn't think that he could stand the structure. Marco didnï¿½t share his undercover wor with his wife and kept disappearing and they later divorced. After finding Vinnieï¿½s killer Marco and Karen went on the run together since the mob made them targets.\n\nMarco eventually went straight, becoming a movie director (with Asaï¿½s money) and working with his younger brother Gary who had a hard time forgiving him about Marios death on a movie called Blood Moon. He became involved with his assistant Beverly Wilkes for a short while and later ran both a health club by day and by night a modeling agency called Dream Faces in which Sam Vernon was a partner. Although it started as a con, Edwina blew the whistle in an expose and, much to everyone's surprise, it became a winner. At that time he was romancing both his ex-wife, Edwina and his ex- girlfriend Sam without the one knowing about the other but it blew up in his face eventually. He had a friendly relationship with Astrid Collins and Maxie McDermott who worked for him at Dream Faces. He did a little investigative work on the Echo di Savoy affair with Viki and on San Carlos, even traveling to Venice when Asa was kidnapped. He helped his distant cousin Alex Crown excape from the mob by pretending to join his enemies the Descamedes. He had a brief thing with Jinx Rollins but boredom eventually drove him out of town.\n\nWhen Megan Gordonï¿½s alter ego, Ruby Bright came to an Atlantic City casino she met Marco there and the two fell in love coming close to a rush wedding. Marco followed Ruby to Llanview realizing who she was he finally left her and said goobye again. We met him again at Badderly when the mobsters gathered there he was one of them. Seeing Megan again he vowed to protect her and helped the other Llanviewers to get away from the island. That was the last he was seen in Llanview but later he popped up Port Charles when Tracy Quartermaine hired him to dig up some dirt on her daughter-in-law Jenny Eckert. He found out Jenny had a miscarriage by Senator Kensington when she was 16, what Tracy later used to blackmail her. Marco later became Jagger Catesï¿½ manager in boxing. When newcomer Sonny Corinthos threatened Jaggerï¿½s life, Marco promised Sonny a piece of Jagger's boxing action in exchange for Jagger's life. Sonny, liking the idea of \"owning\" Jagger, agreed to Marcoï¿½s plan. Marco left Port Charles for an unknown place.\n\nDr. Mario Corelli (1979)\n\nBrother of Gary and twin brother of Marco, the Corelli boys were raised by their italian grandmother since their parents had died when they were young. A straight arrow unlike his twin, Mario finished med school in Europe. he was mistaken for Marco and killed by Talbot Huddleston. Mario first came to town as the witness for the prosecution showing damaging letters Marco had written to him about how Viki had threatened him, only the real Mario was already dead and it was Marco who was on the stand. Marioï¿½s girlfriend from Europe, Ellen Snow came to Llanview to be with him and felt he was a changed man. She never learned that it was Marco, although Dorian hoped to use her to unmask the charade.\n\nJacqueline Courtney\n\nPat Ashley Kendall Brewster Lord (1975-1983)\n\nDaughter of Helena and Martin and sister of Maggie, Pat was raised by her mother while her sister lived in London with their father. Pat was a friend of Cathy Craig's and thought that Llanview would be the perfect place for her to raise her young son, Brian. She was hired as an editor for The Banner. An intelligent, career minded woman, she yearned for a stable home life with a like-minded man. Years before, when Pat was in the Peace Corps in Rio, she had had an affair with a Marine named Tony Harris and had been impregnated by him. Since Tony was not the marrying kind, Pat accepted the proposal of Paul Kendall who loved her and wanted to be a father to her child. But Paul was a marked man. Shortly after Pat moved to Llanview, Paul was reported killed. Finding Tony again, Pat planned to tell him the truth about Brian's parentage, but before she could Tony asked Cathy Craig to marry him and they elpoed. Eventually, though, Pat and Tony gave in to their feelings and after he divoced Cathy they planned to get back together. Pat told Tony the truth about Brian and they decided that it would be too much to tell Brian the truth. Pat and Tony became engaged and told Brian about it, but Brian lashed out and told his mother he hated Tony. On the night of their wedding, Tony was injured in an automobile accident and the wedding was off. Not only that but Pat also discovered that her late husband, Paul, wasnï¿½t dead after all. While Tony was recovering Pat decided she was going to give Paul another chance for Brianï¿½s sake; however her emotions for Tony were stronger then she had realized and they started seeing each other behind Paulï¿½s back. One day Brian had a big fight with his mother after seeing her with Tony and while they were fighting Pat slipped out the truth about Tony, Brian was shocked and he ran out to the street crying and was hit by a car driven by Talbot Huddelston and Karen Wolek. Brian was hurt pretty badly and died. Pat was devestated about her sonï¿½s death and she blamed herself not letting Tony or Paul come near her. When Paul was shot by his rivals from the past, Pat rushed him to the hospital. Pat and Paul reconciled but it didn't last long and they were shortly divorced.\n\nAfter divorcing Paul, Pat resolved to start her life over and poured her energies into her new TV talk show on Llanviewï¿½s WVLE-TV. She was flattered by the attention paid to her by newcomer millionaire Adam Brewster. After a short while the two were married but Adam was hiding something from his wife, he suffered dangerous epileptic seizures. Pat started suspecting not all of Adamï¿½s business were legid. Her leads brought her to San Carlos were her ex-husband Paul was missing. Pat found him in a hospital there but the man lying there told her he wasnï¿½t Paul (he really was, after learning that Pat had married Adam, Paul decided itï¿½d be better of if Pat thought he had vanished). The Brewstersï¿½ mariiage was over a few weeks later when Pat discovered Adamï¿½s shady deals. On the rebound, Pat turned to her TV producer, Dick Grant. Pat knew Dick as a cheerful, charming, very outgoing gentleman, however, unbeknownst to Pat, Dick had developed a psychotic crush on her. Sam Vernon discovered Dick had turned his apartment into a photo-covered shrine to Pat and in return Dick kidnapped both ladies, fortunately they were saved by Ed and Vinnie. Pat hired Adamï¿½s former secratery, Gretel Cummings as her assistant at the TV show and got a new boss, Dorian Lord purchased WVLE station.\n\nPatï¿½s identical twin sister, Maggie, came to town and both sisters started dating the same man, Clint Buchanan. Clint chose Pat over Maggie what hurted Maggie. Seeing her sister hurt Pat decided she wonï¿½t continue seeing Clint only Maggie had another idea; Maggie imprisoned her sister and tried to take over her life. When Clint became suspicious, Maggie raced to kill Pat, but Pat killed her instead in self defence. Pat and Clint argued over Maggie's death and broke up. Pat started seeing Clintï¿½s younger brother, Bo, much to Asa's displeasure. While Pat left for Paris to cover the fashion shows there, Bo followed her and they fell in love and became engaged. They also met Nicole Bonnard, who eventually was revealed to be Bo and Clint's mother. When Nicole disappeared (after Asa had kidnapped her back to Llanview), Pat's reporter instincts kicked in and she hired Ed Hall to help her look for her. They found out Nicole was really Olympia Buchanan and that Bo wasnï¿½t Asaï¿½s son (a fact that turned out to be wrong later). Unfortunately after all was revealed, Bo was on another search for his Ralston roots, and he and Pat drifted apart. Besides her TV show Pat also started writing an advice column for The Banner called Lady Love. Pat was also involved in proving Hugo Wilde was really Ivan Kipling. Pat was still in love with Bo when he started seeing Georgina Whitman but finally she found her true love with her old flame, Tony Lord, who was back in town. Pat and Tony were finally wed and they tried to adopt Georginaï¿½s younger brother, Jimmy, after she left town but she was against it. Sadly their happiness was cut short when Tony was declared dead while he was on a dangerous assignment in war-torn Lebanon. Eventually, Pat left town to accept an exciting new job at a Chicago TV station.\n\nMaggie Ashley (1979-1980)\n\nDaughter of Helena and Martin and sister of Pat, Maggie was raised by her father in London while her sister lived with their mother. After their father died she came to Llanview while Pat was in LA and was recognized by Matt McAllister who knew her as a manipulator real estate agent. Matt used Maggie to make Dorian jealous. She met both Adam and Tony and tried to get as much information she could about her twin sister. Matt tried to warn Pat about her sister but she wanted to have a relationship with her. Maggie got a job as Clint's secretary at The Banner and they even dated for a short while, but she was so possessive that he had her transferred. Jealous of her sister's success and Clintï¿½s love for her, Maggie tried to take over her sister's life by imprisoning her. She took Patï¿½s life including Clint and the TV show but when Clint was starting to figure her scheme she tried to kill Pat. She was killed in the struggle. Pat blamed herself for Maggie's death and withdrew into herself. Only Matt was able to get through to her and make her understand how sick Maggie really was.\n\nRoderick Cook\n\nWilton Venere (1983)\n\nAlso known as Tango the mob kingpin; he had a code name Emerald Eyes and a special hideout called Fraser's Peak in the Poconos (which was used by Tommy Lobo). Steve Piermont ended up working for him after Ted Clayton was killed. Tango had put Steve and Tommy Lobo in a film pirating scam and when Steve betrayed him and fell in love with Karen he hired Emil Stubbs to kill him. Under Tangoï¿½s orders Emil and Tommy Lobo took over the Wolek house where Larry beaned Stubbs with a vase, seriously injuring him. After Emil failed Tango killed him and tried to frame Katrina Karr for his murder. Tango also tried to kill Jenny Janssen.\n\nOsgood Star (1983)\n\nThe Duke of Ainsley, and identical twin of the infamous Tango.\n\nThom Christopher\n\nCarlo Hesser (1990-1992; 1996-1997; 1998; 2005)\n\nFather of Johnny Dee and Charlotte and the biggest gangster passing though Llanview, Carlo was adopted as a young child by the Hobart family; his biological mother Wilma gave him up since he was evil to his twin brother Mortimer. Carlo came to town while Viki was the mayor and he started his drug trafficking business along with Michael Grande but Viki decided to put a stop to the drug dealing. Carlo arrived to Badderly to do some business with other mobsters where he met the Fraternity Row crew and other Llanviewers who joined them to the island. After they all returned to Llanview Carlo settled down in town with his two children: Johnny Dee who was involved with Tina Roberts and Charlotte who set her eyes on Jake Harison. Carlo and his son ordered Police Commisioner Harding (who was on their pay role) to take off Mayor Buchanan. Viki was shot and had a stroke leaving her paralized. Meanwhile Tina found out she was preganant but wasnï¿½t sure who the father was Johnny Dee or Cord. When Johnny Dee found out he tried to kidnap Tina from Llanfair, seeing her sister being kidnapped paralized Viki turned into her alter ego Niki Smith, got up from her chair and shot Carloï¿½s only son. Carlo started his revange plans against the Buchanans by kidnapping Sarah and Megan. Although Megan escaped, Sarah was captured and suffered a lengthy imprisonment while her family thought she died in a plane crush. Carlo was also after Tina since he thought she was carrying his grandchild but after she gave birth it tuned outthe child was Cordï¿½s. Jake got close to Carloï¿½s daughter in order to stay close to the family and maybe find something about Sarahï¿½s whereabouts. When Charlotte became blind and Carlo was beginning to suspect him Jake was forced to marry her. After she got well, she realized what Jake was up to and decided to fake her blindness so Jake would stay with her. Jake soon figured out and divorced her while Charlotte left in shame. Carlo dicided to invest in Hunter Guthrieï¿½s movie. He paid his producer, Chad Cummings, to kill Jake for wha he did to his daughter but when Hunter learned Carlo was financing the movi, he sabotaged it and Carloï¿½s plan to get rid of Jake was suspended for now. Carlo later blackmailed Gabrielle Holden with a videotape of her seducing Father Tony Vallone. He forced her to poisen Vikiï¿½s drink which was supposed to make her turn into Niki Smih and kill Megan. Gabby backed out at the last moment and decided to testify against Carlo but Carlo stopped her by threatening her son, Al. Gabby was sent to prison without revealing who was behind her doings fearing for her sonï¿½s safety. Eventually Carlo slipped that drug into Vikiï¿½s drink but Vikiproved to be stronger than Niki and his scheme was failed. Carlo had one great weakness., his love for Renï¿½e Devine whom he knew back in Navada a long time ago. He found out DuAnn was blackmailing Renee and decided to pay her off by sending Julia Media to her. Julia accedentily shot the old woman and tried to run away but Carloï¿½s men tempered with her car and she was left paralized.\n\nCarloï¿½s orphaned niece, Stephanie Hobart, came to live with her uncle and fell in love with none other than Vikiï¿½s son, Kevin. After both families forbided the couplefrom seeing each other they both ran off and took the Buchananï¿½s yacht on a cruise. When Stepanie returned Carlo sent her away out of Llanview. Meanwhile the not so dead Sarah Buchanan found her way back to Llanview with Alex Olanovï¿½s help but had no way to prove Carlo was behind her kidnapping. It turned out that Alexï¿½s agency the FAB strucked a deal with Carlo and in exchange for protection from prosecution, Carlo promised to inform them on worldwide drug-trafficking activities and they kept their mouth shut about Sarah. Alex was sent to jail but she knew some incriminating evidence against Carlo and she made a deal with the DA, Hank Gannon to help put Carlo away. Only Alex was two timing the law when she blackmailed Carlo into marrying her and was now free from testifying against her new husband. Carlo was upset at his new wife at first but soon they began having a hot relationship and there was even some love there. They had a ot of kinky sex and lots of their favorite aphrodisiac, oysters. Carlo was searching for missing diamonds that belonged to him when one day he received a call from his neice Stephanie asking him to go to Max's house. Stephanie told him that Renee and Asa had had a fight and now Renee was hiding there. Carlo's love for Renee caused him to go there but when he arrived Stephanie was waiting with a gun and ï¿½killedï¿½ him. Sarah Buchanan was the main suspect but she started having memories from her captivity where Carlo murdered a man called ï¿½Scarecrowï¿½. The Scarecrow was really Stephanieï¿½s father Joseph and Carloï¿½s brother. He worked for the FBI to incriminate his brother but when Carlo found out he killed him. After Sarah was convicted with Carloï¿½s murder Bo had set up a trap for Stephanie and she revealed the whole truth about her fatherï¿½s death and what she did to revange it. While Carlo was dead, Alex (his widow) found his twin brother Mortimer and together they ruled his mob empire.\n\nLlanview was surprised several years later when a generous benefactor started filling the coffers of many local charities calling himself ï¿½Friend to Llanviewï¿½. It started out with Asa doing business with his british partner Lord Cove (who they called Neptune) and a fellow called Poseidon. They each invested 30 million and Poseidon was leading them all to come to The Palace the day he meant to blew the hotel off. Poseidon was really Carlo who had never really been shot - the bullets in the gun fired by his niece had been blanks and a body had been switched for his at the morgue. Carlo was now the head of an Irish terrorists group called The Men of 21. Carlo made Renee leave the hotel beofre the bombing and stole Asaï¿½s money without showing his face. In he meanwhile Alex who was now married to Asa and the mayor of Llanview became suspicious of her husbandï¿½s dealings and decided she wanted to meet with Poseidon. When they met Carlo drugged Alex and tatooed her hand with a rose without revealing himself. On the day of the atack on The alace Carlo came face to face with his wife at Asaï¿½s and Alex fainted at his sight. Carlo revealed himself to all of Llanview at the Country Club, promising he was a changed man and calling himself now ï¿½Friend to Llanviewï¿½. Asa suffered a heart attack when Carlo returned and after recovering he sent Alex for a divorce from Carlo. Patrick Thornhart set his mind on proving Carlo was Poseidon and the head of The Men of 21 and even went as far of as blowing up Carloï¿½s yacht but his plan failed.\n\nCarlo united forces with RJ Gannon and schemed to get rid of Asa and win Alex back. His first attack was on Buchanan Enterprises causing Asa to have another heart attack from which he awoke with no memory. Carlo had to settle a long-standing score with Viki, who had killed his son so he blackmailed psychiatrist Elliot Durbin into hypnotizing Viki to kill her own son, Kevin. Carlo sought to find a worthy male heir to someday assume his empire. He chose Antonio Vega to fill his shoes who couldnï¿½t escape Carloï¿½s clutches because he desperately needed money to buy back his familyï¿½s diner. Carlo gave Antonio all the money he needed although Tonio never wanted to work for his. Carlo paid Cristianï¿½s college tuition and bought Carlotta the Angel Square Diner. Meanwhile Asa wasnï¿½t as crazy as he acted, he actually had a plan in which he hired Max Holden to help him fool Carlo and make him think he was dying. Their plan succeeded and Carlo was preparing to die soon from Veedon Disease (a rare blood disease). He won Alex back after she couldnï¿½t handle Asa anymore and wanted to have a baby with her before his death (only he didnï¿½t know Alex was sterile). Alex faked her pregnancy with a pillow but Carlo found the truth about his physical state and got back at Max and Maggie by trapping them in a cave in North Carolina. Carloï¿½s world began to shutter down starting with Antonio Vega who began to work for the police undercover while still working for him and Asa coming to his wedding to Alex exposing her fake pregnancy. Even his plan to hurt Viki failed when Viki couldnï¿½t shoot her son and when Dr. Durbin tried to escape Carlo had him shot.\n\nOn Todd and Blairï¿½s charity event on the S.S. Orion Carlo was found dead by Blair. His body was floating in the river with a bullet in his head. Carlo had gained many enemies including: Antonio, Todd, Patrick, Alex, R.J., Andy and Asa. Antonio was trialed for the murder and it turned out more people were there at the time of the shooting; Asa witnessed the whole thing and didnï¿½t say a word, Carloï¿½s twinï¿½s brother, Mortimer was brought in by Bo and told the court he was there too and he saw the shooter, Alex. Mortimer revealed that Carlo planned to frame Antonio for his murder and leave town with him only he was really muredered. Antonio was cleared and Alex got away with it due to a legal technicality. A short time later, Alex received a shock when Carlo\\Mortimer returned from the dead to reclaim her as the love of his life and the two sailed off with Asa's 30 million dollars.\n\nAbout a year later, Dorian was shot when she found herself in the middle of a botched robbery attempt and went into a coma. While in a coma, Dorian paid a visit to hell and was taken on a guided tour by Carlo Hesser. Carlo told Dorian that she would have to convince him to let her go back. Carlo showed Dorian all her misdeeds and fears in hell brought her to her late mother Sonya who wanted her daughter to join them in hell. Thankfully she recovered and Carlo was left in hell, Or was he? When Asa tracked down Alex when he planned to ruin Max, Alex said Carlo dumped her after a while and continued without her.\n\nNine years after his so called death Carlo reappeared when Asa travelled to South America with Renee after he ran from the law for kidnapping Blair Manning. Asa offered Carlo money for killing Blair. Carlo tried to kill Blair but failed, he admitted that Asa had paid him to do it. Meanwhile Carlo had a plan B since he was caught he ordered his men in Argentina to kidnapp Asaï¿½s great grandson Duke and his girlfriend Adriana. Hesser's henchmen held Duke and Adriana. Asa was arrested as soon as he landed in Llanview but he made a deal with Blair to frame Carlo: Blair would say Carlo was behind her kidnapping and Asa would help her locate Margaret. Carlo told Asa about his hostages, and Asa almost called the whole plan off, but Duke and Adriana escaped and Asa tore up his unsigned confession. Carlo was sent to Statesville Prison for the attemp murder and kidnapping of Blair. In jail he met Cristian who began to have memories of his lost year. Cris realized Carlo was the one who programmed him to kill Tico and Antonio (Cris was presumed dead for a year when he was sold to slavery by Flynn Laurence and there he was brainwashed. At the time Crisï¿½s family believed he was still dead and the man in prison was an imposter). Carlo quickly began using his programming on Cristian and Evangeline (who became Crisï¿½s lawyer and friend) pleaded with John to help protect Cristian from Carlo. Carlo bribed a guard to kill Cristian and later burned the painting of Natalie in Crisï¿½s cell. He also gave Cris pills for suicide but fortunately Cris didnï¿½t go that far. Carlo organized some prisoners against the guards and they began a hostage crisis. During the fiasco Cristian was shot by a guard named Haskell who was working for Carlo when he tried to take Carlo hostage. Natalie in the meanwhile learnd from Evangeline that Cris was really alive and came inside the prison while all hell was running loose there. John let himself be taken hostage and then got Carlo to admit what he had done to Cristian while he recorded his confession. Rex warned Natalie before she came in that Haskell was working for Carlo and as a result of his blown cover, Haskell took Natalie to Carlo as a hostage. Carlo had one bullet in his gun and he tortured Natalie with choosing whether John or Cristian would get it. Thankfully, John and Cristian overpowered Carlo before he shot wiher of them and brought the hostage crisis to an end. Carlo was sent to yet more years in prison.\n\nDr. Mortimer Bern (1992-1993; 1997)\n\nSon of Wilma and twin brother of Carlo Hesser, Dr. Mortimer Bern was an Egyptologist. After Carloï¿½s death Alex found Mortimerï¿½s picture in the paper and decided to bring him to Llanview to replace her husband as mob king. He was litetally dragged to Llanview by Alexï¿½s men. Mort stayed for awhile to set up an exhibit at Llanview Museum while Alex did her best to convince him to take Carloï¿½s place. After Mortï¿½s Egyptian jewels were stolen by Alex, broken Mort was beginning to accept Alexï¿½s demands and took voice lessons (by Sir Reginald Burbage), dance lessons (by Ann Reinking) and even sex lessons (by Dr. Ruth Westheimer). Alex also made him to shave his head and taught him how to use a gun (during this lesson he shot Alexï¿½s man, Bulge, foot).\n\nAll of Carloï¿½s nemenies took the bate when they saw the new Mort including his main rival Moose Mulligan who was ready to take over Carloï¿½s empire. Mort was beginning to like this new life, even too much, he began thinking he really was Carlo. He met Carloï¿½s old flame, Renee and sparks immediately flew between the two. After Alex saw them together she realized her plan was getting out of control and called Mortimerï¿½s mother, Wilma. Meanwhile Moose Mulliganï¿½s widow, Bert was planning to kill Mort (thinking he was Carlo) but stopped after she heard what Wilma had to tell. After seeing her son this way, Wilma decided to share a secret she kept for years: Carlo and Mortimer were identical twins! She gave Carlo for adoption after he attacked his twin and kept Mort. Mort got scared realizing Carloï¿½s blood was running through his veins and decided to leave town not before sharing one last tango dance with Renee.\n\nA few years later when Carlo was ï¿½murderedï¿½ the second time Bo brought ï¿½Mortimerï¿½ from Boston as a key witness for the defence. Mort told the court that Carlo had intended to stage his own death and frame Antonio for the crime. Mort revealed the killerï¿½s identity (it was Alex) and Asa witnessing it saying he had been waiting for his brother in a motorboat near the yacht. Only years later we learned Mrotimer was the one killed in that accident and not Carlo and it was all part of his plan.\n\nTy Treadway\n\nDr. Colin MacIver (2000-2001; 2002)\n\nDr. Colin McIver was the estranged husband of Melanie and brother to Troy and Emily. Colin found a badly injured Nora in the aftermath of the train wreck and took her to Cherryvale Clinic. Nora, however, was comatose and Colin didn't know her true identity. One day, a semi-conscious Nora mumbled the name \"Lindsay Rappaport\" and Colin was immediately curious about the connection between his patient, who he had nicknamed Scarlet, and his sister-in-law, Lindsay. Colin called Lindsay to Cherryvale and she was shocked to realize that Nora had survived the accident (while all of Llanview were grieving her death). Lindsay wanted Nora to stay \"dead\" and convinced Colin to go along with her twisted scheme and in return sheï¿½d help him get back with Melanie. To that end, Colin then moved Nora into his own home and continued to care for her there. Colin almost told Bo the truth about Nora being alive but changed his mind after realizing that Bo had slept with Melanie. Lindsay tried to convince Melanie to give Colin another chance, but Melanie ended up signing her divorce papers. Nora offered Colin a deal and said she would represent him and prevent the divorce in exchange for her freedom. While bedridden at Colin's, Nora also caught a glimpse of Lindsay in her room but Colin convinced her that she had seen Melanie instead. Colin kept Nora his prisoner and she began to figure out that Lindsay was also involved in her ordeal.\n\nFugetive Will Rappaport went to Colin's looking for his aunt Melanie where he met Colin. Colin said heï¿½d help Will but he locked him in the basement so he wouldn't find Nora. Colin then gave Lindsay an ultimatum and said he would turn Will in if Lindsay didn't take the rap for kidnapping Nora. Will started hearing a voice while locked in Colin's basement and was then shocked when a note drifted down through the vent. It was a note from Nora and Will realized she was alive!\n\nMeanwhile Sam discovered that Will had called Jessica from Colin's house and he and Todd went to investigate. Sam and Todd didn't find Will, however, as he had been knocked unconscious by Colin while trying to escape. Will managed to knock Colin unconscious and make his way to Nora's room, both Will and Nora were overjoyed to see each other and Will went to call the police. Todd then arrived and claimed the authorities were already on the way. Todd lied and told Will that he had to leave the country to protect himself and Sam already knows that. Todd sent Will to Ireland via a cargo ship but before leaving the country Will left message for Sam that Nora was alive and Colin was keeping her prisoner. Meanwhile, Lindsay had ventured to Nora's room and after a heated argument in which Nora threatened to send Lindsay to prison, Lindsay injected Nora with the memory-erasing drug she gor from RJ (not knowing Nora was her target). Nora then fell into a coma and Colin was furious at Lindsay for what she had done. After getting Will's news about Nora and Colin, Sam, Hank and John went to Colin's to investigate. Colin and Lindsay protested their innocence but even they were shocked to discover that Nora was gone from the house! As it turned out, Todd had taken an unconscious Nora to a convent and placed her in the care of the nuns there. Colin continued to cover his tracks, but Bo and Sam became increasingly suspicious of him. Sam and Bo kept the heat on Colin, who always professed his innocence. When Todd brought Nora to Sam's, Colin seemed to be in the clear as Nora had no memory of her captivity. Sam and Bo, however, weren't about to give up and managed to come up with evidence placing Nora at Colin's house. At that same time, Colin got his hands on the incriminating tape Jessica had made of Asa confessing that he had set Will up. Colin then realized he had a bargaining chip and planned on using it for everything it was worth to keep himself out of prison! Will insisted that Nora seek justice for what Colin had done to her and urged Sam and Bo not to make a deal with Colin. Nora was conflicted herself, but after speaking with Will and learning the details of what had happened to him, Nora convinced Sam, Bo and Hank to cut a deal with Colin. Colin then turned over the tape and the charges against him were dropped.\n\nColin became more obsessed with Nora, who wanted to use him to uncover the truth about Lindsay. Lindsay borrowed money from Sam and Lanie and continued to blackmail Asa in order to pay off Colin, who was growing even more obsessed with Nora. Bo warned Colin to stay away from Nora and Colin then tuned around and threatened to expose Melanie's secret if she didn't get Bo off his back. As it turned out, Melanie had helped her terminally ill father die when she was in medical school. Although clearly an act of mercy, Melanie didn't want Bo to find out what she had done. Colin loved having this secret to hold over Melanie's head and took great delight in torturing her with it. As Colin's obsession with Nora grew, he became convinced that he could make her love him. Although Nora was repulsed by Colin, she did play into his hands in her quest to get evidence to use against Lindsay. Even Nora, however, had no idea of the extent of Colin's obsession as he had now created a secret shrine to Nora in his house. Lindsay tried to warn Colin about Nora's true motives but his arrogance prevented him from believing her.\n\nColin continued his campaign of threats and blackmail and added Roseanne to his list when he learned she was RJ's mole at the police station. Colin also took great delight in torturing Jen and had spent years making her feel responsible for Sam and Lindsay's divorce. Nora's quest to expose Lindsay's role in her kidnapping led her closer to Colin, who promised to tell Nora everything if she made love with him. Nora made it clear she would never love him what sent Colin even more over the edge and his behavior became increasingly dangerous. Lindsay told Max (who was trying to help Nora find the truth) about Colinï¿½s shrine for Nora.\n\nMeanwhile at Colinï¿½s, Nora tried to beep Max for help and then quickly left his house. Roseanne slept with Colin after he blackmailed her. Colin tried to threaten Jessica as well but sh was saved by Cristian in time. Colin told Jen that her mother had an affair with him while she was married to her father what made Jen hate her uncle even more. Nora found Colinï¿½s secret shrine for her and confronted him about it, fortunately Asa came there and saved her from him. Colin was distraught and destroyed his shrine. Med and upset Colin went to bug Roseanne who was saved by Sophia. After seeing Colin RJ threatened to push Colin down an elevator shaft for what he did to Nora and Roseanne. Lindsay had another plan in her mind, to inject Colin with the syringe, and she almost succeeded but Nora walked in and interrupted her.Colin told Will the truth about Lindsay's role in Nora's kidnapping.\n\nColin summoned all his enemies to a \"secrets and lies\" dinner party and announced he was leaving for Maui. Colin also revealed that he was prompted to make the call that ended Sam and Lindsay's marriage after receiving a call from frightened Jen, who had witnessed Lindsay's affair. Later that night, Colin lay in wait for Nora to return home. Colin injected Nora with a mystery drug and planned to abduct her, but was confronted by an unseen visitor. Sam later rescued Nora from Colin's, but Colin was nowhere to be found. Bo began to investigate Colin's disappearance while in the woods, Jessica and Will stumbled upon Colin's body. Jessica reluctantly went along with Will, Jen, and Cristian when they decided to rebury the body and keep quiet about their discovery. Jessica returned to the gravesite to retrieve a charm she lost and was spotted by Bo. Jessica panicked when Bo decided to have the grave dug up, but all the police found was a scarecrow. The foursome wondered what had happened to Colin's body, which was actually in RJ's possession. Bo later found Colin's body during a raid on RJ's warehouse.\n\nThe forensics report proved that Melanie's hair matched the samples found at Colin's house. She confessed to killing Colin. Meanwhile, Will concealed Colin's passport behind a picture in his apartment and Jen admitted to Will that she witnessed something that night at Colin's. In a shocking turn of events, Sam confessed to killing Colin (thinking he was protecting his daughter). Jen took the stand and testified that she saw her parents carrying Colin's body out of the MacIver house the night of the murder. Lindsay and Sam finally realized that Jen didn't kill Colin after thinking all along that they had been helping to cover her guilt. Nora who defended Sam surmised that Lindsay murdered Colin, and Lindsay was subpoenaed to testify. Meanwhile, Nora continued to be haunted by flashes of Colin's laughter. Nora continued remembering things about the night Colin died, and she was haunted by Colin's laughter. Nora and Sam concluded that Colin actually died from a fall down the stairs, and the autopsy report proved that their theory was correct. Believing that their mother killed Colin, Jen, and Will gave Lindsay an ultimatum -- confess to the murder or they would tell the police about her involvement in Nora's kidnapping. On the stand, Lindsay testified to killing Colin as Nora remembered another piece of information about Colin's death -- she saw Roseanne running out of Colin's place the night he was killed. During Lindsay's confession on the stand, Nora struggled to remember more about the murder. Nora realized that Lindsay didn't really kill Colin, and she announced it to the court. Roseanne arrived with Antonio as Nora recalled that Roseanne was present when Colin died. Nora remembered that it was she who had killed Colin and Roseanne corroborated Nora's story.\n\nDr. Troy MacIver (2001-2004)\n\nBrother of Emily and twin brother of Colin, Troy arrived in Llanview after spending years in Africa as a doctor there. Troy came at the reading of his brother's will where Sam Rappaport knocked him out and Lindsay tried to smuggle him with pillows while he was unconscious. Everybody was convinced Troy was really Colin only a fingerprint test proved that Troy was indeed telling the truth. Nora was able to separate Troy from Colin in her mind only after she saved him from falling down the Palace Hotelï¿½s staircase. Troy decided to stick around and head up the free clinic, which he had funded with Colin's money. He moved into Willï¿½s old apartment where he and Sam got into another fight resulting Sam shoving him out the window. Meanwhile Troy began to have feelings for Nora and when Matthew, Nora and Sam's son, was diagnosed with a rare muscle disease, Troy tried a new treatment on it and cured him. Nora was thrilled, and a fragile truce was established between Troy and Sam.\n\nColin was publicly blamed for Nora's memory loss, and Troy became determined to clear Colin's name and prove for once and for all that Lindsay had given Nora the dose. He gave Nora pills to restore her memory, but she was able to remember everything but the crucial moment when Lindsay pricked her with the needle. Troy hatched a plan to pretend to \"fall in love\" with Lindsay, and get her to trust him so she would confess. He tried many tactics, from trying to pry it out of her to giving her a truth-inducing serum. Nora originally objected to Troy's plan, but he convinced her that her need for the truth about the pain Lindsay had caused was far more important than and pain Lindsay herself might feel. Finally, Troy proposed to Lindsay and the two were scheduled to fly off to Paris for their wedding. Troy purchased an old funhouse outside of town, with fake panels and mazes. Pretending to be Colin, he forced Lindsay to come to the funhouse and \"rescue Troy\".Lindsay did not know of the false panels, so Troy was able to go from room to room while it took Lindsay a long time, thus pretending to be Colin, then Troy again. Lindsay confessed, and the confession was taped. Lindsay found out it was a trap and hit Troy over the head with a crowbar, then chained him to a huge wheel. Troy refused to tell her where the tape of her confession was. Later, he was bitten by a Black Widow spider, but was able to recover. Starr Manning wandered into the funhouse, and tried telling people Troy was in there, but no one believed her. She brought Troy food and eventually told Sam where Troy was. An electrical fire had started in the funhouse, and Sam arrived just in time to save Troy. Lindsay and Nora found the tape of Lindsay's confession in Lindsayï¿½s art gallery and fought it out, even ending up in a trash compactor together, but Nora emerged with the tape. Troy and Sam found the two and Lindsay was arrested. Lindsay was sentenced to 28 years in Statesville prison.\n\nAfter Nora admitted she was starting to have feelings for Troy, Sam broke up with her and she and Troy began dating. Noran and Matthew soon moved in with Tory and Matthew really liked him. Troy was tormented by memories of his late wife Joanna what put a strain on his relationship with Nora. Troy's sister Emily came to Llanview and she knew that Troy had suffered through a serious trauma with Joanna in Africa. Emily reassured Troy that what happened to Joanna was not Troy's fault and that he had no way of preventing what befell her. Meanwhile Blair Manning attempted to seduce Troy, but he refused her so she set it up so Nora would think Troy was having affairs at the Lone Pine Motel but Nora didnï¿½t buy it. Meanwhile Lindsay ran out of jail and while driving hit Nora and pushed her over a bridge into the river. Troy located Nora and rescued her just in time but Nora could not recall who hit her and left the scene. Lindsay overheard Troy and Emily discussing Joanna, which led Lindsay to investigate. Lindsay traveled to Africa and uncovered the truth, and began holding it over Troy's head, threatening to tell Nora what he'd done and ruin their relationship. Inspite of their problems Troy proposed to Nora and she gladly accepted. When Troy went to tell Lindsay about his engagement to Nora, Lindsay threatened him again. In an attempt to keep her quiet, he had sex with her. Troy began sleeping with Lindsay to keep her quiet about what happened to Joanna. The affair with Lindsay continued and when Nora discovered their trysts, she ended things with Troy. Backed into a corner, Troy admitted the whole ugly truth to Nora. Troy admitted that Joanna was his wife in Africa, and when her flirtatiousness drove Troy mad with jealousy, he tricked Joanna into thinking she'd slept with Colin (though she'd only really slept with her own husband, Troy). Joanna was so horrified at \"cheating\" on her husband, that she ended up falling off a cliff to her death. Sadly, Nora could have gotten past the truth about Joanna, but could not get past Troy's sleeping with Lindsay. Troy became bent on revenge against Lindsay. Mitch Laurence decided to use Lindsay's unrequited love of Troy MacIver in his advance and gave her a gun sending her to Blairï¿½s home beliving Blair and Troy were together. An unbalanced Lindsay saw a man leaning over Blair's bed, and shot him in the back, only then to see that she'd shot and killed Sam, not Troy.\n\nTroy continued his work at Llanview Hospital thogh he was mentally unstable. Troy diagnosed Flash with a serious illness and ordered her not to sing. Troy wanted to start a relationship with Blair and she told him she couldn't focus on a relationship with him at this point after Samï¿½s death, Troy was crushed. Later on, Gabrielle kissed Troy after having a fight with Bo. Troy continued his revange against Lindsay who was now a patient at St. Anneï¿½s and he switched Lindsay's medication with drugs that made her delusional. Meanwhile Lindsayï¿½s daughter, Jen, kept taping Troy kissing other women. After seeing one of Jenï¿½s tapes, Lindsay escaped. Troy's mental state began to deteriorate rapidly. After sleeping with Lindsay once again, he plotted to keep her quiet by institutionalizing her outside of Llanview under the name of Joanna Farrell, in the hopes that no one would find her. Troy followed up his plan and had Lindsay locked up in a different mental institution. Troy got really upset when he learned about Jenï¿½s tapes. Later, he showed up at Jen's demanding the tape she recorded. When Jen told him where it was, he took her to Lindsay, and locked them together in a room at the insane asylum. Joey and Bo found the two and rescued them. When Llanviewï¿½s Hospital administrator Claire Baxter saw Troy with Lindsay, Troy felt he had no choice but to kill her since she could link him to her. Nora suspected him of killing Claire, and she teamed up with Gabrielle to expose Troy's crime. The plan was that Gabrielle will tape Nora fulling Troy into confessing but Troy took Nora captive and nearly poisoned her in a bizarre suicide pact when he wanted them to die together, by drinking poisoned wine. Nora refused and cut her wrist on the glass attempting to free herself from Troy's grasp. Troy ran out, but later returned and brought Nora to the hospital. Gabrielle told Bo the truth about her involvement with Troy but Troy took his revange on her before he was caught; he knocked her out and put her in the morgue. Later Bo uncovered a barely alive Gabrielle in the morgue. Troy was locked up and sent to prison.\n\nMonths later Gabrielle was shocked when Troy confronted her at a bar. Later, Nora paid a visit to Troy in Statesville and she was stunned to find him waiting for her a few weeks later in the ladies room at the Palace. Nora begged Troy to turn himself in but he refused, and took off. Gabrielle was insecure about her relationship with Bo and she would go to out of town bars, where she had run-ins with Troy, who had apparently been getting overnight passes from Statesville. In the mean while, Bo and Nora worked together as Bo tried to find the Music Box Killer, who had been targeting young women in Llanview. Once Gabrielle admitted that she'd seen Troy, Bo and Nora suspected that Troy had been on the killing spree. Troy showed up at Cristian's gallery and held Lindsay, Jessica and Natalie hostage but fortunately Antonio and John arrived in time to arrest Troy. Rae also suspected that Troy may be the Music Box Killer while in some sort of altered state.Troy was apprehended, but insisted that he wasn't the killer, he was being framed by \"the doctor\" althogh he did confess about killing Gabrielle (which he didnï¿½t). Troy was once again sent back to prison and along with him in the police van was also Todd Manning. Toddï¿½s daughter, Starr had a plan to help her father escape police custody; Starr had Matthew lay down in the road and pretend he was ill, while Starr flagged down the police van carrying her father. As Matthew worked as a sufficient diversion, Starr tried to set her father free. In a shocking turn of events, Troy used the diversion to make his escape, and ended up taking Matthew hostage. Eventually, Matthew was rescued and brought back to Nora. Troy pleaded with Nora to believe that he was not really the \"Music Box Killerï¿½. While John began to wonder if Troy really had been framed, people in jail satrted wondering too if he was really the killer. A dazed Troy agreed with John that he was set up. At first he thought that Colin was the one who got him drugged but as John tried to help him with the recent past events, he realizes that it was someone else, someone special. After much questioning, John was unable to get anywhere with Troy. Troy started to have sessions with Stephen Haver and also with Rae Cummings. Rae started believing in Troy and asked him who tried to frame him. Troy told her about a doctor who took great interest in his lifeand that she knew him, it was Stephen Haver. Later, John and Bo return to Statesville to interrogate Troy, who admits under truth serum how Stephen arranged for him to leave the prison and instructed him to confess to Gabrielle's murder. After Haver was revealed to be the Music Box Killer, Nora visited Troy,apologized to him and arranged for him to go to a minimum-security facility.\n\nUnrelated Look A Likes\n\nAntony Ponzini\n\nVince Wolek (1968-1975; 1987)\n\nWill Be Added Soon\n\nCharlie Smith (1987-1988)\n\nWill Be Added Soon\n\nRobert S.
