        "text": "Planning a wedding is stressful enough! But here at the Wedding Capital of the World, we want to make sure you know how easy it is to get your marriage license and prepare for your big day.\n\nWho Can Get a Marriage License?\n\nBasically, you need to meet the following requirements to obtain a marriage license:\n\nYou must be at least 18 years old.\n\nYou must provide government-issued identification to prove your name and age.\n\nYou must not be currently married.\n\nYou must not be nearer to kin than second cousins or cousins of half-blood.\n\nAre there exceptions to the above list? Only one. If you are a 17-year-old minor and a resident of Clark County, you must obtain a court order from a Nevada District Court Judge. We don’t give legal advice, so please seek the assistance of an attorney if needed.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThere is no waiting period.\n\nYou do not need a blood test.\n\nMarriage records in Nevada are public documents and cannot be made confidential or sealed.\n\nMost countries around the world recognize a marriage in the United States as a legal marriage, but check with your government before you travel here as there are some countries with certain restrictions.\n\nAcceptable Forms of Identification\n\nReady to Apply?\n\nGreat! But before you do, please read carefully the following application tips first:\n\nIf you are a United States citizen and have been issued a Social Security Number, you must provide it.\n\nFor your current Marital Status, selecting \"NEVER MARRIED\" will automatically set the \"Number of this Marriage\" to 1 and disable the rest of this section. If your status is anything else, the \"Number of this Marriage\" value must be the total number of times that you have been previously married (including annulments) plus 1 for this marriage. For example, if you were married once before, you would enter 2.\n\nIf you were divorced, had an annulment, or are widowed and do not know the exact date, enter a date that is closest to your recollection.\n\nWe do not need to see a copy of the divorce decree unless it grants you the ability to use a name that is different from what is on your current valid government issued photo ID.\n\nWe do not need to see a copy of a death certificate if you are widowed.\n\nParents' names must be the full legal name at birth – not the current or married name.\n\nDon’t worry if you make a mistake on your application. Corrections can be made at the Marriage License Bureau or office you visit to obtain your license.\n\nOnce you submit your application, it will stay in our system for one year.\n\nYou both have to be here in-person at the same time to complete the process and obtain your marriage license. If one of you cannot be here in person, you must meet one of the single-party marriage license exceptions.\n\nA marriage license costs $102; you can pay by credit or debit card, but there is an additional fee -- and checks are not accepted.\n\nSingle Party Marriage License Exceptions\n\nUnder special circumstances, a Marriage License may be issued to a couple when only one party can come to the Marriage License Bureau. The instructions and forms for these situations are as follows:\n\nHospitalized Applicant\n\nIncarcerated Applicant"
