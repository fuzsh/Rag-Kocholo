        "text": "From writers and activists to singers and athletes, celebrate International Women’s Day by getting to know 16 women who have changed Catalonia.\n\n1) Caterina Albert/Víctor Català (1869-1966)\n\nCaterina Albert was a Catalan novelist and playwright, born in the northern seaside town of L’Escala, who gained recognition for her novel ‘Solitud’ (Solitude, in English), written under the pseudonym Víctor Català. Published in 1905, the work describes the inner thoughts and struggles of a married woman in search of her own identity, a taboo subject at the time. Albert first came to prominence with her play, ‘La Infanticida,’ about a woman who kills her newborn baby. After the criticism Albert received over the play as a woman, she decided to adopt the pseudonym of Víctor Català, a name she would use for the rest of her life, paying homage to Catalonia with its not-so-subtle reference to a Catalan victory (in Catalan: Victoria Catalana).\n\nIf you like Caterina Albert, check out... Dolors Monserdà\n\n2) Teresa Claramunt (1862 – 1931)\n\nTeresa Claramunt was born into a working-class family and was a factory worker in the industrial city of Sabadell. There, she became active in the women’s anarchist movement and participated in strikes, believing that women should be organized and educated if they were ever to achieve equal rights. With this in mind, in 1891 she co-founded the Autonomous Society of Women in Barcelona, the first anarcho-feminist republican organization in Spain, along with other prominent feminist thinkers such as Ángeles López de Ayala and Amalia Domingo Soler. There, working-class women gathered to learn how to read, write, and discuss political and social issues. She was often arrested and imprisoned for being an anarchist, including during the Montjuïc Trial in 1896. Her work would inspire the creation of the feminist and anti-fascist organization Free Women (Mujeres Libres) in 1936, which had more than 25,000 members during the civil war.\n\nIf you like Teresa Claramunt, check out... Sara Berenguer and Carmen Karr\n\n3) Francesca Bonnemaison (1872-1949)\n\nAnother woman who believed in education as a tool for empowerment was Francesca Bonnemaison. Born in Barcelona, Francesca was the director of what was to become the first free library for women in Europe, the Women’s Popular Library in Barcelona. Although it started modestly with only 100 books, it grew quickly, and had more than 23,000 titles before the Civil War. The library later became a cultural institute, where women could not only learn how to read and write, but also gain knowledge of foreign languages, science, and politics. Later, the library also had an employment office for women, and Bonnemaison founded a women’s swimming club in Badalona. Today, the Women’s Popular Library is a cultural center named after Bonnemaison, located in the Born neighborhood of Barcelona.\n\nIf you like Francesca Bonnemaison, check out... Rosa Sensat\n\n4) Federica Montseny (1905-1994)\n\nBorn in Madrid to anarchist parents, who had fled the Montjuïc trials, Federica Montseny became a prominent anarchist thinker, activist, politician and writer, publishing more than thirty books throughout her life. At the age of 9, she and her family returned to Barcelona, and in her teens she became involved in anarcho-syndicalist activism in the CNT union, which she was a member of her whole life. In 1936, during the Second Spanish Republic, she became Spain’s first female minister, heading the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance, where, among other things, she promoted abortion rights.

Her books, including la ‘Plaça del diamant’ (published as ‘The Time Of The Doves’ in English), have been translated into more than 30 languages. Like many of her contemporaries, she was forced into exile during the dictatorship and spent more than 30 years outside of Catalonia, before returning in 1972. Her 1996 novel ‘El carrer de les camèlies’ (Camellia Street), written during her in exile, is considered one of the best novels about Barcelona ever written.\n\nIf you like Mercè Rodoreda, check out...

She became a key figure in the Catalan LGBT+ movement and participated in the city’s first LGBT demonstration in 1977, led by the Front d’Alliberament Gai, in 1977. Throughout her life, she was arrested more than 50 times, and was imprisoned in Barcelona’s notorious La Model prison. Due to the anti-LGBT law called the Social Danger and Rehabilitation Act during and after the Franco dictatorship, she was sent to conversion therapy in Badajoz and was banned from returning to Catalonia for two years in 1975.

She was a middle-distance runner who was the first woman on the track and field team to represent Spain in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, and a two-time world champion in cross-country running. Despite her success on the field, she retired from sports in 1980, frustrated by the discrimination she faced as a woman in sports and later as a new mother in sport. She never became a professional athlete during her career because women were paid ten times less than men, and instead, worked in a bank from 1977 to 2018.\n\nIf you like Carmen Valero, check out...
