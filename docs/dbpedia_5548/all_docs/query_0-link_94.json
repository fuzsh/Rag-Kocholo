        "text": "AuThor: Michelle Hulme-Lippert emAil: michellehulme-lipper@rmc.edu AffiliATion: Randolph-Macon College; Department of Modern Languages; Haley Hall 10; 114 College Avenue; Ashland VA 23005 AbsTrAcT: This essay examines Pedro Almodóvar’s Volver in light of present-day memory politics in Spain, positing the film to advocate affective confrontations with the past in contrast to Spain’s limited transitional justice politics and 2007 Ley de Memoria Histórica. The protagonist’s cathartic cante jondo gives language to fourteen years of silenced pain and trauma and sets into motion a healing materialization of specters. These dance-like acts of embodiment restore originary mother-daughter relationships and—in accordance with Elaine Scarry’s The Body in Pain—participate in making the world. However, questions arise regarding the sustainability of the film’s graceful, fluid, and complete forms of restitution, particularly when we take into account the returns of rape and patriarchal violence i...\n\nThis project examines the socio-political evolution of Spain as it is reflected in the female characters and filmography of director Pedro Almodóvar. Through primary and secondary research, specifically related to gender and Spanish history, the project investigates through content analysis and representation the hypothetical reflection of such characters with Spain’s development after Franco’s dictatorship. The findings conclude, though not implicitly, that Almodóvar’s feminine universe echoes the reality of the political, social and cultural situation of Spain and suggests that his cinema is key to understanding the evolution of the country following the dictatorial Franco’s regime.\n\nThis article explores the category of memory in relation to the body, sex and religion in the post-Franco transitional years through a queer theoretical framework. Focusing on Pedro Almodóvar's La mala educación (2004) and the Catalan documentary Ocaña, retrat intermitent (1978) by Ventura Pons, this work considers how the role and performance of drag and cross-dressing in both films function as a technology of memory to rethink the body as script and religion as sex. Drawing on queer theoretical frameworks, this article argues that the embodied subject in drag subverts the normative trajectories of memory and, in the context of post-Franco Spain, poses challenges to religion, politics and body, in effect, reimagining the body's relationship to memory to produce a counterhegemonic space. In other words, the desire for memory is the desire for experience, which becomes foregrounded through the affective performance of the queer and transgressive subjects present in both films.\n\nI am particularly interested in the filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar because he began his career in the 1970s during the hegemony of the Auteurist generation, yet he was notably excluded from their efforts to transform the Spanish film industry. Almodóvar tended to embrace melodrama even though it was resented by the Spanish film elite for its association with the Franco era. However, in their own way, Almodóvar’s films from the post-Franco era still worked towards the same two goals of the Auteurist generation - to reject the Franco regime, and to win respect for Spanish cinema from international audiences. Almodóvar thus proved that the dominant style of the new Spanish film elite was not the only means to such ends.\n\nThis article examines the role of audio-visual media in the negotiation and representation of cultural memory in contemporary Spain. The political silencing of one version of history during the Francoist dictatorship and the Transition to democracy sees the country battling with over 70 years of ideological manipulation of history and silencing of personal recollections. This article looks at the way in which the media are playing a significant role in sustaining, renegotiating and remediating memory in the light of the silence that precedes it. It argues that testimony, television and other popular media forms deserve sustained critical attention with regard to the creation of memory in Spain and should not be dismissed as simply vehicles for nostalgia or as spurious recreation of a brutal past but that, in line with work on the dynamics of cultural memory, should be seriously considered as part of attempts to redress the legacy of silence and mobilise a discourse of memory."
