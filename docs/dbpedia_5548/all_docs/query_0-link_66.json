        "meta_description": "The biomedical engineering UPF Congress is an event where cutting-edge techonologies and state-of-the-art Â research projects aimed towards clinical applications are showcased. It constitutes aÂ unique opportunityÂ both for attendants and participants to learn about the latest news and developmentsÂ in the ever-growing field of biomedical engineering.Â The congress will cover mostÂ areasÂ within Â the world of biomedical engineering with ground breaking and comprehensive proposalsÂ based on scientific methodology.Â   Â     The event is organized by our very ownÂ undergraduate students from the biomedical engineering degree here at UPF. The majority of the presentations together with the videos on our youtube channel are created by them. However, the event will also count with the presence of invited speakers who will present a series of keynote talks at the beggining of the event. Finally, leading every single session we will have our Chairmen and Chairwomen who are senior professor here at UPF and external professionals as well.Â   Â      The event's location will be at the auditorium of campus Poblenou on Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona. This modern space is equipped to hold conferences, congresses and cultural acts. Normally, the total space is of 230 square metres and can sit 208 people.   However, due to the COVID - 19 pandemic and its development, the total capacity of the auditoriumÂ is limitedÂ and its use cannot be assured. Alternatively, the event will beÂ fullyÂ held online.Â    Â     The congress will be held from 30/06/2021Â toÂ 02/07/2021, with independent sessions according with the different thesis topics.
