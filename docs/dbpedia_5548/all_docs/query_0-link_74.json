        "text": "Essay written for University of York MA in Conservation Studies (Historic Buildings), 2017. In this essay, I will explore the changing approaches to the analysis and interpretation of ecclesiastical architecture, focusing on the new body of scholarship put forward by Giles and Graves that discusses how we interpret historical ideas of viewing space. I will argue that this approach goes further than traditional scholarship to facilitate an understanding of the function of ecclesiastical structures through those who used it. Furthermore, I will discuss how digital reconstruction can be used to advance these interpretations by providing a historical context in which scholars can experiment with ongoing theories. I will begin my essay with a short chronological overview of the historiography of ecclesiastical architecture before developing my argument for these modern methods through the examination of two in-depth case studies. Throughout this essay I will argue that the modern scholarship put forward by Giles and Graves can show us how the laity interacted with elements of the church and moves us forward in our understanding of the function of these ecclesiastical structures.\n\nSecond International Architecture Summer School in the Roman Forum, Rome, 18-27 June 2021 Often architecture and archaeology are perceived as opposed disciplines, especially in recent years. Every time there is a modern architecture project within an archaeological site, an intense debate arises ending up very often in impeding that project to be built. This opposition is one of the keywords for this symposium which will introduce the works of the second international summer school in the Roman forum. International students (some in presence and some online) guided by numerous tutors, will survey the Horrea Agrippiana and design a temporary socially distanced antiquarium therein for 10 days. The other keyword we proposed is connection. It seems like archaeology, which is indeed a modern discipline is a daughter of architecture as it explores and excavates buildings that some architect designed and built centuries ago. On the other hand architecture is a daughter of archaeology (or to better say of antiquarian studies) as most of the important architects have developed their skills by “seeing with their own eyes and measuring with their own hands the fragments of many ancient buildings”. Raphael, Peruzzi and Palladio, just to name a few within ancient history, but also Schinkel, Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn more recently, developed their projects in strong connection with archaeology. So, who was born first, architecture or archaeology? Should we really consider these disciplines as one against the other? These are some of the research questions that we will try to answer to during the symposium.\n\n| This paper investigates the impact on twentieth-century architecture of some religious teachings related to major non-Christian religions, such as Buddhism, Islam and Judaism. It analyses both the direct impact of these religions, when western interpretations of their religious teachings influenced modernism at a theoretical level, and the indirect impact when religious teachings influenced modernism via historic non-Western architecture, such as Buddhist or Islamic buildings. Twentieth-century theoreticians and architects frequently emphasise rationality, that is to say the functional and technical priorities of modernism. I would suggest that modernism was far less rational than is commonly thought and that it was influenced by different non-Western religions, particularly in its early period. This is by no means a comprehensive survey of all the religious influences that may have left their mark on twentieth-century architecture. I concentrate only on the most marked. This paper considers the religious impact on two main innovations of modernism: firstly, the flat and undecorated façade and the avoidance of traditional façade-discourse (sculpture and decoration), and secondly, the promotion of space as the main object of architecture. The paper attempts a brief analysis of the influence of Islam in reducing/denying the role of material and adopting a spatial approach to architecture; the influence of Buddhism on non-communicating minimalist surfaces and emptiness, the priority of space; and the effect of Judaism in conceptualising space-time, as reinterpreted by Albert Einstein.\n\nOn last decades Architecture gave rise to interesting approaches about new themes. A lot of theses subjects were hardly studied from traditional Archaeology. In this way, for example, architectural remains only were analysed starting from a formalist and typological approach, although its importance as material reflection of social processes. Today the need has been imposed to widen the perspectives of investigation, assimilating new lines which make it possible to maximise the information which comes from te constructed space. This need is justified by questions such as the inconsistency of studying the architectonic record, and overcoming the investigative tradition which even defended the impossibility of dealing with a social and integral interpretation of this record. Despite these conditioning factors, alternative studies and analytical instruments were developed recently in a new field of research, designed Architectural Archaeology. This discipline embrace different methodolgies: Formal analysis or primitive architecture; the study of vertical stratigraphy, particulary used in the studi of Mediaeval sites; the functional and symbolic analysis shich recognises the social factors and symbolic aspects of archietecture; the study of the symbolic use of space with non-verbal communication are all aspects which are dealt with in the study of the architecture of past societies. Therefore, Archeology of Architecture offers new methodologies of analysis for new visions about built record. However, actually it is necessary a theoretical and methodological systematisation which let to carry out a definition of Archaeology of Architecture like a specific work line within Archaeology. This is the main objective of this chapter. ."
