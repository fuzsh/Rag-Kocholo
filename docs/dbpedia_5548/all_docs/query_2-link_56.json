        "text": "The open air museum complex Poble Espanyol\n\nHmm, where should the spain holiday go? To Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia ...? Not so easy to decide. The good news is that you do not need to: in Poble Espanyol you will experience all the diversity of Spain in a single facility. On approximately 50,000 square meters you can expect replicas of characteristic buildings from all parts of the country. This open-air museum is built like an Iberian village with typical houses, small streets, a town hall, schools, shops and restaurants - you will even find a monastery. It is a freat place to stroll around and enjoy the Mediterranean atmosphere.\n\nIn the redesigned arrivals area, visitors can plan their stay in peace with eight large interactive screens, watch videos on Poble Espanyol and learn about the history of the open-air museum. Another multimedia area is about \"feeling\" Spain: thanks to state-of-the-art technology, visitors can immerse themselves in five different regions of the country, see typical landscapes, hear typical noises, smell typical scents... an experience for all the senses!\n\nAnother highlight is the multimedia project \"Fiestas\" - a 150 m2 area, where the most important cultural customs and festivals of the country are presented. More than 180 hours of footage were collected for one year, including shots of the Semana Santa in Andalusia and the Castells, the human towers in Catalonia.\n\nEspecially great for those who are interested in art: in one of the buildings in Poble Espanyol you will find the Museum Fran Daurel with over 300 works by famous artists such as Picasso, Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró. Also a sculpture garden belongs to it. Entrance to the museum is already included in the ticket for the Poble Espanyol.\n\nIf you want to let the many great impressions sink in, you can take a break at the nicely laid out picnic area. Afterwards, it is worthwhile to watch the craftsmen working in one of the 20 traditional factories. They produce unique products every day, including leather goods, jewelery and guitars. The goods and souvenirs can be bought locally - the prices are comparatively cheap. Extra tip: During the summer season, events and concerts often take place in the evenings and on weekends. A calendar can be found on the website of Poble Espanyol.\n\nThe history of Poble Espanyol\n\nThe Poble Espanyol was built for the 1929 World Fair in Barcelona. The blueprints for the village were designed by Puig i Cadafalch - eminent architect and important representative of the Modernisme. The plans were implemented by his students Francesc Folguera and Ramón Reventós. They were assisted by the art critic Miquel Utrillo and the painter Xavier Nogués, who traveled through some 1,600 (!) Villages throughout Spain to make notes and drawings to capture the true essence of Spanish architecture.\n\nAfter the exhibition, the Poble Espanyol should actually be demolished again - but the residents of the open-air museum have become so popular that they successfully prevented the demolition. In times of Franco and the concomitant suppression of Catalan culture, however, the Poble Espanyol declined more and more. Only from the 1990s, it has been repaired and restored again.\n\nSince 2001, the highly recommended Fran Daurel Museum of Contemporary Art has been part of Poble Espanyol. From 2008 to 2018, almost 8 million euros were invested in the modernization of Poble Espanyol. In addition, around 2.3 million euros have been invested in audiovisual technology in recent years. As a result, three new interactive multimedia areas were opened in 2018, providing visitors with the authentic lifestyle of Spain in a modern way.\n\nWhy a visit to Poble Espanyol is worthwhile?\n\nA trip to Poble Espanyol is pure holiday feeling: away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂvisitors can go on a tour of Spain and enjoy a relaxed Mediterranean flair. As you stroll around among the lovingly restored replicas of typical houses from all over Spain, stress and bustle are quickly forgotten.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to watch the craftsmen in their traditional work, for example the glassblowers or instrument makers.\n\nSeveral restaurants provide visitors with delicious local cuisine. Thanks to new multimedia areas, it is also possible to experience the cultural diversity of the country with all your senses. Flamenco shows and changing events in the evenings and at weekends complete the program. The soul of Spain - here you can feel it up close."
