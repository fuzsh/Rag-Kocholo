        "text": "Growing up in Catalonia, women’s football star Alexia Putellas was surrounded by a family of die-hard Barcelona fans.\n\nDespite traveling from their home in Mollet del Valles to Camp Nou often to watch the men's team play, she didn't expect that years later she too would be stepping out onto that pitch captaining a Barcelona side.\n\nFrom her multiple personal accolades to her achievements with club and country, there is no doubt that the attacking midfielder has helped shaped the modern game of women's football.\n\nThink you know the Spanish superstar? Think again.\n\nHere are five things you did not know about Barcelona captain and Spain international, Alexia Putellas.\n\nAlexia Putellas: Idols\n\nThe majority of Putellas’ footballing idols are those from past Barcelona men's teams - most notably Brazil's Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, and fellow Spaniard, Andres Iniesta.\n\nWith such talent going forward, it’s no surprise that the Barcelona Women’s captain has taken inspiration from three of the world’s greatest attacking midfielders.\n\nHowever, Putellas also cites a former Lyon player as one of her main idols. Louisa Nécib spent the majority of her career at Lyon, becoming known as an incredible playmaker for the French club.\n\nSimilar to France’s Nécib, Putellas can play as an attacking midfielder or in a more central role.\n\nThe pair have both received high praise for their vision and passing, as well as their technicality and creativity on the ball.\n\nIt’s thanks to these traits that comparisons have previously been drawn between Nécib and Zinedine Zidane, as well as Putellas and Iniesta.\n\nAlexia Putellas: Before football\n\nDespite being born into a family of culers (Barcelona FC fans), football wasn’t always Putellas’ choice of sport.\n\nGrowing up, she followed in the footsteps of family members and began playing basketball - another popular sport in the Catalan region.\n\nAlongside basketball, Putellas also played tennis and hockey.\n\nIt wasn’t until she started school that she started playing football, and attended football summer camps run by now-Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez.\n\nHer early experiences of team sports led her to joining her first football club at the age of seven.\n\nAlexia Putellas: Starting young\n\nThe 29 year old’s first ever football club was Sabadell - the only youth team in the Barcelona area with a specific women and girls section at the time.\n\nWhen Putellas was seven, she managed to join the club with help from a family friend - despite Sabadell officially only accepting girls from the age of eight. It wasn't long before she was made one of the club’s captains, despite being a lot younger than the majority of her teammates.\n\nIt was here that Putellas’ leadership skills became evident, and the club experienced continuous success under the now Barcelona captain.\n\nHowever, the Sabadell’s girls’ team was not a priority, which led to Putellas leaving the club to spend a year at Barcelona’s academy, La Masia. After being left with no team for her age group at La Masia, she joined Espanyol’s girls team where she went on to make her senior debut at the age of 16.\n\nAlexia Putellas: Delight at the double\n\nAfter an impressive stint with Levante, Alexia Putellas rejoined Barcelona in 2012.\n\nIn her first season with the club, she won her first ever league title after a 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao in front of a bumper crowd.\n\nWhen asked about the most special game of her career in a SPORT interview, it’s this game that she reflects on.\n\n“The game at San Mamés in my first year, my first league. We won in front of 25,000 people, which back then 10 years ago didn't usually happen.”\n\nFollowing the league win, Barcelona went on to win their first ever domestic double - beating Zaragoza 4-0 in the Copa de la Reina final.\n\nPutellas made headlines after scoring her side’s third goal and being named the Copa de la Reina final MVP.\n\n“I remember the first year [at Barcelona], that at 18 I was already a starter and I played practically everything,” she told SPORT.\n\n“We won the double, the following year we repeated... practically every year I have managed to put a title in my personal record and I think that the evolution has been very good. Every time I get closer to the player I want to be and it is clear that this benefits the club. A club that I love very much, so I'm delighted.”\n\nAlexia Putellas: History maker\n\nAs well as making history on the pitch, Putellas is no stranger to breaking barriers off of it.\n\nIn 2021, she became the third ever footballer - and first female player - to receive the prestigious Creu de Sant Jordi, an award to honour services to Catalonia. The two previous footballing recipients were Lionel Messi and Johan Cruyff.\n\nPutellas also became the first ever woman to be projected onto Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. An image of her face was beamed onto the iconic building during the Globe Soccer Awards in 2023.\n\nOn the pitch, Putellas has become known for setting - and shattering - records.\n\nFrom being the first woman to score in a competitive match at Camp Nou, to scoring in the first ever women’s El Clasico against Real Madrid - she also led Barcelona to a record-breaking season in 2021.\n\nThat season the attacking midfielder managed 18 goals in 31 games, and her side picked up 99 points from a possible 102, finishing the season with a +152 goal difference."
