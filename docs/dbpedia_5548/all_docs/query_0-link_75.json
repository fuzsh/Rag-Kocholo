The video lasts for over three hours. Here are some mileposts in the video: Arrival of Pope Francis – 13:15; Appearance of the Ecumenical Patriarch – 24:40; Ecumenical Patriarch greets the Pope – 1:33:00; The Our Father during the liturgy is recited by the Pope in Latin – 1:53:30; Address by Ecumenical Patriarch at the end of the liturgy - 2:20:23; Address by the Pope – 2:36:20; The two embrace – 2:50:00; The blessing by the Pope – 2:51:00; Leaving together – 2:54:00; Signing of joint declaration – 3:17:20.\n\nEcumenical Patriarch’s address (translated in English): http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/11/30/patriarch_bartholomewchristian_martyrdom_makes_unity_urgent/1113037 Here are a few of the passages that caught my attention:\n\nMoreover, You offer to Your Orthodox brothers and sisters the aspiration that during Your tenure the rapprochement of our two great ancient Churches will continue to be established on the solid foundations of our common tradition, which always preserved and acknowledged in the constitution of the Church a primacy of love, honor and service within the framework of collegiality, in order that \"with one mouth and one heart\" we may confess the Trinitarian God and that His love may be poured out upon the world.\n\nIn this Church [of Constantinople], through the order instituted by the holy Ecumenical Councils, divine providence has assigned the responsibility of coordinating and expressing the unanimity of the most holy local Orthodox Churches.\n\nHowever, until that blessed day, the participation in one another's synodal life will be expressed through the involvement of observers, as we observe now, with Your gracious invitation to attend Synods of Your Church, just as we hope will also occur when, with God's grace, our Holy and Great Council becomes reality.\n\nThe modern persecutors of Christians do not ask which Church their victims belong to. The unity that concerns us is regrettably already occurring in certain regions of the world through the blood of martyrdom.\n\nThe Pope’s address (translated into English): http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20141130_divina-liturgia-turchia.html I found especially interesting the following passages:\n\nI believe that it is important to reaffirm respect for this principle as an essential condition, accepted by both, for the restoration of full communion, which does not signify the submission of one to the other, or assimilation. Rather, it means welcoming all the gifts that God has given to each, thus demonstrating to the entire world the great mystery of salvation accomplished by Christ the Lord through the Holy Spirit. I want to assure each one of you here that, to reach the desired goal of full unity, the Catholic Church does not intend to impose any conditions except that of the shared profession of faith.\n\nThe one thing that the Catholic Church desires, and that I seek as Bishop of Rome, “the Church which presides in charity”, is communion with the Orthodox Churches. Such communion will always be the fruit of that love which “has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (cf. Rom 5:5), a fraternal love which expresses the spiritual and transcendent bond which unites us as disciples of the Lord.\n\nThe cry of the victims of conflict urges us to move with haste along the path of reconciliation and communion between Catholics and Orthodox. Indeed, how can we credibly proclaim the Gospel of peace which comes from Christ, if there continues to be rivalry and disagreement between us (cf. Paul VI, Evangelii Nuntiandi, 77)?\n\nThe full text of the Joint Declaration (in English): http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/11/30/pope_francis__patriarch_bartholomew_sign_joint_declaration/1113026\n\nSome of the Pope’s remarks to journalists on the return flight to Rome (translated into English): http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/francesco-turchia-37828/ Some of the more interesting passages:\n\n“Last month, the Metropolitan Hilarion attended the Synod as a delegate and he spoke to me not as a Synod delegate but as the President [actually head of the Moscow Patriarchate’s delegation] of the commission for Orthodox-Catholic dialogue. We spoke for a while. I believe we are moving forward in our relations with Orthodoxy, they have the sacraments and apostolic succession, we are moving forward. If we wait for theologians to reach an agreement, that day will never come! I am sceptical: theologians work well but Athenagoras said: “Let us put theologians on an island to discuss among themselves and we’ll just get on with things!” Unity is a journey we need to go on together, it is spiritual ecumenism, praying together, working together. Then there is ecumenism of the blood: when they kill Christians, bloods mix. Our martyrs are crying out: we are one. This is what ecumenism of the blood is. We must follow this path courageously and carry on moving forward. Perhaps some are not able to understand this. The Eastern catholic Churches have a right to exist, but uniatism is a dated word, another solution needs to be found.”\n\n“I told Patriarch Kirill, we can meet wherever you want, you call me and I’ll come. But he has a lot on his plate at the moment what with the war in Ukraine. Both of us want to meet and move forward. Hilarion suggested the commission hold a study meeting [presumably the planned 2015 meeting of the Commission’s Coordinating Committee] on the primacy issue. We have to continue along the footsteps of John Paul II: help me to find a solution to the primacy issue that is also acceptable to the Orthodox Churches.”\n\n“The thing I feel most deeply about on this path toward unity, I mentioned in yesterday’s homily on the Holy Spirit: the path of the Holy Spirit is the only right path, he is full of surprises, he is creative. The problem – and I as I said in the general congregations before the Conclave this may be self-criticism – is that the Church has the bad and sinful habit of being too inward-looking, as if it believes it shines of its own light. The Church does not have its own light, it needs to look at Jesus Christ. Divisions exist because the Church has been focusing on itself too much. At table today, Bartholomew and I were talking about the moment when a cardinal went to communicate the Pope’s [?] excommunication to the Patriarch: the Church was focusing on itself too much at that moment. When one focuses on oneself, one becomes self-referential.”\n\n“The Orthodox accept the primacy: in today’s litanies they prayed for their pastor and primate, “he who leads the way”. They said this in my presence today. We have to look back at the first millennium to find an acceptable solution. I am not saying the Church did everything wrong (in the second millennium), no, no! It paved its historic path. But now the way forward is to follow John Paul II’s request.\n\n“Allow me to say that this problem [of ultraconservatives who look suspiciously at open approaches] is not only ours. This is also a problem they face, the Orthodox, some monks and some monasteries. For example, ever since the days when the Blessed Paul VI was Pope, there has been an ongoing discussion regarding the date of Easter and we still haven’t reached an agreement. At this rate, our great grandchildren risk celebrating it in August. The Blessed Paul VI had suggested a set date, a Sunday in April. Bartholomew was courageous: in Finland, where there is a small Orthodox community, he said they could celebrate on the same day as the Lutherans. Once, I was in Via della Scrofa, Easter preparations were underway and I heard a member of the Eastern Church say: my Christ will rise from the dead in a month’s time. My Christ, your Christ. Problems do exist. But we must be respectful and not tire of engaging in dialogue, without insulting others, without dirtying ourselves, without gossiping. If someone does not want dialogue, well ... But, patience, meekness and dialogue.”\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nSaturday, November 8, will mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Pro Oriente Foundation. http://www.kathpress.at/site/nachrichten/database/65652.html This Foundation, started by Cardinal Franz König of Vienna on November 4, 1964, during the time of the Second Vatican Council, has done so much to improve relations between the Catholic and the Orthodox and Oriental Churches. Those attending the anniversary celebrations will include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Coptic Orthodox Pope and Patriarch Tawadros II, Cardinal Kurt Koch, and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn.\n\nIn anticipation of this visit by Bartholomew to Austria, the Ecumenical Patriarch has given an interview to Austrian journalists. This interview was summarized in a KAP article published on the Internet today. http://www.kathweb.at/site/nachrichten/database/65654.html With respect to the visit of Pope Francis to the Phanar on November 30, the article stated: “There will be no spectacular gestures during the Pope’s visit. However, according to Bartholomew, the declaration, which will be signed by Pope Francis and Patriarch Bartholomew during the visit to the Phanar, will be an important milestone in the relations between both churches.” With respect to the recent Catholic-Orthodox plenary in Amman, the article stated: He [Bartholomew] expressed disappointment in this regard over the most recent plenary of the International Commission for the official dialogue between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches in the Jordanian capital of Amman. This round of the dialogue in September did not succeed in adopting a common document on fundamental questions of the constitution of the Church. In the discussions it became apparent that in the question of primacy - by that, the role of the Bishop of Rome in the Universal Church – a serious difference of opinion could not be overcome, although all Catholic – and very many Orthodox – delegates were in favor of the text. Bartholomew acknowledged in this regard “inter-Orthodox difficulties.”\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion, in his television program Church and the World, spoke at considerable length concerning his visit to the Vatican in connection with the recent Synod. At this time, his comments are only available in Russian. https://mospat.ru/ru/2014/10/27/news110297/ In his remarks, Metropolitan Hilarion made a statement that I believe is quite significant. The following is a Google translation of that statement:\n\nWe have one more criticism [in addition to the political activities] of the Greek Catholics, which, however, immediately after my speech, the head of the Greek Catholic Church gave the answer. I am satisfied with this answer. The idea is that in recent months the Greek Catholics have repeatedly supported the dissenters, which are separated from the Orthodox Church, have created their own independent church organization, and now, in essence, are fighting against the canonical Church. The head of the Greek Catholic Church has repeatedly been seen with the so-called head of the Kiev Patriarchate, Filaret (Denisenko), who was excommunicated. They even traveled together to America, together visiting the offices of the State Department.\n\nIn our view, such a close association of a Catholic structure - the Greek-Catholic Church - with a schismatic structure is, at least, contrary to the established protocol of decades of interchurch relations. We will not deal with those whom the other party believes are dissenters. On the very next day after my speech, this has been answered by Archbishop Sviatoslav (Shevchuk). He said that the Greek Catholic Church recognizes the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, the only canonical Orthodox structure in Ukraine, and that the interaction occurs with the dissenters within, so to speak, the civil field and the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches, which unites various Ukrainian church organizations.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion is apparently referring to the remarks by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav in his interview by Cardinal Dolan. http://risu.org.ua/en/index/monitoring/society_digest/57951/ Metropolitan Hilarion also stated in this television program, “I think that the dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church must continue….”\n\nThere have been a few more interesting developments. Archpriest Nikolai Danilevich, deputy head of the DECR of the UOC-MP, met on October 22 with Catholic and other journalists from the USA and Europe. He gave an interview which was posted on the official website of the UOC-MP. http://vzcz.church.ua/2014/10/24/zastupnik-golovi-vzcz-upc-zustrivsya-z-zhurnalistami-iz-zaxidnoji-jevropi-ta-ssha/ The following is a Google translation of a quotation from Father Nikolai: \"It may seem strange, but with the Orthodox brothers in the so-called UOC-KP, which departed from us (although they are in schism, but are orthodox, that is close to us), the relationship is now the worst. Relationships with other faiths, which are not so close to us, are fairly good [досить добрі]. As they say, the most brutal war is just between brothers \" Does that mean that the UOC-MP considers its relationship to the UGCC to be “fairly good”? From the lack of anti-UGCC statements on the website of the UOC-MP in recent times, I believe that the answer to this question might well be yes.\n\nOn October 24, Pope Francis met with a delegation of the Orientale Lumen Foundation, headed by Metropolitan Kallistos of Diokleia. http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/10/24/pope_francis_greets_orientale_lumen_foundation_members/1109335 A short video of the Pope’s remarks can be viewed at the foregoing link. A different short video, with more coverage of Metropolitan Kallistos, can be seen at : http://www.romereports.com/pg158848-pope-meets-with-organization-that-builds-bridges-between-catholics-and-orthodox-en\n\nThe annual meeting of the Eastern Catholic hierarchs of Europe was held in Lviv, Ukraine on October 23-26. The meeting occurred at the time of the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the legalization of the UGCC. The full text of the relatively short message adopted by the bishops at the end of their meeting can be read in English at http://www.ccee.eu/pls/ccee/v3_s2ew_consultazione.mostra_pagina?id_pagina=4278&target=3&id_lingua=3 . I was very pleased to see the many positive statements in the message relating to the need for good relations with the Orthodox.\n\nLastly, “a gift of Russian people to the Polish community of Paris” was presented last Saturday. It was a 3.6 meter bronze statue of Pope John Paul II by the famous Russian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli . The statue was placed in the public gardens of the Notre Dame Cathedral. http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=11602 Some very nice photos of the impressive statue can be seen at http://rusoch.fr/lang/fr/cult/v-parizhe-torzhestvenno-otkryli-pamyatnik-ioannu-pavlu-ii-zuraba-cereteli.html .\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nRussian monument to JPII at ND http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=11602\n\nLumen Orientale Video: http://www.romereports.com/pg158848-pope-meets-with-organization-that-builds-bridges-between-catholics-and-orthodox-en\n\nRelations with other churches pretty good http://vzcz.church.ua/2014/10/24/zastupnik-golovi-vzcz-upc-zustrivsya-z-zhurnalistami-iz-zaxidnoji-jevropi-ta-ssha/\n\nCCEE http://www.ccee.eu/pls/ccee/v3_s2ew_consultazione.mostra_pagina?id_pagina=4278&target=3&id_lingua=3\n\nFr. Georgy http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/1410f.html#49\n\nThis morning Metropolitan Hilarion had an one-hour audience with Pope Francis. Yesterday he addressed the Synod which is meeting at the Vatican. Yesterday he also had a meeting with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Personally, I believe that all of this is wonderful. However, I am also impressed by the great length that the Vatican has gone to reach out to the Moscow Patriarchate in this regard. Unlike Patriarch Kirill, who believes that it is not yet appropriate to meet with a pope, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been willing to meet frequently with Pope Francis (and with prior popes), and Francis and Bartholomew have developed a close personal relationship. This can be seen by their joint pilgrimage to the Holy Land in May and by the Ecumenical Patriarch’s participation in the prayer for peace in the Holy Land held in the Vatican gardens on June 8. It is also demonstrated by the Pope’s acceptance of the invitation of the Ecumenical Patriarch to be with him at the Phanar next month for the feast of St. Andrew.\n\nAlthough all of the “fraternal delegates” have been graciously received by the Synod and have been able to participate to a remarkable degree, none was accorded the special attention given in the last two days to Metropolitan Hilarion. Last Friday, the seven fraternal delegates (the eighth fraternal delegate – Metropolitan Hilarion was not present then) were invited to speak to the Synod. To the best of my knowledge, each was given the same limited time to speak as the bishops and other Synod participants. Generally, the time limit for such “interventions” was five minutes after which the microphone was turned off. Although the interventions were completed last week, Metropolitan Hilarion came to Rome and present his intervention to the Synod at the beginning of its session Thursday. It appears that he was not subject to the five-minute rule. In fact his address was almost twice as long as Friday’s address by Metropolitan Athénagoras, the delegate of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Metropolitan Athénagoras had an opportunity to meet Pope Francis briefly, but there was not a separate audience. In contrast, Metropolitan Hilarion had an individual audience with the Pope which lasted approximately one hour. To me, this seems like a long period of time for a papal audience, especially in view of the great demands on the Pope’s time during the period of the Synod. Perhaps this specially favorable treatment to Metropolitan Hilarion is intended to convey to Moscow the message that the Vatican is not “playing favorites” between Constantinople and Moscow and that the Vatican seeks to establish the same excellent relationship with Moscow that it now has with Constantinople.\n\nThe DECR of the Moscow Patriarchate has been extremely prompt in posting English-language articles of Metropolitan Hilarion’s Rome visit on its website. The following article discusses in general terms Metropolitan Hilarion’s address to the Synod on Thursday. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/10/16/news109618/ The photograph on the far left of the article caught by attention. It shows Metropolitan Hilarion greeting a Catholic bishop who appears to be Archbishop Pezzi from Moscow. However, to the immediate right of Metropolitan Hilarion is Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. To the best of my knowledge, Metropolitan Hilarion and Archbishop Sviatoslav have never met before. Did they talk to each other on Thursday? Personally, I hope so.\n\nThe complete English text of Metropolitan Hilarion’s address to the Synod can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/10/16/news109624/ . The address is very positive in terms of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church working together to promote traditional family values. However, as is true of almost all of the recent statements by Metropolitan Hilarion to Catholics, his address contains a strong criticism of the role of the UGCC in the current situation in Ukraine. Late yesterday, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav gave an interview in which he responded to Metropolitan Hilarion’s critical remarks. This was done in a 29-minute interview of the Major Archbishop conducted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York. The complete English-language audio of the interview can be heard at http://risu.org.ua/en/index/monitoring/society_digest/57951/ . The portion relating to Metropolitan Hilarion’s comments yesterday begin at minute 12. I am sure that some will totally agree with the comments by the Cardinal and the Major Archbishop while others will totally disagree. I certainly hope and pray that the very divisive political situation in Ukraine can resolved soon so that ecumenical relations can proceed on a more even course.\n\nA description of Metropolitan Hilarion’s visit with Pope Emeritus Benedict can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/10/16/news109657/ . A very good personal relationship was created between Benedict and Kirill at the time that Metropolitan Kirill was head of the DECR. They had three congenial meetings together. (In a later Seewald interview, Benedict would state: “We immediately got along. He has such a joy about him, such a simple faith – the simplicity of the Russian soul, you might say – but also its determination and warmth. So we understood each other well.”) I am sure that yesterday’s meeting was motivated in part by a desire to convey the greetings of Patriarch Kirill to the Pope Emeritus. Metropolitan Hilarion presented an extraordinarily nice gift to Benedict -- a bust of Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922) specially carved for the Pope Emeritus by the very famous Russian contemporary sculptor Alexander Bourganov. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bourganov ) . I am sure that the Pope Emeritus will treasure this gift.\n\nAn English-language article covering the meeting of Metropolitan Hilarion and his delegation with Cardinal Koch and Father Hycinthe Destivelle OP of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/10/16/news109648/ . Metropolitan Hilarion also gave an interview to Vatican Radio. The English text of this interview can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/10/17/news109671/ . His meeting today with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, is described in Russian at https://mospat.ru/ru/2014/10/17/news109745/ .\n\nAt this moment, the DECR article on Metropolitan Hilarion’s meeting with the Pope is only available in Russian. https://mospat.ru/ru/2014/10/17/news109707/ I am sure that an official English translation will be available shortly. However, in the meantime, I have pasted below a Google translation. I found interesting the remarks by Metropolitan Hilarion relating to the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. With respect to the future study of the issue of synodality and primacy, he indicates that the work of the Commission should be “based on the sources rather than on theological speculation.” The “sources” presumably relate to statements by the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. The elimination of “theological speculation” might possibly refer in part to the theological approach advanced in the dialogue by Metropolitan Ioannis (Zizioulas) of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, who chairs the Orthodox side of the Commission. If so, it again illustrates the intra-Orthodox tensions within the dialogue.\n\nCORRECTION: In my last report, I stated that the AsiaNews interview on the state of the family in Russia was with Archbishop Pezzi from Moscow. This is not correct. Although the introduction of the interview refers to Archbishop Pezzi, anyone one who carefully reads the introduction (which I apparently did not) will see that the person interviewed was actually Fr. Mikhail Nuzkovsky, SDB, who works in Archbishop Pezzi’s diocese and who apparently accompanied the Archbishop to Rome.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nOn October 17, 2014 at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, the Chairman of the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion met with Pope Francis. Metropolitan Hilarion gave the Primate of the Roman Catholic Church greetings from the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill. In turn, the Pope gave to His Holiness Patriarch Kirill his fraternal greetings and good wishes.\n\nMuch attention in the course of the meeting was given to the dramatic situation in Ukraine, where for about a year there has been an ongoing conflict that claimed thousands of lives. Metropolitan Hilarion spoke about the situation in eastern Ukraine, where three priests have been killed and about fifty churches have been completely or partially destroyed. The DECR Chairman shared with the Pontiff his deep concern in connection with the involvement of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the political conflict on the side of the forces hostile to the Russian Orthodox Church, expressing the hope that the Greek Catholics would reconsider their position, abandon unilateral politicized statements and stop supporting the schism.\n\nAnother topic of discussion was the tragic plight of the Christian population in the Middle East. The two sides noted the need for consolidated actions of Churches in the protection of the Christians in the Middle East region. The DECR Chairman briefed the Pope with the initiatives of the Russian Church in this area and thanked the Pope for his peace-making efforts.\n\nDuring the meeting the parties discussed various aspects of Catholic-Orthodox cooperation. Metropolitan Hilarion spoke about the progress and results of the last 15-22 September in Amman (Jordan) XIII Plenary Session of the Joint Commission for Orthodox-Catholic theological dialogue. The DECR chairman noted that the study within the Commission the question of the relationship between synodality and the primacy at the local, regional and universal levels of church government should be based on the sources rather than theological speculation.\n\nAt the end of the meeting the Chairman of the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, shared his impressions of participation in the plenary session of the Synod of Catholic Bishops, noting the relevance of in-depth discussion of issues related to the institution of the family and the need to protect traditional family values. The two sides stressed the importance of cooperation in this field between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.\n\nAfter the meeting, which lasted about an hour and took place in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, Metropolitan Hilarion presented to Pope Francis the members of his delegation: Secretary of Administration of the Moscow Patriarchate’s parishes in Italy, Archbishop Anthony (Sevryuk); DECR secretary for inter-Christian relations, Hieromonk Stephen (Igumnov); a member of the Secretariat for inter-Christian relations, Father Alexis Dikareva; and a student of the all-Church post-graduate and doctoral school of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Hierodeacon Nicholas (Ono).\n\nToday, a preparatory meeting for the 2016 pan-Orthodox Council opened at the Orthodox Center of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Chambesy, Switzerland. The meeting will continue until October 3. This very interesting news was announced today by the website of the Moscow Patriarchate’s DECR. https://mospat.ru/ru/2014/09/30/news108934/ The website’s article is presently only available in Russian, although I expect an official English translation will be posted on the site soon. In the meantime, I have pasted a poor Google translation below.\n\nAs you can see below, Metropolitan Hilarion stressed several points in his opening address today. For example, he states that the 2016 pan-Orthodox Council will not be an Ecumenical Council on the par with the seven Ecumenical Councils of the first millennium. He states that the working document on inter-Christian relations must be reviewed, especially in light of the liberalizing trend of certain Protestant denominations. He also noted the absence of the Orthodox Church of Czech Lands and Slovakia at this week’s meeting. As I reported earlier, Patriarch Kirill and Patriarch Neofit (Bulgaria) signed a joint document on May 30 in Moscow that the consensus principle “implies an obligatory participation of all Local Orthodox Church without any exception in the pre-Council process and at the Council.” https://mospat.ru/en/2014/05/29/news103321/ Apparently, the Moscow Patriarchate has the flexibility to attend this week’s Council meeting without the Czech-Slovak Church present. However, the Moscow – Constantinople dispute over the election of a new primate for that Church, unless resolved, could be a problem later.\n\nA “group photograph” of the delegates to the Amman plenary of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue has been posted by www.amen.gr. I have attached the group photo to this email.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that not all of the delegates were present when this photograph was taken. Also, it is very difficult to see the persons in the back rows. The Ecumenical Patriarchate has now posted the revised communique for the Amman plenary. http://www.ec-patr.org/docdisplay.php?lang=gr&id=1974&tla=gr Most of the very minor corrections in the revision relate to Arabic names. For example, if the name of the King of Jordan is spelled “Abdullah II ibn al-Hussein,” it is the corrected version. Through an inadvertent error, the first version used “Ilbin Abdullah al-Hussein.” There were also several other minor errors that have now been corrected.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nSeptember 30, 2014 in the center of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate in Chambesy near Geneva, has started special-Orthodox Commission for the preparation of a Pan-Orthodox Council. The purpose of this meeting is to edit the previously adopted draft documents of the Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church.\n\nThe decision to convene a special Inter-Commission adopted held March 6-9, 2014 in Istanbul Meeting of the Primates of the Local Orthodox Churches .\n\nWith the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church at this meeting represented by a delegation headed by Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, chairman of the Department for External Church Relations. The delegation also includes Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, DECR vice-chairman, and a member of the DECR Deacon Anatoly Churyakov (as a translator).\n\nAddressing the members of the commission was chaired by Metropolitan John of Pergamon (Ecumenical Patriarchate), Metropolitan Hilarion gave them greetings and good wishes of His Holiness Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, noting that His Holiness \"for many years as chairman of the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, personally participated in the preparation of the Pan-Orthodox Council, and now, as the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, continues to pay personal attention to this important topic inter-Orthodox. \"\n\nStressing that \"the upcoming Council cannot be called the Universal cannot be put on a par with those seven Ecumenical Councils, upon which all of our holy Orthodox faith\", the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church, however, expressed the wish that the Pan-Orthodox Council, preparation which has been going on for over fifty years, has become \"an event that will unite our churches, help clarify the common ground on some issues of our time, on the agenda of the forthcoming Council.\" Therefore, the Russian Orthodox Church \"attaches great importance to the process of its preparation\" and considers it important thing work of the committee, which will review the previously prepared documents, assuming that the need \"not only their editing, but also the introduction of major changes that will make the texts in the present relevant \".\n\nIn particular, when working on documents concerning inter-Christian relations, it is necessary to take full account taken place over the past decade, \"a major change in a number of Protestant churches that are members of the World Council of Churches, many of them on the path of liberalization of doctrine and moral teaching, with many of these communities, we now have almost stopped the dialogue. \"Council documents should clearly indicate that the participation of the Orthodox Christians in the ecumenical organizations \"based on our firm belief that only the Orthodox Church is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church\", - said the Chairman of the Department for External Church Relations.\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion expressed his deep regret at the fact that at the meeting of the Commission not invited representatives of the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, and expressed hope for a revision of the decision of the host, which is indispensable to the proper enforcement of the Meeting of the Primates of the Local Orthodox Churches in Istanbul acceptance all decisions in preparation for the Pan-Orthodox Council on the basis of agreement (consensus) delegations of equal autocephalous Local Churches.\n\nThe work of the Special Commission will continue until October 3.\n\nCatholic World News has posted a story about a speech given by the Vatican’s nuncio to Ukraine to the Catholic charity, Aid to the Church in Need (“Kirche in Not”). http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=22722 As you know, ACN has provided financial aid to both the Catholic and Orthodox Church in Russia and has been praised by the Moscow Patriarchate for this work. The nuncio, Archbishop Thomas Edward Gullickson, has adapted his speech into an article which was posted on the ACN website today. http://www.churchinneed.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=8039&news_iv_ctrl=1481 The title of the article is “Catholic Church in Ukraine is under heavy pressure” and the subtitle is \"The danger of repression of the Greek-Catholic Church exists in whatever part of Ukraine Russia might establish its predominance or continue through acts of terrorism to push forward with its aggression.\" The specific facts relating to the present situation of Catholics in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea are interesting to read. However, what attracted my attention the most was the very negative assessment in the article of Russia’s actions with respect to Ukraine. They are the same type of assertions for which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has been severely criticized by Moscow. However, here they are being made by a Latin-rite archbishop who is an official representative of the Vatican.\n\nPhilippa Hitchen of Vatican Radio has done an excellent 9-minute English-language interview of Cardinal Kurt Koch following his return from Amman. http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/25/cardinal_koch_on_hope_for_closer_catholic-orthodox_relations/1107270 His Eminence provided a number of very interesting insights that were news to me. If you are interested in the dialogue, I consider this a “must hear” interview. Among other things he describes the positive contribution of Metropolitan Hilarion in the Amman plenary.\n\nYesterday, I sent to you the text of the official communique of the Amman plenary of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. I have now received word from Bishop Brian Farrell that a few minor errors (such as correction to names) have been found and a revised communique has now been issued. Therefore, the first version of the communique that I sent you yesterday and is still found on such websites as Vatican Radio and Zenit is not the final version. I have pasted below the final version.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nJOINT INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION\n\nFOR THE THEOLOGICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN\n\nTHE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE ORTHODOX CHURCH\n\n13th PLENARY SESSION\n\nAmman, Jordan, 15-23 September 2014\n\nCOMMUNIQUE\n\nThe thirteenth meeting of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church was held from 15 to 23 September 2014 in Amman, Jordan, a city with a long history related to the roots of Christianity. The meeting was generously and fraternally hosted by His Beatitude Theophilos III, Patriarch of Jerusalem.\n\nTwenty three Catholic members were present, a few were unable to attend. All the Orthodox Churches, with the exception of the Patriarchate of Bulgaria, were represented, namely the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Patriarchate of Alexandria, the Patriarchate of Antioch, the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Patriarchate of Moscow, the Patriarchate of Serbia, the Patriarchate of Romania, the Patriarchate of Georgia, the Church of Cyprus, the Church of Greece, the Church of Poland, the Church of Albania and the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia.\n\nThe Commission worked under the direction of its two co-presidents, Cardinal Kurt Koch and Metropolitan John of Pergamon, assisted by the co-secretaries, Metropolitan Gennadios of Sassima (Ecumenical Patriarchate) and Msgr. Andrea Palmieri (Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity).\n\nAt the opening plenary session held on Wednesday, 17 September in al-Mahktas, the Baptism Site of Jesus Christ, the Commission was warmly welcomed by the host, His Beatitude Patriarch Theophilos III, who emphasized : \"that there can be no genuine dialogue without the presence and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, for it is the Holy Spirit that leads us into all truth (cf. John 16:3)\".\n\nIn response the two co-presidents expressed their thanks for the hospitality offered by the Patriarchate of Jerusalem and underlined the difficult situation in the Middle East and the importance of holding this meeting in Amman, Jordan.\n\nOn Saturday, 20 September, the Catholic members celebrated the Eucharist in the Parish of our Lady of Nazareth presided over by Cardinal Kurt Koch. In his homily he said that \"Christians are already united in many ways and most especially in the martyrdom of our brothers and sisters belonging to different Churches and Ecclesial Communions\". Later a dinner was offered by Archbishop Giorgio Lingua, Apostolic Nuncio in Jordan and Iraq.\n\nOn Sunday, 21 September, the Orthodox members celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the Cathedral of the Entry of Christ to the Temple, of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The celebration was presided over by Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Messinia, in the presence of the Catholic members. In addressing those present, Metropolitan Benedictos of Philadelphia conveyed \"his warm welcome to the Commission members attending the Divine Liturgy in this historical church and asked to pray for a peaceful coexistence of all Christians and religious communities in the suffering region.\" During the afternoon, the members paid a visit to the Church of the Map and Mount Nebo.\n\nOn Monday, 22 September, His Beatitude Patriarch Theophilos III and His Royal Highness Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad joined the Plenary Session of the afternoon. Prince Ghazi conveyed the greetings His Majesty King Abdullah Il ibn al-Hussein of Jordan and expressed his personal and particular interest for the progress of the dialogue. He underlined that any spiritual, intellectual or theological dialogue cannot be interrupted by a crisis. He recalled the recent visit of His Holiness Pope Francis and invited the Joint Commission to meet again in the near future in Jordan. He also extended an invitation to His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to visit Jordan. His Beatitude Patriarch Theophilos as well as the two co-presidents expressed the warm thanks to His Royal Highness Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad who facilitated the organization of this meeting. Later in the evening Patriarch Theophilos III offered an official farewell dinner to the Commission members.\n\nOn the first day of the meeting, as is customary, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox members met separately to coordinate their work. The Orthodox meeting discussed among other things the draft text produced by the Coordinating Committee in 2012, Paris, France, on \"Synodality and Primacy\" as it was mandated by the 12th Joint Commission in Vienna. The Catholic meeting also considered the draft text, seeking specific ways to improve the text, and respond to methodological concerns.\n\nBecause of the many questions raised about the text, the Commission decided to draft a new text which was then discussed and revised in detail. The Commission decided that the text be referred to the next Coordinating Committee for further elaboration and improvement, in view of the next Plenary Session of the Joint Commission.\n\nThe Commission members, being assembled near the holy sites connected with the Baptism of Jesus Christ, raised their voices to express their deep concern for and solidarity with the Christians and members of other religious traditions of this entire region who are being persecuted, displaced and murdered. They totally rejected the idea that such horrifying crimes can be justified in the name of God or of religion. They prayed ardently for these brothers and sisters. They expressed profound gratitude to all those who are engaged in bringing relief to millions of refugees and displaced persons. They expressed thanks in particular to His Majesty King Abdullah Il ibn al-Hussein of Jordan for his exemplary commitment to this task. They prayed for all the Religious Leaders of the region that they may continue to comfort their people and keep alive the vision of their return to their lands and homes, which in recent times have been occupied and often profaned. The Commission implores the international community to listen seriously to these Leaders regarding the most useful ways to intervene and protect those who are being persecuted, and to ensure the continuing vital presence of Christianity in the Middle East. They also renewed the appeal for the liberation of the Metropolitans of Aleppo, Mar Gregorios Yohanna Ibrahim and Boulos Yazigi, and the priests and religious, and all those who have been kidnapped. May God shorten these difficult times and bring peace, justice and reconciliation to the whole region.\n\nTo underline this sense of solidarity with the suffering peoples of the region, on Saturday 20 September, the co-presidents, accompanied by other members of the Commission visited a refugee center in Amman where they experienced first hand the urgent needs of the refugees and listened to the sad stories behind their tragic situation.\n\nThe meeting of the Joint Commission was marked by a spirit of friendship and trustful collaboration. The members greatly appreciated the generous hospitality of the host Church, and they strongly commend the continuing work of the dialogue to the prayers of the faithful.\n\nAmman, Jordan, 22 September 2014\n\nThis morning Metropolitan Onufry was enthroned in Kyiv as Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine. Those who served in the liturgy with him were Metropolitan Hilarion (Moscow Patriarchate), Metropolitan Emmanuel (Ecumenical Patriarchate), and representatives of the churches of Alexandria, Jerusalem, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Poland, Czech Lands and Slovakia, OCA, and ROCOR. http://news.church.ua/2014/08/17/kijiv-vidbulasya-intronizaciya-mitropolita-kijivskogo-i-vsijeji-ukrajini-onufriya/ On the latter site, you can also see photos and videos.\n\nI believe it is a mistake and an over-simplification to categorize the election of Onufry as “pro-Russian.” It is true that the election is a rejection of the idea that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church should unilaterally declare its autocephalous status and complete independence from the Moscow Patriarchate. In my opinion, the Orthodox world already has enough “jurisdictional” disputes without adding such an enormously contentious issue to them. Indeed, from my Catholic perspective, the creation of a separate Local Orthodox Church for each independent nation would create chaos and would move the Orthodox model of ecclesiology even further from the Catholic model.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church already has a great amount of local autonomy. The UOC-MP has in fact already used this autonomy to take different positions than those taken by Moscow. Not surprisingly, many of the recent pronouncements of the UOC-MP have been “pro-Ukrainian.” For example, immediately after the election of Metropolitan Onufry, Metropolitan Onufry and the Presidium of the Council of Bishops of the UOC-MP issued a letter to the faithful of the UOC-MP. http://news.church.ua/2014/08/14/poslannya-soboru-jepiskopiv-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi-do-duxovenstva-chernectva-ta-usix-virnix-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi/ This letter included statements such as the following: “The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is in favor of state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine…. Together we will keep our single unified Ukraine.” Earlier, the UOC-MP joined in similar statements by the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations. From statements such as these, it is very clear that the UOC-MP is taking a position which is directly contrary to the goals of the separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Such statements by the UOC-MP are also inconsistent with the position taken by Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow which maintains a strict neutrality with respect to the goals of the separatists and has never spoken in favor of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nIt is interesting that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which is admittedly “pro-Ukrainian” in its pronouncements, has reacted positively to the election of Metropolitan Onufry. The day after the election, the primate of the UGCC Sviatoslav Shevchuk issued a warm letter of congratulations to Metropolitan Onufry. http://news.ugcc.ua/documents/list_blazhenn%D1%96shogo_svyatoslava_do_mitropolita_onufr%D1%96ya_z_nagodi_yogo_obrannya_na_predstoyatelya_ukrainskoi_pravoslavnoi_tserkvi_71264.html The letter expresses the hope that Metropolitan Onufry will follow his “great” predecessor, Metropolitan Vladimir, to “work for the preservation of peace and the consolidation of Ukrainian society, starting a genuine dialogue and finding ways for unity of all of the heirs of Kyivan Christianity.” A spokesperson of UGCC stated that the UGCC would be represented at the enthronement if invited. http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/?act=news&id=109195\n\nIn a recent report, I have discussed what appears to be differing views of the ROC in Moscow and of the UOC-MP in Kyiv with respect to the UGCC. Unlike the UOC-MP, the ROC in Moscow has been extremely critical of the UGCC with respect to the current Ukrainian situation. On August 14, Patriarch Kirill raised this criticism to one of the highest levels possible – a letter to the primates of all of the Local Orthodox Churches. An English version of Patriarch Kirill’s letter to the Ecumenical Patriarch has now been posted on the DECR website. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/08/14/news106782/ (The UOC-MP has not yet posted the letter or referred to it on its official website, www.orthodox.org.ua.) The letter concludes: “I would like to ask Your Holiness to use every opportunity for raising your voice in defence of Orthodox Christians in the east of Ukraine, who, in a situation of violence on the part of the Greek Catholics and schismatics, live in everyday fear for themselves and their loved ones, in the fear that if the prosecutors take over, the Orthodox will be forced to renounce their faith or subjected to severe discrimination.” In terms of evidentiary facts (places, dates, etc.), the letter refers to only one situation expressly involving the UGCC. This involved improper statements by “Greek Catholic military chaplain” in an Orthodox church in Slavyansk on 17 July 2014. As I previously report, Metropolitan Onufry in his letter to the Ukrainian president on 31 July 2014 objected to certain incidents in Eastern Ukraine (without mentioning the UGCC in any way), but did not include the Slavyansk incident which had occurred two weeks earlier. http://news.church.ua/2014/07/31/misceblyustitel-kijivskoji-mitropolichoji-kafedri-zvernuvsya-do-prezidenta-ukrajini-2/ The UGCC has already issued a denial stating that the Patriarch has been misled by incorrect information and that this military chaplain is a fictitious person. http://ugcc.ua/news/kapelan_ugkts_yakiy_razom_z_ozbroienimi_lyudmi_vrivaietsya_do_hramu_upts__vigadaniy_personazh_71276.html With respect to conflicting contentions relating to the incident on 17 July, I certainly hope that the incident can be subject to an impartial investigation and appropriate action taken. The UGCC has also issued a response to Patriarch Kirill’s letter in its entirety. A good English translation of this response can be read at http://orientale-lumen.blogspot.com/2014/08/ugcc-responds-to-patriarch-kirills.html The response includes the statement: “We strongly condemn all acts of violence against civilians in Ukraine, including its clergy, no matter which denomination, religion or ethnic group they belong to.”\n\nI do believe that the timing of the Patriarch’s letter to the Local Orthodox Churches is interesting. The letter was issued only two days before representatives of the Local Orthodox Churches arrived in Kyiv for the enthronement. Although the UOC-MP has great autonomy, its “foreign relations” with other Local Orthodox Churches are controlled by Moscow. Exercising this power, the Moscow Patriarchate has arguably established the approach to be followed by the UOC-MP with respect to the culpability of the Greek Catholics and schismatics – at least with respect to any communications between the UOC-MP and other Local Orthodox Churches.\n\nCan we not work together, rather than attack each other? Are not the unanimous statements made by the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations on important issues facing Ukraine a model for us?\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nToday, the Synodal Information Department (in Moscow) of the Moscow Patriarchate issued a statement “regarding the death of an Orthodox priest and threats to religious peace in Ukraine.” The statement was immediately posted in English on the website of the Moscow Patriarchate’s DECR. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/08/05/news106653/ What especially caught my attention was the extremely serious accusations made against the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Kyiv Patriarchate. Thus, the statement reads in part:\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian Orthodox churches and clergy not only have been suffering more frequently from the aftermaths of the hostilities, but they also are being subjected to purposeful attacks from the Greek Catholics and schismatics who maliciously take advantage of the civil commotion. Priests are subjected to humiliation, tortures and intimidation, as well as to forcible detention and interrogations. During such interrogations, armed men, belonging to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church or some uncanonical groups and claiming that they are authorized by the Ukrainian authorities, bring absurd accusations to the Ukrainian Orthodox priests and deliver them ultimatums, such as to leave the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and re-register the church property accordingly.\n\nIn his letter to Ukrainian President Petr Poroshenko, Metropolitan Onufry of Chernovtsy and Bukovina, Locum Tenens of the Metropolitan See of Kiev, described some cases of attacks by armed men against clergymen in the territory of the Donetsk diocese, including beatings and threats to inflict bodily harm. For instance, in the Amvrosiivka district some armed men tied up archpriest Yevgeny Podgorny, beat him up with a gunstock comb, stripped him of his priestly cross, shot from their guns above his head, and put him into a pit, threatening to kill his son. Many such reports are coming in from other dioceses of east Ukraine. For example, near Slaviansk some people with submachine guns made archpriest Vadim Yablonovsky dig a grave for himself and that same day handcuffed archpriest Viktor Stratovich, put a bag on his head and brought him to a forest where they made him stand on his knees while they were conducting an interrogation.\n\nWe call the authority structures of Ukraine and competent international human rights watchdogs to immediately initiate an investigation into the abovementioned incidents.\n\nWe are especially alarmed by the attempts of some Greek Catholic clergymen and representatives of schismatic communities to exchange the support of certain radical forces for the right of dictate and violence against parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, steadfast in her peacemaking position. There appear such Greek Catholic and schismatic figures who openly stir up fratricidal hatred, approving violence against civilian population and seeking to initiate persecution of all those, including priests of the canonical Church, who are committed to peace and dialogue.\n\nIt is true that Metropolitan Onufry has issued two recent letters relating to the death of an Orthodox priest and various incidents actions against the UOC-MP in Eastern Ukraine. These are posted in Ukrainian on the official website of the UOC-MP. The following is a Google translation of Metropolitan Onufry’s letter, posted yesterday at http://news.church.ua/2014/08/04/7515/ , concerning the death of the Orthodox (MP) priest:\n\nWith great sadness we received the news of the tragic death on July 31 of this year, the clergyman of your diocese [Lugansk], Archpriest Vladimir Kreslyansky, who was killed by a shrapnel shell while returning home from an evening worship. He is a good shepherd conscientiously fulfilling his priestly duty, not leaving his children without a church service, spiritual solace and guidance in difficult times of war.\n\nI express my sincere hope that our Lord Jesus Christ, the conqueror of the death, repose the soul of the faithful servant and conscientious minister of the altar to the heavenly home with the triumphant assembly and church of the firstborn enrolled in heaven (Hebrews 12:23).\n\nFrom my heart, I ask Almighty God to fortified the hearts of the relatives, friends and spiritual children of the deceased pastor and gave them strength and courage in difficult trial. At the same time, I urge all concerned to show participation in the life of the family of Father Vladimir, who left five children, and help them as much as possible.\n\nThis letter by Metropolitan Onufry does not state who was responsible for the shrapnel shell which killed Father Vladimir and does not assess blame to any specific party for this very tragic event.\n\nThe second letter by Metropolitan Onufry is specifically referenced in the statement of the Synodal Information Department quoted above. The letter may be read in full in Ukrainian at http://news.church.ua/2014/07/31/misceblyustitel-kijivskoji-mitropolichoji-kafedri-zvernuvsya-do-prezidenta-ukrajini-2/ You can use the Google translation tool to read the entire letter in English. This letter was written to the President of Ukrainian at the request of Metropolitan Hilarion of Donetsk. Metropolitan Onufry’s letter describes in great detail three specific situations. Names, locations, and dates are given. The President of Ukraine is asked to intervene and to ensure that such incidents do not reoccur. The letter mentions the ATO Battalion Donbas, but there is no reference in the letter directly or indirectly to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. [For an English translation of an interview with the Battalion Donbas commander, see http://israelforeignaffairs.com/the-donbas-battalion-commander-now-the-separatists-take-as-much-as-we-let-them-take-2/ . The commander states that a majority of the members of the Battalion are volunteers from the Donetsk region.]\n\nMaybe I have missed something, but I have not seen anything on the official website of the UOC-MP which criticizes the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. On the contrary, the UOC-MP has stressed that the Christian dominations in Ukrainian, which includes the UOC-MP, the UOC-KP, and the UGCC, work together and agree on common positions relating to peace. For example, on June 3, Metropolitan Onufry wrote to the President of Ukraine, “By their own example, the heads of confessions that are members of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations, prove the possibility, in spite of all of the differences, to find common ground and work together to express a common position.” http://www.vrciro.org.ua/ua/statements/393-uccro-congratulations-for-elected-president-of-ukraine-poroshenko\n\nI must admit – I am totally confused. I look each day at the official website of the UOC-MP in Kyiv and the official website of the DECR in Moscow. Especially with respect to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, there really seems to be two different approaches in Kyiv and in Moscow. Which of the two is the more accurate representation. There are several different possibilities. It is possible that the UOC-MP, headquartered in Kyiv, is not free to describe the realities with respect to the UGCC as they actually exist. There is also the possibility that the Moscow Patriarchate in Moscow, for whatever reason, is seeking to make the UGCC a scapegoat. Of course, there are other possibilities as well. As a retired attorney, I am inclined to ask for more factual evidence in an effort to ascertain the truth. For example, looking at today’s statement from the Synodal Information Department, there are no facts (names, places, dates) given in the two quoted paragraphs that expressly refer to the UGCC. Can anyone help me with more factual information?\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nEvery year since becoming Patriarch in early 2009, Patriarch Kirill has celebrated the Divine Liturgy at the Monastery of the Caves in Kyiv on the feast day of St. Vladimir, July 28 (July 15 on the Julian calendar). This can be seen from the links below:\n\n2013 https://mospat.ru/en/2013/07/28/news89451/\n\n2012 https://mospat.ru/en/2012/07/28/news68275/\n\n2011 https://mospat.ru/en/2011/07/28/news45665/\n\n2010 https://mospat.ru/en/2010/07/28/news23251/\n\n2009 http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/705559.html\n\nThere has been considerable speculation as to whether Patriarch Kirill will come to Kyiv this year for the July 28 celebration. The Baptism of Rus in 988 through the actions of St. Vladimir is the event which led to the acceptance of Orthodoxy by the peoples now living in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. It is the historic spiritual event that links these people together. The celebration of this event therefore has great symbolic meaning, especially at a time when political events are driving Ukrainians and Russians apart.\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) met today at the Monastery of the Caves in Kyiv. Today would have been a very natural time for the Synod to extend a formal invitation to the Patriarch to attend the celebration on July 28. However, the minutes of today’s meeting does not mention the subject at all. http://news.church.ua/2014/06/19/zhurnali-zasidannya-svyashhennogo-sinodu-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi-vid-19-chervnya-2014-roku/ In contrast, this morning Volodymyr Yushkevych, Director of Religious Affairs and Nationalities Ministry of Culture of Ukraine, did address the subject. He stated:\n\nAs has been reported by various media sources, this Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, under pressure from external forces, may reach a decision to invite the Moscow Patriarch Kirill to Ukraine. Therefore, as the head of the of the state authority responsible for church-state relations, I wish to announce that this visit during ongoing Russian military aggression against Ukraine is undesirable, provocative and designed for political ends.\n\nI assure you that Ukraine will do everything within available law and legislation for this visit not to take place on any territory in Ukraine, including temporarily occupied territories. In my view, such a visit by the head of the Russian Orthodox Church can only provoke a wave of inter-confessional conflict. Therefore, this visit would be possible only after Russia ceases its aggression and returns all the territories it has seized from Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, I want to inform you that Ukraine will not allow politicians to interfere in the internal matters of churches and religious organizations and, without exception, will continue to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of citizens, especially in matters of the freedom of conscience and religion.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to wish the members of the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church productive work and informed and responsible decisions that will benefit the Church and an independent and united Ukraine at this difficult time for the people of Ukraine.\n\nhttp://euromaidanpr.wordpress.com/2014/06/19/moscow-patriarch-not-welcome-in-kyiv-says-culture-ministry/\n\nIn a sense the Holy Synod was on the horns of a dilemma. If it extended a formal invitation, it would find itself on a collision course with the new Ukrainian government. If the Holy Synod decided not to invite the Patriarch, it would be perceived as an insult to the Patriarch. The only viable option was to say nothing at all in the formal deliberations of the Holy Synod.\n\nThis afternoon, Father George Kovalenko, a spokesperson for the UOC-MP, referred to this morning’s statement by Yushkevych. Kovalenko said: \"It's a shame when a public body makes statements, guided by gossip. Unfortunately, such a statement can be regarded as an attempt to pressure and interfere in the internal affairs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.” http://info.church.ua/2014/06/19/rechnik-upc-prokomentuvav-zayavu-departamenta-u-spravax-religij-ta-nacionalnostej/\n\nThere was also some speculation that the celebration could occur this year in Kherson, a city in Southern Ukraine (but not in Crimea) which is also closely associated with St. Vladimir and the Baptism of Rus, rather than in Kyiv. However, it was reported today that the mayor of Kherson has taken the position that the Patriarch would not be welcome. http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/?act=news&id=108226\n\nIn my personal opinion, all of this is very sad.\n\nToday the Holy Synod of the UOC-MP released a letter to the President of Ukraine. It can be read in Ukrainian at http://news.church.ua/2014/06/19/zvernennya-svyashhennogo-sinodu-do-prezidenta-ukrajini-p-o-poroshenka-u-zvyazku-z-ostannimi-podiyami-v-ukrajini/. I believe that it is an important letter. I have pasted a Google translation below. The official English translation of Patriarch Kirill’s latest letter to all of the Russian Orthodox Church on the subject of Ukraine can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/06/17/news104099/\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nToday’s letter from the Holy Synod of the UOC-MP to the President of Ukraine:\n\nDear Peter!\n\nGod judged you to take the post of the President during difficult tests, when every day we hear of bloodshed and death of our compatriots. Putting his hand on the Holy Gospel, you have committed to \"provide for the good of the Fatherland and the welfare of the Ukrainian people, to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens\" (Oath of the President of Ukraine). The Ukrainian Orthodox Church sincerely supports you in your service to the people of Ukraine. We wish you wisdom in making crucial policy decisions.\n\nWe hope that you will guarantee interfaith and inter-religious peace in our country. The peaceful relationship between the churches and religious organizations in Ukraine - is an important property of years of independence. Despite the extremely intense public opposition last month, we were able to keep the peace between religions. All churches and religious organizations in Ukraine have worked together to preserve the peace in the country. Unfortunately, lately we see an attempt to destroy inter-religious understanding in the country. There are cases of attacks and attempts destruction of churches and prayer rooms. In particular, most recently in Kiev was an attempt to set fire to the temple of the Church. We look forward to a professional and impartial investigation of all such incidents. Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Presidency at the time of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations, confirming its fundamental commitment to interfaith peace and condemns any provocations and attempts to make artificial hostility to religious environment.\n\nTo save interfaith peace in the country is necessary to ensure impartial treatment of all religious organizations, and ensure fairness in the media of their activities. We note with regret that recently appeared in the media repeatedly post that significantly distorted the position of the Church on the situation in Ukraine. We regard all this as an attempt to artificially oppose our Church Ukrainian society. These actions of some members of the media threaten a violation of inter-religious peace and should be regarded as extremely destructive. It is therefore important to taking care of the inviolability of external borders of our country, we do not allow loosening of the internal situation in the country by allegations and defamation.\n\nWe once again reiterate: Ukrainian Orthodox Church is in favor of the national independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We strongly condemn any act aimed at undermining national sovereignty and to split a single unified Ukraine.\n\nToday you, as President of our country, are making great efforts to restore peace in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. We know that the vast majority of these areas seeks peace and harmony, to live in a United Ukraine. Not interfering in any way in the processes of decision-making, our church still feels obliged to send you a request to our faithful living in Lugansk and Donetsk regions. The clergy and faithful of these areas are asked to take all possible measures to stop the bloodshed suffered by civilians. Our believers in the East believe that any conflict should be solved through dialogue and negotiations. Peaceful principle solve all our problems professed church. Together we must do everything possible to prevent the death of civilians. Protection of the civilian population - is a top priority for both the Church and the state.\n\nWe lift up fervent prayers to our Lord Jesus Christ, that He sent us His peace and retained Ukraine from discord and strife.\n\nGod Great One! Save us Ukraine!\n\nPope Francis, during his General Audience today, spoke of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. http://www.visnews-en.blogspot.com/2014/05/pope-francis-recalls-his-pilgrimage-to.html I have pasted below an English translation of his remarks concerning his meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The Pope’s moving remarks included the following: “Once more, like my predecessors, I ask forgiveness for what we have done to promote that division, and I pray that the Holy Spirit may help us to heal the wounds we have inflicted on other brethren.”\n\nAlso today Patriarch Kirill in a meeting at the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that \"a very sad shadow\" has been cast on the relations between the Russian Church and the Vatican because \"the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics Church is engaging in direct political activities, unfortunately, using sharp Russophobic slogans and statements and making sharp statements against the Russian Orthodox Church in its public declarations.” http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=11288 The Patriarch added: “We regret that some of the national conferences of Catholic bishops, such as the German, Polish and American, also openly supported this position.” The full text of the Patriarch’s remarks in Russian can be read at https://mospat.ru/ru/2014/05/28/news103231/ .\n\nYesterday, Patriarch Kirill sent a letter to “Pyotr A. Poroshenko, President Elect of Ukraine,” congratulating him on his election. An English translation of the full text of the letter can be read at https://mospat.ru/en/2014/05/27/news103097/ . To the best of my knowledge, the Russian government has not sent a letter of congratulations up to the present time.\n\nPatriarch Kirill also met yesterday with Patriarch Neofit of Bulgaria, who is on a visit to Russia at the invitation of the Moscow Patriarchate. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/05/27/news103134/ In the meeting Patriarch Kirill stated that the results of the election to the European Parliament the other day have shown that many Europeans refuse to accept the liberal philosophy requiring that fundamental ethical values be rejected and challenging the foundations of national self-awareness. In contrast, Cardinal Reinhart Marx of Munich lamented the results of the election. http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=21532\n\nThe Sistine Choir has now completed its concerts in Moscow. As far as I can determine, the concerts were very successful. The first concert was held in the Catholic cathedral in Moscow. The following is a 4-minute video of that performance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9lCjhSXsXw The second concert was with the State Tretyakov Gallery Choir. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/05/27/news103063/ The concert received good media coverage. See http://tvkultura.ru/article/show/article_id/112216 (4-minute video including the choirs singing together). The third concert, held last night, was with the Moscow Synodal Choir. Patriarch Kirill attended the concert which was in honor of the fifth anniversary of his enthronement as patriarch. http://ria.ru/religion/20140528/1009711843.html . The following is a three-minute video relating to this performance. http://tvkultura.ru/article/show/article_id/112267\n\nA conference has been held at the Monastery of Vlatadon in Thessaloniki, Greece, relating to the 50th anniversary of the meeting between Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarchate Athenagoras. At the conference, Metropolitan Chrysostomos of Messinia gave a presentation on the progress and problems in the official Orthodox – Catholic dialogue after the Ravenna document. Metropolitan Chrysostomos is one of two representatives of the Church of Greece on the Joint International Commission. The full text of his presentation (in Greek) was posted today at http://www.amen.gr/article18194 . Using the Google translation tool, it appears that Metropolitan Chrysostomos is a supporter of the Ravenna document.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nToday’s remarks by Pope Francis:\n\n“The main aim of this pilgrimage was to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the historic encounter between Pope Pope VI and the Patriarch Athenagoras. It was the first time that a Successor of Peter visited the Holy Land: Paul VI thus inaugurated, during Vatican Council II, the tradition of papal trips outside Italy during the contemporary era. This prophetic gesture on the part of the bishop of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople constituted a milestone in the arduous but promising path towards unity among all Christians, which has taken important steps since then. Therefore, my encounter with His Holiness Bartholomew, beloved brother in Christ, was the culmination of the visit. We prayed together at the Holy Sepulchre, along with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, and the Armenian Apostolic Patriarch Nourhan, as well as archbishops and bishops from various Churches and Communities, civil authorities and many faithful”.\n\n“In that place, where the proclamation of the Resurrection resounds, we all felt the bitterness and suffering of the divisions that continue to exist between Christ's disciples, and this has really done great harm, harm to the heart. We are still divided; in that place, where the proclamation of the Resurrection resounds, where Jesus gives us life, we are still divided. But above all, in that celebration so rich in mutual brotherhood, esteem and affection, we strongly heard the voice of the Risen Good Shepherd who wishes to bring together all His sheep in one flock; we felt the desire to heal the wounds that are still open and to follow with tenacity the path to full communion”.\n\n“Once more, like my predecessors, I ask forgiveness for what we have done to promote that division, and I pray that the Holy Spirit may help us to heal the wounds we have inflicted on other brethren. We are all brothers in Christ, and with the Patriarch Bartholomew we are friends, brothers; we have shared the desire to walk together, to do what we are able to do today: to pray together, to work together for God's flock, to seek peace and protect creation, the many things that we have in common. We must move forward like brothers”.\n\nYesterday (Sunday), Metropolitan Rastislav was enthroned in the Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Prešov as the new primate of the Orthodox Church of Czech Lands and Slovakia. https://mospat.ru/en/2014/02/10/news98182/ On 5 February, the Greek website, romfea.gr, reported that the Ecumenical Patriarchate would not be sending a delegation to the enthronement. http://www.romfea.gr/epikairotita/22205-persona-non-grata-fanari-tsexias From this, the website concluded that the Ecumenical Patriarch does not recognize the election of Rastislav as primate. At the enthronement, the following Local Orthodox Churches were represented: Moscow Patriarchate, the Patriarchate of Antioch, the Orthodox Church of Poland, and the Orthodox Church in America.\n\nThe Moscow Patriarchate sent three bishops, headed by Metropolitan Hilarion. Interestingly, the Catholic Church in Slovakia sent four bishops, including its top leaders. These bishops were: Metropolitan Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensky of Bratislava -- president of the Bishops Conference of Slovakia; Metropolitan Archbishop Jan Babjak SJ of Presov -- the head of the Slovak Greek Catholic Church; Bishop Milan Chautur CSSR of the Greek Catholic eparchy of Kosice; Bishop Stanislav Stolarik, auxiliary bishop from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kosice. http://www.tkkbs.sk/view.php?cisloclanku=20140203016\n\nAs you recall, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has called for a meeting (synaxis) of all of the primates of the Local Orthodox Churches to be held in Istanbul on 9 March. This will raise the question as to whether Metropolitan Rastislav will be allowed to participate as primate of the Orthodox Church of Czech Lands and Slovakia.\n\nOn a different subject, Metropolitan Anthony of Borispol, who may well be the successor to Metropolitan Volodymyr as head of Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), gave an interesting interview at http://kommersant.ru/doc/2400877 on the current situation in Ukraine. Paul Steeve’s website provides a full English translation of this interview. http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/1402c.html#14 (scroll down to the second interview) I thought that the responses of Metropolitan Anthony were very even-handed. A detailed English biography of Metropolitan Anthony can be read at http://kdais.kiev.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=25&lang=en .\n\nPaul Steeves also provided an English translation of Kommersant’s interview of an Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest, Father Igor Yatsiv, head of the UGCC press service. http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/1402c.html#15 (first interview) The original Russian interview can be read at http://kommersant.ru/doc/2400879 . In the interview, Father Igor made the following comment: “Now on the Web an appeal of one of our priests is being hyped which called for radical actions on Maidan. This video was even mentioned by Vladimir Putin in his speech in Brussels: they say priests in western Ukraine are calling for violence against national minorities. But the truth is that this video was made in 2010. And the truth is that at the time he was punished by his own bishop and he disavowed his statements and asked for forgiveness from those whom he may have offended. Does Vladimir Putin really not know that he was shown an old video? And does he not know that after the recent events our primate along with the chief rabbi of Ukraine issued a condemnation of radical methods of political struggle? The church does not stand on the side of the nationalists. We all are children of God regardless of language, skin color, and so forth, so that radical actions cannot be blessed by the church.“\n\nThe following is what President Putin said in his Brussels news conference on 28 January: “For example, a priest in Western Ukraine was calling on the crowd to go to Kiev and topple the Government so as to – using his own words – “prevent negroes, russkies and yids from telling us what to do in our own home.” First of all, it is astounding to hear this from a religious figure. Second, this is radical nationalism of a kind that is totally unacceptable in the civilised world.” http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/6575 Personally, I wonder if this video was the basis, at least in part, for Metropolitan Hilarion’s television marks a few days later that “Greek Catholic priests in vestments call for killing.” The YouTube video and the Greek Catholic priest are identified at http://www.pravoslavie.ru/news/66578.htm . I just finished looking at the video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWKRchf9Sqo (fortunately only 1,410 views so far). The title of the video is “Uniate priest urges killing.” The priest is indeed in vestments. The quality of the video is terrible. The video was posted by someone in Australia. A full English translation of the priest’s words is found in the second “comment” below the video. In the English translation, you can see the remarks quoted by President Putin.\n\nFinally, the second installment of the interview of Bishop Brian Farrell, secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, has been posted by Vatican Insider. http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/inquiries-and-interviews/detail/articolo/31906/ In the interview, Bishop Farrell has a very positive assessment of the many current contacts between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Catholic Church. However, Bishop Farrell does make the following additional comment: “Our concern is that this kind of practical interaction and collaboration should not take the place of the theological discussions, and that the question of primacy is so difficult and so sensitive for the Russian Orthodox at this time that their presence in the theological dialogue is not as solid as perhaps that of other Orthodox Churches might be.” With respect to the next plenary session of the theological dialogue, you may be wondering why Novi Sad was selected as the venue. I am sure that the reason is that Bishop Irinej of Backa, an Orthodox member of the Commission and one of the most prominent members of the Serbian hierarchy, has invited the Commission to come to his see.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nYesterday (19 January), the daily Italian edition of L’Osservatore Romano published an article by Msgr. Andrea Palmieri, undersecretary of the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity, with the title, “The Theological Dialogue between Catholics and Orthodox – Primacy and Synodality Are Not Mutually Exclusive.” I believe that this is an important article. I have attached the Italian text as a Word document. I have pasted a Google English translation below. Hopefully, there are not too many translation mistakes, but there may be some.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nThe theological dialogue between Catholics and Orthodox\n\nPrimacy and collegiality are not mutually exclusive\n\nBy Andrea Palmieri\n\nIt's been almost four years since the last plenary session of the International Joint Commission, which took place in Vienna in September 2010, but, despite this long interval, one cannot say that the theological dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church has stopped.\n\nThese years, in fact, have been devoted to the preparation of a draft document to be submitted to the study of members of the Commission at its next plenary, that, according to the agreement of the two co-presidents, Cardinal Kurt Koch, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity, and Metropolitan Ioannis Zizioulas, will be held in September in Novi Sad in Serbia. The draft document has been developed through a long process of drafting, which included a first meeting of a Drafting Group in June 2011 in Crete and then the two meetings of the Coordinating Committee of the Commission in November 2011 in Rome and in November 2012 in Paris .\n\nThe document, the text of which is under embargo until the Commission decides on its eventual publication, is dedicated to the relationship between theological and ecclesiological primacy and synodality in the Church at the local, regional and universal levels.\n\nThe preparation of the document was quite complex, since there remains some difference of approach to the issue in question not only between Catholics and Orthodox, but also within the delegations. For this reason, it is particularly difficult to predict what will be the outcome of the upcoming plenary, which will be called upon to assess the draft document. For the continuation of the path taken, it is essential that each participant does not demand at this stage of the dialogue that the contents of the new document correspond in a precise and comprehensive way to the formulation of the doctrine of their church, but be aware that it should rather express, with innovative language that does not betray the deposit of faith, the consensus that up to now can possibly be achieved on the issue in question.\n\nThe reflection together, in truth and charity, on these issues starting from what we have in common and not hiding what still separates us, represents already an important step in a process not yet come to an end. The documents of the International Joint Commission, in fact, by their nature, are not theological treatises in which is expressed the doctrine in its systematic entirety. These documents do not claim to present new magisterial positions, but simply represent the result of the work of the Commission that is offered for the reflection of the Churches of origin as an aid in the journey towards the restoration of full communion. It will be the competent authority of each Church, and not just the Theological Commission, to judge when, once having overcome all of the divisions, this journey, with the help of God who is the true and only source of unity, will be finally concluded.\n\nIn this perspective, therefore, confronting the delicate question of the relationship between primacy and synodality in the life of the Church is not a doctrinal compromise between the strongest aspects of both Churches, that is the synodal tradition of the Orthodox Church and the strength of primacy of the Catholic Church, but rather seeks to show how these fundamental questions relating to the nature of the Church are not mutually exclusive, but rather they presuppose each other. Thus, the theological dialogue ceases to be purely theoretical and enables Christians of the East and the West to get to know each other's traditions in order to understand, and sometimes also to learn from them, while remaining faithful to the fundamental principle of ecumenical dialogue, which consists in a mutual exchange of gifts.\n\nOn the one hand, the Catholic Church will have to admit that it has not yet developed in its life and its ecclesial structures that level of synodality that would be possible and necessary from a historical and theological point of view and that the strengthening of synodality represents an ecumenical contribution most important for Catholic Church to the recognition of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. On the other hand, one can await to reason by the Orthodox Church recognition of the fact that primacy even at the level of the universal Church is not only possible and theologically legitimate, but is necessary, and that this is not absolutely contrary to Orthodox ecclesiology, but is compatible with it.\n\nA significant support for dialogue between Catholics and Orthodox came from Pope Francis, who in the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium characteristically said : \"In dialogue with our Orthodox brethren , we Catholics have the chance to learn more about the meaning of episcopal collegiality and on their experience of collegiality. Through an exchange of gifts, the Spirit can lead us ever closer to the truth and goodness \" (n. 246). A similar idea was expressed by Pope Francis 's interview with Father Antonio Spadaro , the editor of “La Civiltà Cattolica,\" where the Bishop of Rome confided to want to \"learn\" from the Orthodox \"about the meaning of episcopal collegiality and tradition of collegiality.\" The shared reflection on how they governed the Church in the early centuries - continued Pope Francis - \"will bear fruit in due time.\" Meanwhile , in ecumenical relations, it is important \"not only know each other better, but also to recognize that the Spirit has sown in the other as a gift for us. Walking together in the differences . There is no other way to unite. This is the way of Jesus.\"\n\nIt is easy to understand that as you get closer to the crucial question of the exercise of primacy in the universal Church, which throughout history has been one of the major points of disagreement between Orthodox and Catholics, the dialogue is made more complex and progress becomes slower . However, even if the path can seem even longer, it must be recognized that dialogue is already bringing important results, among which the main one is certainly that of a renewed sense of brotherhood and effective collaboration.\n\nThe presence of delegations from almost all of the Orthodox Churches, and especially the historical personal participation of the Ecumenical Patriarch, at the solemn inauguration of the pontificate of Pope Francis on March 19 , as well as visits to the Pope of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Yuhanna X, on September 27, and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, Theodore I, on September 30, are a clear sign of the journey already accomplished.\n\nIn this direction, there were also the intensive contacts with the Orthodox Churches by the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, Cardinal Koch and his collaborators, among which may be mentioned the visits of the Cardinal in Romania and in Moscow, where he had the opportunity to meet with Patriarch Daniel and Patriarch Kirill respectively.\n\nAnother significant example of good relationships that have developed in recent years is the collaboration between the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Apostoliki Diakonia of Chiesadi, Greece for cultural training projects aimed at increasing mutual knowledge, which in 2013 were increased further. The Apostoloki Diakonia, in fact, not only arranged for the ninth consecutive year, a summer program for the study of the Greek language and knowledge of Orthodox culture for Catholic students, but, from the year just ended, has also decided to fund a new Greek language course at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome.\n\nThe many meetings held and the positive experiences of collaboration show how to open more roads towards full communion, in legitimate diversity of local churches. Along this path, do not get discouraged because of the difficulties encountered, but, on the contrary, remain rooted in Christ, \"the shepherd and bishop of our souls\" (1 Peter 2: 25), our hearts warming as happened for the disciples of Emmaus, keeping very alive the hope that the Lord’s will be done, \"that all may be one\" (Jn 17, 21).\n\nI apologize for sending two messages to you on one day – and on Christmas Day (o.s). However, an Orthodox friend of mine has just sent to me a very interesting challenge by Metropolitan Elpidophoros Lambriniadis to the position statement on universal primacy issued by the Moscow Patriarchate’s Holy Synod at its 25-26 December session. See https://mospat.ru/en/2013/12/26/news96344/ I have pasted the full text of Metropolitan Elpidophoros’ response below. For many years Archimandrite Elpidophoros Lambriniadis was the chief secretary to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Interestingly, he is also a good friend of Metropolitan Hilarion. In 2011 Metropolitan Hilarion made a special trip to Istanbul to attend the episcopal ordination of Archimandrite Elpidophoros. https://mospat.ru/en/2011/03/21/news38294/ I think that it is fairly clear that the views of Metropolitan Elpidophoros are not simply his personal views, but also those of the Ecumenical Patriarch. Obviously, Constantinople and Moscow have very different views on primacy.\n\nPeter Anderson, Seattle USA\n\nA Response to the Text on Primacy of the Moscow Patriarchate\n\nElpidophoros Lambriniadis\n\nMetropolitan of Bursa\n\nProfessor of Theology, University of Thessaloniki\n\nIn a recent synodal decision,[1] the Church of Russia seems once again[2] to choose its isolation both from theological dialogue with the Catholic Church and from the communion of the Orthodox Churches. Two points are worth noting from the outset, which are indicative of the intent of the Church of Russia’s Synod:\n\nFirst, its desire to thwart the text of Ravenna,[3] claiming seemingly theological reasons to justify the absence of its delegation from the specific plenary meeting of the bilateral commission (an absence dictated, as everyone knows, by other reasons[4]); and\n\nSecond, to challenge in the most open and formal manner (namely, by synodal decree) the primacy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate within the Orthodox world, observing that the text of Ravenna, on which all the Orthodox Churches agreed (with the exception, of course, of the Church of Russia), determines the primacy of the bishop on the three levels of ecclesiological structure in the Church (local, provincial, universal) in a way that supports and ensures the primacy and first-throne Orthodox Church.\n\nThe text of the position of the Moscow Patriarchate on the “problem” (as they call it) of Primacy in the universal Church does not deny either the sense or the significance of primacy; and up to this point, it is correct. In addition, however, it endeavors to achieve (indeed, as we shall see, in an indirect way) the introduction of two distinctions related to the concept of primacy.\n\n1. Separation between ecclesiological and theological primacy\n\nThe first differentiation contrasts primacy as it applies to the life of the Church (ecclesiology) and as understood in theology. Thus the text of the Moscow Patriarchate is forced to adopt the novel distinction between on the one hand the ‘primary’ primacy of the Lord and on the other hand the ‘secondary’ primacies [\"various forms of primacy ... are secondary\"] of bishops, although later in the same text it will be suggested that the bishop is the image of Christ [cf 2:1], which seems to imply that the two primacies identical or at least comparable, if not simply identified. Even the scholastic formulation of such distinctions between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ primacies demonstrates the stealthy contradiction.\n\nMoreover, the desired separation of ecclesiology from theology (or Christology) would have destructive consequences for both. If the Church is indeed the Body of Christ and the revelation of the Trinitarian life, then we cannot talk about differences and artificial distinctions that shatter the unity of the mystery of the Church, which encapsulates the theological (in the narrow sense of the word) and Christological formulations alike. Otherwise, church life is severed from theology and is reduced to a dry administrative institution, while on the other hand a theology without repercussions in the life and structure of the Church becomes a sterile academic preoccupation. According to Metropolitan John of Pergamon: “The separation of the administrative institutions of the Church from dogma is not simply unfortunate; it is even dangerous.”[5]\n\n2. The separation of the different ecclesiological levels\n\nThe second differentiation which in our opinion is attempted by the text of the Moscow Patriarchate pertains to the three ecclesiological levels in the structure of the Church. It is here, it seems, that the entire weight of that text hangs. The text states that the primacy of the local diocese is understood and institutionalized in one way, while on the provincial level of an autocephalous archdiocese it is understood in another, and on the level of the universal church in yet another way (cf. 3: “Due to the fact that the nature of primacy, which exists at various levels of church order (diocesan, local and universal) vary, the functions of the primus on various levels are not identical and cannot be transferred from one level to another”).\n\nAs the Synodal decision claims, not only do these three primacies differ, but even their sources are different: the primacy of the local bishop stems from the apostolic succession (2:1), the primacy of the head of an autocephalous Church from his election by the synod (2:2), and the primacy of the head of the universal church from the rank attributed to him by the diptychs (3:3). Thus, as the text of the Moscow Patriarchate concludes, these three levels and their corresponding primacies cannot be compared among themselves, as done by the text of Ravenna on the basis of the 34th Apostolic canon.\n\nWhat is clearly apparent here is the agonizing effort in the present Synodal decision to render primacy as something external and therefore foreign to the person of the first-hierarch. This is what we consider to be the reason why the position of the Moscow Patriarchate insists so greatly on determining the sources of primacy, which always differ from the person of the first-hierarch, in such a way that the first-hierarch is therecipient, rather than the source of his primacy. Does perhaps this dependence also imply independence for the primacy? For the Church, an institution is always hypostasized in a person. We can never encounter an impersonal institution, as the primacy might be perceived without a first-hierarch. It should be clarified here that the primacy of the first-hierarch is also hypostasized by the specific place, the local Church, the geographical region over which as first-hierarch he presides.[6] It is important at this point to observe the following logical and theological contradictions:\n\n(i) If the First-Hierarch is a recipient of (his) primacy, then primacy exists without and regardless of the First, which is impossible. This appears very clearly in the reasons proffered for the primacy on the provincial and ecumenical levels. For the provincial level, the source of the primacy is considered to be the provincial synod; but can there be a synod without a First-Hierarch? The dialectical relationship between the First-Hierarch and the synod, as formulated by the 34th canon of the Apostles (as well as the 9th and 16th canons of Antioch, according to which a synod without a first-hierarch is considered incomplete), is abrogated for the sake of a unilateral relationship where the many comprise the First, contradicting all reason that recognizes the First both as the constitutive factor and guarantor of the unity of the many.[7] A second example of logical contradiction is presented by the Diptychs. Here the symptom is perceived as the cause and the signified mistaken as the sign. The Diptychs are not the source of primacy on the interprovincial level but rather its expression – indeed, only one of its expressions. Of themselves, the Diptychs are an expression of the order and hierarchy of the autocephalous churches, but such a hierarchy requires the First-Hierarch (and then a second, a third, and so on); they cannot in some retrospective way institutionalize the primacy on which they are based.\n\nIn order to understand these innovations more clearly, let us look for a moment at what all this would mean if we related and applied them to the life of the Holy Trinity, the true source of all primacy (“Thus says God, the king of Israel, the God of Sabaoth who delivered him; I am the first” Is. 44:6).[8]\n\nThe Church has always and systematically understood the person of the Father as the First (“the monarchy of the Father”)[9] in the communion of persons of the Holy Trinity. If we were to follow the logic of the text of the Russian Synod, we would also have to claim that God the Father is not Himself the cause without beginning of the divinity and fatherhood (“For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.” Eph. 3.14-15), but becomes a recipient of his own “primacy.” Whence? From the other Persons of the Holy Trinity? Yet how can we suppose this without invalidating the order of theology, as St. Gregory the Theologian writes, or, even worse, without overturning – perhaps we should say “confusing” – the relations of the Persons of the Holy Trinity? Is it possible for the Son or the Holy Spirit to “precede” the Father?\n\n(ii) When the text of the Synod in Russia refuses to accept an “ecumenical prelate” (“universal hierarch”) under the pretext that the universality of such a hierarch “eliminates the sacramental equality of bishops” (3:3) it is merely formulating a sophistry. As to their priesthood, of course, all bishops are equal, but they neither are nor can be equal as bishops of specific cities. The sacred canons (like the 3rd canon of the Second Ecumenical Council, the 24th of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, and the 36th of the Quinisext Council) rank the cities, attributing to some the status of a Metropolitanate and to others the status of a Patriarchate. Among the latter, the further attribute to one primatial responsibility, to another secondary responsibility, and so on. Not all local Churches are equal, whether in order or in rank. Moreover, to the extent that a bishop is never a bishop without specific assignment but rather the presiding bishop of a local Church – that is to say, he is always the bishop of a specific city (which is an inseparable feature and condition of the episcopal ordination) – then bishops too are accordingly ranked (that is to say, there is a particular rank attributed to a Metropolitanate and another to a Patriarchate; a particular rank is attributed to the ancient Patriarchates, as endorsed by the Ecumenical Councils, and another attributed to the modern Patriarchates). Thus, within such an order of rank, it is inconceivable for there not to be a first-hierarch.[10] On the contrary, in recent times, we observe the application of a novel primacy, namely a primacy of numbers, which those who today invoke the canonical universal primacy of the Mother Church dogmatize about a rank that is untestified in Church tradition, but rather based on the principle ubi russicus ibi ecclesia russicae, that is to say “wherever there is a Russian, there too the jurisdiction of the Russian Church extends.”\n\nIn the long history of the Church, the first-hierarch was the bishop of Rome. After Eucharistic communion with Rome was broken, canonically the first-hierarch of the Orthodox Church is the archbishop of Constantinople. In the case of the archbishop of Constantinople, we observe the unique coincidence of all three levels of primacy, namely the local (as Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome), the regional (as Patriarch), and the universal or worldwide (as Ecumenical Patriarch). This threefold primacy translates into specific privileges, such as the right of appeal and the right to grant or remove autocephaly (for example, the Archdioceses-Patriarchates of Ochrid, Pec and Turnavo, etc.), a privilege that the Ecumenical Patriarch exercised even in decisions not validated by decisions of the Ecumenical Councils, as in the case of modern Patriarchates, the first of which is that of Moscow.\n\nThe primacy of the archbishop of Constantinople has nothing to do with the diptychs, which, as we have already said, merely express this hierarchical ranking (which, again in contradictory terms the text of the Moscow Patri"
