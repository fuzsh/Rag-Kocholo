        "text": "By Daniel Infante Tuaño\n\nSPAIN – Pampanga is considered the Philippines’ Christmas lantern capital, as it produces the country’s most beautiful and colorful parols.\n\nThe symbol of Filipino Christmas is displayed in the homes of Filipino residents in Barcelona for quite some time, but for the first time Cabalens, they brought their creativity and craftsmanship to Spain as they made their first-ever parol.\n\n“Ito ‘yung produkto ng Pampanga kaya kailangang ipresenta namin ‘yung maganda naming parol,” said Ramina Espinosa, president of newly formed Pampangueño association Kapampangan Abe Abe Tamu.\n\nThe giant parol, which resembles the Philippine flag, is made of gift wrapper, wooden sticks, paper and battery-powered Christmas lights.\n\nIn the future, they promised to bring materials from the Philippines so they can make parols like the ones found in Pampanga which are mainly made of capiz shells.\n\nIt took two weeks for Apalit, Pampanga-native Jerry Santos to finish the parol.\n\n“Kailangan meron dating, parang tayong mga Filipino makita rin nila na may talent din tayo, hindi yung puros pinagpapasensiyahan lang, mabilisan, hindi ganun,” Santos said.\n\nThe parol was offered to the Filipino Personal Parish and is now on display, together with other parols made by Filipino associations, at Iglesia de San Agustin in Barcelona. ABS-CBNnews.com\n\nBy Daniel Infante Tuaño\n\nSPAIN – A Sunday mass was celebrated in Antoni Gaudi’s world-renowned basilica, Sagrada Familia, in honor of the victims of super typhoon Yolanda.\n\nThe mass, usually attended by more than 4,000 faithful, was officiated by the Archbishop of Barcelona Cardinal Lluis Martinez Sistach.\n\nCardinal Sistach offered prayers and expressed his sympathies to families and friends of the victims of the tragedy.\n\nHe also said that the collections in the mass, which coincided with the closing of the Year of Faith, would be donated to the victims.\n\nOn the website of the Archbishop of Barcelona, he urged everyone to help the Philippines.\n\n“We have to help the Philippines in cash donations or in prayers due to the serious consequences of the typhoon. My condolences, prayers and support to the Filipino people,” Cardinal Sistach said in Spanish and Catalan.\n\nPinoy Church Iglesia de San Agustin\n\nThe day before, Cardinal Sistach also officiated another mass in the Filipino Personal Parish Barcelona, Inmaculada Concepción y San Lorenzo Ruiz or popularly known as Iglesia de San Agustin.\n\nCardinal Sistach also offered prayers and expressed his condolences. He reminded the gift of faith the Filipinos have amidst the calamities that have struck the country.\n\nThe Saturday solidarity mass, organized by a federation of Filipino associations in Barcelona Kapulungan ng mga Lider Pinoy sa Barcelona (KALIPI), was attended by local public officials, non-governmental organizations leaders, relatives of typhoon victims and the Filipino community who braved the rain to offer prayers and donations.\n\nLhyna Ramos from Tacloban City, who currently resides in Barcelona and had lost contact with her family for a few days, offered a candle during the mass.\n\n“Masaya ako na okay yung pamilya ko pero siyempre kahit na okay sila malungkot pa rin kasi nagkahiwa-hiwalay sila. Malungkot pa rin, siyempre nasasaktan ako para dun sa mga kababayan ko, kalugar ko, mga kaibigan, kilala ko, na hindi sila naka-survive. Yung mga bata, ang sakit-sakit, nawalan sila ng magulang, nawalan sila ng anak, nawala lahat sa kanila,” Ramos said.\n\n“It’s a shame that after the earthquake, you have to suffer this new catastrophe but I’m confident, I believe that the Filipino people are strong enough to overcome the bad things that happened the last time,” said Miquel Mateu, director of Asia-Pacific department of the Barcelona City Council.\n\nApproximately 1850 euros (around P109,000) were collected and will be coursed through Philippine Catholic Church’s National Secretariat for Social Action.\n\nAside from this amount, Paulita Astillero, president of KALIPI, reported that donations amounting to 1200 euros (around P70,000) were already received in the account the federation had opened for the victims of the calamity.\n\nCaritas Diocesana de Barcelona, meanwhile, has already raised almost 150,000 euros (around P8.8 milion) which will be coursed through Caritas Philippines according to its Ciutat Vella director Juana Martin.\n\nIglesia de San Agustin still receives relief goods after having sent 13 boxes of canned goods and clothes to the Philippines.\n\n“Ipinagdasal natin ang mga biktima na mabigyan ng pagkakataon, mabigyan ng lakas na babangon ulit, ipinagdasal din natin ang mga tumutulong na kahit papaano sana ay magampaman nila ang kaulukang misyon at ipagdasal din natin ang mga tutulong pa. At higit sa lahat huwag nating kalimutan na kahit anong mangyari kasama natin ang Diyos,” said Fr. Eliza Cielo, one of the priests who celebrated the mass.

Migración Filipina Femenina y Redes de Cuidados.”\n\nJennifer Masilang, one of the three Filipina speakers, said that she makes sure that her children value education and learn Tagalog by speaking the language at home.\n\nShe has also frequently taken her children to the Philippines to make them more aware of the difficult situation in the country and appreciate more of what they have.\n\nJennifer’s mother and the family’s matriarch, Rebecca Masilang, who has been living in Barcelona for more than 25 years and was among the first Filipinos who came to the Catalan capital, placed importance on parents’ fundamental role in inculcating values to their children born abroad.\n\n“Yang pag-opo, pagmamano, hindi dapat natin alisin sa kanila. Kaya sa ating matatanda, sa ating mga nauna dito, sa ating mga magulang, nasa atin talaga ang paghubog sa mga kabataang Pilipino. Respeto sa matatanda, respeto kahit sa mga hindi natin kalahi, wag natin gayahin dito ang kultura nila ang matatanda bina-balewala, sa atin mentras tumatanda, lalong pinapahalagahan,” Rebecca.\n\nHer granddaughter, Krystel Cayari, who grew up both in the Philippines and Spain and works as a nurse in Barcelona, has shown respect and expressed profound concern for her elderly patients.\n\n“Yung values na itinuro sa akin ng mga lola ko, ng mga parents ko, na-apply ko siya sa trabaho ko as a nurse. Minsan may mga pasyente ako kailangan lang nila ng respeto, ng konting pagsasalita, konting kausap at kung minsan yung hindi nabibigay ng family nila dahil nagtatrabaho,” Krystel said.\n\nAdmiration for Filipinas\n\nThe three women also showed that Filipinas, though they can be emotional sometimes, are strong, brave, intelligent and play an important role in family and nation-building.\n\nIzquierdo expressed her admiration of Philippine society in terms of gender equality, which she experienced first-hand while doing the research in the country.\n\nJennifer said that Filipinas don’t want just to be left at home. What they want is to work, earn and also contribute to the family.\n\nAnd like most Filipinas in Barcelona, the three generations of women Rebecca, Jennifer and Krystel have been also active in the Filipino community, especially in one of the Filipino Catholic Church choirs.\n\nSuch activities of the Catholic Church were also part of Izquierdo’s study. In fact, another UAB professor and resource speaker Enrico Mora emphasized the important contribution of the Filipino Catholic Church in organizing the Filipino community in Barcelona.\n\nMora further recognized the existence of mutual help in the community, which Filipinos would rather call “bayanihan.”\n\nOriginally published on ABS-CBNnews.com"
