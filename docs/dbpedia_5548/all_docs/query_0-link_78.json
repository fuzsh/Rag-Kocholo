        "text": "Echoes of the Opening Celebration\n\nOPENING OF THE JUBILEE YEAR: BICENTENARY OF THE\n\nBIRTH OF BLESSED FRANCISCO PALAU Y QUER, ocd\n\nCATHEDRAL OF BARCELONA, 29 December 2010\n\nOn December 29, 2010 at 7:00 o’clock in the evening, the solemn Eucharistic Mass for the Opening of the Bicentenary of the birth of Blessed Francisco Palau y Quer took place at the Cathedral of Barcelona.\n\nThe Cardinal of Barcelona, Luis Martínez Sistach, concelebrated with four bishops, many priests, including the Carmelite Fathers, who came from different parts of the Peninsula.\n\nThe aisles of the Gothic Cathedral of Barcelona were packed with the faithful, a big number of the Carmelite Missionaries and Teresian Carmelite Missionaries, CMS, friends and collaborators in the various apostolic works of the two religious congregations, whose founder is Blessed Francisco Palau.\n\nThe welcome greeting recalled to us the essential aspects of the person and work of Francisco Palau. It was done with the Christmas liturgical antiphon. “A child is born to us, a son is given to us ....” At the birth of Francisco Palau, we have also been given a gift to the Church, for the good of the world.\n\nThe temple showed its beauty with light, the strength of the rock, the harmony of its forms and architectural ensemble of this Gothic Catalan jewel. The picture of Fr. Palau, Carmelite apostle and founder, was decorated with lights from the five Continents where the Sisters work and sow the seed of the Gospel to its people.\n\nFrancisco Palau must be happy in heaven to contemplate the living Church singing as a pilgrim people, listening attentively to the Word of God, praying and pleading to the Triune God with the writings he left us in his retreats and reflections. A living Church made up of a varied assembly and multiplicity of origin, but united with the sole purpose of glorifying God for the life of this Catalan who, with his constant effort, worked hard and gave his life for love of the Church, his Beloved.\n\nThe beauty and harmony that enveloped the entire celebration was a song of gratitude, a call to follow the path of sincere love of God who became incarnate in the Son of Mary and to men and women - the whole person redeemed by Christ. The love of God and neighbour, inextricably linked expressed at different times of the Eucharist.\n\nThe Cardinal in his homily gave us a portrait of the person of Fr. Palau, a committed Carmelite in the service of the Church; creative and a fighter in the midst of adversity as it was in the nineteenth century Church. Prayer and contemplation led him constantly to struggle for the Church, God and neighbour. The two religious families that have him as their founder prolong in the history the charism of service and love of Christ to those in need yesterday and today.\n\nIn the general intercessions read by two sisters, we recalled the palautian thoughts and phrases that motivated the intercessions for the Church: those who govern, the entire humanity, the youth, the labourers, those far and alienated from religious practice, those who suffer ... All walks of life need the help of the Almighty God so as to walk in faith that generates justice.\n\nOfferings: light, earth, synthesis of an incarnated spirituality; My Relations with the Church (palautian writings), and the bread and wine were presented with all solemnity, opening us to new meaning in that assembly, in the time of feasting and gratitude. Contemplating the big number of priests, who together raised to heaven the Eucharistic blessing, was a sublime moment of worship and thanksgiving to God through Jesus Christ, the Eternal Priest. After the consecration three Indians presented the adoration “Arthi”.\n\nThe songs of the celebration were performed by the choir \"Etosca\" of Aytona; the assembly participated as God's people marching in. At the end of the distribution of communion, three young musicians led us to a melody; to a quieting and contemplation of the beauty of the presence of the Almighty God that enables us to continue collaborating in his work and to acknowledge what we have received.\n\nAgustí Borrell, Provincial of the Discalced Carmelites of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, at the end of the Mass read the letter of the Father General of the Teresian Carmelite Order encouraging us to live this Jubilee year as a grace to guide us towards a true evangelical conversion and follow the path of charismatic fidelity shown to us by Fr. Palau.\n\nTwo sisters reminded us that this jubilee year is also a year of solidary commitment. An account will be opened for this purpose to be alloted to the project of helping those in need in Haiti. At the conclusion of the Mass of the Jubilee Year to be held, God willing, at the parish of Aytona (Lleida) on December 29, 2011, we shall be informed of the contributions made together.\n\nWith great joy we sang together the hymn SALVE FRANCISCO, PROFETA DE DIOS and we parted with greetings and hugs filled with the joy of the wonderful celebration we have participated in.\n\nAt the Cathedral square, the school AMPA \"Mare de Déu del Carme” of Prat de Llobregat offered us their music and dance with Sisquet and Carmeta, and the “giant figures” of the school gave a festal and popular tone, which added to the festive celebration.\n\nThis is such a momentous experience in the hearts and minds of all who participated. It is our desire the see Bl. Francisco Palau recognized for his sanctity.\n\nOpening Celebration at the General House – Rome\n\nThe opening celebration of the Bicentenary of the birth of our Father Founder, Francisco Palau y Quer, at the General House, began with a solemn Eucharistic Celebration. Fr. Emilio J. Martínez, OCD, Vicar General, presided over the Eucharist, along with other seven Carmelite Fathers; in the homily he emphasized some aspects:\n\nThe celebration of this jubilee year, as a preparation to the bicentenary of Francisco Palau’s birth, leads us not only to the reading and knowing of his writings but to an opportunity to review and pray over the way we live our own vocation; this is not only for you, his daughters, but also for us, his brothers.\n\nThe celebration of this centenary enclosed within the preparation of the fifth centenary of St Teresa’s birth is not only an event for the palautian family but pertains to the whole Order, because the person who is at the centre of our celebration is a Discalced Carmelite, one of our own, a tireless searcher of God; we rejoice at one son and brother of St. Teresa of Jesus, our mother, who said: I am yours, I was born for you”...and Bl. Francisco Palau: “I will go where the glory of God calls me”. May all of us, too, be able to utter like them, leaving aside our personal projects, including struggles for our own sanctification: Lord, I am at your service, send me wherever you wish…my life belongs to you…take me wherever I can give you a better service, wherever you need me.\n\nFather Palau lived his Carmelite vocation: prayer and apostolate with courage and depth as a living expression of his service to the Church. He was deprived of living in community life, which is the third dimension of his vocation, because he was forced to by the circumstances of the time. And he founded your congregation. You are the continuation and the realization of his dream and of this aspect of Father Palau’s life. We congratulate you and we are with you.\n\nAfter the homily, at the moment of the offertory procession, a person of each Continent presented to the altar Light and Salt as symbols of prayer and mission. The colour of the five Continents symbolized the congregational openness and interculturality; during the intercession, we prayed in a special way for the needs of our congregation and for the ecclesial and social needs.\n\nSoon after the Eucharist we shared a fraternal meal at the dining room of Mater Carmeli School; the student-Carmelite brothers offered us a presentation of some concrete aspects on the life of Fr. Palau. They also intoned some joyful songs.\n\nIn this way, in a festal atmosphere of joy and vocational commitment, we lived the inauguration of the Jubilee Year.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nLAUNCHING OF FR. PALAU’S BICENTENARY BIRTH\n\nKefamenanu, TTU\n\nNTT, Indonesia\n\nLast December 29, 2010, we celebrated the launching of the Jubilee year in honor of the Bicentenary of the birth of our Father Founder, Blessed Francisco Palau at the Novitiate House, Kefamenanu, Indonesia.\n\nIt was a simple but meaningful celebration where we invited our friends, benefactors, families of our sisters and neighbors. Before the mass at 10:30 AM, Sr. Petronila Lalic, CM, the outgoing coordinator of NTT, Indonesia, gave a brief introduction on the life of Fr. Palau and the significance of this year of grace for the Carmelite Missionaries throughout the whole world and all those who will join us during this year. Fr. Yustus Asa, SVD, the Vicar of the Diocese of Atambua presided over the Eucharistic celebration together with other six concelebrants including the Regional Vicar of the Carmelite Fathers, Fr. Christianus Surinono, OCD. During the homily, Fr. Yustus underlined the vision-mission of the Carmelite Missionaries which had the tone of the charism of Father Founder that is love of God and love of neighbors.\n\nAfter the mass, Sr. Sally Buenconsejo, CM, the new coordinator of Carmelite Missionaries in Nusa Tenggara Timur expressed her gratitude to Fr. Yustus and the concelebrating priests and also to those who attended the Eucharistic celebration for joining us in the opening of the Bicentenary of the birth of Fr. Palau. She also explained about the indulgence which the Holy Father Benedict XVI granted to those who will join us in this activity. She also invited them to view the exhibit on the journey of Fr. Palau, the places where he went, his books, and other documents especially on his beatification. In the exhibit, the Carmelite Missionaries as a congregation, the Philippine Province and its foundations in Indonesia were introduced. She also asked and encouraged them to pray for the canonization of Fr. Palau. Thus, each one was given the prayer for this purpose. Lastly, she invited them to join us for lunch.\n\nThe preparation and the actual launching was indeed a miracle though it was a short time yet it was done smoothly and with the cooperation of everybody. How can we express to God our gratitude for all the goodness He has done to all of us? “Thank you Lord for the gift of Fr. Palau in the Church for through him, we were able to live out our charism, that is, COMMUNION.”\n\n______________________________________\n\nOPENING CELEBRATION\n\nCM – CAGAYAN DE ORO, SIAY, ZAMBOANGA\n\nPHILIPPINES\n\nThis shall be a year of grace for the Carmelite Missionaries all over the world. Last Dec. 29, 2010, we celebrated the opening of the Bicentenary of the birth of Fr. Francisco Palau, OCD.\n\nThe two communities in Cagayan de Oro, Northern Mindanao (Manresa and Lapasan, together with the four Sisters assigned in Siay, Zamboanga Sibugay, and some Sisters on family vacation joined our celebrated together in a Mass presided by our Archbishop Antonio J. Ledesma, SJ, DD, with Msgr. Eutiquiano M. Legitimas, PC, SSJV, Rev. Fr. Othelo P. Polinar, STL, SSJV, Rev. Fr, Jorge, SJ, Rev. Fr. Robert J. Suchan, SJ, Rev. Fr. Hawthorne G. Galas, SSJV, as concelebrants.\n\nMembers of different religious communities along with friends, CMS, families and collaborators joined the festivity. It was a simple yet meaningful celebration. Before the Mass, there was a PowerPoint presentation on the life of Fr. Palau and to highlight one of the characteristic traits of Fr, Palau, that of exorcism, we distributed bottles of holy water to all those who came.\n\nThat this year, we may all “live and die for the Church” and inspire our collaborators to do the same, wherever we are. And so be it.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nOpening of the PalautianJubilee Year\n\nKorea\n\nOn December 29th, we the Carmelite Missionaries of Korea and the CMS of the whole country gathered together in the Parish of Topyong-dong, where one of our communities has its residence and where the sisters carry out their apostolate. We met together to celebrate the Opening of the Palautian Jubilee Year on the occasion of the Bicentenary of the birth of our Father Founder, Bl. Francisco Palau. He was born in Aytona (Lerida) on December 29, 1811. The façade, the entrance to the Church and the whole of it, and the dining room were decorated with placards showing the personality of Fr. Palau with some of his memorable phrases, which helped all those who were present to have a feeling of festal atmosphere.\n\nAt 2:00 o’clock p.m. we had a solemn Eucharist concelebrated by 12 priests, presided over by Fr. Bruno Kim Yong-Mun, Superior Provincial of the Discalced Carmelite of Korea. Sr. Cecilia Kim led the entrance procession bringing the relic of Fr. Palau which she placed before the altar. In spite of being a working day, and thus for this reason many could not come, the Church was packed with about 450 people. The choir, conducted by Sr. Jacinta Lee was composed by the CMS members and the 6 novices. They sang Palautian hymns composed in Korea for this particular occasion. We too had pauses of instrumental music played by two youth members of the Parish. Two sisters presented the offerings; soil and a candle, symbolizing the Light that the Lord gives us through the Palautian charism spread over the 5 Continents. The bread and wine were brought to the altar by a couple dressed in Korean costumes. After the communion, we, the sisters, renewed our vows and soon after about 200 CMS members renewed their promises. Everything was very solemn and full of emotion.\n\nWe are grateful to Fr. Bruno for his encouraging words inviting us to live this Jubilee Year with a profound meaning, by coming closer to the charism of our Founder and interiorizing it to the point of making it our own. He said that all these celebrations would have no meaning if we do not become more responsible of the heritage we have received. Finally Sr Cecilia Kim, Viceprovincial Superior, with simplicity and spontaneity that characterize her, expressed her gratitude to all those who have collaborated to the success of the celebration, especially to the authorities and the volunteers of the Parish. Soon after that, Sr. Cecilia Cheong presented the leaflet of the solidarity project of the Congregation, inviting us to collaborate with the whole Congregation to reach out to the needs of the people in Haiti.\n\nDuring the fraternal agape, we were entertained by five Carmelite Missionaries who played typical Korean instruments and delighted us with the “Samul nori”, a type of Korean orchestra with different kinds of drums. Inspite of the cold weather, we all not only enjoyed the Korean pastries but especially the joyful festal mood, in which Father Francisco Palau helped us to grow in brotherly and sisterly love.\n\nThank you, Fr. Palau. As we come to know you deeper, we admire more the kind of person you are and, as your daughters, we want to continue your mission to proclaim the beauty of your Beloved, the Church, to the whole world.\n\nIVORY COAST\n\nWe are on a great festivity!\n\nIt was a great festivity In the Delegation house and novitiate of Abidjan as we gave thanks to the Lord at the opening celebration of the bicentenary of the birth of Fr. Palau. The chapel was decorated for the occasion which invited us to enter into the cave and contemplate the mystery of Christmas.\n\nOne of the creatively decorated sentences read: \"Oh Holy Church, you are the object of my love\". With this phrase we wanted to express what the Church meant to Fr. Palau. In the Church, mystery of communion, he found the longed for synthesis throughout the long years of search between contemplation and mission. And for him, the Church, God and neighbour, is the ultimate object and fullness of his love; for her he will live, for her he wlll spend his entire life with joy and enthusiasm. In this Jubilee Year we want this Palautian LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM to be transmitted to us to enable us to offer ourselves to the Church.\n\nThe liturgy was culminated in the Thanksgiving Eucharistic celebration on the 30th. We were accompanied by the Carmelite Fathers, the CMS youth group and neighbouring friends of the community.\n\nIn fraternal and familial ambience, we gave thanks to God for the great spiritual wealth and experience left to us by Fr. Palau. It is a challenge to rediscover and to live from day to day: the building of communion and universal fraternity, justice and peace. And from the Eucharistic table we shared another agape fraternal table.\n\nComunidade São José - Betim\n\nMinas Gerais - Bairro Bandeirinhas (Brasil)\n\nOn 29th December 2010, we initiated the commemorative celebrations of the Bicentenary of our Father Founder, Francisco Palau, and the 150 years of our birth as a religious family with a beautiful Eucharistic celebration presided over by our parish priest, Fr. Hildebrando Marques.\n\nIt was an occasion for a profound thanksgiving where the people accompanied us with much enthusiasm. The Parish priest initiated the liturgical service with a communitarian penitential rite and explained to us the meaning of the plenary indulgence. The homily was a beautiful explanation of the life and spirit of Francisco Palau. He promised to live this jubilee year in the Parish fostering occasions to get a better knowledge of his life and a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Church today. During the offering procession we presented five lamps symbolizing the five Continents illumined by our life of prayer and contemplation, along with the soil as a symbol of our mission.\n\nAt the end of the celebration and before the final blessing, Sr. Nieves presented the Project of the Jubilee Year: the Year of Solidarity, conscienticizing all, including the children, to offer their contribution throughout the year for the rebuilding of the country of Haiti. We sang HAPPY ANNIVERSARY with a delicious “bolo” of 200 years.\n\nIn a festive atmosphere, we had a fraternal sharing with the people who expressed their gratitude.\n\nWe are sending you some photos taken during the celebration.\n\nAffectionate greetings from each one of us.\n\nOpening Celebration of the Jubilee Year\n\n“San Carlos” de Torremolinos Community- Málaga\n\nAt the height of the Christmas season, our Father Founder lived with simplicity and joy echoing the Carmelite tradition. We wanted to join in the joy of the congregation in celebrating the second centenary of his birth this Palautian Jubilee Year.\n\nAlmost at the same time, on 29th December, when the Jubilee Year was opened in Barcelona, we gathered to celebrate the Eucharist with the Carmelite Fathers, the women of the residence, our “San Carlos” Community, and some sisters from the Community of Saint Teresa in Torremolinos. Fr. Juan Hidalgo, OCD, presided over the Mass: He has been our collaborator for many years, helping us in our mission at the forefront, through the educational work in the Schools of Cordoba and San Fernando (Cadiz). He motivated the celebration by highlighting the figure of our Father Founder.\n\nThe most emotive moments have been the proclamation of our faith, that on this occasion we uttered with the words of Blessed Francisco Palau, according to the text of the Book of My Relations 22, 20, and the offertory, when the celebrant presented and offered to the community, along with the bread and wine, the same words that our Father Founder directed the Sisters of Lerida and Aytona in his letter (7, 2).\n\nWe have only started the year and we are thinking about holding this event at a general level together with all the staff of the residence, friends, benefactors ... on March 20, the anniversary of his passing to new life.\n\nOPENING OF THE PALAUTIAN BICENTENARY\n\nProvincial House – Argentina\n\nWe want to share with you all the celebration in our Provincial House on the Opening of the Jubilee Year, a year of grace for the bicentenary of the birth of our Father Francisco Palau. It was a joyous celebration knowing that all our sisters and the entire Missionary Carmel in the different parts of the world were united on that day, with grateful remembrance of the gift of God to the Church in the person of our Father Founder.\n\nThe celebration, tinged with joy, simplicity and depth, focused on the communitarian Eucharist, presided over by Father Pablo Ferreiro, OCD. He presented Father Founder to us as a mystic and prophet the Church; mystery of communion. We enthusiastically echoed his life, work and message, challenging us to make him be known in the various ambience: pastoral, social, family, church, etc.... The Priest Celebrant said that the testimony and words of our Founder, his mysticism and prophecy of the communion, so necessary in our world today, in the Church and even within our religious families, are not yet sufficiently benefitted from.\n\nThe challenge is clear which asks of us to profit from this bicentenary celebration to know the testimony and message of our Father Founder; to grow in faithfulness to the vocation received through his motivation, loving the Church, “God and neighbour”, living and proclaiming communion without glosses or measures, amid the reality that surrounds us, as is typical of the daughters of Fr. Palau.\n\nThe invitation is to keep walking as consecrated women, Carmelite Missionaries, entrusted and abandoned in the hands of Providence, certain that “well cared for is the one who trusts in God”.\n\nOpening of the Jubilee Year\n\nProvince of “Sagrado Corazón\" - Medellin\n\ndiv style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n“I went up to the mountain with my soul submerged in sorrow. And a voice Coming from the mountain said to me: “Prayer, prayer”. MRel 9,7\n\nWith the experience of fatigue brought by the weight of the year end, a group of sisters from the Province of Medellín went for annual retreat and, like Father Palau, the urge and call for prayer was most felt by us.\n\nIn this atmosphere of joyous intimacy with God, we opened the jubilee year for the bicentenary of the birth of our Father Founder. We started the retreat a few days before, which had been a privileged space of preparation and deepening on his doctrine, inviting us to understand and penetrate the mystery of God and neighbour as an expression of our love to the God who wants to become a “human experience\" in us, and not depending on our “own perception” or experience of Him.\n\nOn the 29th, his physical presence, through the relic, writings, and his daughters, pervaded the chapel (not a figurative language, by the size of the sculpture that represents him in this Provincial House).\n\nWe came together to \"open doors\", an ecclesial symbol of Jubilee, and so, with the life and works of our Founder, we were able to reach his threshold; we joyfully celebrated the Eucharist, in which 6 of our juniors renewed their vows as a witness to his charismatic fidelity.\n\nBut Francisco Palau wanted to talk, and direct his words to his sons and daughters, and did so through his letter (41); he directed Juana Gratias in her historic journey, and now in his spiritual journey two centuries later, he does the same to us.\n\n“My dear daughter: Let us go to your soul. Your progress and your flight towards God have to be the primary and main object and necessity of all our correspondence. Union in consolidated in the love of the neighbours” (L 41, 1)\n\nThe words of our Father Founder were not silenced there; they continue to resonate in us and in all the members of the Carmelite Missionary Secular, as much as with Fathers Liomer Vásquez and Luis Eduardo Orrego, who celebrated the Eucharist.\n\nWe opened the Jubilee Year to rejoice in the Lord for our Father Founder and may our works make us solidary with the people of today.\n\nCelebration in Querétaro – México\n\nIn the Asilo (Home for the Aged) of San Sebastian de Queretaro (Mexico), five sisters gathered to share the last days of the year; two from Tantoyuca and three from Querétaro, to initiate the celebration of the bicentenary of the birth of our Father Founder. We celebrated the Eucharist in a very simple ambience, accompanied by the 32 elderly women we serve. Fr. Alejandro Gutierrez, chaplain of the Asilo and head of the Pastoral Care in the diocese, presided over the Mass. He clearly and concisely emphasized the figure of Father Palau as a missionary who accepted the commission of the Lord, giving his life to the cause of the Kingdom where the glory of God needed him, doing the mission through the testimony of his faithful and contemplative life. We sisters, after the homily, renewed our vows as a gesture of gratitude to God for the gift of vocation, and for our Father Founder, for the charismatic legacy he bestowed to us as our commitment to the Church.\n\nBefore the Eucharist started, we read a paragraph from the letter of solicitude of our Superior General to the Holy See and the approval received, as well as explanations of what Jubilee means, and on how to obtain the plenary indulgence. In this way, our elderly residents became aware of our celebration and what it means to all the members of the Congregation and those close to us.\n\nFrom this day onward, we begin the planning of the solemn celebration on March 20, when the families, friends and benefactors of the Asilo can accompany us, as well as the educational community of Tantoyuca.\n\nCelebration of the Opening of the Bicentenary of the Birth of Francisco Palau - 1811- 2011\n\n“TERESA DE LOS ANDES” Delegation – CHILE\n\nThe family of Missionary Carmel in Chile began the celebration of the 200 years of the birth of Francisco Palau, our founder, and the 150 years of life of our congregation on 4th December with a Eucharistic celebration at the Parish of the “Natividad del Señor”. The Discalced Carmelite Fathers, the Teresian Carmelite Missionaries, the Parish Priest, clergy, deacons, as well as the members of the Carmelite Missionary Secular, families and friends were present.\n\n“I admire God’s work in you. I take delight in her as God is… Your work is mine and yours is the work of God.” (L 77, 2)\n\nWe thank the Lord for this charismatic gift conceived for the mission of the Church among our people. We are also joyful for the life generated in groups and communities of lay people, especially the CMS, who have enriched and strengthened the palautian experience.\n\nAs the Church of God we are called to be signs and expression of communion; body of Christ, above all among the suffering members.\n\nIn your desire, Lord, we are a missionary Church called to proclaim your Name and your Kingdom through our life and words. You have made a permanent dialogue with us and this invites us to let ourselves be transformed and accompanied by Him. His Words of love, contained in the Sacred Scriptures, are filled with Eucharistic splendour, filled with Life.\n\nAt the renewal of our faith, we were invited to pray the Creed written by Fr. Palau, which manifested his ardent love and passion for the Church. It was such an emotional moment as the whole assembly proclaimed with Francisco Palau his faith in the Triune God, in the persecuted, crucified and wounded Church.\n\nAfter the homily, the members of the CMS “El Vedrá” and “Ciudadela” communities renewed their promises and after communion we, the CM sisters, did the same.\n\nFinally, in the heart of Mary, “our beautiful and skilled gardener”, we entrust the cultivation of this garden to her care, ability and refinement. We ask her to receive in her hands our flower and she takes charge to offer it to God.\n\nFraternity was extended through a simple cocktail, some songs and greetings at the Delegation House. Together with the invited guests, we thanked the Lord for the charismatic gift, welcoming it in the Chilean lands through the many sisters who had preceded us, leaving the seed and the challenge of his incarnation\n\nMissionary Carmel in Chile:\n\n“Go, preach the Gospel. This is the Law: You shall love God for being who He is, infinite goodness; and your neighbours as yourself.”\n\nCELEBRATION OF THE OPENING OF THE BICENTENARY\n\nPROVINCE “Fr. Francisco Palau” Philippines\n\nThe celebration was a successful and memorable one. Since the planning stage till the actual event, both congregations, the Carmelite Missionaries and the Teresian Carmelite Missionaries (CM & CMT) did well with collaboration and cooperation. The mass was held at the Mt. Carmel Shrine at 6 pm with Bishop Honesto Ongtioco as the main celebrant. The OCD priests and Fr. Miguel (Comboni) concelebrated with the bishop. Before the mass, a short presentation of the life of Fr. Founder (CD) was shown.\n\nThe Liturgy was simple yet solemn. It was participated in by the CM, CMT, CMS-Youth and Adult (only representatives from different chapters in Luzon), sisters from different congregations based in New Manila, and some parishioners who used to attend the 6pm mass. It was very striking that in the first pew to the left alley, there was a pair of Insane (not formally dressed who sat there). They were so attentive and well behaved during the mass. Through them we remember in a special way the apostolate of Fr. Palau with this type of sick people. We associated it as a sign of Fr. Palau’s presence. We had a group picture (CMT-CM) with the Bishop.\n\nAfter the mass, we proceeded to the St. Paul University Gym for dinner. A program followed after with variety of numbers/presentations. The CMT presented a skit of Fr. Palau’s life. It was beautiful and well prepared. Sr. Raquel,cmt acted as the mother and Bro. Ferdinand, OCD as the Father. On the other hand, the CM had several numbers: welcome song by the postulant’s community, dance of the CMS youth, songs in different languages about love and communion, short skit on the Search and Biblical Women represented by some sisters; Fr. Rey Sotelo, ocd acted as Fr. Palau. Sr. Loida Tortogo sang a solo in Spanish.\n\nThis night was graced by the presence of the Bishop and some priests. Indeed, it was an experience of a family in unity, fraternal sharing and communion. We felt Fr. Palau’s presence in the presence of each of his daughters. He is alive and continues to live with us as we live and share his life and mission to and in the Church.\n\nThe celebration on 29th December 2010.\n\nBirth Bicentenary of Fr. Founder\n\nProvince of St. Francis Xavier, India.\n\n29th December 2009 was indeed a memorable day for the community of Prithikunj, and the entire province. As we had planned earlier along with animators of the communities the celebration of the opening of the jubilee year was opened with the Eucharistic celebration at St. Anne’s parish church, Pali Hill , Bandra presided by Fr. Nelson O.C.D. The Carmelite Missionaries entered in procession with the photo of our Fr. Founder accompanied by the novices dancing to the melodious choir of the junior sisters. The beautifully decorated alter, done by the parishners glowed in radiance.\n\nThe introduction given by one of the Carmelite Missionaries beautifully brought out the life and doctrine of Fr. Palau. The nucleus of Fr. Palau’s charismatic experience was captured by the expressions such as “Oh, church; how beautiful and infinitely loveble you are!” “ I live and will live for the church, I live and will die for her”.\n\nIn his homily, Fr. Nelson O.C.D rightly emphasized the true character of Bl. Francisco Palau. He said ; “Palau was a true son of the church, passionate lover of her, and a mighty defender of her. He was a missionary in true sense that he found the need for catechizing & preaching, a true Carmelite that he followed the Spirit of St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross and propagated the filial devotion to Mother Mary. Fr. Palau’s long years of living in the solitude of “Vedra” gave him strong foundation in his relationship with the church. Solitary life combined with the missionary activity was a true hall mark of this ‘son of the church’.\n\nAfter the Eucharistic celebration, while having refreshment, we had a power point presentation on “The Charism of our Congregation and birth of Carmelite Missionaries in India”. In all, around 40 Carmelite Missionaries from various communities were present in spite of the distance to travel. Good number of Religious, priests, and lay faithful from nearby parishes too were present.\n\nThe bust of Bl.Francisco Palu was installed at Prithikunj community in the presence of the Congregation, blessed by Fr. Nelson O.C.D. on the same day . A calendar was published depicting the places connected with Fr. Palau and life of Carmelite Missionaries.\n\nWe thank the Lord for the gift of our dear Father founder and the family of missionary Carmel.\n\nOpening of the Bicentennial Barth of\n\nFr. Francisco Palau y Quer, OCD\n\nNovitiate of Argentina\n\n1811 - 29 December – 2011\n\nFrom the community of the Novitiate of the Carmelite Missionaries, we commemorate the birth of Father Founder who left us a legacy of the immense wealth of a specific charism: \"to give ourselves for love of God and neighbour.\"\n\nWe thanked the Lord for the testimony of our Father, who continues to guide the journey of his daughters, and entrusting the task to continue proclaiming his message of love to the most in need.\n\nSince we started the day, our prayer was all palautian, offering thanks for everything received and for those who have left us the way with their foot prints to continue relentlessly the God-given work. At the moment of prayer, we watched and shared in community the video on Sister Juana Gratias which filled our hearts with strength and confidence with which she allowed herself to be guided by Fr. Palau.\n\nThen, the celebration of the Eucharist became a song of praise shared with the faithful of the parish community, who carefully listened to Sister Maria del Carmen Trillo explaining the reason of our joy. All joined us with their gratitude. The celebration was simple and very fraternal. What was most gratifying was although we were few we felt accompanied.\n\nAll ended with a brief moment of adoration that brought us into the deep encounter with the beloved to give thanks for the \"gift of vocation and the calling to follow Him in the family of Missionary Carmel.\"\n\nQuellouno, 3 September 2010.\n\nThe “El Vedrá” Community of Quellouno greets all of you to communicate the joy that we felt as we welcomed the 9 Delegations from all the places where we, the Carmelite Missionaries of Peru and Bolivia, are present.\n\nWe lived the first Provincial Missionary Encounter celebrating thus the 100 years of the arrival of the Congregation to the Latin American lands, in 1910. As a Province, we desired to feel our being missionary. We, thereby, convoked ourselves in the community of Quellouno, “Province of Cuzco”, where the Congregation is present for more than 20 years, a place of rural mission with the native, Quechan peasants.\n\nTheme: “Disciples of Jesus Christ and Missionaries of His Kingdom: prophetic strength that generates communion.”\n\nAs we know those were 3 days of intense experience of the charism as Sisters and Lay, a Carmelite family that wants to be in accordance with the objectives of the encounter:\n\n1 .- To celebrate the 100 years of missionary presence in America and 150 years of the foundation of the Congregation.\n\n2 .- To offer a missionary experience that favors the personal and community encounter with Jesus among the brethren; one that impels us to be his disciples-missionaries of his kingdom in our history today\n\n3 .- To offer elements of our spirituality: contemplative dimension, prophetism, communion and the missionary dynamism.\n\nWe were 67 participants gathered last 26th August, sharing our identity and origin, deepening on the theme of our spirituality. In the morning Sister Violet Pilares gave us an input on both the life and journey of Father Francisco Palau and his sense of mission. Sisters Paula Moron and Celia Altamirano shared on the essential elements of our spirituality.\n\nWe shared the events day by day in the Encounter: in the morning of Saturday we lived the missionary experience of the rural Christian communities in our parish. We divided ourselves into four groups to go to the communities of Pampa, Esperanza, a native community of Chirumbia, Santusaires and Pan de Azucar. The experience was very positive, a hard and difficult reality in the fields: far distance, difficult access, poverty, which many of our brothers and sisters live, the lack of means, government neglect, etc… were some comments and impressions that touched us. Likewise, the warm welcome from the communities, the many loving gestures, the organization, the effort and the testimony of life and faith of the facilitators and communities, the beauty of the scenery. Another more profound impact in the level of life reflections and questions. The challenge of commitment to solidarity was very strong which was felt in the general level. Also expressions such as the desire to return, to make a longer experience, not just ocular, but to share life. Lastly, all were gathered in the evaluation that was done in the evening of the same day in groups according to communities visited. Lay and Sisters expressed the richness of the encounter and the challenge of the joint mission.\n\nOn the last day, we gathered in the closing Mass which was prepared by the different delegations, which colorfully enhanced the celebration of all that was lived. Sister. Rosa Ibarlucea, superior of the community, gave the concluding remarks with simple but meaningful words that expressed the experience. And in this atmosphere of celebration and fraternity, the school band of Quellouno, José Olaya, with his musicians sang the happy birthday song, and another musical piece as a sign of welcome and affection by the people. We ended up with the hoisting of the national flag by Sister Paula Morón. Thus we experienced the 3 days encounter. What has remained is the joy in sharing life, charism and mission, as well as the challenge to continue in the shared mission which is already a reality.\n\nFrom Quellouno, we send our sentiments of gratitude for all that we have experienced: first of all to the Lord, who made this event possible, as well as to Sr. Paula and Council, who gave it impetus, to the Organizing Committee, and to everyone who have taken joy in it. Let us continue to be united in the Lord.\n\nWith affection,\n\nEl Vedrá Community of Quellouno\n\nBICENTENNARY CELEBRATION IN THE SOUTH LAND DOWN UNDER (AUSTRALIA)\n\nThe flaming Spirit of Palau was highlighted with the vigour of his daughters to celebrate what had been left as heritage. Isn’t it just so wonderful that even the one and only community in the far distant continent of Oceania were not isolated in this universal celebration?\n\nHow can the four “Aussies” be out of the flock when the Pastor is going to celebrate 200 years? Certainly, wherever the daughters and friends of this remarkable man are present, this opening of the bicentenary must be remembered, shared and celebrated.\n\nThe Eucharistic celebration marked our day with Fr. Gerard Moran, OCD as the presider in the chapel of Mt. Carmel Retreat Centre, Sydney, Australia. Our Carmelite friars, friends, parishioners and benefactors joined our simple but memorable festive gathering. It was opportune time for us to explain to them the life and spirituality of our Father Founder.\n\nAfter the Mass, we enjoyed our table fellowship with the “international cuisine”. Each of us had cooked our own specialities... [Filipino, Indian and Portuguese dishes] The varieties of food that our friends had brought and shared made an exquisite banquet.\n\nIt would have been far from our Father Founder’s imagination on how amazing his missionary zeal has been lived out by his daughters that made his dream comes true.\n\nYes, as daughters of Fr. Palau, we joyfully and courageously proclaim what our Blessed Father had implanted in our hearts... “ I will go where the glory of God sends me.” We are the women who have the passion for the Church called to be signs of communion in this diverse world.\n\nBICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION IN TAIWAN\n\nIn this non Christian but deeply religious country, we, the daughters of Fr. Francisco Palau, have much to offer to those who are searching for a contemplative-apostolic spirituality. We recall years back when we first launched the book “Passion for the Church” to the parishioners. Gradually, we have integrated the yearly celebration of the feast of our Founder with the lay faithful. The opening of the Bicentennial celebration is another grand occasion and opportunity to make Fr. Palau be known to the people. The Mass was celebrated at the Mount Carmel Shrine in Hsinchu City at 7:30 0´clock in the evening. with Fr. James Ye, OCD as the main celebrant, and concelebrated by four other priests. We owe so much gratitude to our Carmelite Fathers, who facilitated and coordinated almost the entire event to its details (from the preparation of the liturgy, translations, flower arrangements…to refreshments…); their parishioners were mobilized to take part in the preparation. Our 3 communities also prepared a powerpoint presentation on the history of Carmel, the saints, the birth of our CM Congregation and our missionary presence in Taiwan and in the world, which was shown before the Mass started.\n\nHaving experienced the fruitfulness of the celebration of the Opening of the Bicentennial Year, our hopes are high that its Closing will also be as meaningful and momentous for each and every one in the Carmelite-Palautian family.\n\nINAUGURATION OF THE JUBILEE YEAR\n\nDELEGATION: “OUR LADY MOTHER OF THE CHURCH” NAIROBI, KENYA\n\nAs the saying goes thousand miles begin with a step, 29th December 2010 was the climax and memorable one of Bld. Francisco Palau. This great and significant event was a moment of grace and thanksgiving. Since long we were preparing for this auspicious day and in particular on 27th we had recollection and a talk on the spirituality of Fr. Palau.\n\nThe celebration was held in our parish: St. John the Evangelist, Langata, Nairobi, presided over by His Eminence John Cardinal Njue, the Archbishop of Nairobi. It was a joint celebration of all our communities in Kenya, Lay Carmelites Missionaries of Nairobi and Kitengela, the Carmelite Fathers, religious from various congregations, relatives of some of our sisters and formees, friends, and parishioners.\n\nThe Mass began at 10:00 a.m., with procession lead by our sisters and the liturgical dancers. At the beginning of the Mass we presented a brief history of Fr. Founder and the Congregation. Really, the liturgy, crowned by the deep and meaningful homily of Cardinal made us feel the presence and depth of Fr Francisco Palau. He began the homily saying that we have come from far, we are still far and we have a long way to go. A journey of celebration, of Bicentenary of the birth of Bld. Francisco Palau is a kind of re entering into his life, trying to understand his spirit, going through a process of renewal and animating ourselves deeply to that very special mission that God has given to us by the Charism. In order to be able to do all these he invited us to stay very close to the Word of God and thus we will be able to become lively and effective instrument in the hands of God and in the lives of the people with whom we live and realize our mission.\n\nTouched by the life of our Founder he requested us to keep the following powerful words in our minds and in our hearts: “I live and will live for the Church; I live and I will die for her” and to give ourselves unreservedly, climbing the mountain and getting down the valley but constantly holding on to the Word of God and letting the Lord to take charge of our life. At the end he appealed to us to pray for our country Kenya that the Lord may touch the hearts of the leaders who make policies to bring peace and unity among people. Finally, he too wished us a very grace filled jubilee year and prosperous 2011.\n\nSpiritual nourishment was followed by the delicious lunch which took place in the Church hall. As people were busy nourishing, entertainment programme was on. It started with a slide show presentation on the mission of the Carmelite Missionaries in this delegation, followed by a drama on Fr. Founder, a gracious and classical dance focused on the spirituality of Fr. Founder, Christmas Carols and presentation by the liturgical dancers. It was really an experience of thanksgiving and joyful communion.\n\nAs we thank God and the General Council, we pray through the intercession of Bld. Francisco Palau that we may discover the beauty of the church in a deeper way and live fully for it in love and service.\n\nGreetings from Malawi!\n\nUnited with the whole Congregation we celebrated the opening of the Jubilee Year in Chipaso parish in Kasungu, Malawi.\n\nThe Mass was officiated by Rev. Fr. Isaac Mpokwe, ocd, along with the concelebrants.\n\nThe celebration was simple and sober with the presence of parishioners, parents, CMS and friends.\n\nWe continue with the programming of our activities in order to share our charism throughout this year until the Closure of the Jubilee Year.\n\nMay our Father Founder help us to transmit his spirit in our lives and mission.\n\nWe entrust our lives and mission in the care of Our Mother Mary, the perfect image of the Church.\n\nWith affection from all the sisters in Malawi."
