These Spanish actors were able to make it big in the US, making them well-known in the States as well as other places in the world aside from Spain.\n\nPenélope Cruz\n\nTo this day, she is still one of the most popular Spanish-speaking celebrities.\n\nAntonio Banderas\n\nFamous Spanish Athletes\n\nSports athletes are known worldwide because of events like the Olympics and general worldwide interest in athletics. Athletes have a huge responsibility because they represent their country during intense physical and mental stress.\n\nRafael Nadal\n\nThat’s not his only record, though:\n\nHe’s the 7th player in tennis history to achieve the Grand Slam (four major tournament victories in the same year). This was accomplished in 2005.\n\nAt the 2018 French Open, he set the record for 86 victories and just two defeats.\n\nHe’s the only player to have won at least one Grand Slam tournament in 10 consecutive seasons.\n\nHe is the youngest player in the Open Era to win all four majors (at 24 years old).\n\nThe list goes on and on...\n\nThe most impressive thing in all this?\n\nHe reached the #1 spot in August 2017 despite playing with an injury for over two years.\n\nCarolina Marín\n\nShe is an Andalusia native and currently ranks #5 in the world in the BWF. In 2015, she was ranked #1 for 66 weeks.\n\nAndrés Iniesta\n\nHe was captain of Barça between 2015 and 2018. In 2012, he won the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award.

The world is no stranger to famous people of Spanish descent in the art realm since Europe has been pivotal in artistic movements for hundreds of years.\n\nOf course, there are Pablo Picasso, Franciso de Goya, Diego Velasquez, Joan Miro, and many more, but we can’t talk about all of them in this short article!\n\nSalvador Dalí\n\nHe rode out the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in exile in Paris and headed to New York during the Second World War. He made a fortune in the US and moved to Renaissance painting upon his return to Spain in 1948.\n\nCarlos Ruiz Zafón\n\nFamous Spanish Singers\n\nOf course, what is Spanish culture without singing and dancing? Spanish culture is known for its music and festivities, so it only makes sense that there are many famous singers from this musical country!\n\nRosalía\n\nJulio Iglesias\n\nHe was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013. That same year was recognized as the best-selling male Latin artist of all time (according to the Guinness Book of Records) and was honored as the most popular international artist in China. In many countries like Brazil, France, and Italy, he is the most successful foreign record seller and has the most records in history in his home country with 23 million sales.\n\nHe has won 2 Grammys, 1 Country Music Award, and 1 American Music Award, to mention just a few!\n\nFamous Spanish Historical Figures\n\nSpain’s spotlight isn’t a new development, and there have been many influential figures from Spain in the history of the Western world. Spain was one of the main players in early global colonization when Europe spread across the world and changed the trajectory of society forever.\n\nFrancisco Pizarro\n\nSurprisingly, Pizarro wasn’t killed by the Incas but rather by other conquistadors wanting to take his place in 1541.\n\nGeneral Francisco Franco\n\nFranco’s heritage can still be seen through the presence of the Spanish Monarchy. He named Juan Carlos as the King of Spain. Similarly, while Spain was officially neutral during WWII, Franco was close to both Hitler and Mussolini in Italy. This resulted in Spain adopting the same time zone as Germany and Italy, to make collaboration easier between the three countries.\n\nIn terms of culture, the end of the Francoist regime led to La Movida, the counter-cultural movement that took place during the transition from fascism. It's hard to believe that modern Spain isn't even fifty years old!\n\nLearning the Spanish Language\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the Spanish language, Spain, and Spanish culture, you should consider hiring a private tutor.
