The recipient read the entry speech “Barcelona, galería urbana” (Barcelona, ​​urban gallery), a tour of three major urban actions that have marked the current configuration of the city. He was answered on behalf of the RAED by full academician Jaime Rodrigo de Larrucea.\n\nBorn in Barcelona in 1964, the new academician is an architect from the School of Architecture of Barcelona. He opened his professional studio TDB Arquitectura in 1992 and is the author of institutional works such as the Sarrià University Residence, the headquarters of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, the headquarters of the Grífols laboratories or the ESADE Business School in the Campus of Sant Cugat del Vallés (Barcelona). In the field of building rehabilitation, his projects include the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Barcelona, ​​the Convention Centre and ESADE’s institutional headquarters in Barcelona, along with the Casa Burés building, intended for collective housing, also in Barcelona."
