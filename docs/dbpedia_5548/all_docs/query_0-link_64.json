        "text": "The President to the readers\n\nThe WYD 2011 preparatory meeting in El Escorial\n\nActivities in the Sections:\n\nMovements and new communities for the new evangelisation\n\nSafeguarding the humanum created male and female\n\nChurch and Sport Section: future plans\n\nA new under-secretary\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the LaityÂÂs new website\n\nAd limina visits\n\nThe Maronite Patriarch visits the Pontifical Council for the Laity\n\nContacts with associations and movements\n\nOther engagements\n\nThe President to the readers\n\nNext year the Church will hold the 13th ordinary general assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the theme ÂÂNew evangelization for the transmission of the Christian faith ÂÂ from 7 to 28 October 2012. Lay people are expected to be prime movers in this synod. The 50th anniversary of the calling of the Second Vatican Council falls on 12 October, an event which launched the Church into ÂÂ the hour of the laity ÂÂ. This is really the appropriate time to reflect upon the Council teachings on the vocation and mission of the laity, as well as on subsequent developments, especially the Synod of Bishops in 1987 and the corresponding apostolic exhortation Christifideles Laici, the magna charta of the Catholic laity. Then we could make an assessment of all that has happened. Above all, we can look to the future with confidence as we decipher the new social and cultural scenarios in which we in the Church today carry out our mission. We read in the Lineamenta for the next Synod that: ÂÂThe new sectors which call us into dialogue require turning a critical eye towards our manner of life, our thinking, our values and our means of communication. At the same time, the occasion must also serve as a selfevaluation of Christianity today [...] The new evangelization calls us to engage in dialogue with these sectors, not remaining confined to our communities and our institutions, but accepting the challenge to take part in these phenomena so as to speak and bear witness in these sectors, from the inside. This is the form of Christian martyria in todayÂÂs world, engaging in dialogue even with the recent forms of a militant atheism or an extreme secularism...ÂÂ (no. 7). This is the vast field of mission for the lay faithful today! It reminds us of a statement in Christifideles Laici: ÂÂA new state of affairs today both in the Church and in social, economic, political and cultural life, calls with a particular urgency for the action of the lay faithful. If lack of commitment is always unacceptable, the present time renders it even more so. It is not permissible for anyone to remain idle ÂÂ (no. 3).\n\nNowadays we often speak about the lay faithful, and the corresponding literature in theology, pastoral ministry and canon law continues to grow. However, I have the impression that we do not always perceive that which is truly essential. What do I mean by this? I shall answer briefly with the following three points:\n\n1. To return to the essential is to re-establish a clear concept of Christian identity. In postmodern culture Christian identity is being harassed. Relativism and ÂÂweak thought ÂÂ generate fragile personalities that are fragmented and incoherent, and the new patterns of life plant traps and confusion among people, including the baptised. A typical identikit of an average Christian would seem to be the result of a confused amalgamation of choices made arbitrarily and for reasons of comfort. That is why Benedict XVI continues to emphasise that the identity of each of ChristÂÂs disciples comes from Baptism: ÂÂÂÂIt is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in meÂÂ (Gal 2: 20). Hence, the essential identity of my life is changed through Baptism, and I continue to exist only in this changed state [...] This is the formula of Christian existence established in Baptism, the formula of the resurrection in time, the formula of the Christian ÂÂnoveltyÂÂ called to transform the world ÂÂ (Address to the 4th Convention of the Italian Church, 19 October 2006). So, the decisive and fundamental event in a ChristianÂÂs identity is a personal encounter with Christ: ÂÂBeing Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction ÂÂ (Deus Caritas Est, no. 1). That is why our lay people need to be provided with a comprehensive post-baptismal Christian initiation.\n\n2. To return to the essential is to have a visible and incisive presence in society, to be ÂÂ the leavening of the gospel ÂÂ, ÂÂ salt ÂÂ and ÂÂ light ÂÂ in the world, and to be guided by the social doctrine of the Church. The important point in the vocation and mission of the laity is the quality of being lay: ÂÂThe laity, by their very vocation, seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God ÂÂ (Lumen Gentium, no. 31). The lay faithful today are called to go against the tide with respect to the dominant culture that is trying to eliminate God from the public sphere. There is a real ÂÂChristianphobia ÂÂ around which is an expression of a dangerous secularist fundamentalism. It is time to go out from the sacristy and to leave behind empty and self-referential discourse, and so to become true witnesses and missionaries of the Gospel. It is not a problem for us Christians to find we are in the minority, but we do not want to be insignificant and ÂÂ insipid ÂÂ and to lose the ÂÂ flavour of the gospel ÂÂ.\n\n3. Finally, perhaps the most important challenge is to return to the essential by placing God at the centre of our lives. The Pope is particularly insistent on this point: ÂÂOften we are anxiously preoccupied with the social, cultural and political consequences of the faith, taking it for granted that faith is present, which unfortunately is less and less realistic. Perhaps we have placed an excessive trust in ecclesial structures and programmes, in the distribution of powers and functions; but what will happen if salt loses its flavour? ÂÂ (Homily in LisbonÂÂs Terreiro do Paço, 11 May 2010). This is the meaning of the question the Pope asked in his recent interview book: ÂÂ Should we not start all over again from God? ÂÂ (Light of the World). Our real problem today is the question of God. To educate lay people in the faith is to help them discover that God is at the centre. It is not just any god, but the God who was revealed in the face of Jesus Christ. Some days before the Pope was elected to the pontificate, he said: ÂÂWe need people who have their gaze directed towards God, for it is there that they learn true humanity. We need people whose minds are illuminated by the light of God and whose hearts are opened by God, so that their minds can speak to the minds of others and their hearts can open the hearts of others. It is only through people touched by God that God can return to humankind ÂÂ (LÂÂEuropa di Benedetto nella crisi delle culture, Siena 2005, pp. 63-64).\n\nCard. Stanisław Ryłko\n\nPresident\n\nTowards Madrid\n\nThe WYD 2011 preparatory meeting in El Escorial\n\nIn the prestigious setting of El Escorial near Madrid, the WYD 2011 preparatory meeting took place from 13 to 15 January 2011. There were representatives from 84 countries and 57 ecclesial movements and associations. These 234 delegates were invited by the Pontifical Council for the Laity and the Spanish organising committee. Everyone agreed that there was a climate of fellowship at the meeting, largely due to the perfect organisation put in place by the local committee with the help of about one hundred Spanish volunteers.\n\nCardinal Stanisław Ryłko, president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, opened the meeting. He said that we had come to a decisive stage in the preparations, spiritual and organisational, for WYD 2011 in Madrid. He thanked the delegates for their generous collaboration in working for the success of WYD. Likewise, he told the volunteers that it is important that the young people who will come from all over the world should see how welcoming they are and their spirit of sacrifice right throughout WYD. At times they may be doing some hidden tasks, but these are no less important. Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela, president of the local organising committee, expressed his desire for there to be a lively, agile and dynamic meeting and for the delegates to communicate specific information regarding their needs and expectations.\n\nOn Friday 14 January at midday, there was high emotion when Cardinal Ryłko solemnly announced that the beatification of John Paul II would take place on 1 May. The assembly rose to their feet and applauded for several minutes for the Pope who started WYDs and who had great love for young people. He had called himself ÂÂ a friend to young people, and a demanding friend ÂÂ. In 1985, the year of the first WYD, he said: ÂÂ the whole Church, in union with the Successor of Peter, feels ever more committed to youth at a global level, and to their anxieties and cares, and their sincerity and hopes. The Church wants to respond to their expectations and to communicate the certainty that is Christ ÂÂ (Address to the Roman Curia, 20 december 1985). Cardinal Rouco, immediately afterwards, announced that Blessed John Paul II would be one of the WYD patrons. This news led to renewed applause.\n\nDuring the meetings, the delegates representing countries and movements saw the directors of the various departments of the organisation take the stage to give them information. They provided details about the main events ÂÂ days in the dioceses, opening Mass, meetings with the Pope, catechesis, youth festival, way of the cross, vigil and final Mass ÂÂ, and about the practical details ÂÂ accommodation, meals, transport, registrations, translations, visas, volunteers, etc. The delegates were able to ask all the questions they liked and they also gave suggestions. The organising committee listened to everything and showed themselves willing to adapt in order to meet the needs of everyone. For example, when there was a request for greater financial aid for the youth from poorer countries, there was real solidarity seen among the delegates. Some of them proposed specific solutions that are quite demanding.\n\nThe delegates were given the opportunity to visit the Cuatro Vientos airfield where the concluding Mass will be held. There was also an official reception at Madrid City Hall. The mayor, Alberto Ruiz Gal- lardón, said that he would do everything in his power for the participants to feel at home and for Madrid to be the most welcoming host city in the history of WYD.\n\nTimes together like mealtimes, celebrations and bus trips were opportunities for the delegates to get to know each other, exchange opinions, pray and experience the universality of the Church. It was like a miniature WYD.\n\nSome of the participants that we would like to mention include a representative of Turkmenistan, a country with one hundred and fifty Catholics; delegates from Brazil who hope that the youth from Amazonia will have the same opportunity to come to Madrid as the youth coming from the big cities, thanks to a fundraising project; a young delegate from Norway who divides her time between the Oslo Opera where she is working and the coordination of a group of sixty pilgrims who are planning to come to Madrid. The South African representative, Barbara Koornbally, spoke of how the youth in her country are preparing for the event. A copy of the WYD cross is going around the country (the original has been in Spain since September 2009) to prepare the youth for the Madrid meeting in August. The enthusiastic delegates all spoke about their groups. WYD will surely be wonderful as it will be the fruit of the communion and generosity of so many people ÂÂ organisers, national and diocesan delegates, leaders of movements and new communities, sponsors and twenty-two thousand young volunteers. We know that the Holy Spirit will not miss this appointment, but will, as always, lead the young people to Christ and allow them to experience the joy of being Christians and of belonging to the Church.\n\nActivities in the Sections\n\nMovements and new communities for the new evangelisation\n\nOn Saturday 25 June 2011 at the offices of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, we had one of our periodic meetings of senior staff and officials with representatives of ecclesial movements and international communities.\n\nIt was an opportunity to speak about the new evangelisation in view of the 13th ordinary general assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the theme Nova evangelizatio ad christianam fidem tradendam (7-28 October 2012).\n\nTaking as his starting point the recently published Lineamenta, Cardinal Stanisław Ryłko, president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, opened the meeting with an in-depth reflection that presented the principle contents of the document.\n\nAfter pointing out the importance for all sectors of the Church to prepare for the next Synod Assembly, he spoke of how ecclesial movements and new communities are historically involved as prime movers in the challenge of the new evangelisation. It is something very close to the heart of Blessed John Paul II and of Pope Benedict XVI who often mentions it.\n\nThe cardinal went on to say that in-depth reflection is necessary because nowadays there is a risk of allowing ÂÂ new evangelisation ÂÂ to become a kind of slogan that is often talked about but about which little is known and of which few people study the contents and underlying values.\n\nThe cardinal then quoted from numbers 15 and 29 of John Paul IIÂÂs apostolic letter Novo Millennio Ineunte and from Benedict XVIÂÂs homily at the Mass celebrated with the Swiss bishops on 7 November 2006, in order to show how the two popes have called all Catholics to be careful that being is given priority over doing: being Christians, being community and being Church.\n\nNew evangelisation should emanate from a renewed way of being Christians. The pedagogy of faith generated in the charism, gives life to the renewal of all baptised people. Ecclesial movements and new communities have an extraordinary ability to bring forth missionary enthusiasm and apostolic energy in so many Christians who did not realise that they had this aptitude.\n\nNew evangelisation can and should be an opportunity for renewal and rediscovery of the identity and beauty of oneÂÂs own charism. Cardinal Ryłko pointed out that a charism is given for the good of the Church and its mission, and this should bring us to renew our sense of awe and not fall into routine. We must not use these charismatic gifts for our own ends in the service of action. They must help people to be true Christians and to know that this is what they are.\n\nDiscussion then followed, and delegates from movements and communities gave their analysis and suggested concrete responses. In line with the ideas in the presentation, they said that the centre of the new evangelisation should be an encounter with the person of Jesus Christ. The crucified Christ teaches us about Love and saves us from death and the slavery of sin. This is why it is necessary to avoid dogmatic relativism and to aim for the rediscovery of personal experience, and to communicate and offer it to everyone. Some delegates spoke of the need to live our own charisms with humility and a spirit of gratitude. We should receive them as gifts and use them, not in competition with each other, but in unity with the Holy Father and in compliance with ecclesiastical authority so that we work together in communion with others and with the Church in the new evangelisation.\n\nEmphasis was also placed on the ability of movements and new communities to be instruments of unity within the Church and also in the service of ecumenism, dialogue with other faiths and with all of humanity.\n\nWe also spoke of the importance of listening to the word of God and of prayer as sources of renewal of our Christian essence. Mention was made of the example of the great Christians of past centuries and of so many martyrs, even today. Attention was placed on the importance of community living. It helps us to rediscover our identity as baptised people as we witness to a new style of life, a characteristic of the new evangelisation. We spoke of the importance of witnesses which is greater than that of teachers with regard to ecclesial maturity. This is the primary objective of all ecclesial movements and new communities, and it must encourage us to find the essentiality of life rooted in the Gospel and to witness to the true joy of living with Christ. The importance of parishes in the new evangelisation was spoken of during the discussions and the role of priests in welcoming the fruits that the Holy Spirit gives the Church. Some people spoke of the special relationship that links ecclesial movements and new communities to the Successor of Peter. This gives unity and confers authority on all baptised people who work associatively for the new evangelisation in the world and, perhaps foremost, within the Church itself.\n\nMany spoke of the important witness of Mary the Mother of God, the soul, heart and silent breath in the life of the Church, the sure guide and star of the new evangelisation.\n\nSome of the participants expressed the hope that ecclesial movements and new communities will be well represented at the next assembly of the Synod of Bishops.\n\nWith his concluding words, Cardinal Ryłko observed how it is necessary for each baptised person to work on his/her own ongoing conversion. This should be the real engine that moves Christian life and works of apostolate. He reminded us of the three laws of the new evangelisation that the then- Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger spoke of at the Jubilee for catechists and religion teachers (10 December 2000). There is the law of expropriation which says that we are not the cause of the new evangelisation. It is the Holy Spirit, it is God whom we must ask with our prayers to open our hearts for an encounter with Christ. The mustard-seed law says that GodÂÂs way of administration favours the smallest, and it is from this that great things emerge. There are no easy successes. There is patient planting, and the results are in GodÂÂs hands. The law of the seed that falls into the ground and dies tells us that, in the life of the Church, ever since ChristÂÂs sacrifice on the cross, all that is great has been obtained through martyrdom.\n\nThe president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity concluded by reminding all present that the Holy Father, ever attentive and interested in the movements and new communities, was celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of his priestly ordination.\n\nThe final part of the meeting was given to updating those present about World Youth Day which is to take place in Madrid from 16 to 21 August 2011, and about the organisation of a pan-African congress of Catholic laity on the theme ÂÂ Salt of the earth, light of the world ÂÂ which will take place in Yaoundé, Cameroon, from 3 to 9 September 2012.\n\nSafeguarding the humanum created male and female\n\nWe are about to publish the result of a consultation made in 2010 by the WomenÂÂs Section to a wide group of women who lend their collaboration to our dicastery. We invited them to give John Paul IIÂÂs Letter to Women another reading and to comment on it in light of todayÂÂs challenges. They were to evaluate, at the same time, the cultural and social consequences of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, the occasion on which the Holy Father wrote the letter. This publication will present a synthesis of the contributions we received and it will be available in print in four languages: English, French, Italian and Spanish.\n\nBenedict XVI, in his address to the Roman Curia on 22 December 2008, emphasised the need to defend creation. He noted that one aspect of that defence today concerns the protection of humankind from self-destruction. We need real ÂÂ human ecology ÂÂ that respects the order of creation in which humanity exists as male and female. The Pope pointed out that the order of creation has a language, and to disregard it would bring about the destruction of humankind itself, diverted by a false idea of freedom and equality. In this regard he made explicit reference to the use of the term ÂÂ gender ÂÂ and its associated ideology being used to promote a culture that tries to emancipate humankind from creation and the Creator. The Pope invited the whole Church to strive to promote a correct vision of humankind.\n\nThe experts read the Letter to Women in the light of the evolution of the feminine question from 1995 until now, and their conclusions are fully in line with those of the Holy Father. They agree on the need to develop our rich Christian anthropology which they would offer to the men and women of our times as an antidote to the prevailing confusion. The strongest criticism was for the view held that human nature is an impediment to individual freedom, and for the mistaken idea that each oneÂÂs identity can be constructed on the basis of whims and impulse.\n\nWe need to create and organise courses in Christian anthropology for adults, youth and children. This instruction should nourish and support an experience of shared opinion that can withstand the programmes being imposed by the dominant culture and that are rapidly changing peopleÂÂs way of thinking. The Church has the role of safeguarding the truth about humankind and it must use every way possible to make it known.\n\nOur booklet is intended to be a small contribution to this task of education for the safeguarding of the humanum, created male and female.\n\nChurch and Sport Section: future plans\n\nWith the recent publication in English and Italian of ÂÂ Sport, Education, Faith: a new Season for Catholic Sport Associations ÂÂÂÂ the proceedings of a seminar held in November 2009 ÂÂ, the Church and Sport Section has completed the first phase of research composed of a trilogy of seminars and publications. Our 2005 publication: ÂÂ The World of Sport Today: Field of Christian Mission ÂÂ offers a broad perspective on the wide world of sport and the opportunities and challenges with respect to the ChurchÂÂs mission.\n\nTaking into account the worldwide ÂÂ educational emergency ÂÂ, our 2008 publication: ÂÂ Sport: an Educational and Pastoral Challenge ÂÂ explored sportÂÂs potential to be a means of fostering complementary human development, and it sought to solicit assistance, especially that of the clergy, in renewing the ChurchÂÂs attention towards the formative aspects of sport.\n\nFollowing along these same lines, our most recent seminar proceedings published in 2011: ÂÂ Sport, Education, Faith ÂÂ focused on the rich opportunities that the multitude of Catholic youth sport associations provide in assisting youth in their human and spiritual development. This is especially true when the Catholic laity who organise and animate these sporting activities are people of faith, inspired by Catholic principles.\n\nThese seminars have helped us to better realise sportÂÂs significant relevance in the lives of so many people. While the Second Vatican Council sought to awaken in the Church a careful reading and discernment of the signs of the times and treated of sport in two of its conciliar documents, it was Blessed Pope John Paul II who noted that sport has grown today to the point of being considered ÂÂ almost a sign of the times capable of interpreting humanityÂÂs new needs and new expectations ÂÂ (Sports Jubilee, 29 October 2000).\n\nAt the same time, we have come to see how vast and ambiguous the concept of ÂÂ sport ÂÂ is as it readily applies to a phenomenon that is both watched and played by millions on a daily basis; it is an activity that is at once a business and a pastime. Because sport suffers from this ambiguity and is prone to manipulation, many have expressed to us a need they see for a document by the Pontifical Council for the Laity that would offer a Christian perspective of sporting activity which helps to place it in a perspective that is at the service of the human person and not vice versa. There have also been requests for some practical guidelines and general ethical principles that could help ensure sportÂÂs educational dimension and favor its role in the work of youth evangelisation. Thus, while the findings from these past three seminars can serve as a basis for such a document, we are now conducting further studies and research in different areas.\n\nFor these purposes, we have solicited the collaboration of two groups in a particular way. On one hand, a broad philosophical, anthropological and theological investigation of ÂÂ sport as a sign of the times ÂÂ is being undertaken by an ad hoc working group of scholars affiliated with the ÂÂ Church and Sport ÂÂ Research Group of the German Catholic BishopsÂÂ Conference. In fact, this collaboration dates back to a unique international seminar of Catholic sport theologians that was organised by the ÂÂChurch and Sport ÂÂ Research Group of the German Catholic Bishops Conference and the ÂÂChurch and Sport ÂÂ Section of this Pontifical Council that was held in Mainz in 2007. The proceedings of this seminar, which were originally published in German as: Sport und Christentum: Eine anthropologische, theologische und pastorale Herausforderung (Grünewald 2009) have recently been updated and translated into English as they will soon be published by Catholic University of America Press. Meanwhile, our ÂÂ Church and Sport Section is currently reflecting on a draft document that this group has produced and which is an excellent synthesis of the fruit of the scholarship from the Mainz seminar.\n\nFurthermore, our ÂÂChurch and Sport ÂÂ Section is also working in close collaboration with the ÂÂOffice for Tourism, Free Time and Sport ÂÂ of the Italian BishopsÂÂ Conference (C.E.I.) which has created a sort of ÂÂ think tank ÂÂ together with our Church and Sport section and the Foundation Giovanni Paolo II per lo sport. This network of Italian sport scholars and those engaged in this field of pastoral ministry have already begun to meet periodically to discuss the vital need for sporting activities to be open to the personÂÂs spiritual dimension in order to truly flourish and to further explore certain educational and pastoral principles to be kept in mind when conducting sporting activities for the youth.\n\nIt is our hope that the results of these investigations will provide a more ample foundation for a future document about sport that offers a Christian perspective of this global phenomenon and some key ethical principles and practical guidelines that will help ensure sportÂÂs educational dimension.\n\nIn the meanwhile, this Section also welcomes opportunities to assist the local Church, especially at the national level, in providing materials, resources, and some of the ÂÂ best practices ÂÂ that are being implemented around the world in this field of pastoral ministry. For this purpose, we certainly welcome the establishment of a type of liaison or office for sport related ministry within the national bishopsÂÂ conferences that could serve as a liaison with our office for ongoing dialogue and collaboration regarding future seminars and other initiatives at the international and regional levels.\n\nPope Benedict XVI, in the message he offered the participants of our last seminar, succinctly offers us some very clear goals to be pursued: ÂÂ In our time when an urgent need to educate the new generations is evident it is therefore necessary for the Church to continue to support sports for youth, making the most of their positive aspectsÂÂ to avoid every trend that perverts the nature of sports ÂÂ and to help people welcome the many valuable opportunities that sports can offer in the pastoral care of youth ÂÂ (November 3, 2009). Thus, it is our hope that our ongoing research and findings may give support to sportÂÂs positive aspects, caution against possible deviations, and promote the opportunities that sport can offer for the pastoral care of youth.\n\nJuridical recognition and approval of statutes\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Laity:\n\n· by decree of 2 March 2011 approved the modifications made in the statutes of the International Coordination of Young Christian Workers (ICYCW).\n\n· By decree of 23 March 2011 it suppressed the International Catholic Union of the Press (UCIP).\n\n· By decree of 29 June 2011 it suppressed the association Communauté des Béatitudes since it will be newly recognised as an Ecclesial Family of Consecrated Life.\n\nThe Dicastery is presently studying the demands for canonical recognition submitted by the following groups: Schoenstatt Apostolic Movement, Movimiento de la Palabra de Dios, Legio Mariae, Communauté du Chemin Neuf, Movimiento Athletae Christi, Movimento Apostolico, Jesus Youth, Movimiento de Retiros Parroquiales Juan XXIII, Via Pacis, International Community of the Divine Savior, Eis aí tua Mãe.\n\nA new under-secretary\n\nOn 14 May 2011 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Prof. Guzmán Carriquiry as secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. This appointment demonstrates the esteem in which the Pope holds our ex-under-secretary. Guzmán Carriquiry now works directly with the president of the Commission, the prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet. He has left the Pontifical Council for the Laity after decades of service that began on 1 December 1971.\n\nHe worked in the Consilium de laicis first, and then in the newly established Pontifical Council for the Laity. Then on 12 September 1991, John Paul II appointed him under-secretary, a position that was confirmed during that pontificate and reconfirmed by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 February 2009.\n\nAfter working for the laity for many years, Prof. Carriquiry was entrusted with this important responsibility towards the Church in Latin America. His long experience and his passion for the Church will certainly help him to competently fill this role with a spirit of service towards the ÂÂ continent of hope ÂÂ.\n\nMsgr Miguel Delgado Galindo has taken over from Prof. Carriquiry as under-secretary. News of this appointment made by Pope Benedict XVI was made public on Saturday 18 June 2011. Msgr Miguel Delgado Galindo, until now bureau chief in the Pontifical Council for the Laity, was born on 22 May 1963 in Barcelona near the monumental basilica of the Sagrada Familia. From 1985 he has belonged to the prelature of Opus Dei. He graduated in law from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. He is particularly happy to say that he was one of the young participants at World Youth Day in Santiago de Compostela in 1989. After working in his profession as a lawyer for some time and having worked in the public administration of Catalonia, in 1991 he transferred to Rome to continue ecclesiastical studies in theology and canon law at the Holy Cross Pontifical University. In 1996 he obtained his doctorate in canon law. That same year he received priestly ordination in the Roman basilica of SantÂÂEugenio a Valle Giulia. He returned to Spain to work in ministry. In 1999 he was recalled to Rome to work in the Pontifical Council for the Laity. After a few years he became bureau chief in charge of the section for associations and movements. He has written monographs and articles for canon law journals.\n\nThe senior staff and colleagues of the dicastery are certain that Msgr Delgado will bring to his new task all the experience of these years of service in the dicastery. Much of it comes from his many meetings and conversations with numerous associations, movements and new communities that he has come to know very well.\n\nAngelo and Enzo take retirement\n\nIn March 2011, two of our colleagues who have been working in this dicastery since 1973 retired from active service. They are Angelo Sala, our librarian, and Vincenzo Ussia, our protocol officer. We shall miss the kindness and generosity they showed to their colleagues, old and new. They take with them a large part of the history of the dicastery. They were among the first staff taken on in the newly founded Consilium de laicis which then became the Pontifical Council for the Laity. We wish to convey to them our gratitude and best wishes that the Lord may bless them in this new stage of their lives.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the LaityÂÂs new website\n\nSince 30 April 2011 the Pontifical Council for the Laity has a new website: www.laici.va. This has been planned for some time. It is intended to give news of the work and activities of this dicastery of the Holy See in the service of the lay faithful, in a more complete and more immediate way. Many of our members and consultors, past and present, have been waiting for this web space, as have close collaborators of the dicastery.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Laity has been on the internet for some time on the Holy See website (vatican.va). In 2007 it was decided to reorganise the material and data in order to have a clearer and more organic presentation of information on this dicastery of the Roman Curia. At the same time we had the website laici.org to promote the various events of the dicastery (congresses, seminars, plenary assemblies, etc.) and to make known the activities of the Youth and WomenÂÂs Sections.\n\nThe website laici.va is now the official website of the dicastery, an open window to all its activities. As much as possible, these are presented in our four official languages ÂÂ English, French, Italian and Spanish ÂÂ and with a graphical presentation rich in images.\n\nIn addition to a detailed description of its structure (a profile of the institution, senior staff, section heads, secretariat, members and consultors), there is now a substantial number of pages about what is happening in the Sections. There is the Section for lay associations, ecclesial movements and new communities; for youth ministry, with particular attention to World Youth Day; for the vocation and mission of women in the Church and in the world; for the relations of the Church with the world of sport. Some pages of the website contain articles on themes concerning the lay faithful and their engagement with the world. These contributions come from the senior staff, section heads and also from close collaborators. There is also news about the recognition and approval of statutes of new associations, about new programmes in the dicastery, and about the latest publications. Events like seminars, continental congresses of lay Catholics, youth forums and plenary assemblies of members and consultors, all have ample space on laici.va with photos, videos and texts of lectures. In this way visitors to the website can ÂÂ take part ÂÂ in these activities.\n\nThe website was developed by the Vatican Internet Service, and it was the first created by that office with the new web content management system, a modern technology that allows text and images to be added in a new and agile way so that it can be updated immediately.\n\nMany people have been enthusiastic about the website, and email messages of appreciation continued to arrive for a few days after it was launched.\n\nBishopsÂÂ Conferences have also sent communications of appreciation. These include those of Canada, the Philippines and the Catholic Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria in Egypt.\n\nWe had almost eight thousand visitors to the website in the month of May and over ninety thousand pages were visited. The highest number of hits came from Italy, but this was closely followed by Spain and Argentina, and then by the United States, France, Brazil, Mexico and Germany. The most consulted documents were those in the WomenÂÂs Section.\n\nFinally, we feel we must mention the fact that the date chosen for the launch of the website was 30 April, the day before the beatification of John Paul II. There was a motive for this: it was a tribute to the pontiff who had given such huge encouragement to the lay apostolate and to the new season of associations of the faithful. He is the pope who thought of starting World Youth Day, and he always gave attention to the ÂÂ feminine genius ÂÂ and to all areas in which the laity are called to witness to Christ.\n\nAd limina visits\n\nBetween the end of 2010 and the first part of 2011, the Pontifical Council for the Laity had the opportunity to meet all three groups of bishops from the Philippines BishopsÂÂ Conference, divided in this way to facilitate their ad limina apostolorum visit. Aside from Timor Leste, the Philippines is the only country in Asia that has a majority Catholic population. The Church in the Philippines is subdivided into 86 ecclesiastical circumscriptions. Weekly church attendance is between 10% and 20%, and lay participation in pastoral ministry is very active. Popular piety is very much alive. It is seen mostly in patron saint festivals, devotions like novenas and processions, and in the high numbers of confraternities.\n\nSome of the bishops and a large group of lay faithful took part in the Congress of Catholic Laity in Asia that our dicastery organised recently in Seoul on the theme ÂÂ Proclaiming Jesus Christ in Asia today ÂÂ. On that occasion it was clearly seen that the Church in the Philippines is very important in Asia. It has, and will continue to have, an important role in evangelisation. The bishops are aware of this role and try not to be completely absorbed by local problems.\n\nOn 18 February this year, the Holy Father, when speaking to the second group of bishops, pointed out the important role of the Church in difficult social situations like those in the Philippines: ÂÂWhile the Philippines continues to face many challenges in the area of economic development, we must recognize that these obstacles to a life of happiness and fulfilment are not the only stumbling blocks that must be addressed by the Church. Filipino culture is also confronted with the more subtle questions inherent to the secularism, materialism, and consumerism of our times. When self-sufficiency and freedom are severed from their dependence upon and completion in God, the human person creates for himself a false destiny and loses sight of the eternal joy for which he has been made. The path to rediscovering humanityÂÂs true destiny can only be found in the re-establishment of the priority of God in the heart and mind of every person. Above all, to keep God at the center of the life of the faithful, your preaching and that of your clergy must be personal in its focus so that each Catholic will grasp in his or her innermost depths the life-transforming fact that God exists, that he loves us, and that in Christ he answers the deepest questions of our lives. Your great task in evangelization is therefore to propose a personal relationship with Christ as key to complete fulfilment ÂÂ. The Church in the Philippines is making great efforts in this regard. For the past fifteen years the bishops have been giving much encouragement to the participation of the laity. They have a considerable number of commissions and councils to support and coordinate pastoral ministry both at national and diocesan levels. A very large number of the faithful take part. Without their contribution it would be impossible to manage with even ordinary pastoral ministry. In particular, there is one very active body for the coordination of the Laity (LAIKO) which is supported by the bishopsÂÂ conference. Many lay people carry out a ministry: of the Eucharist, religious instruction, biblical apostolate and various liturgical tasks.\n\nThe Pope insists that the religious instruction of the lay faithful should be the first concern of bishops: ÂÂ The deep personal piety of your people needs to be nourished and supported by a profound understanding of and appreciation for the teachings of the Church in matters of faith and morals ÂÂ (3 March 2011). An effective response to the need for instruction is given by the base communities (BECs). Much pastoral energy goes into the project of organising the faithful into small territorial communities, subdivisions of parishes in the cities and the countryside. The animators of these communities are lay people who work together with the priest. In the communities there is religious instruction, liturgies (or paraliturgies) conducted by a lay delegate, and there is distribution of communion by an extraordinary minister of the Eucharist. Communities also show solidarity with the poor. With regard to lay movements and their contribution to religious instruction and Christian life, Benedict XVI emphasised in his address that ÂÂ the Church in the Philippines is fortunate to have a number of lay organizations which continue to draw people to the Lord. In order to confront the questions of our times, the laity need to hear the Gospel message in its fullness, to understand its implications for their personal lives and for society in general, and thus be constantly converted to the Lord. I therefore urge you to take special care in shepherding such groups, so that the primacy of God may remain in the forefront ÂÂ. Movements and new communities are plentiful, both international and local organisations. These include a great number of charismatic movements of different kinds. The international movement that supports families, Couples for Christ; is originally from the Philippines. Other groups present are the Cursillos, Focolarini, Knights of Columbus, Legio Mariae, Neocatechumenal Way. There are also ÂÂ third orders ÂÂ like the Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and others.\n\nThe Pope wishes to emphasise that the primacy of God ÂÂ is of particular importance when it comes to the evangelization of youth. I am happy to note that, in your country, the faith plays a very important role in the lives of many young people, a fact that is due in large part to the patient work of the local Church to reach out to the youth at all levels. I encourage you to continue to remind young people that the glamour of this world will not satisfy their natural desire for happiness. Only true friendship with God will break the bonds of loneliness from which our fragile humanity suffers and will establish a true and lasting communion with others, a spiritual bond that will readily prompt within us the wish to serve the needs of those we love in Christ ÂÂ. Asian Youth Day in 2009 was held in the diocese of Imus.\n\nIt was generally agreed that the participation of the laity in public life can be regarded as positive, although problems exist. There are many Catholics involved in politics, and a high number of these have been educated in Catholic schools. A reproductive health bill has been proposed which includes State financing for the distribution of contraceptives and the introduction of sex education as an obligatory subject in schools. It is based on unacceptable principles, and some Catholics were among those who proposed it. However, there are Catholic politicians who speak out in opposition to any efforts to introduce laws that go against life and the family. A large number of parishes have a Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting that aims to provide information that will help discernment during elections. The bishops foster initiatives to make the principles of the social doctrine of the Church more widely known.\n\nThe Maronite Patriarch visits the Pontifical Council for the Laity\n\nOn 15 April last, the Pontifical Council for the Laity had the honour of a visit by the Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites, His Beatitude Béchara Boutros El Raï, O.M.M.. He was accompanied by fifteen bishops and several priests, as well as prominent Lebanese experts on politics, economics and journalism. Although this was the first visit by the Patriarch of the Maronites to our dicastery, there has been close collaboration for some time between the Pontifical Council for the Laity and the Churches of the Middle East, in particular the Church in Lebanon. The first Congress of the laity in the Middle East was organised together with our dicastery and held in Beirut in June 1997. Following this, in spite of the political difficulties that gripped the country, the Lebanese Church continued to support the instruction and engagement of the laity with a large number of very good initiatives. The Synod of Bishops held in the Vatican in October 2010 was very useful for the whole of the Middle East. Meanwhile, national congresses of the Catholic laity were held around the region.\n\nThe visit by the Patriarch signals a new stage on the path of pastoral growth of a Church that must face up to the huge difficulties each day brings, between political instability and relations that are not always easy with other religious groups. The key role of the Maronite Church for the whole of the Middle East was mentioned by the Holy Father when he received the Patriarch the day before the visit to our dicastery. The Pope referred to the Synod of 2010 and emphasised ÂÂ the urgent need to propose the Gospel anew to people who are barely familiar with it or who have drifted away from the Church ÂÂ especially because ÂÂ this region of the world, which the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Christ himself blessed by their presence and their preaching, aspires to the enduring peace that the word of Truth can establish when it is welcomed and lived out ÂÂ.\n\nDrawing on the words spoken by Benedict XVI, a productive conversation took place between the patriarch and the Pontifical Council for the Laity. We recalled the special relationship that links our dicastery with the Council for the Apostolate of the Laity in Lebanon led by Most Rev. Georges Bou-Jaoudé, C.M. who was present at the meeting, and with the Commission for the Apostolate of the Laity in the Middle East connected to the Council of Eastern Catholic Patriarchs. We spoke of issues on which we are collaborating: accompaniment of 43 associations and movements present in Lebanon; youth ministry and participation in World Youth Day where Lebanese bishops have often been bishop-catechists, including the present Patriarch; womenÂÂs ministry; the engagement of the laity in the Church and the world, at professional, cultural and political levels; religious education at different levels and sports pastoral ministry. We spoke too of the current situation of the Arab world where there are great social tensions. Finally we spoke about the project being drawn up jointly by the Pontifical Council for the Laity and the Council of Eastern Catholic Patriarchs to call another Congress for the Laity of the Middle East in Lebanon, probably in the second half of 2012.\n\nThe latest publications\n\nLaity Today collection\n\nÂÂ Testimoni di Cristo nella comunità politica, Proceedings of the 24th Plenary Assembly of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, Rome, 20-22 May 2010.\n\nÂÂ Proclaiming Jesus Christ in Asia Today, Congress of Asian Catholic Laity, Seoul, South Korea, 31 August to 5 September 2010.\n\nÂÂ Sport, Education, Faith: Towards a New Season for Catholic Sports Associations, International Seminar, Vatican, 6-7 November 2009.\n\nwith associations and movements\n\nDuring the first semester of the year, Cardinal Stanisław Ryłko, president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, met with leaders and representatives of the following movements, associations and new communities: The Institute for World Evangelisation - ICPE Mission; Pope John XXIII Community Association; The Teresian Association; The Neocatechumenal Way; International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services (ICCRS); Emmanuel Community; Azione Cattolica Italiana; SantÂÂEgidio Community; Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships; Christian Life Movement; Couples for Christ; World Union of Catholic WomenÂÂs Organisations (WUCWO); Christian Life Community; Sodalitium Christianae Vitae; International Catholic Conference of Guiding (ICCG); International Coordination of Young Christian Workers (CIJOC-ICYCW); Madonna House Apostolate; Emmanuel School of Mission; Chemin Neuf Community; Prayer and Life Workshops (TOV); Opera di Nazaret; Evangelization 2033; Rinnovamento nello Spirito Santo; Shalom Catholic Community; Claire Amitié; Focolare Movement; Missionary Community of Villaregia; Encounters of Married Couples (Dialogues); Renewal Ministries; Fraternity of Communion and Liberation.\n\nÂÂ On 5 January Cardinal Ryłko spoke during the annual retreat of the Focolare members on the topic: ÂÂ Spiritual retreats: a time to rediscover the important things ÂÂ.
