My plan is to hide a notebook inside the Sistine Chapel, open a spreadsheet application and start to count votes for the new pope election.\n\nThe following list contains the name of the 115 candidates to become the new pope. In the whole process, data is manually tabulated according to the voting ballots, and every cardinal annotates in his own vota scrutinii the number of votes for each candidate. It's still ruled by ink and paper.\n\nNow, it's just a matter of exporting data to .csv and use Nicola Talbot's awesome datatool package in order to generate a beautiful report for the cardinals! But wait a minute, we still need to keep up the tradition, ink and pen.\n\nThanks to my buddy percusse, it's TikZ time! Let's fake some handwriting annotation for the votes! The idea here is very simple: get the number of votes, generate a TikZ picture with a visual representation of the current number and present it.\n\nFirst things first.

Now, I'd love to improve the code and add, if possible, the following features:\n\nA cardinal is elected pope if he obtains 2/3 of all votes. If one the candidates reach this number, we could add a nice blue circle around his name in the list, and probably a note with Habemus Papam! near it. That way, the lazy cardinals will easily spot the elected one. :)\n\nIf no one reaches 2/3 of the votes, at least we now have a perspective of the voting scheme, like the top voted cardinals, which will influence the next voting sessions. My idea is, if no cardinal reaches 2/3 of all votes, let's add a nice red circle around the names of the 5 top voted cardinals, so we can easily spot the trend going on. :)\n\nFeel free to add more features if you like. :)\n\nWell, that's it. Hope you guys like the initial code and idea. :) Now, we need to kindly ask egreg or Claudio Fiandrino to go to Rome and convince the cardinals to use our proposal. It will be way funnier. :)\n\nAny help is appreciated. :)\n\nBackground\n\nBeing catholic, the election of a new pope is a milestone for me. Actually, with Pope Benedict XVI resigning, this will be the second election I watch - Pope John Paul II was elected in 1978, a few years before I was born, but of course I watched Cardinal Ratzinger being elected. :) I even saw the white smoke on television!\n\nMy dad used to tell me a lot of stories from past elections. I think the whole process is quite amusing, specially the way cardinals vote for their candidates.\n\nCardinal José Freire Falcão, former archbishop of Brasília, gave a very nice interview to a Brazilian website in which he showed documents from the last conclave. This is the voting ballot, where the cardinal writes down the name of his choice. After every cardinal casts his vote, it's time to tabulate data! This is done in this other document, called vota scrutinii."
