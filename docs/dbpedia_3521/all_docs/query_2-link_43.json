        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAlbert (Michel Galabru) is fired from his company, although he is a brilliant computer expert. But now he sits around at home, in a flat with his niece and her husband, falls more and more into alcohol and increasingly loses his sanity. After some time, when he has finally succumbed to madness, he begins to focus his abilities on a murderous plan. Albert develops a technology that allows him to send lethal rays through television cameras without even having to be there. He uses this technique to kill television presenters live on screen, one by one. The police put Inspector Romain Pascot (Richard Bohringer) on the case, and soon the noose seems to be tightening around Albert’s neck…\n\nComments about the movie\n\n“Kamikaze – TV Death Live is definitely a little insider tip – not only for Luc Besson fans!” (Retro-Film.com)\n\n“Co-scripted and produced by Luc Besson (who gave direction to his former assistant), Kamikaze is an ambitious if somewhat thin satire on a society enthralled by the bland production of cinema.” (timeout.com)\n\n“Impressive French film (from a script by Luc Besson) about an unemployed man who gets so annoyed with television announcers that he invents a gun to kill them by remote control…” (filmblitz.org)\n\n“TV Death Live – Kamikaze is a classic B-movie that combines science fiction with a dash of crime and thriller, and it kicks off with an interesting premise. The idea of killing people over the TV while they are in a live programme is clever…” (sofahelden.com)\n\n“I really enjoyed the film, you can tell a top producer was at work, it was Luc Besson. The film has a great ending, is exciting and in my opinion belongs in every collection.” (mediennerd.de)\n\n“Kamikaze – TV Death Live is a futuristic thriller in which Michel Galabru and Richard Bohringer are convincing leads as outlaw and sheriff.” (poenack.de)"
