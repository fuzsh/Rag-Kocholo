Nonetheless, we can start off with the real Buzz, his robot cat companion, and recruits Izzy, Mo, and Darby. Tune in as Chris Evans captains the effort against a Brolin-voiced antagonist.

The victim is James Houghland. He has brazenly refused to sell his invention by which television signals can be instantaneously sent anywhere in the world.

When the initial broadcast doesn’t stay “live” for Mr. H, it is up to Chief Nelson to root through the many suspects.\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\n5:15 a.m. Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)\n\nRated G (131 min)\n\nDirector: Robert Wise\n\nWith William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley\n\nFormat: DCP\n\nGive them a V. Give them a G. Give them an E. Give them an R. What’s that spell? Umm… Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty, and Uhura (RIP Nichelle Nichols) warp the small screen into the big screen for the first time. Other “carbon units” on the Enterprise have a rough go of it, redshirted or not, as Admiral Kirk insists on taking the helm once again.\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\n7:55 a.m. The Flying Saucer (1950)\n\nRated Approved (69 min)\n\nDirector: Mikel Conrad\n\nWith Mikel Conrad, Pat Garrison, Hantz von Teuffen\n\nFormat: TBA\n\nCall them unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) or unidentified flying objects (UFO), but let’s abbreviate things. Advice to the adjective crew describing this entry as an “independently made American black-and-white science fiction spy film drama.” User reviews say this movie shows a lot more Alaskan scenery than aliens or spaceships. Despite its status as the earliest feature-length flying saucer film, the odd efforts of the Russians and Americans will likely be more memorable for laughability.\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\n9:15 a.m. Morbius (2022)\n\nRated PG-13 (104 min)\n\nDirector: Daniel Espinosa\n\nWith Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona\n\nFormat: DCP\n\nDangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others from the same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. While at first it seems a success, a darkness inside of him is soon unleashed. Jared Leto tries not to suck while trading universes and Matt Smith makes the cast a real who’s who. What could go wrong experimenting with chemicals, electroshock, vampire bats, or new extended Marvel storylines?\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\n11:15 a.m. SURPRISE 2: Beyond the Time Barrier (1960)\n\nNoit Rated (74 min)\n\nDirector: Edgar G.

In this case, it's about 60,000 miles of total undersea travel, as opposed to an impossible depth measurement. Jules Verne wrote the novel bound to inspire this and other films in 1870. Though the invention of submarines dates back to the 16th century, Verne’s writing typically predicted future advances in technology. Perhaps this makes Captain Nemo an omen as well. This early silent film version incorporates elements from both the 1875 novel The Mysterious Island and 20,000 Leagues.\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\nLive score performed by Jeff Rapsis.\n\n6:10 p.m. Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nRated PG (105 min)\n\nDirector: Ivan Reitman\n\nWith Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver\n\nFormat: 70mm Film\n\nOh, you KNOW who you’re gonna call. Try your best to clear your mind and not think of anything. Journey back to New York, NY, the city so nice they haunted it twice. At least. Don’t cross the streams, be careful of the ectoplasm slime splash zone, and get ready to sing along for the O.G. (original Ghostbusters) projected on 70mm film.\n\nRead more about it at the IMDb\n\n8:10 p.m. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961)\n\nRated PG (105 min)\n\nDirector: Irwin Allen\n\nWith Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden\n\nFormat: TBA\n\nThe Van Allen radiation belt has caught fire. That is what Harriman Nelson and his crew discover when bringing a nuclear submarine up from beneath the Arctic Ocean. Though our hero has a plan to save Earth from destruction, the United Nations is unconvinced.
