        "text": "L22 History 101C Western Civilization\n\nThis course is a history of Western civilization from 3500 BC to AD 1600. Western civilization may be characterized as one long debate on the holy. In no other civilization did this debate about the limits of the sacred and the profane -- this constant effort at trying to grasp the divine through word and deed -- last continuously for more than 5000 years. To argue over the holy is to argue over the very nature of how to live a life, from the most mundane daily activity to the most sublime act of the imagination. It is to argue over how politics, economics, art, philosophy, literature, and religion are realized in a society. Apart from many types of polytheism, we study the three great world monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We study the ancient cultures of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the empires of Alexander the Great and imperial Rome, the Christianization of the Roman Empire and the rise of Islam, the early medieval world in the North Sea and the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople, the formation of Latin Christendom and the papal monarchy, the Crusades and the reaction of the Islamic lands, concepts of individuality, the persecution of Jews and heretics, chivalry and peasant servitude, the Mongol Empire, the Black Death and the devastation of the 14th century, the Renaissance in Italy and the Protestant reformation, the hunt for witches and the scientific revolution, and the medieval origins of the African diaspora and the European conquest of the Americas. What defined being human -- and so a man, a woman, or a child -- over five millennia? Fundamental questions of this course include the following: What is \"Western civilization\"? When do the characteristics defined as \"Western\" come together as a coherent phenomenon? What, then, is historical truth? This course (through lectures, reading primary sources, discussion sections, and essay writing) gives the student a learned background in almost 5000 years of history. This is an introductory course for the history major and minor.\n\nCredit 3 units.

Although the virulence of the discussions may have given us the impression that this was a new issue, in reality the question of the Jews' role and involvement in Jesus' death has been disputed for almost two thousand years. The claim that the Jews are responsible for Christ's death is the subject of this class and we will study its history from the gospels to today using textual sources (historical, religious and literary works) and the visual arts (paintings and movies). But this class is not about who did or did not kill Jesus, nor is it about judging people's positions on the issue. Rather it is about the power of a story to travel through time and space, to being told and retold in different versions and with different purposes, and to affect the real lives of men and women.

What produced these developments in European social, economic, and political spheres and how did these different currents diverge and converge? How did European developments affect global actors and vice versa? What are the consequences for our own time of these contradictory aspects of Europe's modernization? Class assignments include textbook and primary source reading (c. 75 pages/week), discussion participation, 2 short analytical papers, 3 in-class exams, and a final cumulative take-home essay.

Students will be exposed to major theories concepts, processes, frameworks, and scholars of race. They will develop the skills and language to critically examine and discuss race, with emphasis on how conceptions of race and collective identity have deep historical roots and have changed over time. This course takes the position that race-like gender, class and sexuality-is socially constructed. That said, while race is socially constructed, this course also emphasizes that racialization and racial categories have social, political, and economic consequences in people's everyday lives. Meaning the socially and historically constructed category of race has real implications for people and communities. Ultimately, the purpose of the course is to teach students to read, think and write critically about one of today's most contentious topics-race-by exposing them to readings and other course materials that consider race and the process of racialization in specific contexts and time periods throughout the world.\n\nSame as L90 AFAS 1130\n\nCredit 3 units.

However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, excessively celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did \"South Asia\" become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? Why do discourses of sex and intimacy rise to the surface in this history, and what is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America?

However, new hybrid forms of writing-from historical fiction, to docudramas, to fictionalized biographies-have led to the blurring of the boundary and encouraged the claim that history itself is just another form of fiction. At the same time, historical novelists have placed increasing emphasis on the authenticity, sometimes even the accuracy, of their narratives and characterizations. And further still, contemporary writers are challenging dominant historical narratives by creating plausible fictions from the perspectives of the subordinated, the marginalized and the disenfranchised: plebeians, women, and indigenous, enslaved, and diasporic peoples. As historical novels become ever more popular, the distinction between history and fiction appears to be collapsing before our eyes. Through reading and discussing some outstanding examples of the genre of historical fiction published between the early nineteenth and the early twenty-first century (from Walter Scott to Charles Dickens, from Toni Morrison to Amitav Ghosh, from Graham Swift to Hilary Mantel), this course will investigate whether history is 'factual' or just another form of fiction; whether the appeal of historical fiction should lie in its authenticity; whether the recent success of historical novels should be viewed as a new development, or rather, as a revival of an older literary tradition; and whether novelists and dramatists are more adept than historians at interrogating issues of memory, identity, and change.\n\nCredit 3 units.

Their conflicting experiences and expectations created not only social and economic unrest, but also a resilient social infrastructure, a tradition of popular participation in politics, and a rich legacy of cultural accomplishment.

First imagined as an anti-majoritarian and anti-imperial idea, the nation came to be split between East and West Pakistan, with a hostile Indian nation dividing the country. The subsequent emergence of Bangladesh, from within, exposed the complexities of US imperial and Indian power, colonialism, identity, ethnicity, race, nationalism and repression. More recently, the War on Terror has once again exploited the ethnic and cultural conflicts produced by world histories of power and resistance. The events of the past two hundred years have undoubtedly and violently exacerbated the politicization of social and cultural identities. This course situates Pakistan in the context of pre-colonial social formations, British colonialism, internal colonialism, US imperialism, the Cold War, Soviet interests, Indian regional hegemony and then turns to the powerful and diverse struggles launched by its own citizens against these external forces. How did successive empires construct and politicize social identities, and how did people contest and adapt these? How did caste, gender, race and religion shape empire and anti-imperial histories? Our sources will be historical, ethnographic, and literary. We will cover topics such as colonial fantasies, decolonization, the political uses of social categories of tribe, caste, language and gender, the political economy of militarism, terrorism, 'development', activism, diasporic formations, poetry, music and art. The course will deepen our collective understanding of a critical series of developments in world history.

But what, beyond their disdain for the law, do they have in common, and why do they keep resurfacing in accounts of contemporary politics? This course will survey several outsider archetypes across 19th- and 20th-century Europe and its empires. We will ask: what does it mean to be \"outside\" of the community, and which mechanisms and spaces have historically produced and maintained this exclusion? With particular attention to the history of European imperialism, this course will analyze how images of outcasts and outlaws have been shaped by perceptions of gender, race, and class, and how they have produced distinct forms of management and policing. The class will also highlight the central role that mobility has played for this type of othering. Putting archetypes from the European underworld into conversation with one another and investigating their reconfigurations across time, we will systematically work out what function they perform for past and present society and what, if any, forms of resistance they afford.\n\nCredit 3 units.

To address the gaps in historical understandings that these absences may create, this course will provide a survey of the ways theological ideas and religiously-motivated social movements have shaped US politics and civic life from the Civil War to the present. With a particular emphasis placed on how religion intersects with other social categories such as race, gender, and class, it will examine the complex role that religious beliefs, practices, and identities have played in major political events and debates from the 1860s to today. In doing so, it will also inquire into what it means to study religion as a historical phenomenon, the theoretical and methodological tools that best assist in this work, and the historiographic implications of better attending to religion in historical analyses.

The history of slavery has long created a sense of unease within the consciousness of many Americans. Recognizing this continued reality, this seminar examines how slavery is both remembered and silenced within contemporary popular culture. Although slavery scholarship continues to expand, how do everyday Americans gain access to the history of bondage? Taking an interdisciplinary approach to these intriguing queries, we will examine a range of sources: literature, public history, art/poetry, visual culture, movies and documentaries, as well as contemporary music including reggae and hip hop. The centerpiece of this course covers North American society, however, in order to offer a critical point of contrast students will be challenged to explore the varied ways slavery is commemorated in others parts of the African Diaspora.\n\nCredit 3 units.

The notion of global markets and global citizens seems to have remained at best, an ideal. Meanwhile the world's majority has witnessed a staggering decline in education, nutrition, health and even physical mobility. Nowhere have these developments passed unquestioned: from the rise of the so-called Maoist insurgency in India to the Occupy movement in the US, people and especially the youth have expressed their outrage in creative and unconventional ways. This course plots the long and necessarily violent history of forging global interconnections. The lens for our analysis will be India, South Asia and their relationship with the United States. We will approach a range of novels, films and popular cultural artifacts as we build our own understanding of the nature, critique and promise of globalization.\n\nCredit 3 units.

The course aims to examine the attitudes, ideas, and values that have shaped the relationship, from the era of colonial expansion in the 1800s to the rise of China as a major political and economic power in the 21st century. Drawing upon visual images, literature, films, policy statements, and other materials, the course will analyze the patterns of perceptions that have informed and shaped the understanding of realities.

That story is relentlessly optimistic, and simultaneously, devoid of an understanding of gender, sexual difference or race. In this course, we take a different approach. We discard the more conventional \"metrics\" of globalization by focusing instead on another equally global story: the manner by which human beings have been gendered and racialized over time. Doing so allows us to revisit globalization through its own deceptions, its interconnected secrets. We confront a different set of questions: how has intimacy shaped global mobility, what is the relationship between caste and MAMAA, between custom and the movement of capital, between \"slums\" and scale, between outsourcing and incarceration, how does the normative family propel global racial regimes? Most crucially, how and why is the emotional and intimate story of globalization concealed? The seminar class utilizes a wide array of sources, historical documents, scholarly critiques, novels and film and largely considers the longer, global history of India as the case study. Our specific focus will be on the secretive interconnections of slavery, seclusion, settlers, servitude, surrogacy, and scholarship, as we take a deep dive into the disguises, and the more hidden aspects, of globalization.\n\nSame as L77 WGSS 270A\n\nCredit 3 units.

From the early modern period to the contemporary era, Beijing has served as the capital for imperial, early Republican, and revolutionary and post-socialist China. The city thus has been virtually synonymous with governmental power and elite politics. However, recent scholarship has shifted focus from the political perspective to uncovering the social and cultural changes at the grassroots. Notable scholarly works have demonstrated that the modernization impulse and the move to industrialization served to create the city's modern face. Administrative reforms gave rise to new conceptions and a host of institutions to manage social relief, public services, and legal and punitive institutions. The rise, fall, and subsequent revival of the consumer marketplace impacted cultural production and consumption. Mass (de)mobilization closed old venues while opening new possibilities for residents to understand and participate in politics. The recent English-language scholarship not only delineates forces that shaped the lives of millions of residents of Beijing but also situates their experience in the national and global context of modernization and revolution.\n\nSame as L04 Chinese 275\n\nCredit 3 units.

At the end of four years of the Trump presidency defined by racist discourse and policies, it culminated in an insurgent riot on the Capitol designed to block the peaceful transfer of power, the basis of American democracy. This course provides the long view to understanding this recent period in American and global history. We begin by defining key terms in the discussion around racism today, including what we mean by racism and what unites anti-Semitism, anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, but also notions like privilege, cultural appropriation, and microaggressions. We then move on to the long history of the category of race. We start with a unit on race and religion and then move on to the role of the discovery of the \"New World\" and the development of the Atlantic slave system, and its impact on the Enlightenment, which was the incubator for the concept of race. From there, we consider how fundamental race was to European and American colonial dominance by the end of the nineteenth-century and the role it played in racial states like Nazi Germany and South Africa. The last portion of the class will focus on struggles to dismantle racism over the the last century, considering the anti-colonial and Civil Rights movement, and the anti-apartheid struggle. Along the way, we will have addressed the overlaps and disconnects between anti-Black, anti-Jewish, and anti-Islamic racism and read a number of key thinkers and activists who can help us in the fight against racism.\n\nSame as L75 JIMES 2910\n\nCredit 3 units.

Since the 1970s, historians have attempted to show that 'microhistories' can powerfully illuminate the grand sweep of history. By narrowing their focus to magnify the small, the particular, and the local, 'microhistorians' have argued that studies of apparently inconsequential subjects can have a major impact on our understanding of the past. This course is based on the intensive reading and discussion of several outstanding examples of the 'micro-historical' study of individuals, families, communities, events, and social interactions. These will be primarily drawn from the literature on early modern Europe, which has a long and continuing tradition of work of this kind. Some, however, are taken from the historiography of Early America and recent approaches to 'Global' history. Particular attention will be paid to questions of evidence and of its potential in the hands of imaginative historians; and to the deployment of particular analytical and narrative techniques in the construction of history. We will often be less concerned with whether the historians we study are 'right' in their arguments than with how they develop and present them.\n\nCredit 3 units.

But at the same time, France was a crucible for the development of modern anti-Semitism. Jews appear as characters in novels, hosts of intellectual salons, as actors on the French stage, as icons of financial capitalism, as examples of the limits and possibilities of immigration, integration, and even assimilation, as authors and intellectuals, as quintessentially French and Other to France.

Focusing on \"reset\" diplomacy during the terms of five American and three Russian presidents since 1990, it reveals a familiar historical pattern that begins with high hopes, dialogue, and optimism only to be followed by vast disappointment, standoffs, and pessimism. Despite this dynamic, the course shows how and why the two countries have been able to cooperate at times to make substantial headway on critical issues such as arms control, nonproliferation of WMD, NATO expansion, counterterrorism, and economic and energy development, whereas at other times they have run afoul of major obstacles such as further NATO expansion, missile defense, and democracy and human rights in Russia. The course also examines how many political events created substantial challenges to U.S.-Russia relations, including the Balkan Wars; U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; Russia's wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Ukraine/Crimea; the \"Color Revolutions\"; the Arab Spring and subsequent civil wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya; the fight against ISIS and other militant Islamists; the threats posed by Iran and North Korea; the rise of China; espionage crises; hybrid wars; cyberattacks; and disinformation campaigns. Two vital questions frame the analysis: (1) Why has it been so difficult for these two great powers to develop a mutually beneficial relationship? (2) What would be required to move beyond the limited partnership to something more productive and sustaining? The course concludes by evaluating \"reset\" diplomacy and the ongoing attempts to move U.S.-Russia relations beyond a Hot Peace.\n\nCredit 3 units.

In the second part of this class, we will broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years. Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day, ending with an analysis of Donald Trump and the rise of \"America First.\" In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance-the pervasive impact-of this concept in American culture.\n\nSame as L98 AMCS 3081\n\nCredit 3 units.

Broadly speaking, this course covers the Middle Period (1000-1800) of Islamic history, sandwiched between the Early and High Caliphal Periods (600-100) on the one hand and the Modern Period (1800-Present) on the other hand. Familiarity with the Early and High Caliphal periods is not assumed. The course will not be a \"survey\" of this period but a series of \"windows\" that will allow you to develop both an in-depth understanding of some key features of Islamic societies and a clear appreciation of the challenges (as well as the rewards!) that await historians of the Middle Period.

We will consider questions such as: which traits and behaviors did the Greeks and the Romans associate with masculinity and with femininity? What can we tell from our sources about those who did not fit neatly into this binary? How did ancient Greeks and Romans think about male and female anatomy and psychology? How did the Greeks and the Romans construct sexuality and how did they approach homosexual and heterosexual relationships? How did they think about erotic desire? How did ancient laws and institutions circumscribe the lives of men and women, and how did they contribute to the construction of gender and sexuality? How did class, ethnicity, and age intersect with ideas about gender and sexuality in antiquity? We will read an array of ancient texts in translation, we will consider various theoretical viewpoints, and we will move toward a better understanding of how gender and sexuality were constructed in antiquity. Ultimately, we will reflect on how our exploration of ancient ideas about these issues can help us understand better how we think about them today.\n\nSame as L08 Classics 3152\n\nCredit 3 units.

Beginning in the 16th century, significant numbers of Chinese people moved to the frontiers of an expanding China and across its borders: to Japan and Southeast Asia, to the Americas and Australia, and to Africa and Europe. Although Chinese migration certainly existed beforehand, the period from the 16th century to the present day is marked by the emergence of sustained movement of non-state actors and the development of institutions -- ranging from native-place associations to tourist agents' websites -- that supported this vast circulation of people. Likewise, in many emigrant communities and host societies, Chinese diasporic families adapted to migration as a way of life. This course traces this worldwide circulation of Chinese people over these five centuries.\n\nCredit 3 units.

Its purpose is to provide students with a historical foundation to understand the momentous changes the country underwent during its traumatic transition from an empire to a nation-state. We start the course at the height of the empire's power in the late 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1637-1912) conquered vast swathes of lands and people in Inner Asia. We then move on to the Qing's troubled relationship with Western capitalism and imperialism in the 19th century, which challenged the economic, social, and ideological structures of the imperial regime, culminating in the emergence of \"China\" as a nation-state. By situating China's national history within a global context, the course outlines in detail the transformations that took place in the 20th century, from the rise of communism and fascism to the Second World War to Maoism and cultural revolution. We end the semester with yet another major change that took place in the 1980s, when a revolutionary Maoist ideology was replaced with a technocratic regime, the legacies of which are still with us today.\n\nCredit 3 units.

Over the course of the semester, students will be exposed to the main debates in the field of Chinese economic history while acquiring a strong grasp of the nuts and bolts of how economy functioned and changed from the imperial to the modern times. Situating China within a comparative perspective, we will examine a multitude of debates ranging from the global silver age of the 16th century to the birth of capitalism, the socialist economy, and the PRC's recent involvement in Africa. We will in particular discuss the contradictions that arose out of China's integration into the world economy and the different kinds of economic regimes that existed and continue to exist within China.

We start the course with a discussion of the \"exceptionalism\" of Great Britain as the first industrial nation and reconsider the impact of new trade, production, property and monetary/financial regimes that resulted in the so-called \"Great Divergence\" between China and the West. We then turn to the \"late industrializers\" of China, Japan, and Mexico in order to investigate the varieties of development, specifically focusing on monetary integration, legal integration and the global impact of the great depression. Continuing into the Bretton Woods Conference and the post-war international monetary systems, we bring the course to a close with the advent of the \"post-industrial age.\" This course is designed both for students specializing in economic history and students in all disciplines interested in historical approaches to political/economic development.\n\nCredit 3 units.

How did cyborgs become so integral to our imaginative worlds and daily existence? In this course, we will contemplate the intersection between technologies and societies through the lens of cyborgs, a term that is shorthand for \"cybernetic organisms.\" Defying the separation between humans and machines, cyborgs have been critical to sciences, humanities, pop culture, feminism, afrofuturism, and queer studies, among many other fields of inquiry. This course will take a deep dive into the worlds of scientists, scholars, artists, and ordinary people to discover the cultural meanings of cyborgs across time and space. Along the way, we will meet Norbert Wiener, who coined the term \"cybernetics\"; Donna Haraway, for whom the cyborgs were a revolutionary species; and John C. Lilly, who thought he could speak with dolphins. We will also travel to the USSR to read about a failed internet; to Chile, where cybernetics was a socialist project; and to Japan, to learn about gender and technology in non-Western spaces.

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region.

It questions the myth of a monolithic Chinese culture and uncovers the region's multiple and ethnically entangled past through an in-depth look at the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644-1912). This was the last non-Han dynasty of the Imperial Era, and it gave the People's Republic of China its vast Inner Asian territories: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet. In rethinking the Qing Empire, this course particularly focuses on Tibetan Buddhism and Islam as religious ideologies that linked China with Tibetan, Mongolian, and Turkic-Muslim regions of Inner Asia through the imperial center at Beijing.

The Roman Empire in the East (and commonly known as the Byzantine Empire after the seventh century) survived intact, developing a very different style of Christianity than in the lands of the former western empire. Apart from examining Christianization in the deserts of Egypt or the chilly North Sea, we will discuss the phenomenon of Islam in the seventh century (especially after the Prophet Muhammad's death in 632) and the Arab conquests of the eastern Mediterranean and north Africa.
