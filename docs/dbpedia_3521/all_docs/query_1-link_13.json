        "text": "Andrew\n\nOff the highway, across from the railroad track, you'll find Andrew, 13, working on his bike, talking dreams with his dad or practicing dance moves with his twin sister. He's just like a lot of American kids, except that his days are also about survival.\n\nUpdate 12/15\n\nAndrew is living in Colorado with his father - his sister, Alyssa, is still in Rich Hill. He is a junior in high school school and playing football. He turned 17 in October.\n\nUpdate 8/14\n\nIt's been less than a year since Andrew lost his mother, Elizabeth, just days before the Sundance Film Festival. Still, Andrew and his sister Alyssa finished the 9th grade in Stratton, Colorado, in June with strong grades. Andrew spent much of the summer in Montana with his cousins and saved enough money to buy a used truck. He will start the 10th grade in a new Montana school in the fall, while their dad, Willie, makes plans to build a house on a newly acquired plot of land and supports the family with odd jobs. Andrew gives the film \"40 out of 4\" stars - and then adds that he appreciates the film because \"it tells the truth - nothing sugar-coated - but like it really is.\" He'll turn 16 in October and when asked for an update, he says, \"I still put my pants on one leg at a time.\"\n\nHarley\n\nHarley, 15, lives with his grandma now, and eight other members of his extended family, because his mom is in prison. He misses her deeply - but he's still the first guy in the room to crack a joke and make you laugh when you least expect it.\n\nUpdate 12/15\n\nHarley is still out of school and living in Rich Hill with his grandmother. Grandma Betty works in the neighboring town at Walmart as a baker. Harley works odd jobs. His health is the same - and they are not taking action on his tumor for now. His mother is still in prison. He turned 18 in April.\n\nUpdate 8/14\n\nHarley is 17 and no longer in school, having dropped out in the 10th grade. He's struggling with serious health problems as, this spring, an MRI revealed a brain tumor wrapped around his optic nerve. His Grandma Betty has taken him for several visits with doctors in both Kansas City and St. Louis. Harley will undergo surgery later in the summer. Donna, the Bates County Victim's Rights Advocate from the prosecutor's office, saw the film and arranged for Harley to see his mother, Joann, for the first time in several years. Harley wears his mother's hairband around his wrist in memory of that visit. Joann goes before the parole board this month. Grandma Betty speaks about how the film has been good for the boys because for the first time in their lives, \"They feel like they belong.\"\n\nAppachey\n\nAppachey, 12, dreams of becoming an art teacher in China and finds solace in skateboards â and, despite his smarts, has had to repeat the 6th grade, which doesn't fix all the things that are broken in his life.\n\nUpdate 12/15\n\nAppachey was recommitted and is currently living in the Division of Youth Services facility in Rich Hill. He will be 15 in January 2016.\n\nUpdate 8/14\n\nAppachey turned 13 in January and celebrated the occasion at the Sundance Film Festival. Appachey's mom, Delena, is one of the film's strongest supporters. She exposed so much of herself in the film, which she describes as having happened at a very stressful time in her life. She cries when she talks about her own capacity for change, and how she is in a better place now - and, indeed, if the parents are in a better place, so are the kids. She still struggles to make ends meet, but she has a new relationship with a good man who gives her the emotional support she needs. When Appachey first saw the film, he was in tears, too. When asked about his reaction, he admitted that it had more to do with Harley's story than his own. Through the making of the film and the experience of going to film festivals together, Appachey and Harley have become close - they've even had a couple of sleepovers. With summer classes, Appachey will be able to start the 8th grade in the fall.\n\nAudiences around the world have been moved by these families' stories, some to the point of wanting to provide tangible support. Therefore, we have established this fund as a way to give directly to the boys and their families: https://rally.org/BoysofRICHHILL. Everything will be evenly divided among Andrew, Harley and Appachey.\n\nAbout The Town\n\nRich Hill, Missouri. Seventy miles south of Kansas City, fifteen miles east of the Kansas border. Once a thriving mining town, shortly after World War II, the coal was gone â mined out. Stores closed, people moved away, farms were sold. It's a story that could be told in hundreds of towns across America.\n\nBut people still live here: 1,393 of them at last count. Deep potholes line the gravel roads, and property tax is almost nonexistent. The town center is littered with piles of bricks, and crumbling buildings are all that remain of the original bank, the corner pharmacy, a cafe. Yet there is still the dream of transformation on the horizon: if only the citizens could attract more business or Rich Hill could be home to an industry once again.\n\nEvery year on the 4th of July, like many communities across America, the town puts on a grand celebration, with a carnival and a parade. Rich Hill has a record-setting pie auction to raise the funds for the fireworks. It is a once-a-year time to be part of something larger and grander â the way things used to be â for even a few days. And then the carnival pulls out.\n\nWith Vital Support From:\n\nMacArthur Foundation\n\nSundance Institute\n\nIFP\n\nFilm Independant\n\nIDA\n\nCR\n\nCR\n\nTrailer\n\nFilm Stills\n\nPress & Clippings\n\nWe are over the moon: we won Sundance!
