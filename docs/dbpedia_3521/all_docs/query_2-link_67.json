Perskyi discussed his own work as well as the contributions of his predecessors, such as Paul Nipkow, and suggested television as a replacement for words like telectroscope, one of many terms already in common use whenever the phenomenon of distant electric vision was under discussion. The International Electricity Congress, which heard the paper, was meeting in Paris that summer because this is where the great Exposition Universelle of 1900 was being held. For film historians, the exposition is renowned for its fabulous array of new projection technologies, involving everything from widescreen and color to talking pictures and Cineorama. Perskyi's linguistic contribution, on the other hand, is remembered only by specialists. One wonders if the proponents of the téléoscope and the téléphote, as they roamed the exposition, gave any thought to these new marvels of the cinema, and asked themselves why their medium still lagged so far behind in every conceivable measure. Seeing at a distance was a notion that had captivated engineers and entrepreneurs since word of Alexander Graham Bell's telephone first began to spread in the late 1870s, yet here it was 1900, and still only in the talking stage? People around the world had been waiting for television for decades, but the engineers had given them the cinema instead, a rival moving-image medium that appeared to have leapt from dream to multinational industry almost overnight.\n\nFor generations, historians would carefully segregate the development of these two media, one based on photomechanical technology, the other primarily an electronic system. Back then, technology was destiny. But from the perspective of our own media environment, one that has effaced most of the distinctions that once seemed so formidable, things look very different. The word film is already obsolete, and we probably need a new Perskyi to tell us what to do about television.\n\nAn argument can be made that this is no revolution, but simply a return to first principles. Film and television may have grown up very differently, but for some of the pioneers, like C. Francis Jenkins, this was only because they had been forcibly separated at birth. While hard at work attempting to build the world's first 35mm film projector, Jenkins dashed off a paper titled \"Transmitting Pictures by Electricity,\" which ran in the Electrical Experimenter on July 25, 1894. He helped found the Society of Motion Picture Engineers in 1916, but most of his contributions to its published Transactions had to do with television. For the rest of his career, he would move back and forth between these two realms, tinkering first with one technology, then the other. Ultimately he found ways to bind them up again, as Variety noted on June 21, 1923, when it headlined \"Moving Pictures By Radio Successfully Demonstrated.\" The article appeared on the same \"Pictures\" page as announcements of Lubitsch's move to Warner Bros. and D. W. Griffith's new plans for United Artists—but with more prominent placement. True, all the audience saw on the screen that day was the wiggling of Jenkins's own fingers, but he was careful to explain the new technology as no electrical miracle, just another way of transmitting a picture, sixteen times a second. In other words, a film story.\n\nThere once was an argument, since debunked, that the motion picture industry ignored the coming of television in the hope that it would somehow go away. In reality, during the interwar era at least, television was first regarded as a technical curiosity worth watching (what Variety in 1923 called a \"radio eye\") and then as a new means of promotion and distribution for the film industry's own products, an avenue that might be controlled not by David Sarnoff, but by the integrated Hollywood majors themselves. Far from ignoring the new medium, the film industry always kept a wary eye on it, and the depth of its concern could usually be judged by the style and content of the dozens of films it produced in which television—a consumer technology that did not then exist—was presented as a force to be reckoned with in the lives of average citizens.\n\nThe filmography presented here remains a work in progress, an attempt to list all pre-World War II theatrical narrative films in which some aspect of television plays at least a minor role. We have excluded newsreels and straight educational films, although sponsored industrials with strong narrative content, like The Middleton Family at the 1939 World's Fair, a Technicolor feature starring a familiar group of Hollywood character actors, still seems worth mentioning. The scope is international, although our selection probably over-samples English-language productions. Readers are invited to suggest additional titles, illustrations, and links to online resources. Please visit the webpage http://www.dorongalili.com/television-in-the-cinema-before-1939/ to do so.\n\nAs the chronological organization makes clear, these films were produced in response to changes in the popular discourse, not only in terms of how many such films were being produced, but in what aspect of television they chose to focus on. So most of the earliest examples come from France, and would seem to have been inspired by press coverage of the work of men like Édouard Belin and Georges Rignoux. The picture telephone, which held a firm place in the popular imagination since Albert Robida conjured up the telephonoscope in 1883, is in at the start here as well, although an even larger number of films feature a simple electrical telescope, sometimes used for military purposes, sometimes serving as a closed-circuit adjunct to the doorbell, and sometimes just for general snooping.\n\nAfter slacking off in the early 1920s, a sudden revival of interest in mid-decade focused on televisual communication, occasionally at global or even interplanetary distances. International developments in radio may have helped fuel this, but one should not discount the impact of someone like Hugo Gernsback, who not only coined the term \"science fiction,\" but by publishing such journals as Amazing Stories (from 1926) and Television (from 1928) helped establish this nonexistent medium in the national consciousness. Ironically, in later years the cinema would downplay this science-fiction element as the real world caught up with such prophecies. Reviewing AT&T's historic picture telephone demonstration of April 7, 1927, the New York Times thought immediately of a similar device seen in Fritz Lang's Metropolis, which was still in first run uptown—\"a case of a prophecy being fulfilled about as soon as it started.\" Mad scientists might still make full use of television in big-screen narratives, but after 1927, so could the rest of us.\n\nFIG. 1. Television Weekly News was a short-lived Los Angeles publication that tried to incorporate television coverage into a traditional entertainment magazine format. Richard Koszarski Collection.\n\nThe mechanical television fad of 1928–31 resulted in another burst of attention, this time with television broadcasting sharing screen time with the now ubiquitous picture telephone. But while several British features reflect the sophisticated television operations then under way in London, American production was clearly more downscale (one entry is a stag film). Without authorization from the Federal Radio Commission, all television work here was still relegated to experimental, even amateur status. Paramount's Joinville studios produced Magie moderne in eight different languages in 1931, but despite being based on a Howard Irving Young script, English was not one of them (nor was there a Hollywood-produced original). Until the marketplace was ready to deliver something more promising, the subject of television would remain at the margins as far as the major Hollywood studios were concerned.\n\nIt was the transition to electronic television that brought renewed interest from filmmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Now that radio had firmly established its cultural and economic significance, broadcasting became an increasingly important part of this story, with some films even picturing theater television presenting televised newsreels. While the BBC's electronic broadcasts were on the air from 1936 (with Americans waiting until 1939 for a less ambitious program), Hollywood films of the late 1930s became very casual about the existence of television. Several films suggest—and not from a science-fiction context—that television was already being broadcast here, including at least one musical western. Audiences for such films must have wondered where all this was happening.\n\nBut even then, nearly half the \"television\" films being made saw the medium as something more than just radio broadcasting with pictures. Television as a surveillance tool emerged as a comic target in Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times, while its military uses—predicted onscreen twenty years earlier in The Flying Torpedo—became increasingly sinister. By the mid-1930s, films of the future had to incorporate television as a matter of course, and distant electric vision was probably the only futuristic convention so universally acknowledged (rockets and robots looked good, but were harder to work into a plot). When H. G. Wells wrote Things to Come in 1936, he projected a future in which television was everywhere. The residents of Everytown communicate by picture telephone and are addressed as a group on enormous Jumbotron screens. When a visual record of the past is called for, all one needs to do is pop a video recording into a handy console, and a wall-sized image immediately appears (in 1:1.85 aspect ratio).\n\nUnlike the comedies, thrillers, musicals, and melodramas that came before, Things to Come was a very thoughtful work of serious predictive power. Television takes many roles here, but never appears as simple entertainment, nor as \"radio with pictures\" in any form. Not much time for amusement in this future, a no-nonsense place in which the bombing of Everytown ushers in a world of glittering uncertainty. As the planes fly overhead in 1940, the first building they demolish has CINEMA written on it in 10-foot-tall letters. The letters shatter dramatically and the building falls into the street. By the time we get to the far future, there is no more cinema, and no books or music either, for that matter.\n\nDid Wells really hate the movies so much that he used valuable screen time to predict their replacement by this cleaner and more efficient technology? And just what was doing the replacing? As noted, Wells saw the future in terms of all those other technologies, like the electrical telescope and picture telephone, that filmmakers had been conjuring up for decades. But there will be no entertainment broadcasting here, no \"vast wasteland\" to distract the citizens of the future. Wells may have gotten that home video bit right (no doubt courtesy of John Logie Baird's Phonovision), but his movie blows the most important prediction: it's not just cinema that this landmark film of the future hoped to relegate to the ash heap, but television—or at least those \"moving pictures by radio\" that men like Jenkins saw as central to their own vision of the future.\n\nLa photographie électrique à distance / Long Distance Wireless Photography\n\n(1908, Star Film Co., France) dir.

Her face in exaggerated proportions, and somewhat comically altered, is cleverly du[plicated . . .] then her husband, eccentric in his whiskers and coiffure, puts his face before the transmitter.
