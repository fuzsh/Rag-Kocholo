Although the film depicts true events, there are some fictional characters.[4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1977 El Salvadoran presidential election, public unrest is at an all-time high over fears of election fraud. In the midst of a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla insurgency by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, the anti-communist military dictatorship uses death squads to abduct, torture and \"disappear\" anyone who speaks about their terrible human rights record. The military also prevents average voters from getting to the polls; soldiers are shown blocking a bus bringing people to town on election day. When the people decide to walk, the military shoots up their vans so that they have no transportation for the return journey.\n\nThe Vatican elevates theologically conservative Oscar Arnulfo Romero (Raul Julia) to the position of Archbishop of San Salvador, hoping that with he will not get involved in politics. Although apolitical, Romero is afraid of the government's increasing hostility. He initially refrains from stirring anti-government sentiments, but, as he spends more time as archbishop, he sees evidence of deception, oppression, and systemic murder, after which he cannot support the government in good conscience and begins to speak out.[4] After the assassination of Father Rutilio Grande (Richard Jordan), an outspoken Jesuit advocate for the poor and close friend of Father Romero's, Romero begins to take a stand against the government's policies, prompting the government to retaliate by ordering to death squads to target the priests of his Archdiocese.[5]\n\nAfter failing to rescue a pro-government hostage of the Pro-Soviet guerrillas in a botched ransom, Romero discovers that his friend Father Osuna (Alejandro Bracho), a militant critic of the military regime, has been captured and tortured. After securing his release, Romero instigates a boycott of the president-elect's inauguration, defying him by saying Mass in a church the Salvadoran military has taken over as a barracks. He later attempts to secure the release of a soldier taken hostage with Fr. Osuna by the guerrillas, but is arrested in the process. Fr. Osuna is subsequently tortured to death, despite Romero's protesting pleas.\n\nUndeterred, Romero rejects the violent methods of the guerrillas, but is nonetheless assassinated while saying Mass, specifically while consecrating the Eucharist. The film concludes with text stating:\n\nArchbishop Romero was murdered on March 24, 1980. He had spoken the disturbing truth. Many chose not to listen. As a result, between 1980 and 1989 more than 60,000 Salvadorians were killed. But the struggle for peace and freedom, justice and dignity goes on.[6]\n\nBy 1992, when the Salvadorian Civil War ended (three years after the movie was made), the total number of Salvadorians killed increased to over 75,000.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRaúl Juliá as Archbishop Óscar Romero, archbishop of San Salvador\n\nRichard Jordan as Father Rutilio Grande, SJ\n\nAlejandro Bracho as Father Alfonzo Osuña, SJ\n\nTony Plana as Father Manuel Morantes, SJ\n\nEvangelina Elizondo as Josephina Gatedo\n\nLucy Reina as Lucia, Poor Campesino.

This was the first time a Catholic company produced a major film.[7] The company was also known for the production of a long-standing television series called Insight. The film was screened in 1989 at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was directed by Australian filmmaker John Duigan and produced by Paulist Pictures founder Father Ellwood (Bud) Kieser. Alfonso Cuarón, a Mexican film director, worked as an assistant director for this film. Composer Gabriel Yared, who went on to win BAFTA Awards and an Oscar for his other scores, composed the music for Romero. The movie was filmed in Mexico and set in El Salvador.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nRomero was generally well received by critics. The film holds a 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 reviews.[8] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mildly positive review, awarding it two and a half stars out of four. Ebert praised Julia's \"restrained and reasonable\" performance but felt that the film was predictable and therefore not as powerful as other biopics.[4] Spirituality and Practice gave the film a positive review stating it as an \"excellent drama\" with most of the praise going towards Raul Julia in his performance as Romero.[citation needed]\n\nRomero did receive criticism on how it did not shed light on US involvement. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated the fact that \"the film doesn't deal with the role of the American government in El Salvador's plight, beyond a plea from Romero for the US to stop sending arms that will be only used against his country's people.\"[9] Vincent Canby of The New York Times thought that the film \"is more important as the brief, considerably simplified biography of a heroic man than as cinema. The film's manner is that of a textbook.\"[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
