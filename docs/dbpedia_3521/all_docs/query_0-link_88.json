        "text": "On February 2, 1914, Governor Martin H. Glynn made two nominations to the Court of Appeals.1 No one could have predicted that it would mark not only the start of a long and brilliant judicial career for one of the nominees, Benjamin Cardozo, and for the other, the culmination of a stellar legal career and the very end of his life. Judge Cardozo served for 18 years on the Court (six as Chief Judge), followed by six more on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe other nominee was William B. Hornblower, who, because of his prominence at the time, received top billing when the New York Times reported the nominations.2 In his comments at the Court on June 16, 1914, the day of Judge Hornblower’s death, Chief Judge Willard Bartlett lamented that the Judge “was destined to perform only one week of judicial service here.”3 The remarkable brevity of Judge Hornblower’s membership on the Court-the shortest by far of any other judge in Court of Appeals history-was matched by his renown as one of America’s foremost lawyers.\n\nJudge Hornblower entered this world on May 13, 1851, with uncommon gifts of intellect and family lineage, and made the most of them. His father, William H. Hornblower, was a prominent Presbyterian minister in Patterson, New Jersey, and later a Professor of Sacred Rhetoric at Western Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania.4 He was an elector for Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin in 1860, and a stalwart opponent of slavery.\n\nThe Judge’s great-grandfather, Josiah Hornblower (1729-1809) was an engineer who, in 1753, brought the first steam engine over from England to pump water out of the copper mines in Passaic, New Jersey. He married and settled in New Jersey, had 12 children, and worked for his adopted country in various ways, including service as a delegate to the Continental Congress. His son (Judge Hornblower’s grandfather), Joseph C. Hornblower (1777-1864) was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Judge Hornblower’s uncle, Joseph P. Bradley (1813-1892), was a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Another uncle, Lewis B. Woodruff (1809-1875), served on the New York Court of Appeals in 1868 and, later, on the Federal Circuit Court.\n\nJudge Hornblower began his formal schooling at the Collegiate School in New York City, and in 1867 entered Princeton, following his father’s footsteps. On his graduation in 1871, he was class orator and was awarded the prize of ’59 in English Literature. His son, grandson, great-grandson, and great-great-granddaughter and great-great-grandson would go there as well.\n\nUnder the influence of his judge-uncles he decided on a career in law, and in 1875 graduated from Columbia Law School and was admitted to the bar. His family was largely Republican, but by the time he was at law school he had converted and would become a “sound money Democrat.” It was not long before his practice began to flourish, and he argued his maiden case in the Court of Appeals (Atlantic State Bank v. Savery, 82 NY 291 [1880]).\n\nOn April 26, 1882, he married Susan Craney Sanford, the daughter of a New Haven banker. They were to have three children before she died in 1886. One of the children, George Sanford Hornblower, a lawyer and poet, would survive the judge.\n\nIn 1888, Judge Hornblower and a partner opened the doors of their firm (Hornblower & Byrne), which evolved into today’s firm of Willkie, Farr & Gallagher. Shortly thereafter, he was approached about an appointment to the New York Court of Appeals for the vacancy occasioned by Judge Charles Rapallo‘s death. After some indecision, Judge Hornblower withdrew his name from consideration because he “had a family of young children growing up on [his] hands who would have to be educated, clothed and cared for, and the salary of a Judge of the Court of Appeals while adequate for the present would hardly suffice for the growing needs of [his] family in the future and would at best require a life of rigid economy.”5 Two years later, Governor David B. Hill appointed Hornblower to a commission that planned the reorganization of the New York courts.\n\nBy 1893 Hornblower had become one of the nation’s most eminent lawyers, representing railroads, insurance companies, and Thomas Edison. When United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Blatchford died in 1893, President Grover Cleveland submitted Hornblower’s name to the Senate to fill the vacancy. But this was not to be. The proposed appointment was blocked by United States Senators from New York David B. Hill (who had been governor) and Edward Murphy, Jr., owing to their feud with President Cleveland.6 There is a suggestion they thwarted the nomination in retaliation for Hornblower’s having played a key role in opposing the election of Isaac Maynard to the Court of Appeals.7\n\nJudge Hornblower took ill and suffered heart trouble, causing him to tender his resignation shortly after he joined the Court.8 His condition worsened and in his 64th year he died in his summer home in Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 17, 1914,9 and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.10\n\nProgeny\n\nWilliam B. Hornblower (1851-1914) had a son who survived him, a Wall Street lawyer (and poet, playwright, sculptor, and painter) named George Sanford Hornblower (1884-1927), whose children included a son, George M. Hornblower (1917- ), a lawyer who settled in Washington, D.C. after World War II.\n\nJudge Hornblower’s great-grandchildren include Jonathan M. Hornblower, a lawyer in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Lynden Miller, a public garden designer in New York City. The judge’s great-great-grandchildren include Gifford Miller, Speaker of the New York City Council, 2002-2006; Marshall L. Miller, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, E.D.N.Y; and Dune Lawrence, a journalist with Bloomberg News in New York.\n\nThis biography appears in The Judges of the New York Court of Appeals: A Biographical History, ed.
