The drama we explore at NYC has always been issue-based, about empathy and walking around in other people’s shoes. Our philosophy is to enable young people to understand the world and themselves better.”\n\nAfter performing the show the company were given a standing ovation by a packed audience including the late author’s widow, Elspeth Graham-Peet. Afterwards, Elspeth said the performance had been a ‘fabulous’ interpretation of the book.\n\n“What the cast did as children was to ask questions all the time, talking about how they thought they were feeling. They added to the story and made it their own – they were just brilliant.”\n\nStrictly Necessary Cookie should be enabled at all times so that we can save your preferences for cookie settings.\n\nIf you disable this cookie, we will not be able to save your preferences.
