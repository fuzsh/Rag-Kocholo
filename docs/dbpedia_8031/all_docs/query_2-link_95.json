A long, long necklace that had taken Cherry days – weeks – of careful, painstaking work. It was nearly complete, and Cherry was determined it would be the longest necklace she had ever made; that it would be fit for a giant! But the end of the holidays had arrived. “You’ve only got today, Cherry,” said her mother. “Just today, that’s all.” Cherry didn’t mind, a day would be enough – she only needed a few more shells. So, amidst the taunts of her older brothers, she set out to search for them. Then the clouds grew dark and the waves grew large, and as the storm blew in, Cherry realized, to her horror, that she was cut off from the shore. From then on, events began to take a decidedly dark turn. One from which there was no turning back.\n\nWe Found a Hat by Jon Klassen\n\nTwo turtles have found a hat.

I always look forward to his books because they are so clever. There are so many layers to the illustrations and you find something different every time you read his books. Leo’s latest book from Gecko Press is Gus’s Garage and it is terrific!\n\nGus the pig runs a garage. Gus stores all sorts of stuff in his garage, stuff that looks like rubbish, but when his friends need help, he always has just the right thing for them. It’s up to the reader to figure out what stuff Gus might use to help his friends. He certainly is one very clever pig. Rico the rhino comes by on his moped and says ‘Gus, this seat – I’m overflowing.’ Gus looks through his bits and bobs and attaches an old seat that he has to Rico’s moped. This carries on throughout the book until Gus has reused everything in his pile of stuff.\n\nGus’s Garage is another brilliant picture book from Leo Timmers. It is a picture book that is both entertaining and gets kids thinking. It makes them wonder what Gus will use from his pile of stuff to come up with a solution for his friends and then what might Gus’s final product be. I love the sense of anticipation as you turn the page to find out what Gus has done. I also love Gus’s refrain, ‘Let’s see. I have some bits and bobs. This goes with that. There. Just the job.’\n\nOne of the things that I love the most about Leo’s illustrations are the vibrant colours that he uses. His illustrations seem to shine on the pages. There are lots of details to take in on each page. Something I only noticed on my third or fourth reading was that the sky gets darker and darker throughout the story as the day gets later.\n\nGus’s Garage is a picture book that will be begged to be read again and again.\n\nWin a signed copy of Smile by Raina Telgemeier\n\nIt’s been a bit quiet on My Best Friends Are Book lately as I’ve been settling in to my new role as a school librarian. I’m catching up on books I’ve missed and I’ll try and post lots over the school holidays. Anyway, here is an exciting new competition for you!\n\nI got to attend the IBBY Congress in Auckland last month and one of the authors that I met was graphic novelist Raina Telgemeier. Raina is the creator of such awesome graphic novels as Smile, Sisters and Drama, and she has also adapted some of The Babysitters Club stories into graphic novels. While at IBBY I got a copy of Smile signed (and doodled in) by Raina to give away on the blog.\n\nAll you have to do to enter is email bestfriendsrbooks@gmail.com with the subject ‘Smile,’ along with your name and address. I will draw a winner at random. Competition closes Friday 30 September (NZ only).\n\nLittle People, Big Dreams\n\nA fantastic new nonfiction series that I’ve discovered recently is called Little People, Big Dreams. It’s a series of picture book biographies, published by Frances Lincoln, that are ideal for introducing young children to women who have had an impact on the world. There are currently four books in the series, with more coming next year. The first four books focus on Maya Angelou, Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo and Coco Chanel.\n\nThe aim of the series is to introduce children to the lives of outstanding people, from designers and artists to scientists. The series shows children that, even though these women achieved great things, they all started life as ‘a little child with a dream.’\n\nEach book is beautifully presented, with illustrations that are appealing to children. The text reads like a narrative and perfectly sums up each of the extraordinary lives. There is more information about each of the women at the end of the book, with suggestions of other great books and websites where children can find more information.\n\nLittle People, Big Dreams is the perfect series for empowering girls and showing them that they can do anything that they dream of.\n\nThese books are a must for a school library and I’ll certainly be bringing them to the attention of teachers.\n\nA Child of Books by Oliver Jeffers and Sam Winston\n\nBe prepared to fall madly in love with the most stunning celebration of books that you will ever read!\n\nEver since I first heard about A Child of Books I have been eagerly awaiting its release. It is the first collaboration between Oliver Jeffers and another artist, typographical fine artist Sam Winston. There have been a few teaser images, showing illustrations made up of text, and I knew I needed to have this book. It has just been released and it is absolutely stunning!\n\nA Child of Books is about a little girl who sails her raft ‘across a sea of words’ to arrive at the house of a small boy. She invites him to come away with her on an adventure where they can journey through ‘forests of fairy tales’, ‘across mountains of make-believe’ and ‘sleep in clouds of song’. Guided by his new friend, the boy unlocks his imagination and a lifetime of magic lies ahead of him… But who will be next?\n\nA Child of Books is a celebration of stories, books and reading, that you will want to read again and again. It’s one of those books that you will find something new in each time you read it. You might notice a line from a book that you missed the last time or note the significance of a particular line of text. I want to take this book everywhere with me and show it to everyone I meet. However, I also want to take the book apart and have the pages on the walls of my house and my school library to look at every day.\n\nOliver Jeffers’ characteristic illustrations and hand drawn text that I already love is combined with Sam’s astonishing typographical landscapes that I couldn’t get enough of. Sam has taken excerpts from classic children’s stories and nursery rhymes, from Treasure Island to Alice and Wonderland, and shaped them into stunning creations. There is an ocean made from castaway stories and clouds made from lullabies.\n\nIf I ever doubt why I do what I do all I need to do is open this book. If anyone questions the validity of libraries and librarians all I need to do is put this book in their hands. A Child of Books is my picture book of the year and it will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nBuy this book for your collection and share it with everyone in your life.\n\nMy Top September Kids & YA Releases\n\nDemon Road: Amercian Monsters by Derek Landy\n\nThe epic conclusion in the mind-blowing supernatural thriller from bestselling author DEREK LANDY, creator of international sensation Skulduggery Pleasant.\n\nBigger, meaner, stronger, Amber closes in on her murderous parents as they make one last desperate play for power. Her own last hopes of salvation, however, rest beyond vengeance, beyond the abominable killers – living and dead – that she and Milo will have to face.\n\nFor Amber’s future lies in her family’s past, in the brother and sister she never knew, and the horrors beyond imagining that befell them.\n\nJim Reaper: Son of Grim by Rachel Delahaye\n\nYou might have heard how the universe began with the Big Bang? Well, the universe as Jim Wimple knows it is about to end. With a Bazoom!\n\nNot only are Bazoom! scooters super fast and deadly cool, but fierce (and swoonsome) older girl Fiona has just started riding hers to and from school, and possibly out of Jim’s life forever. Disaster! Jim Wimple needs a Bazoom!, and fast. So he and his best friend Will devise a clever scheme, which involves having to sneak into Dad’s workplace.

When Lisa finds out about Solomon’s solitary existence, she comes up with a plan sure to net her a scholarship: befriend Solomon. Treat his condition. And write a paper on her findings.

Storing ALL of them in one place? That’s when the trouble starts. Hidden under a small suburban town The Inventory is a collection of the most incredible technology the world is NOT ready for: invisible camouflage, HoverBoots, indestructible metals and a giant battle robot just for starters. Lots’ Dad is the mild-mannered curator of The Inventory, and she gets to see some CRAZY things. The Russian “Iron Fist” is a colossal war robot, built during the Cold War. Once the Iron Curtain fell, the mechanical giant was written out of history and kept secret in The Inventory – now it has been stolen, along with some other serious tech. Alerted to the missing items The Inventory, usually devoid of people, is flooded with mission teams setting out to follow the trail of the thieves, only to be stranded and locked out of communication. Using invisibility camouflage, the thieves have hidden inside and now they’re in control. Alone on the inside, Lots must find a way to get her Dad and The Inventory teams back and stop the anonymous thieves.\n\nSuper Rabbit by Stephanie Blake\n\nOnce there was a little rabbit… “I’m not a LITTLE rabbit!

Now there is a new character to add to that list, the larger-than-life Marge. Jake and Jemima’s life becomes incredibly exciting when Marge arrives.\n\nMeet Marge, the mischievous babysitter with rainbow hair who loves to make a mess and bend the rules . . . At dinnertime Chef Marge cooks up chocolate soup, and at school Marge the Muscian conducts a chaotic concert in the playground!\n\nJake and Jemima have brilliant fun with their new babysitter, but will they manage to tick off all the jobs on Mummy’s list?\n\nMarge in Charge is a hilarious, entertaining collection of stories about the magic that Marge brings to Jake and Jemima’s life. Isla Fisher’s stories about Marge will have children laughing out loud and wishing they had a babysitter who was this much fun.\n\nJemima and Jake don’t think that Marge is going to be any fun, especially when she turns up at their house looking like a strict old lady. They have no idea of the adventures that await them. Marge has so many stories to share and you’re never quite sure which are real and which ones she’s made up. Marge brings out the fun in any situation and makes everything better, from birthday parties to school. It’s not only Jemima and Jake that fall in love with Marge, all the other kids at school want her as their babysitter too. There are three stories in this first collection and I certainly hope there will be more stories to look forward to.\n\nMarge in Charge is a perfect read-aloud to share with a class or snuggled up with your kids. Kids aged 6-10 especially will love Marge and her crazy antics. The book is illustrated throughout by Eglantine Ceulemans delightful illustrations. She makes Marge’s larger than life character jump off the page.\n\nCheck out this video of Isla Fisher introducing the series:"
