        "text": "\"It found me.\"\n\nThat is what the character Gato says in the book Keeper by Mal Peet when journalist Paul Faustino asks him about his exploration and searching in the forest as a boy. What finds him happens on a magical soccer field in a clearing in the jungle, where he is told, \"There. Your place. You belong there.\"\n\nIn a way, this story found me. It started as a conversation about soccer books. \"Have you ever read Mal Peet?\" I'd never heard of him let alone read him. Mal Peet sounded like a name I wouldn't forget , yet I did until I was shopping for Christmas gifts, searching for soccer novels, and found Mal Peet. I rounded out an order with the book Keeper and of all things that came in the package, it is the one book that grabbed me and that I couldn't put down regardless of what I knew I should be reading instead.\n\nIt is an older title, not a new release. It is only really available online or by special order in bookstores. It is considered a young adult novel, and yet for the difficulty in getting it, and for the stigma of its age range, it is a richly developed book that rewards the reader who finds it and resists being categorized as a book for teens.\n\nIt is the story of a keeper, a boy who grows up to become a World Cup winner, but it is more than that. It is a story about fate. It is a book about the paths into the jungle that we choose and those that are chosen for us. It is a book about the way that life works in reality, and the way we once imagined life could work, full of mystery and magic. The story gives the game of soccer a sense of the mystical, of something bigger than the dimensions of the pitch, of places in our hearts and minds where we feel the game deepest. It is a tale of the supernatural as well, of spirits that teach, and of the spirit to win.\n\n'Giving up soccer made me a soccer player.'\n\nThe book is set as a long interview between Paul Faustino and the keeper who is only known as one of two nicknames, first The Stork (La Ciguena), then El Gato (The Cat). The World Cup trophy sits on the table in the journalist's office as they begin. For all the inevitability that the trophy symbolizes, it is surprising it how deeply the story is developed, how the sense of the unreal is handled so that it becomes the thread where you begin to believe the keeper and distrust the sensible nature of the journalist. You want to believe, and you do.\n\nThere is a sense in the book of time and place and the descriptions bring it alive. The characters are well developed and act like humans through touches like when Gato calls the journalist Paul, simple things, but things that in their believablilty draw us closer to the book and make it real. The way that the keeper looks at the tape of the World Cup towards the book's end, how he describes the penalty kicks as he watches them, is exceptional. It ties up neatly in the last few pages, but it is supposed to, almost with that same inevitability of the World Cup trophy he introduces at the beginning, yet it is handled in a way that there there are surprises.\n\nThere is something hard to categorize about this book that makes it worth finding, makes it worth reading. Maybe is it the sense of magic, and a time and place that are so accurately rendered that you believe. It could be that it is the story of a life designed by will and by fate that makes it perfect book as the New Year approaches. Regardless. There is magic in the world. This book shows us how to see it.\n\nKeeper by Mal Peet\n\nCandlewick Press, US Edition 2007\n\npaperback, $6.99\n\navailable online and by special order in bookstores"
