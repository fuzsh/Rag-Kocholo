        "text": "It takes a disciplined author to hide secrets within secrets, to create puzzles, codes and metaphors that will prise them open, and then to hand everything over to readers without signaling each bit of legerdemain with a moment of “aha!” And it takes ambition to apply such intricate storytelling to a sweeping plot.\n\nThe British author Mal Peet shows both restraint and daring. His novel “Tamar,” winner of the 2005 Carnegie Medal (a sort of British Newbery), alternates between an often gripping story line about two British-trained covert agents parachuted into their native Holland during the last winter of World War II and the mystery of their legacy 50 years later.\n\nThe modern subplot unfolds as a 15-year-old girl attempts to interpret the items in a box bequeathed to her by her enigmatic grandfather, one of the two agents. The box contains cash, maps, a piece of silk, a semi-finished crossword puzzle, an unlabeled photograph and wartime identity papers stamped with a swastika. Properly decoded and reassembled, these will spell out the untold account of her grandfather’s wartime conduct.\n\nThe two agents, their pasts thoroughly erased by their arduous training in Britain’s Special Operations Executive (and by the author’s resolute silence about their prewar lives), enter the novel under their code names, Tamar and Dart. With almost careless elegance Peet tosses off a summary of their paramilitary education at a series of grand, isolated estates, a training program “like a tour of the stately homes of England organized by dangerous psychopaths.”\n\nLocals believe the estate where the agents complete their training is a hospital for gruesomely disfigured officers, but thereafter the disguises are deliberate. Characters seek hiding places, costumes and cover stories, and almost none of them first appear as their true selves.\n\nAlthough the wartime plot hinges on a love affair, the technical details of the British-run covert networks and Dutch resistance make for the most absorbing sequences. Peet is especially good on canny renderings of cameo players, like the disturbingly young Special Operations instructor who teaches encryption and codes while smoking enormous cigars, or the proprietor of a Dutch bar who seemingly caters to Germans but uses their revelry to mask the noise of his underground printing press.\n\nYet not all the resistance is heroic, and no hero emerges intact. Desperate rescue missions and routine encounters with German soldiers both inspire intense fear. Boredom, too, can be lethal: Dart endures the endless hours spent in an airless, well-hidden cubbyhole waiting for wireless transmissions by consuming damaging doses of amphetamines. Clashes among resistance factions dramatize the moral costs of war as well. Knowing that their sabotage and guerrilla warfare guarantee deadly reprisals, resistance leaders try to calculate their responsibility for civilians’ lives.\n\nIn setting forth the two mysteries — the agents’ fates and how the girl discovers them — Peet lays out a trail of clues. The opening lines explain that the contemporary protagonist, Tamar, was named by her grandfather, a man “serious about names; he’d had several himself.” The romance of these phrases might seduce the audience away from the grandfather’s own name, William Hyde, an early hint to his relationship with his past. And what of the name “Tamar,” attributed to Hyde and his colleagues who take the names of English rivers as noms de guerre? We’re told that the Tamar divides Cornwall and Devon, but Peet doesn’t mention other resonances of the name. That its biblical forebear, from Genesis, devises a false identity for herself forms only one of several thematic parallels with Peet’s story.\n\nThe deeper a reader wades into the novel, the cleverer its apparatus appears. River metaphors and allusions flow freely, suggesting a world of secrets and false identities that is “slippery, changeable, fluid,” and that the reclamation of identity — a topic invariably of interest to adolescent readers — is a tortured process in which “you can swim ... also drown.”\n\nOn the other hand, scrutiny also points up the novel’s flaws. The motivations behind some of the characters’ pivotal actions, particularly decisions connected to the love affair, can be so opaque that Peet repeatedly has them ask one another for explanations. The two story lines unfold at different paces, which hobbles the race toward climactic revelation. Given the overall drama and vividly researched setting, however, most readers will forgive such failings.\n\nPeet’s ability to tackle outsize themes with minutely tooled devices may be his most impressive gift. His improbably riveting first novel, “Keeper,” builds similarly complex narrative frames around a South American soccer player, a superstar goalkeeper who tells an interviewer he has learned the game from an otherworldly teacher in the rainforest. Readers exorcise their skepticism through the reactions of the interviewer; meanwhile, tactile evocations of the rainforest and emphatic, metaphysically inclined discussions of goalkeeping strategy emerge as foundations for metaphors about life on a threatened earth. (A sequel, “The Penalty,” will be published this fall.)\n\nTo Peet’s credit, “Tamar” resolves less tidily than “Keeper.” After the characters have teased out the codes, the picture they present remains morally ambiguous, a final puzzle. In the end, judging his characters is a trick the author wisely declines."
