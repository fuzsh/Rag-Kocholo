Inside she finds a series of clues and hidden messages which she and her cousin follow, to discover the story of another Tamar, a resistance fighter in Nazi-occupied Holland during the Second World War.\n\nThey unravel a story of passionate love, jealousy, betrayal and tragedy amongst the daily fear and horror of war.\n\nPeet, winner of the 2004 Branford-Boase Award, has created a powerful and terrifyingly authentic picture of wartime life, of the intense relationships provoked by danger, and the links which emerge between those wartime events and the modern Tamar's fractured family life, and her emerging love for her cousin. An absorbing and challenging crossover novel."
