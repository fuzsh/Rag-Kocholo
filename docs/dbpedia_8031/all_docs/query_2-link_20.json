        "text": "A modern retelling of Othello, in which the Moor of Venice and his wife Desdemona are transformed into the South American equivalent of Posh and Becks, has won this year's Guardian children's fiction prize.\n\nMal Peet's Exposure beat authors including Terry Pratchett to win the £1,500 prize at tonight's awards ceremony. \"It feels absolutely great – I've always had my eye on the Guardian prize but it's always evaded me,\" said Peet. \"My books have never even made the shortlist before, and I'd always sit at home gnashing my teeth and tearing my hair.\"\n\nExposure entwines the stories of hotshot black footballer Otello and his popstar wife Desmerelda (Dezi), the subject of relentless coverage by celebrity magazines, and a group of desperately poor slum children. Chair of judges and the Guardian's children's books editor Julia Eccleshare said that Peet \"handles big themes with supreme confidence\". \"He is a very good storyteller who can create a rich and ambitious novel,\" she said, adding that Exposure \"includes much wisdom on the whole issue of celebrity\".\n\nIn Peet's version of Othello, the villainous Iago becomes Diego, Otello's agent. And the story's different strands are held together by sports journalist Paul Faustino, a regular in Peet's books who follows the story of Otello's transfer to club Rialto. The bones of Shakespeare's play jut through the text, which Peet has divided into five acts. \"I did think about how certain key incidents could be translated,\" said Peet. \"The bit in Othello the play, where Iago conspires to get Cassio drunk, I thought: 'How could I do that? Date-rape drugs in a bar could work.' I spent a lot of time translating the play, and when I had about six key scenes I started writing.\"\n\nAfter an eclectic career that included spells as a teacher, hospital mortuary worker and writer of reading schemes for educational publishers, Peet only decided to start his first novel at the age of 52. What emerged was Keeper, a football-focused debut featuring Faustino, which went on to win the Branford Boase award. His second, Tamar, won him the Carnegie. The football theme that runs through three of his four novels is natural for him, he said: not only did he feel that all football books for children were \"pretty much crap\", but he was an obsessive football player himself until he \"discovered wine, women and cigarettes\". \"I used to play all the time. I would play football when it was light and read when it was dark. Now I get to play football vicariously,\" he said.\n\nIn the course of his research for Exposure, Peet borrowed David Beckham's autobiography from the library – but he didn't go as far as reading it. \"It was weird – writing is a stupid thing to do,\" he said. \"I come up here in the morning to a pleasant room in the roof of my house and imagine I'm a black South American football superstar, then I have to imagine I'm a female pop celebrity who's pregnant. It's a completely mad way to spend your time. If I did it in public I would be sectioned. Writing is a form of licensed madness.\"\n\nThe Guardian children's fiction prize is the only award judged by children's authors. It was launched in 1967; previous winners include Ted Hughes, Jacqueline Wilson and Philip Pullman. Last year's prize was taken by Patrick Ness, who judged this year's award along with Celia Rees and Andy Stanton. Ness called Exposure \"a terrific book\". \"It's really exciting and meaty and ambitious,\" he said, \"terrifically told and put together.\""
