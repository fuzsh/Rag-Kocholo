        "text": "Tamar Synopsis\n\nA thrilling and moving story about love, betrayal and belonging. When Tamar's grandfather, an intensely private man, falls from a balcony to his death, he leaves behind a box with Tamar's name on it. For a long time Tamar refuses even to think about it...until one hot June day she opens it to reveal a series of clues and hidden messages from her grandfather. She and her cousin Johannes follow the clues and discover that her name also belonged to someone else over half a century before; someone involved in the terrifying world of resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Holland during the Second World War. As she pieces together the mystery her grandfather left behind, another Tamar's story is unravelled; a story of passionate love, jealousy and tragedy played out amongst the daily fear and horror of war.;By the author of \"Keeper\", winner of the 2004 Branford-Boase award.;Written with such detailed historical and emotional sweep, this novel will stay with you long after you've turned the last page and is bound to attract child and adult readership.\n\nAbout This Edition\n\nISBN: 9781406339130 Publication date: 5th January 2012 Author: Mal Peet Publisher: Walker Books Ltd Format: Paperback Pagination: 431 pages Suitable For:\n\n11+ readers\n\n13+ readers\n\nOther Genres:\n\nChildren's Book 'Must Reads'\n\nChildren's Book Awards - Shortlists and Winners\n\nPSHE: Sexuality, Gender and Relationships\n\nAdventure Stories\n\nRecommendations:\n\nRecommended Children's eBooks\n\nMal Peet Press Reviews\n\n\"This sombre and distinguished book is as fine a piece of storytelling as you are likely to read this year.\" - The Guardian\n\n\"A novelist of immense gift and versatility.\" - Achuka\n\nAbout Mal Peet\n\nMal Peet (June 1947 – 2 March 2015), winner of the Nestle Bronze Medal Award and the Branford Boase Award grew up in North Norfolk, and studied English and American Studies at the University of Warwick. Later he moved to south-west England and worked at a variety of jobs before turning full-time to writing and illustrating in the early 1990s. With his wife, Elspeth Graham, he wrote and illustrated many educational picture books for young children, and his cartoons appeared in a number of magazines. He and Elspeth lived in Exmouth, Devon.\n\nTamar won the Carnegie Medal and is a multi-layered tale of love and betrayal. He wrote three other linked novels, Keeper, The Penalty and Exposure, all featuring the football obsessed Paul Faustino, a sports journalist in South America who is reluctantly drawn into murders and mysteries.\n\nExposure won the 2009 Guardian Award for Children’s Fiction. On his award win, Mal said, “I’m totally thrilled to win the Guardian prize. I’ve been buying the newspaper for 35 years, so I’ve worked for it! In fact, if you subtract the prize money from what I’ve spent at the newsagents, the Guardian is way ahead on the deal! I don’t mind – the Guardian prize is very special. It’s judged by other writers so it’s pretty likely that if you win it, you deserve it.”\n\nHe also wrote a critically acclaimed adult novel, The Murdstone Trilogy\n\nMore About Mal Peet"
