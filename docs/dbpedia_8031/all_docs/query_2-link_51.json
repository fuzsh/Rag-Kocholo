        "text": "He is an ebullient character who has already been to the Auckland and Sydney writers festivals on this trip and reckons he is down to his last vocal cord such has been the amount of chat he has given. But he's thrilled to be at the conference.\n\nThe Faustino novels revolve around soccer, but they are far from being football books. Peet's aim was to subvert that sort of novel - \"it struck me that pretty much all football novels were crap\" - the assumption being that only boys read them and that they were written in a sort of \"overexcited journalism style\".\n\nKeeper is the story of a boy who is no good at the sport but becomes a superstar after encountering a spectral goalkeeper who drills him in the sport and life.\n\n\"It is a classic story from the comics when I was a kid,\" Peet says, \"but instead of writing it in a comic way, I wanted to do it absolutely straight, completely seriously, to make it very passionate and very credible. And absolutely un-ironic in many ways. Just to see if I could get away with it, to see if I could devise a football book that girls would read and wouldn't conform to journalism.\"\n\nAfter the success of the book in the US, he says he feels personally responsible for a strange social phenomenon - girls becoming goalkeepers. \"I never knew that Americans would take up soccer and it's a gender-free sport in high school there.\"\n\nNow Faustino has become something of a brand, which, for a character who wasn't originally in Keeper, is remarkable. He was a device to give Peet a second voice in the book, one that was sceptical and would question the World Cup-winning goalkeeper's story of being trained by a mysterious other.\n\nPeet certainly didn't intend to write three books about Faustino.\n\n\"He's like the reader in that he's a victim of the writer - he gets drawn into things that he initially resists.\"\n\nSo in The Penalty he is literally kidnapped into the story, and in his most recent novel, Exposure, which uses Shakespeare's Othello as a framework, Faustino is following the rise and fall of a superstar.\n\nThe novels are set in an imaginary South America for entirely pragmatic reasons. Peet needed in the first one to have a boy training on a secret pitch and reckoned it could only be hidden in a rainforest. Now, he says, he's stuck there. But he's clearly interested in the politics, the religion and the history; he wants to see how heavy a load of washing he can hang on the football line.\n\n\"Keeper is about fathers ultimately and also conservation, commitment and ambition. The Penalty is about religion essentially and Exposure is about all sorts of stuff. The football is just a tenuous linkage between these things.\"\n\nFather figures are significant presences in all his books, particularly Tamar, which has a couple of them contributing to the mystery at its heart, and Peet concedes that he might well be working out his \"deeply unsatisfactory relationship\" with his own father in his writing.\n\nPeet senior joined the British army in 1933 not expecting to be involved in a war and didn't get back permanently to his Norfolk home until 1948. \"His youth was militarised, his whole life was militarised and he came back to a civilian world that he couldn't deal with,\" his son, now in his early 60s, says.\n\nThe former regimental sergeant-major moved into a council house with his wife and mother-in-law, who lived with the couple until her death. \"His life sucked, frankly, and his way of dealing with it was to absent himself. He was away when I was little and pretty soon as he got back he got a job working nights so he was asleep during the day when we were around . . . He minimised the overlap between himself and his family.\"\n\nToday Peet says they were both angry with each other. \"I was a bit odd. I read books and wanted to draw and go to art school. He thought that was just a way of sitting round looking at nude girls.\"\n\nPeet says his father was a rigid working-class man who saw school as a necessity before a job made you a man. \"So I was not very satisfactory.\"\n\nHe got through school, dealing with the conflicting urges to go to university or pursue a football career with the local team, Norwich City. \"I was really keen on playing for Norwich, but my problem was that I wasn't really competitive. I loved the game, but I was a bit gentlemanly about it.\"\n\nAcademia won out, briefly at first. He went to Warwick University in 1965 to study English and American literature but was turfed out the following year. \"I was just a Bolshie git and led a sort of mutiny.\" He returned in 1968 in time for the summer of love. \"It's amazing I got a degree because I can't remember doing any work at all. I remember getting drunk and stoned and dancing to Blind Faith and Cream.\"\n\nHe spent the next 20 years bumming around avoiding anything that hinted at a career. So he worked in a mortuary and as a plumber, and formed \"inappropriate relationships\". He started illustrating books, having written a couple of academic ones.\n\nWhen he was 40 he started writing full-time. \"I had the good fortune to be married by Elspeth (Graham)\", and she insisted. Together the couple produced many books for the education market before Peet was so bored he wanted a change. He initially conceived Keeper as a graphic novel, but no one would publish it so eventually he wrote it in prose.\n\nHis latest novel, Exposure, looks at racism and celebrity through the prism of a brilliant black sportsman and his pop-star wife. No prizes for guessing which couple inspired him, but he says it was largely counter intuitive. \"My intuitive response to celebrity is negative; to me celebrity is synonymous with a half-wit from a reality (TV) show who's been elevated to cult status and exploited by tabloids.\"\n\nBut he wondered what it would be like to be the Beckhams, pursued endlessly at the slightest indiscretion. Working one day at a crossword he needed to look for a quote in Othello and realised that all the characters' names sounded like South American footballers.\n\n\"I thought it would be an interesting challenge to see if I could cast two modern pop celebrities into a kind of Shakespearean tragedy. Fortunately I don't like the play anyway and that was liberating. I only chose Othello because it fitted. It's a very domestic tragedy, unlike the others which are rather grand and political.\"\n\nSo the David Beckham-like footballer becomes Otello, the brilliant black superstar from the north of Peet's imaginary South American country who is sold to a glamorous southern club run by a corrupt politician and where racism is an integral part of the club's identity. To make matters worse for him, Otello marries the politician's pop-star daughter Desmerelda (get it?).\n\nFaustino is covering the story and at the same time getting involved with a group of street kids. Eventually, the two plotlines merge as the anti-Otello forces unleash their hostility.\n\nPeet says that all his books are about history, but the novel he is now three-quarters through involves his own history. It's autobiographical - \"I'm so old I've had to research my past because I've forgotten it\" - and is set against the background of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and punctuated by a series of explosions. It's a love story about a working-class boy and an upper-class girl.\n\n\"There's a good deal of stuff about how hard it is to get your hands on contraceptives when the only place you can get them is at the barber's who's been cutting your hair since you were five or the chemist where your mother works. That is autobiographical.\"\n\nPeet is called a young-adult writer, but it's a category he loathes. He gets cross when people say a book is too ambitious or complex or philosophical for a teenage novel. \"It's like saying teenage fiction is a feast of the second best; because your readers are young they have to be given simple, straightforward, spoonfed, cliched bollocks.\""
