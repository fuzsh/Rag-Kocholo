        "text": "Andrew Wommack\n\nAndrew Wommack’s life was forever changed the moment he encountered the supernatural love of God on March 23, 1968. Since then, he has made it his mission to change the way the world sees God. The author of more than forty books and the founder and president of Charis Bible College, Andrew has a heart for discipleship and teaches biblical truths with clarity and simplicity.\n\nHis Gospel Truth television show emphasizes God’s unconditional love and grace and is broadcast around the globe. He started Charis Bible College in 1994 with a vision to prepare men and women for ministry with a unique blend of the teaching of God’s Word and practical “on-the-job” training. Andrew is also the president of the Truth & Liberty Coalition, an organization that seeks to educate, unify, and mobilize believers to impact culture and effect godly change on important social issues. Andrew and his wife, Jamie, have been married for more than 50 years."
