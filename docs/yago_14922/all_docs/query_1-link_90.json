Notes\n\nElisiv of Kiev - Wikipedia\n\nElisaveta was the daughter of the Grand Prince of Veliky Novgorod and Kievan Rus, Yaroslav the Wise and his consort Swedish princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden, the daughter of Swedish King Olof SkÃ¶tkonung and Estrid of the Obotrites . Elisaveta was the sister of Anastasia of Kiev who married the future Andrew I of Hungary, Anne of Kiev who married Henry I of France and possibly of Agatha, wife of Edward the Exil Her brothers included Vladimir of Novgorod, Iziaslav I of Kiev, Sviatoslav II of Kiev, Vsevolod I, Prince of Kiev and Igor Yaroslavich.\n\nDuring the winter of 1043â44, Elisaveta was married to Prince Harald Sigurdsson of Norway. Harald had left Norway in 1030 after having participated in the Battle of Stiklestad on the side of his half-brother, King Olav II of Norway. Harald had since then been under the protection of Elisiv’s father as well as that of the Byzantine monarch. They may have had at least three children.\n\nIn 1047, King Harald became the sole ruler of Norway after the death of King Magnus. In 1048, Harald took another wife, Tora Torbergsdatter with whom he had at least two sons, Magnus and Olaf. Perhaps having two wives at the same time can be explained by politics and alliance building in the 11th century."
