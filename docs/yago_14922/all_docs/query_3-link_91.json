        "text": "In 1301, King Andrew III of Hungary, the last male-line descendant of the House of Arpad, died after having been in poor health for a while. Since his acession in 1290, he had been opposed by Charles Martel of Naples, nephew of his cousin and predecessor, Ladislaus IV. After Andrew's death, Hungary went to Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, then Otto of Bavaria, then Charles Martel's son, Charles Robert.\n\nAndrew married twice, to Fenenna of Kuyavia, and when she died, Agnes of Austria, and he only had one child - Elizabeth of Töss (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Töss), who was initially betrothed to Wenceslaus III but spent the rest of her life as a nun before dying in either 1336 or 1338.\n\nWhat if either a son had been born instead of Elizabeth or Andrew had had a son with Agnes of Austria before his death? If Andrew still dies in 1301, then *Stephen VI would be between the age 4 and 10 (going by Agnes of Austria's age). Under the circumstances, would things end up like Arthur of Brittany (worst-case scenario) or Henry III of England (best case scenario)?\n\nJust before his death, Andrew's envoy to Rome noted that Pope Boniface VIII didn't support Charles Robert being sent to Hungary to be crowned king, which could either mean that he didn't support Charles Robert's claim to the throne or that he didn't think the time was right.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nIn 1301, King Andrew III of Hungary, the last male-line descendant of the House of Arpad, died after having been in poor health for a while.

OTOH, if it's Agnes' son, it will strengthen her position immeasurably, since she's to quote desmirelle \"ten-feet-tall and bullet proof\". Agnes, in such an event would have no interest in leaving the country, although her son would probably be engaged to a Habsburg girl if one's available."
