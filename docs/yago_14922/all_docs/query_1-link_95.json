        "text": "HISTORY SAYS.. UKRAINE AND RUSSIA\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about Russia wanting her empire back and that Ukraine belongs to her, but I was wondering what history says about all this?\n\n*For this reason, I decided to study, consult and analyze in order to write this publication. Trying to understand what this conflict between Russia and Ukraine is about.*\n\nI have been reading many discussions about this topic and here I leave my analysis, after days of working from the proximity of Ukraine, in the financial negotiations and listening to the sanctions procedures with their implication.\n\nFirst of all there is the feeling and the fear in Europe, that Putin wants to restore the USSR. Something that he achieved in Belarus and Kazakhstan, he also tried to do in Georgia by occupying part of the country in 2008, known as “The South Ossetia War”.\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, his initial plan was to seize it during the government of former President Yanukovych (charged and wanted in Ukraine for high treason).\n\nHowever, Ukrainians from all over the country, in a true popular revolution, went to the Maidan (Emblematic Square of Kiev), a fact that made it easier for Yanukovych to escape from the country. Fact that differentiated Ukrainians from other nations under the siege of the former USSR.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Ukrainian roots go back many centuries, being the oldest settlement of Homo Sapiens found in Ukraine (Mezhyrych Settlement). Place where the oldest map of the world was found and which dates back to 15 thousand years ago.\n\nThe first signs of civilization on the territory of Ukraine date back to 5400-2750 BC. That was the so-called Trypillya culture, the European culture is Neolithic and arose in the Ukraine between the Seret & Bug rivers, extending south to present-day Romania and Moldavia and east to the Dnieper River.\n\nIn the 9th century AD, the first state formation emerged in Kiev: Kyiv Rus. Therefore, there is a theory that the Ryurikovych dynasty that founded Kyiv Rus was of Scandinavian origin.\n\nIn 988 A.D. Kyiv Rus adopted Christianity and during the rule of Yaroslav \"The Wise\", the country reached the peak of its development, (Kyiv Rus has great recognition in Old Europe).\n\nUkrainian Legacies\n\nYaroslav married the daughter of the King of Sweden, as a result of which his daughter Anastasia of Kiev was married to the King of Hungary, while his other daughter Anna of Kiev married Henry I of France and was regent of France during the minority of his son.\n\nOrigin of the Word Ukraine\n\nThe toponymic name \"Ukraine\" was first mentioned in the Ipatiyiv Chronicle of 1187 AD. quick facts that illustrate what Ukraine was like in those days.\n\nAnd where was Moscow at that time?\n\nThe answer is; that it was nowhere, it just didn't exist at all. Russia was an uninhabited swampy area and the first signs of civilization there date back to the 12th century. Before the attack of the Mongol-Tatars in the 13th century, they were part of the kingdom of Kyiv Rus.\n\n*The Mongol Tatars ruined Kiev and that promoted the development of remote principalities*.\n\nThat was the beginning of the rise of Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukraine was divided between Lithuania, Poland. However, in the 14th and 15th centuries, Ukraine was reborn again with the rise of the Cossack state. It seems that this is a long history of Ukrainians fighting for their right to an independent state.\n\nThe first Russian Constitution was written by Pylyp Orlyk in the Ukraine. Also the first University of Eastern Europe was founded in the 16th century in Ostrog.\n\nAfter the First World War, the Ukrainians tried to restore the independent state.\n\nIn fact, it existed for a couple of years but was ended by the Russian invasion led by Lenin's troops. At that time, the western part of Ukraine was under the patronage of Poland and Austria/Hungary, while the eastern part was occupied by Soviet troops.\n\nUkrainian villages with their farmers heroically resisted Soviet rule and so-called \"collectivization\". The communists confiscated all property, cattle and grain to finance the expansion of the Soviet government worldwide. The rest of the assets became the basis for state-owned collective farms (so-called kolkhozes).\n\nThousands of rebellions in all Ukrainian villages led Stalin to arrange for millions of people living in rural areas to starve to death. This became known as Holodomor (1932-1933 period),\n\n*Event that ended the lives of at least 10 million Ukrainians.*\n\nUkrainians suffered the greatest losses of people during World War II among other Soviet republics. After World War II, another tragedy was related to the occupation of western Ukraine by the Soviet army.\n\nThis is the reason why the Ukrainian population says “Never Again” when they commemorate the victims of the Soviet era in Ukraine.\n\nThis is also why the citizens of the world would like to have a ruler ready to give his life for his country, his people and not like the rest of the planet where citizens give their lives for them, submerged in injustice and inequality. “That is why the world looks at them as the 300 of our time”.\n\nNowadays\n\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet juggernaut in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence.\n\nI hope that the world understands that Ukraine has a strong historical heritage of sovereignty.\n\nAfter that, the people had to prove the right to live in their independent state several times: in 2004/2005 during the Orange Revolution, in 2013/2014 in the days of “The Revolution of Dignity”, in 2014-2022 resisting the Russian occupation of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine (Donbass).\n\nThat is why they are perceived as prepared to return to fight for their land because it is in our blood. Most feel the strong ties to their ancestors who gave them the opportunity to live in their own independent state. As you will now understand, they are a nation with a great history and values that differ from the Russians.\n\n*They just want to live in peace in their own country.*\n\nNow, Putin being the former head of the KGB is a product of that Soviet era. He sees himself as a ruler of the post-Soviet Empire. And as they say “An Empire exists until it expands”.\n\nRussia's economy is based on natural resources, mainly oil and gas, which it uses as a means to manipulate the rest of the world.\n\nA couple of times here I have heard the argument that NATO's expansion to the East threatens Russia and causes Putin to attack Ukraine. This is debatable, since the Baltic States were accepted into the EU and NATO a long time ago and are much closer to major Russian cities (such as St. Petersburg) than to Ukraine.\n\nIs NATO going to attack Russia to defend Ukraine?\n\nWhat he has shown so far is courtesy to the Russian weapons deployment.\n\nPossible Scenarios\n\nThe most \"optimistic\" is to participate in massive cyber attacks (several just happened this week) and also terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nAnother \"medium\" plan is only escalation in the Ukraine region and not adding other countries. The ultimate goal in this case would be further seizure of the eastern and southern regions, including key seaports.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be a massive military campaign to gain control of Kiev, invited by the mediocre support of the US and Europe, who made it clear that the cost of the \"acquisition\" would be only economic. Which is not on the Kremlin's list of concerns as it envisions extended facilities from the world.\n\nThe Ukraine has only 450,000 men and civilian Ukrainians who are holding out.\n\nIf this spreads, Putin will be the one who must explain to the Russian people why his soldiers die in Ukraine.\n\nThe outcome really depends on the US and the EU. There is still a high chance of avoiding major losses if US diplomacy uses very direct language to explain to him the high price he will pay for his ambitions.\n\nIn Ukraine they no longer expect NATO soldiers to die for Ukraine, the people are willing to do that job. However, in the international community, \"face-to-face\" and not \"virtual\" support from the US and Europe is expected, not in terms of sanctions.\n\nYes in more severe weapon mode.\n\nThe Americans should, especially after failing in Afghanistan. The reason they shouldn't stay away from the battle in Ukraine is because China is taking note to qualify Putin for his aggressive move on Ukraine. China and Russia just want to test the US ability to protect its allies and if Russia takes over Ukraine, Taiwan may be one of the next countries to be invaded by China.\n\nAuthor: Diego Balverde\n\nSenior Economist at International Monetary Fund\n\n&"
