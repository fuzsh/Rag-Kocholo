        "text": "Goldie Jeanne Hawn was born November 21, 1945 in Washington, D.C. to Laura Hawn, who owned a dance school, and Rut Hawn, a band musician. She has one sister, entertainment publicist Patti Hawn; a brother, Edward, died in infancy before her birth. She was raised in the Jewish religion. Her mother was Jewish and the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. Her father was Presbyterian. At the age of three, Goldie began taking ballet and tap dance lessons, and at the age of ten she danced in the chorus of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo production of \"The Nutcracker\". At the age of 19 she ran and instructed a ballet school, having dropped out of college where she was majoring in drama. Before going into the film business she worked as a professional dancer.\n\nHawn made her feature film debut in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968), with a small role as a giggling dancer. Her first big role came in 1969, where she played opposite Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman in Die Kaktusblüte (1969), a role which earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. After the Oscar win her career took off and she followed with roles in successful comedies such as Ein Mädchen in der Suppe (1970) and Shampoo (1975), and more dramatic roles in Das Mädchen von Petrovka (1974) and Sugarland Express (1974). In 1978, she starred alongside Chevy Chase in the box office hit, Eine ganz krumme Tour (1978). In 1980 she starred in another box office hit, Schütze Benjamin (1980), where she also served as producer. During the 1980s she starred in hit movies such as Zwei dicke Freunde (1982), Protocol - Alles tanzt nach meiner Pfeife (1984) and American Wildcats (1986). In 1987, she appeared with her boyfriend Kurt Russell in Overboard - Ein Goldfisch fällt ins Wasser (1987), which became both a critical and box office disappointment. Her career slowed down after that until 1990 when she starred alongside Mel Gibson in Ein Vogel auf dem Drahtseil (1990). In 1992 she starred in the successful film, Der Tod steht ihr gut (1992), with Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis, which was followed by another successful film Housesitter - Lügen haben schöne Beine (1992), which co-starred Steve Martin. In 1996 she played the role of an aging alcoholic actress in the comedy, Der Club der Teufelinnen (1996), with Diane Keaton and Bette Midler; it became a critical and financial success. She also starred in the Woody Allen film Alle sagen: I love you (1996) and Schlaflos in New York (1999), which reunited her with Martin. In 2001 and 2002 she starred in Stadt, Land, Kuss (2001) with Warren Beatty, and Groupies Forever (2002) with Susan Sarandon.\n\nGoldie has been married twice. First to dancer/director Gus Trikonis from 1969 to 1973. In 1976 she married musician Bill Hudson and became a mother for the first time that year, when she gave birth to their son Oliver Hudson. In 1979, she had her second child with Hudson, daughter Kate Hudson. The marriage ended in divorce in 1980. Since 1983, she has been having a relationship with actor Kurt Russell. Their son Wyatt Russell was born in 1986. Goldie is also a de-facto stepmother to Kurt's son Boston Russell. She has eight grandchildren.\n\nAlmost everyone who has spent time with Kate Hudson -including directors, family members, co-stars and interviewers - is quick to comment on her ability to light up a room. Through some combination of a winning smile, solid work ethic, and good old-fashioned talent, the young actress has gone from indie beginner to Vanity Fair cover girl in just three years. What's more, she's done it all without capitalizing on the success of legendary actress mom, Goldie Hawn.\n\nKate Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, to Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, a comedian, actor and singer. She was raised by her mother and her mother's longtime boyfriend, actor Kurt Russell, whom she considers to be her father. Kate is the sister of actor Oliver Hudson, the half-sister of actor and hockey player Wyatt Russell, and the granddaughter of band musician Rut Hawn. She is the niece of entertainment publicist Patti Hawn, record producer Mark Hudson and musician Brett Hudson. Kate is of Hungarian Jewish (from her maternal grandmother), Italian (from her paternal grandmother), English, and German ancestry.\n\nBy all accounts, Hudson was a born performer - as a child she danced and sang at every opportunity. Her family hoped that she would attend New York University after graduating from high school, but she opted to get her feet wet in the professional acting world first. She made her big-screen debut as an ambitious young starlet stranded in a tiny California town in Desert Blue (1998). Her next two films, while critically panned, made it into wider release: Eine Nacht in New York (1999) (in which she played an earnest but accident-prone ditz) and Tödliche Gerüchte (2000) (which cast her as a rich, virginal college student). Perhaps Hudson's biggest break was landing the role of rock groupie (or \"Band Aide\") Penny Lane in Almost Famous - Fast berühmt (2000). The part was originally intended for Sarah Polley; when Polley backed out to pursue another project, director Cameron Crowe considered scrapping the film altogether. Hudson, who had been cast in a smaller role (as William's stewardess sister), begged for a chance to read for Penny. Crowe was impressed, Hudson got the part, and the show went on. As much as Tinseltown gossipmongers would like to put them at odds, mother and daughter agree that Hawn is one of Hudson's biggest supporters.\n\nSzohr was born in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin and is of Hungarian and one quarter African American ancestry. Szohr played soccer, served on the student council, and was part of the cheerleading squad while in school. She started a cleaning company with a friend, cleaning their teachers' houses.\n\nSzohr started modeling at age six. Her first national campaign was for Quaker Oats at age ten, and she also appeared in print ads for Kohl's department store. Subsequent modeling gigs followed, including prints for Crate & Barrel, Mountain Dew, Sears, Jockey and JanSport. Szohr graduated from Menomonee Falls High School a semester early and moved to Los Angeles with her mother at the age of 17 to pursue an acting career. She initially aspired to become an interior designer and had enrolled in Columbia College Chicago, but her agent ultimately convinced her to try pilot season auditions.\n\nSzohr made her debut as an actress in 2003 in an episode of the third season of What's Up, Dad? (2000), titled Not So Hostile Takeover (2003). Her first film was Uncle Nino (2003) playing a minor role as The MC. She appeared in numerous guest teen television series such as Raven blickt durch (2003), Drake & Josh (2004), Hallo Holly (2002), and Die himmlische Joan (2003). She also appeared in three episodes of CSI: Miami (2002) as Samantha Barrish.\n\nIn 2007, she appeared in a major recurring role as Laura for six episodes in the ABC drama series What About Brian (2006). She also appeared in the music videos for Daughtry: Over You (2007) by Daughtry, in which she played Sarah.\n\nIn the same year, Szohr earned her breakthrough role on the hit CW teen drama series Gossip Girl (2007). She plays Vanessa Abrams. The portrayal of Vanessa has drawn criticism from Ziegesar. Originally cast as a recurring role, Szohr was promoted to series regular after the season one episode The Blair Bitch Project (2008) in April 2008. In May 2011, it was confirmed Szohr would not be returning for the fifth season. She returned in for a cameo appearance on the series finale, New York, I Love You XOXO (2012), on December 17, 2012.\n\nSzohr has appeared in small roles in films such as Somebody Help Me (2007), The Reading Room (2005) and Fired Up! (2009). She signed on to Dimension Films' horror Piranha 3D (2010), in the role of Kelly. She also appeared in a Funny or Die video promoting the film alongside Kelly Brook and others.\n\nIn April 2010, Szohr joined the cast of the romantic comedy Love, Wedding, Marriage - Ein Plan zum Verlieben (2011), along with Mandy Moore and Kellan Lutz. Szohr has a role in the 2012 independent post-apocalyptic sci-fi film Hirokin (2012). Her role as Orange has been described as a \"cunning temptress\".\n\nSzohr stars in the indie drama Art Machine (2012) as an outlaw hipster and a pyrotechnic artist. In October 2011, she finished filming a horror comedy film in East Lothian, Scotland titled Love Bite - Nichts ist safer als Sex (2012) with co-star Ed Speleers. Szohr appeared in Taylor Swift's 2013 music video for the song Taylor Swift: 22 (2013). In March 2013, she was cast as the female lead in the Fox drama pilot The List (2013), playing FBI agent Natalie Voss. However, it was reported on May 8, 2013 that Fox had passed on the pilot. In November 2013, Szohr was cast as Gretchen in USA Network's medical drama pilot Complications (2015).\n\nIn June 2015, Szohr was set as a recurring on the upcoming second season of DirecTV's MMA drama Kingdom (2014). Szohr will play Laura Melvin, an artist/photographer who has \"read everything, been everywhere,\" and immediately intrigued by Jay (Jonathan Tucker) whom she wants to hire for a photo shoot.\n\nScreen legend, superstar, and the man with the most famous blue eyes in movie history, Paul Leonard Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, the second son of Arthur Sigmund Newman (died 1950) and Theresa Fetsko (died 1982). His elder brother was Arthur S. Newman Jr., named for their father, a Jewish businessman who owned a successful sporting goods store and was the son of emigrants from Poland and Hungary. Newman's mother (born Terézia Fecková, daughter of Stefan Fecko and Mária Polenak) was a Roman Catholic Slovak from Homonna, Pticie (former Austro-Hungarian Empire), who became a practicing Christian Scientist. She and her brother, Newman's uncle Joe, had an interest in the creative arts, and it rubbed off on him. He acted in grade school and high school plays. The Newmans were well-to-do and Paul Newman grew up in affluent Shaker Heights. Before he became an actor, Newman ran the family sporting goods store in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBy 1950, the 25-year-old Newman had been kicked out of Ohio University, where he belonged to the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, for unruly behavior (denting the college president's car with a beer keg), served three years in the United States Navy during World War II as a radio operator, graduated from Ohio's Kenyon College, married his first wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Witte (born 1929), and had his first child, Scott. That same year, his father died. When he became successful in later years, Newman said if he had any regrets it would be that his father was not around to witness his success. He brought Jackie back to Shaker Heights and he ran his father's store for a short period. Then, knowing that wasn't the career path he wanted to take, he moved Jackie and Scott to New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Yale University's School of Drama.\n\nWhile doing a play there, Newman was spotted by two agents, who invited him to come to New York City to pursue a career as a professional actor. After moving to New York, he acted in guest spots for various television series and in 1953 came a big break. He got the part of understudy of the lead role in the successful Broadway play \"Picnic\". Through this play, he met actress Joanne Woodward (born 1930), who was also an understudy in the play. While they got on very well and there was a strong attraction, Newman was married and his second child, Susan, was born that year. During this time, Newman was accepted into the much admired and popular New York Actors Studio, although he did not actually audition.\n\nIn 1954, a film Newman was very reluctant to do was released, Basilus - Held von Rom (1954). He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He had always been embarrassed about the film and reveled in making fun of it. He immediately wanted to return to the stage, and performed in \"The Desperate Hours\". In 1956, he got the chance to redeem himself in the film world by portraying boxer Rocky Graziano in Die Hölle ist in mir (1956), and critics praised his performance. In 1957, with a handful of films to his credit, he was cast in Der lange heiße Sommer (1958), co-starring Joanne Woodward.\n\nDuring the shooting of this film, they realized they were meant to be together and by now, so did his then-wife Jackie, who gave Newman a divorce. He and Woodward wed in Las Vegas in January 1958. They went on to have three daughters together and raised them in Westport, Connecticut. In 1959, Newman received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in Die Katze auf dem heißen Blechdach (1958). The 1960s would bring Newman into superstar status, as he became one of the most popular actors of the decade, and garnered three more Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Haie der Großstadt (1961), Der Wildeste unter tausend (1963) and Der Unbeugsame (1967). In 1968, his debut directorial effort Die Liebe eines Sommers (1968) was given good marks, and although the film and Woodward were nominated for Oscars, Newman was not nominated for Best Director. However, he did win a Golden Globe Award for his direction.\n\n1969 brought the popular screen duo of Newman and Robert Redford together for the first time when Butch Cassidy und Sundance Kid (1969) was released. It was a box office smash. Through the 1970s, Newman had hits and misses from such popular films as Der Clou (1973) and Flammendes Inferno (1974) to lesser known films as Das war Roy Bean (1972) to a cult classic Schlappschuß (1977). After the death of his only son, Scott, in 1978, Newman's personal life and film choices moved in a different direction. His acting work in the 1980s and on is what is often most praised by critics today. He became more at ease with himself and it was evident in The Verdict - Die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit (1982) for which he received his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination and, in 1987, finally received his first Oscar for Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), almost thirty years after Woodward had won hers. Friend and director of Die Hölle ist in mir (1956), Robert Wise accepted the award on Newman's behalf as the actor did not attend the ceremony.\n\nFilms were not the only thing on his mind during this period. A passionate race car driver since the early 1970s (despite being color-blind), he was co-founder of Newman-Haas racing in 1982, and also founded \"Newman's Own\", a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which Newman donated to charity. He also started The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, an organization for children with serious illness. He was as well known for his philanthropic ways and highly successful business ventures as he was for his legendary actor status.\n\nNewman's marriage to Woodward lasted a half-century. Connecticut was their primary residence after leaving Hollywood and moving East in 1960. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies. During his later years, he still attended races, was much involved in his charitable organizations, and in 2006, he opened a restaurant called Dressing Room, which helps out the Westport Country Playhouse, a place in which Newman took great pride. In 2007, while the public was largely unaware of the serious illness from which he was suffering, Newman made some headlines when he said he was losing his invention and confidence in his acting abilities and that acting was \"pretty much a closed book for me\". A smoker for many years, Newman died on September 26, 2008, aged 83, from lung cancer.\n\nTony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz, the eldest of three children of Helen (Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. Curtis himself admits that while he had almost no formal education, he was a student of the \"school of hard knocks\" and learned from a young age that the only person who ever had his back was himself, so he learned how to take care of both himself and younger brother, Julius. Curtis grew up in poverty, as his father, Emanuel, who worked as a tailor, had the sole responsibility of providing for his entire family on his meager income. This led to constant bickering between Curtis's parents over money, and Curtis began to go to movies as a way of briefly escaping the constant worries of poverty and other family problems. The financial strain of raising two children on a meager income became so tough that in 1935, Curtis's parents decided that their children would have a better life under the care of the state and briefly had Tony and his brother admitted to an orphanage. During this lonely time, the only companion Curtis had was his brother, Julius, and the two became inseparable as they struggled to get used to this new way of life. Weeks later, Curtis's parents came back to reclaim custody of Tony and his brother, but by then Curtis had learned one of life's toughest lessons: the only person you can count on is yourself.\n\nIn 1938, shortly before Tony's Bar Mitzvah, tragedy struck when Tony lost the person most important to him when his brother, Julius, was hit by a truck and killed. After that tragedy, Curtis's parents became convinced that a formal education was the best way Tony could avoid the same never-knowing-where-your-next-meal-is-coming-from life that they had known. However, Tony rejected this because he felt that learning about literary classics and algebra wasn't going to advance him in life as much as some real hands-on life experience would. He was to find that real-life experience a few years later, when he enlisted in the navy in 1942. Tony spent over two years getting that life experience doing everything from working as a crewman on a submarine tender, the USS Proteus (AS-19), to honing his future craft as an actor performing as a sailor in a stage play at the Navy Signalman School in Illinois.\n\nIn 1945, Curtis was honorably discharged from the navy, and when he realized that the GI Bill would allow him to go to acting school without paying for it, he now saw that his lifelong pipe dream of being an actor might actually be achievable. Curtis auditioned for the New York Dramatic Workshop, and after being accepted on the strength of his audition piece (a scene from \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in pantomime), Curtis enrolled in early 1947. He then began to pay his dues by appearing in a slew of stage productions, including \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Golden Boy\". He then connected with a small theatrical agent named Joyce Selznick, who was the niece of film producer David O. Selznick. After seeing his potential, Selznick arranged an interview for Curtis to see David O. Selznick at Universal Studios, where Curtis was offered a seven-year contract. After changing his name to what he saw as an elegant, mysterious moniker--\"Tony Curtis\" (named after the novel Ein rastloses Leben (1936) by Hervey Allen and a cousin of his named Janush Kertiz)--Curtis began making a name for himself by appearing in small, offbeat roles in small-budget productions. His first notable performance was a two-minute role in Gewagtes Alibi (1949), with Burt Lancaster, in which he makes Lancaster jealous by dancing with Yvonne De Carlo. This offbeat role resulted in Curtis's being typecast as a heavy for the next few years, such as playing a gang member in Die Brut des Satans (1949).\n\nCurtis continued to build up a show reel by accepting any paying job, acting in a number of bit-part roles for the next few years. It wasn't until late 1949 that he finally got the chance to demonstrate his acting flair, when he was cast in an important role in an action western, Sierra (1950). On the strength of his performance in that movie, Curtis was finally cast in a big-budget movie, Winchester 73 (1950). While he appears in that movie only very briefly, it was a chance for him to act alongside a Hollywood legend, James Stewart.\n\nAs his career developed, Curtis wanted to act in movies that had social relevance, ones that would challenge audiences, so he began to appear in such movies as Spartacus (1960) and Flucht in Ketten (1958). He was advised against appearing as the subordinate sidekick in Spartacus (1960), playing second fiddle to the equally famous Kirk Douglas. However, Curtis saw no problem with this because the two had recently acted together in dual leading roles in Die Wikinger (1958).\n\nThe great American escape artist and magician Houdini (immortalized by a memorable performance by Tony Curtis in the eponymous 1953 film) was born Erich Weiss on March 24, 1874 in Budapest, Hungary, though he often gave his birthplace as Appleton, Wisconsin, where he was raised. One of five brothers and one daughter born to rabbi Samuel Weiss and his wife Cecilia, the future Houdini was four years old when his parents emigrated to the U.S., where Weiss, as \"Harry Houdini\", became one of the major celebrities of the first age dominated by the mass media.\n\nHis boyhood was spent in poverty and, when he was 17, he conjured up a magic act with his friend Jack Hayman, in order to escape the poverty and anonymity of manual labor which would likely have been his lot in life. Young Erich had been fascinated with magic since he was a young lad, when he was in the audience of a magic show put on by a traveling magician named Dr. Lynch. Billing themselves as the \"Houdini Bros.\" in tribute to French magician Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, Erich Weiss became an entertainer, though it took him some seven years to catch on.\n\nWeiss and Hayman specialized in the Crate Escape (eventually known as Metamorphosis or The Substitution Trunk), and Houdini's brother Theodore replaced Hayman when he became uninterested in the act. Eventually, Theodore -- billed as Hardeen -- was replaced by Wilhemina Rahner (known as Bess), the woman \"Harry Houdini\" would eventually marry. The marriage on June 22, 1894 caused a conflict with his Jewish family as Bess was a Roman Catholic. They married in secret, then again at a synagogue and in a Catholic church to please both of their families.\n\nWhile developing his act, Houdini was not above the old carny trick of posing as a spirit medium, making the rounds of the town clerk's office and nearby cemeteries in order to provide \"messages from beyond\". In 1896, while visiting a doctor friend in Nova Scotia, he saw his first strait jacket, which gave him the idea of developing an act in which he would escape from it.\n\nHoudini finally hit the big-time when he was 24 years old with his Challenge Act in 1898, while he was making the rounds of vaudeville. Houdini's Challenge Act consisted of him escaping from a pair of handcuffs produced by an audience member. Eventually, this evolved into escapes from strait jackets, boxes, crates, safes, and other instruments and devices (such as his Water Torture Cell), as well as from jail cells. Houdini was also adept at escaping from being \"buried alive\". Hand-cuffed and strait-jacketed, he could escape while being hung upside down from a crane, or while lowered from a bridge, or even make his escape from padlocked crates lowered into a river.\n\nHoudini also became famous as a debunker of mediums and \"experts\" of the paranormal, but this was done in hope he could find an actual medium that could communicate with the dead so that he could communicate with his beloved mother Cecilia after she passed away. He became quite famous in the ragtime age of the first quarter of the last century, even appearing in motion pictures produced by his own company.\n\nHarry Houdini, the greatest magician ever produced by America, died in Detroit, Michigan during a national tour. The cause of death officially was peritonitis from a ruptured appendix. His death came nine days after having been punched in the stomach during the Canadian leg of the tour by J. Gordon Whitehead, a McGill University student who was testing Houdini's famed ability to take body blows. Always the trouper, Houdini had soldiered on despite stomach pains. (Early during the tour, he had broken an ankle but did not let it stop him or the tour.) His wife Bess, to whom Houdini left his half-million dollar estate, collected a double indemnity on his life insurance policy, as the blow was considered to have shortened the great magician's life and contributed to his premature death at the age of 52.\n\nThe date of his death was October 31, 1926 -- Halloween, one of three days (October 31-November 2) of Samhain, the Celtic New Year, when the veil between the living and the dead allegedly is at its thinnest and the living can make contact with the dead. Annually on Halloween from 1927 to 1937, Bess held a séance to try to contact her departed husband. She did not succeed, though she helped keep the memory of her husband alive in the American consciousness. Even today, magicians worldwide conduct séances on Halloween in an effort to contact the late escapologist.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix was born Joaquin Rafael Bottom in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Arlyn (Dunetz) and John Bottom, and is the middle child in a brood of five. His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family from New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe.\n\nThe family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982).\n\nHe worked with his brother again on the afterschool special Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp Space Camp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.\n\nHis parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Private Idaho (1991) and Cowgirl Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right.\n\nHis follow-up turn in Die Abbotts - Wenn Haß die Liebe tötet (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U-Turn - Kein Weg zurück (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Für das Leben eines Freundes (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Lebende Ziele (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8mm: Acht Millimeter (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.\n\nLater that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards - Im Hinterhof der Macht (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Quills - Macht der Besessenheit (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Walk the Line (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\nMariska (Ma-rish-ka) Magdolna Hargitay was born on January 23, 1964, in Santa Monica, California. Her parents are Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield. She is the youngest of their three children. In June 1967, Mariska and her brothers Zoltan and Mickey Jr. were in the back seat of a car when it was involved in the fatal accident which killed her mother. The children escaped with minor injuries. Her father remarried a stewardess named Ellen, and they raised the three children and gave them a normal childhood. They also financially supported the children, since Jayne Mansfield's debt-ridden estate left no money for them.\n\nMariska majored in theater at UCLA. Her first motion picture feature was the cult favorite, Ghoulies (1984), where she gave a memorable performance as Donna. Unlike her mother Jayne, who had changed her name, her hair color, and did nude pictorials to become a star, Mariska took a very different approach on her journey to become a star. She rejected advice to change her name and appearance. And she refused to copy her mother's sexy image by turning down nude scenes in her next film Jocks (1986). She told casting directors that she was her own person when she held onto her dark locks and athletic figure, when they were expecting another blond, buxom Jayne Mansfield. Mariska continued with her acting classes and waited on tables, while she landed forgettable roles in short-lived television shows. She appeared a few times on the nighttime soap Falcon Crest (1981). She also appeared in the hit film Leaving Las Vegas: Liebe bis in den Tod (1995), credited as 'Hooker at the bar', and in the flop film Lake Placid (1999) as Myra Okubo. Her recurring role on the top-rated show Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994) in 1998 gave her career enough of a jolt to land her the starring role of Det. Olivia Benson in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), the first spin off from the excellent franchise of Law & Order (1990). The hour-long show deals with sex crimes and the detectives who solve these cases. Mariska played Olivia as a tough, compassionate detective, who did action scenes and her own stunt work. She reaped the rewards from the hit TV show, after struggling and studying her craft for fifteen years. She became the highest paid actress on television, and she won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her performance. The show also changed her personal life, since she met her husband actor Peter Hermann on the set and married him on August 28, 2004. That same year, she appeared in the television movie Plain Truth (2004), in which she played attorney Ellie Harrison. Mariska became an activist, when fans of her show who were abused, would write to her, and she founded a non-profit organization called \"Joyful Heart Foundation\" to help \"survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse.\"\n\nMariska gave birth to her son August in 2006. But that tremendous joy was soon followed by tremendous sadness when her beloved father Mickey died just two months later at the age of 80. Mariska and her husband Peter adopted two children, a girl named Amaya, and a boy named Andrew, within a span of few months in 2011.\n\nMariska speaks English, Hungarian, French, Spanish, and Italian, and her husband also speaks several languages, including his native language German. They divide their time between New York and Los Angeles.\n\nMichael Vartan came to international acclaim with his starring role as 'Agent Michael Vaughn' on the worldwide hit ABC series, \"Alias,\" which ran for five seasons. With upcoming film and television roles, he continues to explore the different facets of his talent and versatility.\n\nVartan currently stars in E!'s original one-hour drama series \"The Arrangement,\" about the relationship between an A-list movie star 'Kyle West' (Josh Henderson) and his beautiful young co-star 'Megan Morrison' (Christine Evangelista). Vartan portrays 'Terrence Anderson,' best friend, producing partner and mentor to 'Kyle,' as well as leader of a fictitious self-help organization called the Institute of the Higher Mind. His influence on Kyle's life is pervasive, and when 'Kyle' begins to date 'Megan,' 'Terrence' becomes particularly invested, presenting her with a marriage contract to ensure that the 'The Arrangement' goes as planned. E! will debut the 10-episode first season on March 5, 2017.\n\nHe played a key role in Season 2 of A&E's \"Bates Motel\" as 'George,' a charming divorcé who caught the eye of Norma (played by Emmy-nominee Vera Farmiga). He also had a recurring role in USA Network's \"Satisfaction.\" He previously starred for three seasons alongside Jada Pinkett Smith in TNT's medical drama \"HawthoRNe.\"\n\nOn the feature front, Vartan next appears in the indie thriller \"Small Town Crime,\" with Academy Award nominee John Hawkes. The storyline revolves around a boozing ex-cop 'Mike' (Hawkes) who becomes a makeshift private investigator to solve the murder of a young prostitute. Vartan plays 'Detective Scott Crawford' who is investigating the murder and knows that 'Mike' has messed up in the past, yet to a certain extent still believes in him and trusts him to carry out his private investigation as long as he reports back to him with his findings. The film will make its World Premiere at the SXSW Film Festival on March 11, 2017.\n\nVartan previously starred opposite Zoe Saldana (\"Avatar\") in TriStar Pictures' \"Colombiana.\" In 2011, he starred opposite Jessica Chastain, as 'Brad Benton' in the independent film \"Jolene: My Life,\" for director Dan Ireland (\"The Whole Wide World\"). Based on a story from critically acclaimed author, E.L. Doctorow (\"Ragtime,\" \"Billy Bathgate\").\n\nHe previously starred opposite Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez in New Line's summer blockbuster, \"Monster-In-Law.\" He also starred opposite Robin Williams in the psychological thriller, \"One Hour Photo.\" Additional film credits include a starring role opposite Drew Barrymore in the romantic comedy \"Never Been Kissed.\"\n\nBorn in Paris to a French father and an American mother, Vartan grew up in the tiny Normandy village of Fleury until the age of 16 when he moved to Los Angeles to live with his mother, who encouraged him to take acting classes.\n\nAfter starring in two small French films, Vartan grabbed the attention of the film world with his breakthrough performance in the 1993 Italian epic, \"Fiorile,\" directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani. Soon after, Vartan signed with an agent and landed a role in \"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar,\" playing the bigoted small-town thug who harasses three drag queens (Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo). He went on to star opposite David Schwimmer as one of his best friends in \"The Pallbearer,\" a comedy of escapades surrounding three old high school pals coping with bachelorhood, marriage and a case of mistaken identity. He also starred in Sony Pictures Classics' \"The Myth of Fingerprints\" with Julianne Moore.\n\nFor television, Vartan appeared in the two-part TNT mini-series \"The Mists of Avalon,\" a retelling of the legendary story of Camelot. He portrayed 'Sir Lancelot,' opposite Angelica Huston, Julianna Margulies and Joan Allen.\n\nIn his limited free time, Vartan feeds his obsession with sports, particularly ice hockey. \"If it weren't for acting, I'd give anything to play a professional sport,\" he says, still holding onto his life-long dream."
