        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2012, revised 2022\n\nAlthough more attention is paid to the eighteen Romanovs who were horribly killed during the Russian Revolution, far more Romanovs and their spouses and children, their morganatic spouses and children, and other family members escaped Russia. Some struggled and some had successful lives. Quite a number of them lived long lives. Read more about them by using the links on their names. Unofficial Royalty links are noted with an asterisk*.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Russian Titles and Patronymics\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Tsardom of Russia/Russian Empire Index\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Romanovs Killed During the Russian Revolution\n\nAll photos are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.\n\nAt the time of the abdication of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia on March 15, 1917, these Romanovs were living in other countries:\n\nGrand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich* (1891 – 1942), son of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich (son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia) who was killed by the Bolsheviks in January 1919, half-brother of Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley who was killed by the Bolsheviks in July 1918, Dmitri had been exiled to Persia (now Iran) for his role in the murder of Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin\n\nGrand Duke Michael Mikhailovich (1861 – 1929), son of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich (son of Nicholas I, Emperor of All Russia), Michael was living in exile in London, England because of his morganatic marriage to Countess Sophie von Merenberg, later Countess de Torby.

Three of her six brothers were murdered by the Bolsheviks: Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich in July 1918 and Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich and Grand Duke George Mikhailovich in January 1919.\n\nGrand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna, Princess of Greece and Denmark* (1882 – 1957), daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia), wife of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, Elena was living in Greece\n\n*********************\n\nAt the time of the abdication of Nicholas II, these Romanov morganatic wives and children from morganatic marriages were living in other countries:\n\nPrincess Ekaterina Mikhailovna Dolgorukova, Princess Yurievskaya* (1847 – 1922), morganatic second wife and widow of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia, was living in France. Ekaterina had left Russia shortly after the assassination of her husband Alexander II in 1888\n\nPrincess Olga Alexandrovna Yurievskaya, Countess von Merenberg (1874 – 1925), daughter of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia and his morganatic second wife Princess Ekaterina Mikhailovna Dolgorukova, Princess Yurievskaya, Olga was the wife of Count Georg Nikolaus von Merenberg and was living in Prussia, now part of Germany\n\nCountess Sophie Nikolaievna of Merenberg, Countess de Torby (1868 – 1927), morganatic wife of Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich (grandson of Nicholas I, Emperor of All Russia), Sophie was living in London, England with her husband and three children:\n\nCountess Anastasia Mikhailovna de Torby (1892 – 1977)\n\nCountess Nadejda Mikhailovna de Torby* (1896 – 1963), married George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, Nadejda was an aunt by marriage of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n\nCount Michael Mikhailovich de Torby (1898 – 1959)\n\n*********************\n\nThese Romanov morganatic wives and children from morganatic marriages managed to escape:\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich Brasov, Count Brasov (1910 – 1931), son of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich (son of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and brother of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia) who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918 and his morganatic wife Countess Natalia Sergeievna Brassova – After his father was arrested on March 7, 1918, his mother, concerned for his safety, arranged to have George and his nanny smuggled out of Russia with the help of the Danish Embassy. George and his nanny safely reached the Danish Embassy in Berlin where they were given shelter by the ambassador Count Carl Moltke.\n\nCountess Natalia Sergeievna Brasova* (1880 – 1952), morganatic wife of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich who was killed by the Bolsheviks in June 1918 (son of Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and brother of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia) – After going through several periods of house arrests, Michael was arrested on March 7, 1918, along with his British secretary Nicholas Johnson, and imprisoned at the Bolshevik headquarters in St. Petersburg. Four days later, Michael and Johnson were sent to Perm, a thousand miles to the east. Natalia obtained a travel permit so she could join Michael in Perm. However, Michael and Natasha’s reunion did not last long. Because the Bolsheviks and the White Army were fighting in the area, Michael and Natasha feared that she could become trapped in Perm in a dangerous situation and so Natasha left on May 18, 1918, for Moscow. On June 13, 1918, Michael and his secretary were taken to the woods near Perm and shot. Their bodies have never been found.\n\nReturning to Petrograd, which was the new name for St. Petersburg, Natasha immediately began to plan a second trip to be with Michael but she received a telegram from Perm about his “disappearance”. When she met with the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, Natalia accused them of killing Michael and she was put in prison. Ten weeks later she feigned illness and was transferred to a nursing home from which she managed to escape. The Germans believed the widespread rumors that Michael was still alive and decided to help Natalia escape Russia in an attempt to gain influence with Michael. Through the German-controlled Ukrainian consulate, Natalia and Tata, her 15-year-old daughter from her first marriage, were provided with false passports. They then traveled to Kyiv which was under German occupation and on to Odessa where they boarded the British destroyer HMS Nereide which took them to Constantinople.\n\nPrincess Ekaterina Alexandrovna Yurievskaya (1878 – 1959), daughter of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia and his morganatic second wife Princess Ekaterina Mikhailovna Dolgorukova, Princess Yurievskaya. In 1917, Ekaterina was in Russia with her second husband Prince Sergei Platonovich Obolensky. Reportedly, she walked miles without food, suffering great hardship. Eventually, Ekaterina made her way to her mother in France.\n\nPrincess Olga Valerianovna Paley* (1865 – 1929), morganatic second wife of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich (son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia), who was killed by the Bolsheviks in January 1919, and mother of Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley who was killed by the Bolsheviks in July 1918\n\nand her two daughters:\n\nPrincess Irina Pavlovna Paley (1903 – 1990)\n\nPrincess Natalia Pavlovna Paley (1905 – 1981)\n\nLater in 1919, after her husband’s execution had been confirmed, Olga, accompanied by her two daughters, fled Russia, hoping that her son Vladimir was still alive. With the help of a White Army officer, they walked for three days, crossing the frozen Lake Ladoga, the largest lake entirely in Europe. The Bolsheviks had installed light projectors around the lake which they used to find people attempting to escape. Many times Olga and her daughters had to lie down on the ice and be covered with a white sheet to avoid being seen. Olga, her daughters, and the White Army officer walked across the lake to Finland and continued to the safety of the city of Helsinki. Eventually, Olga and her daughters settled in France.\n\n*********************\n\nThese Romanovs and family members managed to escape from Russia:\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich* (1876 – 1938), son of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (son of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia)\n\nGrand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna* (1876 – 1936), Kirill’s wife and first cousin, born Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh, daughter of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (son of Queen Victoria) and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia (daughter of Alexander II, Emperor of All Russia)\n\nand their two daughters:\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Kirillovna (1907 – 1951)\n\nGrand Duchess Kira Kirillovna (1909 – 1967)\n\nFollowing the abdication of Nicholas II in 1917, Kirill and his family left Russia. They settled first in Finland, before moving on to Munich, Germany, and then Zurich, Switzerland. Eventually, they settled permanently in Saint-Briac, France, in the mid-1920s.\n\n*******************\n\nPrince Gavril Konstantinovich (1887 – 1955), son of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich (a grandson of Nicholas I, Emperor of All Russia), and a brother of Prince Ioann Konstantinovich, Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich, and Prince Igor Konstantinovich who were all killed by the Bolsheviks in July 1918\n\nAntonina Rafailovna Nesterovskaya (1890 – 1950), Gavril’s morganatic wife, a ballerina at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, later Princess Romanovskaya-Strelninskaya\n\nIn July 1918, Gavril was imprisoned in Petrograd (St. Petersburg). His wife Antonina was tireless in her efforts to obtain Gavril’s release. She finally succeeded with the help of writer Maxim Gorky, who lobbied Vladimir Lenin, the first and founding head of government of Soviet Russia, on Gavril’s behalf. At the end of 1918, Gavril was moved to a hospital, and then Gavril and his wife lived for a while at Gorky’s apartment.
