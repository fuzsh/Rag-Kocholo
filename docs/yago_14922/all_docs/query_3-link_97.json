        "text": "So your fantasy is about a common man obtaining a title by marrying into a noble family? To my best knowledge the chances of this happening are slim. What is more likely is that the woman (or at least her children) will lose her title.\n\nAs cases in points in recent history, consider Alfonso DÃ­ez Carabantes (the third husband of the Duchess of Alba and 24 years her junior) or Max Kothbauer (a rich banker who married Maria-Pia Ludovika Ulrika Elisabeth Paschaline Katharina Ignazia Lucia Johanna Josefa, Princess of Liechtenstein who is currently Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Liechtenstein to Austria as well as Mrs. Maria-Pia Kothbauer). Japanese former Princess Nori (now Mrs. Sayako Kuroda) also married a commoner and \"left the Japanese Imperial Family, as required by law\".\n\nI'm sure there are are also some exceptions (esp. in the lower ranks of nobility), yet apparently a fantasy it must remain...\n\nYou may also want to recall Napoleon's biography: he started from relatively humble roots but rose to high enough power to reframe all kinds of rules: he raised several Dukes to Kings and married an Emperor's daughter. Nobody complained too loudly while he remained in power, and some (such as new Kings) preferred not to complain even afterwards. So here was one who able to pull it off quite fantastically...\n\nFirst, I am assuming that you are giving your fantasy world a \"Western European\" flavour. Working from this assumption there are still a myriad details that vary from nation to nation within Western Europe, but in general the two houses are allied, but the offspring only marshall the coat of arms; the husband and wife are each only entitled to their own arms.\n\nThat said however, if the husband and wife are each head of their respective houses (as with Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile), then they have authority to do otherwise than above.\n\nYou can obtain much more information on European heraldic traditions, by nationality and culture, by looking up both heraldry and the respective national Colleges of Arms on the web:\n\nCollege of Arms of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and much of the Commonwealth\n\nThe Court of the Lord Lyon (Scotland)\n\nInternational Armourial Registry\n\nGerman Heraldry\n\nAlso note that the merging of two houses is not as simple as the wedding of respective heirs. There is usually continued friction between the nobles of the two countries, and sometimes the commoners as well. As noted in the link to Ferdinand of Aragon above, it was not until the ascension of Charles I (grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella) that Castile and Aragon truly united.\n\nLikewise, Scotland and England still see themselves as distinct countries within the United Kingdom of Great Britain, with a common monarch, more than 400 years after the ascension to the throne of England by James the VI and I.\n\nNote that someone who is entitled to bear (a coat of) arms may wear any arms desired, once the same have been registered with a College of Arms in order to ensure that:\n\nNo conflict exists with arms already granted;\n\nNo inappropriate marshaling of previously granted arms has been performed; and\n\nNo symbols of rank (sceptres, acorns, etc.) have been used inappropriately.\n\nLord George, 1st Viscount Sackville, was infamous for his alleged cowardice at the 1759 Battle of Minden; and judged at court martial as \"... unfit to serve His Majesty in any military Capacity whatever.\" Then \"in 1769, Lady Elizabeth Germain died without natural heirs, and left her estates ... to him.\" From the following year he was then able to formally take the name Lord George Germain. By that moniker he again became infamous in Lord North's cabinet as Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs from 1775 until 1782.\n\nAt the Battle of Minden he four times ignored or refused to obey orders to advance with his cavalry, and even stopped a subordinate from doing so on his own initiative."
