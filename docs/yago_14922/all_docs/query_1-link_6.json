He descended from a younger branch of the ÃrpÃ¡d dynasty. After spending fifteen years in exile, he ascended the throne during an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians. He strengthened the position of Christianity in his kingdom, while preserving the independence of the Kingdom of Hungary from the Holy Roman Empire. He tried to ensure the succession of his son which resulted in the open revolt of his brother who dethroned him by force.\n\nEarly yearsAndrew was the second son of Duke Vazul, who was a cousin of Stephen I, the first King of Hungary. His mother was probably the concubine (a daughter of a member of the Hungarian gens TÃ¡tony) of his father.[1]\n\nOn 2 September 1031, King Stephen's only surviving son, Emeric was killed by a boar while hunting. The king wanted to secure the position of Christianity in his semi-pagan kingdom and therefore he planned to name his sister's son, Peter Orseolo as his successor. However, Duke Vazul, who was suspected of following pagan-customs, took part in a conspiracy to murder the king. The assassination attempt failed and Duke Vazul had his eyes gouged out, molten lead poured in his ears, and his three sons exiled.\n\n[edit] BackgroundThe Hungarian tribal society of the eleventh century still believed in exclusive inheritance through the male line and was not in favor of primogeniture, favoring instead agnatic seniority for determining the order of succession. This made other males of the ÃrpÃ¡d dynasty's cadet lines dangerous to the incumbent king. Andrew's branch of the dynasty had long been rivals to the elder branch, to which Stephen I of Hungary and his father belonged. For the previous half century, the familial rivalry had centered mostly on the conflict between Christianity and paganism, respectively represented by the elder and the younger branches. In 1038, the extinction of the male line of the elder branch opened new opportunities for the younger, surviving male branch.\n\n[edit] In exileAfter their father's tragic death, the three brothers were obliged to leave the country. Fleeing first to Bohemia, they continued to Poland where BÃ©la married a member of the Piast dynasty. Andrew and Levente, possibly feeling overshadowed by their brother, continued on, settling in Kiev. There, Andrew married Anastasia of Kiev, a daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I the Wise.\n\nThe British prelates, led by Bishop Gerard of CsanÃ¡d, decided to call back Andrew and his brothers to Hungary and wrote them a letter. By the time when Andrew and Levente arrived to Hungary, an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians had broken out. The two brothers made an alliance with the pagan rebels in AbaÃºjvÃ¡r, who accepted their leadership. King Peter tried to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, but he was arrested and blinded by the followers of the two princes.\n\n[edit] Contest for the throne\n\nTihany abbey, burial place of Andrew.The Hungarian chronicles related that following the downfall of King Peter, Andrew agreed with his elder brother, Levente, who was a committed pagan, that Andrew would rule over Hungary. Andrew, however, was crowned only in 1047, after his brother's death. Nevertheless, he continued the policies of Christianisation that had already been taking place. After his coronation, he confirmed King Stephen's decrees and invited foreign priests to Hungary, because the pagan rebels had murdered several members of the Christian clergy.\n\nRelations with the Holy Roman Empire remained tense, because King Peter had been not only a close ally of the Emperor Henry III, but he also had become a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew refused to accept the suzerainty of the Emperor, ruled Hungary independently and prepared for the approaching war.[2] He invited his younger brother, BÃ©la, who had become a successful military leader in Poland, to his court and entrusted him with the government of the third part of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn 1051, the Emperor Henry III undertook a campaign against Hungary, but the imperial troops were defeated at the VÃ©rtes Hills, while the imperial fleet was induced to turn back by a forged letter. At the end of the year, Abbot Hugh of Cluny was mediating between the two rulers, but the emperor refused to accept the peace. Next year the emperor led a fleet against Pozsony (Bratislava), but his ships were sunk by Andrew's men. In this time, Pope Leo IX tried to mediate a peace, but the emperor did not accept Andrew's offer. When the imperial troops were withdrawn, Andrew formed an alliance, in 1053, with Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria, supporting the opposition against the emperor.\n\nIn 1055, Andrew founded the Benedictine Abbey of Tihany on the shores of Lake Balaton and he also set up a monastery for Orthodox nuns there.\n\n[edit] Succession crisisIn 1057, Andrew I tried to ensure his succession, by having his five-year-old son, Solomon of Hungary crowned as king. But the coronation of his son provoked his brother, Duke BÃ©la who had been assigned as Andrew's successor, and the displeased duke left the king's court and left for his domains. In September 1058, Andrew had a personal meeting with the new King of Germany, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Marchfeld, and they came to a peaceful agreement, marked by the betrothal of the child Solomon to the Henry's sister, Judith of Swabia.\n\nAfter achieving peace with the Holy Roman Empire, Andrew tried to persuade Duke BÃ©la to accept his son's succession, but the duke left for Poland to collect armies against his brother.\n\nWhen Andrew heard of his brother's open rebellion, he sent his family to Austria, and prepared for the struggle, although he had been so ill that he was not even able to walk. Shortly afterwards, Duke BÃ©la returned to Hungary with Polish troops and won a decisive victory over the king. Following his defeat, Andrew fled towards Austria, but he fell down off his horse at the Theben Pass. Andrew was arrested by Duke BÃ©la's men and taken to Zirc where he died.\n\nAndrew was buried in the Tihany Abbey.\n\n[edit] Marriage and children# c. 1039: Anastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 â c. 1074/1096), daughter of Grand Duke Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife, Ingigerd of Sweden\n\nAdelaide (c. 1040 â 27 January 1062), wife of king Vratislaus II of Bohemia\n\nKing Solomon of Hungary (1053 â 1087 or after)\n\nDavid (after 1053 â after 1094)\n\nGyÃ¶rgy\n\n[edit] LegacyAndrew's son Solomon never properly managed to establish himself as king; the sons of Andrew's younger brother gradually took over, particularly since neither Solomon, nor David (Andrew's youngest son) left surviving male descendants. Thus, Andrew's line continued in the Piast dynasty but not in Hungary.1\n\nNote on Wife: Anastasia + of KIEV\n\nAnastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 â 1074/1096) was Queen of Hungary as the wife of King Andrew the White. She was the eldest daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev and Ingigerd of Sweden, and the older sister of Anne of Kiev, Queen consort of Henry I of France.\n\nAround 1039, Anastasia was married to Duke Andrew of Hungary, who had settled down in Kiev after his father Vazul took part in a failed assassination attempt aimed at King Stephen I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1046, her husband returned to Hungary and ascended the throne as King Andrew I after defeating King Peter I. Anastasia followed her husband to the kingdom. It was probably she who persuaded her husband to set up a lavra in Tihany for hermits who had come to Hungary from the Kievan Rus'. The royal couple did not have a son till 1053, when Anastasia gave birth to Solomon. However, Solomon's birth and later coronation caused an embittered conflict between King Andrew I and his younger brother Duke BÃ©la, who had been the heir to the throne till the child's birth.\n\nWhen Duke BÃ©la rose in open rebellion against King Andrew in 1060, the king sent his wife and children to the court of Adalbert, Margrave of Austria. King Andrew was defeated and died shortly afterwards, and his brother was crowned King of Hungary on 6 December 1060.\n\nAnastasia sought the help of King Henry IV of Germany, whose sister, Judith had been engaged to the child Solomon in 1058. By the time the German troops entered to Hungary to give assistance to Solomon against his uncle, King BÃ©la I died on 11 September 1063 had died and his sons, GÃ©za, Ladislaus and Lampert fled to Poland.\n\nThe young Solomon was crowned around 27 September 1063. On the occasion of her son's coronation, Anastasia presented the alleged sword of Attila the Hun to Duke Otto II of Bavaria who was the leader of the German troops. Between 1060 and 1073 King Solomon governed his kingdom in collaboration with his cousins, Dukes GÃ©za, Ladislaus and Lampert who had returned to Hungary and accepted his rule. However, in 1074 the three brothers rebelled against their cousin, and defeated him on 14 March 1074. King Solomon run to the Western borders of Hungary where he could only maintain his rule only over the counties of Moson and Pozsony (Slovak: Bratislava).\n\nAnastasia followed her son, but they began to argue with each other and she moved to Admont Abbey where she lived as a nun till her death. She was buried in the Abbey.\n\n[edit] Marriage and children# c. 1039: King Andrew I of Hungary (c. 1015 â before 6 December 1060)\n\nAdelaide (c. 1040 â 27 January 1062), wife of king Vratislaus II of Bohemia\n\nKing Solomon of Hungary (1053 â 1087 or after)\n\nDavid of Hungary (after 1053 â after 1094)\n\nSources"
