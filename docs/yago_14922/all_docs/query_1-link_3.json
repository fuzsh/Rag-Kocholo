She was the eldest daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev and Ingigerd of Sweden, and the older sister of Anne of Kiev, Queen consort of Henry I of France.\n\nAround 1039, Anastasia was married to Duke Andrew of Hungary, who had settled down in Kiev after his father Vazul took part in a failed assassination attempt aimed at King Stephen I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1046, her husband returned to Hungary and ascended the throne as King Andrew I after defeating King Peter I. Anastasia followed her husband to the kingdom. It was probably she who persuaded her husband to set up a lavra in Tihany for hermits who had come to Hungary from the Kievan Rus'. The royal couple did not have a son till 1053, when Anastasia gave birth to Solomon. However, Solomon's birth and later coronation caused an embittered conflict between King Andrew I and his younger brother Duke Béla, who had been the heir to the throne till the child's birth.\n\nWhen Duke Béla rose in open rebellion against King Andrew in 1060, the king sent his wife and children to the court of Adalbert, Margrave of Austria. King Andrew was defeated and died shortly afterwards, and his brother was crowned King of Hungary on 6 December 1060.\n\nAnastasia sought the help of King Henry IV of Germany, whose sister, Judith had been engaged to the child Solomon in 1058. By the time the German troops entered to Hungary to give assistance to Solomon against his uncle, King Béla I died on 11 September 1063 had died and his sons, Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert fled to Poland.\n\nThe young Solomon was crowned around 27 September 1063. On the occasion of her son's coronation, Anastasia presented the alleged sword of Attila the Hun to Duke Otto II of Bavaria who was the leader of the German troops. Between 1060 and 1073 King Solomon governed his kingdom in collaboration with his cousins, Dukes Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert who had returned to Hungary and accepted his rule. However, in 1074 the three brothers rebelled against their cousin, and defeated him on 14 March 1074.

She was buried in the Abbey.\n\nAdelaide of Hungary (c. 1040 – 27 January 1062) was the only daughter of Andrew I of Hungary of the Arpad dynasty. It is disputed whether her mother was Anastasia Yaroslavna, daughter of Yaroslav the Great, Prince of Kiev, or another unknown first wife of Andrew I.\n\nShe was the second wife of Vratislav II of Bohemia, whom she married in 1057. She was a good dynastic match for Vratislav, as he profited from the alliance with her father. They had four children, including Bretislaus II of Bohemia and Judith Premyslid. Vratislav became duke in 1061, after death of his brother, but Adelaide was not duchess for a long time.\n\nShe preceded her husband in death; he remarried shortly afterward to Świętosława of Poland, and was finally crowned as the first King of Bohemia in 1085.\n\nAnastasia of Kiev\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAnastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – 1074/1096) was Queen of Hungary as the wife of King Andrew the White.

Anastasia followed her husband to the kingdom.\n\nIt was probably she who persuaded her husband to set up a lavra in Tihany for hermits who had come to Hungary from the Kievan Rus'. (Hungarian Wikipedia says that she lived on the Tihany peninsula on Lake Balaton. She also founded the Bihari Tormova monastery for Russian nuns.)\n\nThe royal couple did not have a son till 1053, when Anastasia gave birth to Solomon. However, Solomon's birth and later coronation caused an embittered conflict between King Andrew I and his younger brother Duke Béla, who had been the heir to the throne til the child's birth.\n\nWhen Duke Béla rose in open rebellion against King Andrew in 1060, the king sent his wife and children to the court of Adalbert, Margrave of Austria.

She was buried in the Abbey.\n\n(Hungarian Wikipedia says that the Thuroczy Chronicle recorded where Anastasia admonished her son: \"My dear boy! Several others did not listen to me either, nor supported my advice. On the contrary, they were silent. What happened to you? Rally yourself and your men. Do not say that you have had enough of the Hungarian crown, that in order to live in peace you must give up part of your kingdom. We can no longer watch, Prince, while you cannot keep your power.\" Solomon almost hit his mother after she said these words, and only Judith, his wife, prevented him.
