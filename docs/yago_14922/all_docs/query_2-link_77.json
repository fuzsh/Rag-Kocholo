        "text": "We are delighted to announce the launch of ANA Milan in March 2024!\n\nLed by Barbara Barbieri, our Italian office is perfectly situated at the heart of Italian publishing: Milan is home to stylish, independent houses and the largest publishing groups alike and a train ride away from the publishing strongholds of Rome, Florence and Turin. Europe’s fourth largest book market, Italy has sophisticated publishers that appreciate international blockbusters and homegrown authors.\n\nAfter more than a decade representing the agency’s bestselling and award-winning Italian fiction authors from London, Barbara Barbieri has set up office in her hometown of Milan. Prior to joining Nurnberg she studied Contemporary Italian Literature and worked at Book Aid International, Rizzoli and Atlantyca.\n\nANA Milan works alongside London’s renowned translation team, which handles the German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Scandinavian markets; and the agency’s client accounting and contracts team.\n\n“ANA Milan will be the first office opened by an international literary agency in Italy. For the agency, and our authors, it was important to strengthen the our connection to the Continent after Brexit. I am thrilled to work even closer to the Italian market finding the perfect homes for the wonderful authors and clients we represent.”\n\n—Barbara Barbieri, Director, ANA Milan.\n\n“ANA Milan is part of our deep commitment to Europe, to international rights selling and non-Anglophone writing and cultures. Barbara’s reputation is built on her tenacious dealmaking and her passion for rights.”\n\n— Doug Wallace, Managing Director, ANAI Ltd\n\nAndrew Nurnberg Associates Milan\n\nc/o Tenoha, via Vigevano 18, 20144 Milan - Italy\n\nANA Bangkok was established in 2023 to best serve the literary translation markets of Thailand, Indonesia and Mongolia. Agency director, Weerawat “Big” Techakijjathorn, has more than a decade’s experience in acquiring and publishing international literature in Thailand. He started out as an editor of foreign literature before becoming the director of foreign literary rights for one of Thailand’s best-known publishers. From there his enthusiasm for translated literature led him to study the Indonesian market.\n\nThailand and Indonesia are among the most important translation markets in Southeast Asia. With reading tastes rapidly developing —and a more sophisticated range of fiction and non-fiction being published in greater quantity— we see Thailand and Indonesia outperforming the neighbouring markets in years to come. We’re here to help our clients explore the diversity and richness of these key markets now. We are supporting international authors to develop meaningful relationships with publishers and build local readerships. This is not to forget Mongolia, which is an interesting, emerging market with passionate publishers and plenty of opportunities to explore.\n\nOur mission is simple: set a new standard for co-agenting in the region. We’re building a team of keen negotiators with unparalleled knowledge, supported by our ANAI colleagues across Asia and around the world.\n\nNo. 1, Empire Tower,\n\n47th Floor, Unit 4703,\n\nSathon Tai Road, Yan Nawa Sub-district,\n\nSathon District, Bangkok 10120\n\nFounded in Vietnam in 2023, the agency intends to make the most of Southeast Asia’s most commercial book market from our office in Hanoi, the heart of Vietnam. Our director, Van Thanh Hoang, studied Physics at college before her curiosity for other realms of human experience and knowledge kindled her love in books.\n\nVan started out in Rights, spending a decade at one of the country’s most influential publishing houses, handling (mainly) translation rights, large scale international co-operation and publishing management. From this, she garnered unique insights into Vietnam’s publishing landscape, its development and how local publishers negotiate and acquire international titles.\n\nWith a rapidly thriving economy, Vietnam’s large, youthful population is hungry to learn and has disposable income to read for pleasure. Young readers’ appetite for a diverse range of themes combined with a competitive market means that eye-catching book design and vibrant, digital marketing and sales is becoming the norm: enticing readers and re-invigorating reading culture among younger generations.\n\nANA Hanoi will get the right books in front of Vietnam’s most talented editors so they can fight for them. We are our clients’ voice in Vietnam: here to connect, negotiate and grow.\n\nNo 7, D2, TT4 Bac Linh Dam,\n\nDai Kim Ward, Hoang Mai District,\n\nHanoi, Vietnam\n\nDominika Bojanowska serves as Managing director of ANA Kyiv. Bojanowska’s well-established agenting team will provide unparalleled representation for translation clients across Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Georgia.

Anna has seven years’ experience placing translation rights for clients in Poland as well as across Eastern Europe.\n\n“We are delighted to welcome Dominika to ANA and look forward to working with her Ania and Beata as they build ANA Kyiv. The opening of ANA Kyiv is part of a wider investment across ANAI offices, which began with the opening of ANA Bangkok and ANA Hanoi in My 2023. We’ll be announcing further developments in early 2024.”\n\n—Doug Wallace, MD, ANA International\n\n“It’s high time for Kyiv to move into the spotlight on the global rights map, as a vibrant new hub for Central and Eastern European rights. What we are announcing today is only the first step towards this goal, but I am honoured and delighted to be a part of this new ANA venture. We are beyond excited to see what the future holds for ANA Kyiv.”\n\n—Dominika Bojanowska, MD, ANA Kyiv\n\nAndrew Nurnberg Associates Kyiv Sp. z o.o.\n\nMarszałkowska 55/73 lok. 55\n\n00-676 Warszawa\n\nOur Polish agenting team is led by Marcin Biegaj, who began his agenting career at Graal and after several years there decided to move on to set up Andrew Nurnberg Associates Warsaw in 2015.
