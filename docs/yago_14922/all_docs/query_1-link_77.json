        "text": "Yaroslav the Wise (born 980—died February 2, 1054) was the grand prince of Kyivan Rus (Kievan Rus) from 1019 to 1054.\n\nA son of the grand prince Vladimir, he was vice-regent of Novgorod at the time of his father’s death in 1015. Then his eldest surviving brother, Svyatopolk the Accursed, killed three of his other brothers and seized power in Kyiv (Kiev). Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of Varangian (Viking) mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became the grand prince of Kyiv in 1019.\n\nYaroslav began consolidating the Kyivan state through both cultural and administrative improvements and through military campaigns. He promoted the spread of Christianity in the Kyivan state, gathered a large collection of books, and employed many scribes to translate Greek religious texts into the Slavic language. He founded churches and monasteries and issued statutes regulating the legal position of the Christian Church and the rights of the clergy. With the help of Byzantine architects and craftsmen, Yaroslav fortified and beautified Kyiv along Byzantine lines. He built the majestic Cathedral of St. Sophia and the famous Golden Gate of the Kyivan fortress. Under Yaroslav the codification of legal customs and princely enactments was begun, and this work served as the basis for a law code called the Russkaya Pravda (“Russian Justice”).\n\nYaroslav pursued an active foreign policy, and his forces won several notable military victories. He regained Galicia from the Poles, decisively defeated the nomadic Pechenegs on the Kyivan state’s southern frontier, and expanded Kyivan possessions in the Baltic region, suppressing the Lithuanians, Estonians, and Finnish tribes. His military campaign against Constantinople in 1043 was a failure, however.\n\nTrade with the East and West played an important role in Kyivan Rus in the 11th century, and Yaroslav maintained diplomatic relations with the European states. His daughters Elizabeth, Anna, and Anastasia were married respectively to Harald III of Norway, Henry I of France, and Andrew I of Hungary.\n\nIn his testament, Yaroslav sought to prevent a power struggle among his five sons by dividing his empire among them and enjoining the younger four sons to obey the eldest, Izyaslav, who was to succeed his father as grand prince of Kyiv. This advice had no lasting effect, and civil war ensued after Yaroslav’s death."
