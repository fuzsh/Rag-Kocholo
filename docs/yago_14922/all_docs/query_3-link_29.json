        "text": "Well, assuming Andrew has still been murdered, Louis I of Hungary should still be out for revenge.

He arrived in Hungary in early 1348. He died a few months later. The POD is around that time.\n\nIn any case, it's an open question just who Charles Martel is succeeding, in what domains, and in what order (all of these are important).

Charles Martel would ascend to the throne of Naples in the same way Charles of Durazzo did IOTL. Maybe Durazzo could accompany him to the campaign and remain there as Martel's viceroy once he returns to take the Crown of Hungary (and Poland).\n\nSame deal with Hungary. Charles of Durazzo had been taken under Louis I's wing and if he was willing to usurp Louis's daughter OTL, there's nothing stopping him from usurping Louis's nephew ITTL.\n\nI'm not so sure about that. Many people were upset by woman rule, especially because it was the Mother Queen who actually ruled instead of Mary. Such kind of dissatisfaction wouldn't exist ITTL. Furthermore, ITTL Charles of Durazzo wouldn't be the senior male of the Anjous, so he wouldn't have any legitimacy to base his claim on.\n\nNow, it's unlikely Charles of Durazzo will be able to take both Naples and Hungary at the same time, but I can easily see him gunning for at least one, depending on who dies (or is dispossessed) and when.\n\nPlease, just indulge me and consider Charles of Durazzo loyal to Charles Martel.\n\nThis actually is an interesting POD that I don't think I've seen explored here. However, instead of focusing solely on a theoredical Naples-Hungary-Poland union (which is highly improbable, BTW), I think we'd need to start a the beginning;\n\n1. What is the exact POD? Obviously its Charles Martel surviving, but how? I think the easiest POD would be for Joanna I to take her son with her when she fled to Provence in 1348, rather than leave him behind. Either that, or for some reason Lajos I decides to leave the toddler in Naples (as it was his transfer to cold Hungary that caused his death). As I can't see a reason for Lajos to decide to leave a valuable hostage in Naples, the former is easier.\n\n2. We need to address the vast effects a surviving Charles Martel will have on his mother's reign. From his death in 1348 until Joanna's murder in 1382, her reign was in a near constant succession crisis that more or less caused the constant crises she experienced, especially after the death of her last daughter Françoise in 1352. With a stable succession and a guaranteed male heir, the various shenanigans that dominated the Neapolitan court after 1352 likely don't happen , or are much weaker. These included the revolts of Louis of Durazzo, the problems over the marriages of Joanna's nieces and heiress presumptives, and the eventual issues of Charles of Gravina-Durazzo. Hell, a surviving Charles Martel could easily butterfly Joanna's third and fourth marriages to Jaume IV of Majorca and Otto von Braunschweig-Grubenhagen (Joanna only married the unstable Jaume IV in the hope of producing a new heir, though the fourth marriage was successful enough and might still happen).\n\n3. My next question is Charles's marriage. In OTL he was betrothed to his cousin Jeanne of Durazzo, his first cousin and daughter of Joanna's sister Maria. However, in OTL Jeanne proved to be barren (her marriages to Louis of Navarre and Robert IV d'Eu were both childless), which would be a major problem. So the butterflies would need to make her fertile somehow, find Joanna an excuse to break the engagement or kill her young and replace her with her sister Agnes (except Agnes too was childless OTL). The only one of the Durazzo sisters to produce children was Marguerite, the youngest and the OTL wife of Charles of Durazzo. For the sake of the succession, the bet is a fertile Jeanne or some kind of fallout over between the royal sisters causing a breakoff of the engagement in favor of a different bride. I think a good replacement bride would be a daughter of Jean II of France; either a surviving Agnes or Marguerite de Valois or Isabelle, OTL Comtesse de Vertus.\n\n4. With a more stable Naples, I wonder what effects this would have on the Neapolitan ambitions in Sicily and in Albania. OTL Joanna I and her second husband Louis conquered much of Sicily during the disastrous reign of Louis I 'the Child, before a lack of supplies and continued strife between the Neapolitan royal couple led to their defeat. Considering the tensions continued under his brother Frederick III/IV 'the Simple' (regnal number is still disputed), and it wasn't until 1372 that Joanna acknowledged the loss of Sicily (in the Treaty of Villeneuve), I could see Charles taking up his mother's cause and leading a renewed campaign in the mid 1360s. This could end the conquest of the Kingdom, or perhaps a later forced union between one of his sons and Frederick's only child Maria. Such a marriage would peacefully reunite the two realms.\n\nAs for Albania, his Durazzo cousins had a strong claim to that kingdom-realm (Durazzo was a duchy centered on the modern Albanian city of Durrës), and made several attempts to make good on their claims. The last, and semi-successful, was the campaign of his cousin Jeanne and her husband Louis in the 1370s, only for Louis to die shortly after and the city itself to fall in 1385. So again, the possibility is there for the Neapolitans to hold Durazzo and expand the Duchy into Albania proper. Though that might go better with a fertile Jeanne marrying Charles.\n\n5. Hungary-Poland. I know that @Fehérvári is most interested in a Naples-Hungary-Poland union, but that's basically ASB. The ability to govern such a massive realm in the middle ages was nonexistent. You could get a Naples-Hungary or a Hungary-Poland, but not all three. For the succession to Lajo's realms, the easiest solution would be for Charles Martel to have several sons, and for the second or third to marry a surviving Catherine of Hungary (the oldest daughter of Lajos who died young). Together the two inherit Hungary-Poland. Or have Catherine die OTL, and Charles's younger son marry Mary of Hungary, with her sister inheriting Poland like OTL. I think this is the much more likely scenario.\n\nWould this keep the Luxemburgs docile? Also, could Sigismund and Mary actually pull off succeeding Charles Martel in all of his realms? Could the emerging threat of the Ottomans make the Neapolitans willing to remain part of such polity?\n\nNaples will be the problem. There was a papal decree passed under the Hohenstaufens already that said that Naples and the \"Italian\" Crown couldn't be held by the same person. AFAIK the only persons who successfully pulled it off were Karl V and Karl VI. The former Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, all the way down to Paul IV, were anti-Habsburg encirclement as much as what France was, and encouraged Louis XII and François I in their ambitions to take the crown of Naples. With the latter, the papacy no longer had the room to object (or rather, nobody cared).\n\nNow, Sigmund has the advantage that there are two popes and a church schism, but the problem comes in that (IIRC) Hungary, Poland and Naples all acknowledged the pope in Rome, while the pope in Avignon acknowledged the duc d'Anjou. The pope in Rome might accept it to avoid Hungary-Poland-Naples going over to Avignon, but it might not be so simple. Even if Rome does, Avignon might not and Anjou would be encouraged to do as he did/tried OTL. And there'll be Italian Wars a century earlier than OTL (which could be interesting in and of itself).\n\nFact is that the logistics are going to encourage rebellions in either Hungary (in favour of Hedwig and her Austrian husband- don't see Sigmund going for a Jogaila match for her TBH - or maybe Elisabeth of Bosnia pulls off the match with Louis d'Orléans), Bohemia/Germany (first in favour of Wenzel/Vaclav IV, then led by Jobst of Moravia/Rupert of the Palatinate/Ludwig of Bavaria-Ingolstadt - the \"kingmaker\" who only turned on Vaclav IV when the latter refused to enfeoff him as \"duke of Milan\", but who played a big role in the electioin of Rupert - only because the rest of the Wittelsbachs were pretty much all opposed to Ludwig - and who kept in good with both popes). In the Luxemburg possessions in the Low Countries, Philip of Burgundy then John the Fearless will be agitating. So, if Sigmund succeeds Carlo Martello in all his realms, he's going to turn into an uber-Karl V who's constantly running from fire to fire and not actually ruling.\n\nFurthermore, the problem comes in if Mary has her accident and stillborn son as OTL (I know, it's a stretch, but work with me). What happens to Carlo Martello's lands? Sigmund is not the heir, but he ain't gonna just give it up - even if it's hard to hold - just because whoeer is the heir? asks nicely. So there'll be war.\n\nAs I say, he'll be the uber-Karl V where the sheer size of his empire makes alliances (France and the Ottomans of OTL) that would be called ASB, possible.\n\nFrom the 2009 bio of Giovanna I, The Lady Queen:\n\nThere was therefore no need, in her [Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary's] mind, to adhere to the second stage of the original treaty, which stipulated that her eldest son, Louis, wed Joanna’s younger sister, Maria. To throw away Louis’ marriage prospects on the younger granddaughter of the king of faraway Naples, when he could be making a much more attractive regional alliance, represented a wasted opportunity and a violation of Hungarian interests. Even before her husband’s death, the queen mother had advocated that Louis be engaged instead to the daughter of the heir to the Bohemian throne. At Elizabeth’s insistence then, in the fall of 1342, Louis married Margaret, the seven- year- old princess of Bohemia.\n\nRobert the Wise took this rejection of his granddaughter Maria as a direct slap at Angevin pride. On January 16, 1343, visibly near the end of his days and too weak to arise from his bed, but nonetheless “sound of mind and able to speak,” the king dictated his last will and testament. In the presence of witnesses he reconfirmed Joanna as his successor and sole heir to the throne of Naples, as well as to the rest of his far- flung empire (“Rex . . . instituit sibi haeredem universalem Joannam, ducissam Calabriae, meptem ejus primogenitam”), which the king of Naples listed as the countship of Provence, the sovereignty of Sicily, and the inherited title to Jerusalem, as well as overlordships in Piedmont and Forcalquier. If Joanna died childless, this im mense inheritance went directly to Maria, bypassing Andrew altogether. There was no mention of Andrew’s being crowned king, not even in an honorary fashion as consort. By this will, then, Andrew was very publicly excluded from rule or indeed from playing any role\n\nwhat ever in his wife’s government.\n\nTo further punish the Hungarians, Robert the Wise also improved Maria’s standing at court. Should the long- contracted marriage between Joanna’s younger sister and Louis of Hungary fail to take place (an allusion to the union with Margaret of Bohemia), Maria was instead specifically instructed to wed the heir to the French throne, or, if he were not available, a younger brother of the French royal family. In recognition that the accomplishment of so brilliant an alliance as a match with the crown of France was likely to require further inducement, Robert made provision for Maria’s estate to be increased by a handsome bequest of lands, castles, men and vassals to the value of ten thousand florins."
