        "text": "Charlie McCoy is a Nashville studio legend. Known primarily for his harmonica playing, he is also skilled on the guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, vibes, and any number of brass and wind instruments, and has worked with countless legends ­– Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Simon and Garfunkel, Roy Orbison, Dolly Parton, and others – throughout his six decades in Music City.\n\nBorn in small-town West Virginia, Charlie spent his formative years in Miami, Florida. He began playing the harmonica at age eight and by 16 had added mastery of the guitar, bass, and trumpet. He formed a rock & roll band – Charlie McCoy and the Agendas – and was soon gigging around the Miami area. At the urging of fellow Floridian Mel Tillis, he came to Nashville in 1959, right after graduation. Tillis’s office set up auditions for McCoy with Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley. Neither signed him to a label. “It was like, ‘Well, son, I think you’re pretty good,’” Charlie recalls, “‘but we’re just not doing that kind of music here.’”\n\nBut then Owen said to me, “I’m having a session this afternoon, would you like to come and watch?” So I went back to his studio and he said, “If you’ll sit about halfway up this stairway, you’ll get a real idea of what we’re doing here.” Pretty soon, musicians start coming in. I’m thinking, “Who are these old guys?” And then the artist came in, a thirteen-year old kid named Brenda Lee. And the other thing that struck me was there’s no music. Where the music? There’s not even music stands. But when I heard the first playback, my whole life changed because, at that moment, that’s the greatest thing I ever heard. And I said, “I don’t want to be a singer. I want to do this. This is so cool.” I mean I was spellbound. So, that was my goal then. I wanted to be a studio musician.\n\nAfter less than a year back in Miami, during which McCoy couldn’t get that experience out of his mind, he returned to Nashville. His first job there was as a drummer – an instrument McCoy taught himself after landing that first gig. In 1961, he was hired by Fred Foster to play harmonica on Roy Orbison’s “Candy Man.” When the song became a million-seller, McCoy’s reputation on the harp was made. He was soon playing the harmonica in sessions for Perry Como, Ringo Starr, Joan Baez, Kris Kristofferson, and many others. At the peak of his career, he played 400 sessions per year, including New York and Nashville sessions for Bob Dylan: guitar on classics “Desolation Row” (Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) and “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” (Blonde on Blonde, 1966) and bass guitar on all tracks of John Wesley Harding (1967).\n\nAlthough McCoy’s own music did not fare well in the beginning, Foster believed in him and, in 1972, released “Today I Started Loving You Again” as a single. It went to No. 16 on the country charts and sold 750,000 copies. McCoy’s subsequent albums The Real McCoy and Good Time Charlie won a GRAMMY and reached No. 1 on the Billboard country charts, respectively. For nearly 20 years, he served as the musical director for the hit television series, Hee Haw.\n\nCharlie McCoy was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009. His autobiography, Fifty Cents and a Boxtop, was published by West Virginia University Press in 2017.\n\nBorn: March 28, 1941, Oak Hill, West Virginia"
