This legendary sound originally surfaced in the mid-1950s a niche of the classic Country Music style of music. It consisted of replacing the rough honky-tonk music with “smooth strings and choruses”, “sophisticated background vocals” and “smooth tempos”. It was created in an attempt to revive country sales, which had been ruined by the rise of rock ‘n’ roll.⁣⁣\n⁣⁣\nAs a guitarist, he created his signature “fingerpicking” sound, which was a combination of thumb pick and fingers. It’s interesting to view the way in, which Atkins plays scales. According to GuitarWorld.com, he approaches it with the fretting hand near the fourth position, while ascending/descending the A Mixolydian (A B C# D E F# G), grabbing each successive scale tone on a neighboring string and mixing in all available open notes.⁣ While influence can be heard almost everywhere on an entire generation of guitarists, perhaps the most famous example would be The Beatles “All My Loving”. George Harrison himself has confirmed this saying that he was heavily influenced by Chet Atkins while playing the lead guitar parts for the song. ⁣\n⁣⁣\nWhat do you think of Chet Atkins as a guitarist? Leave a comment, I’d love to hear your thoughts!⁣⁣\n⁣⁣\n#Music #RockNRoll #ChetAtkins #CountryRock\".",
