        "text": "Ray Stevens\n\nAmerican singer and songwriter\n\nRay Stevens (born January 24, 1939, Clarkdale, Georgia, U.S.) is an American country and pop singer-songwriter and comedian known for his humorous topical country tunes often featuring unusual sound effects. His comedic nature was notably captured in his novelty songs “Gitarzan” (1969), a humorous spin on the adventures of the fictional jungle hero Tarzan, and “The Streak” (1974), which capitalized on the fad of running naked in public and reached number one on music charts in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. Stevens also gained fame with his more sincere pop sing-along–style ballad “Everything Is Beautiful” (1970), which was noted for its emphasis on diversity and for which Stevens won a Grammy Award in 1971 for best contemporary performance by a male vocalist.\n\nEarly life\n\nStevens learned to play the piano at an early age and in his youth listened to a wide range of music. When he was 15, he formed a band known as the Barons, serving as both singer and pianist. The group played at local venues around Albany, Georgia. Two years later he moved to Atlanta, where he recorded a demo of the single, “Silver Bracelet”; in 1957 he traveled to Nashville to record the track at the RCA “B” studio. While there, Stevens met American country-and-western guitarist and record company executive Chet Atkins, and the two became long-lasting friends. The following year Stevens recorded additional tracks for Capitol Records. He also attended Georgia State University, where he initially studied classical piano and music theory before deciding to become a vocalist.\n\nNumber 1 hits\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter limited success singing love songs, Stevens turned to writing and performing comedy tunes. In 1961 his novelty song “Jeremiah Peabody’s Poly Unsaturated Quick Dissolving Fast Acting Pleasant Tasting Green and Purple Pills” peaked at number 35 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. This success was followed by the release of “Ahab the Arab” (1962), a comedic hit that reached number 5 on the Hot 100. Both singles appeared on Stevens’ debut album, 1,837 Seconds of Humor (1962).\n\nIn the 1960s, Stevens gained experience as a music producer and wrote songs for country singers such as Dolly Parton and Skeeter Davis, while also continuing to write his own music. His next big breakthrough was “Gitarzan” (1969), released on an album of the same name; the song climbed to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. At times during the 1970s, Stevens turned his attention to other types of music. In 1970, while hosting for NBC’s Andy Williams Show, he wrote his first number 1 hit pop song “Everything Is Beautiful,” a sentimental work that reflected his expansion into different musical styles. He subsequently recorded the country music album Turn Your Radio On (1972) and in 1974 released “The Streak”—his second song to reach number 1 on the pop music charts. He later made an acclaimed bluegrass rendition of “Misty” (1975), a work originally written in 1954 by American jazz pianist Erroll Garner. Stevens won the 1976 Grammy Award for best arrangement accompanying vocalist for “Misty.”\n\nLater career\n\nStevens continued his career as a timely parodist in the 1980s, notably with “Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show?” (1987), written by Atkins and vocalist Margaret Archer and released during the era of scandals surrounding television evangelists. The popularity of cable television’s Nashville Network and syndicated country-music shows provided the opportunity for Stevens to create humorous visual productions to complement his tunes. He continued to record through the 1990s and into the 2020s, releasing multiple albums, among them Osama-Yo’ Mama: The Album (2002), in response to the September 11 attacks; Ray Stevens Sings Sinatra…Say What?? (2008); We the People (2010); and Ain’t Nothin’ Funny Anymore (2021).\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
