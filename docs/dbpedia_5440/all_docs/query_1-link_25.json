        "meta_description": "At the end of the third installment of the Planet of the Apes saga, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, the offspring of the two time-traveling apes, Cornelius and Zira, is safely hidden from hostile authorities at a zoo run by Armando, the character played by Ricardo Montalban.   The fourth movie in the series, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, begins two decades later. Cornelius and Ziraâ€™s offspring, named Caesar (Roddy McDowall), is visiting the city with Armando to promote their traveling circus. What they find is a military society run by Gestapo-like police, where apes have become man's slaves, forced to do menial labor.  Armando and Caesar witness the brutal abuse of one of the servant apes, and Caesar yells out \"Lousy human bastards!\", blowing his disguise as a mere circus chimp.   To avoid the capture of Caesar, Armando has the chimp hide by joining the rest of the apes, while he reports to the police that his circus chimp has run away.  Once the coast is clear, the two plan to meet again and escape the city.   Armando's chimp is then captured along with other apes, though not discovered to be the ape that the police are hunting.  Caesar is sent to the Ape Management center to be \"reconditioned.\" There, Caesar discovers with horror that apes are beaten and shocked into docility.  At the same time, the evil, strong-armed Governor Breck (Don Murray) suspects that the circus ape might actually be the legendary offspring of Cornelius and Zira, and has Armando interrogated by the sadistic State Security Chief Inspector Kulp.  After horrible torture, Armando admits that the Governor is correct.   An all-out search ensues because the Governor fears that Caesar will lead a rebellion that destroys mankind.  Caesar, still undetected in the rehabilitation center, impresses his guards with his intelligence.  He is allowed to mate with another chimp, Lisa, and the governor himself unknowingly buys Caesar at an auction.  He then allows the chimp to select his own name from an encyclopedia by randomly pointing to a page.  The chimp selects Caesar, provoking laughter from the Governor.   After learning that Armando has died, Caesar is enraged and plants the seeds of rebellion.  He enlists the help of the Governor's assistant, MacDonald, saying that to be free, the apes need power.  MacDonald, often at odds with the Governor over the mistreatment of the apes, helps Caesar escape, and Caesar rallies the apes together to start a massive revolution and win back their freedom.  When the Governor is about to be killed, Caesar calls for compassion, and demonstrates that he is a warrior for peace.   Paul Dehn wrote the script for CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES after also writing Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Escape From the Planet of the Apes.  Director J. Lee Thompson (also the director of Cape Fear and Guns of Navarone) adheres faithfully to Dehn's script, unblinkingly depicting the brutality of the humans toward the apes.   The film is a clear metaphor for race relations between humans, a call to action that pleads with society to see the injustices so often ignored in society.",
