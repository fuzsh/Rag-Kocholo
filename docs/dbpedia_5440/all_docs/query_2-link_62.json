        "text": "Shout Factory will be offering up a couple of Charles Bronson pictures (sold separately) in January 2024.\n\nSt. Ives (1976)\n\nDirected by J. Lee Thompson\n\nStarring Charles Bronson, John Houseman, Jacqueline Bisset, Maximilian Schell\n\nWith a terrific cast, gorgeous cinematography by Lucien Ballard and a cool score from Lalo Schifrin, St. Ives (1976) seems like a classier kind of Bronson movie. He’s a former cop and crime reporter who gets mixed up with trying to retrieve some stolen ledgers. It was the first of nine pictures Bronson made with J. Lee Thompson.\n\nTelefon (1977)\n\nDirected by Don Siegel\n\nStarring Charles Bronson, Lee Remick, Donald Pleasence, Patrick Magee, Sheree North\n\nTelefon (1977) gives us the dreaming pairing of Bronson and director Don Siegel. And while it’s not as good as we might’ve hoped, it’s a Siegel film. And that’s good enough for me.\n\nBronson is a Major in the KGB sent to the States to Donald Pleasence, a rogue Soviet agent who’s activating sleeper agents. Another good score from Lalo Schifrin.\n\nBoth are these pictures are getting new transfers from original interpositives. I’ve looking forward to seeing Telefon in hi-def.\n\nDirected by J. Lee Thompson\n\nStarring Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Stanley Baker, Anthony Quayle, Irene Papas, Gia Scala, James Darren, Richard Harris\n\nSony has announced a 60th anniversary 4K edition of J. Lee Thompson’s The Guns Of Navarone (1961) — in both the US and the UK. The Blu-Ray from 2011 was a huge upgrade from the DVD, and I’m eager to find out how much more resolution can be gotten out of this thing. (It’s never been a super-sharp-looking film, as far as I can tell.) Sony has listed a lot of extras, some carried over from the Blu-Ray. I’m excited about the restoration of the picture’s original four-track stereo.\n\nOf course, no matter how you see it, The Guns Of Navarone is terrific. Alistair MacLean’s “impossible mission” novel made a great movie — and everyone from director J. Lee Thompson to that stellar cast to composer Dimitri Tiomkin brought their A game. What always strikes me about it is how quickly its 158 minutes go by. (The same can be said for another MacLean picture, 1969’s Where Eagles Dare.)\n\nI haven’t taken the 4K plunge yet, and it’s terrific to see these older pictures getting this UHD treatment. The movie itself, of course, is highly, highly recommended."
