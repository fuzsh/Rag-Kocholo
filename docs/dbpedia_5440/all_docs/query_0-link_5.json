        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nIn the dystopian future of 1991, disease has wiped out domestic animals such as cats and dogs and apes have been used to take their place and act as servants to the wealthy. The now adult child of Cornelius and Zia, Milo/Caesar (Roddy MacDowall) is forced to pretend to be a mute ape like the rest. When his friend and father figure Armando (Ricardo Montalbán) is arrested however, he is sold into slavery, where he witnesses humanity‘s brutality towards apes first hand. Using his superior intelligence he plans an uprising and the stage is set for a dramatic battle between the humans and the apes.\n\nWe continue our series of posts about underrated spin-offs, sequels, prequels and remakes, with the 4th film in the original Planet Of The Apes series.\n\nIt’s rare that sequels prove to be as interesting as the original film, rarer still when it’s the second or third sequel in a series, but I‘d argue that Conquest Of The Planet Of Apes is best of all the sequels to the original film, because it marks a return to the original‘s more serious tone and political allegory. It may seem somewhat bizarre today, but at the time Fox regarded the Apes movies as family films. How anyone could have watched either the original or the first sequel: Beneath The Planet Of The Apes, with their violence and grim apocalyptic endings and thought they were suitable for children is anyone’s guess, but certainly by the time of the second sequel: Escape From The Planet Of The Apes, the focus had shifted to a more humorous approach – despite keeping the satirical elements and the downbeat ending. Conquest courted some serious controversy at the time of it’s release by moving the series away from the gimmicky, kitschy cash cow that Fox (who slashed the series’ budget with every subsequent sequel) clearly saw the series to be and back towards serious sci-fi with a political message, causing Fox to re-edit it after test screenings, toning down the violence and changing the ending due to fears that it might be seen as a call to further racial riots and militant uprising (The Watts race riots were only a few years prior to the film). How many 4th films in a movie franchise can boast that?\n\nDirector Thompson makes great use of the then newly completed Century City (which had been built on land formerly part of the Fox backlot.) Though you‘d be hard to recognize it as such, Century City would be pressed into service by Fox again, a little over a decade later, as the location for Nakatomi Plaza in the first Die Hard movie. At the time of Conquest‘s production however it was uninhabited by residents or businesses allowing the film crew full use of it, giving the movie a feeling of urban futuristic brutalism, which none of the other Apes films have. Using strong contrasting colors (the red and green of the apes‘ uniforms, the beige and black clothes of the military forces) that stand out well against the blue grey of the glass and concrete locations means that it’s one of the most eye catching of the films in the Apes series. The nighttime riot and battle scenes at the end of the film, remind me a little of John Carpenter’s Assault On Precinct 13 and Escape From New York, aided by some striking cinematography from Clint Eastwood’s regular cameraman, Bruce Surtees.\n\nRoddy MacDowall gets to return playing the grown up son of his original character, Cornelius, and clearly relishes the chance to play a much more militant and aggressive character here. Likewise Ricardo Montalbán, is far more interesting as Armando, the former circus owner, in this film than he was in Escape From The Planet Of The Apes. Scared and paranoid, his character has much more nuances than in the former film and for me this one of the best screen performances of his entire career, along with Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan and his hilarious turn in The Naked Gun. Also returning is Natalie Trundy (who was married to producer Arthur P. Jacobs and appeared in all but the first Apes film in one role or another, as a mutant, a doctor and finally here and in the subsequent sequel, as Lisa, Ceasar’s mate.) There’s also good supporting performances from both Don Murray as the unrepentantly evil Governor Breck, who delivers his lines with great gusto and Hari Rhodes as his quieter counterpart, McDonald, the one sympathetic human character other than Armando.The apes films were never subtle about their use of political and social commentary, and so it should come as no surprise that it’s a colored character who provides the voice of reason because he sees parallels between the oppression of the apes and that experienced by his own people. However, at least in this film it feels in keeping with the films ethos and narrative, as opposed to the crude references to the Vietnam war shoehorned into Beneath The Planet Of The Apes."
