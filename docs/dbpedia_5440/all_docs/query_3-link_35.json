        "text": "British director J. Lee Thompson has died in Los Angeles from heart failure at the age of 88. Bristol-born Thompson directed more than fifty films in his career including the original of Cape Fear, Oscar-nominated The Guns of Navarone and that perennial Sunday afternoon favourite, Ice Cold in Alex. From his humble beginnings as an editing assistant for Hitchcock, Thompson rose to the heights of Hollywood to work with the likes of Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn and always insisted on keeping himself busy. At the grand age of 84, Thompson even assisted as a boom microphone operator on the surprisingly good 1998 horror flick, Bride of Chucky"
