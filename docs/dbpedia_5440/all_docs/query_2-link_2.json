        "text": "Efficiency, prolificness and versatility are not necessarily the qualities which make a great film director. J Lee Thompson, who has died aged 88, had all of these, and while he could never be considered in the same British league as David Lean, Michael Powell and Carol Reed, he had many more good films to his name (including The Guns Of Navarone, which won him an Oscar nomination), than most critics might allow.\n\nThompson was a competent craftsman, who served his apprenticeship in the dying days of the British studio system and then, in the early 1960s, turned to Hollywood, where journeymen directors who get the job done quickly and on budget are always appreciated.\n\nThompson was a member of the in-between generation, coming in on the slipstream of Lean and Powell, yet before the arrival of the new wave of Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson. All of these might have sneered at Thompson's middle-budget, middle-brow efforts, yet his lack of pretension was his most cherishable asset. He was a man who saw his career as a ripple in a vast ocean.\n\nThompson was born in Bristol and educated at Dover College. He began as an actor in repertory, a playwright and screenwriter, and spent the second world war in the RAF. He made his debut as a director in 1950 with Murder Without Crime, based on his own sub-Agatha Christie play, which had been seen in the West End before the war. Despite some soggy diversions, such as a remake of The Good Companions, he specialised in realistic crime dramas, and had an early success with his second film, The Yellow Balloon (1952), about a small boy menaced by an underworld blackmailer. The theme of innocence confronting corruption reappeared in 1958 in Tiger Bay, the screen debut of Hayley Mills as a girl kidnapped by a Polish seaman.\n\nThere had been The Weak And The Wicked (1953), about women (Sybil Thorndike, Glynis Johns and Diana Dors) who end in prison; it was based on a book written by his second wife, Joan Henry, who had been jailed for passing fraudulent cheques. The film was a kind of rehearsal for Yield To The Night (1956), Thompson's most notable British work, which drew a powerful performance from Diana Dors as Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in this country. Its passionate argument against capital punishment made it both a media event and a box-office success. By then, Thompson was one of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\nThen came Ice Cold In Alex (1958), the quintessential British war movie, shot in the Libyan desert, with John Mills, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Sims. It hinged less on Allied victory than on Mills's craving for a cold beer; it was immensely popular and led directly to Thompson's biggest hit, The Guns Of Navarone (1961). This all-star adventure, inspired by Lean's The Bridge On The River Kwai and inspiring in turn Robert Aldrich's The Dirty Dozen, was produced and written by the formerly blacklisted American Carl Foreman, who deserves much of the credit.\n\nYet it also showed Thompson's undeniable skill in handling large action scenes without submerging the characters, notably David Niven's frightened explosives expert, Stanley Baker's neurotic knife-wielder and Anthony Quinn's Greek peasant. Thompson also elicited an unusually emotional performance from Gregory Peck, who was to star in several of his subsequent films.\n\nThompson's first film in Hollywood, which turned out to be his finest, was Cape Fear (1961), starring Peck and Robert Mitchum, a study of sexual psychopathy with Mitchum terrorising the wife and daughter of the lawyer who sent him to jail. It was set in the American south, as if one of Thompson's British crime movies had been rewritten by Tennessee Williams.\n\nMitchum's great performance and Thompson's assimilation of the noir and gothic traditions produced a film of unusual menace that caused a well-publicised row with the British Board of Film Censors. Thompson refused to make a reported 161 separate cuts and then had a brief falling-out with Peck after the actor agreed to the cuts.\n\nIt was Thompson's last great picture, though the spectacular western McKenna's Gold (1969, again with Foreman and Peck) had its moments, while small cults gathered around the eerie Eye Of The Devil (1966) and the Shirley MacLaine comedy John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965). Thompson trod water with dire sub-epics like Kings Of The Sun (1963), and Taras Bulba (1962), and sequels to Planet Of The Apes. Perhaps his most ridiculous projects were The Most Dangerous Man In the World (1969) with Peck as a CIA man with a detonator implanted in his head. dropped into Chairman Mao's China, and The Greek Tycoon (1979), with Jacqueline Bisset as Jackie O and Anthony Quinn as Onassis.\n\nIn the late 1970s, with the duds piling up, Thompson suddenly found himself employed by Cannon Films, for which company he bashed out murder and mayhem movies, starring Charles Bronson, with the speed of a 20-year-old working for Roger Corman. Most of them were reprehensible, made for drive-ins and video stores and light years away from the social concern of his crime dramas. But beyond the fulfilled requirement to provide a decent body count per reel, you could sometimes detect the hand of a master technician with a few ironic tricks still up his sleeve."
