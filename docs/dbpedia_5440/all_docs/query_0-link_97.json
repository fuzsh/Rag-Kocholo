It is the fifth and reportedly the last chapter in the fantastically successful series of films inspired by Pierre Boulle's novel “Planet of the Apes” (total domestic earnings to date of the first four films: $33,450,000).\n\nThe time is now A.D. 2670, not long after the cataclysm in which ape rebelled against man and virtually, all civilization was melted into atomic slag.\n\nAccording to the Lawgiver (John Huston), an ape Moses in a shoulder‐length bob who narrates the beginning of the film, a few neurotic human mutants still live in the sewers under the lump that was once Manhattan, while the apes have set up a cheery commune not far away. Their children attend open‐air classes taught by a human slave, and everyone lives in airy, rattan‐furnished tree houses, the sort that any 20th‐century human kid would flip over.\n\nThe commune is called Ape City, but it looks more like an ape Shangri‐la, set in an ape Sherwood Forest and presided over by an ape lama who calls himself Caesar (Roddy McDnwall), husband to Lisa (Natalie Trundy) and father to little Cornelius (Bobby Porter).\n\nAccording to the old Lawgiver, Caesar was sent to earth to bring peace and goodwill to ape and human alike. According to the story by Paul Dehn, no such entente can long endure.\n\nI am told that the plot of “Battle for the Planet of the Apes” more or less brings the story back to the start of the original “Planet of the Apes” (1968), but I can no longer be sure. In my mind the titles of the sequels (“Beneath the Planet of the Apes,” “Escape From the Planet of the Apes,” “Conquest of the Planet of the Apes”) have become as detached from the stories themselves as the titles of Evelyn Waugh's novels or Ozu's films.\n\nIt makes no great differ ence. All of the “Ape” films are alike, and yet each is little different. The common theme (surprisingly pessimistic for this kind of entertainment): ape and man must live in harmony—but they never will. At the end of “Battle for the Planet of the Apes,” after yet another confrontation between ape and man (quite small‐scale, in terms of film logistics), we see a statue of the venerable old Caesar. He successfully fought off an attack by the human mutants and put down an attempted revolt by an ape junta, but still the statue weeps."
