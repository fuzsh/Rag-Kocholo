In 'Death Wish' (1974) mild-mannered New York architect Paul Kersey (Bronson) takes the law into his own hands after his wife is murdered and his daughter raped by a gang of thugs. Jeff Goldblum makes his big-screen debut as one of the unfortunate muggers. In 'Death Wish 2' (1981), after the suicide of his daughter in response to another violent attack, Kersey returns to the streets to deal out revenge to her assailants on a one by one basis. 'Death Wish 3' (1985) sees Kersey, still distraught at the loss of his family, take his rage out on street gangs with weapons including sub-machine guns and missile launchers. In 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown' (1987) the death of his girlfriend's daughter from an overdose makes Kersey determined to wipe out L.A.'s drug dealers. Finally, in 'Death Wish 5 - The Face of Death' (1993) the harassment of Kersey's girlfriend Livia (Lesley-Anne Down) by her ex-husband, O'Shea (Michael Parks), a Mafia boss using her business to launder money, forces Kersey back towards the gun cupboard one final time.\n\nThe Guns Of Navarone (Special Edition) | DVD | (12/02/2007) from £5.99 | Saving you £7.00 (116.86%) | RRP £12.99\n\nOne of the most exciting action films ever made!

Gregory Peck heads a star-studded cast charged with a near impossible mission: destroy a pair of German guns nestled in a protective cave on the strategic Mediterranean island of Navarone, from where they can control a vital sea passage. As world-famous mountain climber turned British army Captain, Mallory (Peck) leads a guerrilla force composed of the humanitarian explosives expert, Miller (David Niven), the ruthless Greek patriot with a grudge, Stavros (Anthony Quinn), veteran special forces soldier Brown (Stanley Baker) and the cool, quiet young marksman Pappadimos (James Darren). This disparate collection of classic types must overcome internal conflicts, enemy attacks, betrayal and capture to complete their mission. Director J. Lee Thompson sets a driving pace for this exciting (if familiar) military operation, a succession of close calls, pitched battles and last-minute escapes as our heroes infiltrate the garrisoned town with the help of resistance leader Maria (Irene Papas) and plot their entry into the heavily guarded mountain fort. Carl Foreman's screenplay embraces MacLean's role call of clichés and delivers them with style, creating one of the liveliest mixes of espionage, combat and good old-fashioned military derring-do put on film, while Dimitri Tiomkin's score is as sturdy as the rock of Navarone itself. --Sean AxmakerOn the DVD: This special-edition DVD gives the modern-day viewer a taste of what movies were like in 1961. Four curious featurettes are included, produced as publicity for the film. James Darren narrates a little ditty at his honeymoon in Malta during filming; Irene Papas narrates a giddy, old-fashioned look at \"Two Girls on the Town\". There is even a filmed bit with producer-writer Carl Foreman that was shown once at the premiere. The 30-minute retrospective, \"Memories of Navarone\", made in 1999 has the expected reminiscences from Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. Director J. Lee Thompson's audio commentary is a bit frustrating; he's now in his 80s, and most of his recollections are slow in coming. A historian could have brought out the film's history (it was the most expensive movie ever made at time of release) and produced a more vital viewing. --Doug Thomas\n\nDeath Wish 1-5 | DVD | (13/01/2014) from £20.00 | Saving you £9.99 (49.95%) | RRP £29.99\n\nDeath WishIn this explosive story of revenge and urban violence Charles Bronson plays Paul Kersey a bleeding-heart liberal who has a change of opinion after his wife and daughter are violently attacked by a gang of thugs in their apartment. His daughter is raped and his wife is raped and murdered. Bronson then turns vigilante as he stalks the mean streets of New York on the prowl for muggers hoodlums and the like. Death Wish is a violent controversial film that is frank and original in its treatment of urban crime and the average citizen's helplessness in dealing with it. Herbie Hancock wrote the musical score and Jeff Goldblum makes his big screen debut as one of the thugs. Death Wish 2Paul Kersey is trying to pick up the pieces of his life in Los Angeles California. His architectural business is successful he has a new girlfriend and although his daughter hasn't recovered from the trauma of her assault she's slowly becoming happier and learning to speak again. But peace is not destined to last and Kersey soon finds himself the victim of a petty crime when some street punks swipe his wallet but this is only a light premonition of things to come. Not satisfied with the wallets contents decides to escalate their crime to a home invasion. They break into Kersey's home and when he tries to retaliate Kersey is viciously beaten and his maid is kicked to death. The punks kidnap his daughter and bring her to their hideout where they rape her thereby causing her to commit suicide. Now Kersey has lost all faith in the justice system and offers no co-operation with local law enforcement. He has plans of his own for each of the thugs that assaulted his family...plans that include their premature deaths. The UK version is based on the unrated version but was censored approx. 3 mins. by the BBFC. Death Wish 3He's Judge Jury and Executioner! Paul Kersey doesn't seek out violence. It just seems to find him. But when it does... he's not about to back down! Charles Bronson brings out the heavy artillery in this gun-blazing no-holds-barred thriller! Road-worn and battle-weary Kersey longs to leave his fighting days behind him. But when he arrives in New York to visit an old friend he finds him brutally attacked and gasping for breath in a pool of blood! Now the silent avenger must wage war once more on the city's punks thugs and hoodlums. But this time he's brought a small arsenal of guns knives - and even a bazooka - to help him! Death Wish 4: The CrackdownArchitect/vigilante Paul Kersey takes on the members of a vicious Los Angeles drug cartel to stop the flow of drugs after his girlfriend's daughter dies from an overdose. Death Wish 5: The Face of DeathNew York's garment district has turns into Dodge City when mobster Tommy O'Shea muscles in on the fashion trade of his ex-wife Olivia Regent. Olivia is engaged to Paul Kersey who provides a sense of security for herself and her daughter Chelsea. Olivia isn't impressed when Tommy tortures her manager Big Al so Tommy hires an enforcer named Freddie Flakes who is a master of disguise. Freddie dons women's clothing to follow Olivia into a ladies' room where he smashes her face into a mirror causing permanent disfigurement. In the offices of D.A. Tony Hoyle and his associate Hector Vasquez Paul and Olivia vow to see to it that Tommy is prosecuted. Later Freddie and two of his men disguise themselves as cops infiltrate Olivia's apartment and shoot Olivia dead. Now Kersey is ready to take things into his own hands. Kersey follows Tommy's thug Chickie Paconi to the Paconi family bistro where Kersey kills Chickie by lacing his cannelloni with cyanide.

Hoyle is in cahoots with Tommy. Using Chelsea as bait Tommy lures Paul to Olivia's factory for a confrontation.\n\nIce Cold In Alex | DVD | (29/01/2007) from £9.54 | Saving you £6.44 (98.32%) | RRP £12.99\n\nA tense engrossing adventure set in the 1942 Libyan war zone in the hot Western Desert. A British ambulance officer (John Mills) escapes the siege in Tobruk and tries desperately to get his passengers to safety in Alexandria where he dreams he will have the luxury of an 'ice cold' glass of beer. His passengers include a stranded hospital nurse a Sergeant-Major and a stray South African Officer trying to return to his unit. Despite saving the group from the Germans something is not quite right about the last passenger. As he begins to undermine the group's stamina using psychological tactics the British officer begins to suspect he might be a German spy...\n\nNorthwest Frontier | DVD | (17/05/2004) from £5.49 | Saving you £4.50 (81.97%) | RRP £9.99\n\nCaptain Scott (More) is sent by the British Governor in India to rescue a five year old Hindu prince and his American governess (Bacall) when a rebellion breaks out among the tribesmen. Pursued by the abductors the trio commandeer a derelict steam train to take them 300 miles through the mountains to safety...\n\nHappy Birthday to Me | Blu Ray | (12/12/2016) from £N/A | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nHappy Birthday to Me typifies the horror genre prior to the self-reflection and irony that saturated the genre in the late '80s and '90s. A solid cast, decent acting, a well-written script, and relatively high production values result in a solid movie that is engaging on its own in addition to offering a glimpse into the history of '80s horror. The plot follows the rules of the genre (later parodied in such films as the Scream and Scary Movie series). A number of teenagers (played by actors who appear visibly older than their characters) from an elite prep school get into mischievous sexual situations fueled by alcohol and pot smoking. As teens start to disappear, murdered in a variety of violent ways, the film suggests a number of suspects. Is the killer the troubled star played by Melissa Sue Anderson who lost her overbearing, social-climbing mother in a car accident that she survived? Or is it the stern school mistress, the wacky, cool social clown, the social misfit, or none of the above? The film keeps you guessing until the final scene. Happy Birthday is a must-see for serious fans of the horror genre and this release is a solid digital mastering of the movie. Hardcore fans should note that the DVD release was not able to secure the rights to the original soundtrack so this version features an alternate soundtrack of largely nondescript '80s electronic music. --Brian Saltzman\n\nTiger Bay | DVD | (17/05/2004) from £5.70 | Saving you £7.29 (127.89%) | RRP £12.99\n\nPolish sailor Korchinsky (Buchholz) is furious to discover his lover has left him for another man and in a confrontation murders her.
