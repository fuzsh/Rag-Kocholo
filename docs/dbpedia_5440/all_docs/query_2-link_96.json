        "text": "British director John Lee Thompson, whose films included the original Cape Fear and The Guns of Navarone, has died at the age of 88.\n\nThe film-maker, who was credited under the name J Lee Thompson, also directed Hollywood actor Charles Bronson in nine movies, including Murphy's Law and Death Wish IV.\n\nMr Thompson, who was born in Bristol, died of congestive heart failure in Sooke, British Columbia.\n\n\"He was a very large directorial presence,\" said co-producer Pancho Kohner.\n\nWorking with Lee, you were spoiled\n\nPancho Kohner, producer\n\n\"He was a gentleman and such a pleasure to work with. Everyone who worked with him once wanted to work with him again and again.\"\n\nMr Kohner collaborated with Thompson on a number of Bronson action films including St Ives, 10 to Midnight, Messenger of Death and White Buffalo.\n\nDirectorial debut\n\nThey also worked together on Mr Thompson's last film, Kinjinte in 1989, which also starred Bronson.\n\nMr Thompson's film career spans back more than 50 years. He made his directorial debut in 1950 with Murder Without Crime.\n\nHe worked with Hollywood legends Diana Dors, Yul Brynner and Anthony Quinn on The Greek Tycoon in 1978.\n\nHe was also responsible for bringing together Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum for the chilling thriller Cape Fear in 1962.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese remade the film in 1991, pairing Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte for the blockbuster.\n\n\"Working with Lee, you were spoiled,\" Mr Kohner said.\n\n\"He had the uncanny ability to play the film in his mind. He would know exactly what shot he needed so there was no wasted effort.\n\n\"He was a talented craftsman.\"\n\nHitchcock voice coach\n\nMr Thompson was not adverse to mucking in with the crew and in 1998 he took a position as a boom microphone operator on the horror movie Bride of Chucky.\n\nHe began his film career after fighting in World War II, starting as an editing assistant in London's Elstree Studios.\n\nHe progressed to working as a dialogue coach on Alfred Hitchcock films.\n\nHe moved to the US following the success of The Guns of Navorone, which was nominated for a best director Academy Award but was beaten by West Side Story.\n\nWhile in the US he directed the sequels to Planet of the Apes, including Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes.\n\nMr Thompson leaves behind his wife of 40 years, Penny, a daughter and a grand-daughter."
