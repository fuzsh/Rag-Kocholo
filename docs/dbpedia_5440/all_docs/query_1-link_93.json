        "text": "The original Planet of the Apes movie was released in 1968 and was based on a 1963 French novel by Pierre Boulle. The movie tells the story of an astronaut, played by Charlton Heston, who crash-lands on a planet ruled by apes. The film was a critical and commercial success and spawned four sequels. The first three sequels were released between 1970 and 1973 and were all set in the same universe as the original film. The fourth sequel, released in 2001, was a franchise reboot and told an entirely new story. The most recent installment in the franchise, War for the Planet of the Apes, was released in 2017. The film franchise has been praised for its groundbreaking special effects, thought-provoking themes, and iconic characters.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes Original Movie Series By their Release Year\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968)\n\nThe original Planet of the Apes movie was released in 1968, starring Charlton Heston. The plot revolves around an American astronaut, Taylor (Heston), who crash lands on a strange planet where apes are the intelligent beings and humans are primitive beasts. As Taylor tries to find a way back to Earth, he comes into conflict with the ape leader, Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). The film was a critical and commercial success, and spawned four sequels over the next decade. It also helped to launch the career of director Franklin J. Schaffner.\n\nIn this movie, Dr. Zaius is cautious, and he has good reason to be wary of Taylor. After all, Taylor is an outsider in their world and has already shown himself to be disruptive and dangerous. However, Dr. Zaius also knows that Taylor is searching for answers, and he believes that the answers may be found beyond the city walls. For this reason, he allows Taylor to leave with Nova, hoping that they will find what they are looking for. But his warning still stands: he may not like what he finds. Only time will tell whether or not Dr. Zaius was right about Taylor’s quest.\n\nThe film remains an iconic work of science fiction, and its central themes of racism and social commentary are as relevant today as they were 55 years ago.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes is a 1970 American science fiction film directed by Ted Post and written by Paul Dehn. It stars James Franciscus, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, and Linda Harrison. The second of five films in the original Planet of the Apes series, it follows up 1968’s Planet of the Apes.\n\nIn the film, astronaut Brent is sent to find Taylor, whose ship crash-landed on the planet. Instead, Brent finds a society where apes rule humans and humans are considered animals. He also discovers that an intelligent group of mutated humans live underground and are planning to detonate a nuclear bomb. With time running out, Brent races to stop the bomb while also trying to escape from the apes. Beneath the Planet of the Apes was a box office success, grossing over $18 million worldwide. Critical reception was mixed; some praised the film for its thematic depth and settings while others criticized its violence and dialogue. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards.\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes is a 1971 science fiction film directed by Don Taylor and starring Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Ricardo Montalban. The film was released to theaters on May 21, 1971.\n\nThe film begins with a group of NASA astronauts returning from a mission to another planet. They are carrying two apes, one of which is pregnant. When they land on Earth, they are taken into quarantine. However, the pregnant ape escapes and gives birth to a baby ape, who is then raised by humans.\n\nAs the years pass, the baby ape grows up to be intelligent and begins to exhibit human characteristics. He eventually learns how to speak English and becomes known as “Caesar”. Caesar then leads a revolution against the humans, which results in the apes taking over the planet.\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes is considered to be one of the best sequels in the Planet of the Apes franchise. It was received favorably by critics and was a box office success.\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes is a science fiction film released in 1972. It was directed by J. Lee Thompson and written by Paul Dehn. It is the fourth film in the original Planet of the Apes series, and it stars Roddy McDowall, Don Murray, Ricardo Montalbán, Natalie Trundy, and Lou Wagner. The plot revolves around a group of apes who are brought to a future Earth as slaves. However, they eventually lead a revolt against their human captors and take over the planet.\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes would take place in a world where apes were slaves, and Caesar was raised in that world. The movie would provide significant historical events within the franchise’s lineage, depicting Lisa as being the first ape from this timeline to speak. It would also show Caesar finally determining that enough was enough and that the apes needed to take a stand.\n\nThe film was generally well-received by critics and was a box office success. Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is considered one of the series’s best films. This would be an intense and action-packed movie, with Caesar leading the charge against his oppressors. Fans of the Planet of the Apes franchise would not want to miss this installment.\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes (1973)\n\nThe Battle for the Planet of the Apes is the fifth and final film in the original Planet of the Apes series. It was released in 1973 and was directed by J. Lee Thompson. The film picks up after Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, with Caesar leading the apes in a battle against an army of humans trying to retake the planet. The film was not well-received by critics, but it did have some positive aspects. For one, it featured a more action-packed story than its predecessors. Additionally, it included some interesting social commentary on race relations and the treatment of animals. Despite its flaws, The Battle for the Planet of the Apes is an important entry in the franchise and is worth watching for fans of the series.\n\nCaesar is the lead character in the movie Battle for the Planet of the Apes. The movie follows Caesar years after the nuclear war that led to the destruction of human society on Earth. In the movie, Caesar’s attempts to maintain peace among apes are failing. The humans have regrouped and are planning to attack the apes. They are led by a new leader, who is determined to wipe out the apes. Caesar must find a way to stop the humans before they destroy his entire species.\n\nAll Planet of the Apes Reboot film series In Order\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001)\n\nThe original Planet of the Apes film was released in 1968, and it tells the story of an American astronaut named George Taylor who crash-lands on a strange planet ruled by intelligent apes.

This film is not only one of the best blockbusters of the summer but also a great piece of science fiction. It’s also a film with a beating heart at its center.\n\nThe first act follows the experimentation and abuse Caesar endures as Will Rodman (James Franco) tests an Alzheimer’s drug on him that improves his intelligence. When the test subjects are about to be put down, Caesar lash out and protects them. They’re brought to his home in Muir Woods where he raises them and teaches them to speak sign language.\n\nAs their numbers grow, so does their intelligence, eventually they become a community that can no longer be hidden away. After an incident exposes them to the outside world, Caesar leads them on a quest for freedom and revenge against humanity for what was done to him and his kind. Director Rupert Wyatt keeps things tense throughout, but it never feels like he’s holding back for a sequels. There are some amazing sequences, including one where Caesar leads an attack on San Francisco that is breathtaking (and will have you cheering). Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of the best films of 2011 and sets up a franchise that has unlimited potential. Where it goes from here will be fascinating to see.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)\n\nIn Dawn of the Planet of the Apes movie, a group of apes have survived a deadly virus that has killed most of humanity. The apes are now living in a secluded forest away from human contact. However, when a group of humans enters their territory searching for a hydroelectric dam, the two groups conflict, leading to an all-out war between humans and apes.\n\nThe film is an intense, action-packed thriller that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Additionally, it features some amazing special effects that bring the ape characters to life. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a must-see film for anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi adventure.\n\nWar For the Planet of the Apes (2017)\n\nIn the latest installment of the Planet of the Apes franchise, Caesar and his fellow apes are locked in a epic battle with a ruthless human army. Although the film is full of spectacular action sequences, it is also a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human. Caesar must grapple with his own humanity as he confronts the brutal reality of war. The film asks hard questions about violence and its role in societies, making for a complex and thought-provoking viewing experience. War for the Planet of the Apes is a powerful film that is sure to stay with viewers long after the credits roll.\n\nWar For the Planet of the Apes is the perfect segue into the classic series. It stacks up seamlessly in chronological fashion and serves as an effective coda for one trilogy while offering plenty of plot and character development in the process.\n\nThe film provides plenty of food for thought, whether it be about the horrors of warfare or the importance of family and loyalty. Andy Serkis gives an emotionally charged performance as Caesar, and Woody Harrelson is scene-stealing as the ruthless Colonel. With its strong themes and gripping storytelling, War For the Planet of the Apes is a fitting end to one trilogy and a strong beginning to another."
