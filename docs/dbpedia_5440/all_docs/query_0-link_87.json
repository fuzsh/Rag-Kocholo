        "text": "Planet of the Apes Series Episode 4\n\nAfter the comedy showcase that was Escape from the Planet of the Apes viewers probably wouldn’t expect a violent commentary on race relations as a follow-up. But that was exactly what was delivered in the fourth film of the series — Conquest of the Planet of the Apes starring Roddy McDowall returning in the new role of ape revolutionary leader Caesar. This film was heavily modified to be family-friendly for release, but still had a harder edge than the previous films. Does this change of tone fit the series?
