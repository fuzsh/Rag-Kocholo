Conquest of the Planet of the Apes

Entry updated 24 August 2020. Tagged: Film.

Film (1972). Apjac/Twentieth Century Fox. Directed by J Lee Thompson. Written by Paul Dehn, based on characters created by Pierre Boulle. Cast includes Roddy McDowall, Don Murray, Hari Rhodes and Natalie Trundy. 86 minutes. Colour.

This was the fourth in the ever-weakening series of films beginning in 1968 with Planet of the Apes. Caesar (McDowall), the ape born in Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), is being kept in a circus but comes to resent the human exploitation of apes so much that, with the help of a sympathetic and all too symbolic Black man (Rhodes), he incites his fellow primates to revolt. The film ends with apes victorious over humans after a bloody battle, thus laying the ground for the future situation (there has been a time-warp) of Planet of the Apes. All this is crudely simplistic. The novelization is Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1974) by John Jakes. [JB]
