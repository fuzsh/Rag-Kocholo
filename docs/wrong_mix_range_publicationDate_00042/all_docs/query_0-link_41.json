        "text": "Scog hung in space, close enough to the Roof of the World so she could faintly hear her pulses echoing back from its jagged hardness. Coming back from everything in the area, those pulses told her of almost everything around her out to past the distance where it could be dangerous.\n\nAlmost everything. Sneakers had skins that soaked up pulses and didn’t let them return to the Quorn who’d sent them forth. If you weren’t careful, you’d think a sneaker was a harmless little worm or jelly. Its pulses sounded small and wary, too. They did till it got close enough to jet at you and seize you with its beak, anyway.\n\nNo sneakers. Scog had learned to take due care, as any Quorn with a shell that had more than four or five chambers did. A small swimmer scooted along. Scog’s pulses showed her the animal’s shape. She could also hear its tail flipping back and forth and pushing it through space.\n\nMost of the time, swimmers were faster than jetters. But a jetter could squirt forward in a burst quicker than any swimmer could match. Am I close enough? Scog asked herself.\n\nShe decided she was. Along with considered judgment, hunger had something to do with what she chose. She gathered herself, then loosed a jet that shot her toward the swimmer. It heard that, of course, and let out a shrill alarm cry as its tail flipped faster to take it away from peril.\n\nToo late. Too slow. A pair of Scog’s tentacles lay hold of the swimmer and brought it to her beak. She bit down. Swimmers were delicious, though she knew the stink of sudden death this one let out as she began to eat would frighten off other nearby food creatures till it dissipated in the limitless vastness of space.\n\nThe swimmer made a three-bite snack, not a meal. After Scog finished, she jetted away from where she’d made her kill. The death stink unsettled her, too, though she understood perfectly well she’d caused it. Quorn were far more clever than other creatures that lived near the Roof of the World, but some things operated at a level far below the one where cleverness mattered.\n\nSomething about her own size lay near the edge of her perception as she slowed once more. No, not something—someone. That shell had the same shape as her own. Along with her usual location pulses, she sent out some only her clan used. They amounted to, “Who are you? Are you one of us?”\n\nAn answer came back at once, easily recognizable through the background babble of animal noise: “Is that you, Scog?”\n\n“Oh, hello, Lund! You were so far off, I couldn’t hear your shape, but I always recognize your voice. What are you up to?” Scog said.\n\n“I was trying to catch up to a school of networms. I smelled them off in the distance, but then a cold current got in my way and I lost the scent. Annoying!” Lund let out a disgusted odor.\n\n“I hate when things like that happen,” Scog said sympathetically. Quorn had trained and bred networms to form themselves into a food-catching net when they got the proper sound and scent commands. That helped her folk hunt; the scraps the networms siphoned out of space meant they didn’t lose in the deal, either.\n\n“A stinking nuisance,” Lund agreed, swimming closer. He went on, “I was talking with Ib not long ago. Do you know what she got her tentacles on?”\n\n“Tell me,” Scog urged. Quorn were no more immune to gossip than any other intelligent race anywhere in the universe.\n\n“Ib has”—Lund paused portentously—“a stone point, up from the Bottom!”\n\n“Are you sure she wasn’t making that up just to impress you?”\n\n“I heard the point with my own ears. I didn’t just hear it, either. She let me touch it. It was stone. I touched stone once before, a long time ago. I know what it feels like. Nothing else is rough and sharp that way.”\n\n“I’ve heard of the stuff—who hasn’t?—but I’ve never laid a tentacletip on it myself. I’m jealous of you. I’m even more jealous of Ib,” Scog said. “All the way up from the Bottom!”\n\nSpace had four or five zones, depending on where you were and on whom you chose to believe. Folk like Scog and Lund, who swam near the Roof of the World, could descend only so far before the growing weight of space pressing down on them crushed in their shells and killed them. Conversely, the talkers in the next deeper zone—odd creatures, with long shells rather than round ones—would explode from the inside out if they rose too high.\n\nSo it went, layer by layer, zone by zone, down to the Bottom. Talkers lived there, too. Scog knew that, though she had no idea what they were like. Reports of them came up through no one knew how many intermediaries, and they all disagreed with one another. Maybe more than one kind of talker dwelt there. Who could say?\n\nMore than reports came up. Warm currents of space rose from the Bottom, currents full of things tiny creatures ate. Bigger creatures fed on the tiny ones, then creatures bigger still, and finally creatures big enough for Quorn to eat. And the Bottom dwellers, however many sorts there were, had access to stone and other marvels those who lived in upper space could only imagine and envy. Scog wondered what the folk in the next higher zone traded to get things like that. What else could be worth so much?\n\nLund went on, “Since the stone isn’t mine, I have to use what I can. I’m going after those networms again. With a little luck, just a little, I’ll catch a trace of their scent and swim them down. Hope I hear and smell you soon, Scog.” He turned and started to leave.\n\nBefore he could—for that matter, before Scog could even answer him—they both stopped, freezing in place as if they’d suddenly become parts of the frigid Roof of the World. That was what a noise unlike anything Scog had ever heard before could do. And, she realized, she hadn’t thought of the Roof of the World by accident. The strange noise sounded as if it was coming from beyond it, which had to be impossible . . . didn’t it?\n\nThe noise was harsh, grinding, rasping. It was so discordant, it made Scog wish she had no ears. She’d never wished for anything like that before. Once in a great while, a Quorn was hatched deaf or lost hearing through some injury or illness. Such luckless ones never lasted long. Scent and touch simply weren’t enough to live in space.\n\nAs the noise went on and on, Scog exclaimed, “What is that?” She answered her own question, though not in any useful way: “Whatever it is, it’s horrible!”\n\n“If the Quorn Who Made the Roof, Space, and the Bottom truly has a radula like ours, it might sound like that gnawing through a shell,” Lund said.\n\nOf themselves, Scog’s tentacles twisted in the sign of respect Quorn used when they spoke of their leading deity. She could hear Lund doing the same thing. After a moment, she said, “It sounds like it’s gnawing through the Roof of the World towards us! Why would the Great Quorn do that?”\n\n“Gods do what they do for their reasons, not for ours,” Lund answered, which was bound to be true but wasn’t helpful. He continued, “I thought the stuff of the Roof of the World went on forever, the way the Bottom is supposed to. I never imagined a god could get purchase on the other side and start boring through.”\n\n“I never imagined there was another side,” Scog said.\n\n“Neither did I,” he said. “Maybe those stories the rememberers tell are true after all. Maybe the Roof of the World does split open now and then, so space goes all the way up to the top till it gets hard again.”\n\n“I’ve heard rememberers sing that, too. I’ve never met any Quorn who heard it with their own ears or smelled it with their own olfactory pores. Till I do, I’m not going to believe it,” Scog said stubbornly.\n\n“Or till the Great Quorn’s radula gnaws through and pokes down into space where we can hear it ourselves.” Lund’s voice was sly.\n\n“We can hear it now. I wish we couldn’t,” Scog said. “It makes my brain hurt.”\n\n“Mine, too. Everybody’s, I’m sure. Everything’s,” Lund said. “Everything with ears is probably swimming away from this stretch of space as fast as it can.”\n\n“We should do that.” Scog joined action to word. Lund swam with her. The grinding, rasping noise pursued them like a bad smell. Before long, they heard other Quorn who were doing their best to get away from the alarming sound coming out of the Roof of the World.\n\nOne of them was Ib. Scog could hear the marvelous stone point in spite of the tentacle the other Quorn protectively wrapped around it. She wanted to ask if she might touch it, too. Before she could, though, Ib said, “What do we do if that gnawing thing bites all the way through the Roof of the World and comes down into our space?”\n\nThat question made Scog’s swimming fin miss a stroke. Lund had said the same thing. Scog didn’t want to believe anything so horrible could happen. “Why would the Quorn Who Made the Roof, Space, and the Bottom want to do that?” she asked in return.\n\n“How do you know it is the Great Quorn?” Ib said. “Maybe it’s a monster swimming in the space beyond the Roof of the World.”\n\n“Till now, nobody ever imagined there was any space beyond it. I always thought it went on forever. Doesn’t everybody?” Scog said.\n\n“Well, we Quorn mostly do,” Ib allowed. “But the Longshell I got my knife from—that’s what he called it, a knife—said they think there’s another world like ours on the far side of the Roof.” She shifted her tentacle a little so Scog could hear the sharp stone better.\n\nScog let out a scornful little jet of space through her siphon. “What do Longshells know about the Roof? Only what we tell them! They can’t come all the way up to it—they’d die if they tried. Besides, are you ever sure you knew what the creature was saying?”\n\n“Well, I thought so.” But Ib sounded suddenly doubtful. Talkers of different sorts could communicate with one another when they met. Otherwise, there would have been only struggle between them, not trade. But one kind couldn’t understand another as well as it could with its fellows. Then Ib spoke with more determination: “If the thing tries to break into our space, we should fight it!”\n\n“How?” Scog thought that was a reasonable question.\n\nIb, though, dismissed it with the wave of a tentacle that wasn’t holding anything. “We don’t know what it’s like yet. When we find out, we can hear what to do next. Or have you got a better idea?”\n\n“When you put it like that, no,” Scog admitted. Ib changed her hearing pulse ever so slightly, into a sardonic rhythm that could only mean I told you so.\n\nTime went on. The rasping, grinding sound went on, too—on and on and on. It never ceased. In fact, it kept getting louder, as if the toothed tongue (Scog couldn’t help thinking of the thing that made the noise as a radula, though she had no idea if it really was) was coming closer.\n\nBecause it was so unpleasant, the Quorn who usually hunted in that part of space had to go to or even beyond the edge of what they and the neighboring clans thought of as their territory. That caused less trouble than Scog expected. The sound was so loud and so unpleasant, it brought Quorn from far away to try to learn what it was and how it might be stopped.\n\n“Until it comes through the Roof of the World, if it ever does, I don’t know what we can do about it,” Scog told one stranger after another. Ib was right about that, however little Scog liked it.\n\n“But it’s driving us mad!” was what she most often heard back. It was also driving her mad. She wondered if the Great Quorn was saying she and her folk needed to go crazy before they could find out the answer to the infuriating abrasion.\n\nA Quorn who’d come up from near the boundary to the next lower level told her, “It’s loud enough to frighten the Longshells, too. In fact, one of them said to me—I’m pretty sure that’s what she said—the Talking Worms down below them are scared. Maybe it goes even deeper than that.”\n\nAll the Quorn knew of the Talking Worms was what they heard from the Longshells. By the nature of things, none of them had ever heard or smelled or tried to speak with a Talking Worm themselves. The two kinds could, would, never meet. The folk who swam or jetted below the Talking Worms were rumors multiply distorted.\n\nBut there was stone on the Bottom. Ib had that point made from it. And other Quorn who wrapped their tentacles around tools made from the marvelous stuff brought it toward the fearsome sound from above. They all seemed to realize only the extraordinary had even the smallest chance of defeating whatever made it.\n\nNetworm wranglers like Lund and other males and females who could control venomous swimmers also came to do what they could. It made Scog proud. “We’ve never all joined together like this,” she said to Lund. “Not in all the time we have stories about.”\n\n“The talkers in the zones under ours are doing what they can, too, or I think they are,” he replied.\n\nScog understood what he meant. Nobody—nobody who was a Quorn, anyhow—could be sure about any of the races that dwelt in the depths of space. She said, “I wonder if they wish they could be the ones facing the rasping thing or if they’re glad we’ve got to do it.”\n\n“It will depend, I think. If we can make the giant radula quiet down or go away, they’ll all think they could have done it easier or faster,” Lund said. “But if we can’t, they’ll blame us and hope it doesn’t sink so deep enough that they’ll have to try to fight it.”\n\n“You make more sense than I wish you did. That sounds like something they would do.” Scog paused for a moment. “That sounds like something we’d do, too, if we had the chance.”\n\n“It does, doesn’t it?” Lund sounded unhappy about agreeing, but agree he did. He pointed several of his tentacles up toward the part of the Roof of the World where the noise was coming from. “I just wish it would stop. It doesn’t feel like it’s outside of me any more. It feels like it’s rasping its way right through my brain.”\n\n“Oh, good!” Scog exclaimed. Lund made a quizzical change in his sound-pulse pattern. She amplified: “I’m not the only one, then.”\n\n“By now, I think everybody who can hear it feels that way. It goes on and on. It never stops. It never sleeps. Everything has to rest some of the time, everything that’s alive. Or I thought it did, till that started up.”\n\n“Does the Great Quorn, the Quorn Who Made the Roof, Space, and the Bottom, have to rest?” Scog asked.\n\nLund turned toward her as if she were holding a piece of delicious-smelling bait in one tentacle, just waiting for an unwary worm to come by and grab it so she could gobble up a meal. “I’m not going to snap at that,” he said. “First you have to tell me whether the Great Quorn is alive the way you and I are.”\n\n“I always thought the god went on forever. That’s what makes a god a god, that and being strong.” Scog hesitated. “Till the noise started, I never imagined the Great Quorn would want to bore through the Roof and start sucking out the world’s juices.”\n\n“You have a way with words, don’t you?” By Lund’s tone, it wasn’t a way he much cared for.\n\n“I’m sorry. I don’t like what’s going on any better than you do, or than anybody else does. But why else would that grinding keep on the way it does?”\n\n“I don’t know. Now that you said that, though, I can’t unhear it or forget it.”\n\nMaybe I should try spinning tales, then, Scog thought. If the thing gnawing through the Roof of the World doesn’t kill us all, I’ll have a good one to spin. And if it did . . . She waggled her tentacles in a way that meant In that case, I won’t need to worry about it, will I?\n\nScog woke suddenly, throwing her tentacles out every which way at once, as she might have if a loud noise close by startled her from sleep. But no reverberations from any loud noise lingered in space. None reflected from anyone or anything close by, or from the more distant Roof of the World. In fact, everything out as far as she could hear was pretty quiet.\n\nFor a moment, she simply accepted that. Then she gave another wild startled jerk of her tentacles. It wasn’t what she heard that had jerked her from sleep like a spearfin’s envenomed dart. It was what she didn’t hear, what she’d got used to—got resigned to—hearing but wasn’t there any more.\n\nThe thing that had been boring down through the Roof of the World was silent.\n\nWhich meant . . . what? Had it stopped because it couldn’t get through, because it wasn’t strong enough or wasn’t long enough to rasp all that way, however long that way happened to be? Or was it quiet now because it had broken through and didn’t need to grind any more?\n\nOne answer said one thing; the other, something altogether different. How to find out which was true . . .\n\nShe tried the obvious way: she sent pulses up toward the Roof of the World. But she was a good distance away from it, and she wasn’t right under the spot where the gigantic radula had been rasping. And between here and that stretch of the Roof were a good many Quorn swimming and even jetting—and obscuring the shapes that lay beyond them.\n\nThey were, she realized, swimming and jetting toward the place from which the grinding noise had been coming. That didn’t directly answer her question, but it gave her a clue. She also started swimming in that direction, and squirting space out through her siphon to go faster.\n\nThere was Ib, also using her jet. Scog recognized her more by the stone point she held than by the shape of her shell. “Is it through?” she called.\n\n“It’s through,” Ib answered. “Didn’t you hear it when it came down into space?”\n\n“I was asleep. What woke me was not hearing the horrible noise. I can think straight again, or I hope I can.”\n\n“That would be good,” Ib said. Scog almost sent an angry pulse of sound at the other Quorn, but at the last instant stifled it instead.\n\nThey swam on. As they drew closer to the place where the radula had broken through the Roof of the World, Scog aimed her pulses upward, to try to learn what it sounded like. She kept having trouble. For one thing, a great many Quorn filled space between her and the interloper. There were so many of them, their shells and tentacles hid it from her. For another, they were all, or almost all, sending out pulses themselves. She had a hard time sorting the echoes coming back from hers out from the rest of them.\n\n“We’ll never get through the crowd,” Ib complained.\n\n“Oh, yes, we will.” Scog was not about to give up without satisfying her curiosity. She took direct and bumptious action. Bumptious indeed—she bumped a male out of the way when he wouldn’t move aside on his own.\n\n“What do you think you’re doing?” he asked irately. The way he spoke said he’d swum here from some far-off part of space; Scog could hardly understand him. When she was sure she did, she answered, “I think I’m getting by. I’m right, too. You here, Ib?”\n\n“Just in back of you,” her clansmate said. They both left the indignant male behind.\n\nAfter a while, Ib took the lead. She didn’t have to threaten anyone with the sharpened stone she carried; just letting strangers hear she had it was plenty to make them scurry away so she couldn’t slash them with it. The ones who didn’t scurry away also bore sharp stones or other curious and probably dangerous things that had come up almost to the Roof of the World from the Bottom.\n\nAnd there was someone bringing along the biggest school of networms Scog had ever heard in one place. Yes, it was Lund. She felt proud of him—he was showing Quorn from near and far what he could do.\n\nBefore she could call out and say so, she managed to aim an unblocked pulse at the thing that had pierced the Roof of the World. The sounds that came back from it left her more perplexed than she had been before she heard it clearly.\n\nIt was long and skinny. That didn’t surprise her; most radulas were. She also wasn’t surprised to hear that space had already hardened up again around the place where the thing broke through. But the thing itself also sounded hard, as if it were made of shell or smooth stone, not the flesh she’d expected.\n\nAs Scog came closer, she got off another unimpeded pulse. Something at the base of the improbably hard radula was moving in a horizontal circle. It might have been scanning the area around it. It might have been, but it wasn’t. Scog was sure it wasn’t because . . .\n\nIb said it before she could: “Whatever that thing is, it’s not letting out any sound! None at all!”\n\n“You beat me to it,” Scog said. “Why did it rasp all the way through the Roof of the World and then not try to find out what space is like? That makes no sense. It can’t be waiting for one of us to come close enough to be grabbed or tasted. And smell by itself can only tell you so much.”\n\n“Speaking of making sense, maybe it has senses we don’t,” Ib said.\n\n“I can’t imagine how it would,” Scog said. “Hearing, touch, smell, taste . . . What other senses could there possibly be?”\n\n“Balance?” Ib was doing her best to be difficult.\n\nScog made an exasperated noise. “All right. Fine. Balance. Tell me how a sense of balance helps that thing know what’s around it, please.”\n\n“I can’t,” Ib said cheerfully. “But I can tell that I’m not upside down or sidewise, and I don’t need to hear myself or feel myself to do it.”\n\n“With you, it wouldn’t matter,” Scog said tartly. Ib thought that was funny, which only annoyed Scog more. She went on, “Anyway, what’s important is how we can make that thing go back where it came from—or, if we can’t do that, how we can hurt it enough so it doesn’t do anything any more.”\n\n“That is important,” Ib agreed. “How can we do either one of those things?”\n\n“I’ve got no idea,” Scog said in a small voice.\n\nThe male from far away, the one Scog and Ib had passed on their way toward the giant radula, was brave even if he didn’t swim very fast. He edged right up to the strange thing, sounded it at really close range, and felt of it with his tentacles. It rested quietly in space and didn’t try to do anything to him. He couldn’t have known that it wouldn’t before he tried, though. Other Quorn—Scog, Ib, and Lund among them—let out toots of admiration as he made his getaway. He moved quite smartly then.\n\n“It feels the way it sounds,” he reported. “Very smooth and hard, smoother and harder than anything I ever felt before. Oh—I nibbled at it, too. My beak couldn’t do anything to it, and it didn’t taste like anything much.”\n\n“Beaks are tough. Stone is tougher,” Ib said, and brandished hers.\n\n“What is that thing at the bottom, the one that keeps going round and round? It’s the only part of the radula that’s doing anything,” Scog said.\n\n“Let’s see how strong it is.” Ib swam toward the tube that had come down through the Roof of the World. She stabbed at it with the stone she carried in her tentacles.\n\nWhatever the thing was, it proved not just strong as stone but stronger than stone. Scog heard the snap! as Ib’s knife broke. Ib was left holding the rear portion, the part the Bottom-dwellers hadn’t chipped so sharp. The business end tumbled through space, down, down, down.\n\nCursing furiously, Ib jetted after it. She managed to grab it before anyone else could. Even tiny fragments of stone were valuable all out of proportion to their size. She rose more slowly than she’d sunk.\n\nWhen she’d made her way back up to the neighborhood of the gigantic radula, Scog greeted her with, “Well, that didn’t work.”\n\n“Too right, it didn’t,” Ib agreed in mournful tones.\n\n“Oh! Listen!” Scog said. “Lund is trying with his networms!”\n\nLund deployed the great school of networms he’d brought with his customary cunning. He used trills and scents to shape them into a cylinder that fit around the huge radula.\n\nIt did nothing to try to evade them. Now that it was down here, it didn’t seem to do anything but spin that tough thing at its tip. Why would it have rasped its way down through the Roof of the World just to do that? Nothing about it made any sense to Scog—or, clearly, to any of the other Quorn.\n\nAt Lund’s squeak, the cylinder closed in. The networms’ stinging palps tried to pierce the great radula’s hide. They had no more luck than that male from far away had had with his beak or Ib with her now broken knife. Frustrated, the networms broke contact and swam away in spite of everything Lund could do to make them come back to him.\n\nHe was frustrated, too, as he came over to Scog and Ib. “I think the Great Quorn sent that thing down through the Roof of the World just to infuriate us,” he said, and then, a moment later, “It’s working, too.”\n\n“It is!” Ib bounced sound from each of her two pieces of stone in turn. The places where it had snapped now had their own sharp edges, not that they would do her much good: they seemed more likely to cut her. She made a small, sorrowful noise; the knife had been more useful when it was whole.\n\nWithout a stone tool of her own, without a school of networms to help her, Scog swam toward the enormous radula. She pulsed sound toward the turning thing at its base. The closer she got, the more accurately she could hear—and the more interesting the thing seemed. Along with the thick main tentacle connecting it to the rest of the radula, it had a couple of very thin strands on opposite sides of the thick one.\n\nScog reached out and touched one of the thin strands. When she pulled, it gave a little, but only a little. Even that small yielding encouraged her; nothing else on the radula seemed to have any give at all.\n\nShe pulled harder, jetting away from the radula to add force to her effort. Try as she would, though, she wasn’t strong enough to pull the thin tentacle loose. It was as firmly connected to the radula as her own tentacles were to her head.\n\nThat thought led to another one. When Quorn—Quorn without stone tools, anyhow—fought, they used not only tentacles but biting beaks. What would happen if, instead of pulling on that strand, she nipped it?\n\nOnly one way to find out. Hooking the thin strand with the end of her beak, she bit down on it, gently at first, then harder. If her beak lacked the strength to injure that strand, someone else would have to figure out what to try next.\n\nFor a moment, she thought she would fail. But then her beak cut through an outer layers and made contact with something harder inside. An instant later, she jetted away from the thing with all her strength.\n\nShe also must have let out a cry of alarm, but she didn’t realize she had till Ib exclaimed, “What happened?”\n\nScog needed a few beats of her hearts to take stock of herself and decide she was probably all right. She needed a few more heartsbeats to gather herself enough to answer: “The stupid thing shocked me! It shocked me like a bugelklitz! I never expected it could do anything like that!”\n\nWhen you heard them swimming along, bugelklitzen didn’t seem like much. They were smaller than Quorn, and unable to go very fast. But creatures in this part of space soon learned to keep their distance from them. A bugelklitz’s shock could stun at some distance from the swimmer itself; at close range, it could kill small animals and leave even Quorn too addled to defend themselves when the bugelklitz slowly swam up and began to feed.\n\n“Well, you did something to it, too,” Ib said. “That bottom part isn’t going round and round any more. Maybe you killed it.”\n\nMaybe the shock Scog got had addled her. She hadn’t thought to check if she’d hurt the thing that went around and around. When he did, she heard that Ib was right. She could smell her own satisfaction, too. “Maybe I did,” she said. “By the Great Quorn, I hope so!”\n\nProfessor Darius Heydari walked briskly to the lectern on one side of the stage at the Von Karman auditorium. The big-screen monitor behind him showed only black. From the surround-sound speakers, though, came unearthly—unearthly in the most literal sense of the word—trills and squeals and screeches.\n\nThe crowd filling the seats in the hall on the JPL campus was as motley as the noises bubbling out of the speakers. Astronomers and xenologists rubbed shoulders with reporters and bloggers and science fiction writers. (For that matter, some of the scientists also wrote sf, while others had considerable social-media footprints.) They all sported badges showing they were authorized to be there. Heydari wore one himself.\n\nHe waited till most of the audience was looking at him. Then he tapped the mic on the lectern to get the attention of the others.\n\n“Good morning,” he said with a tired smile—like most of the Sarpedon team, he hadn’t been sleeping much lately. “The last day and a half have been quite something, haven’t they?”\n\n“Why would you think that?” somebody called from the crowd, and got a laugh.\n\nProfessor Heydari smiled again, more broadly this time. He managed a couple of syllables’ worth of chuckle. “When Sarpedon landed on Europa and began to drill through the surface ice toward the ocean below, we had no idea what we would find in the water there. We had no idea whether we’d find anything there at all—anything organic, I mean.”\n\n“Well, we did!” a woman exclaimed. People were too excited to keep quiet, even if most of them were running on coffee and fumes just like him.\n\n“Yes, we did.” Heydari nodded. “We found the answer to a question we’ve been asking for thousands of years. We aren’t alone in the universe, either as life or as intelligent life. We’ll spend the rest of our time on Earth—and wherever else we go—working out just what that means.”\n\nHe touched controls on top of the lectern. The big screen behind him lit up. In the upper right-hand corner were the words RECORDED PREVIOUSLY and a digital time signature from three days earlier.\n\nSomething came into the beam of light Sarpedon’s video system shot out into the waters beneath Europa’s icy surface. It looked more like a chambered nautilus than any other earthly creatures: it had a spiral shell, tentacles, and a beak. But one way it differed from a nautilus was immediately obvious—it had no eyes at all.\n\n“Europa’s icy crust ranges in thickness from about fifteen to twenty-five kilometers, and—” Heydari began.\n\nBefore he could go any further, someone—almost certainly a reporter—asked, “What’s that in miles?”\n\nThe professor would have been more irked had he been more surprised. But he’d expected the question, and answered with no sign of annoyance: “Nine to fifteen. Thanks to ground-piercing radar, Sarpedon landed where it was thinnest. Even so, light can’t penetrate that far. Except for major meteor strikes and occasional ruptures in the icy crust, ours is the first light to have shone in that ocean for billions of years. The creatures there haven’t evolved organs to sense it. By what we hear, whatever they use for ears must be very sensitive. The sounds the probe is picking up range from our subsonic to ultrasonic.”\n\nHe touched the controls again. A different nautiloid Europan appeared. When it got just where he wanted it, he froze it on the screen. As if he were a football commentator, he drew an arrow pointing to what it held in its tentacles. “This is unmistakably a stone tool. There can be no doubt that we’re dealing with another intelligent species here. And the tool is remarkable for a couple of reasons.”\n\nHeydari held up one finger. “As far as we can tell, Europa’s outer crust is almost entirely ice. That’s what lets it float on the ocean below. I’m not saying there are no rocks in the ice, but they’d be rare. We spotted several Europans with shaped stones. If they don’t come from the crust, where do they come from?”\n\n“The sea bottom?” somebody suggested.\n\nThe professor nodded and held up another finger. “It seems likely. But Europa’s ocean is anywhere from sixty to a hundred fifty kilometers—okay, forty to a hundred miles—deep. It gets twenty times as deep as the Mariana Trench, in other words. The pressure down there would be over twenty-two thousand five hundred kilograms per square centimeter—before you ask, that’s about three hundred twenty thousand pounds per square inch. All the same, there’s presumably commerce between whatever creatures live on the bottom and the nautiloids we’re seeing up near the top of the ocean.”\n\nBefore anybody could ask him why he didn’t think the nautiloids also lived near the bottom, he went on to explain: “I have trouble imagining how creatures evolved to fit conditions near the crust would be able to withstand the enormous water pressure so much farther down. The ecology of the Europan ocean must be fascinating.”\n\nThen a woman asked the question he’d been expecting and dreading at the same time: “Why wasn’t the cable powering the affected devices positioned inside the main tube so one of those creatures couldn’t bite through it?”\n\n“For one thing, we didn’t really have room to put it in there,” Heydari answered. “For another, we didn’t really expect Europans, either. We hoped we’d find life. That seemed reasonable. The conditions down there are right. But this—” He shook his head. “Believe me, I’m as gobsmacked as you are.”\n\n“What do we do now?” Three people said the same thing at the same time. Well, it was the next obvious question.\n\n“We keep recording the sounds the Europans are making, recording and analyzing them. We keep doing that unless they break the other external cable, anyhow. If they do . . . ” Heydari shrugged.\n\n“When do we send a new probe?” That one also got chorused.\n\nAll he could do was shrug again and spread his hands. “I hope we go back. But it won’t be right away if we do. We have to get an appropriation to build the probe. With the video and audio we have, I think we can do that. I hope we can. Then we’ve got to design it and fabricate it. We have to wait for the right time to launch it. And we have to wait years while it travels from Earth to Europa. Then . . . Then we see what happens.”\n\nI’ll be middle-aged by then, he thought. He wondered whether any of the Europans who’d attacked Sarpedon’s camera would still be alive when the new probe drilled through the ice toward their ocean home. If they were, he suspected they wouldn’t have to jump through so many hoops to meet it as he and his fellow scientists would in creating it.\n\nFor their sake, he hoped not."
