        "text": "Two Complete Novels in the Popular Videssos Series.\n\nThe Stolen Throne\n\nThe fragile peace between the Empire of Videssos and the nation of Makuran had shattered. War came, and the King of Makuran lay dead on the field of battle. Worse, a power-mad minister had seized the throne and the rightful heir had disappeared.\n\nAbivard, son of a Makuran lord who also had fallen in the same battle, realized that his only hope of saving his family and his land was to find the missing heir, though that would mean he would be branded traitor and become the target of every armed man who served the usurper—and of his nation's most powerful sorcerers.\n\nAbrivard's only hope lay in the form of a perplexing prophecy of a field, a hill, and a shield shining across the sea. If the prophecy was true, it might lead him to the rightful ruler of Makuran—but first, he would have to survive long enough to solve its riddle.\n\nHammer and Anvil\n\nThe once-mighty Empire of Videssos had a despot on its throne, the pretender Genesios who enjoyed the opulent wealth at his command while barbarian attackers and invading enemies ravaged Videssos' borders. Some wondered if Videssos would even exist before many more years had passed.\n\nNone within the empire dared oppose Genesios, but young Maniakes, exiled with his father to a faraway island, raised a military force and set out to liberate his homeland. The forces against him were formidable, he faced Videssos' external foes as well as the legions of the tyrant, and a former friend would prove to be his most dangerous enemy.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nHugo-winner, New York Times best-selling author, and historian—Harry Turtledove is equally renowned in science fiction for his rigorously thought-out alternate history novels and in fantasy for his tales of the supernatural placed in historically accurate settings. For Baen, he has written the alternate American Civil War fantasy trilogy comprising Sentry Peak, Marching Through Peachtree, and Advance and Retreat, as well as The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump, and the popular \"Gerin the Fox\" series, Wisdom of the Fox and Tale of the Fox. He has also written the Ingram bestseller Guns of the South and the genre bestsellers in the \"Worldwar\" series for Del Rey.\n\nTwo Complete Novels in the Popular Videssos Series.\n\nThe Stolen Throne\n\nThe fragile peace between the Empire of Videssos and the nation of Makuran had shattered.
