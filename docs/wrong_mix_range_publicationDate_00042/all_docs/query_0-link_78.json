This fascinates Sostratos, who wants to learn as much as he can about the strange monotheists living there. The more worldly Menedemos looks toward more common pleasures, particularly those involving pretty women (not letting small inconveniences like their marriage to other men get in the way). But, as always, trouble follows them. From cargo they canâ€™t sell to bandits and thugs waiting to jump them, they must once again use their quick wits to survive and, hopefully, make a profit from their long journey.\n\nDownload and start listening now!"
