        "text": "July 11, 2012\n\nBefore Harry Turtledove became obsessed with writing - and rewriting- alternative versions of the Second World War, he was a notable scholar of Byzantine history, which led him to write the Videssos series, and entertaining saga that turns away from the usual Northern Europeans-folklore influences of Tolkien and company towards a world based very closely on the Byzantine Empire. In fact, aside from the presence of magic and a few cosmetic changes, it could very much stand in for a straight-forward alternative history in which Constantinople never feel to the Turks. Which is in fact the subject of another book he wrote...but one thing at a time.\n\nThe premise behind the series goes like this: a Roman legion led by the tribune Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, fighting during Caesar's conquest of Gaul, gets transported to an alternative world due to a mishap with a pair of swords enchanted by a powerful druid (coming along for the ride is a Gallic chieftain who was fighting on the other side...) Unable to return home, they hire on as mercenaries to the Byzantium-like Empire of Videssos. The idea of a Roman legion hiring on to serve a fantasy version of the Empire that would ultimately succeed their Empire might seem a bit ludicrous, but Turtledove makes it work with strong characters and a detailed and highly realistic setting.\n\nReligion plays a strong role here, and in this Turtledove;s historical background shows itself strongly. The primary religion is a thinly disguised version of medieval Orthodox Christianity, which like the real-world version is beset by various heresies and schisms. The primary villain is Avshar, a former Videssian priest who switches to the worship of Skotos, the Videssian version of the Devil. A generation before the Roman legions arrival, he facilitated the conquest of a neighboring Empire, leading a nomadic horde from the steppe to overthrow the previous rulers, mirroring in many respects the Mongol conquest of Persia. The series slowly builds up over the course of several books, depicting both the external battles and internal intrigues that best the real-world Byzantine Empire, leading to the expected confrontation between light and dark.\n\nThe premise is somewhat outlandish, but the series is solid, a real and pleasant alternative to the the usual elf-and-orc style of fantasy. A good read all around.\n\nMay 15, 2019\n\nIl ciclo di Videssos si apre con questo ottimo volume introduttivo, convincente e coinvolgente che risulta però, a mio parere, un po' troppo introduttivo. Per il lettore è un lungo inserimento nel mondo di Videssos, con i suoi usi e costumi e quant'altro, che si rivela interessante (mai noioso) ma eccessivamente lento e scarno di eventi...dove per vedere un climax degno di questo nome bisogna attendere 30pg dalla fine.\n\nResta un inizio solido e ricco di personaggi a cui ci si affeziona facilmente...speriamo che il ritmo acceleri con il secondo capitolo.\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\nIf you like the \"displaced person in another world\" stories then this is the series for you. Now we get an entire legion of roman soldiers, oh and one crazed Celt, on another world. Throw in that magic works there and you have a fantastic story and some awesome characters. Turtledove is one of my top 5 favorite writers. My highest recommendation.\n\nFebruary 27, 2012\n\nHarry Turtledove must generate a ton of interesting ideas for historical/alternate history books. But then he turns into a writing machine and takes that idea and generates three or four or eight books in a series following on.\n\nLike many of his books, this one begins where it departs from real history. A Roman legion fights the Celts in Gaul, and is magically transported (with a token Scotsman) to another world. It isn't really alternate history, because their disappearance causes nary a ripple in the world they left. This is the story of what happens when they get there.\n\nThe world in which they arrive is essentially magical Byzantium, I think. An empire defended by mercenaries, run by functionaries, with high turnover in emperors. The Romans tromp in with their discipline and heavy infantry tactics and secure a place for themselves, and I would guess that by the end of the series, they will probably have secured the throne for their leader, who wanted to be a politician back home. I'm definitely going to check out the rest of the series.\n\nFebruary 18, 2016\n\nThis is a novel about a group of Roman soldiers mystically transported to a fantasy world; nitpicking its historical accuracy is, obviously, as pointless as it is irresistible. Here goes:\n\n1. On p. 148: \"The Roman knew how easy it was to judge a man by the company he kept. Caesar himself, in his younger days, had fallen into danger through his association with Marius' defeated faction.\" This makes it sound like Marius was the leader of a motorcycle gang, and poor naive Caesar fell in with the wrong crowd by accident. In fact, \"Marius' faction\" basically meant the populist cause in Roman politics, and Caesar played up his family connections to Marius as part of a deliberate political strategy.\n\n2. On p. 173: \"Coming from Rome, whose history was little more than legend even three centuries before his own time, Marcus had never quite gotten over the awe Videssos' long past raised in him.\" If he'd said \"four centuries,\" I might have let this pass. But the mid-fourth century (Marcus was fighting under Caesar in Gaul) is the time of Rome's conflicts with the Latin League and the Samnites; even for us, this is solidly historical (if somewhat blurry) material, and Marcus would have had access to all sorts of literary and documentary sources that have since been lost.\n\n3. I understand that it's hard to come up with plausible-sounding words in a fictional language, and it's a perfectly acceptable choice to model that fictional language on a real one. But when most of your main characters come from ancient Rome, and one comes from Greece, the mysterious, incomprehensible language they encounter in a magical alternate universe should not, for God's sake, be obviously based on Greek. It is immensely distracting (at least to me) to have these characters acting utterly confused when they hear that the gods of light and darkness are named \"Phos\" and \"Skotos,\" the chief official of a city is the \"hypasteos,\" the emperor is called \"Avtokrator,\" and so on.\n\n4. The choice to represent the speech of the one Gaulish character as Irish-accented English is exactly as irritating as you would imagine.\n\nAugust 12, 2019\n\nA Roman legion finds itself transported to a fantasy world? What's not to like? The writing here is solid along with the plotting, and the characters are interesting. If I have any real criticism, it's that the fantasy world introduced here would be too familiar to the Romans, in my opinion, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, for it makes a great action and drama, but something a little more out there might have been interesting ... that being said, that's not this book, which is military action driven, and that's what I was looking for, so it's fine. If you enjoy military fantasy, you'll like this book.\n\nNovember 11, 2013\n\nI started with a different series of Turtledove's and have read pretty much everything that he has written. This is one of the best series that I have ever read. The character development is solid and they continue to evolve over the course of the series. Turtledove has a PH D in Byzantine history and he used it to good effect over this and other series. I can't say enough good things about his writing.\n\nSeptember 24, 2013\n\nThe Misplaced Legion is an excellent book that starts off the Videssos Cycle series. Marcus Scaurus is a Roman tribune who bears a Gaulic sword taken from a slain druid. As he leads his troops through Gaul he encounters an ambush, led by the chieftain Viridovix. The Romans are superior in their tactics but the shear numbers and ferocity of the enemy causes them to slowly lose ground. Finally, it comes to the point where Viridovix challenges Marcus to a duel. Marcus, in a futile attempt to save his mens' lives, accepts and Viridovix comes into the midst of the Roman ring to duel him. Unknown to either of them, they have a matching set of swords. Druidic swords, engraved with runes and filled with magic. As the two swords draw near they begin to glow and, as they crash together there is a flash. Marcus, Viridovix, and all the legionaries disappear from the face of the Earth. But they are not dead. They are transported to the lands of Videssos, a strange world containing magic.\n\nMarcus soon finds that the world of Videssos is a strange one compared to the Rome he called home. Wizards and monks wield powerful magics and the land is ruled by an Emperor, unlike the Republican country Scaurus and his men hail from. Along with Viridovix, Marcus and his men soon become entangled with the very intricate politics of Videssos, forced to mercenary lives to survive. As the politics continue, the world continues on until war is called on the evil Yezda hordes, led by a dark wizard of extreme power. Led by the emperor of Videssos, the Roman legion along with the combined mercenary armies of Videssos and its allies march on Yezda. However, as the final battle comes, an inexperienced general causes a organized retreat into a rout and the Videssians are routed, the emperor killed. Only the strict discipline of the Romans saves them and some of their allies lives as they retreat from the Yezda. The battle has been lost but not the war, though to see how it continues you would have to read book 2.\n\nPersonally, I loved the book. A combination of fantasy and historical fiction that I had never before seen were used by Turtledove in its writing and I loved every second of the read. While I wouldn't call it the best book I have ever read or the best story, I still think it deserves recognition as a well written piece. Ranking high above many of the books I've read through my life the Misplaced Legion has a spot on my shelf that it will keep for many years. I'm sure I am not the only person to have read the book that feels this way.\n\nAs my opinion of the book probably shows, I would definitely recommend this book to others. However, not all others. Lovers of fantasy will enjoy this twist on the traditional form of the genre and fans of historical fiction will find this piece a enjoyable read. For those who love both genres such as I do, this book is sure to be an excellent read that you'll want to keep reading until you've gone cover to cover.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 10, 2014\n\nOriginally read this at the age of 13, but I'm not sure I completed it -- my memories beyond the halfway point are curiously blank. A fairly entertaining read some 25 years later, particularly as Turtledove employs a decent prose style -- superior, at least, to the bog-standard of late 80's fantasy.\n\n3 stars, due to various anachronisms that for some reason bothered me; a cliched resolution to the main character's sexual angst in regards to his female counterpoint; his general Gary Stu persona (of course he's a Stoic); and the underlying demonization (literally) of a steppe/muslim culture, recalling Western Lens anxiety over the Seljuk Turks. Still, the fantasy-template depictions thinly slavered over mid-period Byzantium are interesting and, in several places (like the depiction of the Hagia Sophia as translated as a heliocentric shrine), inspired.\n\nJuly 5, 2010\n\nMy first Turtledove book, one that began a long relationship. While I've read everything he has written, more or less, and he's gone on to become a multi-award winning writer and NYT bestseller, I still point to these books as his best. plot-wise its rips off some things from Lord of the Rings, with a Byzantine setting and magic for good measure, but the battle scenes are excellent and the characters are well written, with very real human failures and drives. The final battle scene in book 4 kept me up late and made my pulse pound. Turtledove wrote other series to flesh out the world, including one detailing the fall and rise of the demonic villain Avshar, which are good, but again, this series is his best.\n\nNovember 22, 2014\n\nNormally this would sound like exactly the sort of book I'd love. A Roman legion transported to another world. Sounds great right? How does Harry Turtledove destroy that? By making it incredibly dull and boring. Even in the midst of an assassin attacking I struggle not to fall asleep.\n\nThe worst thing about the book was the setting. He could have transported the legion to anywhere, but instead it was too a location so very like the one they came from, albeit with a little bit of magic thrown in. Maybe further down the line things might change but it was all just too easy.\n\nI think I'm done with trying Turtledove's work. Each time I've tried I've been disappointed.\n\nMarch 18, 2013\n\nIn my opinion, Turtledove's best book. The series itself grows a little thin by the end and seems strung out, but this first book is simply amazing. Any fan of ancient Roman legions and their way of waging war will be enamored by this book. Their staunch professionalism, adherence to discipline and methodical fighting style created the finest fighting force in all of history bar none, and reading about them kicking ass in a land that has never even heard the word Rome is simply amazing. As the history nerd that I am (and totally biased lover of Rome), I was grinning throughout.\n\nJanuary 21, 2015\n\nThree cohorts and a single Gaul are transported to an early Renaissance world where magic is real (but not common). Much of the story delves into the politics of this new world, and of the newly come Roman Tribune's navigation through them. An excellent beginning to the Videssos Cycle that ends nicely.\n\nJanuary 20, 2017\n\nA nice story about a legion that is transported through time and space (nobody knows to). There they will join an empire as mercenaries and will fight for the emperor against a common enemy (sword and sorcery is what you'll read).\n\nThe book ends leaving what the reader is expecting for another book (or books as there's 4 books in the series).\n\nJuly 12, 2017\n\nI chiefly picked this novel up because the concept sounded familiar enough after having read Jim Butcher's Codex Alera novels that I expected I could dive in and enjoy myself with little real trouble. And so it was during the early pages. I found Marcus and Viridovix's characters appealing. Soon after arrival within the new world however I began to find myself less interested. The religion built into Videssos and this world as a whole is nothing complex and I dare say the standard fair for such fantasy, so the story aspects built up around it are fine for a driving point of several factors, but I still find it incredibly stupid how the riot developed later on, and that our chief protagonist should then stumble upon the one woman who holds his love interest is all the more ridiculous.\n\nIt does seem as though the Romans grasped the native tongue with far too much ease early on, too, though I suppose that is a necessity to advance the story.\n\nI was not expecting for the novel to conclude as it did. Somehow, yet again, the Romans have managed to endure this vast skirmish without I believe losing a single man to their name directly. Many of their new comrades were felled, but not one Roman.\n\nI was anticipating for Marcus and Avshar to meet in combat, and if I may be frank, for the latter to then die and the Yzeld to be routed and the Emperor go on ruling and yadda yadda, so handing them a defeat due to Av's sorcery and the weakness of Ort... whatever the kid's name was in charge of the left flank, leading to the Emperor's death, was kind of a welcome change. Of course now I cannot help but wonder about Thorisin's survival odds and if this will somehow snowball into Marcus assuming the throne later in the series.\n\nRegardless, and aside from the many spelling mistakes peppered throughout the pages, reading this novel became a chore. I'm just not very pleased with it. I sat down and powered through the last seventy-odd pages this morning after making it through fifty-something yesterday evening, and I now feel as though a weight is off of my mind. I do not think I will seek out the following novels, or at least not this year. I have quite a few other options available that will likely be more satisfying.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 24, 2023\n\nQuesto libro mi è sicuramente piaciuto, ma non posso dire di aver avuto lo stesso trasporto che mi ha preso con altri autori coevi come Gemmell.\n\nMolto interessante lo spunto di base, che mescola il fantasy alla storia romana. Se da un lato il genere Alternate Time Space Continuum è ben noto in fantasy e fantascienza, il collegamento storico lo rende piuttosto originale. E sicuramente si percepisce che l'autore è un fine conoscitore di storia romana.\n\nIl modo in cui è congegnato l'impero di Videssos, poi, pone un'originale contraddizione: il romano repubblicano, quindi nell'età dell'oro della storia romana, che si trova catapultato in un mondo che è modellato il tardo impero romano, quindi nel pieno della sua decadenza, con le sue lotte politiche, il peso dei barbari, e gli intrighi tra fazioni.\n\nIl punto un po' debole è la storia, non perché non sia interessante, ma perché è lenta a partire. D'altronde questo è chiaramente voluto: da come si conclude il libro, è palese che questo è progettato per essere l'inizio di un'opera più estesa. Tuttavia, pur lungi dall'essere noioso, a tratti viene voglia di capire quand'è che la storia entra nel vivo (cosa che fa solo sul finale).\n\nDi nuovo, è innegabile che sia voluto, e che l'autore faccia iniziare la campagna militare solo molto avanti nel libro, in quanto vuole mostrare le difficoltà di Scaurus nell'ambientarsi in un mondo per certi versi simile al suo ma dove non riesce a riconoscersi.\n\nIl libro è altresì un po' confusionario. Vengono menzionati dei personaggi che riappaiono magari duecento pagine più avanti, senza un minimo di contestualizzazione, e questo costringe il lettore ad andare indietro a cercare di chi si trattasse.\n\nCi sono anche problemi di traduzione, in particolare la traduzione letterale di alcuni idiomi in inglese il cui equivalente italiano non si ottiene affatto con una traduzione letterale, ma credo che questo si possa imputare ad un'epoca un cui il livello di inglese, anche dei traduttori, era diverso da quello odierno.\n\nIn ogni caso mi riservo la lettura dei seguiti per esprimere un giudizio più compito.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nA solid portal fantasy (I think it'd be classified that way) with lots of excellent research and knowledge behind it. Four stars.\n\nIt's better than \"pretty okay,\" which is what a 3-star book is, but it's a slightly optimistic 4 coming from me. I'm rooting for the book and series, TBH. It's not as exciting through the middle section as I would like, though it's still interesting, and it doesn't have a true ending, which I would much prefer, and those things make it a little less fun for me. It's not precisely a cliffhanger (IMO, I mean, though I admit I quibble) because the book ends at a natural break in the story, a chapter end anyway, where there's a slight pause in the action, but the next book in the series will find our heroes in a tough spot and have to start on the following day for sure. They have their backs up against a cliff, let's say, thought aren't hanging from it...\n\nSee, I quibble.\n\nBut I like the characters and the premise and the setting and I suspect the second novel will be able to get going with less throat-clearing and world-building. I hope.\n\nThe premise is that a whole Roman legion finds itself in a new world (after magic accidentally happens) and they have to learn how to survive there. It is a world that looks a lot like a later Byzantine empire does in our world, with nations that resemble Normans and Vikings and Greeks, though there's lots of magic and other elements unique to that place. The Romans are special here because they have a system of discipline that isn't matched in Videssos, though the author doesn't play that up too too much. In fact, the biggest disappointment in the novel is waiting for the Romans to be awesome, to make a big difference, and though they have a few small successes in that line, they don't kick ass the way I hoped. I think, I imagine, I expect we'll see that in different ways in the sequels.\n\nI like Harry Turtledove and think he's very creative and skillful, so I'm hoping he comes through in the rest of the books. Swords crossed.\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nWas in the mood for something lightweight, so Needed something lightweight after reading Lincoln, so picked up one of my old books: Harry Turtledove's **The Misplaced Legion** (well actually 4, as this is book 1 in the Videssos Cycle). This is pure comfort food; these books are probably among the most read in my collection (I've read them quite a few times, and friends I've lent them to have read them more than once).\n\nThe Legion is a classic \"fish out of water\" story; a Roman detachment in Gaul gets magically transported to Videssos aka Magical Byzantium in the time of Anna Komnenos, complete with Varangians, Norman Dukes, Seljuq Turks, and Mongols. Into this mix march the Romans, with their hobnailed caligae and heavy infantry tactics.\n\nTurtledove is a good but not a great writer; his characters, inevitably, often end up sounding very similar and there is always a stoic hero (in case you're wondering who the self-insert is). He is pretty great as a writer of alternate history, though. Sadly, at some point during his career, he took a turn toward writing in multiple POV, which - IMO - does not play to his strengths. The Videssos Cycle, fortunately, sticks to a few POVs, primarily that of the Roman tribune Marcus Scaurus. And it is about a historical period that Turtledove knows exceedingly well (having a Ph.D. in Byzantine History). The combination of fantasy and historical fiction is a rare combination, and even more rarely done this well.\n\nThe books have their weaknesses, and the plot starts to feel a bit stretched in the last two parts, as Turtledove takes us on a whirlwind tour of the Videssian world before the final cataclysmic battle between good and evil. But it's a trip I still enjoy, even 30 years after I first set eyes upon these books. IMO, Turtledove's best work.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nReview written January, 2000\n\nWell, this is the first book I've read by Turtledove, and it seems to me that it has some promise. This is the first in a series called the Videssos Cycle, and I'm hoping that as I continue to read through the cycle, things will continue to improve. If not, I'll let you know.\n\nThe book begins with a legion of Roman soldiers who have invaded Gaul being sucked into some sort of interdimensional portal because of the clash of two druidic swords weilded by their leader and the leader of the Gauls. They arrive in the land of Videssos, where magic works, and the Videssians are involved in a titanic conflict with the barbarians who worship the evil god of darkness and cold - while they, of course, worship the god of light and warmth.\n\nThe empire of Videssos has some wonderfully scheming courtiers and bureaucrats, and while the Romans rapidly hire on as mercenaries for the current emperor, it's not automatically apparent that they've made the right choice. Turtledove has chosen to use some Greek-sounding names for most of the Videssians, and sometimes it's a little tough identifying the players without a scorecard, but the plotting keeps things interesting during the first two-thirds of the book, which would otherwise be seriously lacking in action.\n\nWe really don't get a taste of battle till the very end of this novel, but I've got to assume there's a lot more in store in the rest of the series. Turtledove seems to shy away from graphic depictions of either violence or sex, so these books make the \"G\" rating for younger readers.\n\nBottom line - not awesome, but amusing, so if you can pick up a copy at the used bookstore, it'd probably be best for all concerned.\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\n(FYI I tend to only review one book per series, unless I want to change my scoring by 0.50 or more of a star. -- I tend not to read reviews until after I read a book, so I go in with an open mind.)\n\nI'm finally going through my physical library owned book list, to add more older basic reviews. If I liked a book enough to keep then they are at the least a 3 star.\n\nI'm only adding one book per author and I'm not going to re-read every book to be more accurate, not when I have 1000s of new to me authors to try (I can't say no to free books....)\n\nFirst time read the author's work?: Yes\n\nWill you be reading more?: Yes\n\nWould you recommend?: Yes\n\n------------\n\nHow I rate Stars: 5* = I loved (must read all I can find by the author)\n\n4* = I really enjoyed (got to read all the series and try other books by the author).\n\n3* = I enjoyed (I will continue to read the series)\n\nor\n\n3* = Good book just not my thing (I realised I don't like the genre or picked up a kids book to review in error.)\n\nAll of the above scores means I would recommend them!\n\n-\n\n2* = it was okay (I might give the next book in the series a try, to see if that was better IMHO.)\n\n1* = Disliked\n\nNote: adding these basic 'reviews' after finding out that some people see the stars differently than I do - hoping this clarifies how I feel about the book. :-)\n\nJuly 21, 2023\n\nThe premise of The Misplaced Legion is pretty interesting - what if a Late Republican Roman legion was transported to the Eastern Roman Empire in the lead up to the Battle of Manzikert in 1071? How might things have gone differently? Turns out, it plays out pretty much exactly the same. This is almost exactly a 1 to 1 retelling of the Battle of Manzikert, with Mavrikios Gavras playing the part of Romanos IV Diogenes and Ortaias Sphrantzes playing Andronikos Doukas. He doesn't even bother changing the name of certain locations, such as the town of Khliat.\n\nThe protagonist is unremarkable and yet also a Gary Stu, with his every decision, word, and action turning out to be the right one. I'll echo a previous reviewer when I feel that his demonizing depiction of the nomadic invaders, clearly a stand in for the Muslim Seljuk Turks, is kind of uncomfortable, given the novel's close proximity to actual history. It wouldn't be out of place in a fantasy novel, but when the comparison is so clear, it comes off oddly. We'll see how far into this series I get, but if it keeps skewing this close to actual history, the main appeal kind of wears off.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nAs I continue down the path of reading the books that have been sitting on my shelves for years, this was a great one to visit again. There is a significant fantasy aspect to this book as it relates a different world and there is magic engaged, but the heart of the story is historical fiction with the Roman Legion front and center.\n\nThe material is clearly well investigated as the detailed descriptions of armaments, styles, training routines, military order, etc. paint a very graphic picture of life in the time period. Add in some good ol' fashioned love triangles, gory battle scenes with swords, pikes, and heavy cavalry and you have a novel!\n\nIf you're looking for something different that doesn't rely on elves, dwarves, or dragons, I highly recommend this series!\n\nJuly 25, 2018\n\nThis is a typical later 20th century military fantasy in many ways, with very few women, who play strictly supporting roles. I enjoyed it still, although the subject made it slow-going for me at times. The author’s book is that the Romans, and one Celt, find themselves suddenly transported (via the clashing of magical Celtic swords) from Caesar’s Gallic campaign to a completely different (and magical) world where the king of the country they land in needs mercenaries. The ending was a surprise.\n\nJune 17, 2023\n\nI loved the World War series which I read a decade or so ago. At that time, I ordered most of Turtledove's books. This series, to me, doesn't seem to have the magic of that other series. Or perhaps it is the magic in this book (as opposed to the aliens in the World War series) that I dislike. I have the other 3 books in front of me and I'll probably read them--a change of pace from always reading poetry. I am disappointed in that I was hoping for spectacular. But then that's what we all wish for with every book we open.\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nI enjoy Harry Turtledove books as his What Ifery appeals to me. This was s bit clunkier in style than usual but that’s understandable as this is one of his earlier books. As an Irishman and Celt I found the way of speaking of the Gaulish Celt annoying. Sometimes the vocabulary made him sound Irish or Welsh or Scots and occasionally like a village idiot. But that is me bring nit picking. I enjoyed this and would recommend it. The ending was a surprise as well.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nIl libro mi è piaciuto, i personaggi sono ben scritti e oguno ha il suo carattere, il worldbuilding è molto coerente e in generale credibile. L’uso della magia solo abbozzato. Mi lascia più perplesso (e da qui le 4 stelle) il finale moooooolto discutibile (ok che c’è la parte 2 ma inzommma…). Mi perplime molto il fatto che nessun romano abbia mai fatto cenno a voler imparare i trucchi magici e che in generale un gruppo del genere si integri cosi bene da subito con tutti.\n\nMay 10, 2020\n\nIt's a tough read because there are so many different characters with bizarre names that you need to keep track of. Plus the English is a little bit different then what I'm used to. I'm currently on page 131 and just starting to get the hang of the authors writing style. Overall the story line has been exciting so far though which is why I'm giving it four stars for the moment.\n\nAugust 18, 2020\n\nThis book started awesome, but the number of characters and the similarity of their names made keeping track impossible. I enjoyed the travelog experience of a new culture. I also thought Maurus was too passive, and that the plot wasn't advancing. The character of the Gaul also felt pointless in the story. For those with patience and good memory this could be interesting.\n\n2.5/5\n\nDnf 29%"
