        "text": "Metatron, The Speaker of God is a supporting character in Hazbin Hotel: Journey to the Light.\n\nHe serves as a mentioned character in Chapter 1, and a major character in Chapter 5.\n\nHe is a dramatic and loud-mouthed Thrones angel, God's official spokesperson, occasional avatar, an ambassador of Heaven, and Corey and Peel's sworn rival.\n\nMetatron is tasked with communicating God's will and message to worlds below the Almighty, and is responsible for maintaining the relationship between God and His people. He has the authority to make official pronouncements on God's behalf, and is considered a direct instrument of God's will and authority. He is the third most powerful and influential being in Heaven's hierarchy, behind Seraphiel and God Himself. His words are considered holy and infallible, and he carries an immense burden of responsibility at all times.\n\nBiography\n\nEvents of Hazbin Hotel: Journey to the Light\n\nChapter 5\n\nIn \"So, You Wanted to Redeem a Sinner?\", Sera arranges a meeting between Charlie and Metatron, the Speaker of God in the Embassy of Heaven. With Corey and Peel and Squish, by her side, Charlie enters the embassy with the Seraphim Sisters, where they await the Speaker of God's arrival.\n\nAs Corey and Peel chew Metatron out for showing up late, glorious trumpet music blares throughout the embassy, startling Corey and Peel so much that they jump into Charlie's arms, and signaling the entrance of Metatron. Sera looks around expectedly, Serenity and Charlie look around in anticipation, and Corey and Peel squint their eyes, as if they're gearing up to fight the final boss. Metatron stylishly emerges from a protective pentagram sigil on the ground, accompanied by a choir of angels with musical instruments.\n\nIn a dazzling musical number, Metatron addresses the group, slyly suggesting that they have come to him seeking redemption for sinners. He exudes confidence, wrapping an arm around Charlie and suggesting that he is the right person for the job. He playfully teases Charlie and her friends, acknowledging the looks of awe on their faces. Metatron's demeanor is powerful and electrifying, as he leans his arm on Corey's head before he taps the apple angel on the head, jolting him with golden lightning. Taking Charlie by the hand, Metatron suddenly conjures a portal and flies with her through the cosmos, showcasing his seemingly magical abilities. They soar through the cosmos, experiencing the rawness of fire and the exhilaration of being elevated to a higher plane. During this Metatron sings the importance of keeping one's eyes wide open to fully experience the magic. Returning to the embassy, Metatron stands confidently with his choir, reiterating the theme of redemption for sinners as the music comes to a crescendo and ends.\n\nAfter Metatron's performance, Charlie introduces herself and her friends, but the exchange is quickly interrupted by Corey and Peel, who claim familiarity with Metatron, and reveal that they have beef with the Speaker of God. Tension arises between Metatron, representing Heaven, and Corey and Peel, representatives of Hell, leading to a heated exchange of insults. Metatron undermines Corey and Peel while they accuse him of incompetence. Sera intervenes, diffusing the tension, and requests Metatron to sit down while asking Charlie to present her evidence of redemption.\n\nAs the debate ensues, Charlie moves into a passionate speech about the origins of the Hazbin Hotel, highlighting the burdens and rewards it brought her, particularly the opportunity to connect with numerous remarkable sinners. Serenity is deeply moved by Charlie's words, but Metatron shows little interest, abruptly cutting off the speech and urging Charlie to cut to the chase, citing time constraints. Hastily, Charlie presents her evidence, as the embassy's crystal balls vividly depict the hotel crew's myriad acts of kindness and heroism: from Fergus rescuing Angel Dust, to the team's efforts in saving the Cambions and Manco, and even Ren's selfless sacrifice, alongside various displays of their camaraderie, community service, and friendship. Serenity emphasizes to Metatron that the embassy's crystal balls provide undeniable evidence of their deeds, something which Corey and Peel shout across the embassy to taunt Metatron. Sera quietly reminds Serenity to remain a neutral party until a verdict is reached.\n\nIn a dramatic turn, Charlie unveils her smoking gun, summoning Lux, the Holy Spirit, into the embassy, to Metatron's astonishment. Lux expresses its unwavering belief in the potential for sinners' redemption. A poignant musical duet ensues between Lux and Charlie, celebrating their shared accomplishments and honoring those they've lost. Despite the heartfelt performance and overwhelming evidence, Metatron delivers a sobering declaration: he cannot permit sinners entry into Heaven. The pronouncement deeply troubles Charlie, Lux, Corey, Peel, and Serenity, leaving them profoundly disappointed and disheartened.\n\nMetatron launches into his own song, again emphasizing his divine authority and control over Heaven's affairs. He confronts Charlie, questioning the validity of redemption for the sinners of Hell, suggesting that if it were truly possible, they would already reside among Heaven's righteous. However, Corey and Peel interject at Metatron. The entire debate somehow turns into Metatron vs. Corey and Peel as their petty beef takes center stage, with Corey and Peel hurling childish insults at Metatron and highlighting their loyalty to Charlie. As the two harbingers of Heaven and Hell beef with each other, Metatron continues to deride Corey and Peel, exposing Lucifer's lack of faith in them, and insinuating that Charlie's acceptance of them stemmed from pity rather than any merit they really have. In retaliation, Corey and Peel challenge Metatron's leadership, inquiring what God would think of the current state of Heaven, prompting a momentary halt in the musical number as Metatron struggles to respond, eventually attempting to steer focus back to his awe-inspiring powers.\n\nAs the pressure mounts, Metatron finds himself facing significant opposition from Serenity, Charlie, Corey, and Peel. With Corey and Peel smugly observing, Serenity voices her frustration, accusing Metatron of willfully ignoring evidence. Charlie and Lux joins in, asserting that Metatron's reluctance to accept sinners into Heaven reflects an inherent bias against them, regardless of their virtue. Finally, Metatron's composure crumbles as he discloses a startling bombshell that reverberates through the embassy: he hasn't communicated with God in centuries. This revelation stuns everyone into silence, laying bare the uncertainty and disillusionment at the core of Metatron's authority.\n\nThe embassy falls into a stunned silence as Serenity and Sera, who had faithfully followed Metatron's orders for decades, grapple with the shocking revelation. Serenity, in particular, confronts Metatron, demanding an explanation for how he could have lost contact with God Himself. Metatron somberly reveals the painful truth: when God departed from Heaven, Metatron lost all contact with Him. Despite this, he chose to fabricate messages of purportedly from the Heavenly Father to preserve morale and uphold the status quo of order within Heaven. The revelation leaves everyone reeling with devastation, except for Corey and Peel, who take childish and malicious delight in having their suspicions confirmed, hugging each other and leaping for joy, flipping off Metatron as they relish in his exposed deception.\n\nPersonality\n\nMetatron presents himself with grandiosity and charisma, emphasizing his position as the Speaker of God and showcasing his power to bestow saintliness, as well as his ability to change Heaven's order with mere words. He takes his position as Speaker of God very seriously, and is a powerful, majestic, yet unintentionally comedic individual. He speaks in a \"snotty rich dude\" accent and is extremely passionate and dramatic in his speech, prone to dramatic mannerisms, often punctuating his declarations with \"BEHOLD!\" and \"SILENCE!\" commands. He trembles and convulses with reverence of the Morningstar family and Asherah, with a penchant for highlighting his inferiority in the presence of his superiors. Metatron's voice reverberates with authority, punctuating his sentences with booming commands that echo through the heavens. Even when discussing the most mundane topics, like unveiling new flavors of Heaven ice cream, he exudes an unparalleled gravitas that demands attention.\n\nHe exudes an air of superiority and is not above belittling others, especially Corey and Peel, readily engaging into petty squabbles with the two apple servants. Despite the secret he holds, he has a strong sense of confidence in his role and his ability to maintain the status quo.\n\nDespite his outward confidence, Metatron is secretly insecure, stressed, and deceitful; in reality, he has not communicated with God in centuries, admitting to fabricating messages to uphold the illusion of divine authority. Though this hints at his fear of losing control, he also highlights that this was to keep the denizens of Heaven from becoming disillusioned and demoralized, suggesting that he does truly value Heaven's people.\n\nDuring his meeting with Charlie and the Seraphim sisters, Metatron showed a reluctance to accept sinners into Heaven, at first hinting at a bias towards them, regardless of any evidence of redemption presented. He dismisses Charlie's passionate speech and the evidence provided, indicating a deep-seated disdain for those deemed unworthy in his eyes. However, as it came to light that he has lost communication with God, his reluctance to accept redeemed sinners seems to moreso stem from an unwillingness to change Heaven's order in such a radical way without divine permission.\n\nAppearance\n\nMetatron is a Thrones Angel adorned in a pristine white cassock. He has onyx-colored skin and his head, lacking a a neck, comprises two resplendent golden wheels adorned with eyes encircling each ring. Within the heart of these rings blazes a sphere of divine fire, while four wings grace his back, each adorned with its own watchful eyes along their expanse.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nPowers\n\nDivine Power: As the divine messenger of God, the Speaker of God was created with immense, reality-altering divine magic that allows him to do nearly anything he wants and travel anywhere across the Universe. With his powers, he can bend and manipulate reality around him, as well as create and destroy almost anything he desires. He also has the power to erase and manipulate the souls of supernatural beings, including demons and angels, and wipe out or create entire dimensions.\n\nBiokinesis: The Speaker can manipulate biology on a molecular level. He is capable of crafting his own minions in the form of levitating, disembodied eyeballs.\n\nCreation: The Speaker is an extremely skilled master of creation magic, producing sentient creatures of his design, creating money, and constructing entire solar systems. He can also generate riches using his matter manipulation and creation magic, making currency of any kind practically worthless to him.\n\nClairvoyance: Metatron can summon magical images that allow him to see anywhere in the Universe, even across other dimensions.\n\nCloudwalking: Metatron is capable of standing and traveling on clouds. He is almost never seen actually walking, preferring to instead materialize small clouds and use them for transportation.\n\nDuplication: Metatron can create multiple, identical copies of himself.\n\nElectrokinesis: Metatron can produce golden lightning with a mere tap of his fingers.\n\nFlight: Metatron is capable of flying and hovering at up to lightspeed, shifting into a shooting star while traveling through the vacuum of space.\n\nInterstellar Travel: Metatron is capable of flying at speeds far beyond the speed of light, as shown in his musical number when he took Charlie on a brief joyride through the cosmos.\n\nImmortality: Metatron possesses an infinitely long lifespan and is eternally youthful, despite existing for likely millions of years.\n\nLife Manipulation: Metatron can create sentient beings of his design, entirely from scratch.\n\nPhotokinesis: Metatron has a habit of appearing abruptly in a flash of light through his teleportation, light so bright that the angels around him often shield their eyes in response.\n\nPortal Creation: Metatron can create portals to almost anywhere he wants in Creation, as shown by him conjuring and taking Charlie with him into a portal that lead deep into the cosmos.\n\nPyrokinesis: Metatron can summon, conjure, and manipulate holy flames.\n\nReality Warping: Metatron is capable of manipulating the environment around him, changing the forms, colors, and even the sensations around himself or other beings.\n\nTeleportation: Metatron can travel anywhere he wants in the Universe by instantly teleporting, often appearing in a flash of bright light with shooting stars coming out of it.\n\nTyphokinesis: Metatron can produce thick, white smoke through his teleportations, often causing those in close proximity around him to start coughing.\n\nAbilities\n\nAuthority: Thanks to his high position in Heaven, the Speaker is highly reputable figure, with even the king of the Serpaim family bowing in respect of him. He is one of the few entities in the entire Universe who is allowed to speak to God at all times, and has sway over all diplomats of Hell, such as Corey and Peel. He commands his own small army of eye angels which he can use to see through and entrap others.\n\nOmnilingualism: As a diplomat of Heaven, the Speaker can speak all languages, including angelic, demonic, human, and alien languages.\n\nRelationships\n\nAllies\n\nGod\n\nGod is the Speaker's master and creator. Metatron's description of God are filled with adoration and reverence, portraying Him as the epitome of holiness and goodness, beyond human and even angel comprehension. He emphasizes God's position as the Father of the Holy Trinity, the ultimate authority above Heaven.\n\nOthers\n\nCorey and Peel\n\nAs the two spokespeople of Heaven and Hell respectively, Metatron has known Corey and Peel for quite some time, having gone on many diplomatic missions to meet them. He has a very petty rivalry with them ripe with animosity and past grievances. Metatron enjoys belittling and insulting Corey and Peel for their incompetence, lack of power and received respect, while Corey and Peel enjoy breaking down Metatron's confidence with childish insults and insinuating that God would not be pleased with the state Metatron let Heaven fall into. Overall, Metatron's relationship with Corey and Peel is ripe with antagonism and somewhat petty conflict, with both sides vying for power and authority in the cosmic hierarchy between Heaven and Hell.\n\nDuring Metatron's meeting with Charlie, Metatron and the two apple servants almost instantly began beefing with each other, with Corey and Peel challenging Metatron's authority and competence, accusing him of various shortcomings within the Kingdom of Heaven. Metatron, in turn, undermined them and exposes the fact that Lucifer has let them go, attempting to diminish their credibility.\n\nThe situation escalates into a heated exchange of insults and accusations, with Corey and Peel and Metatron practically turning the debate in the embassy into a petty contest. Upon getting Serenity, Lux, and Charlie involved, Corey and Peel successfully pushed Metatron into revealing that he hasn't communicated with God in centuries and has been fabricating messages to maintain the illusion of divine guidance. Corey and Peel, instead of feeling vindicated, take delight in Metatron's downfall, highlighting the deep-seated enmity between them and Metatron.\n\nQuotes\n\nChapter 5\n\nHoly Hell\n\nTrivia\n\nHe is based on Metatron, a figure primarily found in Jewish mysticism. In Jewish tradition, Metatron is said to be the highest of the angels, often associated with divine authority and acting as the celestial scribe who records the deeds of humanity. In Kabbalistic teachings, Metatron is often depicted as a mediator between the divine and the material world, tasked with transmitting the will of God to the lower realms.\n\nMetatron's name is derived from the Greek words \"meta\" (meaning \"beyond\" or \"transcendent\") and \"thronos\" (meaning \"throne\").\n\nThe series' authors consider Metatron to be more of a joke character than an actual character, and that he is best in small doses since he serves a comic relief role.\n\nNavigation"
