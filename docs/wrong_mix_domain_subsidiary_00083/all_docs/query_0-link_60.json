        "text": "EMC has announced availability of DD Boost for Enterprise Applications.\n\nWhat is this then?\n\nNew ways of protecting data?\n\nSomething new to learn, again?\n\nDD Boost for Enterprise Applications consists of two parts:\n\nModules for using EMC DataDomain DD Boost together with native data protection functionality from:\n\nSAP HANA\n\nSAP with Oracle (BR*Tools)\n\nOracle (RMAN)\n\nMicrosoft SQL\n\nIBM DB2\n\nEMC Data Protection Advisor (DPA) for monitoring and reporting on the various sources.\n\nThe modules allows application administrators (DBAs) to work with their own interfaces and workflows, yet still move data to protection storage in an efficient manner.\n\nThis means that instead of having to install third party backup software and giving another team the control over scheduling and workflow, the DBAs now control, when and if they protect their data.\n\nIn some applications they even stay in control of moving this data offsite, simply specifying that the DataDomain target should perform what is known as a Managed File Replication to one (or more) DataDomain system(s). Recovery of the data can take place from any of these systems.\n\nFor some of the systems, replication can be controlled by writing to different folders in the DataDomain system, if they write to one that is enabled for DataDomain mtree replication, the data is moved offsite as soon as the backup is done, write to one where it isn’t and data stays onsite.\n\nThe whole point of developing this functionality is that in many organisations, there is a rift opening up between what application owners demand and require and what the IT operations department can deliver. Eventually, you see everyone rolling their own solutions and creating the dreaded silos that breed cost, complexity and poor interoperability.\n\nDD Boost for Enterprise Applications addresses one of these rift creating scenarios, namely the classic problem that DBA’s does not want someone else to interfere with their often very complex environments, in this case through backup and recovery via a backup application.\n\nThe “classic” way, dump and sweep or backup agents:\n\nEMC began addressing this with DD Boost for Oracle RMAN which allowed Oracle DBA’s to continue using their own RMAN scripts, schedulers and so on.\n\nThey could write directly to highly resilient data protection storage in an efficient manner.\n\n‘The success has been great with this, thousands of EMC customers has adopted it and carved out complexity and cost while doing so.\n\nFor the rest, it was still dump and sweep or backup agents.\n\nNow, the same opportunity comes to administrators of SAP, SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.\n\nNothing new to learn for the backup admins, minute long deployment and automatic monitoring for the data protection teams. That’s what this announcement means!\n\nIn this post I will try to pick apart some of the new functionality that appeared in the latest and greatest DataDomain DDOS release.\n\nIn one of my earlier posts , I have an overview of the four new DataDomain systems and what they are, you can read that here:\n\nBackup to the future: New DataDomain systems\n\nDDOS is the denominator for the operating environment (OE) of EMC Datadomain systems and these have now reached version 5.4.\n\nFunctionality in DataDomain systems come in play both in the Protection Storage part as well as in the Data Source Integration parts of the overall EMC data protection architecture.\n\nThe object of DataDomain, a Purpose Built Backup Appliance (PBBA) is of course backup, but also to protect archival data, DataDomain systems are designed to take care of both use cases.\n\nA big part of the DDOS 5.4 release was supporting the expanded integration into Avamar 7, which I wrote about here:\n\nBackup to the future: Avamar 7\n\nWe also launched support for what is now a very extensive list of Archive partners:\n\nSAP HANA backup\n\nSomething we can all be sure of is that all databases will get bigger and have higher and higher demands on availability and performance.\n\nThis usually translates to database administrators will demand control over the protection of their data, if the backup teams doesn’t deliver the protection architecture, they will take matters in their own hands, this has been discussed by people much smarter than me, such as the CTO for EMC Backup & Recovery, Steve Manley.\n\nWhat EMC presented today is a way to protect SAP HANA in-memory databases, all within the database administrators control.\n\nBackups will flow directly to the DataDomain system, without any need to stage it in between. This means significant savings on infrastructure and storage.\n\nAt the same time, the efficient replication that DataDomain systems provide will make sure that protected data is sent off-site in the shortest time possible.\n\nOracle Exadata Backup and DR\n\nAnother really exiting industry first is that EMC presented support for direct integration to Oracle Exadata environments through EMC DataDomain DDBoost.\n\nAgain, this means that administrators or Exadata systems can take direct control of their data protection and if need be, disaster recovery.\n\nData Domain systems are the first deduplication storage to be Oracle Backup Solutions Program validated for Exadata.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read my musings on this and keep an eye open for upcoming posts where I dig deeper in the subjects.\n\nIn a few other posts, I have written about other components of EMC’s Backup to the future launch.\n\nThe turn has now come to another member of the data Management and data source integration components of the EMC data protection stack:\n\nToday, EMC announced Networker 8.1, building on the foundations of Networker 8.0 that was launched in 2012.\n\nNetworker 8.0 was the biggest release since EMC acquired Legato ten years ago.\n\nThe foundation that was put in then was dubbed “Networker for the next ten years” and certainly is fundamental for the barrage of groundbreaking news that was announced.\n\nIn this post, I will try my best to shine a light at some of these, there will be many opportunities going forward to go deeper and discuss more.\n\nVirtualization backup and recovery:\n\nWith a sibling like Avamar, with its leading VMware functionality, Networker has been seen as behind in many virtualization use cases.\n\nThis all changes now, EMC Networker is getting backup and recovery powered by Avamar.\n\nThis is a theme you might recognize from VMware vSphere Data Protection, which is also powered by EMC Avamar technology.\n\nSo the goodies delivered here are some of those seen in Avamar, like Changed Block Tracking for backup and restore, load balancing, multi streaming and more.\n\nVMware administrators can work with image level backup and recovery straight from the vSphere Web Client through an integration plugin and set up backup policies, kick off both restores and backups and assign policies to VMs.\n\nNew VM’s can inherit backup policies automagically when such have been established for the environment.\n\nEnd users can make their restores without relying on the IT team through a new web interface.\n\nAll these treats are unlocked through deploying a Virtual Backup Applicance, which is then managed through the normal Networker Administration Console.\n\nIntegration with EMC primary storage systems:\n\nNetWorker 8.1 has brand new snapshot management for EMC primary storage including VMAX, VNX, and RecoverPoint systems.\n\nThe integration is dead simple as one would rightfully expect when the components all come from one vendor.\n\nEverything is done through a wizard that discovers the primary storage systems and queries the snapshot schedules there.\n\nWhen all this is done, snapshots can be controlled from Networker and rolled off to either a DataDomain system or any other disk.\n\nIf need be, these can then be cloned off to tape or other devices as needed.\n\nBlock based backups:\n\nThis is a feature with an innocent sounding name, but wields great power.\n\nIt is an integrated feature in the Windows client, and works from Windows Server 2008 R2 and up.\n\nBlock based backup works in conjunction with Microsoft’s VSS framework.\n\nWhat it does is take an image-based backup at the volume level, rather than walking the entire file system, in the backup process.\n\nIt’s as simple as ticking a check-box to get working and when you tick that box… hang on tight.\n\nAs said, there is no need to walk the file system, so backups start flowing immediately and no index is created.\n\nOnly the changed blocks are backed up, enabling fast backup with minimal impact.\n\nRecovery is achieved by mounting the resulting Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) to browse and extract the necessary files, single file, directories or the whole shebang.\n\nIn internal testing, we have seen file system backups complete up to 5x faster than a traditional file backup and recovery operations are 2-4x faster.\n\nBackup and recovery control for system owners:\n\nFor DBA’s, just like with the example of VMware administrators, there are great news too.\n\nSince most database administrators like full control over their backups and recoveries, many organizations still work with a classic “dump and sweep” workflow.\n\nWhile it does provide the desired control, it also creates multiple handoffs, synchronization issues and generally a lot of growling between IT roles.\n\nOracle collaborative protection\n\nFor Oracle, Networker 8.1 introduces “collaborative protection”.\n\nFundamentally, DBAs are able to easily manage their own backups with their native tools and RMAN scripts, but Networker provides backup catalog synchronization as soon as these RMAN scripts are kicked off.\n\nWhen credentials are exchanged between the DBA and backup crowds, they can each go back and continue on, no need for Networker admins to learn Oracle, no need for Oracle admins to learn Networker.\n\nSuddenly, database dumps are automatically backed up to protection storage as needed, when needed and at the same time they are indexed as such.\n\nRestores from RMAN scripts, without any changes, are now in a single, automated step, directly from the backup location.\n\nOther system owner integration\n\nMicrosoft SQL owners get an SQL Management Studio plug-in that enables them to take backups, perform restores and more, all without having to involve the backup team.\n\nFor IBM DB2, there is integration into the new’ish IBM Data Studio.\n\nThere’s more\n\nMuch more…\n\nNetworker Module for databases and applications (NMDA) in its new version 1.5 provides support for.. drumroll please, MySQL.\n\nThere has been debate and thoughts on if such a plug-in would actually be used, but with the growth of MySQL, EMC decided to put forth the engineering resources needed to develop this support.\n\nThis isn’t your typical release 1.0, straight out of the doors you see a very comprehensive feature set.\n\nYou have hot and cold backups, full and granular backup and restore as well as backup and restore of logs. Also supported is restore to any point-in-time of a backup with no third party tool dependency. Both MyISAM and InnoDB, the most popular underlying storage engines for MySQL, are supported.\n\nIn Microsoft land, you see support for optimized backup of deduplicated volumes, support for SQL Server 2012, Exchange 2013 and SharePoint 2013 as well currency with all new updates and service packs.\n\nI could go on and on about all the cool stuff in Networker, but for now I will relent and let any surviving readers (thank you) actually go out and be productive again.\n\nIn the big launch today, EMC launched a whole array of new and groundbreaking things.\n\nI am trying to break these up in a series of posts and explain them in a high-level fashion.\n\nThey all have roles to play in the EMC BRS stack:\n\nThe first post was a bit of explanation about the new DataDomain systems.\n\nThe turn has now come to Avamar, which was announced in it’s latest generation, Avamar 7.0\n\nThis is a major release and my objective here is to give a brief introduction to some of the many enhancements.\n\nAvamar 7 brings forth a bunch of things, the first one I am going to touch on is the further integration that is happening with the Protection storage part of the stack, namely the DataDomain systems.\n\nAll data center workloads can now be targeted to a Data Domain System using EMC DataDomain DD Boost (except one, I’ll get back to that).\n\nPreviously file systems and NDMP workloads were exclusively sent to the Avamar DataStore, or as it is popularly called, “the grid”.\n\nThis means even more scalability for Avamar, unstructured content such as files certainly are high growth workloads and many are struggling with containing these.\n\nAn excellent strategy for limiting the growth of file backups is archiving, but that is a subject for a later post. 😉\n\nNew functionality for virtual environments\n\nYou will see a bunch of new and cool functionality for both VMware and Microsoft virtual environments.\n\nOn the VMware side, Avamar, when backups are sent to a DataDomain system now offers what is called Instant Access.\n\nInstant Access means that the VM is presented from an NFS mount on the DataDomain and then is accessed there and is up and\n\nrunning, without any “restore” having been performed.\n\nThe performance characteristics of a purpose built backup appliance is radically different than a production storage system, so expect that the VM will run with much fewer IOPS. The good news is that you can immediately start a Storage vMotion, which will move the running machine back to production storage.\n\nNow, on this matter, I will go on a tangent, and describe a bit about how Avamar normally does restores, to show the different tools that a backup admin has at his or her disposal.\n\nAvamar can perform an image backups with VMware Change Block Tracking (CBT) like most other backup software\n\nvariants out there.What that means is that at the time of backup, only the blocks changed since the last backup will be scanned, these blocks are then deduplicated against all other blocks Avamar tracks and those that are globally unique are then compressed, encrypted and sent to the protection storage.\n\nNothing unique here, most backup brands have this functionality today, some only from full backups, etc, Avamar does it every day, every backup is a full backup, but only globally unique data is sent.\n\nNow, on to the really unique stuff. When it comes to restores, Avamar uses the CBT functionality again, querying the vSphere again about what has changed between the point of backup and now. Only the blocks that is needed to rebuild the point in time is then sent back.\n\nMost changes that require a full image restore are trivial, so this means that restores are amazingly fast in most scenarios.\n\nSo what we see here is that there are a multitude of possibilities for making restores, from a single file to a whole VM.\n\nNow, on the VMware backup/restore management side, Avamar 7 also has a whole host of new functionality, some of it really redefining stuff.\n\nThe first new functionality I will mention here is the vCenter interface integration.\n\nThe VMware admin usually feels most at home in the vSphere Client.\n\nAvamar 7 provides a plugin here, so that there is no need for her or him to go learn another interface.\n\nFrom here, the VMware admin just clicks EMC Backup and Recovery and can immediately configure backup policies, initiate restores or kick off a backup job.\n\nAnother new very useful functionality is what is referred to as “Dynamic backup policies”.\n\nWhat that means is that backup policies can be applied to various different entities within the vSphere hierarchy, such as a cluster, a whole datacenter or what I guess will be most common, a group (folder) of VMs. Any VM that gets added to these entities will inherit the backup policy automatically to ensure new VMs are always protected.\n\nFor those out there that are using Microsoft Hyper-V, there are also really good news!\n\nEMC is adding support for Hyper-V 2012 to the already existing Hyper-V 2008 support.\n\nSupport for using backup proxies in clustered shared volumes (CSV) has been added, meaning that one host can be pointed out to take care of the I/O generated by backups.\n\nFurther, in a Hyper-V 2008 R2 implementation, when a backup was started for one server in a Hyper-V over CSV cluster, all of the other Hyper-V servers in the cluster went into what is called I/O redirection mode. This meant that when the backup was running, all other Hyper-V servers had to send their I/O write requests to the Hyper-V server being backed up, slowing their write I/O performance. This re-direction now eliminated in Hyper-V 2012 backups with Avamar. Thanks for fixing that one Microsoft :).\n\nHyper-V 2012 got a lot better, and Avamar is right there with it.\n\nNAS system / NDMP backups\n\nSince many many years, Avamar has had really leading functionality for NDMP backups through the innovative use of an “NDMP accelerator”.\n\nThis means that after an initial full (level 0) backup, Avamar can continue to only request incremental (level 1) dumps from the filer daily, but still providing a full backup.\n\nAvamar supports the backup of EMC Isilon, VNX and VNXe, Celerra and NetApp systems with this method, and Isilon is the new kid in here.\n\nFor now, Isilon has some restrictions, primarily because Isilon can get tremendously big, we want to make sure that the backup solutions are positioned correctly here.\n\nManagement of Avamar itself has also gotten an overhaul. A *ahem* less than loved part of Avamar management has been that there has been what is a tad non-poetically named “Blackout Window”, where no backups could be performed.\n\nIn Avamar 7, this restriction is removed, only leaving what is called a “maintenance window”, with fewer restrictions.\n\nAll deduplication systems need some time to take care of cleaning, expiration, integrity checks, etc. The good news is that the parts which required a read-only system previously now run in the background.\n\nWrap-up:\n\nStill there?\n\nThanks! 😀\n\nThere are tons more to mention about this release, especially on the application integration side, with Microsoft Windows, Microsoft applications, Oracle, IBM DB2 and many many more, all getting major enhancements. I will save this for yet another blog post.\n\nWatch this space!\n\nThis is a big launch, EMC is presenting four new DataDomain systems, joining the others.\n\nYou can rewatch the whole “Backup to the future” launch event:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/134gk7U\n\nThese are:\n\nDataDomain DD2500\n\nDataDomain DD4200\n\nDataDomain DD4500\n\nDataDomain DD7200\n\nAll these new systems are based on Intel Sandy Bridge processors and in some cases provide 4x more performance than the systems they are replacing.\n\nMore performance is important, even if the systems they replace certainly weren’t slouches.\n\nFor some users of the systems, even more important is the fact that these systems can take 2-3x more streams (write/read/replication) than the previous systems.\n\nThese systems really are a new generation, they come in new chassis types, these are fully EMC designed and those that use more than one type of system from EMC will appreciate the similarities.\n\nWith the new design comes the usage of the nice EMC designed I/O modules which will come in all known varieties known from before, such as copper and optical 1/10 GbE, Fiberchannel. They are smaller and easier to service than the legacy form factor.\n\nThese so called “SLIC” modules will also be used for things like the NVRAM and battery backup.\n\nAll in all, these can be installed and swapped out without opening the chassis or removing the unit from the rack, making it much more serviceable.\n\nSo, some specifics about these systems.\n\nDataDomain DD2500\n\nThe DD2500 replaces it’s predecessor, the DD640.\n\nIt offers 4x faster performance and 4x more scalability.\n\nThis is a 2U system that is powered by an Intel Sandy Bridge CPU.\n\nThe system can be expanded with one DataDomain ES30-30TB shelf and can scale to four of those or three ES30-45TB shelves.\n\nInternally, it has seven or 12 3 TB HDD’s.\n\nThe maximum of this system is 133 TB of usable capacity, that is, before the data gets reduced through compression and deduplication.\n\nDataDomain DD4200\n\nThe DD4200 replaces it’s predecessor, the DD670 and offers 4x faster performance and 10x more scalability.\n\nThis system can back up 175 TB in under eight hours\n\nsince it can do 22 TB/hr reads with the use of EMC DataDomain DD Boost.\n\nIt can be expanded with 8 ES30-30TB shelves or 5 ES30-45TB shelves with up to 189TB of usable space.\n\nThis system can also use legacy shelves from older systems if a customer chooses to upgrade his older DataDomain.\n\nAll it takes is to swap the head out with all the data in place.\n\nRemember, all DataDomain systems have a single namespace and everything deduplicates against everything else.\n\nDataDomain DD4500\n\nThe DD4500 is the replacement for the DD860, which certainly wasn’t a slouch, but the DD4500 offers 2x faster performance and 2x more scalability.\n\nThis is a very scalable system that allows up to 12 ES30-30TB expansion shelves or 8 ES30-45TB shelves. This makes for an impressive 285 TB usable space.\n\nJust like the DD4200, the DD4500 can use legacy shelves from older DataDomain systems in an upgrade scenario.\n\nThe goodies doesn’t end there through. The DataDomain DD4500 can also be supercharged with the Data Domain Extended Retention software option. With that, customers can use this system for a massive 1.1 PB usable capacity for long-term backup retention.\n\nDataDomain DD7200\n\nNow we are talking large scale, but not largest 🙂\n\nThe previous second largest system in the DataDomain family was the DD890, the DD7200 replaces it and provides twice the performance and 6x the scalability, impressive numbers.\n\nIn it’s base configuration this system allows for 18 ES30-30TB shelves or 12 ES30-45TB shelves. That means 428 TB usable capacity in a single namespace and single deduplication domain.\n\nJust as the previous two systems listed this system supports legacy ES20 shelves and can be upgraded to with a simple headswap.\n\nInstall the Extended Retention software option and you can protect 1.7 PB usable capacity for long-term backup retention.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, this post tells only a small portion of what the Backup To The Future launch presented. I will be back with more cool news about our DataDomain DDOS 5.4 functionalities, as well as the massive updates that took place in EMC Networker 8.1 and EMC Avamar 7.\n\nSo, this really is only the high level news with regards to the protection storage portion of the EMC Data protection stack:\n\nAre we having fun yet? 🙂\n\nThe most vehement of the cloud evangelists seem to think that any day now anything and everything will live in the cloud.\n\nWhatever pace and end state you foresee, we can all agree that there certainly will be steps and that the journey will be different for all organizations.\n\nA big enabler for “all in” cloud consumption is Software-as-a-service with a large number of very mature suppliers of various types of applications “on tap”.\n\nPerhaps the most well known of these is Salesforce.com, which is part of the CRM market, which continues to be the largest market for SaaS.\n\nHowever, trust is the ultimate gateway to cloud adoption, and in trust, backup is a very important component.\n\nI am a sceptic guy, but to get anywhere in life, you need to trust.\n\nSo.. trust, but verify.\n\nAll credible SaaS suppliers provide backup functionality, of course, they do it with varying success and granularity though.\n\nWith the advent of CRM SaaS, and the success of Salesforce.com, customers began to see challenges with the rather rigid policies Salesforce.com commits to.\n\nThe backups are rather infrequent and tough to export and restore.\n\nThis, however, is only one example which I selected because of the popularity and general knowledge about Salesforce.com.\n\nThe bigger issue on the road to trust and maturity is a standard for these matters.\n\nStandards don’t come easy, it’s a classic design by committee, and the results are bland, if there even are results.\n\nThere certainly must be a huge market for whomever grabs the opportunity to provide a middle layer that SaaS providers can implement and SaaS buyers can hook into.\n\nThink of it as RSS for backup.\n\nI would imagine the control and data paths to take place over REST to be flexible, web enabled and programmable.\n\nThere would be a great opportunity for all makers of backup solutions to easily expand their capabilities to control and move data between public and private cloud solutions.\n\nIn the end, this could take care of a huge trust issue, maintain compliance and accelerate cloud adoption."
