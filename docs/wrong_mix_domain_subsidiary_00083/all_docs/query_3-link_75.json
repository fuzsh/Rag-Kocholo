        "text": "<strong>Think</strong> <strong>Technology</strong>: <strong>Data</strong> <strong>Storage</strong> & <strong>Networking</strong> Innovating To Optimize In A Resource-Constrained World THINK SUMMARY: The data storage industry is witnessing a wave of new innovation directed at addressing today's market priorities of storage capacity, energy, and performance optimization at Internet scale. Innovation spans the breadth of storage process, media, fabric, software, and hardware, and innovators are helping business rethink the way data is stored to be in line with today's priorities, in our opinion. In this paper, we review what we believe are market sub-segments with the strongest potential in 2009 and also highlight some private companies leading innovation in these product segments. KEY POINTS: We believe Capacity, Energy, and Performance Optimization are the top three priorities in the storage market in today's resource-constrained environment. The storage industry is witnessing a wave of new innovation directed at addressing these market priorities. Innovation in the industry spans the breadth of storage process, media, fabric, software, and hardware, and innovators are helping business rethink the way data is stored in line with today's priorities, in our opinion. The buyers' market for IT is enabling storage customers to be more patient and circumspect as they evaluate solutions that best address their changing needs, and it is providing vendors with differentiated and compelling solutionsâ€”an attractive opportunity to gain share, in our opinion. Hence, despite a severely challenged IT spending environment, we expect companies (including some very interesting private names) with differentiated and superior solutions addressing these market priorities to see accelerated growth in 2009. Given Tier-1 storage vendors' strong balance sheets, their desperation to get involved in growth markets that stay immune to the IT spending slowdown, enterprises' inclination to buy from the Tier-1 vendors in the longer term, and VCs' fewer options considering the subdued public markets, we expect 2009 to be a year of significant consolidation in the storage industry. Given the potential for accelerated growth in tough times and the above average possibility of acquisition for smaller companies with compelling value propositions aligned with today's pressing market priorities, we believe that the storage industry presents some very attractive opportunities for investors in both public and private markets.
