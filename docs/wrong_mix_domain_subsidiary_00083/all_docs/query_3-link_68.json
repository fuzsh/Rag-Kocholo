Since 1979 Power Consumption: The Main Culprits Identify The Biggest Guzzlers In Your Data Center by John Brandon With the knowledge that specific hard- ware inside the data center is responsible for the most power consumption, IT can start addressing consumption issues. In an economic downturn, this is important because while power usage was always a lower priority for most companies during the past two decades (at least, lower than other top concerns), it is now a new area of focus as a cost-cutting measure. It's also unclear who will be meeting our ever-increasing energy needs in the United States, as some Middle Eastern countries have announced that their oil ex- ports will start to diminish rapidly in the next decade. And there's global warming and environmental concerns that are probably on the minds of IT administrators. The problem is, even determining which hardware is consuming the most power can be expensive and time-consuming. Large utilities companies offer some tools and analysis, and emerging energy virtualiza- tion and analysis tools can help you weed out energy inefficiencies. For the most part, these energy analysis options are sound and make sense over the long term, but an addi- tional approach is just knowing which hardware typically uses the most power and then putting a plan in place to deal with those heavy-use culprits. Before we explain the top energy users in a data center, we should note that if your Go to Page 10 Tracking Your SME's Assets Would You Notice A Missing Computer? by Curt Harler \"Lost: Dell laptop. Slate gray color. Last seen at Coffee Cafe. Answers to pass- word 1234. Owner misses greatly. Reward.\" Not all lost computers are wanted. In a survey conducted last fall by Absolute Software (www.absolute.com), 62% of respondents believe that missing computers at their companies have gone unnoticed. That's a sobering statistic considering the proprietary and personal information on every missing computer. According to John Livingston, CEO of Absolute Software, by the end of last year, one in two computers sold was a notebook computer. SMEs are part of this trend, making them prime targets for opportunis- tic crooks, would-be identity thieves, and absent-minded employees. \"State data-breach laws have made SMEs responsible for making sure that the infor- mation on mobile computers is protected in the event a computer is lost or stolen,\" says Livingston. All businesses, regardless of size, need to make sure they know where their mobile computers are, as well as who is using them and must have plans in place should one go missing. Given today's regulatory environment, it is imperative that companies of all sizes take a proactive approach to securing their mobile computers and the data on them. At a bare minimum, security specialists advise SMEs to establish policies around what information can be downloaded onto portable computers and taken outside com- pany facilities. Access to sensitive informa- tion, such as customer Social Security numbers, should be strictly limited to situa- tions where that information is absolutely required. \"The only way to really make sure your computers are safe is to make sure they don't get stolen in the first place,\" says Eric Nelson, director of business development at technology consulting firm Alteritech (www.alteritech.com), admitting that con- cept is true \"consultant-speak.\" \"The biggest issue for most SME IT managers is having an accurate, current Go to Page 10 Companies of all sizes sliould Xdke a proactive approacli to securing tlieir mobile computers and the data on them.

Reconnex's Data Loss Profiler will not only identify weak points, but it will also track the confidential and sensitive data leaving the network and note where it's going. Data Loss Profiler will catalog and cate- gorize all of the sensitive material leaving the network, even if the content has not been previously protected. This is beneficial because some DLP (data loss prevention) solutions will rely solely on policies that currently exist, missing critical content. Thus, Data Loss Profiler ensures a thorough search of content for a more secure solution. Data Profiler can also detect data loss pat- terns from network interaction.

To that end, there are two new SuperTrak EX SAS/SATA RAID controllers from Promise Technology. The SuperTrak EX8658 and EX8654 host-based controllers both pro- vide a total of eight SAS/SATA ports with a 3Gbps signaling speed. However, the two cards differ in their port configurations. The Super- Trak EX8658's eight ports are all external, whereas the SuperTrak EX8654 splits its complement into four internal and four external ports. They come in the low-profile MD2 form factor, perfect for Promise's 12- or 16-bay VTrak E-Class JBOD expansion enclosures. With RAID 5 and 6 capabilities, database transactions and disk-to-disk backups are obvi- ous applications for the newest members of the SuperTrak EX family. Promise is targeting the controllers at midrange and entry-level servers running Windows or popular flavors of Linux. Besides data center applications. Promise says that the new adapters are of interest for video post-production and capture applications. The SuperTrak EX line shares a unified code base with Promise's other SuperTrak and VTrak products. This allows the company's WebPAM Pro management environment to give the user a single point of control over RAIDs wherever they reside on the network. Any storage attached to a SuperTrak EX controller or a VTrak E-Class RAID subsystem is accessible, and controllable, through WebPAM Pro.

Messaging & Telephony March 21 , 2008 Give Your Mail Server A Break Proginet's CFI Attachment Manager Eliminates Need For Size & Other Limits The CFI Attachment Manager's interface makes exchanging email attachments safe and efficient. Most organizations impose limits on email attachment and mailbox sizes to keep attach- ments from bogging down the email server. This practice does not leave an audit trail, fails to address security concerns, and results in important attachments being blocked or lost. Proginet's CFI (CyberFusion Integration Suite) Attachment Manager is a software-based email attachment manager that works as a Microsoft Outlook plug-in or through a standard Web browser to eliminate the need for attachment size restric- tions and other limits. In short, Attachment Manager lets users send and receive emails attach- ments of any size. And it fea- tures an easy-to-use interface that lets users exert greater con- trol over their file transfers. Proginet's offering creates logs and time stamps at every stage of the email's life cycle for compliance, e-discovery, and security purposes, and it automatically encrypts attach- ments for secure transfer. Administrators can monitor, control, and audit incoming and outgoing files. It supports archiving of attachments for up to an unlimited period of time and handles the resource- consuming attachments, reduc- ing downtime and shorten- ing backup and restore times. Attachment Manager can be used as a standalone product or as an expansion module for other Proginet CFI products.

That means remote access and control is neces- sary, and security is a must. Enter the Dominion KSX II remote access appliance. The new model brings together serial-over-IP, KVM-over-IP, and power management and houses them in a stream- lined package. The Dominion KSX II is intended for secure, out-of-band control of servers, PBXs, routers, and switches in branch offices and remote sites. It also sup- ports virtual media file transfers to allow rollouts of updates and bug fixes. Users have BIOS-level access to remote systems, right down to being able to reboot a server or restart a switch. (Some power monitoring and cycling requires Raritan' s Dominion PX power strips.) A browser- based HTML GUI offers a top-down look at the equipment under the unit's control. All of the Dominion KSX II's communi- cations are protected with 256-bit AES and integrated authentication. It also supports strong passwords and locks out users after a number of failed logon attempts. Another key feature is Absolute Mouse Synchronization, which maintains the remote user's mouse settings no matter which server is being controlled. The Dominion KSX II is CommandCenter-certified, so multiple units (and connected hardware) can be command- ed from one IP address. That's a big help to organizations with far-flung resources. Should the network fail, the Dominion KSX II offers a built-in modem with dial- back capability. The appliance works with AAA servers, as well as SNMP and Syslog event management systems. The KSX2-144 includes four KVM, four serial, and two power control ports; the KSX2-188 has eight KVM, eight serial, and two power control ports.

Industry analysts were not surprised that the commission approved the merger, but some were surprised that it didn't impose any conditions on the deal. The commission did remind the two companies that they are obligated to respect the privacy of personal data. Google's CEO and Chairman Eric Schmidt announced that the merger may result in some job cuts, although he didn't specify how many. I Letter Questions Progress On H-1 B The H-IB program is in need of better oversight and enforcement from the U.S. Department Of Homeland Security, accord- ing to U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, Grassley urged Chertoff to make good on his promises to reform and improve the current immigra- tion system, including the H-IB visa pro- gram. Grassley says he has yet to see progress on the issue, citing that most H-IB visas are going to foreign-based companies. \"U.S. businesses that need highly skilled workers are getting the short end of the stick,\" Grassley says. I HP Tops PC Market Share In Q4 The fourth quarter was a good one for top-tier U.S. PC brands, with HP, Dell, and Apple all posting gains for the period, according to research company iSuppli. During the quarter, HP held its lead in the worldwide marketplace, with PC shipments growing 25.5% to 14.6 million units, com- pared to 11.6 million units during the same quarter in 2006. Despite Dell's fall from No. 1 in 2006, the company is beginning to recover, with Q4 shipments up 11.3 million units, or 17.4%, compared to the same peri- od a year prior. Apple has also posted increases in shipments; the company's fourth-quarter growth was 39.3% compared to Q4 the previous year. I Microsoft Challenges \"Vista-Capable\" Lawsuit In response to a judge's decision to grant class-action status to a lawsuit against Microsoft, the company has asked that the case be suspended while it appeals the deci- sion. The lawsuit contends that Microsoft's marketing push to sell Vista-capable PCs was misleading for consumers. The suit also claims that consumers paid an inflated price for computers that were labeled Vista-capa- ble. Microsoft has asked that the discovery process be halted while it appeals in order to avoid revealing sensitive company infor- mation that may be deemed unnecessary if the company is successful with the appeal. If granted, the stay would delay the current October start date for the trial. I News Corp. Won't Battle For Yahoo! According to a report from Reuters, News Corp.'s Chief Executive and Chairman Rupert Murdoch says News Corp. will not fight Microsoft over Yahoo!. Previously, Yahoo! and News Corp. had been discussing the possibiUty of News Corp. combining its MySpace.com and other online properties in an attempt to thwart Microsoft's attempt at taking over Yahoo!. However, Reuters reported that Murdoch said at the annual Bear Steams Media Conference, \"We're not going to get into a fight with Microsoft, which has a lot more money than us.\" Last month, Microsoft offered an unsolicited bid of $44.6 billion in cash and stock to take over Yahoo!, which Yahoo! rejected. I Gates Falls In World's Richest Rankings With a personal fortune of about $58 billion. Bill Gates came in at No. 3 on Forbes' newest list of the world's richest people. Gates ranked No. 1 on the list 13 years in a row but fell this year primarily because of the drop in Microsoft's stock price caused by its unsolicited bid for Yahoo!. Berkshire Hathaway' s Warren Buffett came in at No. 1 this year, with a net worth of about $62 billion; Carlos Slim Helu, a leader in Mexico's telecom industry, came in second place with a net worth of about $60 billion. Oracle's Larry Ellison ranked 14th; Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page came in at 32 and 33, respective- ly; Michael Dell was No. 40; and Micro- soft's Paul Allen ranked 41st, while Steve Ballmer ranked 43rd.

One of the health center's therapists was holding a clinic and had left the notebook in a nearby room. Telford and Wrekin' s CEO said in a statement that the notebook had contained encryption software to comply with security regulations, and it is no longer connected to the network. I Ask.com To Undergo Changes Internet search engine Ask.com is moving forward with a makeover that will result in the company laying off about 40 employees, which is about 8% of its work- force. Instead of continuing its quest to compete with Google, Ask.com will focus on a smaller, specific market of married women, primarily located in the South and Midwest. According to comScore Media Metrix, Ask.com ranked fifth among U.S. search engines with a 4.5% market share, compared to Google's 58.5% share, through lanuary. Ask.com CEO Jim Safka has said that he believes the changes will breathe new life into the search engine.

And if many files are being transfen^ed back and forth on a con- tinuous basis, that can reduce the capacity available for other applications residing on the server. Stargate Digital (www.stargate films.com), a London-, Vancou- ver-, and Los Angeles-based com- pany that provides visual effects for motion pictures and television shows, deals daily in large files. Its staff of artists and production people work with digitized shots, converted from 35mm film, and create 3D objects and animations. Fin- ished images are rendered at high resolu- tion by one of 26 rendering computers and sent on to a network server. After final edits, it sends the finished video back to the client company, either electronically or on a tape. In the film industry, speed is critical, says Dr. Joseph Meier, CTO of Stargate. So even a small delay can be a cause for con- cern. But so many large files being pro- cessed and transferred from server to server naturally created some delays in the servers and on the network. \"The artists and staff members often complained about slow net- work speeds,\" says Meier. That was a little over two years ago, when Meier and the IT staff realized that the large amount of file serving was affect- ing how other applications ran and, in some cases, was slowing the production process. \"We realized our CPUs were spending an inordinate amount of time pro- cessing TCP/IP requests instead of serving up images,\" says Meier. \"Each of these files is from 8 to 20MB in size, and that's just one frame. There are 24 or 30 frames per second in a television or film shoot. If you multiply that by the 15 or 16 television shows we do every week, plus other movie or television films and commercials, it adds up.\" In Search Of A Solution After reading an article on TCP offload technology, Meier decided to see what improvement he could get by adding a network accelerator card equipped with a TCP offload engine. He contacted Ala- critech (www.alacritech.com), a company headquartered in San Jose, Calif., which alacritech sent him a sample card to try in the Star- gate network. Alacritech's family of SNA (Scalable Network Accelerator) cards uses Ala- critech's own Dynamic TCP Offload Tech- nology to speed server performance by moving the network processing tasks off of the host CPU on to the network card. TCP offload engines — which several ven- dors, including Alacritech, sell — take over the TCP/IP file routing traffic so that the server CPU can more efficiently process applications and render graphics. By hav- ing, essentially, a co-processor card handle the file serving, the CPU doesn't have to interrupt application tasks to process TCP/ IP requests. Accelerator cards are usually put in place of the NIC (network interface card) that connects the server to the IP network. Because they are equipped with custom ASICs (application- specific integrated cir- cuits), accelerator cards tend to be more efficient in processing volumes of file transfer requests. \"In a traditional computer with a standard NIC, the CPU does all the processing. But with these offload engines, that information is put into the silicon [of the accelerator card]. So the server CPU only has to serve up the file and let the offload engine figure out where it's got to go,\" explains Meier. When Are Accelerator Cards Worth The Cost? Accelerator cards aren't inexpensive. Meier says he has paid as much as $1,000 each to equip nine of the company's file servers with Alacritech accelerator cards, although often he can get them for less from a discount retailer. Alacritech says its pricing ranges from $449 for a single- port, PCI-X copper SNA accelerator up to $3,499 for a 4-port, PCI-E Fiber SNA accelerator. Given that price tag, acceler- ator cards aren't necessarily a good investment for every organization. In some cases, upgrading the server hardware may be a better bet. Meier has a few suggestions for anyone considering the purchase of an accelerator card. First, optimize other parts of the network and server hardware before adding accelerator cards. Often, you can do a number of tweaks to increase response time, and accelerator cards probably shouldn't be your very first option, says Meier. \"If your switch is overloaded, or if it's not wire speed, then it's a question as to whether these cards will give you a bang for your buck,\" he says. Meier did make several enhancements to Stargate' s network before investing in the Alacritech cards. \"We've switched from Ultra SCSI to Fibre Channel and made all of our storage direct- attached so our render farm has direct access to the high-resolu- tion image files,\" says Meier. \"We upgrad- ed the backbone of the network and added a 10Gb Ethernet switch.\" But with terabytes of graphics files being accessed and processed and trans- ferred from server to server, even these improvements couldn't keep up. Response times were still slower than desired. In that case, the accelerator card was a need- ed addition. He also recommends checking that the accelerator card you choose supports your operating system. Alacritech currently sup- ports only Microsoft platforms, including WinXP, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2003. But the company says it is con- sidering adding Linux support in the future. Meier, for one, would appreciate the addition of Linux support due to the rising cost of Microsoft licenses. He plans to migrate his file servers to Linux, mainly to save on license fees. \"Microsoft is raising prices on its server operating system and client access licenses. We're doing mainly file serving, so it's not worth it to have all our servers on Microsoft,\" he says. Give It A Try You should also test the card in your net- work to see how it performs. Networks and servers have a million variables that can affect the response times, and accelerator cards may or may not provide the speed boost the vendor claims in different envi- ronments. So prospective buyers would be well-advised to ask for a trial model to see if they get the speed enhancements they expect. Alacritech, for instance, will send out products to prospective customers interested in trying them in their own envi- ronments. In Meier's initial trial of the Alacritech cards, he found speed increases from 10 to 15%, which is about what Stargate is get- ting today from the nine cards, both fiber- optic and copper-based, that it has installed to date. Alacritech says many customers report as much as 35% improvement in response time. But Meier is happy with 10%, given how important even small improvements in speed are to his business. \"We've always tried to wring every bit of speed from the network. If you're mostly working with Word documents or Excel spreadsheets, then you may not see an ROI,\" says Meier. \"But in an industry such as ours, which is all about the fast move- ment of large files, we have a very real need for them.\" Alacritech Scalable Network Accelerators Move TCP/IP processing off the server CPU to allow servers to perform more efficiently and provide better response time in applica- tion performance \"If you're mostly working with Word docu- ments or Excel spreadsheets, then you may not see an ROI,\" says Dr. Joseph Meier, CTO of Stargate Digital (www.stargatefilms.com). \"But in an industry such as ours, which is all about the fast movement of large files, we have a very real need for them [Alacritech Scalable Network Accelerator cards].\" (408) 287-9997 www.alacritech.com Physical Infrastructure February 1, 2008 Simpler Installation Of Underfloor Cabling Panduit's GridRunner System Improves Cable Routing Incorporating a cable-routing system into an organization's existing infrastructure can be a costly and time-consuming process. However, with the right system that is both adaptable and easy to install, routing data and power cables under a raised floor does not have to be a tremendous drain on a com- pany' s time and resources. Panduit has released a new series of products that make cable routing quick and convenient. Panduit's GridRunner system includes preassembled mounting brackets that make installation time-effective and ensure a company's new underfloor cable-routing sys- tem can get up and running in a minimal amount of time. By providing the brackets, Panduit also helps companies reduce the cost of imple- menting the routing system. The modular system consists of a series of wire baskets that make up the cable path- way; the drop-in wire basket sections make setup simple. When combined with the pre- assembled mounting brack- ets, there is no need to cut components to fit. The entire system is designed to assem- ble and install quickly. The wire baskets also provide another advantage: With the open nature of the wire basket, air travels freely through this compo- nent to reduce the likeli- hood of overheating. Panduit put a lot of thought into the design of the GridRunner compo- nents, and the parts do not damage cables due to poor design. The GridRunner parts have rounded edges and bend-radius control corners. Panduit has also used a bonding feature that electrically connects all compo- nents and provides electrical protection. Because GridRunner is a series of indi- vidual parts, a company can combine drop- in wire baskets and preassembled mount- ing brackets in a way that makes sense for the company's IT infrastructure.

Keep Tabs On Your Assets RF Code System Tracks Rack-Level Equipment In Real Time Companies no longer need to incur the high expenses associated with manu- ally tracking a company's data center inventory. A new system from RF Code makes data center asset inventory nearly automatic. Not only does this system save time and money, but it also helps com- panies ensure compliance with regulations. The three pro- ducts in the sys- tem—the RlOO Asset Tag, R200 Active RFID Rack Reader, and Zone Manager software — together create an automated inventory system that lets IT personnel perform real-time monitoring of rack-level assets. By implementing this system, a compa- ny can identify the location of any of its assets at any time. What makes RF Code's system differ- ent than other asset-tracking systems is that it updates inventory data every few seconds. In contrast, a traditional hard- ware-based inventory system requires that individual items are tagged or bar- coded and then scanned manually during inventory procedures. Traditional soft- ware-based inventory systems can only keep track of those servers that are plugged in and in their original locations. The RlOO Asset Tag has an industrial- strength adhesive backing to secure it to a standard U-mounted rack asset. Once the RlOO Asset Tags are mount- ed in a rack, they transmit signals that are received by the R200 Ac- tive RFID Rack Reader. The rack reader then re- ports the data it receives to the RF Code Zone Manager soft- ware, which can show the desig- nated zones and the RFID tags in each zone. If a data center asset is installed or removed, or if its location changes. Zone Manager immediately alerts staff. RF Code Asset Tracking System Consists of three parts: R100 Active RFID Tags ($18.50 per tag), R200 Rack Reader ($995), and Zone Manager Software (price based on number of racks and tagged servers) Uses software, asset tags, and an RFID reader to automatically track rack-level items for up-to-date inventory of data center assets (877) 969-2828 www.rfcode.com ^RFCode^ Storage February 15, 2008 Scalable Online Backup IVIozyEnterprise Offers Seamless Integration Into Existing Infrastructure Mmozy CantPDiPHnai Dashboard viwi»ii MocyErTlwpls» ■ J»ccb Fupri Pimtn * QBdtuEi Hd Hffp, fww BaEliiipOvBrvlinr SBBRliflWUuni ^^^^^^ MJH«r LUKGiWO ^^^^^ Hachiips madfr lF>lln lasl mail CUrnflLintlOnJ AMm 3?rElra indlillunna rvLiuriB iTiTnlikM hn v^OM.

Here are some top tips for reducing consumption and ^^^H boosting overall power. ^^^V Upgrade To Best-ln-Class Server Power Supplies There are many times that data ^^^H centers can cut corners and try out ^^^H unproven hardware and software, ^^^H but this isn't one of them. Go for ^^^H the gold standard as much as pos- ^^^H sible, and if that requires some ^^^H initial cash outlay, then make H room in the budget.

Spend a bit more for the highest level of efficiency now, and chances are that the data center will be reducing its overall consumption, constitut- ing a long-term savings. Maximize Power l\\/lanagement Software Along with the power supply upgrade, invest in effective power management In most data centers, the UPS provides power at 480V, which is then stepped down through a transformer, with accompanying losses, to 208V in the power distribution system, says Jack Pouchet, director of energy initiatives at Emer- son Networl< Power (www.emerson.com). These stepdown losses can be eliminated by converting UPS output power to 415V, he notes. 'The 415V three-phase input provides 240V single-phase, line-to-neutral input directly to the server,\" Pouchet says. 'The higher voltage software, Pouchet advises. \"Data centers are sized for peak conditions that rarely exist, which means server power con- sumption remains relatively high even when server load isn't,\" he says. Server processors have built-in power management features that can reduce power when the processor is idle, Pouchet adds, but often these features are disabled because not only eliminates stepdown losses but also enables an increase in server power supply efficiency.\" Servers and other IT equipment can handle the 240V AC input without any issues, Pouchet points out. SMEs can also gain efficiency by forgoing double-conversion UPS systems, but those gains do come with the risk of reduced equipment availability, so look closely at wheth- er availability is more crucial than the efficiency you could obtain. IT managers feel they affect response time. He notes, \"That decision is worth reconsid- ering in light of the potential savings.\" Check The Load Balancing Some SMEs use traditional single-phase power distribution to do load balancing, but that's often poorly managed, says Brad Wilson, chief technical director at Geist Manufacturing (800/ 432-3219; www.geistmfg.com). Instead of thinking of a data cen- ter as a space that needs as much power as it can get at every hour of the day, Wilson recommends thinking about how much power is necessary at different levels, such as at the cabinet level and for the larger room. In many cases, he notes, distribution can be balanced within each cabinet. As part of balancing the load, some power can simply be switched off depending on time of day, if the equipment within the cabinet is not mission-criti- cal, or the system is auxiliary. Internet power switches can control a rackmount environ- ment remotely, so power can be managed, rebooted, or changed to different user-defined de- faults. This is helpful at differ- ent times of the year, such as around the holidays when there are few employees in the build- ing or during a heat surge when cooling must be intensified and power has to be increased. Focus On Cooling Best Practices Many SMEs have hot-aisle and cold-aisle rack arrangements, but Pouchet notes that data center managers shouldn't stop there. Managers can find potential efficiency gains in sealing gaps in the floors, using blanking panels in open spaces in racks, and even organizing cables within a rack to maximize airflow. Also handy are strategies such as using computational fluid dynamics — which some power and cooling vendors offer — to identify inefficiencies and optimize airflow. Other technologies are also available to prevent cooling problems. Digital scroll compressors and variable frequency drives in CRACs (computer room air conditioners) allow high efficiency to be maintained at partial loads, according to Pouchet. These work by matching the capacity of the air conditioners to the room conditioners with- out turning compressors on and off, an action that can increase power consumption. \"In addition, higher-density data centers require shifting some of the cooling load The simplest way to reduce energy consump- tion in a data center is basically the same as cutting down energy use in a home: Do more with less. Rather than having every light on, have more efficient lights in strategic locations, for example. In a data center, increasing server utilization with virtualization and other consoli- dation tactics means less equipment is needed, and less power is used. One of the largest as- pects of this is around storage [See page 1 1 , \"Smarter Storage, Lower Electricity Bills\" for tips on reducing power consumption related to stor- age devices], but also important are other types of servers and network appliances. In consolidating, a data center may find that there are some servers or other equipment run- ning that are unnecessary or don't even per- form any specific function. This is the case in numerous data centers, notes Ken Brill, execu- tive director at the Uptime Institute. \"Up to 30% of corporate sen/ers are basically comatose,\" he says. 'They've been replaced by something but haven't been shut off.\" This is most preva- lent in companies without procedures in place for disposal of outdated equipment. from CRACs to supplemental cooling units mounted above or alongside the rack,\" Pouchet says. \"Supplemental cooling units can reduce cooling costs by 30% compared to traditional cooling strategies.\" Tap Into Monitoring Technologies Products are available that can monitor power usage, so a data center manager can see spikes and adjust accordingly. Also handy are monitoring tools for cooling because rack densities are rarely uniform in a data center and can create inefficiencies if there isn't enough optimization. \"Room-cooling units on one side of a facility may be humidifying the environment based on local conditions, while units on the opposite side are dehumidifying,\" Pouchet notes. \"Cooling control systems can monitor conditions across the data center and coordi- nate the activities of multiple units to pre- vent conflicts and increase teamwork.\" Get Expert Help Many firms specialize in power and cool- ing audits and assessments and have ample expertise on staff related to data center con- struction, renovations, and operations. Trying to juggle all the needs of an SME and become an expert in power consump- tion is a daunting task, so don't be afraid to bring in professionals who can provide a bevy of services. Often, product vendors can bundle in ser- vices along with their power management tools. Field technicians can start up and com- mission equipment, perform planned mainte- nance, and diagnose problems remotely. 3 Most Helpful Tip: Avoid Power Stepdown Losses Storage February 1, 2008 Powerful Network Backup Arkeia Adds Features For SMEs With Distributed Data & Remote Offices You don't need to spend a lot of time and money dealing with a complicated data manager.

A mainframe was not built to be energy-effi- cient; instead, it was built to address the changing computing requirements of com- panies with an increasing reliance on data that feeds every aspect of business: market- ing, sales, operations, finance, etc. One of the most dramatic changes you can make in power consumption and environmental change is to replace a mainframe with more energy-efficient blade servers and consoli- date data center operations. Staying Cool Has A Price One leading culprit in energy consump- tion in a data center actually has nothing to do with computer technology. Air-condi- tioning units consume vast amounts of power, as admins attempt to keep data cen- ter temperatures between 65 and 68 de- grees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 20 degrees Celsius). This expense is what accounts for the majority of the cost on a utility bill. According to Laura DiDio, a senior researcher with Yankee Group, air-condi- tioning units are the primary reason why data center admins have started to investi- gate power consumption and do not want to be surprised by energy costs. She says power usage has risen from a third- or fourth-tier concern to a much higher con- cern for companies, often a close second behind actually providing reliable and scal- able storage and services. \"The largest problem is inefficient cooling deployment,\" says Brad Wilson, the chief technical director at Geist Manufacturing (800/432-3219; www.geistmfg.com). \"This often leads to overprovisioning of cooling to keep the servers cool. This is compounded by the inherent efficiency factors in the total cooling system.\" Power-Hungry Hard Disl(s Another culprit in power consumption is storage arrays and specifically the hard disks in storage devices. According to Greenest Host (www.greenesthost.com), which spe- cializes in environmentally engineered data centers, the magnetic disks used in a data center do not hibernate like they do in a lap- top or desktop. They also ran at much higher speeds (about two or three times as fast as a consumer drive) and are accessed almost continuously in some firms, such as data ser- vice providers or financial institutions. DiDio says the best course of action for admins is to aggressively root out any older hardware, such as inefficient hard disks, and replace them with more efficient systems. Demanding CPUs Yet another power-hungry consumer is the CPU in servers. At even a smaller com- pany with just a few servers, the CPU is often running at full power, providing the core computing capability for all applica- tions. Wally Phelps, a product manager at DegreeC (www.degreec.com), a cooling electronics company, says CPUs are in- creasing, not decreasing, as a main culprit in power consumption as they are stressed even more inside a physical server and host more operating systems for virtualization. \"Consider the migration from single-core, dual-core, and now quad-core processors all on a single chip,\" says Phelps. \"There have Other Power-Hungry Products • Power distribution units. These are intended to provide power for devices in tlie data center but run continuously and are sometimes not properly configured for power management. • Servers. In addition to the CPU in a sen/er, the server itself is a top energy consumer, due to the components inside the servers, such as the motherboard and hard disk. • Networking equipment. This includes routers and switches, which are generally designed for low power consumption but — in total — can lead to a high consumption. recently been great advances by the chip- makers to help reduce this power when idle, but consider that when the CPUs are request- ed to do the function they were designed for, which is computing, they must be switched immediately to full power mode. The move to virtualization, which makes better use of the CPU's capacity, means there is less idle, aka low power, time for the CPUs.\" Traclcing Your SME's Assets Continued from Page 1 inventory in the first place,\" he continues. In a more practical vein, he suggests using an auto-discovery tool to get an idea of what is on the network. (See the \"Auto Discovery 'Fingerprints' Network Tools\" sidebar for more information.) Once policies are in place, new technolo- gies can help both to prevent laptop theft (as a deterrent) and to mitigate damages should a laptop go missing. For home office situations, products can provide a strong deterrent and help police both recov- er stolen computers and prosecute thieves. \"With the advent of so many mobile devices, the issue and concern expands to Just as parents are urged to fingerprint children, Eric Nelson, director of business development at Alteritech (www.alteritech.com), suggests using Nmap (Network Mapper; nmap.org) or another open-source tool to \"fingerprint\" or identify what's on an SIVIE's network. \"For larger, multisite companies, the more robust open-source IT tools, like Zenoss Enterprise, have very nice CIVIDB capabilities,\" he says. Be warned that auto-discovery tools only see what is on the network at any given time or over a period of time. \"This doesn't address the 'backup' and unused inventory other devices containing corporate data like BlackBerrys,\" Nelson notes. Protect Your Information \"Full-disk encryption is a great first start,\" says Natalie Lambert, senior analyst for security technology with Forrester. She ad- vises protecting the machine against loss and theft and then using encryption as a primary measure to put in place much tighter data protection technologies. \"Full-disk encryp- tion will protect the organization against a data breach in the case of a stolen or lost lap- top,\" she explains. \"This is not a full data- protection strategy, but it is an easy and cost- effective thing to go to get a checkbox next lying around that still may have important corpo- rate data on them,\" Nelson says. Don't stop with laptops. The concern expands to other devices containing corporate data such as BlackBerrys (www.rim.com), smartphones, and iPhones (www.apple.com). \"With Black- Berrys, you have much more control over lock- ing down the handset and controlling it remote- ly,\" Nelson says. Other devices relying on ActiveSync and other methods of syncing with corporate assets are much more problematic, with the iPhone being the most problematic of all,\" he says. to laptop loss.\" Data leak prevention, DRM (data rights management), and file encryp- tion will start to actually protect the data. Nelson advises locks for laptops, laptop cases, security cables, etc. \"If you are really paranoid, you can purchase motion-sensing alarms that will alert you when the item is being moved,\" he says. \"For laptops, get PC Radar. It is a device that attaches to the laptop and another mobile device that you put in your pocket. If they get too far away from each other, the alarm activates.\" Nelson also is high on tracking and recov- ery tools such as LoJack for Laptops, which \"phones home\" whenever it is on a network; The CyberAngel from CyberAngel Security Solutions (www.thecyberangel.com), which also encrypts the data on the hard drive; and zTrace Technologies' zControl (www.ztrace .com), which can be used to delete data after a laptop has been stolen, lock the keyboard and mouse, and flash a message letting the bad guys know they have been discovered. According to LoJack (www.lojack.com) more than 2 million laptops are stolen every year. That means the average user has a one- in-10 chance of having his laptop taken. The logical next step is finding the lost machine. New technology allows SMEs to track lap- tops regardless of location, recover those that go missing, and remotely delete sensitive information. This technology is readily avail- able and very cost-effective when measured against the cost of a data breach. Keep Tabs On Your Inventory From common-sense strategies to high- tech tools, the ability to deter notebook theft is well within the grasp of even the smallest business. Use cable locks while laptops are in offices or at home, take care to store laptops in car trunks when trans- porting them, and use nondescript cases rather than telltale laptop bags. If you have a large laptop population, take advantage of Internet-based tracking software to monitor their movements when outside company facilities. The first step is to determine the organi- zation's ability to audit where computers are and who is using them, Livingston says. Traditional IT asset management solutions can help keep track of computers that are in the office and connected to a corporate LAN. For mobile computers that go out- side the office, security experts advise using tracking software that leverages the Internet to follow computers as they go out in the field with salespeople or traveling executives. \"Such software can also help you deter- mine whether the antivirus products installed on mobile computers are up-to-date,\" Livingston says. \"If you don't know where your computers are, detecting when they are missing or stolen will be very difficult.\" Once you are able to accurately track computers regardless of location, employ- ees should be educated on the importance of immediately informing IT should they find that their computer is missing, security experts agree. With tracking and recovery software installed, IT can then take the nec- essary action — whether it is remotely delet- ing information or working with police to physically recover the computer.

Admins are hit doubly hard as they face the increasingly expensive strug- gle of how to back up and archive surging bits of data. According to Liebert (www.liebert.com), the annual power cost of data centers in the United States can be as high as $3.3 billion. Liebert also cites a 2007 survey by Data Center Users Group, which said 46% of data center managers in a survey said power limitations represented the main impediment to growth. More intelligent storage management is one way to take a chunk out of how much electricity your data center and network infrastructure are consuming. Doing that involves finding better ways to manage existing storage while reducing excess capacity. \"With storage holding the third most power-consuming technology in most data centers (after cooling and servers), small to medium-sized businesses have a lot to gain from improving their storage power usage,\" says Dave Garrels, marketing programs Best Tip: ILM Offers More Than Just Power Savings ILM (information lifecycle management) can offer a comprehensive approacli for data management while reducing power con- sumption. A major component of ILIVI in- volves distinguishing between data that must be readily accessible and data that just needs to be archived. \"[Using ILIVI] to develop procedures to move data to the most appropriate storage tier is relatively easy and yields quick returns,\" says Ron Lloyd, manager of storage product mar- keting at ElVIC (www.emc.com). \"Other tech- niques like thin provisioning can drive up storage utilization and save energy, as well. Deduplication of backup data can reduce backup requirements and costs by a consid- erable margin.\" manager in the StorageWorks Division at HP (www.hp.com). Take Stock Admins today are required to have some kind of storage plan, but most do not have the perfect system in place without room for improvement. For those without a sound plan, power consumption and other con- straints mean it is no longer viable to just ensure that data worth being archived is merely secure and retrievable. Coming up with a i i k » more power-efficient plan \\ % \\ involves creating a long-term storage plan and strategy. \"With growth in the amount of data to be stored increasing at an average of 60% per year, it's no longer possible to sim- ply keep doing the same old thing: buying more of the same storage, deploying it, managing it, and backing it up,\" says Ron Lloyd, manager of storage product marketing at EMC (www.emc.com). \"Finding ways to effectively use a variety of storage media and matching the right storage to the application require- ments can yield greater re- source utilization while reduc- ing operational costs.\" Coming up with a plan in- volves taking a big-picture look at your SME's storage infrastructure and what your data center's needs are now and will be in the future. \"Perhaps the most important action is to make a careful assessment of exactly what's in place today, evaluate future requirements, and develop a long-term strategy for man- aging storage growth,\" Lloyd says. \"This proactive approach can help preclude short- term emergencies and fixes.\" Solutions exist that help to determine where and how storage capacity is best used. Software, for example, can help to eliminate redundant capacity by automati- cally gauging storage needs to improve capacity utilization, Garrels says. \"[With capacity management software], businesses have seen doubled capacity utilization efficiency and savings of up to 45% on power,\" he notes. Get Rid Of Dead Capacity Reducing power consumption can involve something as basic as storing more data on high-capacity disks. Given that the amount of power required to spin the mechanical heads on disks does not vary much from one disk to another, power consumption is similar regardless of whether a disk has ter- abytes or megabytes of capacity. \"The power consumption of a single 160GB hard disk drive is about the same as a single 1TB drive. In this case, powering one large device will save considerable power over powering six smaller devices simultaneously,\" says Michael Howe, CTO and co-founder of IT in Canada (www.itin canada.ca). \"Much less heat would be gen- erated, which means less cooling cost, so there is greater energy savings here, too.\" Consolidating storage onto higher-capaci- ty disks can offer power savings by eliminat- ing excess data capacity. This is where the argument to opt for centralized storage to replace direct-area storage comes into play. \"Many small and midsized companies are still primarily using direct-attached storage in individual servers; this spreads data across isolated servers and results in an inefficient use of capacity and ultimately higher costs to run and manage,\" Garrels says. \"Consoli- dating data into network storage improves efficiency because disk spindles become shared resources for multiple servers.\" Page 11 Indeed, isolated storage is often cited as a principle energy problem in the SME space, EMC's Lloyd says. \"Unlike large data cen- ters, the small data center is far more likely to utilize storage that is dedicated to individ- ual servers, which makes it very difficult to use storage efficiently,\" he notes. \"Studies show that direct-attached storage typically yields between 25 to 30% capacity utiliza- tion, with most of the energy used to spin empty disks. Consolidating this storage via shared network infrastructure can yield over- all capacity utilization of 70 to 80%, ensuring considerable savings on energy costs.\" Make Existing Technology Work Squeezing power savings out of your data center and network does not require making hefty investments. Doing more with existing technology is a good start, Howe says. \"We might try utilizing compression software to pack more onto the same amount of disk space. This may increase data-access time due to the extra processing required to uncompress,\" he says. \"Another option might be to move infre- quently accessed data to another storage medium, such as tape, which uses very little power (depending on how implement- ed) when it's not in use.\" Uake It Virtual Using storage virtualization represents another way to save power, and the technology can also improve the overall effi- ciency of your data center's operations. \"Storage virtualization soft- ware . . . can help increase the utilization of storage and reduce requirements for addi- tional storage in the future, which can help reduce the total amount of storage required and so helps reduce energy use,\" says Ron Riffe, storage soft- ware product manager at IBM Tivoli (www.ibm.com). Storage virtualization software can help improve the overall flexibility and respon- siveness of an entire IT infrastructure by helping to more quickly meet the constraints of new business requirements, Riffe notes. \"Using [storage virtualization software] . . . to virtualize storage can help improve stor- age utilization, can help control storage growth, and can help improve application availability by enabling configuration changes such as data movement without dis- ruption to servers,\" Riffe says. \"Because [storage virtualization software] . . . central- izes management of storage and manages supported storage in a common manner, it can help improve the productivity of storage administrators. Finally, [storage virtualiza- tion software] . . . implements common replication functions that operate in the same way for all supported storage systems.\" 1 Networking & VPN ! March 14, 2008 Save Your Servers Automatically Restart With WM Software's ShutdownPlus Rolling Restart 7.0 A RESTART SCHEDULE is important with servers that run 24/7. Servers can become slower over time due to improper cleaning of registries and closing of user sessions. With users who stay logged on, you'll want to make sure they don't get locked out when the server reboots. ShutdownPlus Rolling Restart 7.0 from WM Software runs on all versions of Windows Server OSes and helps automatically log off users, close registries. and shut down/restart servers without requir- ing IT staff to sched- ule server restarts around users' time commitments. ShutdownPlus Rolling Restart is de- signed to shut down terminal servers on a round-robin schedule through a hub-and- spoke model, so one server is the master and the others are member servers. The ShutdownPlus Rolling Restart 7.0 can automatically reboot sen/ers without affecting users. master server selects a member server to restart, disables that server's logons, and then restarts the serv- er. Once the member server has been re- started, logons are re- enabled, and the mas- ter server moves on to the next server. Users will receive a notifica- tion that their server will be restarted, and the master server can force log-offs imme- diately or after a defined time. The member server must wait until all users are logged off before restarting, and ShutdownPlus 7.0 features a Silent Mode to skip servers and retry later if users are still logged on. When logons are forced on a server set to restart, the software's load bal- ancing can automatically place the user on another server. It's compatible with Citrix.

While reducing energy has a positive effect on the planet, corpora- tions big and small are feeling the effect that high energy costs have on their bottom line — and data centers are no different. By design, data centers have been a clus- ter of power-rich, energy-guzzling, IT- related infrastructure that organizations have grown to depend on. Arguably, the cost of running a data center has more to do with energy consumption than the cost of the hardware itself. In fact, worldwide, the cost of data center power consumption is expected to exceed $7 billion annually. As data centers continue to have increas- ing power-related demands placed on them, managers are finding themselves in an interesting dilemma: They need to provide increasingly more power and services but must improve operating expenses, reduce energy costs, and improve the bottom line. Data centers are therefore moving toward using power-conscious and energy-efficient products to meet these goals. Power-conscious products consist of those products that are aware of the power needs in the data center and react accord- ingly. Power-conscious products can be hardware or software that a data center uses to help manage power distribution levels in the data center. Energy-efficient products are typically hardware products that by ■ DUALCOM s820 is an intelligent, power-conscious PDU from Cyber Switching (408/436-9830; www.cyberswitching .com) that offers data centers the ability to shed loads during specified time periods to reduce energy consumption and operational costs. Replacing existing power supplies with the energy-efficient alternatives ColdWatt (www.coldwatt.com) offers can help data centers save thousands of dollars in energy costs. design are efficient in their use of energy, contributing to the overall need of the data center to consume less power. Manufac- turers of data center-related products are rising to the challenge and developing power-conscious or energy-efficient prod- ucts that can help. Here are a few of those products that data cen- ters are using to reduce their energy costs and improve their bottom line. Cyber Switching PDUs Data center managers rely on PDUs (power distribution units) to ensure the uptime of server, storage, network, and other de- vices in the data center. Cyber Switching (408/436-9830; www .cyberswitching.com), in San Jose, Calif., offers energy-effi- cient intelligent PDUs, such as the DUALCOM 820, with load- shedding capabilities that allow granular control during defined demand/response periods. Man- agers can define specific outlets as noncritical and configure them to be turned off during specific time periods or events. The Cyber Switching devices are power-conscious and allow a data center manager to further control the way in which power is used in the facility, ultimately improving the data center's oper- ational expenses. ColdWatt Power Supplies Based out of Austin, Tex- as, ColdWatt (www.coldwatt .com) provides data center managers the ability to cut their energy costs by replacing existing power supplies with ColdWatt's more energy-efficient alternative power supplies. According to ColdWatt, a server that requires 200 watts of electricity will actually use more if it is outfitted with a traditional power supply. For example, it will burn up 96 watts through power conversion alone, and 193 watts will go toward cooling the machine and in reality use more than 500 watts of energy. However, with a high-efficient Cold- Watt alternative power supply, only 24 watts of electricity are needed for power conversion and 106 watts for cooling. According to ColdWatt, a data center with 400 servers could realize a savings of $50,000 by replacing existing power supplies with its more energy-efficient alternatives. Cassatt Power Management According to San Jose, Calif., -based Cassatt (www.cassatt.com), its Active Response software product line uses a patent-pending technology called Active Power Management that monitors server resources, whether they are physical or virtual, and determines how they can be used most efficiently. By using config- urable policies, the resources can be pow- ered up and down as needed, while taking into account such considerations as time of day, resource demand, and power-use pat- terns. Cassatt says its software can assist a data center at significantly lowering its energy costs by as much as 50% at times. Dell Servers Every data center has a plethora of servers providing computing power to its users. Historically, servers have been one of the larger consumers of power in a data center, but that's now starting to change. Dell (www.dell.com) has improved its PowerEdge models to be more efficient by using energy-efficient multicore pro- cessors, fans, and power supplies. Though March 21, 2008 the servers cost more than regular models, the savings can be significant, and a data center can potentially save hundreds of dollars per server in reduced annual energy costs. Dell isn't the only server manufac- turer rising to this challenge; Sun Micro- systems (www.sun.com), IBM (www.ibm .com), and HP (www.hp.com) are also making their server platforms more ener- gy-efficient. Data Aire Cooling Systems You couldn't properly discuss efforts to reduce the energy costs in a data center without talking about cooling systems. Data center cooling systems them- selves consume a good deal of energy in their effort to keep data center equipment at just the right temperature so that it functions optimally. Data Aire (www. data aire.com), based out of Orange, Calif., specializes in energy-effi- cient products for data centers, including floor-mounted units, heat exchangers, ceiling-mounted units, and system controls. It also offers several monitoring options that can help data center managers monitor the efficiency of the data center's cooling systems, helping reduce unnecessary ener- gy consumption. Data Aire's DX Series comes equipped with features such as the Data Alarm Processor-II mi- croprocessor control, dual-scroll compressor, and steam generator humidifiers. The series offers state-of-the-art environmental con- trol and is designed for either upflow or downflow air discharge in air-cooled or water/glycol- cooled DX systems from 6 to 30 nominal tons. Nexsan Storage Data centers have a plethora of storage needs that, very often, add significantly to the increasing and overwhelming demand for power. Nexsan (www.nexsan.com), headquartered in Thousand Oaks, Calif., embraces energy efficiency as a competitive advantage and offers a broad range of technologically advanced, secure storage solutions that are energy-efficient. AutoMaid, a Nexsan energy-saving tech- nology, reduces power consumption by placing the storage drives into an idle state when they are not being used. AutoMaid offers the benefits of MAID (massive array of idle disks) without the limitations of slow access times. AutoMaid can be con- figured for a specific drive or for a com- plete RAID drive set. It also has multiple configurations so an organization can bal- ance access speed and energy savings to implement a configuration that is ideal for its environment.
