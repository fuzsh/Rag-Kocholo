        "text": "Keep An Eye Out For These Players In the Mobility Industry\n\nWhen CRN set out to look at how major channel-facing vendors are honing their mobility strategies for our mobility issue, we based our discussion on a few dominant trends. First, smartphones and tablet PCs are here to stay. Second, the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) phenomenon is very real: IT managers throughout the world must now wrestle with how to enable, optimize and secure mobile devices their employees are choosing themselves. Third, there’s a legitimate channel play behind the types of challenges those first two trends are creating, and that’s why when we talk about different products like Cisco’s Cius or Wyse’s Pocket Cloud, or the latest RIM BlackBerry or Google Android phones, or the mobile security reach of Symantec or Webroot, we’re having, at a macro-level at least, the same discussion.\n\nThe vendors and channel partners that can connect all those dots will be the big winners in the mobile era. Here are just a few.\n\n2X Software\n\n2X focuses on server-based computing. Key products include ThinClientServer for Windows and Linux for management and configuration; ApplicationServer XG; and LoadBalancer for Terminal Services.\n\nAcer\n\nComputer giant Acer is throwing old PC conventions out the window and is bringing a tablet to the market set to rival all major players. The Iconia A500, which runs Google Android, is a true contender.\n\nAdobe\n\nAdobe is best known for its Flash multimedia software and online marketing apps. But a key product in the mobility world is Adobe Connect, a Flash-based live meeting and videoconferencing application.\n\nAMD\n\nThe world’s second-largest chip maker earlier this year introduced its Fusion APUs, which combine CPU and GPU functionality on a single chip, and launched the Fusion A-Series chips for high-performance notebooks and laptops.\n\nAppcelerator\n\nAppcelerator provides development tools and services that help Web developers build applications once and deploy them on mobile devices, tablets and desktop computers based on disparate architectures.\n\nApple\n\nThe mobility revolution market leader. No other company has had a bigger impact on computing in the 21st century. First the iPhone sets the standard for smartphones. Then the iPad single-handledly creates the tablet market.\n\nARM Holdings\n\nThe British semiconductor firm has seen its business explode thanks to the mobile device boom. ARM’s mobile chip architectures like the Cortex-A9 are licensed to various vendors and used for such devices as Apple’s iPad.\n\nAruba Networks\n\nAruba’s innovative MOVE (Mobile Virtual Enterprise) architecture leverages a set of Aruba mobility products that provide context-aware networking for enterprises’ mobile infrastructure.\n\nAsigra\n\nAsigra was one of the first to offer technology to allow partners to build enterprise-class cloud storage infrastructures and was also one of the first to offer mobile apps to access cloud storage.\n\nAT&T/T-Mobile\n\nThe combination of these two wireless powerhouses makes for a major mobile monster. Boasting the nation’s fastest mobile broadband network, AT&T (including T-Mobile once the merger gets the OK) is one to beat in mobility.\n\nAT&T Backup And Go\n\nBackup and Go offers automated online backup with unlimited storage per PC. Data can be accessed from any Web-connected computer or mobile device for viewing, downloading and sharing of files.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco’s best horse in the mobility race may be Cius, the Android tablet with on-board security controls it’s intending for use as a unified communications endpoint, capable of everything from on-the-go videoconferencing to VDI.\n\nCitrix\n\nAn early player in desktop virtualization, Citrix is now also a major server virtualization player. It is leading the Xen open-source hypervisor project by virtue of its 2007 acquisition of XenSource.\n\nCloud Engines\n\nCloud Engines is the maker of the popular Pogoplug device that lets users create their own ’personal cloud,’ letting them access content through the Web or a connected device. The company’s Pogoplug Biz is a winner.\n\nDell\n\nOne of the largest computer makers in the market, Dell built an empire with its Inspiron laptops and XPS high-performance notebooks. Now Dell is seeking success with smaller devices like the Streak tablets and Venue smartphones.\n\nDigium\n\nDigium is winning raves for Switchvox Mobile, which takes many of the best features of its Switchvox open-source VoIP-PBX system and extends them for mobile device use. Digium has added fixed mobile convergence to Switchvox.\n\nDropBox\n\nDropBox provides cloud storage for iOS, Android and BlackBerry mobile devices. It gives third parties tools to develop apps to take advantage of its cloud storage, and offers a developer’s kit for adding DropBox to other services.\n\nEricom Software\n\nEricom positions itself as an alternative to Citrix. It focuses on application delivery for server-based computing environments. It also offers HTML5 client for accessing VMware View virtual desktops.\n\nF-Secure\n\nF-Secure is focusing on protecting mobile data with a comprehensive mobile security product that has an array of sophisticated features such as Web-browsing alerts and protection, and a new remote GPS tracking feature.\n\nFujitsu\n\nFujitsu is staking its claim to the mobility crown with its own take on the tablet, but Fujitsu is calling its LifeBooks a true ’business-oriented’ tablet for the mobile workforce, not the consumer- focused tablets of the competition.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle is a cloud and mobility tour de force. Whether it’s Google Apps Mobile or the ever-evolving Google Android mobile platform for smartphones and for tablets, Google is making being tethered to a desk a thing of the past.\n\nHewlett-Packard\n\nHP is in the mobility ring throwing punches like a hungry heavyweight. The world’s largest IT vendor has all its guns focused on mobility and has brought game-changing innovation to the mobility market in 2011.\n\nIntel\n\nThe world’s largest chip maker dominated the netbook market with the Atom family of low-power processors. Now Intel is taking Atom to the tablet market with its new Oak Trail architecture, and also developing higher end laptops.\n\nKaspersky Lab\n\nAs one of the first antivirus vendors to offer a mobile security product, Kaspersky is now breaking new ground with security in the mobile tablet space with a security product that targets the proliferation of Android malware.\n\nKensington\n\nThe company’s KeyFolio keyboard for the iPad is a winner. Add that to a long list of sleek, smart, well-designed products for the mobile marketplace and you have a new world mobility peripherals market leader.\n\nLenovo\n\nFamous for its ThinkPad brand of business-class notebooks, Lenovo updated its ThinkPad product line with entries like the SMB-focused notebook called the X1 as well as a new Android-based ThinkPad tablet.\n\nMcAfee\n\nMcAfee is playing hard in the mobile management space, integrating a slew of mobile security offerings such as antimalware and authentication with its ePolicy Orchestrator platform, which ensures compliancy.\n\nMeLLmo\n\nMeLLmo developed the Roambi mobile graphics and visualization application for accessing corporate systems, including BI systems such as SAP Business Objects, Crystal Reports, IBM Cognos and Microsoft Reporting Services.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft is counting on its Windows Phone 7 mobile operating system to help it regain market share as it competes against Apple iOS and Google Android in the mobile operating system arena.\n\nMotorola Solutions\n\nMotorola is the standard for industrial-strength, business-class mobility solutions. It’s hard to find another vendor with as many solutions in vertical markets. It also invests heavily in cutting-edge cloud solutions.\n\nMozy\n\nMozy was a pioneer in online data protection for consumers but since its acquisition by EMC, it has expanded rapidly into the SMB market. Its app provides secure file access as well as centralized administrator controls.\n\nNvidia\n\nA graphics card powerhouse, Nvidia moved beyond GPU technology with the development of its Tegra system-on-a-chip platform for both smartphones and tablets. Tegra combines CPU and GPU functionality on a single chip.\n\nQualcomm\n\nThe wireless telecom company has made waves with its Snapdragon system-on-a-chip platform, which can be found in many leading smartphones.
