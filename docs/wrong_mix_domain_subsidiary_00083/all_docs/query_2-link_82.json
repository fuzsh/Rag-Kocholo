You can capture an image or video. You can access your history of captures. Click on more to access preferences, help and to send feedback.\n\nSome annoyances/bugs in this beta is that Jing.exe takes a lot of CPU without doing anything.

ALM was first included in Acrobat 8 for the Windows operating system. ALM is based on FLEXnet from Macrovision but the experience was not good so Adobe is working to find another solution.\n\nALM was rolled out in Adobe® Acrobat® 8 for Windows to our volume license customers worldwide. However, during the subsequent three months, we have learned that ALM requires a greater level of administrator resources than many of our customers have available to them. In some instances, there have also been difficulties in managing certain customer workflows and requirements.\n\nAs a result, we have decided to disable the ALM technology in Acrobat 8 for all new volume license copies sold after March 9, 2007. Effective immediately, all Acrobat 8 for Windows installation media will be provided with ALM disabled. The final date for availability of ALM-related processes on the Adobe Licensing Website is April 9, 2007.\n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/elicensing/licensemanagement/alm/\n\nPS. If you do have ALM it is possible to have it running together with network licenses from other vendors like Autodesk. JTB FlexReport is also supporting it.\n\nThis VBA sample shows how to use ObjectDBX to get information from multiple drawings without opening them. You need to have an AutoCAD based application installed though. Here block names are listed but other things can be done with ObjectDBX like making changes to the drawings in different ways.

One good thing is that a PDF Preview Handler is included so you can look at PDF files directly within Outlook 2007. The viewer is very basic and it is not much you do. I directly missed being able to zoom in and zoom out but a workaround is to resize the message window.\n\nThe first time you click on a PDF file it takes a few seconds but after that the viewer fires up in less than a second.\n\nIt also works in Windows Explorer\n\nNew features in Adobe Acrobat 8.1\n\nNew operating system support:\n\nWindows XP 64-bit edition\n\nWindows 2003 64-bit edition\n\nWindows Vista 32-bit and 64-bit editions\n\nNote: There is a known issue with 64-bit versions of these operating systems which causes the Adobe PDF Printer to not work correctly. Microsoft has released a Hot Fix for this issue which is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article #930627 available at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930627. Adobe has tested and will support the Adobe PDF Printer with this Hot Fix installed.\n\nNew features:\n\nVista Preview Handler: Preview Handler is a new user interface for viewing PDF files in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 on Windows Vista and Windows XP, as well as in Windows Explorer on Windows Vista. Preview Handler must be turned on in both applications.\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 support.\n\nPDF printer driver in Vista supports high quality PDF creation.\n\nPDFMaker Office 2007 PDF Creation.\n\nOption to create Quick and Simple PDFs from Word 2007.\n\nNew PDFMaker Ribbon UI in Office 2007.\n\nMac OS X version now includes Flash MPP for improved support for Flash files with multimedia on Mac OS.\n\nInDesign Plug-In update supports communication with InDesign for Creative Suites 3.\n\nOption to print documents to a FedEx Kinko?s office in the USA.

You don't want it 594x841. You also want the offset to be correct and no white margins.\n\nIn this example I use Adobe Acrobat 8 Professional.\n\nThis is what you get when you select the A1 paper size. Notice the red rectangle that is not rotated correctly.\n\nWhat you need to do is the following.\n\nClick on Properties...\n\nThis will show the Plotter Configuration Editor.\n\nSelect the tab Device and Document Settings.\n\nFind Custom Properties in the tree view.\n\nClick on the button Custom Properties.\n\nIn the dialog box Adobe PDF Document Properties select the tab Adobe PDF Settings.\n\nYou will see Adobe PDF Page Size. Click on the Add... button.\n\nEither add a new page size or change an existing. A1 cannot be changed since it is not user defined.\n\nI added a A1 landscape page size to have the width 841 and the height 594 in millimeters.\n\nWhen you after that comes to the dialog box Changes to a Printer Configuration File you can select to save the changes to Adobe PDF.pc3.\n\nNow it looks better.\n\nAnd the result will be as expected.\n\nOn the other hand if you want to use the build in DWG to PDF.pc3 that comes with AutoCAD 2007 and AutoCAD 2008 you will not get the result you expect.\n\nFirst I had to Modify the ISO A1 (841.00 x 594.00 MM) paper size and set the margins to 0.\n\nThe preview looks great.\n\nBut the resulting PDF will not be located correctly. It is offset up to the right and I have not found a way to solve this. PLOTOFFSET 1 or 0 does not affect the result.\n\nWhen I tried the same with the freeware PrimoPDF I had no problem to get the expected result.\n\nThe same applies to other paper sizes than A1.\n\nFrom the press release:\n\nAbout the book:\n\nThe new AutoCAD 2008 and AutoCAD LT 2008 Bible, the 8th edition of Ellen Finkelstein’s indispensable reference-tutorial book, is a comprehensive guide to the latest AutoCAD 2008 and AutoCAD LT 2008 releases.\n\nPublished by Wiley, this “Bible” brings veterans up to speed on the latest features and brings novices from the basics right up to programming in AutoLISP and VBA. Some Autodesk employees even keep a copy at their desks.\n\nThe Quick Start tutorial starts beginners with real-world work immediately. Following chapters cover the basics of creating drawings, complete 2D and 3D drawing techniques, using data in drawings, managing drawings, customization, and programming.\n\nThe book includes a DVD with before and after drawings for each tutorial, collected from AutoCAD professionals. The DVD also contains a 30-day trial version of AutoCAD 2008 and AutoCAD LT 2008, the entire text of the book in a searchable PDF format, and a selection of valuable add-on programs.\n\n“Whether you’re new to AutoCAD or a veteran, you will undoubtedly find this book to be an excellent resource,” Abhi Singh, AutoCAD Product Manager, Autodesk, Inc.\n\nAutoCAD 2008 and AutoCAD LT 2008 Bible (ISBN 978-0-470-12049-1, 1251 pages, $49.99) is available in bookstores, from Amazon.com, from Wiley.com, as well as from the author’s Web site at EllenFinkelstein.com.\n\nI've not read it but I suggest taking a look at Ellen's blog or her website and see if you like what you read there. If you do it's good chance you find this book valuable.\n\nVia AutoCAD Tips Blog\n\nJTB FlexReport 3.4 has now been released.\n\nThe big news is support for email notifications when specified thresholds are reached for the license usage of network licenses based on Macrovision's FLEXlm/FLEXnet.\n\nAnother addition is full support for features or modules that uses license tokens. One example of usage is to get a report on total monthly Token-hours per user or a group of users.\n\nOther than that there are new detailed reports as well as other under the hood performance improvements.\n\nReport for Concurrent Usage Per Day or Month with Max usage, Min usage, Avg usage and Standard deviation.\n\nHere is some background on token based licenses. This is a license that includes a pool of tokens (say 20) and a bunch of software modules. Each module has a certain token value. Each time a user wants to use one of modules the License manager sees if there is sufficient tokens in the pool. So for example, if 20 users wanted to use software \"AAA\" and this software AAA had a token value of 1 then there would be no problem since the total simultaneous token usage does not exceed 20. When each users stops using the software the token is returned to the token pool for use elsewhere.\n\nWhat the License Owner wants to do is to determine on a monthly basis how many \"Token-Hours\" each user used. So for example if it was AAA which has a value of 1 token and the users used that at various days during the month for a total of 10 hours then there would be 10 Token-Hours for that user. If instead of AAA lets say this user used BBB which let us say has a token value of 2. So for the same 10 hours we would see a Token-Hour total for this user of 20 hours (i.e., 10 hours X token value of 2). If another user used AAA for 5 hours and BBB for 10 Hours then the total Token Hours would be 25 for that user.\n\nThis is a quick test of plotting a test drawing (87 KB) to different formats using AutoCAD 2008.\n\nI pasted some cells from Excel 2007 as OLE objects into a drawing and used different printers and plotted to different formats and here is the result.\n\nPrinter Screen capture of result File size Text quality File Adobe PDF using Acrobat 8 Professional 57 KB As text Download PDF PrimoPDF 25 KB As text Download PDF DWG To PDF.pc3 included with AutoCAD 2008 216 KB As graphic Download PDF DWF6 ePlot.pc3 included with AutoCAD 2008 76 KB As graphic Download DWF Microsoft XPS Document Writer included with Windows Vista 112 KB As text Download XPS\n\nAs you can see the winner in this specific test was PrimoPDF a great free PDF printer. The size was the smallest and the text is still text in the PDF file and is searchable.\n\nFeel free to print the test drawing yourself using your favorite printer software and format and add a comment on the result."
