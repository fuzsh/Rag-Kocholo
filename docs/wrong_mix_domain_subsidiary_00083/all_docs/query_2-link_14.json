        "text": "Background\n\nWhen the NBAR engine generates a block based on a configured Layer 7 Firewall rule, the Dashboard event log is populated with events that look like the following example:\n\nWhen looking at such an event, there are two key details that can be referenced to determine why the block occurred:\n\nClassification: this value indicates the rule configured on Dashboard that triggered the block.\n\nNBAR ID: this value indicates the internal rule the NBAR engine matched the traffic to, based on specific factors within the Layer 7 (Application) payload in the packet(s) in question.\n\nNOTE: DNS traffic (TCP/UDP Port 53) may also get blocked by Layer 7 rules if it contains a query for a domain the rule in question covers.\n\nFor example, you may see a block on UDP port 53 classified as \"abc.com\" if the \"All News\" rule is configured on Dashboard, and a user device sends a DNS query for said domain."
