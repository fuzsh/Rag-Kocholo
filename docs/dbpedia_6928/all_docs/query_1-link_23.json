        "text": "Edited By No_Name_\n\nIf you don't already know about them, the Saturn Awards are kind of a big deal; particularly in the science fiction community. They are held annually by the Academy of Science Fiction Fantasy and Horror Films, and are pretty cool since they recognize all the hard work that goes into, for example, super hero movies. This year was no exception; in fact, Marvel's 'Iron Man' and Warner Brothers' 'The Dark Knight' won in virtually every category.\n\nChristopher Nolan took home the most awards that evening for 'The Dark Knight.' The Batman film took home Best Action Adventure Thriller Film, Best Writing (Christopher and Jonathan Nolan), Best Supporting Actor (Heath Ledger), Best Music (Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard), and Best Special Effects.\n\nThe Marvel produced ' Iron Man ' won in a big way, as well! 'Iron Man' took home three of the ten awards that Marvel was nominated for. Amongst them, 'Iron Man' took home awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor (Robert Downey Jr.,) and Bet Director (Jon Favreau). This must be a huge boost for both Downey and Favreau, as they are presently working on the sequel to their very successful film, Iron Man. It was also great to see that Ledger once again was nominated and won the award for his outstanding supporting role as 'Joker' in 'The Dark Knight.' Perhaps these awards, (particularly for best writing,) will be the nudge that Nolan needs to convince him to start working on the third Batman film that know so many of us are\n\nlooking forward to. Time will only tell. What do you guys think? I think that having the Saturn Awards is a fantastic way to recognize all the hard work and the achievements in a time where so many films are comic book related and often, don't receive the recognition they deserve from the Academy Awards or Golden Globes. What do you guys think? Do you think that having won these awards, Nolan will be more inclined to work on a third 'Batman' film? Do you feel that 'Iron Man' deserved those awards? Are you upset that ' Hulk ' got shafted?\n\n#6 Edited By No_Name_\n\n@Decept-O said:\n\n\" It is great that the super hero comic book movies are receiving further recognition, especially amongst the Sci-Fi community as well, this gives additional verification that super hero movies CAN be done right!!! Whether Noland and Co. will continue though is hard to say. Again it would be sad if they weren't involved in a third and/or fourth Batman film. If someone else takes the helm let's just hope it is of the same caliber as the previous 2 films. I hope IM 2 will rock it hard again. \"\n\nI've heard nothing but really good things about Iron Man 2. I also agree that I think it' just great that comic book movies are getting the recognition that they deserve. :)"
