Collateral.)\n\nAll Tom Cruise Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer\n\nCollateral celebrates its 20th anniversary!\n\nFrom his teen idol days in the early ’80s to his status as a marquee-lighting leading man today, Tom Cruise has consistently done it all for decades — he’s completed impossible missions, learned about Wapner time in Rain Man, driven the highway to the danger zone in Top Gun, and done wonders for Bob Seger’s royalty statements in Risky Business, to offer just a few examples. Mr. Cruise is one of the few honest-to-goodness film stars left in the Hollywood firmament, so whether you’re a hardcore fan or just interested in a refresher course on his filmography, we’re here to take a fond look back at a truly impressive career and rank all Tom Cruise movies.\n\n#1\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) 97%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 122009%\n\nCritics Consensus: Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible - Fallout lives up to the \"impossible\" part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.\n\nSynopsis: Ethan Hunt and the IMF team join forces with CIA assassin August Walker to prevent a disaster of epic proportions....
