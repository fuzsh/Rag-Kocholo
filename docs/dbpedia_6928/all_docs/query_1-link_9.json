The larger the cast and the more settings a story has can limit which theatre companies have the resources for production. Playwrights should take a minimalist approach to their stage plays. Every character and setting should have a purpose. If it doesn‚Äôt, it should be removed.

If you are a big fan of musicals, then you'll love this one. However, I personally feel like musicals are a thing of the past. This movie could have benefitted from bold acting and strong emotions rather than music and dancing that sometimes felt forced or out of place. I will always appreciate the plot of the movie as it was created back in 1985, but this new version could have been executed better... not as a musical. What do you think? Are musicals in or out?
