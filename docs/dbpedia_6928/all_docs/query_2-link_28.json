Workshops and creative exercises, guided by leading film composers and sound designers acting as Creative Advisors, will mentor Fellows to explore sound and music’s crucial role in storytelling. As part of the Lab, a live chamber orchestra will perform each composer/director team’s original scores. The Music and Sound Design Lab will run from July 9-22 as a joint initiative of the Institute’s Film Music Program, Feature Film Program and Documentary Film Program.\n\n“We received applications from over 700 talented artists this year and had the extremely difficult job of choosing eight Fellows. We are happy to announce our outstandingly talented, diverse and international group of composers comprised of artists representing Cuba, Hong Kong, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the U.K., and the U.S.,” said Peter Golub, Director of the Sundance Film Music Program, “Working with sound designers and both fiction and documentary filmmakers, we will explore the different ways that music and sound contribute to the storytelling process of filmmaking.”\n\nCreative Advisors this year include: James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, Ken Kwapis, Miriam Cutler, Marco Beltrami, Randy Thom, Brooke Wentz, Christophe Beck, Harry Gregson-Williams, Adam Smalley, Fil Eisler, Tony Morales and Doreen Ringer-Ross.\n\nSkywalker Sound Designers include Bob Edwards, Pete Horner, Dennis Leonard, Richard Gould, Baihui Yang, Kim Patrick, Stephen Urata and Alyssa Nevarez, as well as Music Editor Jonathon Stevens.\n\n“Peter and the Sundance team are like family, we’re delighted to have them back again this year for the Labs,” said Josh Lowden, VP and General Manager of Skywalker Sound. “What we’ve tried to cultivate here is a kind of artists’ colony, where creatives from different disciplines can escape the day to day grind and come to work together. Our goal is to cultivate new relationships between directors, composers and sound designers and encourage collaboration that starts earlier and goes deeper. We hope that together we can continue to break down barriers and push the boundaries of creative storytelling.”\n\nArtists and projects selected for the 2019 Sundance Institute Music and Sound Design Lab are:\n\nComposers:\n\nDirectors/Filmmakers & Projects:\n\nThe Sundance Institute Film Music Program is supported by John S. and James L.
