        "text": "Known for his use of practical effects, innovation with IMAX cameras and collaborations with Michael Caine, Christopher Nolan has cemented himself as one of, if not the most, well known directors in Hollywood. The man gets a blank check for just about anything he wants to make, and given that Oppenheimer - a 3-hour R-rated biopic - just crossed 600 million (and counting) at the box office, it's easy to see why. He's personally my favourite movie director, and with the release of his latest film, I thought it would be interesting to go through his entire filmography and share my personal ranking of his movies, from worst to best. Though this should go without saying, this is a highly subjective list, and I'm interested in hearing everyone else's thoughts. Without further ado: let's start.\n\n12. Following\n\nFollowing is a 1998 neo-noir which served as the directorial debut of Christopher Nolan. With a budget of 6000 dollars, the movie is a far cry from the spectacle that came to define the director in later years. Yet, the film - which follows a screenwriter who begins stalking people for inspiration - is still very much a Christopher Nolan movie in many ways, and that's without a Michael Caine cameo or a visual centrepiece. The film's narrative is presented in a non-linear fashion, and it is a thriller. One that is quite dull and forgettable. Not bad, but one I didn't think about for one second after the credits rolled. That said, it's hard to hate the movie that gave us the gift of Christopher Nolan.\n\n11. Dunkirk\n\nThe year is 2017, and I'm dying to see Dunkirk, the upcoming Christopher Nolan-directed war epic. Unfortunately, the movie ends up being an utter disappointment, and subsequent rewatches have done nothing to change that. Though the visuals from Hoyte Van Hoytema and the pulse-pounding soundtrack of Hans Zimmer do as good a job as they can of emulating an atmosphere of fear and tension, it ends up being a cheap imitation, other than evoking a genuine feeling. After all, Nolan forgets that for tension to work, we need to care about the stakes, and given that every character in this movie is a soulless archetype, I wasn't at all invested in what happened. There are attempts at emotional pay-off, such as Barry Keoghan's character, but ultimately, it's all pay-off without earned set up.\n\n10. Tenet\n\nThough I was immensely disappointed in Dunkirk, that movie did little to extinguish my desire for more Nolan, and the hope that Tenet would be a return to form for the director. Well, fool me twice! The script that Christopher Nolan originally wrote for Inception was lacking in emotional depth, until DiCaprio came along and gave Nolan the input of imbuing it with character depth, and making it a personal story for Cobb. Tenet shows us a glimpse into what Inception might've looked like had DiCaprio never stepped in. Like Nolan's previous movie, Tenet served up an impeccable soundtrack and some interesting visuals, but neither of these technical strengths are enough to offset what is a fundamentally flawed and soulless screenplay, and one that is even more confusing than thought possible.\n\n9. The Dark Knight Rises\n\nI don't like using 'set up to fail' arguments, but given that Nolan had to contend with the pressure and responsibility of following up The Dark Knight, one of the most popular and successful movies ever made, it would've been hard to create a follow-up that didn't disappoint a considerable amount of people. That said, I refuse to believe this is the best effort Nolan could've mustered. I'm not one to pick on plot holes, but the amount of plot-holes and thinly-veiled writing in this movie is quite substantial, including the absolutely ridiculous notion that Joseph Gordon Levitt knew that Batman was Bruce Wayne because of a 'look on his eyes.' It's a bombastic movie, but one that feigns complexity as opposed to being genuinely complex. Despite this, it gave us Tom Hardy's Bane voice, an incredible Catwoman portrayal from Anne Hathaway and a terrific opening sequence, and for that I will be a little grateful.\n\n8. Insomnia\n\nOn the surface, Insomnia appears to be a typical thriller about two homicide detectives investigating a murder. That said, Insomnia is quite a solid execution of this archetype of film, powered by a fantastic lead performance from Al Pacino, and a chilling against-type showcase from the late, great Robin Williams. When the two share the screen, we get some of the movies best moments. Though a solid film, I would hesitate to call Insomnia a movie that I'm in love with. The movie is a little too indulgently dark for my liking, and the atmosphere of the movie is more than a little dull. In spite of that, it's still one I would recommend as a one-time watch, but not a movie I'm keen to ever revisit.\n\n7. The Prestige\n\nThe Prestige is a psychological thriller about two magicians, played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, who become consumed by a rivalry that consumes them and the lives of those around them. It is a solid movie with good rewatch value (I've watched it three times) and that is primarily because of the terrific, compelling dynamic between the two leads, who are also shouldered by a great supporting cast including Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and one of my favourite people to ever exist - David Bowie! Though it's an enjoyable, well-made movie, it has it's flaws. For a movie about obsession, it's lacking the intensity that can be found in a movie such as Whiplash, or even the disturbing, visceral nature of Black Swan - two movies that tackled the subject of obsession to more effective results. But perhaps it's biggest flaw is the final reveal, which betrays one of the most important screenwriting rules: of establishing your in-universe rules and committing to them.\n\n6. Batman Begins\n\nIt's easy to forget that Batman Begins is one of the most influential movies on modern cinema. It's darker and grittier reimagining of it's titular character was incredibly inventive, with the movie being cited as in influence on movies such as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men: First Class, Skyfall, Sherlock Holmes and The Amazing Spider-Man. It's easy to see why, as the movie breathed new life into a seemingly dead property. It's a defining movie of my childhood, and one that still holds up as a great example of how to execute a big screen origin story in a way that still functions well as it's own film, and not merely as a stepping stone to something bigger. It's lessons might've been executed even better in future superhero movies, but lest we forget that Batman Begins is the blueprint.\n\n5. Inception\n\nI'll never forgive myself for not watching this movie in cinemas when it first released, but when I watched it on Blu-Ray when it came out, I was mesmerised. Inception is a prime example of how to successfully execute a high-concept action thriller, in an industry full of squandered-ones (see: Justin Timberlake's In Time). It's a movie that generously offers one fantastic moment after the other: whether it's the terrific opening scene, or the rotating hallway. Yet Inception also works in large part because, as mentioned earlier, it's grounded in a compelling emotional story of a father and his love for his kids, and his grief over his dead wife. The movie culminates in one of the greatest endings in cinema, powered by one of the greatest pieces of music ever composed for a film: Time.\n\n4. Memento\n\nMemento is a thriller about a man with amnesia investigating the death of his wife. Yet the magic of the movie lays within the executing principle: which is one of the most unique I've come across throughout the entire art form. The movie is told in reverse-order, yet in the hands of a master storyteller such as Nolan (who based the narrative on a short story written by his brother), it doesn't become overly convoluted or gimmicky, instead becoming an effective storytelling tool that places you in the head of the protagonist. It is a compelling one of a kind thriller led by a fantastic Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, and culminates in a satisfying and terrific ending.\n\n3. Oppenheimer\n\nOn paper, a biography about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer could've fallen to the same traps that many other biopics have fallen to: overly talky, lacking in narrative structure and painstakingly slow. Yet thanks to incredible use of montage storytelling, editing, sound design, writing and a pulse-pounding soundtrack, Nolan created perhaps the most transportive biopic ever made, and one that is so full of dramatic heft, it could've easily been fiction. At the centre is a masterful performance from Cillian Murphy, whose mesmerising eye-acting alone is worthy of an Oscar, and is rounded out by a terrific cast, including a stunning display of character acting from Robert Downey Jr. It's a riveting masterpiece of a movie, and demonstrates a return from Nolan to his roots of characters and stories.\n\n2. Interstellar\n\nBeing a Christopher Nolan movie, it's no surprise that Interstellar fully utilises it's sound and visuals to create one of the most mesmerising and immersive portrayals of space travel put to the big screen. Yet the greatest strength of Interstellar isn't the second-to-none visuals or the unique sci-fi concepts, it's the poignant storytelling, which centres on the powerful relationship between a son and daughter. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Interstellar is the first movie I ever watched that brought me to tears, and for that, I will forever cherish the experience of watching it. Because in a story of space travel and worm holes, it features one of the most affecting stories I've encountered.\n\n1. The Dark Knight\n\nPraising The Dark Knight has become about as unoriginal as liking pizza. In fact, I think it's more unpopular to love pizza than it is to love The Dark Knight, and for good reason. It's a monumental accomplishment in storytelling, and one that is centred between two compelling forces - Christian Bale's Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker, the latter of who delivers one of the greatest, transformative performances in the history of cinema. The movie is the most perfect portrayal of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, and it's brought to life through an incredible score, fantastic editing and sound, tension and performances. It's a masterpiece of absolutely no compromises.\n\nThanks for reading my list! What about you all? What is your ranking of Christopher Nolan's films? Share below!"
