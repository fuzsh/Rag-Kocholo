        "text": "With James Newton Howard’s music for film being succinctly celebrated at Belgium’s recent 12th World Soundtrack Awards & Concert, the IFMCA joined in with the celebrations by presenting Mr. Howard with a specially framed certificate highlighting his M. Night Shymalan collaboration. IFMCA members Tim Burden, Bregt De Lange, Thomas Glorieux, Thor Joachim Haga and Paul Stevelmans were in attendance to present Mr. Howard with his awards.\n\nHis past award wins for The Happening and Lady in the Water further cement his outstanding music for genre movies and Mr. Howard was delighted to have these achievements recognized in such a way. Commenting on the Shymalan output being considered by the critics to bring out the best in each other he said: “That would be a compliment and I think so too. I’m very proud of the body of work that he and I have done together, certainly I’ve had some incredible performances by various musicians contributing to those scores over the last 13 years or so. It’s a great relationship and we’ve become good friends through it all”.\n\nAfter Earth is their next project together and James is working on it right now, commenting: “It’s a wonderful futuristic science-fiction movie and is very powerful and moving. It’s very much an ensemble piece between Will and Jayden Smith. We’ll be scoring it probably in late November”.\n\nThe World Soundtrack Awards form part of the Ghent Film Festival, and are overseen by the World Soundtrack Academy. Launched in 2001, the WSA is aimed at organizing and overseeing the educational, cultural and professional aspects of the art of film music, including the preservation of the history of the soundtrack and its worldwide promotion – the latter through the presentation of awards as well as through the development of several other promotional initiatives.\n\nAt the 2012 World Soundtrack Awards, Alberto Iglesias was chosen as Film Composer of the Year 2012, for his soundtracks for Le Moine, The Skin I Live In and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. He also went home with the award for Best Original Film Score of the Year for Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Brian Byrne received the WSA for Best Original Song Written for Film for “Lay Your Head Down” from the film Albert Nobbs. Byrne also won the Discovery of the Year Award. The Public Choice Award went to Abel Korzeniowski for the film W.E. Pino Donaggio received a World Soundtrack Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by legendary songwriter Mike Stoller.\n\nOur thanks to Pamela Sollie and James Newton Howard.\n\nClick on the thumbnails for larger images:"
