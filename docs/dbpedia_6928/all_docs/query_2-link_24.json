        "text": "Film Composer of the Year 2021\n\nAs announced earlier this spring, documentary scores are now also eligible in all film score categories. Best known for her acclaimed work on documentaries such as For Sama, Nainita Desai is nominated for Film Composer of the Year for her scores for the documentaries American Murder: The Family Next Door, Persona: The Dark Truth behind Personality Tests and The Reason I Jump. James Newton Howard, a former guest of honour at the WSAwards and Film Composer of the Year 2008, is nominated for his scores for News of the World and Raya and the Last Dragon. Oscar nominee Emile Mosseri joins the competition with Kajillionaire, which figured in Film Fest Ghent’s Official Competition last year, and Minari. Daniel Pemberton, Film Composer of the Year at the 2020 IFMCA Awards, is also acknowledged for his body of work this year, including Enola Holmes, Rising Phoenix and The Trial of the Chicago 7. No stranger to the WSA, Pemberton won the WSA Discovery of the Year 2014 and has already been nominated twice before for Film Composer of the Year. Finally, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Jon Batiste, already Oscar winners for Best Original Score with Soul, are now in the running for the WSA Film Composer of the Year award as well. Last year, the duo Reznor and Ross were nominated in the Television Composer of the Year category.\n\nBest Original Song\n\nAmong the songs competing for Best Original Song (this year six songs instead of five due to an ex aequo) are “Call me Cruella” (from Disney's Cruella) written by Nicholas Britell, Florence Welch, Jordan Powers, Steph Jones and Taura Stinson, and Oscar-winning “Fight for You” (from Judas and the Black Messiah) written by H.E.R., Dernst Emile II and Tiara Thomas. The Oscar-nominated “Hear My Voice” (from The Trial of the Chicago 7) written by Daniel Pemberton and Celeste Waite and “Húsavík (My Hometown)” (from Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga) written by Savan Kotecha, Rickard Göransson and Fat Max Gsus are also in the running. Finally, “Loyal Brave True” (from Disney's Mulan) written by Jamie Hartman, Harry Gregson-Williams, Rosi Golan and Billy Crabtree and “Rain Song” (from Minari) written by Emile Mosseri have a chance of becoming the WSA Best Original Song 2021."
