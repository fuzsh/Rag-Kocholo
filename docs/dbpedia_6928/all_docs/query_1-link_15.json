        "text": "Christopher Nolan is that rare breed of director: the sort that manages to manifest his own personal vision while perfectly meeting the demands of big studio blockbusters along the way. And the results are always thrilling: from the anonymous, buzzing threat of Memento to the byzantine labyrinths and high-concept heists of Inception, Nolan’s films are equal parts intriguing for filmgoers and bankable for cinemas. But how does he actually do it? In his new book, The Nolan Variations, Tom Shone interviewed Nolan extensively to chart the filmmaker’s diverse, often oblique influences and the way they impact the look and feel of specific scenes in his films. In this extract, Shone discusses how Michael Mann’s understanding of cityscapes and the characterisation of the shark in Jaws inspired elements of The Dark Knight, the 2008 second part of Nolan’s acclaimed adaptation of Batman.\n\nThe Joker arrives in Gotham in the very first scene of The Dark Knight, like a dark thought or a genie summoned by the hard, clean lines of the Gotham street in which he appears. He is first seen standing with his back to us on Franklin Drive, in the heart of the Chicago Loop, his figure placed in the middle of the frame and standing out against the clean, symmetrical lines of the architecture around him, while the camera dollies in for a shot of the clown’s mask he is holding in his left hand. His immobility is eerie: What is he waiting for? A van pulls up in front of him. He gets in. The movie starts.\n\nOriginally created by Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane in Batman number 1 in the spring of 1940, where he was described as “a grim jester,” the Joker drew inspiration from Paul Leni’s silent expressionist classic The Man Who Laughs (1928), about a freak show attraction (Conrad Veidt) whose face has been disfigured by his father’s enemies, leaving it in a permanent grin. The character’s circus-show origins are what stuck with Hollywood, in iteration after iteration: his brightly colored suits, his clown makeup, and the story of how he got it. Nolan saw instead an anarchist, moving through the story like the shark in Jaws or a serial killer, a force of nature driving the film from beginning to end without letup or explanation, motivated solely by the desire to sow chaos. Rather than go bigger than Batman Begins, geographically, they would go smaller, tighter, more confined. “You have to look at scale in a different way,” Nolan says. “Batman Begins had been as big as we could make it. I knew we couldn’t stuff any more in, geographically. So you have to look at the scale in a different way. What I wound up doing is looking at it differently in terms of storytelling and cinematography. One of the biggest epic films I have ever seen is Michael Mann’s Heat. That is a true Los Angeles story, just wall-to-wall within the city. Okay, we’ll make it a city story. We’re going to shoot in a real city, with real streets and real buildings, because the scale of that can be massive. We are going to use IMAX cameras so we can shoot the full height of the buildings and we’re going to give you an antagonist who’s interfering with the very fabric of the city. Just from the way we shoot it, the Joker walking down the street will be a huge image. Heat was very much an influence, because Mann is a fanatic for architecture, too; he understands the grandeur of a city and how it can become a kind of epic playground.”\n\nAs he had for Batman Begins, he used two composers to score the film, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, with Howard writing a more classical, heroic musical suite for Harvey Dent, and Zimmer embracing the more punk aesthetic of the Joker. Some of the ideas were very much born before Nolan started to shoot. As soon as he finished the script, and six months before Howard started work, Nolan sat down with Zimmer in London and had a conversation about the Joker—his motivation, or lack of it, the way he represented no principle other than pure chaos. How do you describe anarchy musically? Returning to his studio in Santa Monica, Zimmer tacked a photocopy of one of Francis Bacon’s Pope paintings to his computer screen and dug into his roots in synthesized music and punk, drawing inspiration from Kraftwerk and The Damned. One of the things he got from the character was a fearlessness, and consistency—“You know the thing about chaos, Harvey?” the Joker says to Dent. “It’s fair”—and that suggested to Zimmer a single note of some sort, something urgent, dire, simple. For months, he chiseled away at the idea, plugging away at old synthesizers, making crazy noises and recording musicians experimentally—razor blades on piano wire, pencils scratching tables and floors—long past the point when he should have started writing usable musical cues for the film. The result was four hundred tracks and nine thousand bars of music, which Zimmer put on an iPod that he gave to Nolan to listen to on a flight over to Hong Kong for the final round of location shooting. It was “a pretty unpleasant experience,” Nolan told Zimmer upon touching down. “I have no idea where exactly the sound of the Joker is in that nine thousand bars, but you feel that it is there.”\n\nWhat they decided on in the end were variations on a single cello note, played by Martin Tillman, augmented with some very fuzzy guitar work— actually two notes, one distant, airy, and sustained, the other joining it and slowly sliding upward in a glissando, like a string that is being tightened and tightened without ever quite breaking. It was more tonal experiment than theme, a sound of ever-greater dissonance, fusing metallic buzzing and scratching. Tillman had to abandon all his musical training to do it. “The Joker’s theme is very unusual because he wormed his way incessantly into the film,” says Nolan. “There was enormous pressure to know what the music for the Joker was going to be. Hans had hours and hours of stuff, but we knew it was in there, there was something there.”\n\nJust as radical was Nolan’s decision, while editing the Joker’s bazooka-led ambush of Dent’s paddy wagon, to dispense with musical cues altogether, orchestrating the sound effects of the scene—gunfire, screaming metal—into its own kind of percussion. “People have asked if I would ever make a musical, and I’m like, ‘They’re all musicals.’”\n\nThe scene in question occurs at just past the seventy-four-minute mark. To satisfy the Joker’s demands, Gotham’s new district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckart), has decided to identify himself as the Batman. Taken into protective custody by an armored SWAT vehicle, he is driven across the city, accompanied by a half a dozen police cars and helicopters in a convoy. It is dusk, almost nightfall, the city streets bathed in cool blue shadow. From an aerial tracking shot looking down, we see the convoy making its way along the bottom of a canyon of skyscrapers, in single file, like wagons in a Western, a shot so classically elegant that we almost don’t notice what looks to be a wall of fire about a block ahead of the convoy, at the top of the frame. It’s around now that you notice the sound, or lack of it. As the convoy crosses the bridge and swings a left, spotlit by the helicopters, the sound of their blades drops away and we hear the single sustained cello note, played son filé, that we have come to associate with the Joker’s chaos.\n\n“What the hell is that?” asks one of the cops as they get closer to that wall of fire blocking the street, now revealed as a burning fire truck— unattended on an empty street, the sight is surreal—and the convoy is diverted to the underpass. “Lower Fifth?” complains the cop. “We’ll be like turkeys on Thanksgiving down there.”\n\nSure enough, as the convoy takes an exit ramp underground, losing its helicopter cover, one of the police cars is suddenly knocked out of the way by a garbage truck swinging in from nowhere. One of the police vans is sent hurtling into the river that runs along one side of the underpass as an eighteen-wheeler pulls up alongside the SWAT van. Dent is now boxed in on two sides. The door of the eighteen-wheeler—which bears an advertisement for Hyams Amusement Park, reading “Laughter is the best medicine,” except an S has been added, so that it reads “Slaughter is the best medicine”—slides open to reveal the Joker and his men, all in clown masks, hanging by straps from the roof. Casually, as if indifferent to the exact start of festivities, the Joker raises a small pistol and starts firing. Then someone hands him a sawed-off shotgun, which leaves great dents in the side of the SWAT van. Finally, someone hands him a bazooka, and he picks off the police cars, flipping them like dominoes, one by one.\n\nFinally, Batman shows up. At first, he attempts to match the Joker’s exponentially escalating attack. Driving the Tumbler, the armor-plated Lamborghini-Hummer hybrid of the first film, he aims straight for the convoy, plows straight into the garbage truck, or, more accurately, under it, the Tumbler acting like a wedge that drives the truck up into the concrete roof of the freeway, sending sparks flying and crumpling the cabin like a tin can. The Tumbler stops, spins around, and resumes its pursuit in time to intercept a direct bazooka shot at Dent’s SWAT van, sending it flying through the air like a bodyguard taking a hit for his client, before crashing end over end through the concrete barrier. A gang of workers gathers around the crashed vehicle. Inside the smoking, mangled remains, something is stirring. Suddenly, the cockpit descends, panels of the car burst out, like a beetle readying itself to fly, and the front wheel detaches and pulls forward, pulling a second wheel in behind it to form a motorbike made up of the crudest elements of fat wheels, chassis, seat. It looks like a praying mantis built by Harley-Davidson. Sleek, fast, low to the ground, not without danger, the Batpod is by far the coolest of Batman’s toys because it echoes his strengths rather than covers for his weaknesses. The bike’s engines sound like a cross between a massive turbine and a jet plane readying for takeoff. Straddling it, Batman lies so low as to be almost horizontal, one wheel at his hands, one wheel at his feet, his cape pluming beautifully out the back as he roars down Lower Wacker Drive, clipping the wing mirrors of the cars as he goes—clink, clink, clink—clearing the way for himself with a blast of the bike’s cannons. Boom. Boom. Boom. The IMAX photography brings a sense of scale, while simultaneously slowing Nolan’s editing rhythms right down, lending a formal elegance to the shot making. After the disorientation of the Joker’s attack, the editing rhythms are unhurried, stately, the shots fluid, elegant.\n\nFreed from task of cloaking Gotham in darkness, Nolan is able to concentrate on composition, shooting the glass and steel canyons of the Chicago Loop the same way John Ford used to shoot Monument Valley, using the architecture to concretize space, and turning depth perception into an almost physical pleasure. When Batman finally catches up with the Joker on LaSalle Street, Nolan frames the face-off the way Ford filmed the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in My Darling Clementine (1946), the camera slung at their knees, looking up at these mythic figures. When Batman flips the Joker’s eighteen-wheeler by entangling its wheels in a long steel towrope that jerks driving cabin and truck through 180 degrees to land on its back with a resounding groan, like Agamemnon felled, it seems more than just a physical stunt, and the closest to an artistic manifesto Nolan has yet come. “I just did what I do best—I took your plan, and I turned it on itself,” says the Joker, a line written by Jonah that could as easily sum up Nolan’s entire ethos as a filmmaker. He takes the rules of genre and he flips them. He ticks the boxes of the studio while smuggling personal material past them.\n\nEverything is flipped in The Dark Knight, from trucks to morality to witnesses to the camera that slowly cranes upside down to take a look at the inverted figure of the Joker, dangling from the Prewitt Building, at the movie’s climax. It’s not just an eighteen-wheeler that has been flipped, but the big-bigger-best giganticism of big-budget filmmaking itself. We are firmly in Nolan’s universe now, a place where traditional measures of strength, weight, and mass count for little and can even be turned against you. Bruce Wayne’s first decision, indeed, is to trim down. “I’m carrying too much weight,” he tells Alfred. Attempting to bring order to Gotham, Batman has instead provoked the opposite—a string of copycat thugs and two-bit vigilantes, all imitating and styling themselves after the Batman. Blamed by the public for the ensuing violence, he spends much of the movie brooding over reports of his demise, and is only stopped from retiring by the appearance of the Joker, a Lord of Misrule in cracked white makeup, with no motivation except sowing chaos. “I’m just a dog chasing cars,” he says, wearing a nurse’s uniform, in which he has sneaked into Dent’s hospital room. “I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it.” Where Batman is a Swiss Army knife of technological gizmos, driven by a Freudian backstory so long that it took an entire movie to unpack, the Joker is a coldly psychotic knife man, driven by nothing other than the desire to create chaos. Every time he tells his backstory, it’s different.\n\nEffeminate and sly, where Batman is chiseled and armor-plated, like a cross between Alice Cooper and a drag queen who has been left out in the rain, he’s an affront to the very principles that keep the Batman pinned in place. These two shouldn’t even really be in the same room together, you feel, lest the laws of physics force one or the other of them to fzzt out of existence.\n\nHence the electricity of their first big meeting in the police interrogation room: a long, tiled room that has the feeling of an abattoir. The scene starts in a very controlled way, in darkness, but upon the lights’ being turned on, we see Batman standing behind the Joker.\n\n“Why do you want to kill me?” he asks.\n\n“I don’t want to kill you,” says the Joker, laughing, bopping back and forth in his seat, in and out of the focal frame. “What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No. You. Complete. Me.”\n\nLicking his lips like a lizard, eyes wandering around the room as if half- expecting someone else to show—he has the body language of an abused dog—the Joker proceeds to bond with Batman, asserting grotesque intimacy with him, two freaks unbound by the codes that keep everyone else in their place. “The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules,” he says, smirking. “Tonight, you’re going to break your one rule . . .” As the Joker’s trolling reaches an unbearable point, Batman erupts, reaching across the desk, grabbing him by the throat, and throwing him against the wall to get Dent’s whereabouts out of him. “He’s in control,” says Gordon, watching through the glass, when one of Gordon’s men gets up to intervene, but by this point, you will have noticed the return of that single sawing cello note that announces an onset of the Joker’s chaos. Something is wrong.\n\nThe Nolan Variations: The Movies, Marvels and Mysteries of Christopher Nolan by Tom Shone is out now.\n\nNow read\n\nChristian Bale on suffering from insomnia and running into Viggo Mortensen in Rome\n\nRobert Pattinson as Batman is a lesson in emo\n\nTenet is a time-reversal movie you won’t watch twice"
