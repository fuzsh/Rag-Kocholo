        "text": "Generative AI for Business Meetup this Thursday ! I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining an exciting Meetup this Thursday, 4/07 at 17h at BeCentral, to reconnect with alumni of the \"AI Black Belt\" training programs, friends, and new faces in the AI community. Organized by Accelerate.AI, this event is all about diving into the new opportunities and challenges in generative AI. We'll kick off with: * A general introduction by Nathanael Ackerman (AI4Belgium) * An insight into Generative AI for personal productivity with Jeremy Corman * A look at Generative AI for businesses, including LLM, RAG, and fine-tuning, which I'll be presenting * A panel discussion with Yves Colinet, Denis Vandenbergen, and Valerie Zapico What makes this event even more special for me is that it's connected to the startup I co-founded with Roald Sieberath.
