        "text": "It is probably the best-known component of a dental product Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc. (Kuraray Noritake Dental) has ever developed: 10-Methacryloyloxydecyl Dihydrogen Phosphate, in short, the MDP monomer. Invented more than 40 years ago – the first product containing it was introduced in 1983 – MDP is still the leading functional monomer used to establish a long-term, durable and stable bond to hydroxyapatite in tooth structure and to metal oxides in restorative materials (oxide ceramics and metal alloys).\n\nNowadays, it is found in every dental adhesive and every component of a resin cement system with adhesive properties from Kuraray Noritake Dental. These include:\n\nIn addition, MDP has become an integral part of most universal adhesives and many adhesive cementation systems of other manufacturers as well. However, not all MDP is alike …\n\nMDP: Chemical structure and mechanism of adhesion\n\nThe MDP monomer consists of three essential parts: A polymerizable group, a hydrophobic group and a hydrophilic group. The co-polymerizable methacrylate group has a terminal double bond enabling polymerisation. The large hydrophobic alkylene group – also referred to as the spacer – has the task to maintain a delicate balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the monomer and offers great resistance to degradation. Finally, the hydrophilic phosphate group is responsible for acidic demineralisation, for chemical bonding with calcium in hydroxyapatite and for bonding with zirconia1 (as well as with metal).\n\nBonding performance\n\nLots of in-vitro studies have been carried out to investigate the bonding behaviour of 10-MDP in the context of direct and indirect restorative procedures. No matter whether a cavity is to be filled with resin composite or an indirect restoration is to be placed, a strong and long-lasting bond to tooth structure needs to be established.Chemical structure of adhesive monomer 10-Methacryloyloxydecyl Dihydrogen Phosphate (MDP).\n\nThe critical substrate in this context is dentin, while bonding to enamel is found to be less challenging. That is why it is so important that (self-etch) adhesives containing 10-MDP show an extraordinarily high bond strength to tooth structure, particularly to dentin2. In fact, 10-MDP also provides for a high bond stability over time by establishing an acid-base resistant zone on the adhesive interface3. This means that a great long-term performance may be expected. Fortunately, a great clinical long-term performance of products containing the MDP monomer has already been confirmed: A group from the University of Leuven (Belgium) has presented excellent results of a thirteen-year clinical trial involving the use of CLEARFIL™ SE Bond in 20154.\n\nWhen bonding to indirect restorations made of zirconia, the surface area of the ceramic should be increased by sandblasting5. Pre-treated in the recommended way, the bond strength to zirconia tends to be particularly high when MDP-based resin cement systems are used6. It is thus widely recommended by experts in the field of adhesive dentistry to employ MDP-containing primers or resin cements for the placement of zirconia-based restorations, especially those with a non- or less retentive preparation. The fact that products containing 10-MDP work well in this context has been confirmed in different clinical studies with observation periods of up to 10 years7,8. The products used in these studies were PANAVIA™ 21, PANAVIA™ F2.0 and the latest version of the multi-component cementation system from Kuraray Noritake Dental, PANAVIA™ V5, which performed best.\n\nNot all MDP is alike\n\nEver since the basic patent for MDP has expired, other manufacturers of dental adhesives and adhesive resin cements have started integrating the functional monomers in their own products. However, it has been revealed that there are differences in the purity of the MDP monomers synthesized and used, and that these differences have an impact on the long-term bonding performance of the products containing the MDP9. According to in-vitro test results, the Original MDP Monomer synthesized by Kuraray Noritake Dental stands out due to an unmatched level of purity. This purity has a positive effect on the microstructure and thickness of the hybrid layer formed on dentin, the intensity of nano-layering and the bond strength measured immediately as well as after artificial aging9.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe data summarized above reveals that after 40 years in clinical service, the Original MDP Monomer from Kuraray Noritake Dental is still a class of its own. It has everything needed to establish a strong and long-lasting bond to tooth structure, resin composite and metal oxides, and is therefore a valuable component in virtually every adhesive system. In order to provide for a high bond quality, however, it may be best to use an MDP monomer with a confirmed high purity – the Original MDP Monomer.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

They are suitable for a wide range of indications and different application techniques, fulfil their tasks with fewer components than conventional systems and often involve fewer steps in the clinical procedure. Universal adhesives are a prominent example.\n\nHow do universal adhesives contribute to a streamlining of workflows?\n\nWhen restoring teeth with resin composite, the restorative material will undergo volumetric shrinkage upon curing. By bonding the restorative to the tooth structure with an adhesive, the negative consequences of this shrinkage – marginal gap formation, marginal leakage and staining, hypersensitivity issues and the development of secondary caries – are prevented. The first bonding systems available on the dental market were etch-and-rinse adhesives, which typically consisted of three components: an acid etchant, a primer and a separate adhesive. Later generations combined the primer and the adhesive in one bottle, or were two or one-bottle self-etch adhesives. Universal adhesives (also referred to as multi-mode adhesives) may be used with or without a separate phosphoric acid etchant.\n\nFig. 1. Volumetric shrinkage of resin composite restoratives and its clinical consequences.\n\nWhich technique to choose depends on the indication and the clinical situation. In most cases, the best outcomes are obtained after selective etching of the enamel1. Bonding to enamel is generally found more effective when the enamel is etched with phosphoric acid, while the application of phosphoric acid on large areas of dentin involves the risk of etching deeper than the adhesive is able to hybridize. When the cavity is small, however, selective application of the phosphoric acid etchant to the enamel surface may not be possible, so that a total-etch approach is most appropriate. Finally, in the context of repair, the self-etch approach may be the first choice, as phosphoric acid might impair the bond strength of certain restorative materials by blocking the binding sites. By using a universal adhesive, all these cases may be treated appropriately, as the best suitable etching technique can be selected in every situation.\n\nApart from the differences related to the use or non-use of phosphoric acid etchant on the enamel or enamel-and-dentin bonding surface, the clinical procedure is always similar with the same universal adhesive. The following clinical case is used to illustrate how to proceed with CLEARFIL™ Universal Bond Quick (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.) in the selective enamel etch mode, and it includes some details about the underlying mechanism of adhesion.\n\nHow to proceed with selective enamel etching?\n\nA clinical example.\n\nThis patient presented with a fractured maxillary lateral incisor, luckily bringing the fragment with him. Hence, it was decided to adhesively lute the fragment to the tooth with an aesthetic flowable resin composite.\n\nFig. 2. Patient with a fractured maxillary lateral incisor.\n\nFig. 3. Close-up of the fractured tooth.\n\nFig. 4. Working field isolated with rubber dam.\n\nAs proper isolation of the working field makes the dental practitioner’s life easier, a rubber dam was placed using the split-dam technique. It works well in the anterior region of the maxilla, as the risk of contamination with saliva from the palate is minimal. Once the rubber dam was placed, the bonding surfaces needed to be slightly roughened to refresh the dentin. As the surfaces were also slightly contaminated with blood and it is important to have a completely clean surface for bonding, KATANA™ Cleaner was subsequently applied to the tooth structure, rubbed into the surfaces for ten seconds and then rinsed off. The cleaning agent contains MDP salt with surface-active characteristics that remove all the organic substances from the substrate. The fragment was fixed on a ball-shaped plugger with (polymerised) composite and also cleaned with KATANA™ Cleaner.\n\nFig. 5. Cleaning of the tooth …\n\nFig. 6. … and the fragment with KATANA™ Cleaner.\n\nWhat followed was selective etching of the enamel on the tooth and the fragment for 15 seconds. Whenever selective enamel etching is the aim, it is essential to select an etchant with a stable (non runny) consistency – a property that is offered by K-ETCHANT Syringe (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.). Both surfaces were thoroughly rinsed and lightly dried before applying CLEARFIL™ Universal Bond Quick with a rubbing motion. This adhesive is really quick: Study results show that the bond established immediately after application is as strong and durable as after extensive rubbing into the tooth structure for 20 seconds.2,3 The adhesive layer was carefully air-dried to a very thin layer and finally polymerized on the tooth and on the fragment.\n\nFig. 7. Selective etching of the enamel of the tooth …\n\nFig. 8. … and the fragment with phosphoric acid etchant.\n\nFig. 9. Application …\n\nFig. 10. … of the universal bonding agent.\n\nFig. 11. Polymerization of the ultra-thin adhesive layer on the tooth …\n\nFig. 12. … and the fragment.\n\nWhat happens to dentin in the selective enamel etch (or self-etch) mode?\n\nAfter surface preparation or roughening, there is a smear layer on the dentin surface that occludes the dentinal tubules, forms smear plugs that protect the pulp and prevents liquor from affecting the bond. When self-etching the dentin with a universal adhesive, this smear layer is infiltrated and partially dissolved by the mild self-etch formulation (pH > 2) of the universal adhesive. At the same time, the adhesive infiltrates and demineralizes the peritubular dentin. The acid attacks the hydroxyapatite at the collagen fibrils, dissolves calcium and phosphate and hence enlarges the surface. Then, the 10-MDP contained in the formulation reacts with the positively loaded calcium (and phosphate) ions. This ionic interaction is responsible for linking the dentin with the methacrylate and thus for the formation of the hybrid layer.4,5\n\nIn the total-etch mode, the phosphoric acid is responsible for dissolving the smear layer and demineralising the hydroxyapatite. This leads to a collapsing of the collagen fibrils, which need to be rehydrated by the universal adhesive that is applied in the next step. Whenever the acid penetrates deeper into the structures than the adhesive, the collagen fibrils will remain collapsed. This will most likely result in clinical issues including post-operative sensitivity6.\n\nWhen applying the adhesive system, a dental practitioner rarely thinks about what is happening at the interface7. However, every user of a universal adhesive should be aware of the fact that a lot is happening there. This is why it is so important to use a high-performance material with well-balanced properties and strictly adhere to the recommended protocols.\n\nFig. 13. Schematic representation of dentin after tooth preparation: The smear layer on top with its smear plugs occluding the dentinal tubules protects the pulp and prevents liquor from being released into the cavity.\n\nFig. 14. Schematic representation of dentin after the application of a universal adhesive containing 10-MDP: The mild self-etch formulation partially dissolves and infiltrates the smear layer, while at the same time demineralizing and infiltrating the peritubular dentin5.\n\nIn the present case, the tooth and the fragment now needed to be reconnected. For this purpose, CLEARFIL MAJESTY™ ES-Flow (A2 Low) was applied to the tooth structure. The fragment was then repositioned with a silicone index, held in the right position with a plier and light cured. To obtain a smooth margin and glossy surface, the restoration was merely polished. The patient presented after 1.5 years for a recall and the restoration was still in a perfect condition.\n\nFig. 15. Reconnecting the fragment with the tooth structure.\n\nFig. 16. Treatment outcome.\n\nWhy is it important to adhere to the product-specific protocols?\n\nUniversal adhesives contain lots of different technologies in a single bottle. While this fact indeed allows users to rationalize their clinical procedures, it also requires some special attention. As every highly developed material, universal adhesives need to be used according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. In general, materials may only be expected to work well on absolutely clean surfaces, while contamination with blood and saliva is likely to decrease the bond strength significantly. Depending on the type of universal adhesive, active application is similarly important, as is proper air-drying and polymerization of the adhesive layer. In addition, care must be taken to use the material in its original state, which means that it needs to be applied directly from the bottle to avoid premature solvent evaporation or chemical reactions. When adhering to these rules, universal adhesives offer several benefits from streamlined procedures to simplified order management and increased sustainability, as fewer bottles are needed and likely to expire before use.\n\nDentist:\n\nDR.

A renowned instructor who teaches dental practitioners the skills needed to use the technique successfully is Michał Jaczewski. He graduated from Wroclaw Medical University (Poland) in 2006 and runs his own private practice in the city of Legnica since 2011. He is the founder of the Biofunctional School of Occlusion, which conducts trainings in the field of comprehensive dental treatments, and is passionate about aesthetic digital dentistry. At the International Dental Show 2023 in Cologne, he showed us when, why and how he uses flowable injection in his dental office.\n\nCould you please describe the technique in a few words?\n\nThe flowable injection technique is a simple, predictable, repeatable way to restore teeth using flowable composite. It is based on a wax-up, over which a silicone index is produced. This index then serves as the key for the injection of the flowable composite, which is light-cured through the transparent silicone. The most important benefit is that this technique works without or in some cases with a very minimal tooth preparation. It is a minimally invasive technique that can be used by beginners and by experienced dentists. Using a composite with a well-balanced opacity in a thickness of 0.3 mm and a special polishing protocol, it is possible to achieve excellent morphological and optical outcomes.\n\nWhen did you start using the flowable injection technique and what are its major indications?\n\nI started using the technique in 2018. It was originally invented to restore anterior teeth, but nowadays, it is successfully used in the posterior region as well. To my mind, it is particularly useful whenever the shape of multiple teeth needs to be corrected to improve a patient’s smile, no matter whether young or old. This may be the case after orthodontic treatment. The teeth are simply aligned and then restored to the perfect shape using this non-invasive technique. I also use flowable injection for a smile makeover, to restore worn teeth and to change the vertical dimension of occlusion in the context of full-mouth reconstructions. In the latter case, the restoration may be temporary and used for a mid- to long-term “test drive”. However, it can also serve as the final restoration.\n\nHow do you start when planning to restore a patient’s teeth with the flowable injection technique?\n\nThe most important phase heavily influencing the success of this technique is the planning phase. It consists of documentation, impression taking and the creation of a wax-up and mock-up as well as the production of the silicone index. You can of course work in the traditional way with a silicone impression and conventional wax-up, but the use of digital technologies in this phase will improve your workflow significantly. I usually start with photo and video documentation and a digital impression. Records of the centric relation and occlusion are needed as well. Then, a virtual wax-up is created using digital smile design software. In this step, it is important to take into account the facial characteristics of the patient, a task that is best accomplished using the facial flow concept. Based on the resulting design, a virtual treatment outcome can be displayed and discussed with the patient. Once approved, the model with wax-up is printed in different versions: the full wax-up model and an “interlip model” with an alternating design – one tooth with wax-up followed by one tooth without. These models are used to produce the required indexes made of transparent silicone.\n\nDigital Smile Design: Patient with severe tooth wear.\n\nVirtual wax-up displayed in the patient’s mouth.\n\nModels printed on the basis of the virtual mock-up.\n\nSilicone index produced on the alternating (interlip) model.\n\nWhen and why do you produce more than one silicone index?\n\nIt is particularly useful to work with the complete and the alternating (partial) silicone index when planning to restore all teeth in the maxilla. Starting with the alternating index gives me additional stability and lays the foundation for a precise outcome especially with regard to the planned occlusal height. In the lower jaw, where the handling of the index and the composite is more difficult due to the presence of saliva and moving soft tissues, I always recommend to divide the working field into three sections – one anterior and two posterior regions – and work on them separately.\n\nHow do you prepare the teeth and inject the flowable composite?\n\nIn most cases, all we need is a roughening of the enamel surfaces for the bonding procedure, which is usually possible by air abrasion with aluminum oxide (50 μm at low pressure). Then, the enamel is etched with phosphoric acid etchant and a universal bonding agent is applied. The silicone index is equipped with an injection hole on the incisal edge. This is easily accomplished with the cannula of the flowable composite syringe pressed through the material from the inside to the outside. In the posterior region, it may be useful to utilize a harder material and integrate two holes for each tooth on separate cusps – one for the injection and one for the outward flow. On a hard index, a diamond bur is needed for this procedure. I place the index, inject the flowable composite from the bottom to the top, light-cure the material shortly and remove the index. Final polymerization is carried out after index removal and the application of a layer of glycerin gel. Once the excess material is removed and the proximal part of the restoration is finished perfectly, the procedure is repeated for the other teeth before the restorations are polished.\n\nDo you have any favourite products for the technique?\n\nFor the silicone index, I use EXACLEAR (GC), as it is the most transparent silicone available on the market. My favourite composite for the flowable injection technique is CLEARFIL MAJESTY™ ES Flow of low viscosity (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.). In my dental office and during my courses, I had the chance to test a lot of different products. In this context, I found that the material from Kuraray Noritake Dental offers a few advantages. It is a modern type of nano composite with a wide range of indications and a large shade offering. With its three viscosities, it can be used in many different clinical situations. I started using it five years ago and for the flowable injection technique, the Low variant is my first choice, as it is the most universal one suitable for anterior and posterior teeth. The most decisive advantages that influenced my decision to use it are its natural aesthetics and superior polishability. You can achieve a spectacular effect without any special skills. As a bonding agent, I prefer to use CLEARFIL™ Universal Bond Quick, which makes my workflow even easier, faster and more predictable. For polishing, I have developed my own protocol.\n\nHow do you finish and polish your restorations?\n\nI start in the proximal area with polishing strips and sometimes a proximal saw. For shape adjustments, three different diamond and carbide burs have proven their worth. Subsequently, I proceed with fine or extra fine Sof-Lex™ Finishing and Polishing Discs (3M) used for contouring and finishing and rubber polishers TWIST DIA™ for Composite (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.), which already create a nice, natural surface gloss with low effort. Then, a wheel brush made of goat hair is used with diamond polishing paste (Diamond excel, FGM) and finally, I use a cotton wheel along with an aluminum oxide polishing paste (Pasta Grigia II, anaxDENT). In this way, it is possible to create a mirror finish.\n\nEtching of the enamel with phosphoric acid etchant.\n\nComplete silicone index in place.\n\nApplication of CLEARFIL™ Universal Bond Quick.\n\nSituation immediately after the injection of CLEARFIL MAJESTY™ ES Flow (Low), light curing and removal of the silicone index.\n\nProximal adjustments with rotating instruments.\n\nWhat are the biggest benefits of the flowable injection technique?\n\nFor patients and dental practitioners, the biggest advantages are savings in time and money. Many patients cannot afford ceramic veneers, and they are extremely happy to be offered a high-quality alternative that can be delivered in a single appointment. The procedure is prepless and the restorations can easily be repaired or the colour changed if they wish, so that there is virtually no risk involved in the treatment. Dental practitioners are usually able to start treating patients after they have attended a single course. While practicing makes them perfect, the first results are often already quite impressive, so that there is no huge investment involved for beginners – neither in time nor in new materials. Of course, you can invest lots of time in the finishing and polishing procedure, but I am sure you will find the right balance between effort and outcome.\n\nSet of instruments for the flowable injection technique.\n\nDo you have any recommendation of how to start using the technique?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to encourage everyone to leave their comfort zone and try something new on a regular basis. For me, starting to work with the flowable injection technique was a real gamechanger, and I would never want to work without it again. Before starting to use the technique, I would definitely attend a course that teaches you all the theoretical knowledge needed for a successful first case, and maybe even a practical workshop.\n\nMichał Jaczewski during his presentation at the Kuraray Noritake Dental booth in Cologne.\n\nFor further insights and resources on the Flowable Injection Technique, we invite you to explore additional materials available.

At the International Dental Show 2023 in Cologne, we had a conversation with him about his favourite products from Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc. and the concept of universal excellence.\n\nDr Adham Elsayed, Clinical and Scientific Manager at Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc., interviewing Dr Alessandro Devigus.\n\nDr Devigus, why did universal products attract your attention?\n\nWe all would like to reduce the number of products and components used in our dental offices to make our lives easier and more predictable. Several years ago, when the first universal products started entering the dental market, I realized that these products and the concept behind them are able to help me achieve this goal.\n\nFor what kinds of treatments do you currently use universal products?\n\nThe main field of application is restorative dentistry, in indirect and direct restorative workflows, which often go hand in hand. Whenever possible and in accordance with the needs and desires of the patient, I opt for minimally invasive direct composite restorations, often realized using universal products. Cosmetic corrections or tooth wear treatments in the lower jaw, for example, are often carried out in a prepless procedure with resin composite applied with a single-shade technique. For anterior restorations in the upper jaw of the same patient, however, I might opt for ceramic restorations, luted with a universal resin cement.\n\nWhat are your favourite indirect restorative materials, for which indications do you use them and when do universal products come into play?\n\nI produce most of my single-tooth restorations chairside with CEREC. In the anterior region, the choice is usually between different types of glass ceramic materials. In some indications, when two central incisors or all four maxillary incisors need to be restored, zirconia is also a suitable option. In these cases and for indirect restorations in the posterior region, KATANA™ Zirconia Block is my preferred material. Having tested many different types of chairside zirconia, I can say that this product simply offers the most natural colour gradation and the desired vitality. Hence, finishing is quick and easy. At the same time, the high flexural strength of the material supports me in my striving for minimally invasive preparations. For definitive placement of the produced overlays and crowns, PANAVIA™ SA Cement Universal from Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc. is my dual-cure resin cement of choice. It bonds to virtually every surface including lithium disilicate without a separate primer and offers a good flowability that facilitates restoration placement. An additional feature contributing to a quick and stress-free clinical procedure is its easy and gingiva-friendly excess removal after tack curing.\n\nWhat about direct restorations?\n\nOne of my favourite resin composites is CLEARFIL MAJESTY™ ES-2 Universal (Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.). Its single shade for the posterior and two shades for the anterior region offer just the right combination of translucency and intrinsic colour to imitate a large number of tooth shades. The effect is that it blends in nicely with the surrounding tooth structure without appearing grayish. In the posterior region, I was able to observe a certain masking potential, so that discoloured abutment teeth do not cause any problems. With this material, the shade determination step is eliminated. Clinical workflows are also simplified by the use of CLEARFIL™ Universal Bond Quick. The universal adhesive is not only versatile as it is suitable for many indications and all etching techniques, but also extraordinarily quick in its application, as the need for an extensive rubbing into the tooth structure is eliminated. In this way, it is possible to streamline direct restorative procedures.\n\nWhy do you use so many products from Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.?\n\nI simply like products from Japanese companies. They stand for quality, integrity and clinical relevance. Japanese people seem to be deeply committed to the company they work for and to their work, pay attention to every detail and try to deliver the best outcomes possible. This attitude is reflected in Kuraray’s mission “For people and the planet—to achieve what no one else can.”, and it is reflected in the products of the company as well. They offer the properties I need to deliver high-quality dental treatments.\n\nYou said that making your life easier and more predictable is the main reason for you to opt for universal materials. Please explain.\n\nIn the first place, using fewer products and components that are easy and quick in their application allows me to get a grip on costs. With fewer steps and fewer bottles, shortened application times and standardized workflows, the time a patient needs to sit in the chair is reduced, which allows me to save the most valuable factor in the office: my time. At the same time, material storage and order management are streamlined, so that it is much easier to keep track of dates of expiry, hence saving material costs as well. And the best thing about it is that all these savings are possible without compromising treatment quality. Provided that the user is able to handle the materials properly – which is facilitated by the minimal number of steps and ease of use – the quality of the outcomes is extremely high!\n\nDr Devigus, we thank you for sharing your insights with us."
