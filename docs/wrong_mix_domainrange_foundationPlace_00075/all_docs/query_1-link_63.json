        "text": "The first and most extensive alliance of industry and academic organizations in DNA data storage that came together to help address the world's exponentially growing demand for archival storage.\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\nThe DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed in October 2020 by Illumina, Microsoft, Twist Bioscience and Western Digital. Our mission is to create and promote an interoperable storage ecosystem based on DNA as a data storage medium.\n\nOur initial aim is to educate the public and raise awareness about this emerging technology and its vast power to preserve our digital legacy. In addition, as the methods of commercially viable DNA storage become better understood, the Alliance will consider recommending the creation of specifications and standards (e.g., encoding, reliability, retention, file systems) which enable end-users to add interoperable DNA-based storage solutions to their existing storage hierarchies. The Alliance does not certify or endorse specific products or applications.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nHow do I become a member?\n\nParties interested in joining can submit their request here. All membership requests are reviewed by the founding companies and, following approval by the founders, the interested party will get a confirmation by email and further instructions to complete the application.\n\nHow often does the Alliance meet?\n\nThe Alliance holds monthly conference calls for all members and working group meetings, as needed. The Alliance also organizes quarterly events.\n\nAre there requirements to become a member?\n\nMembership is open to all companies and institutions working in fields relevant to data storage, DNA synthesis, storage and sequencing. Members are expected to actively participate in the alliance activities and contribute from their area of expertise.\n\nWho are the existing members?\n\nYou can find a list of existing members of the alliance here.\n\nAlliance Activities\n\nIs there a cost associated with being a member of the Alliance?\n\nThe fee for general voting industry member is $2000/year and free for academy.\n\nWhat are members expected to do?\n\nMembers are invited to collaboratively create and promote the digital data storage ecosystem based on DNA. Members are expected to actively participate in the alliance activities and contribute from their area of expertise.\n\nWhat is DNA data storage and how can I learn more?\n\nOur first white paper gives a great overview of the technology and much more, it is a must-read for anyone interested in this field. Head over to our publications page to download the white paper. You can find more information here:\n\nDNA Storage – Microsoft Research\n\nData Storage – Twist Bioscience"
