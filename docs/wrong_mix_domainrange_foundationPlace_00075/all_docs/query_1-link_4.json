        "text": "25 March 2024\n\nLUNÄ Talk: Energy (In)Dependency\n\nKunsthalle Mulhouse, Mulhouse, FR\n\nOn the evening of 25 March, when the moon is full, the LUNÄ Talk will focus on transitioning from one energy to another, from one infrastructure to another. How can we envisage transitions without considering the need to bring history to a close before embarking on new projects? The history of energy is written as a race towards the new, towards renewal, without ever questioning the possibility of moving towards solutions of repair or transformation. It’s about turning pages and arguing that the future will be more efficient, appropriate, or cleaner. These political choices will be discussed over a few hours, involving the guest speakers and anyone else interested.\n\nParticipants:\n\nMarjolijn Dijkman, artist and moderator of the LUNÄ Talk\n\nMaarten Vanden Eynde, artist and co-host of the LUNÄ Talk\n\nFanny Lopez, historian of architecture and technology, co-curator of the Power Up exhibition\n\nClémence André, engineer in charge of urban planning and connections at Territoire d’énergie Hautes-Alpes\n\nMarie Lechner, teacher-researcher at L’École supérieure d’art et de design d’Orléans, author and exhibition curator\n\nStéphanie Schmitt, partnership relations manager, UEM\n\nWith a written letter to the participants of the LUNÄ Talk to catalyze the discussion by Cara New Daggett (Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Virginia Tech, author of ‘The Birth of Energy’)\n\nFall 2023\n\n‘Renewable’ Energy Frontiers – CFI Issue 6\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nFrom a technical point of view, renewable energy is energy from “natural” sources that can be constantly replenished; things like wind, sun, waves. Without a doubt, these are important fossil fuel alternatives. But when commodity frontier dynamics are the entry point for analyzing energy and energy transitions, the notion of renewability comes into question. To define an energy transition in technical terms without addressing the people who could make a transition possible, or the root causes of climate change, environmental degradation, and global inequality leaves a foundational question unanswered: in addition to energy, what else is being renewed in today’s renewable energy frontiers?\n\nSeveral contributions in the Issue look at how renewable energy reproduces — or renews — extractive, colonial, exploitative relations. The first three articles are grounded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the mining of cobalt, a mineral marked as key for the renewable energy transition, including Maarten Vanden Eynde’s conversation with artist, documentary photographer, and journalist Pamela Tulizo who is living and working in Goma, in North Kivu, D.R. Congo.\n\nSpring 2023\n\nHuman Body Frontiers – CFI Issue 5\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nThis issue of Commodity Frontiers is about our collective backs and what human bodies can tell us about commodity frontiers. It’s about the regimented bodies that sustain capitalism, and the (same) unruly bodies that challenge its smooth development. The issue is about labor, sex, blood, reproduction, racialization, decarceration, community, metabolism, and memory. It’s about what bodies do, how they are unevenly incorporated into capitalist economies, and how they resist or contest incorporation.\n\nIssue 5 features many contributions, including a conversation between neuroscientist, André Fenton and CF editor, Maarten Vanden Eynde, in which they consider memory as a possibly emerging frontier. Their discussion ranges from what, actually, memory is and where it resides, to if and how AI (artificial intelligence) can duplicate it. Fenton helps us see bodies (and memory) as dynamic systems, full of complex and only partially understood relationships, comprised of individual and impermanent pieces that constitute networked and enduring wholes. To this reader, the parallels between what neuroscientists study inside of our skin, and what historians and social scientists study outside of it are exciting. The conversation also offers some clues for how we might connect these inner and outer realms.\n\nFall 2022\n\nWaste Frontiers – CFI Issue 4\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nThis issue situates waste in the present and historical expansion of capitalism. The contributions to the journal ask questions about producing, managing, and theorizing waste. They examine equity issues around who is responsible for making waste, who is most intimately impacted by waste, and who is defined as waste, or as deserving of living among waste. They look at how patterns in the distribution of waste’s benefits and harms reproduce entrenched global and local inequalities. And they invite readers to ask what can be learned about capitalism - and perhaps about themselves - from studying how waste-in-capital is defined, produced, offloaded, recycled, valued, commodified, managed, experienced, countered, and unevenly invisibilized. In short, they open up “waste” as a material and discursive frontier, operating in service of capital accumulation, colonial expansion, and the maintenance of social hierarchies.\n\nIssue 4 features several interviews, including Maarten Vanden Eynde's interview with Eli Carpenter, a Professor in Interdisciplinary Art & Culture at Umeå University in Sweden. They discuss her curatorial research in “The Nuclear Culture” project, the urgency of nuclear visibility, and notions of deep time responsibility and forgetting.\n\n6 March - 21 August 2022\n\nOn-Trade-Off: Charging Myths\n\nZ33 - House for Contemporary Art, Design & Architecture, Hasselt, BE\n\nHow is technological innovation dependent on raw materials? This question is centre-stage in the exhibition Charging Myths by On-Trade-Off. This artists-collective traces the origins of lithium by starting from Manono (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The landscape of this former mining town is a relic of the colonial past. Today the town is getting ready to be a key player in the race towards green energy, following the nearby discovery of the world’s largest deposits of lithium ore.\n\nOn-Trade-Off maps production chains and unravels social, political and ecological aspects of the global economy. The exhibition presents new works that were developed during residencies and research in various locations, with Manono serving as shared point of departure. As a temporary collective, On-Trade-Off provides an artistic counterbalance to the logic of exploitation, by focussing on transnational exchange, knowledge sharing and fair practice.\n\nWith: Alexis Destoop, Marjolijn Dijkman, Pélagie Gbaguidi, Femke Herregraven, Alain Nsenga, Dorine Mokha (†2021) & Elia Rediger, Jean Katambayi Mukendi, Musasa, Georges Senga, Tétshim & Frank Mukunday, Pamela Tulizo, Maarten Vanden Eynde\n\n26 March - 16 May 2022\n\nArs Memoriae\n\n601 Artspace, New York, US\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, human civilization is increasingly shaped by machines, networks, data, artificial intelligence, financial speculation, digital traceability and the commercial exploitation of our behavior. Ars Memoriae brings together ten artists from four continents who take inspiration from technology while simultaneously questioning the mainstream history of digital technological progress, offering alternative visions and new connections and speculating on the future implications of living in a technologically augmented reality.\n\nArs Memoriae brings together a diverse selection of artworks, each addressing memory in a unique way within the framework of the history and archaeology of media. By analyzing different layers of subsequent technological inventions, much like geological strata, the works in this exhibition elucidate new relations and previously obscured correlations that tell a new story about how we got here. Together, the artists draw a critical and alternative cartography of new media history.\n\nWith: Marjolijn Dijkman, Jean Katambayi Mukendi, Lo-Def Film Factory (Francois Knoetze & Amy-Louise Wilson) + Joe-Yves Salankang Sa-Ngol, Mimi Onuoha, Tabita Rezaire, Analia Saban, Suzanne Treister, Maarten Vanden Eynde.\n\nCuratorial concept: Oulimata Gueye and Maarten Vanden Eynde\n\n1st March 2022\n\nOn-Trade-Off.net : under construction\n\nhttps://on-trade-off.net/\n\nTaking the recent run on lithium as a starting point, On-Trade-Off explores a broad range of questions surrounding the connections between raw materials, technological industries, financial speculation, and the history of electricity. How can we think beyond the dividing force of exploitative technologies today and, as artists, create new spaces for imagination, story telling, and connection across continents? As a collective we strive to reveal the blind spots in the dominant narrative about energy production and distribution by giving form to mutations and by exploring the imaginary potential of the very present moment.\n\nThe website, which is currently under construction, aims to present the work of the collective as well as the programme and various exhibitions in which OTO participates. Later, the website will allow members to access archives and research online with the challenge and main goal of being accessible from anywhere in the world and especially in countries like the DRC where data is expensive and access to electricity unequal. It is thus optimised to prioritise data and to be as light as possible. The consumption of the website is also specified in order to raise awareness of our consumption.\n\nFall 2021\n\nLivestock Frontiers – CFI Issue 3\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nIn this issue of Commodity Frontiers, contributors take up issues relating to animals, livestock, and livestock production through a commodity frontiers lens. Fueled by increasing (local, national, imperial, and global) livestock production “developments” and demands for livestock products—most notably (but not only) meat—and reinforced by technoscientific innovations, new livestock frontiers have emerged and spread across the globe. With livestock frontiers we mean both processes and sites in which animals are bred, reared, cured, traded, and commodified in novel ways, by re-allocating land, labour, capital, knowledge, and other resources, to enhance productivity and maximize gains. By doing so, livestock frontiers have changed human-animal and interhuman social relations, economic systems, and ecological landscapes in various and often unintended ways. Furthermore, livestock frontiers have become deeply entangled with frontiers in agriculture, securing the production of fodder crops such as soy and corn. These changes include, but are not limited to, the industrialization of livestock production that we discussed above.\n\nIssue 3 features several contributions, including Maarten Vanden Eynde's interview with Christien Meindertsma, the Dutch designer who has researched and wrote a book called Pig 05049 which relates the many consumer products made from a pig called 05049. They discuss Meindertsma’s motivations for making the book and reflect on some of the challenges of promoting and brining about social change regarding meat (and other) consumption.\n\n1 July 2021\n\nCalmeyn in the Congo: On Elephants, Missionaries, and a Rubber King\n\nText by Lucas Catherine, published online\n\nThis new monologue, written by Lucas Catherine, was performed in the historic Castle of Drogenbos, the home of the Calmeyn family for many generations. In three languages, Calmeyn’s soliloquy was read by three different actors and performers. In Dutch by Kurt Vandendriessche, in French by Ophélie Mac, and in English by Martin Swabey.\n\nMaurice Calmeyn, on whom the soliloquy is based, was a rare and open critic of King Leopold’s colonial project in the time, and the book (Au Congo Belge, 1912) he wrote after his travels to Congo in 1907 and 1908, caused much uproar and resulted in social exclusion. The book was suppressed severely and the original copy is still rare to find. This soliloquy aims to capture the essence of this book, to give an idea of the personality of Maurice Calmeyn and the message he tried to convey at the time.\n\n1 March 2020 - 28 August 2021\n\nBie Michels – ‘(Pas) Mon Pays’\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\nThe film ‘(Pas) Mon Pays, Part I and II’ together with the installation ‘The Copy’ will be shown at Enough Room for Space. The exhibition will also present archival material in relation to the history of the colonial monument in Mechelen and the proposed new inscription.\n\nAs the title indicates, ‘(Pas) Mon Pays, Part I and II’, is in two parts. The first deals with a colonial monument in Mechelen and Michels’ efforts to decolonize this statue with a group of Belgian citizens with Congolese roots. The second shows the artist’s visit to DR Congo and is based on her personal history. The film is an attempt to let the past encounter the present and see further into the future of the postcolonial situation, in both DR Congo and Mechelen.\n\n28 August 2021\n\nOn-Trade-Off: Phase Shift\n\nOnline & Enough Room for Space, BE\n\nThis event will focus on the overall project On-Trade-Off with several contributors elaborating on their projects and their research. It will include presentations, discussions of the current topics on Transcontinental mining connections - coloniality and extractivism between Australia and the DRC.\n\nFirst we start with a conversation between Alexis Destoop and Nicholas Mangan on their past and current film projects in relation to extractivism. Afterwards Marie Lechner will present her research on lithium mining in the Upper Rhine valley. The valley could hold in its geothermal waters enough lithium for more than 400 million electric cars, geologists have estimated, making it one of the world's biggest deposits.\n\nIn the second half there will be a discussion of the research material and experiences on site by On-Trade-Off members in relation to Manono in DR Congo. Several members of the collective will be present online and onsite including Alexis Destoop, Femke Herregraven, Jean Katambayi Mukendi, Gulda El Magambo, Georges Senga, Maarten Vanden Eynde. This part is hosted by Lotte Arndt.\n\nThe day will end with the avant-première of 'Depth of Discharge' by Marjolijn Dijkman, a film in progress produced in the framework of On-Trade-Off.\n\n26 June 2021\n\nLife Expectancy\n\nText by Jean Katambayi Mukendi, published online\n\nUncertainty Scenarios: Session #11 - Statistics focused on the use and presence of statistics and how these are increasingly present as a tool for research and study in different sectors of our contemporary society. Besides talks focusing on scientific uses of statistics the session highlighted how artists have used and / or responded to them within their practice.\n\nAfter a year in which our presence in the global pandemic statistics was permanent, the session looked at how statistics allow us to study the past, understand the present and try to predict the future. During the session we will explore where fact and fiction meet within the statistical world.\n\nIn this context, the artist Jean Katambayi Mukendi wrote a text on the place of statistics in Congolese society: what they do not tell us, what is missing and finally the statistics that could help households to have access to more sustainable electrical installations for instance. What is the role of the state in the management of statistics ? It also reminds us that statistics need to be collected, managed, analyzed, archived and that this requires infrastructure, a certain budget and objectivity.\n\n26 June 2021\n\nUncertainty Scenarios – Session #11\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\nUncertainty Scenarios: Session #11 will focus on the use and presence of statistics and how these are increasingly present as a tool for research and study in different sectors of our contemporary society. Besides talks focusing on scientific uses of statistics the session will highlight how artists have used and / or responded to them within their practice.\n\nAfter a year in which our presence in the global pandemic statistics was permanent, the session will look at how statistics allow us to study the past, understand the present and try to predict the future. During the session we will explore where fact and fiction meet within the statistical world. Some contributions will consider how statistics allow us to dig into the hidden aspects of particularly complex phenomena, while others will question how they can manipulate and guide thoughts and opinions. Measurement processes that generate statistical data are often subject to error, and the presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates. For this session we invited scientists, thinkers and artists.\n\nContributors: Florence Cheval, Antye Guenther, Koen Hufkens, Toril Johannessen, Jean Katambayi Mukendi, Maya Van Leemput, Simon Ripoll-Hurier, Daniela de Paulis, Roy Smits, Oscar Santillán, Michiel Schwarz.\n\nDue to limited seats please reserve: enoughroomforspace@protonmail.com\n\n20 June 2021\n\nICC, ‘(Pas) Mon Pays’ & ‘Calmeyn in the Congo: On Elephants, Missionaries, and a Rubber King’\n\nEnough Room for Space & Drogenbos Castle, BE\n\nA presentation of the film ‘(Pas) Mon Pays, Part I and II’ together with the installation ‘The Copy’ that is currently on view at Enough Room for Space, will be open to the public from 13:30 to 18:00. At 14:00 a conversation between Bie Michels, Lucas Catherine and Nelson Makengo will take place about the representation of colonial heritage, both within monuments and archives, and their specific relation to memory and commemoration, hosted by Anne Wetsi Mpoma and Maarten Vanden Eynde.\n\nAfterwards, starting at 16:00, a new monologue ‘Calmeyn in the Congo: On Elephants, Missionaries, and a Rubber King’, written by Lucas Catherine, will be performed in the historic Castle of Drogenbos, the home of the Calmeyn family for many generations, located on walking distance from Enough Room for Space. In three languages, Calmeyn’s soliloquy will be read by three different actors and performers. In Dutch by Kurt Vandendriessche, in French by Ophélie Mac, and in English by Martin Swabey.\n\nMaurice Calmeyn, on whom the soliloquy is based, was a rare and open critic of King Leopold’s colonial project in the time, and the book (Au Congo Belge, 1912) he wrote after his travels to Congo in 1907 and 1908, caused much uproar and resulted in social exclusion, after which Maurice retreated in De Panne at the Belgian coast where he had a brief political career, founded two co-ops, a bakery, a grocery store and a public, non-catholic school. The book was suppressed severely and the original copy is still rare to find. He was an elephant hunter, but also an ecologist avant la lettre, became a communist and was the only civilian photographer in the trenches in Ieper during the first world war. The revenues as entrepreneur were used to help poor children to get an education and until his death he was a philanthropist, for instance as main producer of the social drama film Misère au Borinage of Joris Ivens and Henri Storck.\n\nThe archive of ICC will be open to the public and during the conversation cinematographer Nelson Makengo will introduce the new film ‘Le Vieux Kilo’ (working title) he is working on that is inspired by arguably one of the most iconic and striking objects in the collection of ICC: a hidden 9mm revolver in a bible translated in Kiswahili that was brought back to Belgium from Congo by a former White Father.\n\nSpring 2021\n\nStimulant Frontiers – CFI Issue 2\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nCommodity Frontiers Initiative explores the history and present of capitalism, contestation, and ecological transformation in the global countryside. Each themed issue includes articles and interviews with experts about studying and teaching commodity frontiers in theory and in practice. The Journal features reflections and reviews on the dynamics of capitalist expansion, social change, and ecological transformation on global as well local scales, in the past and at the present.\n\nIssue 2: Stimulants have, in their own ways, played a leading role in shaping today’s globalised world. Their world-shaping power stems from their double role: as “agents” that stimulate bodies, and as things that “rouse and incite” capital. In this issue of Commodity Frontiers, contributions center on the histories and presents of some of the leading stimulant crops and the sites and processes of their cultivation, expansion, and transformations. Contributors variously consider stimulants from the perspectives of bodies and capital, sometimes touching on their overlaps.\n\nIn the framework of the 2nd Commodity Frontiers Initiative Journal with the theme of ‘Stimulants’ Maarten Vanden Eynde interviewed Roger M. Buergel and Sophia Prinz from the Johann Jacobs Museum, which owes its existence to the coffee and cacao trade, but more importantly is unique in its endeavour to lay bare the intrinsically interwoven histories of commodities. The museum is dedicated to the global interdependencies of our life-world that become especially clear when tracing the history of important trade goods and their transport routes.\n\n12 January 2021\n\nTribute to Dorine Mokha\n\nOn-Trade-Off Collective\n\nTo you Dorine Mokha (1989-2021), member of our On-Trade-Off collective, we pay tribute to you.\n\n_\n\nDorine turned the weakness of others into strength.\n\nElusive\n\nThose who have seen will never forget\n\nThose who have ignored fight with the square bark of judgement\n\nDorine combined openness, listening and gentleness with insistence, courage and enormous desire. One always had the impression that he was advancing with wings: carried by opportunities that he reclaimed in the Now, rather than waiting for them in a distant future.\n\nIt was hard to imagine the effort that this drive, which seemed so fluid, so graceful, must have demanded of him - resistance, uprightness, projection, of himself and of others, the refusal to give in to hatred, to remain in an assigned place. He had a dazzling ability to take flight, capable of connecting and detaching himself; of transforming every single interaction into yet new forms and potential openings.\n\nDorine achieved this by bringing vulnerability into play as a component of any innovative creation: setting foot in uncharted territory, knowing that this included shifting ground.... and going there anyway, with appetite, with curiosity, with finesse, and by making sharp choices.\n\nDorine tried to help us collectively remember his country's past, which has been written too often by others. He fought against the symptomatic amnesia of that history and tried to move towards a better future. An open and gentle future, that allows you to be who you want to be, move as you wish and love those you love. A fairer, more egalitarian world, where everyone can become president with no special rights for anybody. In the meantime, he himself has written history. He stood up and so many others looked up at him in awe. It is up to us, collectively, not to forget him and to keep his legacy alive.\n\nWe dance together.\n\nFall 2020\n\nMineral Frontiers – CFI Issue 1\n\nCommodity Frontiers Journal, Online\n\nCommodity Frontiers Initiative explores the history and present of capitalism, contestation, and ecological transformation in the global countryside. Each themed issue includes articles and interviews with experts about studying and teaching commodity frontiers in theory and in practice. The Journal features reflections and reviews on the dynamics of capitalist expansion, social change, and ecological transformation on global as well local scales, in the past and at the present.\n\nIssue 1: Mineral Frontiers: Capitalism, Contestation, and the Transformation of the Global Countryside. Maarten Vanden Eynde & Marjolijn Dijkman (Enough Room for Space) are the editors of the journal's section Creative Frontiers. For this issue Lotte Arndt and Oulimata Gueye introduce an article on the transnational artist’s collaboration, On-Trade-Off, which critically examines extraction, power structures in global capitalism and the global art world, and searches for alternatives. (This is a pre-publication version of the piece that will appear in the upcoming Vertical Atlas book produced by Digital Earth in collaboration with Het Nieuwe Instituut.)\n\n14 September 2020\n\nOn-Trade-Off: Dorine Mokha\n\nDigital Earth Fellowship 2020 - 2021\n\nDorine Mokha is selected for the Digital Earth Fellowship to further develop his project developed in the context of On-Trade Off. Dorine Mokha weaves together a personal and national history of the Congolese lithium mines to reflect on the economic and social political inequalities.\n\nMokha will look into collective memory, forgotten, forbidden stories, oral and written archives around the site of the Gécamines Mining Company and the Manono lithium project open-pit mine. Lithium is a planetary commodity for the ‘digital revolution’ and multiple products, such as the Tesla car. While earth’s collective memory is being stored in memory drives powered by lithium batteries, Mokha aims to fight the local and planetary amnesia of the histories and memories connected to the sites of extraction for the minerals in the mobile phones we carry in our pockets.\n\nHis project, (Dis)Charged is a research and performing arts project, in which he will combine music, dance, spoken word, and visual components.\n\n1 February 2020\n\nUncertainty Scenarios – Session #10\n\nERforS HQ, Drogenbos, BE\n\nUncertainty Scenarios – Session #10: What to do with our Brains? -- About the Pleasures and Pain of Brain Alteration.\n\nTo place the essence of personhood into the MIND is a concept deeply ingrained into Western Philosophy. It might be one reason for our centuries long philosophical obsession with (rational) thinking as an activity of higher purposes and our desires to manipulate and enhance the brain as the host of these activities.\n\nIn the 20th century these obsessions were amplified with new approaches to brain alteration. This is exemplified in cases of mind control enthusiasm in the 1950s/60s to consciousness expansion techniques of the counter cultures in the 1960s/70s, blending frictionlessly into apolitical ‘mindfulness’ tools so suitable for our neoliberal times.\n\nIn Uncertainty Scenarios - Session #10 we will discuss different perspectives regarding the brain and how it has been a target of alteration, augmentation, manipulation and control.\n\nContributors: Felix Drücker; Antye Guenther; Flora Lysen; Susan MacWilliam; Pádraic E.

One of the seven African countries crossed by the Equator, the Congo claims the longest segment of the parallel on the continent. This places the region not only at the heart of Africa, but also at the bisecting line of the globe, at the zone of intersection between southern and northern hemispheres. By asserting this position, the Biennale repeals the modern fantasy of the Congo as “irrelevant locale on the periphery of cultural history” to reclaim its profound entanglement with the world and its globally central position, both past and present.\n\nThe concept of the Biennale is to take the Equator’s imaginary line not as one of demarcation—the majestic Congo River disregards it by straddling it twice—but rather of imbrication. At its closest a place where earth gravity alleviates and where the poles’ magnetic attractions balance each other, the equatorial latitude opens the possibility for narratives that respond to alternate compasses, recognizes new centers of gravity and where de-polarized stories can unfold.\n\n29 - 31 August 2019\n\nPeriFeria festival\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\nDuring PeriFeria, ERforS will welcome you in their Head Quarters in Drogenbos and present works relating to On-Trade-Off, initiated by Picha (Lubumbashi, D.R. Congo) and Enough Room for Space in 2018. On-Trade-Off is an ongoing artistic-research project that reflects on the environmental and economic implications of the extraction and processing of Lithium, the main raw material needed for the global production of Green Energy.\n\nContinuous screening of Avec Le Vent by Raf Custers, 2013 (35 min.) , a documentary that highlights the progress of the mining industry as experienced on a daily basis by the Congolese.\n\nPeriFeria Festival allows you to discover the outskirts of Brussels and its particularities in an unconventional way. Together with local residents, neighborhood organizations, designers, researchers and artists, City3 has created an exciting program of workshops, guided tours, artistic interventions and made-to-measure activities. For the 4rd edition, PeriFeria ventures into the fascinating southern periphery of Brussels.\n\n25 May 2019 Opening event + Screenings 1 / 8 / 15 June 2019\n\nThe Voters and the Politicians & No Wo.man is an Island\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\nOpening with the premiere of 'The Voters and the Politicians' a new film by Rune Peitersen, a conversation between Rune Peitersen and Wouter Hillaert about 'The Voters and the Politicians' and the related political issues addressed, and a participatory event No Wo.man is an Island hosted by Erika Sprey and Rune Peitersen.\n\nThe Voters and the Politicians is taking its outset in a personal experience - his first conscious contact with the democratic system during a political demonstration as a teenager in Denmark – Peitersen attempts to analyse the relationship between voters and politicians in Western democracies through a series of iconic situations and political archetypes.\n\nOn the eve of the European elections, you're kindly invited to participate in the staged polylogue No Wo.man is an Island hosted by Erika Sprey and Rune Peitersen. Moving through space and assuming shifting roles we will speak in tongues about one of the central questions that haunt these elections: is a (new) future possible for the EU? For once not seeking sleek solutions or half baked compromises, we will entangle ourselves in the different strands of the Gordian knot and stretch these to their extremes, as we dig ourselves deeper in our post-factual truths that may or may not untangle new vista beyond the EU.\n\n22 April - 2 May 2019\n\nPerforming Objects – Residency: Justin Balmain\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\n…they could watch themselves. No one who ever came to know himself with the detachment of an observer, is ever the same again. Edmund Carpenter, Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me!\n\nFollowing a research and development period partnered with the Musée des civilisations de l'Europe et de la Méditerranée (Mucem), Justin Balmain utilised Enough Room for Space as an opportunity to nurture and expand upon production undertaken in Marseille, France. Interacting directly with a maleific object that remains in archival limbo in the Mucem collection, Balmain worked with the museum staff towards addressing ideas of the value of objects within cultural and capital contexts: access, commodity, archival and conservation practice, along with the complex issues this particular object raises: superstition, optics, art history, the occult, class and hierarchy within museological contexts.\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nELIXIDER 2018\n\nSecond batch of cider, Enough Room for Space, BE\n\nAs part of ELIXIR we're now producing apple cider with fruit of the public orchard surrounding the FeliXart museum (located around the corner of ERforS HQ).\n\nFelix De Boeck, an early modernist Belgian painter, made his living from his orchard. As a result he was working independently as an artist without the pressure to sell his works. The orchard is maintained by the Province but it's resources are scarcely used; most of it becomes fallen fruit. Elixir will harvest some of these fruits and transform this resource during public events into all sorts of products which will be used for upcoming events of Enough Room for Space.\n\nProduced with: Arne Skaug Olsen, Amélie Bouvier, Maarten Vanden Eynde and Marjolijn Dijkman\n\nThanks to: Felix Artmuseum, Drogenbos, Be and Regionaal Landschap Pajottenland & Zennevallei\n\n23 March 2019\n\nFinissage: ‘A Series of Characters’ by Alice De Mont\n\nExhibition, Lecture, Conversation, Enough Room for Space, BE\n\nOn the occasion of the finissage of Alice De Mont's exhibition 'A Series of Characters', Arno M. Feld will give a lecture on 'Triangular Art-Coaching in Business Environments'. Arno M. Feld, the alter ego of Christoph Baum, is an art coach who uses art and creation as a tool to enhance employees’ creativity, innovativeness and success rate. This lecture is part of De Mont's research on the function of the alter ego in artistic practice.\n\nDe Mont and Baum made the video lecture ‘Erfolg durch Kunst’ together which is on display in the exhibition 'A Series of Characters'. Their second collaboration developed for the finissage involves a scenography developed by De Mont to transform Feld's lecture into a performance. Feld's lecture will be preceded by a brief introduction by performance artist Johanna Sarah Schlenk. After the lecture by Feld, an informal conversation will take place between Alice De Mont, Christoph Baum, Johanna Sarah Schlenk and the public on the use of an alter ego as an artistic tool.\n\nTime: 15:00-20:00 (start talks 16:00)\n\n22 Sept. 2018 - 24 March 2019\n\nPerforming Objects: ‘A Series of Characters’ by Alice De Mont\n\nEnough Room for Space, BE\n\nThe ongoing research and work of Alice De Mont focuses on the construction of personalities by means of the creation of characters and alter egos. These characters function as a method to solve (artistic) problems. A character; a living and thinking thing, has the capacity to embody a problem, to bring in nuances, to change it and to accept inconsistencies. In the past year De Mont developed her alter ego Subject 23; a personality with an artistic practice which explores the relation between environment and human nature.\n\nDuring a residency at Air Berlin Alexanderplatz in 2018, De Mont had the chance to work with two existing alter egos of other people as part of her current research. Between 2012 and 2017, Lena Chen developed an alter-ego called Elle Peril; a nude model, in order to cope with the trauma of revenge porn. Christoph Baum explores the role of an art coach. In the video-lecture (Erfolg Durch Kunst), his alter ego called Arno M. Feld, explains how to be successful in the arts.\n\n1 October 2018 – 31 March 2019\n\nOn-Trade-Off: Jean Katambayi\n\nAwarded Digital Earth Fellowship\n\nDigital Earth is a 6 month-long fellowship for artists and designers based in Africa or Asia, working across a variety of media, who would like to investigate our current technological reality. ‘Digital Earth’ refers to the materiality and immateriality of the digital reality we live in – from data centers to software interfaces, and rare minerals to financial derivatives.\n\nJean Katambayi received a Digital Earth fellowship to work on a research project that starts with the production of a copy on 1:1 scale of the notorious Tesla Model X with recycled copper wires using a special weaving technique. He thereby wants to draw attention to the economic inequalities within Congolese social classes, which he believes will grow even more through the environmental impact of the so-called “green revolution” and capitalist mining industry. The work will be developed in close collaboration with Sammy Baloji and Daddy Tshikaya and is part of the project ON-TRADE-OFF, initiated by Enough Room for Space and Picha (Lubumbashi, DRC).\n\n17 June - 9 September 2018\n\nPerforming Objects: ‘Taming Anonymity’ by Guy Woueté\n\nExhibition, Enough Room for Space, BE\n\nAn exhibition by Guy Woueté with an accompanying screening by Maxime Jean-Baptiste, both working with personal and subjective narratives in response to the representation of contemporary migration and colonial histories.\n\nOn Guy's journey that took him from Antwerp to the Jungle of Calais and back, he wrote his own subjective story of this larger collective moment. All the images, texts and objects collected by Guy became part of his personal story within the context of the significant history of the jungle of Calais. The work reflects on the question of the collective that is being shared within an artists book and this exhibition.\n\n'Nou voix' by Maxime Jean-Baptiste is an autobiographical video departing from the participation of Maxime's father, as a Guyanese figurant, in the movie 'Jean Galmot aventurier' (1990), which deals with the history of French Guiana. By re-enacting a part of the film, Maxime and his father try to unravel other voices that have been unheard in the original French film.\n\nFinissage 8 September - 17:00: Laura Nsengiyumva will start a conversation with Guy Woueté and Maxime Jean-Baptiste about the related themes in their practice to be followed by a conversation with the audience.\n\n9 June 2018\n\nUncertainty Scenarios – Session #6\n\nFinissage, screening and conversation, Enough Room for Space, BE\n\nUncertainty Scenarios will host a session focusing on the Sun, its influences and repercussions of radiation on the future. The impact of the Sun on life on Earth has been recognised since prehistoric times. Our main star illuminates our planet with a duality of darkness and light. The Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a divinity, having influence on the course of our future by predicting misfortune or promising rising prospects. The Sun has supported the evolution of life but can also become a destructive force within the changing climate of our planet. It's energy is more than sufficient to supply us with all we need, but at the same time one big solar storm can wipe out vital life supporting technologies like electricity and Internet networks.\n\nThe conversation will include contributions by: Amélie Bouvier, Cosco (Louis de Cordier), Alexis Destoop, Marjolijn Dijkman, Kris Dittel, Toril Johannessen and Pádraic E. Moore.\n\nThis session is accompanied by the finissage of the solo exhibition by Amélie Bouvier, a continuous screening of ‘Non-conservation of energy (and of spirits)’ by Toril Johannessen and a presentation by Kris Dittel and Marjolijn Dijkman of the recently published publication 'Radiant Matter'.\n\n21 June 2017\n\nOnline: Uncertainty Scenarios: Lecture – Water Finds its Own Level\n\nby Alejandro Alonso Diaz\n\nA video recording of 'Water Find its Own Level' by Alejandro Alonso Diaz as part of the project Uncertainty Scenarios is now online on Vimeo. The title of this lecture, 'Water Finds its Own Level', is a simple, direct statement introducing a set of questions connected to the notion of liquidity, as a means to explore what we can understand as material uncertainties.\n\nRecorded at ERforS HQ on the 6th of January 2017. 'Water Finds its Own Level' is part of a series of off-site talks and presentations, developed by fluent in collaboration with a group of international partners. Uncertainty Scenarios is a collective experimental research project that explores the ways people throughout history have tried to speculate, predict and anticipate the future and different attitudes that go along with this.\n\n14 May 2017 (14:00-18:00)\n\nPerforming Objects – End To End @ Objections\n\nMSK (Museum of Fine Arts), Ghent, BE\n\nObjections combines the idea of ‘objects’ with the meaning of ‘objection’ as an act of resistance. How can we give neglected objects a new life? How can we renew our ways of approaching things? Which force and resistance reside in objects?\n\nFor this iteration of the project End to End performed at the finissage of Objections, the group will work with the museum objects from the MSK itself. They will mainly use objects from the backstage of the museum, part of the museum infrastructure. For the project End To End the experimental group Performing Objects is inspired by Lean Management, a form of factory management developed by Toyota in Japan. This session will be led by Lauren Grusenmeyer and Ann De Keersmaecker.\n\n18 March 2017 (19:00 - 22:00)\n\nPerforming Objects – ‘End To End’, book launch & event\n\nERforS and 'Supermarket Drogenbos', Drogenbos, BE\n\nThe launch will be accompanied by a presentation with images of the process of 'End To End / Raversijde', a film screening of 'Semiophores' by Pauline M'barek and a performative intervention ‘Physical experiments at the supermarket #4’ by Edwin Deen at the night shop in the centre of Drogenbos explores and shows the ‘hidden nature’ of seemingly unnatural/artificial, human made things. M’barek’s work operates in the transitional space between knowledge and perception, the observer and the observed, the shown and the hidden.\n\nFor the project End To End the experimental group Performing Objects is inspired by Lean Management, a form of factory management developed by Toyota in Japan. 'End to End' is a working method which structures a collective process within which objects are constantly being transformed. Variations of the project 'End To End' have so far been on display in China (2015) and Madagascar (2016) and in Belgium (2016).\n\n20 January 2017 (15:00)\n\nThe Unity of All Things\n\nLa Loge, Brussels, BE\n\nOne time Screening of The Unity of All Things / 物之合 , by Alexander Carver and Daniel Schmidt, 2013 | 97 min. at La Loge for 'Present Club'. Proposed by members part of the experimental research project Uncertainty Scenarios.\n\nThe Unity of All Things is a work of experimental science fiction about the construction of a particle accelerator on the U.S./Mexico border, and is grappling with questions of self and other by employing particle physics as a metaphor for the morphing nature of human identity. The film engages the utopian impulses of the genre, not through the imagining of another world, but through the rendering of this world as Other. All subjects are treated as alien, or as radical others, who search for, or advance different ideological, psychological, or sexual ideals of belonging. Subjects oscillate between the contemplation of past societal traumas and idealisations of futurity that refuse to synthesise or resolve, but instead reveal a troubling satire of the present.\n\n18 September - 13 November 2016\n\nPerforming Objects – End To End\n\nExhibition, Private Tag, Vrijstaat-O, Atlantikwall Raversyde, Ostend, BE\n\nFor the project End To End the experimental group Performing Objects is inspired by Lean Management, a form of factory management developed by Toyota in Japan. For the continuation of the project during the exhibition 'Private Tag' some members of the group will develop an installation as an artistic interpretation of an assembly line where systems of interaction between man and things will be investigated.\n\nObjects will be transformed and manipulated during performative acts, outlined in a score that leaves space to free interpretation, reflecting both on factory work and on the creative process of the artist. During the performance the group-members are constantly searching for a harmony between efficiency, planning, improvisation and reflection. Through the techniques of Lean Management, they try to give structure to their performance in which they have to collaborate and handle objects and vice versa.\n\n16 May 2016\n\nBricks in Madagascar: first workshop\n\nLezze Brickfactory, Boom, BE\n\nIn Madagascar, the ancient process of making bricks is still omnipresent. The small portable brick, one of the oldest objects (+/- 5000 years old) is very interesting as a starting point for her research. It’s an object that becomes part of a building and therefore part of an environment. Exactly fitting into the human hand, it is the bearer of human scale and intimacy. Bie Michels will take on the dialogue and immerse herself in local situations and let events/actors co-determine the choices she will make, to achieve a multimedia art installation. The first workshop to develop this project will be based on the performance ‘End to End’ that she developed with ‘Performing Objects’.\n\nJuly 2016: Bie Michels will travel to Madagascar to further develop this workhop on site in collaboration with CRAAM (centre de ressources des arts actuels de Madagascar).\n\nApril - June 2016\n\nUncertainty Scenarios: advises for Prophecies at Node Center\n\nNode Center, Berlin, DE\n\nWe’re very pleased to announce that Enough Room for Space is involved as one of the advisors for the first theme of Prophecies by the Art Department: Phase 1 of Node Center in Berlin. The advisors for this project are Etzel Cardeña, Marjolijn Dijkman (Enough Room for Space) and Rasheedah Phillips. They will be meeting together to guide the general direction of Prophecies by lending their expertise to brainstorm ideas, review the open call and share recommendations for potential topics that could be covered within the theme of Prophecies. In this project Node Center will explore how artistic approaches to predictions of the future have shaped us today. Here, they’re looking at art in a broad sense, crossing science fiction, popular culture, film and music as well as, of course, visual art.\n\n10 December 2011 - 5 February 2012\n\nLUNÄ at The Greater Cloud\n\nNiMK, Amsterdam, NL\n\nLUNÄ, a remake of a table that was originally used by 'the lunar society members', a 18th century enlightenment society that was influential during the industrial revolution, will be part of the exhibition 'The Great Cloud'. The table was a meeting point where the ideas for some of the most significant technological changes were formed. This 21st century version of the table will also function as a stage for talks and the developments of ideas and on top of the table works will be positioned by artists like Pamela Rosenkranz as well as by people working outside the art world.\n\n6 November - 30 December 2010\n\nSmooth Structures\n\nExhibition at Smart Project Space, Amsterdam, NL\n\nSmooth Structures explores the unexpected intersections between a new dark matter and dark energy hypothesis and its conceptual visualization mediated through art. The mathematician Martin Lo who discovered the Interplanetary Superhighway , a revolutionary model which changed space travel forever, is currently researching the “Brans’ Conjecture” theory with several other scientists. Lo invited Enough Room for Space to create an artistic response to such a hypothesis.\n\nScientists weave incredible stories, invent wild hypothesis and ask difficult questions about the meaning of life. They have insights into the workings of our bodies, minds and environment which challenge the myths we make about our identities and selves. They create visual images and models of things that are ethically and politically controversial. A great deal of contemporary art requires a similar facility for the making of unusual connections or unpredictable juxtapositions between disparate objects and concepts, a strong sense of paradox, irony, of humour or a way with manipulating the unexpected twists and turns of narrative.\n\nWith: Erick Beltrán, Marjolijn Dijkman, Martijn Hendriks, Toril Johannessen, Mungo Thomson, Maarten Vanden Eynde, Rinus Vande Velde\n\n7 - 23 November 2008\n\nCURATOR CURATOR #2:What is my name?\n\nHISK, Ghent, BE\n\nWhy am I me (myself)? Am I me (myself) in respect to others and to the codification of the world or vice versa? Perhaps in this time we need a bit of oblivion regarding the way we communicate and handle the real in order to be able to reflect on how we perceive and communicate it and on who we really are.\n\nLorenzo Bruni (IT) presents an ambitious group show with 18 artists, including Rirkrit Tiravanija, James Lee Byars, Peter Coffin, Bas Jan Ader, Dan Rees, Felix Gonzalez-Torresa and Jonathan Monk. No less than 29 works will be spread around the building in order to stimulate new consciousness of perception of space.\n\nWith interventions by: Jonathan Monk, Dan Rees, Peter Coffin, Koo Jeong-A, Rossella Biscotti, Simone Berti, José Dávila, Mario Airò, Nina Beier and Marie Lund, Nedko Solakov, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Mario Garcia Torres, Lorenzo Scotto di Luzio\n\n17 November 2008\n\nFormatting Utopia\n\nWorkshop and symposium\n\nEverything in the universe, and everything of man, would be registered at a distance as it was produced. In this way a moving image of the world will be established, a true mirror of his memory. From a distance, everyone will be able to read text, enlarged and limited to the desired subject, projected on an individual screen. In this way, everyone from his armchair will be able to contemplate creation, as a whole or in certain of its parts. - Paul Otlet (1934)\n\nFormatting Utopia will explore the potentials and pitfalls of the internet and it's formats for knowledge organisation at the Mundaneum.\n\nSpeakers: Stephanie Manfroid (BE), De Geuzen (BE), Metahaven (NL), Sabine Niederer(NL), Joachim Schmid (DE)\n\n9 May 2006\n\nIn Varietate Concordia\n\nEvents all over Europe\n\nOn the 9th of May, the official Europe Day, 40 art institutes from all 25 EU member states will fly the new European flag.
