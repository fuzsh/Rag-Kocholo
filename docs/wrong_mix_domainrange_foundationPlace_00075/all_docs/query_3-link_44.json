        "text": "Renowned International Partner Big Win for Osceola County/ICAMR\n\nOsceola County, Florida – It’s imec!\n\nThe world-leading nanoelectronics research center today announced the opening of imec Florida, a new entity focusing on photonics and high-speed electronics Integrated Circuit (IC) design that will be based in Osceola County. The new imec Design Center will work in close collaboration with the International Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing Research (ICAMR) on an R&D design center.\n\nThe creation of the ‘imecDesign Center’ provides instant credibility to Osceola County’s efforts to become the heart of smart sensor innovation.\n\n“As the U.S. semiconductor market continues to strengthen with semiconductor manufacturing, equipment, materials and system innovation, we are extremely pleased to collaborate with partner organizations in Florida and see Osceola as an interesting location to drive the next phase of imec’s growth and innovation,” said Luc Van den hove, president and CEO of imec. “Together with industrial and academic partners, we want to develop sustainable solutions and technology to accelerate innovation and stimulate economic growth within Osceola County and the State of Florida.”\n\nThe design center will facilitate the collaboration between imec’s headquarters, based in Leuven, Belgium, and U.S.-based semiconductor and system companies, universities, and research institutes.\n\nImec Florida’s initial focus will be the R&D of high speed electronics and photonics solutions, starting with an offering of IC design research for a broad set of semiconductor-based solutions. It also will provide IC designs that will drive ICAMR’s manufacturing research.\n\nThe announcement was made just days before a major technology trade show on the West Coast.\n\n“Imec’s international prestige gives us the opportunity to leverage its standing in a field that is growing exponentially in order to recruit more partners and funding for our work at the new Design Center and the Florida Advanced Manufacturing Research Center,” said Osceola County Commission Chairwoman Viviana Janer. “The relationships and people that imec brings to our operation are tangible ways that Osceola County’s 5-year, $15 million investment will be more than re-paid. It’s important to realize that the new Design Center is going to capture the attention of everyone in this field, thereby ensuring maximum utilization and value of the FAMRC.”\n\nThe Design Center will add a much-needed suite of services for companies that want to develop and manufacture innovative electronics, but cannot currently do so in the United States. It will focus on products and systems critical to U.S. markets, including healthcare, aerospace, security, and transportation.\n\nThe state-of-the-art research on photonics and high-speed electronics IC design is a scientific discipline where life-changing discoveries are fueling the explosive growth of products used every day, everywhere, and by everybody.\n\n“The imec design center is the funnel that will fill ICAMR with high-value manufacturing opportunities and we will work closely with them to make sure our capabilities tightly align with their technology direction,” said ICAMR CEO Chester Kennedy. “This partnership is poised to shine the global high-tech spotlight on Central Florida.”\n\nThe initial seed money for imec Florida will come from Osceola County and the University of Central Florida. The new center will attract top talent through future strategic partnerships, with the aim to employ about 10 scientists and engineers by the end of the year and increase to 100 researchers in the next five years. Officials say that they are leveraging their investment – and imec’s reputation – to draw more substantial industry funding.\n\n“By attracting the best partners from around the world, the new Design Center will give our region and the state a global competitive advantage in photonics and nanotechnology,” said UCF Provost and Executive Vice President Dale Whittaker. “By working and innovating together, we will lift our community and transform our future.”\n\nOn Monday, the institute will introduce imec Florida to the semiconductor industry at its annual ITF USA, a half-day conference in San Francisco, Calif. ITF USA is part of imec’s prestigious worldwide ITF events, organized in conjunction with SEMICON West and supported by SEMI. With the theme ‘Towards the Ultimate System,’ imec’s highly acclaimed speakers and industrial keynote speakers will look at the co-optimization of design and new technology, and how technology innovation can deliver the right building blocks to build these systems.\n\n- - -\n\nABOUT imec\n\nImec performs world-leading research in electronics and photovoltaics. imec leverages its scientific knowledge with the innovative power of its global partnerships in ICT, healthcare and energy.

Ltd.), imec India (Imec IMEC India Private Limited) and imec USA (IMEC Inc).\n\n- - -\n\nABOUT OSCEOLA COUNTY\n\nOsceola County is a fast-growing, dynamic and innovative community. While we honor the history and traditions passed down from our pioneer ranching families, we are focused on a vision to be the center of research and manufacturing innovation for “smart sensors” that will supercharge the regional economy as the leader in what will be a $154 billion industry by 2020. As part of the Orlando Metropolitan Area, we proudly host approximately 7 million annual overnight guests who enjoy easy access to Central Florida’s world-famous theme parks and Osceola County’s unique sights and unmatched hospitality.\n\n- - -\n\nABOUT ICAMR\n\nThe International Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing Research invites leading global companies with Internet-of-Everything manufacturing endeavors to participate in an industry-friendly consortium for advanced sensors, photonics and optics, and other advanced device manufacturing opportunities. ICAMR is initially targeting the mega-growth technologies that will lead to over 50 billion devices being connected by sensors by the beginning of the next decade. ICAMR will develop innovative manufacturable processes, materials, and equipment for advanced sensors and other future high-tech products (emitters, modulators, energy and communications devices/systems). By leveraging unique emerging technology capabilities, processes, and background IP, ICAMR will develop advanced lab/fab and universal technology platforms with the economy of scale needed for cost-effective manufacturing.\n\nWHAT THEY’RE SAYING\n\nCissy Proctor, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity\n\n“The International Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing Research is fostering incredible growth in Florida’s high-tech, high-wage sectors. DEO is proud to be a partner in the consortium’s efforts to attract top companies like imec to Central Florida, provide jobs for STEM graduates and increase our competitiveness in the global marketplace.”\n\nCrystal Sircy, executive vice president and COO of Enterprise Florida\n\n“This is an incredibly important opportunity for Central Florida and the entire state. Adding imec provides a big boost to Florida’s high-tech industry and will further highlight the significance of ICAMR in the state. Thanks to partnerships across the region, we’re able to welcome imec to Florida and share the state’s strengths in sensor technology.”"
