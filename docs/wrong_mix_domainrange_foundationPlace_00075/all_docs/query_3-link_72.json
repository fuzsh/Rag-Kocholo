        "text": "This article uses the art exhibition “Wetware: Art, Agency, Animation” as a case study to argue that bioart employs education as Bildung. Bildung, based on the holistic unity of science and art, is translated in English simply as “education” but within German means “shaping,” “training,” “growth,” “culture,” “maturation,” and “humane education.” Bildung through bioart makes science accessible to the public while not foregoing the abstraction or disinterestedness of the artistic endeavor. The exhibition brings to the mass public the debate over the scientific definition of life through art that mixes living materials with biotechnology, or “wetware.” The term “wetware” supersedes computer-based metaphors of life, such as hardware and software, in how it incorporates the biological understanding of life while making fluid the distinction between organisms and machines. Based on this concept, the message of “Wetware” is that “life” is defined in the plural, as a matter of limit biologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, marine extremophiles, astrobiology.\n\nThe use of intersectional variables of privilege and discrimination as political tools is set in crisis by our postantropocentric awareness. Transgressive creative alternatives are necessary and can come from speculation and fiction, and, I contend, from the hybrid materiality of Art and Biology. This paper argues that this alternative can be found in the Speculative Imagination of Alfred North Whitehead as an intellectual exercise of responsibly opening up to \" the possible \" , reconnecting with the materiality of art and of biomatter to recover accountability as theorized by Rosi Braidotti's New Materialism, and functioning as Donna Haraway's SF Hybrids in the post dualistic struggle. The most basic example of life, microorganisms, is used as the material grounding and subject of this hybrid material speculation, expressly in The Yeast and the Host by Philippe Parreno, Nomadic Plants by Gilberto Esparza and Micro-rhythms by Interspecifics. This project maps out an area of alternatives that advocate political accountability in the logic of the posthuman.\n\nWhen first approaching a topic such as the concept of soul in Greek literature, the researcher might be puzzled. While in diverse contemporary cultures, numerous theriomorphic figures (bears, ravens, mice, wasps, bees, dragonflies, and dung-beetles) serve to represent the human soul in its transmigration from life to death, this is not the case in Greek culture. At least, this is what one may conclude from the monograph written by the Dutch scholar J. Bremmer, The early Greek Concept of the Soul: \"importunely, there are no other indications of a possible connection between the butterfly and the soul of the living and the dead\" (1987: 64). Given Plutarch’s great interest in the soul, which can be seen in a variety of texts referring to its generation, form, internal dichotomy, material substance, origin and destination, etc., the question arises as to whether Plutarch also includes such a representation of the soul when departing from the dead body. Does the corpus plutarcheum preserve and transmit such conception of the human soul? And if it does, are we dealing with survival of ancestral beliefs or motifs or is it a simple metaphor by means of which ancients intended to express the departing of the life-breath? In the following pages I will focus on three texts that allegedly include the butterfly-motif to represent the human soul, to wit, Table Talks 636C, Consolation to his Wife 611F, and the fragment 177 Sandbach.\n\nVittorio Gallese and Michele Guerra’s seminal article on the relation between embodied simulation and Film Studies mentions ‘at least three types of embodiment related to cinema: i) film style as embodiment; ii) acting style as embodiment; iii) viewer’s responses to filmed bodies and objects as embodiment’ (206). I would like to extend Gallese and Guerra’s typology with another domain through which embodied cognition relates to cinema. By revealing some of the physiological, psychological, and environmental constraints and constituents of viewers’ meaning making processes in film, this chapter brings narrative theories and embodied cognitive approaches into collaboration, exposing the relation between film narrative and embodied cognition. Generally, the following chapter addresses the question ‘how the thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of the minimal embodied and ecologically embedded self give rise to [film] narratives’ (Menary Embodied Narratives 75). Specifically, my contribution aims to unravel the initial, pre-cognitive part of a complex process that guides one’s narrative meaning making activity. While I will touch upon the theory of cognitive mental models and their relation to the invocation of narrative models, the main focus will be on embodied image schemas, as dynamic patterns of our shared bodily interactions, and their formative role in the initiation of elementary narrative schemas, as deeply embodied, internally organized formal gestalts. The present chapter consists of five parts. Following an introduction and a concise overview of the relevant aspects of (1) embodied cognition and (2) image schemas, I present a working definition of (3) narrative form that corresponds with the introduced theoretical approach. Narrowing down my focus to viewers’ meaning making processes of organizing information into intelligible forms (4), the chapter offers an attempt at connecting embodied and cognitive (that is embodied-cognitive) approaches with narrative theories, supporting a general explanatory model of understanding narrative film. Lastly, (5) the presented theoretical arguments will be illustrated through examples that elucidate the reliance of various narrative forms on embodied cognition. In order to confine theoretical redundancy among the chapters of this volume to the minimum, I have kept the overview of embodied cognition brief, and have chosen to concentrate on its specific relevance to the construction and comprehension of narrative forms.\n\nThis paper analyzes some of Solon’s verses (frgs. 9,1-2 and 12 West) transmitted by Plutarch, in the Vita Solonis, as well as the comments made by the biographer on the structural meaning of these compositions in what respects the ‘simplistic’ philosophical thinking of the Athenian poet. Along with frg. 9, also frgs. 10 and 11 West are presented in their testimonies as warnings against the tyranny of Pisistratus. That the idea of tyranny was very present in Solon’s poetry is undisputed, even if his feelings towards this form of government are not always unambiguous. Taking as a backdrop the notion of tyranny as a ‘forceful way or ruling’, a new explanation is proposed to the image of the undisturbed quietness of the sea’s surface, which Solon describes in frg. 12,2 as δικαιοτάτη: ‘the most righteous’, ‘the most just’ or ‘the most calm’."
