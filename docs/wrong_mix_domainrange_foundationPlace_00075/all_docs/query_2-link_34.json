        "text": "DIGITAL SME has opened an office in the heart of Silicon Valley, as an anchor for the expansion of European digital SMEs to a vibrant tech’ ecosystem and to create synergies with local partners and authorities\n\nA US landing program will support European SMEs through all the necessary steps for their expansion, including a one-week trip to Silicon Valley to meet investors and clients\n\nA first SME delegation to Silicon Valley is scheduled for 6-11 October 2024, with applications open until 31 July\n\nIn line with the recent launch of its Investment and Procurement Platform, DIGITAL SME has opened an office in the heart of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. It will serve both as an anchor for the expansion of European digital SMEs to a vibrant tech ecosystem and to create synergies with local partners and authorities.\n\nMany innovative European SMEs can expand operations to other markets. Yet willingness may be hindered by a lack of understanding of extra-European market requirements. In partnership with the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Hub Silicon Valley, the establishing of an office in the United States’ most dynamic innovation hub creates a solid base for effective SME expansion.\n\nRegular trips to Silicon Valley are expected each year. A US landing program is notably available, supporting European SMEs through all the necessary steps for their expansion (first assessment of product or service, market research, go-to-market planning…) before a one-week trip to Silicon Valley, meeting with local partners, investors, and clients. Formal applications will be welcomed in the next months.\n\nBeyond the scaling incentive for SMEs, this office will offer new capacity for a strong collective representation of SME interests in Silicon Valley. DIGITAL SME aims to align positioning with the EU’s Liaison Office to Silicon Valley, ensuring that smaller companies’ voices are taken into account when reflecting EU interests in the region. It will also directly engage with Big Tech companies and local authorities, voicing European tech SMEs’ concerns. Major European legislation has been passed throughout the last European Commission mandate, the details of which (and SME implications) are not always known to all US stakeholders. Serving as an embassy for all European digital SMEs at large, the DIGITAL SME’s new Silicon Valley office will constitute a steady additional pillar for the EU’s tech diplomacy in the region.\n\nThe first SME delegation to Silicon Valley is planned for 6-11 October 2024. Companies can expect a week of exposure to key actors, with visits to leading tech companies, universities, and other organisations embedded in the local innovation ecosystem. They will have the possibility to establish first contacts, in view of an eventual comprehensive follow-up through the US landing program. More details on the business trip can be found at the following page.\n\nInterested companies are invited to register in the below form by 31 July, and participate in the information session scheduled on 15 July. Pricing is of 499€ for DIGITAL SME Club Members, 999€ for Members of Members, and 1499€ for non-members. Travel and accommodation fees are under the company’s own costs.\n\nDIGITAL SME calls on all interested members to come forward and stands ready to cooperate with the EU’s Silicon Valley Liaison Office and local US stakeholders in this new venture."
