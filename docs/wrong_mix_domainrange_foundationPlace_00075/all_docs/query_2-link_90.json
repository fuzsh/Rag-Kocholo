Your task will be to carry out foundational research in the context of the payment system GNU Taler. More precisely, you will be tasked with proving the security of post-quantum replacements for the cryptography used to secure GNU Taler. The position is initially 1 year with funding for a 1-year extension available.\n\nGNU Taler is a privacy-preserving payment system. Customers can stay anonymous, but merchants cannot hide their income through payments with GNU Taler. This helps to avoid tax evasion and money laundering while providing users with a privacy-preserving way of electronic payment. As part of a Next Generation Internet pilot, the cryptography used in GNU Taler will be future-proofed by developing post-quantum secure variants of the involved protocols. Your task will be to prove these new protocols secure against quantum adversaries, closely collaborating with the team that develops the protocols.\n\nIf you have a PhD in cryptography or a related area, please apply online via the TU/e website.\n\nJoin our Cryptographic Engineering research team at the Technical University of Graz (TU Graz) in Austria! We are seeking a one PhD / one postdoctoral researchers.\n\nYou will contribute to an exciting research project advancing isogeny-based cryptography. This role offers a unique opportunity to collaborate with leading experts in the field and perform cutting-edge research.\n\nThe Cryptographic Engineering research team is based at IAIK, TU Graz, the largest university institute in Austria for research and education in security and privacy. It has been active in this field for more than 30 years and currently employs more than 60 researchers.\n\nRequired Qualifications for PhD position: The ideal candidate for the PhD position will hold a master's degree with project experience in the implementation aspects (e.g., efficient implementation, side-channel analysis, fault analysis, etc.) of cryptography, preferably in isogeny-based cryptography.\n\nRequired Qualifications for Postdoc position: The ideal candidate for the postdoc position will hold a PhD (or be close to completion) in cryptography and be an expert in isogeny-based cryptography and/or secure implementation aspects of cryptography.\n\nHow to apply: Submit your applications, CV, and other documents before 31st July, 2024.\n\nhttps://jobs.tugraz.at/en/jobs/bbba0417-7a9c-69a5-f012-6613bd4b383f/apply?preview=true\n\nThe candidate will work alongside Prof. Martin Albrecht, Dr. Benjamin Dowling, Dr. Rikke Bjerg Jensen (Royal Holloway University of London) and Dr. Andrea Medrado (Exeter) on establishing social foundations of cryptography in protest settings. In particular, the candidate will work with a multi-disciplinary team of cryptographers (Dowling, Albrecht) and ethnographers (Jensen, Medrado) to understand the security needs of participants in protests, to formalise these needs as cryptographic security notions and to design or analyse cryptographic solutions with respect to these notions.\n\nThis position is part of the EPSRC-funded project “Social Foundations of Cryptography” and more information is available at https://social-foundations-of-cryptography.gitlab.io/.\n\nIn brief, ethnography is a social science method involving prolonged fieldwork, i.e. staying with the group under study, to observe not only what they say but also what their social reality and practice is. In this project, we are putting cryptography at the mercy of ethnographic findings, allowing them to shape what we model.\n\nAre you interested in devising private-enhancing technologies and cryptographic protocols?\n\nPrivacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Federated Learning (FL) allow parties to collaboratively analyze a collection of data partitions where each data partition is contributed by a different party (such as banks, or law enforcement agencies).\n\nTwo facts about most PETs exist: (i) often the output of PETs reveals some information about the parties’ private input sets (i.e., the computation result in FL or MPC), and (ii) various variants of PETs do not output the result to all parties, even in those PETs that do, not all of the parties are necessarily interested in it. Given these facts, a natural question arises: How can we incentivize parties that do not receive the result or do not express interest in it to participate in PETs?\n\nThis project aims to develop new PETs that incentivize participants to share their sensitive data by fairly rewarding them. Additionally, the project aims to ensure these PETs remain secure even when adversaries compromise some parties. The Secure and Resilient Systems research group (and possibly Edge AI Hub) will host the successful candidate at the Urban Science Building, Newcastle University.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\nThe studentship covers fees at the UK rate. International applicants are welcome to apply but will be required to cover the difference between UK and International fees.\n\nCandidate must have a strong background in math and computer programming (e.g., C++, Python, or Java).\n\nYou must have, or expect to gain, a minimum 2:1 Honours degree or international equivalent in computer science, cybersecurity, mathematics, or software engineering.\n\nFurther Information: For more information and instructions on how to apply take a look at this webpage:\n\nhttps://shorturl.at/PGX3Z\n\nXiamen University Malaysia is now seeking highly motivated, committed and qualified individuals for academic teaching positions in computer science and cyber security.\n\nCandidates in computer science and cyber security are welcome to apply. The ideal candidate is expected to be able to support general computing subjects, as well as cyber security specialization subjects.
