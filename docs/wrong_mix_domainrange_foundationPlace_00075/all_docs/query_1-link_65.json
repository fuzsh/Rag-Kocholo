        "text": "The objective of this activity is to comprehensively explore the application of generative AI within the SatCom industry. This includes understanding the current state-of-the-art in generative AI across various sectors and identifying how these tools and techniques can be adapted for SatCom applications.\n\nThe project aims at reaching TRL8 for the CASTeC software as a service platform, which is an add-on functionality to Mission Control Software, implementing advanced telemetry checking in support to operations of satellites constellations. CASTeC provides early and context-based identification of anomalies in the behaviour of satellites, and identification of correlated events and telemetries, enabling fault isolation and mitigation strategies definition, supporting the troubleshooting operations. CASTeC also provides estimates of the Remaining Useful Life of the monitored satellite components.\n\nIn this activity, a new class of RF components addressing future needs for ground segment network equipment in Q-, V-, and W-bands is developed. These components are produced monolithically using new Additive Manufacturing (AM) process with finer resolution to ensure lower insertion loss and better axial ratio (due to avoidance of assembly/alignment and interfaces) as well as lower production costs.\n\nThe motivation behind this project was the fact that extensive research is ongoing within (terrestrial) telecommunications to develop and standardize future mobile networks without much thought of the potential exploitation of satellites. At the same time, research specific to satellite-based telecommunications is just a fraction of its terrestrial counterpart and often said to be at least 5 years behind. By looking at new technology, standardization, and concepts in the terrestrial domain, we wanted to identify a number of key areas where the satellite industry can adopt or reuse in order to close this gap.\n\nThe general objective of the activity is to identify promising services in case wearables can communicate directly with communications satellites within the next 5 years. Five short-term Proof-of-Concepts are demonstrated with current satellite IoT systems.\n\nThe activity shall stimulate the discussions around wearable satcom and – more in general - shall trigger a notion that satcom could be economically an option for the wearable market.\n\nThe SPECSI project examined the role of satellites in future communication networks and applications in 2020-25. It studied emerging ICT trends to identify future opportunities for satcom and their associated system propositions. The outputs of the study are designed to help ESA understand how the European and Canadian satellite industry can be best supported through its ARTES programme.\n\nThe CYBERSAT project aims at investigating the effects of the current and upcoming cyber security regulations issued at European level on future satellite communication (SATCOM) systems and services. The twofold objective is, on the one hand, to identify and analyse the cyber security regulations and to assess their impact on the design, development and operations of SATCOM systems; on the other hand, to identify new SATCOM service opportunities fostered by these regulations.\n\nThe purpose of the project is to perform a study on the Integration of Satellite Backhauled HAPS in Future SATCOM Networks. The project covers a case selection and scenario definition, followed by a suitability analysis, identification of necessary adaptations in the 5G standard and development and validation of the adaptations. The project ends with the conclusions, roadmap and recommendations.\n\nMETAMORPHOSIS will define (a) cross-industry cooperation opportunities offered to the European and Canadian satellite industry when considering the convergence of SatCom with the 5G terrestrial business/solutions/technologies/operational concepts for the targeted verticals of transport, media and public safety, (b) integrated satellite terrestrial reference architecture enabling service integration across different verticals, (c) technology development roadmaps and strategic actions necessary for the European & Canadian industry to be able to address these opportunities.\n\nUnhindered access to frequency spectrum is of fundamental importance to the whole satellite services sector and hence to the manufacturing industry it supports. This activity supported the satellite community both in the run-up and aftermath of the World Radio Conference 2019, and initiated preparation for the 2023 World Radio Conference.\n\nThrough its activities, ALIX supports the satellite communication community to engage with 3GPP in order to develop contributions and advocate positions favourable to the SatCom sector within the 3GPP standardisation process such that they result in tangible industrial opportunities.\n\nThe project gathers organizations from the satellite communication community each holding key positions in 3GPP and ETSI as contributors, rapporteurs of study items or chairmanship of Working Group.\n\nElaborate a vision and propose a strategy for the satellite telecom sector based on an innovative yet realistic technology roadmap, to both alleviate risks and exploit opportunities of the “Digital Disruption” that will affect most sectors of the world economy, and the IT and media industry in particular, in the coming decade.\n\nGovsatcom services shall be provided to European Public Safety entities thanks to different means : classic commercial services, adequate procurement schemes to ensure immediate and guarantee access on either commercial assets or governmental assets, or dedicated Govsatcom assets. The aim of Securesat study is: first, to assess the Users and Mission requirements for Govsatcom communications, secondly to identify existing (or soon to be deployed) assets and adequate procurement models that can answer to these requirements,and then to identify the remaining gap and to define complementary new assets to fulfil the full set of requirements. The candidate solutions shall be evaluated through a trade-off to identify the best solutions (taking into account cost-effective parameters). Among the future assets, the development that could be part of a precursor will be identified and a first design will be realised.\n\nThis project covers the realization of an innovative Frequency Converter prototype of the WIF2C product meant to be used for LEO/MEO/GEO applications. Its concept differentiates from existing solutions by its integrated, flexible, modular and configurable design able to support multiple wideband frequency up/down conversion chains for current telecom satellite platforms and future trends."
