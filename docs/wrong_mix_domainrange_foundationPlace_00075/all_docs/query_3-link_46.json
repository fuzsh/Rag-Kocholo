        "text": "Time flies: 1500 days ago (Jan. 11, 2018) we started Tusk IC. In those 4 years, we were able to add amazing people to our team, work on beyond-state-of-the-art Silicon designs and push forward innovation in the mmWave spectrum. All while going through a pandemic and unseen turbulence in the semiconductor sector.\n\nThis wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the perseverance of the team, the support of your partners and the trust of our clients. A very big thank you to you all!\n\nThe Tusk Team is growing and we‚Äôre all very excited to keep on surfing the mmWaves in the coming years!\n\nInterested to join us? Check our career page!\n\nhttps://tusk-ic.com/careers/\n\nOn Wednesday 16/02/2022, Tusk IC invites you to their Company Day aimed at students interested in RF/mmWave IC design. Tusk IC is a fabless silicon design house, focused on high-frequency mmWave chip design for 5G, Satcom, Radar, Autonomous driving and future 6G applications.\n\nDo you want to know how Tusk IC surfs these mmWaves and how you can become part of it? Contact us at careers@tusk-ic.com or via our website https://tusk-ic.com/2021/12/21/company-day-2022/ .\n\nGood luck with your exams and hope to see you all in February!\n\nNederlands:\n\nOp woensdag 16/02/2022 zal Tusk IC haar Opendeurdag houden voor studenten met interesse in RF en mmWave IC design. Tusk IC is een design house gespecialiseerd in het ontwerpen van hoog-frequente mmWave chips for 5G, Satcom, radar, Autonomous driving en de toekomstige 6G toepassingen.\n\nWil je meer weten over hoe Tusk IC op de mmWave golven surft en hoe je hier deel van kan worden? Contacteer ons via careers@tusk-ic.com of via de website https://tusk-ic.com/2021/12/21/company-day-2022/ .\n\nVeel success met de examenperiode, en hopelijk tot in Februari!\n\nWhile we are used to doing the technical work remotely at Tusk IC, nothing compares to an in-person (Covid-proof!) team event.\n\nAfter a lot of precautions (and sometimes waiting until the last minute for receiving delayed test results), the team went bowling in mid-November. The location was the aptly named Bowling Stones in Antwerpen, and we had the whole place to ourselves!\n\nIn the end, we discovered some hidden bowling gems in our team. On the other hand, some players started to doubt if they we left-handed, right-handed or ambidextrous based on their scores üòÄ\n\nAs is tradition, the evening was closed in one our favorite restaurants near the Tusk office in Antwerpen.\n\nWith the ever-changing Covid situation and the holiday season coming up, its difficult to find a new date for the next team event. Luckily we have the Santa Claus gift bag to bridge the gap until 2022 üòâ\n\nAnother year, another successful audit of the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System (QMS) at Tusk IC.\n\nTusk IC aims to continuously improve and to be a reliable partner for its stakeholders by providing mmWave ASIC solutions in a timely, qualitative and efficient manner.\n\nThe ISO 9001 framework helps us in doing this and supports our continued growth as a provider of mmWave innovation!\n\nA copy of our ISO 9001:2015 certificate and objectives can be found here.\n\nLast week, Yicun Guo successfully completed his RF/mmWave summer internship at Tusk IC.\n\nYicun is a master student Electronics and Chip Design (ECD) at the University of Leuven (Belgium), starting his final master year soon. His thesis on 5G mmWave Power Amplifiers will be done under the supervision of prof. Patrick Reynaert and Valdrin Qunaj.\n\nThanks Yicun for making our company‚Äôs first internship experience such a nice one, and the wonderful closing dinner. We wish you the best of luck with your master thesis research!\n\nA few weeks back, we organized an outdoor canoeing event in Mechelen as our first big Covid-proof team event. For the team members who joined Tusk IC during the Covid times, this was their first (of hopefully many!) event with the whole team.\n\nGood weather, some synchronization challenges in the rowing pairs and a tasty dinner in the ViaVia restaurant afterwards made it fun and memorable.\n\nIf you or someone you know is looking for a challenge in analog, RF and mmWave IC design be sure to check our careers page https://tusk-ic.com/careers/ We hope to see you on the next Tusk Team event!\n\nThe Tusk IC team continues to grow, which means that more and more team members have been coming to the office in the past few months. Luckily, we have expanded our office in Antwerp with an additional floor in the Art-Nouveau townhouse we call home!\n\nBesides a large recreational room + kitchen, small terrace and extra meeting room, we have also launched our new line of branded mugs in Tusk IC Blue üòâ\n\nIf you are interested in joining our growing team and surf the mmWaves with us, visit https://tusk-ic.com/careers/ for our open positions for sr. analog and sr. RF/mmWave IC designer!\n\nAfter the first in-person portion of the IMS/RFIC 2021 conference, the virtual part will start next week.\n\nBesides great technical presentations, you will also be able to attend the RFIC Panel session on Tuesday June 22nd where our very own Wouter Steyaert will discuss on ‚ÄúRFIC Startups: A Dead Horse in the Era of Software Unicorns and Pandemics?‚Äù.\n\nThis panel consists entrepreneurs with different levels of maturity of their companies, who will share their experiences on how to bootstrap the activities from a funding point of view, what challenges they have been facing, and their business strategies to compete in a given market\n\nIt promises to be an interesting discussion, hope to see you there!"
