        "text": "The Japanese have always been passionate about baseball. They played baseball in Yokohama with American sailors in the 1890s and then in Hawaii where the first Issei moved. They created teams in California, Oregon, and Washington. These teams traveled to Japan and invited Japanese teams to the US for games. Since 1905 when the Waseda University baseball team toured to America, both countries have regularly extended and accepted invitations from each other.\n\nThe San Jose Asahi baseball team was the first team in SJ Japantown. The team’s success was possible because of the community’s warm support. In 1925 the San Jose Asahi team traveled to Japan where they played against Meiji University, Waseda University, Keio University, and Todai University. After that the team joined the Northern California Japanese Baseball League. (It's really interesting that Asahi was one of the most popular names for Japanese American teams at that time. What was that, if not the “dawn” of Japanese American baseball?) If you would like to learn more about baseball in San Jose Japantown, I recommend you read the book “From Asahi to Zebras” by Ralph M. Pearce. It is a great book with rare photos and interviews with team members.\n\nDuring World War II baseball became a real salvation for those in the internment camps; in difficult times it gave hope to everyone, young and old and was something to look forward to in the bleak camp life. After the war, as the Japanese Americans rebuilt their lives from scratch, they did not lose their passion and enthusiasm for their favorite game.\n\nToday baseball has become a symbol of the history of Japanese-American relations. Sport unites people, helps to build community and preserve the memory of ancestors.\n\nBaseball was not so popular in the country where I was born, so I did not watch baseball games growing up, but I read lots of manga! I was really surprised when I found a baseball manga “Sportsman Kintarou” in an old issue of “Shuukan Shounen Sunday”(1959). The history of baseball in Japan was longer than I thought. What was the role of manga in baseball’s popularity?\n\n“Supokon” or sports manga, is one of the most well-liked genre of manga. Stories about sumo, rugby, swimming, martial arts, boxing, figure skating and, of course, baseball attract many readers of all ages. The plot of sports manga is not so complicated. It’s usually about hard work, perseverance, team spirit, friendship, and competition. The main character (a very talented player or a total loser) challenges himself, joins the team or creates his own team, and finally wins a big game. The romantic part can also be added.\n\nWith the growing popularity of sports manga in the 60s-70s, many baseball manga became huge hits in Japan and motivated young boys to play baseball. Manga artists Ikki Kajiwara and Noboru Kawasaki breathed life into baseball manga “Kyojin no Hoshi” (Star of the Giants). They created a captivating story with a detailed description of the strategy of the game and the appearance of the mystical \"makyu:\" (magic pitch), a special technique, a skill bordering on magic. The rivals of the main character try to logically explain that \"magic\" for several pages.\n\nManga Ace of the Diamond - Kodansha is definitely one of the most popular supokon with a typical plot and a “makyu:”. Young player Eijun Sawamura has an ability to change his pitch and force the ball to move unpredictably. Prestigious Seido School offers him a scholarship and a chance to make it to the nationals. His dream is to see his team bring home the championship title.\n\nQ. You offered your service as part of the museum’s fund-raising auction to create chalk art for the highest bidder. What happened after that?\n\nIt hasn't happened yet, but I'm planning on drawing it for the Jtown Art Walk on September 10th and 11th. The location will be the San Jose Buddhist Church Betsuin at 640 N 5th St, San Jose, CA 95112. The highest bidder is actually a friend of mine and she's sent me many images of what kind of themes she's interested in. Her ideas are great and I'm really looking forward to working on it! I don't want to spoil it, so I'll leave it a surprise. Come by for the Jtown Art Walk to watch me work!\n\nI will also be talking as one of the panelists at the Japantown Artist Panel that is scheduled at 5:30 on September 10 at the JAMsj parking lot.\n\nQ. What is your day job? And how do you like to spend your time outside of the museum?\n\nI work as a UI/UX designer for my full-time job. In my free time, I like to draw, paint, play video games, practice my Japanese, and travel the world. I've started my own small business, selling my artwork as various merchandise like prints, cards, pins, stickers, and T-shirts. I like going to art fairs to connect with people and share my creativity with the public. Some of my products will be for sale at the museum store so please come by and visit!\n\nQ. What's next on your horizon?\n\nI actually just accepted a new job offer in Tokyo so I will be moving to Japan in October. I will be designing applications for a new smart city being built in Shizuoka, Japan.\n\nI will dearly miss the museum and the San Jose community, but I'll definitely come back! To everyone who has ever seen my artwork around Japantown, online, or anywhere else and felt even just a little bit inspired, thank you! Please continue to support the local San Jose art scene and I appreciate every one of you!\n\nThank you, Momo for all your contributions to JAMsj and San Jose Japantown! We wish you the best of luck with your new job and life in Tokyo!\n\nBy Norri Kageki\n\nMore than 10 years ago, my husband and I went to Tule Lake and were disappointed to find only two small acknowledgements of the site’s wartime history: a dusty roadside sign and a very small display in the nearby Lava Beds National Monument Visitor Center. So when we visited last month, we were happy to discover that the National Park Service had opened a new visitor center in June, and we had arrived just in time to join a tour of the jail constructed by none other than Japanese American Museum of San Jose co-founder Jimi Yamaichi.\n\nInside the Tule Lake Internment Camp Jail\n\nTule Lake was the largest of the 10 WWII camps run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA), and it was also the only one with a jail. This was because Tule Lake was a maximum security site that incarcerated Japanese Americans who answered “no - no” to two notorious survey questions intended to identify potential enemies. In reality, the survey questions were so poorly worded that many Japanese Americans answered “no - no” out of confusion, suspicion or other reasons.\n\nAfter the park ranger unlocked the gate, and we drove towards the historic wartime jail, it was truly dramatic to see the lone building in a vast, dusty field, with craggy mountain bluffs looming in the background. Our park ranger led us through various rooms of the jail and told many stories about its history, including how Yamaichi, a master carpenter, initially refused the WRA’s request to oversee the jail’s construction, but later relented when told the WRA would just find someone else. As foreman, Yamaichi tried to delay construction of the jail as much as possible, demanding the highest-grade construction materials, which were difficult to come by. While the barracks, guard towers, and other buildings were dismantled and removed after the war , it is because the jail was so well built with such sturdy materials that it still stands today.\n\nTell us about yourself, Jocelyn.\n\nI was born in Redwood Shores and raised in Los Altos, California. I went to Los Altos High School, then graduated Wesleyan University with a BA in Psychology this past May. I’ll be pursuing my Master’s through Wesleyan’s BA/MA program, and my thesis will be on meaning-making among underrepresented members of the class of 2024 at Wesleyan (the class year that entered college during the pandemic). My professional interests lie in organizational development, specifically in evaluating how organization-wide values impact day to day actions and strategic planning. Outside of academics and professional work, I’m a hip hop dancer, experimental poet, rock climber, and ex-journalist. I also spend a lot of my time writing, thinking, and holding conversations about community and care. Particularly as someone who holds multiple marginalized identities, I consider understanding how to survive within and build outside of oppressive systems urgent work. A lot of that has its grounding in care, both at the self and interpersonal levels, so that tends to be my north star in everything I do.\n\nFor readers who may be unfamiliar with hip hop, what are some resources you can point them to?\n\nI would recommend watching this short documentary with Sophia Chang, former manager of A Tribe Called Quest and members of Wu-Tang Clan, among other artists who were influential in shaping the hip hop scene in the 1980s and 1990s. She was the first Asian woman in hip hop, and in this documentary she talks about how she discovered hip hop and how she got started in her career, along with her experiences sharing her culture with Wu-Tang and learning from their culture as well.\n\nYou mentioned that you also do experimental poetry. Can you talk a little more about that?\n\nI started writing poetry when I was 15, and I’ve always been drawn to more experimental styles. Some of my favorite poets in this genre are Danielle Vogel (who I’m incredibly lucky to call my mentor), fahima ife, and Layli Long Soldier. Experimental poetics, to me, challenge our relationship with language and make visible our associations with different words and word arrangements. Experimental poetry provides a really beautiful interruption in how we use language, and I’ve carried the lessons I’ve learned through this art form into every area of my life.\n\nWhy did you apply to be a Nikkei Community intern?\n\nAs a Gosei growing up without a lot of other Japanese Americans in my hometown, I didn’t really explore what it meant to be Japanese American until I started learning more about my family history through my grandfather, Howard Kakita. He is a sansei kibei, and also a hibakusha (atomic bomb survivor). A few years back we began working on writing up his life story and experience surviving the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He currently gives talks about his experience, and he is one of the last few hibakusha who are both young enough to still give talks and old enough to remember what it was like to survive the bombing. His dedication to sharing his story to educate people inspired me to learn more about my family history and about Japanese culture and history in general. I took classes on Japanese culture and history at Wesleyan, but I still felt like I was missing a sense of JA community. I saw the NCI program as a way that I could connect with the JA community in San Jose and subsequently learn where I could best apply the skills I’ve developed to support the JA community. Since my personal ties to the JA community/JA identity come from historical roots, I was particularly interested in working with JAMsj to understand the work that organizations are doing to preserve and share JA history.\n\nWhat projects did you work on at JAMsj this summer?\n\nThis summer, I worked with the grant writing team and the marketing team. For the grant writing team, I worked with JAMsj’s new Executive Director Taline Mitten to put together a letter of inquiry for new, accessible signage for the museum. On the marketing side, I’m generating a survey for visitors at the museum so JAMsj can receive feedback about how visitors experience the museum. I hope that the survey can benefit not just the marketing team but other areas of the museum as well, so I’ve been interviewing different key people at JAMsj to understand what questions they would like to ask visitors. I also hope that data from this survey can be used by both board members and even serve as a foundation for future JAMsj NCI projects.\n\nNCI interns work for a specific entity, but they also gather with other interns. What are some of the activities you did with the other interns?\n\nWith the other two San Jose NCI interns, Kohei Tsuchitani and Jackson Thompson, I’ve gotten to meet with many people in the San Jose Japantown community who have shaped (and continue to shape) the JA community here. From these meetings, we’ve heard a wide variety of perspectives on the SJ Japantown community and different ways that members of the community first became involved. Everyone we’ve talked to has been so passionate about the community, whether they’ve been involved their entire lives or recently begun forming ties to the community. These meetings have taught me so much about the way the community functions together, the challenges and triumphs experienced by SJ Japantown, and what sets SJ Japantown apart from the other Japantowns. The most representative example of this was probably this year’s Obon. Pam Yoshida from JCCsj graciously hosted us for the afternoon, and she introduced us to many different people who contribute to keeping the community running. Also, as the first Obon back in person since the beginning of the pandemic, and also following the wave of anti-Asian hate crimes related to the pandemic, it was incredible to see the community come together, reconnect, and make space for tradition and joy.\n\nWhat advice would you give to 2023 NCIers?\n\nFirst off: congratulations for being selected! My main advice would be to use your time to develop and learn about your individual strengths while in your placement. I was incredibly lucky to work at JAMsj with Gordon Smith and Chip Hayashi on grant writing and marketing projects respectively, and both of them encouraged me to take on projects and tasks that would develop my professional skills and interests. In doing so, I feel like I’ll be concluding the NCI program having honed skills that I came into the program with, like interviewing and helping people feel at ease, and also having begun to build new skills, like grant writing. Focusing on my strengths (instead of just areas for growth) has also helped to mitigate a lot of imposter syndrome and allowed me to work as a better team member alongside my co-interns through understanding both my strengths and theirs.\n\nWhat influence has the museum had on you that you will carry with you in the next steps of your journey?The museum has taught me so much about what it takes to keep history alive and continue to educate people. It has been such an honor to work with people who care so much about the museum and its mission and who are of multiple different backgrounds, ages, and experiences. I will carry these perspectives with me throughout the next steps of my journey, and I also hope to continue to stay involved with the museum remotely as I return to school.\n\nJocelyn’s last day is August 5th. Thank you to Jocelyn for sharing her story with us. And JAMsj also thanks Jocelyn for her commitment to the NCI program this summer and looks forward to working with her again in the future!\n\nBy Lynda Gomi\n\nObon has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and is one of the most important Buddhist summer holidays. It is believed that at this time the souls of deceased ancestors return to their homes for a few days.\n\nFamilies visit the graves of deceased relatives to honor their spirits, make special offerings for them, and welcome them home. They also light lanterns to guide the souls home and make “spirit animals” from cucumbers and eggplants to ferry ancestors to and from the realm of the dead. In the evening time the festival continues in parks and main streets. People wear yukata and join the traditional dance “bon-odori”, performed to the sounds of folk music. The holiday ends with bonfires in the mountains, fireworks or a special ritual “toro nagashi” (floating lanterns).\n\nAs a manga researcher and a fan of Japanese comics, I’m aware that manga play a significant role in promoting knowledge of Japanese culture around the world. Despite the borrowing of some graphic techniques from Western comics, manga have managed to preserve the features of traditional Japanese aesthetics. Manga artists describe the everyday life of the Japanese, and explain in detail how traditional holidays and festivals (matsuri) are held. There are many manga where the plot is based on an old legend or a historical event. Spirits and demons from Japanese folklore often become the main characters of manga. I’ve learned much about local traditions and rituals from manga and recommend the following manga if you want to learn more about manga and obon.\n\nIn the manga Barakamon, written and illustrated by Satsuki Yoshino, obon is celebrated in a tiny village. Seishu Handa, a young professional calligrapher, is sent by his father to a remote island near Kyushu. He meets the villagers, becomes friends with a little girl, Naru. He learns about local customs and habits, enjoys beautiful nature, and also tries to improve his calligraphy skills. During the Obon celebration, Seishu and Naru visit Naru’s deceased grandmother’s grave. They light paper lanterns and then watch traditional dances and enjoy the festival until late at night.\n\nObon is also featured in the 14th volume of Komi Can’t Communicate written by Tomohito Oda and published by Shogakukan. It was licensed and translated into English by Viz Media. Komi’s family gather at her grandmother’s old home and go to the cemetery together.\n\nThe spirit of the festival part of Obon with carnival booths, fireworks, goldfish scooping, and street food is captured in the manga, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya really well. The main characters Haruhi, Mikuru, and Yuki wear yukata, eat takoyaki, and listen to folk music.\n\nLast year, Shonen Jump, one of the oldest manga magazines, published a special collection of obon-themed manga illustrations in its mobile application. It confirms the importance of the mission of contemporary Japanese culture to support the connection between old and new from generation to generation.\n\nAnd finally, the most romantic or dramatic plot moments in manga comics usually occur during the summer festivals. Check out Orange by Ichigo Takano and Love Hina by Ken Akamatsu.\n\n\"My disease finally brought my family together. I am happy.\"\n\nThis short phrase perfectly reflects the main message of God Said This, a comedy drama and the first performance of the Contemporary Asian Theater Scene (CATS) Summer Hangout Series of Staged Readings featuring Asian American playwrights presented on June 17th and 18th.\n\nGod Said This is a story about love and forgiveness: about a family in which everyone is unique. Masako (Haley Tomtoro), the Japanese mother undergoing chemotherapy treatment in the hospital, is happy that her family is together again for the first time in seven years. James (Miles Bayer), the American father, is a recovering alcoholic who has recently become passionate about collecting rocks and desires to make peace with his daughters who hate him. Sophie (Katy Hedrick), the younger daughter, is a born-again Christian whose faith helps her to deal with her mother’s illness. The elder daughter, Hiro (Whitney Moore), has returned from a successful and fancy life in New York City to be with her mother. She spends time with John (Patrick Rivera), a high school friend who is a single dad. John’s relationship with his 13-year-old son provides a contrast to Hiro's childhood memories of family life.\n\nThe phrase ‘It is unfair!\" is repeated many times during the play. The family cannot deal with their mother's illness and blame each other for all of their past traumas. During the family’s disagreements the characters ask themselves: ‘Why you, but not me?’, ‘Why are you not like me?’ and ‘Why are we so different?’. The family attempts to find different ways to connect with each other as best they can.\n\nDespite the excitement, the actors reveal the full depth of emotions and feelings of their characters gradually over time. Some characters initially appear in an unfavorable light, but step by step, new details emerge about the characters throughout the performance which were previously hidden behind their emotions.\n\nDid you know that besides collecting historical artifacts, creating and displaying exhibits, and organizing community events, the Japanese American Museum of San Jose (JAMsj) also publishes books? We don’t publish books often, but they’ve been well-received by the community and historians alike. JAMsj is proud to announce the second printing of San Jose Japantown: A Journey, a book that chronicles Japantown from its 19th century beginnings adjacent to Heinleinville (the former San Jose Chinatown) to the present day. Written by Curt Fukuda and Ralph M. Pearce, the book was originally published in 2014 and quickly sold out within its first year. Thanks to a generous donation from Mie Barbara Nagareda, JAMsj is printing 1,000 copies of the book, which includes corrections by the authors.\n\nThe beautiful hardcover book features Images from all eras, maps, and reminisces from people whose lives were involved with San Jose Japantown. The book is available for Pre-order with Early Bird Pricing of $65 until July 4.\n\nLearn more about the book and Japantown itself in our Q&A with the authors below.\n\nQ. What do you hope that readers will gain by reading the book?\n\nRalph: I hope that readers will gain a sense of appreciation for not only the uniqueness of our historic and ethnically diverse Japantown, but for the life stories of individuals who lived and persevered through racism, the Depression, and war.\n\nCurt: I hope the readers will enjoy learning about the culturally rich and diverse Japantown. There are amazing stories, photos and maps that tell the story of a community that was a sanctuary to the early Asians and now provides a home to a multicultural neighborhood. Ralph and I made sure that this was not a yearbook that only a handful of locals could appreciate. The book was written as a journey through history that anyone can pick up and appreciate, even if you never heard of San Jose or of Japantown.\n\nQ. What updates have you made to the book?\n\nRalph: Our team is grateful that relatively few errors have come to our attention over the years since the publication of the book in 2014. We’ve taken the opportunity of this second printing to correct those, and include just a few updates here and there. Perhaps the most significant relates to the new construction on the old Heinlenville property adjacent to Japantown.\n\nCurt: The updates are not extensive. This book is essentially a reprint. We have corrected the errors that were found in the first book. Thank goodness, there weren’t many and nearly all were minor. We also added a few new photos, a land acknowledgement and some new information, especially mentioning the huge development on the former Heinlenville property.\n\nQ. How has San Jose Japantown changed since you wrote the first edition of the book?\n\nRalph: Our Japantown is a living, breathing community, and has been changing and evolving since its inception as an outgrowth of our 1887 Heinlenville Chinatown. The community is currently struggling with the difficult issues of crime, homelessness and the shortage of affordable housing in San Jose. These issues affect all communities in San Jose, of course, though some, like Japantown, are particularly vulnerable. Japantown has certainly dealt with adversity in the past, and one can only be hopeful that it will endure.\n\nCurt: As Ralph mentioned, the community continues to evolve and faces many of the issues that other neighborhoods in San Jose face. Since the first printing of the book, we lost San Jose Tofu and Wing’s Restaurant, two longtime businesses that were essential destinations for many residents. We lost a few other businesses that were popular with the locals. This is not to say that Japantown is disappearing because as one business closes, another one opens in its place.\n\nQ. What do you think is needed to keep San Jose Japantown a vibrant community for decades to come?\n\nRalph: Within the three remaining Japantowns, ours has continued its organic evolution relatively undisrupted. This uniqueness has infused our Japantown with its own spirit, and I believe that the retention of that spirit within the community will be an essential ingredient to the survival of our Japantown.\n\nCurt: San Jose Japantown has evolved throughout its over 130 years in existence. Businesses and people come and go. The community has gone through cycles of growth and decline several times. Throughout the changes, the neighborhood has remained vital and of service to the residents. The Asian cultures have been the dominant communities in this area with the Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos being the majority during the first century.\n\nWith the influx of people during the 1990s and 2000s, the demographics have changed and Japantown is more of a Pan-Asian community. With even more people moving into the huge development on the former Heinlenville property, it’s anyone’s guess as to how the neighborhood will evolve and grow. But change is necessary if a community isn’t going to stagnate and wither away.\n\nQ. Anything else you’d like to add?\n\nRalph: I would just like to thank JAMsj and the generosity of Jim Nagareda’s aunt, Mie Barbara Nagareda, for reprinting our book. It’s the team’s hope that anyone interested has access to a copy. We’re also very grateful for the exceptional efforts of our designer/producer Janice Oda, who has played an instrumental role in this second printing.\n\nCurt: In addition to what Ralph wrote, I would like to also thank Jim Nagareda, who oversaw both the first and second versions of the book. Jim was the essential connection to the Japantown community and handled all the issues and affairs to make the book a reality.\n\nDon’t miss your chance to get this valuable historic book. Pre-order your copy by July 4 for Early Bird pricing!\n\nBy Michelle Yakura\n\nIt has been a dream to have information available in multiple languages, but then the signs would become bigger than the exhibits! We had talked about reducing the signage by using QR Codes to add more content, so I did a web search on QR code translation, and BINGO! The company QR Translator appeared in the search. As I went through their website, I realized they had the perfect solution for us. I sent them an inquiry, and someone from their marketing team got back to me. They are a Tokyo-based company, and we had several video conference calls. I told them what we were trying to do. Their team was extremely responsive and that is how we got to where we are today!\n\nMichael, QR Translator is new to the U.S. market. Please tell us about the company.\n\nI recommend visiting their website (https://en.qrtranslator.com/). QR Translator is a web service developed by PIJIN Co., Ltd in Tokyo, Japan. They started in 2011 as a startup company so they have a decade of experience in the field. Their mission is to give access to information and eliminate language barriers, or as they say on their website, “to free the world from language barriers with the power of Web Technology.”\n\nMichael, tell us about the volunteers who have been working on this project and what they have been doing.\n\nIt’s been great working with this team of talented volunteers. Board member Chip Hayashi and I have just been managing the project and keeping the group on track.\n\nThe real work was done by both new and old volunteers:\n\nEvan Schieber has been the main editor for the project, correcting the English and helping us develop some prototypes.\n\nSachiko Blume has been the Japanese translator and the Photoshop specialist for the project. Sachiko makes the Japanese machine translation native!\n\nMomo Cha supported us on the placard design, making sure the text is readable and the QR Translator and placards are all uniform, and she introduced us to Peter Inshaw, the president of Plotter Pros, which has produced the placards.\n\nAudrey Takeshita helped us on the placard design and shared the task with Momo.\n\nLisa Van Dyke supported us with the graphic design for the “How to use QR Translator” signage.\n\nVolunteers, what have you learned from your participation in this project that enables the JAMsj’s story to be shared with a wider audience?\n\nEvan Schieber, a JAMSj volunteer since March 2020, is finishing his first year in college and planning on majoring in political science and minoring in urban studies. Evan was impressed with the ingenuity of the Japanese farmers in the early 1900s.\n\n“Proofreading all of the placards gave me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the content in the agriculture section of the museum, as I've focused on the incarceration and old Japantown. For example, Mr. Sakauye was ingenious in finding ways to make the entire farming process quicker, whether that be in how broccoli was tied together with the broccoli buncher, or even in speeding up the construction of crates with his crate making jig.”\n\nSachiko Blume, a JAMsj volunteer for over 5 years, learned about some of the new projects at the museum when she attended the 2021 volunteer thank you brunch last September. She approached Michael about including more information for Japanese speakers. Growing up in Japan, she knew very little about the experience of Japanese Americans and had started volunteering at JAMsj in order to connect with Japanese Americans in the community.\n\n“If we included Japanese translations on the new placards, it would be very beneficial for Japanese visitors to fully understand and appreciate the exhibits. As I uploaded the English placards’ information onto the QR translation website one by one, I learned more about the history of Japanese Americans in detail. I learned how hard they worked and how creative they were!”\n\nAudrey Takeshita, a new volunteer, is an illustrator/visual designer who connected to JAMsj while visiting San Jose, her husband’s hometown. Audrey was keen to get involved with sharing the JAMsj story.\n\n“I recall seeing the old photos and reading the stories, which became familiar and haunting at the same time. (It’s so important for) future generations to understand, respect, and honor what our grandparents and similar families went through. And yes, I learned the names of the farming tools and how they were used.”\n\nMichael, the project is being implemented in phases. The agricultural area is first. What's next?\n\nIn addition to the outdoor agricultural exhibit area, the project aims to provide QR Translation labels in the main gallery. We plan to also incorporate QR Translator's multilingual QR codes.on placards on the landmarks and monuments in San Jose’s Japantown.\n\nThank you to all the volunteers who participated in this project and to the team at QR Translator in Tokyo!\n\nBy Lynda Gomi\n\nInterested in writing for the JAMsj blog? Contact PublicPrograms@jamsj.org\n\nJAMsj Board of Directors is pleased to announce the appointment of a new Executive Director, Taline Ayanyan Mitten, by unanimous vote. Ms. Mitten will bring her years of experience as a strategic and leader-through-service executive to JAMsj. Her background in non-profit and heritage preservation will help the museum meet its dynamic strategic goals and advance its mission to share Japanese American history and culture and promote cross-cultural understanding. She will also support the museum’s initiative to provide a historical forum that stimulates present-day discussions on civil liberties, race relations, discrimination, and the American identity.\n\n”We are excited to have Taline join JAMsj as the new Executive Director,” said Michael Sera, JAMsj Board President. “Her operational skills and background in architecture will help us as we restore the Kawakami House and tackle future expansion projects,” he added.\n\nAs the Chief Operating Officer of Mar Structural Design in Berkeley, Ms. Mitten helped open the mission-driven firm in 2014 and oversaw its financial, marketing, and other operational departments, contributing to its sustainable growth and its positioning at the forefront of sustainable and seismically resilient structural design.\n\nPrior to that, Ms. Mitten developed expertise in heritage preservation through heritage documentation consulting at CyArk, an Oakland non-profit dedicated to \"digitally recording, archiving, and sharing the world's most significant cultural heritage.”\n\nDuring her role at CyArk, Ms. Mitten worked on the digital recording of three Japanese American Confinement Sites: Manzanar and Tule Lake in California, and Topaz in Utah. “It was an unforgettable experience meeting and interviewing Jimi Yamaichi, one of the founders of JAMsj,” recalls Ms. Miten. “Experiencing the rich and welcoming experience created by him and seeing the immense contributions of the JAMsj board, staff, countless volunteers, and community partners at that time was what led me to want to become part of the museum,” Ms. Mitten said.\n\nMs. Mitten also reflected on the personal significance of this new chapter with the museum.\n\nMs. Mitten’s passion for cultural preservation began after she immigrated to the Bay Area from Syria in the 1990s with her mother and siblings. “JAMsj is a unique and precious resource in the San Francisco Bay Area, and its mission is of personal importance to me, not only as an immigrant but also as a third-generation descendant of Western Armenians who were violently forced to flee to Syria and other parts of the world during World War I, leaving their homes and businesses behind. It is, therefore, an honor for me to serve the JAMsj team as Executive Director, and to curate the conditions for the museum to continue to flourish, grow, and engage the community in new ways.”\n\nMs. Mitten holds a Master of Science in Conservation of Monuments and Sites from the Raymond Lemaire International Center for Conservation at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, and a Bachelor of Architecture from the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.\n\nQ. Please tell us about yourself.\n\nMy name is Raymond Kawakami and I'm the youngest son of George Kawakami. I was born in November 1956 when my parents lived in San Francisco on Pine Street. In 1962 we moved to Mountain View where I grew up, went to school, and then attended De Anza and Foothill Colleges. I've lived in the Bay Area all my life.\n\nIn my work career, I had positions at NASA Ames, Fairchild Semiconductor, Synertek, AMD, Vitelic, and Samsung. My expertise is in scientific programming, and I programmed computers to test semiconductor chips. I have been retired since 2019, and I now live in San Jose with my wife and one of my two daughters.\n\nQ. Did you ever live in the Kawakami House?\n\nI never actually lived in Aunt Elsie's house, what is now referred to as the Kawakami House. My father’s sister Aunt Elsie and her husband Uncle Ino (George Inouye) lived in the house, and we would visit them several times a year - the main time being at New Year's for some traditional Japanese food.\n\nQ. Can you share some memories of the Kawakami House?\n\nSome of my earliest memories about the Kawakami House were the New Year's dinners. All of the Kawakami's in the Bay Area would meet there for a potluck where everyone brought their special meal. Traditional mochi, manjū, soba was served although I myself was more of a ‘steak and potatoes’ type of person.\n\nIt was a custom for my father and his family to play poker on New Year’s Eve. They would play for several hours after dinner.\n\nAunt Elsie did not have children, but there would be three or four of us kids every year and we had fun playing games in the TV room upstairs. There was a windy creaky stairway to the second floor. There were four bedrooms upstairs, but we never slept overnight. We lived close by.\n\nI remember that we never used the front door going into the house. Instead, we entered from the side door into the kitchen. But then when we leave, we always went out from the front door. I don’t remember why. But I do remember picking up our jackets from the closet under the stairway and then stepping down to the walkway surrounded by bushes saying goodbyes.\n\nQ. Can you please share some stories about your parents, grandparents, and family?\n\nI was very young when my grandfather Kohachi passed away in 1959. I vaguely remember attending a funeral at the Buddhist Church on Fifth Street just a block from the house, but I can't be sure if that's the time.\n\nThe only grandparent I was close to was my mother's mother Kiyo Miyagi who lived with us in Mountain View. She did not speak any English and I didn't speak any Japanese but we still somehow managed to communicate. In our house, my father and mother did not try to teach us Japanese so what little I did pick up was when they spoke to my grandmother. I never learned the language, but my older brother did when he went into the Navy and was stationed in Japan.\n\nMy father never talked about how his father managed to purchase the house or what it was like during the war. I never asked. My father was a quiet guy with a dry sense of humor. He was a hard worker. He worked for a wholesale florist delivering flowers in a pickup truck.\n\nMy father was also a good bowler. He used to travel around the U.S. competing in the Nisei Bowling League and he had many trophies.\n\nAunt Elsie passed away in 1995. My father sold the house sometime after that. He passed away in 2011.\n\nSydney is a Junior Visual Designer at Cisco Systems, Inc. and volunteers on the marketing team at JAMsj as a graphic designer.\n\nThe Queen Program aims to “develop young women of Japanese descent to become future community leaders who will preserve and continue traditions and bring forth new ideas” according to the program’s mission statement. It is one of the highlights of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival in San Francisco.\n\nOn program night, Sydney and the court showcased everything they had been learning, practicing, and preparing since December of last year. The opening number was a traditional Japanese odori (dance), which came together beautifully despite the fact that they had to learn the dance through Zoom meetings.\n\nThey then each made a speech for the Japanese American community. In her speech, Sydney talked about how at first she did not feel “Japanese enough” but how she appreciated her family and became to want to be an advocate for Japantown. She also acknowledged the strength of our community and emphasized that every single person matters.\n\nThe JAMsj blog asked her how she feels and here is her answer.\n\n“This title is such an honor to have, and I honestly could not have done it without the help from my family, the museum, and each of the girls on the court. I am honored and excited to be able to represent the community, but even happier to represent the museum. I hope that people really turn to me as not just a leader, but a friend. I want to be an advocate for the community, but also an active member in it! I hope to continue to do so through the museum.”\n\nQ. Please tell us a little about yourself.\n\nA. I'm originally from the Hawaii town of Wailuku in Maui and I came to California when I was 17 years old. I went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where I majored in architecture, with a minor in construction management. My career has moved me all around California, starting in Southern California where I worked for an architect that did educational work, building schools, and school district offices. Then I worked for a general contractor as a field engineer to learn how a project is built and worked on restoring the historical US Grant Hotel in downtown San Diego. Then I worked on building envelope and restoration projects in the Bay Area where our team was hired by homeowners and Architects to fix problems in a building or to prevent something from going wrong as they were being built. That was really fun.\n\nNext, I wanted to expand my skillset and learn what it takes to represent the owner. So, I became the Senior Architect at the Mineta San Jose International Airport. I worked there for 7 years and the last project I worked on was designing and building the new Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) facility. It's a fire station dedicated to airport emergency operations. The facility at the Mineta San Jose International Airport was originally built in the 1960s and it was falling apart. It's been three years in the making and is just about to officially open. Every time I talk to the firefighters they are glowing and I can tell that they love the new facility.\n\nQ. It sounds like you have a lot of experience in restoration and that you have the perfect background to lead the Kawakami House Project. How did you become involved with JAMsj?\n\nA.It was around 2013 when I was representing the airport. There were a lot of events that involved Norman Mineta and as I was getting notified of these events. I felt that the Japanese American community should be present when Norm comes back home. So, I called Michael (Sera, JAMsj President) and told him that I'd like to get more of the community involved. Michael brought in the representatives from the community and that’s how I got to know him.\n\nI started volunteering at the board meetings and listened to get a feel of who we're working with and what we represent. I had a good job at the airport, but it lacked that sense of community. Beyond doing my job here in San Jose, I didn't feel like I was part of San Jose. I felt like I just lived here – almost like a visitor. Something was missing. And so, when Michael asked me to do this, I felt like I'm making a difference. I can use my skill set to help an organization with a vision greater than myself.\n\nAnd then Michael introduced me to the Kawakami House project and asked me how we could get it started.\n\nQ. And how did you embark on this project?\n\nA. First, we did a lot of research and investigation on the background of the house. Historical Reports, thesis’, and interviewing past volunteers/board members were intricate in getting the home’s story. What we found is this home represents the struggles and tenacity of the Japanese Americans as their family members were incarcerated at Heart Mountain Wyoming War Relocation Authority, represented in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and became naturalized citizens after years of living in the United States.\n\nWe then interviewed the Kawakami Family, the son, and niece of George Kawakami. George was the first son to be born in the United States and had US citizenship. His father, Kohachi, bought the house in George’s name when he was one year old. At the time, Alien Land Laws prevented non-citizens from owning property. This presented the only way to gain property rights at the time. The son, Raymond Kawakami, sent me this naturalization certificate of Kohachi Kawakami, and this was what hit me right in the heart. Just a few years before he passed away, he was granted citizenship. So, the very thing that prevented him from buying the house, he was finally given before the end of his life. Unfortunately, his wife passed away before that, so she couldn't see that.\n\nWe have a pretty good handle of what that house used to be and what it represented. And now that it's in the possession of JAMsj, we needed to figure out what we want to do with it. We asked everybody to get together and had a brainstorming session with the volunteers, the Board, and Advisory Board. What kind of functions? What kind of spaces do you want to see? How do you want to use it?\n\nAnd what we came up with was that everybody wanted to call it a “storytelling space” where people could tell their immigration story, whether it's Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean – the whole spectrum of the Asian American experience.\n\nAnd then there's another thought that we wanted to get to and that was to serve as a community hub. There are some community groups that don't have a meeting space. We could provide that opportunity for them to use it for their meetings. And then lastly, we have to keep operating as a museum and we have expenses. So, what if this could be used for corporate retreats and then we can generate revenue from it, so we can support the actual museum and have a mixture of experiences.\n\nSo those are the three purposes that we are looking into, and we are going to move forward with that in the rehabilitation design. Not only do we need to rehabilitate the exterior, but there's a lot of work to be done in the interior. Data systems, mechanical, electrical systems, plumbing systems – they all have to be upgraded. Once we have all the infrastructure upgrades, then we know that it can support all those different functions we talked about.\n\nQ. So where are we at now?\n\nA. So, it's in a very early stage, but amazingly, we've had some very generous donations within the past few months. We had a $100,000 donation towards the house and then another donor gave us $350,000 that we can use for this project. This allows us to start the actual design. We hope to get that started in April, and then we'll probably finish towards the end of 2022.\n\nThe next step would be to start a capital campaign program, which will be led by our fund development managers. It's a big endeavor, but you have to start with a big vision. The good news is that the initial donations will help us show what we are trying to do and that will help with raising more money. We can show them the rendering and drawings which I think will spark interest.\n\nQ. Can you tell us about your new job?\n\nA. At the end of January, I started as a Commodity Manager for Apple Real Estate and Development. My job responsibilities will involve the design, fabrication, and procurement of specific building finishes for Apple Stores worldwide. I’m excited to embark on this new opportunity.\n\nBy Norri Kageki\n\nYou can read a previous article on the Kawakami House Project at the following link.\n\nKawakami House Project - A New Beginning"
