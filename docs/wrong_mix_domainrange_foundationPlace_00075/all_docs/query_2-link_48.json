But as battery-driven mobile devices have replaced PCs as the volume platform for SoCs, power has moved up to the top of the list, followed by cost and performance. Performance is still critical in certain markets, such as servers, but even there more accountability for server power and cooling has made it imperative to reduce power.\n\nWith the Internet of Things market, companies are beginning to think of a fourth element to go with PPA, namely security. While PPA (power, performance and area) are well defined in watts, hertz, and nanometers, it is more complicated to quantitatively define security."
