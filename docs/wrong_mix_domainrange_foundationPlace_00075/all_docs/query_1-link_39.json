These partnerships with Andrew Carnegie and Henry Flagler helped construct Stetson's physical landscape and the buildings they financed still stand and are used today. Andrew Carnegie built Sampson Hall, which began life as the Sampson Library. Henry Flagler financed and designed Flagler Hall, which was then known as the Science Hall. The stories of Stetson's partnerships with both Carnegie and Flagler and the stories of the men themselves provide a fascinating insight into Stetson University and Volusia County in the early 1900s.\n\nServing and Growing Through VITA\n\nTrack: Building Community\n\nPresenters: Bonnie Holloway\n\nDo you want to grow as a person and as a professional?

We will accomplish this by learning about profound stories in early and medieval Islam as well as how this tradition continues in today's Muslim superheroes such as Ms. Marvel.

Participants will learn about the sources of political values and potential biases among themselves and others. After a brief period of lecture presenting empirical research, participants will have the chance to practice suggested techniques for holding a politically fueled conversation with empathy and productivity. While the subject of political issues can induce strong reactions, this workshop is meant to provide a safe space to those who wish to explore their own values and connect with others who may have differing political values.\n\nNaikan: Gratitude as a Method of Self-Discovery\n\nTrack: Contemplative Practices\n\nPresenters: Morris Sullivan\n\nNaikan is a Japanese method of self-reflection that, while still relatively unknown in the West, is highly transformative. Unlike meditation, it doesn't involve sitting quietly with one's eyes closed; however, Naikan gives the practitioner a direct view into their relationship to the world in which they live and their relationships with others through the application of gratitude, grace, and self-reflection.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Extended Metaphor in Contemplative Reflection\n\nTrack: Contemplative Practices\n\nPresenters: Michele Randall, Tya Saunders\n\nContemplative writing has been described as circling back at something, like a bird, over and over, to explore it from every angle. Sometimes, even when we want to write about something, we find we can't. Sometimes we're just stuck. How do we move forward? When approaching a topic that is difficult or an issue the writer doesn't want to name on the page, creating extended metaphors can be highly effective. We will look at a few examples from literature and then put our knowledge into practice. You will leave with a few beginnings or drafts and prompts to take home.\n\nArguing Both Sides Equally Well: Ethical Sophism in the Classroom\n\nTrack: Tools and Techniques for Dialogue\n\nPresenters: Michael Barnes\n\nThe sophist Protagoras taught students to \"argue both sides equally well,\" a practice that Socrates criticized as making the lesser argument appear stronger. Socrates' criticism stuck, and we have since viewed sophism as synonymous with lying. This writing workshop will consider whether an ethical approach to the practice of sophism is possible in the classroom.\n\nOpen Forum: Drafting Stetson's Statement on the Principles of Free Expression\n\nTrack: Tools and Techniques for Dialogue\n\nPresenters: Sven Smith, Kevin Winchell\n\nDocuments: Stetson's Statement on the Principles of Free Expression\n\nMake your voice heard! The principle of free expression is at the heart of many of the most contested and challenging issues facing our society today. University campuses, by virtue of their academic and civic missions, have a responsibility to safeguard and promote the often difficult and necessary discourse. We should aim to build our capacity for intellectual honesty and effective decision-making.\n\nLast year, a committee of faculty and staff produced Stetson's Statement on the Principles of Free Expression, a document that aims to articulate Stetson's position on the topic. This document is based on extensive research drawn from similar statements and policies elsewhere and has already been reviewed by many campus constituencies. Nonetheless, we are creating this forum for our entire campus community to learn about the work of the committee, process through some case studies regarding speech on campuses, and possibly provide some additional feedback before submitting the final draft to the President and Trustees.\n\nValues, Identities, and Stories: Promoting Healing, Understanding, and Justice\n\nTrack: Storytelling\n\nPresenters: Rajni Shankar-Brown\n\nIn this interactive session, storytelling will be examined and engaged as a vehicle for healing, understanding, and promoting justice. Shankar-Brown will highlight connections between values and identities, and speak on the power of stories across disciplines. Examples of how storytelling can build community and diminish injustice in a world full of disparities will be shared. This workshop will weave together insights and narrative research, as well as discuss social inequalities in global, national, and local contexts. Participants will have opportunities to explore values, learn about intersectionality, and participate in individual and collective storytelling activities using diverse formats from reflective poetry to collaborative, impromptu oral expression.\n\nBeyond Significance: What Happened in Africa\n\nTrack: Contemplative Practices\n\nPresenters: William Andrews, Nicholas (Cole) Reeves\n\nFresh back from their Stetson-sponsored service-learning trip to Malawi (Africa), student Cole Reeves and professor William Andrews will lead a discussion that challenges us to expand our notions of both \"significance\" and \"community\". To whom does my significance matter? How does it matter? Is it conferred by others or does it spring from within? Do different cultures view significance and community differently? Along the way, they will share stories and videos of local heroes, people they met, tales they heard, culinary surprises, wild elephants, and roadway adventures.\n\nStudy and Intern Abroad with IES Abroad\n\nTrack: Community Building\n\nPresenters: IES Abroad – Robin Pipkin\n\nJoin Robin Pipkin from IES Abroad to learn all about the various study and intern abroad programs offered by IES Abroad.

This past summer, Stetson students and staff had the opportunity to engage in a week-long trip where they heard first-hand stories from the individuals who made the Civil Rights Movement a success.

Here at Stetson University, the Honor System Council is dedicated to upholding academic integrity on campus to ensure the value of a Stetson degree only continues to rise. This presentation will teach its participants about the importance of academic integrity and honesty.\n\nHeart-to-Heart: Practices to Build Spiritual Community\n\nTrack: Building Community\n\nPresenters: Morris Sullivan, Christy Correll-Hughes, Willie Barnes\n\nWhat makes a spiritual community strong? How can interfaith dialog and diversity build a cohesive community? Can people from divergent traditions find common ground on which to lay a foundation for a strong, unified community? In this workshop, Stetson University's three chaplains‚ one Baptist, one Buddhist and one African Methodist Episcopal‚ will demonstrate how shared values and spiritual practices can make us stronger spiritually, both individually and collectively.\n\nThe Mechanics of Story-Telling: A Philosophical Perspective\n\nTrack: Storytelling\n\nPresenters: Joshua Rust\n\nNot every sequence of events is a story. Your morning's walk to the CUB was probably not narratively compelling. But sometimes it is, and you have a story to tell. What distinguishes a story from a mere sequence of events, and what does good story-telling look like? Should we aspire to turn our lives into a story? Join me for a presentation and discussion of the mechanics of story-telling from a philosophical perspective.\n\nHow Strong are your Ethics?\n\nTrack: Contemplative Practices\n\nPresenters: Frances Duvall\n\nHow strong is your moral compass? Are you aware of the ethics you practice every day without thinking about it?

This workshop will give you tips for expressing yourself online without diminishing your friend base or damaging your chances with future employers. Citing recent scholarly research and Stetson's own policies, we will navigate the treacherous world of social media with discussion and online participation (Bring your mobile device!).\n\nTragedy of the Commons\n\nTrack: Tools and Techniques for Dialogue\n\nPresenters: Alan Green, Chris de Bodisco, Khushbu Mishra, Ranjini Thaver\n\nCan you solve the tragedy of the commons?

But there is an even deeper fault line in the classroom, between professors and the best students in one cultural cluster, in contrast with all the other students. A narrow segment of students find the current educational path exciting, and they earn rewards for their skills and passions. But a silent majority of students do not share this passion. Can we broaden our education for significance to reach more students?\n\nStudy and Intern Abroad with CIEE\n\nTrack: Community Building\n\nPresenters: CIEE: Council On International Educational Exchange – Soren Christensen\n\nStudying or interning abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, come join Soren Christensen from CIEE to learn about our Affiliate programs offered all around the world.

The vast majority of anti-discrimination \"trainings\" are an hour or less in length. The premise that remedying racism/sexism/etc is less-complicated than learning CPR is a faulty one and one that has had a continuing harmful impact on students and employees for over three decades. Workplace/campus training providers brought in ~160 BILLION dollars in 2015 (in the United States alone). While these trainings have been effective at meeting the needs administrators concerned with Legal Compliance, it is much less clear that these trainings are meeting the needs of individuals who are actually most impacted by the harmful behaviors these trainings are advertised to address. Training CAN be effective, but only if stakeholders are empowered to ask the right questions beforehand.\n\nI'm Not a Refugee: I am a ...\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Elisabeth Poeter, Jelena Petrovic, Mirrett Saad\n\nThis workshop will highlight some of the most publicly debated immigration issues in the US, such as a temporary ban on refugees from Muslim countries, the securing of national borders, health care and work for refugees and undocumented immigrants, and the role of sanctuary cities.

This interactive workshop aims to debunk misconceptions concerning people with intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) as well as offering ways in which our community can build an atmosphere that is inclusive of all people, regardless of labels. Students will engage in a meaningful dialogue about the importance of truly including those with IDD in our community.\n\nNaikan: The Japanese Art of Gratitude and Self Reflection\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Morris Sullivan\n\nNaikan is a little-known method of self-reflection that doesn't involve sitting quietly with one's eyes closed but gives the practitioner a direct view into their relationship to the world they live in and people they live with through the application of gratitude, grace, and self-reflection.\n\nWeight ≠ Worth: Research-Driven Strategies for Developing a Better Body Image\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Danielle Lindner, Honor Woodward\n\nEverybody has a body, so everybody has a body image.

Students from Omicron Delta Epsilon, the economics honors society, will lead a discussion of hidden costs, trade-offs and smart decision-making on campus and in their lives.\n\nThe Propaganda Experiment\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Michael Barnes,\n\nPropaganda has an awful reputation, as it is associated with unethical manipulation; as opposed to rhetoric (the art of persuasion), propaganda often deliberately omits essential information and/or uses heightened pathos to gloss over logical deficiencies. Techniques associated with propaganda include using loaded words (i.e. name calling and/or ad hominem attacks), transfer (an illogical association between positive/negative terms), or snob appeal (linking luxury with an act or priority) (Jowett). However, the traditional definition of propaganda carries no pejorative meaning, since the strategies can be applied for either ethical or unethical goals. The term only garnered a negative connotation with its association with Nazi war posters and rallies in WWII. The Catholic Church, in fact, created the concept as a means to attract wayward followers during the reformation/counter-reformation. Given this informing context, it is understandable that propaganda is being reconsidered by pedagogues as a legitimate and ethical means to achieve positive civic action. Advertisements aggressively dissuaded smokers from smoking and the iconic Uncle Sam posters are notable examples.\n\nIn this interactive workshop, participants engage in a student exercise from my ENGL 141 class, one that explores whether propaganda can be taught ethically. In general, the exercise foregrounds interdisciplinary writing, undergraduate research, civic engagement and ethics.\n\nFind Your Voice: Prep for Class Presentations\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Haley Gaynor, Mitzi Dykes\n\nDo you have Glossophobia?!?! Over 75% of people have this fear; some even fear this more than death. The symptoms include a rapid heartbeat, severe sweating, shaking, and dry mouth. Sound familiar? Glossophobia is the fear of public speaking. Whether you're a first-year student or a senior, the probability are that you still get anxious with class presentations. In this workshop, we will work together to help you conquer this fear and improve your public speaking skills. If you want to quiet those butterflies when you present or want to refine your already strong speaking skills, this is the workshop for you.\n\nAcademic Integrity, Stetson's Core Values and Life Beyond\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Cynthia Bennington, The Honor System Council, led by President Kathryn Renae Metcalf\n\nNot sure about unauthorized group collaboration? Witness a mock hearing for alleged unauthorized group collaboration and BE a member of the Council. As a council member, in addition to determining whether or not a violation of the Honor Code occurred, you will determine sanctions should a violation have occurred. Discuss how academic dishonesty can be avoided. Reflect on what academic integrity means to Stetson and your future.\n\nIt's About Service: Alternative Break Opportunities at Stetson University\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Clare Sullivan, David Bailey, Nicolette Alayon, Chloe Foster, Sydney Arrington, Courtney Converse, Cathryn Sandborn\n\nA distant destination, a close-knit group of friends, a welcoming non-profit. These are all factors for an Alternative Break trip that students have the opportunity to participate in every year. Come to this workshop to learn about global citizenship opportunities through Alternative Breaks.\n\nExamining Poverty and Homelessness in the Context of Values: A Call to Action\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Rajni Shankar-Brown,\n\nFamilies with children are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population in the United States, and particularly in the state of Florida. Economic well-being of children in the Sunshine State is consistently ranked as one of the lowest. Additionally, Florida continues to be identified as one of the most dangerous states for the homeless, with hate crimes increasing at alarming rates. Growing economic inequality in the U.S. requires communities to reflect on values and mindfully address multilayered issues, including dismantling systemic oppression. This interactive session will explore the complex dynamics of socioeconomic inequality within the context of values and highlight the myriad effects of homelessness on children and youth – putting forth a call to action to collectively rethink how we address poverty, to mobilize, and to mindfully advance equity and justice.\n\nInternational Internships: How to Build your Resume Abroad\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Amy Barber, Paula Hentz and Student Panel\n\nEvery year, Stetson University students pursue challenging and exciting internships overseas. They work in Parisian fashion houses, learn more about Chinese business culture, and intern with environmental sustainability programs in Australia, all while increasing their cultural communication skills. Join us for a panel discussion with Stetson students to hear about these experiences directly from the source. Students will share their own experiences, from choosing an opportunity to financing their time abroad. Attendees will gain a better understanding of Stetson's various options, whether for themselves or for their students.\n\nMeditation 101: How Scheduled Stillness Can Improve your GPA\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Kait Forsythe\n\nMeditation is the process by which we withdraw our attention from the outer world and concentrate it inwards. Physicians, psychologists, and various health professionals recommend meditation as a tool to manage the things that get in the way: stress, anxiety, depression, physical illness and more. Do you ever find when you go to work on an assignment, your mind is tempted by distractions? In this Jyoti meditation workshop, we will learn how to be still and narrow our focus despite our mind's resistance.\n\nIf we can cultivate a regular meditation practice, we will find ourselves operating from a place of calm clarity that will feed all areas of our lives: work, relationships, home, and especially school.\n\nBeyond You\n\nValue: Global Citizenship and Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): James Hilton, John Sellers\n\nEvery day we look around our world and communities to see injustice, pain, and oppression. There is a desire within us to take a stand and live a life that makes a difference in the world. But what gives you the ability to make a real impact and to bring needed change? How do you identify what it is that drives you past simply desiring for things to be better and moves you into a lifetime of influence? It starts with living for something beyond yourself.\n\nWhat's In A Word?—Defining Diversity and Creating Inclusivity\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Shawnrece Campbell, Drew Macan, Maria Francis, Elisabeth Poeter, Daniel Barber, Alyssa Morley, Luisa De Guzman, Jason Myree\n\nCreating a culture of inclusivity begins on an individual basis. It is erroneous to think that you don't need to contribute to inclusivity on an individual basis until you feel included. Rather the model of doing more to include individuals who are characteristically diverse from ourselves in our various cultural spheres should be adopted. If we all do more to include our neighbors, pretty soon we will feel included too.\n\nIslam and You\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Eman Abd EL Halim, Eman El Sayed El Taher\n\nIslam is oppressive, right? Wrong! Do feminists wear Hijab? Yes! In the workshop, “Islam and You”, we will discuss women's role in Islam, their contributions, as well as the misconceptions about women in Islam. In addition to this, participants will learn basic Islam principles, discover new sides to Islam, and understand how Islam integrates with other religions and thoughts to maintain a peaceful world. At the end, participants will gain new and surprising insight about the Prophet Muhammad; ”Peace Be Upon Him”.\n\nKeynote Address - Rev. Vincent A. Pizzuto, PhD\n\nAn East Coast native, The Rev. Vincent Pizzuto, PhD, attained his undergraduate degree in English literature and theology at St. Bonaventure University in upstate New York, and his first master's degree in religious education from Boston College. For several years he served as a campus minister and interfaith counselor at the Newman Center at the University of Wisconsin—Madison, and in 1997 moved to Belgium to attend the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, where he received his second master's degree and a PhD in New Testament exegesis in 2003.\n\nLater that year Pizzuto relocated to San Francisco to take up his full-time appointment as a professor of New Testament studies in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of San Francisco. Drawing upon his life-long commitment to Christian contemplative practice, early in his career Pizzuto received a number of grants to fund the development of a series of courses in contemplative practice at USF, which have as their cornerstone the integration of meditation within the classroom environment. Building upon the success of these courses, his most recent curricular developments at USF include the introduction of a cross-disciplinary minor in Christian spirituality and contemplative practice which is expected to launch officially in spring 2015.\n\nPizzuto has presented nationally and internationally on issues of inter-religious dialog and contemplative practice. His ongoing attentiveness to a theology that remains grounded in the needs of both church and society sustains his commitment to regularly offer lectures, workshops, and retreats on biblical spirituality and contemplative prayer, and the intersection of both of these with the most pressing spiritual questions of the day.\n\nAmong his current publications is his first book entitled, A Cosmic Leap of Faith: An Authorial, Structural and Theological Investigation of the Cosmic Christology in Col 1:15-20: Contributions To Exegesis and Theology, 41 (Peeters: Leuven, 2006), as well as a number of scholarly essays, the most recent of which include, \"The Deus Absconditus of Scripture: An Apophatic Hermeneutic for Christian Contemplatives,\" BTB 44:2 (spring 2014) 100-08; \"The Structural Elegance of Matthew 1-2: A Chiastic Proposal,\" Catholic Biblical Quarterly (October 2012), 712-37; and \"An Ecological Hermeneutic of Col 1:15-20: A Panentheistic Proposal,\" in Confronting the Climate Crisis: Catholic Theological Perspective, Jame Schaefer, ed., (Marquette: University Press, 2011), 75-97.\n\nOrdained to the priesthood in July 2006, Pizzuto founded and ministers in the Bay Area to a contemplative Christian community, New Skellig, whose liturgy and practices are informed by the history and spiritual patrimony of the Celtic Christian Church. He and his community will be formally received into the Episcopal Church later this year.\n\nPizzuto lives in a small mountain town in Marin County, just north of San Francisco, which he has come to think of as his personal spiritual 'retreat.'\n\nWhat if we measured our spiritual maturity not by the certainty of our answers but by the deepening authenticity of our questions? What if we committed to a spiritual practice that did not so much look to religion to provide answers, but rather to provide a framework for asking the right questions? In other words, what if we risked living more deeply with Mystery itself. If the answers promulgated by our religious and philosophical traditions tend to divide us, a contemplative turn 'inward' readily reveals that our questions, in fact, unite us. People of vastly different times and cultures have grappled with many of the same existential questions, universally about meaning, identity, purpose and destiny. In a diverse and multicultural society, how might the particularities of our own religious and philosophical commitments point to a deeper realization of union with others and with all of Reality?\n\nTo explore some of these questions, we will first look at the intersection between religion and spirituality, which is becoming an increasingly pressing tension among college students today. Contemplative practices, broadly defined, are intended to foster an interior landscape in which one is able to look deeply (some would say, prayerfully) within one's self in order to transcend self-imposed limitations that are based largely on false perceptions and attachments. Often times these practices known variously as prayer, meditation, or contemplation are framed and rooted in a particular faith tradition which helps to ground the practice in a broader communal, liturgical, and moral life. Others have sought more individual spiritual paths quite apart from any formal religious tradition. This raises the question of the complex relationship between 'religion' and 'spirituality,' or more broadly, the interplay between community and solitude in the support of one's contemplative or meditative practice.\n\nRather than engage questions of religious 'truth' or 'doctrinal' teaching we will explore the meaning of beauty, the necessity of awe, the inevitability of wonder. It is beauty that attracts, not the dry rigid formulas of dogma. It is awe that moves our hearts to love, not the ethical demand that we do so as a religious obligation. And it is wonder that leads us on to meet the ever-receding horizon of our insatiable curiosity. The contemplative life then, is not about introducing yet another 'thing' that we must do, it is about discovering rather how to 'be.' How to be alive and fully awake to beauty, awe, and wonder. It is from this interior awakening that we can begin to foster genuine spiritual lives and authentic religious commitments.\n\nNotable Events\n\nService Project Orientation and Breakfast\n\nTobacco-Free Campus Dedication\n\nOn August 1, 2014, Stetson University marked a new day in its history by becoming a smoke- and tobacco-free campus. In support of this historical moment, the Tobacco Free Task Force, in conjunction with the Values Commitment Steering Team will dedicate Values Day 2014 as \"Smoke and Tobacco Free Dedication Day.\" We'll also honor our very own faculty member, T. Wayne Bailey, PhD, for his accomplishments with the tobacco-free movement in Volusia County. Following brief remarks from Professor Bailey, there will be a ribbon-cutting on Stetson Green. Please join us as we celebrate a triumphant \"Breathe Free Stetson\" day\n\nHealing Art Workshop - Hand Art Center\n\nArtists Marguerite Perret and Bruce Scherting, co-creators of \"The Waiting Room,\" will work with students at hands-on activity stations to create therapeutic works of art relating to breast cancer, dementia, anorexia, depression and domestic abuse.\n\nHand Art Center Exhibit\n\nThe Waiting Room: Lost and Found visually expresses the experience of illness - breast cancer, dementia, anorexia, depression, domestic abuse - and through hands-on activity stations constitutes therapeutic creativity for patient and artists. The Waiting Room explores the psychologically rich conceptual framework of the medical waiting room. This is the place where patients are processed before testing, diagnosis, consultation or treatment begins. Evoking this environment are a series of distinct tableau's on breast cancer, dementia, anorexia, depression and domestic abuse. The focal point of each is a hybridized chair composed of found and sculptural elements; \"lost\" and/or \"found\" items specifically designed, ambiguously functioning clothing are traces if inhabitants past and future. Visitors may sit adjacent to each sculptural chair on an unaltered chair, where they listen to recorded interview excerpts and sound compositions of intimate and expanded perspectives, or multiple \"voices\" for each health issue. In this position, viewers are made participants in the waiting community.\n\nParticipating artists: Marguerite Perret , Bruce Scherting, Stephanie Lanter, Robin Lasser\n\nFlorida Modern-Day Slavery Museum\n\nThe Florida Modern-Day Slavery Museum consists of cargo truck outfitted as a replica of the trucks involved in a recent slavery operation (U.S. v. Navarrete, 2008), accompanied by displays on the history of evolution of slavery in Florida\n\nHunger Banquet\n\nCome experience this unique tradition! The Center for Community Engagement, along with the Student Coalition to End Homelessness, Habitat for Humanity, and Oxfam, have partnered together to host the 6th Annual Stetson Hunger Banquet. The objective of this event is to raise awareness of local and world hunger. The Banquet will include an overview of what our world faces, a meal for attendees and options on how they can be involved in efforts related to hunger prevention.\n\nDiscussion with the Co-Creators of \"The Waiting Room\"\n\nArtists Marguerite Perret and Bruce Scherting discuss \"The Waiting Room\" exhibit currently in the Hand Art Center. This exhibit explores the psychologically rich conceptual framework of the medical waiting room. All are welcome to attend.\n\nContemplative Practice\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Rev. Vincent Pizzuto\n\nContemplative practice is one of the most counter-cultural activities in which we can engage today because it requires that we do nothing at all (or better, 'no-thing'). We practice simply 'being' rather than merely 'thinking' or 'doing.' What happens when we put aside all of the 'scaffolding' which sustains our identity in the world? What happens when we begin to pay attention to thoughts, feelings, social and religious identifications? What—or better who—do we encounter when we allow ourselves to be silent? Indeed, the only way to discover the depths of contemplation is through practice, and thus, the focus of our break-out session will be to introduce simple contemplative practices common to virtually all religions and philosophical traditions.\n\nGender and Film\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Elisabeth Poeter, PhD, Mary Pollock, PhD, Susanne Eules, PhD, and Alexandra Rasdal\n\nFaculty and students in the gender studies program will engage in a discussion about gender constructions in domestic and international films, women's filmmaking, the gendered camera and the potential power of the visual media in representing and undermining gender norms. A selection of film clips will help to guide the discussion and introduce participants to the variety of themes and film genres related to gender and its intersections with race, sexuality and other defining social identities.\n\nThe Colors of Stetson: A Documentary Film, Followed by a Discussion of Race/Ethnicity on Campus\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Grady Ballenger, PhD, Rajni Shankar-Brown, PhD, and Alexandrina Andre '14\n\nAfter viewing this documentary by Alexandrina Andre '14, Professors Shankar-Brown and Ballenger will moderate a discussion about issues of race and ethnicity on campus. Does the testimony of students in the film speak to workshop participants as they think about their experiences on campus and in DeLand? How different is the Stetson experience for students of color? How clearly do Stetson students and faculty understand \"whiteness\" and its privileges? How should issues of race and ethnicity be handled in the classroom or in personal relations? What steps could we take as individuals to build a culture of inclusion? What steps could we take as departments and as an institution to strengthen diversity in our campus culture and in our academic programs? Alexandrina, who is now enrolled in the film production program at Florida State University, will share a director's statement about her documentary. If possible, she will also join the discussion by Skype. This topic arguably addresses all three of the university's core values, but it centers on the intellectual and lived experience of students identifying across the racial/ethnic spectrum. Please join us for an engaging discussion and an opportunity for reflection based on \"The Colors of Stetson\"—a powerful documentary capturing the voices of Hatters and directed by a Stetson University alum.\n\nThe Legacies of the First World War 100 Years Later: Modernity, Violence and Globalization\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Eric Kurlander, PhD, Paul Croce, PhD, Mayhill Fowler, PhD, Leander Seah, PhD\n\nFaculty members from the Department of History will discuss the legacies of the First World War one hundred years after its outbreak in August 1914. Themes will include:\n\nThe onset of 'modernity' (and post-modernity) in social, economic and cultural terms\n\nThe rise of political extremism and ethnocultural violence after 1914\n\nThe End of the (European) Empire and the emerging challenges of territoriality in a more global, multipolar world\n\nStudent Leadership Redefined\n\nStrategies to Capitalize on Your Leadership Skills and Experiences That Will Assist You in Securing Your First Job!\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Christopher Kandus-Fisher, Ed.D.\n\nWorkforce development conflicts, as it relate to post-secondary institutions' ability to adequately prepare students prior to graduation have become a topic of national conversation. College readiness is the combination of skills, knowledge, and habits of the mind that is necessary to fully participate in collegiate-level courses, and then later can be translated into one's ability to translate learned skills into workforce preparedness. According to the Association of American Colleges and Universities (2013), and a recent study that they conducted regarding employers' views of student learning in college, employers seek graduates who have broad knowledge and skills, emphasize cross-cutting outcomes, and are able to think critically, creatively solve problems and effectively communicate. Many of these skills are learned through the student's experiences with clubs and organizations. This session will allow students to realize that student leadership is not just something to add to their resume, but allow them to communicate their experiences as valuable skills for the future of the workforce.\n\nLatina/o Farmworkers of Central Florida\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Pamela Cappas-Toro, PhD and Marcos Crisanto\n\n\"The Farmworker Association of Florida was founded in 1983 in response to devastating freezes decimating the citrus crop in Central Florida and impacting farmworkers' livelihoods. The organization incorporated in 1986 and expanded statewide in 1992. F.W.A.F. now has five offices in diverse agricultural communities in Florida and organizes and outreaches to farmworkers in 15 different counties in the state. F.W.A.F.'s policy change efforts over the years have improved living and working conditions for Florida's estimated 300,000 farmworkers, and include passage of the historic Florida Right to Know Act, among other successes.\"\n\nIn this workshop, students will learn about F.W.A.F.'s long-standing mission to build power among farmworkers and rural low-income communities to respond to and gain control over social, political, workplace, economic, health and environmental issues.\n\nUniversities' Contribution to Restorative Justice in the Criminal Justice System Through Prisoner Education Programs\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Ranjini Thaver, PhD, Nicole Marinescu, Emily Lang, Taylor Duguay, Honor Baslim\n\nThe United States accounts for five percent of the world's population but accommodates 25 percent of the world's incarcerated. The multifaceted reasons behind the exponential rise in incarceration rates over time boil down to the philosophical underpinnings of the corrections system in America, namely that of retributive justice, the onset of which aligns with the 'war on drugs' and getting 'tough on crime.' In light of this retributive justice framework, resources devoted to the criminal system focus primarily on punishing 'offenders' for their crime against the state and providing minimal opportunity for them to reintegrate into society. This has contributed to increased rates of recidivism, and in turn, to an even greater burden on the criminal justice system.\n\nThis crisis in the correctional system of the U.S. has led to a body of literature on how to transform the system towards one modeled on restorative justice. The central tenet of this form of justice is that former offenders are better able to reintegrate into society as productive citizens if they are provided the opportunities to do so while incarcerated. Studies overwhelmingly find that the most important indicator of a decline in recidivism rates is prisoner education. Educational programs provide benefits beyond job skills development; they also provide ex-offenders with a network of people and social opportunities that support them in restoring their sense of humanity and moral responsibility to function well in society. In other words, education is the cornerstone to prisoner rehabilitation and the restoration of the human rights of offenders and their families and larger communities.\n\nThe objective of this workshop, led by Stetson University students who have worked with prisoners at the Tomoka Correctional Institution, is to analyze the role of universities (with special reference to Stetson University) in forging relationships with prisons and other organizations to play this vital educational role in prisons. This program is a direct response to Stetson University's values commitment.\n\nConsumption, Hungry Ghosts and Sustainability\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): James Mallett, PhD and Morris Seikyo Sullivan\n\nIn economics there exists the concept of the economic human. This being is assumed to be rational and always prefers more to less. But what if always desiring more leads to greater stress and less happiness for both the individual and society as a whole? In this workshop, we will cover Buddhist values regarding happiness, suffering and consumption. For example, in Buddhist cosmology, there is a concept on hungry ghosts. These beings have a pinhole mouth and can never quench their hunger. So in this workshop, we will explore if being aware of our consumption patterns could lead to less consumption, a happier life and a more sustainable global society.\n\nPay for Play: Does Putting Students in a Prisoner's Dilemma for Grades Effectively Teach the Concept?\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Alan Green, PhD\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma is a fundamental game theory model with wide-ranging economic, social and political applications. The basic structure is a game in which players do best on the whole when they cooperate but have strong individual incentives to defect, often resulting in poor overall outcomes. The dilemma can be experienced in the classroom by having students play a multiplayer version for grades. If they all cooperate with each other, they will all do well as a group; however, individuals can defect and raise their own grade at the expense of their classmates' grades. The activity clearly engages students and challenges them to craft means of cooperation; however, it does offer rewards to those who seek individual gains above all else. Does such an activity encourage learning through engagement, or is it unethical to lower one student's grade because a classmate played selfishly?\n\nThe World is out to get you. So prove them wrong.\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): RC Stabile and Barbara Hawkins\n\nTired of being pre-judged based on your age or experiences? Together we will discuss the preconceived notions of undergraduate-age students and the perceptions other generations have of them. We will examine why members of this generation are struggling to keep jobs and the added challenges they face. Through this presentation, we hope to share ways to stand out and fight these generational stereotypes. Come ready to engage and defend why millennials are significant to the global community.\n\nWhere Do You Buy Your Coffee? The \"Why\" Behind Stetson University Dining Services' Sustainability Initiatives\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Lindsey Bishop\n\nThis session is designed to explain the \"why\" behind Stetson University Dining Services' sustainability initiatives. From using seafood only from sustainable oceans to purchasing local food, Dining Services is committed to protecting the environment, reducing waste and decreasing our carbon foot print. These commitments are more than a strategic business practice–they honor our ethical values.\n\n#yesallwomen: Understanding and Responding to Rape Culture\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Lua Hancock, Ed.D. and Susan Peppers-Bates, PhD\n\nThis summer murders on a college campus spurred a social media phenomenon branded by #yesallwomen. This movement is one example of women giving voice to how sexism has impacted their lives. All of us are restricted and damaged by living in a world that allows systems and relationships based in misogyny. At this session, we will raise awareness as to the infiltration of sexism and sex violence and begin conversation about how we can all be part of positive change.\n\nHow Does a University Know If It's Sustainable?\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Tony Abbott, PhD\n\nSustainability has become a significant concern at universities. The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, established in 2006, has become the bellwether for sustainability assessment across the country. An administrative ethnography reveals diverse approaches to institutionalizing sustainability at six eastern schools of similar size (2,000 to 8,000 students) and operational scope (masters or liberal arts institutions):\n\nVassar College\n\nMiddlebury College\n\nAppalachian State University\n\nFurman University\n\nWarren Wilson College\n\nStetson University\n\nThe diversity of approaches underpinning sustainability at various institutions is striking. Programs include, but are not limited to:\n\nRecycling\n\nStudent research abroad\n\nEnergy production and conservation\n\nFood production and waste\n\nToxins\n\nLEED building standards\n\nNative plant policies\n\nPilgrimage as Spiritual Practice\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Phillip Lucas, PhD, Robert Sitler, PhD, and Chris Bell\n\nThis panel discusses pilgrimage as a spiritual practice across cultures. Four to five panelists will each share some of their personal pilgrimage experiences. Phillip Lucas will also give an introduction to pilgrimage as a spiritual practice and show parts of his new documentary on Buddhist pilgrimage in North India. Chris Bell and Bob Sitler will share their experiences. We will save time for questions from the audience as well.\n\nThe State of Our Values Commitments\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Robert Sitler, PhD\n\nThis session will provide a critical examination of the work of the Values Commitment Steering Team, including its successes and challenges during its first two years of operation. Ideally, the presentation will lead to thoughtful group discussion as to potential next steps and to learning from past mistakes so as to enhance our future work.\n\nInformation in the Modern World: Quality vs. Quantity\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Jason Martin, PhD\n\nDuring their long history, libraries have evolved from strictly preserving information to providing wide-ranging access to information. This has gone hand-in-hand with the \"information revolution.\" Where once only elites produced and procured information, now anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can publish their ideas online and access a plethora of information. This explosion of information is both a blessing and a curse, with greater freedom of information comes greater responsibility to assess the quality of information. This session will explore what greater access to greater amounts of information means for today's college students and an informed citizenry.\n\nExploring Your Journey: The Spiritual Life Map\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Leila Roach, PhD, Nicole Pizza and Tyler March\n\nIn this presentation, students will engage in an experiential activity that explores their spiritual journey throughout life. Students will work independently and collaboratively to construct and share their Spiritual Life Map. The Spiritual Life Map is a graphic representation of one's life using pictures and symbols. \"Much like road maps, spiritual life maps tell us where we have come from, where we are now, and where we are going\" (Hodge, 2005, p. 344). Throughout this process, students will recognize their strengths, challenges, significant figures and successful strategies they have used along the way.\n\nA Roundtable Discussion About Diversity and Inclusion at Stetson University\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Joshua Rust, PhD, Kimberly Flint-Hamilton, PhD, Patrick Coggins, PhD, ALANA-IA Caucus\n\nToday about 30 percent of the U.S. population is made up of people of color. The same is true of Stetson University students. Does Stetson University feel representative of the United States as a kind of multi-culture? And if not, why not? Please join a group of passionate faculty and staff and share your stories, observations and suggestions.\n\nOpening the Mind and Heart: Educational Technologies at Your Fingertips!\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Rajni Shankar-Brown, PhD and Brenna Burgess\n\nEducational technologies can be used to enrich learning both inside and outside of the classroom. Mobile learning tools can promote deeper learning, creativity, reflection, collaboration, and growth. Facilitated by Rajni Shankar-Brown (Associate Professor in the Department of Education) and Ms. Brenna Burgess (Stetson student majoring in Theater and minoring in Education and Sociology), this interactive workshop will include engaging discussion and applied-learning activities. Participants will have the opportunity to explore different educational technologies, including innovative apps and websites, that support intellectual development, global citizenship, and personal growth. Each participant will receive a handout with several ideas and resources. Please join us on a learning adventure that will open your mind and heart!\n\nTobacco and Stetson's Values\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Terrance Harris, Grady Ballenger\n\nThe Tobacco and Stetson's Values Workshop will provide individuals an understanding of the process, including debates and weighing of competing values that led Stetson to be a smoke and tobacco-free campus. Some of the benefits of that commitment include health of non-smokers, cessation support for students, faculty, and staff smokers; campus aesthetics, and consistency with the University's values including environmental concerns. Follow-up dialogue and questions will be offered to the audience.\n\n\"African and German? What an Interesting Mixture!\"\n\nValue: Intellectual Development\n\nPresenter(s): Elisabeth Poeter, PhD\n\nThis workshop focuses on the \"other\" Germany by moving beyond the association of the country and its culture with national socialism and the subsequent division into two separate states. We will watch a 10-minute short film on racism in reunified Germany, learn about one prominent Afro-German poet and writer, and address questions about immigration and national identity.\n\nMicrofinance in Theory and Practice\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Ranjini Thaver, PhD and Alan Green, PhD\n\nMicrofinance, made famous by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Muhammad Yunus, is a program for economic development that involves small-scale loans targeted to people who are very poor, but who have entrepreneurial ideas. In this workshop, economics professors Ranjini Thaver and Alan Green discuss microfinance in the real world and in the classroom. Thaver has worked with microfinance projects in Tanzania as well as DeLand in multiple facets; Green has modeled her methods in a classroom simulation of a poor village. In it students represent poor farmers and experience both the transformative power of even small loans alongside the myriad difficulties that arise in effective implementation and enforcement.\n\nThe Sweet Spot: Finding the Intersection of Academic Interests, Career Goals and Community Needs\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Kevin Winchell\n\nIt is important to major in something that relates to the career you want. But, what if you could enhance both your academic expertise and career opportunities while also doing good in your community?

The Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman stated that the one and only social responsibility of businesses is to increase profits for their shareholders. However, there is another perspective that believes there are larger social responsibilities than simply the financial bottom line. In this workshop, John Tichenor, PhD, will present the argument for measuring the \"triple bottom line\" that incorporates social and environmental bottom lines along with the financial bottom line.\n\nAcademic Integrity, Stetson University's Core Values and Life Beyond\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): David Dysart, PhD and the Student Honor Council\n\nWhat is the Student Honor Council and why should I be interested? Come and learn the answer! In this session, you will BE a member of the Council. Hear the various sides in a case of alleged academic dishonesty. Determine how it should be dealt with. How could it be avoided? What does academic integrity mean to my university and my future?\n\nStudent Ethics: What's Your Integrity Quotient (IQ)?\n\nValue: Personal Growth\n\nPresenter(s): Michelle Quinones\n\nThis workshop will include several interactive activities, leading off with a values continuum activity in which students will be asked to identify whether they agree or disagree with several statements. We will move further into a discussion on our core values and how they tie in with the Office of Community Standards and the core value of personal growth. A brief overview of our office and process will be provided. We will conclude the session with an overview of ethics, morals and integrity and end with a discussion of some scenarios.\n\nWhy Native Ecosystems Matter\n\nValue: Global Citizenship\n\nPresenter(s): Cindy Bennington, PhD, Karen Cole, PhD\n\nAs human population size increases, the area available for natural ecosystems declines, reducing critical habitat for wildlife, impacting the cycling of elements like water, carbon and nutrients, and directly and indirectly altering the availability of essential resources to humans. In addition to negative impacts on both human and non-human inhabitants of Earth, habitat loss also results in fewer interactions between people and the natural environment, removing the context within which people can understand and value arguments for preserving biodiversity and the conservation of natural resources. In this workshop, we will discuss the value of natural ecosystems to life on Earth. In particular, we will focus on the benefits of creating a citizenry educated about ecosystem conservation, using the Volusia Sandhill Ecosystem Teaching Landscape, the ongoing restoration of a longleaf pine habitat on the grounds of the Rinker Environmental Learning Center, as an example of one way in which these values can be translated to a public that is increasingly removed from the natural systems that sustain life on Earth. The workshop will include opportunities for participants to tour the landscape, learn about current student/faculty projects, and to engage in hands-on activities related to the educational mission of the site."
