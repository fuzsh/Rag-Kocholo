        "text": "This issue includes a tribute to physicist, philosopher, and science educator Henri Bortoft, who died on December 29, 2012, at his home in England. He was 73 years old. Throughout the years, we have covered Bortoft’s work in EAP because it speaks to a particular mode of environmental encounter that might be called a “phenomenology of the natural world.” In this issue of EAP, we include two tributes—the first by EAP Editor David Seamon, who studied with Bortoft in the early 1970s; the second, by philosopher Ingrid Leman Stefanovic, who has discussed Bortoft’s work in articles and books. We also reprint two of Bortoft’s writings: first, a portion of his 1971 article on authentic wholeness; and, second, a 2011 article Bortoft wrote for the Journal of Holistic Science. Also in this issue is an update from Torontoian Robert Fabian, who describes his recent citizen involvement with development along downtown Toronto’s Yonge Street. We end with a first for EAP: A cartoon envisioned by designer J. Kevin Byrne! Back issues of EAP, 1990-present, are available at: www.krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/1522.\n\nChristopher Alexander explored the world of built structures. He longed for buildings and spaces that touched and triggered our own psychological and spiritual structure. From his examples of spaces we experience as alive he distilled his Fifteen Properties: aspects and qualities in buildings that quicken us. As architects, we want to learn how we can create structures that embody the Fifteen Properties. Can we do so through consciously attempting to design them? In my experience of designing, we need more than a conscious attempt. We need an awareness of the goal of our designing. And Alexander himself gives us a glimpse of that goal in The Linz Café: Our goal is nothing short of designing as an offering to God. What might an offering to God mean? What might it mean as an attitude free from ideology or embalmed belief? The discoveries C. G. Jung made can help us get in touch with such a goal. Our goal is our own divine centre. Our challenge as architects is to open ourselves to the images and structures that appear on our paper or screens as we design. What is their source? Can we see ourselves in them? Can we meet our divine centre in them? Keywords divine centre; living structures; original experience Issue This commentary is part of the issue \"Assessing the Complex Contributions of Christopher Alexander\" edited by Michael W. Mehaffy (Sustasis Foundation) and Tigran Haas (KTH Royal Institute of Technology).\n\ns is January 11, 2011. Contact: Dr. John Murungi: jmurungi@towson.edu. The 13 annual conference of the Society for Phenomenology and Media will be held in Furtwangen and Freiburg, Germany, March 16-19, 2011. Abstracts for papers and panels should be received by January 14, 2011. Send abstracts, panel proposals, and questions to the conference host: Prof. Dr. Miguel A. García Hochschule Furtwangen; garcia@hs-furtwangen.de. The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies (IJTS), published twice a year, is dedicated to work involving an “interdisciplinary approach to understanding human nature and the world around us. It attempts to synthesize many complementary disciplines, including psychology, philosophy, religious studies, art, anthropology, history, and healing. Transpersonal studies may be generally described as a multidisciplinary movement concerned with the exploration of higher consciousness, expanded self/identity, spirituality, and human potential.” www.transpersonalstudi...\n\nIn this chapter, I encapsulate the complex, shifting relationship between phenomenology and architecture by speaking of an architectural phenomenology, which I tentatively define as the descriptive and interpretive explication of architectural experiences, situations, and meanings as constituted by qualities and features of both the built environment and human life (Otero-Pailos 2012; Seamon 2017). In demonstrating that architectural phenomenology has significant research and design value today, I first describe the phenomenological approach more fully, highlighting two key phenomenological concepts relevant for architectural understanding—lifeworld and natural attitude. Second, I overview the complicated thread of events whereby architects and architectural theorists became interested in phenomenology. Third, I discuss two phenomenological topics that have come to have value for architecture and briefly discuss their significance for architectural thinking: (1) environmental embodiment; and (2) architectural atmospheres. Last, I identify some key criticisms of architectural phenomenology and suggest what value it might have for the future of architecture, particularly in regard to the imminent arrival of virtual reality, virtual places, and virtual buildings.\n\nThis special issue of EAP celebrates 25 years of publication and includes 19 invited essays organized in terms of four themes: 1. Place—lived emplacement, place attachment, and environmental design as place making; 2. Nature—the lived constitution of the natural environment and natural world; 3. Real-world applications of phenomenological principles (transit design; virtual reality; environmental education); 4. Broader conceptual issues (the subjectivity-objectivity duality; phenomenology vs. analytic science; phenomenology as practiced by non-phenomenologists; phenomenological understanding vs. practical applications; parallels between real-world and phenomenological pathways). Contributors and essay titles are as follows: David Seamon, “Human-Immersion-in-World: Twenty-Five Years of EAP”; Robert Mugerauer, “It’s about People”; Jeff Malpas, “Human Being as Placed Being”; Eva-Maria Simms, “Going Deep into Place”; Sue Michaels, “Viewing Two Sides”; Dennis Skocz, “Giving Space to Thoughts on Place”; Bruce Janz, “Place, Philosophy, and Non-Philosophy”; Janet Donohoe, “Can there be a Phenomenology of Nature”; Tim Ingold, A Phenomenology with the Natural World”; Mark Riegner, “A Phenomenology of Betweenness”; Bryan E. Bannon, “Evolving Conceptions of Environmental Phenomenology”; John Cameron, “Place Making, Phenomenology, and Lived Sustainability”; Lena Hopsch, Social Space and Daily Commuting: Phenomenological Implications”; Matthew S. Bower, “Topologies of Illumination”; Paul Krafel, “Navigating by the Light”; Yi-Fu Tuan, “Points of View and Objectivity: The Phenomenologist’s Challenge”; Julio Bermudez, “Considering the Relationship between Phenomenology and Science”; Edward Relph, “Varieties of Phenomenological Description”; Ingrid Leman Stefanovic, “Phenomenology, Philosophy, and Praxis”; Elizabeth A. Behnke, “In Celebration of a Conversation of Pathways.”\n\nThis summer/fall 2018 issue of Environmental & Architectural Phenomenology includes the following items: • A “book note” on the recently published 2nd edition of philosopher Jeff Malpas’ groundbreaking Place and Experience: A Philosophical Topography, originally published in 1999. This expanded version includes a new chapter on place and technological modernity, “especially the seeming loss of place in the contemporary world.” • A “book note” on EAP editor David Seamon’s recently published Life Takes Place: Phenomenology, Lifeworlds and Place Making, which gives particular attention to the generative aspects of place and locates six place processes that Seamon identifies as place interaction, place identity, place release, place realization, place intensification, and place creation. • An essay by the late philosopher and science educator Henri Bortoft, who focuses on ways of thinking holistically, including the conceptual efforts of proto-phenomenologist Wolfgang Johann von Goethe; physicists Niels Bohr and David Bohm; and philosophers J. G. Bennett, Edmund Husserl, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. • An essay by retired environmental educator John Cameron, who begins a new series of essays on the lived relationship between interiority and exteriority, particularly as qualities of the natural world and place contribute to that relationship."
