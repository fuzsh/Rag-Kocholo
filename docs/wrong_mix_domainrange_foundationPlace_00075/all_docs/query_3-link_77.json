        "text": "The Founder Institute's four-month curriculum covers everything you would expect from an early-stage startup program, including topics like \"Startup Legal and IP” towards the beginning, to “Fundraising” near the end. What makes the curriculum special is the Mentors that teach it, whose passion, feedback and support helps our companies avoid rookie mistakes and set the foundation for a meaningful and enduring company.\n\nThe Founder Institute carefully recruits approximately 25 Mentors per Semester, who are normally the CEO or founder of a successful startup. Rather than specialists or consultants, we prefer Founders and CEOs to give our companies \"the entrepreneur's perspective.\" The mentors share their experiences, best practices, and mistakes, while also providing specific guidance and feedback on the Founder companies.\n\nIn addition, the Founder Institute's unique Graduate Liquidity Pool allows our mentors to share in the equity of companies formed in each program - and, their share is based solely on the anonymous ratings they receive from the Founders both during, and after the program. In this way, the Founder Institute incentivizes mentors to take a special interest in our startups, and provide as much assistance as possible after the program.\n\nWe have a great lineup of Mentors confirmed for the Spring 2013 Silicon Valley Founder Institute, including many from out of town. See the full list below.\n\nAdeo Ressi\n\nCEO, TheFunded.com\n\nAdeo Ressi is Founding Member of TheFunded.com, an online community of 17,000 CEOs to research, rate, and review funding sources worldwide.
