Disruptive research opens up new markets, not yet covered or under development in existing companies. This is where entrepreneurship within MICAS meets research. MICAS is very successful in this model, leading to the creation of one spin-off every four years. The total amount of employment to date due to these spinoffs is over 300 full-time employees, mostly highly skilled IC designers and electronic-system engineers. As most companies are closely situated around the KU Leuven, this creates a local Silicon Valley ecosystem in the Leuven area. These spin-offs regularly operate in close collaboration with KU Leuven and the MICAS researchers.
