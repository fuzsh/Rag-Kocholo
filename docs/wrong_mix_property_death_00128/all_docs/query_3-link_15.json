        "text": "SY 2007-2008\n\nCollege of Business and Economics\n\nThe Model Employers in the Philippines\n\n51 RFG 3 04\n\nDr. Divina Edralin\n\nBusiness Management Department\n\nHuman resource management performs an integral and strategic function in managing firms. It is a key management tool since human resources are considered essential in the continued existence and success of any business. It is therefore, not surprising that management continuously invests in the recruiting, training and motivating of its people to develop effective and efficient managers, supervisors, and rank-and-file employees.\n\nThis paper contains an in-depth look at those human resource management practices that make a company a model or a good company to work for. This two-year research effort, involving 20 companies listed in the Top 1,000 Corporations and 1,937 employees and management representatives showcases the distinguishing Human Resource Management practices related to recruitment, training and development, performance management, compensation, labor relations, health and safety, and leadership.\n\nThe Employee Opinion Survey results showed that the firms were rated very good in their HRM practices.\n\nBased on the overall ranking of the judges across the seven HR practices, GMA Network got the highest ranking (x=2.72), followed by Ayala Land (x=5.00) and Yazaki-Torres (x=6.31). On the other hand, the lowest ranked companies are RFM (x=12.78); SKK Steel (x=13.16); and Fedders Koppel (x=13.66). Categorized by type of industry, Yazaki-Torres got the highest ranking in the manufacturing sector, followed by Unilever Philippines, and San Miguel Foods. In the non-manufacturing group, on the other hand, the highest rates companies are GMA Network; Ayala Land, and Toyota Makati.\n\nThe common emerging workplace patterns and best human resource management practices were clustered according to employment experience such as the creation of enabling structures and systems that intentionally enable individual employees and teams to translate the firms larger strategic goals into actual day to day work and achieve corporate goals; leadership such as focusing on the corporate vision-mission-goals and using self-empowering teams; and labor relations like engaging in productive social partnership of labor and management.\n\nCollege of Computer Studies\n\nMetaphors and the Construction of Knowledge\n\n67 F U 3 06\n\nDr. Zelinna Cynthia Pablo\n\nInformation Technology Department\n\nIn this study I examine metaphors on web-based portals, in particular examining their implications on how knowledge is constructed. Using case methods and discourse analytic techniques, I conduct a comparative study of Web-based portals established under a World-Bank project known as the Development Gateway. Drawing from previous work that suggests that three metaphors (expert, market, and community) are significant across portals, I select an “expert” portal and a “community” portal to examine particular ways in which knowledge comes to be constructed. My findings suggests that the expert portal is linked with the view of knowledge as universal, whereas the community portal is linked the view of knowledge as socially constructed. This in turn has implications on which stakeholders have more voice or less voice in the knowledge production process. An expert portal appears to be characterized by tightly controlled processes of knowledge construction wherein participants are limited to a few key players, while a community portal appears to have participative, relatively unstructured processes of knowledge production.\n\nPlagiarism Detector Generator\n\n40 F U 2 06\n\nDr. Rachel Edita Roxas\n\nSoftware Technology Department\n\nThis study involves the design and implementation of a plagiarism detector generator for OO student programs and performs the lexical and structural similarity measures of OO student programs using Java programs for testing. The system would accept as input the grammar of the programming language. The application would accept one folder per program group as input. Plagiarism styles to be detected by the system include but are not limited to (1) insertion, deletion and modification of comments, (2) changing names of variables, attributes and methods, (3) Changing the ordering of blocks of statements, (4) Changing the formatting of the source code, (5) Extraction of source code to a method, (6) copying the source code as it is.\n\nTesting was done in two parts. The first part uses the RKR algorithm implementation v1.0. The second one uses the verson 2.0 that addresses the inaccuracy of the plagiarism technique EXTRACT. The first part of of the testing uses ten program specifications (labeled as 1, 2, to 10). For each program specification, we considered one original program, five individuals (labeled as A, B, C D and E) implemented one each non-plagiarized independently coded program based on the program specification based on the original program using the five plagiarism styles. The respective percent accuracies in positively identified plagiarized codes for BLOCKS, VARIABLES, COMMENTS, EXTRACT and FORMAT are 78, 100, 100, 36 and 100. From the results, we can infer that some plagiarism techniques can be successfully detected by the RKR-GST pattern matching algorithm such as VARIABLES, COMMENTS and FORMAT which had 100% accuracy. BLOCKS obtained a 78% accuracy, while EXTRACT obtained a mere 36% accuracy. The overall positively identified plagiarized copies obtained 83% accuracy.\n\nFrom the results, the plagiarized programs that used the extraction method are not easily detected in the Plagiarism Detector 1.0. Version 2.0 was developed, and plagiarized programs that used the extraction method have been detected from 83 to 100% similarity measures with 100% detection. Unfortunately, it also obtained a 37.5% false positives.\n\nCollege of Education\n\nComparing Models for Generating a System of Activation and Inhibition of Self-Regulated Learning\n\n27 D U 2 07\n\nDr. Carlo Magno\n\nCounseling and Educational Psychology Department\n\nThe study investigated the effect of activation and negative affect on self-regulation. The activation factors are self-determination, disengagement, initiative, and persistence while negative affect is composed of worry, anxiety, thought suppression, and fear of negative evaluation. Separate measures were used for each factor and administered to 1454 collegiate students. A time-wave design was used where the activation and negative affect factors were administered in the first wave and the self-regulation in the second. It was hypothesized in the study that the effect of negative affect on self-regulation can be moderated by levels of activation factors. Three models were tested using Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) to determine which structure of negative affect and activation best generates self-regulation. The results show that activation and negative affect each differently affect self-regulation, p<.001 (RMSEA=.054, 2=505.43, GFI=.96). Negative affect can increase self-regulation when mediated by activation, p<.001 (RMSEA=.056, 2=527.22, GFI=.96). The effect of negative affect on self-regulation is weak if individuals posses high activation levels, p<.001 (RMSEA=.05, 2=309.64, GFI=.97). The theoretical and educational implications of the findings are discussed.\n\nTowards an Understanding of Spirituality and Perspectives on Teaching of Teachers from Selected Catholic Secondary School in Metro Manila\n\nDr. Roberto Borromeo\n\nEducational Leadership and Management Department\n\nThis study is the second phase of the two-phased study on “Spirituality in the Educational Workplace”. While the first phase focused on the spirituality and spiritual intelligence of administrators (Tanglaw, 2003, Vol. 9, No.2), the current study analyzed the teachers’ spiritual intelligence, their definitions of spirituality and their views of teaching and students. The results showed that the respondents had a relatively high level of spiritual intelligence and spirituality which is manifested in their concept of teaching which focus on service, evangelization and integral formation, and their view of students which emphasizes respect for human dignity.\n\nExploring Assessment Reform Policy and Implementation in Philippine Public Secondary Education\n\n34 F U 2 04\n\nDr. Sterling Plata\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nThis paper analyses aspects of the assessment reform that started in 2003 in the Philippines by evaluating its policy and its implementation. Documents from the Department of Education pertaining to the reform were reviewed to trace the alignment of pedagogy, assessment, and proficiency in English. In addition, focus group discussions and interviews were also conducted to see how English teachers in rural and urban public secondary schools interpreted the changes mandated to them by the Department of Education. Data collection started in 2003 up to 2007. The study uncovered some factors that might have led to the limited implementation of the assessment reform by the participants in the study.\n\nLanguage Amotivation and Approaches to Learning English among Filipino College Freshmen\n\n24 F U 2 06\n\nDr. Rochelle Irene Lucas\n\nDr. Mildred Rojo-Laurilla\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nThe present study explores Filipino college freshmen students’ approaches to learning in relation to amotivation (possible lack of motivation in learning English as a second language) and related experiences in using English outside the language classroom. Adapting Biggs (2001) and Legault et al’s (2006) to evaluate the learning approaches of the students in studying the target language, the researchers surveyed 224 students from different colleges in the university taking the first General Education English course (English one). The results of the study indicate that university freshmen students are neither predominant on either deep approach nor surface approaches to learning. They use both strategies to almost the same extent. In terms of dimensions of amotivation, the results indicated that freshmen students did not exhibit much of the indicators of amotivation implying that they still show interest and are motivated to learn English as a second language. The cohesiveness of their responses to questions on amotivation also indicated that they have more or less the same perceptions of the value of the task, task characteristics, and their beliefs about their abilities and efforts in learning English.\n\nTowards Transformative Teaching and Learning in the College of Education: The Journey\n\n44 F U 3 04\n\nDr. Auxencia Limjap\n\nScience Education Department\n\nDr. Remedios Miciano\n\nDr. Leonisa Mojica\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nTo help clarify and concretize the philosophy and practice of transformative teaching/learning for the College of Education faculty, modules on teaching philosophy and learning theories (Module 1), teaching strategy and assessment (Module 2), and classroom management (Module 3) were developed. Piloted on three different afternoons, the modules were each designed as a joint presentation between the researcher (as facilitator) and a resource person. All three modules merited a high evaluation from both the participants and the resource persons.\n\nThe main problem in piloting the modules was lack of time. Due to this problem, the assessment module was not carried out as it had been originally designed, and the workshop output (the reflection essays and the pedagogical plans of the participants) were sometimes short and sketchy. Nonetheless, as a whole, the design and piloting of the transformative teaching/learning modules was successful. Recommendations to further improve the content and delivery of the modules were given by the participants and the resource persons.\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nPreliminary Evaluation of Biodiesel from Canarium ovatum (Pili) Pulp Oil and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (Winged bean) Seed Oil\n\n7 F U/C/S 1 05\n\nDr. Luis F. Razon\n\nChemical Engineering Department\n\nBiodiesel or fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from triglycerides of vegetable or animal origin has become very attractive because it is biodegradable, it comes from a renewable resource, it is frequently nontoxic and has been commonly accepted to be carbon-neutral. It is easy to manufacture and requires only small changes in the fuel distribution infrastructure as compared to the changes required if alternatives such as hydrogen were pursued. However, some concerns remain about the cost and availability of feedstocks. The paper presents preliminary studies conducted on biodiesel derived from two novel sources of oil: the fruit pulp of Canarium ovatum (pili) and the seed of Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (winged bean). Oils were extracted using hexane and converted to fatty acid methyl esters. To convert the oils to FAME, a combination of acid-catalyzed esterification and base-catalyzed transesterification was found to be necessary after the oils were found to have a free fatty acid content greater than 0.5%. The resulting FAME were found to comply with selected parts of the biodiesel standards (ASTM D6751-02, EN14214 and PNS2020:2003) except for the kinematic viscosity of the FAME from winged bean which was above the maximum limit for the Philippine standard, PNS2020:2003. The study has presented initial results, which indicate that acceptable FAME may be obtained from these two new potential sources of feedstocks. This gives more alternatives to those who want to explore commercial exploitation.\n\nCommercialization of Acidic Geothermal Wells by pH Buffering\n\n05 RP (URCO) 1 SY2002-2003\n\nDr. Yolanda Brondial\n\nChemical Engineering Department\n\nThe Philippines being part of the “Pacific Ring of Fire” has abundant geothermal energy. However, since a substantial number of drilled wells produced acidic geofluid with high enthalpy and high wellhead pressure, it becomes imperative to research and develop methods/techniques to be able to use these wells for power generation.\n\nA potential pH buffering method for commercializing high-enthalpy acidic geothermal wells was explored in this study to raise the pH of the geofluids to greater than 3.5, a level considered by geothermal reservoir engineers to be non-corrosive to low-carbon steel. The pH buffering was modeled using statistical software with five design factors (pH geofluid, pH buffer, volume buffer, concentration buffer and temperature of solution), and one response factor (pH of resulting solution). The buffer used was ?-chloropropionic acid-Sodium ?-chloropropionate (BCPH-NaBCP). Experiments were conducted according to two different experimental designs with the second using the range of values found more effective from the first design. Experimental laboratory results showed that BCPH-NaBCP could raise the pH to > 3.5 for the first design and equal or greater than 4 for the second design and that the initial pH of geofluid, the pH, concentration and volume of BCPH-NaBCP solution significantly influenced the pH of the final solution. In both designs, the temperature of the solution did not show any significant effect on the buffered pH. It was also found out that for a closer range of conentration as in the second design, there was no significant change in the buffered pH. The best combination of factors in the first design was then used in a bench-scale set-up to investigate the possibility of applying pH buffering at high velocity. Results showed that BCPH-NaBCP was useful for fast buffering and could be used to commercialize acidic wells.\n\nIntegrating Affective Requirements in Car Design Methodologies\n\nMs. Rosemary Seva\n\nIndustrial Engineering Department\n\nThis study aims to validate a product design model using the concept of pre-purchase affect in a case study of car design in the Philippines. It is hypothesized that car attributes related to form can explain the experience of intense emotion in the car buying process and that this experience as well as good performance of sales agents can independently influence purchase intention. A field study was conducted in car dealerships of four car companies in the Philippines. A total of 133 samples were gathered consisting mostly of expert car buyers. Results of the study indicate that affective responses of consumers are triggered by both product form and function. However, more variables related to product form can explain the intensity of PPA such as shape and dimension. Intense experience of affect triggered a greater chance of purchasing the product. The performance of salesperson in the showroom cannot adequately explain the variation in data although the model is significant. However, helpfulness of the agents is a significant explanatory variable for purchase intention.\n\nA Comparative Analysis Between the Seafood Industries of the Philippines and the Asia Pacific Region Countries\n\n44 S U 3 06\n\nDr. Anna Bella Manalang\n\nIndustrial Engineering Department\n\nThe fisheries sector plays a major role in the Philippine economy as it continuously provides employment to about one million of its currently 80 million constituents and generates revenue, the foreign trade performance of the fishery industry in 2004 registering a net surplus of 433.1 million dollars. However, the Philippine fisheries are presently threatened due to poor management. This has caused the stagnation of the industry resulting to decreasing fish catch and habitat degradation. This is happening to the Philippines while fisheries in other countries flourish. This study documents the performance of the fisheries sector of the different countries found in the Asia-Pacific region. It identifies different factors, which play a role in the performance of fisheries of the different respective countries identified. The study starts with an over-all look at the industry in the region. It then delves into the industry of each country. It touches upon the economic impact and the recent trend of the industry for each country. The study then centers on the Philippine fisheries, touching upon issues that may have contributed to the decline of the industry.\n\nAutonomous Mapping Robot Using Odometry and Sonar Sensors\n\n32 F U/C 2 06\n\nMs. Phyllis Lim\n\nManufacturing Engineering and Management Department\n\nToday, some robots use pre-specified maps to help them do their tasks like transporting or searching items. Minor changes in the environment may pose problems because it may impede the movement or function of the robot. This project aims to create a self-navigating, map-generating mobile robot using an array of ultrasonic sensor and odometry. The mobile robot successfully demonstrated the capability to build two-dimensional profile of the navigated environment. If accomplished this through a repetitive process of moving to a new position, sensing the environment, updating the map and planning subsequent motion. This demonstrates that an autonomous mapping mechanism can increase the versatility of a robot by allowing it to react to changes in the environment and adjusts actions accordingly.\n\nIndoor Air Quality Investigation of Classrooms in Selected Grade Schools in Metro Manila\n\n21 F U/S 1 05\n\nDr. Manuel Belino\n\nMechanical Engineering Department\n\nThis study investigated the indoor air quality of selected grade school classrooms in Metro-Manila. It considered three schools located in strategic areas; namely, northern, central, and southern part of the metropolis. Air sampling tests determined the concentration of chemical contaminants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, benzene, and toluene. The concentration of total respirable dust, temperature and relative humidity of the indoor air were also determined.\n\nThe level of chemical contaminants and total respirable dust found in all the grade school classrooms of the three schools selected in the study were below the maximum threshold limit value. Although considerable amount of carbon dioxide was detected during the air sampling, its highest concentration level was still within the threshold limit value based on the Occupational Safety and Health Standard of the Department of Labor and Employment. The recorded temperature and relative humidity were generally within the design conditions for comfort cooling except those in fan-ventilated classrooms.\n\nThe common sicknesses and/or discomforts that the children reported they experienced in the classrooms such as colds, cough, headache, nausea and difficulty in breathing were poor air quality related respiratory sicknesses/discomforts. However, such could not be attributed to indoor air pollutants such as the chemicals and volatile organic compounds since their concentration levels were within the threshold limit value of the standard.\n\nThermodynamic Analysis of Integration Options to Improve the Net Energy Balance of Biofuel Production\n\n(Paper: A Fuzzy Linear Programming Extension of the General Matrix-based Life Cycle Model)\n\n12 F U/C 3 06\n\nDr. Alvin Culaba\n\nMechanical Engineering Department\n\nDr. Raymond Tan\n\nChemical Engineering Department\n\nA fuzzy linear programming extension of the general life cycle model is described. The model is suitable for applications involving system design and optimization wherein fuzzy target levels for environmental flows or impacts are specified, and wherein multiple technological alternatives capable of providing equivalent products or services are present within the life cycle boundaries. Solving the model results in an optimal mix of technologies that embodies the best compromise of the fuzzy environmental targets specified. The model formulation is concise and consistent with the generalized matrix-based LCA model; its linearity also makes identification of the optimal solution straightforward. Applications of the model to two illustrative case studies are also given.\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts\n\nExplaining Angelo: The Philippines as a Developing State in the US-led Coalition of the Willing\n\n26 F U 2 04\n\nMr. Edito Gan\n\nInternational Studies Department\n\nThis study will explore the development of international security cooperation against terrorism since 9/11 and the part that developing states play in it. Using the Philippine government’s attempts to negotiate and eventually come to terms with the terrorist Islamic Army (Khaled bin al-Waleed corps) for the release of Angelo De La Cruz in July 2004 despite US disapproval as case stusy, the proponent will employ a two-level model to ascertain how domestic pressure affects a developing state’s commitment to international cooperation against terrorism in hosspots like Iraq.\n\nThe Politics of Ethnicity and Self-determination: The Making and Unmaking of the Moro Secessionist Movement\n\n36 N 2 03\n\nDr. Rizal G. Buendia\n\nPolitical Science Department\n\nThis paper is another effort to examine the issue of Muslim separatism. However, unlike other approaches the study analyzes secessionism from the perspective of ethno politics. It brings in the ethnic factor in the conflict between the state and Muslims’ quest to create their own nation-state. It appraises the significance of the politics of ethnicity in strengthening and weakening of Muslims idea of Bangsamoro identity and how such identity serves a political purpose.\n\nUsing a hybrid framework which combines Paul Brass’ and Abner Cohen’s instrumentalist approach to ethnicity on the one hand and Michael Hechter’s and Michael Banton’s rational choice theory on the other hand, the paper argues that the complexity of the current separatist war is not simply due to the weakness of the state but also due to the weakness of the Bangsamoro identity and notion of nationhood. This frailty allows the state to co-opt leaders of the movement and sabotage their legitimate quest to self-governance and political autonomy.\n\nThe reinvention of the Moro struggle towards self-determination is likewise examined using the just-cause or remedial right theory of secession advocated by Allen Buchanan and Anthony Birch, among others. This part of the study argues that although Moro self-determination would not be a promising agenda due to the international community’s effort to protect the state’s territorial integrity, secessionism cannot be ruled out as long as the state fails to address the legitimate demands and grievances of Muslims to meaningful self-governance.\n\nThe study concludes that the threat of national disintegration will continue until an appropriate and responsive institutional framework for political governance which can accommodate Mindanao’s social and ethnic diversity is determined. Hence, there is a need to lay emphasis on local good governance, the rule of law, improved civil-military relations, accountability of public officials for corruption, and human rights protection. To a large extent, these efforts will accelerate the early conclusion of conflict, hasten the process of peace building, and find a respectable and honorable final peace agreement between contenting forces. And more importantly, these would not only strengthen the Philippine nation-state but also considerably foster a cohesive national society.\n\nParents Living with HIV/AIDS\n\n27 F U 1 05\n\nDr. Roberto Javier, Jr.\n\nPsychology Department\n\nThis is an exploratory-descriptive research on the lives of mothers and fathers infected with the deadly virus, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The study employed the narrative interview method to generate stories of needs, concerns and experiences of parents living with HIV and the effects of chronic illness on their individual life as well as on their family affairs. The field researcher, a single person also positive with the virus used a set of guide questions to conduct interviews with 30 parents living with HIV. These parents were contacted through networking with local AIDS NGO’s and their consent to disclose the diagnosis and to share their story was sought prior to the actual interview. Transcript of interviews were content-analyzed to form categories. Parents with HIV were in their early and middle adulthood. All the parents contracted the virus sexually while their children were infected through maternal-to-child transmission. Almost all of them acquired the virus abroad. Almost all the men infected their spouses. The deadly virus was detected upon the death of a partner in AIDS-related illness. Diagnosis of children was acquired as the mother was identified HIV-positive. Single parents with HIV retorted their difficulties in parenting alone as a consequence of the death of a spouse. HIV-positive parents were distressed by their own dying with the illness and were in a dilemma of disclosure. However challenged with the problems of daily living, these parents continue to be involved in the development of their children through their life course. Parenting their sons and daughters provides them with a sense of accomplishment as being mothers or being fathers. Yet, they were still silently in sorrow and grief while living with the socially stigmatized disease. Providing psychosocial care for afflicted children and individual psychotherapy for patients, parents and children with HIV will promote wellness in the family.\n\nPreadoption Risk, Adoption Secrecy, and Family Functioning as Predictors of Adjustment of Filipino Adopted Children\n\n39 RP-D U/C 2 05\n\nDr. Ma. Caridad Tarroja\n\nPsychology Department\n\nThis study looks into the preadoption risk and postadoption factors (adoption secrecy and family functioning) that significantly predict the adjustment of 32 adopted children. Latent variable path analysis using partial least squares was employed to look into relationships among the latent variables and relationships between a latent variable and its indicators. Qualitative data and illustrative cases were likewise analyzed to look into variables that were deemed important factors in the adjustment of adopted children. The results consistently show that family functioning is the single important factor for Filipino adoptive families. Although no significant direct link exists between preadoption risk and adoption secrecy and adjustment of adopted children, adoption communication proves to be a significant predictor of family functioning.\n\nThe Catholic Social Teachings and the University\n\n54 F U 3 06\n\nDr. Ferdinand Dagmang\n\nTheology and Religious Education Department\n\nThe task of disseminating/teaching the Catholic Social tradition within the University cannot skirt around the person and location of the academician/professor and the hearers’ context and concerns. The academician’s expertise, exposure to various disciplines, and especially the culture of research would, however, introduce a certain problematic with regard to the particular process of handing on a tradition to students. This problem/tension between dissemination and interpretation reflects the classic hermeneutic problem. Using some principles of interpretation, this article clarifies the task of a creative dissemination as essential to the handing on of Tradition. Teaching the Catholic Social Teaching tradition becomes not only transmitting content but also an involved and embedded process of passing on a meaningful and valuable heritage. This concern to disseminate a significant Catholic Social Teachings tradition within the University may entail the development of the following: 1) attention to students’ social condition; 2) a more critically-informed social commitment; 3) the cultivation of an inter-disciplinary expertise and; 4) the nurturing of a deeper social awareness. All of these would enhance the process and exercise of relevant dissemination.\n\nInterreligious Dialogue Since Second Vatican Council: Retrospect and Prospect (In Response to the Call of FABC on Interreligious Dialogue)\n\n29 S U/C 2 04\n\nDr. Ismael Maningas, Jr.\n\nTheology and Religious Education Department\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe last thirty years, have seen ample statements issued at FABC assemblies, seminars and two volumes of the collection of FABC documents from 1970-1991, from 1992-1996 and 1997-2001 published under the title “For All the Peoples of Asia” are calling for the Church to take seriously this agenda of dialogue. However, a serious and critical look at our churches here in Asia, would lead us to a conclusion that dialogue seems rather low in the priority list and there seems to be a gap between theory and practice as commented by Bishop Lawrence Thienchai Samanchi, D.D.\n\nBishop Lawrence Thienchai Samanchi noticed that part of the reasons for this gap and disparity is lack of formation and information on the new thrust of the Church in Asia. Many have no access to the post-Vatican II teachings about the Church’s relation with other religions, in part because Church documents are sometimes too technical to be understood by the ordinary lay.\n\nIn this light, “The Resource Manual for Catholics in Asia Dialogue”, edited by Franz-Josef Eilers, SVD, is an attempt to address the issue, however it only hopes to play a small role in the education and formation of persons for interreligious dialogue. For this reason, this book aims at giving a bigger role in the education and formation of persons for interreligious dialogue.\n\nCollege of Science\n\nIsolation, Structure Elucidation and Antimicrobial Assay of Secondary Metabolites from Six Philippine Medicinal Plants\n\n19 S U/C/S 1 06\n\nDr. Consolacion Y. Ragasa\n\nChemistry Department\n\nThe air-dried leaves of Tectona philippinensis, an endemic and endangered Philippine medicinal tree, afforded four new chromomoric acid derivatives (1, 2, 3a and 3b). Their structures were elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Antimicrobial testing was carried out on 1-3 against a panel of bacteria and fungi. The following known compounds were also obtained from the leaves of the plant: 5-hydroxy-3,7,4′-trimethoxyflavone (4), 5,4′-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (5), squalene (6), a mixture of lupeol (7a) and β-amyrin (7b), chlorophyllide a (8), and hydrocarbons. Antimicrobial tests on 4 and 5 indicated low antifungal activity against the fungi, C. albicans and T. mentagrophytes. Compound 4 was also found to have low antibacterial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa.\n\nSEE FIGURE 1\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the corm of Musa errans, an endemic form of wild banana afforded 31-norcyclolaudenone (1), squalene, and a mixture of stigmasterol and sitosterol. The structure of 1 was elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Antimicrobial tests on 1 indicated that it has low activity against C. albicans; E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and T. mentagrophytes; and inactive against B. subtilis, S. aureus, and A. niger.\n\nSEE FIGURE 2\n\nThe dichloromethane extract of the air-dried flowers of Tagetes erecta afforded 2,2′:5′,2′-terthiophene (1) and 5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavanone (2).

I needed to draw graphs (a collection of vertices and edges) and I had to look for drawing packages to create my drawings. There was no single package that will serve my purpose and I had to write additional macros on top of those that are available. This challenged me to create macros to draw graphs. The first version of GraphTEX (which contains about 55 macros) appeared in 1994. This version of GraphTEXcontains about 168 macros for drawing graphs plus a lot more. Macros for drawing special graphs such as paths, cycles, fans, wheels, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and generalized Petersen graphs are included in GraphTEX Drawing Bézier curves with quadratic or cubic parametric equations are included. These are applied to make approximate drawings of circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, and sine and cosine curves. The approximation is shown to have a high degree of accuracy by showing that the maximum error in the drawing is very small and negligible. Parabolas are drawn correctly using second degree Bézier curves. GraphTEX is also capable of performing translation, reflection and rotation. Three-dimensional drawings and graphs can be created using GraphTEX. Miscellaneous macros about summation, multiplication, day, date, time, etc. are also included.\n\nI hope that GraphTEXcould provide most if not all the things that one needs in making drawings in a TEXor LATEXdocument. What GraphTEXlacks could perhaps be added without much difficulty by building other macros from its existing macros.\n\nThis project which consisted of expanding and enhancing GraphTEX including the writing of this book was done during the period September 2004 to August 2005 under the Research Faculty Program of De La Salle University-Manila.\n\nQuantum Percolation of Infinitely-Sized Disordered Clusters in Two Dimensions\n\n58 N 3 05\n\nDr. Eduardo C. Cuansing Jr.\n\nPhysics Department\n\n(58 N 3 05)\n\nDr. Eduardo C. Cuansing Jr.\n\nPhysics Department\n\nWe study the hopping transport of a quantum particle through finite, randomly diluted percolation clusters in two dimensions. We investigate how the transmission coefficient Tbehaves as a function of the energy E of the particle, the occupation concentration p of the disordered cluster, the size of the underlying lattice, and the type of the connection chosen between the cluster and the input and output leads. We investigate both the point-to-point contacts and the busbar type of connection. For highly diluted clusters we find the behavior of the transmission to be independent of the type of connection. As the amount of dilution is decreased we find sharp variations in transmission. These variations are the remnants of the resonances at the ordered, zero-dilution, limit.\n\nFor particles with energies within 0.25 ≤ E ≤ 1.75 (relative to the hopping integral) and with underlying square lattices of size 20 x 20, the configurations begin transmitting near Pα = 0.60with T against p curves following a common pattern as the amount of dilution is decreased.\n\nNear Pβ = 0.90 this pattern is broken and the transmission begins to vary with the energy. In the asymptotic limit of very large clusters we find the systems to be totally reflecting in almost all cases. A few clear exceptions we find are when the amount of dilution is very low, when the particle has energy close to a resonance value at the ordered limit, and when the particle has energy at the middle of the band. These three cases, however, may not exhaust all possible exceptions.\n\nSY 2006-2007\n\nCollege of Business & Economics\n\nThe Determinants of Firm Growth in Small And Medium Enterprises in the National Capital Region\n\nDr. Emilina R. Sarreal\n\nBusiness Management Department\n\nSeveral personality, firm attribute, and macroeconomic-based approaches had been made to determine their influence on firm start ups and expansion. Studies had constantly claimed that successful entrepreneurs have far-reaching impact on economic development by increasing employment, fostering stability, escalating the tax base building capacity in developing countries, and reducing poverty.\n\nThis study attempted to mix personality, firm attribute and macroeconomic factors through multidimensional growth model in ascertaining which variables significantly affected firm performance, personal growth of entrepreneurs, and economic growth. Primary data were collected through a survey of randomly selected SME owners and principal decision makers from the list provided by the Department of Trade and Industry-National Capital Region (DTI-NCR). These data were encoded and processed through SPSS software package using descriptive, correlational, and evaluative designs with the aid of the following statistical tools: frequency and percentage distribution, summary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum), chi-square test for mean differences, multiple and logistic regression modeling, and MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) for joint and separate interaction and main effects of the moderating variable.\n\nThis study concurred with Gibb and Davies (1990) in Pistrui (2002) that formal assistance, including training and consulting, did not have any significant impact on firm growth due to lack of empirical validation and the government’s inability to understand how external factors and constraints impacted firm growth. More importantly, entrepreneurship enhancing programs and policies in the Philippines were directed mainly to start up ventures rather than older firms uninformed of these programs and policies. Even the developed countries suffered the same fate as entrepreneurship enhancing programs and policies they implemented have only resulted in modest levels of entrepreneurial activities. Through no fault of their own, institutions concerned with providing formal assistance and entrepreneurship support incentives (ESIs) failed to consider what entrepreneurs need in the context of their environments.\n\nThe major findings of this study indicate that in the NCR determinants of firm, personal and economic growth differ from those which availed and did not avail of SME services:\n\n1) The form of ownership, non-managerial experience, nature of business, and the firm’s age are significant determinants of firm growth for respondents who availed of SME services;\n\n2) Formal education, average achievement, attendance in product skills (PD) and leadership seminars, previous entrepreneurial experience, and form of ownership are significant determinants of personal growth of SME owners and principal decision makers who availed of SME services. Factors that influenced personal growth of respondents who did not avail of any SME services include attendance in networking seminars and product development seminars, form of ownership, age, gender, and non-managerial experience;\n\n3) For those which availed of SME services, the nature of business is the only\n\nsignificant factor that explains their ability to contribute to economic growth. The form of ownership, nature of business and achievement orientation of SMEs that did not avail of SME services came out as significant factors that influence contribution to economic growth;\n\n4) SME service provided by DTI is a significant moderating variable that affect firm’s sales, profit, regular and contractual employee levels when combined with non-managerial experience, achievement orientation, form of ownership and nature of business;\n\n5) SME services exerted moderating effect on the form of ownership that influence personal growth through membership and leadership in trade associations;\n\n6) SME services significantly exerted moderating effect on the nature of business, specifically the wholesale and retail trade firms, that influence gross value added (GVA) contribution.\n\nThe findings of the study strongly recommended that the future environmental interventions undertaken by the government and SME owners should be consistent with the latter’s ability and propensity to enterprise, the type and source of managerial complexities they experience in their respective business sectors and their form of ownership. Thus, entrepreneurial and business seminars focusing on product development, industry briefings, leadership, and executive development programs should\n\nbe made available to “emerging entrepreneurs” or SME owners who have low ability and high propensity to enterprise. On the other hand, the government should make socioeconomic conditions suitable for firm expansion and growth for “high growth entrepreneurs” or SME owners.\n\nExternal and Internal Alignment Influence on the Performance of SMEs in the Philippine Furniture Industry\n\nDr. Edgardo N. Bolinao\n\nBusiness Management Department\n\nStrategic management scholars generally view environment scanning as a prerequisite for formulating effective business management strategies. Effective scanning of the environment is also seen by both large and small firms as necessary to the successful alignment of competitive strategies with environmental requirements and the achievement of the successful firm performance. This study of industry-specific small manufacturing firm examines contingency theories that link environmental conditions (industry life cycle stages), competitive strategy, owner characteristics (functional experience experiences), scanning (frequency and scope of scanning), and firm performance. The integrated alignment model incorporates: (1) external alignment (alignment between competitive strategies and an industry life cycle stage impact on firm performance); (2) integral alignment (alignment between competitive strategies and owner functional experience and their impact on firm performance); and (3) the impact on firm performance of frequency and scope of scanning on external alignment. The model is particularly useful to SMEs as it recognizes the main, often dominant role, that the owner of entrepreneur plays in small business operations.\n\nAssessing the Economic and Poverty Impacts of Reducing Carbon Emissions in a Small Liberalized Developing Economy: The Case of Philippines\n\nMr. Erwin L. Corong\n\nEconomics Department\n\nThis study analyzes the economic and poverty effects of restraining carbon emissions in a small liberalized developing the Philippines. The simulation results indicate that tariff reduction reduces the cost of fossil fuels resulting in an increase in carbon emissions. The economic cost of reducing carbon emissions by imposing a carbon tax is minimal when compared to the no carbon tax scenario. This is because the reduction in consumer prices, as a result of tariff reduction outweighs the increase in production cost that emanates from the imposition of the carbon tax. Overall results suggest that a carbon tax aimed at maintaining a zero growth in carbon emissions does not significantly sampan economic activity, affect poverty, and impede the country’s trade liberalization agenda. Thus, restricting carbon emissions via a carbon tax appears to be a sensible alternative that may satisfy the economic, poverty, and environmental objectives of the country.\n\nCollege of Computer Studies\n\nDesign and Implementation of an Automatic Bilingual (English-Tagalog) Lexicon extraction Algorithm from Corpora\n\nDr. Rachel Edita O. Roxas\n\nSoftware Technology Department\n\nAn improved alternative automated approach to (Tui, 2004) for the extraction of an English- Tagalog bilingual lexicon (or dictionary) from the comparable, non-parallel corpora is designed and implemented. Empirical tests show that the new approach has a potential to improve the translation quality of extracted terms to the lexicon.\n\nCollege of Education\n\nCorpus linguistics in the Philippines: Exemplary Analyses of the Philippine Component of the International Corpus English Project\n\nDr. Ma. Lourdes S. Bautista\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nPreface\n\nThis monograph is intended to introduce Filipino linguists, language educators, and even graduate students just becoming exposed to the study of language to a new way of doing linguistics, to its rewards and challenges.\n\nThis new way of doing linguistics, the new methodology is called “corpus linguistics” (Meyer 2002) and it requires two things: a relatively huge corpus of language data and a software program that can readily analyze the data. One such database is the Philippine component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-PHI), consisting of approximately one million words, and it is complemented by one-million-word parallel corpora from ICE – in this monograph, ICE-Singapore, ICE-Hong Kong, and ICE-Great Britain. For researchers interested in doing corpus linguistics, all theses corpora can be downloaded from the Internet at the ICE website http://www.ucl.ac.uk/English-usage/ice/index.htm.\n\nThe software program is a concordancing program – in this case, Oxford University Press’ WordSmith Tools (version 4) – that can arrange the data in an organized form so that frequencies of occurrence can be easily determined together with information on the clustering of words. WordSmith Tools can be bought from Oxford University Press by accessing the OUP’s website. For the information of DLSU faculty and students, the Department of English and Applied Linguistics of De La Salle University-Manila has one licensed copy housed in a computer in the English Language Laboratory.\n\nOn the other hand, ICE-Great Britain comes with a built-in software program with many more features in addition to concordancing, called the ICECUP or Corpus Utility Program. The ICECUP is capable of doing many kinds of analyses, but it can be used only with ICE-GB because only ICE-GB is a tagged and parsed corpus. How to use ICECUP is discussed and exemplified in great detail in Nelson et al. (2002). ICECUP can be made available to researchers who download ICE-GB from the ICE website.\n\nThis is the first monograph prepared in the Philippines showing the usefulness and sample results of doing corpus linguistics on Philippine data.\n\nChapter 1 (“Introducing corpus linguistics and the Philippine component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-PHI)”) provides an overview of the International Corpus of English, and particularly of the Philippine corpus, and it also introduces the concordancing software, WordSmith Tools. The reason for taking up these topics in great detail is to encourage researchers, especially young academics, to use the corpus (fully aware of its possibilities and its limitations) and to lose their fear of new software.\n\nThe next two chapters exemplify analysis of the ICE corpora using the concordance program, moving from the relatively simple and piecemeal analysis of Chapter 2 to the more complex analysis of Chapter 3. In Chapter 2 (“Validating the putative features of Philippine English, with cross-reference to other Englishes”), features of Philippine English that have been mooted in the literature are subjected to frequency tests and these frequencies are placed side-by-side with the frequencies of these features in Singapore English, Hong Kong, and British English. Chapter 3 (“Exemplary analysis of ICE-PHI, with cross-reference to other corpora”) replicates the analysis of Schneider of the Kolhapur corpus of Indian English (2000) in terms of the use of the subjunctive, the case marking of wh-pronouns, and the indefinite pronouns with -body and -one.\n\nIt is my hope that this work will make it possible for corpus linguistics to find new adherents in the Philippines and to generate new research using ICE-PHI that will illuminate the richness, the singularity, and the standardness of the variety of English we speak in the Philippines.\n\nThe Construction and Interpretation of Assignment Feedback in Higher Education\n\nDr. Josephine F. Mirador\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nThis thesis attempts to present a micro-sociological study of the language of assignment feedback in the social situation of higher education. Using a combination of qualitative discourse analysis, concordance analysis and case approach, I determined the relationships between tutor intentions in assignment feedback and the interpretation of feedback by postgraduate students in the MA Education programme of the University College Chichester (UCC). In this objective, I used the text of assignment feedback as the window to tutor intentions and as the trigger to understand student interpretation.\n\nMy findings revealed twelve types of categories or moves that tutors adopt in writing assignment feedback, the meaning behind tutor use of particular linguistic forms and grammatical constructions, and the concerns of postgraduate students in their interpretation of assignment feedback. The main finding of the thesis involves as mismatch in tutor intentions and student interpretation. This means while tutors and postgraduate students agree in general about the purpose of the feedback sheet, their expectations as to which purpose should take precedence differ: tutors believe feedback essentially fulfills a psycho-emotional function whereas postgraduate students see that feedback’s main function is for guidance.\n\nThis investigation has been originally conceptualized to look at the quality of assignment feedback in the MA programme in Education in UCC. This thesis then presents a model/framework with which to account for the relationship between tutor intentions and student interpretation in the social context of higher education in UCC. Aside from helping clarify the nature of the relationship between tutor intentions and student interpretation of assignment feedback, the model/framework presented here can be positively utilized to identify the components of the social order on which feedback in higher education anchors, and to highlight the value of looking at writing practices, power, and psycho-emotional support as key dimensions to explain the role of assignment feedback in higher education.\n\nDefining the Filipino Texter and Texting Style: A Sociolinguistic Analysis of Text Messaging in the Philippines\n\nDr. Mildred Rojo-Laurilla\n\nDepartment of English and Applied Linguistics\n\nThe study aimed at understanding and explaining the sociolinguistic dynamics of text messaging (texting or SMS) within the Philippine context. Using the theoretical framework of Hymes (1974) – the ethnography of speaking, the Filipino texters’ text messages were described in terms of: (1) setting, (2) participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, texting profile, perceptions about texting and the co-texters’ profile, (3) ends, (4) act sequences particularly topic and turn taking, (5) key particularly code switching and abbreviation patterns, politeness and speech acts, (6) instrumentality, (7) norms of interpretation and interaction, and (8) genre. Using multiple regression analysis, it was revealed that the texters’ age, sex and work were predictors of texting style. In terms of the discourse features, certain politeness markers, role, topics, speech acts and co-texter texting styles were also predictors of texting style. Perception and texting profile were weak predictors of Filipino texting style.\n\nThe study also proposes a sociolinguistic communication model of communication. The model shows the shared fields of experience of the texters and co-texters through symbolic interaction, as realized by constant communication over time (via texting) that allowed them to participate fully in the texting culture. What these texters and co-texters share in common are the same interpretations of the linguistic or discourse markers thus, producing a unique Filipino texting style.\n\nSocial Dimensions of Philippine Education\n\nDr. Adelaida L. Bago\n\nEducational Leadership and Management Department\n\nThe project involves the development of a book that explores the uniquely Asian and Filipino foundations of education in the country today. The aim of the project was to develop an instructional material that could help students, educational practitioners, and educational leaders better understand why education is what it is today.\n\nRight now available books and references explore universal principles and concepts and hardly contain information and discussion of the foundations of Philippine education that are unique and distinctively Asian, and more importantly, Filipino. As a consequence students have to be satisfied with literature on the foundations of education that is for the most part about western education and the factors responsible for its evolution to what it is today. Even those written by local authors in general, discuss the universal foundations of education in generic terms largely based on the perspective and experience of western countries. Because of the dearth of instructional materials on the foundations of the Philippine Education, the proponent decided to develop a book that would address this specific concern and would help answer the need of the educational community.\n\nThus the book is an attempt by the author to the need for an instructional material that will focus on the different social dimensions of Philippine education: philosophical, historical, psychological, and legal and their impact on curriculum, instruction, and structure/organization. In the writing of the book, the author reviewed local materials both conceptual and empirical in order to incorporate regional and local perspective and experiences in the discussion and related these whenever possible to universal foundations.\n\nIn order to achieve the objectives of the project, the book presents an extensive historical overview of Philippine Education in terms of three important concerns: curriculum, instruction (teaching-learning) and structure (organizational as well as educational levels) and the philosophical, psychological, sociological, legal and educational levels) and the philosophical, psychological, sociological, legal and leadership dimensions that underpin its growth and evolution. Below is the conceptual framework of the book.\n\nBased on the framework, the book is divided into 6 chapters. Each chapter corresponds to a social dimension. The first chapter discusses the sociology of education. The five succeeding chapters focus on the different social dimensions: philosophical, historical, psychological, legal and leadership. The chapter on the leadership dimension provides a profile of the different educational leaders who steered the educational sector during the last century and their contributions to the evolution and growth of Philippine education.\n\nA Proposed Framework for the Effective Management of Preschools\n\nMs. Lilia S. Bautista\n\nEducational Leadership and Management Department\n\nThis study was aimed at the development of a framework for the effective management of preschools. Bases for the framework were the conceptual literature, primarily the Revised Head Start Performance Standards (RHSPS), and actual management practices in selected, top performing preschools in Metro Manila.\n\nResults showed that the participant schools observed most of the practices in all the management areas covered by RHSPS. No management practices other than those covered by the RHSPS are observed in the participant schools. It is recommended that the proposed framework for the effective management of preschools be tried out in the local setting, particularly in Metro Manila. It is further recommended that the study be replicated in other parts of the country to validate the proposed framework.\n\nDevelopment of a Web-Based Courseware in Integrated Research and Statistics for the Executive Program in Educational Leadership and Management of DLSU-Manila\n\nDr. Flordeliza C. Reyes\n\nEducational Leadership and Management Department\n\nThis is an URCO-funded research, which was inspired by the CREM training program on designing a basic, interactive, multimedia presentation using HyperStudio. Technical aspects, such as the graphic design of the hyperstacks and cases of some missing links, were enhanced and solved respectively, with the assistance of the Director and the staff of the center.\n\nThis courseware is primarily intended for the use of students of the predominantly on-line, PhD on Educational Leadership and Management Executive Program of ELMD. However, it may used by graduate students of education, educational management, and related in other higher education institutions.\n\nThis is a self-learning tool aimed at helping students understand and conduct research. As such, it allows them to navigate the entire course content in a non-linear fashion, based on their learning pace, abilities, interests, needs, and background knowledge of research and statistics. Reflection and self-test questions are interspersed with information materials to facilitate self-assessment and direction in accessing content. To help students who may lack the needed background to understand the more advanced topics on research and statistics, a review of basic or fundamental concepts has been included. In addition, to facilitate understanding of abstract concepts, the courseware presents an array of concrete examples and hyperlinks on: (a) conceptual and empirical literature available on the Internet, (b) research studies I have conducted and a few others done by my graduate students, and (c) lectures I have prepared for teaching graduate courses in statistics and research in DLSU-Manila and in conducting seminar-workshops for professional organizations and teachers in other educational institutions.\n\nThe courseware presents research both as a process (how to conduct research) and as a product (the research report). It was also so designed as to facilitate understanding of the applications and limitations of statistics in research; the different research methods (from applied to pure research) and techniques; the criteria for evaluating research, and the different ways of data analysis (qualitative and quantitative).\n\nThe courseware also includes PowerPoint presentations, with hyperlinks. Hence, aside from being a learning resource, this courseware may also be used as a teaching tool by teachers of graduate research and statistics.\n\nExploring Social Axioms and Personal Epistemologies in the Context of Philippine Schools\n\nDr. Allan B. I. Bernardo\n\nScience Education Department\n\nAdapting the Social Axioms Survey for Philippine Research: Validating Filipino and English Versions\n\nThe study was conducted was explore the validity of English and Filipino versions of the Social Axioms Survey (SAS) for studying the social beliefs for Filipino participants. An 80-item version of the SAS was used in the study, focusing on five scales corresponding to five dimensions of social beliefs defined by Leung et al. (2002): social cynicism, fate control, social complexity, religiosity, and reward for application. The SAS, which was in English, was translated into conversational Filipino. The 852 college students who participated in the study were asked to answer one of the two language versions. Based on the responses, the internal reliability of most of the scales of the two versions of the SAS were less than adequate. The reliability of the scales were improved by removing items with low item-total correlations, creating abridged versions of the two language versions of SAS. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with each of the two abridged language versions; the results were mixed for both language versions, with only some indexes indicating good fit with the data. The results indicate that the Filipino and English versions of the SAS may be tapping the dimensions of fate control and social cynicism in different ways. The discussions focussed on the possible explanations for the language differences related to these two scales, and on the usefulness of the abridged versions for studying social beliefs of Filipinos.\n\nExploring Epistemological Beliefs of Bilingual Filipino Preservice Teachers in the English Filipino Languages\n\nThe study investigated the epistemological beliefs of bilingual Filipino preservice teachers using Filipino and English versions of the Schommer Epistemological Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to determine the dimensions and structure of the epistemological beliefs of 864 preservice teachers. The results revealed two factors: Fixed Ability and Simple Knowledge, and that the same factors were found using the Filipino and English versions of the questionnaire. There were gender differences in the beliefs of those who answered the questionnaire in Filipino, and the two factors were correlated to specific social axioms or beliefs (social complexity, religiosity, and reward for application). The results were discussed in terms of how they contribute to the growing evidence regarding the possible problems with particular multidimensional theories and quantitative measures of epistemological beliefs. But the results also indicate how the specific epistemological beliefs of the Filipino preservice teachers may be problematic as they might be associated with teaching behaviors that do not promote deeper learning and more critical thinking among Filipino students.\n\nSocial Axioms, Orientation of Achievement Motives, and Hope Influence Filipino Students’ Achievement Goals\n\nThe study was conducted to verify hypotheses on the relationship between social beliefs (social axioms), orientation of achievement motives, hope, and different achievement goals. Hypotheses were based on the assumptions of self-determination theory that specify a dialectical relationship between motivations and the environment. In particular, students’ beliefs about whether the social environment is supportive of either autonomous or relatedness needs was hypothesized to influence achievement goals. 257 students completed questionnaires on (a) social axioms, (b) individual vs. social-oriented achievement motives, (c) hope, and (d) achievement goals. Their responses were used to verify hypothesized path models leading to three types of achievement goals. The results provide some support for the hypotheses that students who hold beliefs that the social environment support self-instrumentality (reward for application, social complexity, and the opposite of social cynicism) develop more individual-oriented motives and stronger sense of hope, and adopt mastery goals. On the other hand, students who hold beliefs that the social environment supports social-instrumentality and not autonomy (reward for application, fate control, and religiosity) develop more social-oriented motives, and adopt performance goals.\n\nA Tracer Study of the PhD Graduates of the College of Education, 1990-2005\n\nDr. Bee Ching Ong Kian Koc\n\nScience Education Department\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to trace the whereabouts of the PhD graduates produced by the Science Education Department of the College of Education in terms of their profession growth and job positions in the academe and their socio-demographic-economics status. The evaluation was based on the objectives of the PhD in Science Education programs to produce science educators and researchers imbued with quality education in there area of specialization, proficient with content and teaching pedagogy and ready to do their share in transforming society. Descriptive-survey method was employed using researcher-made survey questionnaire to achieve the objectives of the study. A follow-up interview was done to gather additional information about the usefulness of the curriculum to their job position and job satisfaction. The respondents include about 70 doctoral graduates from 1990-2005, whose names and addresses were retrieved from the registrar’s records. The data gathered from the survey questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Only 32 survey questionnaires were returned and this represents 47% retrieval rate. The findings of the study indicated that all graduates have stable teaching job and all doing research. About 90% indicated that they used their knowledge and skills to a high extent either in teaching-learning process or in doing administrative work. The female respondents had twice as high participation rate in professional organization than male respondents in terms of membership, attendance in conferences, and position held in the organizations. It further reveals that female respondents had more scholarly researches, either published or unpublished, than male respondents. Moreover, only female respondents have completed researches with foreign institutions. As a whole, the respondents of the study had job stability and financial stability. Majority of them had their own house and computer with printer and other educational equipments needed in their teaching profession.\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts\n\nThe Integration of Domestic Violence Issues in the Nursing Curriculum: Effects Of the Use of Teachers’ Guides and Student Learning Modules on the Faculty and Students In Selected Philippine Nursing Colleges\n\nDr. Pilar Ramos-Jimenez\n\nBehavioral Sciences\n\nThe integration of domestic vioLence issues into the nursing curricuLum of SitLiman University was a piLot project that was initiated in I 997 to 2000 by De La SaLLe University-SociaL DeveLopment Research Center’s Task Force on SociaL Science 8 Reproductive HeaLth (TFSSRH), a smaLL group comprising of health professionaLs and sociaL scientists, a Lawyer, and representatives of women’s organizations. This project was undertaken in coLLaboration with the Association of Deans of Philippine CoLLege of Nursing (ADPCN) with funding from The Ford Foundation (TFF) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). ELeven student Learning modules and teachers’ guides for nine nursing subjects were written by seLected SiLLiman University’s sociaL science and nursing facuLty members in partnership with the TFSSRH. These moduLes were pubLished and subsequentLy endorsed by ADPCN in its annuaL convention in 2000. In June 2002, SiLliman University conducted a one-week training for seLected nursing schooLs in the use of the foregoing tooLs for their respective institutions.\n\nThe main objective of this study was to determine the effects of the use of the student Learning moduLes and teachers’ guides on the facuLty and students of five nursing schooLs (two in Luzon, two in the Visayas, and one in Mindanao) that participated in the June 2002 training at SiLLiman University. SpecificaLLy, the study examined the (a) status, strategies and processes adopted by the nursing schooLs.in utiLizing the Learning tooLs, (b) the facuLty and students’ perceived beneficiaL effects and difficuLties using the foregoing tooLs, (c) the strategies used by the facuLty to overcome their difficuLties, (d) indicators used by the nursing schooLs to assess the competencies of their graduates, and (e) sustainabiLity and prospects of the continued use of the integrated tooLs in the seLected nursing institutions. Key informant interviews with schools administrators and focus group discussion with facuLty and students were the main methods used in the study. The coordinator of the Mindanao Working Group on Reproductive HeaLth, gender and sexuaLity, a consortium of tertiary academic institutions in the island, was interviewed because of the current effort of the working group in training new nursing colleges in the use of the Learning tooLs in partnership with SiLtiman University’s faculty-writers.\n\nThe findings of the study showed that only SilLiman University’s College of Nursing, the pilot institution, completely utiLized the student Learning modules and teachers’ guides. Two nursing schools partialLy used some learning tools in selected subjects. The other two schools used them mainly as references. One of these schools had developed its own psychology module which had incorporated domestic violence issues while the other had shifted to problem-based learning approach.\n\nThe learning tools were assessed by the facuLty of the schools that fully or partially used them, as student friendly. They served as eye openers to students regarding this public health issue. They claimed that students shared personal experiences in class and they discussed what they had learned with their parents and other family members. They were also able to relate with survivors during their community work. They could easily identify features of an abused woman or child and make the appropriate referrals. When students have personal domestic problems, teachers would refer them to their school’s guidance and counseling office. However, it was expressed by a nursing school administrator that the staff from this unit needed gender-sensitivity training to enable them to become more sensitive to gender and sexuality issues confronting male and female nursing students.\n\nThe students from the foregoing schools, on the other hand, claimed that the lessons regarding domestic violence broadened their perspectives and improved their skills in identifying DV situations and in understanding the contexts of survivors. Some students said that they had become advocates within and outside their families. They assessed that they would become good nurses in the future because they would be able to manage survivors of domestic violence. They also understood the situation of the DV perpetrators.\n\nThere appears to be some qualitative differences in the responses of students from schools that fully or partially utilized the learning materials compared to those who used these tools as references only. The former seem to have a better grasp of the concepts including the gender and cultural dimension of domestic violence and the responsibilities as well as nursing tasks of caring for DV survivors.\n\nThe difficulties raised by both the faculty and students were related to the contents of the modules and some logistical constraints posed by the nursing curriculum. The faculty found it difficult to follow the suggested duration or time in using each module because of the numerous additional concepts required in the nursing curriculum. They try to manage this difficulty by replacing suggested exercises with other shorter activities or by holding class discussions in laboratory classes which have more time allotment. They also noted outdated data of DV cases, policies, and programs. They managed this difficulty by searching for new or current data or by inviting external resource persons such as the police, lawyers, health professionals or local government officials. Due to current high demand for nurses abroad, the nursing schools are experiencing a rapid turnover of its faculty. This development calls for the added task of training new teachers who are not only competent but also gender and culture-sensitive in imparting the values, concepts and tools of the profession to nursing students.\n\nAside from dated information, some students mentioned that their lessons appeared redundant because of the practice of reviewing previous topics prior to the introduction of new lessons. Other difficulties mentioned was the absence of clear or specific guidelines on what to do when confronted with DV cases, the unattractive format and high cost of the modules (especially in the school where every nursing student was required to procure her own copy.)\n\nNo major revisions have been made regarding the contents of the modules except the update of some facts and figures. The Mindanao Working Group added new data and descriptions about the situation of Muslims and indigenous people in Mindanao to ensure that the learning materials are relevant to the social context of these population groups in the island.\n\nNo indicators were developed by the nursing schools to measure the competencies of the nursing graduates and practitioners. The nursing schools will continue using the modules in the current manner that these are utilized (either totally or partially or as references). The faculty-writers, however planned to revisit and update the modules. Aside from conducting training for nursing schools in the use of the student learning modules and teachers’ guides, the Mindanao Working Group has pushed forward the integration of gender, sexuality and RH in other academic fields (e.g., social work, mass communication and development communication)-implying that curricular integration has become a useful strategy in the inclusion of public health issues in pre-service training.\n\nPagsipat at Teknika ng Maikling Kuwento, Malikhaing Sanaysay, at Iskrip at mga Piling Akda\n\nDr. Fanny A. Garcia\n\nFilipino Department\n\nSa karaniwan ay may magkabilang mukha ang pagtingin sa mga manunulat, sa larangan ng pagsusulat, particular ang malikhaing manunulat/malikhaing pagsulat.\n\nSa isang banda, ang romantisadong pananaw na: isinisilang sa mundo ang sadyang mga magiging manunulat, espesyal sila; isang espesyal na larangan ang pagsusulat. Nagsusulong sa ganitong pananaw ang kanonisasyon ng sistema ng edukasyon sa mgailing akda/manunulat (batay umano sa mga pamantayang unibersal; batay rin madalas sa gayo’t ganitong parangal at gantimpala sa pagsulat), gayundin ang mga patungkol na “dakilang mga akda/manunulat” ng mundo, ng gayo’t gayong bansa o lahi o panahon.\n\nSa kabilang banda ay ang pananaw na ang malikhaing manunulat, ang larangan ng malikhaing pagsulat ay kaugnay ng kahirapan at pagkamiserable. Ang isang manunulat ay isang nilalang na di praktikal at lagging nangangarap nang gising; sarili man lang niya’y hindi niya kayang buhayin nang komportable. Sa opinyon ng marami, maliban na lang kung may iba pang pagkakakitaan, ang malikhaing pagsulat ay isang larangang dapat iwasan.\n\nSa katunayan, lahat naman tayo ay mga “manunulat”; sa particular, lahat namantayo ang mga “kwentista”. Sa pagkausap natin sa iba’t ibang tao sa ating paligid, tayo ay mga kuwentista; sa pagkausap sa ating sarili ay kuwentista rin tayo. Lagi’t lagi nating di malay (unconsciously) na ginagamit ang mga pormal na sangkap ng anyo/genre ng maikling kuwento: karakterisasyon, tagpuna, plot, tema, atbp. Lagi’t lagi, at sa buong panahon ng ating buhay.\n\nMay natural na bigkis ang pagkukuwento-kuwento sa tunay na buhay at ang pormal na anyo ng mailking kuwento at masasabi ring may panlabas mang pagkakaiba ang mga anyo ng pampanitikang sanysay (literary essay) at iskrip, sa esensya ay magkakapamilya pa rin ang mga ito: pare-parehong nagkukuwento, pare-parehong may ikinikuwento. Pare-parehong may mga sangkap na kabahagi ng isa’t isa (exposisyon, dayalogo, tagpuan, plot, atmospera, atbp.) kaya ang pagiging malay sa mga kuwento-kuwento ng tunay na buhay (tagapagkuwento man o basta masugid na tagapakinig) at ang malay na pag-aaral kung paano sumulat ng maikling kuwento, matutuklasan ng maraming manunulat, ay daan na rin palapit sa pampanitikang sanaysay at iskrip.\n\nLahat tayo ay magkasabay na estudyante at/o praktisyoner ng malikhaing pagsulat. “Kuwentista” tayo sa tunay na buhay. Sa bawat pagbasa natin ng mga pampanitikang akda, sa bawat panonood natin ng dula/tv/pelikula, pakikinig ng mga drama sa radio ay indirek na nag-aaral na tayo kung paano magsulat sa mga anyong ito.\n\nBawat buhay ay mayamang bukal ng karanasan na lagi’t lagging mapagkukunan ng material na maikukuwento, maisusulat. Ang pagiging malay ng mas marami sa ating likas na pagigin “kuwentista” upang mabigyan ng nakasulat na anyo ang mayamang bukal at mina ng karanasan, mula man sa ating mismong buhay at/o ng iba, o mula sa malikhaing interaksyon ng realidad at ng imahinasyon, ay magbubunga ng mas maraming akda, mas maraming manunulat. “Hayaang bumukadkad ang sandaang bulaklak,” wika nga ng isang kilalang Asyano. Ito ang demokratisasyon sa larangan ng mailkhaing pagsulat.\n\nKailangang lapitan ang bukal ng malikhaing pagsulat nang walang romantisado o biased na pananaw upang tunay na manamnam at maginhawahan sa dalisay at lamig ng tubig nito.\n\nCyberkultura ng Kabataan sa Kamaynilaan: Isang Empirikal at Kwalitatibong Pag-aaral sa Penomenon ng Internet\n\nDr. Rhoderick V.

Escalante\n\nHistory Department\n\nThe primary concern of the book is to discuss the political career of Taft in the Philippines. The discussions revolve around the policies and programs that he used to pacify the Filipinos and convince them to accept American rule. He is portrayed as a legislator, chief executive, troubleshooter, lobbyist, diplomat, judge and propagandist. Towards the end, the book concludes that Taft is a major character in Philippine history because he orchestrated the establishment of American colonial institution in the Philippines, an episode in Philippine history that has had great effect on the lives of Filipinos until the present time.\n\nThe main body of this research project is divided into four major parts. First, it discusses the role of Taft in the Second Philippine Commission. Specifically, it focuses on the inquiry of the Commission and its recommendation to the Committee of Insular Affairs. Second, it discusses the role of Taft in the implementation of McKinley’s “Benevolent Assimilation” policy. Taft is presented as an effective pacifier and colonial administrator. Third, the book discusses Taft’s relationship with the Catholic Church. During the first decade of American rule, the Church was beset with numerous problems and a lot of them had something to do with their property. Despite the principle of separation of Church and State, Taft intervened in all these issues and many of them were settled amicably. Lastly, the book tackles the achievements of Taft as a colonial bureaucrat. Included in the discussion are his public health programs, tariff policies, educational reforms, infrastructure projects and political innovations.\n\nThe documents used in reconstructing the career of Taft in the Philippine were mostly government publications written by colonial officials. The most significant of them are the Report of the Taft Philippine Commission, Report of the Philippine Commission, Annual Report of the Governor General, The Correspondences Between Taft and the Holy See, Senate Document 190 and the Congressional Records of the United States of America. The author also used the personal letters of Taft, which are currently deposited in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress. He also consulted the memoirs of some American authors who were in the Philippines during the first decade of the 20th century like Daniel Williams, Edith Moses, Helen Taft, James Blount, David Barrows, George Dewey, Charles Burke Elliott, William Cameron Forbes, Dean Worcester and a few others. To further enrich the narrative, he also consulted the leading newspapers during this period and the most useful of them are the New York Times, Manila Times, Cablenews American and the Manila American.\n\nUnderstanding Policy Shift: Class Interests, Exogenous Pressure, and Policy Reform in the Philippines\n\nDr. Dennis D. Trinidad\n\nInternational Studies Department\n\nThe paper is a theoretical discourse on policy shift, defined as the turning point or threshold by which policymaking agents abandon old policy preferences in favor of new ones. It contends that policy shift is contingent upon two factors: (1) the nature of elite interests, and (2) exogenous pressures like world prices and economic crises. The dismantling of cohesive elite interests is essential before policy shift could take place. Exogenous pressures can help achieve this by altering the settings which define these interests.\n\nSpecifically, the paper examines the liberalization of trade and investment in the Philippines as an episode of policy shift. In the 1980s, the sudden reversal of international prices of agricultural products forced many agrarian elites to abandon agriculture and shift to other more lucrative business ventures like services and manufacturing. In the process, they explored new areas of interest and formulated corresponding sets of policy preferences. Against this backdrop and under a new constitution, former President Fidel V. Ramos and his successors pursued liberalization. The trend toward further economic liberalization became irreversible due to the country’s commitment to international agreements such as World Trade Organization, ASEAN Free Trade Area, ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Philippine-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.\n\nThe S/subjects of the Nation in Philippine Kritika Dis-Courses from Lucila V. Hosillos, Bienvenido L. Lumbera, Gemino H. Abad, Soledad S. Reyes, Virgilio S. Almario, and Epifanio San Juan, Jr.\n\nDr. David Jonathan Y. Bayot\n\nLiterature Department\n\nThe present study is guided by two goals: (1) to represent the theory-in-praxis-towards-theory of six major Filipino critics – Lucila V. Hosillos, Bienvenido L. Lumbera, Gemino H. Abad, Soledad S. Reyes, Virgilio S. Almario, and Epifanio San Juan, Jr. – on the “national question” of Philippine literature; and (2) to argue the political usefulness of this quest to the trajectory of inquiries and understandings of this subject called “national literature,” as well as to the S/subjects who have been and will be called to this process of literally production, consumption, definition, and re-definition.\n\nIn pursuit of the national category of the “Philippine” via the dis-courses of six Filipino critics, the present project seeks to contribute to the construction of a history of the subject and the many S/subjects of “Philippine-nation.”\n\nAfter a representation of the Philippine critical ground as characterized by what Isagani R. Cruz calls the phenomenon of “the other Other,” as well as re-inscription of the term in the event and eventually of “critical-in-difference.” each subsequent chapter focuses on one critic and locates his/her central trope in the dis-courses of the “nationality” of Philippine literature: Hosillos on her notion of “originality as vengeance in Philippine literature” along a concentric-comparativist framework; Lumbera on his definition of the national literature as a construct and a staging in the various stages of national assertion against colonization; Abad on his native clearing of Philippine literature, specifically, poetry in and from English; Reyes on her deconstruction and reconstruction of the “popular” room of enchantment with the modality of romance; Almario’s on his critical act c/siting of the native literary tradition as a weapon of engagement with colonial hegemony on the ground of Piedras Platas; and San Juan on his mediation of history and nation to the Filipino people in the belly of the beast.\n\nThe study sumps up the interventions of the six Filipino critics and concludes with a provisional paradigm for Philippine kritika.\n\nManaging Work Life Balance: A Study of Selected Filipino Employees within Metro Manila\n\nDr. Laurene Chua-Garcia\n\nPsychology Department\n\nThe study examined what model life balance Filipino workers employed in selected organization within Metro Manila perceived themselves as having achieved. Factors achieved to assist and hinder work life balance were also identified. Then, the perceived effects of individual and situational differences on work life balance were explored. Finally, the advantages as well as disadvantages to organizations of the achievement or non-achievement of work life balance were identified.\n\nA total of 300 respondents coming from various businesses were used for this study. First a survey was implemented then interviews were conducted. Data collected was qualitatively analyzed.\n\nThe model of work life balance identified by most of the respondents in the study was: Work life and family life are completely independent of each other. This was closely followed with the model, which states: Work life and family life are both satisfying. Work variables, particularly financial stability, were perceived as the factors that assist in the achievement of work life balance. On the other hand, the biggest hindrance to the achievement of work life balance was the absence of career development at the place of employment that included an unsatisfactory compensation and benefits package. No significant results were obtained for individual differences such as gender and educational attainment. Situational differences such as employment and family conditions validated previous researches while contributing some interesting new insights from a cultural perspective on gender roles in the household economy and childcare. Both organizational performance and organizational productivity were identified as advantages to organizations when work life balance was achieved as well as disadvantages to organizations when work life balance was not achieved.\n\nFactors Involved in the Use of Second Language Learning Strategies and Oral Proficiency Among Taiwanese Students in Taiwan and in the Philippines\n\nDr. Moises Kirk de Carvalho Filho\n\nMr. Carlo P. Magno\n\nMs. Jennifer Ann L. Lajom\n\nMs. Katrine Bunagan\n\nPsychology Department\n\nThe study investigated some factors (level of exposure to second language (L2), metacognitive awareness, and country) that may affect the use of L2 learning strategies among Taiwanese students living in Taiwan and in the Philippines who use English as a second language. The learning strategies that best predict the oral proficiency in English was also investigated. The study compared 80 Taiwanese students studying in the Philippine and 66 Taiwanese students studying in Taiwan on their metacognitive knowledge awareness, language learning strategy use, and oral proficiency. It was found in the study that English exposure and country were significant predictors of second language learning strategy. Students living and studying in the Philippines with high English exposure predicts oral proficiency that their counterparts in Taiwan. Compensation, affective, memory and metacognitive language strategies significantly predict oral proficiency (R=.58) with a fair goodness of fit (Adjusted R2=.303).\n\nAdolescent Goal Achievement in the Face of Parental Resistance\n\nMs. May Ann Garo-Santiago\n\nMs. Jan Florence Abuid\n\nPsychology Department\n\nThis study describes early and late adolescents’ power conceptions, behaviors and resources in the face of parental resistance. Data were gathered through 4 Focus Group Discussions with two groups from the early adolescent period (11-14 years old; 8 females and 8 males) and two groups from the late adolescent period (188-22 years old; 9 females and 7 males). Qualitative analysis revealed that parents disapprove of adolescents’ goals, primarily if these interfere with academics and threaten the adolescents’ safety. To achieve their intentions, early and late adolescents both use the power of self-expression, with oppositional behaviors more common in late adolescents and appeal to emotion more apparent in females. They draw resources from personal attributes, situational factors and their peers, in order to attain their goals. Early adolescents view power strivings in more negative ways while late adolescents view these as their right and indicative of competence, especially if practiced within certain limitations. The implications of these findings in family relationships, parenting and counseling practices are discussed.\n\nTingguian Funerary Practices and Beliefs: Their Value-Integration Into The Family and Community Life and Possible Implications\n\nDr. Luis C. Sembrano\n\nTheology and Religious Education Department\n\nAs an ethnographic study, but drawing on other historical and contemporary materials, identifies the elements of the upland Tingguian funerary practices and beliefs and describes how the upland Tingguians give importance to such practices, as well as how they integrate the values gained from these indigenous practices into their family and community.\n\nThe aim of the study is to reveal important information for missionaries, priests, and lay partners, who are engaged in the building of Christian communities among ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples.\n\nLikewise, in order to awaken the interest among Christians on the beauty and the values of their cultural heritage which have been handed to them for many generations by their ancestors even before the Spaniards colonized the Philippines.\n\nThe research seeks to strengthen the Tingguian’s communal identity and family values as manifested in their funerary beliefs, ritual, and practices, while also aiming to enrich the Christian funerary practices by integrating Tingguian ritual practices in their liturgy.\n\nFinally, this will also help the society to see its responsibility to enrich and strengthen the national identity through a better understanding of the culture contributed by indigenous groups.\n\nPangangatawan: Isang Paglalarawan ng ‘Spirituality’ sa Kontekstong Pilipino\n\nDr. Jose M. de Mesa\n\nTheology and Religious Education Department\n\nAng pag-unawa ay pag-unawang kontekstuwal, may lugar at may panahon. Hindi naiiba ang tinatawag sa Ingles na “spirituality” sa simulaing ito. Sa dulog kontekstuwal, inuunawa ang isang bagay sa liwanag ng mga karanasang cultural at ng Pananampalatayang Hudio-Kristiyano. Sa pangkalahatan, masasabi natin na ang “spirituality” ay tumutukoy sa pamumuhay Kristiyano. Sa akdang ito, tatangkain unawain ang pamumuhay na ito sa pamamagitan ng konsepto’t katagang “pangangatawan.” Sa ganitong dulog, matitiyak ang pakikiisa natin sa mahaba at malawak na tradisyon ng Kristiyanismo hinggil sa “spirituality” sa isang banda, at ang pagkakaugat naman natin sa ating kultura sa kabilang banda.\n\nPagkatapos ilahad ang iba’t ibang posibleng interpretasyon ng “spirituality” na matatagpuan sa mga babasahing teolohiko, ilalahad ng akda ang kahinaan na masusumpungan sa katagang “spirituality.” Sa pagsasaalang-alang sa mga nabanggit na kahinaan, imumungkahi ng sanaysay ang isang kontesktuwal na pag-unawa sa “spirituality.” Sa pananaw na ito ang kabanalan ay naiisakatuparan sa pangkaraniwang karanasan ng mga tao sa lupa. Matapos isalaysay ang ilang mga karanasan na may kinalaman sa tinatawag na “spirituality,” ipaliliwanag sa akda ang konsepto at katagang “pangangatawan” bilang natatanging kontekstuwal na pagsasalarawan ng pamumuhay Kristiyano o “spirituality.” Ang “pangangatawan” ay ayon du lamang sa pangangatawan ng Diyos sa katauhan ni Hesus, kundi sa aktibo ring pagtanaw sa pagiging tao ng mga Pilipino.\n\nChristianity and Culture in Asia\n\nDr. Jose M. de Mesa\n\nTheology and Religious Education Department\n\nAs introduction, the project first states the focus and interconnections of the topic “Christianity and Culture in Asia.” It then discusses the significance of the changed perspective on culture from a classical view to one that is empirical, and the role of language in theologizing. The framework to illustrate the various types of relationship to culture hat Asian theologies exhibit is presented and explained next.\n\nThe typology proposed by H. Richard Niebuhr is followed. Utilizing the categories of “Christ” and “Culture,” it classifies the different ways or models of interaction between the two: Christ against culture, Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox and Christ the transformer of culture. Two examples are given for each models. Cognizant of the weakness of the typology, the project has reinterpreted the models in the light of the actual examples of theologizing vis-à-vis culture in Asia. It has also taken into account the Asian theological concern regarding widespread poverty in Asia as well as the development of feminist theology in Asia.\n\nThe Chinese rites controversy and the rise of Dalit theologizing in India exemplify, in their own respective ways, the antagonistic stance of the Gospel towards culture. In the first denial of one’s culture is required to turn to the Gospel. And in the second illustration of the model, the Gospel is set against a culture that is experienced as oppressive.\n\nIn the Christ of culture model folk Catholicism in the Philippine and the “Madah Bakti” project in Indonesia particularize how culture, seen as fundamentally good and valuable, is utilized to give an inculturated expression to the Catholic faith. While the former may be characterized as a spontaneous process, the latter may be described as a deliberate effort.\n\nAlthough the basic goodness of culture is recognized by the Christ above culture model, the Gospel is regarded as perfecting the culture. Thus, in the first example the cyclical orientation of nature in Thailand is challenged by the purposeful action of God in history. In the second illustration of the model Jesuit missionary Alexander de Rhodes is described as harnessing the values of the Vietnamese culture for the sake of the Gospel.\n\nThe twin loyalties to Gospel and culture are given expression in the model Christ and culture in paradox. “I love two J’s and no third; one is Jesus, and the other is Japan,” says Uchimura Kanzo in his theology. For him loyalty to Jesus could never mean disloyalty to Japan. The Asian theology of harmony articulated by the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences also illustrates this fidelity to the Gospel, particularly its prophetic dimension, as well as to Asian values.\n\nTwo theologies of liberation are discussed in the model Christ the transformer of culture. First, the Asian feminist movement which questions the patriarchal mentality and structures both in the church and in society. Second, Aloysius Pieris proposes a uniquely Asian approach to liberation that seriously takes into account Asian poverty and religiosity in an integrated fasion.\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nDechlorination of Trichloroethylene (TCE) Using Zero-Valent Iron\n\nMs. Wilheliza A. Baraoidan\n\nChemical Engineering Department\n\nGroundwater, contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogenic cleaning solvent, is still a global environmental concern. An efficient and economical method for the remediation of the pollutant is therefore desired. Treatment of TCE by zero-valent metals has emerged a popular technology. Iron is cheap, non-toxic, readily- available and had been found to work over a wide range of chlorinated solvents.\n\nReduction of TCE using zero-valent iron is promoted by the oxidation of iron. When iron is oxidized in the presence of water, electrons are released and then transferred for the dechlorination of TCE.\n\nThe general objective of this study is to investigate on the dechlorination of TCE using zero-valent iron in powdered form, and, in the form of shav"
