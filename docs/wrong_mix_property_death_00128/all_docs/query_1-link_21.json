        "text": "Mrs Aquino had been suffering from cancer for more than a year\n\nBBC website readers have been sharing their memories of meeting former Philippines President Corazon Aquino.\n\nMrs Aquino has died at the age of 76 after suffering from colon cancer for more than a year.\n\nShe became president when the 1986 \"people power\" uprising deposed former dictator Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nRead some of your comments:\n\nIt was during my residency training in surgery at Davao Doctors Hospital where I first met and shook hands with Cory Aquino as she was campaigning for the presidency. She was real and all smiles as she gripped my hands. Then and there I knew that we will be having a president who know how to feel the pulse of the people And I was not mistaken. She became an inspiration not only to the Filipino people but to the whole world as well. We will be missing a president who left us a legacy worth emulating for generations. Thank you Cory!\n\nRaul, Butuan City, Philippines\n\nI have met her in my classmate's wedding and she was overflowing with simplicity and warmness. She had changed our nation's course of history and with that, she will be remembered forever and will remain in our hearts.\n\nJassy, Manila, Philippines\n\nI was fortunate enough to have met and shook hands with former President Aquino. She graciously granted an audience with a group of Indonesian NGO workers who at that time were also preparing for their first ever democratic elections after Suharto fell from power. I don't remember what were her exact words when she gave advise to our Indonesian colleagues but what I will remember from that meeting was that we were in awe of her. The aura that was radiating from her was that she was a person of integrity and that she was a very charismatic leader.\n\nMaria, Pampanga, Philippines\n\nMarch 1986 - I was 10 years old, and my family was visiting Thailand. We were at the Shangri-La Hotel, and I'll never forget being surprised by Corazon Aquino gliding across the lobby in a flowing yellow robe with her entourage. She had just been made President and must've been on one of her first state visits. The feeling from her presence was electric -- it was like seeing a real life hero in person. Even at 10 years old, I knew I had witnessed history.\n\nMichael, Los Angeles, USA\n\nI met Cory before she was President. Her niece lived behind me and she was washing her own car! That summed her up in my mind. She never succumbed to the trappings of wealth and power like many others did. For example she continued to live in her own home even once she was president. I will never forget the coup that brought her into power. The freedom of the people was won by hope and solidarity and not by bloodshed or corruption. This is a big loss and I only hope that one day the Philippines may be led by such a leader again.\n\nSandra, Oxford, UK\n\nYes, I had an opportunity to be introduced to Mrs Aquino in '89 at the time putschists were trying to oust her. What was so admirable was the inner calmness and serenity that radiated from her at a time when she was embattled and the coup plotters seem to be gaining ground....maybe it's the power of prayer that she believed in?\n\nSam, Metro Manila, Philippines\n\nMy first steps to Malaca√±ang palace was during her birthday when she opened the presidential residence for the public. Kudos to the mother of Philippine democracy. I consider her as a pillar of hope and patriotism...\n\nKarl, Maddela, Philippines\n\nI served in President Corazon Aquino's Cabinet from 1986 thru 1990, holding the portfolios of Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Natural Resources, & Secretary of Agriculture. I am currently a Trustee of the Ninoy Aquino Foundation which Mrs. Aquino chaired. Cory Aquino lived a principled & courageous life. She governed with integrity, grace & dignity. She treated all with respect. Cory was our nation's conscience. She will be sorely missed.\n\nCarlos, Portland Oregon, USA\n\nI had the honor of interviewing Corazon C. Aquino in March 2004. Although still THE icon of Philippine politics, she wasn't very enthusiastic about going back over the details of her political career. Cory remained a deeply apolitical figure. Leadership was thrust upon her. She inherited the charisma of her husband. Claiming only to be a simple housewife, it was her lack of political ambition and sophistication that contributed so much to her appeal to the millions of Filipinos.\n\nMark, Erlangen, Germany\n\nI was a freshman college student when I had the chance to personally meet Mrs Cory Aquino during an exhibit of the Benigno S. Aquino Jr Foundation of Ninoy's photos, works and other memorabilias. I had a chance to see her several times during her speeches in the streets after Ninoy's assassination, but it was at the exhibit I had the chance to shake her hand. She is a champion of the people. May her legacy and example always be an inspiration and of a true and sincere government servant. Salamat tita Cory.\n\nTommy, Alcala, Cagayan, Philippines\n\nI was there at EDSA during the People Power Revolution. Tita Cory, as we fondly called our late former president, still mourning for the loss of her husband, was not planning on taking the huge task of uniting the nation against Marcos. But as we clamored for her, she stood up and took the challenge, never mind that she did't have experience in government. She did all she can against a system deeply rooted in corruption and cronyism. She remains the only certifiable uncorrupt President of the Philippines.\n\nLeah, California, USA\n\nWhen I finally met Tita Cory in the flesh. I was working as Information Officer at Makati Business Club (MBC) when she was invited to speak at one of MBC's monthly breakfast meetings. I remember the aura she had when she walked in the room, everybody was just in awe. We just couldn't believe our luck when she obliged us with a photo op after her speech. I may have left my copy of the photo back in the Philippines, but the excitement and admiration for the woman, remains vividly etched in my heart.\n\nMerz, Polegate, England"
