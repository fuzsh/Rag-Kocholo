        "text": "Price deflation and the underground organ economy in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nMendoza, Roger Lee\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThis is the first in-depth study of the illicit human organ trade in the Philippines. The question for analytical investigation is why the underground organ commerce thrives, despite meager support and compensation for commercial donors (or vendors). Quantitative survey results were obtained from a probability sample of living Filipino kidney vendors (P = 0.95; Î± = 0.05). The kidney trade was studied because it has the highest level of demand among all tradeable human organs in the Philippines and globally. The study finds that deflated vendor compensation, lower than global kidney purchase prices, and relative stability in kidney supply obtain from a combination of the socio-economic characteristics of Filipino vendors and the asymmetric information available to them. The high degree of ambiguity and continuity between legitimate organ donations and underground buy-and-sell operations poses major challenges to effective regulation and law enforcement on the part of the Philippine government. Any reform effort will need to effectively address the fine distinction between two different but overlapping organ procurement markets, and brokered trading, with minimal transaction costs, based on asymmetric information. Policy lessons and insights from the Philippine experience that are transferable to other countries, particularly in the developing world, are noted in this study.\n\nCommunist Insurgency in the Philippines\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1994-06-01\n\nPhilippines, the Filipinos had practiced self-government.

L.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCharacterizations of Philippine coral diseases are very limited. The two most common, ulcerative white spot disease (UWS) and massive Porites growth anomalies (MPGA), target the genus Porites, a dominant reef-building genus. This is the first investigation in the Philippines to detect positive correlations between coral disease, nutrient levels, and organic carbon. A total of 5,843 Porites colonies were examined. Water and sediment samples were collected for analyses of nutrients (total nitrogen and phosphorus) and total organic carbon at 15 sites along a 40.5 km disease gradient, which was previously shown to positively correlate with human population levels. Results suggest that outbreaks of UWS and MPGAs are driven by elevated nutrient and organic carbon levels. Although the variables analyzed could be proxies for other causative agents (e.g., high sediment levels), the results provide quantitative evidence linking relatively higher coral disease prevalence to an anthropogenically impacted environment.\n\nGuidelines and policies on collection of biological specimens in the Philippines. Philippine Congress, International Convention on Biodiversity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadulid, D A\n\n1996-04-01\n\nIn October, 1993, 16 months after the United Nations approved the International Convention on Biodiversity held in Rio de Janeiro, June, 1992, the Philippine Congress ratified and adopted the Convention. This is a manifestation of the full support of the Philippines for the principles and policies adopted by the UN body on the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable development of biological resources and equitable sharing of benefits between users and owners of biodiversity resources. The Philippine scientific community has long recognized the need for and importance of a national guideline and policy with regard to the collection of plants and animals in the Philippines for scientific or commercial purposes. A series of consultative meetings were held by representatives of government agencies, non-government organizations, private organizations, academic and private persons concerned with biodiversity conservation to formulate national guidelines that regulate the collection of plant and animal specimens in the country. Guidelines were unanimously adopted by various government agencies and academia and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on September 28, 1990. Very recently a new document was drafted, specifically to serve as a guideline for those who desire to undertake sample collecting in the Philippines for biodiversity prospecting. The document is now being reviewed by government departments and agencies and will be presented to the President of the Philippines for signing as an Executive Order (EO). Once signed, this EO will serve as a national policy for bioprospecting in the country. The Philippines is one of the countries in Southeast Asia that has endorsed the adoption of regional guidelines on the collection of plant and animal organisms for drug development.

Between 2002 and 2008, the Philippine government, through the Department of Health, administered a program called the Philippine Organ Donation Program that allowed prospective kidney providers to sign up, be allocated to prospective recipients and receive gratuities for their kidney. Transplant tourism flourished during this period because of rampant disregard for the regulation limiting foreign recipients to 10% of total kidney transplants. There is evidence of inadequate donor care. Efforts to curb the problem included a ban on foreigners coming to the Philippines to have kidney transplants with Filipinos as donors as well as strengthening of the implementing rules and regulations of both the antihuman trafficking law and the organ donation law that allowed donation after brain death. The experience in the Philippines mirrored those in India and Pakistan where paid donors reported poor outcomes. An effective national kidney disease prevention program and the deceased donor program for transplantation should be aggressively promoted. Legislation against transplant commercialism is needed.\n\nOrgan donation in the Philippines: should the dead do more?\n\nPubMed\n\nde Castro, Leonardo D\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis paper asks whether the Philippines should focus on ways of dealing with end-stage renal disease by getting more transplantable kidneys from the dead. Would it be more ethical to put the burden to donate on the dead (who have already lost their chance to consent) than on the living (who can consent)? Given the risks involved in undergoing nephrectomy and the lack of benefits arising from the procedure to donors, the dead should be the first to put their kidneys on the line. In the Philippines, unfortunately, living donors have had to bear the greater burden in this regard. Starting with a brief account of developments surrounding the impact of the Declaration of Istanbul on the situation in the Philippines as well as in other countries, the paper examines what the living have been expected to do, what they have actually done, and what lessons the experience with living donors offers for the understanding of cadaver transplants. The paper then looks at possible ways of increasing the sources of kidneys for transplantation and asks if these ways could be implemented successfully and ethically in the Philippines.\n\nPhilippines.\n\nPubMed\n\n1983-09-01\n\nThis discussion of the Philippines focuses on the following: the people; geography; history; government; political conditions; economy (agriculture, mining, industry, and foreign trade); defense; foreign relations; and relations between the US and the Philippines. In 1982 the population was estimated at 51.6 million with an annual growth rate of 2.4%. The infant mortality rate was 59/1000 (1982), and life expectancy was 64 years (1981). The Philippine people are mostly of Malay stock, descended from the Indonesians and Malays who migrated to the islands long before the Christian era. The most significant ethnic minority group is the Chinese, who have played an important role in commerce since the 9th century, when they first came to the islands to trade. About 90% of the people are Christian. The Philippine Archipelago extends about 1770 kilometers north to south along the southeastern rim of Asia, forming a land chain between the Pacific Ocean on the east and the South China Sea on the west. The archipelago consists of some 7100 islands and islets. The history of the Philippines may be broken down into 4 distinct phases: the pre Spanish period, the Spanish period (1521-1898); the American period (1898-1946); and the years since independence (1946-present). A new constitution, to replace that of 1935, was completed by a constitutional convention in November 1972 and was proclaimed in effect in January 1973. The 1973 constitution provided for a parliamentary system, initially with extensive powers vested in a prime minister. Major amendments adopted in 1981 revised the system to make the president head of government. From independence of 1972, the Philippines practiced relatively traditional constiutional democracy. In addition to more moderate, legitimate opposition, the government has been opposed by 2 insurgencies, whose roots predated martial law, and by some urban terrorism. The Philippine economy grew rapidly during the period of rehabilitation and expansion\n\nMolecular analysis of new isolates of Tomato leaf curl Philippines virus and an associated betasatellite occurring in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Pradeep; Matsuda, N; Bajet, N B; Ikegami, M\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThree new begomovirus isolates and one betasatellite were obtained from a tomato plant exhibiting leaf curl symptom in Laguna, the Philippines. Typical begomovirus DNA components representing the three isolates (PH01, PH02 and PH03) were cloned, and their full-length sequences were determined to be 2754 to 2746 nucleotides. The genome organizations of these isolates were similar to those of other Old World monopartite begomoviruses. The sequence data indicated that PH01 and PH02 were variants of strain B of the species Tomato leaf curl Philippines virus, while PH03 was a variant of strain A of the species Tomato leaf curl Philippines virus. These isolates were designated ToLCPV-B[PH:Lag1:06], ToLCPV-B[PH:Lag2:06], and ToLCPV-A[PH:Lag3:06], respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the present isolates form a separate monophyletic cluster with indigenous begomoviruses reported earlier in the Philippines. A betasatellite isolated from same sample belongs to the betasatellite species Tomato leaf curl Philippines betasatellite and designated Tomato leaf curl Philippines betasatellite-[Philippines:Laguna1:2006], ToLCPHB-[PH:Lag1:06]. When co-inoculated with this betasatellite, tomato leaf curl Philippines virus induced severe symptoms in N. benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicum plants. Using a PVX-mediated transient assay, we found that the C4 and C2 proteins of tomato leaf curl Philippines virus and the Î²C1 protein of ToLCPHB-[PH:Lag1:06] function as a suppressor of RNA silencing.\n\nA Bibliography of Philippine Language Dictionaries and Vocabularies.

These compounds have been listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by the Stockholm Convention and are expected to disperse in the global environment even after their use and production. While the occurrence of PBDEs has been well characterized in environmental and biological samples from North America, Europe, and some Asian countries (i.e. China, Japan, and Korea), there is a scarcity of available data in developing Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Examination of PBDE contamination in the Philippine environment is particularly important because regulations have only recently been implemented on the production and use of PBDEs in this country. Additionally, the Philippines receives e-waste from Western countries, which is becoming a major source of organic contaminants in the tropical Asian regions. Ultimately, the Philippines may be a hot spot for contributing to on-going global PBDE pollution due to long-range atmospheric transport. This paper presents a review of the available literature on PBDEs in both environmental and biological samples collected from the Philippines. It is also intended to provide an overview on the levels and congener profiles of PBDEs in samples from the Philippines and to compare these data with other Asian countries. New data are presented on PBDE occurrence and congener profiles in fish commonly consumed by Filipinos and in particulate matter samples collected in Metro Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Both studies contribute to the available knowledge of PBDEs in the Philippines. We aim to stress the importance of future studies in countries receiving e-wastes, such as the Philippines, and suggest what future directions might be taken to enhance the available data on the presence of PBDEs in the Philippine environment.

It is therefore not surprising that a number of the most significant legislative initiatives approved by the Philippine legislature in the past few years have been designed to encourage these activities in particular. There are several recent, significant statutes that will affect both power and non-power projects undertaken in the Philippines.\n\nAddressing women concerns. Philippines. The Hague Forum.\n\nPubMed\n\nMedalla, F M\n\n1999-01-01\n\nSince the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the Philippine government has worked closely with nongovernmental and peoples' organizations to push reforms which promote development which is broad-based, sustainable, and focused upon human resources. These initiatives recognized the important role of population and human development, and try to achieve rapid economic growth while protecting the environment. The government worked closely with civil society to draft a medium-term development plan for 1993-98 to improve the quality of life for all Filipinos. Reproductive health will be an important component of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1999-2004. However, the necessary resources must be mobilized to carry out all elements of the program of action. Since the ICPD, total funding for reproductive health and family planning reached Philippine P 1 billion, of which 58% was provided by the foreign donor community. So far, the Philippine government has been blocked by the Catholic Church from allocating more public funds for contraception. Local government units need to take a more direct and active role in implementing rural health programs in general and reproductive health programs in particular.\n\nPhilippine Counterinsurgency during the Presidencies of Magsaysay, Marcos, and Ramos: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-06-10\n\n80 Bresnan, Crisis in the Philippines , 76-77. 81 Ibid., 77. 82 Gerardo P.

The majority of the Filipinos are descendants of Indonesians and Malays. Approximately 90% of the population are Christian with the majority of the remaining 10% being Moslems. In the 1960s, the annual population growth rate was roughly 3%, but it fell to 2.4% in the late 1970s and was still 2.4% in 1985. In 1970, President Marcos implemented an official family planning policy to reduce the high growth rate and thereby stimulate economic development. A population commission coordinates family planning efforts. Both the Spanish (1521-1898) and the United States (1898-1946) have ruled the Philippines with a brief occupation by the Japanese (1942-1945). The US assisted in the reconstruction of the economy following World War II and continues to maintain and operate military bases. Further, from 1946-1986, the Philippines has received $3.7 billion in economic and military assistance from the US. The government operated under a constitutional democracy from 1946-1972, but in 1972 President Marcos declared martial law. In 1981, martial law ended and Marcos called for a presidential election. After winning the election, he called for an amendment of the 1972 constitution making him, rather than the prime minister, the head of government. Even though martial law ended in 1981, the Marcos government retained its wide powers to arrest and detain anyone. In February 1986, popular support backed by a peaceful civilian-military uprising brought Corazon Aquino to the Presidency. In the mid 1980s a severe economic recession hit the Philippines with the real GNP growth rate ranging from -5.3%-0%.

The vision of the IYA celebration is for everyone to realize the impact of astronomy and other fundamental sciences on our daily lives, and understand how scientific knowledge can contribute to a more equitable and peaceful society. Various global projects were initiated to help achieve the goals of the IYA 2009. An opening ceremony was held last January 15 to 16, 2009 at the UNESCO Headquarters at Paris, France to mark the beginning of the IYA celebrations. Attendance for the said ceremony was by invitation only. In the Philippines, Dr. Cynthia Celebre, Chief of the Space Sciences and Astronomy Section of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, and the Single Point of Contact in the Philippines for the IYA, and I, as the student representative of the Philippines, were invited to attend the opening ceremony. We also participated in a symposium with the theme \"The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture\" which was also held at the UNESCO Headquarters at Paris, France last January 19 to 23 this year.\n\nConfidence-Building Measures in Philippine Security.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1998-05-01\n\nservice or government agency.

Deceased organ donation comprises only 20% of kidney transplantation in the Philippines in the last 3 years. Various measures were implemented to improve deceased organ donor referrals and organ retrieval. To compare outcome of deceased organ donor referrals from 2002 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012 in the Philippines. This retrospective study reviewed the deceased organ donor referrals from 2002 to 2008 and 2009 to 2012. There were 437 referrals for potential deceased organ donors from 2009 to 2012, compared to 434 referrals from 2002 to 2008. Referrals were mainly trauma victims (76%) followed by those with cerebrovascular accidents (12%). In the recent cohort, 81% were approached and 60% consented for donation, but only 23% were retrieved and transplanted. Among those not retrieved, the majority (19%) were medically unsuitable and 6% retracted their consent. Although there was an increasing trend of organ donation referrals in the last 4 years, only 25% were procured. The reasons for nonprocurement should be addressed. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With species of bats having been shown to be the cryptic reservoir of filoviruses elsewhere, the Philippine government, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, assembled a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional team to investigate Philippine bats as the possible reservoir of RESTV. The team undertook surveillance of bat populations at multiple locations during 2010 using both serology and molecular assays. A total of 464 bats from 21 species were sampled. We found both molecular and serologic evidence of RESTV infection in multiple bat species. RNA was detected with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in oropharyngeal swabs taken from Miniopterus schreibersii, with three samples yielding a product on conventional hemi-nested PCR whose sequences differed from a Philippine pig isolate by a single nucleotide. Uncorroborated qPCR detections may indicate RESTV nucleic acid in several additional bat species (M. australis, C. brachyotis and Ch. plicata). We also detected anti-RESTV antibodies in three bats (Acerodon jubatus) using both Western blot and ELISA. The findings suggest that ebolavirus infection is taxonomically widespread in Philippine bats, but the evident low prevalence and low viral load warrants expanded surveillance to elaborate the findings, and more broadly, to determine the taxonomic and geographic occurrence of ebolaviruses in bats in the region.\n\n7 CFR 319.56-58 - Bananas from the Philippines.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-01-01\n\n...; Rastrococcus invadens (Williams), the mango mealybug; and Rastrococcus spinosus (Robinson), the Philippine mango mealybug.

The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of diabetes in the Philippines and to describe extensively the characteristics of diabetes care in the Philippines from availability of diagnostics tests to the procurement of medications. A literature search was performed using the search words diabetes care and Philippines. Articles that were retrieved were reviewed for relevance and then synthesized to highlight key features. The prevalence of diabetes in the Philippines is increasing. Rapid urbanization with increasing dependence on electronic gadgets and sedentary lifestyle contribute significantly to this epidemic. Diabetes care in the Philippines is disadvantaged and challenged with respect to resources, government support, and economics. The national insurance system does not cover comprehensive diabetes care in a preventive model and private insurance companies only offer limited diabetes coverage. Thus, most patients rely on \"out-of-pocket\" expenses, namely, laboratory procedures and daily medications. Consequently, poor pharmacotherapy adherence impairs prevention of complications. Moreover, behavioral modifications are difficult due to cultural preferences for a traditional diet of refined sugar, including white rice and bread. Translating clinical data into practice in the Philippines will require fundamental and transformative changes that increase diabetes awareness, emphasize lifestyle change while respecting cultural preferences, and promote public policy especially regarding the health insurance system to improve overall diabetes care and outcomes.

Despite a slip in refined products demand in recent years, Philippines products demand will rebound sharply by 2000, East-West Center (EWC), Honolulu, predicts. Philippines planned refinery expansions are expected to meet that added demand, EWC Director Fereidun Fesharaki says. Like the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, product specifications are changing, but major refiners in the area expect to meet the changes without major case outlays. At the same time, Fesharaki says, push toward deregulation will further bolster the outlook for the Philippines downstream sector.\n\nGovernment officials' representation of nurses and migration in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasselink, Leah E; Daniel Lee, Shoou-Yih\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDuring the past few decades, the nursing workforce has been in crisis in the United States and around the world. Many health care organizations in developed countries recruit nurses from other countries to maintain acceptable staffing levels. The Philippines is the centre of a large, mostly private nursing education sector and an important supplier of nurses worldwide, despite its weak domestic health system and uneven distribution of health workers. This situation suggests a dilemma faced by developing countries that train health professionals for overseas markets: how do government officials balance competing interests in overseas health professionals' remittances and the need for well-qualified health professional workforces in domestic health systems? This study uses case studies of two recent controversies in nursing education and migration to examine how Philippine government officials represent nurses when nurse migration is the subject of debate. The study finds that Philippine government officials cast nurses as global rather than domestic providers of health care, implicating them in development more as sources of remittance income than for their potential contributions to the country's health care system. This orientation is motivated not simply by the desire for remittance revenues, but also as a way to cope with overproduction and lack of domestic opportunities for nurses in the Philippines.\n\nPhilippine Islands: a tectonic railroad siding\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGallagher, J.J. Jr.\n\n1984-09-01\n\nIn 1976, significant quantities of oil were discovered offshore northwest of Palawan Island by a Philippine-American consortium led by Philippines-Cities Service Inc. This was the first commercial oil found in the Philippine Islands. Other exploration companies had decided that there was no commercial oil in the Philippines. They fell prey to a situation Wallace E. Pratt, who began his career in 1909 in the Philippines, later described: There are many instances where our knowledge, supported in some cases by elaborate and detailed studies has convinced us that no petroleum resources were present in areas which subsequently became sites of importantmoreÂ Â» oil fields. Some explorers are blinded by the negative implications of the same knowledge that successful explorers use to find important oil fields. The Palawan discoveries are examples of successful use of knowledge. Recognition that the Philippine Islands are a tectonic railroad siding may be the key to future exploration success. These islands are continental fragments, each with its own individual geologic characteristics, that have moved from elsewhere to their present positions along a major strike-slip zone. Play concepts can be developed in the Philippines for continental fragments in each of the three major present-day tectono-stratigraphic systems that are dominated by strike-slip, but include subduction and extension tectonics, with both carbonate and clastic sediments.Â«Â less\n\nAddressing the tobacco epidemic in the Philippines: progress since ratification of the WHO FCTC\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAntonio, M.; Limpin, M.; Alzona, L.; Trinidad, F.; Dorotheo, U.; Yapchiongco, R.; Garcia, R.; Anden, A.; Alday, J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, and is estimated to kill more than 5 million persons each year worldwide. Tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke pose a major public health problem in the Philippines. Effective tobacco control policies are enshrined in the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a legally binding international treaty that was ratified by the Philippines in 2005. Since 2007, Bloomberg Philanthropies has supported the accelerated reduction of tobacco use in many countries, including the Philippines. Progress in the Philippines is discussed with particular emphasis on the period since ratification of the WHO FCTC, and with particular focus on the grants programme funded by the Bloomberg Initiative. Despite considerable progress, significant challenges are identified that must be addressed in future if the social, health and economic burden from the tobacco epidemic is to be alleviated.

A new national health insurance program began to be implemented in the Philippines in 1995 after passage of the Health Insurance Act. The program is known as the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). HTA was introduced to the Philippines in 1998. PhilHealth began to develop an HTA program subsequently. As a developing country struggling to provide comprehensive health care to all citizens, PhilHealth sees HTA as an essential part of assuring that only effective and cost-effective care is provided for the public sector.\n\nRestructuring of labor markets in the Philippines and Zambia: the gender dimension.\n\nPubMed\n\nFloro, M S; Schaefer, K\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis paper critically examines labor market changes accompanying the process of structural adjustment in the Philippines and Zambia and, in particular, the resulting impact on women's economic participation. The changes in the labor market occurring during the process of economic restructuring in Zambia and the Philippines are similar in some respects but very different in others. Zambia's economic performance has not been sufficient to generate wide-based employment and has been characterized by rising unemployment. The Philippines has also unfortunately been characterized by a growth in joblessness, specifically with regard to skilled and semiskilled employment. Global integration of labor markets in the Philippines give some employment opportunity to workers who are willing to seek jobs overseas but not to those in Zambia. Both in the Philippines and Zambia, the informal sector has shifted its agricultural reforms to female labor toward agricultural wage work (which is seasonal and low paid). In the Philippines, specifically in urban areas, certain export-oriented industries have created some jobs, predominantly for young women, but only a small proportion of total females are employed. Much of the female job growth has occurred in sales and service sectors, including sex work, domestic service, and petty trade. International labor migration in the Philippines has become more feminized, because a majority of overseas contract workers are women, who are employed in the service sector as entertainers and domestic helpers. Access to paid work in some cases may empower women, yet in other cases their power may be diminished. Both the specific character of labor market development and the nature of the accompanying economic reform alter the ability of the women and men to take advantage of the opportunity. Reform shifts patterns of production organization and location of employment and can either reinforce the prevailing distribution of power or provide tension\n\nBilharzia in the Philippines: past, present, and future.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlveda, David U; Li, Yuesheng; Olveda, Remigio M; Lam, Alfred K; McManus, Donald P; Chau, Thao N P; Harn, Donald A; Williams, Gail M; Gray, Darren J; Ross, Allen G P\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSchistosomiasis japonica has a long history in the Philippines. In 1975, 24 endemic provinces were identified in the northern, central, and southern islands of the Philippines. More than five million people were at risk, with approximately one million infected. In 2003, new foci of infection were found in two provinces in the north and central areas. For the past 30 years, human mass drug administration (MDA), utilizing the drug praziquantel, has been the mainstay of control in the country. Recent studies have shown that the schistosomiasis prevalence ranges from 1% to 50% within different endemic zones. Severe end-organ morbidity is still present in many endemic areas, particularly in remote villages with poor treatment coverage. Moreover, subtle morbidities such as growth retardation, malnutrition, anemia, and poor cognitive function in infected children persist. There is now strong evidence that large mammals (e.g. water buffaloes, cattle) contribute significantly to disease transmission, complicating control efforts. Given the zoonotic nature of schistosomiasis in the Philippines, it is evident that the incidence, prevalence, and morbidity of the disease will not be controlled by MDA alone. There is a need for innovative cost-effective strategies to control schistosomiasis in the long term. Copyright Â© 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

With better understanding of the physiology of the open chest and refinements in thoracic anesthetic and surgical approaches, Filipino surgeons began performing thoracoplasties, then lung resections for pulmonary tuberculosis and later for lung cancer in specialty hospitals dealing with pulmonary diseasesâfirst at the Quezon Institute (QI) and presently at the Lung Center of the Philippines although some university and private hospitals made occasional forays into the chest. Esophageal surgery began its early attempts during the post-World War II era at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), a university hospital affiliated with the University of the Philippines. With the introduction of minimally invasive thoracic surgical approaches, Filipino thoracic surgeons have managed to keep up with their Asian counterparts although the problems of financial reimbursement typical of a developing country remain. The need for creative innovative approaches of a focused multidisciplinary team will advance the boundaries of thoracic surgery in the Philippines.

Redtide is a marine phenomenon that poses great risk to the health and economic livelihood of people in coastal areas. Paralytic shellfish poisoning develops when a person consumes molluscs containing toxic dinoflagellates and suffers neurological and/or gastrointestinal manifestations. 2. Four redtide incidents in the Philippines are presented. The manner in which the problems were managed are described. 3. The clinical features of redtide poisoning in the Philippines included gastro-intestinal and neurological features with deaths secondary to ventilatory failure. Mortality ranged from 0% to 12% in the different redtide episodes. 4. There are many lessons to be learned in handling this kind of natural disaster. For an effective toxicovigilance programme, there must be a central co-ordinating responsible organization, a clear definition of roles and functions and good inter-agency co-operation. Appropriate surveillance procedures, resources to intensify surveillance at times of risks, prompt warning system, and the ability to impose bans on consumption are also necessary. 5. Poisons centres can play an important role during times of redtide. This may include toxicovigilant activities, such as early warning and educational campaigns to consumers, and seminars in the recognition and management of paralytic shellfish poisoning. 6. The contribution of the epidemiologists in investigating and monitoring the extent of public health damage and patterns of poisoning in a coastal community is emphasized.\n\nTreatment gaps in Parkinson's disease care in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nJamora, Roland Dominic G; Miyasaki, Janis M\n\n2017-08-01\n\nNeurological services and resources are scarce in low-income and developing countries, such as the Philippines. We looked into the treatment gaps in Parkinson's disease (PD) care in the Philippines in the following areas: epidemiology, healthcare, financial coverage, pharmacotherapy, surgical treatment and manpower. We collected relevant data on the above-mentioned areas. There is no available Philippine data on PD prevalence. Philippine healthcare is paid through user fees at the point of service. The average consultation fee in Manila ranges from US$10.57-31.74. The average minimum daily wage is US$9.39-10.17. Philippine healthcare is devolved to the local government units. Deep brain stimulation surgery is only available in Manila. Most PD medications are available in the Philippines. There are only nine movement disorder specialists for a population of 100.98 million. Gaps and challenges in PD care in the Philippines still exist.\n\nEffect of the Civil-Military Relationship on the Philippine-American War\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-08-04\n\nNUMBER 7.

Alcorn last month completed its third high flowing delineation well in the West Linapacan area off Palawan Island. Development of West Linapacan field will help boost lagging Philippines oil production, which fell 31% in 1991 from 1990 levels. Philippines Office of Energy Affairs (OEA) also outlined other aspects of the country's oil and gas activity in 1991. Recent drilling successes have redirected the country's focus north to the West Linapacan area from older Northwest Palawan oil fields. Meantime, two geophysical surveymoreÂ Â» and exploration contracts (GSECs) were awarded in 1991, and two service contracts (SCs) were relinquished during the year. Several seismic program were completed last year, and in agreement between Australia and Philippines will yield added seismic data during the next 3 years.Â«Â less\n\nPhilippine Insurgencies and the U.S. Response\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-02-12\n\nvestiges of Philippine society .

The dynamics in these lakes are different from those in the bigger lakes. This study was conducted to determine the organic pollutants and their sources in three of the seven lakes of San Pablo City in Laguna, Philippines: lakes Palakpakin, Sampaloc, and Pandin. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used in the targeted and non-targeted analysis of the lake water samples. The three lakes are all volcanic crater lakes but are exposed to different anthropogenic activities, which includes domestic activities, livelihood (farming and aquaculture) and eco-tourism. Due to the presence of rice fields and fruit plantations, chlorpyrifos was detected in the three lakes while other pesticides like cypermethrin, picolinafen and quinoxyfen were additionally found in Lake Sampaloc, which is the biggest of the three lakes and located within the urbanized section of the city. Traces of different surfactants (linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, secondary alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates), biocide benzalkonium chloride, insect repellent diethyltoluamide, antibiotics (sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole), hypertension drug telmisartan, phosphate-based fire retardants, and artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, cyclamate, saccharin and sucralose) were detected in lakes Sampaloc and Palakpakin. The same surfactants, artificial sweeteners, insect repellant and phosphate-based fire retardants were also found in Lake Pandin, which is mainly used for eco-tourism activities like swimming and boating. The results of this study suggest that the organic pollutants present in the small lakes can be linked to the various human activities in the immediate lake environment. Because small lakes are more prone to environmental stresses, human activities in the said lakes must be regulated to ensure sustainable\n\n38 CFR 3.41 - Philippine service.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 38 Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief 1 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Philippine service. 3.41 Section 3.41 Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ADJUDICATION Pension, Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation General Â§ 3.41 Philippine service.

Comparisons among S. japonicum from the Philippines, Japan, and China revealed a geographically based length difference in mt genomes, but the mt genomic organization and gene arrangement were the same. Sequence differences among samples from the Philippines and all samples from the three endemic areas were 0.57-2.12 and 0.76-3.85Â %, respectively. The most variable part of the mt genome was the non-coding region. In the coding portion of the genome, protein-coding genes varied more than rRNA genes and tRNAs. The near-complete mt genome sequences for Philippine specimens were identical in length (14,091Â bp) which was 4Â bp longer than those of S. japonicum samples from Japan and China. This indel provides a unique genetic marker for S. japonicum samples from the Philippines. Phylogenetic analyses based on the concatenated amino acids of 12 protein-coding genes showed that samples of S. japonicum clustered according to their geographical origins. The identified mitochondrial indel marker will be useful for tracing the source of S. japonicum infection in humans and animals in Southeast Asia.\n\n7 CFR 319.56-33 - Mangoes from the Philippines.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n... 7 Agriculture 5 2011-01-01 2011-01-01 false Mangoes from the Philippines. 319.56-33 Section 319.56...

However, most plant species on this archipelago have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. The main aim of this study is to unravel the evolutionary history and biogeographic relationships of the Philippine members of the pantropical genus Ixora. The complex plastid and nuclear divergence patterns in Philippine Ixora, documented using tree and network approaches, reveal a highly dynamic evolution in Ixora, involving several phases of radiation and recolonization. Philippine Ixora comprises at least five lineages, of which one is most closely related to species from Wallacea, and the remaining four to species from Asia. Our study highlights the importance of Philippine species for understanding phytogeographic patterns in the Indomalayan-Australasian eco-region. The overall genetic differentiation, as well as the incongruence between genealogies based on the biparentally inherited nucleome and the maternally inherited plastome in Ixora, reflect the complex tectonic history of the Philippine archipelago. The Ixora lineage related to Wallacean species supports the delimitation of different ecozones along Huxley's line, because it is absent from Palawan. The remaining four lineages are all allied with Asian taxa, reflecting several waves of colonization. Close relationships between some widespread Philippine species and locally adapted narrow endemics suggest that the widespread, genetically diverse species act as pools for the formation of new species in a process of ongoing speciation. Our results suggest that the species concepts of some of the more widespread taxa need to be revised.\n\nParticipatory research with indigenous communities in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahinay, A\n\n1995-06-01\n\nOxfam encourages its partners to integrate gender issues into their work. Accordingly, the organization drew a team of six researchers from local partners to conduct a gender-needs assessment in Arakan Valley, North Cotabo, on the island of Mindanao, Philippines. There are five million indigenous people in the Philippines belonging to more than forty different tribal groups. They are oppressed and exploited by foreign and local elites, with many having lost their ancestral lands to agribusiness plantations, ranches, mining and logging concessions of multinational corporations, and government projects. Focus group discussions, participant observation, key informant feedback, and case studies conducted over a twelve-month period found the existence of physical violence between husbands and wives; men typically having two-three wives, with women pressuring men to take more wives so that there will be more labor for farming and housework; incest is taboo, but it is not unusual for sisters to be married to one man; and women's labor responsibilities relative to men's have increased. Study results are being shared with participants in the local language.\n\nStudy Shows Philippine Power System Can Achieve 30% and 50% Renewable\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nEnergy by 2030 | News | NREL Study Shows Philippine Power System Can Achieve 30% and 50 % Renewable Energy by 2030 Study Shows Philippine Power System Can Achieve 30% and 50% Renewable Energy by of the Philippines (NGCP), and the Philippine Electricity Market Association produced the study\n\nHospital preparedness for Ebola virus disease: a training course in the Philippines\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCarlos, Celia; Capistrano, Rowena; Tobora, Charissa Fay; delos Reyes, Mari Rose; Lupisan, Socorro; Corpuz, Aura; Aumentado, Charito; Suy, Lyndon Lee; Hall, Julie; Donald, Julian; Counahan, Megan; Curless, Melanie S; Rhymer, Wendy; Gavin, Melanie; Lynch, Chelsea; Black, Meredith A; Anduyon, Albert D; Buttner, Petra\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective To develop, teach and evaluate a training workshop that could rapidly prepare large numbers of health professionals working in hospitals in the Philippines to detect and safely manage Ebola virus disease (EVD). The strategy was to train teams (each usually with five members) of key health professionals from public, private and local government hospitals across the Philippines who could then guide Ebola preparedness in their hospitals. Methods The workshop was developed collaboratively by the Philippine Department of Health and the country office of the World Health Organization. It was evaluated using a pre- and post-workshop test and two evaluation forms. Ï2 tests and linear regression analyses were conducted comparing pre- and post-workshop test results. Results A three-day workshop was developed and used to train 364 doctors, nurses and medical technologists from 78 hospitals across the Philippines in three initial batches. Knowledge about EVD increased significantly (PÂ <Â 0.009) although knowledge on transmission remained suboptimal. Confidence in managing EVD increased significantly (PÂ =Â 0.018) with 96% of participants feeling more prepared to safely manage EVD cases. Discussion: The three-day workshop to prepare hospital staff for EVD was effective at increasing the level of knowledge about EVD and the level of confidence in managing EVD safely. This workshop could be adapted for use as baseline training in EVD in other developing countries to prepare large numbers of hospital staff to rapidly detect, isolate and safely manage EVD cases.

Philippine National Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation initiated the first semi-commercial generation of geothermal power in July 1977 with the installation of a 3MWe plant. By 1980 the country had 440 MWe on line at Mak-Ban and Tiwi. This placed the Philippines second after the US among countries using geothermal energy for power generation. Before the end of 1981, PNOC-EDC added 6 additional MWe of geothermal power generating capacity to increase the total to 446 MWe. As part of the five-year National Energy Development Programme covering the period 1981-1985,moreÂ Â» additional power plants will be installed in various project areas to increase the share of geothermal power generation from the present 9.8% to 18.6% of the nationwide power-generation total, or the equivalent of 16.6 million barrels of oil per year.

In the WPR, the Philippines set a national goal in 1998 to eliminate measles by 2008. This report describes progress toward measles elimination in the Philippines during 1998-2014 and challenges remaining to achieve the goal. WHO-United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-estimated coverage with the routine first dose of MCV (MCV1) increased from 80% in 1998 to 90% in 2013, and coverage with the routine second dose of MCV (MCV2) increased from 10% after nationwide introduction in 2010 to 53% in 2013. After nationwide SIAs in 1998 and 2004, historic lows in the numbers and incidence of reported measles cases occurred in 2006. Despite nationwide SIAs in 2007 and 2011, the number of reported cases and incidence generally increased during 2007-2012, and large measles outbreaks occurred during 2013-2014 that affected infants, young children, older children, and young adults and that were prolonged by delayed and geographically limited outbreak response immunization activities during 2013-2014. For the goal of measles elimination in WPR to be achieved, sustained investments are required in the Philippines to strengthen health systems, implement the recommended elimination strategies, and develop additional strategies to identify and reduce measles susceptibility in specific geographic areas and older age groups.\n\nUrban Astronomy in the Philippines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorres, Jesus Rodrigo F.\n\nAstronomy in the Philippines is among the most interesting fields of study according to Filipino students. The science, however, suffers from neglect because most Philippine institutions of higher learning have campuses in urban areas. Common understanding dictates that satisfactory astronomical observations and studies can only be done at dark sites away from urban lights. This study aims to prove that astronomical work can be done even in light-polluted urban settings, and to convince educational policymakers to consider establishing observatories in urban campuses and to offer astronomy as a subject or major.\n\nSerious fungal infections in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nBatac, M C R; Denning, D\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe Philippines is a low middle-income, tropical country in Southeast Asia. Infectious diseases remain the main causes of morbidity, including tuberculosis. AIDS/HIV prevalence is still low at <1%, but is rapidly increasing. Fungal disease surveillance has not been done, and its burden has never been estimated. This becomes more important as the population of immunocompromised patients increases, drawn from patients with AIDS, TB, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases requiring chronic steroid use. Using the methodology of the LIFE program ( www.LIFE-worldwide.org ), estimates were derived from data gathered from WHO, UNAIDS, Philippine Health Statistics 2011, Philippine Dermatological Society Health Information System database, HIV/AIDS and ART registry of the Philippines, epidemiological studies such as The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database 2005, and personal communication. Aspergillosis and candidiasis were the top causes of fungal infections in the Philippines. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), drawn from the number of tuberculosis patients, affects 77,172 people. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) frequencies, which were derived from the number of asthmatic patients, affect 121,113 and 159,869 respectively. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects 1,481,899 women. Other estimates were cryptococcal meningitis 84, Pneumocystis pneumonia 391, oral candidiasis 3,467, esophageal candidiasis 1,522 (all in HIV-infected people), invasive aspergillosis (IA) 3,085, candidemia 1,968, candida peritonitis 246, mucormycosis 20, fungal keratitis 358, tinea capitis 846 and mycetoma 97 annually. A total of 1,852,137 (1.9% of population) are afflicted with a serious fungal infection. Epidemiological studies are needed to validate these estimates, facilitating appropriate medical care of patients and proper prioritization of limited resources.\n\nPatterns of Internet Usage in the Philippines\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLabucay, Iremae D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis chapter reports on the patterns of Internet use in the Philippines using survey data gathered by Social Weather Stations (SWS), a social research institute in the Philippines.

In the wake of the main shock, sensors detected a flurry of aftershocks, counting 110 in total. Drawing on seismic wave observations and rupture mechanisms calculated for the aftershocks, Ye et al. found that many were located near the epicenter of the main intraplate quake but at shallower depth; all involved normal faulting. Some shallow thrusting aftershocks were located farther to the west, centered within the potentially dangerous megathrust fault formed by the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Philippine microplate, the piece of crust housing the Philippine Islands.\n\nPublic higher education in the Philippines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCardozier, V. R.\n\n1984-06-01\n\nClearly, the national government of the Philippines has decided to increase the number and comprehensiveness of its public colleges and universities. While private colleges and universities are likely to dominate higher education in the Philippines for the remainer of this century, it appears that public, tax-supported higher education will become increasingly available there. The Philippines is not a wealthy country but it is devoting a substantial portion of its national resources to public higher education. In 1983, higher education received 2.85 percent of the national budget, a figure that has been rising for years. Compared with some highly developed countries, this is not a large percentage, but for a country that has traditionally relied on private higher education, it is a major and growing investment in the public sector. While many of the better universities in the Philippines are private, many other private educational institutions are small and struggling. As their financial resources become more limited, and as less expensive, tax-supported higher education becomes increasingly available, a lot of the struggling private colleges will probably close. This process is also being hastened by actions of the government to upgrade quality, for example in the case of the many private colleges that developed after World War II. In an attempt to improve the academic quality of these marginal institutions, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports has been given extensive authority, and while its intrusion into private institutions has been modest by some measures, its requirements are affecting them all and will speed the demise of some. This is bound to lead to a stronger role for public higher education in the Philippines, a country that is striving diligently to improve the education and hence the quality of life of its people.\n\nCollaborative approaches using traditional and nontraditional providers of women's health care in the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nRecio, D M\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThis discussion of collaborative approaches using traditional and nontraditional providers of women's health care in the Philippines identifies common health problems in the Philippines, discusses solutions and strategies adopted by government and nongovernment providers of women's health care, and details the strategies adopted in the Philippines. The traditional providers are the traditional birth attendants, the folk healers, herbalists, faith healers, and the so-called witches and sorcerers, which are not treated in a derogatory manner in the Philippines. This paper deals only with the traditional birth attendants who are women and whose work deals with women's health concerns. The nontraditional type of health care providers, some of whom are nonprofessionals, include those who have been recruited by government and nongovernment organizations. This paper deals only with the nonprofessional health care providers. 2 major types of health problems in the Philippines are discussed. The first of these is the rapid population growth and its ramifications, including growing demands for food, education employment, health services, and shelter. This further indicates that there will be a larger number of undernourished children, a larger number of poor families and so on. Additionally, there are 295 cases of illness per 1000 persons, of which 68% are acute illness, 27% chronic, and 5% disabilities and accidents. The 2nd type of health problem is only health related, i.e., the inequitable distribution of health resources and health personnel. The recruitment of lay health workers was the solution adopted to ease the inequity in distribution of human health resources. Providers of health care in the Philippines generally are recruited to help solve specific health problems of maternal and child care, including family planning, malnutrition, general morbidity, and dispersal of medicines. In the process they help ease the inequitable distribution of health services.

The event was lead by the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Health, and saw the participation of national and international experts in DRR, and numerous research consortia from all over the Philippines. With a central focus on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the DRR related events recognised the significant disaster risks faced in the Philippines. They also illustrated the Philippine strengths and experience in DRR. Key innovations in science and technology showcased at the conference include the web-base hazard mapping applications 'Project NOAH' and 'FaultFinder'. Other notable innovations include 'Surveillance in Post Extreme Emergencies and Disasters' (SPEED) which monitors potential outbreaks through a syndromic reporting system. Three areas noted for further development in DRR science and technology included: integrated national hazard assessment, strengthened collaboration, and improved documentation. Finally, the event saw the proposal to develop the Philippines into a global hub for DRR. The combination of the risk profile of the Philippines, established national structures and experience in DRR, as well as scientific and technological innovation in this field are potential factors that could position the Philippines as a future global leader in DRR. The purpose of this article is to formally document the key messages of the DRR-related events of the PNHRS Week Celebration.\n\nThe Philippines: country statement prepared for the International Conference on Population, Mexico City, August 1984.\n\nPubMed\n\n1985-03-01\n\nThis statement, prepared for the 1984 International Conference on Population, summarizes the demographic situation in the Philippines, the Philippine position regarding implementation of the World Population Plan of Action, and current population policies. In 1980, the population of the Philippines stood at 48.1 million. The country's current population growth rate reflects the interplay between decreasing mortality and still high but declining fertility. The 1984-87 Philippine Development Plan aims to achieve sustainable economic growth, equitable distribution of the gains of development, and personal development. A net reproduction rate of unity by the year 2000 is sought, and preschool-age children, youth, premarriage-age groups, and married couples of reproductive age have been targeted for special outreach efforts. The national population program will concentrate on developing a network of public and private community-based organizations, strengthening the capacity of local government and community organizations to plan and manage the population program, developing community capacity to finance family planning services, upgrading the quality of natural family planning practice, continuing the promotion of effective contraceptive methods, developing a population data bank, and upgrading the technical and management capabilities of population program personnel. Increasing attention is being paid to regional development and spatial distribution. The average annual population growth rate is expected to decline from 2.8% in 1970-75 to 2.2% by 1987. The crude birth rate is expected to drop from 34/1000 in 1980 to 31/1000 in 1987. To help achieve this goal, the contraceptive prevalence rate should increase from 34% in 1983 to 41% in 1987 and 50% by 1993. In addition, attempts will be made to reduce the proportion of women marrying below the age of 20 years and to improve women's access to educational and employment opportunities.\n\nTodaro migration and primacy models: relevance to the urbanization of the Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\nCuervo, J C; Kim Hin, D H\n\n1998-08-01\n\n\"This paper looks into the set of factors that [influence] the urbanization of the Philippines, a fast-growing developing economy in South East Asia.

International / Philippines.\n\nPubMed\n\n1995-07-24\n\nAnti-abortionists in the Philippines have generated widespread fears in the country that tetanus toxoid used in the anti-tetanus vaccine campaign contains trace amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to induce abortion. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that this widespread, unfounded fear has already resulted in a 45% drop in tetanus toxoid coverage during national immunization days in 1995 compared to 1994. Since up to 5 million women were not immunized in 1995, 300-400 more babies will contract tetanus and die in the year to come. Pro-life Philippines is ostensibly the creator and supporter of these newly-generated fears about tetanus toxoid. The mass hysteria is, however, most likely part of a church-led campaign against the government's population policies and the popularity of former Health Secretary Juan Flavier. Millions of Filipino women have for years received anti-tetanus vaccines to prevent tetanus in both mothers and their newborn children. Tetanus remains a problem for newborns in the Philippines where local midwives often use unsanitary knives to sever the umbilical cord at birth. Since the immunization drive was stepped up in 1990, the number of babies affected by tetanus has fallen from more than 25 per day in the mid-1980s to four currently. The vaccine currently supplied by UNICEF has been used for more than 50 years in many countries and is one of the basics in immunization. The Department of Health notes no unusual increase in abortions since 1990, the year the anti-tetanus drive was accelerated. Prior to 1990, anti-tetanus vaccination had been going on in the Philippines since 1983. Even WHO assurances that tetanus toxoid contains no abortifacients have failed to allay public fear. It is unfortunate that the people and groups behind this misinformation campaign have done so much damage to a decidedly beneficial and needed health program.\n\nMolecular Characterization of Chikungunya Virus, Philippines, 2011-2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nSy, Ava Kristy; Saito-Obata, Mariko; Medado, Inez Andrea; Tohma, Kentaro; Dapat, Clyde; Segubre-Mercado, Edelwisa; Tandoc, Amado; Lupisan, Socorro; Oshitani, Hitoshi\n\n2016-05-01\n\nDuring 2011-2013, a nationwide outbreak of chikungunya virus infection occurred in the Philippines.

Three areas noted for further development in DRR science and technology included: integrated national hazard assessment, strengthened collaboration, and improved documentation. Finally, the event saw the proposal to develop the Philippines into a global hub for DRR. The combination of the risk profile of the Philippines, established national structures and experience in DRR, as well as scientific and technological innovation in this field are potential factors that could position the Philippines as a future global leader in DRR. The purpose of this article is to formally document the key messages of the DRR-related events of the PNHRS Week Celebration.

The last status change was based on a study of the species' population density, which suggested that a single natural catastrophe could potentially wipe out the Philippine tarsier. In 2013 typhoon Haiyan hit Bohol, one of the island strongholds for this species. In this study we compare the density of the Bohol tarsier population within the Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary before and after the typhoon. We demonstrate that the typhoon significantly affected the density of the Philippine tarsier in the sanctuary. Before the typhoon, tarsier density was approximately 157 individuals/km2 whereas after the typhoon the density was a mere 36 individuals/km2. Prior to the typhoon, more Philippine tarsiers were found in older secondary forest than in younger secondary forest, whereas after the typhoon all observed individuals were found in relat"
