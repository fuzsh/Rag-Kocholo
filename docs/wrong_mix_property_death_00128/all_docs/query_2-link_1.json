Lorenzo-Molo Received: 13 October 2011 / Accepted: 8 August 2012 / Published online: 5 September 2012 � Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract This article makes the case for servant leadership as a model for business in its analysis of the leadership style of former Philippine president, Corazon C. Aquino. Premised on the idea that self-management requires deep spirituality lived integrally (and sustained by an interior or inner life), we identify specific traits and virtues of Aquino and their impli- cations on her leadership and effect on people. The article begins with an introduction to establish the contribution of servant leadership on business. It continues with a summary of key points in servant leadership literature. Then, we analyze Aquino as a person and leader and find that the former spilled\n\n2. over to the latter. We conclude by providing a model based on Aquino’s journey into the role of servant leader; thus, pre- senting a framework that charts the path toward servant lead- ership to help businesses address the leadership crisis brought on by an Enron-WorldCom-Tyco dominated business culture. Keywords Servant leader � Virtue � Philippines � Corazon Aquino Introduction An icon is an enduring symbol. It is one who becomes the object of great attention and devotion and thus, also becomes an idol. But how does one receive such a superlative and herculean status? If rock stars and movie and TV personalities were to become our benchmark, then erratic, odd, and uncontrollable behavior either do not matter or possibly even catapult one to the level of icon. But this is only because the term ‘‘icon’’ has been used loosely. The difference between such ‘‘icons’’ and the kind of ‘‘icon’’ we wish to tackle in this article is like the difference between popular culture or any cul-\n\n3. tural product and the classics. It is also similar to the difference between a celebrity and an artist, a salesman and an entrepreneur, a manager and a leader, or a charismatic leader and a servant leader. Management books cite Mother Teresa as a servant leader par excel- lence who selflessly sought the well-being of others (Howell and Costley 2006). Way above all human exemplars of servant leaders is Jesus Christ who founded Christianity and lived his life serving mankind and offering his life for them (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002). Like the classics, these icons of leadership have stood the test of time. In this article, we offer one such icon, who serves a unique utility to the current state and image of business leadership today—hounded by scandals, which has frus- trated its audiences, market, and clients. Business has been viewed as an Enron-WorldCom-Tyco world suffering from crises of leadership and ethics (Arjoon 2000). With the\n\n4. world financial crisis and high profile cases of wrongdoing fresh in people’s minds, a view that directly connects ethical leadership to greatness will certainly be appealing to an Enron-WorldCom-Tyco business world desperate for a change—but a practical one that will appease business’s natural hunger for greatness. Business needs a real success story with a rationale and framework to explain how one can emulate real success. Z. A. S.

DOI 10.1007/s10551-012-1449-5 Former Philippine president, Corazon (‘‘Cory’’) Co- juangco Aquino is a unique and atypical example; business leaders can truly learn from her as she (a plain housewife) was able to successfully rally people in quite a revolu- tionary way (through people power) to put an end to a 20-year dictatorship. This called the world’s attention to a tiny country and its atypical and unusual leader who gave the world an idea that would normally sound like a romanticized concept; but it is a real piece of history that has (as other nations came out with their own versions of people power) and can serve as a model for generations to come well beyond the realm of government and politics. Like the Aquino phenomenon, servant leadership is unique and useful; and we have chosen it as the rationale and framework to better understand Aquino’s success. Klamon (2007, p. 109) declared, ‘‘What renders servant-\n\n6. leadership distinct from other leadership models yet akin to social entrepreneurship is the ethical motivation that inspires individuals to act.’’ Through the idea of servant leadership and Aquino, we believe business leaders will have both an ideal and realistic model to encourage them in the struggle to develop an ethical and successful business enterprise. Aristotle believed that ‘‘ethics is the art of living well’’ (Hartman 2007, p. 314) and we think Aquino lived well enough as a servant leader to be a real model of good and ethical leadership. Our case is especially relevant to the area of self management, as Aquino illustrates the crucial significance of a deep personal spirituality lived integrally (and sustained by an interior or inner life), which is man- ifested in virtues such as simplicity, sincerity, and a gen- uine concern for people. Aquino’s character kept her from corruption, which has tainted the reputation of politicians and businessmen in recent years. Lee and Oh (2007) defined corruption as ‘‘the abuse or misuse of positions or\n\n7. resources of public officials for private gains usually in the form of bribery’’ (p. 99). Asian governments have been known to be corrupt and the Philippine government is no exception (Lee and Oh 2007). In this study, however, it was a consensus that Aquino certainly was not. It is a view that is also popularly held based on anecdotal evidence and comments of everyday and ordinary people within and beyond the Philippine archipelago. One of the contentions of this paper is that Aquino’s character helped her ward off one of the trappings of power, which in this case is cor- ruption. Moore and Beadle (2006) opined that courage (one of Aquino’s virtues) is required to resist the corrupting power of institutions and its environment. Thus, people trusted her. Truthfulness (which flows from Aquino’s integrity and thus, authenticity) enabled trust—a quality, which Solomon (2004) believed to be that ‘‘‘glue’, the basic ‘medium’ of a successful business enterprise’’ (p. 1035). Through Aquino, business leaders will be able to\n\n8. see specific qualities they need and at the same time be given a rationale to illustrate just how important ethical leadership is via something very tangible and real—Aqui- no’s success and elevation to icon. We are offering something fresh because it presents an atypical model for business leaders both in terms of theory (through the concept of servant leadership) and application (through, once again, another atypical example in the person of Aquino). An article directly tackling the issue of ethics premised on a view of leadership that is contrary to the popular norm and based on an equally unique model, should spark an interesting discussion that can give birth to further theories and inspire even more potential case studies and leadership icons that can give justice to the concept. Aquino and Servant Leadership: The Success Story The success of servant leadership (SL) (as a concept) and Aquino lies in their testability through time and across\n\n9. audiences and contexts. A servant leader exists to serve and lead others through his selfless service (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002; Hunter 2004; Sipe and Frick 2009). It is a concept that is thousands of years old, as it has been a major theme in the Judeo-Christian tradition from the weeping Joseph embracing his brothers to Jesus washing the feet of His disciples (Finch 2007); as well as in Islam, Zen and Taoism (Vanourek in Finch 2007). In the Gospel of John (Chapter 13), Jesus demonstrated what servant leadership is by washing the feet of His disciples (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002)—an act regarded as one of the most demeaning tasks (Ford in Sendjaya and Sarros 2002), performed by a host’s servant or the lowest-ranking guest in ancient Palestine. Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) also traced SL’s presence in history well outside the realm of reli- gion—from ancient monarchs, to inaugurations of heads of state to politicians, who define their role in terms of public service. Even business, through its marketing arm and the\n\n10. concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and cus- tomer-centricity, all forward a kind of leader as servant concept. Rennaker and Novak (2007, p. 314) opined, ‘‘The follower orientation of servant-leadership might reflect a cultural pattern consistent with consumer orientation.’’ But as Patterson (in Rennaker and Novak 2007, p. 316) indi- cated, ‘‘social responsibility does not necessarily require a leader to put the interests of the follower above his or her own.’’ Certainly, more than any leadership concept, SL has best stood the test of time, crossed cultures (Judeo-Chris- tian—Islam-Zen-Taoism), and even disciplines, systems, and fields (monarchy—modern politics—business). The same can be said of Aquino. The Revolution she inspired also became an inspiration for the 1989 revolu- tions in Eastern Europe, which ended communist 374 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123\n\n11. dictatorships. She has stood the test of time as people continued to call upon her and listen to her whenever policies and leaders seemed wayward and problematic; and she too has crossed cultures, disciplines, and ideologies as she was: (1) a political (as opposed to business) leader; (2) female; and (3) Asian but Western-educated and known to have successfully married her Catholic-Christian faith into a US-inspired democratic form of government, where the separation of Church and State is vital. In other words, she did it! She successfully achieved what various scholars, leaders, and businesses have still been talking, theorizing, and wondering about; and she did this on three fronts: (1) on the east meets west (how do you communicate with and successfully deal with Asia) discussion; (2) on the male versus female (how do females fit in a male dominated world) debate; and perhaps, the most significant one of all, (3) on the utility of ethics in a largely logical empiricist (quantitative and utilitarian) and secular humanist (less\n\n12. than spiritual) business world. On all three fronts, man- agement literature, and business practitioners are all grap- pling for ideas. Well, here is a very unique and interesting one. But there is another piece to complete the rationale for the Aquino and servant leadership success story, which makes this tandem especially relevant to the current state of business and its leaders. Howell and Costley (2006, p. 392) opined, ‘‘Servant leadership is probably most effective when followers are discouraged or face a long and difficult task.’’ Like the plight of business and leadership today (as a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis and various corporate scandals), the Philippines and Cory Aquino faced a long and arduous task in the years prior to 1986, when the country suffered under the reigns of a dictator. The country was headed by Ferdinand Marcos, who plunged the nation into a system governed by ‘‘guns, goons, and gold.’’ But people saw hope in a young senator,\n\n13. who boldly questioned and critiqued the country’s seem- ingly unstoppable strongman. At the start of his career, Benigno (‘‘Ninoy’’) S. Aquino, Jr., wanted nothing more but to become president. But experiences with the dicta- torship opened his eyes to the plight of the people, who were being stripped off their freedom and further plunged into poverty. Ninoy Aquino rallied and championed the opposition as a staunch freedom fighter. Eventually, Mar- cos arrested him and exiled him to the U.S. Upon his return in 1983, he was assassinated at the airport. Millions mar- ched at his funeral to grieve and show their disgust for the dictatorship. From thereon, Cory Aquino was thrust to the consciousness of the public as the grieving wife of a murdered political leader, and symbolically perceived as the rallying symbol for Philippine freedom and democracy. Cory Aquino became the most viable candidate against Marcos who was forced to call a snap election in February, 1986 in hopes of reaffirming his questionable legitimacy.\n\n14. Garbed in her ubiquitous yellow attire, Cory Aquino became the central figure that changed the course of Phil- ippine history and gave the world its first symbol of a revolutionary kind of female leadership in Asia. She was also only the third woman to be hailed Time magazine’s ‘‘Woman of the Year’’; and in August 1999, she was again recognized as one of the 20 Most Influential Asians of the Century. Similarly, if business leaders get it right, they can be catapulted to true greatness; and the rationale and example is right here. In order to understand and learn from this success story, we have to understand Aquino’s path to greatness under the lens of key concepts in SL literature. In order to better understand Aquino, we adopted the quali- tative research method (Salkind 2006), drawing primary data from in-depth interviews of 14 persons (see Table 1) who worked with Corazon (‘‘Cory’’) Aquino. Some remained close to her well up to the end of her life while\n\n15. others fell in and out of maintaining close relations with her, thus, enabling a more realistic and less biased view of her leadership. Secondary data were also drawn from published testimonies and tributes to Aquino, both from friends and ‘‘hostile’’ acquaintances, to strengthen the validity of the research. Semi-structured interview questions were devel- oped with the aid of general leadership (Yukl 2010), servant leadership (Greenleaf 2005; Sendjaya and Sarros 2002; Whetstone 2005; Hamilton and Knoche 2007; Hunter 2004; Russell and Stone 2002; Sendjaya et al. 2008; Sipe and Frick 2009), and virtue ethics literature (Havard 2007; Arjoon 2000; Grint 2007; Hadreas 2002; Hartman 2007; Dawson and Batholomew 2003; Moore and Beadle 2006). As validity refers to the extent to which an empirical measure (in this case, the questionnaire) adequately reflects the real meaning of a concept under consideration (in this case, Aquino as a servant leader), the authors married leadership concepts from literature with manifestations of\n\n16. such culled from writings on Aquino (Aportadera 2009; Calica and Macairan 2009; Inquirer 2009; Osorio 2009; Padua and Macarian 2009; Pamintuan 2009; Philippine Star 2009; Sicam 2009; Time 1987). Questions were designed to elicit the interviewees’ impressions and opinions about Aquino’s person and character, leadership style and behavior, work relationships, and her influence on others. The respondents were also afforded the opportunity to discuss issues not addressed by the questions, but relevant to the research topic. Verbatim interview transcripts were analyzed, applying both manual and software-aided tech- niques (NVivo 7) for topic and analytical coding to enhance the reliability of the study. Coding served to organize the data according to categories following the pre-set questions. The categories were further analyzed, compared, regrouped, and refined to define the core themes and conceptual When Servant Becomes Leader 375 123\n\n17. relationships. The findings were then analyzed in light of theoretical considerations on servant leadership, and con- clusions and theoretical formulations were drawn. Virtue: The Quality Needed for Success In the article, Segmenting the Base of the Pyramid, Rangan et al. (2011) illustrated the pitfalls of companies’ failure to link their own financial success with that of their constit- uencies. They opined, ‘‘If a company embarks on an ini- tiative that focuses solely on commercial gain, civil society and governments are likely to oppose it intensely’’ (p. 173). Similarly, ‘‘projects that fail to make money will eventu- ally be relegated to companies’ corporate social responsi- bility departments, as Microsoft discovered.’’ This is a result of leadership’s lack of good judgment and foresight as to what the common good really is. A good leader is relatively more developed in the virtues and has a clear vision of the common good (Arjoon 2000). Dawson and\n\n18. Bartholomew (2003, p. 127) stressed that virtues promote human flourishing and enable people to direct their behavior toward a goal (Arjoon 2000). Based on Solo- mon’s (2004) idea that there should be ‘‘no ultimate split or antagonism between individual self-interest and the greater public good’’ (p. 1021), one has to think of oneself as a member of the larger community and strive to excel, to bring out what is best in oneself and the community; and from a more pragmatic perspective, business owners and stakeholders should think, if a leader is not others-centered, then he must be individualistic and thus, self-serving. Certainly, business owners would not want their companies to be steered and led by self-serving individuals. What is best in people are virtues, which are in turn, defined by the community. Interestingly, Kodish (2006) discovered, a renewed interest in virtues happened during the Renais- sance—the age that saw the blossoming of the human potential, leading to the soaring of science and technology.\n\n19. Thus, a pragmatic understanding of the virtues can truly help create a sound leadership model that can more spe- cifically illustrate the true value of the servant leader. Servant-first leaders ‘‘make sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served’’ (Greenleaf 2002, p. 27); and virtues can be those fundamental core competencies, which Arjoon (2000, p. 169) defined as ‘‘the organizational strength of the firm that allows it to perform more effi- ciently and effectively.’’ In a world driven by selfish interests and desires, the formation of an ethical practice Table 1 List of Interviewees Name Position Dr. Bernardo M.

Factoran Jr. (‘‘Jun Factoran’’) Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources during the term of Philippine President Cory Aquino 376 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 can be less challenging with a servant leader at the helm; and Aquino is a prime example. Challenges for Servant Leadership in the Business World Greenleaf (2005, p. 27) opined, ‘‘To the worldly, servant leaders may seem naive.’’ The concept of the narcissistic leader, one with a larger-than-life-ego (Kodish 2006), has for so long, dominated human thinking (Maccoby in Ko- dish 2006). Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) recognized the tendency among leadership scholars to present leaders as larger-than-life and Herculean. What captures the public’s\n\n23. attention is a charismatic leader’s propensity for high drama (Hamilton and Knoche 2007). In a world that is increasingly becoming more image-oriented (Kodish 2006) it is understandable how the quiet leader (plow horse) passes unnoticed, while the charismatic leader (show horse) can easily attract a cult-like following. But the narcissistic leader ‘‘cannot stand the tests of reality and sound business practices’’ (Kodish 2006, p. 451). Moreover, in Jim Collins’ best-selling book enti- tled, Good to Great (2001), this seeming oxymoron is part of the essential characteristic of great leaders, who were found to possess what Kodish (2006, p. 451) identified as ‘‘a paradoxical combination of traits’’—‘‘ferocious resolve and fearlessness and stoicism on one hand and unpreten- tiousness, modesty, shyness, and humility’’ (p. 453). Col- lins (in Hamilton and Knoche 2007) found CEOs in the study to be quiet, of dogged nature, awkward, modest, and shy. Thus, there is value in considering that just maybe,\n\n24. ‘‘the heroic leader is a singularly inappropriate role model in many circumstances’’ (Grint 2007, p. 233). This is where we might consider the simple yet novel insight provided by the dictum of ‘‘doing ordinary things, extraordinarily well.’’ Greenleaf (1977), the founder of the concept ‘‘constructed the notion of servant leadership not by studying some top-notch corporate leaders or other high profile individuals, but through his reading of Herman Hesse’s story about a pilgrimage, Journey to the East’’ (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002, p. 58), where the character of servant, was essential to all other characters, needing his guidance and leadership throughout. Similar to SL is the concept of the transformational leader (see Burns 1978). While both are said to be people- oriented (Patterson et al. 2003), transformational leaders are concerned with getting followers to support organiza- tional objectives for the sake of the organization. This is similar to the US marine code of ‘‘Mission first, then team,\n\n25. then self’’ (in Useem 2010, p, 89), which Wharton has incorporated into their MBA and executive MBA pro- grams. Useem (2010, p. 88) opined, ‘‘The organization should be put first in business, whatever the individual calculus, and it is important for leaders to repeatedly affirm that.’’ Thus, students are taught, ‘‘The ability to make fast and effective decisions that draw quickly upon the insights of all those on the front lines is among the defining qual- ities of combat-ready leadership’’ (p. 89). While the stu- dent’s ingenuity is given primacy, it is only honed in order for him to learn how to convey strategic intent to align people across an organization to reach a common goal. But the fact that leadership is viewed as something that has to be ‘‘combat-ready’’ might explain why ‘‘leaders find it tough to ensure that their people adhere to values and ethics’’ (Nonaka and Takeuchi 2011, p. 59). Given the often scandalous behavior of leaders and business, there is reason to believe ‘‘There’s something wrong with the way\n\n26. B-schools, companies, and leaders are developing manag- ers.’’ Thus, Nonaka and Takeuchi declared, ‘‘The ability to lead wisely has nearly vanished.’’ Servant leaders focus on the people who constitute the organization. One might, however, ask to what extent does the servant leader’s impetus to serve others (while feeling no affinity for an organization) impede an organization’s economic flourishing? Rennaker and Novak (2007, p. 305) echoed the ‘‘concern regarding the utility of servant-lead- ership for influencing organizational level measures such as productivity or efficiency.’’ Stone, et al. (in Rennaker and Novak 2007) ‘‘further complicated the issue of utility by claiming that servant-leaders focus more on follower needs than organizational objectives.’’ This is thus viewed as problematic because Useem (2010, p. 89) wrote, ‘‘What is good for the individual manager is not necessarily good for the company.’’ The expert in Aristotelian business ethics, however, will\n\n27. disagree. Solomon (2004) wrote, there should be ‘‘no ultimate split or antagonism between individual self- interest and the greater public good’’ (p. 1021). Similarly, there should be no split between what is good for the individual manager and the company. For Vinnet Nayar, CEO of an IT services giant in India, employees come first and customers second (Cappelli et al. 2010). From an interview of senior executives at 98 of the largest India- based companies, Cappelli et al. found that none of them suggested that their company’s success was due to their cleverness at strategy or skill in financial markets, mergers, or acquisitions. Their success was in their people—through their investment in people development and engagement with employees. In Japan, managers and business leaders recognize the unity between business and society as Japa- nese companies ‘‘live in harmony with society, have a social purpose in earning profits, pursue the common good as a way of life, have a moral purpose in running a busi-\n\n28. ness’’ (Nonaka and Takeuchi 2011, p. 61). Thus, the authors proposed a new communitarian approach to When Servant Becomes Leader 377 123 capitalism with leaders imbuing a social purpose in their activities. We believe, however, that leaders should also take caution when imbuing business activities with a social purpose and higher meaning—that it not border on nar- cissism or a missionary zeal in the tradition of the occult, that might just, once again, frame business and its leaders as gigantic juggernauts fulfilling a mission along similar lines as the White Man’s Burden (a poem that alludes to Western hegemony of ‘‘less developed’’ people). The narcissistic and charismatic leader can perhaps be traced to the idea of man-centeredness and secularism, which flourished during the Enlightenment (Kodish 2006). The occupation with the absence of empirical studies in SL\n\n29. can also be attributed to the intellectual framework intro- duced by the age, which framed itself as a revolution in thinking and paved the way for human progress. Kodish (2006, p. 458) referred to this as the ‘‘dogmatic adherence to Newtonian and Cartesian principles and an insistence on cold and lifeless objectivity without taking humanity into consideration.’’ Trepidation and unease with the servant leader’s impetus to serve others (while feeling no affinity for an organization) and impeding an organization’s eco- nomic flourishing, is part of the consequence of the bottom line being money, as opposed to loftier human pursuits. Hadreas (2002, p. 372) wrote, ‘‘The quasi-political activi- ties of the modern corporation are not sufficient to engender ‘living well,’ in the sense of human flourishing.’’ Another issue hounding the SL concept is the call for substantial empirical research (Bass in Sendjaya and Sarros 2002) and the attribution of the slow movement of SL scholarship to the absence of such studies. It is, however,\n\n30. ironic how a concept with a ‘‘profound philosophical foundation’’ (Bass in Sendjaya and Sarros 2002, p. 57), which ‘‘provides avenues for its theoretical development,’’ failed to immediately capture scholarship and practice. Nonaka and Takeuchi (2011, p. 60) provided an explanation: Managers tend to rely on explicit knowledge, because it can be codified, measured, and generalized…The scientific, deductive, theory-first approach assumes a world independent of context and seeks answers that are universal and predictive. However, all social phenomena—including business—are context dependent. Rennaker and Novak (2007, p. 306) opined, ‘‘There is cause for research exploring the contextual factors related to servant-leadership’s existence and effectiveness for organizations’’; because ‘‘leadership in an organization might focus on individualistic wants in a manner that is not consistent with the altruism and empowerment associated\n\n31. with servant-leadership’’ (Rennaker and Novak 2007, p. 318). Perhaps studies on the context ripe for a servant leader can be one of the answers to the void left by the absence of empirical studies to prove SL effective and real. But for servant leadership to continue to demonstrate ‘‘staying power’’ a database of success stories must be built (Rennaker and Novak 2007); and Aquino is one such success story. Manifestations of Aquino’s Good Leadership Greenleaf (2003, p.33) declared, the servant leader ‘‘is more likely to emerge in practice in those segments of society where the concern is most intensely felt for justice (rather than order), for the performance (rather than the form) of our institutions, and for the appropriateness (rather than the result) of power and authority.’’ Cory Aquino’s rise to power was a product of disgust for a dictatorship mired in dirty politics and abuses to human dignity and freedom. She was forced to assume the challenge of the presidency out of\n\n32. her genuine desire to effect meaningful change. Thus, people rallied toward her and an unimaginable miracle happened. In Aquino, the vision of the narcissistic and charismatic leader and the traditional context for choosing a leader based on order, form, and result all broke down. Her success and rise to power was a combination of context and virtue—the context that the dictatorship had inflicted ter- rible abuses to human freedom and dignity; and the essence of true leadership laden with virtue. The philosophical foundation for Aquino’s success as a servant leader is anchored on SL literature, which identifies the following core virtues—integrity, spirituality, exem- plary character, humility and simplicity, authenticity, courage, people-centeredness, and being genteel or ‘‘grace under pressure.’’ Our study confirms that Aquino lived these virtues and thus, qualifies her as a model of SL. At the same time, the study invokes Aristotle who believed that ‘‘societies are practically best managed by adopting\n\n33. ameliorative measures that fit the prevailing regime’’ (Bragues 2007, p. 380); and in the Philippine experience with a servant leader, these virtues were crucial. Integrity Across cultures, industries, and leadership theories, integ- rity is high on the list. Morrison (in Knights and O’Leary 2006) argued that it is the foundation of character and without it, leaders will never generate trust. Bass and Steidlmeier (1999) declared that to be truly transforma- tional, leadership must be morally grounded; thus, authen- ticity flows and a real transformation of the other begins. Sendjaya et al. (2008) stressed, ‘‘the authenticity of servant leaders significantly shapes and affects their relationships to others’’ (p. 407). Aquino’s authenticity flows from her 378 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 integrity. She was often true to her word and led by\n\n34. example; thus, it was not difficult for people to believe that she was in fact, authentic in the real sense of the word. The authors, however, would like to explain that the use of the word ‘‘authentic’’ is not exclusive. Authenticity is found in other leadership styles; but it is not portrayed as the core focus. For instance, transformational leadership is authentic (see Bass and Steidlmeier 1999) and needs to be authentic (Evers-Williams 2007); while it is not labeled as such, it is implied. Whether other views of self and lead- ership are authentic or not, is of course a matter for debate and more research; but in our universe, which places eth- ical integrity and moral culture right at the center (Thoms 2008), then at the very least, other modes that exclude these indicators should bring to question the authenticity of other leadership views and models. In fact, Kodish (2006) revealed the paradox of leadership steeped in narcissism, which also implies the significance of ethical integrity and moral culture for leadership to be authentic. But certainly,\n\n35. this can be a matter for debate especially for those coming from a very different leadership mode. With Aquino, serving government became a distinct honor because she set as the standard in public service the virtues of honesty and moral integrity (Aportadera 2009). After stepping down from office, Aquino did not have any corruption case filed against her. Teddyboy Locsin explained, ‘‘she was very particular about separating her personal money with the office’’ and that ‘‘in her drawer she had two stacks—food eaten by children, she’d get from her personal money; food eaten by her, that’s charged to Malacañang’’ (the office of the President). Quezon City Mayor Feliciano Belmonte Jr. confirmed this: ‘‘She never asked for favors for herself or her family’’ (Calica and Macairan 2009) and that ‘‘she made a difference between the people’s money and her own.’’ Father Arevalo added that according to the head of Philippine Airlines’ (PAL) security, Aquino ‘‘was absolutely scrupulous about gaso-\n\n36. line.’’ He added, ‘‘Whenever it was for her own personal trips, not as president, she would pay for that, she would go by ordinary PAL.’’ Neither did she seek reelection. Margie Juico opined, ‘‘she preserved the integrity of the Presi- dency’’ and never once asked Juico ‘‘to call or check with the Supreme Court justices, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) or any other agency’’ to try to influence policy for the sake of personal interests. Oscar Orbos confessed that when he was Executive Secretary, she never gave special instructions to favor anyone or to bend the rules to accommodate certain business interests. Teresita Ang See affirmed, ‘‘She did not exempt herself from the rules.’’ For instance, Philip Juico revealed that the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) did not exempt Haci- enda Luisita, a big parcel of land that belonged to the Cojuangco family. In fact, Aquino forbade any of her relatives from retaking any family business lost during the Marcos years or from starting any new businesses during\n\n37. her term as president. Juico stressed how Aquino disliked the display of power, arrogance, and being special. Former finance secretary and businessman Ramon del Rosario declared, Cory Aquino ‘‘made many Filipinos proud because of her honesty, integrity, and transparency’’ (Calica and Macairan 2009). As proof of the value of ethical leadership, according to the Makati Business Club (MBC), the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) and the Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI), business confidence improved when Aquino became pres- ident in 1986 (Osorio 2009). Havard (2007, p. 7) added, ‘‘Long after she ceased to be President, Filipinos still looked up to her.’’ Spirituality Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) discovered several SL authors’ arguments for spirituality and humility as the motivational base for servant leaders. Spirituality has become an area of interest and focus for business and organizations in general.\n\n38. As ‘‘work has taken an ever more prominent and time- consuming place’’ (Kolodinsky et al. 2007, p. 465) in our lives the human and more personal aspect of workers has taken a more conspicuous dimension in the workplace. Aquino’s spirituality is uniquely significant to a virtue ethics based study on leadership since ‘‘a spirituality that enables a person to develop good moral habits (or virtue) is appropriate for the workplace’’ (Cavanagh and Bandsuch 2002, p. 109). Moreover, it is significant to point out that human beings are most authentically human when stretching toward fostering a relationship with God and others (Finch, 2007). Stemming from common sense and practice, this paper defines spirituality as a state of being inclined to going beyond the obvious physical reality as a consequence of being drawn toward the divine, which, itself, is a consequence of virtue. This is consistent with workplace spirituality scholars Gotsis and Kortezi (2007), who defined their field as ‘‘an experience of transcendence,\n\n39. interconnectedness, personal completeness and joy’’ (p. 579). Aquino saw her faith and the presidency as com- patible dimensions of life. Her faith in the divine is well known. Margie Juico recalled that she often used to say, ‘‘I pray with all my heart, I work with all my might.’’ According to Deedee Siytangco, she was guided with her personal dictum, ‘‘I’ll do my best and God will do the rest.’’ Rapa Lopa recalled, ‘‘She kept on telling us, you’ll have to make people realize that if you begin to trust God and center your life in God, nothing else matters.’’ Her conviction in the divine is apparent in the fact that according to her daughter, Ballsy, she felt sorry for those who did not believe. Perhaps, this is what enabled her to When Servant Becomes Leader 379 123 become, what Jun Factoran referred to as, ‘‘physically and morally brave.’’ Like all other virtues, her supernatural\n\n40. outlook remained with her throughout her presidency and well beyond; and like all other virtues it took time and effort to acquire. Her daughter Ballsy narrated how her parents came to build such a deep relationship with God: ‘‘It was during martial law when she and Dad became spiritual…Before that he was just so one-track minded on becoming President.’’ It was then when he realized that his suffering during martial law was but a small test. Ninoy’s daughter shared, ‘‘He became so dependent on God’’ and that ‘‘those times were difficult for Mom, but that was what gave her strength.’’ Her unflinching faith in God tremen- dously helped her in carrying the burdens of public office and put the welfare of her countrymen before her own. Exemplary Character An exemplary character is central to SL as well as virtue ethics. Bragues (2007) argued ‘‘that social groupings, such as corporations, work best when led by individuals of good character’’ (p. 373). An illustration of Aquino’s exemplary\n\n41. character can certainly provide a model for this type of leadership. Nonaka and Takeuchi (2011, p. 63) opined, ‘‘Wise leaders quickly sense what lies behind a situation, project a vision of the future or the consequences, and decide on the action needed to realize that vision…intuitively fathom the nature and meaning of people, things, and events.’’ Aqui- no’s spiritual director, Father Arevalo declared, Aquino ‘‘was a woman of great personal character’’ with a ‘‘gen- uine love for the Filipino people,’’ which he believes, is what won the honor and affection of the people. She had what many Christian Catholics refer to as unity of life— living with Christ and in Christ, at each and every moment of one’s existence with family, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances. Cory Aquino was a God-fearing individual with a strict Catholic formation, which had a lasting influence on her personal beliefs and presidency; and this enabled her to be prudent. This is an important quality for all individuals but most especially for leaders. Nonaka and\n\n42. Takeuchi (2011) wrote about the significance of phronesis or practical wisdom, which they opined, ‘‘enables manag- ers to determine what is good in specific times and situa- tions and to undertake the best actions at those times to serve the common good’’ (p. 61) because ‘‘Practical wis- dom is tacit knowledge acquired from experience that enables people to make prudent judgments and take actions based on the actual situation, guided by values and morals’’ (p. 60). When leaders are able to cultivate such knowledge, they are able to make enlightened decisions. Aquino’s prudence might have just saved the country from further chaos. Teddyboy Locsin recounted, during the 1989 coup, when the Americans came to assist and Fidel Ramos gave them the targets to hit, Cory refused to hit any target because she was afraid that it could start a civil war. Aquino was prudent enough not to act rashly and consid- ered the consequence of choosing the more violent alter- native. Had she opted to hit those targets, a civil war might\n\n43. have ensured and the peaceful revolution that the country had popularized might have lost its appeal. Humility and Simplicity This paper illustrates the connection between Aquino’s spirituality and her virtues—particularly the combination of humility and simplicity, for which she was widely known. These are qualities that have been explicated in bestselling author, Jim Collins’ (2001) the ‘‘Level Five Leader’’ as well as leadership scholar Joseph Badaracco (2003) in his con- cept of the ‘‘quiet leader.’’ While Herculean concepts of leadership are the opposite of the very essence of the servant leader, ironically, Aquino provides a Herculean case to serve as a model. Her case might perhaps, prove attractive to a corporate world that is enthralled by revolutionary and over-the-top cases and concepts. But Aquino’s humility and simplicity were authentic, which, once again, ironically led her to become a larger-than-life figure. Aquino was both intelligent and humble. Joey Cuisia\n\n44. recalled how she was transparent and honest about not understanding complex issues such as fiscal and monetary policy. Philip Juico explained ‘‘when she talks to me, she refers to me as ho’’ (a term used to refer to someone with great respect in the local dialect). Margie Juico confessed that sometimes she ‘‘thinks lowly of herself.’’ For instance, while crossing the street, Aquino would say ‘‘Let’s be careful and go slowly…we might be run over.’’ Juico would say to herself, ‘‘People would surely not try to run you over.’’ Juico added: ‘‘Or one time, she says, ‘How good they are because they still remember me.’’’ Juico would reply, ‘‘I suppose so; you’re a former President.’’ Teddyboy Locsin confessed that as a young lawyer-journalist and son of the owner of what was then, a very powerful newspaper, he was quite arrogant. He revealed that Aquino helped him realize that one’s position did not matter as much as what one really did. He recalled having to write the president’s speech about firing certain members of her cabinet, including himself. It\n\n45. was with Aquino that he learned to set aside his pride; and he remained loyal even if she did fire him thrice. Aquino’s daughter, Ballsy also shared a story that reveals the depth of her mother’s humility—in a wedding they attended during martial law, nobody wanted to sit with them at the reception and were thus seated with the nannies of the flower girls. But they sat there and endured it. Moreover, also during martial law, they were humiliated with all those body searches, when visiting Ninoy in prison. 380 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 While she was confident, she exhibited humility not akin to those in power; it was clear to many that her role as leader was simply a task and responsibility that she had to do; and being in power was not something she necessarily enjoyed. Rapa Lopa recalled how his aunt even scolded him for asking people to prepare messages for her, which\n\n46. he would place in a binder for her 75th birthday. Ballsy Aquino-Cruz declared, she did not like to call attention to herself. Margie Juico recalled a trip to a province for a function as president, when people offered her a fancy chair; but she refused and opted to sit on a sack of rice like everybody else. She was not power-hungry. She did not even run for reelection, in spite of the various voices egging her to do so. She was definitely not a ‘‘primadonna’’ as Margie Juico admitted. She recalled, while in Malacañang, ‘‘she never ordered me to do anything’’ and ‘‘what she will do is she will get up and do it herself.’’ Another aspect of her great humility was, according to Bernie Villegas, the fact that she ‘‘accepted her limita- tions.’’ Teresita Ang See concurred, ‘‘when there is something she doesn’t understand, she is humble to admit.’’ Oscar Orbos added that there are the so-called experts who like to carry their weight around; but she was president, and he could disagree with her and discuss things honestly\n\n47. and intelligently. A less obvious example of her humility is the fact that she mustered the courage to act as com- mander-in-chief of an armed forces that may have also murdered her husband and took part in the humiliating body searches and procedures she and her children had to undergo when visiting Ninoy Aquino in jail during the Marcos years. She could be counted on to set aside her emotions to make difficult and painful decisions. One should consider why she allowed the Marcoses to return to the country. Frank Drilon confessed that he advised her to allow them to return based on the rationale that they have the right of abode as citizens of the Philippines; and on that basis she made her decision. In consonance with this was her unprecedented level of simplicity. She truly led an ordinary life. Philip Juico recalled that some months after the death of her husband, he saw her at the supermarket doing the groceries for the family. Her virtues were real even when the cameras were\n\n48. off and the public stopped looking. Teresita Ang-See pointed out to the fact that she opted to live in Arlegui, a fairly middle to upper middle-class residence, as opposed to Malacañang (the presidential palace). In fact, her very choice of home (Times Street) even before the presidency is another indicator of her humble and simple leanings. Given her family background and social status, she could have opted to live in one of the city’s more extravagant residential areas. The same goes for her manner of dress- ing, which both Locsin and Orbos recognized as simple— sometimes too simple, even for someone not of her stature. She often had to attend events where she was the focus of attention (i.e., when she addressed the US Joint Houses of Congress) and yet she chose to wear what many might consider plain (a decision she made to the detriment of her public relations advisers). Authenticity Cory Aquino’s numerous international awards recognize\n\n49. her as an icon of democracy. But the effect of this could not have been sustained had the leader been but an empty source of inspiration. Aquino’s public and private face were one and the same. Her sincerity and integrity were not products of public relations or propaganda. Aquino’s image was not just an image but a real reflection of the person within. Father Arevalo explained that this is the rationale for the so-called ‘‘Cory Magic’’ and why ‘‘people stood by her and she was able to remain.’’ Oca Orbos recalled that when he was Executive Secretary, as long as an order came from Aquino, he never doubted the integrity of a task. Bernie Villegas agreed that in spite some of her other limitations (i.e., her economics, failure to sometimes choose the right members to join her team), Aquino was sincere. Roxas (2010) opined, ‘‘She wasn’t just this larger- than-life symbol on a poster.’’ Her strength of character helped her to ward off what Orbos referred to as an office, which is ‘‘a landmine for royal treatment and corruption.’’\n\n50. Courage At an international conference on servant leadership, Evers-Williams (2007) described courage as ‘‘believing in something strongly enough where you will not turn back regardless of the circumstances’’ (p. 101). Moreover, she differentiated the servant leader by identifying a crucial characteristic, which SL literature already confirms—that the SL is a reluctant leader as he does not set out to do or to become a leader. Like Aquino, potential servant leaders are thrust into trying circumstances that require much courage to face and take on; and when they do, it rocks their world and that of others (but almost entirely for the benefit of the latter). In the case of Aquino, her world was truly rocked. She took on a feared dictator who exiled and imprisoned her husband; and yet, she mustered the courage to take him on. She survived numerous coup attempts and as Locsin declared, did not seem to exhibit any fear even if at times, it seemed that they were on the losing end. In spite of the\n\n51. separation of Church and State the country inherited from its American colonizers, Aquino was not afraid to allow her faith to play a big role in her leadership style. But she of course, had her critics. Many will view decisions such as allowing the Marcoses to return a sign of When Servant Becomes Leader 381 123 weakness and perhaps wavering principles. But based on her track record of solid integrity, this is hardly the case. While the value of the decision may be questioned, the principle by which she made the decision was a result of courage and humility. A president who survives seven coup attempts and manages to keep democracy alive despite repeated armed challenges can hardly be described as weak (Pamintuan 2009). Margie Juico explained, ‘‘She acts that way because she has been through a lot—she’s seen her husband suffer and die, they were ostracized, vilified and\n\n52. her husband pilloried by media.’’ Juico added: ‘‘She’s seen the other side of the political spectrum—that of being in the opposition as opposed the Administration.’’ While strong leaders may often be misunderstood, there is a kind of strength that is appreciated and even revered. Perhaps, it helped that she exuded other qualities and characteristics that earned the love and respect of people. People-Centeredness People-centeredness is one of the hallmarks of SL, par- ticularly focused on the transformation of followers. But it is a unique and truly selfless brand of transformation, since the goal is to help the follower grow freer and wiser and eventually become servant leaders themselves. There is a real impetus to help other human beings become better human beings. It is a concept similar to Jacques Maritain’s personalism, which emphasizes the uniqueness of the per- son in tandem with the relational and communitarian dimension of the human being (Whetstone in Acevedo\n\n53. 2012). Acevedo (2012) recognized this connection as he confirmed the similarity between personalism and the ser- vant leader’s transforming vision, guided by the commit- ment to honoring the dignity and freedom of followers in their effort to participate in a community. In addition, Aquino’s brand of ‘‘people-centeredness’’ was drenched in love, ‘‘which is the virtue that promotes the other virtues and puts order and unity among them’’ (Argadoña 2011, p. 80). Cappelli (2010, p. 95) found that in India, ‘‘leaders go to considerable lengths to empower employees’’ and that ‘‘the best Indian companies have a social mission and a sense of national purpose because that helps employees find meaning in their work’’ (p. 94). Aquino’s management strategy recognized the value of people; and this was manifested in her strategy of consultation and people- centered approach to running the country and dealing with challenges and issues. Philip Juico opined that while\n\n54. ‘‘inefficient at times,’’ she truly believed that democracy was the best system ‘‘because it respects the dignity of the human person’’ and helps to empower people. Consistent with her goal of bringing back democracy, she believed in allowing the people whom she chose and trusted to give sound advice. Joey Cuisia and Margie Juico admitted that she did not interfere in their decision-making and simply expected them to do their job. In fact, Orbos declared that he could critique her opinions and decisions openly. A more formal version of this is practiced in Japan where companies create opportunities for senior executives and employees to learn from each other (see Nonaka and Takeuchi 2011). A ba (place, space, or field) is created where employees (which includes upper management) can share information and build relationships. In one particular company, employees are even asked to review their pres- ident’s business practices in a kurumaza (sitting in a circle). Aquino’s people-centeredness was apparent in both her\n\n55. role as president and friend. As a leader, Aquino attempted to bring opposing groups together and surrounded herself with what people referred to as a ‘‘rainbow coalition.’’ She tried to find a place for everyone in her government, whether Marxist, communist, rightist, or centrist. Bernie Villegas, however, explained that as a result, ‘‘there were members of her team who could not get along and some of her decisions were flawed.’’ Joey Cuisia recalled Aquino saying you can never please everyone and that she was not a politician. Cuisia suspected that this may also have worked against her because some of those politicians made it difficult for her bills to get passed in Congress because she was not willing to compromise. But Drilon revealed that while she trusted and allowed her people to discuss and settle disputes that involved policy, ‘‘if it involved the integrity of the official,’’ she would not tolerate it. When a compromise between conflicting parties could not be set- tled, she would make the tough decision to let them go, as\n\n56. the case was with her first Executive Secretary (Joker Arroyo) and Finance Minister (Jimmy Ongpin), who could not get along. Margie Juico explained that Aquino was very much in control, following one of her personal dictums, ‘‘You do your consulting but in the end you make your decision and you’ll be accountable and responsible for the decision you make.’’ On a more personal note, some married couples men- tioned how Cory’s advice helped save their marriage. Lanny Nanagas revealed her thoughtfulness, recalling how Aquino would regularly call him on his birthday. Margie Juico specifically remembered how the late president was present at her father’s wake daily. Deedee Siytangco recalled how attentive she was to people’s problems. Joey Cuisia opined, ‘‘She would even think of the welfare of her driver, her security people.’’ Locsin recalled, ‘‘She made sure that all her guards ate.’’ In the words of her daughter Ballsy, because she was ‘‘loved and not feared,’’ people\n\n57. followed her. Even in death, Ballsy recalled that her self- lessness and others-centeredness came pouring out. After the doctor had told her chemotherapy was no longer working, she mustered the courage to tell her mother who 382 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 responded, ‘‘I was ready to go the first time I found out…I was only thinking of you; you might not be ready yet.’’ In fact, just before she passed away, Margie Juico recalled how Aquino’s main concern was how one of her grandsons would get a job, his girlfriend, and what he would give her for Valentine’s. It was selflessness coupled with simplicity. Aquino knew how to take good care of people and remained very loyal to them. She was able to play the part of mother to those who were not even her children. This was particularly evident among the male interviewees. She was also able to accomplish what most parents struggle hard to attain—that of being a friend and mother to your\n\n58. children. To most of the female interviewees, she was revered as a dear and exceptional friend, who took good care of them. Jun Factoran opined her relationship with God is probably what enabled her to become others-cen- tered; and Aquino’s commitment to the common good, others-centeredness, and selflessness inspired people to do the same because they saw it in her. Genteel Leader: Grace Under Pressure Cameron (2011) opined that responsible leadership or the ability and inclination to act in an appropriate fashion is an attribute that makes certain types of leadership rare. This concept is consistent with Aristotle who believed that people of good character perceive a situation rightly (Hartman 2007) and that Aquino was genteel or grace under pressure adds to her appeal as a model for SL or any type of good leadership; because she successfully put into practice the inclination to act in an appropriate fashion—to act virtuously. This did not only help her succeed as a\n\n59. leader but it also helped endear her to her countrymen and to the world at large. Aquino was not the kind of person who would lose her temper or blow her top (Lanny Nanagas). Cuisia admitted, ‘‘if she was angry, she would keep it to herself.’’ She was always poised and polite, even when faced with adversity and personal criticism. She was secure and confident that even when she addressed the Joint Houses of Congress in the US, she was not concerned with her appearance, knowing that the entire globe would be watching. Perhaps, Cory Aquino had this great confidence because she was honest and maintained her integrity. But while she was polite, she found it difficult to forget betrayal. After Fidel Ramos assumed the presidency, negative rumors attempt- ing to taint Aquino’s integrity began to spread, which many believed to have been propagated by Ramos. Locsin nar- rated that during her late husband’s death anniversary, she made it a point to invite the president (Ramos) and in her\n\n60. speech, she said, ‘‘Some people think that I’m asking favors from this man.’’ Locsin recalled how uncomfortable Ramos looked; but what surprised Locsin more was how Aquino was able to remain calm and polite for many months before she spoke about her misgivings against Ramos. Like most people, she too had certain limits on what she would be silent about. For instance, she filed a libel case against a popular journalist, Louie Beltran, who alleged that she hid under her bed during one of the coups mounted by rebel troops. Margie Juico explained that she felt that it undermined her leadership. Her daughter Ballsy added that she was worried what the military would think, putting their lives on the line, while their leader hides out of fear. Cory Aquino’s genteel character blended with her firmness and determination to pursue the common good. She needed this to rein in the diverse characters and talents in her cabinet. Frank Drilon declared, ‘‘she got conflicting\n\n61. advice’’; but Aquino trusted people enough to uphold her strategy of consultation. Deedee Siytangco explained, ‘‘They all thought she was a housewife…She fired people close to her.’’ After one of the numerous coups that plagued her administration, she fired Juan Ponce-Enrile, one of the famed leaders of the 1986 Revolution, who was also sus- pected of supporting rebel troops that mounted the coup. While she was indeed, initially a housewife, the image that a housewife brings may have masked that part of her character that exhibited strength, firmness, and courage. Locsin revealed that she did not think power made her great or that the office gave her dignity. The office gave her responsibility but she was giving dignity to an office that needed it. Thus, Locsin declared, she was ‘‘grace under pressure.’’ Democracy was the Aquino cause and symbol, which she successfully forwarded through her integrity, spiritu-\n\n62. ality, exemplary character, humility, simplicity, and cour- age. As a result, she was authentic, people-centered, and genteel (with ‘‘grace under pressure’’)—characteristics of a true servant leader. This enabled her to stand out from other leaders (without intending to do so, as in the case of the narcissistic leader) and touched the lives of many, ironically catapulting her to iconic and larger-than-life leadership that the narcissistic leader consciously strives to achieve. The Path Toward Servant Leadership Thus, one should ask, how did Aquino do it? How did an inexperienced politician, Western-educated woman suc- ceed in becoming such a larger-than-life symbol not just to the Philippines but to the world? She was a simple woman (with no ambition) who ended her law studies to get married, have children, and raise a family. While she was Asian, she was Western in many ways, having studied in When Servant Becomes Leader 383\n\n63. 123 the Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia, the Notre Dame Convent School in New York, and the College of Mount Saint Vincent in New York, where she obtained her degree in Bachelor of Arts major in French Language and minor in Mathematics. As evidenced by her major, her exposure to Western culture and thought was immense. Moreover, she lived in the US for many years even after her studies, raising a family, and experiencing the Western life. As president, she was known to often deliver speeches in English; and unlike the former dictator’s wife, the only other visible symbol of female leadership in the country at that time, who was also known to celebrate traditional Filipino style, Aquino wore suits and sported a hairstyle in Western fashion. Her Press Secretary, Locsin, declared, ‘‘I wrapped her in the American flag.’’ Thus, in many ways, she was an honorary Westerner. So how did this honorary\n\n64. Westerner (and a woman, at that) successfully connect with the people—and not just in a superficial way but in a way almost equal to the effects of literature becoming a classic? While Aquino did not prepare for the presidency, she did not have to and merely had to trust those virtues, which she already had to call and move people to action. Moore and Beadle (2006, p. 372) opined that virtues ‘‘are enduring character traits (as, of course, are vices), not practice-spe- cific.’’ Gino and Pisano (2011) recognized that theories are often rooted in science or decades of practical experience but that in many cases, they are informal. Aquino had practical wisdom (phronesis), which she acquired through experience; but experience in the way of virtue (through her life as wife of an ambitious, popular and later slain leader and mother of five), which enabled her to become a virtuous leader and thus, a servant leader. Her success also illustrates how these enduring character traits, which are not practice-specific are also not culture-specific. Her\n\n65. practical wisdom is similar to two other Asian concepts discussed by Nonaka and Takeuchi (2011): (1) the Japa- nese concept of toku—‘‘a virtue that leads a person to pursue the common good and moral excellence as a way of life’’ (p. 60); and (2) yukta—‘‘just right’’ or ‘‘appropriate,’’ where executives believe that the purpose of a business is to serve people and enhance society’s well-being, shying away from excess and greed. Excess and greed have been traditional Western qualities (from the Age of Discovery and Imperialism to the Darwinian struggle for survival incorporated into capitalism). They too have come to characterize much of current business. Through Aquino, we can better see the universality of virtue, because this is what enabled people to see beyond the suit, Western haircut, English language, and American background of the former leader. Beyond the characteristics of Aquino’s leadership dimension, was her very person and character, which allowed her to naturally subordinate herself to oth-\n\n66. ers, as evidenced by her numerous acts of humility and supernatural outlook. Her power and influence emanated not from any position in government, but from her con- victions (Philippine Star 2009). Corazon Aquino is proof of the fruits of being good. Her brand of goodness served as the catalyst that charted her path toward wanting to serve and at the same time, her spirit of service was a result of her goodness of character. The phenomenon of her success and effects illustrates the universality of the goodness, effectiveness, and even usefulness of character rooted in virtue. Good leadership is best understood as a moral endeavor (Whetstone 2005). Greenleaf’s (2002) concept of the ser- vant leader’s ‘‘followers first, organizations second’’ phi- losophy (Senjaya et al. 2008), elevates both leaders and followers morally and ethically (Greenleaf 1977). It is a model of leadership that can help ensure virtue. At the same time, the formation of virtue can inspire the potential\n\n67. servant leader’s impetus to serve; thus, foregoing (or at least reducing) the inclination toward selfish interests. This is similar to Senjaya et al.’s (2008, p. 404) premise that servant leadership ‘‘is a manifestation of altruistic love in the action of pursuing transcendent vision’’ just as the essence of the latter is the motivational basis for becoming a servant leader. Aquino’s life was dedicated to serve God, her country and people—a hierarchy of values, which she was faithful to until death. Her conduct coincided with Greenleaf’s description of a servant leader as one who ensures that ‘‘other people’s highest priority needs are being served’’ (2002, p. 27). Aquino was a reluctant president. Factoran declared she only ran for president because of the desire to fight the dictatorship and to attain freedom. Father Arevalo explained, ‘‘That’s why she relinquished it (power) immediately when the time was up.’’ Villegas explained, ‘‘She had a number of personal motivations which she\n\n68. could have pursued.’’ She was the only president who did not plan to perpetuate herself in power (Inquirer 2009). Moreover, according to Orbos, the fact that none of her children ran for office or took any government position while she was in power is itself, tangible proof of her commitment to work for the common good without allowing selfish interests to get in the way. Specifically, three factors motivated her decision-making—its effect and implication on democracy, the common good, and moral- ity. She never abandoned the people and remained the guardian of democracy way up to the end of her life. In order to further check the authenticity of servant leadership, Greenleaf (2002, p. 27) asked: ‘‘Do those served grow as persons?’’ Cory Aquino served and inspired people close to her and also those who were far through her example, integrity, honesty, love for people, and selfless spirit of service. Some people were convinced to take on the challenge of public service or initiate not-for-profit\n\n69. 384 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 organizations serving the poor. The rich and poor alike guarded the democracy and freedom Cory helped regain. The millions of people who paid tribute to Cory, and prayed for her before and after her death wanted to thank her for what she had done for the country. In SL scholarship, virtues are referred to as character- istics (see Klamon 2007), attributes (see Spears 1995), values, and behavioral manifestations (see Yukl 2010). Senjaya et al. (2008) identified them as dimensions, which seem to most completely embody what the former have said. They are the following: (1) voluntary subordination— by being a servant and through acts of service; (2) authentic self—leadership which flows out of ‘‘being,’’ enabling authentic leadership manifested through humility, integrity, accountability, security, and vulnerability; (3) covenantal\n\n70. relationship—through acceptance, availability, equality, and collaboration; (4) responsible morality—though moral reasoning and action; (5) transcendental spirituality— through religiousness, interconnectedness, sense of mis- sion, and wholeness; and (6) transforming influence— through vision, modeling, mentoring, trust, and empower- ment. We posit, that servant leadership begins with and is sustained and maintained by virtues. The interplay of vir- tues and three of Senjaya et al.’s (2008) dimensions (namely, authentic self, transcendental spirituality, and responsible morality) set the stage for the servant leader’s impetus for others-centeredness, which Levinas (in Knights and O’Leary 2006) referred to as the engagement with the other. Likewise, engagement with the other sustains the virtues and Senjaya et al.’s three dimensions. Moreover, it also enables the impetus for voluntary subordination. All this ultimately leads to the formation of a covenantal relationship with the leader’s followers, as well as trans-\n\n71. forming influence, both of which further sustaining the other. Authentic Self Aquino refused to be managed, much less packaged (Sicam 2009). She was both president and icon of what an authentic leader should be (Padua and Macairan 2009). Like virtue, the authentic self is a result of habit. Aquino did not prepare for the presidency; but she already had with her those virtues needed to restore decency to the office. According to Senjaya et al. (2008), the authentic self is manifested in the display of humility, integrity, account- ability, security, and vulnerability—all of which were dominant dimensions of Cory Aquino. While virtue leads to the formation of an authentic self, the authentic self furthers virtues that have already been acquired, and enables the acquisition of other virtues in the process. Her humility was manifested in her willingness to work quietly behind the scenes without constant acknowledgement or\n\n72. approval from others. This was made possible by her integrity and sense of security. Her integrity made people believe her humble intentions. But while she was iconic and larger-than-life, as brought on by her success in bringing down a dictator through a uniquely bloodless revolution—fueled by prayer, manifest in very Catholic and Christian elements such as the holy rosary, priests, nuns, and figures of the Mother of Jesus—her elevation into iconic proportions was also made possible by her signature simplicity and humility. This was primarily made obvious by her lack of political ambition. Ironically, her rise to such a larger-than-life symbol is based on her simplicity and ‘‘ordinariness.’’ Aquino’s simplicity was a celebration of the significance of ordinary life; and this was further strengthened by the fact that her goodness was genuine and real. Moreover, her confidence enabled her to not want more for herself in terms of power, fame, and prestige. The leader’s secure sense of self enables him to be\n\n73. accountable and vulnerable to others, marked by the absence of self-defensiveness when criticized (Batten 1998) and the capacity to ‘‘abandon themselves to the strengths of others’’ (De Pree 1997, p. 182). Moreover, her faith in God already gave her what she wanted. President Aquino’s values and strength of character is a reflection of her devout faith. As a result, she was people-centered; thus, enabling her to understand the significance of account- ability, while trusting people’s autonomy and power to also lead themselves through her strategy of consultation. Quite often, she showed her vulnerability, which helped to communicate her genuine and authentic nature, endearing her to the Filipino. Transcendental Spirituality Transcendental spirituality is defined as the ‘‘relationships servant leaders promote imbued with spiritual values’’ (Sendjaya et al. 2008 p. 408). It is both a consequence of and catalyst for the authentic self. Similar to spiritual\n\n74. leadership, servant leadership responds to the needs of individuals by fostering a ‘‘holistic, integrated life.’’ McKee and Wallerstein (2009) opined, ‘‘Aquino avoided the limelight, and was more comfortable among priests and nuns than politicians.’’ Perhaps, the primary hallmark of Cory Aquino’s leadership is how she married her role as president and leader to her faith and personal relationship with God. She counted on the support of Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, who shielded her in the seven coup attempts launched by her enemies over the six years of her presidency (McKee and Wallerstein 2009). Her success in calling people to the streets was a great achievement in getting people to turn to Christ and making Him relevant in their life. One can claim that she is per- haps, the first Catholic (and even Christian) political leader When Servant Becomes Leader 385 123\n\n75. to bridge the gap between Church and state. What made her uniquely different from other leaders (particularly, political leaders) was the combination of her supernatural outlook and God-centeredness. Cory Aquino could well be the first truly Christian Catholic leader who lived the faith and married it with her political life; and that she succeeded in inspiring people to make God relevant to what is normally regarded as separate from religion, is a bonus. What leadership scholars refer to as charisma, is what many Filipinos refer to as ‘‘Cory Magic’’—and this was a product of her principles and God-centeredness. Responsible Morality The ends that servant leaders seek and the means they employ are morally legitimized, thoughtfully reasoned, and ethically justified. They promote post-conventional moral reasoning and encourage others to engage in it. Post- conventional moral reasoning relies on internalized prin- ciples of justice and right rather than the expectations of\n\n76. others, attainment of reward, or avoidance of punishment. Like a true servant leader, Aquino wanted to first give people a chance to truly participate in government, no matter where ones inclinations and ideologies lie. But when she realized that it was not working and certain values were being compromised, in the end, her principles triumphed. Just as a leader needs transcendental spirituality to achieve responsible morality, one who has attained the latter also furthers the development and sustenance of the former. In an organizational context where ethical principles are typically compromised, servant leadership fosters reflective behaviors, which bring about positive changes in the eth- ical climate of the organization. Aquino did the same for the Philippines when: (1) she assumed office after a dic- tatorship in 1986; (2) she called people to pray and rally against threats to democracy in 1998 and in 2000 with a sitting president’s plans for term extension and corruption; and (3) upon her death against another allegedly abusive\n\n77. president with the election of her son, ‘‘Noynoy’’ Aquino, who, before his mother’s death, was not even a contender for the presidency. Voluntary Subordination: Shedding off the Autonomous Self by Engaging with the Other A servant leader must be selfless enough to subordinate himself/herself to others. But what does it take for a leader to make that leap toward servant leadership? We invoke Knights and O’Leary (2006), who drew on the ethics of responsibility of Levinas (1966, 1969, 1991/1998), who opined, ‘‘the notion of the self is generated not by the self but rather through engagement with the Other’’ (Knights and O’Leary 2006, p. 126). An ethics of responsibility ‘‘is about an inex- haustive care for the Other’’ (p. 133)—something very much akin to the servant leader, whose innate desire to serve first defeats any selfish desire that may emerge in achieving his end, thus, successfully able to engage with\n\n78. the Other. Cory Aquino was not ambitious or power-hun- gry. She could have given up the struggle; and this would have made her life easier and more convenient. But she chose to fight—initially as the wife of a slain hero, then as president of a hopeful but ailing nation, and countless other times even after she stepped down as president and democracy had been won. Voluntary subordination is defined as behaviors of the leader, which demonstrate self-concept and attitudes (being a servant) as well as primary intent (doing acts of service). It is evident in the willingness to assume the lowliest of positions, possibly enduring hardship and suffering for others. Knights and O’Leary (2006) identified the problem of the autonomous self, which left its mark on society since the Enlightenment; and that only an engagement with the other could challenge it. We believe that voluntary subor- dination is the result of this engagement with the other. Aquino chose to give her life to serving the Philippines;\n\n79. and in spite of everything that happened to her, her hus- band, and family during martial law, during and well after her presidency, she never once faltered in the call to serve the country and the people. Transforming Influence and Covenantal Relationship: Servant Leader as the Catalyst for Virtue Senjaya et al. (2008) stated that servant leadership is contagious, bringing about a personal transformation in others collectively and repeatedly; thus, stimulating chan- ges in organizations and societies (Fairholm 1997; Russell and Stone 2002). Two of Senjaya et al.’s (2008) dimen- sions of a servant leader are direct catalysts for this— transforming influence and covenantal relationship. Transforming influence is defined as behaviors of the lea- der that inspire and assist employees to be what they are capable of becoming. It is when the servant leader is able to transform others that will eventually stimulate positive changes in organizations and societies. One of the most\n\n80. memorable aspects of Aquino’s leadership is the result— particularly, her effect on people. Teddyboy Locsin and Frank Drilon, for instance, entered public life and ran for office because of her efforts in the restoration of democ- racy. Philip Juico, who served as secretary of the Depart- ment of Agrarian Reform during the term of Aquino, was also a private citizen before joining the Aquino cause. Both he and wife, Margie, speak about Aquino’s great influence in their lives. For Philip, her influence was ‘‘particularly in 386 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 terms of how we should behave as public officials’’; and for Margie, it was Aquino’s mindset and that every time she encountered a problem she would ‘‘think of what she would have done.’’ Deedee Siytangco, who was Aquino’s spokesperson, acknowledged that Cory inspired her to be a better person. Bernie Villegas confessed, ‘‘I can think of\n\n81. specific individuals who, because of having worked for her, also started thinking always of what is good for others.’’ Jun Factoran confirmed this, revealing that even former Marcos loyalist and executive secretary Rafael Salas once confessed to him, ‘‘A life that does not include public service is not a complete life’’ and said he never realized this until he worked for Aquino. Teresita Ang See opined, that people saw ‘‘You can be a leader and yet remain humble and honest and not be corrupted by power.’’ Government officials were also encouraged to improve work habits. Teddyboy Locsin learned to more regularly meet deadlines. Oca Orbos learned the significance of establishing warmer relations with people. Philip Juico was astonished with how Aquino could hold on to her princi- ples and decisions. He declared, ‘‘For her, if you are right, although you may not be proven right today, tomorrow, or years later.’’ This is what Deedee Siytangco referred to as her tenacity. Her ability to sustain and endure without\n\n82. wavering, made her consistent; and this in turn elevated her to the level of icon. Juico explained that Aquino achieved a lot without trying too hard. She simply led a decent life. Transforming influence may occur through visioning, modeling through personal example in visible and tangible ways, mentoring and empowering others, and trust. In Aquino, modeling through personal example, empowering others, and trust were the dominant causes of her trans- formational influence. Beyond merely moving people, she succeeded in calling them to action and even adopting certain aspects of her lifestyle through her example. Si- ytangco declared that her security became prayerful because of her. This is a crucial aspect of living the vir- tuous life—that it spill over to others, influencing them to acquire and also struggle to live in virtue. While she remained a constant force many years after her presidency, it was after her death that the magnitude of her leadership was cemented to an iconic and larger-than-life level. As\n\n83. proof of her influence and impact, during her funeral, millions lined up for several hours under the heat and rain. She led by example, empowered and trusted those she worked with through her strategy of consultation and the humble recognition of her lack of expertise in certain areas. This also emanated from her people-centeredness, a pre- requisite in the formation of a covenantal relationship— ‘‘an intensely personal bond marked by shared values, open-ended commitment, mutual trust, and concern’’ (Senjaya et al. 2008, p. 407) for others. The strong ties that bind covenantal partners produce a relationship that is not easily stretched to breaking point or threatened by dis- agreement or conflict; and the authenticity of servant leaders significantly shapes and affects this. Aquino’s authenticity and various virtues enabled a covenantal relationship with the people; and with this strong rela- tionship came the idea of ‘‘Cory Magic,’’ which included her long-lasting effect and transformational influence on\n\n84. others. Our model can work best with companies that have already identified the crucial significance of business ethics and ethical leadership, but simply need an authentic and workable model that has achieved results. It may, however, be more difficult to adopt for companies that have not yet identified ethics as a significant aspect in the success of business; however, this article gives such companies a practical enough rationale of why they should begin to consider ethics. Some Words of Caution and Future Research The Virtuous Person and Mistakes Certainly, the virtuous person and the servant leader like any other can and does make mistakes. Acceptance of ones vulnerability is in fact, one of the facets of servant lead- ership. Sendjaya et al. (2008) explained that a servant leader’s secure sense of self enables him to be vulnerable to others. In addition, we invoke Caldwell et al. (2011) who\n\n85. defined repentance ‘‘as a behavior that incorporates an ongoing desire to improve one’s life by honoring duties owed to oneself and to others’’ (p. 475). Aquino was aware of her vulnerability as well as vulnerable to others. Proof of which was her people-centeredness and strategy of con- sultation. Her acceptance of her lack of experience and knowledge was one of the motivations for the latter. She knew she was not an expert in areas such as economics and banking, for instance; and so she sought advice and lis- tened. The other motivation can be drawn from her attempt to put together a ‘‘rainbow coalition,’’ where she tried to respect various ideologies, parties, and audiences by giving them a voice or at least a chance to exercise their voice. This clearly illustrated her love and respect for people. She was truly vulnerable to people. At the same time, however, she was known for her great firmness—so great that she was sometimes also labeled as ‘‘stubborn.’’ Some may think this all to be quite ironic and contradictory. But true\n\n86. to the essence of Aristotelian virtue and servant leadership, Aquino illustrates not a contradiction but a paradox—that good leadership requires a balance of two extremes. Aquino was vulnerable to people; and precisely because she knew and respected people as persons, she was knowledgeable and firm enough to recognize the real good When Servant Becomes Leader 387 123 for people—the common good. Thus, while she was vul- nerable to people, she knew that accommodating selfish interests (e.g., of family and friends) was contrary to a real sense of vulnerability to people. She knew it would be contrary to the common good and thus, opposed to people. Of course, she may not have always succeeded in choosing the right advisers or made the right decisions; but she recognized the significance of respecting the value of the ‘‘means’’ and not just ‘‘ends.’’ She knew that it was inev-\n\n87. itable for good leadership to respect and value people; and part of this exercise is hearing them out and giving them the chance to partake and participate in the process of being led. Even after this, Aquino recognized that she could get it wrong; and once she discovered, for instance, that she did not quite get the right person for the job, she would let them go. The Essence of Virtue Steeped in Modernity According to Bragues (2007), with few exceptions, ‘‘no sound empirical grounds exist for arguing that the checks and balances framework in place prior to the end of the 1990s bull market in equities was exposed as systematically flawed and in need of major restructuring’’ (p. 380). Deriving his thesis from the ancients (i.e., Plato and Aris- totle) he opined that the system in which things are being run matters less than who is running things. Thus, ‘‘Atten- tion must be shifted to the individual level of corporate life, inside the consciences of our business leaders, precisely\n\n88. where the ancient philosophers implied it should be.’’ In other words, broken character and not broken systems is the problem. At the same time, however, Bragues recognized the difficulty in arguing for the cause of the ancients in a world steeped in modernity. He found his solution in Ben- jamin Franklin, invoking his modern reliance on self- interest in tandem with the need for the formation of vir- tuous character; and among Franklin’s advice—‘‘that the character formation of business leaders take place through an education emphasizing role models culled from business history and biography’’ (p. 385). Aquino can be one such role model even for shareholder-dominated environments. Like Franklin, whom Bragues believed could offer a com- pelling enough ethic for corporate leaders that virtue per- sonally pays, Aquino and the effect she had on people and history illustrates that indeed, virtue does pay. Ethicists realize that in a shareholder-dominated environment, when associations between virtuousness and desired outcomes are\n\n89. observed, leaders may be more likely to respond to its pragmatic utility (Cameron 2011). It is important, however, for leaders to keep in mind the great irony in attempting to relate virtue to bottom-line goals and success—that virtu- ousness may no longer be virtuous as virtue is always something aspired for and done for its own sake whether or not any sort of advantage is in view. The entire exercise of attempting to inject virtue into such a utilitarian and cost- benefit framework might be all that it is—an exercise. But who knows, just like other exercises which can lead to the loss of poundage and the evolution of muscle, perhaps this exercise may one day lead to the loss or maybe tempering of utilitarianism and the primacy of selfish interests; after all, virtue is a consequence of habit and the exercise of attempting to inject virtue is definitely a good habit to keep. In the meantime, for future research to help ease the tran- sition for shareholder-dominated environments, studies might focus on investigating the premise that while broken\n\n90. characters and not broken systems are the problem, business might have institutionalized broken characters as a system. In which case, it would be interesting to see how this might be contributing to the inefficiency of firms given the dra- matic and often highly scandalous outcomes of the institu- tionalization of broken characters. Conclusion In this article, we looked into Cory Aquino’s life and presidency and the evidences they yield for the usefulness and soundness of servant leadership as an alternative for business in its crisis of leadership. Thoughts and opinions of those who worked closely with her as well as articles written about her allowed us to get an idea of her true character and the effect and power this had on an ailing nation in a seemingly hopeless position, even decades after her term. She was iconic, heroic, and larger-than-life; and this is precisely why business leaders can learn from her. Paradoxically, however, she was also ordinary because she\n\n91. lived and led as ordinary with qualities such as integrity, spirituality, character, humility, and simplicity—the very qualities, which enabled her to live that exemplary life. It was precisely this ‘‘ordinariness,’’ which endeared her to people and catapulted her to iconic levels; and this was sustained because she was authentic, courageous, people- centered, and genteel. But many have also said that President Cory Aquino’s success was short-lived. A possible explanation is while an ethical leader can bring about change in moral culture, it takes time for culture to change and that change may expose far greater unethical behavior than was originally believed to exist (Thoms 2008). Future research should look into the ethical influence of Aquino, particularly, the manner in which her ethics spread and was diffused and the barriers to it. Future research should look into the rela- tionship between time and the kind of change the Philip- pines needed when Aquino assumed power. This should\n\n92. further help organizations construct a more specific road- map for a shift to ethics, beyond merely choosing an ethical 388 Z. A. S. Udani, C. F. Lorenzo-Molo 123 leader and developing one. But certainly, the Aquino suc- cess story illustrates the impact of ethical leadership rooted in servant leadership. Like Japanese companies, which Nonaka and Takeuchi (2011, p. 61) opined, ‘‘may have come under fire for the mistakes they have made,’’ Cory too was constantly criticized for some of her strategies and decisions. Like Japanese companies, which people con- tinue to respect, Aquino’s image has remained untainted, catapulting her to iconic and larger-than-life proportions. Nonaka and Takeuchi stressed that before the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, ‘‘there was no crisis of confidence in Japan’s corporate world as there is in America’s’’ and if at all any criticism remains, it is that\n\n93. Japanese companies are said to be not being sufficiently capitalistic. But given Japan’s success in the past, it seems capitalism may not be the ultimate rationale for business success. Like the Philippine and Aquino phenomenon, many leaders who might have been better versed in terms of strategy and technique came but none attained the kind of respect and long-lasting effect on history, society, and culture as Aquino did, having actually been referred to as ‘‘Cory Magic.’’ It is recognition that Aquino’s was one of a transition presidency, having successfully reestablished the infra- structure for democracy, which paved the way for the peaceful entry of a new administration in a better position to steer the country to economic recovery. Unlike other developing nations that have suffered from dictatorships and other manifestations of instability, the Philippine experience since the Aquino administration has largely been fairly stable in the context of the plight of the\n\n94. developing world. For years, even after Aquino stepped down in 1992, people continued to look upon her for direction, advice, and aid. Throughout her tumultuous tenure and amidst growing discontent over failed expec- tations, the public’s perception of Cory Aquino hardly changed. She was still the honest and humble public ser- vant who constantly fought and attempted to survive the warring interests of politics and the economy. Her char- acter, reflected in her traits, behavior, and virtues, enabled a country and its people to mobilize against any threat to that freedom and democracy that she helped restore. While the country that Aquino and her husband fought for remains under constant threat from the same dirty pol- itics and threats to freedom and democracy in the dark days of the Marcos regime, a consistent force, symbol, and memory has remained as a constant source of inspiration and fire for the Filipino, often invoking her memory and symbol to try to get the country on track, in the tradition of\n\n95. the bloodless, peaceful, and religiously inspired revolt Aquino inspired in 1986. Since that fateful day in 1983, a simple woman was thrust into a life of unending responsibility; but she came through and helped give the Filipino something truly worth fighting for. With every wrong thing that has happened to Philippine society and politics, one who is perhaps the mother of her democracy has managed to make the case for truth and love as another great leader in India once did. Through her life and example, perhaps business leaders can better understand the missing ingredients in their plight to discover the true meaning of ethical leadership, beyond traditional strategies and tactics following the path and formula of the bottom line while achieving the effect of greatness that will eventually ensure a fat bottom line. While companies insist on strategic planning, managers too need a kind of personal strategic planning especially in the context of self-leadership. Through the idea of servant\n\n96. leadership and the person of Aquino, we propose that businesses understand, develop, and sustain an interior life defined by the development and practice of virtues. As a result, the sense of community and societal concern pre- valent in business’s corporate social responsibility and social marketing slogans may have a more authentic and thus, effective and long-lasting result.
