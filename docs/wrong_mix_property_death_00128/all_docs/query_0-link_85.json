This has resulted in broken institutions, poverty, mistrust of government among citizens, and abuse of the underprivileged. A vacuum of moral leadership in critical areas of national life is impeding the country’s progress.\n\n“We have been truly blessed these past two years of implementing our core youth formation program,” NCAF President and Executive Director Rafael C. Lopa says. “It is humbling for us in the Foundation to have growing nucleus of almost 200 young, promising Filipino youth leaders.”\n\nLast February 2012, NCAF and NCACL partnered with ADZU for the first regional Journey run in Western Mindanao.\n\n“We are very grateful for the immense support of ADZU, ZAMBASULTAPS and CEAP IX in implementing the program,” NCAF President and Executive Director Rafael C. Lopa says. “Through this partnership, we hope to engage more young Western Mindanao youth leaders to live a life of service and love.”\n\nUsing Ninoy and Cory Aquino as role models, the program seeks to reintroduce spirituality as a major foundation for Filipino leadership. Harnessing their innate values systems, the participants take part in a process of self-reflection that will ultimately lead to self-transformation and self-commitment for others and country.\n\nTogether with program partners, Cebu Pacific Air and White Knight Hotel Intramuros, the program invites the youth leaders to undergo a 3-day transformative experience and be living witnesses of leadership. It is the hope of the Foundation that the young persons will be moved to commit to a life of service and mission through effective and impactful community work. The objectives of the program are:\n\nTo reintroduce models of leadership based from the lives of Ninoy and Cory Aquino\n\nTo realize that spirituality, faith and love are values that anchor one’s life\n\nTo build communal experiences in spirituality with other youth leaders\n\nTo respond to a life of love through the call for action\n\nTo appreciate a life of sacrifice that is deeply rooted in one’s faith\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Leadership Journey is open to all Filipino citizens residing in Western Mindanao, 18 – 21 yrs. old, and at least a college sophomore (or the equivalent) at the time of the application period.\n\nInterested applicants may contact the following:\n\nMs. Annie Ebreo, Coordinator\n\nZamboanga Basilan Sulu Tawi-Tawi Association of Private Schools (ZAMBASULTAPS) /\n\nCatholic Educational Association of the Philippines-Region 9 (CEAP-IX)\n\nc/o Projects Office, Ateneo de Zamboanga University\n\nLa Purisima St., Zamboanga City\n\nTel No. (62)991.0871 Loc. 1004\n\nOr\n\nMs. Mikhaella Millar, Ninoy and Cory Aquino Leadership Journey Secretariat\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation\n\n5/F Jose Cojuangco and Sons Building\n\n119 Dela Rosa corner Castro Sts.\n\n1229 Legaspi Village, Makati City\n\nRepublic of the Philippines\n\nTel Nos.

Lopa, NCAF President and Executive Director. “They symbolize a new generation of Filipinos rooted in love and committed to God, country, and their fellowmen.”\n\nThe Ninoy & Cory Aquino Leadership Journey, touted as one of the more transformative programs for the youth in the country, is a partnership among the Ninoy & Cory Aquino Center for Leadership (NCACL), the Ninoy & Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF), the Ang-Hortaleza Foundation, White Knight Hotel Intramuros and Cebu Pacific Air.\n\nUsing Ninoy and Cory Aquino as role models, the program seeks to reintroduce spirituality as a major foundation for Filipino leadership.

It’s really different from the usual leadership camps that students, like me, usually attend to,” Jomar Tito, Batch 7 graduate shared. “The Journey will help you understand yourself and the true desires of your heart – your calling.”\n\n“We were deeply touched by God’s love through the NCALJ program and its people. It honestly changed me personally, my perspective towards life, family, responsibilities toward the community and most of all, of God,” Karla Co, Batch 7 graduate narrated.\n\n“It was a privilege for us to have partnered with DLSU-Dasmariñas in organizing the first CALABARZON run of the Journey program,” said Rafael C.

Lopa announced. “The safety of everyone is more important at this point.” The NCA Leadership Journey Batch 7 was supposed to commence this weekend with twenty-eight young leaders from CALABARZON as participants.\n\n“Part of the call to leadership is to be at the forefront of helping our fellow Filipinos in distress,” Lopa reiterated. “Right now, the need is to address the families who were flooded and have lost their homes due to the floods. Unfortunately, some of our young people and their families have been devastated too.”\n\nDrawing insights from the lives of the beloved Aquino couple, the leadership program seeks to reintroduce spirituality as a major foundation for Filipino leadership. Harnessing their innate values systems, the participants take part in a process of self-reflection which, it is hoped, would ultimately lead to commitment for others and country. The NCA Leadership Journey, touted as one of the more transformative programs available, has already provided a unique and life-changing experience to six (6) batches of student-leaders nationwide.\n\n“Our Journey graduates are now in their respective schools doing relief operations – De La Salle University system, Manila Tatyana Colleges, St. Paul University, Ateneo de Manila University, Xavier School, etc.,” Lopa shared. “We are now asking everyone to join the different relief operations, and gather what they can donate. We need all the help that we can get.”\n\nTogether with program partners, Cebu Pacific Air, the Official Air Carrier, and White Knight Hotel Intramuros, the Official Manila Residence, the program invites the youth leaders to undergo the three-day leadership retreat and be living witnesses of leadership. It is the hope of the Foundation that the “Journey-ers” will be moved to commit to a life of mission through effective and impactful community work.\n\nReference: https://ncaleadershipjourney.wordpress.com/\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF) and the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Center for Leadership (NCACL), in partnership with De La Salle University-Dasmariñas (DLSU-D), are proud to announce the seventh batch of candidates to its youth leadership program, the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Leadership Journey on August 10-12, 2012.\n\nDrawing insights from the lives of the beloved Aquino couple, the program seeks to reintroduce spirituality as a major foundation for Filipino leadership.
