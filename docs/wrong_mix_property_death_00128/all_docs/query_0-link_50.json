        "text": "The Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation calls for applications to its youth leadership program, the Ninoy and Cory Aquino Leadership Journey, which will be on November 19-21, 2010 at the Aquino Center, Tarlac.\n\nIn the Philippines today, there is an underlying culture of patronage, corruption and deceit. This has resulted in broken institutions, poverty, mistrust of government among citizens, and abuse of the underprivileged. A vacuum of moral leadership in critical areas of national life is impeding the country’s progress.\n\n“It’s time to build a new nucleus of a new generation of leaders that are grounded on spirituality,” NCAF Executive Director Rafael C. Lopa says. “From these young people, we can hopefully transform Philippine society.”\n\nUsing Ninoy and Cory Aquino as role models, the program seeks to reintroduce spirituality as a major foundation for Filipino leadership. Harnessing their innate values systems, the participants take part in a process of self-reflection that will ultimately lead to self-transformation and self-commitment for others and country.\n\n“Before Tita Cory got sick, I asked her what leadership values she wanted to impart to the next leaders of the country,” Lopa tells, “she said that in their (Ninoy and Cory) lives, it was faith in God that ultimately guided their lives.”\n\nThe program invites the youth leaders to undergo a 3-day transformative experience and be living witnesses of leadership. It is the hope of the foundation that the young persons will be moved to commit to a life of service and mission through effective and impactful community work. The objectives of the program are:\n\nTo reintroduce models of leadership based from the lives of Ninoy and Cory Aquino\n\nTo realize that spirituality, faith and love are values that anchor one’s life\n\nTo build communal experiences in spirituality with other youth leaders\n\nTo respond to a life of love through the call for action\n\nTo appreciate a life of sacrifice that is deeply rooted in one’s faith\n\nThe NCA Leadership Journey is open to all young Filipino citizens residing in the Philippines, 18 – 25 yrs. old, and at least a college sophomore (or the equivalent) at the time of the application period. He/she should be a current youth leader, has a passion for excellence and public service and has the ability to communicate well.\n\nInterested applicants may call up (02)892.5360 and (02)892.2950 or email ncaleadershipjourney@gmail.com. Application forms are to be sent to the following address:\n\niamninoy-iamcory Secretariat\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation\n\n4/F Jose Cojuangco and Sons Building\n\n119 Dela Rosa cor. Castro Streets, Legazpi Village, Makati City\n\nDeadline of application forms is on October 29, 2010, Firiday, 5:00 pm. Based from all the application forms submitted, NCAF will select the Top 30 applicants who will participate in the NCA Leadership Journey (Batch 1) on November 19-21, 2010 at the Aquino Center, Tarlac.\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation\n\nThe Ninoy and Cory Aquino Foundation (NCAF) traces its roots to the Benigno S. Aquino, Jr. Foundation (BSAF), established by the late Senator’s widow in November 1983 to perpetuate his legacy. Its activities were limited during the tumultuous years following Ninoy Aquino’s assassination and after Mrs. Aquino ascended to the presidency in February 1986.\n\nWhen President Cory’s term ended, BSAF became her primary vehicle for continuing to engage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and people’s organizations (POs) that played a key role in empowering communities and reviving democratic institutions alongside her administration.\n\nWith the help of donor groups, BSAF, through the Institute for People Power and Development (IPPD), supported programs to strengthen cooperatives, human rights education among law enforcers, and microfinance institutions. The Foundation also used part of its endowment fund to grant scholarships to poor but deserving students, to sponsor occasional symposia on democratic themes, and to give recognition to exemplary individuals and groups, which were dubbed as “People Power People”.\n\nOn August 21, 2008, BSAF launched the iamninoy campaign with the help of creative and merchandise partners to introduce Ninoy Aquino to new generations of Filipinos as a fitting commemoration of his 25th death anniversary. Using the senator’s iconic eyeglasses as its visual signature, the campaign invited young Filipinos to look at society “through Ninoy’s eyes” and to surface the selfless hero inside them. The youth embraced the campaign, helping various advocacies and beneficiaries by buying iamninoy merchandise, expressing their selflessness in myriad ways on- and off-line, and doing volunteer work.\n\nA few months after President Cory passed away in August 2009, the Foundation came to be known as NCAF and the highly successful campaign was elevated into the iamninoy-iamcory Movement. As NCAF’s core youth mobilization and empowerment program, carried out in cooperation with various partners and networks, the movement envisions a more just, humane, equitable and sustainable society where the youth is empowered to play a central role in its realization. Its mission is to surface a new generation of Filipinos who are willing to step up as selfless heroes in their own right. From their ranks will emerge youth leaders who can realize their full potential through a process of spiritual transformation in the mold of Ninoy and Cory Aquino.\n\nToday, NCAF seeks to build on the legacy of Ninoy and Cory by supporting activities that embody the spirit of People Power as a strong and positive force for social change in a robust democracy."
