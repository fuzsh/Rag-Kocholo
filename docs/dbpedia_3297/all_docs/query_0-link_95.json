        "text": "As a DXer, traveling is a fun way to see and hear what the radio dial is like in other areas. Ocean City, MD was a common vacation spot for my family. I visited the town twice as a child. At 80-120 miles away from my home, Ocean City’s local FM signals (many based out of nearby Salisbury, MD) often pound into my radios every summer night with local grade reception. Even so, Ocean City was the last remaining major market within driving distance that I did not have a travel DX log from, until my most recent visit in 2020.\n\nOcean City has an insane amount of format flips on its FM dial–a handful every year. The flips are usually minor, such as shuffling a callsign from one frequency to another, or realigning a simulcast, changing the frequencies that the format is heard on. Even so, it makes DXing interesting because there’s always something new to hear from the market. For example, a classic country simulcast was first logged on 87.7/101.5 FM in 2017, only to move to 87.7/99.3 FM a year later. During my 2020 visit, the signal added a 101.1 FM repeater and now only IDs on-air as 99.3/101.1 FM. The market’s WKHI callsign was logged on 107.5, 107.7, and 94.9 FM over the past 21 years from my home. 94.9’s former callsign, WAMS, was on 101.1 at one point. 97.5’s former WICO callsign is now on 101.1 FM.\n\nA refreshing note is that HD Radio is rare in Ocean City–only two of its local stations broadcast the service. This usually means the dial is wide open to coastal DX from Norfolk, VA to central New Jersey on a normal night. Surprisingly, my local Washington, DC signals–at about 90 miles away–were largely absent during my visit, even with some enhanced tropo.\n\nPage last updated: 2/18/2020"
