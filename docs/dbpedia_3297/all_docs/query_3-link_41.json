        "text": "ORIGIN & FUNCTIONS\n\nThe University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is the research doctoral-granting institution on the Eastern Shore and, since 1890, it has been the land-grant campus of the State. Instruction, research, and service are provided through major academic clusters. These clusters include liberal arts and sciences, agriculture, business, engineering and technology, education, marine and environmental sciences, allied health, hospitality, and special academic services. Degrees are offered in thirty-eight bachelor, fourteen masters, and eight doctoral programs. Some distinctive bachelor degree programs are Agribusiness, Aviation Science, Construction Management, Criminal Justice, Engineering Technology, Environmental Science, Golf Management, Hospitality and Tourism Management, and Rehabilitation Services. Master degrees are offered in Agriculture and Extension Education, Applied Computer Science, Cybersecurity Engineering Technology, Food and Agricultural Sciences, Guidance and Counseling, and Special Education. Doctoral and master degrees are granted in Marine-Estuarine-Environmental Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Toxicology.\n\nBasic and applied research covers International and Domestic Agriculture Sciences, Marine and Environmental Sciences, and Computer and Mathematical Sciences. Professional accreditation includes Chemistry (ACS); Construction Management (ACCE); Education (NCATE); Human Ecology (ADA); Physical Therapy (CAPTE); and Rehabilitation Service (NCRE). The University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\nThe Eastern Shore campus of the University System of Maryland had diverse affiliations and several names before becoming the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) at Princess Anne in 1970. The institution was founded in 1886 by the leaders of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church as the Delaware Conference Academy for Negroes, under the general control of Centenary Bible Institute in Baltimore. By the second Morrill Act of 1890, the Academy received federal funds and was renamed the Princess Anne Academy. This funding created a relationship with the then Maryland Agricultural College, although the campus continued to be a part of Morgan College, at the time, a private institution. College level work began at Princess Anne in 1927. The State authorized purchase of the Academy in 1935 (Chapter 548, Acts of 1935) and, in 1936, Princess Anne Academy became part of the University of Maryland, bearing the name of Maryland State College from 1948 until 1970. In 1970, the College was renamed University of Maryland Eastern Shore and, in 1988, it joined the University of Maryland System (Chapter 246, Acts of 1988). The System was renamed University System of Maryland in 1997 (Chapter 114, Acts of 1997).\n\nDIVISION OF ACADEMIC AFFAIRS\n\nWithin the Division of Academic Affairs are five schools: Agricultural and Natural Sciences; Business and Technology; Education, Social Sciences and the Arts; Graduate Studies; and Pharmacy and Health Professions.
