        "text": "personal electric vehicle\n\nnearly september\n\nkent wheeled.\n\nkent wheeled.\n\nkent wheeled.\n\ni met him in intro to excel spreadsheets. we were assigned together. group project. three of us. i don’t really remember the other guy. i think he was from wisconsin cause he wore a graphic t-shirt emblazoned with the punchline “milwaukee: the weak are killed and eaten” every three days. unlike kent, he was not gorgeous. kent was a conduit of atëian estate.\n\nhe was 6’1”, the thinking man’s 6’3”, mandorla’d by diarrhea blond hair, possessed by joints more lithely parabolic than marrowly geometric. when he first arc’d into class, i immediately succumbed to the pendulous aureole of his vibe. it was like humidity, or nitrous poisoning. pricks at the ends of my digits, lips, and gooch. this zandy[1] was obviously totally ignorant to the reality that motion isn’t simple. i loved how arrested i was by his not totally willful unknowing.\n\nit was the second week of class. he transferred in. he was so sexy for that.\n\nso early in the term and we were already doing group work. the professor was clearly going through divorce–marriage and average hair follicle count. i professed to myself, right there, furtively, that kent and i wouldn’t be like that, detached and/or thinned.\n\n—what’s kicks?\n\nkent’s introduction to me. he was so fucking stupid. immediate eros.\n\n—you couldn’t resist the call of data, huh?\n\ni thought that would be a bit more cordial than asking why you would voluntarily switch into a faux-stats course as dreadful as what surrounded us.\n\n—yeah i was in an intro to hobbes type beat class, but i decided that i would need these sheet skills to better articulate my own theories, but with something more real like integers. also, my dad said philosophy will make me talk like, ykno, one of them. i think he’s kind of a dickhead, but i’ll probably be working at his dealership this summer, so i can’t really not obey.\n\nhe didn’t elaborate on “one of them.” the median familial income of this college was like 200k a year, so i imagine he meant people with “gay voice” or “vaguely european voice.”\n\nhe was beautiful, and very obviously not a sans-culottes.\n\nthe other guy, the opaque goofball, interrupted.\n\n—yooooooooo, my dad also owns a dealership!\n\nright in october\n\nkent moved through gravity with the uprightness of an ex-boy who had never experienced anything worse than slightly grating. in practice, this meant he traveled by electric scooter, typically weaving right in the middles of sidewalks and roads and bike trails.\n\nmost locals would find this method of movement to be basically evil, but the suburbanity which pervaded our institution instead conditioned the student body to consider his obstructiveness an entrepreneurial virtue. the campusways were always marked by chains of biblically accurate leerings, enviously impressed pupils following his ladneuvers.\n\nin the 3 weeks since my first incitive encounter, we had become underclasspeers. not genuine friends yet, but about the closest a 19 year old could get in settings that operated according to the temporal strictures of icebreakers and ureagold malt liquor.\n\nwe would lap at coffees on friday afternoons. rather, i would suckle coffee. he would down a red bull and about 10 vanilla biscotti.\n\nhe scootered. i walked.\n\nwe’d complete our inane personal reflection assignments.\n\ni’d listen to the dada morse code of his typing.\n\ni’d sneak a look at his glabella wrinkle as he used ChattyPP to generate responses to his adviser’s emails.\n\nsometimes the tips of our doc martens would touch.\n\nduring one of our early semi-scholastic ctrl+v sessions, kent admitted he was a 20 year old freshman. he reveled in a gap year after graduating from some supermundal private high school in some tristate area. he mentioned either delaware or the delaware river.\n\n—it was so mint. haha. i was basically a gofer for appdevs that posted up in dublin. haha. cause the whole no tax shit. my dad and the dad of my boss played basketball together at the u of pitt. yeah haha. we’d do like 2.5 hour pub lunch breaks. i drank so much guiness. even if i was blindfolded, i could tell if a beer was a guiness. haha.\n\nhe spoke like the aftermath of a nasal irrigator: all greenboygush.\n\ni loved him because of dramatic irony. he didn’t know i was an audience. i knew he didn’t know he was an idiot. why did he have to be astute? maybe 15 students on campus had any facility. he was belligerently affable. when our spreadsheeter TA’s futilely referenced obama era sketch comedy shows that people barely gave a fuck about even then, he would almsgive them a genuinely well-meated chortle. he was charity in chinos.\n\n—what are you doing in a month?\n\nmy initial thought: following you around like someone who plausibly could have ended up as a serial killer, but never had a significant brain injury as a child. my second thought:\n\n—a month? i’d say psychically preparing myself for another unshunnable rochester thanksgiving.\n\n—oh toite. honestly, upstate new york gets haaaaaate, but lowkey i kind of fuck with it.\n\n—lol no. rochester, minnesota: the city “of care and innovation.”\n\nthe pique upon his batterhued cheeks intimated that he may have not been privy to the existence of the land of 10,000 lakes. a slight blip, but his embouchure confidently recoiled back into its standard sightly grin.\n\n—if you’re with it, the marketing students out of lautermilch hall are throwing a fundraiser rager just a little bit off campus. november 15. friday. it’s apparently national philanthropy day.\n\n—riverside north?\n\n—nonono. riveredge west.\n\n—oh, so it’s going to be especially bacchanal?\n\ni pronounced it as “buck-anal” just to see if kent would notice and correct me. he did not. awooga.\n\n—helllll yeah. one of the alpha lautermilcher’s dad is pretty high up at like wells fargo or bear stearns or something. daddy loanbucks. i think they use their dorm room as a gaming den and or a space for their peloton. they definitely live at a ritzo 2000 square footer on riveredge. by the park with all the lactating angel fountains.\n\n—i will slide through. but only if you won’t immediately abandon me to people that want to talk about how ai porn generator stocks are actually solid investments.\n\n—okayokayokay. i’ll deflect them for like??? 45 minutes???\n\nkent tautly smiled as if he was the first 20some to fathom up open mic standup tier quippage.\n\n—i’m in no position to reject a compromise.\n\noctober (late and ghoulish)\n\nin a cubicle, in the basement of the law library, i attempted to close read an assignment.[2] there were maybe 6 of us in the pits. law students rarely go downward.\n\ni feebly stared at my intro to psych reading about all the different types of pill shapes. i wasn’t looking at the words. i was looking at the font. no. i wasn’t looking at the font. i was looking at the curves of the letters. i was quasi-dreaming in between garamond jags.\n\nin my noonphasm, i envisioned kent’s thumbs and pointers morph into the convexes of e’s and n’s, only to then suddenly transmute into living gua sha scrapers. i felt the sturdy curl of his digits mercilessly rack my levator scapulae. this wasn’t a horny fantasy. or, it barely was. i really did have scholar neck. i really did want some capillaries to burst. i wanted him to know my growing kyphosis. but there were hurdles.\n\nfor the past two weeks, kent and i only had opportunities to chat during our spreadsheet class. this wasn’t symptomatic of some petty late teen faulting or anything jejunely asinine like that. while we were hitting the time of year underclasspersons realized the friends they made at gangrenously sweaty august mixers were actually grotesque chuds, we were actually just appropriately busy consorters. kent’s bruhful intrepidity had landed him treasurer of the campus extreme society.[3] i was working 12 hours a week as a dining hall janitor to pay off a workstudy loan and trying to finagle a radio show by volunteering myself to down another down into the station’s basement storage/arachnid graveyard. i invested a lot of my pupils into recording all the unregarded and unrespected ancient vinyl procured by past generations of scenesterian coeds.\n\nof course i missed being regularly proximate to the benign heat of his pancakemixhued flesh, but also, absence makes the heart get lit-er. if kayaking down polluted midwestern waterways of swine feces and gizzard shad corpses made him happy, then I was content too.\n\na sudden outburst:\n\n—SO RUNNNNN. RIGHT. RIGHT BACK TO SCHOOL.\n\na fauxgothboy scrambled to shove their headphones back into their macbook, the jack liberating dangleward like an athame.\n\na mangled ulna.\n\nand then the letters were normal.\n\nnational philanthropy day\n\ndoondoondoondoondoondoondoondoon\n\nbass drum tuned to d#. 138 bpm. mauve four x four to the pink floor. i am either at a college party or trapped in a bi tiktok otherworld.\n\n—do you kn~~ wes?\n\n—wes w~~?\n\ndoondoondoondoon\n\nimmersed in truculent volume. no decoding of speech here. one of kent’s bucolic hikehabituated familiars he dubbed “friend” attempted to chat. he had no name to me and i had no desire to discern if he was tedious or not.\n\n—wes wesm~r~land. th~~ i~ hi~ pad!\n\nhe looked like weekly world’s batboy, but with a vile herrenvolkish haircut.\n\n—oka~ yea~.\n\n—this place ~~ n~~e. i rea~~y l~ke it ~ere.\n\ndoondoondoondoon\n\n—y~~h ahu~.\n\nthe music nil’d us, consequently rousing the toothed lobes of my brain. fuck this dumb guy and his dumb head. he wasn’t kent.\n\ndoondoondoondoon\n\nout of the purplingness, i saw him strobe into our bluerasp sticky corner. the man with the frisian marauder jaw. kent oh kent oh kent. the basswall, however, millstoned my excitement. his typically staunch grin smirked itself with ethyl and woe.\n\n—yo ~~~~ wha~ it do?\n\n—hey m~~. ~t’s l~~d ~s ~hit.\n\n—his eyes looked like grapes just hankering to rot, but also under an industrial hydraulic press.\n\nhis mouth mawed. out gushed more green.\n\ndoondoondoondoon\n\n—thi~ seme~~er h~s ~een so toug~ d~de like i ca~~ot ev~n lie the spr~~dsheet cla~s is e~sy b~t ev~~ything e~se has b~~n disastrous my st~ts cou~se h~~ be~n absolutely f~~~~~g me i ju~t don’t get h~w to fine~~e numb~~s like th~t and hon~~tly my dad h~s ~~en threatening m~ with cutting ~~ off ~f i d~n’t g~t ~t least a 3.4 ~~~ this se~ester and like also i’~ sooooo p~nt up but som~h~w imp~rta~t[4] i was h~~king up with ~~~~~ l~~t night and i just could~~’t perform y~~ f~~l me it’s like everything is m~~~ment mo~~me~~ move~~~~"
