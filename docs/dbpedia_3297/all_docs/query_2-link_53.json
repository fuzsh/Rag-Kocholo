        "text": "Harmon is also a musician (drums and keyboard) and producer. His first radio hosting job was on college radio station WESM at University of Maryland Eastern Shore where he was a student. He went from there to WJDY in Salisbury, MD hosting on Sunday mornings. He went moved to hosting on the afternoon drive at both WDIH in Salisbury and WWIN in Baltimore. He landed with Washington, DC's Heaven 1580AM, a CBS radio station, next. Jaye graduated from Full Sail University with a bachelor's in music production and a master's in education business.\n\nWhen I asked about the state of the music business post the decline in record sales and increase in music streaming subscriptions, he said, \"It's so unfortunate for artists and writers (the pennies they get for music streaming royalties). It was presented in Congress how unfair it is.\"\n\nHarmon stated that Gospel is the smallest genre so it will take a high-profile artist in R&B to spearhead changes.\n\n\"...And they have to see a need for it,\" he pointed out. \"They are our (artists and writers) gatekeepers.\"\n\nJaye, as a daily afternoon-drive radio host at Heaven 1580/WPGC-AM (Washington, DC) garnered two Stellar Awards.\n\n\"We won the Stellar Award twice in a row. I was not just an announcer, I was also the imaging director,\" Harmon said when I asked about the Stellar wins. \"It was before FM Gospel became popular. We were #1 at the time. We had a sound that was like FM.\"\n\n\"They shut us down (in 2009) after that,\" he laughed a little. \"More money more problems.\"\n\nNow you can hear Jaye Harmon on DAF Entertainment's Gospel radio station for his \"Jaye Harmon's Top Gospel 30\" count-down. The DAF Entertainment Group was founded in 2016 out of Nashville, TN by Pastor Darion Freeman, and First Lady Adriann Lewis-Freeman to make a positive and spiritual contribution to the Gospel industry. The \"Jaye Harmon's Top Gospel 30\" count-down show is produced by his company JPE Media and can be heard on LP-FM stations WWDA 101.9 and WFTB 104.1 inspiring and uplifting listeners with Gospel songs once again.\n\nCurrently based in Atlanta, GA, Harmon's company JPE Media also produces voiceovers for audiobooks, documentaries, and other professional videos. www.JayezPadEnt.com www.DAFEntertainment.com/DAF-Gospel-Radio"
