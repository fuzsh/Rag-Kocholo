        "text": "BBC Radio 3 is a British radio network operated by the BBC. Its output centres on classical music and opera, but jazz, world music, drama, culture and the arts also feature. The station is the world’s most significant commissioner of new music, and through its New Generation Artists scheme promotes young musicians of all nationalities. The station is notable for its broadcast of the BBC Proms concerts, live and in full, each summer in addition to performances by the BBC Orchestras and Singers. There are regular productions of both classic plays and newly commissioned drama. Radio 3 won the Sony Radio Academy UK Station of the Year Gold Award for 2009 and was nominated again in 2011.\n\nCHLX-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts at 97.1 FM in Gatineau, Quebec. A francophone station owned by RNC Media, CHLX airs a mixed format of adult contemporary and jazz, branded as 97.1 Rythme FM. CHLX was licensed by the CRTC in 2001, and launched on September 23, 2002. It was briefly branded as Classique 97,1 before becoming Couleur FM, airing classical music. In 2008, after a license amendment was accepted by the CRTC, it became Planète 97,1, an adult contemporary-formatted station, with 20% of its airtime devoted to jazz. On July 11, 2014, it was announced that CHLX would flip to Hot AC as 97.1 Rythme FM on August 25th, as part of a licensing deal between Cogeco and RNC. CHLX became the first non-Cogeco station to carry the Rythme FM format. As of October 2014, it still broadcasts two hours a day of jazz music.\n\nRadio New Zealand Concert is a publicly funded non-commercial New Zealand FM fine music radio network owned and operated by Radio New Zealand from its Wellington headquarters. The network's playlist of classical, jazz, contemporary and world music includes an extensive and growing collection of original recordings of mostly local musicians and composers. Around 15 percent of its airtime is given over to live concerts, orchestral performances, operas, interviews, features and specialty music programmes, many of which are locally recorded. The network's specialist production department also commissions work, initiates music programmes, and records live broadcasts of concerts and recitals from local and visiting international artists. Radio New Zealand Concert is one of the few recipients to date of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Governor's Award - a rare honour bestowed on individuals and organisations that make a significant contribution to the arts in New Zealand. Radio New Zealand Concert also draws content from its international counterparts, including ABC Classic FM, the European Broadcasting Union, the WFMT Radio Network and BBC Radio 3."
