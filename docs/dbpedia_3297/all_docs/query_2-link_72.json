The third season launches Thursday Feb.2nd , on NPRMusic.org, YouTube and social media platforms, beginning with the young jazz sensation Samara Joy, a Grammy nominee and winner of the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition.\n\nNPRExtra\n\n2/23: NPR x Smithsonian Twitter Spaces conversation on The Black Press and how the press has been used as a tool of resistance.\n\nNPR One\n\nThe Black History Month collection features stories honoring Black history and culture from NPR podcasts and member stations across the country.\n\nPODCASTS:\n\nAlt.Latino\n\nThis month NPR's podcast exploring Latinx history and cultural context through music in a conversational way, will be focusing on music from Afro Latinx musicians. Let the chisme begin!\n\n2/1 - Cimafunk\n\nThe Cuban vocalist talks about his connection to the rich Afro Cuban culture that fuels his music and his identity.\n\n2/8 - Cuban Piano 101\n\nA short history of the Cuban piano style that is a perfect blend of European music and Afro Cuban rhythm.\n\n2/15 - Adrian Quesada\n\nDuring an interview with the prolific Austin based producer/musician, we hear about how Mexican and African American musicians created a distinct Texas soul sound in the years after WWII.\n\n2/22 - Smithsonian Afro Latino Musical Archives\n\nCelebrate Afro Latino music with a deep dive into The Smithsonian's Folkways record label and their collection of authentic folk music from various Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n\nThroughline:\n\n2/2: Black Panthers\n\nThe Black Panther Party's battles for social justice and economic equality are the centerpiece of the Oscar-nominated film 'Judas and The Black Messiah.' In 1968, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said the Black Panther Party \"without question, represents the greatest threat to internal security of the country.\" And with that declaration he used United States federal law enforcement to wage war on the group. But why did Hoover's FBI target the Black Panther Party more severely than any other Black power organization? Historian Donna Murch says the answer lies in the Panthers' political agenda and a strategy that challenged the very foundations of American society.\n\n2/23 : House Music\n\nEver since Beyonce's Renaissance dropped last summer, house music has found its way back to mainstream audiences prompting some to ask \"Is House back?,\" but the truth is it never went away. Born out of the ashes of disco in the warehouses of Chicago by Black queer youth in the late 70s and 80s, house music has been the continued soundtrack of parties around the world and laid the groundwork for the most popular musical genre in the world – electronic dance music. And yet, the deeper you dig into the origins of house music the more clear it becomes that the history of house, like the history of rock and roll, is a complicated tale of Black cultural resistance, musical migration and appropriation.\n\nCode Switch:\n\n2/8: NFL - Rooney Rule\n\nWhat does the Rooney Rule — the most high-profile diversity plan in US life — tell us about why DEI initiatives fail?\n\n2/22: Carter G. Woodson\n\nThis is the odd story of the descendants of Carter G. Woodson – father of Black history – and their relationship to the man whose ancestors enslaved their own. It will go into the limits of genealogy, the limits of apology and the strange ways that these relationships play out.\n\nIt's Been a Minute\n\n02/03: Look Back at Luther Vandross\n\nOn this episode, host Brittany Luse speaks to music journalist Craig Seymour about how Luther changed the sound of R&B, and how his imprint on the culture still shows up today.\n\nSamara Joy\n\nHow do you make music feel timeless as a Gen Z jazz singer? It's Been a Minute explores this question with jazz singer Samara Joy.\n\nBlack Archives\n\nIt's Been a Minute will feature Renata Cherlise, author and founder of Black Archives.\n\nShort Wave:\n\n2/1: Ancient Night Skies\n\nMoiya McTier talks with us about what night skies humans saw thousands of years ago and what mythologies emerged.\n\n2/7: Pulse Oximeter\n\nPulse oximeters are used to read blood oxygen levels and sometimes are used to determine if someone should be hospitalized. But they don't seem to work well on Black skin. Guest Kimani Toussaint is part of a lab that is working on technology to fix this issue.\n\n2/13: Crickets and Model Organisms\n\nCassandra Extavour is a leading biologist at Harvard who has upended several long-held evolutionary hypotheses. She thinks it's important for the field of biology to be focused on a diversity of model organisms, and she's a big fan of one in particular: crickets.\n\nSubatomic Music\n\nLearn about neutrinos and how neutrino physicist Teppei Katori was inspired to combine his passions for music and physics, resulting in an unlikely musical instrument.\n\nAustralian Tomato\n\nTanisha Williams, a botanist, plant ecologist and co-founder of #BlackBotanistsWeek, returns to Short Wave to discuss her team's discovery of the Garrarnawun Bush Tomato (Solanum scalarium) - a previously undocumented plant in the Australian Outback that was growing in plain sight.\n\nTed Radio Hour\n\nThe Three Mothers\n\nMLK Jr., Malcolm X and James Baldwin are household names, but what about their mothers? This hour, author Anna Malaika Tubbs explores how these three women shaped American history.\n\nRADIO:\n\nMorning Edition\n\n2/1: The Woodsons:\n\nAn American story if there ever was one. The story of Carter G. Woodson, the founder of Black History Week, and his white slave-holding ancestors and their reconciliation.\n\n2/2: Bruce's Beach\n\nActivists aren't so happy with the Black family that got their stolen beach returned, then turned around and sold it back to LA for $20 million.\n\nREAD:\n\n2/1 Ya Books Roundup:\n\n5 Winter 2023 Contemporary YA Novels about Identity and Overcoming Hardship\n\n2/2 Book Review: Black on Black\n\nDaniel Black's Black on Black: On Our Resilience and Brilliance in America is a collection of essays that dig deep into Blackness, history, and racial tension in this country, while simultaneously serving as a powerful call to action and a celebration of Black culture.\n\nFind your Member station's Black History Month coverage here:\n\nHouston Public Media\n\nLakeshore Public Media\n\nWNYC\n\nWKAR\n\nWKMS\n\nWABE\n\nHBCU Member Stations\n\nDid you know that there are many NPR Member stations who are licensed to HBCUs?
