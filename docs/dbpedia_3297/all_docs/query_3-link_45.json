        "text": "(Atlanta, GA) – March 5, 2024 – Washington, DC’s Gospel music lovers remember tuning in to the Afternoon Drive-time Show on the Stellar Award-winning Heaven 1580/WPGC-AM to get their daily dose of inspiration. In addition to hearing great Gospel music during the ride home, listeners also heard the smooth, captivating voice of Jaye Harmon. The veteran announcer was a favorite among area announcers and amassed a huge following while there. Although Heaven 1580 shuttered its doors in 2009, Harmon has continued making an impact in Gospel music. He recently prepped a new 2-hour Gospel countdown show called “Jaye Harmon’s TG 30.”\n\nProduced by Harmon’s own JPE Media, the new show debuted on DAF Gospel Radio at DAFEntertainment.com on Sunday, March 3, 2024. Airing weekly at 5:00 PM, 11:00 PM, and 3:00 AM ET, the program will highlight both indie and major label artists impacting Gospel radio. Airing popular, inspirational music, the show features interviews during the “Indie Artist Spotlight” segment. In addition to DAF Gospel Radio, listeners can also tune in to the show on LP-FM stations, WWDA 101.9 and WFTB 104.1.\n\nThe new program is a high point in Harmon’s radio career. His launch into radio began as a student at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne, Maryland. His passion for media was ignited there, and eventually, he was hired at his college radio station, WESM. He first “cracked the mic” there, but gained his first Sunday morning Gospel show at WJDY in Salisbury, MD. He was later positioned as an afternoon drive-time host at both WDIH in Salisbury and WWIN in Baltimore. Eventually, he landed at Washington, DC’s Heaven 1580AM, a CBS Radio station, also showcasing his talent during the afternoon drive-time show.\n\nA musician at heart, Harmon is a drummer, keyboardist, producer, and former choir director. He is also a graduate of Full Sail University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Music Production and a Master’s Degree in Entertainment Business. The owner of JPE Media, Harmon heads a full-service media production company specializing in voiceover and imaging for terrestrial and internet radio stations. Based in Atlanta, JPE Media also produces voiceovers for church videos, audiobooks, and documentaries. The company also offers video production services for social media promotions to a variety of businesses and organizations."
