        "text": "History of the Louvre\n\n... one of the world's largest museums, the most visited art museum in the world and a historic monument. A central landmark of Paris, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the 1st arrondissement (district).\n\nThe museum is housed in the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) which began as a fortress built in the late 12th century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace.\n\nIn 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of antique sculpture.\n\nDuring the French Revolution [1789–1799], the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum, to display the nation's masterpieces.\n\nThe size of the collection increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed the Musée Napoléon. After the defeat of Napoléon at Waterloo, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners.\n\nThe collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces.\n\n- Wikipedia (Jan. 2012)\n\nThe Louvre Museum in Paris is laid out into four sections or wings, each of which serves its own purpose. The heart of the Louvre Museum is the Carrousel du Louvre which is where the famous glass pyramid... is located. This pyramid was designed by the American architect I.M. Pei [and finished in 1989].\n\nThe Dennon section of the Louvre Museum Paris is a 500 meter long hall with rooms branching off it that runs parallel to the river Seine. The Richelieu wing of the Louvre is situated adjacent to the Rue de Rivoli, while the Sully end of the Louvre Museum forms the eastern part of the museum.\n\n- Country Facts (Jan. 2012)\n\nThe Louvre was created in several phases. Originally built as a 12th century fortress, it was converted into a royal palace in the 14th century.\n\nIts current appearance goes back to the 15th century, when the original fortress was demolished and the wing along the Seine river was built. The palace was extended during the 16th century by architect Pierre Lescot, who expanded the palace into a complex with two courtyards. A decade later Catharina de Medici added the Tuileries palace to the west of the Louvre. Construction on the Louvre was halted for some time when King Louis XIV decided to move to the Versailles Palace.\n\nIn the 19th century, during the Second Empire, the Louvre was expanded again with the addition of the Richelieu wing.\n\nThe Louvre now had four symmetric wings surrounding a large courtyard. This would not last long, as the Communards burned the Tuileries palace in 1871, opening up the west side of the palace.\n\nThe collection of the Louvre Museum was first established in the 16th century by King Francis I. One of the works of art he purchased was the now famous \"Mona Lisa\" painting. The collection grew steadily thanks to donations and purchases by the kings. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the private royal collection opened to the public.\n\nThe most recent addition to the Louvre was the construction of the glass pyramid, which functions as the museum's main entrance. The pyramid was built in 1989 by the renowned American architect I.M. Pei. The glass pyramid allows the sunlight to come in on the underground floor.\n\n- A View on Cities (Jan. 2012)"
