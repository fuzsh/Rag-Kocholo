A vast program of exhibitions, events and artistic activities is also offered throughout the year.\n\nProjects That U.S. Donors Can Support\n\nThe support of companies, foundations and individual donors is essential for Paris Musées to achieve its public-interest goals, and to pursue its commitment to sharing its collections and exhibitions with all audiences. The three main missions of Paris Musées that U.S. donors can support are :\n\nTo enrich and preserve collections, particularly through digitization, research development, and organizing events.\n\nPlanning of exhibitions and producing prestigious publications, which contribute to the cultural richness of the capital and its national and international influence.\n\nAttracting new visitors through an enriched educational program and increased attention to visitor comfort and cultural mediation.\n\nPhoto Credits, top-to-bottom and left-to-right: Musée Carnavalet-History of Paris © JB Gurliat; Sculpture workshop of the Musée Bourdelle ©Pierre Antoine; Musée Bourdelle © Laurent Bourgogne; Entrance hall of the Petit Palais – Museum of Fine Arts of the City of Paris ©Pierre Antoine; Evening gown, known as the “lily gown,” Worth, worn by Countess Greffulhe, Palais Galliera Museum of Fashion of the City of Paris © All rights reserved; Catacombs of Paris ©A.
