        "text": "Come and meet the extinct animals.\n\nIn June 2021, SAOLA Studio presents REVIVRE, its first immersive experience project in augmented reality, in collaboration with the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) in Paris.\n\nREVIVRE will subsequently be, and for our greatest pride, integrated into the permanent collection of the museum.\n\nFollowing this exceptional experience, we have built a solid relationship with the MNHN, based on the complementarity of our skills. We also benefited from the expertise of the MNHN scientific committee, which was able to validate the relevance and accuracy of our content for this exhibition.\n\nThrough this unique augmented reality experience, visitors become aware of the extraordinary species that once walked on the same ground as us, some of them that our ancestors encountered.\n\nEquipped with AR smartglasses, visitors will be able to see these fantastic animals in total immersion, moving around before their eyes, for the first time since their extinction. Their fascinating behavior and dimensions being recreated and animated by our parisian studio of augmented creation.\n\nOur project, with its potential and its technology, has already received the endorsement of a world-famous institution anchored in Paris: the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nLocated in the middle of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris’ 5th arrondissement, REVIVRE now takes place in the Hall of endangered and extinct species, along with the 7 000 specimens of the Great Gallery of Evolution.\n\nFrom one land to another, visitors will become the witnesses of a most unusual revival. The dodo from the island of Mauritius, the Steller's sea cow, the Great auk from the waters of North Atlantic. While these species are no longer from this world, other ones like the surprising helmeted hornbill, living in the forests of Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar, can still be saved.\n\nREVIVRE also aims to raise awareness before its public through this immersive exhibition in augmented reality. So that the list of extinct species stops growing day after day.\n\nWould you like to see the Revivre exhibition with your own eyes ? Follow the link below to access the official website of the National Museum of Natural History as well as the exhibition ticket office ! The entry ticket can be reserved by selecting REVIVRE as well as your time slot via the Museum's online ticket office, or directly at the reception of the Grande Galerie de l'Evolution of the National Museum of Natural History (located in the Jardin des Plantes), in Paris.\n\nYou are a professional in cultural mediation (or other) and you are interested in going behind the scenes of Revivre ? We would be happy to discuss with you about this, so don't hesitate to contact us ! If this exhibition inspires you, we can think together about a similar project for your own institution. In the meantime, come and discover our page dedicated to the creation of new projects in augmented reality !"
