        "text": "The Chilean National Museum of Natural History, one of the three national museums in Chile, is situated in Quinta Normal Park. This museum, founded in 1830, is one of the oldest natural history museums in South America. It was established with a focus on the biology and geography of Chile, particularly its crops and mineral resources.\n\nPermanent Exhibits at the Museum\n\nThe museum houses twelve permanent exhibits, which include the oldest mummies in the world, estimated to be around 7400 years old, and a collection of molluscs from Chile and other parts of the world. The mummies were preserved by the Chinchorro people of Chile, and scientists are still studying their preservation techniques. The mollusc collection has been assembled since the beginning of the study of the natural history of Chile."
