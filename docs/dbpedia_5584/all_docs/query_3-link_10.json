        "text": "Paris - 7th arrondissement\n\n'PALAIS-BOURBON' (75007)\n\nIf you want a quick introduction to the 7th arrondissement of Paris check out the video above which is one of Jay Swanson's 20 in 20 days series - hope you enjoy it!\n\nThe 7th arrondissement of Paris takes its name from the French National Assembly which sits on the south bank of the river Seine. It is home to its most iconic landmark, the Eiffel Tower​ but it is also contains Les Invalides, Napoleon's Tomb, the Musée Rodin, the Musée du Quai Branly, Les Égouts de Paris and one of our favourites the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nWalking through this neighbourhood you certainly know you are in Paris, with the river Seine as its northern boundary and the tower making its appearance at every turn, you couldn’t be anywhere else. It is also blessed with many beautiful green spaces with the Champs de Mars offering an ideal location for catching your breath or taking a picnic.\n\nMAIN ATTRACTIONS IN THE 7th ARRONDISSEMENT\n\nHere are some of the most popular things to do and see in the 7th district of Paris\n\nWe have probably walked most of the streets in this arrondissement at some time or other but are still drawn to it on every visit we make. Although the area contains very few shopping opportunities, it is largely made up of government buildings, it caters for visitors needing a shopping fix in the form of one of Paris’ most famous department stores, Le Bon Marché which is located on its fringe.\n\nWould we stay here? Oh that we could...this is probably the most expensive area for hotels and apartments for obvious reasons, that view of the tower and river and is popular with 'world travellers' on a big budget. There are some budget hotels in the area but they probably won't include much of a view. You can check out what's available by clicking the link below."
