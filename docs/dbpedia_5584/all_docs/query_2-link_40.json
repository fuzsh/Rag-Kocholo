        "text": "4.8K\n\nMy apologies for the sporadic posting on the blog this past week … my computer had the hiccups!\n\nHere a little late, is the next step in my whistle stop tour of Paris. As always, it is by no means an exhaustive list of things to do or see, but just a few ideas to add to your bucket list.\n\nThe fifth arrondissement of Paris runs the length of the river on the left bank. It is the arrondissement traditionally associated with the best schools and universities of the city.\n\nIn no particular order my recommendations would be to wander down the rue Mouffetard and enjoy the market stalls and quirky mix of hardware stores, little restaurants and food stores.\n\nIf the market gives you an appetite, there is no shortage of good places to eat. The best meal I have had in Paris was enjoyed at La Méditerranée , place du Pantheon\n\nor if you want something a little less grand then you may try Le Reminet\n\nIf you are after some culture and history and you would prefer to avoid the busy museums, then step inside the 16th century St Etienne du Mont church, place Ste Genevieve and admire the stunning architecture, in particular this choir gallery\n\nIf you are visiting Paris with children, then the Natural History Museum, with its small zoo and perfectly maintained gardens will keep everyone happy for an afternoon.\n\nAnd my recommendation for a place to stay in the 5th arrondissement would be the beautifully designed and well positioned Hotel du Pantheon, from where you can visit a good part of Paris on foot.\n\nIf you missed them, here are my step-by-steps around the other arrondissements so far:"
