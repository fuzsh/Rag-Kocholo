We will earn a commission if you book via the links below, but this never affects our rating.\n\nOur expert writers are usually hosted on a complimentary basis in order to gain the first-hand experience necessary for their review.\n\nParis is not so much a city as a collection of villages, each one with its own distinct character and feel. Parisians are very attached to their quartiers and will invariably tell you that their local bakery, cheesemonger or bistro is the best in town. As a visitor to the city, you get to choose where you want to become a temporary resident, and there truly is an area to suit every taste.\n\nOpt for the winding cobbled backstreets of Montmartre, or the grandeur of the city centre. Stay among the hotpotch of antique book-sellers and chic designer stores in Saint-Germain, or right among the reinvented dive bars in trendy Pigalle. Indulge your inner intellectual amid the historic architecture of the Latin Quarter, or drink in the unique mix of old and new in the Marais. Here's our guide to where to stay in Paris.\n\nHow we review\n\nEvery hotel in this curated list has been visited by one of our expert reviewers, who are usually hosted on a complimentary basis. They stay for a minimum of one night, test at least one meal and trial other experiences that the hotel might have to offer.\n\nAt a glance, the best hotels to stay in Paris by area\n\nBest hotel to stay in St-Germain des Près – Hôtel Lutetia\n\nBest hotel to stay in Louvre & Jardin des Tuileries – Le Meurice\n\nBest hotel to stay in Champs-Elysées & Grands Boulevards – Le Bristol\n\nBest hotel to stay in Montmartre & Pigalle – Maison Souquet\n\nBest hotel to stay in Le Marais & Bastille – Caron de Beaumarchais\n\nBest hotel to stay in the Latin Quarter – Hôtel les Dames du Panthéon\n\nBest hotel to stay in Gare Du Nord & Strasbourg Saint-Denis – Hotel Les Deux Gares\n\nLouvre & Jardin des Tuileries\n\nOnly smart people stay in this sophisticated part of Paris, embracing the seriously posh 1st arrondissement on the right bank of the Seine – this is the best location to stay in Paris if you want to be central. The Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, Cathédrale de Notre Dame and Centre Pompidou are easy strolling distance and the pristine pea-green lawns of the 17th-century Tuileries gardens – laid out in 1664 by André Le Nôtre of Versailles fame – is the height of urban zen. Fashionable cafés and restaurants (Telescope, Verjus, Le Grand Véfour) cluster around the graceful Jardin du Palais Royal.\n\nWhere to stay in Louvre & Jardin des Tuileries\n\nLe Meurice, located on the doorstep of the Tuileries Gardens, has been welcoming distinguished guests for almost 200 years, and today its Versailles-style grandeur still attracts the glitterati. The exquisite food offering is elaborate yet hearty, and rooms are simultaneously grand and homely.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,453\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nIf this hotel seems familiar, you're onto something. It shares a cobblestone courtyard with Savoir, the fictional marketing agency featured in the popular Netflix series Emily in Paris.

Expect crisp, modern rooms and a refreshingly low-key approach to luxury in a landmark building dating back to 1855.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 473\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nChamps-Elysées & Grands Boulevards\n\nLuxury shopping is the lure of this well-heeled district, a classy cocktail of haute couture fashion houses, glitzy nightlife and celebrity chef kitchens in the central 8th and 9th arrondissements. The mythical avenue des Champs-Elysées is its linchpin and the Arc de Triomphe, at its western end, is the spot to get an aerial bird’s eye view (count 284 steps to the top). Other major sights include Grand Palais, the Palais Garnier opera house, the super-swish Place Vendôme and Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré for designer boutiques.\n\nWhere to stay in Champs-Elysées & Grands Boulevards\n\nInterior designer Dorothée Meilichzon found inspiration in an 18th-century French queen for the styling of this chic hotel in the 2nd Arrondissement. A hidden courtyard, Franco-Italian cuisine, a cocktail bar and soigné rooftop are highlights at this understatedly glam offering from Paris’ wildly successful Experimental Group.\n\nRead expert review\n\nRooms from £ 269\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis den of old-school opulence was the city’s first hotel to be designated a ‘Palace’ (a class above five star). You’ll see the exception in the fine furnishings of the grand salons, the warm welcome à l'ancienne, the facilities (especially the covered rooftop pool) and Michelin dining options.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,556\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis is one of Paris's most ostentatious and unabashedly opulent hotels, and offers one of the city's most iconic views from its carnation-adorned balconies. Expect glamorous surroundings and excellent food served in theatrical style (and yes, it's the one from Sex and the City).\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,641\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis family-run five-star hotel – once frequented by Lauren Bacall and Gene Kelly – is a delightful hidden gem. Decorated in quintessentially French style, it is at once luxurious and intimate. Expect fine design, courtesy of Pierre-Yves Rochon, personalised and discreet service and an outstanding location.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 534\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nA blue and white striped façade sets the theme for this buzzy lifestyle hotel that celebrates French joie de vivre. Designer suites pay homage to Serge Gainsbourg and Edith Piaf and the laidback restaurant is a local hotspot thanks to music events, stand-up comedy and, of course, its culinary offering showcasing exceptional local products.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 238\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nMontmartre & Pigalle\n\nLaced with enchanting old-world alleys and romantic cobbled lanes, the fabled hilltop quartier of Montmartre (18e arrondissement) is the stuff of movies: the 2001 French comedy Amélie was filmed here and staying in this quaint, village-like hood feels just like being on set. Visiting the Sacre Coeur, Musée du Montmartre where Renoir had a studio and the Clos de Montmartre vineyards – all doable on foot – are essentials. Down the hill in the 9e arrondissement, raunchy cabarets and peep shows mingle with hip new drinking and dining addresses in edgy ‘n upcoming SoPi or South Pigalle.\n\nWhere to stay in Montmartre & Pigalle\n\nThis hidden 19th-century mansion, bejewelled with a bucolic walled garden in hilltop Montmartre, is the last word in Parisian chic (not to mention romance). Suites are spacious and eclectic, and the fashionable cocktail bar and restaurant, with dreamy summer seating, is in the Parisian A-lister’s little black book.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 503\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nMaison Souquet was a pleasure house during the belle époque – today it's an extraordinary boutique address with a Jacques Garcia décor as indulgent and spirited as the illustrious courtesans it once housed. The 20 rooms ooze romance, guests can privatise the spa and the clandestine cocktail bar is wickedly pleasurable.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 451\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis popular boutique hotel from Experimental Group is a great base for those looking to enjoy the buzzy ambiance of surrounding South Pigalle.

The fantastic Musée National Picasso, the Victor Hugo house-museum on achingly beautiful Place des Vosges, and the largely unsung Musée des Arts et Metiers are top sights here. To the north, boutique shopping for unique fashion and art pieces in Haut-Marais is second-to-none. To the east, in the neighbouring 11th arrondissement, the pace quickens in the Bastille area with creative bistro openings and outstanding street markets.\n\nWhere to stay in Le Marais & Bastille\n\nBourg Tibourg, located in the fashionable Marais district, is a deliciously decadent retro retreat. Expect luxurious comfort combined with exquisite interior design from Jacques Garcia, and exemplary service from the discreet staff.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 219\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis quirky little independent hotel, themed around Beaumarchais' 'The Marriage of Figaro,' is packed to the wooden beams with period detail and charm. Guests can expect a good old-fashioned welcome, with all the bustle of the Marais district on the doorstep.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 137\n\nper night\n\nSt-Germain des Prés\n\nOn the Rive Gauche (Left Bank), across the water from the Seine’s twinset of islands, languishes the eminently elegant and graceful district of St-German des Près (6th and 7th arrondissements), made famous by the early 20th-century likes of Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre and Hemingway who quaffed coffee and cocktails on its historic café pavement terraces on boulevard St-Germain. Do the same, mooch around this area’s many art galleries, antique shops and fashion boutiques. Key sights include the Musée d’Orsay, Musee Rodin, Hôtel des Invalides and gorgeously green Jardin du Luxembourg.\n\nWhere to stay in St-Germain des Prés\n\nThis historic palace-grade hotel provides luxury paired with the local flavour of Paris' characterful Left Bank. Many of the property's original 20th-century features have been painstakingly restored, including a 1910 fresco. Along with art nouveau charm, expect quality service, with a focus on personalised touches.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 1,134\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis address is famous for being the hotel where Oscar Wilde died, but it offers more than history, with an excellent location in the heart of St-Germain, a Michelin-starred restaurant and sumptuous décor from Jacques Garcia.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 323\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nLatin Quarter\n\nThe Sorbonne university lies at the heart of the literary, student-loved 5th arrondissement, wedged between the vast green spaces of Jardin du Luxembourg and Jardin des Plantes on the Left Bank. The Panthéon, Musée National de la Moyen, National Museum of Natural History and dazzling Institut du Monde Arabe are among the city’s finest museums; and there’s always Paris’s oldest and most famous bookshop, Shakespeare & Company, to browse when sightseeing fatigue sets in. Dining covers every taste, with plenty of cheaper addresses for those on a tighter budget.\n\nWhere to stay in the Latin Quarter\n\nUrban chic meets Haussmann at this Best Western Plus, four-star hotel on the Left Bank, smart on a leafy boulevard straddling the 5e and 13e arrondissements. Forty-two cleverly designed rooms are as functional as they are beautiful, and public spaces beg guests to linger over an art magazine or design digest.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 121\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis hip but refreshingly unpretentious address brings a taste of the Left Bank’s bohemian history back to this latterly bourgeois district. Expect comfortable rooms with a generous emphasis on tech and style, continuing into the in-house ‘concept store’ and subterranean recording studio.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 143\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nSituated in a period building with spectacular views over the grand Panthéon, this Left Bank boutique hotel pays homage to some France’s greatest women with uniquely styled guestrooms, lavish fabrics, and custom-designed furniture for a cosy and comfortable stay in the classically Parisian Latin Quarter.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 343\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nGare du Nord & Strasbourg Saint-Denis\n\nThis buzzy area on the Right Bank has become one of the most exciting areas in Paris in recent years. It’s just out of the touristy and often expensive centre, but the big sights like the Louvre are still within comfortable walking distance and you can zip across town on Métro Line 4. A historically populaire, or working-class neighbourhood, it strikes a good balance between authentic Parisian character and a rich offering of things to do, not least at night when the local bars and concert venues bustle with life.\n\nWhere to stay in Gare du Nord & Strasbourg Saint-Denis\n\nA rare Parisian original, the independently owned Grand Quartier brings a welcome easygoing vibe and fresh, retro-influenced design to the boutique hotel scene. Heralding the continued transformation of the 10th arrondissement, its cool gallery spaces and café-bar make it a hotspot for local creatives and guests alike.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 152\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nLes Deux Gares fizzes with interior designer Luke Edward Hall’s exuberant take on art deco style. Great value rooms come in retina-pulling colour combinations, while the overhauled Café les Deux Gares's menu delights in a pared-back bistro which feels like it’s always been there.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 136\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nThis gorgeous little boutique hotel strikes the right balance between cool credentials and unpretentious cosiness. It is less than 10 minutes' walk from the Eurostar terminus at Gare du Nord and reasonably priced, making it an excellent option for a mini-break.\n\nRead expert review\n\nFrom £ 116\n\nper night\n\nRates provided by\n\nBooking.com\n\nContributions by Natasha Edwards, Rooksana Hossenally, Eleanor Aldridge, Nicola Leigh Stewart & Nicola Williams\n\n9 Telegraph expert rating\n\nThe Cheval Blanc might be one of the city’s most exclusive stays, but there’s nothing stuffy abou...
