The museum is free of charge and has over 500 works on display including marble, bronze and plaster statues and Bourdelle’s own collection of artwork.\n\nLike the Rodin museum, the Musée Bourdelle has an expansive sculpture garden for visitors to explore Bourdelle’s bronze statues in a courtyard and fully experience the artist’s vision for making his life’s work into a museum."
