        "text": "There are hundreds museums in the city—in fact, Paris has the most museums of any city in the world, according to Statista—which means there is a museum here for everyone, no matter what your interests.\n\nFor those interested in amusement parks, the Musée des Arts Forains showcases Pavillons de Bercy fairground memorabilia. Musée des Égouts de Paris is a fascinating—at least, for geography nerds like me—look at the city’s underground sewer system. And for those with a passion for air travel, Musée Air France at CDG airport holds a collection of posters, models, uniforms, and other objects related to the history of Air France, Air Inter, and UTA.\n\nMost Popular Museums in Paris\n\nThe three most visited museums in Paris are the Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou. These three amazing art museums are visited by an incredible 15+ million visitors per year in total, with the Louvre receiving over half those visitors itself. No surprise, then, to know the Louvre the most visited museum in the world.\n\nLe Musée du Louvre\n\nThe world’s largest art museum, the Louvre is a must-visit museum in Paris. Yes, Leonardo da Vinci’s notoriously tiny Italian Renaissance masterpiece Mona Lisa is worth seeing in person at least once. But there are so many more pieces of art to see in its massive 72 735 square metres (782 910 square feet).\n\nOne of the highlights is the huge collection of Egyptian objects, including papyrus scrolls, clothing and jewelry, and mummies. A personal favourite is seeing some of the classic paintings analyzed in high school art classes, like Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa, Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People, and Jacques-Louis David’s Oath of the Horatii. (If only I could have studied them directly from the walls of the Louvre instead of from a projector…)\n\nThere are so many objects and artworks, one could live in the Louvre for months before seeing them all. To make it easier, the museum offers detailed itineraries to follow, such as this one for fans of Beyonce and Jay-Z. Visitors can also make their own via this interactive map. Tackling a bit of the museum each visit will make it more enjoyable than trying to see everything all in one go.\n\nThe Louvre is located at the Louvre Palace at the Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden) in the centre of Paris, on the Seine’s Right Bank. It is open every day except Tuesdays from 9h to 18h, with extended hours (to 21h45) on Fridays. Adult tickets are 17€.\n\nOther museums nearby:\n\nLe Jeu de Paume is the National Centre for Photography and exhibits imagery from the 20th and 21st centuries. It is located at the Jardin des Tuileries, near the Concorde metro stop.\n\nThe Musée des Arts Décoratifs (Museum of Decorative Arts), which is located in the north-westernmost wing of the Louvre Palace, is dedicated to the exhibition and preservation of the decorative arts (furniture, altarpieces, ceramics, and such) from the Middle Ages to the present day.\n\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie is also located in the Jardin des Tuileries (see more information below).\n\nLe Musée d'Orsay\n\nAcross the Seine from the Louvre is my personal favourite museum in Paris: the Musée d'Orsay. Its large collection of Post-Impressionist paintings by Vincent van Gogh—it has 27, including La Nuit étoilée (1888), La Chambre de Van Gogh à Arles (1889), and Portrait de l'artiste (1889)—is very popular.\n\nIt also has the largest collection of Impressionist art in the world. Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Berthe Morisot—so many big names have works at the museum. There are also the sculptures in the main hall (look for the marble polar bear by François Pompon) and photography collections.\n\nBesides the incredible artworks on display, the museum is also known for its Beaux-Arts architecture. In a former life, the building was a train station, the Gare d'Orsay; it has kept some recognizable features, like the iconic arched ceiling. (Browse this visual story by Google Arts & Culture to learn more about its transformation.) On the fifth floor, after slowly making my way through all the Impressionism and Post-Impressionism rooms, I love looking out at the Parisian skyline from the giant clock, another remnant from its train station days.\n\nThe Musée d'Orsay is located at 1 Rue de la Légion d'Honneur. It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 9h to 18h (extended to 21h45 on Thursdays), and adult tickets are 16€.\n\nOther Impressionist museums in Paris:\n\nThe world’s largest collection of works by Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement, is at the Musée Marmottan Monet, located near the Bois de Boulogne.\n\nNear the Sacré-Coeur, the Musée de Montmartre houses works by Auguste Renoir, as well as works by Post-Impressionist artists like Émile Bernard and Suzanne Valadon.\n\nLocated west of the Place de la Concorde, the Petit Palais is the city’s museum of fine arts and includes works by Impressionist artists.\n\nLe Centre national d'art et de culture Georges-Pompidou (Pompidou Centre)\n\nThe Centre Pompidou is likely most known for its unique architectural style. It was one of the first buildings constructed with its inside bits—its structural system, mechanical systems, and circulation—exposed on the exterior. While not my favourite look, I do appreciate the attempt to bring colour to an otherwise grey city.\n\nBut it is also the home of the Musée National d'Art Moderne (National Museum of Modern Art), located on its fourth and fifth floors. Europe's largest modern art gallery has masterpieces by painter Piet Mondrian, visual artist Annette Messager, and sculptor and experimental artist Yaacov Agam, among others.\n\nAmber suggests that you make sure to see The Fallen Caryatid Carrying Her Stone. This evocative piece is a testament to courage, resilience, and resolve, and was originally part of The Gates of Hell before being enlarged and presented independently.\n\nThe layout of the Rodin Museum is essentially an estate, so the gardens surround a main house, the Hôtel Biron. Within the Hôtel Biron are additional collections, including more works by Rodin and some of his personal collection. This collection included works by Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nIf you visit during the summer and are looking for a relaxing activity in Paris, you may want to plan to sit on one of the benches that faces the central fountain and stay awhile. They’re shady during the day, perfect for reading, journaling, or just taking a moment for yourself.\n\nYou can find the Musée Rodin at 77 rue de Varenne. The museum is open from Tuesday to Sunday from 10h to 18h30 and adult tickets are 14€.\n\nLe Musée de l'Orangerie\n\nRecommended by Shar of Sightseeing Shar\n\nMusée de l'Orangerie is located in the heart of Paris and was built in the 19th century as a winter shelter for the orange trees at Jardin des Tuileries. It was converted into a museum in the 1920s and now contains a significant collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. The museum is split into two levels and has an elliptical shape and a skylight roof, creating an immersive viewing experience.\n\nThe museum's main highlight is a series of large-scale water lily murals by famous French Impressionist painter Claude Monet. There are a total of eight panels across two rooms, showcased on the lower level. The museum was specifically designed to house them due to their impressive size.\n\nOther highlights include Women on the Couch by Henry Matisse and Shar’s favorite, Young Girls at the Piano by Auguste Renoir. The Matisse painting shows a distorted and colorful view of a living room from above. The Renoir piece highlights two girls by a piano, showing the artist’s love of music and invoking a feeling of lovely warmth. Overall, this museum is a must-see for art lovers and is one of Shar’s favourite museums to visit on a solo trip to Paris.\n\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie is open every day except for Tuesdays from 9h to 18h. A ticket costs approximately 12.50€ for most adults.\n\nConciergerie\n\nRecommended by Jen from Dabbling in Jet Lag\n\nLocated on Île de la Cité, one of the two natural islands in Paris, the Conciergerie is another must-visit museum. This former royal palace was once home to the kings of France, and later served as a prison and courthouse during the French Revolution. Today, it's one of the oldest buildings in Paris and houses an impressive collection of historical artifacts.\n\nOne major highlight includes the former cell where Marie Antoinette was imprisoned. Then there are the exhibits in the final room. While the objects on display change regularly, they are all centered on events that took place at the Conciergerie. The most emphasis is placed on the 2000+ prisoners that were sentenced to death from 1793 to 1794, commonly known as the Reign of Terror.\n\nJen's favourite part is the new HistoPad. This tablet is used to show you a glimpse of what the halls and rooms used to look like. You'll scan a QR code, then hold up the tablet; a 3D interactive image appears that takes you through the history of the room you're in. It's educational, fun, and definitely unique.\n\nThe Conciergerie is located at 2 Boulevard du Palais. It is open all week from 9h30 to 18h (last admission 45 minutes before closing), and adult tickets are 11.50€. A combination ticket with the nearby Sainte-Chapelle is available for 18.50€.\n\nSainte-Chapelle\n\nRecommended by Faith of 3 Tickets Please\n\nSainte-Chapelle is a top small museum in Paris. Its stunning stained glass window should not be missed on a trip to the city. The gothic cathedral was originally built to house Christ’s holy relics, including the Crown of Thorns. It was decommissioned and turned into a museum in the 19th century.\n\nThe true beauty of Saint-Chapelle lies in its 15 stained glass windows that are each 15 metres high. The windows depict 1113 scenes from the Bible. While the scenes are religious, you do not need to be to visit this remarkable museum; Sainte-Chapelle will take your breath away regardless of your belief system.\n\nThe stained glass is remarkable because of its craftsmanship. You may never see this many stained glass windows in one place as you will at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. When the light hits the windows, you truly feel that you are inside a jewelled box. It is truly magical.\n\nFaith offers a couple of tips for visiting. First, there are actually two chapels at Sainte-Chapelle. The lower chapel is interesting, but not as impressive. Go upstairs to the upper chapel to see the stunning 15 windows. Second, if you want to get more information about the stories and history of windows, you can download the digital app “Sainte-Chapelle Windows” for your visit in Paris, or even at home as you are dreaming of Paris.\n\nSaint-Chapelle is located at 10 Boulevard du Palais. It is open from 9h to 19h from April to September and 9h to 17h from October to March, with last admission 40 minutes before closing. Adult tickets are 11.50€. There is a combination ticket with the nearby Conciergerie for 18.50€.\n\nMusée de la Vie Romantique (Museum of Romanic Life)\n\nRecommended by Denise of Chef Denise\n\nIt is very apropos that one of the coolest museums in the City of Love is the Musée de la Vie Romantique, or the Museum of Romanic Life. Tucked away in the 9th arrondissement, this small museum is the perfect place to spend a couple of hours away from the highly touristed attractions of Paris. You may even miss it when you know it’s there. But once you walk down the narrow path and enter the main courtyard, you will be smacked by the romantic vibe and know you are in the right place.\n\nOnce the home of artist Ary Scheffer, the setting oozes charm. It also has significance as a historical meeting place for the mid-1800s salon hosted by Scheffer and his daughter which was frequented by Chopin, Delacroix, and later, Dickens.\n\nSome of the most interesting things to see here are the first floor’s memorabilia, like a mold of Chopin’s hand and a collection of handwritten letters from the 1800s. One of the most poignant works is a sculpture of Joan of Arc by French Princess/artist Marie d’Orléans.\n\nDenise recommends taking time for a break at the onsite café. While it’s doesn’t have the allure of the most famous cafés in Paris, it certainly is one of the most romantic.\n\nThe Musée de la Vie Romantique is located at 16 Rue Chaptal. The museum and café are open Tuesday to Sunday from 10h to 18h. Tickets for the permanent collection are free.\n\nLe Musée d’Art Moderne (Museum of Modern Art)\n\nRecommended by Hannah of Art Distance\n\nThe Musée d’Art Moderne (MAM) is a free museum of the City of Paris, not far from the Trocadero. Despite being a major collection of modern art, it is somehow still a “hidden gem” in comparison with other Paris museums like the Pompidou. The building itself is a 1930s Modernist masterpiece originally built for the World’s Fair.\n\nThe modern art museum is packed with treasures, most notably Raoul Dufy’s panoramic fresco The Electricity Fairy, placed on a curved wall in situ since 1964. This colourful mural is astoundingly beautiful and immersive. As you walk through, the history of electricity and the ways it is used unfolds like a mythical narrative. The museum is filled with natural light illuminating further rooms which trace the history of modern art; each room reflecting a different movement or idea from Art Deco to Surrealism.\n\nThe museum also hosts temporary exhibitions for a cost, most of the time displaying the work of contemporary artists. It is next door to several other art institutions, the Palais Galliera and Musée Yves St Laurent (both fashion museums) and the Palais du Tokyo (contemporary installations) as well as beautiful outdoor cafes on the terraces.\n\nThe Musée d’Art Moderne, located at 11 Avenue du Président Wilson, is not so large that it will eat up an entire day; it’s possible to comfortably visit in about an hour, and it can be a breath of fresh air against the more traditional art museums in Paris. It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10h to 18h (ticket office closes at 17h15), with extended hours on Thursdays for temporary exhibitions—until 21h30.\n\nmusée national du Moyen Âge Paris—Musée de Cluny (Cluny Museum)\n\nRecommended by Amber of Get Lost in Wanderlust\n\nLocated in the heart of the Latin Quarter, the Cluny Museum is a museum that focuses on the Middle Ages. It reopened in 2022 after years of renovations and is worth a visit for those who enjoy history. While some may question if Paris is overrated, the Cluny Museum is a hidden gem that proves otherwise.\n\nOne aspect that makes this museum unique is that the building was once a Roman bathhouse. Today, you can visit the frigidarium, the cold room of the ancient bathhouse. In 1485, the Hotel Cluny was built next to the Roman ruins, and one of the highlights of the museum is seeing Hotel Cluny’s beautiful gothic-style chapel.\n\nThe museum has collections of thousands of important artifacts, jewelry, and art from the middle ages. The best part of the museum is the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries. There are six different tapestries, and each tapestry has a unique scene representing one of the five senses. However, the sixth tapestry is a bit of a mystery—does it represent a sixth sense? Amber thinks you need to take a look and decide for yourself!\n\nThe Musée de Cluny is located at 28 rue Du Sommerard. It is open Tuesday to Sunday from 9h30 to 18h15, with the ticket office closing at 17h30. Adult tickets are 12€.\n\nMusée Gustave Moreau (Gustave Moreau Museum)\n\nRecommended by Martha from May Cause Wanderlust\n\nA small-ish and fairly niche art gallery and museum in Paris is the Musée Gustave Moreau, which showcases the home and art collection of Gustave Moreau. He was a painter in the 19th century and a professor of art whose students included Henri Matisse.\n\nMoreau’s painting style has been described as eclectic, with influence from the Italian Renaissance masters he had studied, including Michelangelo, Neo-classicism, and Symbolism. His paintings contain a lot of mythical imagery and figures, and he took care over the intricate details of a scene.\n\nThe museum itself is in his house on rue de La Rochefoucauld and it contains hundreds of his works exhibited over four floors, including a preservation of what was his apartment on the 1st floor and his large airy studios on the 2nd and 3rd floors.\n\nThe artwork itself is the main highlight: it feels opulent and ostentatious at times. However, it is possibly an acquired taste—hence this museum being somewhat off the beaten path in Paris and probably not something most people do on their first visit to Paris.\n\nEven if it’s not quite your thing, it’s likely you’ll still appreciate the sense of stepping back in time that you’ll feel throughout the house. And there’s a show-stopper spiral staircase between the second and third floors.\n\nThe Musée Gustave Moreau is open every day except Tuesdays, between 10h and 18h, with last admission at 17h. Adult tickets are 7€.\n\nMusée Carnavalet (Carnavalet Museum)\n\nRecommended by Jenoa of The Travel Folk\n\nThe Musée Carnavalet, also known as the History of Paris Museum, is the oldest small museum in Paris. Located in the heart of the Marais in a 16th century building, the museum takes visitors through over 450 years of history in Paris, starting from ancient and prehistoric times.\n\nVisits begin in the hall of signs where you'll walk through a gallery of Parisian shop signs from the 17th to 20th centuries. These signs are an integral part of the history of Paris, as many people were illiterate and relied on the drawings and engravings on the signs to understand what shops sold.\n\nVisitors then make their way to the upstairs galleries that showcase ornately decorated period rooms from the 16th to 18th centuries with elaborate wallpaper, detailed panelling, and beautiful furniture. Many Parisian aristocrats once lived in these rooms when the building was a hotel.\n\nThe last stop is the beautiful outdoor garden in the courtyard of the museum. There is a cafe where you can order a drink or a bite to eat, or you can simply sit on a bench and take in the beautiful scene.\n\nThe Musée Carnavalet is located at 23 Rue de Sévigné. The museum is open all week, other than Mondays, from 10h to 18h; the ticket office closes at 17h15. Access to the permanent exhibits is free.\n\nMore Museums in Paris\n\nStill looking for more museum options?
