The herbarium includes more than 11 million specimens, collected from all over the world, including some very important collections from as early as the 16th century. Historical collections such as those of Jussieu and Lamarck, as well as the general collections, are particularly rich in type specimens of taxa described since the time of Linnaeus. This important research facility is open to international research efforts aimed at understanding and protecting the earth’s biodiversity and promoting sustainable development and researchers from around the world visit the museum to consult the types and other specimens necessary for their research in taxonomy and other aspects of botany.\n\nMaterials contributed by Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (P):"
