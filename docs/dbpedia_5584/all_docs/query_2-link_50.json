        "text": "You want to stroll down the Seine, you need to stroll down the Seine—Parisians love it and when the weath­er is coop­er­at­ing, are there all of the time—a result of the unique devel­op­ment of the Berges de Seine over the last few years. The for­mer may­or had the bril­liant idea to turn two lanes of high­way into a pedes­tri­an and bike-only zone and soon fol­lowed barges ded­i­cat­ed to drink­ing, side­walk dj sets, chillax zones, and climb­ing walls that you can dip into as the sun sets over the glit­ter­ing riv­er Seine. OK, so now traf­fic is hell­ish but that’s what all the share bikes are for…\n\nThis area oozes with ancient his­to­ry. Unfor­tu­nate­ly, it also oozes tourist traps. It’s still worth mean­der­ing through the cob­bled streets to check out the city’s coolest indy movie the­aters, some sexy cabaret action, and to pay trib­ute to Paris’ old­est liv­ing tree (it’s over 400 years old and still stand­ing!). Don’t miss Shake­speare & Com­pa­ny Inde­pen­dent Book­store for some great cof­fee and good reads. Is it a bit over-exposed? Maybe. But still very charm­ing. The biggest draw for us, as archi­tec­ture nerds, is the many old church­es of vary­ing archi­tec­tur­al styles. Shoutout to: Église Saint-Éti­enne-du-Mont and Église Saint Julien Le Pau­vre — they’re worth the genuflections.\n\nThis is the most inter­est­ing part of the fifth: a pleas­ant mix of archi­tec­ture, intel­lec­tu­al vibes, green­ery, cute tra­di­tion­al cafés and tiny indie movie hous­es. From the state­ly Pan­théon, the final rest­ing place of greats like Marie Curie, Voltaire and Josephine Bak­er, head down icon­ic Rue Mouf­fe­tard and its side streets. Then go back up to Rue Mon­ge and check out the Arènes de Lutèce (a Roman the­ater ruin) and Jardin des Plantes. Have a seat in the ele­gant café at the Grande Mosquée for mint tea and mid­dle-east­ern pastries."
