        "text": "Let‚Äôs get one thing out of the way first: Paris is huge. Your to-do list might be eight pages long. And if you‚Äôre just here for the weekend, there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll be able to fit absolutely everything in (though God does love a trier, so they say).\n\nBut don‚Äôt panic. The team over at Time Out Paris know this city like the back of their hand, and that means they know the spots that are really worth your time (and dough). On this list, we‚Äôve got everything from alternative tours of the Louvre to the best egg mayo in the city, and plenty of places to dance in between. Whatever you‚Äôre after, here are the best things to do in Paris right now.\n\nRECOMMENDED:ü•ò The best restaurants in ParisüèòÔ∏è Where to stay in Parisüè∫ The best museums in Parisüè° The best Airbnbs in Paris\n\nüé¢ The best rides at Disneyland Paris\n\nThis article was written by the editorial team at Time Out Paris. At Time Out, all of our travel guides are written by local writers who know their cities inside out. For more about how we curate, see our editorial guidelines.\n\nWhat is it? The thing Paris is known for, this spectacular glass pyramid has been around since 1983, when it was commissioned by Mitterrand.\n\nWhy go? You could spend hours wandering around the outside of it with a coffee, but the inside is a never-ending treasure trove of cultural artefacts, from the likes of the ancient Greeks to the Egyptians. What we‚Äôd suggest is to try one of the niche tours of the museum, like a feminist tour, or even the Beyonc√© and Jay-Z tour, which showcases the iconic creations featured in the ‚ÄòApeshit‚Äô music video filmed at the Louvre in 2018.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: G√©ricault's ‚ÄòThe Raft of the Medusa,‚Äô David's ‚ÄòThe Coronation of Napoleon I and the Crowning of Empress Jos√©phine,‚Äô or the Venus de Milo.\n\nWhy go? Because no visit to Paris is complete without a spin around Beaubourg.\n\nWhy go? Behind Richard Rogers‚Äô and Renzo Piano‚Äôs piping and air ducts lies one of the richest collections of modern art in the world. Step inside the Centre Pompidou to fall under the spell of Picasso, Magritte, Duchamp, Pollock, Warhol and Tinguely.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Head to the top floor for a truly eye-popping view.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? One of Paris‚Äôs most impressive museums.\n\nWhy go? A spectacular building designed by starchitect Frank Gehry hosts the collection of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault. Far out in the western suburbs of Paris, this brand-new stage for contemporary art showcases the biggest names of our time, from Jean-Michel Basquiat to Charlotte Perriand.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Its prime location by the Bois de Boulogne makes for a convenient forest stroll.\n\nWhat is it? Undoubtedly the world‚Äôs best-known graveyard.\n\nWhy go? A favourite among Parisians and tourists, the Cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise allows bookworms to enjoy an intimate moment with some of their literary heroes and learn about the Paris Commune. It is also beautifully picturesque: a vast, shaded labyrinth with snaking hillside paths and pretty stone stairs. Careful not to get lost...\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Treat yourself to a spooky late-night grave walk with the park‚Äôs ‚Äòvampire expert‚Äô.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A much-awaited contemporary art gallery in a restored historical monument, which opened its doors (finally) in spring 2021.\n\nWhy go? This museum is as grand and central as it gets, fully restored from floor to dome by Tadao Ando with a nine-metre-high concrete cylinder right in the middle. It took something this impressive to house Fran√ßois Pinault's private collection of 10,000 artworks. Within the 7,000 square meters of the Bourse, you'll find 24 creations by Bertrand Lavier, feminist photographs by Cindy Sherman, and a wonderful collection of African and African-American figurative paintings.\n\nWhat is it? Put simply, the most beautiful swimming pool in Paris.\n\nWhy go? This legendary establishment and listed building was bought by the AccorHotels group several years ago. The result? A luxury complex with a five-star hotel, an excellent restaurant, a 48-metre spa and all-around architectural beauty.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Order cocktails from the bar without leaving the pool.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? After a first year of testing the waters, this electronic hub tucked beneath the ring road hit full speed in 2023.\n\nWhy go? Led by Rag, Benjamin Charvet, and Samy Znimi, who respectively head up Barbi(e)turix, Badaboum and Panic Room, the lineup ‚Äì gender-balanced and inclusive ‚Äì takes the plunge into the realm of cutting-edge electronic music. From headliners to emerging gems, must-know labels and collectives of the moment, it's all about techno, house, and disco here.\n\nWhat is it? A remarkable showcase of Monet's work at one of our favourite museums in Paris.\n\nWhy go? This Monet showcase is now firmly on the tourist radar: expect long queues. The look is utilitarian and fuss-free, with the museum's eight, tapestry-sized Nymph√©as (water lilies) paintings housed in two plain oval rooms. They provide a simple backdrop for the astonishing, ethereal romanticism of Monet's works, painted late in his life. Depicting Monet's 'jardin d'eau' at his house in Giverny, the tableaux have an intense, dreamy quality ‚Äì partly reflecting the artist's absorption in the private world of his garden.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A design hotel and bar with a sordid past.\n\nWhy go? Inspired by the Parisian brothels from the Belle √âpoque period, Maison Souquet‚Äôs hidden frontage leads to a vision of orientalist splendour designed by Jacques Garcia. Styled on Arabian Nights, it‚Äôs all pretty pleasing to the eye: from the 1895 Cordovan leather on the walls to the Moorish tiles, porcelain, copper and vintage furniture.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: If you fancy a private pool party, you can rent theirs by the hour.\n\nWhat is it? A mecca of impressionist art in a stunning former train station.\n\nWhy go? In the old Gare d‚ÄôOrsay, you‚Äôll find one of the finest collections of 19th-century art. It‚Äôs got Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Pointillism and all the other great ‚Äòisms‚Äô that appeared between 1848 and the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Savour a coffee in the fantastic coffee shop nestled behind the clock, designed by the Campana brothers in tribute to Jules Verne‚Äôs ‚ÄòNautilus‚Äô.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Michelin-starred chef Bertrand Gr√©baut‚Äôs unique restaurant venture in Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and one of the best restaurants in Paris.\n\nWhy go? Offering up two tasting menus (one a little more extravagant than the other), this is a dining experience for a special occasion. Interiors feature antique ornaments, huge mirrors and bare wood, and the food is delicate, fresh, and expertly balanced.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: It can get booked up a year in advance. If you can‚Äôt get a table, try Septime La Cave next door.\n\n12. Double up at the Palais de Tokyo and Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne\n\nWhat is it? Two of the best museums near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWhy go? A pair of museums with totally different vibes. The first, the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne, pays tribute to the Avant-gardistes, while the second, the Palais de Tokyo, combines installations, videos and new-age icons, cementing its status as a temple of contemporary art.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Grab a bite at Monsieur Bleu, the Palais de Tokyo restaurant.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Storied picture houses that put on obscure screenings at low prices.\n\nWhy go? A historic flytrap for Parisian cinephiles, the 5th and 6th arrondissements are still full of independent cinemas, most notably Le Champo on Rue des √âcoles, where many of the Nouvelle Vague directors hung about in the ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô60s.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Legend has it that on his travels to Paris, Quentin Tarantino would often make a pilgrimage to the Latin Quarter‚Äôs Filmoth√®que.\n\nWhat is it? A former coal station turned live music hotspot.\n\nWhy go? The MU collective has made the most of this old coal station‚Äôs architectural quirks and turned it into an events space reminiscent of underground Berlin. Explore its three rooms, an outdoor stage, and two indoor stages, playing everything from hardcore punk to pure techno.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The edgy atmosphere and budget-friendly prices.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. Witness razor-sharp talent at the Th√©√¢tre Nanterre-Amandiers\n\nWhat is it? An iconic theatre in Nanterre (the western suburbs of Paris) which has been around since 1976.\n\nWhy go? We'll be the first to admit that this theatre is a little way off the usual beaten track, but if you've got a bit more time, it's worth it. Positioned as a major player in French theatre in the ‚Äò80s by Patrice Ch√©reau, elevated by Philippe Quesne, and now under the direction of Christophe Rauck, Th√©√¢tre Nanterre-Amandiers hosts the cr√®me de la cr√®me of today's actors, choreographers, and directors. Our top tip? The bar and restaurant area offers seasonal dishes to recharge before heading back to the bits.\n\nWhat is it? A small food market that feels like ‚Äì and is? ‚Äì the 'real' Paris.\n\nWhy go? This historic Parisian market takes its name from the Enfants Rouges (Red Children) orphanage, which was built in the 16th century and closed down just before the revolution. Saturdays are when the market is at its liveliest, but expect a hard time choosing between the different stalls: Moroccan, Italian, Lebanese, or a refined blowout at the Enfants du March√©. Try it all if you can.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Take a look around the cactus shop Les Succulents.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. Sample cocktails and soul tunes at Fr√©quence\n\nWhat is it? A funky, inventive and genuinely cool bar in Paris (and one of the 50 best bars in the world, according to 50 Best).\n\nWhy go? Fr√©quence is run by Matthieu Biron and Guillaume Quenza, who are equally as passionate about fine drinks as they are about Motown on vinyl. The fruits of their labour have culminated in this delightful bar, where turntables and records share the spotlight with bottles and shakers. The cocktails are as clever as they are slap-you-in-the-face strong, like the doud (salted pine nuts, white Cap Corse, shochu and calvados).\n\nWhat is it? The best restaurant in the city, according to the editors at Time Out Paris.\n\nWhy go? If you've got enough time to book in advance, this is guaranteed to be an unforgettable meal, cooked by some really brilliant chefs. Le Clarence is incredibly eccentric, impeccably OTT, and certainly not cheap, but to sample veal sweetbread gyoza, ink and cuttlefish tartare and a poached oyster all in a single lunch? That's once-in-a-lifetime stuff. It ain't cheap, we'll warn you (but you might have guessed that already).\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. Eat, drink, dance and play p√©tanque at the Cit√© Fertile\n\nWhat is it? A gargantuan 10,000-square-metre cultural complex in fast-gentrifying Pantin.\n\nWhy go? Following in the thriving footsteps of Ground Control and Grands Voisins, the Cit√© Fertile is the latest multidisciplinary cultural pop-up to pull in the summer crowds. Opened in a former train depot in August 2018, it‚Äôs got a three-year licence from national train firm SNCF and, like its predecessors, has a wide array of food offerings, a rich cultural programme, a vast 800-square-metre urban farming lab, and ‚Äì perfect for families ‚Äì a beach where you can play volleyball, p√©tanque and ping-pong.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Canal de l‚ÄôOurcq institution Paname Brewing Company brews on-site.\n\nWhat is it? A homey cocktail bar run by Elena Schmitt and Margot Lecarpentier (formerly of Experimental Cocktail Club).\n\nWhy go? Perched atop Belleville hill, Combat‚Äôs cocktails are punchy and well-balanced. We also like their bar snacks, especially the terrine, prepared by Repaire de Cartouche chef Rodolphe Paquin and served with pickles and pain de campagne.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The Parc de Belleville across the road. Those views are unbeatable.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? THE place to be during the summer months.\n\nWhy go? Spread out over 35 hectares, this is the largest of Paris‚Äôs parks, and from mid-July, it hosts the annual open-air cinema festival. There‚Äôs always a good vibe, and we‚Äôve even witnessed a crowd of more than 2,000 get up and dance beneath the stars at the end of ‚ÄòGrease‚Äô. It was a moment, to say the least.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Round off the night at beach-style nightclub Plage du Glazart, which is kitted out with sand and deckchairs.\n\nWhat is it? The city‚Äôs best-looking concept store.\n\nWhy go? In a light-filled building at the end of a courtyard on the Rue Beaumarchais, Merci brings together a collection of influential stylists and designers, from Isabel Marant to Stella McCartney. There‚Äôs also an array of luxury stationery, homeware and accessories. It‚Äôs hard to know where to look.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Enter via the ‚Äòliterary‚Äô cafe for a break, order a fresh OJ and let your eyes wander around the book-lined walls. Why not read one if you have time?\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. Get lost in wonder at the stunning Ovale of BnF Richelieu\n\nWhat is it? A beautiful reading room with over 20,000 books, 9,000 comics and 160 cosy reading spots.\n\nWhy go? For its three-hundredth anniversary, the historic site of the National Library fully reopened its shelves in September 2022. Besides a new museum, the BNF‚Äôs astonishing Ovale room, with 18 metres high and crowned by a glass roof, is now accessible to all. The best part? It's totally free.\n\nWhat is it? A stylish seafood bar, in which they‚Äôve taken the name of the house speciality and pressed copy and paste (the ‚Äòclamato‚Äô, by the way, is a spicy bouillon of clams and tomatoes)\n\nWhy go? For a fresh, spicy taste sensation. Depending on the season, you might get wild Belle Corde n¬∞3 oysters with Tabasco, some delightful Quiberon barnacles in a punchy lemongrass vinaigrette or a gorgeously silky fillet of haddock served with asparagus and a ‚Äòred miso‚Äô.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. Take to the stage at the Festival D'Automne\n\nWhat is it? For fifty years, the Autumn Festival has been the pulse of contemporary stage creation, setting the hearts of thousands of spectators racing in various cultural venues across Paris.\n\nWhy go? A must-attend event dedicated to the performing arts in all their diversity ‚Äì and their radicalism ‚Äì the festival has witnessed the rise of some of the biggest names in the international contemporary scene, from American choreographer Merce Cunningham to director Robert (known as Bob) Wilson.\n\nWhat is it? The best Italian restaurant outside Italy. (Yes, we went there.)\n\nWhy go? Since ex-Rino chef Giovanni Passerini opened this eponymous Italian restaurant in 2015, it has been one of our favourites for a simple, traditional Italian meal among friends. Nothing beats their cult pasta all‚Äôamatriciana.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The top-notch menu of sulphite-free French and Italian wines.\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. Discover alternative music at Macki Festival\n\nWhat is it? A festival collaboration between the Mamie‚Äôs collective and Cracki Records label in the park of Carri√®res-sur-Seine.\n\nWhy go? Since 2013, Macki Festival‚Äôs organisers have been crafting lineups that ride every stylistic wave, avoiding the (very) big names in favor of adventurous artists. Be quick to grab tickets, as they always sell out fast.\n\n28. Watch comedy with dinner at Madame Sarfati\n\nWhat is it? A comedy club with secret lineups of top-notch and well-established comedians.\n\nWhy go? Downstairs (the performance space is upstairs), there‚Äôs a cool bar with elegant decor and a small restaurant area with Maghrebi-inspired cuisine. The big plus: Madame Sarfati‚Äôs spacious terrace, bustling with activity in the summer, is perfect for soaking up the sun and nibbling on snacks.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A bopping bar at the very top of Paris's largest park, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont.\n\nWhy go? This is one of the most vibrant hangouts in the capital. Run by Mimi and Zouzou, former owners of iconic noughties lesbian club Pulp, this riverside bar hosts some of the wildest queer nights in the city. Come on a Sunday when the tracks get especially wild. It's legendary.\n\nWhat is it? An old network of railway lines has been transformed into the perfect romantic walk.\n\nWhy go? Built 150 years ago, La Petite Ceinture is almost 32km long. A public transport network until 1934, it was then used to transport goods until the late 1970s. Untouched for years, it has been cut up and transformed into various distinct sections, much like New York‚Äôs High Line. The Petite Ceinture‚Äôs best-known part begins in the 12th, a bucolic vision of plants and trees, but stretches across the 15th, 16th and 18th arrondissements, too.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Grabbing evening drinks at The Recyclerie, a bar at the former Boulevard Ornano station\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. Rifle through the racks (and boogie) at Dizonord\n\nWhat is it? A pan-genre record shop that hosts dangerously good DJ sets.\n\nWhy go? From New Orleans jazz to Japanese ambient, Dizonord‚Äôs racks overflow with deep cuts. And prices aren‚Äôt bad, either. Finally, north Paris has the record store it deserves.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Grab a beer at one of the Friday-night DJ sets.\n\nWhat is it? A small theatre showcasing innovative contemporary dance and drama pieces.\n\nWhy go? Saved from bankruptcy in the 1970s (and renamed several times thereafter) the theater is now an emblematic figure of Parisian independence. Find two auditoriums where adventurous dance and theatre take the spotlight, and a nice bar for afters.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Remember Gaston Lagaffe's brilliant book storage ideas? Well, Regard Moderne is like that... but better. Stacks of books towering several meters high, inaccessible shelves hidden behind columns, and narrow passages where you can only squeeze through by sucking in your stomach.\n\nWhy go? It was Jacques No√´l who conceived this place, before passing the baton to his successor upon his death, who diligently stored all of these precious volumes, whether they be beautiful works about Duchamp, collections of surrealist poetry or Beat novels in their original language. If you've got an interest in the peculiar in literature, this is the place.\n\n34. See Paris become an open-air museum during Nuit Blanche\n\nWhat is it? One of Parisians' favourite cultural events.\n\nWhy go? Every year since 2002, Nuit Blanche has illuminated Paris with its artistic brilliance. And here's the new twist: since 2023, the event has ditched the autumn gloom and moved to the summer. What hasn't changed is that, for one night, a multitude of artists from all stylistic backgrounds descend upon the capital, turning it into an immense open-air museum with a flurry of creations and unprecedented openings. If you can make it down in the summer, it's a must.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. Devour top-notch loaves at Shinya Pain\n\nWhat is it? A tiny, chaotic bakery in Abbesses, with inconvenient opening hours and bread scattered everywhere, where you might just taste the best bread you‚Äôve ever had.\n\nWhy go? Shinya Pain‚Äôs breads are distinctive but never divisive, with delicate crusts, subtle sourdough acidity that brings out the fragrance of roasted grains. The classic loaf made with khorasan wheat (the Rolls Royce of ancient grains) is a delight that you devour like cake.\n\nWhat is it? This eco-conscious festival is the most talked-about event in Paris‚Äôs spring calendar.\n\nWhy go? When it comes to top-tier festivals, all Paris had ten years ago was Rock en Seine and Solidays. Fast forward to today, and We Love Green has displaced the pair as the most eminent music event of the year. The line-up brings together Pitchfork-approved rap, indie rock and techno.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The food is almost as much of a draw. The likes of Septime, Cheval d‚ÄôOr and Les Enfants du March√© have all taken part.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A seriously classy cocktail bar in the far west of Paris.\n\nWhy go? While its new little big brother in the Latin Quarter has reigned over the Left Bank since the summer of 2023, Franck Audoux's original establishment remains a safe bet (if not the only one) for cocktail enthusiasts in this neighbourhood. In a fully Art Nouveau setting from floor to ceiling, you can sample drinks that are all about simplicity; few ingredients, no garnish, and a very delicate balance.\n\nWhat is it? Paris‚Äôs ultra-modern temple to classical music, near the gently flourishing Pantin area.\n\nWhy go? The Philharmonie, which forms part of the Cit√© de la Musique, has a rich and abundant live music programme. In addition to its impressive concert hall, the Philharmonie has an exciting exhibition space and an educational centre like its neighbour, the Cit√© des Sciences.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The prices are super-accessible, so you can experiment without breaking the bank.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. Try first-class sashimi at Ogata\n\nWhat is it? A Michelin-starred Japanese omakase restaurant with a minimalist five ‚Äòflavour‚Äô tasting menu and a seasonal cocktail.\n\nWhy go? Picture this: a hint of barely audible music, no dishwasher to avoid disturbing the tranquility of the place, and small whisperings as customers eat. Here, silence reigns supreme. The entrance fee to this piece of Japan is ‚Ç¨8, but includes three delights (during our visit: poutargue and daikon, cauliflower fritter and wasabi, persimmon and tofu cream) smuggled out from the restaurant.\n\n40. Sip seriously good cocktails at Bar Nouveau\n\nWhat is it? A relatively new bar that quickly became our favourite in Paris.\n\nWhy go? For Bar Nouveau‚Äôs highly refined menu with subtly nuanced recipes. The neo-Art Nouveau decor upstairs and more industrial vibe downstairs ‚Äì mirror frames reminiscent of tendrils, elegant arum-shaped (or chanterelle-shaped) suspensions, azure walls ‚Äì is a success, and the warm welcome from the Moudoulaud duo convinces us further that this is a great little bar.\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. Have the best egg mayo of your life at Grande Brasserie\n\nWhat is it? A beautiful brasserie which we voted best retro restaurant at the Time Out Paris Food and Drink Awards.\n\nWhy go? 1920s mosaics, post-war frescoes and starched tablecloths shape a cozy cocoon for timeless cuisine, whipped up with meticulous sourcing. But really, you‚Äôre going for Grande Brasserie‚Äôs world champion egg mayonnaise (at a premium price, mind).\n\n42. Flick through books at the BSG\n\nWhat is it? The Pantheon of Parisian libraries. Facing the real Pantheon and just a stone's throw from the Sorbonne, the Sainte-Genevi√®ve Library has been welcoming students from all backgrounds since 1851.\n\nWhy go? It‚Äôs a timeless setting where you can choose and consult ‚Äì yes, there‚Äôs no borrowing at the BSG ‚Äì your documents from among the 1.5 million printed works, 85,000 microforms, and 15,000 titles of periodicals in the general collection. And there‚Äôs no bias here; all disciplines are properly represented. All that's left is to arm yourself with patience and arrive early!\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. Get down with an orange wine at Bambino\n\nWhat is it? A natural wine bar with a penchant for turntables and draft cocktails.\n\nWhy go? Bambino‚Äôs decor is seriously impressive: walls of vinyl records and speakers larger than a small car, a Cantona jersey under glass, and a baseball bat atop the shelf. As the evening progresses, the tables gradually make way for DJ sets and pros of the one-two steps. Let the party begin.\n\nWhat is it? An elegant, old-school bistro serving fuss-free French cuisine.\n\nWhy go? At this excellent Right Bank spot, the charismatic ma√Ætre d‚Äô perches behind a bar and advises punters on the best red to enjoy with their confit beef cheeks (or whatever else they order). It‚Äôs perfect for Sunday lunch, a boozy dinner with mates, or even a solo trip. However you do it, you‚Äôll savour every single bite.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: You won‚Äôt find sausage and mash like this anywhere else, so loosen your top button and dig in.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? An ultra-modern setting designed by Manuelle Gautrand boldly shaking up the original ornamental Belle Epoque style.\n\nWhy go? The Ga√Æt√© lyrique has been the epicenter of Parisian cultural life 2.0 since 2011. Taken on since 2023 by a new artistic team, the seven interdisciplinary floors propel visitors into the depths of the digital age, encompassing visual arts, music, graphic design, cinema, fashion, design, and video games. Admission is free, and some of its offerings are free, including immersive exhibitions and workshops.\n\nWhat is it? A deli serving the best ham and cheese baguette in the city.\n\nWhy go? It may be a tight squeeze inside, but the interiors are charmingly retro, with old-fashioned kitchen scales, vintage enamel advertising signs and yellow tiles on the walls. Take your pick from the mouth-watering menu; think classic Prince de Paris jambon-beurre, smoked chicken baguette and chorizo tortilla.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: The perfect way to eat on the run while rushing to catch a show at the Th√©√¢tre de la Bastille.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A former train station-turned-jazz bar.\n\nWhy go? Every day at 9pm, this former train station foyer hosts free jazz concerts. The setting is perfect: the airy four-metre-high space enhances the warmth of the saxophones and trumpets.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss: Make a beeline for the patio in summer.\n\nWhat is it? This gigantic fire-engine red bar with its huge terrace fits in well with the rest of the Parc de la Villette‚Äôs gaudy architecture.\n\nWhy go? Set between imposing trees in the 19th arrondissement park, this colourful enormo-bar exudes a trendy atmosphere redolent of a Berlin beer garden, but drinks prices are unfortunately Paris standard (‚Ç¨6.50 a pint, ‚Ç¨7 after 10pm). Still, the excellent tapas and kebabs go down much better than a sticky late-night currywurst. Make sure to visit for the Sunday drag brunch, which gets pretty crazy.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A rooftop glass-and-iron restaurant and terrace lounge bar on the top floor of the Mus√©e du Quai Branly.\n\nWhy go? The full-on view of the Eiffel Tower at night would be reason enough to come here, but the food at the restaurant is also excellent. Or just have a drink at the bar (view still included), for swish cocktails, posh nibbles and plush sofas. You'll feel like you've strolled into a postcard.\n\nWhat is it? A cheese shop that's been serving the best of Paris-made fromage since 2017.\n\nWhy go? Pierre Coulon, a former employee of Androuet and a connoisseur of local cheese, has been turning organic milk into palate-pleasing delicacies at the heart of Goutte d'Or for a while now. This urban cheesemaker produces exceptional soft cheeses, such as a Saint-F√©licien with raw cream, a Brillat-Savarin made with triple cream, or a Labat crafted with Breton goat milk... You can also find cheeses from small local producers, aged on-site, and a Normandy camembert from Pierre's farm in the city of the same name."
