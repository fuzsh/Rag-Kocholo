        "text": "Musée du Louvre\n\nWho has not heard of the Louvre? Situated on the Right Bank of the Seine, it is one of Paris’s most famous landmarks. Housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built in the late 12th century, converted into the primary residence of French kings by Francis I in 1546 (until Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household in 1682), it was extended more than once over the centuries. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly stated that the building should be used as a museum to display France’s masterpieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests ever since.\n\nDivided into eight curatorial departments—Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; and Paintings; and Prints and Drawings—the Louvre is an amazing multistory maze of galleries, passageways, staircases, escalators, and a courtyard topped with a glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei in 1988. With 652,300 square feet and about 10 million annual visitors (before Covid) all eager to get lost in it, the site is the largest and most visited museum in the world. It is home to some 38,000 artworks and artifacts from prehistory to the 21st century, including Leonardo da Vinci’s often photo-bombed Mona Lisa, Alexandros of Antioch’s Venus de Milo, and Eugène Delacroix’s Raft of the Medusa. It is impossible to see the entirety of the collection in one day, so plan on coming back—often.\n\nMusée d’Orsay\n\nThe Musée d’Orsay, one of the largest museums in Europe, is located on the Left Bank of the Seine. It is housed in the former Gare d’Orsay, a railway station built between 1898 and 1900 under the aegis of three architects, Lucien Magne, Émile Bénard and Victor Laloux. Its trains connected Paris to southwest France until 1939, after which they served the suburbs only. Part of the building became a mailing center during World War II. It was then used as a movie set for films such as Orson Welles’s adaptation of The Trial by Franz Kafka, and as a venue for auctioneers while the Hôtel Drouot was under construction. It began its life as a museum and cultural landmark in 1986.\n\nThe museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including the largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by such luminaries as Berthe Morisot, Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the institution’s opening. Thanks to a €5 million donation from Daniel Marchesseau, the Musée d’Orsay has launched the restoration of the 17th-century Hôtel de Mailly-Nesle (facing the Louvre’s Pavillon de Flore), destined to reopen as a resource and research center by the beginning of 2026.\n\nCentre Pompidou\n\nNamed after the French president (1969–1974) who commissioned it, the Centre Pompidou is also known as the Beaubourg, which is what its neighborhood in the Marais district of Paris is called. This institution is home to a public library, a center for music and acoustic research called IRCAM, and to the Musée National d’Art Moderne, the largest museum of modern art in Europe.\n\nWhen unveiled in 1977, the Beaubourg’s high-tech industrial design, with all of its structural and mechanical elements exposed on the exterior, gave rise to much controversy. Now the building, the work of architects Richard Rogers, Su Rogers, Renzo Piano, and Gianfraco Franchini, is considered iconic. The same goes for its 2010 regional satellite in Metz, France, a curvilinear white building designed by Shigeru Ban and Jean de Gastines.\n\nThe exhibitions at both locations draw from a collection of 120,000 works by major 20th-century artists including Alexander Calder, Louise Bourgeois, Niki de Saint Phalle, Pablo Picasso, Anselm Kiefer, Sheila Hicks, and many more. The Centre Pompidou Málaga and the Centre Pompidou x West Bund Museum Project (in Shanghai) were inaugurated in 2015 and in 2019, respectively, and there have been discussions about opening more branches around the world, from Brussels to Jersey City.\n\nMusée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris\n\nLocated on the former Quai de Tokio (now called Avenue de New York), the Palais de Tokyo was designed by Jean Claude Dondel and André Aubert to house two separate museums: the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and the Musée National d’Art Moderne. Today only the former is housed there, nested in the west wing of the iconic building, unadorned on the inside but decorated with mythological themes on the outside. The museum holds one of the largest collections of modern and contemporary art in France, with more than 10,000 works by Pablo Picasso, Raoul Dufy, Amedeo Modigliani, André Derain, Marc Chagall, Christian Boltanski, Philippe Parreno, and many others. The institution is also home to site-specific installations such as the first version of Henri Matisse’s La Danse and Dufy’s monumental mural La Fée Electricité, donated in 1954 by the artist himself. More than 800 works have entered the holdings since 2007, including pieces by Peter Doig, Christopher Wool, Douglas Gordon, Gilles Barbier, and Elaine Sturtevant. And there are certainly more to come.\n\nMusée de la Vie Romantique\n\nLocated in the New Athens district, cradle of 19th-century intellectual and artistic elites, the Musée de la Vie Romantique is the former house of Dutch-French painter Ary Scheffer (1795–1858), who moved to Paris in 1811. The second level is devoted to him and his contemporaries. The floor below, which pays tribute to the writer George Sand, includes portraits, furniture, and 18th- and 19th-century jewelry. In his living room, Scheffer would host his counterpart Eugène Delacroix; composers Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, and Gioachino Rossini; opera singer Pauline Viardot; and writers Ivan Turgenev and Charles Dickens. In the studio, he worked alongside his younger brother Henry. The latter spaces, now reserved for temporary exhibitions, frame a cobbled courtyard, while the greenhouse, in the garden, is home to a quaint coffee shop whose quiches are a must-try.\n\nMusée Gustave Moreau\n\nAnother emblematic painter of the New Athens district, in Paris’s 9th arrondissement, is the Symbolist Gustave Moreau (1826–1898), who turned his home into a museum in 1895 with the help of architect Albert Lafon. The house had been bought in 1852 by his parents, who shared the second floor (a dining room, one bedroom, a den, a hallway, and an office/library) with him until their passing. Moreau’s studio was originally on the third floor and later on the top floor, accessible via a spiral staircase, still in place today. In 1897 Moreau donated his home and its contents to the state, which did not accept the offer until four years later. The collection consists of 1,300 of the artist’s paintings, watercolors and sketches, as well as some 5,000 drawings. Among the highlights on view are Jupiter and Semele (1895), Chimera (1884), and The Return of the Argonauts (1890–97), all inspired by Greek mythology.\n\nMusée Jacquemart-André\n\nA jewel of the 8th arrondissement, the Musée Jacquemart-André occupies the former home of a collector couple. Scion of a Protestant banking family, Edouard André (1833–1894) married Nélie Jacquemart (1841–1912), a well-known society painter, 10 years after she executed his portrait. Every year the pair would travel to Italy, amassing the finest pieces of art they could find. When André died, Nélie Jacquemart completed the decoration of their “Italian museum” and headed to Asia to expand her aesthetic horizons. Sticking to the plan she had made with her husband, she bequeathed the mansion to the Institut de France, which opened it as a museum in 1913.\n\nToday the public can visit the site in its original state and, on the walls, discover works by Élisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Andrea Mantegna, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Sandro Botticelli, and Thomas Gainsborough, which have always been there. Culturespaces, the private company that has been managing the museum since 1996, is accountable for the success of many temporary exhibitions and the creation of a quaint coffee shop, the menu of which subtly refers to the artists on view.\n\nMusée Guimet\n\nThe Musée Guimet was born in Lyon in 1879, three years after industrialist Émile Guimet was sent to Japan, China, and India by the French minister of public instruction to study the religions of the Far East. When he returned from his travels, Guimet brought back many works of art, which were given to the state and transferred to Paris in 1889. The museum (full name: Musée National des Arts Asiatiques–Guimet) is now home to the largest collection of Asian arts in Europe. Renovated in 2001, its spacious, light-filled galleries gather together pieces from India, Cambodia, Thailand, Malasia, Vietnam, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Korea, and Japan. The library includes works on Asian religion and philosophy as well as art. The permanent display occupies five levels, and temporary exhibitions devoted to contemporary artists regularly fill the building’s top-floor rotunda. Daniel Arsham, Chiharu Shiota, Duy Anh Nhan Duc, and Yang Jiechang have been among those featured.\n\nMusée Carnavalet\n\nIf you want to know everything there is to know about Paris, this museum devoted to the city and its history is the place to go. Originally built as a townhouse, the Musée Carnavalet is one of the gems of the Marais, the oldest district in the French capital. The building was designed by architects Pierre Lescot and Jean Goujon before they were called to work on the Louvre Palace, and completed in about 1560 by Jean Bullant. The hôtel particulier owes its name to its 1572 acquirer, Madame de Kernevenoy, which Parisians had a tendency to mispronounce.\n\nIn 1866 the city purchased the Hôtel Carnavalet and started assembling what would be the museum’s contents. These pieces were stored along with the city archives in the vaults of the Hôtel de Ville, which Communard revolutionaries set on fire in 1871; the collection has been rebuilt since. It now includes some 625,000 objects, including a prehistoric dugout canoe cut from a single block of wood, stained-glass windows from the chapel of the College of Dormans-Beauvais attributed to Baudoin de Soissons and painter Jean de Bruges, Antoine Coysevox’s statue of Louis XIV, and 17th-century wood panels from the study of the Colbert de Villacerf mansion.\n\nMusée Rodin\n\nThe Hôtel Biron, home of the Musée Rodin, is a perfect example of Parisian rocaille architecture. With some 700,000 visitors a year, it is one of the most popular sites in Paris. This is where Auguste Rodin (1840–1917), the father of modern sculpture, worked in the early 20th century and where most of his works (6,600 sculptures, 8,000 photographs, as many drawings, and 7,000 objets d’art) are now preserved and presented. The house, started in 1727 by architect Jean Aubert, belonged at some point to Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon, Louis XIV’s daughter-in-law. In the early 20th century, Rodin rented it as a studio. His plan was to bequeath his collection to the state, on the condition that the Hôtel Biron become a permanent museum of his work. Sadly, the master died two years before his dream came true. Today, the property’s 7.4-acre garden, filled with sculptures by Rodin, is the ideal place for a romantic stroll. Temporary exhibitions take place in the 19th-century chapel, which was restored in 2005.\n\nMusée du Quai Branly\n\nThe imposing ivy-coated building standing on the Left Bank of the Seine not far from the Eiffel Tower is the Musée du Quai Branly. Opened in 2006, this glass-and-wood architectural gem was designed by French architect Jean Nouvel to welcome the collections of the Musée de l’Homme (Museum of Mankind) and the Musée National des Arts d’Afrique et d’Océanie. With 360,000 objects, 700,000 iconographical pieces, and more than 200,000 reference works, from the Neolithic period (around 10,000 BC) to the 21st century, it is one of the richest public institutions in Europe dedicated to the study, preservation, and promotion of non-European arts and civilizations. Jointly administered by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, the Quai Branly museum also serves as a research center.\n\nMusée de Cluny\n\nThe beating heart of the Latin Quarter (along with the Sorbonne, the Panthéon, and the Luxembourg Gardens), the Musée de Cluny is one of the oldest museums in Paris and the only national institution dedicated to the Middle Ages. It recently went through a major transformation, the most ambitious since it was created in 1843. The museum’s Roman thermal baths and Gothic chapel were restored, and public spaces—the reception area, the ticket office, and the café—were modernized. The new chronological display spans 21 rooms and features a reshuffle of 1,600 works, among which is the unavoidable Dame à la Licorne (The Lady and the Unicorn), a series of six tapestries designed in the mille-fleurs (“thousand flowers”) style in Paris and woven in Flanders. Five of them seem to be depicting the senses of taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. The sixth tapestry bears the words “À mon seul désir” (“To my only desire”), an esoteric message that fuels the mystery of this masterpiece."
