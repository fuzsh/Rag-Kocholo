        "text": "Paris is one of the most magical and popular cities in the world. Especially for students, Paris is an attractive study destination as it offers everything from fun nightlife to top-notch universities to an exciting pace of life.\n\nBut all of these come at a price. High rental costs and a dense population within the city make it hard to decide where to live in Paris as a student.\n\nAt first glance, rents in renowned parts of Paris may scare you. But many less popular neighborhoods offer a safe and dynamic life without breaking the bank.\n\nSo, to help you find affordable neighborhoods, we’ve made a list taking into account the things to do, accommodation prices, transportation links, and proximity to universities.\n\nWhere to live in Paris as a student\n\nOverall, we advise students in Paris to stay in neighborhoods such as:\n\n5th arrondissement - Panthéon,\n\n20th arrondissement - Belleville,\n\n10th arrondissement - Enclos St Laurent,\n\n11th arrondissement - Popincourt.\n\nAverage rent prices in Paris\n\nParis has one of the highest rental prices in Europe. You can expect to pay around €1,862 for furnished apartments for rent in Paris and €750 for a private room in a student apartment.\n\nThe central and more popular neighborhoods have higher prices than peripheral neighborhoods. So if you look for accommodation outside the center, you can find more affordable places.\n\nTop arrondissements of Paris\n\n© by ThePromenader\n\nLet's first talk about the arrondissements to give you an overview of Paris' layout. Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements forming a spiral shape centering the Louvre palace.\n\nThe most popular and central arrondissements are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th arrondissements. Many famous Paris attractions, such as Palais Royal, the Louvre Museum, Saint Eustache, Musée National Picasso, and Place de la Concorde are located in these neighborhoods.\n\nBecause all of the arrondissements of Paris form a spiral shape together, traveling from one to another arrondissement is quite easy thanks to Paris’s efficient public transport system. So you don’t have to stay in expensive arrondissements and pay high rent to be close to main attractions. By staying in any of the 4 mentioned arrondissements for students below, you’ll pay cheaper rent and have easy access to central arrondissements.\n\n5th arrondissement of - Panthéon\n\nPanthéon, also known as the Latin Quarter, is one of the most popular neighborhoods to live in for students and young expats. The 5th arrondissement is one of the oldest districts in Paris and one of the few neighborhoods where you can see ancient Roman elements.\n\nThings to do\n\nPanthéon has a lively and dynamic atmosphere. Its narrow streets contain pubs, student bars, cafes, bookstores, local shops, and food markets. Le Requin Chagrin is popular among students because of its affordable drinks — for €12, you can get a tasting platter and a lot of beers. They also host game and sport nights.\n\nFor the best brunch, head to Jozi Cafe which is close to Sorbonne University. Their menu contains fresh fruits and a delicious selection of toast, breakfast sandwiches, and yogurts. But because it’s one of the best, they’re pretty crowded and sometimes you’ve to wait 30 minutes to get a table.\n\nThe Latin Quarter has one of the best food markets in Paris. It’s home to revolutionary chef Julia Child's favorite outdoor food market Rue Mouffetard. You’ll also find the renowned La Tour d'Argent, one of the most famous restaurants in Paris which has been at this location since 1780.\n\nYou’ll also find the prominent Paris landmark here, The Panthéon, where many famous French artists (such as Victor Hugo, Marie Curie, Alexandre Dumas, and Voltaire) are buried.\n\nAverage rent in Panthéon, Paris\n\nRental prices are moderate in the 5th arrondissement compared to more expensive arrondissements of Paris. You can expect to pay around €550 - €650 monthly for a room in a shared apartment of 4. Alternatively, expect to pay about €1,200 for a studio if you want more private space.\n\nTransportation\n\nEverything you need is within walking distance. And thanks to Paris’s extensive public transport network, you can travel everywhere quickly. If you don’t want to walk, metro line 10 and RER train B pass from the 5th arrondissement.\n\nUniversities\n\nOne of the many reasons students choose this district is because of a number of higher education institutions: 1) Paris City University, 2) Sorbonne University, 3) PSL University, 4) Panthéon-Assas University, and 5) Collège de France are located here.\n\nInternationality\n\nThanks to many universities here, this neighborhood is very popular among international students and young expats.\n\n20th arrondissement - Belleville\n\nThis multi-ethnic neighborhood is home to many artists and students due to its lower rent prices. Belleville is home to Paris’s up-and-coming art scene, where many of the old abandoned buildings have turned into art studios.\n\nThings to do\n\nBelleville welcomes a mixture of people from all over the globe; it’s frequented by creatives, students, artists, and immigrants. The narrow streets of Belleville are full of tiny local-owned businesses. There’re many butchers and food shops from different ethnicities. You’ll find many restaurants with a Chinese menu, Middle Eastern specialties, and Mexican food. Belleville is also home to Paris’s 2nd Chinatown.\n\nIn the corner, you’ll find Café Aux Folies, a small cafe where Edith Piaf used to sing before becoming a famous French singer. To enjoy affordable but yummy drinks, try to come in the morning before it gets crowded.\n\nBelleville is especially celebrated for its street art. The short street Rue Denoyez is full of graffiti: you’ll find art on rolling doors, garbage cans, walls, and fences. Walking around during the day is completely safe, but locals advise extra caution during nighttime.\n\nThe beautiful public park Parc des Buttes Chaumont is also nearby, where you can catch a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. During summer, many people picnic there to enjoy the nice weather.\n\nAverage rent in Belleville, Paris\n\nBelleville is one of the most affordable neighborhoods on our list and overall in Paris. Rents for a private room in a student house of 4 start from €470.\n\nTransportation\n\n20th arrondissement is the outer part of Paris: but it’s easily reachable via public transport. You can reach it from Saint-Germain with metro line 2 and bus 95.\n\nUniversities\n\nOne of the best architecture schools in Paris École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Paris-Belleville is within 30 minutes walking distance. You can also reach the school with metro line 2.\n\nInternationality\n\nHistorically, Belleville was a working-class neighborhood. Due to low rental prices, it’s always attracted people from every ethnicity. Greeks, Spanish, North Africans, and sub-Saharan Africans are the predominant ethnic groups. The area is also incredibly trendy among international and local creatives.\n\n10th arrondissement - Enclos St Laurent\n\nSt Laurent is one of the busiest residential areas of Paris. What makes it attractive to young professionals and students is its proximity to the center of Paris while preserving moderate rent prices.\n\nBesides preserving its charm as a lively residential neighborhood, St Laurent is also home to many commerce and trade centers.\n\nThings to do\n\nBecause it’s pretty residential, there’re not many museums and touristic attractions in this neighborhood. But the sides of the Canal Saint-Martin are full of Parisian patisseries, cafes, and international restaurants.\n\nOne of the permanent markets of Paris, Marché St-Quentin is open every day from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m except for Sundays (when it closes at 1:30 p.m.). You can find many butchers, fish shops, fresh vegetable stalls, and ethnic, regional foods.\n\nYou can take a canal tour from Parc de la Villette to enjoy the lovely weather on the Seine River.\n\nNightlife in the 10th arrondissement is young and vibrant. You can start your night by grabbing a cheese crostini at Chez Jeanette, then head over to Tony to drink their yummy gin fizz and continue your night enjoying eclectic electro music at La Petite Chaufferie.\n\nAverage rent in St Laurent\n\nGentrification is yet to take over St Laurent, so accommodation prices are a mixture of affordable and moderate. For a private room, you can expect a price tag of €480 - €660.\n\nTransportation\n\n10th arrondissement is quite centrally located. 10 metro lines, including 2, 4,5, and 7 pass from this neighborhood, making it very easy to reach. You can come there from the 3rd arrondissement in 15 mins by public transport.\n\nThe 2 major (very busy, we might add) railway stations in Paris, the Gare du Nord and the Gare de l’Est, are in the 10th arrondissement. So you can also easily do international travels to the Netherlands, Belgium, or Germany and local trips to the rest of France.\n\nUniversities\n\nICD Business School is located in the 10th arrondissement. Also, René Descartes University and PSL University are only 18 mins away by public transport.\n\nInternationality\n\nThis neighborhood is a perfect mixture of Parisians and international people. Thanks to its affordability, many young expats also prefer this area.\n\n11th arrondissement of Paris - Popincourt\n\n11th arrondissement is where you get both worlds: a dynamic residential area and wild party life. Popincourt consists of 2 parts. The Oberkampf, a district to the north where popular nightlife venues are, and Boulevard Voltaire on the east with many lively residential neighborhoods. Popincourt is one of the most densely populated urban areas in Europe, where most residents are young working professionals and students.\n\nThings to do\n\n11th arrondissement is one of the coolest neighborhoods in Paris. There’re endless options for having the time of your life.\n\nThe Oberkampf is undoubtedly one of the capital's liveliest areas, where many bars and clubs are situated. Perhaps one of the most renowned ones is a nightclub called The Nouveau Casino. Designed with modern Parisian decor and boasting extensive sound systems, this venue is especially favored by techno lovers.\n\nAnother hot spot is Café Charbon, which has been around since 1900. Café Charbon transports you into the Napoleon area. The DJ plays international pop and electro music on weekends, and the bar turns into a hot dancing spot.\n\nAve Maria is one of the quirkiest bars in The Oberkampf. It’s a vibrantly decorated restaurant with a South American menu. Everything here tastes well: whether you try their exotic cocktails or eccentric foods. And the good news is it’s also very affordable, with cocktail prices starting from €5.\n\nPopincourt is home to many art galleries and museums. For a perfect day rich with art and culture, you should start with Édith Piaf’s home museum and head out to L'Atelier des Lumières, which is a contemporary art center showcasing classic arts in video exhibitions. There’s also a gallery called Magda Danysz named after its owner Magda herself, where she showcases contemporary pieces from young artists from London, Paris, and Shanghai.\n\nAverage rent in Popincourt\n\n11th arrondissement is historically a working-class neighborhood, so real estate prices are relatively lower than in the central arrondissements.\n\nThe average rental prices for student housing in Popincourt are €500 - €660.\n\nTransportation\n\n11th arrondissement has an excellent connection to the rest of the city and central arrondissements. You can easily reach Popincourt with metro line 2 from Ménilmontant station and using lines 5 and 9 from Oberkampf station.\n\n11th arrondissement is also very close to train stations the Gare du Nord and the Gare de l’Est.\n\nUniversities\n\nIn Popincourt you’ll be living close to the post-graduate fashion university Institut Français de la Mode (IFM), and Paris City University.\n\nInternationality\n\nThis part of Paris is full of both local and international young adults. Its proximity to central arrondissements and universities also makes it attractive to students.\n\nNow that you've found the perfect location for your stay in Paris, you’re all set for the student adventure in France. We wish you good luck in finding your dream house!"
