        "text": "Paris offers an astonishing number of museums and monuments - 130 at last count, although the number grows all the time.\n\nAlthough the Louvre Museum leaps to most people's minds as the most famous repository of art in Paris, you'll find many, many more places in this guide where you can immerse yourself in art, culture, and creative visions.\n\nIn fact, you'll probably discover at least a few visit-worthy museum and monuments you've never heard of.\n\nTraditional \"art\" is just the beginning what they have to offer. So whether your interests focus on fashion, military history, economics, scientific innovations, graffiti (street art), wine, chocolate, vintage carousels, immersive art, architecture, or magic, you'll find at least one Paris museum or monument devoted to your favorite subject.\n\nWe also include institutions with living exhibitions: botanical gardens, zoos, and aquariums. Just like museums, their mission is to maintain, research, and protect collections.\n\nIn case you want to explore more than one museum or monument in a day or simply want to find out what's nearby, this guide groups them by arrondissement (Paris administrative districts). It also includes a few places in the Paris suburbs and nearby towns, such as the Palace of Versailles and even Monet's home and gardens in Giverny.\n\nIf you do plan to visit more than one museum in a day (or if you're planning an even more intense museum binge over the course of a few days), consider getting a Paris Museum Pass for 2, 4, or 6 days, as it can save you a lot of money. Sadly, it doesn't cover all museums and monuments, but it gets you in for free (aside from buying the pass) at most of the city's top museums plus many others.\n\nInterested in the museums in a specific arrondissement or neighborhood?
