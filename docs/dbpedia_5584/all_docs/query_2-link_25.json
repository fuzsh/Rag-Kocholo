        "text": "The 5th Arrondissement of Paris is referred to in spoken French as le cinquième.\n\nIt’s the first of the arrondissements named on the Left Bank, to the south of the Seine. So the 5th Arrondissement lies directly across the river from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.\n\nThe 5th is the home of the Quartier Latin, or what in English we call the Latin Quarter. This area has been a concentrated center of learning going back to the 12th Century. Indeed the University of Paris was founded here in 1150 (now usually referred to as the Sorbonne).\n\nThe blue-roofed building in the photograph is of the Sorbonne (the University of Paris).\n\nBut the 5th Arrondissement way pre-dates its rise as a centre of academia.\n\nIt was here in what is now the 5th Arrondissement that the Romans built their Arènes de Lutèce (the “Arenas of Lutetia”) in the 1st Century A.D. The arenas are now one of the most important remains of antiquity in Paris. Real gladiators fought to the death here. Gory. But part of the history of any place Rome occupied. You can actually see the arena. You even can stand in the middle of it if you want to.\n\nAnd it was also here in the 5th that the Romans built the Thermes de Cluny, a massive thermal bath complex constructed early in the 3rd Century A.D. Most of these baths were outside of Paris’ fortified walls and were destroyed in the late part of the 3rd Century by roving bands of barbarians. But parts of the baths remain well preserved and have been subsumed into an archaeological site at the Musée national du Moyen Age (the Museum of the Middle Ages), also sometimes called Musée de Cluny.\n\nSome view the Right Bank (north of the Seine) as the seat of business and commerce of Paris, and the Left Bank (south of the Seine) as the seat of academia, progressive thought, artists, and writers. And to a large extent that is true.\n\nToday the 5th Arrondissement consists of four distinct neighborhoods: the Quartier de la Sorbonne, Quartier Saint-Victor, Quartier du Val de Grâce, and Quartier du jadin des Plantes.\n\n[The map shown here is by Starus – Own work + tracés dérivés de OpenStreetMap.org, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=12787582]\n\nOf course the Quartier de la Sorbonne in 5e is largely a university area that includes the Marie Curie campus.\n\nThe Saint-Victor area of the 5th Arrondissement is where you find the old Roman amphitheater and also a very modern Arabic museum replete with all sorts of Middle Eastern treasures.\n\nThere is a hospital complex in the 5th’s Quarter du Val de Grâce today. But the first hospital was built on that location in 1645.\n\nAnd the Jardin des Plantes area of 5e is the main botanical garden in France. It’s only a 5-minute walk to Paris’ Museum of Natural History from the Jardin des Plantes.\n\nHere you see a typical narrow street in the Latin Quarter.\n\nFor orientation, the Metro stations in the 5th Arrondissement include:\n\nCardinal Lemoine\n\nCensier-Daubenton\n\nCluny-La Sorbonne\n\nGare d’Austerlitz\n\nJussieu\n\nMaubert-Mutualité\n\nPlace Monge\n\nSaint-Michel\n\nWhen you see any of these Metro stops, you can rest assured they are in the 5th.\n\nAnd if of these neighborhoods are mentioned or you see a location with the 75005 zip code, you can know with certainty that it’s in the 5th Arrondissement.\n\nBe sure to read my post on, the explanation of how Paris’ Arrondissement system works. It will make getting around in Paris far easier for you.\n\nAnd if you read my post on the 1st Arrondissement of Paris, you will see how the histories of the 1st and the 5th are deeply intertwined.\n\nWe can’t wait to share this beautiful and historic area of Paris with you.\n\nSo be sure to peruse our 2023 spring schedule.\n\nWe would love to see you in Paris this spring!"
