        "text": "5.9K\n\nIf you are going to Paris for the first time, you probably wonder what the best arrondissement to stay in is for a first-timer like yourself. But what neighborhood you should stay in will depend on the distance between the attractions you want to visit and the things you want to do. Alternatively, you can choose the next best location and place yourself between the attractions. The metro works perfectly, except for the occasional theft of belongings. Depending on the length of your stay, you will not be able to see everything you want to see, and you will need to plan strategically. Below is a guide for the best arrondissement to stay in Paris.\n\nOverview and map of arrondissements in Paris\n\nParis is divided into arrondissements (neighborhoods) – in total, 20. Before choosing the best neighborhood for you to stay in Paris, you should decide on the following:\n\nwhat do you want to do and see\n\nwhat is your budget is\n\nhow easy it is to get to different attractions – how near your accommodation to public transportation\n\nMost of the arrondissements have some attractions worth visiting. I would suggest doing no more than two attractions daily and getting all your tickets in advance if possible. Or even better, spend time seeing Paris by skipping the lines, especially during high seasons when several landmarks and museums have started limiting the number of visitors.\n\nWe stayed in the 8th Arrondissement twice and hadn’t been disappointed. If you are looking for views and a central location, Splendid Etoile Hotel next to Arc de Triumph on the border of the 17th and the 8th arrondissements is perfect for your stay in Paris. In my honest opinion, the 8th neighborhood is close to everything.\n\nWe stayed at the cozy and romantic 4* star Hotel Opera Marigny on our second visit to Paris. It was also located in the 8th arrondissement, with several restaurants and shops. The lovely street is just off the noisy and bustling avenue, with a few meters to several nice restaurants. One French restaurant, Cafe Sud, was especially super romantic with live music.\n\nBest neighborhoods in Paris\n\n1st Arrondissement – Old city of Paris\n\nThe 1st Arrondissement is the center of the old city of Paris and home to many beautiful historic buildings, The Louvre Museum, the adjacent Jardins des Tuileries, and The Place de la Concorde. This neighborhood is a great place to stay while in Paris. It is located on the right bank (Rive Droit) of the Seine, and you will be within walking distance of most of the top tourist attractions in Paris. Like most of Paris, the area is very safe, with many restaurants, shops, and hotels. One of the largest shopping centers in Paris is Forum Les Halles, located in the 1st Arrondissement. Because of the neighborhood’s central location, staying and dining here is quite expensive.\n\nThe Louvre\n\nThe Louvre museum – is impressive and huge but elegant. We waited in line for 1,5 hours to get in while visiting it in April. The Louvre museum – both the Louvre Palace and its artwork – is impressive and vast.\n\nIf you, by any chance, want to have dinner in this neighborhood, you should book a table at one of my favorite restaurants in Paris for an amazing souffle.\n\n2nd Arrondissement – a hidden gem?\n\nCompletely forgotten by tourists, this neighborhood will welcome you with cobblestoned streets, an intact medieval tower with a dramatic history, one of the best permanent markets in the city, edgy boutiques, and much more. 2nd Arrondissement is located near the city center, on the right bank of the Seine, not far from the Louvre and Tuileries gardens. A few of the main attractions in the neighborhood are La Tour Jean-Sans-Peur, the tallest medieval tower in Paris, and many of the passages and arcades.\n\n3rd Arrondissement – Concpiracy and Catholic history\n\nThe Marais district area is often called the “Temple,” if you are into conspiracies and catholic history, you will most certainly love to know why the area is referred to as such. There was once a medieval fortress that stood in the area. The fortress was built by the infamous military order, the Knights Templar, Paris. Like the 2nd Arrondissement, the 3rd Arrondissement is located near the heart of Paris but, luckily for you, is also forgotten by tourists. Long the aristocratic district of Paris, it hosts many outstanding buildings of historical and architectural importance. There are a few museums in the area; if you love history, Musée Carnavalet is a must. This is a Paris museum that highlights the city’s past and reveals its diverse personality. Unfortunately, the museum is closed for renovations until the end of 2019. You can visit The Hôtel de Soubise, a lovely Renaissance mansion that houses the French National Archives.\n\n4th Arrondissement – Medieval Paris\n\nThe 4th Arrondissement is at the heart of Medieval Paris. The Notre Dame, St. Chapelle, the National Museum of Art in the Pompidou Center, and Hôtel-de-Ville (city hall) are all located here. Although Notre Dame Cathedral had a tragic accident in 2019, it would be wrong not to include it in this post. Notre Dame Cathedral is one of the most known cathedrals in the world. Before the fire, you could climb 422 steps to the Notre Dame Bell Towers for a beautiful view of Paris and a close-up of Gargoyles. The line length to get into the Cathedral would depend on the season. In early spring, you would spend around 30 minutes getting in and about an hour getting up to the Bell Tower. They operated with two different entrances and separate prices for the Cathedral and the Towers. The view from the Bell Tower was lovely.\n\nThe Marais neighborhood, which spills from the 3rd Arrondissement into the 4th arrondissement, contains the Place des Vosges, the most beautiful square in Europe. The 4th Arrondissement is known for its cozy shops, gardens, and museums. Great to enjoy in all seasons, the area has become Paris’ most branché (fashionable in French) quarter.\n\n5th Arrondissement – Latin Quarter\n\n5th Arrondissement is located on the left bank of the Seine and is known as the Latin Quarter because the Sorbonne University professors and students all speak Latin. The neighborhood is considered the intellectual center of Paris and one of the liveliest in the city. If you want to experience the artsy and bohemian side of Paris, this might be one of the best places in Paris for you to stay. The Pantheon, a mausoleum for France’s most renowned philosophers, artists, and intellectuals, such as Voltaire, Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Zola, the Curies, and Alexandre Dumas, is located in the Latin Quarter. You should climb up to the top of the dome to get impressive city views.\n\nClick on the pin to save it to Pinterest\n\n6ht Arrondissement – Churches, gardens, and shopping\n\n6th Arrondissement, a somewhat conservative area of Paris, is known for a few Catholic churches, the gorgeous Luxembourg Gardens – Jardins du Luxembourg, and shopping. Luxembourg Gardens are located on the border between Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the Latin Quarter. The Gardens, inspired by the Boboli Gardens in Florence, were created upon the initiative of Queen Marie de Medici in 1612. The best time to visit the gardens would be late spring, summer, and early fall. The gardens cover 25 hectares of land and are filled with flowers, forests, ponds, statues, and fountains. It is a perfect place to visit if you travel with kids. Entering the gardens is free.\n\nThe 6th Arrondissement is known for its discounted designer stores, luxury flagships, concept shops, and unique local boutiques.\n\n7th Arrondissement – The Eiffel Tower\n\n7th Arrondissement is where you will find the icon of Paris – The Eiffel Tower. In this district, you will also find the Invalides – which holds Napoleon’s tomb and the Musée d‘Orsay. Here you can get a boat ride on the Seine while drinking champagne and enjoying beautiful views of Paris.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is a must-see, but the queues are long. There are three ways to see the views of Paris from the Eiffel Tower.\n\n1st floor – 57m up and glass floors. Here you can get a beautiful view of Paris and a meal at a restaurant.\n\n2nd floor – 115m up to enjoy the fantastic views of Paris. You can get dinner here at the Michelin-starred restaurant The Jules Verne.\n\nAt the top – 276m up, you can enjoy the most outstanding aspects of Paris while having a glass of champagne.\n\nGet your skip-the-line tickets for the 1st and 2nd floors and enjoy some of the best views of Paris.\n\nLa Conciergerie\n\nLa Conciergerie served as the Royal Palace for the King of France until the end of the 14th century when the King moved to the Louvre. La Conciergerie then took on a judicial role, and part of the palace was converted into prison cells. With a museum pass, you will get access to 60 museums in and around Paris, which will save you both time and money.\n\nMusee d’Orsay\n\nMusee d’Orsay is one of Paris’ most well-known art museums. Previously a railway station, it is now a proud holder of many exhibitions. Its architecture is amazing. It would be an excellent choice besides The Louvre.\n\n8th Arrondissement – the best arrondissement to stay in Paris\n\nThe Right Bank’s 8th Arrondissement is where you’ll find Paris’s glitz, glamour, and elegance. The neighborhood is expensive, with many restaurants, shops, and tourists. The Champs-Elysées, Arc de Triumph, famous fashion houses, elegant hotels, and restaurants are all located here. If you want the convenience of staying in the heart of Paris, you must pay the price. As in any overcrowded touristy area, the food and service in restaurants could be better, and the rates could be lower. Wander off the Champs-Elysées to small alleys and streets to get more authentic food and atmosphere. One exception to this would be the famous Ladurée. Ladurée is a restaurant and a tea room that serves fantastic pastries, macaroons, and chocolates. They have branches all over Paris, and I hope you taste their delicious pastries.\n\nArc de Triumph\n\nArc de Triomphe is an iconic landmark of Paris standing at the western end of the Champs-Élysées. The Arc de Triomphe honors those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I, and the view from the top of the arch is worth climbing the 284 stairs.\n\n9th Arrondissement – elegance, culture, and shopping\n\nThe neighborhood of elegance, culture, and shopping. In the 9th Arrondissement, you will find Palais Garnier – Paris’s elegant Opera House, Galeries Lafayette department store, and perfume museum, amongst several other things.\n\n10th Arrondissement – young vibe\n\n10th Arrondissement runs along with Canal St. Martin. The canal streets are car-free on Saturday afternoons/evenings and all day on Sundays. During the weekends, people cycle and rollerblade. This area is quite trendy among young people. You can enjoy the street performance festival if you are in Paris during the last two days of May.\n\n11th Arrondissement – nightlife\n\nIt is where you will find Opera Bastille and Place de la Bastille. The landmark “Trois Glorieuses” or “Three Glorious Days” is raised in memory of the July Revolution of 1830. In the 11th Arrondissement, you will also see Europe’s oldest circus hall, built in 1852. And if you are into French music, the Edith Piaf Museum is right up the alley. The neighborhood has a few good restaurants and great nightlife, making it a great place to stay in Paris. It is safer and less expensive than other parts of Paris’s neighborhoods.\n\n12th Arrondissement – Gare de Lyon\n\nParis’s busiest and most famous train station, Gare de Lyon, is in the 12th Arrondissement. In this neighborhood, you will also find Paris’ “lungs” – a huge green park, the Bois de Vincennes. Or how about visiting a Bercy village in the heart of Paris that consists mostly of small wine warehouses from the late 19th Century?\n\n13th Arrondissement – diversity\n\nThe 13th Arrondissement is another cobblestoned neighborhood where you will find another village in the city – Butte aux Cailles. This historically working-class district has become a favorite spot for artists and hipsters in recent years, attracted by the area’s abundant street art, lofts with leafy rooftops, and gourmet shops. The 13th Arrondissement is also known for its Asian community. If you are looking for a major Chinese New Year celebration, this is where you will find it, along with Asian restaurants, especially Vietnamese pho houses. This soup (with beef) is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes.\n\n14ht Arrondissement – the “new” neighborhood\n\n14th Arrondissement is one of the newest neighborhoods in Paris but can show off with the Montparnasse Tower and Paris Catacombs Museum. However, you will find historical wonders in this neighborhood, galleries with contemporary art, parks, and shops with artisan crafts.\n\nLe Catacombs\n\nLe Catacombs – a veritable labyrinth beneath the very heart of Paris. The ossuary contains the remains of millions of Parisians, who were transferred there gradually between the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries as graveyards were closed because of the risk they posed to public health. In the long maze of dark galleries and narrow passages twenty meters below ground, visitors can see a tableau of death with bones arranged in a macabre display of high Romantic taste.\n\n15th Arrondissement – markets, parks, museums, and shops\n\nThe 15th arrondissement starts just south of the Eifel Tower. Here you will find a few markets, parks, museums, and shops. Some of the main attractions of the 15th Arrondissement are:\n\n– a man-made island Île aux Cygnes which houses the replica of the Statue of Liberty\n\n– Musée Bourdelle dedicated to a sculpturer Antoine Bourdelle, a student of Rodin.\n\n– Grenelle Market is a food market that you will find open every Wednesday and Sunday, regardless of the weather.\n\n16th Arrondissement – literature and art\n\nHistorically, the 16th Arrondissement has been one of the most affluent districts in the city. The 16th Arrondissement was home to some of France’s dearest writers – Honoré de Balzac and Marcel Proust. Some famous museums reside here, and among a few are the Modern Art Museum of the City of Paris and the Marmottan-Monet Museum.\n\n17th Arrondissement – local living\n\nThis is a residential area that tourists forget. But if you would love to get the feel of local life, spend a day here. As young people have been priced out of more centrally located neighborhoods, the quiet 17th attracts a new generation to the area, resulting in restaurant and bar openings, a new nightlife scene, and pleasant walks and picnics.\n\n18th Arrondissement – Montmarte, Sacre-Coeur, and Moulin Rouge\n\nThe 18th Arrondissement includes lively, bustling immigrant neighborhoods such as Barbes and La Goutte d’Or. It is the home of Montmartre, Sacre-Coeur, Dali Museum, and Moulin Rouge, which makes it one of the most popular tourist attractions.\n\nThe Moulin Rouge\n\nThe Moulin Rouge – is best known as the spiritual birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site. Today, the Moulin Rouge is a tourist attraction, offering musical dance entertainment for visitors worldwide. The club’s decor still contains much of the romance of fin de siècle France.\n\nSacre-Coeur Basilica\n\nThe Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris is a Roman Catholic church. The Basilica is the second visited attraction in Paris and is located at the summit of the Montmartre – “The Mount of Martyrs,” the highest point in the city. The Basilica can be reached by bus or metro. At the top of the Butte Montmartre, you will find one of the most beautiful panoramic views of the capital, 130 meters above the ground. Visitors can also access the dome and get a 360° view of Paris. A short walk from the Sacré Coeur is the Place du Tertre, the district of Abbesses with its steep, winding roads, and the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret at the bottom of the hill.\n\n19th arrondissement – the French\n\nThis neighborhood in Paris is all about French citizens. You will find two public parks, a few museums, and Paris’ last lift bridge here. There are few attractions the size of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. But.. If you visit Buttes Chaumont Park, extend your stroll to La Mouzaïa Neighborhood with its narrow, car-free alleys, low houses, and gardens, and get these charming surroundings under your skin.\n\n20th arrondissement – the neighborhood of curiosities\n\nIt is a neighborhood with a few curiosities, such as Oscar Wilde cemetery, one of Paris’ most diverse bookstores, an Asian market, and street art. I am not sure about you, but going to a new place for the first time, I would at least try to get around some famous attractions. And you have quite a good overview of where you should stay in Paris for the first time.\n\nWhat arrondissement you should stay in on your first trip to Paris is basically up to you. I love the 8th arrondissement because of its location, but the 7th and 18th are also good choices. As mentioned earlier the metro runs smoothly and where ever you will stay I am certain you will have the best of time.\n\nParis Pass\n\nIf you are in Paris for a long weekend, I recommend you get a Paris Pass. It comes in three different ranges – both in price and duration. Paris Pass gives you priority access to over 50 attractions and museums, including the Palace of Versailles, the Hop on Hop off bus tickets, Seine River Cruise Quick entry, Map of Paris & Public Transportation, and a hotel pick up/drop off. A Paris Pass will give you free entrance to 50 museums, including the Towers of Notre Dame, free metro, bus, tram usage between zones 1 to 3, and much more. It also gives you discounts at a few restaurants and cafes. The Paris Pass operates at different prices for EU and non-EU residents and different age groups.\n\nClick on the pin to save it to Pinterest\n\nIf you have little time in Paris, choose one museum/landmark you want to do/see and find accommodation close to it. Parisian Metro works just fine and is easy to use. Sink into Paris and enjoy its sophisticated, laid-back, romantic atmosphere! If you are staying a little longer, don’t forget to visit the Palace de Versailles, just 40 min outside of Paris.\n\nYou can also check Sharon’s blog post on things to do in Paris if you need more tips.\n\nThe last time we visited Paris was one afternoon during our road trip. We stayed near Arc de Triumph and Champs Elysées to shop and stroll around. If you only have one afternoon in Paris, I recommend you pick one attraction and book your accommodation in the arrondissement next to it – this way, you get to see two neighborhoods at once.\n\nTo explore little less-known places, you should visit Beaune in Burgundy. The place was such a surprise, and I loved it – this small town is for everyone who loves French wine, French Chateaus, and French cuisine.\n\nBook a museum or Paris pass to save time, money, and hassle.\n\nClick on the pin to save it to Pinterest"
