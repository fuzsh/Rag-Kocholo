        "text": "Located on the Left Bank of the River Seine, the 5th arrondissement is mostly known for its student ebullience and its cultural wealth. In this district, you will find the famous Sorbonne University, prestigious high schools (Collège de France, Louis-le-Grand, Henri IV), museums (Musée de Cluny, Museum of Natural History, Insitut du Monde Arabe), and magnificent sites (the Panthéon, the Arènes de Lutèce).\n\nThere are also some good entertainment venues to attend a show in the 5th arrondissement, such as the Paradis Latin which is currently the only one cabaret of the Left Bank.\n\nAfter the Second World War, small cabarets spread on the Left Bank, especially in the Latin Quarter and its surroundings, near Saint-Germain-des-Prés and Saint-Michel. An intellectual and bohemian atmosphere reigned in these places and in the district which hosted them.\n\nAt the time, the most famous cabarets of the Left Bank were Le Tabou, L’Écluse, La Rose Rouge, Le Quod Libet or L’Échelle de Jacob. They were called “caves à chansons” (chanson cellars), since singers of poetic or political lyrics performed on their tiny stages, hoping to make a name for themselves. The greatest French singers and songwriters made their debut there, such as Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, Léo Ferré or Barbara. At the same time, the Left Bank cabarets also saw the emergence of a new form of theatrical and humorous performances, with the Frères Jacques or the mime Marceau.\n\nBecause of the advent of the yéyés and music industry in the 1960s, the cabarets of the Left Bank declined and were finally replaced by the cafés-théâtres and discotheques.\n\nHowever, there is a cabaret that had preceded them: the Paradis Latin. Located in the Latin Quarter, in the heart of the 5th arrondissement, the Paradis Latin is the oldest cabaret in Paris and now the only one cabaret on the Left Bank.\n\nInaugurated in 1803 by Napoleon, its basement lounge where people from all social classes mingled was, at that time, an important place for Parisian social life. After being destroyed by a shelling during the Franco-Prussian war, the Paradis Latin was rebuilt by Gustave Eiffel and reopened in January 1889. The shows were great successes. The Paradis Latin became the leading cabaret of the Left Bank, but lost momentum in the early 20th century.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, its reopening took place in 1977. Since then, the only one cabaret of the Left Bank has had one success after another with its shows that are alternately burlesque, poetic and sensual."
