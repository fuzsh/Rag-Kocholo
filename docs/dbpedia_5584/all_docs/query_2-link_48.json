        "text": "Institut du Monde Arabe de Paris\n\nIn continuing with our theme of Middle Eastern and North African influence on modern French culture New York Habitat reveals an entirely different kind of guided Paris tour. Besides being the home to one of Paris’ most interesting museums, the Institute of the Arab World is also the site of arabic-language courses, child activities, film showings and the start of the Paris-Arabe Historique: a walk through the streets of Paris’ 5th arrondissement. The guided walking tour takes visitors through the streets of the 5th arrondissement, taking special note of sites and monuments relating to the Arab influence on France. The quarter has many attractive apartments and New York Habitat can have you calling a vaction rental home in no time.\n\nThe Paris-Arabe History guided tour takes place every Saturday afternoon from late Spring to early Fall. The tour starts out at the College de France and La Sorbonne, two sites not normally thought of as anything but Français. This part of the tour highlights the intellectual curiosity of the French towards the Middle East during the reign of Francois the 1st. The tour then moves on to one of the oldest churches in Paris, the church Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre. Tour guides outline the relationship of France and Christian Arabs. The third stage of the walking tour focuses on the Arabic language. The 5th arrondissement is where the first printing presses and newspapers were introduced in Arabic and the dozens of Arabic bookstores and libraries in Paris are rooted in the quarter. The tour then arrives at the Mosque of Paris , one of the grandest Mosques in the West. The tour comes to an end back at the Institute of the Arab World and, if you still have the energy, guests can take in an exhibition or shop in the on-site store.\n\nWhile on the tour visitors will be enviously strolling by some of Paris’ nicest apartments. Instead of admiring the flats from afar why not move into one? Trust us, your friends at the Hilton will be jealous. New York Habitat has plenty of lovely vacation rentals in the 5th arrondissement.\n\n(Lots of light and hardwood floors define the look of this one-bedroom rental accommodation in Quartier Latin, St Michel – St Germain – Notre Dame (PA 1305). The building is on a quiet street and the apartment has a washing machine and dryer. Solo travelers and couples should take a look at this Studio vacation rental in St Michel, Grand Bibliotheque – Cite Universitaire (PA-2135). The apartment gets heaps of light and has some cool, Arab-inspired, design touches. To really impress your fellow travelers stay in this five-bedroom rental apartment in Luxembourg, St Michel – St Germain – Notre Dame (PA-2995). The apartment is enormous, unique, kid-friendly and quite funky. The decor and architectural style is whimsical, industrial and functional all at the same time."
