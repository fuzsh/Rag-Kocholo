        "text": "Did you know?\n\nThe Paris map shows the 20 different neighborhoods which are called arrondissements. In Paris arrondissements are named according to their number, which corresponds to an administrative district. For example, you might live in the 5th arrondissement, which would be written as 5Ã¨me (or 5e) in French. Looking at the Paris Map you can see that the districts spiral out from the center in numerical order. If you know the postal code of any address in Paris, you can easily identify which arrondissement it is located in because Parisian postal codes take the form of - 75XXX - with the last two digits being equal to the arrondissement (e.g. 75008 is the postal code for the 8th arrondissement). The suburbs are called the banlieues. The areas to the west of the city (Neuilly, Boulogne, Saint Cloud, Levallois, Versailles) are the most desirable and they are generally more peaceful than the city. Each of the Paris neighborhoods and arrondissements has its own special character which we'll try to describe below.\n\nWhich Paris Neighborhood is Best for You?\n\nIt's impossible to generalize each neighborhood, but the following should give you a broad description of the differences between the Paris neighborhoods and make it easier to get oriented on the Paris map. Also check out videos of the most scenic arrondissements and make hotel bookings for each Paris neighborhood."
