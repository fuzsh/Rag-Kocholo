        "text": "History of the Louvre\n\nwww.louvre.fr\n\nThe legendary Louvre Museum located in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, is one of the largest museums in the world in terms of size and number of works exhibited . It is to this day the largest museum of art and antiquities in the world.\n\nThe origin of the Louvre dates back to 1190, it became a royal residence under Charles V. The transformation from fortress to residence was undertaken in 1546 by adding a Renaissance-style wing. In 1594, Henri IV united the palace of the Louvre and the palace of the Tuileries to make a single palace.\n\nIt was not until the reign of Louis XIII that work began on the famous Cour Carrée. The modernization of the old medieval building into a Renaissance-style palace was led by artists such as Poussin, Romanelli and Le Brun. Everything came to a sudden halt when Louis XIV decided to move the royal residence to Versailles.\n\nLouis XV began the transformation of the Louvre into a museum, but it was the French Revolution that transformed it into the \"Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic\". The museum first opened in 1793 with works confiscated from the royal family and nobles. Subsequently, the collections have continued to be enriched by the spoils of war, donations, sponsorships and archaeological discoveries. To date, the museum has more than 500,000 works, including 36,000 on display.\n\nYou will find all sorts of different pieces of art with the most famous work being the magnificent portrait of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci which attracts millions of visitors each year. But also the famous Venus de Milo, the crouching scribe, but also one of the largest Egyptian collections outside Egyptian territory.\n\nThe Louvre Museum, classified as a Historic Monument, is a must in the city of Paris, suitable for everyone, whether you are alone, as a couple, as a family with your children, this museum will captivate everyone, guided tours in several languages are available visitors at the Louvre Museum ticket office and on their website.\n\nOpening hours\n\nEvery day except Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m."
