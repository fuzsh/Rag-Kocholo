        "text": "Municipal arrondissement in Île-de-France, France\n\nThe 7th arrondissement of Paris (VIIe arrondissement) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as le septième.\n\nThe arrondissement, called Palais-Bourbon in a reference to the seat of the National Assembly, includes some of the major and well-known tourist attractions of Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Hôtel des Invalides (Napoleon's resting place), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal,[2] as well as a concentration of museums such as the Musée d'Orsay, Musée Rodin and the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac.\n\nSituated on the Rive Gauche—the \"Left\" bank of the River Seine—this central arrondissement, which includes the historical aristocratic neighbourhood of Faubourg Saint-Germain, contains a number of French national institutions, among them the National Assembly and numerous government ministries. It is also home to many foreign diplomatic embassies, some of them occupying outstanding hôtels particuliers.\n\nThe arrondissement has been home to the French upper class since the 17th century, when it became the new residence of France's highest nobility. The district has been so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase le Faubourg—referring to the ancient name of the current 7th arrondissement—has been used to describe French nobility ever since.[3] The 7th arrondissement of Paris and Neuilly-sur-Seine form the most affluent and prestigious residential area in France.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 17th century, French high nobility started to move from the central Marais, the then-aristocratic district of Paris where nobles used to build their urban mansions[5] (see Hotel de Soubise), to the clearer, less populated and less polluted Faubourg Saint-Germain.\n\nThe district became so fashionable within the French aristocracy that the phrase le Faubourg has been used to describe French nobility ever since.[3] The oldest and most prestigious families of the French nobility built outstanding residences in the area, such as the Hôtel Matignon, the Hôtel de Salm, and the Hôtel Biron.\n\nAfter the Revolution many of these mansions, offering magnificent inner spaces, many reception rooms and exquisite decoration, were confiscated and turned into national institutions. The French expression \"les ors de la Republique\" (literally \"the golds of the Republic\"), refers to the luxurious environment of the national palaces (outstanding official residences and priceless works of art), comes from that time.\n\nDuring the Restauration, the Faubourg recovered its past glory as the most exclusive high nobility district of Paris and was the political heart of the country, home to the Ultra Party. After the Fall of Charles X, the district lost most of its political influence but remained the centre of the French upper class' social life.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the arrondissement hosted no fewer than five Universal Exhibitions (1855, 1867, 1878, 1889, 1900) that have immensely impacted its cityscape. The Eiffel Tower and the Orsay building were built for these Exhibitions (respectively in 1889 and 1900).\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arrondissement has a total land area of 4.088 km2 (1.578 sq mi; 1,010 acres).\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 7th arrondissement attained its peak population in 1926 when it had 110,684 inhabitants. Because it is the location of so many French government bodies, this arrondissement has never been as densely populated as some of the others.[citation needed] In 1999, the population was 56,985, while the arrondissement provided 76,212 jobs.\n\nHistorical population\n\n[edit]\n\nYear\n\n(of French censuses) Population Density\n\n(inh. pr km2) 1872 78,553 19,206 1926 (peak year) 110,684 27,075 1954 104,412 25,529 1962 99,584 24,360 1968 87,811 21,480 1975 74,250 18,163 1982 67,461 16,502 1990 62,939 15,396 1999 56,985 13,940 2009 57,442 14,045\n\nImmigration\n\n[edit]\n\nPlace of birth of residents of the 7th arrondissement in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 78.3% 21.7% Born in\n\noverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.5% 4.9% 7.4% 8.9% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as pieds-noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. A foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics.\n\n2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. An immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants.\n\nNotable residents\n\n[edit]\n\nSimone Veil (1927–2017)\n\nPierre Victor, Baron de Besenval de Brunstatt\n\nCityscape\n\n[edit]\n\nChamp-de-Mars view from the top of the Eiffel Tower\n\nThe Eiffel Tower\n\nSt. Louis Chapel of the Hôtel des Invalides view from avenue de Breteuil\n\nInside Hôtel des Invalides's Chapel\n\nView of rue de Solférino from the Léopold-Sédar-Senghor bridge\n\nThe Seine and the 7th arrondissement as seen from the Eiffel Tower\n\nTypical Parisian architecture in the 7th arrondissement\n\nPlaces of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nImportant places include:\n\nPalais Bourbon, meeting place of the National Assembly\n\nEiffel Tower\n\nHôtel Matignon\n\nHôtel de Boisgelin (Rue de Varenne, Paris), historic building, home to the Italian embassy in Paris.\n\nHôtel de Besenval\n\nChamp de Mars\n\nMusée d'Orsay\n\nÉcole Militaire\n\nHôtel des Invalides\n\nMaison de Verre\n\nMusée du quai Branly\n\nMusée national de la Légion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie\n\nMusée Maillol\n\nMusée de l'Ordre de la Libération\n\nMusée Rodin\n\nMusée Valentin Haüy\n\nInstitut d'Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)\n\nArt and industry\n\n[edit]\n\nMusée du quai Branly\n\nMusée national de la Légion d'Honneur et des Ordres de Chevalerie\n\nMusée Maillol\n\nMusée de l'Ordre de la Libération\n\nMusée Rodin\n\nMusée Valentin Haüy\n\nNational Horticultural Society of France\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nAir Liquide,[6] Alcatel-Lucent,[7] and Valode & Pistre have their head offices in this arrondissement.[8]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic and private high schools:\n\nLycée Victor-Duruy\n\nÉtablissement La Rochefoucauld\n\nInstitut de l'Alma\n\nLycée-collège Paul-Claudel\n\nLycée d'Hulst\n\nLycée Sainte-Jeanne Elisabeth\n\nLycée Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin\n\nLycée Thérèse-Chappuis\n\nIstituto Statale Italiano Leonardo Da Vinci, an Italian international school, maintains two campuses in the arrondissement.[9] The American University of Paris, a private liberal arts university, maintains several buildings near the Quai d'Orsay.[10]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Education have their head offices in the arrondissement.\n\nPolitically, the arrondissement is situated firmly on the right. The mayor of the 7th, Rachida Dati, was Minister of Justice under Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency and a member of the European Parliament for the centre-right UMP from 2009 to 2019. [11][12]\n\nIn the 2017 French presidential election, the 7th gave right-wing candidate François Fillon 52.7% of its votes in the first round, compared to his poor national showing of only 20%. It then went on to vote for Emmanuel Macron in the runoff by a landslide.\n\nElection Winning candidate Party % 2017 Emmanuel Macron EM 88.07 2012 Nicolas Sarkozy UMP 71.76 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy UMP 74.75 2002 Jacques Chirac RPR 89.17 1981 Valéry Giscard d'Estaing UDF 71.44\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arrondissement hosted the equestrian events for the 1900 Summer Olympics.[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
