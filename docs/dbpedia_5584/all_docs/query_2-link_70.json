        "text": "Whether you are a Parisian for a day or forever, who has never got lost in the alleys of the Latin Quarter dreaming of returning to a time that those under twenty cannot know?\n\nEnough of the musical interlude, Parisi Tour invites you in this article to take a leap back in time to discover or rediscover the history of this neighborhood that has seen far more life in its streets than one could imagine! Indeed, believe it or not, but it's here, a long time ago, that Paris began.\n\nFirst and foremost, it may be necessary to clarify that the Latin Quarter is located on the left bank of the Seine and extends from the 5th arrondissement of Paris to the northern part of the 6th arrondissement. As a geographical reference, we take the Sorbonne, which is considered its historical heart.\n\nFor a bit of history, before being called the \"Latin Quarter,\" it was known as the \"Pays Latin\" because as early as the 17th century, this part of the city was where many universities were located, especially the faculties of arts where Latin was studied.\n\nIf today the area is bustling with Greek restaurants and fast-food joints, it's not hard to find the student atmosphere that has prevailed there since the Middle Ages through its bars, cafes, and old bookstores.\n\nTo conclude, it's impossible to talk about the Latin Quarter of Paris without mentioning the Sorbonne, whose first building was founded in 1253 by Robert de Sorbon. At that time, the Sorbonne was a college for theology students within the University of Paris. From the 19th century under Napoleon, this building housed all levels of education and became the headquarters of the faculties of sciences, letters, law, medicine, and theology. In 1968, the Sorbonne was at the heart of the May demonstrations, including the first riot that erupted in the courtyard of the Sorbonne itself. Since then, it has remained a symbol of student protest and is regularly the site of student demonstrations and occupations."
