        "text": "If you're planning a visit to Paris, you've perhaps already come across the word \"arrondissements\" and maybe figured out that it somehow relates to location. But what exactly are Paris arrondissements?\n\nBasically, arrondissements are administrative districts. Despite being a fairly compact city, Paris contains 20 arrondissements. Instead of having names, they're known by their numbers: 1 through 20. So again, at a basic level each area designates a specific area, or part of the city.\n\nYou might reasonably think that if the numbers simply designate an administrative area, you don't need to give them another thought, right?\n\nBut in reality, you do because everyone uses the numbers to mean not only location, but much, much more.\n\nHere's why:\n\nEach of the 20 Paris districts has its own unique identity, history, and personality, and vibe, along with popular attractions, special events, and other interesting things to do and see.\n\nSo when someone says to you, \"You'd probably love staying in the 8th,\" that means that you might like the leafy Right Bank location as well as the many designer boutiques, wonderful bistros, occasional views of the Eiffel Tower, and elegant, upscale vibe.\"\n\nWhether you're planning your first visit or a return trip to the City of Light, knowing which Paris arrondissements have the attractions, activities, neighborhoods, and events you want to experience will help you make the most of your time, decide where to book a hotel room or reserve an apartment, and discover more to do and see nearby.\n\nIn our Paris Arrondissement Guide below, you'll find a quick explanation of the city's layout, an interactive arrondissement map, highlights about top neighborhoods, destinations, activities, major events, tours, and hotels in each district, the best arrondissements to stay in based on what you want to see and do, and tips for using the district numbers to help you plan your trip to Paris.\n\nWe've packed lots of useful information into this article, but it's long. If you're looking for details about a specific topic or district, use these Quick Links to find it fast:\n\nArrondissement Map\n\nArrondissements Guide: 1st Arr - 2nd Arr - 3rd Arr - 4th - 5th - 6th - 7th - 8th - 9th - 10th - 11th - 12th - 13th - 14th - 15th - 16th - 17th - 18th - 19th - 20th - FAQs\n\nTop photo: Paris arrondissement map, (c) Paris Discovery Guide\n\nParis Discovery Guide is a reader-supported publication.

Learn more\n\nParis Arrondissement Map: Understanding the City's Layout\n\nYou'll find single-digit arrondissements in the center of Paris, which is also the oldest part of the city. They are where you can explore most of the top historic attractions and not surprisingly, find the most tourists.\n\nAs you can see when you look at our Paris arrondissements map below, districts with higher numbers spiral out clockwise from the center (kind of like the shell of a snail, or that favorite French food, an escargot).\n\nThe city of Paris annexed most of the outer arrondissements such as the 18th, home to the Montmartre neighborhood, back in the 1800s when they were villages, and you can still experience plenty of their original charm.\n\nThey are mostly residential and aside from the gorgeous Sacre Coeur Basilica perched on the highest hill of Montmartre and a few popular attractions such as Atelier des Lumières in the 12th and Père Lachaise Cemetery in the 20th, you usually won't see many tourists.\n\nOur interactive Paris map shows the 20 arrondissements with attractions and landmarks, the city's two great forests, the Seine River, and top attractions plus a few key destinations outside of the city such as Versailles, Disneyland Paris, La Vallée Village discount shopping center, the La Défense business district, and the three closest international airports.\n\nZoom in to get a closer view of Paris streets and neighborhoods, or zoom out to see more of France.\n\nRight Bank, Left Bank, and the Seine River Islands\n\nThe blue line of the Seine River divides the city into the Right Bank (above the river) and the Left Bank below it.\n\nIn the middle of the Seine are two small islands, Île de la Cité and Île Saint-Louis.\n\nÎle de la Cité, the historic heart of the city includes parts of the 1st and 4th arrondissements. This is where the area's first settlers, a Celtic tribe called the Parisii, made their home over 2,300 years ago. It is also where you'll find some of the city's most famous attractions.\n\nÎle Saint-Louis belongs to the 4th district, and is a quiet residential area with 17th century homes, a main street lined with boutiques and bistros, and a few small upscale hotels.\n\nThe large green areas at each side of Paris (think of them as the snail's head and tail) represent two enormous tree-filled parks (bois), sometimes called the \"lungs\" of the city because their many trees contribute to the quality of the city's air.\n\nThe Périphérique: Paris's Circle Road\n\nOne final thing you should know about Paris's layout is that an almost-constantly congested multi-lane highway, the Périphérique (Parisians normally call it \"la Périph\"), circles the outer districts (but not the parks).\n\nIf you take a taxi or private transport to or from Charles de Gaulle Airport, you'll most likely experience the Périph first-hand - for better or worse. (Usually for worse, unless you're very, very lucky.)\n\nParis Arrondissement Guide\n\nNow, let's take a look at the landmarks and attractions that make each arrondissement special to help you choose where to stay and what to see and do during your visit.\n\n1st Arrondissement: Louvre Museum, Sainte-Chapelle, Les Halles, Tuileries Garden\n\nWhy visit: Famous attractions, spectacular gardens, and excellent cafés, restaurants, and boutiques pack the 1st arrondissement with must-see \"bucket list\" sights for first-time as well as returning Paris visitors\n\nTop Attractions in the 1st Arrondissement\n\nDiscover: The Louvre Museum, home to the Mona Lisa and many other treasured works of art.

Each arrondissement has a historic name in addition to a number. But there's no need to learn them because they are not normally used in daily conversation, directions, or much of anything else.\n\nYou'll almost always hear Parisians refer to districts by only the number. For example, \"She works in the 7th.\"\n\nConfused? Don't worry about it. By the time you've spent a few days in Paris, all of this will make more sense.\n\nThe practice of compartmentalizing Paris into administrative districts and numbering them sequentially dates back to 1795 when the city was divided into 12 arrondissements.\n\nIn 1860, Emperor Napoleon III more than doubled the size of the city by annexing 11 surrounding towns and expanding the number of arrondissements to the present 20.\n\nThe recent formation of \"Paris Centre\" by administratively combining the first four districts doesn't really change much. The only practical difference is that now the Paris Centre arrondissements share one mayor and one city hall. So don't worry - everyone still refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.\n\nIs a Quartier (Quarter) the Same as a Neighborhood in Paris?\n\nSometimes - but not usually.\n\nEach of Paris's 20 arrondissements contains four distinct quartiers (administrative sub-districts) and each quartier has a historic name.\n\nAlthough many quartier names such as Croulebarbe and Gaillon are no longer used in everyday conversation, others such as Les Halles (1st arrondissement), Sentier (2nd), Saint-Germain-des-Prés (6th) - serve double duty as neighborhood names, although (just to keep things confusing) neighborhood boundaries usually don't align with quartiers boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, some neighborhood names such Latin Quarter and Marais reflect what Parisians have traditionally called the area, and have no relationship at all to the names of their quartiers.\n\nFor example, the Latin Quarter covers an area in the 5th, 6th, and even a bit of the 13th districts where students from all other Europe gathered during the Middle Ages while studying at the Sorbonne University. They spoke Latin as their common language, and that's how this Paris neighborhood got its name.\n\nSimilarly, the chic Marais neighborhood spanning large swaths of the 3rd and 4th arrondissements used to be swamp land, and so Parisians called it (somewhat derisively) Le Marais (\"the swamp\").\n\nBottom line: Paris neighborhood names and locations within or across arrondissements are useful to know. Quartier names, not so much.\n\nWhat Arrondissement Has the Most Tourist Attractions?\n\nProbably the 1st arrondissement (although not everyone may define \"tourist\" attraction the same way).\n\nIn this old and historic Paris area, you'll find the Louvre Museum (former Palais du Louvre, home to Paris kings and queens, and now the world's most-visited museum.\n\nMore to the point, Paris 1 is where you can visit Sainte Chapelle with its stunning gorgeous medieval stained glass walls and wonderful classical concerts and La Conciergerie, a medieval palace and Reign of Terror prison. Both are located on Ile de la Cité - but only half of the island is in the 1st; the rest, including the part with Notre Dame Cathedral) is in the 4th.\n\nAcross the Seine on the Right Bank is the rest of the 1st, and that's where you'll find da Vinci's Mona Lisa) in the Louvre, Monet's famous water lily paintings in Musée de l'Orangerie, the Forum des Halles shopping center where the old Les Halles wholesale food markets once stood, some of the city's best kitchenware stores (including Dehillerin), part of the appealing Rue de Montgoreiul market street, along Rue Saint Honoré with its numerous designer boutiques, Tuileries Garden, and the Palais Royal Garden, just to name a few of the top attractions.\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, the 1st is where you'll find the super-popular Tuileries Christmas Market and Hotel de Ville Christmas Market.\n\nWhat Does \"1er\" Mean? What about \"1ère\"?\n\nThis is how Parisians (and everyone else in France) abbreviates \"1st Arrondissement\" (\"la premier\" in French) - and yes, there's a very short (\"1er\" or \"2e\" etc) and a slightly longer (\"1ère\" or \"2ème\") way (which you'll much less frequently see written as \"1ière\" or \"2ième\") to do this and both are used interchangeably.\n\nAlthough the longer version is technically incorrect, that doesn't stop people from using it - so don't be startled if you see it.\n\nHowever ... older street signs may show the arrondissement number as a Roman numeral - so if you're feeling fuzzy about whether \"IX\" means 9 or 11 (or maybe 4 or 6), brush up on those as needed. (This really isn't a quiz, but here's the \"answer\": IX = 9)\n\nHere's a cheatsheet with arrondissement numbers in English, French (along with Roman numerals), short and longer French abbreviations, and historical names in case you do happen to hear them:\n\nPin Now, Read Again Later"
