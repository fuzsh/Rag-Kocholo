Grand Palais, Napoléon, Julie Manet, Centre Pompidou, Georgia O’Keefe, Paris Philharmonic, Palais de Tokyo, Musée du Luxembourg, Cole Porter, Lido, and much more! From paintings and photography to music and magical objects, art in Paris is exploding now. Check out the list below of current and upcoming highlights.\n\nMany cultural institutions in Paris are still developing, rearranging, and rescheduling events and exhibitions. Some have schedules that can help with making a plan. Or, you may find an event that you will plan a trip around.\n\nBe sure to check the websites ahead of going. Many places require reservations.\n\nFrom Paris Museum Pass: In accordance with government directives, online booking of a time slot is compulsory in most sites, for all visitors (paying, free, holders of a Paris Museum Pass), to limit the number of people present at the same time.\n\nThis means that you cannot show up and expect to gain access even with a Paris Museum Pass!\n\nArrive early for scheduled times because of additional precautions the venues may be taking. Bring a face mask – a comfortable one. Many places require them for entry.\n\nDo not bring suitcases or large bags, including large backpacks.\n\nAlso, many venues are requiring a “Health Pass” for entry:\n\nA certificate of vaccination older than 14 days, or\n\nA certificate of RT-PCR or antigenic test less than 48 hours old, or\n\nA certificate of recovery (positive test of + 15 days and – 6 months)\n\nPLEASE CHECK WITH EACH INSTITUTION BEFORE GOING FOR CHANGES IN OPENING HOURS, REQUIREMENTS FOR VISITS, ETC….\n\n**All information was current at the time the post was written.**\n\nGrand Palais\n\nThe Grand Palais has a renovation underway. Scheduling shows partial completion in time for the Olympics in 2024. All remaining portions, including the galleries, are expected to be finished in 2025.\n\nBut, the Grand Palais is still mounting an exhibition! Take the Métro out to Porte de Pantin, in the 19th, to see a magnificent exhibition. The name alone fills up two football fields!\n\nNapoléon\n\nMarking the bicentenary of his death, the Napoléon exhibition explores the unlikely story of a complex character who was at once admired and controversial, victorious and conquered, heroic and tragic. A dramatic story that continues to fascinate our contemporaries to this day. It will highlight his political and cultural legacies that have profoundly impacted certain countries, chief among them France, as well as the mistakes he made. (From the official website.)\n\nNapoléon\n\nThrough December 19, 2021\n\nGrand Palais – Grande Halle de la Villette\n\n211 avenue Jean Jaures\n\n19th Arrondissement\n\nOpen everyday 10:00am to 7:00pm\n\nPurchase reserved-time tickets in advance HERE.\n\nMétro: Porte de Pantin\n\nOfficial website: https://www.grandpalais.fr/en\n\nMusée Marmottan Monet\n\nIt is always worth a trip to the Musée Marmottan Monet to admire the stunning house that the museum occupies as well as the collection of Monets. But, even more, a reason to visit is an exhibition of Berthe Morisot’s daughter.\n\nJulie Manet, the Impressionist Memory\n\nAs the only daughter of Berthe Morisot and Eugène Manet, Julie Manet was in a singular position to share her mother’s legacy with the world. Also, Julie Manet was the niece of Édouard Manet. She inherited plenty of genes that would contribute to her artistic sensibility. Not much information on the exhibit so far, but this is an interesting and little-known subject worth investigating.\n\nJulie Manet, the Impressionist Memory\n\nOctober 19, 2021, through March 20, 2022\n\nMusée Marmottan Monet\n\n2 rue Louis-Boilly\n\n16th Arrondissement\n\nOpen Tuesday through Sunday from 10:00 to 6:00 pm\n\nOpen late Thursdays until 9:00 pm\n\nClosed Mondays and major holidays\n\nMétro: La Muette ou Ranelagh\n\nRER: Boulainvilliers\n\nOfficial website: https://www.marmottan.fr/en/\n\nCentre Pompidou\n\nA lot is going on at the Centre Pompidou. It is definitely fulfilling its role to present “a centre for art and culture capable of housing both the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, with an international dimension, a large public library…, a centre for industrial creation and a centre for musical research and creation…, all together in one and the same building situated in the heart of the capital.” (From the official website.)\n\nGeorgia O’Keefe\n\nGeorgia O’Keefe in the Pompidou Center could be super fun to see!\n\nThe first retrospective in France of a hundred paintings, drawings, and photographs of one of the greatest figures of North American art of the 20th century. Disappeared at the age of 98, Georgia O’Keeffe (1887 – 1986) will have gone through most of the aesthetic adventures of the previous century: from the modernism of the 20s to the abstract painting “hard edge” in the 60s, through the search for identity that marks the United States in the 30s. (From the official website.)\n\nEttore Sottsass, Magic Objects\n\nMore than 400 works (drawings, paintings, design objects), 500 photographs, and 200 unpublished archival documents, from the 1940s to the 1980s: through this set and according to a chronological path, the exhibition highlights all the creative components of the Italian artist Ettore Sottsass (1917, Austria – 2007, Italy). It particularly highlights the emotional, ritual, symbolic, “magical” dimension of design that Sottsass has always claimed, quick to weave a new link between man and objects. (From the official website.)\n\nGeorgia O’Keefe\n\nSeptember 8, 2021, through December 6, 2021\n\nEttore Sottsass, Magic Objects\n\nOctober 13, 2021, through January 4, 2022\n\nCentre Pompidou\n\nPlace Georges-Pompidou\n\n4th Arrondissement\n\nOpen Wednesday through Monday 11:00 am to 10:00 pm\n\nExhibitions open 11:00am to 9:00pm\n\nOpen late Thursdays until 11:00 pm\n\nClosed Tuesdays and major holidays\n\nMétro: Rambuteau, Hôtel de Ville, or Châtelet\n\nRER: Châtelet Les Halles\n\nPanoramic restaurant: Restaurant Georges – prestige cocktails and dinner\n\nOfficial website: https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/\n\nParis Philharmonic\n\nInstalled in its new home, the Paris Philharmonic and the Paris Orchestra is in state-of-the-art digs. Reasonably priced tickets for an evening with magnificent performers who are at their finest. Various concerts of well-known works as well as new and rarely performed pieces that deserve attention.\n\nA real treat would be the weekend of 19-21 November 2021. Chucho Valdés is one of the key figures in the musical fusion between Cuba and Africa. With indefatigable fervor, at age 80, he continues to keep the flames of Afro-Cuban jazz burning bright. (From the official website.)\n\nCheck the calendar – there will be something you find interesting, plus you get to see the fabulous performance hall.\n\nPhilharmonie de Paris\n\n221 avenue Jean-Jaurès\n\n19th Arrondissement\n\nMétro: Porte de Pantin\n\nPanoramic restaurant: Le Balcon on the 6th Floor – closed Sundays\n\nOfficial website: https://philharmoniedeparis.fr/en\n\nMusée Carnavalet\n\nAfter 4 years of renovation, the permanent collection of the Museum of the History of Paris is open to welcome you.

The stunning building was built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition, like its neighbor the Grand Palais. It became a museum in 1902. Designed by Charles Girault, it is based on a trapezium shape and is made up of four wings around a semi-circular garden bordered by a richly decorated peristyle. The architect achieved a successful blend of traditional and modern architecture which is evident in the natural flow of visitors around the building and in the bold openings he created onto the Champs-Elysées gardens and inner courtyard garden. (From the official website.)\n\nIlya Répine (1844-1930); Painting the Soul of Russia\n\nThe Petit Palais presents the first French retrospective dedicated to Ilya Repine, one of the greats of Russian art. Little known in France, Repine’s oeuvre is nevertheless considered a milestone in the history of Russian painting of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some one-hundred paintings, including very large-format works, will be on loan from, notably, the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg, and the Ateneum Art Museum in Helsinki, Finland. The exhibition allows visitors to retrace the career of this illustrious Russian painter through his masterpieces.

A seemingly never-ending stream of contemporary exhibitions, some of which may bend your mind. Take your pick from a variety of shows scheduled for winter.\n\nJonathan Jones, untitled (transcriptions of country)\n\n“I’m curious about how we come to terms with objects that were collected and are now lost to the archive; how these objects can morph into new forms of dialogue, become tools of reciprocity and repatriation within the framework of decolonisation.” – Jonathan Jones.\n\nBorn in 1978 in Sydney (Australia) where he lives and works. untitled (transcriptions of country), Jonathan Jones’ new project, looks into colonial transport, trade, and the acclimatization of Indigenous plants, animals, and objects, together with the colonization of local knowledge. Its source of information is the French expedition to the southern lands led by Captain Nicolas Baudin at the very beginning of the 19th century. Commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, this was one of the most extensive scientific expeditions ever undertaken in Australia, which brought back to France many artifacts and living elements. (From the official website.)\n\nExhibition by Maxwell Alexandre\n\nBorn into a Catholic family in Rocinha, one of Rio de Janeiro’s largest favelas, Maxwell Alexandre envisages painting as a “prophetic practice”. His immense and highly politicized compositions stage encounters between classic European painting, street art, and mural painting. All these elements are remixed with the syncopated rhythms of hip-hop to resonate with the contemporary tensions of Brazil.\n\nA former professional rollerblader, Maxwell Alexandre graduated from PUC-RJ (The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro) in 2016. He organized his artistic baptism in 2018 with his first exhibition, which blended painting with performance and featured the rapper BK as priest and master of ceremonies. He also founded the “Church of the Kingdom of Art” (also known as “A Noiva” [“The Bride”]), which supports alternative Brazilian art practices. (From the official website.)\n\nJonathan Jones, untitled (transcriptions of country)\n\nNovember 26, 2021, through February 20, 2022\n\nExhibition by Maxwell Alexandre\n\nNovember 26, 2021, through March 20, 2022\n\nPalais de Tokyo\n\n13 avenue du Président Wilson\n\n16th Arrondissement\n\nOpen Wednesday through Monday 10:00 am to 10:00 pm\n\nClosed Tuesdays and major holidays\n\nMétro: Iéna and Alma Marceau\n\nRER: line C / Pont de l’Alma station\n\nTwo restaurants: Monsieur Blue and Bambini\n\nOfficial website: https://www.palaisdetokyo.com/fr\n\nThéâtre du Châtelet\n\nSumptuous gold and red velvet temple to the arts! Musical theater, dance, concerts, variety performances – it is all here. The Théâtre du Châtelet has come roaring back to life. Here are three events that could be great to see.\n\nNov 15-21: Voodoo Cello performed by Imany. The love marriage sorcerer of the low tones of Imany and eight cellos. With Voodoo Cello, the singer Imany casts a spell on eight cellos to transform some of the greatest hits of pop history (from Ed Sheeran to Cat Stevens, Donna Summer, Hozier, t.A.t.u., Bob Marley, Elton John, Neil Diamond…). Without any artifice, she uses the combined magic of the strings and her voice to bewitch the audience and awaken their consciences around the power of the feminine. (From the official website.)\n\nDec 11, 2021 – Jan 1, 2022: Cole Porter in Paris. Cole in Paris is conceived as a picture book, a fresco of sound and vision that transports us into the Roaring Twenties, evoking the personal journey of the man and the artist as much as the new breath of life that irrigated Paris after the Great War. (From the official website.)\n\nFeb 6, 2022 – Tap Virtuoso. Classical music meets American tap dance – Pianist François-René Duchâble and artist Aurélien Lehmann perform classical music masterpieces from Bach to Gershwin, in a show where piano and tap dance compete in mastery. A unique visual and musical performance that will make you (re)discover the history and evolution of “great music” to the rhythm of Tap Dance. (From the official website.)\n\nThéâtre du Châtelet\n\n2 rue Edouard Colonne\n\n1st Arrondissement\n\nMétro: Châtelet (exit Théâtre du Châtelet or Place du Châtelet)\n\nRER: Châtelet – Les Halles\n\nOfficial website: https://www.chatelet.com/en/home/\n\nLido de Paris\n\nParis Merveilles\n\nTHE show to see. Such fun, marvelous as its name implies, a great evening for the whole family. With seating for 1,100, you would think it would have plenty of room, but get your tickets well in advance!\n\nParis Merveilles\n\nLido de Paris\n\n116 bis avenue des Champs-Élysées\n\n8th Arrondissement\n\nShowtimes: 9:00pm or 11:00pm\n\nCan reserve dinner and a show, check the website for details and tickets.\n\nMétro: George V\n\nOfficial website: https://www.lido.fr/en\n\nMusée du Luxembourg\n\nBecause it is open late on Monday, this is a prime time to plan something to do in the evening.\n\nVivian Maier\n\nThe career path that Vivian Maier (New York, 1926 – Chicago, 2009) took is unusual yet is that of one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century. It was at the heart of American society, in New York from 1951, then in Chicago from 1956, that the children’s governess meticulously observed the urban fabric that already reflected the great social and political changes in its history. It was the time of the American dream and overexposed modernity, the behind-the-scenes of which constituted the very essence of Vivian Maier’s work.\n\nThe exhibition allows the public to see archives of the photographer that were discovered in 2007 and have not been seen before: vintage photographs that Vivian Maier printed, super 8 films never shown, audio recordings…. As such the exhibition allows the full extent of the eminent artist’s work to be appreciated, and for her work to be placed in the history of photography. (From the official website.)\n\nVivian Maier\n\n15 September 2021 – 16 January 2022\n\nMusée du Luxembourg\n\n19 rue de Vaugirard\n\n6th Arrondissement\n\nOpen every day 10:30 am to 7:00pm\n\nOpen late on Mondays until 10:00pm\n\nMétro: Saint Sulpice, or Mabillon\n\nRER: Luxembourg (exit Jardin du Luxembourg)\n\nOfficial website: https://museeduluxembourg.fr/en\n\nPalais Galliera\n\nMuseum of Fashion of the City of Paris. The Palais Galliera preserves some of the richest collections in the world. Estimated today at nearly 200,000 works (clothing, accessories, photographs, drawings…), these collections reflect the codes of clothing in France from the 18th century to the present day and are regularly the subject of numerous exhibitions in Paris, France, and foreign countries.\n\nVogue Paris 1920-2020\n\nOne hundred years of Vogue Paris, the oldest French fashion magazine still being published.

In this chronological tour, a number of spotlight displays pay tribute to the magazine’s faithful collaborators.

A group of collectors banded together with the idea of promoting the applied arts and developing links between industry and culture, design and production. For many years it was known as the Union centrale des Arts décoratifs (UCAD), but in January 2018 it changed its name to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. It remains true to its original goal “to keep alive in France the culture of the arts which seek to make useful things beautiful” and to maintain close links with industry, forging numerous partnerships with firms operating in various fields. (From the official website.)\n\nCartier and the Art of Islam. Origins of Modern Design.\n\nThe exhibition explores the influences of Islam on modern design through drawings, objects, and stories.

This exhibition shows the influences of the arts of Islam on the production of jewelry and precious objects of the House of High Jewelry, from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present day.\n\nMore than 500 pieces – jewelry and objects of the Maison Cartier, masterpieces of Islamic art, drawings, books, photographs, and archival documents – trace the origin of this interest in Oriental motifs. She returns in particular to the Parisian context of the time and the figures of Louis and Jacques Cartier, grandsons of the founder, who played a significant role in the birth of a new aesthetic imbued with modernity.

The exhibition invites a cross-rereading of the works of Rodin (1840-1917) and Picasso (1881-1973). These two great artists having permanently changed the artistic practices of their time for generations to come. It is not a question of showing what Picasso borrowed from Rodin, but rather of examining the significant convergences that appear between Rodin’s work and several periods of Picasso’s production.\n\nThis cross-reading of their works is available in different chapters on both places, at the Rodin Museum on the one hand through the crisis of representation of the early twentieth century, and at the Picasso Museum, on the other hand, the creative processes of the artists. At different times and in different contexts, Rodin and Picasso participate in a decisive articulation of history and this is undoubtedly one of the keys to their similarities. In their own way, they invented a new mode of representation, expressionist at Rodin, cubist at Picasso.

The sobriety of the initial material and the monumental presence of the sculptures contrast with the extremely meticulous and detailed nature of the cut-outs imitating the details of natural landscapes with perfection. She has been invited to take over the rooms of the Museum in the fall of 2021.
