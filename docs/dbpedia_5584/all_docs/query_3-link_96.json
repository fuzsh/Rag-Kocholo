        "text": "You can't miss the famous Orsay Museum, one of the most famous museums in the world, located in Paris' 7th arrondissement. Accessible by Metro or RER train via the Solférino and Musée d'Orsay stations, this exceptional site is based in the former Orsay station, which opened for the World's Fair in 1900 and whose décor lends its own special charm to the whole complex. A large gallery, immense glass roofs, a majestic clock… the setting of the place is impressive in its own right!\n\nYet Orsay is above all the museum of western art from 1848 to 1914. A real declaration of love for Impressionism and the Post-Impressionist movement, the Orsay Museum offers marvellous collections of paintings for its enchanted visitors to admire, as well as sculptures, decorative arts and photographs. There are many masterpieces on display, with creations by masters such as Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh and Rodin.\n\nNow fully renovated, since autumn 2011 the Orsay Museum has had a new temporary exhibition space, an amazing cafe with an \"aquatic dreamland\" theme and around 2,000 m² more space devoted to the decorative arts!"
