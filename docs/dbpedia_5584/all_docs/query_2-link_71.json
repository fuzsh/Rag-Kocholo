        "text": "The Jardin des Plantes neighbourhood is one of the largest in Paris. Indeed, the 18th administrative district of Paris, located in the 5th arrondissement, covers 79.8 hectares. To the west, we find the Val de Grâce district, to the north, the Saint-Victor district, to the west, the 4th and 11th arrondissements and to the south, the 13th arrondissement.\n\nTo delimit it, we suggest you start at the southwestern intersection of Boulevard de Port-Royal and Rue Pascal. Then, you have to proceed by Rue Mouffetard. When you arrive at Place de la Contrescarpe, turn right on Rue Lacépède, then left on Rue Linné and then immediately right on Rue Cuvier. Although the neighbourhood encompasses part of the Seine, we will stop before reaching the water and turn right on Quai Saint-Bernard. After that, take Boulevard de l’Hôpital, then Boulevard Saint-Marcel and finally take Boulevard de Port-Royal to complete the loop.\n\nHistory\n\nUndoubtedly, this district encompasses the entire fantastic Jardin des plantes of Paris. Created in 1626, it is a botanical garden and a research location. Thus, in addition to numerous green spaces, we also find greenhouses, a menagerie, but also the Muséum national d’histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History).\n\nThat is not all, however, since the Jardin des Plantes neighbourhood also includes many other sub-areas like the Faubourg Saint-Marcel which, for the anecdote, was nicknamed the “suffering suburb” because it was unattractive and very poor. It was not until Haussmann’s major urban planning works that it was completely transformed and given its current prestige.\n\nThe historical Faubourg Saint-Médard, which is very popular with tourists, can also be found in this district. Indeed, it met the same fate as the Faubourg Saint-Marcel, but was relatively spared by the destruction caused by the Haussmann urbanisation."
