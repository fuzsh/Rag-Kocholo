        "text": "Our podcast available at SPOTIFY, APPLE & AMAZON for this GUIDE!\n\nThe 5th arrondissement is the oldest arrondissement in Paris, and was first built by the Romans. Students historically studied LATIN at the UNIVERSITY from ancient times giving the neighborhood or “village” the title of “Latin Quarter”. Many writers, artists and diverse creatives lived in this part of Paris. The reputation for this quartier as the “boho” section populated by academics (just like my father) when he attended Sorbonne University during a sabbatical period. Our family lived nearby on (Rue Lacépède) that ran up to a square called LE CONTRESCARPE.\n\nLa Contrescarpe: Address: 57 Rue Lacépède, 75005 is a perfect stop to have a coffee and watch the passersby on the square. Our home was just down the street and later I sat here here and people watched on the square, often filled with musicians and dancers.\n\nOur family history in the neighborhood\n\nWe used to shop everyday on the RUE MOUFFTARD (“le Mouff”) carrying our market basket first to the butcher shop (“Le Boucherie”) (butcher) then “Le Fromagerie” (cheese shop) and “Le Patisserie” (pastry shop) ending at the vegetable seller in preparation for our daily dinners. My mom with her beginning French skills was welcomed in the neighborhood as an American family living like “everyday” French citizens, we were unusual in those days. The tradition of the markets on this famous street is still there, but now several restaurants are in some of their places. So, the shopkeepers I remember, are now gone. Fond memories of my mother and father from those days.\n\nWriters and Artists Lived Nearby\n\nHemingway used to live around the corner from “Le Contrescarpe”. In fact, he was inspired by and wrote about it in his book “The Movable Feast” so the area has gained a patina of literary history since the 1920s. Bookshops, antique stores and vintage stores can be discovered including: Shakespeare and Company and Abbey Bookshop. Both have communities of writers and readers that have contributed to the literary traditions of these hallowed places. Another famous place for English speaking readers is “The Red Wheel Barrow” bookshop. Alas, when I visited and lived in Paris in 2010 (the shop was below my apt) the owner was closing up shop and moving (with no future in sight). I discovered it is now located in the 6th and their local programs can be discovered here. What a lovely bookstore! Enjoy and I should say it is an “English” only bookstore.\n\nPlace Monge – (a metro stop) and the Rue Monge is one area where the character of the student life is still there; little has changed since I lived in nearby though it might have been a bit more 1970s funkier. As my local Metro stop, back in those days it was not a problem for young girls to ride those Metros, but his has changed. I only recommend the LINE 1 in Paris and ask that everyone travel safely via UBER or Electric Bicycle, or a Scooter (*alot of new eco options now).\n\nWhat to See in the 5th Arrondissements\n\nThe Panthéon.\n\nIn this monument, the greats of the French Nation are buried, and that includes (American Citizen) JOSEPHINE BAKER, Marie Curie (a dedicated museum also in the area) Victor Hugo, andNAPOLEON.\n\nThe Cluny Museum It is a medieval monastery built on the top of an ancient Roman foundation and considered one of the best museums to see about ancient history. Located also in the borderline area of the 5th/6th area.\n\nThe museum features LADY AND THE UNICORN TAPESTRIES – that are five scenes representing the five senses showing a medieval woman in a garden, accompanied by a Unicorn. The allegorical significance has been disputed over the centuries, but to see her in full display as five panels inside a carefully lighted room, is truly inspiring. “It is today, considered one of the great masterpieces of Western Art.”\n\nA section of the museum that is dedicated to its Roman history is also interesting for those who are passionate about ancient objects, art pieces and everyday objects. The museum allows you to go down several levels into this bath area and it is a true passage into the ages of time.\n\nOther things to do in the 5th:\n\nJardin des PLANTES– The Park located in the 5th Arrondissement, features the garden, natural history museum and the extraordinary skeletons of the wild animals waiting to greet you at the front entrance. Perfect for kids, this is a full day or afternoon in the Park and inside the museum. It is almost a display of how museums would have looked in the 19th century, as much of the museum remains in its original state, so be prepared for a bit of dust! We recommend the website that holds the key for your visit here with full information and guides.\n\nRue Mouffetard “Le Mouff” was supposedly so-named because of the mouffle, or “stink” from the river that used to run in the area, and is now gone.\n\nPlace de l’Abbé Basset: Featured in the film “Midnight in Paris” the time warp “window” to the past occurred on this very spot when Owen Wilson’s character is transported back in time to the 1920s in Paris.Address: 1 Rue Saint-Etienne du Mont, 75005\n\nVisit the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle – Here’s something oddly and completely different! This dusty (and ancient) building is full of skeletons. Like a veritable cabinet of curiosities that is great fun for the kids. Address: 2 Rue Buffon, 75005\n\nLE CAVEAU de la Huchette: Le Caveau de la Huchette at 5 Rue de la Huchette, 75005\n\nThis club (while a touristy stop) still attracts some of the most lively jazz players in Paris (*with the scene attached) so worth at least one visit. As you descend into the depths of the club, follow the straining sounds of the jazz quartets, singers and enjoy the cozy dance floor. Suggested as a group activity. @caveaudelahuchetteofficie\n\nAdditional Stops in the area:\n\nThe Grande Mosque, a beautiful historic location with a large garden and lively community. You can enjoy the calm and beautiful peaceful nature of this buildings and gardens and enjoy a cup of tea in the seasonal areas of the mosque that serves as a hub for the community. The historic importance of this unique building and community also played a part during WWII in the time of the occupation in Paris.\n\nThe Gobelins Tapestries Workshop/Museum Space. This is where historic tapestries in the chateaux and castles across France *and the world were created. The tapestries and the workshop are now part of a special French initiative to highlight the crafts and artisans of France. Imagine, when King Francis 1er wanted to keep his chateaux walls warm, it was a huge pictorial tapestry filled with allegorical characters that were featured in some of the works. The tradition also extended to Versailles, known also for their wall murals, as well as tapestries that keep the rooms warm. A great deal of work is also done in the field of restoration there as well.\n\n“Emily in Paris” – The life of Emily in Paris happens Here\n\nVisit the infamous square and park where much of the show is filmed. The exterior of the apartment where she lives, at 1 PL de L’Estrapade, 75005 is her “address” and a visiting spot for fans. The location has entered into the Pantheon of places where shows have been filmed, in Paris. In fact, if you wanted to spend a day searching for your favourite locations in Paris where famous spots have been filmed, there is a app/website for that! Discover these famous film locations from a fellow blogger “Almost Ginger” The Ultimate Guide\n\nWe hope you will enjoy our podcast of this episode!
