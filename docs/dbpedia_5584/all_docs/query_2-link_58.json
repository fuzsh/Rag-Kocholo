        "text": "Rent in the 5th arrondissement : full of history, of places to visit...\n\nThe Musée de Cluny and Le Panthéon respectively evoke the Middle Ages and the modern times whereas La Montagne Sainte-Geneviève clearly symbolises the student quarter. Among the arrondissement's 60,000 inhabitants, the most fortunate are undoubtedly those living in the characterful streets bordering Le Jardin des Plantes. The 5th also attracts many tourists with its Grand Mosque and historical remains. Is Paris 5, full of history? Yes, but also full of places to visit, full of large stone apartments, renovated for the majority, but still keeping this \"so Parisian front\". In the Val-de-Grâce neighborhood, you'll find numerous administrative or religious institutes ; and also some research or education institutes... The furnished rental has an undeniable advantage : you can find accomodation in the fifth district and enjoy quickly the arrondissement and its several assets.\n\nAn apartment rental in Paris 5 : a very lively... village!\n\nThe fifth district is an arrondissement especially favoured by singles with good incomes who appreciate life among the quiet streets of a comfortable residential neighbourhood, since they are living at very heart of the capital. Even if the Gobelins area and the area around La Gare d'Austerlitz on the edge of the district, attract slightly lower prices than the fifth-arrondissement average, the stone buildings on the Boulevard Saint-Michel and the distinctive narrow streets of the highly-rated Mauber-Mutualités area are much sought after by more affluent owners and tenants.\n\nThough it is fashionable, the fifth is not the most expensive residential district in Paris because some areas, like the Rue Mouffetard, still remain affordable. Verlaine, Hemingway and others had earlier boasted of this picturesque area near La Montagne Saint-Geneviève which housed the Grand Mosque. Those living in the fifth arrondissement often speak of it as a village, full of food shops in the Gobelins area (including a farmer's market well-known throughout Paris), neighbourhood schools, art house cinemas (including the cinéma du Panthéon, one of the oldest in Paris) and small historic theatres (the Théâtre de la Huchette, and the Théâtre Mouffetard). Several nationally recognised high schools (Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Lavoisier, and Lycée Louis-le-Grand) are all in the fifth arrondissement, which is served by four métro lines and Paris RER lines B and C.\n\nYou are seduced by the 5th arrondissement? Don't hesitate! With Lodgis and its wide range of furnished apartment rentals, everybody (regardless the income level) can rent an apartment in Paris 5.\n\nRental classifieds by number of bedrooms\n\nRental classifieds by number of rooms"
