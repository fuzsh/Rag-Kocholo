        "text": "The Latin Quarter, La Sorbonne, Rue Mouffetard, the Panthéon, the Jardin des Plantes and so much more — that’s what you’ll find in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. I spent a lot of time here when I was a student. It makes sense: the Latin Quarter is colloquially referred to as the quartier des étudiants, or the student quarter.\n\nLike the 6th arrondissement, it boasts a “quintessentially Parisian” look and feel. Haussmannian buildings as far as you can see, small manicured gardens and squares, cafés that line every street corner, and of course, plenty of boulangeries.\n\nHome to La Sorbonne (another, obvious, reason the area is teeming with young people), it’s also a place of so much history. Home to universities, colleges, and prestigious high schools since around the 12th century when the University of Paris was created, it’s easy to see why.\n\nThe 5th is another one of the older areas of the city that dates back to ancient times. You can find bits and pieces of this at what’s left of the local Roman amphitheater (oh, does your town not have one of those?) the Arènes de Lutèce, and at the thermal baths at the Cluny Museum.\n\nNow that you know what the cinquième once was — and continues to be, really — it’s time to learn more about what’s going on in the 5th these days. As with all of our neighborhood guides, I suggest you give yourself a least a few hours to visit all of the monuments, with enough time to wander and stroll too.\n\nThe Latin Quarter\n\nWhen discussing the 5th arrondissement of Paris, le quartier latin certainly deserves its own section. As I’ve explained already, it’s a hot spot for students for a few different reasons. First, it is home to several schools, including Paris’ most famous (cough, La Sorbonne, cough). Secondly, there are tons of bars, cafés, and restaurants that cater to the younger crowd so they’re very affordable.\n\nThat means it’s a great place for visitors on a budget, or expats who are sick of paying an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee. I like any place on the rue Soufflot for its prices and view of the Panthéon and le Jardin de Luxembourg.\n\nSpeaking of the Panthéon, yes, you’ll find that in the 5th too. I recommend popping in to look around — in case you didn’t know, it’s where many of France’s greats are buried, including Victor Hugo, Marie Curie, Jean Moulin, Rousseau, and Voltaire, to name a few.\n\nLa Sorbonne is also worth walking around to admire its rich history and architecture. And who knows, maybe you’ll be able to catch a glance inside if you time it right. In Paris, it pays to keep an eye on empty alleyways and open doors.\n\nRue Mouffetard\n\nThis now-famous street has become popular for tourists over the past 10 or 15 years but has managed to maintain its authentic vibe, at least in my opinion. Rue Mouffetard is known as one of Paris’ oldest and most vibrant streets and is home to a permanent outdoor market.\n\nHere you’ll find cheesemongers, bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, florists, bistros, cafés, wine sellers, and more. I used to love hanging out here in my very early Paris days — again, it’s quintessentially Parisian and makes you feel like you’re walking through a movie set.\n\nPlace Monge, which is just next door, is a nice place to sit and admire the views, and perhaps munch on whatever you just bought from the market. You’ll find the Grande Mosquée de Paris a few steps away, which is a lovely place for hot green tea and delicious Middle Eastern pastries. The architecture of its little outdoor terrasse is something to be seen as well.\n\nYou may want to head out to rue Mouffetard one morning, market bag in hand, to stock up on some fresh produce for a picnic. And if you’re feeling peckish and want something more substantial, my favorite place for lunch is Au P’tit Grec, a crèperie with one of the best vegetarian crepes I’ve ever had.\n\nLe Jardin des Plantes\n\nThe first time I visited the Jardin des Plantes I was with the children I used to nanny. Speaking of which, it’s a great place to spend a morning or afternoon with kids — not only is there plenty of space to run around but there’s also a Natural History Museum.\n\nYou’ll also find a zoo, greenhouses, a labyrinth, a dinosaur museum, and a myriad of botanical gardens to wander through. I think it’s such a great idea for visitors who come with kids and need a break from your standard tourist attractions.\n\nOn a nice day, you’ll be able to admire the Seine or go for a walk through the sculpture garden that has transformed one side of the river. If you’re taking the Batobus water taxi to get around, there’s a stop right in front of it.\n\nOf course, this is just an overview of what you’ll find in the 5th arrondissement in Paris. Again, make sure to give yourself enough time to wander up and down the winding streets. Give yourself permission to get lost here — you never know what kind of courtyard or historical building you may end up in front of.\n\nPhoto by Robin Ooode on Unsplash"
