        "text": "About the area\n\nThe 1st Arrondissement, located along the right bank of the Seine, is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Paris. The relatively small district is dominated by a few of the city's must-see attractions: the Louvre, the Palais-Royal, and Tuileries Gardens. In addition, the Forum des Halles in Les Halles is a well-known open-air shopping center, sunken below street level.\n\nTourists are always bustling through the 1st Arrondissement, making it one of the city's most crowded areas. But despite the crowds, it is extremely pedestrian-friendly and once you arrive, it's easy to cover the entire neighborhood on foot. Aside from several museums and numerous gardens, the 1st Arrondissement is dotted by beautiful churches, such as Sainte Chapelle. Though not as famous as Notre Dame, this chapel has gorgeous stained glass windows and intricate mosaics.\n\nLike most parts of Paris, the 1st Arrondissement has plenty to offer shopaholics and foodies alike. Though most of the shops are on the higher end, meals can be found for any price; if you're on a tight budget, head for a stand or a cart instead of a sit-down restaurant.\n\nSave this neighbourhood"
