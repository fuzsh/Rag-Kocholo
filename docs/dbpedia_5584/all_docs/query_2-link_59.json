        "text": "The Fifth : An Overview\n\nFull of the history of Paris' vibrant student life and still full of late-night haunts, the Fifth is a beautiful neighbourhood to explore on foot, stretching from the banks of the Seine and encircling the Jardin des Plantes, the Latin Quarter and the famous universities and institutions of Paris - including La Sorbonne, of course! The Romans were pretty busy in this neighbourhood, and even did us the huge favour of building the rue Mouffetard - still one of the most bustling thoroughfares in the neighbourhood. Merci Romans! While they were at it, they also built the nearby Arenes de Lutece -a Roman amphitheatre - and guess what? You can still see it! Find the location on our Handy Map of Lesser Known Historic Gems, right here.\n\nWhile perhaps one of the lesser well-known foodie destinations, the Fifth still has plenty to discover - including of course those lively bars and late-night revels!\n\nRestaurants\n\nLe Verre à Pied\n\nIf you love a typical French café and bistro, Le Verre à Pied on the ancient rue Mouffetard fits the bill perfectly. Tiled floors, chalkboard menus, locals having lunch - the perfect stop off on your explorations of the fifth.\n\n118 Rue Mouffetard\n\nLa Nouvelle Seine\n\nIt's a boat, it's a theatre, it's a restaurant, it's... La Nouvelle Seine. Why not stretch your sea legs and watch the water on the Seine as you dine?\n\nOpposite 3 quai de Montebello\n\nLe Porte-pot\n\nBlues on a Thursday night makes Le Porte-Pot a great spot to know about for those who love live music, it also serves good food in a cosy space full of wooden beams and candlelight.\n\n14 Rue Boutebrie\n\nNossa\n\nAll the liveliness and loveliness of Portugal - in the 5th! Nossa serves up delicious roasted chicken and sides in an almost street-food-style, enjoyed in a little dining room that feels like you've wandered into a local's kitchen! Charming and delicious.\n\n1 Rue de l'École Polytechnique\n\nLa Rotisserie d'Argent\n\nIf the Tour d'Argent is slightly out of your budget, why not get back to basics with a beautiful rotisserie chicken and slightly more affordable prices at this sister eatery. Chequered red tablecloths, well-stocked bookshelves, red banquettes - you can only be in Paris!\n\n19 Quai de la Tournelle\n\nSomething a little Special...\n\nProsper et Fortunée\n\nIf you want to feel like you're enjoying a home-cooked meal in a Parisian home, snag one of the 20 spots at this acclaimed restaurant to enjoy multiple no-choice courses that change every night - prepared right in front of you by chef Eric Lévy.\n\n50, rue Broca\n\nLes Papilles\n\nThis celebrated little bistro has long been a gem for many, with its tiled floors, handful of tables and prix-fixe menu.\n\n30 Rue Gay-Lussac\n\nRestaurant AT\n\nFranco-Japanese chef Atsushi Tanaka wows all those lucky enough to nab a reservation at this minimalist restaurant. Expect ingenious, molecular-inspired cuisine.\n\n4 bis, rue du Cardinal-Lemoine\n\nTour d'Argent\n\nOne of the most famous restaurants in Paris, Tour d'Argent also boasts one of the most amazing views and a history stretching back through the centuries. You may need to splash out a little to dine here, but you only live once!\n\n17 Quai de la Tournelle\n\nBars\n\nLe Piano Vache\n\nA favourite with the music lovers as well as the students of the fifth, this low-lit, ramshackle bar is a mainstay of the neighbourhood. Fantastic Gypsy Jazz on Mondays.\n\n8, Rue Laplace\n\nLes Pipos\n\nA neighbourhood favourite with a reliably lively atmosphere. Come for the wine, stay for the food.\n\n2 rue de l'Ecole Polytechnique\n\nCaveau de la Huchette & Caveau des Oubliettes\n\nIf you love jazz bars in typical Parisian \"caves\" (cellars) then these two music-loving addresses are for you. Jam sessions, concerts, swing, blues, Big Band - you'll find it all on the programme.\n\nCaveau de la Huchette - 5 Rue de la Huchette\n\nCaveau des Oubliettes - 52 Rue Galande\n\nCafé de la Nouvelle Mairie\n\nYou can look forward to a really fantastic array of natural wines here, not mention a bustling terrasse and honest French bistro fare. Just a couple of steps from the Pantheon.\n\n19 rue des Fossés Saint Jacques\n\nThe Bombardier\n\nIf you're in search of a friendly pub atmosphere, a pint and an English-speaking crowd, then the Bombardier is a great spot to know about. There are pub quizzes, sports, pub food and lots of people to get to know.\n\n2 Place du Panthéon"
