While the city is true to its reputation in many regards – it is indeed an infinitely romantic destination – , it has much more to offer than first meets the eye.\n\nWe, at Funbooker, have curated a selection of one-of-a-kind experiences that are sure to amaze and delight the most seasoned travelers: from helicopter rides over the City of Lights – capturing from a bird’s-eye view the myriad of architectural gems down below – to whimsical and adventurous treasure hunts uncovering the city’s lesser know marvels and secret spots.\n\nNot to mention vintage car tours roaming the capital’s picturesque streets. One thing is certain: Paris isn’t a city to be ‘visited’, it is a city to be ‘experienced’. Follow the guide!\n\nThe Top 20 Must-Visit Attractions in Paris\n\nAfraid of missing out on Paris’s must-visit attractions? Fear not! Here is your one and only bucket list to visit the French capital. From ancient monuments to modern gems, you’ll find here everything you need to plan your Parisian getaway. Let’s get cracking, shall we?\n\nThe Eiffel Tower\n\nWell… this first one probably won’t come as a surprise! Built in the late 19th century by world-renowned engineer Gustave Eiffel to mark a hundred years since the French Revolution, the Eiffel Tower definitely ranks very high on the list of Parisian top tourist attractions.\n\nWith a height of 330 meters (1,083 ft), the Eiffel Tower, nestled in the iconic Champ-de-Mars, offers breathtaking views of the French capital. A Champagne Bar on the top floor provides the perfect spot to take in the panorama while sipping on a glass of bubbly.\n\nThe Arc de Triomphe\n\nStanding tall on the Place Charles de Gaulle, just a stone’s throw from the iconic Champs Elysées, the Arc de Triomphe is yet another of the city’s top attractions.\n\nWhile construction was commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 to celebrate the French military triumphs, completion of the construction works stretched over decades.\n\nBy the time the Arc de Triomphe was inaugurated in 1836, Napoleon was long gone from power. Famous for its monumental dimensions and its stunning architecture, the monument is most definitely a must-visit.\n\nWe highly recommend visiting the Arc de Triomphe at 6:30 pm so you can catch a glimpse of the rekindling ceremony of the Eternal Flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\n👉 Book now\n\nThe Louvre\n\nMona Lisa awaits! Nestled in a former royal residence by the Seine, the Louvre is one of the most visited museums in the world… and rightly so! The museum is home to collections of over 35,000 masterpieces spread across 9 miles of galleries, stretching from Antiquity to the late 18th century.\n\nHighlights of the visit include Leonardo da Vinci’s famous Mona Lisa, a selection of ancient sarcophagi – as well as an Egyptian mummy – , the Winged Victory of Samothrace, the Venus de Milo, Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People, Géricault’s Raft of the Medusa… and of course, the signature glass pyramid!\n\nThe Sacré-Cœur Basilica\n\nNext stop: the Sacré-Coeur Basilica! Nestled in the picture-postcard Montmartre district, this iconic sanctuary was built between the late 19th and the early 20th centuries by the Church as an act of atonement in a context of political and military unrest.\n\nWith its immaculate façade and stunning mosaics, the Basilica soon became a symbol of the French capital, epitomizing the city’s romantic spirit and bohemian flair. Be warned, though: you’ll have to put in some effort and climb the 200 steps leading up to the Basilica to enjoy the view… (or you can simply take the funicular)!\n\nNotre-Dame of Paris\n\nThe muse behind Victor Hugo’s literary classic may have taken a blow – it was severely damaged in a fire in 2019 – , but it is still standing! The good news: while the cathedral construction spanned almost 2 centuries, it looks like the renovation works might only take 5 or 6 years! Notre Dame is set to reopen in 2024 or 2025 at the latest… fingers crossed!\n\nIn the meantime, you can still head to the Île de la Cité to admire the cathedral from a distance. Even now, it is still quite mesmerizing.\n\nThe Champs-Elysées\n\nWhile the French very much enjoy giving their monuments poetic sobriquets, they were quite straight to the point – if not humble – with this one and simply nicknamed the Champs Elysées ‘the world’s most elegant avenue’!\n\nSpanning 1.25 miles from the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elysées are a shopaholic’s dream come true! Hard to believe that the iconic avenue was initially designed by the famous landscapist André Le Nôtre as a quaint and picturesque retreat. Lined with chic boutiques and restaurants, it is quite literally one of the busiest spots in the French capital!\n\nThe Palais Royal\n\nA stone’s throw from the Louvre, the Palais Royal was once the residence of an array of illustrious figures, not least of whom were Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII, and Anne of Austria.\n\nCommissioned in 1628, the palace – which is surrounded by beautiful gardens – is a stunning example of classical architecture. It is now home to the iconic Comédie-Française, an illustrious theatrical institution. Head for the Court of Honor to have a peek of Buren’s Columns.\n\nThe Luxembourg Gardens\n\nIn need of a serene retreat after hours roaming the French capital? Look no further! The Luxembourg Gardens are a Parisian’s favorite for a leisurely stroll away from the city’s hustle and bustle. Commissioned in 1612 by the famous regent queen Marie de Medicis, the gardens are an urban oasis featuring traditional French as well as English garden designs. Nestled in the gardens, you’ll find the Luxembourg Palace, home to the French Senate.\n\nThe Marais\n\nHead to the vibrant Marais district to discover another side of the French capital! This historic area, renowned for its elegant hôtels particuliers, has become quite the bohemian hotspot, brimming with trendy boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries.\n\nIt is also the Parisian stronghold of the Jewish and LGBT communities. Highlights include: the stunning Place des Vosges, one of Paris’s oldest squares; the Marché des Enfants Rouges, Paris’s oldest covered market; as well as the Picasso and Carnavalet Museums.\n\nThe Banks of the Seine\n\nWith their emblematic booksellers and quaint cafés, the banks of the Seine, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991, are a local’s go-to for sunny strolls and Sunday picnics.\n\nSpanned by historic bridges – the Pont Neuf, the Pont des Arts, the Pont Alexandre III – and lined with iconic monuments, the riverside is truly a must-stop for any traveler looking to uncover the allure of the City of Lights.\n\nPigalle & the Moulin Rouge\n\nLooking to get off the beaten track? Head for the Pigalle district! With its historic cabarets, trendy concert venues, and vibrant nightlife, the area – home to the world-famous Moulin Rouge and its iconic French Cancan dancers – is definitely worlds apart from the French capital’s polished and elegant avenues. Be warned, though: the area may not be suited for kids. Often dubbed Paris’s ‘Red Light District’, Pigalle is notorious for its countless sex shops…\n\nThe Esplanade of the French National Library\n\nWhile Paris’s historic monuments, Haussmannian avenues, and quaint streets may paint the portrait of a city deeply rooted in the past, the French capital is also very much looking to the future.\n\nWith its four iconic glass towers, the Esplanade of the François Mitterrand Library – named after the French President who led the country throughout the 1980s – is a prime example of the French capital’s modern architectural achievements.\n\nPlace Vendôme\n\nNestled in the 1st arrondissement, just steps from the Louvre and the Palais Royal, Place Vendôme has become the epicenter of French luxury. Home to exclusive jewelers, the opulent square – designed by famous architect Jules Hardouin Mansart in the 17th century and lined with elegant hôtels particuliers – , also boasts one of Paris’s most luxurious hotels: the Ritz. Looming over the square, the Vendôme Column is a tribute to Napoleon Bonaparte’s military triumphs.\n\nThe Opéra Garnier\n\nA stone’s throw from the bustling Grands Boulevards, the Opéra Garnier (often referred to as the Palais Garnier) is a stunning example of neo-baroque architecture. With its grand marble staircase, its gilded statues, and its sumptuous crystal chandelier, the monument ranks high on the list of the French capital’s must-sees.\n\nUnanimously considered one of the world’s most beautiful opera houses, it is also famous for its elusive phantom, who inspired Gaston Leroux’s emblematic novel ‘The Phantom of the Opera’.\n\nThe Montparnasse Tower\n\nNestled in the 15th arrondissement, the Montparnasse Tower is yet another symbol of Parisian modernity.\n\nWhile this 690-foot-tall tower has now become one of the city’s most emblematic monuments, it was first met with a certain disapproval – if not outright opposition – when it was inaugurated in the 1970s, as many Parisians believed its modern aesthetic clashed with the timeless elegance of the French capital.\n\nThe Panthéon\n\nNext stop: the legendary Latin Quarter! The Panthéon was originally designed as a church dedicated to Paris’s patron saint – Sainte-Geneviève – and was later converted during the French Revolution into a mausoleum honoring the ‘Great Men’ of the French Nation. Behind its iconic facade blending Classical and Gothic inspirations, you’ll find the resting places of some of the country’s most illustrious historical figures, among whom are Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo and Marie Curie.\n\n👉 Book now\n\nThe Jardin Des Plantes\n\nIn need of a refreshing break after exploring the city from top to bottom? Head to the Jardin des Plantes, in the 5th arrondissement. Designed in the 17th century as a botanical garden for medicinal plants, the Jardin des Plantes has remained a center of learning ever since its creation. It is now home to the Natural History Museum, the fascinating Grand Gallery of Evolution, as well as a series of lush greenhouses showcasing plants from all over the world.\n\nThe Trocadéro Gardens\n\nNestled in the 16th arrondissement alongside the River Seine, opposite the Eiffel Tower, the Trocadéro Gardens offer breathtaking views of the emblematic Iron Lady (they are the go-to spot for taking postcard-worthy photos of the monument).\n\nWhile its orderly pathways are a favorite among tourists and locals alike for a lovely stroll away from the city’s hustle and bustle, the gardens also house several tourist attractions, including the Aquarium de Paris and the Palais de Chaillot.\n\nThe Parisian City Hall\n\nOriginally built in the 14th century – and later rebuilt in the late 19th century – Paris City Hall stands as one of the capital’s most iconic landmarks. Behind its stunning neo-Renaissance facade, the historic monument houses the city institutions and features several exhibition spaces that regularly host retrospectives about the French capital’s extensive history.\n\nThe Tuileries Garden\n\nReady to step back in time? Head to the Tuileries Garden, the French capital’s oldest French-style garden, for a journey to 16th-century Paris. Commissioned by Catherine de Medici – not to be confused with Marie de Medici, who ordered the construction of the Luxembourg Gardens… – the Tuileries Garden may very well be the most beautiful garden in the City of Lights.\n\nAdorned with sculptures by renowned artists including Rodin and Maillol, the garden is home to two sumptuous, albeit lesser-known, museums: the Musée de l’Orangerie and the Musée du Jeu de Paume.\n\nThe Top 20 Tourist Activities in Paris\n\nReady to spice up your getaway to the French capital?
