It is installed in the former Orsay train station, built by Victor Laloux from 1898 to 1900 and refitted as a museum by decision of the President of the Republic Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. The collections present Western art from 1848 to 1914, in all its diversity: painting, sculpture, decorative arts, graphic art, photography, architecture, etc. It is one of the largest museums in Europe.\n\nThe museum has the largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings in the world, with nearly 1,100 paintings 2 in total of more than 3,450, and can be seen as masterpieces of painting and sculpture such as Edouard Manet’s Breakfast on the Grass and Olympia, a proof of Degas’s Fourteen-year-old Little Dancer, The Origin of the World, A Burial in Ornans, The Painter’s Studio in Courbet, Card players Cezanne or five paintings of the series of Cathedrals Rouen Monet and Mill Ball Galette Renoir.\n\nTemporary monographic or thematic exhibitions periodically cover the work of an artist, a current or a question in the history of art. An auditorium hosts diverse events, concerts, cinema, shadow theater, conferences and seminars and shows specifically for a young audience.\n\nClick Refresh to view slides\n\nA museum in a station\n\nThe history of the Musée d’Orsay, of its building is quite unusual. In the centre of Paris on the banks of the Seine, opposite the Tuileries Gardens, the museum was installed in the former Orsay railway station, built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. So the building itself could be seen as the first “work of art” in the Musee d’Orsay, which displays collections of art from the period 1848 to 1914.\n\nThe station\n\nOn the eve of the 1900 World Fair, the French government ceded the land to the Orleans railroad company, who, disadvantaged by the remote location of the Gare d’Austerlitz, planned to build a more central terminus station on the site of the ruined Palais d’Orsay. In 1897, the company consulted three architects: Lucien Magne, Emile Bénard and Victor Laloux. The project was a challenging one due to the vicinity of the Louvre and the Palais de la Légion d’honneur: the new station needed to be perfectly integrated into its elegant surroundings. Victor Laloux, who had just completed the Hôtel de Ville in Tours, was chosen as winner of the competition in 1898.\n\nUnder the metal floor of Orsay railway station\n\n© RMN-Grand Palais (Musée d’Orsay) / Hervé Lewandowski\n\nThe station and hotel, built within two years, were inaugurated for the World Fair on July 14th, 1900. Laloux chose to mask the modern metallic structures with the façade of the hotel, which, built in the academic style using finely cut stone from the regions of Charente and Poitou, successfully blended in with its noble neighbours. Inside, all the modern techniques were used: ramps and lifts for luggage, elevators for passengers, sixteen underground railtracks, reception services on the ground floor, and electric traction. The open porch and lobby continued into the great hall which was 32 metres high, 40 metres wide and 138 metres long.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1939, the Gare d’Orsay was the head of the southwestern French railroad network. The hotel received numerous travellers in addition to welcoming associations and political parties for their banquets and meetings. However, after 1939, the station was to serve only the suburbs, as its platforms had become too short for the modern, longer trains that appeared with the progressive electrification of the railroads.\n\nFrom station to museum\n\nThe Gare d’Orsay then successively served different purposes : it was used as a mailing centre for sending packages to prisoners of war during the Second World War, then those same prisoners were welcomed there on their returning home after the Liberation. It was then used as a set for several films, such as Kafka’s The Trial adapted by Orson Welles, and as a haven for the Renaud-Barrault Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the Hôtel Drouot was being rebuilt.\n\nThe hotel closed its doors on January 1st, 1973, not without having played a historic role: the General de Gaulle held the press conference announcing his return to power in its ballroom (the Salle des Fêtes).\n\nIn 1975, the Direction des Musées de France already considered installing a new museum in the train station, in which all of the arts from the second half of the 19th century would be represented. The station, threatened with destruction and replacement by a large modern hotel complex, benefitted instead from the revival of interest in nineteenth-century architecture and was listed on the Supplementary Inventory of Historical Monuments on March 8, 1973. The official decision to build the Musée d’Orsay was taken during the interministerial council of October 20, 1977, on President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing’s initiative. The building was classified a Historical Monument in 1978 and a civil commission was created to oversee the construction and organisation of the museum. The President of the Republic, François Mitterrand, inaugurated the new museum on December 1st, 1986, and it opened to the public on December 9th.\n\nClick Refresh to view slides\n\nThe Gallery\n\nBrief History\n\nThe museum is located on the site of the Palais d’Orsay, built in 1810 and decorated with frescoes by Théodore Chassériau 3, which in 1840 hosts the State Council on the ground floor and two years later late the Court of Accounts on the first floor. It was burned down in 1871 during the Paris Commune and left in the state of ruins until the construction by Victor Laloux of the station of Orsay, former terminus of the Company of the Railway of Paris in Orleans, to welcome the visitors and foreign delegations from the 1900 World Exhibition.\n\nIts esplanade, to the west, was arranged in 1985 and endowed with numerous statues including the group called Statues of the 6 continents, initially installed on the terrace of the palace of Trocadéro during the world exhibition of 1878 4.\n\nThe Musée d’Orsay opened in the converted train station, the. To allow its transformation into a museum of arts of the nineteenth century, according to the will of the President of the Republic Valery Giscard d’Estaing, the building was reconfigured from 1983 to 1986 by architects Renaud Bardon, Pierre Colboc and Jean-Paul Philippon, laureates of an architectural competition organized in 1979, then joined by the Italian interior designer Gae Aulenti.\n\nIn the night of during the Nuit Blanche, individuals broke into the museum and seriously damaging a painting by Claude Monet, The Bridge of Argenteuil, dating from 1874, making a tear of 10 cm 5. The painting has been restored since.\n\nFacade of the Musée d’Orsay.\n\nClick Refresh to view slides\n\nCollections\n\nDecorative arts\n\nInaugurated at the Marsan Pavilion of the Louvre in 1905, the Museum of Decorative Arts was considered in 1879 on the site attributed to the station of Orsay in 1897, which will finally find this museum vocation in 1986. The Gate of Hell of Rodin, whose plaster is visible at the median level – terrace Rodin, was to constitute the monumental entrance.\n\nIn 1977, a collection of decorative arts objects from the 1848-1914 period was created at the Musée d’Orsay. Apart from the Charpentier dining room of 1900, reconstituted in a clean space ( period room ), furniture and objects are shown out of context. Consisting of representative works of the production of ceramics, glassware, jewelery and furniture, this collection testifies to the mutation of the production of objets d’art related to the industrial revolution, that of the fine arts applied to the industry. It has some masterpieces long unknown or poorly considered and also exhibits evidence of the exceptional quality of luxury industries of that time. The museum division of the collections of objects of art distinguishes by their location those produced under the Second Empire (1852-1870) and in the first two decades of the Third Republic (1870-1940) of those corresponding to the Art Nouveau style (to from 1890).\n\nPainting\n\nThe Musée d’Orsay exhibits and preserves the largest collection of Impressionist paintings (more than 480 paintings) 6 and post-Impressionists (more than 600 paintings 2 cloisonnists, neo-Impressionists, Symbolists, Nabis …) at world, as well as outstanding paintings of the Barbizon School, realistic, naturalistic, orientalist and academic, including foreign schools. Nearly 5,200 paintings make up the collection, but a large number of works, including some 1,720 paintings , including about 100 non-localized or destroyed, are deposited in public buildings or provincial museums, such as 20 of the 95 paintings 7 of Vuillard, 21 of Bonnard’s 87 paintings , 19 of 83 paintings by Renoir or 33 of Maurice Denis’s 79 paintings.\n\nThis non-exhaustive list lists the main painters represented at the Musée d’Orsay with the number of their works painted in the collections as well as the title of their main achievements, whether or not they are exhibited, given the regular renewal of the clashes. This list also mentions pastels, for the artists concerned: indeed, although not belonging to the painting department, a certain number of pastels are exhibited in the permanent collections of the museum.\n\nLawrence Alma-Tadema : 2 paintings\n\nCuno Amiet : 4 paintings including Schneelandschaft\n\nFrédéric Bazille : 6 paintings (the majority of his paintings are at the Fabre Museum ), including Family Reunion , L’Atelier de Bazille and La Robe rose\n\nÉmile Bernard : 12 paintings including Moisson by the sea and Symbolic self-portrait\n\nArnold Böcklin : 1 painting, Diane’s Hunt\n\nGiovanni Boldini : 6 paintings including Count Robert de Montesquiou and Madame Charles Max\n\nPierre Bonnard : 66 paintings and 2 pastels including the screen Women in the Garden, The Bourgeois Afternoon, The Lodge, The Pastoral Symphony, Woman sleeping on a bed and The Boxer (portrait of the artist)\n\nEugène Boudin : 18 paintings and 72 pastels\n\nWilliam Bouguereau : 11 paintings including Dante and Virgil, the Birth of Venus and Equality before Death\n\nGeorge Hendrik Breitner : 2 paintings\n\nJules Breton : 2 paintings, The Reminder of Gleaners and The Blessing of Wheats\n\nFord Madox Brown : 1 painting\n\nRupert Bunny : 1 painting\n\nEdward Burne-Jones : 2 paintings including The Wheel of Fortune\n\nAlexandre Cabanel : 7 paintings including the Birth of Venus\n\nGustave Caillebotte : 6 paintings and 1 pastel including Planers parquet and View of roofs (effect of snow)\n\nEugène Carrière : 85 paintings, including The Painter’s Family, The Sick Child, Intimacy\n\nMary Cassatt : 1 painting and 5 pastels\n\nPaul Cézanne : 45 paintings including The Gulf of Marseille seen from L’Estaque, Montagne Sainte-Victoire, The Card Players, The Woman with the coffeepot, Apples and oranges, Portrait of the artist with a pink background, Maincy Bridge, Baigneurs, The hangman’s house in Auvers-sur-Oise, Seated peasant , Still life with the kettle, Achille Emperaire, one of the five paintings on the theme of card players and Self-portrait (circa 1875)\n\nThéodore Chassériau : 5 paintings (the majority of his paintings are in the Louvre), including Le Tepidarium\n\nLovis Corinth : 2 paintings\n\nCamille Corot : 23 paintings (the majority of his paintings are in the Louvre), including A morning.
