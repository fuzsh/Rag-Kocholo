        "text": "Based in the East wing of the Tokyo Palace in the 16th arrondissement, the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris was inaugurated in 1961, then reopened in 2006 after a period of renovation. In this sober yet impressive building, located between the Guimet National Museum of Asian Art and the Alma - Marceau Metro station, it has some remarkable collections of modern and contemporary works for visitors to discover. Art is represented there in all its forms, from painting to video through sculpture, artistic performance and photography. Through over 10,000 works of art, the Museum of Modern Art presents trends such as Fauvism, Cubism and New Realism, and the greatest artists of the 20th century are represented there. With pieces by Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Léger, Braque and Zadkine, you can admire the best of modern artistic trends. Don't miss the famous Fée Électricité, an impressive, colourful mural painted by Raoul Dufy!\n\nTemporary exhibitions are regularly held there, and visitors can register to take part in art workshops."
