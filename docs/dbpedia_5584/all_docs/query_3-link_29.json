        "text": "Located in the luxurious 8th Arrondissement, just a short walk from the Champs Elysées and L’Arc de Triomphe, the Petit Palais is a beautiful art museum that is worth checking out. And it’s free!\n\nOnly in Paris could a place so grand and ornate be called “petite”, but compared to some other museums in the city, I guess it is!\n\nWhile taking on the Louvre or Musée d'Orsay can require a full day on your calendar, Petit Palais can be appreciated in just an hour or so. So you can get an art museum experience without a big commitment, in a neighborhood you are likely to be visiting anyway, if you are exploring the area along the River Seine. So, it’s a win-win!\n\nAbout the Petit Palais\n\nThe Petit Palais is not actually a palace but it does have a very interesting history. It was originally constructed for the Exposition Universelle (World Fair) of 1900. This was a highly anticipated event at the time and was visited by some 50 million people. I have a historic interest in World’s Fairs so this intrigued me.\n\nThe Grand Palais, located across the street, was also constructed as a venue for the Exposition Universelle, as well as the nearby Pont Alexandre III, the most decorative of the bridges transversing the Seine, famous for connecting the Champs-Élysées quarter with those of the Invalides and Eiffel Tower. So it’s a historic World’s Fair trifecta in the middle of the prettiest part of town. Another win, win!\n\nLa cerise sur le gâteau (the cherry on top) - it’s free!!!\n\nAs part of a network of municipal art museums, admission to the permanent exhibition is free to all. However, there are usually temporary exhibitions which do require paid tickets.\n\nBoth the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais have become important venues for modern art.\n\nCheck the schedule and book those tickets in advance, as they can get crowded for special exhibitions.\n\nAlthough free, they do accept donations - the rainbow colored bills of every kind in the collection bin struck me as appropriate in this colorful location. :)\n\nPetit Palais is also potentially a good spot to grab a coffee in the courtyard cafe located near the center garden. I say “potentially” because the cafe area was a bit crowded when we visited, so although we had planned to have a snack there, we opted not to. But the atmosphere was very nice and the refreshments others were enjoying looked good! Perhaps you might have better luck with finding a seat there than we did.\n\nThere are also bathrooms available - something hard to come by for free in Paris.\n\nWhat to see at the Petit Palais\n\nOur best advice for visiting the Petit Palais is just go wander through - you really don’t need a “mission”. The building itself is a work of art. In fact, the Petit Palais is considered an architectural masterpiece. Plus, it was designed with the flow of visitors in mind (since it was built for the Exposition), so it is easy to explore.\n\nCreated in the beaux-arts style by famous architect Charles Girault, it is based on a trapezoid shape and is made up of four wings around a semi-circular garden bordered by a richly decorated peristyle.\n\nIt’s such such an airy, open space with lots of daylight. It does feel very French with its richness of intricate details: what my father would have called the “cheesecake” decorative carved plaster along the painted ceilings, the pretty pastel marble on the walls, the beautiful mosaic walkways, the magnificent ironwork staircase, the picturesque courtyard and terrace café.\n\nThe permanent collection of the Petit Palais encompasses works of art from a wide range of periods, spanning from ancient Greece through World War I. Different period styles and perspectives are often juxtaposed with one another. Impressionists like Claude Monet are sometimes displayed next to more classical Renaissance masters. Medieval statues and religious items pop up unexpectedly. Because it was designed to educate, the arrangement of the permanent collection is a condensed lesson in art history, tracing from antiquity to the early twentieth century (about 1914).\n\nNotable works include paintings by Rembrandt, Delacroix, Rodin, Fragonard, Courbet, Monet, Cézanne and Modigliani. The museum also houses a rich collection of French decorative art, including furniture, fine metalworks, and ceramics.\n\nAfter Exposition Universelle closed, Petit Palais became the Museum of Fine Arts of the City of Paris in 1902.\n\nWhile most of the famous art museums in Paris are repurposed from other structures, the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais were specifically designed to display art. The details as such are thoughtful and exquisite. Though often overshadowed by its grander sister, there is plenty to see at Petit Palais. And it tends to be less crowded.\n\nYou can just walk the collections on your own or use the free app for a self-guided audio tour for a deeper appreciation.\n\nThe Entrance Gate and the Galleries of Statues\n\nThough never an actual palace, it’s designed to feel like one.\n\nThe main entrance gate, designed by Girault himself, is built to impress; it is well known for its elegance and craftsmanship - a reputation it truly deserves! Girault also personally created the banisters for the staircases in rotundas and the garlands and swags of wrought iron decorating the peristyle and balconies.\n\nTip: Although the grand entrance is, well, grand, and most everyone goes up the stairs and enters that way, there is another entrance to the right on the ground floor where there is usually no line. A friendly staff member directed us to it.\n\nThis entrance is downstairs, and you have to pass through a quick metal detector and bag check, but there was absolutely no line and the staff was very friendly.\n\nThere are nice clean bathrooms and a visitors desk on this floor, so it's a good spot to stop if you need a restroom or just a minute to catch your breath (we were walking quite a lot when we went here!) and to pick up a map and get some info.\n\nJust a little personal note, I was rather delighted to see a statue of Sir Winston Churchill on the grounds of the Petit Palais! While that seems incongruous, the city of Paris seems quite fond of dear old Winston and a surprising number of things are named for him. In fact, the Petit Palais is located on Avenue Winston-Churchill.\n\nIt’s quite a large statue too! Though, not the best likeness, IMHO.\n\nInside the gallery, the structure is intended to be lit by natural light only. There are huge windows that reach up to the high ceilings and transparent domes that pour light into the space.\n\nTwo large galleries of statues grace both sides of the entrance. This is a nod to the 19th century noble class custom of putting up statues in both public and private spaces.\n\nHours & admission info for Petit Palais\n\nPetit Palais is located at:\n\nAvenue Winston-Churchill 75008 Paris\n\nTel./Phone: 33 +1 53 43 40 00\n\nwww.petitpalais.paris.fr\n\nOpen Tuesday to Sunday from 10 am. to 6 pm\n\nLate night Friday and Saturday until 8 pm (only for temporary exhibitions)\n\nAdmission to the museum is free; however, the temporary exhibitions require a paid ticket, which usually costs about 15€.\n\nPetit Palais is busiest in summer and in December (well, all of Paris is busy in December!) But at other times of year, the crowd is quite manageable and you shouldn’t have to wait to enter.\n\nYou can also use the Paris Museum Pass for no queuing and unlimited entry to all Paris Museums’ exhibitions.\n\nPhotos are allowed at Petit Palais so have fun clicking away! :)\n\nThis post was researched and written by Debbie of the Empty Nest Explorers.
