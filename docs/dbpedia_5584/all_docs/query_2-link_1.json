        "text": "The Fifth arrondissement is home to one of the most famous monuments in Paris: the Panthéon. Located on the Left bank of River Seine, it is known as the Latin Quarter. The 5th arrt. is one of Paris’ oldest districts and visitors like it for its lively atmosphere.\n\nA few words about the 5th arrondissement\n\nThe Fifth arrondissement of Paris (le cinquième arrondissement) is situated on the left bank of River Seine. It often bears the name “Quartier Latin” (Latin Quarter).\n\nWhy part of the 5th arrondissement is called Latin Quarter?\n\nThe Latin Quarter takes its name from the Middle Ages when Latin was the language of learning at the Sorbonne.\n\nIt is considered Paris’ oldest district, along with Île de la Cité.\n\nIndeed, remains from the Roman era are still visible today. Check out for:\n\nthe Gallo-Roman baths of Cluny\n\nthe remains of the Roman Forum (to discover in the stairs leading to an underground carpark!), and more dramatically,\n\nthe Arena of Lutetia\n\nThe Latin Quarter is a district centred around the Sorbonne. It is home to many universities, colleges, and prestigious high schools. The district has a reputation for being a young lively atmosphere.\n\nIt is also remembered as being a major site for the events of May 1968. The student revolt led to a political, social, and cultural protest with barricades set up. And torn-up paving stones used as missiles!\n\nThe 5th arrondissement: facts and figures\n\nThe 5th arrondissement of Paris covers an area of 2.541 km2 with a population of 60,800 (2011). The district is overlooked by the dome of the Panthéon. The monument sits at the top of an elevated mount called Montagne Sainte-Geneviève (alt. 61 m above sea level).\n\nThe 5th arrt. includes some famous Parisian monuments such as the Panthéon, the Arab World Institute, and the National Museum of Natural History (including the Grand Gallery of Evolution).\n\nThe Latin Quarter is home to prestigious and historic universities and colleges: the Sorbonne university, the Jussieu university campus, Lycée Henri IV and the medieval Clovis Tower, Ecole Nationale Supérieure…\n\nTwo large public parks border the 5th arrt.: the Luxembourg Garden to the West and the Jardin des Plantes to the East. The latter includes the Ménagerie (France’s oldest public zoo).\n\nA number of historic streets criss-cross the district. For example, Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris’ oldest street. Rue Mouffetard boasts a colourful and lively market.\n\nWhere to stay in the 5th arrondissement?\n\nHotels in Paris vary from stunning luxurious places like the Ritz and the Meurice to much simpler hotels in charming older parts of the city. However, due to its central location, you will find the level of prices of all types of accommodation quite high in the 5th arrt. Depending on your budget, might want to find cheaper accommodation further away from the hyper centre of Paris!\n\nHere is a map showing the nearest accommodation:\n\nBooking.com\n\nPublic institutions and organisations in the 5th arrt\n\nA few public institutions and organisations have their seat in the 5th arrt:\n\nthe Sorbonne University (founded in the mid-12th century. This is one of the oldest universities in Europe)\n\nthe Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale et de la Recherche (Ministry of Higher Education and Research)\n\nthe Val de Grâce (major military hospital)\n\nMain places of interest in the 5th arrondissement\n\nThe 5th arrondissement includes one of Paris’ most famous monuments: the Panthéon. There are many other places of interest to be discovered. Most of them are situated on the slopes of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève and near the banks of the River Seine.\n\nThe main places of interest in the 5th arrondissement are:\n\nthe Panthéon >> Get your Priority Entrance Ticket! <<\n\nthe Banks of River Seine from Pont de Sully to Place Saint-Michel\n\nthe Arena of Lutetia (Roman ruins)\n\nthe Jardin des Plantes\n\nthe Paris Mosque and its minaret\n\nthe Institut du Monde Arabe (Arab World Institute)\n\nthe picturesque street of Rue Mouffetard\n\nthe dome of the Val de Grâce church\n\nthe College of Bernardins with its Gothic hall\n\nthe place Saint-Michel and its monumental fountain\n\nthe side-streets of boulevard Saint-Michel: rue Saint-Séverin, rue de la Huchette, rue du Chat qui Pêche (the fishing cat), rue de la Harpe (one of Paris’ narrowest streets).\n\nthe rue Saint-Jacques, Paris’ oldest street.\n\nMuseums in the 5th arrt.\n\nthe Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle and the Grand Gallery of Evolution >> Get your Priority Entrance Ticket! <<\n\nthe Ménagerie (France’s oldest zoo) >> Get your Priority Entrance Ticket! <<\n\nthe Police Museum (free entrance)\n\nthe Thermes and Hôtel de Cluny (National Museum of the Middle-Ages). Note that the museum is undergoing restoration. Therefore the complex is partially opened. Until the end of renovation works (Spring 2021), you have restricted access to the frigidarium, the Gallo-Roman baths (guided tours only), the Lady and the Unicorn tapestry, a selection of treasuries (70 items) and temporary exhibitions. More info…\n\nHistoric churches in the 5th arrt.\n\nThe district also includes a number of historic churches:\n\nSaint Séverin-Saint Nicolas church (13th-14th centuries) – Flamboyant Gothic. Look for the pillar in the shape of a palm tree in the ambulatory!\n\nSaint-Julien le Pauvre church (early 13th century) – Romanesque and early Gothic. This is one of the oldest churches in Paris.\n\nSaint-Étienne-du-Mont church (15th-17th centuries) – Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance. The church is the only one in Paris which has kept its rood screen.\n\nSaint-Jacques du Haut-Pas church (16th-17th centuries) – Neo-Classical\n\nSaint-Médard church (15th-18th centuries) – Flamboyant Gothic\n\nSaint-Nicolas du Chardonnet church (17th-18th centuries) – Neo-Classical\n\nShopping recommendation in the 5th arrt.\n\nThe 5th arrondissement isn’t maybe the most exciting shopping district in Paris.\n\nThat said, you can expect to see a number of bookstores as it’s an area full of students, and you’ll also find lots of typical cafés.\n\nHere are a few addresses I spotted/visited when strolling in ‘le Quartier Latin’:\n\n👉 If you’re interested in old books and prints, check out the bouquinistes on the banks of the River Seine.\n\n👉 Don’t miss the picturesque and colourful market of Rue Mouffetard. The lively street happens to be a shopping one with great food stores (bakery, butcher, caterer…)\n\n👉 Boulevard Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Germain are the busiest streets of the 5th arrondissement with many cafés, restaurants and shops.\n\n☕️ You’ve probably heard of Shakespeare & Co, Paris’ oldest bookstore. Did you know the vintage institution opened its own coffee shop? Sit outside and enjoy the view of the towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral (37 Rue de la Bûcherie).\n\n🥖 According to the 2019 competition for the Paris’ best baguette, the best boulangerie is in the 5th arrondissement called Paris & Co Écoles, 4 bis rue des Écoles.\n\n🛌 Looking for a place to stay?
