        "text": "Clint Eastwood is an Academy Award winning actor and director whose remarkable career has spanned more than seven decades, and at age 90, he is still actively working on projects.\n\nEastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco, California. He was raised in California, and after a string of varied and random jobs as a young man he was drafted into the army after the onset of the Korean War. He spent the war stationed at Fort Ord in northern California. During this time, he survived a non-combat involved plane crash by swimming more than two miles to safety.\n\nNot well received early on as an actor, Eastwood was criticized for the way that he talked through his teeth, which would become a trademark of his acting throughout his entire career. In the early 1950s, he had many unsuccessful auditions and a string of small nonconsequential movie roles (mostly uncredited) that didn’t ever amount to much. His first role on TV was in 1955 on a series called Allen in Movieland, a comedy show on NBC. He would make appearances in movies and television shows throughout the rest of the 1950s. During this time, he would land a role on the CBS western Rawhide, which would prove to be the breakout role of his career.\n\nEastwood was an integral part of the launching “spaghetti westerns” to popularity in the 1960s, and found more success as the sixties rolled on, although he was not at all critically acclaimed at this time. In 1970, he starred in Two Mules for Sister Sara and Kelly’s Heroes, both of which were better received than his past movies.\n\nIn 1971, Eastwood made his directorial debut with Play Misty for Me, which was produced by his Malpaso Productions and gave him the artistic control and freedom that he had longed for in establishing the company. The movie was reasonably well received by audiences and critics alike. 1971 was also the year that began the Dirty Harry series that many viewers best remember Eastwood for.\n\nOver the next forty years, Eastwood would go on to star and direct in many movies, some critically acclaimed, while others were not. Some of his more famous movies during this time included: The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Every Which Way but Loose (1978), Honkytonk Man (1982), Pale Rider (1985), Unforgiven (1992), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), Space Cowboys (2000), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Gran Torino (2008) and Sully (2016).\n\nEvery movie that Clint Eastwood appeared in after his role in Kelly’s Heroes was produced by his own production company Malpaso Productions. Eastwood formed the company with his long time financial manager, Irving Leonard, in 1967. He did not file for a trademark for the name Malpaso until November of 1993. This was just three years before Malpaso expanded to include a recording label, which was also submitted for trademark registration with the USPTO in November of 1996, along with the name Malpaso Records. The gap in time between the founding of the company and the application to trademark the name should not come as a surprise, though, as Eastwood himself did not trademark his own name until 2004.\n\nEastwood was an accomplished pianist and composer and composed much of the music for the soundtracks of his movies including Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby and J. Edgar, just to name a few. His Malpaso Records is a Warner Bros. Records-distributed imprint.\n\nEastwood’s deal with Warner Bros. to distribute much of both his movies and music has been a valuable and enduring relationship that has helped to propel Eastwood and his Malpaso company to success.\n\nThroughout his career, Eastwood has acted in more than 75 movies and produced more than 30, as well as releasing scores of music. He is quite accomplished having received many awards in all of the genres, including 41 Academy Award nominations with 13 wins and 33 Golden Globe nominations with 8 wins.\n\nOutside of entertainment Eastwood is also an entrepreneur. He has an interest in real estate and founded his own real estate company, Tehama, which he received the trademark rights for in December of 2005. He is known for his extravagant and diverse portfolio of homes and properties, the most famous of which is his $20 million 15,949 square foot home in Carmel by the Sea, CA.\n\nAlthough he received a trademark registration for “The Clint” in 1999 in association with men’s, women’s and children’s apparel, his clothing brand “Tehama” for his Tehàma Golf Club is the clothing line he found the most success with.\n\nClint Eastwood still resides in his native California and is still active as an actor, director and composer. He enjoys taking time out to golf at his Tehàma Golf Club, as he is an avid golfer, and he dedicates much of his time and efforts to charity. Eastwood is said to be worth around $375 million."
