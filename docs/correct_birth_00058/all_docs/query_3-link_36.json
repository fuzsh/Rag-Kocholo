        "text": "How old is Clint Eastwood?\n\nClint Eastwood was born on May 31, 1930. He celebrated his 93rd birthday in 2023.\n\nFull name Clinton Eastwood Jr, he was born in San Francisco, California.\n\nHis parents were Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (n√©e Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife and later IBM clerk.\n\nHe also has a younger sister named Jeanne Bernhardt.\n\nHow did Clint Eastwood get his start in acting?\n\nClint Eastwood had several jobs, including lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.\n\nHe tried to enroll at Seattle University in 1951, but was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War.\n\nWhen a production was shooting in Fort Ord, a production assistant reportedly spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director. Eventually, he landed an audition for Arthur Lubin. However, while his presence was welcomed, his acting was \"quite amateurish\".\n\nLubin suggested that Clint attend drama classes, and he later signed a contract. He was initially criticized for delivering his lines through his teeth, which would become a lifelong trademark.\n\nIn May 1954, Eastwood made his first audition for Six Bridges to Cross but was rejected. After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role in Revenge of the Creature (1955).\n\nAfter years of minor roles in film and TV, in 1958 Clint was cast as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide, and his career breakthrough had finally come. He was almost 30 at the time.\n\nHow many times has Clint Eastwood been married and how many children does he have?\n\nClint Eastwood has had a colourful personal life, to say the least, and has had various casual and serious relationships, many of which overlapped.\n\nHe has eight known children by six women, only half of whom were officially acknowledged.\n\nClint has continued to refuse to confirm his exact number of children, and there have been various discrepancies regarding the number. His biographer, Patrick McGilligan, has said that Eastwood's total number of children is unclear and that \"one was when he was still in high school.\"\n\nClint Eastwood's first marriage was to manufacturing secretary Margaret Neville Johnson in 1953, having met her on a blind date. During their relationship, he had an affair that resulted in his daughter, Laurie (born 1954), who was adopted by Clyde and Helen Warren of Seattle.\n\nThe identity of Laurie's biological mother is not publicly known, but McGilligan has said the mother belonged to a theatre group Eastwood took part in.\n\nOther affairs included a 1959 to 1973 relationship with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis, that produced a daughter, Kimber (born 1964).\n\nJohnson and Eastwood had two children together: Kyle (born 1968) and Alison (born 1972). Kyle is a famous musician who has composed music for nine of his dad's films. Alison is also an actress who has appeared in a number of films, including playing Clint's daughter in his film The Mule.\n\nIn 1975, Eastwood and married actress and director Sondra Locke started living together. She had been married since 1967 to Gordon Anderson, an unemployed homosexual man.\n\nEastwood finally divorced Johnson in 1984, but Locke remained married to Anderson until her death in 2018. Eastwood separated from Locke in 1989.\n\nOutside of his relationship with Locke, Eastwood fathered two children, Scott (born 1986) and Kathryn (born 1988) with Jacelyn Reeves, a flight attendant. Scott is also a famous actor, appearing in several Fast & Furious movies.\n\nDuring the early-to-mid-1990s, Eastwood had a relationship with actress Frances Fisher, that produced a daughter, Francesca (born 1993). Francesca is also an actress and reality TV star.\n\nClint Eastwood married for the second time in 1996 to news anchor Dina Ruiz, who gave birth to their daughter Morgan in the same year. Their marriage ended in 2014."
