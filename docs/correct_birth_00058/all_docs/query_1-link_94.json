        "text": "Happy Birthday Clint Eastwood. The legendary actor, director and producer turns 93 today. Born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, California, the acclaimed filmmaker has had a remarkable career winning four Academy Awards and having been nominated a total of eleven times. Movies he has directed have earned a total of 41 Oscar nominations.\n\nEastwood’s big break came in 1958 when he was cast as Rowdy Yates on the CBS television Western series “Rawhide”. In 1963 he landed the lead role in “A Fistful of Dollars”, a landmark Spaghetti Western directed by Sergio Leone. Eastwood and Leone would collaborate for two more films, “For a Few Dollars More” and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”. The trilogy made Eastwood a bonafide movie star and his career would skyrocket from there.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s Eastwood would both star and direct several Westerns, action comedies, dramas, war movies and psychological thrillers. And he continued to give us memorable characters from Harry Callahan to Josey Wales to Preacher. He didn’t slow down in the 1990s and the 2000s, delivering strong nuanced performances in movies like “Unforgiven”, “Million Dollar Baby” and “Gran Torino”. In the 2010s he kept working behind the camera, directing “J. Edgar”, “American Sniper”, “Sully”, and “Richard Jewell” among others. And this year he’s directing his 41st and final feature film, “Juror No. 2”.\n\nThat only skims the surface on what has been one of the greatest careers in cinema history."
