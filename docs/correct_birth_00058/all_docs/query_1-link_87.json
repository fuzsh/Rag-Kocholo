        "text": "Legendary Hollywood star Clint Eastwood turns 90 on Sunday. In honor of that milestone, we are taking a look at his stellar and sometimes controversial career.\n\nClinton Eastwood Jr. was born on May 31, 1930, in San Francisco. He was raised in Oakland, after moving from town to town as his father sought work during the Great Depression.\n\nIn his mid-20s, he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as “Revenge of the Creature” and “Tarantula” while paying the bills by digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role as Rowdy Yates in the long-running TV show “Rawhide.”\n\nOff to Italy\n\nEastwood’s roles in spaghetti westerns made him an international star, but that didn’t happen overnight. His first film directed by Sergio Leone was shot in 1964 but not seen in the U.S. until 1967-68 for copyright reasons.\n\nOnce he was back in the U.S., Eastwood’s career took off as a leading man and director.\n\nConsidering his long and storied career, we thought we would go ahead and make your day by testing your Eastwood knowledge.\n\nHere are nine trivia questions:\n\n1. Eastwood was a mayor of a California city from 1986-88. What city was it?\n\nA) Monterey\n\nB) Carmel\n\nC) Big Sur\n\n2. Eastwood has been nominated for many Academy Awards but only once as an actor. What was the name of the character he was nominated for?\n\nA) Walt Kowalski\n\nB) Bill Munny\n\nC) Harry Callahan\n\n3. Eastwood has several composer credits. What film was his first as composer?\n\nA) “Any Which Way You Can”\n\nB) “Mystic River”\n\nC) “Magnum Force”\n\n4. What film received criticism for falsely claiming a reporter slept with a law enforcement official to get information on a criminal suspect?\n\nA) “Play Misty for Me”\n\nB) “Richard Jewell”\n\nC) “The Gauntlet”\n\n5. Which film did Eastwood not win a best director Oscar for?\n\nA) “Million Dollar Baby”\n\nB) “Letters from Iwo Jima”\n\nC) “Unforgiven”\n\n6. What was the name of Eastwood’s character in “High Plains Drifter?\n\nA) “Blondie”\n\nB) “The Stranger”\n\nC) “Pardner”\n\n7. Which film did he not play Harry Callahan in?\n\nA) “Sudden Impact”\n\nB) “City Heat”\n\nC) “The Enforcer”\n\n8. Who costars with Eastwood in “Two Mules for Sister Sara?”\n\nA) Sally Field\n\nB) Shirley MacLaine\n\nC) Sondra Locke\n\n9. Which film did Eastwood famously say, “Go ahead — make my day”?\n\nA) “Dirty Harry”\n\nB) “Sudden Impact”\n\nC) “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly”\n\nBTW: In 2005, the American Film Institute did a list of the 100 most famous movie quotes and the line “Go ahead — make my day” was ranked sixth.\n\nANSWERS: All are B. Rating: Perfect score you’re a “Million Dollar Baby”; less than six you’re a “Fistful of Dollars.”\n\nEastwood was one of the first people inducted in the California Hall of Fame. Here’s a look at his films since 1995:\n\nTop five films\n\nThese are the highest-ranked films of Eastwood’s career on the movie site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nYou can hear Clint sing several songs and other recordings here.\n\nSources: California Hall of Fame, Rotten Tomatoes, Imdb, American Film Institute, ClintEastwood.net"
