        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actor , Director , Producer more\n\nBirth name Clinton Eastwood Jr.\n\nNationality American\n\nBirth May 31, 1930 (San Francisco, California – United States)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn to an accountant father, young Clinton led a nomadic life with his parents. He does odd jobs without much conviction, then leaves for the army, where his encounters lead him to work at Universal . He made his first appearance on screen in 1955 in Revenge of the Creature , then moved on to small anecdotal roles.\n\nHis rise began with a role in the series Rawhide . Between 1956 and 1958, he appeared successively in Never Say Goodbye , The Rope is Ready , Escapade au Japon ,and This is War . Struggling to break through in his country, Clint agrees to go to Italy, and it is thanks to Sergio Leone and the trilogy A Fistful of Dollars , And for a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that he becomes very popular. Having become a star in a few years, Eastwood returned to the United States and created his own production company, Malpaso Productions , thus offering himself a little independence. From his meeting with Don Siegel was born a beautiful friendship and a long collaboration (five films, including The Prey , Inspector Harry and Escape from Alcatraz ).\n\nCapitalizing on the success of When Eagles Strike (1968), Eastwood, who specialized in westerns and detective films, moved behind the camera in 1971 with A Shiver in the Night . The following year, Inspector Harry (which would have four sequels), in which he played a violent cop, established him even more among the general public. He then continued to direct and star in his own films: The Man from the High Plains (1972), Josey Wales Outlaw (1976) and Honkytonk Man (1982).\n\nBird , a film about the life of Charlie Parker , confirms the director’s passion for jazz. In 1992, his western Impitoyable , with its twilight atmosphere, was acclaimed by his peers: the film won four Oscars including those for Best Film and Best Director. The actor/director, then aged 65, was at the top and demonstrated, as the years went by, a maturity that made his cinema grow. Still with the dual role of director and actor, he shocked people in On the Road to Madison then continued with Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil , Judged Guilty , Space Cowboys and Credence of Blood .\n\nIn 2003, Clint Eastwood signed the drama Mystic River , starring Sean Penn , Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon , which brought him up the steps of the Cannes Film Festival for the fourth time. Two years later, with the drama Million Dollar Baby , the filmmaker won again, twelve years after Impitoyable , the Oscar for Best Film and Best Director. The success of the film is total, its actors Hilary Swank and Morgan Freemanbeing crowned Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.\n\nClint Eastwood then changes register and decides to create a diptych around the battle of Iwo Jima: Memories of our fathers for the American point of view, and Letters from Iwo Jima for the Japanese point of view. In 2008, this cinema legend went on to direct two films, The Exchange , a drama led by Angelina Jolie , and Gran Torino , which marks his big return in front of the camera. The film won the César for Best Foreign Film, and Eastwood announced that it was his last performance as an actor.\n\nIn 2010, the director gave the role of politician Nelson Mandela to Morgan Freeman in Invictus , with Matt Damon . The latter is illustrated again in Eastwood’s next film: Beyond , a twilight reflection on a possible life after death. After Mandela, it is the turn of FBI Director John Edgar Hoover to be the subject of the director’s treatment in J. Edgar , with an unrecognizable Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role. In 2012, Clint Eastwood finally reprized his acting role for the film Another Chance , directed by Robert Lorenz .\n\nHe then took the reins of a genre he had never tackled before by directing the lively Jersey Boys , the film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name created in 2005, about the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In 2015, American Sniper was released, which follows the journey of Chris Kyle, the most fearsome sniper in American history and who is said to have killed more than 200 people during his entire military career. The following year, he directed Tom Hanks for the first time in Sully , the exceptional story of the pilot who ditched a plane on the Hudson.\n\nIn 2018, Clint Eastwood directed Le 3:17 p.m. to Paris , bringing to the screen the true story of three Americans who aborted a terrorist attack on the Thalys train linking Paris to Amsterdam in 2015. The following year, he started on stage in The Mule, where he plays a man close to bankruptcy who decides to transport drugs for cartels. This film, again inspired by a true story, enjoyed solid critical success. Wanting to pay tribute to Richard Jewell, a security agent made a hero for having reported the presence of a bomb in Atlanta in 1996 and then designated as public enemy No. 1 by the FBI and the media, Clint then directed The Richard Case Jewell , worn by the unknown Paul Walter Hauser .\n\nIn 2021, the tireless San Francisco native returns with Cry Macho . It portrays a fallen rodeo star who goes to Mexico to find a troubled teenager who he must then bring to Texas."
