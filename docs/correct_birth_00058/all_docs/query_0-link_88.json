        "text": "Clint Eastwood Jr. was born in San Francisco, California, on May 31, 1930, to Clinton Eastwood, Sr. and Margaret Ruth. His father worked for the pulp and paper giant Georgia-Pacific before becoming an IBM clerk. Jeanne Bernhardt is his younger sister (born in 1934). Eastwood's ancestors are Scottish, English, Irish, and Dutch. Clint Eastwood's career in Hollywood has ranged from being born into a middle-class household to being a hugely successful actor-director-producer. It's difficult to think that this renowned performer had such a lowly beginning. He struggled with numerous odd jobs before venturing towards acting. After finding success with the Western television series Rawhide, he rose to international prominence with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy."
