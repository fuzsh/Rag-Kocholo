        "text": "Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nClint Eastwood Through The Years: From Actor to Award-Winning Director\n\nFrom almost quitting the entertainment industry to becoming an Academy Award-winning director and actor,Clint Eastwood has come a long way in his career.\n\nEastwood was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1950 and discharged in 1953. He was stationed at Fort Ord in California and almost lost his life when the Douglas AD Bomber plane ran out of fuel, crashing into the ocean. Escaping with a life raft, Eastwood and the pilot were able to swim two miles back to shore.\n\nUniversal Studios employee Chuck Hill had seen Eastwood while filming at Fort Ord and brought him to the company. Eastwood’s tall stature and good looks were impressive and he ended up signing a contract with Universal in 1954.\n\nAfter working closely with directors such as Sergio Leone and Don Siegel, Eastwood decided to try getting behind the camera himself. Siegel gave him a thumbs up for his script and Eastwood made his directorial debut with the 1971 thriller Play Misty for Me. Throughout the next few decades, Eastwood continued to establish his career as a reputable actor and director.\n\nKeep scrolling to see the award-winning actor and director’s life in photos.\n\nCredit: Earl Leaf/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n1954-1958\n\nEastwood jumped around agencies at the beginning of his career. He first signed with Universal in 1954 and the studio arranged for Eastwood to attend acting classes.\n\nDespite developing his talent, Eastwood’s contract with Universal was terminated the following year. Then he joined Marsh Agency where he landed a large role in The First Traveling Saleslady and later starred in Escapade in Japan. Still struggling to find his footing, Eastwood switched to Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956, then Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He was able to land a handful of smaller roles through both agencies but was still waiting to have his big breakthrough.\n\n“After about the first five years or so, four years, I started really getting to the point where I started wondering,” he said in a revived interview with Paul Nelson. “You go through periods of really liking it and wanting to be involved – but struggling.”\n\nIt was the 1958 western Ambush at Cimarron Pass, however, that made Eastwood almost quit the industry.\n\n“That was almost the picture that made me decide to quit. At the time I was thinking ‘Maybe I should give up the business and go into something else’.” Eastwood told Brian Linehan in a 1974 interview. He continued to credit his then-wife, Margaret Johnson, for pushing him to keep going. “My wife – I’ll have to give her a lot of credit – she kinda talked me into hanging in there and about six months after that I got Rawhide.”\n\nCredit: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images\n\n1958\n\nThe Academy Award-winning director had his breakthrough role as Rowdy Yates in CBS’s western series Rawhide. The popular Western TV series kick-started Eastwood’s interest in directing.\n\n“I asked Eric Fleming, ‘Would you be adverse to my directing?’ He said, ‘Not at all, I’d be for it.’ So I went to the producer and he said great. Evidently, he didn’t say great behind my back; but he said great at the time,” Eastwood shared with Patrick McGilligam in the 1999 interview book Clint Eastwood: Interviews. “He said, ‘I’ll tell you what, why don’t you direct some trailers for us; coming attractions for next season’s shows?’ I said, ‘Terrific. I’ll do it for nothing and then I’ll do an episode.’ And I did the trailers.”\n\nCredit: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images\n\n1967\n\nOpposite of his role in Rawhide, Eastwood became an antihero in the Dollars Trilogy directed by Sergio Leone. Filmed in the plains of Spain, Eastwood discussed production in a 1977 interview with Iain Johnstone. He was hesitant about the film at first but warmed up to it once shooting started.\n\n“I liked it though and I felt that maybe a European approach would give the western a new flavor - because I thought it had been in a very stagnant period at that point,” Eastwood told Johnstone. The series hit the United States in 1967 and brought Eastwood a mass amount of fame as an actor.\n\nCredit: Universal Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images\n\n1968-1979\n\nThe Gran Torino actor met director Don Siegel and the pair formed a close friendship as well as partnership. Over a decade, the two collaborated on a total of five movies: Coogan’s Bluff (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), The Beguiled (1971), Dirty Harry (1971), and Escape from Alcatraz (1979).\n\nIn 2006, a year after winning the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award, Eastwood was interviewed by the DGA quarterly and revealed Siegel’s support in his directorial debut. “When I decided I wanted to direct, I went to him and I said, ‘You know, I’ve got this little project.’ I even asked him to read it for me,” Eastwood said at the time. “He liked the script and said, ‘You should direct it. Let me be the first to sign your DGA application card.’ So I got into the Guild and I was off and running.”\n\nCredit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\n1953-2015\n\nEastwood has been married twice and has eight children. The Hollywood star married his first wife Margaret Johnson in 1953. Early on in their relationship, Eastwood had an affair which resulted in his first daughter, Laurie, born in 1959, whom he did not reconnect with until years later.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1973, Eastwood had a lengthy affair with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis which produced his second daughter, Kimber, in 1964. Years after Kimber’s birth, Eastwood and Johnson would have two children, Kyle and Alison, born in 1968 and 1972, respectively.\n\nAround the mid-70s, Eastwood began an affair with costar Sondra Locke, causing him and Johnson to call it quits in 1979. The two weren’t officially divorced until 1984. Locke and Eastwood continued their love affair, but he would also go on to have two children with Jacelyn Reeves, son Scott born in 1986, and daughter Kathryn born in 1988. Locke and Eastwood made headlines when they split a year after Kathryn’s birth, but by that time he had already met Frances Fisher. The two secretly began dating and share a daughter named Francesca, whom they welcome in 1993. Two years after Francesca’s birth, the pair fully separated in 1995.\n\nRight after Eastwood and Fisher split, he started dating news anchor Dina Ruiz and proposed in September 1995. The two were wed in March 1996 at Steve Wynn’s – a friend of Eastwood’s – estate. The married couple welcomed daughter Morgan in December that same year.\n\nIn early 2013, Eastwood and Erica Tomlinson-Fisher, the ex-wife of one of Dina’s old friends, began dating. Dina filed for divorce and the two split in September of that year.\n\nFollowing Tomlinson-Fisher and Eastwood’s relationship, the film director met Christina Sandera and the two began dating in 2014. The pair made an appearance at the 2015 Oscars and have kept most of their relationship private."
