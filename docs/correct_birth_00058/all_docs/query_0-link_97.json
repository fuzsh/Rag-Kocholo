        "text": "Clint Eastwood was born May 30, 1930, in San Francisco, California. The son of a steel worker, Eastwood first acted in b-movies like Tarantula before landing the role of 'Rowdy Yates' on the western TV series Rawhide.\n\nBecause he was under contract for the television show, Eastwood could not make films in Hollywood so he moved t o Italy to work with director Sergio Leone. Their first collaboration, A Fistful of Dollars, went on to become a worldwide hit and secured his status as a star of the big screen. He went on to act in several of Leone's films in what has become known as the \"Dollars trilogy\" of spaghetti westerns which include A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Subsequently, he returned to America to make movies, further enhancing his superstar status by appearing in the films of the Dirty Harry series and a number of domestically-produced westerns.\n\nIn between blockbusters, Eastwood decided to try directing, shooting his first film Play Misty for Me in 1971. Since then, he has directed 30 other films, earning Academy Awards for 1993's Unforgiven and 2005's Million Dollar Baby. Some of his other notable films include Unforgiven (1992), The Bridges of Madison Count (1996), Mystic River (2004) and Letters From Iwo Jima (2006). Eastwood claimed that his 2008 film Gran Torino would be the last film that he would act in, but he will continue to direct.\n\nEastwood has been married twice and has five daughters and two sons by five different women. He is an avid music fan and is co-owner of the world famous Pebble Beach Golf Club. He owns two restaurants in Carmel, California and is a member of the prestigious Teh√†ma Golf Club, also located in Carmel within Monterey County."
