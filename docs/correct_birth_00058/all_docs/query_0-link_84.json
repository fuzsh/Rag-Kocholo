        "text": "Vitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Blondie, aka “the Man with No Name”, taciturn bounty hunter\n\nNew Mexico Territory, Spring 1862\n\nFilm: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n\n(Italian title: Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo)\n\nRelease Date: December 23, 1966\n\nDirector: Sergio Leone\n\nCostume Designer: Carlo Simi\n\nBackground\n\nToday marks the 90th birthday of screen legend Clint Eastwood, born May 31, 1930, in San Francisco. (Between John Wayne on May 26, James Stewart on May 20, and Gary Cooper on May 7, there must be something about being in born in May that positions an actor for stardom in the Western genre!)\n\nAfter Eastwood’s initial success on the TV series Rawhide, he traveled to Italy to star in a trio of Westerns directed by Sergio Leone, firmly establishing the significance of the “spaghetti Western”. In A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), Eastwood ostensibly played a variation of the same mysterious, laconic gunfighter alternately known as Joe, Manco, or Blondie, respectively, but immortalized in cinema as “the Man with No Name.”\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Harry Callahan, tough San Francisco Police Department inspector\n\nSan Francisco, August 1972\n\nFilm: Magnum Force\n\nRelease Date: December 25, 1973\n\nDirector: Ted Post\n\nCostume Supervisor: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nWhen the first Dirty Harry sequel was being conceptualized in the early 1970s, Clint Eastwood recalled a plot line introduced by Terrence Malick in an unused first draft for Dirty Harry that was fleshed out by John Milius to center around a group of young rogue officers in the San Francisco Police Department who formed a secret vigilante “death squad” to rid the city of its worst criminals. This neatly responded to criticism of Harry Callahan’s methods from the first film, illustrating that while Harry may be an antihero comfortable with skirting red tape to get the job done, he doesn’t extend down into the villainous domain that truly takes the law into their own hands, illustrated by the movie’s repeated motif that “a man’s got to know his limitations.” Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Dr. Jonathan Hemlock, college art professor and former assassin\n\nSwiss Alps, Summer 1974\n\nFilm: The Eiger Sanction\n\nRelease Date: May 21, 1975\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nCostume Supervisor: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nDecember 11 is International Mountain Day, an observance established by the United Nations in 2003 to encourage sustainable development of mountains and recognize the importance of protecting the resources they provide and the populations that depend on them.\n\nOne of the most famous movies about mountain climbing is The Eiger Sanction, directed by Clint Eastwood who also stars as former assassin and expert climber Jonathan Hemlock. Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Joe Kidd, former bounty hunter\n\nTerritory of New Mexico, Spring 1902\n\nFilm: Joe Kidd\n\nRelease Date: July 14, 1972\n\nDirector: John Sturges\n\nBackground\n\nAfter more than a decade as a rising star, particularly in the genre of Westerns, Clint Eastwood took on the title role in Joe Kidd (1972), an idiosyncratic revisionist Western written by Elmore Leonard that would be one of the last films directed by the legendary John Sturges.\n\nWe meet Joe Kidd when he is locked up for poaching on Native American land in the small town of Sinola, New Mexico, on a spring day in 1902, ten years before New Mexico would become the 47th state admitted to the U.S. A former bounty hunter, Joe remains neutral when he is invited to join a landowner’s posse tracking down the Mexican bandito Luis Chama (John Saxon), but he is eventually convinced to join after one of Chama’s attacks hits closer to home. Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Harry Callahan, tough San Francisco Police Department inspector\n\nSan Francisco, August 1972\n\nFilm: Magnum Force\n\nRelease Date: December 25, 1973\n\nDirector: Ted Post\n\nCostume Supervisor: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nEarth tones are a fall favorite for many, so take a few notes for your Friday date night style from Clint Eastwood’s earthy ensemble in Magnum Force, the first of four sequels featuring the incorruptible Inspector Harry Callahan.\n\nContinuing what must be a subconscious focus on tough ’70s cop movies from Wednesday’s Brannigan post, this scene features Harry swilling Schlitz in front of the TV with Carol McCoy (Christine White), the wife of a suicidal traffic officer. When his superiors get word of a potential grocery store holdup, Harry—who had been demoted to stakeout duty—is called into action with his trusty .44.

Harry Callahan, reassigned San Francisco inspector\n\nSan Francisco, Summer 1976\n\nFilm: The Enforcer\n\nRelease Date: December 22, 1976\n\nDirector: James Fargo\n\nCostume Designer: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nAfter all the romance of Valentine’s Day, Clint Eastwood is bringing some toughness back to BAMF Style as one of his most iconic characters, “Dirty Harry” Callahan. The third film in the “Dirty Harry” series, The Enforcer, finds Harry teamed up with tough rookie detective Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) against a gang of militant revolutionaries.\n\nHarry begins the final day of his investigation roughing up a massage parlor, noting that it’s the sort of place where “for $75, you get to make it with a rubber dolly.” A tip leads him to a gunfight in a church which ultimately leads to a gunfight at Alcatraz. Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nClint Eastwood as Joe Kidd, laconic hunter and former bounty hunter\n\nNew Mexico, Spring 1902\n\nFilm: Joe Kidd\n\nRelease Date: July 14, 1972\n\nDirector: John Sturges\n\nBackground\n\nPenned by Elmore Leonard, Joe Kidd is a unique revisionist Western starring Clint Eastwood as the titular ex-bounty hunter who finds himself reluctantly hired to join a posse tracking down a group of Mexican revolutionaries fighting for land reform.\n\nAlthough the Joe Kidd character could be interchanged with any of Eastwood’s usual taciturn and iron-willed Western heroes (not that he’s any less entertaining for it!), the movie benefits from its interesting and oft-ignored setting and context as well as the usual Elmore Leonard touch of an array of unique characters populating the film’s world.\n\nAt the outset, Joe is locked up in the small town of Sinola, New Mexico as he awaits his trial for poaching. When he is asked if he knew it was illegal to hunt on reservation land, Joe responds:\n\nWell the deer didn’t know where he was, and I wasn’t sure either.\n\nWhat’d He Wear?\n\nAudiences had become well-acquainted with the sight of Clint Eastwood’s familiar “Man With No Name” guise in Westerns, so it must have caught many audiences off-guard when Joe Kidd is first introduced in a suit – albeit, a raggedly worn one after his night in the slammer.

Harry Callahan, badass San Francisco Police Department inspector\n\nSan Francisco, Late Summer 1972\n\nFilm: Magnum Force\n\nRelease Date: December 25, 1973\n\nDirector: Ted Post\n\nCostume Supervisor: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nMagnum Force was originally developed by John Milius as Vigilance, a simple film about a group of young officers in the SFPD going rogue to exterminate the worst of the city’s crooks. Clint Eastwood quickly got his hands on the script and decided that the film would be a good vehicle to show that Harry Callahan may be harsh in his methods, but he isn’t a total vigilante who takes the law in his hands. (Although some would say the opposite about Eastwood during the film’s production.)\n\nDue to Milius’ extensive knowledge and enthusiasm for firearms, the film included plenty of gun handling both on and off the job with extended scenes set during both practice and competition.

Harry Callahan, reassigned San Francisco inspector\n\nSan Francisco, Summer 1976\n\nFilm: The Enforcer\n\nRelease Date: December 22, 1976\n\nDirector: James Fargo\n\nCostume Designer: Glenn Wright\n\nBackground\n\nAfter receiving the news that his friend, Inspector Frank DiGiorgio (played by Robert Mitchum’s brother John Mitchum), has been mortally wounded in a gunfight with Patty Hearst-like thugs, Harry immediately heads to the hospital like any good friend would.\n\nIt becomes one of the few days in cinema history that begins with visiting a friend in the hospital and ends with holding a bomber at gunpoint in a church pew… with some rocket launcher testing in between.
