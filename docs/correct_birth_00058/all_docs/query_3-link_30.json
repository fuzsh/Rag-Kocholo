        "text": "This article originally appeared in the July 1993 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nClint Eastwood first moseyed into the Mission Ranch when he was a raw recruit at nearby Fort Ord looking for a place to kick back, have a couple of sodas and a good cheap meal. The cluster of buildings at the outskirts of town next to the Mission San Carlos Borroméo in Carmel, California, had been a dairy farm and the Fort Ord officers' club before becoming a lowkey restaurant and hotel.\n\nFor the twenty-one-year-old Eastwood, who had been a lumberjack before he was drafted and didn't know what he wanted to do when he got discharged, it was love at first squint. “The first time I saw the place I thought it was terrific,” he says. “Visually it was something else, and I thought it was the place I'd like to call home. So I kind of adopted Carmel.”\n\nSet above a stretch of lush wetlands where the Carmel River flows into the Pacific at Point Lobos, the Mission Ranch property, with its dramatic views of the sea, the rocky Monterey coastline and a gleaming curve of beach, is one of the most scenic spots on the scenic northern California coast. Horses, goats and a flock of sheep graze in the marshy pasture under stands of live oak and eucalyptus, ducks and heron fish in the long rushes at the riverside, and in the distance where cypress trees lean away from the wind, the great Pacific combers explode against the coastal rocks in wild bursts of foam. Now, some forty years later, Eastwood is one of the most successful film stars and directors in the world. His chiseled grin and grizzled chin have appeared in dozens of influential roles, from detective Harry Callahan of Dirty Harry to the carny performer of Bronco Billy and the dying singer of Honkytonk Man. He's an Oscar winner for his revisionist western Unforgiven—and he's the proud new owner of the recently reopened and lovingly restored Mission Ranch.\n\nBy the 1960s, when Eastwood had moved to Los Angeles and was starring in the television series Rawhide, he had acquired his first house on the Monterey peninsula, and “eventually I just migrated here permanently,” he says. A zealous golfer, he took to the greens of the Pebble Beach Golf Course on Carmel Bay and brought his handicap down to fifteen. The first movie he directed, Play Misty for Me, was about a Carmel disc jockey, and Eastwood shot it in Carmel and on the rocky Monterey peninsula.\n\n“I just gradually became part of the community,” Eastwood says. “Carmel gave me a different perspective from the movie business.” Then in the 1980s Carmel's city council refused Eastwood permission to renovate a building he owned downtown. Eastwood discovered that many other Carmelites, residents without his resources, had also been stymied by the city council.\n\nJust like in the movies, he rode to the defense of the powerless and the protection of the weak. The enforcer took the city council to court, and won. A year later he ran for mayor. “We couldn't get anyone else to do it,” he says, “so after a few glasses of wine I said I'd do it. Being a very determined person, I decided to win.” He knocked on doors, schmoozed at coffee klatches and rallied meetings. In 1986 he was elected by a landslide.\n\nBut as Eastwood prospered the Mission Ranch floundered. Its foundations had been eaten away by rot and termites, its walls cracked, its screens rusted and tore. Eastwood watched from his new house in Carmel, with views of the Pacific Ocean, as the wetlands encroached on the old officers' club swimming pool and polo field, and the hotel became a seedy refuge for traveling salesmen and illicit couples. When he dropped by he noticed the peeling paint and broken windows, some of which had been painted black during World War II when residents expected the Japanese to land at Carmel Bay and attack over the marshes.\n\nFirst settled by the Spanish in the eighteenth century when they made Monterey the capital of Alta California—territory that stretched from San Diego and Baja California to the northern redwood forests—Carmel became the spiritual center of Alta California in 1771 when Father Junípero Serra built his Mission San Carlos Borroméo del Río Carmelo, now the graceful neighbor of the Mission Ranch. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Carmel became a refuge for the most important community of artists and writers in the West. Robinson Jeffers built his Tor on the rocks above the Pacific, and everyone from Upton Sinclair to Sinclair Lewis lived and wrote in the piny, bohemian Carmel atmosphere.\n\n1 / 11\n\nIn 1879 the lovesick 29-year-old Robert Louis Stevenson arrived in Monterey in pursuit of the fascinating Fanny Osbourne, who was inconveniently married to someone else. Wandering the wooded hills and rocky coast, the impoverished, consumptive young writer also became fascinated by Father Serra's Mission San Carlos Borroméo, which had been abandoned when the Spanish were driven out. “The church is roofless and ruinous,” he wrote, “seabreezes and sea-fogs, and the alternation of the rain and sunshine, daily widening the breeches.”\n\nBeyond the mission, Stevenson, yearning for fame and Fanny, paced the marshy pasture and beach at the mouth of the Carmel River and clambered over the treacherous rocks of Point Lobos. Perhaps it is the ghost of the miserable young Scot that haunts the Mission Ranch farmhouse—built in the early 1850s by another Scottish couple, Elizabeth and John Martin—and the Mission Ranch kitchen. Inspired by love and the spectacular landscape, Stevenson returned to England and eventually made Point Lobos and the view from the Mission Ranch the setting for Treasure Island. He also married Fanny Osbourne.\n\nA century later, in 1986, a developer with plans to level the existing structures on the ranch and build condominiums began negotiating to buy it. Riding to the rescue in the nick of time, Eastwood stepped in, acquiring the twenty-two acres with their decrepit buildings for $5 million. “I had always loved the place and they were just going to flatten it. They said it was obsolete. I thought it should be preserved as what it was,” he says. He joined Junípero Serra and Robert Louis Stevenson in an unlikely dynasty of men who have left their mark on this small Pacific cove.\n\nThe Mission Ranch was a project only someone as stubborn and sentimental as Harry Callahan could love. All the wiring was shot and the pipes were leaking so badly that 40 percent of the gas piped in was lost underground. “When you open up a place like this, it's like the bear who climbs a hill to see the next hill and the next hill,” Eastwood says. “It never ends.” As Eastwood quickly discovered, “there's a big difference between doing preservation and advocating preservation. It's different to put your money where your mouth is.” So far he has put in several million; he'll consider the Mission Ranch a success if it breaks even in his lifetime. The gleaming buildings of Clint Eastwood's Mission Ranch now offer thirty-one luxurious guest rooms, a renovated restaurant and bar and what are still the best views in California. Tennis courts and a state-of-the-art workout room are under construction. “I don't buy anything I don't love,” he says.\n\nEastwood hired Alan Williams of the Carmel Development Company, which specializes in restoration, he had the chimneys rebuilt by the stonemason who had worked on the restoration of the Mission San Carlos Borroméo, and when the Mission Ranch needed furniture he used some old pieces from movie sets. Frances Fisher, his costar in Unforgiven, provided advice on the flower arrangements and quilts. “She cares more about details, I see the big picture,” Eastwood says. For more serious furniture he had North Carolina furniture manufacturer Edgar Broyhill—a friend from the golf course—design the Mission Ranch Collection. “Furniture is what gives a room its character,” Eastwood says. “I wanted this furniture to have a solid feel but be very comfortable.” The collection's emphasis is on physical ease—there are lots of deep cushions—and practicality. “I'm not trying to make a style statement here,” Broyhill says.\n\nAlthough Eastwood is a familiar figure at the ranch and around Carmel, he's intensely reclusive and private. “I'm not the jolly host type,” he says. In person, this iconoclastic American icon is a modest and graciously friendly man who is eager to give credit to others and happy to downplay his own accomplishments. With his don't-notice-me shamble and his baggy, dark clothes, he's almost unrecognizable as the snakehipped aggressor he plays on screen. He pilots his own helicopter, often whirling up to Carmel from Los Angeles for a visit, and he says he loves the anonymity of being able to radio the tower without identifying himself. “I love it up there,” he says. “Up there I'm just a number in the sky.”\n\nClint Eastwood is sixty-three now, with more than thirty movies behind him. The love affair that began between the lanky kid and the small town has become a passionate alliance of natural beauty and worldly power. “Carmel is primo,” says the town's first citizen. “The place just gets in your blood. When you've been away and you come back here, you always feel like you're coming home.”"
