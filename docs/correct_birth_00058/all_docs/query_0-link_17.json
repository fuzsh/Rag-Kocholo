        "text": "Clinton \"Clint\" Eastwood, Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American film actor, director, producer, and composer. Eastwood established his own company, Malpaso, in 1967 with partner Irving Leonard. It has produced the vast majority of films involving Eastwood and has worked in tandem with Warner Bros. since the mid-1970s. Eastwood served as the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California from 1986–1988, where he supported small business interests and environmental protection. Twice married and the father of seven children by five women, Eastwood is also known for his strong passion for jazz and golf.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nEastwood was born on May 31, 1930 at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, California to Ruth (née Runner; 1909–2006) and Clinton Eastwood (1906–1970). During her son's fame, Ruth was known by the surname of her second husband, John Belden Wood (1913–2004), whom she married after the death of Clinton Sr. Eastwood was nicknamed \"Samson\" by the hospital nurses because he weighed 11 pounds 6 ounces (5.2 kg) at birth.\n\nCareer[]\n\nFollowing his breakthrough role as Rowdy Yates in the CBS television series Rawhide (1959–65), Eastwood starred as the laconic Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) in the 1960s, and as San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan in the Dirty Harry films (Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact, and The Dead Pool) of the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, and several others as tough-talking, no-nonsense police officers, have made him an enduring cultural icon of masculinity. Eastwood is also notable for his comedic efforts in Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980), his two highest-grossing films after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThroughout his career, which has spanned seven decades, Eastwood has received five Academy Awards including the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, five Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, two Cannes Film Festival awards, and five People's Choice Awards, among other accolades. He won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture and received nominations for Best Actor for his work in the films Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). These films in particular, as well as others including Hang 'Em High (1968), Play Misty for Me (1971) (his directorial debut), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and Gran Torino (2008), have all received commercial success and/or critical acclaim.\n\nHe has directed most of his star vehicles, but has also directed films he did not act in, such as Mystic River (2003) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations and Changeling (2008), which received Golden Globe Award nominations. Eastwood has received considerable critical praise in France in particular, including for several of his films which were panned in the United States. In 1994 he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal and in 2007 was awarded with the Légion d'honneur medal by the French.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nAs an actor[]\n\nA Fistful of Dollars (1964)\n\nFor a Few Dollars More (1965)\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nHang 'Em High (1968)\n\nWhere Eagles Dare (1968)\n\nPaint Your Wagon (1969)\n\nTwo Mules for Sister Sara (1970)\n\nKelly's Heroes (1970)\n\nThe Beguiled (1971)\n\nPlay Misty for Me (1971)\n\nDirty Harry (1971)\n\nJoe Kidd (1972)\n\nHigh Plains Drifter (1973)\n\nMagnum Force (1973)\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974)\n\nThe Eiger Sanction (1975)\n\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)\n\nThe Enforcer (1976)\n\nThe Gauntlet (1977)\n\nEscape from Alcatraz (1979)\n\nFirefox (1982)\n\nSudden Impact (1983)\n\nTightrope (1984)\n\nPale Rider (1985)\n\nHeartbreak Ridge (1986)\n\nThe Dead Pool (1988)\n\nThe Rookie (1990)\n\nUnforgiven (1992)\n\nIn the Line of Fire (1993)\n\nA Perfect World (1995)\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County (1995)\n\nAbsolute Power (1997)\n\nTrue Crime (1999)\n\nSpace Cowboys (2000)\n\nBlood Work (2002)\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nGran Torino (2008)\n\nTrouble with the Curve (2012)\n\nThe Mule (2019)\n\nCry Macho (2021)\n\nAs a director[]\n\nUnforgiven (1992) - Also as an actor\n\nA Perfect World (1995) - Also as an actor\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County (1995) - Also as an actor\n\nAbsolute Power (1997) - Also as an actor\n\nTrue Crime (1999) - Also as an actor\n\nSpace Cowboys (2000) - Also as an actor\n\nBlood Work (2002) - Also as an actor\n\nMystic River (2003)\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004) - Also as an actor\n\nFlags of Our Fathers (2006)\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima (2006)\n\nChangeling (2008)\n\nGran Torino (2008) - Also as an actor\n\nInvictus (2009)\n\nHereafter (2010)\n\nJ.
