        "text": "Missing image\n\nClint_Eastwood.jpg\n\nClinton Eastwood, Jr. (born May 31, 1930,) is an American actor, Academy Award winning film director, film producer and composer. Eastwood is famous for his \"tough guy\" roles, including Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. As a director, Eastwood has become known for high-quality dramas imbued with a pessimistic tone, such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby.\n\nContents\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in San Francisco, California on May 31, 1930, as the son of a steel worker, Eastwood did a stint in the United States Army before moving to Los Angeles to study at Los Angeles College. He studied primarily business administration, but eventually dropped out.\n\nFilm career\n\nEastwood began work as an actor, appearing in B-films such as Tarantula and Francis in the Navy. In 1959, he got his first break with the long-running Television series, Rawhide. As Rowdy Yates, he made the show his own and became a household name across the country. But Eastwood found bigger roles with Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (Per un pugno di dollari) in 1964, and soon followed it with For a Few Dollars More (Per qualche dollaro in più) (1965). In these and his third film with Leone, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo) (1966) he found one of his trademark roles, the mysterious \"man with no name\". All three films were hits, particularly the third, and Eastwood became an instant international star, redefining the traditional image of the American cowboy.\n\nStardom brought more roles, though still in the \"tough guy\" mold. In Where Eagles Dare (1968) he had second billing to Richard Burton but was paid $800,000. However, he also began to branch out. Paint Your Wagon (1969) was a Western, but a musical. Kelly's Heroes (1970) combined tough guy action with offbeat humor. 1971 proved to be one of his best years in films. He starred in the thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), and The Beguiled (1971). But it was his role that year as the hard-edged police inspector Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry that gave Eastwood one of his most memorable roles. The film has been credited with inventing the \"loose-cannon cop genre\" that remains imitated to this day. Many have said that Eastwood's portrayal of the tough, no-nonsense cop touched a nerve with many who were just plain fed up with crime in the streets.\n\nEastwood continued to take cop, western and thriller roles, including sequels to Dirty Harry: Magnum Force (1973), The Enforcer (1976), Sudden Impact (1983), and The Dead Pool (1988). The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) was an important contribution to the western genre. As the late '70s approached, he found more solid work in comedies such as Every Which Way But Loose (1978).\n\nIt was the fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), that made Eastwood a viable star for the '80s. President Reagan even used his famous \"make my day\" line in one of his speeches. He did make his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch his previous films had achieved. After much less successful films such as Pink Cadillac (1989), and The Rookie (1990), Eastwood started taking on more personal projects such as directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, and starring in and directing White Hunter, Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biography of John Huston.\n\nEastwood rose to stardom yet again in the 1990s. He starred in and directed the gritty, cynical western, Unforgiven in 1992, taking on the role of an aging ex-gunfighter, long past his prime. The film was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Actor for Eastwood, and won four, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. The following year, Eastwood gave a fine performance as a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent in the thriller In the Line of Fire. He expanded his repertoire again with the love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and took on more work as director, much of it well received, including Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), Mystic River (2003), and Million Dollar Baby (2004), for which he won a rare second Best Director award -- at 74 the oldest active director to do so.\n\nEastwood developed directing as a second career, and has, indeed, generally received greater critical acclaim for his directing than for his acting. He has chosen a wide variety of films to direct, some clearly commercial, others highly personal. Unlike many actors who also direct, Eastwood frequently directs films in which he does not appear. Eastwood has become a highly respected American director. Eastwood also produces many of his movies, and is well known in the industry for his efficient, low-cost approach to making films. Over the years, he has developed relationships with many other filmmakers, working over and over with the same crew, production designers, cinematographers, editors and other technical people. Similarly, he has a long-term relationship with Warner Bros. studio, which finances and releases most of his films. In more recent years, Eastwood also has started to write music for some of his films.\n\nEastwood received Kennedy Center Honors in 2000.\n\nPersonal life\n\nEastwood, who has been married twice, has four daughters and two sons by five different women: Kimberly, 40, with actress Roxanne Tunis; and Kyle, 36, and Alison 32, with his ex-wife Maggie Johnson. He has an 11-year-old daughter Francesca with Frances Fisher, his co-star in Unforgiven, and 7-year-old Morgan with his new wife Dina Ruiz. He also has an older son, Lesly (born February 13, 1959), to Rosina Mary Glen (born September 1, 1940). He was adopted after spending six months in a Salvation Army Home for young unmarried mothers. Clint and his wife Maggie (Maggie was pregnant at the time) found and introduced themselves to him in the late summer of 1967 (he was 8). He was living in a small village in Fife, Scotland, called Kinghorn. Although they never made contact with him in any way again, Clint would regularly vacation at the secluded Kingswood Hotel on the road between Kinghorn and Burntisland. He was seen on many occasions, playing golf at Burntisland golf course. His autographed picture still hangs in the Penny Farthing Bar in Kirkaldy, which he donated personally.\n\n\"I like to joke that since my children weren't giving me any grandchildren, I had two of my own. It's a terrific feeling being a dad again at my age. I am very fortunate. I realize how unfair a thing it is that men can have children at a much older age than women.\"\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn addition to his career as an actor, Eastwood was elected mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California on April 8, 1986. Running on a Republican ticket, he received 72% of the vote (voter turnout was also doubled over the previous mayoral election). He served a two-year term before declining to run for re-election. Though Eastwood ran as a republican, he has recently offended many conservatives with his movie Million Dollar Baby but Eastwood has described the movie as simply a \"What If\" story.\n\nNeither a conservative or a liberal, Eastwood charactorizes himself in interviews as a libertarian. He has become one of the most prominent opponents of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the disability rights movement, after his restaurant in Carmel was hit with an ADA enforcement lawsuit. In May 2000, he testified before Congress in support of a bill that would have added procedural protections for small-business owners. A few disability rights activists have alleged that his decision to make Million Dollar Baby may have been motivated by this earlier experience.\n\nIn 2005 Eastwood threatened to kill the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore if ever Moore showed up at his home with a camera. This appears to have been a jesting reference to Moore's controversial interview with legendary movie star and conservative activist Charlton Heston for the movie Bowling for Columbine.\n\nFilmography\n\nEastwood also has directed a number of films, including many that he starred in.\n\nYear Film Role 2004 Million Dollar Baby Frankie Dunn 2002 Blood Work Terry McCaleb 2000 Space Cowboys Dr. Frank Corvin 1999 True Crime Steve Everett 1997 Absolute Power Luther Whitney 1995 The Bridges of Madison County Robert Kincaid 1993 A Perfect World Chief Red Garnett 1993 In the Line of Fire Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan 1992 Unforgiven William 'Bill' Munny 1990 The Rookie Nick Pulovski 1990 White Hunter Black Heart John Wilson 1989 Pink Cadillac Tommy Nowak 1988 The Dead Pool Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan 1986 Heartbreak Ridge Gunnery Sergent Tom 'Gunny' Highway 1985 Pale Rider Preacher 1984 City Heat Lieutenant Speer 1984 Tightrope Wes Block 1983 Sudden Impact Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan 1982 Honkytonk Man Red Stovall 1982 Firefox Mitchell Gant 1980 Any Which Way You Can Philo Beddoe 1980 Bronco Billy Bronco Billy McCoy 1979 Escape from Alcatraz Frank Morris 1978 Every Which Way But Loose Philo Beddoe 1977 The Gauntlet Ben Shockley 1976 The Enforcer Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan 1976 The Outlaw Josey Wales Josey Wales 1975 The Eiger Sanction Dr. Jonathan Hemlock 1974 Thunderbolt and Lightfoot Thunderbolt 1973 Magnum Force Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan 1973 High Plains Drifter The Stranger 1972 Joe Kidd Joe Kidd 1971 Dirty Harry Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan 1971 Play Misty for Me David 'Dave' Garver 1971 The Beguiled Cpl.

(Remembering, of course, that Eastwood himself did not write any of these lines. Eastwood has never taken a writing credit on a film.)\n\nFrom Dirty Harry:\n\nHarry Callahan: \"I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\"\n\nFrom Sudden Impact:\n\nHarry Callahan: \"Go ahead, make my day.\"\n\nFrom Bronco Billy:\n\nBronco Billy: \"Dyin's too good for ya.\"\n\nFrom Million Dollar Baby:\n\nFrankie Dunn: \"Girlie, tough ain't enough.\"\n\nExternal links\n\nTemplate:Wikiquote\n\nTemplate:Imdb name\n\nClintEastwood.net (http://www.clinteastwood.net/welcome.html)\n\nSenses of Cinema: Great Directors Critical Database (http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/eastwood.html)da:Clint Eastwood"
