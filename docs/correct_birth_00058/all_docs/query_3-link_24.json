        "text": "(born 1930). American motion-picture actor, director, and producer Clint Eastwood ranked as a major international box-office attraction from the 1960s. He was best known for his roles as a murderously effective police officer in the Dirty Harry films and as a fearless, solitary gunfighter in such Westerns as The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Pale Rider (1985). Eastwood went on to become a prolific and respected director-producer, winning best director and best movie Academy Awards for the films Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004).\n\nClinton Eastwood, Jr., was born on May 31, 1930, in San Francisco, California. When he was growing up, his family moved from town to town, so he spent little more than a few months in each of the many schools he attended. After graduating from high school in California and briefly attending Los Angeles City College, Eastwood held various jobs and served in the U.S. Army before becoming a bit player in Hollywood.\n\nEastwood made a name for himself playing cowhand Rowdy Yates in the television series Rawhide (1959–66). He found international stardom during this same time by playing the “Man with No Name” (a mysterious, fearless gunfighter) in three Spanish-Italian Westerns (popularly known as “spaghetti westerns”) directed by Sergio Leone: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966). Once those films were released in the United States, Eastwood was offered starring roles in Hollywood pictures.\n\nEastwood worked with director Don Siegel on the movies Coogan’s Bluff (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), The Beguiled (1971), and Escape from Alcatraz (1979). Their best-known collaboration was Dirty Harry (1971), in which Eastwood first portrayed the ruthlessly effective police inspector Harry Callahan. The film proved to be one of Eastwood’s most successful, spawning four sequels and establishing the no-nonsense character of Dirty Harry as a cinema icon.\n\nEastwood began his career as a film director with the thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), in which he also starred. Known for a lean, crisp directorial style, he went on to direct and star in The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Bronco Billy (1980), Pale Rider (1985), and White Hunter, Black Heart (1990), as well as in Sudden Impact (1983), regarded as the best of the Dirty Harry sequels. Eastwood’s revisionist western Unforgiven won the 1992 Academy Award for best picture and the best director award for Eastwood. For nearly two decades after starring in the thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), he devoted himself only to films that he directed. In some of those films, such as A Perfect World (1993), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), Absolute Power (1997), and Space Cowboys (2000), he also acted. Mystic River (2003), a dark tale of murder and revenge, was believed by many critics to be one of Eastwood’s finest films as a director.\n\nIn 2005 Eastwood earned a second Academy Award for best director for the boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, which also received an Oscar for best picture. He next directed the World War II films Flags of Our Fathers (2006) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006). The latter, told from the Japanese perspective, was nominated for several Academy Awards, including best director and best film. Eastwood later directed the dramas Changeling (2008) and Gran Torino (2008), in which he starred as a hardened Korean War veteran. In 2009 he directed Invictus, a drama that follows the efforts of Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) to unite South Africa through the country’s rugby team. Eastwood subsequently directed the dramas Hereafter (2010) and J. Edgar (2011) before taking a break from directing to star as a veteran baseball scout in the drama Trouble with the Curve (2012). He later directed movies based on real-life events, including American Sniper (2014), Sully (2016), and The 15:17 to Paris (2018).\n\nEastwood was the recipient of the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award in 1996. In 2007 he was made a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor; he was elevated to commander two years later. Outside of his film career, Eastwood served as mayor of Carmel, California, from 1986 to 1988."
