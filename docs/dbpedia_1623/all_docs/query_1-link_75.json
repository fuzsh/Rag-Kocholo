        "text": "Blog: The Motherlode\n\nGoldeous Kline And The Borrowful Glaxons In the end, Goldeous Kline and the Borrowful Glaxons is not only a thrilling adventure filled with scientific intrigue, but also a testament to the unifying power of curiosity, wonder, and trust in the face of uncertainty\n\nThis is the title of a short story prompt that I offered the author David Varela way back in 2012.\n\nDavid was doing a mad project where he took a monkish vow of silence, sat in a live-streamed cell and wrote short stories based on publicly-sourced prompts for 100 hours straight.\n\nDavid took my prompt 95 hours into the project so he was understandably suffering from reality hallucinations, but I loved what he did with the title, transmuting it into a sci-fi parody about an interstellar civilisation that ‘went wild with the credit card’ on Finusian Champagne.\n\nAnother story about debt, with some sort of space bank on the tail of the Glaxon High Command:\n\n“They’re repossessing everything. The bases, the ships… even Deckard. Apparently galactic law still regards him as a thing not a person.”\n\n(The 100 Hours project is now offline, but you can catch up with David on his website and read the rest of his Glaxon short story on my website.)\n\nSo when Stephen Reid announced that he’d created a prompt engine for ChatGPT-4 that would use the AI to generate a blog post in his style based on user-suggested titles, I knew exactly what to do.\n\nChatGPT-4 is supposed to be better at unravelling fact from fiction than its language model predecessors , but the blog post the Reid-AI Cyborg spaffed out introduces Goldeous thusly:\n\nGoldeous Kline and the Borrowful Glaxons by Aelius Blythe is a treasure trove of profound insights and mind-bending ideas that challenge our understanding of reality and reveal the intertwined nature of science and spirituality.\n\nIf you say so.\n\nIt’s worth noting too that, where David Varela’s Goldeous Kline was a daring woman space badass, ChatGPT’s is a male scientist.\n\nIn fairness, Aelius Blythe’s novel does sound pretty cool:\n\nThrough the interwoven stories of Goldeous Kline, a human scientist, and the Borrowful Glaxons, Blythe draws upon the profound insights of quantum physics to explore the connections between science and spirituality, illuminating the subtle and intricate dance between matter, energy, and consciousness that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nWell, actually, it sounds like exactly the sort of book that former complexity scientist and founder of The Psychedelic Society Stephen Reid would love to read.\n\nIn lieu of any source material, ChatGPT will fulfil fantasies.\n\nA lot of pixels have been spilt over the threat and promise of AI — and you’ll be glad to hear that I’m not interested in stuffing your brain with any more of that speculation.\n\nBut what David Varela and ChatGPT have reminded me is that every moment is a prompt and that we can choose to write and rewrite from an infinite, imaginative supply of stories everytime we answer that call to adventure.\n\nIn the end, Goldeous Kline and the Borrowful Glaxons is not only a thrilling adventure filled with scientific intrigue, but also a testament to the unifying power of curiosity, wonder, and trust in the face of uncertainty.\n\nCinq Diamants Obligations bring us together as a community; debts divide us\n\nRambling the streets south of Austerlitz on Wednesday, we happened upon Rue de Cinq Diamants — Five Diamond Street.\n\nWhat caught our eye was the graffiti —\n\nBut Cinq Diamants is also home to Les Amies et Amis de la Commune de Paris 1871, an organisation that promotes the ideals of the Paris Commune, the radical working class who governed Paris for two months in 1871.\n\nBesides the separation of church and state, the abolition of child labour and the right of employees to run their own businesses, the Commune also passed a law that postponed commercial debts and abolished the paying of interest on those debts.\n\nI mention this because I was recently asked to write a short piece for the next issue of Red Pepper Magazine about David Graeber’s Debt: The First 5,000 Years.\n\nThe idea that ‘we should always pay our debts’ has become the self-evident moral foundation of our economic and political relations, but — as David Graeber shows inside the first four pages of Debt — that idea is total bollocks.\n\nAlways pay our debts? Really? Tell that to the bailed out banks, extractive, polluting industries and tax-avoidant billionaires and transnationals.\n\nAs David pointed out, debts are obligations that can be precisely quantified. That’s a critical distinction: debt is only one, deeply alienating, expression of how we manage our relations with others.\n\nWhereas debts are precisely impersonal financial instruments, we can see the more general concept of obligation as a chain of generosity: gifts and favours of similar, but crucially not identical value, to be granted, not immediately, but at some appropriate time in the future, according to the needs of the recipient and resources of the obliged.\n\nObligations bring us together as a community; debts divide us.\n\nLet’s Not Doomspread Loneliness Writing constructively isn’t hard: put solutions up top in the lede. Why wait until you’ve beaten us up already?\n\nThis Quanta story by Marta Zaraska follows the classic doomspreading journalistic model so you’ll have to scroll right to the bottom to find the work that is being done to help support people who feel chronic loneliness, but, if you can avoid getting caught in the cheap attention trap, it’s an interesting read.\n\nExample of anxiety-inducing sensationalist doomspreading:\n\n10 hours without social contact is enough to elicit essentially the same neural signals as being deprived of food 🤮\n\nExample of constructive storytelling, from the last two paragraphs in the article:\n\nWhile interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, promoting trust and synchrony, or even ingesting magic mushrooms could help treat chronic loneliness, transient feelings of solitude will most likely always remain part of the human experience. And there is nothing wrong with that, Tomova said.\n\nShe compares loneliness to stress: It’s unpleasant but not necessarily negative. ‘It provides energy to the body, and then we can deal with challenges,’ she said. 🥰\n\nIn the last 432 words of their 2,000 word article, Marta Zaraska covers four possible solutions for chronic loneliness (which I’ve bolded) and offers a comforting arm around the shoulder for the rest of us.\n\nBut how many people will read that far? The first 1,500 words are, by and large, doomspreading, explaining why chronic loneliness is a terrible thing and how difficult an emotion it is for scientists to study, let alone treat.\n\nTake note, journalists, all — writing constructively isn’t hard. It doesn’t even mean removing the darker details, but why not put solutions and that arm around the shoulder up top in the lede? Why wait until you’ve beaten us up already?\n\nI sort of don’t want to know the answer to that question.\n\nIf you notice a journalist who opens with doomspreading, do yourself a favour and skip ahead to read the final paragraphs first.\n\nAntischismogenetic Equifinality Today’s story is little more than the smashing together of two fancy words that I learned recently. (And, actually, one of them I made up.)\n\nToday’s story is little more than the smashing together of two fancy words that I learned recently.\n\n(And, actually, one of them I made up.)\n\nAntischismogenesis\n\nSchismogenesis is the word for a process where apparently close neighbours somehow end up defining themselves in direct opposition to the other.\n\nProtestant and Catholic, Conservative and Labour, Mods and Rockers, Reds and Blues: despite sharing so much, we lurrrrve to amplify our divisions and differences.\n\nIn Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), social psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson show how tenaciously we tend to cling onto our sides of the argument (or indeed angle on reality), no matter what evidence or alternative is put before us.\n\nAs the editors at Wikipedia succinctly summarise:\n\nIt describes a positive feedback loop of action and self-deception by which slight differences between people’s attitudes become polarised.\n\nFuelled by cognitive dissonance and the confirmation bias, that’s (at least one element of) schismogenesis in action.\n\nAntischismogenesis is my made up word for the reverse process: a divided people finding — and building upon — common ground.\n\n(Or at least the ability to notice where difference exists and retain the openness of mind to continue to listen.)\n\nWhile antischismogenesis does happen naturally — chuck a couple of reasonably open-minded, relaxed humans together and it’s surprising what common ground they’ll find. What, you love pizza too?! — it can seem that schismogenesis is the weightier force, particularly insidious as (for most if not all people) it rarely happens with malice aforethought.\n\nWhat we need is a concept that will guide us towards, not malice, but benevolence aforethought…\n\nEquifinality\n\nEquifinality is the fancy word for ‘there’s more than one way to skin a cat’ (or, indeed, that gruesome idiom’s even more graphic progenitor: ‘there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream’).\n\nEquifinality is almost a state of mind.\n\nThere so are many different ways of ending up with similar-looking results that it’d be INSANE to judge anyone because they aren’t doing it exactly like you or because they don’t look like you or talk like you or even think like you.\n\nSometimes you’ve got to let them do it their way.\n\nIn fact, you could say that the spirit of equifinality is exactly what we need to find in order to rebuild our communities through antischismogenesis.\n\nWhat we need is a mouthful: antischismogenetic equifinality.\n\nGo on, give it a try — if nothing else, it’s fun to wrap your tongue around.\n\nHow we actually do antischismogenetic equifinality is another matter entirely.\n\nThe Discerning Traveller’s Comprehensively Empty Guide To Antischismogenetic Equifinality (On A Shoestring)\n\nAs it’s a concept that I just made up, there is no behavioural toolkit for antischismogenetic equifinality, but I bet it’d include all the usual tricks of the communication trade:\n\nLearn about the ordinary human tendency for schismogenesis between in-groups and out-groups. Done ✔️\n\nNotice where schismogenesis has nurtured division in your own life. What kind of people are in your circle of friends, colleagues and nodding acquaintances?\n\nNotice when you are actively manufacturing division from others. Don’t forget that division isn’t all blazing rows and fisty-cuffs. It’s most often as mundane and insidious as silent prejudice.\n\nWhat’s your internal monologue when you pass a member of the out-group in the street? How about when you hear your favourite worst enemy on the radio or read about their latest egregious behaviour in the news? If you’re anything like me, you’ll despatch with relish the three Ds: dismiss, deny and denigrate.\n\nLearn about and notice your own susceptibility to the cognitive biases that make us all think that we’re not only the best, but also sparkling exceptions to any and every rule. Cognitive biases, our mental blind spots, are like a baseball bat to the knees of equifinality.\n\nInterrupt the opening of any division with extra-ordinary behaviours, which usually begins with you reaching out in a spirit of curiosity. Nonjudgemental curiosity is the practical precursor of equifinality.\n\nAsk open questions (instead of leading questions), listen for what others want to communicate (instead of what you want to hear) and check that you have understood others as they want to be understood (instead of how you’d like to label them).\n\nEmploy random acts of kindness to set spinning a virtuous cycle of connection between strangers.\n\nBut I bet you’ve got a million other ideas and I’m totally here for them. Hit the comments.\n\n~\n\nThe author would particularly like to thank Davids Graeber and Wengrow and, as ever, the editors at Wikipedia.\n\nWriting In Public: Memory & Desire However inconvenient the distortions of memory and desire may be for psychoanalysts, they are good things for the writers of bicycling memoirs\n\nWhile discussing the relationship between my favourite Heraclitus quote and cycling around Britain for the second time, a two-time acquaintance suggested I read a short article by psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion.\n\nThe four pages of Notes on memory and desire (1967) are clearly written for the psychoanalyst, but are fertile ground for anyone hoping to write a bicycling memoir.\n\n‘Memory,’ Bion declares, ‘is always misleading as a record of fact.’\n\nHe’s not wrong: despite being consistently underestimated, our memories are naturally, even occasionally tragically, fallible.\n\nMeanwhile, opines Bion: ‘Desires distort judgement by selection and suppression of material to be judged.’\n\nAgain, horribly accurate: the halo effect being just one of a panoply of cognitive biases where our desires corrupt our conclusions.\n\nMemory & Desire = Bad Bad?\n\nBion is pretty damning about the effect of memory and desire on the workings of psychoanalysis:\n\nMemory and Desire exercise and intensify those aspects of the mind that derive from sensuous experience.\n\nHowever inconvenient the distortions of memory and desire may be for psychoanalysts, they are good things for the writers of bicycling memoirs.\n\nCycling around the coast of Britain is indeed a sensuous experience and anything that intensifies that experience can only help the sensationalist storyteller.\n\nStories would be pretty dull if the writer’s fallible memory didn’t trim the facts, nor desire distort, select and suppress.\n\nHowever: where Bion gets interesting is in his discussion of the ride itself, especially for those of us who repeatedly cover the same ground.\n\nStaying Present = Improv?\n\nBion uses the metaphor of the psychoanalytic session, but I’m pretty sure he was talking about cycling around Britain twice when he wrote:\n\nEvery session bike ride attended by the psychoanalyst bicyclist must have no history and no future.\n\nWhat is ‘known’ about the patient Britain is of no further consequence: it is either false or irrelevant. […] The only point of importance in any session bike ride is the unknown. Nothing must be allowed to distract from intuiting that. […]\n\nThe psychoanalyst bicyclist should aim at achieving a state of mind so that at every session ride he feels he has not seen the patient Britain before. If he feels he has, he is treating riding the wrong patient ride.\n\nStaying present is not only the work of the psychoanalyst, but also the bicycling memoirist and, of course, our old friend Heraclitus:\n\nNo man can step into the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.\n\nEvery landscape, every town, every human and beastly interaction is happening for the first time, every time, and the ride is an embedded, embodied improvisation: ‘Yes, and…’\n\nImprov, like a good bike ride, only works when you’re open, creative, responsive and curious — four ways of saying the same thing — to what’s inside you, what’s around you, and to your partners and props on the stage.\n\nSIDE BAR: Keith Johnstone, RIP\n\nKeith Johnstone, who taught so many actors, directors and comedians the games of improvisation, died last week.\n\nThere are people who prefer to say ‘Yes’, and there are people who prefer to say ‘No’. Those who say ‘Yes’ are rewarded by the adventures they have, and those who say ‘No’ are rewarded by the safety they attain.\n\nThat’s a quote from Keith Johnstone’s Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre (neat summary here by James Clear).\n\nImpro For Storytellers, his second book, perceptibly changed my life after picking it up at random from a shelf at Oxford library in 2003. The subtitle is ‘The Art Of Making Things Happen’. It works.\n\nThere is, of course, more to improv than The Cult Of Yes, And… As Keith Johnstone points out in this 2017 interview, ‘a story that only says yes is a very limited story form […] A master improviser can do what they like’.\n\nThe point is to help your partner in the improvisation, not to try to screw them up. A lesson worth holding onto. Thanks, Keith.\n\nStaying Present With Notes\n\nThe only difference between a good improviser and a writer is that the writer takes notes. Which Bion would have hated.\n\nSomewhat grumpily, Bion declares that notes should be ‘confined to matters that can be recorded’, i.e. bugger all.\n\nInstead, Bion commands us to obey his number one rule:\n\nDo not remember past sessions bike rides. The greater the impulse to remember what has been said or done, the more the need to resist it. […]\n\nThe supposed events must not be allowed to occupy the mind. Otherwise the evolution of the session bike ride will not be observed at the only time when it can be observed — while it is taking place.\n\nHere, from time to time, the bicycling memoirist must respectfully disagree.\n\nWriting, on my typewriter, eyes up, following the fluency of my fingers, helps me observe and recall my experience of the world around me in more detail, not less.\n\nLike this, from my ride diary back on 2 August 2020:\n\nSunny lanes. Pandora told me about how Airbnb is ruining Athens so she can’t live in the areas she used to. She also told me about Halloween Alley Cat Races.\n\nWe detoured through a prison and passed another group of cyclists.\n\n‘What were those cyclists pointing at?’ she asked.\n\n‘They’re turning right,’ I said.\n\nNothing serves noticing more than notating. And nothing serves the reader more than writers who notice.\n\nFrom Desire To Curiosity\n\nI’ll leave you with a note on how Bion’s desecration of desire pertains to the bicycling memoirist.\n\nBion’s second rule for psychoanalysts is this:\n\nDesires for results, ‘cure’ or even understanding must not be allowed to proliferate.\n\nMy initial response was YES. Desire for a particular result takes us out of an experience.\n\nI teared up reading the end of Mark Beaumont’s book about his round the world record attempt, but that was the tension release triggered by the climax of a hard-fought result. His desire for the world record overtook any sense of experience: I remember nothing of his ride and I suspect he scarcely does either.\n\nThe reason I rode around Tunisia the year after I first cycled the coast of Britain was precisely because I wanted to take it more slowly and prove to myself that I could indulge experience over ‘getting there’.\n\nIrritatingly, Bion would seem to be correct again: desire interferes with experience.\n\nThen I paused: is this not a cop-out?\n\nFreed from spontaneous impulses of desire, the bicycling memoirist is also excused from courage to retreat into their shell of individual experience.\n\nA sign pointing the way to Twatt Church. A conversation overheard. A rumour passed around of a quarry camp. The salt wash scent of the ocean. The intriguingly lengthy queue for a hot stone bakery.\n\nAre these petty squirts of desire not also the ripe ingredients of adventure?\n\nThere is nuance to Bion’s declaration. Yes, desire for a particular result takes us out of an experience, but it must be distinguished from our healthy desire to experience more: it must be distinguished from our curiosity.\n\nDesire is forcing our way into a house: never going to end in anything better than a cricket bat to the belly. Curiosity is gently pushing on the door and seeing whether it opens, with a smile.\n\n~\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to my first Writing In Public post on Coasting. Thanks in advance if your mouse is right now hovering over the Reply button.\n\nSpecial thanks to two-time acquaintance CW for introducing me to the insane ideas of Wilfred Bion and for leading me through my own memory and desire.\n\nBe The Miracle Fearful sceptics have bewitched us into believing that it’s absurd to believe in humanity, their perverted tyranny twisting our minds such that a show of solidarity from a stranger is ‘a miracle’\n\nThere’s train strikes this week: 40,000 rail workers united to protect their pay and working conditions against extraction by private shareholders.\n\nIn January, rail minister Huw Merriman admitted that, not only would it have been cheaper to settle the dispute months ago, but that the negotiations were being used to suppress the pay of all public sector key workers, including teachers and nurses. Ouch.\n\nBut that’s all by the by.\n\nFor the purposes of this story, the train strike merely explains why I was in my car at Southampton Airport Parkway and why vehicle delivery driver Arthur was standing on the M27 slip road holding his red trade plates.\n\nI checked my mirrors and thought, ‘That’s a crap place to hitch,’ before pulling over and hitting my hazards.\n\nArthur ran up, pulled the door and chucked himself into the passenger seat.\n\nHe’d forgotten about the strike and found himself stranded after delivering a Motorway car to their depot in Eastleigh.\n\n‘I don’t normally hitchhike,’ he said. ‘It was only fifteen minutes, but I had a bad feeling standing there — I’m very grateful.’\n\nArthur’s next job was to pick up a Hyundai Ioniq from an industrial estate outside Poole and take it up to Tamworth — a 180 mile drive in an electric car with 106 miles’ charge.\n\n‘Normally I don’t touch electrics — something always happens and you’re left sitting around for hours. I didn’t clock this one.’\n\nSeeing as I was on my way back to Bournemouth anyway, it was easy to save Arthur any more trouble. And I got to learn a little about the vehicle delivery trade.\n\nFor Arthur, it was all about supplementing his pension and getting him out of the house. A long day for £230.\n\nThis isn’t his usual patch. He normally operates in the band of territory south of Birmingham and north of London — ‘It’s much easier when you know where you are. I haven’t been to Poole since my honeymoon, 1975.’\n\nArthur’s phone rang: ‘Yes, love?’\n\nHis partner, Chris, was checking in and I got to hear Arthur’s take on his morning.\n\n‘No, thanks, love, I’m fine, it’s all good now. This chap’s picked me up and I’m on the move. Good thing too — I was feeling a bit down back there, stood on the side of the motorway. Then along comes this miracle.’\n\nI laughed. Not a bad way to start my day, being called a miracle. But it also made me wonder how we’ve come to be ruled by sceptics.\n\nArthur was standing on the side of a road rushing with cars driving his way. Every single one could have picked him up. It should be no surprise — much less a miracle — that someone stopped for him inside quarter of an hour. And yet he’d been anxious.\n\nSceptics are those who doubt their own humanity and the humanity of others.\n\nSceptics are those who believe that we’re not all in it together, that we’re not all playing for the same Team Human, that, contrary to all evidence, we’re not sociable animals, our nervous systems constantly regulating to each other.\n\nI’m currently reading David Graeber and David Wengrow’s The Dawn Of Everything. It’s a remarkable work that will transfuse into my stories over the coming years. But one idea jumped out today: we humans are only fully self-conscious when we’re talking, laughing, rolling, relating with others.\n\nBut sceptics would rather believe that we’re each autonomous and independent economic units, acting in our own self-interest to the exclusion of others, certainly others beyond our immediate genetic milieu.\n\nThey couldn’t be more blatantly, even biologically, wrong, but somehow their scepticism has cast a spell over society.\n\nFearful sceptics have bewitched us into believing that it’s absurd to believe in humanity, their perverted tyranny twisting our minds such that a show of solidarity from a stranger is ‘a miracle’.\n\nThe good news is that the journey from false sceptic to true believer is no more than a single step.\n\nAll you need do is pronounce the believer’s creed: ‘I believe in my own humanity and the humanity of others’ and you’re ready to perform what those ridiculous sceptics have convinced us are fantastic miracles.\n\nOf course, we can’t be miracles to everyone we cross, not all day every day. But keep your eyes open, hold out a hand, drop a smile and, from time to time, be the miracle.\n\nLeonard Cohen, Janis Joplin & Me 'She wasn’t looking for me, she was looking for Kris Kristofferson; I wasn’t looking for her, I was looking for Brigitte Bardot.'\n\nThis is a story about two songs, both written by men about women they met in New York, inside and outside the Chelsea Hotel.\n\n(Before you switch off, I’ve also included one of the women’s side of the story. It’s hilarious.)\n\nThe Chelsea is famous for its residents and the work they created there: Dylan Thomas, Jack Kerouac, Edith Piaf, Jane Fonda, Allen Ginsburg, Patti Smith, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix — and, of course, Leonard Cohen and Janis Joplin.\n\nLeonard Cohen Meets Janis Joplin\n\nIn the late night spring of 1968, Leonard Cohen and Janis Joplin met in the Chelsea Hotel lift, going up to the fourth floor.\n\nCohen gathered his courage and asked if she was looking for someone:\n\nShe said ‘Yes, I’m looking for Kris Kristofferson.’\n\nI said, ‘Little lady, you’re in luck, I am Kris Kristofferson.’ Even though she knew that I was someone shorter than Kris Kristofferson, she never let on.\n\nBy the time the lift reached the fourth floor, the love affair was on, a tribute to courage — if only for a couple of hours.\n\nThe next day, Joplin tracked down that handsome devil Kris Kristofferson, who sweetly sang to her the song that would become her biggest hit.\n\nIt took a couple of years for Janis Joplin to record her bootshaking version of Kristofferson’s Me And Bobby McGee (Spotify | YouTube), on 1 October 1970.\n\nThree days later, she was dead.\n\nShortly after, Leonard Cohen started writing a new song, which he eventually released in 1974 as Chelsea Hotel #2 (Spotify | Youtube).\n\nHere’s how it opens:\n\nI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,\n\nyou were talking so brave and so sweet,\n\ngiving me head on the unmade bed,\n\nwhile the limousines wait in the street.\n\nNow, to be fair to Leonard Cohen, the story he tells is more complex than these first lines would suggest, but it’s not Cohen’s song that I want to write about.\n\nJeffrey Lewis Meets A Woman In Glasses\n\nIn 2001, New York antifolk songwriter Jeffrey Lewis released his first single, an extended riff on Leonard Cohen’s song, which he called The Chelsea Hotel Oral Sex Song (Spotify | Youtube).\n\nBefore you get too excited, this is not a song about oral sex. As Jeff Lewis explains:\n\nLife doesn’t work out the way it does in old songs\n\nThat’s why we sing new ones to say what really goes on\n\nSo what really went on?\n\nWell, if Jeff Lewis will allow me to summarise his seven minute masterpiece:\n\nLate one night, ‘tired and alone’, Jeff is walking past the Chelsea Hotel\n\nHe overhears a conversation about Leonard Cohen between a woman in glasses and her two, possibly gay, friends\n\nJeff gets ‘uncharacteristically courageous’ and interrupts the strangers\n\nJeff and the woman in glasses chat for ‘a minute or two’ about Leonard Cohen’s song, Chelsea Hotel #2\n\nThe three strangers stop to look in through a pub window\n\nJeff says good night (though he hadn’t quite meant to)\n\nThe woman in glasses mysteriously says, ‘see you later’\n\nThat’s it. That’s the entirety of the narrative action: they never saw each other again; they didn’t even swap names.\n\nThe song is three times as long as the encounter it describes.\n\nWhat About The Oral Sex?\n\nIn that two minute conversation, the woman in glasses told Jeff Lewis that Leonard Cohen’s line about getting a blowjob ‘made her want to do naughty things’ and Jeff heard the ‘faint knocking of opportunity’:\n\nRight about then I should have asked if she knew\n\nWhat the Chelsea charged if we got a room for two\n\nBut he didn’t. He got shy, waved goodbye, went home and wrote this song instead.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m glad he did write this song — for two reasons, actually.\n\nThe first reason is, quite simply, this, the greatest rhyming couplet known to science:\n\nIf I was Leonard Cohen or some other song writing master\n\nI’d know to first get the oral sex and then write the song after\n\nThe second reason I’m glad he wrote this song is because the narrative action of Jeff Lewis’s street encounter ends only five minutes into the song: what happens in the last two minutes transcends the self-deprecating story into a moment of connective awe for us all.\n\n‘For The Love Of Other Folks That They Barely Knew’\n\nIn those last two minutes, Jeff Lewis turns his gaze onto the audience, as if to say, ‘Hold on, nothing happened with this woman outside the Chelsea and yet this song did happen, is happening, and, what’s more, you’re all still listening — what does that mean?’\n\nIn Jeff’s words, it means something wonderful:\n\nThat all around the world there may be folks singing tunes\n\nFor the love of other folks that they barely knew\n\nThis bit of the song usually gets a laugh because it’s so ridiculous. No one writes songs like that.\n\nExcept they do. The woman in glasses would laugh at this bit too — the laughter of giddy recognition.\n\nAnd we can enjoy that same note of giddy recognition for ourselves right now, even without a gawky folksinger writing a love song for us.\n\nRemember You Remember Me Well Too\n\nThink of all the people you’ve ever interacted with. Go on: all of them.\n\nOkay, okay — too much. How about just the ones who made you ‘sing’?\n\nIf you’re like me (and Jeff), they’ll fall into two camps:\n\nThere’ll be people still in your life who already know that you remember them well. Your best friend who taught you self-esteem as a teenager or the mentor who modelled how to change career late in life.\n\nBut there’ll also be people in your past who will never know that you remember them well. The Albanian plumber-mechanic who showed you the true meaning of hospitality, or that lost classmate in college who didn’t realise he was teaching you how to be funny.\n\nFirstly: make a note to go and tell everyone in Camp 1 exactly what they mean to you. You can never do this too many times.\n\nNow turn your attention to the people in Camp 2. This is where the magic happens.\n\nLook at your list and ponder: there must be hundreds of fleeting moments in your life where a complete stranger made you sing and you will never be able to let them know.\n\nTake a moment to acknowledge the ripples in the water, stones skipped by strangers.\n\nNow flip it around in Jeff’s next lines:\n\n[…] the next time you’re feeling kinda lonesome and blue\n\nJust think that someone somewhere might be singing about you\n\nA laugh again: fantastically unlikely. But it isn’t.\n\nIf you remember a hundreds strangers well, remember that a hundred more strangers remember you well too — they just never got the chance to tell you.\n\nWhen you realise how even a brief interaction can connect and change us, that’s pure wonder. Never forget it.\n\nThe Other Side\n\nOkay — reality check!\n\nSongwriters like Leonard Cohen and Jeffrey Lewis are really good at turning their lives into stories: pinning the emotion that helps them process the encounter.\n\nIt’s a beautiful defence mechanism — transmuting their personal vulnerability into universal meaning.\n\nAs Jeff Lewis says, it’s much easier to write a song than it is to risk rejection.\n\nYou might think that vulnerability to rejection doesn’t apply to Leonard Cohen, but I’m not so sure.\n\nWe’ll probably never know what story Jeff Lewis’s woman in glasses would tell of their encounter, but Janis Joplin wasn’t one to stay in the shade.\n\nThis is what she made of that same one night stand with Leonard Cohen:\n\nSometimes you’re with someone and you’re convinced that they have something to tell you. So maybe nothing’s happening, but you keep telling yourself something’s happening — innate communication. […]\n\nSo you keep being there, pulling, giving, rapping. And then, all of a sudden about four o’clock in the morning you realise that, flat ass, this motherfucker’s just lying there. He’s not balling me.\n\n🤣\n\nBe Both\n\nLeonard Cohen and Jeffrey Lewis would seem to offer two different approaches to a fleeting connection between strangers:\n\neither we are courageous enough to stop and feel out the depths of the exchange\n\nor we are sensitive enough to walk away and still find meaning in the moment\n\nBut it’s not a choice: we can be both.\n\nAs Jeff says:\n\nLife doesn’t work out the way it does in old songs\n\nThat’s why we sing new ones to say what really goes on\n\nSo let’s sing a new song: a song where we enjoy both Leonard Cohen’s earthy physicality and Jeffrey Lewis’s abstract transcendence.\n\nLet’s recognise that any connection with a stranger, in the lift, on the street, can go both ways.\n\nWe might flex our courage and take things further, but, when we don’t — and most often we won’t because we’d never get anything else done — let’s remain sensitive that the moment was meaningful.\n\nAnd occasionally, occasionally, a connection that we didn’t explore, years before, can, in the most unlikeliest of plot twists, come back around a second time.\n\nThen we are both.\n\nI’ll leave the last word to Jeff Lewis:\n\nSo who knows if I’ll ever see her again? Maybe we’ll see\n\nThis whole time she could have been singing about me\n\nProbably not — but it could be\n\n~\n\nps: Just as I was finishing the final read-through on this piece, a woman snuck up behind me on the train and said in a loud voice, ‘Ahh, I LOVE that song.’\n\nI turned around with a thump and realised she was talking on the phone, to someone else. But I hope that one day, by some serpentine logic of the universe, she gets to read this story, listen to the music, and say again, ‘Ahh, I LOVE that song.’\n\nThanks to Leonard Cohen, Janis Joplin, Jeffrey Lewis and CW for showing me how it’s done.\n\nWriting In Public: Coasting My attempt to describe what I’d like to achieve with a book tentatively titled Coasting: Cycling Around Britain (Twice).\n\nThis is something that I actually drafted in an email to a developmental editor. It’s my attempt to describe what I’d like to achieve with a book tentatively titled Coasting: Cycling Around Britain (Twice).\n\nAt the moment, I am strolling across an open field and I could yet turn this project in any direction.\n\nPlease switch on your critical creative mind — I am quite seriously interested in your response. Cheers!\n\nCoasting: Cycling Around Britain (Twice)\n\nI first cycled 4,110 miles around the coast of Britain over a couple of months in 2011. I left two days after my nan’s funeral and a week after my girlfriend left me. I’d just turned 29.\n\nIt was a solitary ride, figuring out stuff like confidence and courage, with a handful of nan’s last words bouncing around my mind: ‘Do it while you can.’\n\nI wrote a book about this journey, called Life To The Lees. You can read it, if you like. I printed a few copies, mainly as a tribute to my nan, interleaving memories of her with the narrative of the ride.\n\nHere’s a bit from the end:\n\nI bump up onto the pavement and let Martin come to a silent stop. I climb off and lean the bike against a gas meter. Then I just sort of stare about me, marvelling at the new person who stands here, where I stood fifty-eight days ago.\n\nI look around for nan’s ghost, waving from the rose bushes, but there’s nothing there, not even the roses. I barely recognise the house and gardens at all. You can’t go back. The tide comes in and will erase everything. All we can bring back, when the path returns us to our beginning, is memories. Everything is the same as it was, and everything has changed.\n\nWe all walk uncertain into our shared future, each of us making the other a little more human, each of us collecting a little more of the other, until that moment when there is as much of me in you as there is of you in me. And then we realise that our only regret is regret itself: Do it while you can.\n\nAnd while I can, I swear, I will.\n\nFlicking back through Life To The Lees now, there’s a lot to love about the text, but it’s a personal story: insular, isolated, individual.\n\nMy isolation on the ride didn’t bring me into contact with much of Britain. I felt like I was cycling around Britain, but not among Britain. The book doesn’t really do what I would want a story of cycling around Britain to do: connect.\n\nThe second time I left to cycle around Britain was after lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020.\n\nAs you know, this journey is ongoing. I’ve been riding in stages and have now covered more than 3,100 miles, clockwise around to Liverpool in the west and anticlockwise as far as Inverness in the northeast.\n\nTen years older, I give far fewer fucks as a human being and that means many more entertaining and meaningful hi-jinx with the people I meet — such as that time in Hastings when I got embroiled in a fake kidnapping.\n\nI’m also a much more experienced writer (four BBC Radio series and a bunch of other random credits) and I’ve been sharing cycling stories with the wonderful readers of this humble newsletter, as well as keeping a diary — neither of which existed back in 2011.\n\nThis makes for a much richer palette of stories from which to paint.\n\nBut I don’t want to forget 2011: it’s an integral part of today’s story and I think there’s something stupendously powerful about what we lazily call ‘doing the same thing twice’, melding stories from both 2011 and the 2020s into one book.\n\nThis dual narrative would not only offer a unique saddle-eye view of Britain either side of austerity, Brexit and a pandemic, but might also say something interesting about how a human being can flourish over the course of a decade.\n\nWhile I can identify the experiences of 2011 as ‘mine’, I barely recognise the lead character. Like who is this guy, too embarrassed to stop for takeaway pizza in Southend on that first sixty-mile ride out of London?\n\nMy hamstrings are quivering and my stomach is rumbling on empty. I cycle back along Marine Drive, looking in at the neon fast food joints, predating on Sunday night drinkers, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I feel their blunt stares. I’m a stranger on an overpacked bicycle, underdressed in swimming shorts and sandals, trespassing through their town. […]\n\nI’m shrivelled and half-starved; all my reserves of fuel are flashing red. I haven’t eaten properly since that sausage and eggs at Ben’s. I struggle with the cookies, but can’t get into the damned packet. I curse myself for not stopping in Southend for a proper feed when I had the chance. As it is, I’m too tired to even brush my teeth.\n\nSecond time round, eating at neon fast food joints where people look at me funny is my number one reason for cycling. It starts conversations and connections.\n\nMy second time round Britain is blatantly inspired by the philosopher Heraclitus ‘The Obscure’, who held that everything is forever in flux.\n\nHeraclitus’s number one smash hit aphorism deserves its own block quote:\n\nNo man can step into the same river twice, for it is not the same river and he is not the same man.\n\nBoom.\n\nThat means I could easily write the story with two very different narrators:\n\n2011 David feels fearful, lost and hurt, in dire need of the ride’s healing power, hoping only to survive the journey, at times desperate for it all to be over.\n\n2020s David feels lucky, open, curious, bursting to get back out into the world, thriving on the chaos of misadventure, dragging out every mile, seeking a kind of immortality in a ride that may never end.\n\nPerhaps I could juxtapose stories from each narrator, not only to show how the river has changed, but the man too.\n\nFirst time round, Hastings left zero impression. Zero. Here’s the totality of what I wrote about Hastings back in 2011. Ready?\n\nRetirement seaside towns skip by in a summer’s breeze of tea rooms and stately homes: Eastbourne, Hastings, Rye.\n\nThat’s it. It’s not a bad sentence, but stretching for poetry to make up for emptiness of content. Did I stop in those tea rooms, did I admire those stately homes? No.\n\nMy experiences of Hastings in 2020 were more like pages ripped from a James Joyce stream-of-consciousness.\n\nBesides the kidnapping, it’s where I bought my BBC-famous touring bugle, from a junk shop for £13. I haggled them down from £20. If I’d known then what that bugle would become later, I’d have paid £40.\n\nI suppose I’m wrestling with how to entwine the two rides without getting bogged down.\n\nHelp me: what’s the story here?\n\nIs the story about how Britain and I have changed between 2011 and 2023? In which case, the balance of the two rides should be pretty even.\n\nOr is the story simply the rippping-est yarn that I can spin? In which case, 2011 will play a much smaller role.\n\nTo minimise 2011 would seem like a waste of something that makes my perspective unique. Yet, if I were to include 2011, then there is almost too much material and I risk diluting the whole for the sake of the concept.\n\nThis feels like a weird way to approach a story about a couple of bike rides. Maybe that’s a good thing, I don’t know.\n\nBut I would appreciate fresh minds working on the problem with me.\n\nThank you.\n\nDoomspreading In Saunas A previous iteration of David Charles would have felt threatened by this man’s speech and seen him as an enemy to be fought and defeated\n\nThanks to everyone who shared and messaged about last week’s story, The End Of Doomspreading — it’s already my sixth most-read edition of this newsletter.\n\nMy drive is to help us develop more effective ways of connecting with people who start on the other side of an apparently deep divide and turn difficult conversations into connective conversations — like the one I had in the sauna yesterday.\n\nOne of the regulars had asked me about Thighs of Steel and so I was telling them a bit about what we do in solidarity with people on the move.\n\nFrom the other side of the bench, another man piped up: ‘I don’t think you’ll get many people who disagree with immigration in theory,’ he said, ‘at least, not for people who are here to work hard and contribute to the economy.\n\n‘But why does the government spend seven million pounds a day putting asylum seekers with no qualifications and no job in four and five star hotels — and giving them a phone, phone credit and fifty quid a week pocket money, to boot?’\n\nA previous iteration of David Charles would have felt threatened by this man’s speech.\n\nA previous iteration would have seen this fellow sauna dweller as an enemy to be fought and defeated. A previous iteration might have fired back what this man had missed: the cold realities of living in the UK as an asylum seeker.\n\nAlternatively, a previous iteration might have felt angry, so angry that I might have spent the rest of my sauna time simmering in outrage, completely incapable of forming a coherent response until much later. We’ve all been there.\n\nBut yesterday, I was curious.\n\nI could tell that the man was doomspreading and doomsplaining: not only passing on ‘the world’s all going to shit’ propaganda that he’d swallowed, but also pushing his pessimistic moral opinion that there are deserving and undeserving human beings.\n\nBecause I recognised that he was doomspeaking, I knew that this man needed empathy, not argument.\n\nSo I listened for the underlying fears and emotions. What I heard was confused resentment, fuelled by a deep sense of injustice.\n\nI also hate injustice so it was easy to empathise, not with the content of what he was saying, but with his emotion of confused resentment and his unmet need for justice.\n\nAlthough we only had a few minutes before I fainted from heat exhaustion, we quickly found some common ground.\n\n‘If they’ve got all this money lying around for five star hotels,’ the man said, ‘why don’t they look after the people who are already here, instead of giving it to people who just arrived?\n\n‘Why don’t they use it to end homelessness?’\n\nZing! Why not, indeed?\n\nFrom our opening statements, this man and I were apparently entrenched on opposite precipices of a gas-powered flaming canyon, where even a single step towards each other would get us burned alive.\n\nBut now I can see how easily we could work together on something we both believe in.\n\nEven if we radically disagree on freedom of movement (at one point he suggested that the government should’ve bought up all the decommissioned cruise liners to keep refugees offshore), he urgently wants to end homelessness.\n\nI can get with that, so that’s where we can start.\n\n(I won’t mention quite yet that close to half of rough sleepers in London are not from the UK and that our asylum system and destitution are not as independent as he might imagine.)\n\nFunnily enough, Dan Sumption (of pithy newsletter fame) told me he had an almost identical conversation about migration this week as well.\n\nI hope you’re also having these conversations and I hope that the idea of doomspeech helps you make such connections about more than argument and antagonism.\n\nThe End Of Doomspreading The world is complicated. I have so much empathy for people who find it too much — I do too sometimes. But, as much as we’d love to, we can’t ever fully control; we can only fully collaborate\n\nConspiracy\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I met a young man who lived in a world of confusion, threat and mistrust.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes of meeting, he was telling me that he felt like straight men ‘like us’ were on the bottom rung of society’s ladder.\n\nHe followed this up with a story about the deliberate derailment by the US government of a train carrying nuclear waste, an act of state-sponsored vandalism that would create a Chernobyl-like exclusion zone across Ohio.\n\n‘You can look it up anywhere,’ he said. (So I did.)\n\nHe was in despair at the state of the world, at how big business and governments are conspiring to wreck the planet, and he explained his plan to raise enough money to buy some land in the country where he could build his own community from scratch, a safe haven for those like him who had ‘woken up’ over the past couple of years.\n\nBefore you misunderstand me, this is not an eye-rolling-at-bonkers-conspiracy-theorists moment.\n\nPlease believe me when I say that this person had very good reasons to see the world the way they do.\n\nAnd, while I don’t necessarily share his view of current events, I sympathise deeply with the underlying emotions of confusion, threat, mistrust, fragility and despair and with his urge to escape to a utopian community where everything is perfect.\n\nWe Need New Words For This\n\nWe all know what manspreading and mansplaining are, right?\n\nManspreading: Typically of a man: to take up more than their fair share of space, either physically or metaphorically in conversation, etc..\n\nMansplaining: Typically of a man: to explain (something) needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly, especially (typically when addressing a woman) in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude.\n\nLove em or hate em, neologisms identify stuff in the world and the best of these new words can also facilitate change.\n\nSince being able to name and frame the behaviour, I have become more aware of my own tendency to take up space. Sometimes I shut up or pull my legs in a bit.\n\n(Incidentally, the man- prefix isn’t such a neologism as you might imagine. Manswearing — to be guilty of perjury or oath-breaking — goes back a thousand years. I love that.)\n\nCredit to whoever came up with these man- neologisms and I hope they don’t mind me appropriating the -splaining and -spreading pattern for my own purposes.\n\nBut first: who here has heard of doomscrolling?\n\n(When I ask this question in the real world, people older than me tend to look puzzled; people younger than me roll their eyes: like, obviously.)\n\nDoomscrolling\n\nDoomscrolling is what you call staring at your phone or computer, completely incapable of dragging yourself away from the endless carousel of negative news gunge.\n\nAnd what happens when we do finally tear ourselves away from our phones and re-engage with the world?\n\nA severe case of what computer programmers, statisticians and dieticians call GIGO: ‘Garbage in, garbage out’.\n\nWho better to tell us about the impact of bad news on our psyche than the world’s oldest and largest broadcaster, the BBC:\n\nIt turns out that news coverage is far more than a benign source of facts. From our attitudes to immigrants to the content of our dreams, it can sneak into our subconscious and meddle with our lives in surprising ways.\n\nIt can lead us to miscalculate certain risks, shape our views of foreign countries, and possibly influence the health of entire economies. It can increase our risk of developing post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nNow there’s emerging evidence that the emotional fallout of news coverage can even affect our physical health — increasing our chances of having a heart attack or developing health problems years later.\n\nBut bad news isn’t all bad.\n\nDespair And Paranoia\n\nThere is no stronger spur to action than the sense that something is deeply wrong with our lives: we’d better fix this now or else.\n\nIt’s why humans have a strong bias to pay more attention when things are going badly.\n\nAnd I’m grateful that we have this bias towards negativity: as I’ve written before, nothing gets shit done like anxiety.\n\nBut it is, and should remain, an acute pain reflex.\n\nWhen that reflex is combined with the chronic negativity of a planet’s worth of bad news gunge, the only reasonable responses, once we’re saturated and burnt out, are crippling despair or reductive paranoia.\n\nDespair is pretty much the only appropriate response if your brain takes a stab at fully understanding and empathising with the depth of misery generated by more than a day’s worth of headlines.\n\nIt cripples our belief in our strength to make meaningful change and our drive to leave the world a better place as we depart than when we arrived. In our despair, we retreat, disconnect and close the door to strangers, even friends.\n\nParanoia solves for despair by reducing the overwhelming complexity of human existence to an easily comprehensible, if false, explanation.\n\nWe’re controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring and there’s nothing we can do but escape into a fantasy world with our dwindling allies.\n\nDespair and paranoia are two extremes of rational response to overwhelming complexity and I’m sure you’ll recognise yourself at some point on that miserable line.\n\nDoomspreading And Doomsplaining\n\nThat’s why I believe we need new words to swiftly identify — and interrupt — the disempowering, alienating discourse that happens when doomscrolling, whether our own or others’, bleeds into our ways of being, our actions and our conversations.\n\nThe aim is to strengthen our belief that we can influence events, make meaningful change and grow a better life for all beings.\n\nSo may I introduce to you two new words:\n\nDoomspreading: to dominate a conversation with the perspective that everything is going to shit.\n\nDoomsplaining: to explain how everything is going to shit, especially in response to the alternate perspective that things are kind of going okay.\n\nI told a friend (👋) about the concept on Monday and was thrilled to get this message from her on Wednesday:\n\nI think we need this.\n\nWe need to be able to notice what’s happening when it’s happening and we need to be able to step in and stop the drift towards despair and paranoia at source.\n\nSomehow, we need to find a way of throwing ourselves a lifeline to a better world.\n\nStopping The Doomspread\n\nWith Others\n\nThe way we stop the spread is not to engage or challenge and certainly not to block the superficial content of doom, but instead to hear and empathise with the underlying emotions.\n\nThe chap I met at the start of the story was upset because he felt like he wasn’t being heard, that he was being lied to by government, and that businesses he couldn’t control were destroying the planet. All he wanted was the security of his own home and the warmth of an understanding community.\n\nGoddam, I hear that!\n\nOnce I’d heard that, this man, this ‘tin foil hat’ (his words) conspiracy theorist, was ready to hear how I see the world.\n\nWe parted, each trusting the world a little more.\n\nIronically, by expressing his beliefs to someone who didn’t believe them, this man’s desire for an understanding community became possible without going through the hassle of setting up a countryside hermitage.\n\nWith Ourselves\n\nRemember that this method applies as much if not more to ourselves as to others.\n\nIf you find yourself doomspreading, pause, and see if you can dig down below the ‘facts’ and instead express your underlying concerns and your unspoken needs.\n\nWhat do you really need from this interaction? Reassurance? Understanding? Safety? Fairness? Honesty? Choice? Acceptance? Friendship? Help?\n\nThis expression of need will be so much more relatable than your rant about Prince Harry and so much more likely to lead directly to a solution that you can actually act on.\n\nThe world is complicated. I have so much empathy for people who find it too much — I do too sometimes.\n\nBut, as much as we’d love to, we can’t ever fully control; we can only fully collaborate.\n\nThe wonderful thing is that, through collaboration, we build trust and this trust creates resiliant and loving communities.\n\nResiliant and loving communities solve their own problems and, suddenly, our lonely despair and paranoia is replaced with cooperative strength and courage.\n\nSo let’s all start by calling out doomspreading: it doesn’t help.\n\nAm I The Most Notable David Charles In The Whole Entire Universe? There’s always a profit, even if it’s not in honey. You’re releasing your bees at half past six in the morning: that’s the time you see deer walking along the ridge. That's all part of the harvest.\n\nThis conceited question demands a few boundaries. And, within those boundaries, I think the straightforward answer to this question is yes.\n\nBut that’s not the same as the boundless, infinite answer to this question. Which we’ll get onto once I’ve finished stroking my ego.\n\nFirst, let’s all say a big hello-how-are-you to David Charles:\n\n“David Charles” On The Google Front Page\n\nThe world’s biggest creepy crawler (that’s actually quite a clever search engine joke, if you please) seems a reasonable place to start when judging notability in the Internet age.\n\nI searched in private mode and logged out of my Google account, which hopefully mitigated at least some of the bias towards my own search history. (More on that anon, however.)\n\nOnce you’ve stripped out the Google Maps and Images results, there are only six pure “David Charles” Google Search results on the front page.\n\n1. David Charles Residential Sales and Lettings\n\nYou’d hope that there is or was a David Charles involved at some point, somewhere, but I’m discounting them because there is no David Charles on their Meet The Team page.\n\nAs there isn’t even anyone with the first initial D, nor the second initial C, I fear that they are only trading on our good name. Vampires unworthy of top spot.\n\n2. David Charles Property Consultants\n\nSeemingly totally unrelated to the residential sales and lettings company, but, again: no sign of anyone actually called David Charles.

David Charles Childrenswear\n\nWith a head office on Seven Sisters Road, this ‘Iconic British Brand for Luxury Designer Girl’s Dresses’ now has boutiques in Shanghai, Suzhou and St Petersburg.\n\nAt least they’re older than me: founded in 1970… by husband and wife team David and Susan Graff. My blood boils.\n\n4. David Charles, Me\n\nGive the first three results, I’m now wondering whether I should double check my birth certificate doesn’t expose my true name, Danglebert Thumpernickel.\n\n5. David Charles, Welsh TV actor\n\nThe bastard that snagged davidcharles.biz before I could.\n\nDavid Charles’s IMDB profile informs us that he has appeared in shows such as Grange Hill, The Bill, Doc Martin, The Crown and something called High Hopes, in which, pleasingly, he played Prince Charles.\n\nLegitimate David Charles? Hard to say for sure because actors union Equity demand uniqueness in name.\n\nI’ve given David Charles the benefit of the doubt because he is Welsh and Charles is a stoutly Welsh surname (although as many as 1 in 28 Grenadians are Charleses).\n\n6. David Charles, Professor of Philosophy and Classics at Yale University\n\nNo doubt a notable fan of Aristotle, but, seriously, who’s looking this far down the list?\n\nThere was a brief summer where both David Charles and I were engaged at Oxford University: he as professor and I as messenger boy. No wonder he felt like he had to move abroad to make a name for himself.\n\nAmong The Weeds\n\nThat’s it for the first page on Google, but I can’t help myself diving deeper:\n\nDavid Charles, psychic who does Youtube readings for the Royal Family and ‘red hot lucky lottery numbers’\n\nDavid Charles, legal counsel at McKenna & Associates, Pittsburgh\n\nDavid Charles, Account Executive at Alan Boswell Group, an insurance brokers\n\nDavid Charles, Head of Risk and Compliance at Calibrate Partners, a wealth management hedge fund\n\nDavid Charles, Teaching Assistant Professor at EdD, Organizational Change and Leadership, University of Southern California\n\nDavid Charles, teacher at the University of Havre Normandie with an interest in nineteenth century French literature\n\nAnd deeper:\n\nDavid Charles, an internist at a clinic in Rockville, Maryland\n\nDavid Charles, solicitor at Darby & Darby in Torquay\n\nDavid Charles, Principal Engineer at Kingfisher IT Services in Olney\n\nDavid Charles, cofounder / CEO of The Strive Initiative, Pasadena\n\nDavid Charles, Client & Market Development Manager at Clifford Chance, Frankfurt\n\nDavid Charles, psychologist in Louisville, Kentucky\n\nAnd — pass the oxygen — deeper:\n\nDavid Charles, a farm vet in Derby\n\nDavid Charles, Programme Director at the Disclosure and Barring Service (I regularly update my DBS certificate — has my paperwork ever crossed his desk?)\n\nDavid Charles, Head of Climate Action at University of Strathclyde (congratulations on recently handing in your PhD, sir!)\n\nDavid Charles, Partner at Bickerdike Allen Partners LLP, an architecture and planning company in London\n\nDavid Charles, an accountant in Glasgow\n\nDavid Charles of David Charles Ministries, producer of hits like Standout Christian, Thank You Father and God Sent Riddim, with as many as 30 monthly listeners on Spotify\n\nOkay, too deep now.\n\nOr, wait — not deep enough — the CEO and Founder of David Charles Ministries is none other than David Burkley.\n\nWhat the actual hell? Can everyone just keep their hands off our name, please?\n\nWikipedia\n\nSpitting feathers at the gamesmanship of these masquerading charlatans, I turn my attentions to that bastion of knowledge, Wikipedia, an encyclopaedia with a redoubtable test of notability embedded in its editorial code.\n\nPeople are presumed notable if they have received significant coverage in multiple published secondary sources that are reliable, intellectually independent of each other, and independent of the subject.\n\nSelecting only the David Charleses who are (probably) still alive, what do we find here?\n\nDavid Atiba Charles\n\nRetired professional footballer from Trinidad, who was part of the Trinidad & Tobago World Cup squad in 2006.

Last active: unknown.\n\nSo, in summary: there are six notable and living David Charleses recorded on Wikipedia. Two of them aren’t bone fide David Charleses and another three are, by all accounts, long retired.\n\nThe only one who stands is David Charles, our favourite professor of philosophy, who, famously, languishes not one but two places below me in the Google rankings.\n\nThe Search Concludes\n\nAnd I’m afraid that this is where we must call a halt to our search.\n\nYes, I could plough on through the 48 David Charleses on IMDB. But only two of them are notable enough to have pictures and both are spurious: David Leach (AKA ‘David Charles’) and David Charles Rodrigues.\n\nYes, I could investigate the ten David Charleses listed on Discog, the music database, and I could sign up to Facebook or LinkedIn and continue my trawling there, but I think we have enough data, don’t you?\n\nAnd I’m sure you’ll agree with my conclusion: yes, I am indeed the most notable David Charles in the universe.\n\nBut you knew that already. That’s not what’s interesting.\n\nWhat’s Interesting?\n\nShamefully, I’ve spent hours this week trawling through dozens of internet biographies of other people called David Charles and what I’ve found is that we’re all, in some way, notable.\n\nWho am I to argue the superiority of my name against the achievements and efforts of the Principal Engineer at Kingfisher IT Services? The Principal Engineer, for pity’s sake —\n\nAn enthusiastic and expert Technical Leader with an impressive track record of design and delivery of innovative and robust solutions to demanding business and technical challenges.\n\nNo, I don’t know what any of that means either, but it tells me that notability is in the eye of the beholder, certainly to ourselves, but also to loved ones, students, teammates, psychic clients and both human and veterinary patients.\n\nUtterly Irrelevant / Utterly Essential\n\nThis search has simultaneously made me feel utterly irrelevant and utterly essential.\n\nDavid Charlesing is a team game and we are all making our contribution, each in its own way notable.\n\nThat is our goal, if we needed one, and, if we needed an exemplar, then who better than David Charles of Somerset, former President of The British Beekeepers Association?\n\nIn this interview for BeeCraft Magazine, David Charles talks about how he used to take his bees to graze on the heather on Exmoor.\n\nThe interviewer points out that taking your bees to heather is a risky business because you never know whether it’s going to be a good harvest or not.\n\nQuite apart from the high probability of bad weather on the moor, if the bees get distracted away from the delicious heather pollen, then that’s it for your honey.\n\nDavid Charles’s reply is almost spiritual:\n\nThere’s always a profit, even if it’s not in honey. […] You’re releasing your bees at half past six in the morning: that’s the time you see deer walking along the ridge.\n\nWhen you go to collect them on the way back, there’s a full moon and the deer are walking along that ridge again, silhouetted against the night sky.\n\nThat’s all part of the harvest from taking your bees to the heather.\n\nAll Part Of The Harvest\n\nThis David Charles died in 2020, aged 85 and a half.\n\nPhil McAnespie of the Scottish Beekeepers Association was among the tributes:\n\nI only got to know and speak with David on a small number of occasions, in particular at the National Honey Show, and at all times found him to be a warm and friendly person, who would put himself out to assist you in any way he could.\n\nAll David Charleses, we all play our part.\n\nSome of us look after bees. Some don’t.\n\nSome of us will spend our lives with you. Some of us you’ll only get to know and speak with on a small number of occasions.\n\nBut however a David Charles comes into your life, that’s still notable, both for you and for us.\n\nThat’s all part of the harvest.\n\n~\n\nThe kicker, of course, is that, despite my lofty appearance on Google, I don’t appear anywhere at all on the search engine I personally use, DuckDuckGo.\n\nIt simply doesn’t matter.\n\n(And, yes, I am an admirer of Dave Gorman. I’m not him.)\n\nRemember That Time We Cycled 2,200km Across Britain On A Route That Spelled Out Refugees Welcome? Oh Yeah! A talk at the Cycle Touring Festival\n\nHow I … Stretch Because, let's be honest, it's not yoga\n\n1. Definitions\n\nI opened last week’s email with the grim origin story of what I call my ‘yoga’ habit.\n\nI’ve never been under any illusion that what I’m doing is proper yoga, but a table tennis talk with a friend (and reader 👋) has put my misuse of the term to bed.\n\nThis is the dictionary definition of yoga that I have to hand:\n\nDiscipline aimed at training the consciousness for a state of perfect spiritual insight and tranquility that is achieved through the three paths of actions and knowledge and devotion.\n\nEven by that cursory definition, eight minutes of stretches before bed while listening to an audiobook is not yoga — no, not even if that audiobook is Marcel Proust.\n\nCalling what I do ‘yoga’ is like an American coming over to a village green in Oxfordshire and calling what they do with the wickets, whites and willow ‘baseball’.\n\nMy friend recommended I watch this short video by Blair Imani about yoga and cultural appropriation:\n\nAnd, to be honest, I’m not bothered about learning the deep roots of yoga — I’m sure it’s a worthwhile world of study, but it’s not why I’m here.\n\nI’m here to improve my flexibility to the point where I can poo comfortably in the wild. In other words (literally): I’m here to stretch.\n\nYes, I got a lot of my stretch moves from what were called yoga books, classes or videos, but, if I’m honest, my main justification for using the term is because it’s a short word that fits into a narrow spreadsheet column.\n\nSo I’ll add five characters and call it by its name: stretching.\n\n1a. The English Language And Cultural Appropriation\n\nThis is not going to turn into a story about cultural appropriation, but it’s worth noting that the English language holds a special place in global culture.\n\nThis comes with an astonishing array of benefits for native speakers, but also a few things that we need to look out for.\n\nTo stick with the cricket example, imagine if Indian cricketers adopted new rules that meant you got eight points for a six (but it was still called a six for reasons that everyone else has forgotten), you had to hit the ball with a hammer and there was no afternoon tea break. 😱\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board would be appalled — cricket is our sport, first played on our lawns over five hundred years ago, with the first laws of the game written down by our Grace the Duke of Richmond and the Second Viscount Midleton for two matches played in Surrey and Sussex in July 1727.\n\nI mean — how much more English can you get?\n\nBut there are more than 100 million cricketers in India, compared to only 229,100 in England. People from the Indian subcontinent, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, make up 90 percent of the world’s billion cricket fans.\n\nIt wouldn’t matter how many cute videos the ECB posted about cultural appropriation: whatever India calls cricket, well, that’s basically what everyone else is going to have to call cricket.\n\nAnd what India is to world cricket, English is to world language.\n\n2. You Don’t Need Anything But Your Body To Stretch\n\nA few people picked up on my stretching anecdote and asked me for suggestions of videos they could follow along with at home.\n\nBut I couldn’t be particularly helpful because the follow along approach never worked for me, not books, not apps, not videos and not even in-person classes.\n\nStretching this way always ended up feeling like a chore, being asked to do things that my body couldn’t do, with no support into poses that could hurt me.\n\nIt was far too easy to feel like a failure.\n\nStretching only clicked into place for me when:\n\nI realised that one minute of stretching was better than none.\n\nI made it a permanent home in my bedtime routine, usually while listening to something — dribbling through Proust in this way was a transporting delight.\n\nIn the first seven months, I missed only three days.\n\nI’ve never had a habit that solid before and the success came from having rock bottom expectations (one minute, that’s all) combined with something I already enjoyed (modernist French literature!)\n\nYou simply don’t get that level of kindness, generosity and forgiveness from a follow-along video.\n\nIf you don’t know any stretching moves, then my suggestion is:\n\nFollow how your body wants to move.\n\nFlick through a book in the library for ten minutes. You’ll get the idea.\n\nHaving said all that, a friend (and reader 👋) recently recommended Do Yoga With Me. I haven’t used it, but I’m sure it’s great.\n\nBefore the 1 minute thing landed, I used an app called Down Dog, which puts together a customisable playlist of videos for you. It didn’t stick as a habit, but it did teach me some cool moves.\n\nMovemberising Feb’ry Let us Movemberise this very month and reclaim these four weeks for the triumphal trinity of kettle-boiling, flask-filling and tongue-scorching - arise, unite, and light a fire for Fe-brew-ary!\n\nA warm welcome with cold hands clasped about a flask.\n\nMy blood responds to caffeine with what could be called an excess of vim, so I feel a pang of envious exclusion when I recall the arcadian utopianism of the Coffee Outside movement:\n\nAeropress. Bialetti. Briki. A kelly kettle or a coffee bag. Java drip, filter, press pot or percolator. A Moka pot and wanderlust for al-Makha. Perhaps you’ll gather twigs and light a fire for cowboy coffee or forage, roast and grind a beech nut substitute coffee. Or maybe you’ll simply carry your cup from kitchen to sunlit garden and sit for a while, caging the minute within its nets of gold.\n\nCoffee Outside is an alchemical substitution, the transference of addiction to connection, but, as an enforced tea guzzler, my tastes are milder.\n\nThen — eureka! — why can we not Movemberise this very month and reclaim these four weeks for the triumphal trinity of kettle-boiling, flask-filling, tongue-scorching?\n\nArise, unite, and light a fire for Fe-brew-ary!\n\nThunderstruck by genius, I was.\n\nTurns out, of course, that the punmaster general of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust got there long before me. Naturally, too, the Brewers Association of Maryland.\n\nBut that won’t stop us, no. Doorstep, garden, beach and wood await your gentle brew.\n\nMake Space For Others To Shine Last summer, our 93 cyclists not only rode 5,428km from Glasgow to Athens, but also raised a record-breaking (for us) £114,632 in solidarity with grassroots refugee projects through charity MASS Action.\n\nSummer feels like a loooong time ago, eh?\n\nIt’s dark outside and the windows are misted up with rain. Our tans have faded and even our steely thighs have turned to jelly.\n\nAs all but the freshest or most cursory reader will know, I’m one of the infamous community of cyclists that make up Thighs of Steel and every year I help organise what is almost certainly Europe’s longest charity bike ride.\n\nLast summer, our 93 cyclists not only rode 5,428km from Glasgow to Athens, but also raised a record-breaking (for us) £114,632 in solidarity with grassroots refugee projects through charity MASS Action.\n\nI know that many TDCN readers contributed to the pot, so thank you: £114,632, including £12k in Gift Aid, is such a significant amount of money.\n\nIt means that MASS Action have been able to give a big YES to no fewer than sixteen solidarity projects, covering pretty much every aspect of the movement for migrant social justice:\n\nCommunity centres offer everything from nourishing meals and legal support to bus tickets and hot showers in Thessaloniki (Wave Thessaloniki), Samos (Just Action) and Athens (Khora)\n\nSeveral projects provide accommodation or work to improve living conditions in Sheffield (ASSIST Sheffield), Glasgow (Scottish Asylum Seekers Resident Association) and Athens (Chamomile and Mazi x FORGE For Humanity)\n\nThe Babylon Project offers drama, storytelling, film-making and dance in the UK, while Musikarama connects people through music in Athens\n\nGatwick Detainees Welfare Group supports people during and after immigration detention\n\nHakoura Organic is an ecological cooperative farm established by refugees in the countryside northwest of Athens\n\nNo Evictions Network, No Borders Network and Calais Migrant Solidarity take direct action to support the rights, safety and dignity of people on the move in the UK and France\n\nIn Scotland, LGBT UNITY is a peer support group made up of LGBTQIA+ refugees and asylum seekers in Glasgow and Bike For Refugees runs cycling community hubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh\n\nPhew! Hard to believe what a couple of months’ cycling can achieve.\n\nIt’s so significant that we couldn’t even display every project on one pie chart, so please hurry along to The Reason and read more about what all that money is doing out in the world.\n\nAnd — YES — this isn’t even the whole pie. There’s still £7,445.23 for MASS Action to distribute after this summer’s ride, wherever the need is greatest.\n\nSorry, did somebody say ‘this summer’s ride’?\n\nHell yeah.\n\nOnce again, we’ll be facilitating the highlight of your summer, starting in Glasgow on 14 July and finishing a continent later in Athens on 17 September.\n\nWe open for signups on Friday 17 February at 6pm — but ONLY if you’re on our special secret early access email list.\n\nThe most popular weeks sell out minutes after going live, so get on it!\n\nHumanity is a team game. We don’t have to do it all — we can’t — but we can choose to play our part.\n\nI’m lucky that my part, right now, is to help put on a bike ride that makes space for others to shine — not only the ninety-odd cyclists who surprise themselves with their own strength, but also the people and projects making change happen on the ground.\n\nEverything we do in life either brings us one step closer together or pushes us further apart.\n\nGo Team Human.\n\nHow I Learned To Enjoy Wild Squats I’ve been amazed at what a difference this investment of 1 percent of my waking time has made to my flexibility.\n\nA warm welcome from a squatted perch overlooking the ocean.\n\nFollowing on from last week’s appeal for healthy habitual alternatives to any form of knee-based self-care, I have started using a squatting desk.\n\nInspired by a 2017 article by physical therapist Carrie Williamson, this is an almost certainly marketable term for ‘swapping my chair for an upturned kettlebell’.\n\nSince December 2019, I have recorded 772 at-home yoga sessions, at an average of 16 minutes per day (currently more like 8 minutes).\n\nI’ve been amazed at what a difference this investment of 1 percent of my waking time has made to my flexibility.\n\nThe fact that I can get into the Asian squat position is a minor miracle considering that, three years ago, I couldn’t sit cross-legged on the floor.\n\nBut there is a gross story about why I started stretching on the daily — you want to hear it?\n\nThought so.\n\nIn summer 2019, I cycled with Thighs of Steel from Paris to Bordeaux and then from Ljubljana to Athens.\n\nEvery night for four weeks, we’d wild camp — along with everything that entails.\n\nSleeping under a scrap of canvas, washing in rivers or lakes, eating high-carb meals under the stars as the sun set and dawn rose.\n\nAnd, of course, pooing into a freshly dug hole in the ground.\n\nThis isn’t where the story gets gross.\n\nAt first, the pooing was fine.\n\nMy flexibility wasn’t up to much, so I wasn’t able to position myself over my poo hole very comfortably, but that didn’t seem to matter so long as I dug the pit near a tree against which I could balance myself.\n\nBut then all that high-carb food caught up with me and I got a touch of constipation.\n\nConstipation is uncomfortable enough, but, with a relaxing toilet seat unavailable and physically unable to squat, I found myself straining harder than I usually might.\n\nAnd this is where the story gets gross.\n\nOne morning, after porridge at a beautiful riverside camp spot in Croatia, I strained so hard that I slightly tore my anus.\n\nOuch.\n\nThe discomfort stayed with me for the rest of the ride — and I can tell you that one thing you really don’t want while cycling for ten hours a day is even a slightly torn anus.\n\nWhen I got home to the UK, I vowed that I would do something about my inability to defecate comfortably without a throne.\n\nSo began my daily yoga sessions — and now look at me. Not only can I take wildly adventurous poos, but I can even write gross stories to you while crouching in a kettlebell-supported squat.\n\nStart from where you are, and start today.\n\nAdventure When You Can’t Adventure? The Nicaragua expedition included two in wheelchairs, one deaf, one blind, one double foot amputee, two arm amputees, one with spina bifida and three single leg amputees. We start from where we are\n\nIt’s been a slow start for Days of Adventure 2023: I’ve been recovering from the traumatic combination of road and gravity on my knee cartilage.\n\nMy usual vectors for adventure are out: no hiking, no cycling, no running, no skating, no surfing, no climbing.\n\nOr at least, I thought they were out until I read Belinda Kirk’s book Adventure Revolution.\n\nBelinda was expedition manager on the BBC 2 series Beyond Boundaries, in which eleven men and women trekked 220 miles across the Nicaraguan jungle and desert, dodging bandits, wading through crocodile infested rivers and summitting a live volcano.\n\nIn short: one heck of an adventure.\n\nWhat’s this got to do with me and my knee cartilage?\n\nThe eleven members of the Nicaragua expedition included two in wheelchairs, one deaf, one blind, one double foot amputee, two arm amputees, one with spina bifida and three single leg amputees.\n\nRight, okay.\n\nI read this as a gentle reminder that we all, all the time, have to ‘start from where we are’.\n\nIt’s not much use me dreaming of all the things I used to do or mourning for all the adventures I’ve had to cancel over the past month.\n\nBetter to start from where I am today and accept that hiking across Dartmoor or cycling through the Lake District just isn’t going to work for me right now.\n\nThat doesn’t mean everything else is off the table as well. Far from it.\n\nBut I must start from where I am, not from where I used to be or from where I think I should be or from where I would one day love to be.\n\nThe first challenge for me today is not to swim with crocodiles, but to interrupt an alienating cycle of inactivity.\n\nHere’s my current pattern of thinking:\n\nRest my knee ➡️ Limit walking and exercise ➡️ Stop going outdoors much ➡️ More work, more screentime ➡️ Low mood, poor sleep ➡️ Stop doing much of anything and head back indoors ↩️\n\nIt’s a slippery slide, especially when I’m clinging onto the hope that this won’t be forever, that the knee pain won’t last and things will return to normal soon.\n\nNo.\n\nI mean, they probably will — I spoke to a very reassuring physio on Wednesday — but still, no.\n\nI don’t believe that the best first response to any problem is to suck it up and wait it out. That’s not me.\n\nNot only does such a solution fail to reflect the reality of where I am, it also spits on the unbelievable good fortune of every minute of my existence.\n\nInstead, I’ll start from where I am and honour the time I have now — not mortgage it against some contingent future.\n\nSo this week I’ve instituted a new rule: no screens until I’ve done at least three beautiful things for the good of my today self.\n\nThis list of ideas is still growing and welcomes new suggestions. A ✔️ indicates what I’ve done since Wednesday:\n\nRead a book ✔️✔️✔️\n\nMeditate\n\nSee or phone a friend\n\nGo outside and watch the goats eat breakfast ✔️✔️✔️\n\nPlay guitar\n\nDo press ups ✔️✔️\n\nDo yoga ✔️\n\nTake a cold shower ✔️✔️✔️\n\nWrite morning pages\n\nPrepare dinner or bake bread\n\nThis is nothing remotely like trekking up a live volcano in Nicaragua without any feet — heck, it’s not even anything like hiking across Dartmoor on a sunny winter’s day.\n\nBut it is starting from where I am.\n\n260,000 Year Winning Record For Team Human Cooperation on a local level — human to human, here and now — makes the relentless negativity of news media (and the power it represents) not only harmlessly avoidable, but ultimately irrelevant\n\nMy friends know me well.\n\nThis week, three people, independently, sent me the news that a high court judge had decided that wild camping was never permitted under the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985.\n\nAs of last Friday, nights like this are no longer legal without permission from the landowner:\n\nMy friends indeed know me well: they know that I don’t read the news and that this news would be important to me.\n\nDamn right.\n\nThe judgement balances, precariously, on one man’s interpretation of the phrase ‘open air recreation’.\n\nChancellor of the High Court Sir Julian Martin Flaux supported the plaintiff that wild camping was not ‘open air recreation’ — despite the breathless adventures of generations of school groups, Scout troops, Duke of Edinburgh and Ten Tors expeditions, and the countless escapades of a multitude of ‘commoners’, as we’re known.\n\nTo be fair to the judge, I’ve spent more than a few nights out on Dartmoor and not all of them have fallen neatly into most people’s definition of ‘recreation’.\n\nBut, for me, nothing beats shivering the night away through nine hours of wind and fog until murky dawn ekes across the mire and it’s almost safe to pull on drenched boots and quag out into the sopping halflight.\n\nIf that’s not recreation, then I don’t know what it is. We’re not all into pheasant shoots and deer stalking.\n\nPerhaps the objection rests more on the ‘open air’ part of the phrasing.\n\nBut, when you can see your own breath crystallise, it doesn’t matter that a skin of canvas blocks out the worst of the weather, that, to me, is ‘open air’.\n\nInstant Response\n\nMy friends know me so well that I had, in fact, already heard the news from the Right To Roam campaign newsletter:\n\nWild camping is pitching a tent when your body is tired and allowing the landscape to hold you where you belong, it’s learning about yourself and nature and it’s being inspired by looking up at the cosmos like we have done for millennia.\n\nWe will not back down. We will not let [..] entitled, misanthropic behaviour destroy the only remaining scrap of land where we are permitted to sleep freely under the sky.\n\nThis news was important, not only to me, but to society at large and it has provoked an instant response.\n\nThe first thing to say is that the Dartmoor National Park Authority have already struck a deal with The Dartmoor Commons Owners’ Association.\n\nThis agreement swiftly restored the right to wild camp on some parts of the Dartmoor Commons and, if your interest in this story is only tent peg deep, then you can stop here.\n\nThere is still much to explore on the current map of permissive wild camping, including Hangingstone Hill, Fox Tor and the wonderful (and relatively accessible) Great Mis Tor.\n\nBut if, like me, you’re unnerved by the summary dissolution of long-held rights by a single judgement — transatlantic echoes of the US Supreme Court decision on abortion last year — then please read on.\n\n1 Pleasure Permit, Please\n\nWhile, in a practical sense, wild camping on Dartmoor was only illegal for a few days, the legal judgement has dealt a huge blow to the spirit of our land.\n\nWild camping is allowed now only by the grace of the landed gentry.\n\nThat means, not only that the area for permissive wild camping is restricted, but that campers must now follow a code of conduct as a condition of their presence on the land.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: much of the code of conduct is eminently sensible and is currently identical to pre-existing national park guidance.\n\nBut who knows what might be added to this code in future?\n\nThe nature of permission, of course, is that it is conditional and may be withdrawn at any moment — indeed, this hasty agreement only lasts twelve months.\n\nAdding injury to insult, the Dartmoor National Park Authority must now pay landowners for the privilege of allowing access. Money that they do not have.\n\nAnd You Want Us To Be Grateful?\n\nInterestingly, Friday’s legal challenge was brought by a single landowner, a man scornfully described in the Guardian as a ‘veteran City fund manager’, for the broader narrative of this story — and the reason why it’s worthy of your attention — is the greed of the super rich against the freedom of the commoner.\n\nAs Guy Shrubsole from the Right To Roam campaign told the BBC:\n\nThe public have just had their right to wild camp summarily snatched from them by a wealthy landowner — now we’re expected to be grateful to landowners who grant us permission to wild camp, and pay for the privilege. It’s a ransom note.\n\nDartmoor National Park Authority has two weeks to to submit intention to appeal the judgement, but the Right To Roam campaign are already raising funds to fight in court.\n\nBut the law protects wealth and it is very difficult to challenge the super rich in court, on their home turf.\n\nSo Right to Roam are also organising something more embodied, on the veteran City fund manager’s actual turf: a mass gathering tomorrow afternoon to ‘summon the spirit of Old Crockern, Dartmoor’s ancient defender against greed’.\n\nFrom the panicked tone of the event page, they are expecting a lot of support.\n\nGo.\n\nWhich Side Are You On?\n\nIf, like me, you can’t get down to Dartmoor tomorrow, I urge you to go again (and again), alone, with friends, with lovers, with enemies, and camp on inalienable soil.\n\nThis isn’t about judiciary interpretations, this is about that ancient socialist incantation: Which side are you on?\n\nAre you on the side of the alienating privilege that would threaten with force your quiet enjoyment of land, river, forest, stars?\n\nOr are you on the side of what I’ve learned to call Team Human?\n\nAfter reading last week’s sauna stories, Dan Sumption sent me this line:\n\nDo you listen to Douglas Rushkoff’s podcast Team Human? He recently wrote a book based on the fact that loads of the world’s richest people have hired him as a consultant to tell them how to stay safe in a societal breakdown. His answer is the same as yours: humans.\n\nLittle did I know that following this trail would be like stepping away from a jigsaw and suddenly seeing how the pieces fit together.\n\nOur 260,000 Year Winning Record\n\nMedia theorist Douglas Rushkoff’s basic premise is that there are two competing approaches to solving the catastrophes of late-stage capitalism — two teams, if you like.\n\nThere is the team led by escapist billion- and trillionaires, who propose technological solutions for every planetary and societal ailment and who believe that their wealth can isolate them from the misery that their ways of life and business has helped cause.\n\nYou know the ones: those who think that the way out of the climate crisis on Planet Earth is to set up a plutocratic colony on Mars.\n\nAnd there is Team Human, who believe (perhaps like JFK) that ‘No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.’\n\nWhatever the disease, the cure begins with humans getting together, communicating and cooperating.\n\n(Here’s a tangental and tantalising example of what JFK meant when he said that ‘our problems are manmade’: did you know that ‘war’ was invented and only 13,000 years ago? — that’s 20,000 years after the invention of the flute, for goodness sake.)\n\nTeam Human might not be as sexy as an iPhone or the Metaverse, but at least we’ve got a winning record going back at least 260,000 years.\n\nAnd we get to decide which team we’ll play for in every decision that we take.\n\nWe’re On Team Human\n\nEverything we do in life either brings us closer together, or pushes us further apart, back into our illusory bubbles.\n\nThe veteran City fund manager, I’m sure, only brought his legal challenge in an attempt to solve a problem that he sees out in the world.\n\nI genuinely believe that, according to his vision, the veteran City fund manager acted in good faith.\n\nBut he chose the escapist route, so beloved of the extraordinarily wealthy, and has used his riches to push others away.\n\nWhatever his problem was, his victory is Pyrrhic: he has only made things worse for himself.\n\nIn contrast, the Team Human playbook declares that the only way to solve our problems for everyone, including veteran City fund mangers, is not with alienation, but with closer community, mutual aid, and human interdependency.\n\nMaking Power Irrelevant\n\nMy friends know me well: I really do avoid all news media.\n\nThe idea that No News Is Good News is something that I’ve written about a lot, but I’d never placed my media diet in its wider context until I found this article by Douglas Rushkoff.\n\nIt’s worth reading in full, but here’s the part that leapt out at me:\n\n[The] more resilient and self-sufficient we can become on a local level, the less pressure we put on […] larger systems and decisions.\n\nThe more sustainable our local economies, the less brittle will be their response to a sudden influx of immigrants or Covid-related business closures.\n\nThe more quickly and efficiently we can assist each other during extreme weather events, the less dependent we’ll be on […] centralised authorities for cash.\n\nSuch cooperation may actually require that we reduce our exposure to the most inflammatory messaging coming from our for-profit news opinion shows and Internet platforms, which work hard to undermine the collaborative spirit we need to face the challenges ahead.\n\nUntil I read these words (and heard them at the beginning of this episode of the Team Human podcast), I’d never really understood why it was so important to me to restrict my exposure to news media.\n\nI always knew there was something going on, that undirected consumption of news media had a deleterious effect on my soul, but I’d never framed that as part of the wider struggle for our future as a species.\n\nDouglas Rushkoff showed me how the pieces fit together.\n\nConnection and cooperation on a local level — human to human, here and now — makes the relentless negativity of the news media, and the power it represents, not only harmlessly avoidable, but ultimately irrelevant.\n\nTeam Human Very Rarely Loses\n\nIt may feel like we have a long way to go to establish social justice through connection and cooperation — and we do.\n\nBut it begins with a small decision that we take today to play on Team Human.\n\nThe good news is that Team Human has a roster of billions and all we have to do is take our place on the field.\n\nA united response to one man’s interpretation of the law renders that interpretation irrelevant: a mass camp-out will not, cannot be budged by the threat of violence.\n\nRepeated camp-outs, combined with other citizen responses, will, inevitably, repeal that interpretation and create new laws that protect access to nature.\n\nAs Erica Chenoweth, Professor in Human Rights and International Affairs at Harvard, has found, rebellions involving 3.5 percent of the population very rarely fail.\n\nIn the UK, that’s 2.4m people. Just so you know.\n\nThe Choice\n\nThe high court’s decision over wild camping on Dartmoor is a setback, but I can now see that it is an invitation to make The Choice.\n\nWill I choose Team Privilege and plan in vain my escape from humanity and the common life, or will I take the side of Team Human and, not only join the fight to repeal this judgement, but keep on fighting until we have extended the right to roam across the whole of England and Wales, as it is today in Scotland?\n\nIt’s a choice for us all.\n\nPerhaps the right to roam isn’t your home ground, but humanity is a team game and we need everyone to pull on a shirt and play.\n\nSo, whatever position you find yourself in, whatever special powers you bring onto the field, Team Human needs you — right now.\n\nThanks to Dan Sumption for pointing me in the direction of Team Human. Dan writes a concise, conscious newsletter over at The Mycoleum.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on how I can expand my mind, I’d be very grateful if you’d take a minute to reply to this email with a book, a podcast, an article, an intellectual or a musician that changed your paradigm.\n\nThanks 🙏\n\nSweating It Out With Strangers Put all your money on humanity, the stewards of the land, community, the carers and growers, and society, the builders and changers. We might not have money, but we’ll certainly have each other\n\nThe big reason I keep going back to sauna is stories.\n\nConversations with a revolving cast of regulars and passing trade always make me think or feel something.\n\nSometimes I think those conversations are worth writing down and sharing.\n\nSo here you go: four short stories from sweating it out with strangers.\n\n#1: Put Your Money On Humanity\n\nThe other day I had a meeting with my investment managers —\n\nWow, what an opener. That’s sauna life for you.\n\n— and I asked them, where can I put my money so it’s safe?\n\nAnd they said nowhere.\n\nIsn’t that remarkable? There is nowhere that the professionals can say will be 100 percent safe for your money right now.\n\nEven gold, they said, even gold.\n\nSorry for the depressing conversation —\n\nNo, no, it’s fine —\n\nThis is me speaking now because I’m actually finding it a reassuring conversation.\n\nThis man is learning the truth that money can’t actually do anything for you. Only humans can.\n\nAnd machines built by machines built by humans.\n\nBut mainly humans.\n\nMaybe, instead of finding somewhere for his investments to live happily ever after, this man should put all his money on humanity, the stewards of the land, community, the carers and growers, and society, the builders, dreamers and changers.\n\nIn the future, we might not have money, but we’ll certainly have each other.\n\n#2: Socialist Rather Than Progressive\n\nI met a man in his fifties, I’d guess, who was anxious, scared and angry, all because of what he’d seen on TV.\n\nWhat’s happening in Afghanistan, in Iran and in China, he told me. Terrible, terrible things.\n\nWhen I pointed out that there wasn’t much he could do about that, he replied: You’re right. It’s no better here with the clowns we’ve got in charge.\n\nYou know, a few years ago I watched that Plantagenets programme — and nothing changes. It’s the same today, right? The rich get everything and the working classes get nothing — we’re serfs to them, that’s all. Serfs.\n\nWhen I suggested that this world view might have been influenced by the same bad news he caught from TV and that some things might have changed a bit, he said: I’m with you, but I need more convincing.\n\nThe idea that things haven’t changed since the death of Richard III in 1485 strikes me as a little defeatist and surely more likely to result in things not changing, even if we would dearly love them to.\n\nIn the past 537 years, we have at least in the UK built a society where education and healthcare is free to all, without financial, ethnic, gender or class barrier.\n\nIf nothing changes, then why are so many people fighting so hard to keep it that way?\n\n#3: You Only Live Once\n\nYou Only Live Once was his mantra. On his lips and, tattooed, on his shoulders.\n\nHe worked in fintech and talked about the price of gold and the US dollar. (Bearish.)\n\nHis plan, not this year, but next, was to fly to Cape Town and, from there, five or six hours by plane to Antarctica, with another two internal flights to tour the white continent.\n\nIt’s not cheap, but it’s a once in a lifetime trip, isn’t it? Four days with only fourteen other people on board.\n\nHe hates being around other people, you see.\n\nHe hated Prague. He had to get up at 6am to walk across the Charles Bridge because of The Masses.\n\nHe believes in working first and going away after. He only wants one or two weeks a month for Euro breaks. Then one longer trip at the end of the year, when he’d earned it, you know.\n\nBefore Christmas, he did the German Christmas markets. He flew Lufthansa on two legs of the trip, from Berlin to Munich and from Munich to Prague. (Which he hated.)\n\nAt this point, our investor from the first story asks, mildly: Do you ever consider trains for these short hops when you’re in Europe?\n\nSorry?\n\nHe only lived once, you see.\n\n#4: Changing Lanes\n\nHe introduced himself as an HGV driver from Ewelme.\n\nHis daughter stayed on the lower shelf. His wife stayed in the hot tub. His son stayed quiet.\n\nHe used to be a chippie — the woodworking sort not the fish frying sort — decades in the trade. Eventually, he quit. It was doing his head in.\n\nHe retrained as an HGV driver. A big gamble for a fifty-year-old with a young family. Big gamble.\n\nBut he didn’t take to the hours at the wheel, the days of asphalt-induced solitude. Too lonely. Misses shop talk.\n\nNow he works a couple of days on the HGVs, but does a nice sideline as a skip driver and waste refuse operative.\n\nThey’re a proper team. He loves it.\n\nAnd look at him now, five years later on New Year’s Day, staying with his young family in a spa hotel on the south coast.\n\nIf you’re unhappy, I suppose, you’re never too old to change lanes.\n\nA Short Tour Of The Forgotten Elses AKA: 2022 shareholder review\n\nI’d like to begin by saying thank you for having me.\n\n2022 was a year of unprecedented growth for The David Charles Newsletter — there are 67 percent more of you here today than there were on this day a year ago.\n\nHello! 👋\n\nFor this humble director of a one-person media empire, that’s pretty exciting.\n\nBefore we go any further, I’d like to acknowledge that a whole blob of you found my work via Mike Sowden’s Everything Is Amazing. What’s amazing me right now is that most of you have stuck around. HONOURED.\n\nFor elsewho that stumbled across my pages elsewhence, please do inspect Mike’s stories. They really are very good.\n\nA Short Tour Of The Forgotten Elses\n\nelsehow (obsolete exc. dialect): In some, or any, other way.\n\nelsewards (rare): In the direction of, towards some other place.\n\nelsewhat (obsolete): Something or anything else.\n\nelsewhen (obsolete): At another time, at other times.\n\nelsewhence (archaic): From some other place or quarter.\n\nelsewither (somewhat archaic): To some other place, in some other direction\n\nelsewho (obsolete): Anyone else\n\nelsewise (in current use — really?!): In some other manner; in other circumstances, otherwise.\n\nBack in the hushed corridors of TDCN HQ, it’s been another busy year of publication, with 48 editions bringing us up to 342 since we first opened our doors in whenever it was. Wow.\n\nThis is also our third year publishing on Substack and I’d like to pause here for a short round of applause for our paying subscribers —\n\nAndy, Claire, Tudor, John, Harri, Becky, Illia, Joanna, Maryla, Cass, Georgie, James, Joe, Libby, David, Tessa, JMJ and Geoff. And shout out to those of you who have paid in the past — I haven’t forgotten you 💚\n\n(Director yelling over thunderous applause) Thank you, thank you! (Pumps chest and points out to individual members of the cheering audience, now all on their feet) Okay, okay, settle down, settle down — thank you!\n\nIf you’d like to join this merry band of paying pranksters, please come on in:\n\nSo now onto the hard numbers. What have our analysts learned from a stocktake of deliverables this year?\n\nIt comes as no surprise that the most opened email of 2022 was Man Sloth Mode, which was also the story that reached furthest outside this little bubble, with most shares, and the one that drove the highest number of new readers — welcome, friends!\n\nHere’s a snippet to remind you…\n\nFor about a year, I did nothing.\n\nFrom November 20"
