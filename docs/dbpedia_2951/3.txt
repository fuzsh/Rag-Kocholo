I am a big fan of Randolph Scott and try to watch as many of his films as I can. Why? Because Scott had a nice style--easy-going and likable yet tough. However, I must also admit that for every exceptional film his made (such as "Ride the High Country") he made several that were not so special--and perhaps a few that were simply adequate. Considering how dull this film was in spots and how similar it was to several of his other films, I'd put "The Man Behind the Gun" in this last category. Like MANY of his other films, this one is about the Civil War and divisions between Northerners and Southerners. In about half of these films (or perhaps a few less) he is working for the North and in the others he's either an agent/spy for the South or an ex-soldier after the war trying to help oppressed Southerners. To me, it's like the writers were beating a dead horse and needed some originality. The only thing SLIGHTLY original about this is that it is set just BEFORE the war instead of during or after. Otherwise, a very typical sort of formula. And, if you care, a chance to see Alan Hale, Jr. in a supporting role. In addition, there's just too much singing in this film. Now if you are NOT a fan who's seen most of his films, this may not be that important and the film might be more watchable. At best adequate.
