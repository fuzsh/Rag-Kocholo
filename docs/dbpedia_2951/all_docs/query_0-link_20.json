        "text": "Nothing in this movie makes any sense at all, except maybe as a catalogue of psychological disorders. You could examine it from all different angles, but that could be a long article, and even then, it might not all add up. So, I’m looking at it from a narrow perspective—the Ella Raines character point of view. Her name is Carol, but her boss calls her Kansas, since that’s were she’s from (and people keep telling her to “go back to Kansas”—as if the insanity of big city New York is Oz at its worst). Her boss’s wife is murdered—the police bungle the investigation and pin it on him—and also, the real murderer bribes all of his potential alibis, including the “Phantom Lady” of the title. A better title would be Nancy Drew and the Copious Nutbox—because Carol initiates her own investigation with the brashness of that precocious sleuth—and… everyone she comes into contact with seems insane. And that includes the actual killer—Franchot Tone—who doesn’t appear until halfway through! With his twitches, headaches, and hands that seem to have a mind of their own, he may as well be wearing a black sweatshirt that says “Psycho.” The funny thing is, he’s Carol’s main sidekick while sleuthing, along with a nice cop who realizes they collared the wrong guy—so we have one of the oddest trios since the Stooges.\n\nOne theory I entertained, after the happy ending, is that Carol is actually the wife who is murdered (as we never meet the wife at the beginning)—and so she’s, then, essentially solving her own murder—only to be murdered again—in an endless loop. And she’s not only the victim, but she’s also the angel of death—because everyone she comes into contact with ends up dead. Maybe that’s a bit much, but it kinda works. Anyway, the movie (directed by Robert Siodmak) looks great, excellent moody sets, good locations, and Ella Raines is fun to watch. The best (and probably most famous) scene is when she goes undercover as a somewhat bimbo-ish jazz groupie, picking up one of the potential alibi witnesses, drummer, Cliff (Elisha Cook, Jr., in his best-ever part). He takes her to an afterhours club with wild jazz improv going on. Her floozie act is so awkward (chomping gum and using bad grammar) it makes her normal acting (which is pretty overwrought, in this movie) seem natural and restrained. The scene culminates with Cliff’s awesome drum solo, Carol egging him on with obscene gestures—the whole thing reaching a frenzied climax. If the censors in 1944 had been attuned to allegory, this movie would have earned an “X” rating!\n\n5.30.24\n\n“How do you knock on a tent?” one of the civilians jokes as she arrives at the military hospital. They are out of their element, scared, but also overconfident and wisecracking—some of them. A group of women who are stranded in the Philippines as the Battle of Bataan commences are without the best options, and so they’re recruited to volunteer at an overwhelmed military hospital. Not only are the doctors and nurses too few, and exhausted—they are being bombed. And if that wasn’t enough, there’s rampant disease, including malaria. It’s as grim as can be. An ensemble of fine actresses playing average women—there’s seven of them—including top billed Ann Sothern, Joan Blondell, and Margaret Sullavan—who plays one of the military nurses who is suffering from malignant malaria but insists on staying on there. They’re all pretty intense.\n\nI read that it was based on a play, which is obvious—you can almost see the curtain come down between scenes—and off-screen action and time is condensed between dramatic scenes—not a bad thing, necessarily. Any kind of high point is quickly followed by a low—really quickly—and sometimes really, really low. Yet they keep finding ways to joke, laugh, and get excited about things. One of the real high points is when one of the women comes up with a bar of soap! They’re all freaking out—and when Ella Raines gets ahold of it, she identifies it: “Fels Naptha!” That leads to a few of the woman bathing in a lagoon, using the new soap, and swimming—one of the nicest scenes in the movie—and one of the few times we’re out of the grim encampment. But remember what I said about the rollercoaster nature of the storylines? I can’t say more without including one of those silly disclaimers.\n\nElla Raines is the biggest wimp of all of them, but then undergoes the biggest transformation—after a particularly devastating attack, and she tries to comfort a dying soldier, who happens to be played by Robert Mitchum! The total change in her character, after that point, is both understandable and believable. Naturally the movie has a patriotic slant, but it’s hard not to see it as tragic and grim. Sure, the spirit and heroism of the women is inspiring, but the end comes as they’ve all been captured, and we’re left with the horrifying reality of war. I guess that’s realistic, and at least they didn’t tack on a happy-go-lucky fantasy feelgood conclusion simply rake in those extra dollars that accompanies not bumming audiences out. The movie stays true to what it is.\n\n5.22.24\n\nPretty standard WWII era war movie, on one hand—but it’s got plenty of other stuff, like romance, revenge, and weather. Raised voices goes without saying (war). The three Rs of cinema of course being romance, revenge, and raised voices—but my personal favorite story element is weather. I suppose all seafaring adventures include weather, and all war movies are about revenge. I admit to having enjoyed some war movies, but I don’t generally care for them, as there is almost nothing more depressing to me than war… though revenge is right up there. Victory and vengeance are words that make no sense to me. I’ve seen this story many times, just not with these movie stars (stars should be one of the three Rs). Especially Randolph Scott, who I was named after! (I don’t know anyone else named after an actor, besides my brother.) He was mostly in Westerns (and I hated Westerns as a kid—but have come around to them a bit) and I felt he really elevated the genre. He’s in some war movies, as well. Here he plays a ship captain in the Canadian navy, out to get revenge on German U-boats. I enjoy movies like this if they’re more about sailing and weather than fighting—here, a lot of both. The Corvette is a smaller warship (the car was named after the ship) and K-225 is one we see being launched for war and manned by our stars (also including Robert Mitchum!). But not including Ella Raines—no women on the boat—and she’s the reason I’m watching this movie in the first place—her first role! She plays the sister of a sailor killed on Randolph Scott’s previous boat—and now her other brother in on this boat. During the time at shore—beginning of the movie—ER and RS hang out a bit—so for me, that’s the heart of the movie—to say the least—the fireworks—it’s reason for the movie existing. Once they head off to war, no more Ella Raines—so, other than the rough weather—bummer. So it goes with war movies. Why couldn’t ER have stowed away like this cute little puppy who stowed away (sailor aided) and ended up being the star of the show?\n\n10.3.23\n\nMy favorite two movies in the last half of this year have been playing at the Milwaukee Art Museum, in the little basement theaters as part of a photography exhibit. It’s my favorite part of the museum, and they take it all down and reinstall a new show a couple times a year or so, it seems. These two movies make a nice double feature, as different as they are. The way they show them, though, is in the art instillation way, not the movie way, which is okay with me, generally—they are each on a loop, so there’s no real start and end time. You just drop in and watch—I suspect most people don’t stay for more than a few minutes. I don’t either, but over the months I’ve seen all of both films multiple times—a few minutes here and a few minutes there. It’s not unlike the way I watch things that are streaming, or on TV, too. I have to say, I’ve probably gotten a lot more out of these two pieces by watching them that way than if I’d watched each from end to end, once each.\n\nThe shorter of the two is called Lunch Break—it’s from 2008, by Sharon Lockhart—and as I recall reading, it was shot on film in a huge ship building factory in Maine. It looks like the camera traveled from one end of the place to the other, during breaktime, as the workers are sitting, resting, eating, reading. The film was then manipulated, by reprinting frames, to slow everything down to where the movement is barely detected—so that it takes 83 minutes for the camera’s journey—which is the optimum length for a feature film, if you want to look at it that way. There is sound—I’m not sure how it was manipulated—that roughly corresponds with the visuals. One thing that’s fun to imagine is how different the viewing experience would be if you dropped in a song now and then, so you’d have a series of odd but connected music videos. If I can find this movie streaming, I might try it as an experiment. Anyway, the whole thing is endlessly fascinating, visually—the details of the manmade environment—both beautiful and horrifying, but also mundane and ugly. All of those, at once. And really, really, slowly. I wonder if there is a drug that makes things look like this, and I wonder if anyone who was filmed in the space has seen the movie—and I wonder if it made them feel like they were on drugs.\n\nThe longer of the films is called BNSF and it’s from 2013, by James Benning. That stands for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, and this long video is a single shot of a length of train track in the desert, with mountains and sky in the background. The placement of the camera feels both random and deliberate—it is a pleasing composition. The manmade elements, besides the train tracks, are a line of telephone poles, and a barely discernable gravel road—both running along the side of the tracks. The length of this piece is also movie length—but a long movie. It’s 195 minutes, which is three hours and 15 minutes—exactly the length of the hit movie, Titanic (1997). Whether or not this is intentional, it’s hilarious. There is a lot of scraggly vegetation in the foreground—I think it’s sagebrush—you feel like you can almost touch it, blowing in the wind. The series of mountain ranges in the background are beautiful. The video takes place over a time of day (maybe late afternoon) where the light is steadily changing. Clouds are on the move, and the sun is to our back, left—shadows appear, disappear, lengthen. The telephone pole in the foreground is very defined, but the line of poles quickly becomes invisible with distance.\n\nThe sound in this movie is a major element—it’s, as they used to say, made loud to be played loud. Most of the time it’s nearly silent, but you hear the wind against the microphone—not how wind sounds in nature, of course, but it’s recognizable as a thing. Then a train comes, and it’s the loudest thing you’ve ever heard. Periodic, monstrous, really long, freight trains. Most of this movie is nothing much happening besides drifting clouds and changing light, but there are lot of trains out there, too, coming from either direction. A funny thing about trains is, if you’re out walking and a train goes by, there’s nothing more fascinating—I’ll stop and watch the whole thing. But if you’re driving somewhere and get stopped by a train, there’s nothing more frustrating. Which seems, to me, to be a problem with cars, not trains. A few times, for some reason, I felt like I could see something glinting in the sun, way far off, around the middle of the composition. It made me think of Montgomery Clift, in The Misfits (1961) (much of which takes place in a landscape that looks like this one), where he says, “I saw something glinting… in the sun.”\n\nBecause these two theaters, showing these movies, are in close proximity and are not exactly soundproof (no doors), you might be sitting in Lunch Break, aware of the lowkey, industrial hum, and then be aware of an increasing, low rumbling and realize it’s a train coming, in the next theater. You can run over if you want to see the train. The train sound is so thunderously loud, at some points, you can hear it from anywhere in the basement—and can be drawn to the theater—that is, if you know what the sound is and where it’s coming from.\n\nOne criticism I have, not of the movies, but of the venues, is that each has only a single, hard, wooden bench to sit on—like something that would be nailed down in a park by the sea—built to withstand the weather. Not exactly comfortable. Imagine a movie theater with, instead of comfy reclining seats, a single hard bench. It’s like they’re telling you you’re not supposed to spend any longer than a few seconds in either theater, but instead, quick check-in, then read the art-talk description that tells you what the movies are “about” so you can notch your culture scorecard like you’re collecting sports memorabilia. What they should have is actual movie theater seats—so you can, if you choose, watch each film in its entirety, aided by posted start and finish times. It might also be nice if they sold popcorn.\n\nI've walked out of a movie theater maybe once—just can't do it—but the nice thing about watching movies at home is that I have no qualms about turning it off once I realize it's garbage. So why did I torture myself by watching this movie to the end? First of all, just by chance, one of the last movies I watched was also called The Woman in the Window (Dir. Fritz Lang, 1944)—which I happened to watch as part of research I'm doing for a novel I'm writing that deals with voyeurism, obsession with a painting, and “the unreliable narrator.” So when this 2021 The Woman in the Window immediately referred to two other sources of my inspiration—Laura (1944) and Rear Window (1954)—I was in— despite the obvious red flags (based on bestselling thriller novel; production history—if you pay attention to that kind of thing). My favorite part of this movie is how Amy Adams recites her address like 18 times, so of course you look it up—and seeing the actual location exteriors (a brownstone block in Harlem) gives you a kind of interactive voyeuristic thrill. Also, I'm all for revisiting Rear Window (in fact, I have a proposed “sequel” to that great film in an outline—a kind of obvious idea that someone else will no doubt get to, first). The appeal of Rear Window, however, isn't its grisly murder or un-shocking ending, but its style, the world it creates, and its humor. The only thing that I found remotely humorous in this movie is when Amy Adams tried looking up her mysterious neighbor, Jane Russell, on the internet—and, of course, there's lots of images of Jane Russell. Ultimately, the only thing shocking about this movie was how it turned out to be moronic “make-you-jump” horror movie manipulation, propelled by the schlocky, cliché-ridden Danny Elfman score. Especially shocking given that some of my favorite actors are in it, including one who is credited as screenwriter. The final third especially felt like too many amateur coke-head chefs in someone's dad's ill-fated restaurant kitchen. I don't know, maybe the audience for this kind of high-pitched, sharp-object conclusion is kids who filmed/videoed much the same things—while at that tender age—as we did (Rolf, 1975, Super-8). And maybe it's really just my problem, expecting more, and being fooled to watch it until its final credit: “The making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of work hours.” Nice. Billions and Billions Served.\n\nCar accident framing device, then... our hero, Phyllis Holmes (Ella Raines) wrapped in bandages. We go back... back... to Fresno—she's talented and well-liked, good with children, and going into the designing clothing business... etc. But she can't land a man... or even get a job in a department store—why? Because she's homely! Watching this movie kind of makes you feel insane because, of course, she's beautiful—she's Ella Raines. I suppose they gave her a dowdy hairstyle, no lipstick, and I guess they gave her a slight prosthetic nose—it's subtle—not like a clown nose or anything. I'm guessing the unspoken intention was to make her look “Jewish”—which adds an additional, disturbing slant to this story. Anyway, she keeps getting reality shoved in her face and she's—for good reason—angry. The story is a bit convoluted, but the actors do remarkably well with dialogue that's about as smooth as a train with square wheels.\n\nShe goes to help her friend (a woman who's going through hard times herself because she's getting older—her husband is leaving her for an younger woman) and bam! We're back to the beginning. Once Phyllis recovers from the accident, her doctor essentially gives her a nose-job, and just like that she's beautiful, and also glamorous, now—dresses well, new hairstyle, and makeup—and suddenly all the men are falling all over her—even some who met her before now don't recognize her! This reminded me of how it used to piss off my mom when, in movies, they shorthanded “ugly” by having a woman wear glasses—then she'd take them off and guys would all suddenly come in their pants.\n\nAnyway, even though the “world is her oyster” now, she has kept her anger and kind of breezes through high society like an assassin. At a pool party she meets a wise old drunk, a rich guy who tells her how empty his life is—always realizing that people only like him for his money. She's smart enough to apply that. Then she finds out that the guy who secretly paid for her plastic surgery was her old friend who was in love with her when she was “ugly”—but she had told to fuck off. She goes back to him, now in love with him, but now he doesn't want her because he “liked her how she was before”—see, he's afraid of having a beautiful wife because he had one once who left him. So now he tells her to fuck off, and she leaves. Then he goes running after her in rom-com style, she stops, sees him, runs back—but is hit by a truck! Now she's ugly again, but now—he loves her again—but now—now she thinks he's just pitying her—so she tells him to fuck off again. And it just goes on and on and on—the comic cosmic clown parade of stupid vanity, self-destruction, tragic luck, and bad choices. Aren't humans silly? Oh, did I forget to say “spoiler alert?” It's okay, because a lot of that, toward the end, I just made that up! You'll have to watch it to find out what really happens!\n\nThis 1957 Randolph Scott Western, directed by Budd Boetticher, makes very little sense as a traditional narrative—it's more like an absurdist essay on the the Western form—at least that's how it seems to me—watching in my usual way—piecemeal, decimated, distracted, on TV, between hideous commercials, and writing this as I'm watching. It starts out nicely, with Randolph Scott and his comic relief buddy (Noah Berry Jr.—who gets tragically killed the way buddies always do in movies). Randolph Scott, it turns out, wants to kill a man for revenge—I won't go into it. Anyway, he gets holed up in a stable for almost the whole movie. I wrote that the buddy was killed before it even happened—since you could see that coming down Fifth Avenue—and now it just did. This movie is kind of like Dog Day Afternoon (which happens to be on the other channel right now)—now that I think of it. It's someone holed up in a standoff for nearly the entire length of the movie, but it's not about the standoff—it's about everything that goes on around it—an essay on society, hypocrisy, hate, and fear. And then the most lovable character in the movie is killed. (Okay, maybe in DDA he wasn't the most lovable—he's a bit of a psychopath—but he's played by John Cazale who brought more heart to his roles than anyone could ever expect.) After the buddy was killed in this one, I kind of gave up on the (anti)hero, Randolph Scott, and the townspeople, and humanity. But the movie ultimately redeemed itself for me, because you can't help but expect one of those absurd turn-arounds at the end where the star ends up with a beautiful woman—but not in this one. People try to be nice to him, even, but he's just like a shell of a person. And then, not having had the satisfaction of revenge, and knowing that he couldn't help the people he loves—he rides off into the sunset, a broken man. Now that I think about it, this is actually a lot more like a Seventies movie than a typical, formulaic Fifties Western, like so many I've seen on TV lately. It must have been a satisfying picture to be involved with, even if—I'm guessing—a lot of people didn't get it.\n\nThe Donut King is a 2020 documentary by Alice Gu which is on the film festival circuit in this difficult time for new films; I watched it as part of the virtual Milwaukee Film Festival, going on now. I would like to be watching a lot more movies this way, but I'm currently unemployed, and the money is running out, and the near-future a little shaky at this point. So I'm being cautious. I am grateful to have found out about this film by MFF emails—one arrived yesterday alerting my about it. The odd thing is that it was the day after I received some advance copies of my long awaited novel, The Doughnuts (and the day before it became available as an ebook—today). That kind of coincidence doesn't happen every day, so I bought a ticket and watched it alone. It's a great film, about rise of the Cambodian donut shops in Southern California, focusing mostly on a Cambodian refuge, Ted Ngoy—how he came to the US, worked as a baker, then started his own donut shop, and then kept opening franchises, and sponsoring more refugees, helping others start shops, and on and on. It starts with a bit of the history of Cambodia during the Vietnam war, and the refugee crisis at that time—a brief, but necessary, history lesson to lead into this donut saga. Then there's some history of the donut business in this country—Dunkin' Vs. Winchell's, etc., and a bit of the recent history of Los Angeles, through the donut lens. So it's also a bit of an “American Dream” saga, which is complete with the downfall chapter—linked to, yes, Las Vegas, and an addiction—yes, gambling. It's a great inspiring, hopeful, tragic, sad, and ultimately humane story—to some degree universal, but very much more rich as it focuses in on the immigrant experience, then the Cambodian immigrant story, specially, then this particular family, and finally this kind of remarkable man, Ted Ngoy. Along the way, there is plenty of visual stimulation, as well—that is, donut “porn”—even when you can't eat them, donuts are great to look at—and there's plenty of that, here. Oh, and by the way, the only place the novel, The Doughnuts, crosses over, is that it's set partly in LA, and some of the shops in the movie provide an occasional setting for scenes. If you ever wondered, like I did, what's with all the donut shops in LA?—this is your movie. It answers that mystery—plus, you get some history, humanity, and some great real-life characters, on the way.\n\nThis is a 1955 Randolph Scott Western, directed by Lesley Selander. It starts out in the usual way, a man riding a horse, alone in Western, open, idyllic country. But then he comes upon a shootout, and instead of getting out of the way, he gallops over, saves a guy, kills a guy. He and the guy he saves have some common past, but it's not spelled out yet. But something's up. A little later, he rides into town, goes to the saloon, drinks some whiskey. There's a card game going on, an attractive woman who sings at the saloon, a gunslinger named “The Peso Kid” standing at the bar—the usual. We start to get to know a complex web of characters. Then, up in his room with a guy, Randolph Scott removes his shirt, but they don't make love. Instead, he shows the guy the scars on his back from when he was whipped by someone. Not in a good way. So very quickly, we find out that revenge is the motive here. Soon we'll also find out that there's a woman involved (Dorothy Malone). Scott has his usual look, sharply dressed, including a neck scarf. His overall appearance is a little ragged, though, including his hat, and I think this means something. Maybe he's in store for some self-improvement. RS gets ambushed, knocked over the head with a board. Before the dudes can kill him, however, the woman who sings at the bar, Reva, rides up shooting with her rifle and saves him! She's kind of the real star of this movie—earlier she gave him a good lecture about hate, and told him he should just leave. She's totally right, too, but of course, then we wouldn't have a movie. She's played by Peggie Castle, who I'm not familiar with. Internet says she specialized in playing the “other woman.” I guess I know what that means, but I never gave it much thought—that's an interesting concept to dwell on. Anyway, there's a lot of politics in this movie—I won't go into it all—but it's a good one. It's the not uncommon setup where you have corrupt, weak, and villainous people in a town—pitted against corrupt, weak, and villainous people at a ranch. Randolph Scott is against all of them (except for Reva, who being a woman, sane, good, interesting, and not the top-billed star, gets the short end of the stick). The odds are totally against RS, and he'd be pretty much screwed if he wasn't, you know, the star of the movie. The ending is one of those that both kind of drops in from the heavens, and drops the ball. The less said about the ending, the better.\n\nI read that the movie Groundhog Day (1993) (Dir. Harold Ramis) was leaving Netflix on Sept. 1, which is kind of cruel, in that, isn't this the movie that's getting everyone through this thing... like if you watch it every day? Maybe not. I shouldn't complain—we shouldn't complain about entertainment options, I mean—imagine if we were like in the early days of home VHS, when everyone had like 4 tapes—how sick you'd be of those! Anyway, I've only heard Groundhog Day referenced with the COVID 19 pandemic like 700 times now, so I thought I'd watch it again. It's a weird thing about this movie, I don't know how many times I've watched it, and I can never remember what happens! Not just the very end, but even the plot development, etc. It's like it becomes erased from my mind. As I was watching it, I thought I'd remember how it played out, and I did not. The end was a total surprise. Maybe I had actually never watched it to the end, but that's crazy. So anyway, I thought I'd better write up this article immediately, just in case I can't remember it tomorrow. Maybe no one remembers it! In which case, I guess I'll just recommend it. I think it's a pretty great movie—there's snow!—it's kind of the ultimate romantic comedy—Bill Murray is at his best—I don't need to go into the plot or anything because everyone has seen this movie, probably multiple times. If there is someone out there who hasn't, you sure don't want me ruining it for you now. I was actually surprised at how serious it got at one point—I mean, it practically turned me into stone. Or into a believer of something. Something. Or maybe stone. Who knows. I won't remember tomorrow. Of course, I can read this... but I never read my own shit. It's too embarrassing. I'm hopeless. Plus, I'm not sure that not only every memory of the movie is erased, come the next day, but also writing about it doesn't disappear. I couldn't find a thing about it, on the internet. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong internet. Are we all looking at the same internet? I don't think so. Anyway, of course there was the basic stuff—who's responsible for it, when and where it was shot, how many rotting tomatoes, box office. I noticed that it came out mid-February 1993—significant for me—and maybe I did see it then—because exactly eight months later (you know, the 8 month rule) I quit drinking for good, which is maybe the hardest thing I ever did, and of not little importance to my life, I like to think. So, if you happen to read this (though I'm convinced this file will disappear somehow) and you happen to be in a place where you're wondering about quitting drinking, yourself, feel free to contact me and talk. I don't know if I can help or not, but I'll try. All I know about that is you have to do it alone, and you can't do it alone. If that sounds like a contradiction, yeah. Most important things do seem contradictory, confusing, and very, very hard. Sometimes you have to just keep trying, keep trying... and then one day, it's all very easy... and then one day, you're dead... and then...\n\nI've been watching some old Westerns on TV, in part because they're the only movies I can get on broadcast TV, and also out of fascination—that there are so many of these Fifties and Sixties Westerns—no wonder I hated them, growing up. They're all variations on the themes of bullying, fear, courage, stupidity, and worshiping the ability to draw a gun faster than the person you are shooting. There's occasionally discussion of morals, wrong, and right—but nowhere near as much as discussion of speed. If you wonder why the USA is known for, as much as anything, sports and gun violence, these old Westerns are a good place to start. This a 1964 Audie Murphy picture, directed by Sidney Salkow. I got sucked into this one because our hero is returning to Shelby, Montana, which I know from being one of the stops on the Amtrak. The town may as well, however, be called “Hell,” because a signifiant part of the tough guy population is gone on a cattle drive, and a large outlaw gang is on their way there to take the cattle money and rape the women. Audie M. is returning because his old girlfriend, Helen, the schoolteacher, is there—but it turns out the reason he had left in the first place was because he killed a couple of guys—and of course their dad wants to kill him. The ex tells him she's getting married to the Sheriff—who's played by James Best, who is a great old actor—young here, and very compelling. He can tell Helen is still in love with Audie, so he calls off the wedding—not even jealous! Then when the preacher pleads with him to try to go to reason with the outlaws, he does, and they just shoot him, unceremoniously. Not very smart—everyone saw that coming. Anyway, the movie plays out in absurd Western action fashion, in the last five minutes, and is ultimately a story about the love of the gun.\n\nIn my lifetime, or my grandchildren's, there's a greater chance of all human life being eradicated than war being eradicated, and so I guess as long as we keep having wars we're going to keep making pro-war movies—this one is this year's most popular one—it's won and is nominated for many industry awards. I refused to go, but then went to see it with a friend—I love being wrong about things, and for half of this movie I felt like I had been wrong not to want to see it—it was so much fun, kind of like that pro-war classic, Apocalypse Now (1979). Also, there are a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding this film, including that it was shot in one continuous take (and why not!) and the title, 1917, when you turn it upside down says “Libi” which is a girl's name of Hebrew origin meaning, “My Heart”—director Sam Mendes' secret dedication to someone, possibly his mother. And why not? We never forget our moms.\n\nAnyway, I loved the journey through those cool looking trenches—it felt like a video game where you keep going to a different, deeper level. Also, it took me back to childhood when we built forts and dug tunnels. We also played POW camp, thinking we were destined for Vietnam. By the time the guy fell into the river, however, I was pretty far removed from any reality, but I was still willing to forgive the pic had it followed the following storyline. Anyone who remembers seeing the 16mm short “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge” (based on the Ambrose Bierce story) projected in grade-school, certainly thought about that classic while the guy was washed downstream. What I expected, then, was for him to finally reach the safety of a sunbaked shore (and maybe some bathing French prostitute/nurses) when he would suddenly be thrust back to the point of being buried alive after the rat (spoiler alert) tripped the explosive wire—and when his friend tried to dig him out he was, alas, dead. From that point on it's just the other guy—but repeating the exact same steps, but now alone. So then, when the plane crashes and he pulls the guy from the plane, when the pilot pulls a knife on him, he immediately shoots him—and is thus not, this time, mortally wounded. I think audiences would absolutely eat up this twist—but hey, no one was taking my notes.\n\nOther suggestions I have to improve the second half of the movie include getting rid of the score, or at least reduce it somewhat, so it's not the loudest, most overbearing and manipulative thing you've ever heard. Also, an alternative ending could be when the guy finally gets to Colonel Cumberbatch with the letter from the General, he could pull it out of the envelope and (remember all that time he was in the water?) on the paper is nothing but faint clouds of faded ink. They all laugh, give the bloke some tea, and send him into battle with the rest of the poor bastards. Or, even better, when he finally reaches the destination, it seems that they have already received the message that he was bringing and called off the attack. It seems that the General, no idiot, in an effort to hedge his bets, sent out scores of two man teams with the same letter, each thinking they were the only hope, and so actually several identical letters had reached their destination first. They all have tea and yuck it up, then, but our hero, understandably, is considerably perturbed.\n\nRandy Russell 2.9.20"
