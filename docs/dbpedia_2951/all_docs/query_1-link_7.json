        "text": "I hadn't watched a Western in 14 days leading up to Christmas, probably my longest streak without one this year, but given that Santa had provided several new additions to my collection that included some really hard to find titles, Boxing Day felt like the perfect time to clock up my 300th Western for 2022.\n\nSo The Man Behind the Gun is another of Randolph Scott's forgotten low budget films from the early 1950's. As someone who's tried to keep the genre in vogue here on LB, this one unfortunately doesn't do big Randy justice with a dodgy script and a less than compelling plot that feels like it runs out of steam halfway through. Scott plays an undercover army…\n\nAfter you've seen enough Randolph Scott westerns (this is my 51st), they all start to blend together, but this one is stranger than most. Scott plays a Mexican War veteran and notorious gunslinger who masquerades as a schoolteacher in Los Angeles in order to thwart a conspiracy by pro-slavery revolutionists who want Southern California to secede from the Union. For his comic sidekicks, one (Dick Wesson) wields a bullwhip like Indiana Jones, and the other is played by the Skipper from Gilligan's Island (Alan Hale Jr.). Screenwriter John Twist lives up to his name, as the plot is loaded with twists and turns that don't make a whole lot of sense. I think he bit off more than he could…"
